       back to the Colgate tube   sometimes we see things that aren't supposed to be there, but are just there and we do nothing about it.  what do i do with the toothpaste?  brush my teeth. literally and figuratively.  what a very hygienic, Eric Baine-ic epiphany...

      no, no. i am not pissed off with him. somehow, i do not have enough energy to mind otherwise significant matters that could affect our relationship. i have known him for quite a while and well, i accept how and what he is. this is such a vague way of writing about it, i know. my mind is just going on circles anyway. maybe if i could just finally buy that splendid pair of boots...  hmm. i hate it when i try to make myself feel better by shopping. it makes my feelings shallow. however sometimes the best way to cure depression or any other get-me-out-of-the-pits feeling is to shop like crazy. perhaps i feel (or rather,im afraid i WOULD feel) shallow now because my reason for doing so IS indeed superficial...  accuse me of blabbering.

       what is this toothpaste doing on my desk?   there's a Colgate tube right beside the keyboard, so that as i am pounding on the keys now, the toothpaste gets into my peripheral vision. im in a rut now, actually. it's been a long day in the office--we had our monthly meeting the whole morning, had this Gender and Development talk after lunch which extended for the rest of the afternoon--now the toothpaste is still here.  it's pay day today and frankly, it doesn't feel it. this morning, i planned to make a list of things to be thankful for, but oh well, yeah, yeah, i know, i know. sigh. thank you God for everything...  sigh.  i still could let out the biggest sigh in the world right now...

      last week, my cousins and i celebrated Borgy and Ina's birthdays. we played billiards at Bargo and had coffee at Portico to welcome Borgy's birthday. we had fun and though im tamad to write about it, here's a few snippets of the night's conversations:   barry:  lahat ba ng bar may billiards?  tere:  nope  barry:  eh ano ang meron sa lahat ng bar?  tere:  bar.  ***  borgy:  yung iba may ledge for you to dance (then winks at me)  barry:  masarap ba yun?  ***  me:  o, ako na ang magbabayad ng table ( referring to the billiard table)   barry:   shocked,looks down on   our   table  may bayad `tong table???!!!???  ***  barry:  while walking along nakpil, peeking through bars' open doors  ay oo nga lahat may bar!  ***  oh little boy... : )

       on pain   for Pierre   we take turns taking in pain because it comes to us unbidden suddenly, the hand catches it and without anywhere  to place it on, not a secret pocket to stash it in, you close your palm around it, pain; that when its thorns bleeds your skin, and pain, pain is spelled on your face---you writhe  i open my hand  and take my turn.  12:48 am 28 september 2003

       bravo magnifico   dear kris,  no, i am not a fan of yours. but i admit to seeing  pido dida , and cringed when you kissed rene requiestas. i admit to watching the vizconde massacre and witnessing your pleas on screen while your character was being raped and butchered to pieces. i admit to watching game ka na ba and commenting on your wardrobe to my housemates. i admit to enjoying your interviews with people on your shows. i admit to knowing you on TV.  so again, you came out drying your laundry--pardon the euphemism. no, i wont berate you for that. i'll leave that to noynoy, tita cory, the GMA 7 people and the many, many pinoys who hate you.   so what the heck am i writing here about?  that you, kris, are perhaps one perfect example of how commodified this sad republic is...  oh, and wait, some girls went rah-rah-rah when you expressed how much you wanted to crush  it .   and you know what? no matter how people claim you are one disgusting whore of a woman, believe them not.  they still beat primetime to get home and watch you, dont they?  love, tintin

       viva gabriela    and i was right. one prominent feminist group has already come out and spoken about the joey and kris issue. they support kris. they would stick it out with her. they would rally for the man's castration, er, conviction.   but do they really care?  isn't this a very good publicity to earn the public's support? to garner points for possible funding? do they really care---like they dont think Kris is a slut who deserves her own shit???  ah, philippines, my philippines...

      sarcasm. disgust. everyone has a mouthful to say. everyone has suddenly become extraordinarily opinionated than when asked what-do-you-think-of-the-charter-change. funny how filipinos love making a spectacle of themselves. funny how we live up to what the world calls us. we love fiestas. and we celebrate it to mock ourselves.

       so she has bruises, doesn't know how a 9mm looks like, throws a Lamberge lamp on the bed   i am entertained. ang saya-saya.   of course the two TV networks have it made for them: more soap to sell, as kulas says. more money. rating are skyrocketing. both stations banner: who is telling the truth?  now, come on. as if people care. as if these sanctimonious media people care. as if the police care. as if these freaking lawyers care. as if as if...  i bet globe and smart are just waiting for the red light to come up with a poll:  kanino ka kakampi? Text 236666 and type in Kris or Joey and win a front seat ticket to the first court hearing...

       and the word was made flesh   now, the CBCP must be hollering from beloved intramusos  blasphemy is a sin ! what is the filipino nation talking about for the past two days?  joey and kris. kris and joey.  last night was really great as kris made a tell-all on TV, the interview done by another K in the industry--korina sanchez. people have been discussing The Couple nonstop: over lunch, by the bus stop, in a public restroom queue, at the dining table, and jeehzuz w. christ, im sure, even the souls in purgatory are joining in the festivities.  so what happened to the jose pidal case? the absence of madame president? the DENR bidding anomaly? i'd wager that even if Jupiter collides with earth tonight, Pinoys wouldnt even budge from sitting in front of their TVs or from listening to AM stations...  this is sad according to some respected journalists. some things in question: 1) the social concerns of Filipinos are downgraded to showbiz LQ 2) following the first premise, Filipinos are  tired  of the never-ending scams of the government, the poverty and the always-empty wallet 3) philippine journalism is tantamount to the price of  galunggong  in the market 4) US$ = PhP 55+  so what do i really think about it, you ask?  i am entertained. now i couldblog about how i used to tell people that kris is ok with me: i dont care if people find her too open for comfort, dont care if she "ruins" her family name, dont care if she's maarte. i like her consistency. i like it that she parades herself as all of the above and doesnt give a shit about it. people talk about her, dont they? dont you? thing is, people hate her for her guts. Guts. this, my dear Watson, is what Kristine Bernadette Cojuangco Aquino has.

       she walks out, he walks in.   tina arrived and gave me my olive body mist. yum.  some cosmic adherence of minds (that, may i add, rarely happens to kulas and me): kulas was wearing a light yellow shirt and i was in a tank top of the same color. nice. : )  went to della strada to hear mass after, had dinner at the Old Spaghetti House in katips. the herbed mustard chicken i had was a disappointment. i think kulas enjoyed his spare ribs.  lessons learned: eat what the restaurant's name says,ok. eat burgers when it says it's a burger joint, pasta when it says so, and junk when you're a sucker. darn.

      i never made it to Discovery. after having lunch with Tere, i headed to starbucks katipunan to wait for tina. it was a nice, traffic jam-free ride. i arrived early so i dropped by national bookstore first. i did my usual rounds of the bookstore, but the security guard kept following me, probably thinking i was a shoplifting Atenean. (one big fight! tadah!)   i got a handful of those fancy rubber erasers. i made sure to get really small stuff so they'd fit my hand---i wanted him to think i WAS really going to shoplift.  when he still followed me stealthily to the New Age section, i put the erasers on the book rack, literally barked at him, smiled and sauntered out of the freaking bookstore.  then it was time for a frappuccino.  cool.

       monday tra-la-la   it's back to work. before i launch into my usual rant about the papers on my desk, i want to post something about my weekend first.  friday night was delicious. need i say more? *wink wink*   i woke up late on saturday morning. i was supposed to go to Discovery Suites and observe the teacher's training SAS conducted that day. well, i woke up late and just texted Marge I couldnt make it that day. told her i'll try sunday.   spent the whole day in bed, the RC in one hand, and anything edible in the other. i had brunch with barry and bryan--mongo and longganiza. eeew. nothing else to eat eh. when tere woke up, she asked one of the girls to buy her food from jollibee.  i slept the whole afternoon. by nine p.m., kulas arrived and we had coffee at intramuros.  we debated over the  richness of his experiences and interaction with his barkada.  i was insisting that age has nothing to do with the quality of interactions one will make with other people. the experiences may vary though. that, i agree with him.   we drove to roxas boulevard after, and walked along the promenade. daming tao so we went home na lang...  back at my place, napasubo si kulas to drink with my uncles! ehehe...  i think he made it with my tito cezar. they bought have a really admirable devotion to the church so they managed to strike a chord there.

      yes, it's friday. i'd like to have a really cool, relaxing evening with Kulas. and no honey, no davids tonight...  kulas. we two click very well we could even pinch hit it one of those stand-up comedy bars. when i'm not sulking or mulling over something, i would be badgering kulas with my kakulitan and he obliges---nah, surrenders to me. hehehe. wawa naman si kulas, always the object of my  pang-aalaska .   on another topic, i'd like to go back to working on my research for Our House--the art center for kids i am putting up. Our House is the marble in my pocket now. it keeps me on my toes.

      tina and i had a meeting with marge and gigi of Sa Aklat Sisikat Foundation in Makati. i get excited everytime we meet these people. i like their jobs and i think that's the kind of thing i'd like to do. i know however that working on the Project's Information Education Communication thrusts is close to what marge does----except that i have to deal with bureaucracy and politics and the usual baloney of government procedures. BUT if we could just work on our REAL plans for the Project, work wouldn't be really work. it would also, always be fun.

       nina and sam   while i was having my after-lunch smoke by the office stairwell, i thought of two of my dearest friends.   one being the opposite of the other, nina and sam have a lot going on for them--one is their commitment to each other. i have known them for four years already; met them first when i got back in manila from a two-year scholarship grant in Silliman. i got in touch with them because of my masters thesis--something about the development of a philippine literary theory of lesbian criticism. my department chair in S.U. was keen on making me work on that primarily because i am into women's studies.   when i first met them, i marvelled at the way they radiate the differences in their personalities. nina is the more outspoken, opinionated one. she writes while sam critiques her. sam, on the other hand, is quiet but when she speaks, she's got a lot to say, i tell you. sam babies nina and i like it when i witness them that way. i become even prouder that they're my friends.  i was there when they got married about two years ago. i was the wedding camera person so while everyone was dressed rather nicely, i was in my usual tank top-cargo pants-sneakers getup.   when the guests saw sam coming down the spiral staircase of the ballroom, silence fell. and in that silence, awe and joy were felt. sam was lovely in her purple (or violet?) wedding dress...  when they exchanged their vows, sam's voice quivered while nina tried to appear cool.  i miss them and that is why i am probably writing about them now.

       how was your day, tintin?       My inner child is sixteen years old!    Life's not fair! It's never been fair, but while adults might just accept that, I know something's gotta change. And it's gonna change, just as soon as I become an adult and get some power of my own.    urlLink   How Old is Your Inner Child?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    my inner child is 16! i was hoping i was somewhat younger. 8 perhaps; 11 even. i was tatay's brightest apo--i remember him telling guests and relatives. when i was eight, i thought of becoming a journalist---my earliest sign of being inclined to Writing. also, when i was eight, i got to read my mom's diary for the first time...  but no, i am 16 according to that test. why should i always be way ahead of my time or of what i ought to be?   adults have never really answered most of my questions. i got to figure them out by myself.

            you are red. you are impure, but noble. you are precious and true to yourself and others. when you love, you love entirely, and will do anything to make your love happy. you are sure of your identity, therefore, you cannot change others or be changed. you are a true prince, you may be forgotten, but without you, none of us could go on.   what inner color are you?

       tales without end   i seem to have a habit of leaving the stories i write unfinished. here's one:  mama forgot to turn off the television last night. I found out when I woke up at exactly 2:45 a.m., as I always do—I set my phone clock at this hour every night—to get a glass of water. I didn’t immediately notice the TV on, the endless hissing and gray lines on the screen didn’t particularly catch my attention, until I opened the refrigerator and the tiny living room was illuminated by yellow light.  water serves its purpose each time. Water always has to be contained, you once said. But when rain falls, it falls down, not knowing an exact direction, I said, rather tentatively, to myself was more like it. I watched you fiddle with the tiny pieces of paper napkins you have earlier turned into paper boats, a swan, an airplane, a tulip. Droplets of sweat were running down your neck and I could see a pool of them settling in the hollows of your collar bone. I waited for your reply but you dropped the paper swan onto the bowl of miswa you didn’t finish. I took the bottle of Coke and poured what was remaining of it onto your swan.  then you left.

       same old, same old   i'm back at work. last sunday, kulas and i had another misadventure: a pseudo-carnapping incident right at the heart of tondo. as a result, my feet got really nasty blisters that i do hope wouldn't turn out as gangrenes. gross. the wounds might take a long time to heal; i might be diabetic, see. my mom is, so i probably am too. my sugar level had been tested before but i was okay then.  *****  do you ever get this feeling when you want to straighten up your life because so much has happened since the year started, and you feel this desire to clean the slate right in the middle of the year, when it's about to end soon?  i have it again. i'm glad though that it's happening at the right time and with the right person in my life. at least, when the next year kicks in, everything would hopefully settle into place.  *****  i spent the whole day in bed yesterday since i couldn't do anything much vertically. tere and i got to talk and i had somehow managed to tell her that life is okay, ours is, and that we have so many things to thank for.   *****  i'm at peace now. i got to check bok's blog.  i thank God that she is now moving on. we both deserve to be happy.

       leaping into the void   some of my office-friends are into blogging now. yey! if only i could learn how to change the settings--templates, themes and what-have-you. i have been badgering borgy to teach me scripts. simple html codes lang ang alam ko.  funny, im so into blogging now when in fact, i was so against e-books. oh well. i welcome myself to the void.  or is it not, really?

      i didn't have to scroll down my blog to see that practically all my entries are about or for Kulas. that isn't a problem, really, right? hehe. that's basically the thing with blogging anyway: to write down what your heart speaks of, the chaos in your brain even.  kulas accompanied me to the bank earlier and i'm glad my friend has already deposited what she owed me. now i can have my coffee!  call me colonial but i simply love starbucks coffee and for a caffeine dependent like me, it's just what i've ever asked for. hmmm. i sound like a TV ad that sucks.

       In-transit   for Kulas   Again, one of our usual stops:  dinner at our favorite Thai restaurant  and coffee after.  You know so well how I like my evenings---full, quiet,  sometimes random, but always ending with a soft kiss.  You prod me to keep telling stories,   keep telling stories , while you drive: A hint of excitement in the slits of my eyes,   my China eyes , you always say,  And I went on with made-up tales, fictions of memories  that you listen to like I was an oracle,  spewing out your fortune  from my mouth, and a smile, a nod from you.  Again, one of our usual bickerings  in the middle of my stories while you drive:  Take a left there,keep right .  You would just smile, your hand taking mine  While you change gears, and speak:  love , of love--and smile  again.  You keep driving,  not watching out for street signs anymore, and I carry on with my stories:  you in the driver's seat, I beside you--- a simplified plot, most common,  yet a discovery at every avenue's turn: once my story ends, you tell me:  here now, you are home.   10 September 2003 12:18 p.m.

       this song was playing in my head when Kulas was in New York   "Mad About You"  by Sting  A stones's throw from Jerusalem I walked a lonely mile in the moonlight And though a million stars were shining My heart was lost on a distant planet That whirls around the April moon Whirling in an arc of sadness I'm lost without you I'm lost without you Though all the kingdoms turn to sand And fall into the sea I'm mad about you I'm mad about you  And from the dark secluded valleys I heard the ancient songs of sadness But every step I thought of you Every footstep only you And every star a grain of sand The leavings of a dried up ocean Tell me, how much longer? How much longer?  They say a city in the desert lies The vanity of an ancient king But the city lies in broken pieces Where the wind howls and the vultures sing These are the works of man This is the sun of our ambition It would make a prison of my life If you become another's wife With every prison blown to dust My enemies walk free I'm mad about you I'm mad about you  And I have never in my life Felt more alone than I do now Although I claim dominations over all I see It means nothing to me There are no victories In all our histories, without love  A stone's throw from Jerusalem A walked a lonely mile in the moonlight And though a million stars were shining My heart was lost on a distant planet That whirls around the April moon Whirling in an arc of sadness I'm lost without you I'm lost without you And though you hold the keys to ruin Of everything I see With every prison blown to dust, My enemies walk free Though all the kingdoms turn to sand And fall into the sea I'm mad about you I'm mad about you

       Afterthoughts    It’s silly how I try to find excuses To touch you Or try to find a reason To come near you— Anticipating the slightest feel Of your skin On mine; Imagining your breath Raising the tiny hairs At the back of my head, Sending me into wild reminiscences Of that night’s rained-on passion.  That morning found myself Uttering your name Again and again As you curled beside me While I lulled you to sleep.  Before you woke up, I prayed for a morning of rain To douse the tongues of fire That had slowly burnt All over me, through me, Blazing, Settling between my thighs, The thickness of flame Tickling my belly— And finally Resting On my mouth:  You have left blue butterflies Fluttering on my breasts.

       looking back	  On Dumaguete’s Shore: Homebound 				By Christine A. Ongpin            I will be leaving Dumaguete soon.  In a span of one year and a half, I have found a home in this city cradled by the sea.  To write about my stay here, my life here, would be like the writing of a poem: a gathering of memories, carefully choosing the right words to move into some higher form of experience; an elevation of the soul.  No word could ever be perfect, though.  I remember, one evening at the sea wall, when I asked a friend how to describe the sound of the waves.  When I asked that question, I knew there really was no answer.  I shall forever be left groping for those elusive words, as memories of Dumaguete shall transform themselves into waves, lapping at the shore of my mind.    Going to Silliman’s graduate school was a lame excuse.  I could have certainly gone to any of Manila’s universities.  Yet I had chosen to come to this strange place all by myself because I wanted to be far from the din of the city, the dizzying lights at night, the restlessness of the people.  And then again there was the sea.  I already had an idea of how it was like in Dumaguete even before I had set my foot here.  There were the innumerable stories of writers who have come and left with the same promise in their hearts: to return to this city again and again. And so in June of last year, I have found myself standing in the Sibulan airport with huge duffel bags and a lost look on my face.  As I waited patiently for my sundo, I looked around me and saw students—who I surmised—have spent their vacation in Manila, with their families and friends welcoming them back.  Dumaguete had a deep, strange way of welcoming me:  I surely did not feel at home; the sights and scent were altogether unfamiliar to me.  And the sound, the sound!  I could hear everybody speaking in a language I never knew, never thought I would be uttering too.  It was raining hard when I left Manila and I was surprised at the sunny morning that greeted me here.  It was as if Dumaguete was behind the change of seasons.  True enough, I soon discovered how perfect it is here.  The rains would fall only late at night until very early in the morning.  It was strange to hear that in some parts of the country, typhoons were on a rampage while here, the people are all clad in their most comfortable clothes; one would be drenched with sweat not with rain.  There was a time when it was drizzling and I brought with me my umbrella and my dorm mates laughed at me: “dili man mi mag-umbrella kung ga-taligsik”.  We don’t use the umbrella when it’s drizzling. One chance of drizzle that they get, they make sure it would be worth the experience.  It saddens me now that I have to talk about Dumaguete like I am already far from it and all the scenes are just playing on my mind. Nevertheless, I have to admit that this is my way of thanking Dumaguete, my way of paying homage.  Barely a month from now, I will be going home—but this is home to me now!  I have made my own life here; have directed my once too puny boat into a coast of strangeness.  Here, I have met sailors of my kind, and we have all sailed on together.  There’s Ayvi who is also a Thomasian; funny that it is only here that we have met when we were in fact, both Literature majors only that she was two years my senior. I know I am going to miss her.  We tell people that we are sisters except that her father is Japanese and mine is Chinese.  I have already said goodbye to her because I know I will have to soon. My meeting with Ayvi would perhaps speak of the magic of this city.  Strangers who come from the same place find each other standing along the same shore and often, they end up sitting on the sand sharing stories about where they have come from and where else they intend to go.   As for now, I do not want to miss even a single moment of running along the boulevard in the morning, with people who are strangers to each other.  The sea and the sun peeping somewhere across the island comfort us and send us forth through the entire day.  After my morning jog, I would go home and prepare myself for school where I have learned to redefine friendship, giving that word a completely new meaning because we do not share the same language.  I may not have been able to have a lot of friends here like I do in Manila but those few faces are the ones whose names I would always carry within me. Friendships are not difficult to build here.  I remember telling Kaye that Sillimanians share a beautiful tragedy: they come to Dumaguete from different areas of the country, meet friends, share lives together only to eventually part ways.   					                                                                                                 ****  Friday is fly day.  Going out on a Friday night is probably the highlight of the week, a simple pleasure that we all take part in. Our shotting sessions in El Amigo can never be forgotten.  It is a place frequented by students who seem to have one thing in common: the zest for life, the individuality, the soul. It is a favorite bar-restaurant among students of Silliman.  Murals of friends with arms entwined around each other’s backs are painted on its walls, depicting the place’s name. Reggae music is a trademark of El Am’s.  I had my very first dinner there and I was stunned at the prices of the food and drinks.  At that time, a barbeque plate cost only twenty-six pesos.  With fifty pesos in your wallet, you would already satisfy your gustatory craving and would still have something left for beer.  Conversations over bottles of beer usually vary.  At times, we would simply sit there, after having dinner at, say, Manang Siony’s and kid around, beer bottle in hand.  There would also be nights when the mood is serious as if we crave for some cosmic realization to dawn on us.  After our drinking session, we would usually go to the Boulevard to eat tempura—the Dumagueteños’ version of the quequiam.  A promenade along the Boulevard follows.  It’s amazing how people of all ages go out at night on weekends to simply sit on the sea wall; and by the looks on their faces, they are really having fun.  The City of Gentle People is what Dumaguete is.  One could roam the streets sans the worry of what one usually experiences in bigger cities.  The quaintness of the place adds to the bohemian magic of the people’s lifestyle.  Being a university town and a favorite among tourists, it is quite amazing to see so many young people in the streets.  Almost everybody knows everybody.  It’s not surprising when I’d walk into a café and would find tables occupied by friends; or while waiting for a pedicab, a friend driving a motorbike would invite you for a ride.  Some nights would find us heading to the beach, perhaps to drink or just talk. I recall the days when I was still staying in a dormitory inside the campus.  There is a strict curfew at nine-thirty in the evening and just minutes before it, students will be seen scurrying off to beat the time.  For us who still want to go on with whatever we were doing before the curfew—drinking perhaps— we would put bottles of iced cold beer and food in our backpacks.  After the nightly bed-check, one room would “sponsor”, that is, being the “venue” for the night.    	A few weeks ago, Ayvi, Karen, Eric, Mark, Rex and me went for a drive to the Escaño Beach—Dumaguete’s version of the CCP breakwaters.  We bought, what else, beer and food and packs of cigarettes and parked beside the seawall.  Mark had his car doors open and jazz music played softly from the radio station somewhere in Cebu.  The moon was up that night, illuminating the silky surface of the sea.  I could still hear Ayvi crying in awe as she pointed out to where the gentle light of the moon fell: they are here, the silver dolphins!  Indeed, the waves looked like silver dolphins playing, bobbing up and down, in time with the waves.  The tides were not yet up and Karen and I decided to wade. The water was cool and we shrieked in delight every time the waves came to the shore. We were like two little girls playing, unmindful of the gradual rising of the tide.  Karen kept giggling, reminding me not to stray too far; the corals and rocks might hurt my feet, she said.  Wanting to feel nothing but the softness of the sand in my toes, I waded farther into the deeper part of the sea.  Had they not called me back, I would have swam, clothes and all. Yet inasmuch as I love the sea, my fear of it is overwhelming.  In my head, it was the sea’s undertow that made me go back to the shore.  	Sundays in this gentle city are far more different in Manila.  All the shops downtown are closed, most of the food establishments included. The Dumagueteños’ notion of a family day is that they go to church in the morning probably, then have lunch together at home or at some restaurant that would be open for the day.  The Silliman campus would be deserted too except for some students who would opt to go to the library or take walks in the acacia-lined campus.  Ayvi and I have our own Sunday ritual.  No matter how busy and occupied we had been throughout the entire week, our Sundays would be for the two of us.  We begin our day with me picking her up at the Davao cottage, the faculty dormitory she is staying in, and would then walk to wherever we have chosen to have lunch.  Afterwards, we would see if one of us has to go to Lee Plaza, Dumaguete’s bigger department store, to buy some provisions we need.  If not, we would go for a walk along the Boulevard, sit down and talk over nilagang mais or dirty ice cream; at late, the conversation would be followed by silence, a comforting silence, and we would stare at the sea, and off to the island of Siquijor.  	At nights, we would often hear our names being called by our little friends who sell boiled peanuts, green mangoes and balut in the streets of Dumaguete. The smile on their faces tell us that work is not really work to them but a game made more exciting when we stop and talk to them.  It’s both funny and amusing how we try to speak each other’s language.  Ayvi and I being Tagalog, we talk to them in Cebuano; but since they know we are not from Negros, they speak to us in Tagalog. And so, there we are, trying to merge two completely different worlds, shared with stories and laughter.  One moment I would never forget is the night when Ayvi and I were at the Boulevard, passing time before we’d have dinner.  I had just finished shooting for a documentary I was working on and I still had my camera with me.  That was the first time little Franco came to us, a boy of seven, a plastic basket of peanuts, mangoes and chicharon in hand, a scarf tied around his head.  I remember how he had caught my attention.  A man was teaching him what to shout as he sells his goods, but he kept forgetting it.  Little Franco would always yell, “manî, chicharon, manî!” But his older friend would correct him, “dili, ingon ana! Manî, chicharon, mangga! Naa man ka’y gibaligya’g mangga, ayaw kalimti!” Apparently, Franco kept forgetting that he was also selling his mangoes.  Ayvi and I were amused but went on walking. Not long after, Franco approached us and asked if we wanted to buy from him.  Instinctively, I turned on my camera and started talking to him.  He seemed to have liked it, as he went on and on talking about himself, asking us questions, playing tricks and making faces as I take a footage of him.  Soon, Franco’s friends joined us, cavorting for a chance to be on video.  And then the most beautiful thing happened.  Franco and his friends jumped down the sea wall, as the tides were very low, and made a bonfire along the shore.  They shouted at Ayvi and me, dancing around the fire, laughing, pushing each other away so as not to be blocked away from my camera’s view.  It was perfect.  And before they let us go for the night, they made us promise to come back.              It’s time for me to go back to Manila. Days from now, I will start packing my things, returning them into the boxes they had come from when I first arrived here.  As always when I travel, the most important of my belongings are kept in my backpack.  Now I shall not only have the essentials—my wallet, my favorite book, photos, letters, the plane ticket—kept there; I shall have my backpack full of memories too.  These memories shall be my compass—directing me always, always, to where home is…  tintin!         New Page 1

       while browsing through my files,i discovered i wrote this several months ago. wow...    LAVENDER NIGHT   I try to drown out the drone of office chatter with Roberta Flack bellowing where is the love through my headphones, kick off my shoes and look at my table or whatever’s left of it: stacks of folders and papers, my good old computer, reports to be edited, a yellow Piglet mug, little stuffed animals on top of the computer monitor, more folders on the verge of collapse, diskettes and a bouquet of yellow aster. I can smell coffee brewing and outside the glass window, the blue sky is splashed with hues of orange. I reach out to draw the blinds but decided against it. Let yourself see how it looks like outside, I tell myself.   I do not have the desire to go home, go some place else, or just simply move. I look at the cubicle across mine and inside me I wish to see him sitting there, with that fervent look on his face as he stares at the computer. I often catch myself peeking at the window that overlooks the parking area but his car isn’t there still.    He’s not coming back.  I have lost him when I never really had him.

       Between-Living  Edith L. Tiempo  When we love a wanderer, We wait for footsteps That may, or may not, come: First the hours-the days- Then-years. Then, never. Yet always we do know Whereof we wait: The creaking gate The scraping on the steps And at the door the level gaze; For these we wait to know The roving one is home.  We boast of a green thumb And coax the stems to bloom: Hibiscus, santan, the wholesome Cabbage rose; and make ambitious room For gardenias, irises, and orchids, (Taking time to scour the aphids) And maybe, soon or late The flowers show; But always we do know Whereof we wait: The nectar and the odors, And the windblown blazing colors.  So it's the space between The wishing and the end That is the true unknown; The massive world's timekeeping And our own agile flow Never to blend.  And thus we care, And thus we live Not for the end (Since that is not unknown), It is the wait, creative Life and love in full; Unfinished, uncertain, unknown, Yet mocking the known end That comes sooner, Later, or not at all.

       valentine's   i got hooked on an HBO movie last night called "valentine's". the movie was stupid but it still managed to make me stick with it for two hours. it was a thriller and somehow it had my disbelief suspended! a Maupassantian trick that passed! hahaha. funny, how one could embellish rubbish with profundity, as if that particular movie was meant for the educated.   i won't give the synopsis anymore. basta, it was funny in that stupid, contrived, suspense thriller way.   i texted Kulas last night hoping i could make him catch up on the movie but he was already asleep. my Kulas is a sleep addict, see, he needs to sleep early and has to take naps after lunch. unlike me, i could live without some shut-eye for days if, and only if, i don't have to go to work everyday!  it's actually strange how i find myself waking up early in the morning, smiling---on weekends. i actually look forward to waking up when there's no work so i could work on the real stuff.  but what the heck, i have to keep biting the dust until tere graduates from school.  which is actually six months from now. happiness... : )  another edition of Tomas will be launched this afternoon. i have a poem published there. i will try to get copies later.  i am still broke but im ok. : )

       A is for… Ate: this is what I am—to my akong TJ, to my shobe Terenggoy, and to my pinsans whom I dearly love.   Akong:  A is for Akong. Akong is what we call my brother TJ. That’s a Chinese pet name for little boys. He is one of the pinakamakulit little boys I have ever known. When we were kids, I and my play mates always tried to avoid letting TJ know what we were up to because surely, he would just turn everything into a disaster! He’s maligalig. Couldn’t keep himself from toppling down things, our Nanay’s figurines, heck, he couldn’t even behave and try not hurt himself. He would always tease my friends and would always insist on being the policeman or the daddy when in fact, we were playing school-school!  When we grew up, he remained makulit and pestered our bunso, Tere. Yet Akong is one of the most wonderful men the world fortunately has.   Antukin:  I have been known to have the ability to sleep whenever, wherever. I once fell asleep while sitting on the foot of a staircase in a friend’s house. I fell asleep for probably two seconds while biting on a lanzones (which I was eating to keep me awake during a training seminar); fell asleep while taking pictures in an interview job…    B is for…    Brilliant:  my mind is brilliant—or so I’d like to belive. Hehe.   Betchay:  my mom’s close friends call her Betchay. Her full name though is Elizabeth Leonila. All my friends think Betchay is the coolest mom a girl could have. Of course, we’ve had fights but Mama is one-of-a-kind. She is perhaps the strongest woman I know. When Papa left us, she wept, mourned for a love lost, grieved for her children who lost a father, then pulled herself together and went on living…  To this day, Mama is now happy with a man who loves her, Big Kuya.    C is for…      Crush :  I had my first one when I was eleven. His name was Arjayson and I didn’t even know that was “it”.  I always looked forward to spending summer vacation at my grandparents’ farm in Bulacan because Arjayson lived in one of the my family’s apartments. He would climb aratiles trees and would always tease me I couldn’t climb a tree because I was a girl. He was my crush, my first crush though.  And isn’t it nice to have crushes from time to time? : )    Chips Ahoy !:  My favorite is Chips Ahoy! Chewy and Stripes. I don’t see these in the supermarkets nowadays but I remember the first time I laid my eyes on a big blue Chips Ahoy pack: I was all gluttonous and didn’t want to share the cookies with anyone. I kept them in my backpack, forgot about it and the Mickey Mice in the house ate `em up—including my bag (bored holes).    Chinoy :  A lot of people ask me “are you Chinese”? whenever they hear my surname. Yes and no. Yes because my Lolo Julio came from Macao and my Lola Mommy is from Shanghai, only that her mother was a Cebuana. My maternal grandparents has 50% Chinese lineage too. And no, I’m not Chinese because 1) I don’t use chopsticks 2) I have a fear of seeing Chinese Opera live 3) I cant count 1-10 in Mandarin or Fukkien 4) because I am simply not.

      It’s a lovely sunny day. Typhoon Onyok has passed and I just can’t wait for the coming of the amihan. In fact, there are a number of things I can’t seem to wait for: my birthday, Christmas, 5 p.m. today… it’s going to be a nice waiting I know. I am learning to be patient. : )

      even without Mudra's permission yet, i had already decided to post this. my writer-friends and co-fellows in this year's UP National Writers' Workshop had another blast last saturday in which i was unfortunately absent. anyhoo, here's Mudra's (brilliant fictionist Janet Villa) email account on playing Taboo:   We played Taboo til kingdom come -- you know that game where you're supposed to describe the word to your teammates but there are some terms that are taboo, terms that you cannot use. Here are snippets of our game:    Sem (trying to describe PLATINUM): This is better than gold! Rebecca (shouting): SEX!   U: This is what I'll never find! Gelo: LOVE!!! [Aba, it turns out, tama si Gelo! The word really was "love!" The boys got the point.]   U (describing SADDLE to his teammates): Assholder!! Assholder!! Assholder! His teammates: (confused, siyempre) Chair? U (getting more incensed and raising his palms to cup the air): Assholder!! Assholder!!   U (nagmamarunong, after Gelo found it difficult to describe SALMON): Dapat sinabi mo, Gelo, "Blank Rushdie." [O, di ba? Ang galing ng anak ko?]   U (describing FINGER): F**k you! F**k you! Gelo: Whaaa? U: This is what you use when you F**k you! F**k you!   Mudra (describing POEM): This is what Gelo writes! Eleanor: Poetry? Someone (I forgot who): Trash?  -----------------  you guys wont sue me for posting this here, no? i really wish i were with you. sigh.

      I have another one of those I-want-to-write-but-can’t-get-to-doing-it mode. I will perpetually be looking for a potion to rid me of my laziness. Oh, but I am not really lazy lazy,you know. When I work, I work well and hard.  Ay ambot . Basta I am  tamad  these days.  And in an effort to fight off this lazy streak, I will just go about this blogging business in such a way you readers would be wagging your tongues at me out of sheer boredom. Oh well.   Yesterday was fun. Kulas drove me to Roces Ave. where I transferred cars to join Nina and Sam. I had Keema with buttered rice, Sam had a Chelo Kabab and rolled her pita bread with grilled tomatoes and garlic sauce. Persian delight night. Nina just sat between us and stared at the wall while making kulit for questions.   Nina : come on now, ask me questions.  Me : armspowlkks izh kowpolkmorstern * im hungry and I don’t wanna talk *  Sam : sips her yogurt shake and rolls her eyes  Nina was craving for intelligent talk but Sam and I were too hungry to feed her with pieces of our minds.  I had to sweet-talk to my bladder all the way from QC to Intramuros. When we finally got to Starbucks, all the gallons of pee I was holding off had somehow given me vicious abdominal cramps. I would have gladly traded that pain for a root canal on a good tooth.  Dr. Sam made me pop two paracetamols and with the flick of Nina’s wand, I was enjoying my tall cup of hot cocoa.   Nina’s mauve cellophane-wrapped box of questions:   Nina : Are you ready to go?  Sam : as in die?  Tintin : (not realizing it was supposed to be a philosophical query) uh, can I finish my chocolate first please?  Sam laughs and wipes tears off the corner of her chinks.   Nina : noooooooo. As in go, “go”, you know?   Me : oh. blame Biogesic.  --------------------------------- ok ok. Those two might kill me with a nail clipper (as per my idea of a revengeful murder) so let me just say last evening was great: conversations that made heads turn to our table, two mosquito bites on my left arm, a missed episode of SATC, and two goodnight kisses. ok, ok. T’was great hanging out with you gays. As always. I mean it. Really.  ---------------------------------  tere texted me yesterday that a  luka-luka  attacked her. when i got home last night, she showed me her bruises.  wawa naman.

Our House, by the way, is the center for children's creativity i am putting up.   my brain has turned to mush, ladies and gentlemen. i want a new book, a new shirt and a new pair of sneakers to add to my collection of hundreds.   oh wait. you may want to check out my poem published in  urlLink  tinig .  ------------  this week has been really tough. friday, oh friday, how do i love thee?

      ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  while i was smoking by the office stairwell, thoughts of tatay came to me, like vague ribbons of smoke, at first; now trailing after me, insistent like a child's hand tugging at my skirt.  it's been three years since he passed away. he didn't say goodbye nor did we feel any inkling that he was leaving us. i don't think it was sudden though. i know he felt  it . i know he  knew . death is only sudden, unbidden to those who are left behind. i know. i know because nanay soon followed him. two deaths in barely one year. too soon, too painful.  such pain you will never get used to.   i have a big heart of scars. and love. the biggest part of it has tatay and nanay in it.   of course another death scares me.  one will never be able to prepare for it--for the loss of another hand to hold: not the countless in and out's in the hospital; not the gray years; nothing. there will be no warnings until it stares at you with cold, cold eyes.   what tatay and nanay had taught me with their passing is hope. immense hope:   for those who have gone ahead of us. and for those of us who are left behind.

          beautiful.   june 1889 (210 Kb); oil on canvas, 72 x 92 cm (29 x 36 1/4 in); from the museum of modern art, new york  urlLink webmuseum    the starry night  was completed near the mental asylum of saint-remy, 13 months before van gogh's death at the age of 37. vincent's mental instability is legend. he attempted to take paul gauguin's life and later committed himself to several asylums in hopes of an unrealized cure.   van gogh painted furiously and the starry night vibrates with rockets of burning yellow while planets gyrate like cartwheels. the hills quake and heave, yet the cosmic gold fireworks that swirl against the blue sky are somehow restful.  --------  my brushes and canvas on easel await.

      i am so unhappy. i feel so lousy even i wouldn't want to say hi to me. i can hear my brain cells screaming "enough alreaaaaaady!"  in addition to this (see, even the way I write is conspiring against me; darn those office memos), my lips sting from eating too much of tina's Pringles Pizza. Hey, lips, you are a part of my body, remember? If I refuse to eat, I would die. And if I die, Im taking you down with me. So lips, cooperate.  i am the pinoy  isaw  (pig intestines skewers) left too long on the grill. i've got flies all over me. doesn't that suck big time?  i wouldn't want to wax poetic or try to come up with a Kierkegaardian tenet as to why i am in this cosmic shithole. i am normally a  happy  person. people know that. my friends know that. even my enemies. haha.  i want to know when this  unhappiness  will go and claw its nails onto somebody else. i want to know because i want to be wearing my most fabulous outfit, killer heels, my juiciest lip gloss and a smug grin when unhappiness bids bye-bye...

       WARNING: christine not here yet.   i might as well congratulate you, baby; you have been chosen to be my first victim for today.  i am here among mortals although this time,i am not waiting for some prince to come and rescue me while i sing lines of that sweetie-cutesy song that made disney's bank account fat.but hey yes,id like to be a part of some world -- the certainty of whose world or what world is not clear, will never be so. i am quite sober now... that's the thing with relating to mortals: you develop the same manners of thinking, you talk over beer and chicharong bulaklak,you curse the wind for blowing towards your direction because the joint,the joint!is only a few centimeters from extinction,and then you talk again while staring at the moon,waiting for some goddamn moment of illumination that the conversation would somehow create some semblance of meaning to you.  my mind is like john coltrane's higways -- my mind is a black newly asphalted road with a stretch of yellow line in the middle. every now and then, car headlights would appear and tires skid fast,a head-on collision afterwards... to give you a more vivid not to mention morbid picture of how christine's mind looks like: imagine the aftermath of a collision between a dumptruck and a camper. the truck driver is a drunk, wife-beater who abuses his thirteen year old daughter whenever his wife spends the night at 7-11. meanwhile,the wrecked camper carried a family going to a vacation -- dad's a neurosurgeon, mom's a closet-lesbian; and young lily keeps a razor in her jeans pocket, she's planning to do IT now, finally (dad & mom look happy) because her breasts are too small... now after the car crash,police mobile cars are everywhere... and the sound -- listen to the officer's report: "casualties-4,total wreckage,no need for paramedics,over." sound of static on the hand-held radio...   got the picture?

      so how are you supposed to feel when you’re working on a rainy Sunday afternoon?  dream of bumming around—topless—like   she   does; think of the beach, good books, coffee, conversations, sting, cinnamon rolls, puppies, white cotton sheets, babies, saxophone notes in a new york bar, the scent of his cologne on his collar…  what else can you do but dream dream dream. and i am here,  ani difranco  keeping me sane, singing to me  she is trying to evolve she's just trying to evolve she’s trying trying to evolve...

      i made myself a cup of coffee. (i like it black with a teaspoon of sugar.  i like the purity of things). the hot liquid first touched my lips with surprise, then i felt my tongue scalding, a singe-path forming down my throat.  instead of me feeling the sting, the pain, i uttered your name.  with the syllables coming out, my tongue barely touching the roof of my mouth as i pronounce your name, i closed my eyes and again felt that tingling sensation first in my mouth, my tongue, my throat, traveling down my body… down, down, down, and i imagined you sucking out the sharp pain of burning in my tongue, and i gave in to the feel of it, shivering, burning all the more…  and again i take a sip, awakening my senses fully, this time my body craves for more to sustain it.  a deep, aching pang crawls through me, the caffeine surges up, insistent, demanding.  like the touch of a hand barely touching the skin, my skin, sending me into madness.  with my mouth half-open, the softness of my dress seems to be touching me like a hand; i feel everything touching me like a hand… your hand. and once more, i burn with urgency, rendering me breathless… my mouth half-open, waiting for a kiss.

       A Kind of Burning  (Ophelia Dimalanta)  it is perhaps because one way or the other we keep this distance  closeness will tug as apart in many directions in absolute din how we love the same tirvial pursuits and insignificant gewgaws spoken or inert claw at the same straws pore over the same jigsaws trying to make heads or tails you take the edges i take the center keeping fancy guard loving beyond what is there you sling at the stars i bedeck the weeds straining in song or profanities towards some fabled meeting apart from what dreams read and suns dismantle we have been all the hapless lovers in this wayward world in almost all kinds of ways except we never really meet but for this kind of burning.

       im turning 25 next month and these guys were doing it already....   Things Other People Accomplished When They Were Your Age  Via museumofconceptualart.com   At age 25:  The future mythologist Joseph Campbell decided to move to Woodstock to read the classics for five years, nine hours a day. Living on very little, he would make himself readily available as a dinner guest.  Orson Welles coscripted, directed, and starred in Citizen Kane.  By this age, Charles Chaplin had appeared in 35 films.  P. T. Barnum bought a "160-year-old" slave woman and began a career in show business.  Janis Joplin made her first recording, "Cheap Thrills," which grossed over a million dollars within a few months.   Chris Burden created "Painting Shoot," which involved the artist being shot in the left arm by a friend.  Charles Lindbergh became the first person to fly alone across the Atlantic, thus winning a $25,000 prize.  Fayette, N.Y. farmhand Joseph Smith founded the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. He claimed he translated the Book of Mormon from some golden tablets revealed to him by the angel Moroni.  Bavarian painter Aloys Senefelder invented the lithograph.  French engineer Benoit Fourneyron invented the first waterwheel turbine.  Sarah Bernhardt scored her first triumph, being asked to repeat her theatrical performance before Napoleon III.  Physician Roger Bannister broke the four minute mile. As he collapsed unconscious into the arms of his trainer, the loudspeaker announced, "The time was three..." The uproar of the fans drowned out the rest of the announcement.  -----  i think im having a quarter-life crisis. i still want to do so many things. and i guess i better get my gorgeous butt off to working on these things instead of just talking about it.  -----  Darn. My right eye was itchy so I checked it out in the mirror. Man, I think I look like a monkey.

      im super tired and i still have tons to do. i had a meeting at Museo Pambata this morning and as always, it was more fun than work. discussion with the Programs people Des, Liza and Noreen was both enriching and exciting. we were at the resource center and i could see kids running about the playground outside. some would press their faces on the glass walls of the center and smile at us--wet lips pressed on glass.  i managed to finalize things with them despite my catatonic state. i guess nights of sleeping late are taking their toll now. i slept really heavily last night and still i woke up late this morning---9 am.   i walked to Lami for lunch but the place was full so went to Forest Grill instead, where Kulas joined me. Im so grateful for Kulas' help. He went with me to the furniture shop where we placed an order for the book cart for Museo.   back here at work, phone calls are endless and  i have to go to Powerbooks to later to check out the titles we will be purchasing for the event.   im dying for a smoke and cup of brewed coffee but im trying to cut down so i'll defer ingesting my poisons for as long as i can.  -----------  went to gets' place last night with dhey, joan and sharon. talked about dhey's love problems and gets' own. we also got to plan for our baguio trip next month.  -----------  because i am too busy with work, i can't seem to bring myself to worry about what tere texted me last night. she's in trouble with one of her classes and it means there's a possibility she wouldn't be able to graduate come March 2004.   i dont know. im too tired to think about it.

      now i can see the light. at least, arrangements for the launch with Museo Pambata will be finalized. i have a meeting with them tomorrow and i hope things would have more direction by then. procrastination is always my sin, i confess. i work better in pressure, see. then again, i always wonder if things  would  really be easier if i try to sit and work on them way before deadlines.   i had a meeting with Xtine of AIM and tina this morning. i admire Xtine's good head on program planning and development. and when she asked me what the Campaign's vision is (that would be mine,too), i told her i've somehow become disillusioned.  and it's true. i just think of the kids who would be benefitting from the Campaign, and perhaps saving our seas wouldn't be that hard after all...  ----------  it's always delightful to get to work and have a cup of starbucks coffee on your desk. thanks, honey.  ----------  i think kulas and i are developing the same brain waves. this morning while preparing for work, i said to myself that i bet my phone would ring in a few seconds. only the humming of the aircon in my room and my nosiy head can be heard, when after ten seconds or so, my phone did ring. and it was kulas.  hanep pare.

       glorious friday morning  i dont know what it is about this morning that found me smiling; a light, calm, even happy feeling inside. i am Amelie, basking in an unnamed state of bliss both beautiful and pure. i don't even catch myself suspicious of some conspiracy the cosmos is setting up for me. this is good. there are so many things to do and i like it.  thank you, universe.thank you, God.        i love you, terenggoy   dear tere,  it's almost your birthday. last night when i got home, the lights were already off and you were deeply ensconced in your pillows and sheets. as usual, i tiptoed my way about the room because you hate it when your sleep gets disturbed even by the tiniest of my movement. i guess you heard the ruffling of the plastic bag i brought inside and you woke up, feigning annoyance but i knew,really, that you wanted to know what was inside that bag. i told you  this and you didn't try to hide it, we laughed. oh i know you very well, tere.  you are my baby. i dont exactly remember how it was when you were still in Mama's womb. i was a baby myself then. i didn't care about you; i even hated you because you kept making Mama's trips to the hospital more frequent than when she was carrying TJ. i hated you because i thought Papa wanted to leave us because he didn't like you coming. and i hated you  because Papa did leave us and the money was never enough after he left and after you came.  oh but Tj loved you. he kept asking if he could play with you when you get home. he kept squealing everytime your little fingers would curl around his. he beamed when Mama told him he would from then on be  kuya . everyone thought you were very pretty. they kept taking your pictures. Tatay even bought you a dress for your first birthday party and Nanay always slept with you tucked beside her. you had the softest curly hair and the cutest dimple, you know. and how you could dance! you were very pretty, i have to admit.  i took care of you and Tj. Mama said i am your  ate  but you didn't really like me then. we would always fight over the silliest of things; you always wanted to have my dolls, my roller skates,even my lunch box. soon enough, Tj, you and i would be screaming at each other but at nights, we would still end up with our i love you's and kisses. but it was you who always got to sleep beside Mama because you were the baby.  do you remember that we used to call you  baho ? you didn't like taking a bath, combing your hair or brushing your teeth. all you wanted was to play. and you did just that by yourself, talking to yourself, being all the characters in whatever scenario was in your little mind then.   i don't know how it happened,how i've become the Most Important Person in your life as you now claim. i hated you, see. but now, everything that i work for is for you, because of you.  people marvel at our closeness. they say it's a wonder how sisters can be really good friends. oh, you are my best friend, tere. nobody knows my heart and my mind like you do.   i know that you sometimes feel "alone" because a number of persons dear to you have gone: some to a place better than this world, some to seek happiness, and some just simply left. but i will stay. remember what i told you once? you yourself will go and live your life but i shall stay.   i'll be the proudest  ate  in the CHS Auditorium when you graduate in March. i'll be prouder than any mother or father there is. God gave you to me and i'm so thankful for that.  happy birthday.  love,  achi

      yesterday morning was great in a laidback, Christmasy way. after breakfast, kulas and i headed for Morato for an early caffeine fix. there was a sample planner on display at the Starbucks counter. it was the kind i've been looking for: thick, a lot of space for notes, spiral bound and the paper smelled great (or perhaps it was just the coffee's aroma.teehee)!   "miss,  magkano `to ?" (miss, how much is this?)  the "miss" said it wasn't for sale and she handed me a coupon instead.  "have all the items stamped before December 31 and you can get this planner and a lot more goodies", she said smiling.  i looked at the coupon and well, i have to order 60 varieties of coffee before Dec.31 to have that damn planner!  then kulas blurted out a bright idea. "honey, let's just use any of your little cousins or my  pamangkins . let's make a kid go around Starbucks and approach everyone. people will get  awa  to her  kasi  she'll go around saying 'please let me get the stamp for your coffee because my dad (or mom or my pet platypus or whatever) wants this for a gift..'   oh, well. i might just do that.   i want that notebook plannerrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr.  -----------------------  after our lunch of braised beef and spring rolls, i had a haircut at the hip Britannico salon while kulas went for a car wash. met with nandy and kent for badminton and had authentic Chinese dumplings at Wan Chai.   another kulasspeak: "honey,  ako lang ang 'foreigner' dito ah " referring to every chink in the place; me, Nandy and Kent included.  ------------------------  coffee and a round of beer at Cafe Breton after. i'm amazed at how kulas' friends and i relate with each other.  ang galing-galing , i dont feel any so-called generation gap at all.   ------------------------  im sorry, i think i've already used up today's limit for dashes as borders. i have a headache the size of Asia, i've got the sniffles, and i have to beat the Makati traffic at 2pm for a meeting later. my throat feels like i've swallowed too many calamansi seeds without the juice.  i want to laugh. as in really laugh, the kind that makes your sides hurt and your eyes well up with tears. so if laughter really is the best medicine, im in dire need of it right now.  somebody work your magic on me please.

       hanging up   i'm going through a weird phase of detachment these days. i'm supposed to meet up with my college barkada and some classmates tonight in Timog but i've decided not to go. jep has been trying to reach me since last week but i never took his calls nor replied to his emails. im sure they'd get to read this so no, i won't come up with some lame excuse about not joining them tonight.   this detachment from friends started on my birthday. there was somehow a display of insensitivity on the part of my high school girlfriends, that i tried to shrug off only to realize that it is now making an effect on me. but i digress.  i have only one question: what is really our purpose for getting together after all these years?  jep's email announced that tonight was supposed to be the celebration of our birthdays--mine,malou's,eric's, pam's and a couple of our classmates. the thing is, we are reduced to the usual "inuman" and friendly chatter whenever we are together. do we really care about our respective lives at all? it is not enough to ask "o, san ka ngayon?", or "sino'ng boy/girlfriend mo?" we used to be more than that.   my friends are very important to me,see. however i think it's time for me to think about where these friendships are leading,and how, in the first place, did we all call each other friends.  ---------------------------  you might think that i clearly have issues, but come on, it's better this way than sitting there, guzzling bottle after bottle of beer,and wondering where that "something that all brought us together" went.  it wasn't the Philo classes, the tambays at Tinoko, the dinners at Almer's, the nights at Pam or Eric's rooms--- there was more and i just can't find it now.  --------------------------  i just hate to admit it in the plainest and mushiest words.

       wednesday woes   pierre and i are as different as fingerprints. morning and night. north and south. lifetimes and lifestyles. sometimes these differences hurt us but almost always, he unknowingly blames it on me and it hurts me all the more because  i try.   there are moments when i can not seem to get through him. to him, my actions, words and feelings are all contradictions and he is never convinced that i love and appreciate him.  i love him for everything that he is and i have long stopped asking why.  i wish this man who vows to love me would spare me some of the faith he has in God. too much to ask? faith needs no expalantion and neither does love.   ------------------------------------   a Sillimanian mind   ok, enough of my cheesiness.   this morning, tere asked me if i could give her some of my notebooks so she wouldn't have to buy anymore. my notebooks?  my notebooks  i have labeled the box containing my precious notebooks "please prioritize in case of fire"--is she kidding? oh but of course, i did give her two. that's too much already.  while looking for notebooks i would have the heart to part with, i stumbled upon an old test paper of one of my best students in Silliman. Lee Vincent was a freshman engineering student at that time. he didn't talk much in class (it was an Expository Writing). he went to my classes in grungy shirts, torn jeans and Chuck Taylors and would just stare ahead as if i weren't making any sense. for a while there i really thought i wasn't making any semblance of sense with the way i taught. most of his classmates would turn in late papers which were eventually returned to them bleeding: the grammatical errors and incoherence made me doubt my worth as a teacher.  however, Lee was different. i would always sort his paper from the lot and read it last, and always, his paper would be on the top of the pile after i finished checking them. he was brilliant.   i kept his Final Exam paper and i am posting excerpts from it---with the hope that Lee wouldn't sue me. i am just so proud of this kid, and i used to tell him that through my comments on his papers and through my emails after i left Dumaguete.   Lee, i hope you're still writing. you're one bright thing, you know that.   ----------------------  on descriptive/narrative devices   a man started to speak   A gaunt man with the shadows of his past began to feel the rage burn from within his stomach, rising upwards, till it gripped his voice like a microphone, weilding like a fistful of steel at a past never forgotten.   the crowd began to move   All stepped forward, like a southern fist rising through the jungle mist, taking the first step which they know will be the first move to taking back what is theirs from the rubble of rich empires...  ------------------------   and another one   "...then it hit me. i felt like i was there, in that Mexican pasture, being herded off to that place they call "free"...do you know what that felt like? that felt like a Jew being trussed up like a ham on a trainload of his own blood and kin, herded on by Nazi pigs. sweat and vomit are thrown in that congested pig pen, prayers suffocated by the stench of dying, flesh and urine. some die. and they're the lucky ones...."  ----------------------------------------  students like Lee, students who think, who have things to say, passion and angst even, are the ones who make me want to teach all my life.  in teaching, what matters is that you make your students think and pose questions and challenge the world because a mind as impressionable as theirs make it even richer. it makes language and experiences beautiful and terrifying at the same time.

       veronica   veronica has been having weird dreams lately. last night, she dreamt of chasing a girl in shorts and a tiny white tee around the house. she couldn't see the girl's face but veronica knew who she was as in the case of all dreams: faceless people have names. you'd hear somebody calling your name and you turn to where the voice is coming from, you'd see no one but you would know what to say; you would dream of making love, of raking your nails upon somebody's arched back, you wouldn't see his face, but you would know it when you cry in ecstasy.   she tried to tell him about her dreams but he was in such a hurry to drop her off to the supermarket.  mom is allergic to olives, remember . his words faded away as veronica closed the car door behind her. perhaps i should try to stop thinking about my dreams, they're just dreams , she told herself while pushing the cart of groceries,its wheels creaking, reminding her of some door that wouldn't close no matter how she tried to shut it-- or was it just in some dream?  veronica joined in the queue to the cashier. a mother trying to make her baby stop crying stared down at her cart. when it was veronica's turn to pay, she unloaded her stuff on the counter: there was nothing but olives, hundreds of them in clear plastic wrappers.  -------------------         urlLink  happy 75th birthday, mickey!      Mickey Mouse Celebrates 75th Birthday VOA News 18 Nov 2003, 21:50 UTC      Mickey Mouse turns 75-years-old Tuesday, and is still a beloved international celebrity, though he speaks in a squeaky voice, has basketball-sized ears and started life as a rat.

       this language   we say we love and when asked why or how, we try not to swallow our own tongues and choke on words disguised as reasons. we hope not to break promises clasped between fingers entwined, between the space of a kiss separated by our breaths.  we say we love and we feel it, chemical. but this yearning to define consumes us more than bodies taking in each other, like wildfire spreading too soon onto dry grass, leaving only parched earth and that burnt smell.  we know not the language of what we claim we feel but this we profess: we love, giving all things beautiful; we love like we live and that is enough.

       SUDDEN PUNCTUATIONS  Story # 1  Fritzie works for Chocolates Limited where she creates and designs chocolate bar wrappers, and she's actually added on five pounds from sampling different chocolate bars by their competitors—not that she really craves for them, it's just that she sometimes runs out of ideas for a new candy wrapper and so she regularly checks out the vending machine at the ground floor for new chocolate bars; but she has spent all her pennies on those bars and nothing seems to be new anymore and so it’s time to go to 7-11 down the corner of Buendia, where, as always, the counter-girl amazes her: Andie her nameplate says, and Andie would always be busy attending to bitchy and snotty yuppies wanting to have the infamous Slurpee and Knorr Cup Noodles for a taste of urban fast-lunch-break: Fritzie never chooses to indulge on these monosodium-glutamate-enhanced gustatory delights for fear of growing an extra arm or intestine—or so her Tita Lyn says—Fritzie goes through the rows in the small store, one by one, passing by the toiletries section where she enjoys the waft of assorted soaps and shampoos and deodorants, the canned goods section where she tries to catch an expired can of corned beef or meatloaf or sardines, which she would buy, open at home, and then return to the store, claiming that the item she got from that store is already expired, and then she would sue the store, the manager, and probably the canned food manufacturer—but never Andie, it’s just her job—and then she wouldn’t have to work for Chocolates Limited because she’d go for an amicable settlement and be rich, she’d put up her own art gallery where her “real” works of art will be, but then it’s absurd because perhaps the manager would just accuse her of stupidity for not checking out the expiry date and then she’d be humiliated in front of Andie, and Andie would just snicker behind the cash register and she would never notice that Fritzie has been wearing the same baseball cap as Andie’s—but Andie has never even looked Fritzie in the eye but she doesn’t lose hope, even if it takes her twenty-thousand chocolate bars and she will have to work for Chocolates Limited all her life, so long as she has a reason to go back to that 7-11 store along Buendia, again and again—even if she loses all her teeth from cavities, maybe, just maybe, Andie would one day ask Fritzie what she does with all those candy bars and how come, how come Fritzie is wearing the same baseball cap backwards too…   Story #2  Fritzie puts on her headphones and she sits up as Young Angry New Yorkers blares because we need to live so we curse at the sun while she toys with her yellow pencil with Ted and Rabi on it, it’s the type that has spare leads which you insert at the bottom so that you wouldn’t have to use a sharpener—it’s the Bensia type, except that it’s not a Bensia—and she remembers her kindergarten days when she’d beg her Tita Lyn to buy her a Bensia because every kid in K1- Mabini has a Bensia and Fritzie did not; a message flashes on her computer screen, and she looks behind her to check if nobody was looking before she opens the message box: it was from this African girl she met at the chat room—her name was Woliya and she wants Fritzie to install a web cam so they could see each other while chatting, but of course Fritzie cannot do that, at least not until she quits working for Chocolates Limited, and then she remembers she has to turn in a new logo design for this chocolate bar with caramel and nuts and peaches called Peachie’s Pack, Fritzie doesn’t know, really, why on earth Peachie’s Pack is called Peachie’s Pack, and she doesn’t think kids would love them—it’s the kind you’d say as lasang tanga—and for one thing, 7-11 Buendia doesn’t sell that stuff, maybe Andie the counter-girl gets to sample what chocolate bars they’d sell, and maybe Andie wouldn’t like Peachie’s Pack, and so, even if Fritzie came up with a new design for Peachie’s Pack wrap, 7-11 Buendia still wouldn’t sell it, and Fritzie wouldn’t have a reason to go buy that candy and tell Andie casually that Peachie’s Pack has a cool wrapper, and maybe, Andie would then see things Fritzie’s way…   Story #3  Fritzie prayed for soft, steady rain today so she could wear her new black trench coat and pink Chuck Taylors she bought from E-Bay as a treat for herself. Chocolates Limited won the account for Peachie’s Pack because of Fritzie’s design and so Cesar decided to give her a bonus for a job well done, which for Fritzie, was really nothing, it was just that: she was doing her job, and between the MRT rides to and from her office and the occasional cappuccino at Starbucks, Fritzie wouldn’t know what else to do, what to do better than contemplating on shampoo, light bulbs, condoms, greeting cards…

      i woke up this morning singing  roll over the ocean, roll over the sea, roll over the ocean and the deep blue sea...  in my head. it was only when i was brushing my teeth when i realized that i was actually singing it aloud. weird and funny, really. i remember learning it in preschool, hand gestures and all. of course i  liked  the song, specially before those St. Paul nuns kicked me out. good thing they did, though: i had more fun with the priests in my Catholic high school. teehee.  it's a lovely day. sunshine, no traffic, a bye-bye kiss from mama and tere, a "hi & bye" wag of Hugo's tail, a hurried bite of siopao. nice, nice, nice. no complications. smooth. simple.   that's how life ought to be.  kahit mahirap.   yep, i am happy. : )

          merry christmas!!! this was taken during our office christmas pasrty last tuesday. i hosted the party together with S, a colleague. well, we managed to make fun of people, made them make fun of us, and had fun, all in all. we all checked in the hotel after. see my smile here? if there's such a thing as afterglow, there's also beforeglow. hehe. *winks*  there seems to be no enough time for me to do everything i need to do before the holidays. last friday, kulas and i went shopping for presents. started at nine a.m. and finished at five p.m.! it was exhausting but fun : )  i amused kulas with my haggling skills.   can somebody let me know if a picture appears here,please?   i'll try to post something more substantial for your hungry minds later.   time space warp  ngayon din    of course this is the famous line from  Shaider  the Japanese series i grew up with. i wanted to be Annie because i honestly thought Shaider was so cute ( may he rest in peace) and i wanted him to be my boyfriend.  oh but anyway. it feels like im on a space warp: some people here in the office are playing songs on their radios. the volume is actually turned very low and as a result, it sounds, uhm, i dunno.  basta   it feels and sounds weird. im just tamad to describe it further. yun lang.  ah, i know na.  para akong nasa bahay ng kapitbahay  bah. figure it out.   kulas + tintin = kulas/tintin   i was supposed to have a meeting yesterday but i had to cancel due to PMS and laryngitis. later last night, kulas dropped by to pick up the gifts i wrapped. he brought pancit palabok and chocolate cake from Red Ribbon. while he spoon-fed me in my room, he said:  kulas: you look tired and your eyes look sleepy. siguro you went out last night noh  me: (rolls my eyes and gestures at the millions of wrapped gifts by the foot of my bed) hello...  kulas: siguro you read lots of books na naman  me: uhm... (pretends to swallow seed of calamansi)  kulas: quit staying up late at night. quit reading at night. you can be a morning person like me  me: wha?  kulas: well, we should always do things together. when you're up, i should be, too. dapat when people see us, they'll see us in us.   me: huh?  kulas: they'll see you in me, they'll see me in you  me: i think the former is ok but the latter?....  kulas: heh  hmmm... i love this man. very, very much.     i love you Alda's   beer, pizza and pasta again at Alda's. i like.

       what's on my mind now?   i have been feeling stressed these days. im here at work on a Saturday morning, when i'd rather be out, joining the throng of sweaty bodies in malls and  tiangges , basking in such commercial satisfaction. hell, what i would give to have an anxiety-free set of neurons: bills to pay, a seventy-thousand-peso account to liquidate, project proposals to review,edit,and approve, the warning digits of my bank account, clients who still wouldn't pay for the services i have long rendered and delivered--i swear i could go on and on but i wouldn't. ranting is really, really tiring.   i'll be off to davao tomorrow and will be there for a whole week. i'm thinking of taking off to singapore or hongkong from there (would that i could). god, i need to get out of this.    i'm gonna nail your ass,baby.   shitty,shitty. his ex called his mobile again this morning.. why 'again'? because she did just that last week -- same time, same day.    she   ought to be afraid. very afraid.    she   is definitely in trouble.    you've lost your spunk   yes, that's what a very good friend told me. i seem to have lost that  glow , according to her. and she is oh-so right.  for one, i have stopped doing some things i used to. i haven't been working on projects outside my day job, nor have i been actively scouting for them. i am also a little out of touch with friends who usually are my greatest stimuli for almost anything.  i need to feed my mind. it's devastatingly hungry, starving, drooling for some real thinking. books and good films won't suffice nowadays. i need to be  bad  ( just exactly what i mean by that is no cause for worry, honey). i need to be  back .  maybe i've gotten so spoiled and sheltered. i think it's time to hit the streets again, fearless and brazen. just follow what the shoe with a swoosh ad says.   urlLink  confessions of a shopaholic    so what. i need some entertainment.    smile, tintin, smile

      i know of a place that is actually a black hole i have consciously though grudgingly leapt into. it's like there are Dementors there--they suck all the happiness and cheerful thoughts out of you and you are dragged to misery, because they want you to be like them.  the only way to fight Dementors is to gather every happy feeling and thought out of your soul, no matter how difficult as they try to suffocate you by breathing in all the air there is in this cell, refuse to succumb to insanity, refuse to be prey.   life is funny: one moment you're skipping with delight, another and you're crawling like a lizard. as if you people didn't know this, no?  --------------------------  tere's birthday dinner at Pantalan was lovely. mama brought her Japanese boss and a colleague; tere invited her two best friends Arlene and She; Tj, Kulas and me. Kulas gave the most beautiful bouquet of flowers Tere has ever received in her life---tere's words. it was a bunch of mums and daisies in different colors, with a big sunflower in the middle.  kulas spoke with Sato in Nihonggo. kulas amused all of us with his linguistic wit. this man never ceases to amaze me.   i'll reserve my rants and raves for a later post.

      Halfway through the movie i was watching on tv, i wished i was watching it with you. I didn't even get to know the title. All I know was that it was about a woman pursuing what she loves, and about having a good heart..  Just like all beautiful things I see, hear or feel, I want to be with you as I live them.  We both haven't been smiling these days.  "We hurt ourselves too much."  But we cling to each other, not out of despair, but out of faith: faith in something better to come along, in beauty and in ourselves because we love after all.  I miss my smile, and yours, too.   6:15 pm 28 January 2004 home

      It's always good meeting up with Ayvi, my Japanese sister. Back in Silliman, we would tell poeple we were sisters except that I'm Chinese.  How's that again?  That's just it, we'd say; we're sisters.  We had cappuccinos at Figaro first and dinner at Fazoli's after. Stayed at Seattle's Best till they told us they were closing. We talked about our lives, as usual. The husband needs to work on his marketing to give the business a much-needed boost; be arrogant in maing more money. Isis, my two-year old inaanak says "chicken" whenever she sees the Equitable-PCI Bank logo. She also knows that it's "apple" on the Mac.  I told her my frustrations with writing and she has only one thing to tell me: write.   Write on a napkin, on a mint wrapper, the hem of your skirt, your palm, on neon Post-Its; write on scented pink stationeries, on a random page of the book you're surreptitiously reading in the ladies' room cubicle of your office; write on the envelope of your five-digit phone billing statement, write on your favorite spiral notebook, write, Tintin, just write.   ***   ayvi: bakit ba kailangang career-in ang pagsusulat? we dont write to live; we live to write!   ***   tintin: gusto ko s'yang saktan! (on describing  a woman from work who has annoying manners of speaking and facial expressions   ***   tintin: eh maka-mundo ako eh! bwahahaha! (retort to ayvi's statement on the issue of making money being a big deal)

       from the mouth of my babe   he said what i need is diligence. my laziness,according to him, is detrimental to any literary visions i have of myself. i just have to write, write,write, he said. if that's the way i want to live my life, i might as well die writing. and to do so, i must get on with it.  come to think of it, this has always been my problem. i have always been a butterfly when it comes to projects. i work hard,set my heart on things, get my heart broken and move on. as with my life, my relationships,my dreams and fears, i flutter, fly, thrive on whatever's good (even the bad) and move on. and so, i look for more.   i envy  urlLink naya . first, because i really like and admire her poetry. her metaphors range from the most common to the amazingly profound. her language mesmerizes me,too. i know for certain that when i read a poem of hers without her by-line, i would recognize that voice, resonating on the page,reaching my mind. and second, just like her, i wish i were teaching again.   i am writing this with a sigh.   and of course, there's  urlLink ian  whose works i would always read for sheer pleasure and to simply marvel at his craft. his fiction is comforting no matter what his subject is. there is,in his words, a quiet spectacle that unfolds before my eyes but it is always something calm and fluid that i allow myself to flow along his plots, his characters, his images. i specially love ian's stories on afternoons when my own despair to create swallows me whole like a dragon's open mouth...  then there's  urlLink pam . this girl simply amazes me.   and  urlLink dinah ? this woman has the most beautiful words and an equally beautiful mind.  there are other things to do and enjoy aside from writing. i love, i am loved, i laugh at myself, cry,weep, eat anything, hug people---there  are  a million other beautiful things i could make myself do.   but writing eludes me. and i was born to chase anything that runs away from me. chase it, grip its neck, shake it and when everything's done and still nothing else happens, i let it go.  i know when to admit defeat.

      i like the way i write my name. i dont know what handwriting analysts would say about my penmanship but i like it. they might reveal that my handstrokes are telltale signs of a suspected sex maniac or a serial killer on the loose or a fairy godmother moonlighting as a writer: ont thing i know is that the way i write speaks of character in black and white.

      i'll be gone for a few days for work. i find Gen San rather depressing probably because i'm such an incurable urbanite. while i love being outdoors, the thought of a mall or cafes being inaccessible to me makes me feel a little lost. we're going to Sarangani on thursday though so the trip would certainly be worth it.   on a different note, i wish i could do something to lift kulas' moods. troubles at work are getting to him really hard. i miss his smile. i miss his  kulit  self. now i wish i pursued my plans of taking up law so i could be his lawyer for this case. no other human being knows him the way i do. i know his soul. i would be the best person to defend this man to the world.   i have been putting off working on my plans for this year. i wish there were a pill to cure procrastination. oh well. those are all in my head and that's what matters,right?

       $$$    after we were informed that we wont be getting our salary on the 15th for some stupid reason, i have devised the following to make sure i'll get by. what's infuriating is that  we  have the money--and in dollars,too--so we aren't supposed to be penniless every payday; but since financial fuck-ups happen, it's time for my Chinese merchant lineage to surface.  1) i will join AXN's Fear Factor and win $50,000. ah, for the love of money.  2) i will rent a coffin and pretend to be dead so i'll get  abuloy  from people. of course im gonna need an assistant for this one. anyone?  3) i will offer massage services in the neighborhood.  4) i will rent a Videoke machine and rent it out to my neighbors and relatives. for a 3k capital, i'll get double in ROI. in 5peso coins, that is.   5) i will play billiards, bet and win--tooth and nail.  6) i will hold a garage sale. now this is more realistic and better for decluttering and feng shui stuff,too. but i want to be grand and dramatic so i wouldnt opt for this one.  7) i will write a schmaltzy Tagalog Romance Novel and my protagonists will be called Segofredo,Edwin and Lucy. Lucy will be a brilliant and conservative nympho.  8) i will sell my paintings.  9) #8 is unthinkable for now.  10) i will apply as Galema the lady with snakes on her head at the Paskong Pasiklab carnival in QC.     hmmm.money.

       i want to be a twig    i woke up this morning smelling a nasty world waiting for me. it's not enough that there's so much brouhaha at work these days--my body isn't doing its job,too. i feel like im pregnant (of course,i'm not),having that so-called morning sickness except that this one is bound to stay the whole day. it must be because of lack of sleep as kulas and i talked over the phone til about 2a.m. before i went to bed last night, or shall we say this morning, i realized that i'm having "real" problems and doing some "real" thinking now. this is serious. kulas never stays up late on the phone much less if there's work the following day. the thing is, it's that hellhole we were talking about.my apologies to anyone from the office who'd get to read this. we are just on different seats,so to speak. i hope we could get a really good lawyer.  nina and sam met up with me last night.i needed their comfort and they didnt think twice to go all the way from paranaque to meet me at morato. we had dinner then all drove to intramuros for coffee. when i asked nina how she is these days, she answered, "i'm a twig". i want to be a twig,too. it's just a matter of following one's heart. very very soon.  oh and i've paid for tere's tuition fee yesterday and i realized that was the last i will have to pay ever. knock on wood. thank you, God. now if one would ask me what's the best gift i ever gave to somebody, the answer would surely be the college education of my sister.i feel blessed.

        ku-las re-sign ku-las re-sign    right now, the only significant thing that needs considerable thinking is whether kulas should quit his job or not. i am greatly resolute that he should choose the former and that he must do it ASAP. in fact,i want him to do it now. as in today. ok, end of January will do.  i feel that he is getting alarmingly stressed out by work.there is a bunch of people who are making such huge ruckus, trying to make his life miserable. government bureaucracy and people's innate selfishness are the keywords. everyone also has their own agenda.  if he wouldnt get out of this system really soon, i swear i'll take the matter to the streets and make welga. i need help making the placards with "kulas resign" on them.   i just dont want him to waste his energies on something that's been troubling him. i want laughlines on his face, not wrinkles caused by constant agitation. i need him with me for the next 60 years.

       ME  by Paula Cole   I am not the person who is singing  I am the silent one inside  I am not the one who laughs at people's jokes I just pacify their egos  I am not my house, my car, my songs  They are only just stops along my way  I am like the winter  I'm a dark cold female  With a golden ring of wisdom in my cave  And it is me who is my enemy  Me who beats me up  Me who makes the monsters  Me who strips my confidence   I am carrying my voice  I am carrying my heart  I am carrying my rhythmn  I am carrying my prayers  But you can't kill my spirit  It's soaring and it's strong  Like a mountain  I'll go on and on  But when my wings are folded  The brightly colored moth  Blends into the dirt into the ground   And it's me who's too weak  And it's me who's too shy  To ask for the thing i love  And it's me who's too weak  And it's me who's too shy  To ask for the thing i love  That I love   I am walking on the bridge  I am over the water  And I'm scared as hell  But I know there's something better  Yes I know there's something  Yes I know, i know, yes i know   That I love  But it's me  And it's me  But it's me    for the roses, the dogs who eat dogs; for the screams in my head, the bruises on my arms; for love, kulas, family and friends    rainbows    when was the last time i saw a rainbow?   some cosmic intervention. just as i was about to write that we always need to have a fresh look at things, tins stretches her hand in front of me, and on her open palm were two white flat-faced marble stones. i chose one and the word "marvel" was written on it. the other stone has "celebrate" on.   it was the perfect stone to keep these days.   hang on   for you   it will be alright. i know you are worried about the days to come but fear no more. i wear hope like garlands of lilies upon my hair.

       of paperweights, pigs and dolphins   back to work. i want to start the year right and decided to do it first off by wearing a gray Scottish plaid skirt and a pink top today. i arrived in the office with my desk devoid of the usual clutter of papers and i am definitely not used to it. i was actually at a loss-- i couldnt remember what i was working on before i left for the holidays. i know one great way to solve this: re-clutter my table.  aside from my PC and speakers, there are four other stuff sitting on my desk: a blue star and blue moon paperweights, a pink rubber pig whose eyes pop out when you give its tummy a squeeze, and a blue dolphin atop a white swirl. they look at me quietly and i ask myself where they come from. i look at the files precariously perched on the shelves above me and i think i have accumulated too many garbage that i refuse to throw out.   i have 360 days more ahead of me (it's a leap year, i think). with the way things happen everyday, 365 days could feel like, well, 365 long days, or just a year that has wonderfully passed by.   withdrawal syndrome   i've quit smoking for almost a month already. i went through the usual irritability and craving bouts, salivating like i was some mad dog, and the restlessness that wouldn't go away. aside from that, i feel perfectly great.  my vanity has actually won over this oral fixation. teehee. and yep, we're planning to have babies soon. five of them. what a joy.   thinking Manhattan   i feel so strongly that i could do whatever i want and go wherever i want to. that's what i will be doing soon. kulas and i, that is.

       War-freak Tintin   I punched a 13-year old boy when I was 12.  I, my brother and sister along with other kids in the neighborhood were playing kickball one summer afternoon. I was the captain of my team,and no wonder, I could kick a mean ball and break those bulbs hanging above the street. Neighbors would complain to my Tatay that I broke yet another bulb or shattered a window because  "nag-kickball na naman ho ang apo n'yo Mang Pepe"   ("your granddaughter played kickball again, Mang Pepe"). Some parents would even threathen to file a formal complaint in the Barangay. I was good, what the heck. I thought their kids urged them to report on me so no one could beat them anymore. But I digress.  This 13-year old SOB named PJ was mocking my brother because he couldn't join us play that day. MY bro was having an asthma attack. PJ called him names; "lampa"  "ban-ban" (wimp). PJ even kept shoving my brother away.  Me: "Oi, PJ tigilan mo yang kapatid ko!" (Hey,bastard, leave my brother alone!)  PJ: "Eh lampa naman talaga `to eh! (He's a wimp,really)" then threw the red plastic ball on my face  I tasted blood on my lips, curled my right palm into a fist, and calmly tapped PJ's shoulder.  Me: "PJ..."  as he turned around, I punched him on the nose, remembering Popeye and the way he would cream Brutus(Bluto?).  Well, I got grounded for a week and my Tatay had to pay for PJ's medical bill. He, er, I broke his nose.   But I was damn proud. Oh and I uttered the first expletive of my life then. Saying "pu@%!na ka,wag mong aanuhin kapatid ko!" (you,motherfckr,you! Never mess up with my brother!) was divine.   Fast-forward War-freak Tintin    I took a cab to work today. I told the driver to pass through a mall near my place so we could take the short cut. Two security guards were on their posts along the gate entrance doing the routine check of vehicles passing by. The guard on the left side, signalled "go", meaning they wouldn't check our cab anymore. But the guard on the right, kicked the cab's rear and shouted "hoy, come back!"  The cab driver explained the other guard told us to go ahead that's why we stopped. He would have willingly pulled over and opened his trunk had he been told to do so.  But this wise-ass guard started to harass the poor driver, shoving him off, cursing at him. I didn't mind him at first.  But when this frigging guard looked inside the cab and pointed at me, I couldn't take it anymore. I got off.  Me: " ano bang problema mo, ha? why are you harrassing my driver ?"  take note the possessive pronoun.hehe.  Guard:" anong harrass? eh,gago yan eh"  Me; " Mama, sinabihan kami nung kasama mo na tumuloy na kaya di kami huminto. Tapos sisipain mo `tong sasakyan at mumurahin mo sya? Anong problema mo?"  (Mister,your colleague told us to go ahead that's why we didnt stop then you kicked the cab and began verbally abusing him!)  Guard:" eh,bakit ba,ikaw ba drayber?"  (why,are you the driver?)  Me:" eh,luku-luko ka pala eh. Hindi nga ako ang driver pero di ka dapat bastos. Ang tanda na nga nyang driver eh!" (you're crazy. I know I'm not the driver. You're an asshole who doesnt know the meaning of the word respect)  Guard: walks away  Me: pulls his arm to me  " hoy,inabala mo na rin naman ako. wag kang bastos ha !"   Guard: moves his hand to show the gun on his belt  Me: reads his name badge  "Mr. Agdao,  wag kang mambabastos sa susunod . I live near this mall and you bet Im coming back. I hope not to see you here by then."  By this time, there were a lot of onlookers already,and the queue of vehicles was already spilling.   When I got back to the cab, the  manong  driver said, " ang tapang nyo pala, Ma'am"   I was seething, fuming mad. But I know I won.  Ok,ok. I got scared too. A little. hehe. He could have shot me. But what the heck, I know I scared the shit out of him,too.  Nice Friday payday. Except that we aren't getting paid again.  But you know what? I feel fine, baby.

      So I was right. At 25, you can only hope to be living off a trust fund some generous grand-aunt has left for you; or that you have a 5-digit paying job--never mind if you hate it. Thing is, there's no grandaunt, no great-paying job. There is only you.  I am going to be a barista.   I can control my life, damn it.   Yesterday, I had a meeting with two production outfits bidding to win an account with us to stage a concert we're funding. Guess who came with the second group?  Ok, to give you an idea, it's going to be a concert for a cause, its theme centering on saving the environment, the seas in particular.   Yep, yep, Joey Ayala came with his guitar! He performed the pieces he would sing during the concert and man, was he amazing. If there's one thing I frowned about was his comment that I look like a pretty highschooler. My retort was equally embarrassing. I blurted "but I'm getting married next year!" Joey laughed and reached for my hand. Hehe. I didn't know where that came from.  If I wrote this entry yesterday, it would have sounded what it's really supposed to be. But not today.  I went home from St. Luke's late last night. Kulas' mom needs Type O blood for her heart bypass this morning and I wanted to donate but didn't get to because I'm underweight. I texted friends to pass the message to other people because we had a 10 p.m. deadline; also had to fetch an officemate who was willing to donate.  Kaso lang  he had high blood pressure.  When I got home at past midnight, I was sorry that I wasn't able to talk to my Tita who lives with us in my grandparents' home. She might have lung cancer. I'm obsessing about learning about the disease so I can help her as much as I can. We need prayers now. My cousins need her more than anyone else. I hope that her biopsy results would be ok. Waiting for Friday.  And this morning we had an emergency meeting. We all might get laid off. Fuck the government. Our  urlLink office  has its own funds but of course where money is involved, a mess ensues.   Ang saya-saya. And I mean  ang saya-saya.   I'm going to be fine, I know. I'm anxious but losing my job is better than what other people are facing in their lives. At least, my sister is graduating in March and I don't have to think about her tuition fees anymore. At least, I'm healthy. I have friends, Kulas, my family. I have a home.   So even if I don't have you, hah! Life goes on. It's gonna be tough but what the heck. I learned this in kindergarten.       ***   crazy what-if for the week  while talking to Mama over pasta marinara    me : Ma,  ano kaya  if I called Citibank and tell their Customer Service Officer, " miss, I have an account with you. I was just thinking  baka puwedeng back to zero na lang yun..."      ---insert Citi Phone officer: " Naku,  ma'am. I'm afraid we can't   do that"         me: " eh baka lang naman puwede nating pag-usapan ...(a beat)... o sige less 20% na lang..."   Har-har. I wish.

      I'm 25 and I wish never got out of college.  When you're faced with things like monthly bills, your sister's school allowance, bills, and more bills--plus the thought of not being able to set out something concrete for your future in terms of career and a lot more--you'd really wish all you have to think about are homeworks, deadlines,  baon , and Saturday night gimmicks.   It's not about angst, really. It's simply about life not "promising a heavenly dessert" (borrowed from my all-time favorite movie  Antonia's Line . And well, all they told us back in those high school career orientations was that "we have a bright future ahead of us". Bah.  Oh sure, I do.   Except that I have to keep working my butt off and who knows, I might snap out of this soon. I sometimes wish,too, that I was still my college self when I would question everything and when I still believed Marx has the answer to everything.  Maybe a caffeine fix has the answer. Darn.

I miss eating out. Enough with work and not getting paid on time.   Hey, Ian, I'm getting in touch with Tara soon and I'm pitching a book!  I am resurrecting the  kikay  in me. Maybe that's just what I need.  Oh wait. Do check out my friend  urlLink Tins'  photo blog. Aside from the fact that she has an amazing eye,  I  am featured in her recent entry. Hehe.

        In-Betweeness    It's an in-between day. You don't hate it nor do you like it. You just go along, not thinking, not thinking because you're tired of it. You don't do anything to break into this  in-betweeness  because there is nothing to find out, nothing else to discover when you finally allow yourself to go beyond this state. All is in your hands, in your mind, and it's stuck like some nasty gum you sat on. Don't hope for an epiphany. Nothing's there.  Nothing's ever there.   Now do not accuse me of pessimism. The universe just has a funny way of toying with my life. Sometimes I think of just staying still, as in literally not moving. I won't brush my teeth, won't go to work, won't eat, won't get off a cab, won't respond to somebody calling my name, won't budge even if the office is on fire--I just won't do, won't do a thing.  The world still turns. The world turns still.  ***   People understand...   Tere - that I can't give her everything she wants even if I try. I give her what I have, what I can and what I am.  Kulas - that I have my flaws; that the way I love him is the best way I know.  TJ - that I love him as much as I love Tere.  Mama - that I may not show it at times, but she is my source of strength  Nina and Sam - that my friendship with them will live up to a hundred years more  Ayvi - that my love for her and Isis transcends the days we are not together  Neng-neng - that I am always distracted and busy and tired but I will go to wherever she is when she needs me -- even when my hair is a mess  Tina - that I have bright ideas for work but just can't seem to hold it anymore and that our friendship is something  more than these cubicle walls can speak of  Tatay and Nanay - that I tried not to disappoint you when you were still around  Y - that letting go was the best thing we ever agreed on.  Ian - that I easily forget things and that I don't really intend to forget things  Jojo - that I love him for being the big bully brother I never had  Vlad - that I treasure our friendship so much  The Etnebs - that I miss you, damn it!  Papa - that I sometimes blame him for all the mess I've gotten into  God - because he does.  ***  Senti moment. Humor me.

       for Kulas, these days.    Two of Us Lyrics   Two of us riding nowhere Spending someone's hard earned pay You and me Sunday driving Not arriving on our way back home We're on our way back home We're on our way home We're going home  Two of us sending postcards Writing letters on my wall You and me burning matches Lifting latches on our way back home We're on our way home We're on our way home We're going home  You and I have memories Longer than the road That stretches out ahead  Two of us wearing raincoats Standing solo in the sun You and me chasing paper Getting nowhere on our way back home We're on our way back home We're on our way home We're going home  You and I have memories Longer than the road That stretches out ahead  Two of us wearing raincoats Standing solo in the sun You and me chasing paper Getting nowhere on our way back home We're on our way back home We're on our way home We're going home We're going home  - Aimee Mann & Michael Penn

      I'm writing this between forkfuls of (a tad salty) lasagna Kulas bought at Chocolate Kiss. I had  piyaya  for breakfast and practically nothing for lunch. I need nourishment, Kulas says.   Been very busy and still am. My sister graduated last March 20. I've always thought it would be quite emotional when I finally see her receive her diploma---I was teary-eyed but I was damn proud :)  I was in Iloilo last week. It was too hot. I actually burned the soles of my feet when I crossed the five-inch wide bamboo bridge leading to the mangrove forest we were supposed to monitor. The mangrove reforestation project of Barangay Napti in Capiz was one of the most beautiful mangrove forests I've seen. But the fisherfolk and the rest of the people of Napti would have to wait a while to have a fully revived coastal habitat.   I ate nothing but fish, oysters and clams the whole week. It was glorious.  Sayang lang  we weren't able to cross islands. Boracay would have been a treat.  Business is doing well. Our stocks are sold out and we're ordering materials and manufacturing them again.   The art camp is near na. Still a lot of marketing needs to be done.   Im getting depressed by the amount of work I need to do.   Why am I doing these again? Nice. After a long hiatus from blogging, I come up with this one lousy, griping entry.   I ought to take a break real soon.

       "Sports car, yung red!"   I like this particular Fita commercial because I've witnessed how it affects young kids, specifically my cousins. They now think about doing good deeds and avoiding bad ones because they know that whatever they do has a consequence. They're too young to understand how  karma  really works. But it's enough that they get the point in its simplest essence.   Last night when I got home, there was a commotion in front of the gate of our house. When I asked them what was going on, I saw an old lady looking very, very tired and weak and hungry, standing by. I asked her what she wants and she said, "puwede bang magpahinga muna sa inyo dahil pagod na pagod na ako... (can i take a rest in your place for a while, please)"  I told my nanny Mai-mai to let her in. I later found out that they didn't want the lady in because she might be a thief or something. I even had an argument with my Tita, who to my surprise, was there in the sala all along. Apparently, she had refused the lady in, too.   What harm could an old lady do to us, anyway? She might be a "spy" of some  Akyat Bahay  gang, they said. Aghast, I said "she looks blind to me na nga eh!" I was furious to say the least.  I understand how people can't just trust others these days. I would often hear  ikaw na nga ang tumulong, ikaw pa ang napapasama . But if this would be the case all the time, how are we going to make a difference? Perhaps it is because people know mistrust so well that it's what drives them to do harm on other people.   Now, we're still all alive, aren't we? And despite our everyday struggles, don't we owe it to ourselves to at least reach out and thank God we weren't in that old lady's place?  It saddened me more than it infuriated me. I was sad because my own family couldn't find in their hearts how to help people sans reservations... If my Tatay and Nanay were still alive, they would have welcomed that old lady and let her have dinner with us.  I hope the pork  sinigang , rice and mangoes I let her eat would sustain her till she finds another home who would, this time, welcome her with open arms.   Assholes here, there and everywhere   I don't know why I always get my share of assholes. This morning on my way to work (again), a giant kelloidal iguana disguised as a man wearing a white polo, slacks and buffed leather shoes, refused to close his car passenger door while he was waiting for somebody. Now our street isn't exactly as wide as the Super Highway that's why the pedicab I was riding couldn't pass through.   Pedicab driver: "sir, makikiraan ho..." Iguana: "sandali baka tamaan kotse ko"  So we were in the middle of the street stranded by his car door.   Me: "Mama, baka ho puwedend makiraan" Iguana: "oho, sandali ma'am. baka tamaan kotse ko" Me: "eh isara nyo ho muna" Iguana:""teka lang ha, teka lang. Baka tamaan nga eh" Me: "eh padaan nga lang ho! isara nyo muna!"  Aaaaaargh.    God bless you, Manong driver   My cab driver this morning seemed like a gentle, loving father who has been out driving his cab all night. He kept dozing off through our way to Quezon Ave. I would normally worry if this was the case. But I was feeling this sincere vibe from him that I couldn't get mad nor irritated.  "Ma'am sorry po ha, puyat po ako pag-pasada kagabi eh..."  I asked if he would like a bar of chocolate to keep him awake.   Thank God, I often forget to clean my bag. I remembered I had a melting bar of Cadbury Almonds somewhere in my cave of a bag.   That and a generous tip would hopefully send him home, smiling.   I will quit smoking I will quit smoking I will really really quit smoking   There.

       Breathe in, breathe out   I missed blogging for days and I am trying to squeeze this in now.   Our House Center for Children's Creativity is the art center/creativity school I have started late last year. Activities are now kicking off especially now that it's summer. I am organizing/facilitating art workshops for kids this summer, together with some artist, writer and teacher friends. Our workshops are meant NOT ONLY to teach the basics of art but moreso to instill in kids creativity, passion in discovering new things, and a sense of self particularly in creating things--working with their hands.   We are not your everyday art class. We are fun and exciting, too. :)  Oh, and we are also organizing an Art  Camp in Antipolo. If you have lil brothers or sisters or kids whom you think would be interested, please, please let me know :)  Meanwhile Project Brainstorm is a creative services and concepts group. The basic idea is this: interested people gather together in a meeting,  brainstorm  for projects and work on them. Everyone is welcome: writers, artists--graphic,deisgn,layout,visual,etc--,sales & marketing people, photographers-- kahit sino  who has the flair for creative projects and working with people.  How does it work? The group comes up with a list of potential projects e.g. a publication of a one-time lifestyle journal. Writers and artists will handle the editorial stuff; marketing people will sell the project to sponsors--and the work goes on.  Now, does it work? Oh yeah, oh yeah :)   However, PB is not for people who are after a lot of money. Equal profit sharing is the key here. This is because no capital is involved except for basic admin expenses that will be shouldered by the PB Board Fund. The PB Board Fund is composed of again, writer and artist friends--inlcuding yours truly. PB is also SEC registered.  My high school best friends and I also have a start-up business now. It's called  I'm Kikay . We package products for pre-teen, teen and not-so-teen girls. Our product now is a  Kikay Beach Kit --a pair of really cute flip-flops perfect for the beach, a wooden brush, a wooden massage roller, colorful hair rubber bands, and a make-up pouch w/mirror--all inside a powder blue or yellow mesh shoulder bag. It's pretty cheap, too :) 200 bucks is nothing compared to the prices of each individual product in our kit. Department stores sell them on a 300% markup even!  So with all these projects and my day job, I barely have time to pat myself on the back and tell me to relax. Oh well.  Those who are interested, just email me :)   To the bat cave.

       No day but Today   I don't know where I get my energy these days. What with all the going's on at home, work and my projects, I barely have time to clip my nails.  But it's good. I have been super hyper. Thanks to the encouragement of my friends, Kulas and fellow kindred spirits. I am now working on my projects--both money-making and creative schemes.   urlLink Jo  mentioned in her blog that the problem of our generation is not "finding one's self"; rather it's "finding one's place". A cliche perhaps but it's right on the target. It's a different world now: we go to school to be (mis)educated and later explore what our hearts tell us to. Then we try to get jobs and when we do, it's only two things: we like it or we don't. There are also the ones who are complacent in growing roots in their office cubicles and just...stay there--not for economic reasons but merely out of mediocrity and sheer complacency. It's like, I get paid every month, go to gimmicks, go out on dates, so what the heck.  And really, what the heck, that's the way they want it, right?  However, there are those who stay in their jobs, hate it everyday but can do nothing but stay because they have a sibling to send to school, a father who's sick, the reasons are endless. Yet given the opportunity, these are the ones who would take the plunge, leave their jobs and do whatever they want regardless of the pay.   So you see, it's not about discovering who you are because we know that already. People might say that our generation is too caught up in trivial pursuits--we have  reasons . And we are smart. We know what we want to do with ourselves and our lives only that the world is cruel and there are very few chances.  But we need to act soon.  ***  My creative services project is on the grind now. I have a number of clients already and I'll be doing the presentations next week. It's scary but also exciting. I need partners:  writers, artists, marketing people . I will also be holding art/creativity workshops and camps for kids this summer. I will be needing part-time art teachers. Holler if you're interested :)  ***  Also, I have a renewed sense of excitement about my day job. Again, I am getting the projects I want--creative ones.  I met up with my best friends  urlLink Nina  and  urlLink Sam  last night at Starbucks Intramuros and discussed our projects. We will start filming an indie film next month and will show it in indie cinemas like Brash Young Cinema. For the love of the craft, this time (if we get revenues, better. Hehe).  I have meetings later starting at 4pm til about 9, with different people. Marketing people from PLDT, WG&A (bless them passengers) and Earth & Style. If I get these accounts, I'd be able to send my sister to Bangkok as my grduation gift to her.   ***  Again, I will be needing creative people. Email me at unang_amihan@yahoo.com subject: Project Brainstorm. Virus senders will be immediately blocked. Hehe. And one thing more, I can't pay much. At least not yet. But if you're just taking up your PhD in Professional Bumming, what the heck, let's make those creative juices flowing!

      Squeeze these in:  1. Finish presentation for Iloilo before lunch 2. Meeting with the Web Team at 1pm 3. Fax documents to our regional offices 4. Design and print posters and streamers for tomorrow's camp 5. Label the art supplies and pack them 6. Check the camp program flow 7. Buy last-minute supplies 8. Have dinner with Kulas  I'll be on my toes today. Wish me luck. I hope there won't be problems with the kids tomorrow. Six-year olds don't wet their beds anymore, do they? And they eat stuff other than hotdogs, right? It's going to be fun but really tough,too. I'll post their artworks after the camp. Can't wait.

      Sometimes it's good for you to read about other poeple's lives through their journals when you're having an "i-need-to-get-a-life" syndrome. It's usually a rollercoaster ride, this feeling, but what the heck, you've got to get out of it and move on.  And so as I try my darndest to forget about my fuck-ups, I'm learning to face each day one step at a time--baby steps if you will. So many people are in such a mess, too. Even worse. Hell, I don't even care if I'm sounding a la Hallmark. See those sunbeams, o? I'm trying.  Well, among the things I need to be grateful for and should smile about, there's Bunny and her  urlLink blog . Her most recent entry really made me grin :)  I need discipline and patience. Most of my friends have either won or joined the Palanca while I have yet to even decide on when I will, too. I am plain lazy.   Eric smsd me that Nick Joaquin passed away this morning. I have yet to have a beer with him. Of course, he's one great loss blah blah blah. But not really, when you think about it. He has lived a full life.   OK. Back to work. Im finishing a presentation for a lecture on Web Writing I'm giving in Iloilo next week. Duh. I can't even write well on my blog. I remember when I was still teaching in Silliman. I'll get by naman, I hope :)  Oh and speaking of Eric, he didnt get into this year's National Writers' Workshop in Dumaguete. I dont know what happened--either it's politics or he just didnt make the cut. I dont know na rin how his writing has come by eh. His fiction was the best back in college, earning him grand prizes in USTetika and the Rector's Literary Award. I was always second. Oh but at least I was the one who got the 1.0's in the subjects that mattered to us Lit seniors. Hehe.  Myrza Sison of Cosmo got into Dumaguete this year (and Monica Macansantos, Eric added). Haven't read their literary works, only Myrza's columns. But this early, I have seen raised eyebrows and have heard murmurs...  Buti na lang Mitzie Correa got in. Congrats, Mitzie :)  ***  I wish Crayola would have their products here, like the ones theys ell abroad. They only have crayons and oil pastels here. My students love Crayola products pa naman. I lvoed them too as a kid and I still do.  In fact, I bought a fresh box of 64 Crayola Crayons last Sunday at National Katips. Couldn't help it. I was shopping for supplies for my students. Sarap. You get to shop for stuff you like even if they're not for you :)  Back to work na talaga.  PS. Kulas will fetch me later and go with me to shop for more supplies for the camp. Sana di na kami galit.

      I'm tired of posting the same shitty stuff about me. I have been too tired actually: of work, some people around me , of the same crap that goes on day in and day out. I've got to break patterns here.   Tina asked earlier if I was happy about my life and I gave her a straight 'no'. Kulas would say I'm too dark, too angst-ridden. That I need to cheer up, face the world smiling.  I want to do just that. Believe me.  ***  I've turned out to be an insecure, self-loathing, people-doubting, bitch. I don't like me anymore.   ***  I am pouring out my energies to work, the art camp this saturday,  basta  away from thoughts of  me .

       Turbulent Indigo by Joni Mitchell   You wanna make Van Goghs  Raise 'em up like sheep  Make 'em out of Eskimos  And women if you please  Make 'em nice and normal  Make 'em nice and neat  You see him with his shotgun there?  Bloodied in the wheat?  Oh what do you know about  Living in Turbulent Indigo?   Brash fields, crude crows  In a scary sky  In a golden frame  Roped off  Tourists guided by  Tourists talking about the madhouse  Tourists talking about the ear  The madman hangs in fancy homes  They wouldn't let him near  He'd piss in the fireplace  He'd drag them through Turbulent Indigo   "I'm a burning hearth," he said  "People see the smoke,  But no one comes to warm themselves  Sloughing off a coat  And all my little landscapes  All my yellow afternoons  Stack up around this vacancy  Like dirty cups and spoons  No mercy sweet Jesus  No mercy from Turbulent Indigo"   Apologies to Joni Mitchell   These are the times when I think I would gladly welcome sadness or solitude or tedium or even the feeling of stagnation rather than this unpredictable cruelty: a sinking feeling that pulls me down slowly and then pushes me up again, leaving me weightless and light once, then heavy and burdened after. I wish I could come up with a metaphor for this. Like Joni's turbulent indigo.   ***  I feel that I am being stripped off of my feelings. My emotions and sometimes my thoughts are questioned: why are you sad? why  should  you be sad? why do you get mad?   I used to feel like a complete person. And part of being complete is being able to give myself wholly to another; being able to trust.   I hope I am not turning out to be a stranger to my own self. And because  you  would not understand, I shall not give any explanation anymore. I am very, very tired of being asked why I am this way...  ***  I am a woman who is kind-hearted but fair and just. I take care of those around me: family,friends, a Partner,strangers even. I value honesty so much.  I love my body. And those who know me, or who have known me, men and women, know how my body arches in delight when secret crevices are discovered or how it winces when pain comes, physical or otherwise.   These are just a few things about me. I do not know if-- despite the fact that you claim to love me with all your heart, all your life--you know this woman.

       Holy Wednesday   You ask yourself what the universe is really offering you, all these years of asking questions, wondering, wondering and never getting the right answers. Open your hands tonight. Fall on your knees. Pray.  Pray for redemption. Pray for your own heaven.   ******  I guess I should be relieved I wouldn't have to work this week. I need the break, except that I am not really getting any. It's weird how things are turning out here. It's Ninang's first chemo session today. God, let her be alright please.   My high school bestfriend Elhyn arrived from Canada because her dad passed away. We went to their house in the South to pay our respects. I wonder about my own death. I am no stranger to it, though. Two years ago, my Tatay and Nanay left us for some sunny field in the sky. I have always imagined heaven to be like that: sunny, a bright and golden field of barley, willowy. Like Sting's.  ******  I have been neglecting my writing, my canvases and my paintbrushes. All I think about now is my family and how to help them more; my friends, Kulas. And more.  So much more.  ******  I realized tonight is the first time in weeks, months even, that I get to play some music and listen to it. As in really listen. Funny, Kulas has been complaining that I dont know how to listen anymore. How true, as my thoughts meander all the time. It's sad, isn't it? I am not like this. I was never like this.  I*****  I am grieving about something I have lost and will never find again. White is the color of mourning.  Good night, Tintin.

      This will be another rambling entry (as always,teehee). Back here in the office, doing some final stuff for tomorrow's workshop in Sariaya. I hope J.A. doesnt really have the star complex that I'm suspecting him to have.   I'm back on my morning mug of Nesvita. Why am I telling you that?  Erm, wala lang  I saw my corn-stained mug kasi.   Im hungry na. Im craving for some serious Chicken Inasal at JT's Manukan Grille in Gilmore. His is my favorite so far. Matches the ones in Negros.  Got to drop by again at the hospital for Ninang tonight. I also have to save up a little because I volunteered to buy Barry's school supplies this weekend. Im actually excited about it despite the additional strain on my budget. I love shopping--specially at bookstores.   The smell of notebooks, crayons, pencils, of plastic covers---divine, man. It also reminds me of grade school, which I wish I never left.  ~  Troy sucks. Shrek 2 is hilarious! Superb,witty and funny dialogues. Will see it again. Also watched Monsoon Wedding on DVD. Nice.   Got to go. my head's spinning in hunger.

      What is more important, a person’s past or his future?  Kulas and I both have different experiences that have shaped what we are now and how we lead ourselves. We have lived our lives so differently yet so similarly at the same time. But now that we are together, I wonder about the weight of these experiences, at least the significance of these to his life now.  The twenty-year gap between us is not a joke at all.  Between conversations in the car, during dinner, over coffee—in varying moods and momentums, his past and mine surface. In my case, I have long gotten over what-could-have-beens and looking back is only a luxury I indulge myself in from time to time. I wonder, then, is it the same with him? Though he says, the past is over, could there be thoughts of what-ifs in his mind? Perhaps an undisclosed desire that the past never went as it did?  Isn’t the future too short and too uncertain to be valued? We put too much importance onto a yet unknown chasm of time that’s bound to swallow us alive or dead, depending on how we play it. But the past, the past already has its stories to tell, its innumerable characters and twists in plot that we play again and again in our minds. The past carries names, wounds, scars, songs. And the future? It only has a promise. A promise of more names, wounds, scars, and more songs.   When he tells you you are his future, don’t you just get relegated into a limbo, a state that’s all the more changeable and unsure?  We try to be careful and take hold of uncertainties: a life insurance, a spare key, an umbrella in case it rains. But really, we will never know.

      Back here in Manila--no Boracay, no Baguio, but only these too-early monsoon rains. Im blogging here in Kulas' home. I took four jeepney rides from my place to Dapitan where I asked Kulas to fetch me. I didnt want him to drive all the way from QC to Manila because of the heavy rains. I had a quick late lunch of pork tonkatsu at Oddies Crossings, bought a box of donuts and headed here to his place. The donuts were gone in a few seconds! :) The kids--Mia,Ana,and Enzo were all fans of Dunkin like me (we still think Dunkin is better than Gonuts). I asked Kulas to get me a Choco Frosted donut but gave me a Choco Honey Dipped. Ala lang. I know my donuts kasi even if I'm blindfolded. Twas cute, though.  I made him watch Lost in Translation. He liked it.  I should write daw he's singing 'Home" right now--Kulas  His hearing is on Tuesday and I'll be in Quezon then with Joey Ayala and people at work for a workshop. I wish I could be with him...  Going home na in a while. Jaime is driving us. It's a new setup we're trying. At least Kulas wont be dead tired when he gets back home.  Oh and Beef Wanton Mami at Mann Hann is weird. It's like nilagang baka complete with vegetables and ginger. Yun lang. My right shoulder is acting up again.  ~  Happy birthday Nanay. I miss you very very much.

      Stepped out of the hotel on a Tuesday Iloilo afternoon and I gasped at the glorious sunlight and the wind, the wind! Everything was yellow. The after-rain descended like butterfly wings.  ~  After this morning's workshop session, I went to our Regional Office with the rest of the Team. We had to work on some logistics stuff. Being the IT ignorant me, I had to settle with printing workshop certificates, photocopying evaluation sheets, sorting and stapling them. Believe me, it was relaxing. I found myself humming the "Spongebob Squarepants" theme, bobbing my head up and down to an imaginary cartoon MTV in my demented head. What a great therapy.   Back here at the hotel now. I just want to blog before dinner. Oh and I think I'm going to get myself one of those ditzy sandwich makers. Cheesemelt sandwiches are best cooked in those gizmos.  Will try to be a chance passenger for Manila tomorrow. No Bora for me. My sister called me and I had to be home ASAP--nothing toe-curling though. Just some Ate-responsibilities that only I could handle. It's also Ninang's chemo session again on Friday so I have to take care of the bills,etc.  Kulas and I might go up to Baguio in the weekend.   Got to eat now. Share some inasal with me :)

      The group and I had coffee at Ground, Iloilo's Starbucks according to Erwin. They had the usual gourmet coffee concoctions but none to really give me a much needed jolt. We stayed there for about two hours, with Jay and Jojo alternately trying to be the two-man audience of the conyo Ilongga in what seemed to be a five-inch mini and a white shirt that also drops five inches from the neckline. After coffee, we dropped by Biggy's, a local Korean convenience store (now that doesn't sound right,does it?) where everything cost twice its original retail price. A sugarless spearmint Orbit gum was 30 bucks each! Di ba sobra? Now, being the crazy me, I went around the store picking up items and checking out their prices,simultaneously exclaiming "___pesos!!! grabe!", then bringing the said item to my friends queued at the cashier. I stopped only when the guard asked me what the problem was but was quick to add, "Manong ang mamahal ng tinda nyo!" Hehe. (I have a history with guards remember? :p )  We passed by the church near our hotel to check out the Sunday mass schedules. The English mass was set at 5:30. At least that's what Sam thought he saw.  Well, we ended up hearing the Hiligaynon mass the following day. I was hoping it would at least be in Cebuano which I understand perfectly. Nonetheless, as Kulas texted after, "we received the same grace."  ~  The rain hasn't let up since this morning. It's quite depressing. I am reminded of my first few weeks in Dumaguete. Rain, gray skies, away from home, friendless and a broken heart made by a boy in Manila...  I never liked rainy days when I am away. It makes me think of when I was a kid and my mom not spending the night at home; reminds me of school openings and I didnt get the Merit notebooks again (they're too much for my budget,Mama would say); makes me see Papa carrying his suitcases and loading them in the car; makes me remember of the day we left La Vista for good and settle for my grandparents' house in Manila.   Sad? Not really. I just need something or someone to comfort me on days such as these.   ~  Vlad texted a few nights ago that Naya was asking how I was and why my recent entries have been sad. I have to agree. I'm trying to work on it though. Being sad gets to be really tiring.  ~  I got the best surprise email today from a friend-ex-muse-distraction-addiction. Surely missed K.

      Blogging from one of my favorite cities in the country should be interesting. Here in Iloilo, strangers become friends, you develop new tastes and hear a language different from your own. I have just given a lecture on Web Writing, how ironic as my writing has been really in bad shape. It went pretty well, the lecture, judging by their expressions, nods and their vigorous note-takings.   Boracay is just a bus ride and a ferry ride away. I'm escaping work and heading there in six days. I should be glad except that I miss Kulas, Terenggoy, my family and my friends. Funny, I miss everyone I love now. The thought of curling up in my hotel room with any of the books I brought with me doesn't seem that exciting anymore.   I miss home. The best way to end my day, always, is for Kulas to kiss me good night and Tere demanding for me to stop reading and turn off the lamp light.  Somehow, a five-star hotel service and a very enchanting city can drive one nuts with homesickness. And it's only been two days.

       Sentimental Thursday   I love you in the plainest meaning of these words. To define it and to attempt describing it are beyond me. I have tried doing so before, with the many faces and names that I have once promised to keep for a lifetime. But here I am, connected to this invisible but real thread of loving: we can either choose to cut it, or just weave it intricately till our hands get tired and we just choose to hold each other's and rest.  I do not want you any other way. I want the same cologne on your collar, the muscles that twitch at my slightest touch, the mouth that curls up into a smile when I kiss your neck, the same mouth that frowns and bites and kisses and eats...  I have chosen you, among those names covered with the Past;among the names to come.  I will never own you nor you will me. My love will keep my center, like gravity, it pulls me on the ground...

       Turning Schizo   I know my entries have been giving you the impression that I am a schizo. Well, with my life's drama and my propensity to trod on more "dramatic" paths, I might just evolve into a new species of the modern-day schizoid.   The art camp was absolutely fun. I had to take painkillers though as I was too tired after. I'll be posting pics as soon as Kulas re-uploads them on the cam's memory card. I miss those makukulit kids.  Blogging at nine a.m. here at work is actually indecent. I just want to squeeze this in and think...  ***  Though I love Pantoja's pastries, I simply loathe their staff. I am normally very nice to people specially to food attendants, salesladies,the like. But Pantoja's? They need more training. And common sense.  ***  Kulas and I caught "Man on Fire" in Greenhills. As usual, I fell in love with Denzel Washington's performance. Dakota Fanning proved to be a lot more clever than her age, and that's not only because of her role in the movie, it shows in her eyes.  The movie was good in an entertaining way. It has its flaws, as most Hollywood thriller are wont to be. The twists were, erm, too twisted. I love the relationship between Creasy (Denzel) and Pita (Dakota). Oh and Mexico's a lot more like Manila. There was even a shot that looked like the Quiapo underpass.  A bit of epiphany here and there. And then some. Kulas complained of the anti-climactic part between the characters of Denzel and Dakota's father.  Won't talk about it na. Just go watch it. It wouldn't lull you to sleep naman specially if you don't want to think and you just want to relax.  All in all, Kulas and I had a very laidback and relaxed evening. It's been a long time :)  ***  I want to shop for books. The nearest bookstore to me is National but its Quezon Ave's fiction/literary collection sucks. I'll check out Booktopia in Libis soon. Popular and Powerbooks might give some nice finds too. Again, it's been a long time :)   ***  I'm going back to working on my writing while developing child art and creativity porgrams for Our House. Kulas and I are on full force now.  ***  If you pray, please include Kulas and whisper to your God to intervene in his case. On another note, I know God favors those who are truthful. God knows Kulas' heart...

      Im going to Palawan tomorrow to help shoot another video documentary. It's going to be a heavy week of field work but I'm excited to be traveling on my own again. I'm looking forward to waiting for my boarding time at the airport, sitting by the lounge, coffee, uhm but no, i don't intend to have a pre-departure smoke. I do not want to stink in the plane aside from the fact that I have been two weeks nicotine free! Ok, ok. There was that one stick when I was trying to write that darn script.  Dreamt about an ex some nights ago. This man would haunt me, consume me and kill me over and over. I don't care. I can now conquer him--something I wasn't able to do when he left.  ***  I wrote this for the Philippine Literature site. My editor-friend asked me to submit something on gender lit so there.    coming home   with the two of us naked, standing bare on this cold, tiled floor face to face, chests heaving, our nipples taut and firm— i kiss your closed eyes and my tongue traces wherever your tears flow:  somewhere in the planes of your mind, a memory flickers; a memory of opening doors, of entering rooms, opening doors again  and then finally closing them.  you raise your hands, my palms on yours the countries of your skin welcoming me, a stranger discovering, finding her way home.  let me look at you now, tonight:  your hair's no longer tangled seaweeds shored that speak of mermaids drowning, of lost ships, of sinking bodies crying in gulps of air;  your eyes, your eyes are two black moons rising full, rising full;  let me look at you now, tonight.  let me taste milk flowing down your thighs, vanilla on your skin--let me in, let me in  as i look at you now, oh let me look at you now, tonight, let me cradle your sadness with my hands and then wash them away; let my mouth bathe every scab, every scar on each fold of your skin.  let me look at you now, tonight: let me take you--wife, child, lover-- let me take you home.

       Wanted for Immediate Hiring: Tintin's muse   My muse, my muse, come here and save me please.  Thing is, I can't write here in the office. It's too cold, too many people tick-tacking on their keyboards, too many phones ringing at the same time, I just can't, can't write.  Too many excuses.  I can see from between slats of the "tora-tora propellers"/blinds of my window: blue-gray sky, trees (yes, there are trees in my view) swaying. I want to go out. I want to go to the Sunken Garden like I always did whenever I needed to think, back when I was in grad school and stayed in Ayala Heights.   My deadline is tomorrow. It's a video documentary script. I already have one but I have to overhaul it.   I think I'll go for a smoke.And coffee.Free office coffee.    Tintin Manang Driver   What if I got a professional driver's license and drive my own taxi?  The manong driver I talked to yesterday said the "boundary" is PhP1,500. He earns 800 or more on good days. 800 the least. That's, uhm, more than 20k right?  But I'll buy a pepper spray first (for would-be hold-uppers), a map,a car charger, and those dogs whose heads bob up and down.  Gahhhd. Kailangan ko nang magsulaaaaat.

       Flatter than flat broke   I can't afford to buy myself a salad from a fastfood joint. I have been feeling bloated for days already and I do need to go on a pseudo-diet. But what teh heck, I can't even afford to choose what to eat because I simply have to make do with what's available at home and bring it with me. But this morning, nobody cooked. I got a couple of Ziplock bags from the cupboard and stuffed them with all the chocolate chip cookies from the jar. I munched on them for breakfast and will do so again for lunch. I forgot to bring my tumbler for some milk.   Really. My ATM's begging for mercy so I can't count on it. I searched through all the pockets and seams of my bags to look for coins or bills that could have been stashed in. No dinero though;but there were leftover Orbit Spearmint sugarless gum, crumbs of my favorite Granny Goose Tortillos cheese, Starbucks receipts, paper clips, chopsticks and drinkinh straws.  Later when I get home, I'll start again with my pants and skirts for "pockets of surprises".  Oh by the way, Tere gave me 1 grand. Cool. My little sister can now feed me. I'll quit work and put up my feet now :p Thanks sis.   Giddiyap    Mama and I met up yesterday in one of the dingiest malls in Manila.She wanted to treat me to dinner and coffee and some shopping,too. Oh well. We should have gone some place else.  She took me home riding a calesa. We passed through Jone's and Ayala bridges,Escolta and Binondo. Through the ride the cochero would whip the poor horse and it would halt or skid too suddenly and my heart jumps with it.Grabe, I could have died with fright.  Riding vehicles that's supposed to be enclosed but is not, brings out my acro/agora phobia. It's weird because I ride bikes. I used to drive a Honda XRM and can handle a Vespa Nexus but when riding something like, say, a Wrangler or plain owner type jeep,my heart just prepares to explode. The calesa was not an exception. It also didn't help that I'm scared of horses.  But being with my mom felt like nothing will go wrong so while my fingers hurt with clutching the calesa's hand rail too tightly, it didn't matter anymore. Mama was there with me.  I can dig this...        but this?

       Intsik   "Intsik, halika". I would often hear them call her. The men in my neighborhood wore sandos usually holed and frayed at the edges, the lower half of it folded up revealing their potbellies. They converged by Mang Derek's store, sitting on the wooden bench the Kabataang Barangay solicited money for. On seemingly lucky days, beer bottles would be rolling by their tsinelas-clad feet. Mostly though, they would drink gin  bilog  and chase it with water taken from Barangay 4's  poso . Sometimes on luckier days, they would call Intsik and she would be sitting with them, fanning herself with her skirt, the heat always tremendously scorching for her to bear...  Mama said we should not play with her, with Intsik. She was not allowed in the house more so. Mama said Intsik took money from our neighbors and from people in the streets. Why didn't she go to jail, I asked.   Oh yes she did go to jail every time she got caught, Mama said. But the police liked her too much especially Capt. Guzman.   I have been to Intsik's house in Barangay 4. She lived with Lisa, her older sister and Aling Trina, their mother. Aling Trina did our laundry in the summer when Yaya goes home to Dipolog for her vacation. Aling Trina had never gone to a vacation, she told me while I was bathing my Barbie in the  planggana . But she had been on a ship before, when she was younger and her dentures new. Aling Trina said her uncle took her to a cruise around Asia. They were on the ship for a whole month. She loved the food, she said. And dressing up, putting on perfume and make-up. Her uncle bought her clothes for when the Chinese captain of the ship held dinners and invited his guests.   That was how I got to play with Intsik every Saturday in summer. Mama would ask me to fetch Aling Trina from their house and I would stay behind to play with Intsik.  Her real name was Rosanna, she said. Their neighbors called her Intsik because of her eyes and porcelain skin. You have beautiful China eyes, I told her. Intsik just smiled.  She didn't have toys like I did. We used the lids of milk cans for plates, the bottle of Clorox for our pitcher and their Nescafe glasses. We ate with our hands. I wanted to bring my tea set but Mama wouldn't let me take them out of the house. She said my playmates would just steal them.  When Mama found out I had been  staying  in Intsik's house, she blamed Aling Trina for talking me into it. Mama said Aling Trina owed our family a lot and that they could not afford to pay it up. Mama was screaming the whole time. Aling Trina just looked at her gnarled hands. Mama also said Aling Trina is a whore who pimps her own daughter.   I never saw Aling Trina in our house again after that. The men in Mang Derek'ss store said they had moved into a house in a subdivision in Cavite. They also told me Intsik likes policemen more than jeepney drivers...   - excerpt,  Intsik , an unfinished story.

      It's so noisy inside me. I have to quit procrastinating and write everyday. Putting words in black and white ought to quiet me down. Words should contain me. Now, I am having trouble catching up with my thoughts again. Again writing is my answer, except that I should have done so days ago, and write each and everyday.  I am not exactly happy nor sad. This in-betweeness is a phase I always go through. Nothing new.   Paranoia is also creeping up. Then again, my intuitions do not normally fail me. In fact, it has never did particularly when it comes to relationships.  I think Kulas is changing--if he hasn't yet, that is. Kulas doesn't tell me where he is during the day,unlike before. He doesn't seem to care,too, if I tell him I'll be out with friends or that I am already with them without letting him know first. He doesn't text me iloveyou's and the usual sappy lines that would normally be sweet because he's thinking of me. In fact, he tells me he loves me only when it's time to say good night and that is because probably it doesn't feel right if he doesn't tell me he loves me before he sleeps. It's probably the routine-breaking that's shaking me. Routines, however predictable, are comforting. Like two wrinkled hands clasped.   He's twenty years older than I am and I dont expect him to be gooey-sweet to me. It's just that Kulas is a 45 year old  boy  and I have learned to love both the boy and the man...  He's also very busy these days. With his job hanging, he's keeping himself busy with his marine products business. He's been talking to bar/restaurant owners, hotel people, the like. He's also with his business partners the whole day. He picks me up from work and takes me home though. That is mainly what remains to be the same.   So am I suspecting something here?  I honestly dont know. We've been together for almost two years--the first year being really turbulent times. What I do know though, is that he keeps in touch with his exes and other women in his past--or  they  do.  Sometimes I don't care anymore. If he's keeping a girlfriend somewhere, or flirting around, I'm sure I'm bound to know. And when I do, I know what to do.  ***  My phone alerts and there's a message from Kulas. He tells me he loves me.  Hmmm. Now the above post makes me a paranoid,insecure bitch.Aaargh.  ***  Just yesterday, we had a fight about me being so mistrusting. If I told him,  he  made me this way, hell would break loose I'm sure.  ***  TJ and Papa talked on the phone last Saturday. The last time they did was twelve years ago. Imagine the pain, the sadness, the regrets. Two men cried and hoped in their hearts, both love each other despite everything.  ***  Tere and I have been arguing a lot lately. We keep on snapping at each other. Mostly it's about her job, her clothes, my clothes,her derma allowance from me, just about everything. To think, we dont get to spend time with each other that much anymore.  (By the way, she works for  urlLink Mt. Malarayat . If you want to invest on real estate that's hip and yuppie-ish, drop me a line and I'll tell her.)  My sister is my best friend and my worst enemy. Stories of our past fights would tell you that.  ***  This didnt turn out to be the hopeful entry I was expecting it to be. And I have been writing in truncated sentences for quite sometime now. It's discomfiting. I need to go back to school,merge into circles again and write and paint. Be the old Tintin.   ***  By the way, I'm AWOL now. What do I do? Anyone from UP Grad School here? :)  ***  I am helping out with the creativity projects of the kids from Jesus loves the Little Children Foundation through  urlLink Mads . This will be another project for Our House, the kids' creativity center I put up. Im excited. Volunteers are welcome. :)

      I went to work with a quiet heart. The truth is, I have so many things to think about: my mom's love problems (yep, my mom's and she's 49), work, Ninang's health, my brother's baby (I'm going to be an aunt in eight months),and a lot of other miscellaneous things.  I have learned not to think about things when they're not yet jumping up and down my lap. So even if I know I'll be broke till the next pay day and till some clients pay up whatever they owe me, I do not care. It's not also because it's too tiring to care or too sickening to worry. I just don't. Life turns good in the end because no matter how strongly we bitch about it, life is good.  ***  I dreamt that my friend Shawie has given birth to twins and I was the only one with her in the hospital. This morning she called to tell me she's seven weeks pregnant.  I texted Kulas I wish I'd have babies soon. Now, there goes a rule out of your Cosmo. Wasn't I scared that it would drive Kulas scared to his butt?   No. In fact, if he showed the littlest sign of rejecting the idea of having babies soon, I would start thinking of ways to have mine--alone. Immaculate conception, here I come.   But anyway, Kulas and I are planning to get married next year--no killer-proposal though. I doubt if that would happen. I have asked for an engagement car, or an engagement condo, or even an engagement I-book. Cool, isn't it? I never liked wearing rings anyway.  My brother TJ is now a dad. Sad thing is, his situation is too complicated. Too complex, in fact, for me to blog about. The only thing I regret is that he didnt prepare for it. (Now I really don't like his girlfriend--people and family say she's bad news. But it's my bro's choice, still).  Then last night, my mom smsd that Big Kuya might be cheating on her. Well, she thinks he is, and their neighbors can attest to it. I told her to talk to him and get out of it if things dont get settled. My mom has sacrificed a lot already for the guy.   And then Ninang told us over dinner last night that her chemo doesnt seem to be working for her. Her tumor didnt change a bit after three chemo sessions. I think we need to look for another doctor even if her oncologist is her fourth already. We can't take any chances. Stage 3 of lung cancer isn't a joke at all.  Yesterday was Tatay's third death anniversary. I miss him.   If I didnt know better, I would think that these things are  karma . The categorically common Catholic would say, "parusa yan ng Diyos" (God's punishment). I dont think so.  I believe that my God is a loving, merciful and forgiving God. He will never hurt me or those I love.  But let's not get into that.  ***  taken from Naya's blog    Michelle Pfeiffer's character in White Oleander: "You're doing it again. You're attaching yourself to someone who shows you the least bit of attention, because you're lonely."   I have been guilty of this for so many times I deserve the death penalty. Hurting one's self is a crime.

      Im back from Cavite. Work was quite overwhelming and it's bound to be so for the succeeding months. I dont feel like writing now; just want to do something before Kulas and I leave for Greenhills to watch Harry Potter. We were actually there earlier, after he fetched me from the office at four. We bought tickets at five p.m., I think, but we got seats for the 9:40pm screening. Went around the tiangge--nothing new. Went up to Shoppesville and got myself two perfect pairs of cotton pants in light blue and beige.   We're now here at Kulas' house, had dinner, Kulas taking a nap, me blogging away.  While in Greenhills, I got an SMS from Ninang saying my mom was in the hospital. I called my mom immediately and was relieved to hear her voice at the end of the line. She just had high BP, she said, but she's fine and Big Kuya's with her. I told her to ask Big Kuya to call me anytime if they need help. I hope Mama's feeling better now.  It's Tere's first week as a corporate girl. She works for Citibank as one of their Marketing  chuchubel --hehe, make that  chuchubelle . She'd kill me if she reads this. She's been getting calls from different companies still,and I think she really doesn't want to stay in Citibank.Whatever she decides, I'm so damn proud my little sister has a job already.  This is already a pretty lengthy post. And I said Im  tamad  to blog huh.  Im reading Oates' Ugly Girl,Big Mouth. Ang galing ng voice ng story. Ang husay ng pasok ng main characters. Im trying to read it slowly so I won't finish it yet.   Kulas and I will have a business meeting tomorrow . Funny namin, we could have discussed things earlier but we're waiting till tomorrow because we want it to be "serious". Haha. Meaning no lovey-doveys. Strictly business and coffee. Like real money-oriented individuals. Hehe.  Will it work? Being business partners with your lover/boyfriend/fiance?  Hmmm. I'll find out.   That's it. Off to Greenhills.

      Im rushing through this one. The bus is supposed to leave for Cavite in a few minutes. The workshop in Sariaya was probably one of the best the Project has organized. The resource persons (Joey Ayala and Pauline Salvana-Bautista), food, venue,and company were all good. The beach was just a few steps from our room.  Working with Joey A. and Pauline were cool. That will be another post entirely.  Conversations with colleagues during that five-day stay were quite fruitful in that I was made to realize things about my career or the lack of it :p I have plans now--all life-altering. It's scary when you think about it, but again that will be another post.  Oh and I kinda splurged in Young Adult Lit last week. I got "The Sisterhood of the Travelling Pants" by A. Brashares, Joyce Carol Oates' "Big Mouth, Ugly Girl" , Lille Bose's "Una and Miguel" and "Little Altars" by the author of the Yaya Sisterhood (forgot the name). I need some light reading that's fun and entertaining and colorful, and guess what, I got all of that and more :) Im looking forward to getting Melvin Burgess' "Lady: My Life as a Bitch".  Projects are brewing up. I just hope I could manage my time better.  Be back Friday. Have fun y'all!

        Tina's  urlLink Project Seahorse       &nbsp;   My good friend Tins has started her own Project Seahorse campaign. Why seahorses?        Our  urlLink work  takes us to places, to the sea basically and one of the most fascinating marine creatures is the Seahorse.     &nbsp;   Seahorse reproduction is unusual to say the least.&nbsp; And yes, it's true--the males really become pregnant! The female seahorse produces eggs and then passes them to the male, who holds them in a pouch on his belly. Courtship can last for 12 hours, with the pair performing elaborate dances and displays. With their tails entwined, the female aligns a long tube (ovipositor) with her mate's pouch. Strings of sticky eggs move through the tube and into the male's pouch. The eggs, now called embryos, will develop for ten days to six weeks, depending upon the species and water conditions. Finally, over the course of many hours, the male pumps his tail until the baby seahorses emerge.(  urlLink  www.aquarium.org   )     &nbsp;     Seahorses are not yet officially endangered but they are on the IUCN's Red List, meaning their populations are in trouble.           &nbsp;   Amazing isn't it, how these species resemble the single woman's hopes of finding&nbsp;Her Man, a Significant Other who would willingly-- not only because physiologically-created to do so--share a part of himself for them to become one.     &nbsp;    urlLink Tina's &nbsp;metaphor for The One is the seahorse:     &nbsp;  OBJECTIVES:  (1) To devise means by which one’s self will never give up on finding one’s seahorse;  (2) To put in mind that oneself is good and deserve no less better than one truly desire for; (3) To never stop in growing as an individual, loving and allowing one’s self to be loved.   STRATEGIES:  (1) Create a life outside of the workplace;  (2) Renew constantly ties with friends and welcome and even make opportunities for new relationships;  (3) Choose wisely the relationships that would be given extra attention, time and consideration, asking if there’s a future with it worth pursuing;  (4) Be thankful for all the special though temporary relationships that come and hold it with fondness but not to cling to it. (projectseahorse.blogspot.com)    So, how is her campaign doing? Well, like any other projects and campaigns that aim to generate the market's attention, it needs&nbsp;massive PR work. In our work parlance, it needs IEC (information,education,communication). :)     &nbsp;   The One perfect Seahorse awaits.     &nbsp;   Mine is on the lookout for the perfect ring.  Where is yours? Where could he be?

        Top 10 World's Greatest Inventions for Tintin     (in random order)       &nbsp;   1.  St. Ive's Hair Repair Hot Oil in tubes  - perfect for when you don't have time to go to the salon for that Saturday night date. It's really good especially if you use it once a week. I swear I'm going to hoard boxes of this soon. Watson's usually have it but only Crossings carry them these days.     &nbsp;   2.  Modess Ultra Slims with wings  - "I'm glad I switched." --or was that line from another brand?     &nbsp;   3.  Gatsby oil control film  - Oiliness is next to ugliness. Even Kulas and his friends&nbsp;use it.     &nbsp;   4.  Choc-Nut  - better than sex     &nbsp;   5.  Dolfenal 250  - for nasty menstrual cramps. "Madali pang tandaan:dolphy,dolf i nal!"     &nbsp;   6.  Starbucks' Cafe Mocha and Caramel Macchiato  - caffeine and sugar delight     &nbsp;   7.  L'oreal Blush Delice line  - with a tinge of shimmer and reasonably priced     &nbsp;   8.  Lancome Juicy Tubes  - this alone can dress you up on dress-down days. Men love the taste too! Hehe.     &nbsp;   9.  Mongol Pencil  - don't you just love pencils? And the smell...     &nbsp;   10.  Liquid Sosa  - this one is tops on my grocery list. Made the bathroom drain clog-free in seconds.     &nbsp;   ***     &nbsp;   It's time for me to hit the malls and unleash my shopping monsters once again. I absolutely have nothing to wear anymore. I've gained weight since I quit smoking, from an XS to an M! Imagine that. My belly rivals gummy bears for squishiness points. Grabe.     &nbsp;   Kulas and I are watching "Imelda" in Greenhills tonight. I'm losing myself in the tiangge for a pre-movie fix.     &nbsp;   Work hard. Play hard. Not a bad idea.     &nbsp;

        "Sa inyo ang___; akin ang Tundo!"       &nbsp;  One does not easily forget the uniqueness of tondo, a singularity of features that begins to reveal itself with the early morning mass at the Santo Nino Church where parishioners would later be seen joining the eager buyers of  kakanin  and  salabat sold  by peddlers at the church patio, and of course, mornings are not complete without the  magtataho  who occupies his permanent post at the steps of Plaza Hernandez wearing his unmistakable  gora , his shouts of  taho! taho!  are welcomed by children attending the adjacent Catholic school or by early morning  parokyanos  who await the opening of shops at nearby Divisoria where I have spent countless shopping sprees with my grandmother who, by the way, used to tell me stories to keep me from going out in the afternoon and head towards Plaza Moriones to watch the  ati-atihan  groups beat their drums, wave their arms in unison and parade around the plaza--a spectacle which children of my age would never want to miss as we marched along with them, danced in tribal fashion and screamed to our hearts' content--to brandish their pride the way residents of Tondo are wont to do: shame is a stranger to them, to us, as we stride along pot-holed streets where  tambays  who offer gin to passersby is a usual sight; those who dwell in makeshift houses take pride in a community where a sense of belonging is wealth enough--strongly felt especially when somebody, perhaps a tired resident  jeepney  driver, passes by one of these houses and smells the irresistible aroma of  daing na bangus  being fried for dinner, he smiles at the thought that he is coming home where meager living is never an absolute cause for despair; he takes pride in his children who would grow witnessing the multi-faceted life of Tondo, however poor such life can be, the stories of its people, including those mouthed by generation after generation of resident  tsismosas , will never be placed merely in the far-end recesses of the mind.    &nbsp;  ***    &nbsp;  That was a  one sentence  description of Tondo, a writing assignment from a Sociology of Literature class in college. Our prof, now National Artist for Lit F. Sionil Jose, wanted us to write about our hometowns--a one sentence description of it, on a whole sheet of paper. So what makes a sentence? The period. As in this: .    &nbsp;  One of  urlLink Ayen's  entries reminded me of my classes with Sir Frankie. We were at first enamored by the thought that a categoricaly popular Filipino writer would be our professor. Of course,  all  our professors were writers. Sir Frankie was different though: we didn't like his works, much less read them.    &nbsp;  But of course, the beer guzzling, hobnobbing, and a December tour of the Ilocos province with him and the whole class in a cramped coaster&nbsp;changed a few things. It didn't matter anymore if&nbsp;we thought  Viajero  was meant to travel on its own and never come back. Knowing the man was somehow enough.     &nbsp;   &nbsp;

        Woosh woosh       &nbsp;  That's 4-year old Tintinspeak for "go, go". I started talking to myself when I was four, a year that's cataclysmic for me and my siblings, but most especially for me because that was when Mama told me "you'll help me be the Papa to TJ and Tere now..."    &nbsp;  And so I started reprimanding the little me whenever I'd feel too lazy to get up from bed to prepare my baby sister's milk, or too&nbsp;pissed at&nbsp;having to wash my brother when he shouts "ateee tapos na kooo!" from the john--I'll get pissed because I'm too caught&nbsp;up in reading&nbsp;People's Journal (I read them when I was four--strange,huh. A sign of genius perhaps.Teehee).    &nbsp;  But of course no matter how many times I'd have to make milk for my sister&nbsp;or wash up my brother, I'd do them with a fervor, a loving fervor that's partly scared of my mom and sick of my siblings' whining. I love them more than anything in the world. And I'd say, "woosh, woosh", talking to little Tintin:    &nbsp;   Go stand on that stool and get Tere's feeding bottle from the sterilizer on the stove. Go get the soap and wash TJ and give him a bath. Go put that tabloid down. Go call your mom's office to remind her to buy vitamins. Go ask Nanay to change Tere's diapers. Go Tintin, just go.     &nbsp;  And now these people come into our lives, pretending to be helping us, but nailing us in the end. They don't have the single right.     &nbsp;  They don't have the right to imply to my siblings' faces that I mismanaged the money Papa had been sending us. They don't have the right to "give us advices" even. Our father doesn't even have the right to do that.    &nbsp;  He left us and it's his obligation to support us. Fuck, his money hardly stayed in the bank for a week. It's always never enough.     &nbsp;  I wish my parents never married so then we'd have Mama's maiden name instead. I wish they could all read this. I am ashamed of them. I ashamed of this name we're carrying.     &nbsp;  From this day on, I am&nbsp;cutting off all the connections I have with my father and his family. He left when I was four. He will be forever gone.      &nbsp;     &nbsp;     &nbsp;   &nbsp;

      I never thought I would ever want to kill myself. I was never the suicidal type. But last night, I cried myself to sleep, wishing I could just end it all.  But here I am again, woke up this morning and I almost forgot how miserable I felt the night before. I'm glad I am not brave enough, never will be, to do what I had wished for.  ***  "Beautician,nakatanggap ng death threat--nagpakamatay" -- Unang Hirit News item 7/15/04  How many crappy situations have I come across with,or gotten myself into, so crappy they're almost like death threats?   No, I don't have the ability to force Death upon myself. I couldn't think of a way that wouldn't be too gory or too dramatic. An acute pancreatitis like Rico Yan's would be too much of a blessing.   The root of all this?   My father. He who has left us when I was four and my siblings teetering in their walkers; when milk was always never enough, and Mama always out late at night.   I was never one to blame things on somebody. I am not an angry person even if I had the right to be so. In fact, I don't like angry people. Last night, though, I realized how angry I am and have been at my father.  Apathy and indifference have been my best friends. Not anymore.  ***  The heart is resilient. And I love life too much to be this gloomy, suicidal kid.  Hindi bagay sa akin.

       Touchdown   I arrived from Dakak Friday morning and have already bustled around town til Saturday night. It's going to be a long, incoherent entry as there are really a thousand things on my mind now.  I promised to write about the Palawan trip. I guess I should have written about it even when I was feeling too tired or too lazy. Because right now, it has just lost its appeal to be written. Perhaps I still am too tired.  Before the Dipolog/Dakak trip, Ninang wasn't doing well. Her system reacted to the change in her chemo drugs resulting in a drastic BP drop, delirium fits, and a heart that started to fail. I texted friends for Type B blood. Most of them responded with the willingness to donate; all of them with prayers. My best friend  urlLink Nina  texted that she was offering all her sacrifices for Ninang and our family. She was in the ICU for five days. In between, Nina and her partner Sam who is also my best friend, were texting me details about our Dumaguete trip in August. Both of us Sillimanians, Nina and I need to go back "home" soon. We will be bringing Sammie with us.  I digress again.  Ninang's home now. Cancer is a fierce enemy. But Ninang's even fiercer.    Paradise Found       The forty minute or so drive from Dipolog airport to Dakak in Dapitan City was alternately punctuated with verdant scenes out of idyllic postcards in the South. Zamboanga is beautiful and so peaceful that it belies everything that is said about this region.   Unlike Palawan, which everybody raves about, Dapitan is a charmer. It instantly welcomed me with its winding hilly trails, spontaneous waterfalls and a southern sun that didn't refuse to let up. The townspeople in motorcycles or "habal-habal" (3-5 persons riding a bike)reminded me of Dumaguete.  Dakak was beautiful.  I don't know if the rumors about its white sand were true, it's still beautiful that it was more like a vacation for me than work. I was having second thoughts about going because of Ninang's condition but I'm glad I went.  Dakak is a cove that strectches vast between two mountains. It's like a giant's open mouth, the beach its smooth jaws. The water is so peaceful, no waves lapping on the shore even in the changing of tides.   Kulas and I had a lovely time swimming. We were in the water from 3pm to about 6 in the evening. We were just there, alternately floating on our backs, the clear blue sky seemingly lifting up all the heaviness in our hearts.  I don't want to wax mushy but...  I'll try to write more, and better about it later.  Oh and I have a boy there. The owner's son was there. I didn't get his name even when I had so many chances to do so. I just called him Boy all the time. Had it been a couple of years back, I would have flirted and asked him for a drink. But it wasn't just because my fiance was there with me. It was just enough that I had a Boy who would occasionally lock eyes with mine on afternoons when I felt too hot in my olive green bikini and would approach and exchange pleasantries with my fiance instead...  ***  Kulas and I went to the Arms show at the Megatrade last night. Though I'm one for a gunless society, pistols are just so sexy. Kulas was equally so when he was firing his rounds at the Fun Shoot. We got a prize silver bullet keychain for a bull's eye.  It was a generally relaxed Saturday night. We were both tired from our trip that we just needed to loosen up. Had Sabrette hotdogs with sauerkraut and Dijon,plus mango-banana shakes from the adjacent Fruitana (it wasn't good,though as they used puree rather than fruit chunks). Oh and I got Murakami's "Wind-up Bird Chronicles" at Powerbooks whose new floor layout disoriented me.  Dead tired when I got home. I cleaned three rooms in the house earlier that I just didn't have enough energy to wait til Kulas got home. I dozed off and woke up to a quite Sunday morning.  I'm tired already and it's only 11 a.m.   Blog therapy. Days like this I wish I still smoked.

       Off again   Back here in Manila but leaving for Dakak tomorrow. Work work work. The Palawan trip will have to be another entry--nothing spectacular though. My days went in a blur since I arrived last Friday. Ninang is in the ICU. She's in a really bad shape due to complications of her cancer and the effects of chemo. Her blood presseure has dropped to 50 and her sugar is extremely high that she needs insulin. Our family needs prayers.   Sleep was disturbed last night. I drifted in and out of--not dreams nor nightmares--but something like a stream of thoughts that didn't let go and wouldn't want to let go.   I'll try to write another post later at home. Have to rush to the hospital now. I wish with all my heart that Ninang gets better soon.  I miss her...

       I'm leaving for La Union and Pangasinan tomorrow to do preliminary work on a video documentary I and the team are working on. Field work is always refreshing especially when you get to talk to the people in the communities we support, the fisherfolk always have their own--pardon the pun--sea of stories to tell.      I'm glad to be out of the office for a whole week. I need to breathe. I think the stress is catching up on me. I've been having headaches even when I'm asleep and when I wake up. The pain though is just on the right part of my head; makes me think I'm developing a tumor of sorts. My shoulders and back are killing me too. Scoliosis attack.       I hardly smile these days too. I miss it.       Count your blessings, Mama told me last night. I told her I'm having a hard time doing so because my life now is determined by the eight hours I have to stay in the office each day. Eight hours. By the time I get home, there are only a few hours left before I go to bed and dread the eight hours the following day.      It's like this everyday, Mama, I told her.       Then be thankful you have the other sixteen hours to yourself: to drive home with Kulas, eat with us your family, pick up that novel you've been meaning to read, drink your milk, shower, sleep, to dream and wake up the following morning, she said. That's sixteen hours outside your office,  anak . Be thankful. It's not that bad when you think about it really really hard.      Then the stubborn, rebellious part of me would insist, no, it is  that  bad. You don't understand, you'll never know how it feels to be trapped. That part of me would scream and tear my hair out, snap at people, wallow in self-pity and anger. That part of me would be ugly and would lose my smile because I refuse to accept things and move on  inspite of .      And so, I don't know. Mama's right I know. Maybe I just need to be a little bit braver and stronger than I really am. Maybe I just need to feed my monsters right. Or unleash them.      ***      My brother's wedding went well. The dinner was held in our house. We should have opted for a hotel or restaurant though. Decorating the house was exhausting. We rushed everything: bought fresh flowers from Dangwa Thursday morning, rushed to Divisoria for scented candles and yards of  organza  cloth, and supervised everyone in putting up a banquet table.      The newlyweds and the guests arrived at the house at around six p.m. and I, together with relatives who were left at home, welcomed them, blowing bubbles and showering them with flower petals and  bigas .  urlLink Borgy  did an excellent job with the flowers and the staircase. The house looked so regal and I almost wanted to get married then. Tatay and Nanay would have been proud of us. When people arrived though, I was still all  madungis  in my capris and polo shirt with my hair in a bun.      ***    My Japanese Sister       It's Ayvi's birthday today. We used to tell people when we were still in Silliman grad school that we were sisters--only that her father's Japanese and mine's Chinese.       I tried to reach her through her mobile phone and at work but couldn't get to talk to her. She's been silent for months. I haven't seen even my  inaanak  Isis for quite a while now. I miss my best friend, kindred soul, keeper of my monsters, Japanese sister, moon goddess...      Happy birthday, Ayvi. I know you're just there and I miss you.         ***        When you're on your knees you're closer to the ground. Things seem nearer somehow.        - Tori Amos, Introduction to "Death: The High Cost of Living"          Isn't she just right?

       My brother's getting civilly married tomorrow. Our family has been plunged into the whole thing all too suddenly. The would-be sister-in-law is four months pregnant and 18 years old.      My brother's life story could actually be straight out of a  Maalaala Mo Kaya  episode for all its color, drama, moments of glory and interesting dialogues here and there. Of course, TJ is the protagonist, the  bida  who has to go through all these convoluted scenes and make his way out of the knots he himself creates.      And I, I am the letter-sender who watches him on the sidetracks, occasionally berating him for messing up and always unfailingly cheering him on, empty beer mugs and all.      I harbor pessimism though.      He has gone through so much in his life already. He had broken his heart, has broken someone else's heart terribly (perhaps beyond repair), has made a lot of girls cry. For the girl he's marrying, he chose to leave a partner for nine years, thriving joint businesses, a very comfortable lifestyle and the security of a relationship tested by time.       What's in store for him now? He's jobless, penniless and unsure of what the future holds for him, his wife and his baby. I've been telling myself he shouldn't have left his partner because they had everything going for them. Nine years of being together is not a joke at all.      He shouldn't be marrying the girl   yet  .      But I understand his reasons and I respect him for it. I know he doesn't want what our dad did to us to happen to his baby. He loves the girl anyway, and that is a good reason.      But why am I still afraid that they'd just end up breaking up?      Why can't I have faith on their relationship just like I have faith on mine?      Perhaps it's just because I love my brother so much that I'm scared he'd hurt himself again. Perhaps it's my own bias kicking in. Perhaps it's because I'm currently reading Nick Hornby's  How to Be Good  that makes me all the more dubious of marriage.       Oh well. He'll be fine.  He'll be fine .

          I want to write something substantive for today; a good entry for the week,but I could only come up with mere ramblings straight from the top of my head. I am having such a bad time at work. I do not even want to think and write about it.  All I'm wishing for at this moment is that I could get out of here and finally do what my heart desires.  But there are bills to pay and a household to support, siblings to occasionally feed and pamper. No, I am not being hard on myself. I have grown living a life like this but I want to explore other lives now. A life of my own.   I can have it naman di ba?  I can do what I want. I just have to be brave about it and conquer what I fear most: failure. Everyone fears this anyway.  I am resigning from my job come December. I just want to finish my projects and other commitments here. I am not happy here anymore. Traveling (a perk really)doesn't even excite me as much. Hitting the snooze button at 6 a.m. again and again has become addictive. The boss, some people, the bureaucracy, and the sheer politicking drain me. The office has become an energy-vampire to me. Sad. I know I have to get out.  Impractical? But what is practical, really? Work is totally different from a job. I choose to have the former. Friends and even Kulas tell me not to resign until I find another job. Thing is, I don't want to be employed anymore! After saving (or trying) the seas for three years, I would be facing self-employment. Come 2005, I will be my own boss. Our House will officially open and teach art and creativity to kids and I will be doing "regular" freelance writing jobs. I will paint and mount my first solo exhibit. I will finally join the Palanca. I will teach writing and literature again. Best of all, there will never be a bundy clock for me. Ever.  Maybe I haven't done my best here. Maybe I have just been too selective of the times when I would do my best and show them what I can really do. I think that is just an indication that I am not cut out for this milieu. After all, I was not born to conform, be controlled. I need more freedom, space, choices.  This job is not bad at all. In fact, it has taught me things I wouldn't have learned from other jobs. It has brought me to places both literally and otherwise. It is for a cause I wholeheartedly support and adhere to. It helped me send my little sister to school (and she’s now a Swiss Air attendant).  But there are other things for me to do. I simply can't wait.
