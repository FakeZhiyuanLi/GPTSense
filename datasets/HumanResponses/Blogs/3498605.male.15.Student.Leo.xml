      I have been trying all weekend to get my website up on a free host but every last one of them sucks. The first one I tried was OK. I mean my site was fully functional, but it got deleted within an hour. With the second place I couldn't even access the site after I uploaded it and half the site got deleted upon upload. The third was by far the worst. First, they ask me for a $5 "donation" then when I finally get the damn activation code I need the next day I find out I can't even FTP to it. So, I go through the hassle of uploading five items at a time but come to find out when I finsh the entire site looks like crap. Oh well. I guess I'll have to try a site with ads which I REALLY don't want to do considering most of the ads are either spyware or porn. GOD DAMN FREE WEB HOSTS!!!!!!  later, bradleyJ

      Crap. It is only 10:23 and I'm already tired!. Luckily, I have a quick fix for that. It is a gum called BLACK BLACK and man does it mess you up. It is exactly like a drug because you get addicted to it like I have but it isn't illegal. This gum literally makes you twitch if you've had enough of it. YES I CAN FELL THE ENERGY RUSHING BACK! HAHAHAHA!  later, bradleyJ

      So, I got the new Beastie Boys CD. It is called "To the 5 Bouroughs" Personally, I think the Beastie Boys or "ok"  I mean, I never really "loved" them, but I still think there music is pretty good. For the most part, I like this CD. It is pretty good and has some good songs on it.

      Well, I guess I have to stop playing Halo now. Its not that I don't want to play or I'm to tired, its just my friend fell asleep while I was finding someone to play online. What an idiot. Well, I guess I'm going to go to sleep now that it is 5:38am. Although, I don't think I will be able to because the damn question has been bothering me since 11:00 and still is bothering me. Oh well. I'll post non-Halo related stuff later today.  later, bradleyJ

      Hey. It is now 4:20am and we are still going strong for Halo. We just got finished schooling a couple of rednecks in Halo. It was hilarious, because afterwards they were saying all this crap about us, and I burned them on everything they said. Then again, they are stupid rednecks, so it was pretty easy. Anyways, we aren't currently playing because no one is joining our game but I'm sure someone will join. Anyways, that damned question is still bothering me, but I'm sure I'll eventually get over it. Anyways, I'm playing lacrosse tomorrow which should be pretty fun. Also, expect more posts not about Halo because my gaming binge is almost over - lol! Anyways, back to Halo.  later, bradleyJ

      So, its about an hour later. For the last hour, we have been schooling some losers in Halo. It is so much fun becuase after we beat them, they curse at us and call us names, its hilarious. So, I'm still wondering about the question but I'm obiviously playing fine in Halo. I'm still really energized from the Amp, although, it is making me kind of sick. Anyways, got to get back to Halo. YAY!  later, bradleyJ

      Wow. My friend and I have been playing Halo since 2:30pm today. Currently, it is 1:34am and we are still perfectly energized and ready to play. I started getting tired around 11:30pm so I took a Mountain Dew Amp, and man does that wake you up fast. Anyways, I haven't been playing my best because my mind has been a little distracted on a question that can't be answered, regardless, we are still kicking some serious ass. Actually, we have only stopped playing Halo for about 30min when we went up to Luke's for dinner. Actually, the Amp is really making me feel weird. CRAP! now I have a headache because of the Amp and the damn question. Oh well, maybe more Halo, plus some advil will fix it. YAY! someone just joined my game so I'll post more later.  later, bradleyJ

      YAY! My friend is over and we are gonna play Halo online for nine straight hours. Now, you ask, how is the possible? Well, we have tons of energy drinks and we will be so amped up on caffeine we will be like superman and have super reflexes. Hell, maybe we will even try to fly! Actually, we will play nine hours of Halo then nine of hours of Dynasty Warriors 4 with maybe one break for food. So, if I don't post anymore it is because I am dead :(. -lol. I'm just kidding, I won't die. Anyways, time for the Halo binge to start. If we are really schooling someone I can probably talk online. Anyways, more HALO HALO HALO HALO HALO HALO!  later, bradleyJ

      Yeah, basically, for the last month or two, I have been trying to get someone that I will never have, or at least I'm 98% sure I can never go out with her which makes me sad. You know, randomperson1. I guess I just thought that since she was my friend, why couldn't she be more? She obviously wasn't interested, it was just my mind tricked me into thinking she was. Then, after she found out I liked her, I still thought, "Hey, maybe I still have a chance." Well, it is time for me to stop kidding myself and get over it. randomperson1 is still my friend, i'm cool with that, I just feel pathetic on myself for thinking she would ever like me. HEHE, you (public) might never see this becuase I don't know if I will post it because it is a complete mockery of myself, but then agian, everyone reading this, with the exception of a few people have no idea who I am, but still, I don't know, but if I do post it, you will be reading this now and you can laugh. WOW! that was one hell of a run-on sentence...lol :).  later, bradleyJ

      Love is so complicated, I don't know why, but it is. Maybe it is because the rewards of love are so great, or, at least that is what I am told. I wouldn't really know considering my last relationship was in 5th grade, which really doesn't count. Anyways, love is crazy. You like someone, then you basically wonder if they like you for a long time. Then if you have the guts, you ask that person out, you either get one of two extremes. On the one hand, they could say yes, and that would be great. On the other hand, they could say no, and then you get really depressed. Then, if they do say yes, you eventually break up, well, at least in high school, and then you become depressed. Oh well, in high school, 9/10 relationships don't last that long anyways, but it would still be nice to go out with someone though. I just had to say write this because I have been thinking about this kind of stuff for the last hour and I have a really bad head ache.  later, bradleyJ

      So, one day in fourth grade during class, Alec was being retarded, as usual, he said across the table, "Hey Brad, I bet you I can fit this dime up my nose!" Then, I said, "Sure, whatever, go for it, [under breath] retard [/under breath]." So, Alec stuck the dime in his nose. A few minutes later, I hear Alec making a weird sound; it sounded kind of like the dog in National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation, when it was under the table and choking on a bone. Then, Alec raised his hand and said while crying, "Teacher, can I go to the nurse, I have a dime stuck in my nose." The teacher then said, "Sure, but why is there a dime in your nose?" Alec didn't respond, he just ran out of the room crying while the enitre class laughed at him. He came back about 10 minutes later and he was holding a plastic bag. I said, "Hey Alec, whats in the bag?" Alec said, "Oh, thats the dime, the nurse pulled it out with some tweezers, and gave it to me." All I did was shake my head in disgust! Ahh, good times, good times. Anyways, Alec was a retard then, and he is even worse now, because now he is a stoner. Before, he was just retarded. Now, he is a a super high retard man. What a faggot! Anyways, I have to go to sleep because it is getting late and the effects of my energy drink is wearing off.  later, bradleyJ

      Just though I would let you know about some updates: 1. I'm working on a lot of funny stuff for this site - expect that in a few days 2. I'm sure my crazy antics of my everday life will either lead to something funny happening or personal injury, trust me, you will know if either happens - expect that in a few hours - lol 3. I'm starting up a security analysis company, so if you want me to scan your computer for security flaws, talk to me within the next week, because after that, I'm going to start charging people - ah yes, another benefit of being a hacker, you will never get hacked into! 4. I'm ordering up another supply of BLACK BLACK. therefore my posts should get a lot crazier 5. I'm begining to like someone, and no, it is not randomperson1. for now, this person will be randomperson2. 6. *pathetic*I may not have children in the future, because to this day I have gotten hit 3, almost 4 times.    DAMN YOU ALEC ORTMANNS! Speaking of which, I've gotten a pretty funny story about that kid. HEHE, I think I will save that for my next post!  later, bradleyJ

      Today I tought some people lacrosse. It was fun, except it was really hot outside and my friend bflan took a long time to learn. At first when he was cradling it looked like he was dancing. Then, while practicing dodges, I almost got hit in the same place I did in tennis. Furthermore, bflan was the dodgemonkey. Afterwards, we went to Taco Bell. On the way there we passed the infernal portal to hell AKA the Petco dumpster. It was hilarious, when I got home, I talked to the person who was supposed to show up, but didnt. This is exactly what she said, "OMG, that was today!" HAHA what funniness!  later, bradleyJ

      So, I was playing tennis today with some of my friends. Yeah, it was fun until the the last match. Basically, we were in a volley and my friend smashed it at me and the ball hit me in the...well, lets put it this way, it hit me where it hurt the most. Yeah, my friend who did that was being an ass. He though I was faking so he spiked balls at me while I was on the ground for 10 minutes. I mean, I never thought a little tennis ball could cause that much pain. I mean, the tennis ball is so light and hollow, you would never think that it could bring down someone in one hit. Anyways, I think I'm ok now, and we are gonna play tennis next week, becuase I'm not mad at my friend because it really was an accident. Anyways, I just thought I would share that. Oh, but before this post ends, I have to say something. On the tennis court we were playing on there was this random whole in the middle of the court, and it wasn't a small little dent, it was a hole about 2 feet deep and 1 foot wide, it was just so random. Anyways, I have been working on some pretty funny stuff for this site, and you should expect to see it in a few days.  later, bradleyJ

I'm teaching some people lacrosse, I'm going to a lacrosse camp at Loyola University, I'm going to a camp in Michigan with my best friend. That should be fun. Plus, I'm going to my lake house on Silver Lake, WI and I'm officialy working for my Dad's company doing work that normally a college grad would do. I mean, I'm actually going on site and setting up networks and stuff. Plus, I get $12.00 an hour, starting salary :). Also, I'm just going to hang out with my friends a lot. Anyways, I'm going to a Microsoft Seminar tomorrow in Downers Grove. It is for Microsoft Business Partners only and I'm going with my Dad's company. Seeing as I will be the youngest person there, and I actually understand what is going on, I feel very special :). Anyways, to all my friends who are reading this, I hope to see you a lot over the summer. If not, have a GREAT summer.  later, bradleyJ

      AGHHHHHH! I had three finals today. My first final was my french final. I found that to be really easy with the exception of the "Listening" section. Actually, I did pretty good on that final, I got a 84%! Then I had my Intro. to Business final. Easiest final ever. I literally finished within 30min. After that was lunch, which was fun, but boring. Finally, I had my Honors Biology final. I thought that was going to be my hardest final. I was very suprised by that final. It was exceptionally easy, and I finished 155 multiple choice/true,false/matching, plus 2 written esays in about 45min. It was also suprising because I didn't study for more than a minute for that final, yet, I found it to be REALLY easy. I just can't wait to see what I got on it. Although, I am REALLY pissed at my geometry teacher. I hate him even more now than I previously had. Basically, I took my geometry final the first day of finals. Now, it is the last day of school and this dumbsh*t still doesn't have the grades posted! I mean, WTF. That is really the only final grade I was worried about. AGHHHHH! Anyways, summer starts today! I am soooooooooooooo happy!  later, bradleyJ

      Man, I was just searching random things in Google Image Search to see what comes up and man did I see some horrible things. First of all, I just typed the word "Jesus" and the second picture that came up was this: http://www-users.cs.umn.edu/~lthomas/jesus.jpg . Now, I'm not saying that picture isn't hilariuos, but what if some little catholic kid typed Jesus and used that picture for a school report. The nuns at his school would beat the crap out of him, and its not his fault, he didn't know that was bad. So, I decided to type the word "Holy". Now, check this out: http://www.umbrart.com/images/holy.jpg . Yeah, that was the fourth picture that came up, and the only thing I could say to that is "WHAT THE F**K!" Now, that isn't even funny. That is just plain terrible! So, imagine this, a little kid is searching up a picture for a school report. He types "Holy" because his report is on the Catholic Church, and guess what comes up, PORN! I mean, come on, a religous word linking to porn! What has the internet come to! So, I decided to switch over to the regular Google search and I typed in the word "Dizney." I wanted to see what would come up if I mispelled Disney in a way that a young kid might spell it. So, I type it in and hit search. What comes up? The most disgust and worst thing imaginable. Basically, this is the title for the fist page that comes up, WARNING! THIS TITLE IS VERY BAD AND MAY BE OFFENSIVE TO SOME PEOPLE! THIS TITLE IS JUST AN EXAMPLE OF HOW BAD THE INTERNET IS AND IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY! So, here is the title "FREE CARTOON SEX! HENTAI, HEROES, DIZNEY, FURRIES, BONDAGE, TEENS ..." Honestly, that is the lowest a person could ever go! Soliciting, not only disgusting, but also illegal pornography to little kids! I mean, WTF!!!!!!!!!!!! I never though I would see the day where little kids would have to be constantly monitored online. I mean, If a little kid honestly searches for disney because they like disney shows, and the accidently misspell it dizney, they may click on the first site, and see some very, very bad things not even adults should see. Anyways, now, I am completely disgusted with some of the slimeballs on the internet today. As of now, it is my personal goal, as a hacker, to bring down these terrible sites, but flooding the crap out of them so the owners have to pay bandwith overcharges out the ass! Thats just my way of getting back out those slimeballs! MWAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAH! So, if any of you slimeballs are reading this, this is for you, "GO EAT SH*T YOU DIRTY MOTHERF***ING A** HOLES!!!  later, bradleyJ

Actually, I slept until 11:30. I think I'm just going to relax today and watch a movie, or maybe I'll go rent a new game from BlockBuster, and play it.

      YAY! I finished my first day of finals. Luckily, I don't have to go to school tomorrow because I don't have any finals. Although, I do have three finals the last day :(. So, finals suck. Especially my geomertry final. I wanted to finish within the first hour so I could hang with my friends for the 30-minute "buffer" period. Unfortunately I worked reall slow, becuase it was like the clock was taunting me, saying, "HAHA, HAHA, you're not gonna finish! HAHA,HAHA, you suck! HAHA, HAHA, go burn in hell!" I swear, if the clock was a human, it would be a little demeted goth girl sitting in the corner saying that with her head spinning around. She might as well have been spitting vomit out, and then it could of been exactly like the Exorcist. HEHE! Anyways, I'm sleeping in tomorrow while all, or at least most of the students at my school will be taking tests! MWEHEHEHEHEHEHE! No, I'm just kidding!  later, bradleyJ

      So, randomperson1 figured out I liked her. Oh, well. So, now I'm going to go back to not liking anyone and just being friends with randomperson1. I just don't want things to get weird, and I know she already has a boyfriend. Meh. Anyways, I probably won't like anyone for the whole summer, but I'm sure when school sets in next year, I'm bound to find someone. Anyways, I have to get back to studying, but first, the Tale of the Antichrist Browser, as promised. So, I was messing around with my browser, trying to set up a proxy server so I could get around the internet blocking thing at school. So, I'm talking to randomperson1 online, and she posted a comment on this blog that I really wanted to see. So, I go to check it out, but noooooo my web browser didn't work. So, I tried to fix at, and nothing worked. Then, my computer screen started randomly flashing. It was almost like my browser was the antichrist and was taunting me saying, "MWAHAAHAHAHAHA, you can't get on the browser to check the comment. Mwehehehehehe, I will eat you soul!" So, I got really pissed, and started hitting my computer. Luckily, all the random hitting of my computer made my internet work! HOORAY! I have defeated the antichrist browser! Anyways, that was the tale of the antichrist browser. Now back to studying, :(.  later, bradleyJ

      CRAP! I need to study for my finals that are coming up this week, but I can't. I just can't. It sucks. Its not like I don't want to study, its just I can't figure out what I need to study, so basically I just randomly go through my notes, not learning or reviewing anything, and it just wastes 15 minutes of my time. Another thing is, I really can't focus because I can't wait until summer which is like 3 days away. CRAP! I NEED to study, but I can't!

      So, I have decided to just be friends with randomperson1 for the time being, and I'm cool with that. I have started to realize she just sees me as a friend and nothing more. I really don't think the thought of going out with me has even crossed her mind. So, for now, I'm going to give up hope on her because of the above reasons and I'm only going to see her a few times over the summer, if that. Anyways, I have finals tomorrow, three of them to be exact. I'm really not too excited about those.  EDIT: CRAP! randomperson1 doesn't like me now because she has a boyfriend, nor will she ever like me. Meh. I'm still cool just being her friend. EDIT OF THE PREVIOUS EDIT: Actually, I don"t know for a fact that she will  never  like me, but I'm just assuming it to be true.  later, bradleyJ

      Yeah, so basically, there is this gum called BLACK BLACK, right. This gum is vey addictive, and is packed with caffeine. So, I decided to order three packs of it online. The gum itself tastes very bad, but it is so addictive you just want more and more. I ran out last weekend and I was very sad. Now, the BLACK BLACK has returned. I just found out that a friend of mine ordered some, and he is going to sell me some tomorrow. I'm so excited! YAY! MORE CAFFEINE! HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! Yes, caffeine, that is exactly what I need for finals! YAY!  EDIT: So much for that. Two of my friend in my biology class made me throw it out. :(. Oh, well!   later, bradleyJ

      God, this saturday sucks. First, I have to study for finals which really annoys me because it is really nice out and studying is going to waste most of my day. Plus, my parents are being really gay today. They are getting mad at me for no reason at all. AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH! Anyways, this will probably be my only post today because I have to study.  later, bradleyJ

      Finals. Wow. God, do they suck! but everythings has something good abut it. First the good! YAY Good! One good thing about finals is you get out at earlier. Another good thing is you have a lot of extra time to just hang out with your friends between tests. Now the bad! They are worth 20% of your semester grade. You basically take tests all day. Plus, the tests are REALLY long and REALLY hard. Oh, and if you laughed at that, you are one sick perverted mofo. :). Anyways, I'm really excited because I only have four days of school left. Although, I am kinda sad because when school is out I won't see some of my friends that I really like to see. Although, I will hang out with at least most of my friends of the summer, hopefully :).  later, bradleyJ

      So, the new Harry Potter movie comes out Friday. Yeah, I never really liked Harry Potter and I don't really understand why anyone does. I mean in the first one it basically drags on for two hours how Harry is so great for surviving a magic attack. First of all, how does an f***ing baby defeat a supreme dark lord of magic that was able to defeat Harry's parents, which were supposedly really powerful. I mean, it just doesn't make any sense at all. Then in the second movie there is Dobby. Basically Dobby is a complete rip off of Gollum from a much better series called Lord of the Rings. Except, Dobby whines a lot more than Gollum which I thought to be impossible, and Dobby is basically Harry's bitch. Then, at the end, a f***ing bird that weighs no more than 10 ounces carries a f***ing hat that Harry can pull an f***ing 9 pound sword out of. I mean, it is like when you see a tiny little clown car, and 20 full-grown men in makeup come out of it. Now, supposedly in the third movie, a dark wizard named Serious Black escapes from a prison. First of all, what kind of name is Serious Black for a f***ing dark lord. I mean come on, Serious Black, it sounds like it could be the "next" Power Ranger. Then you have the fact that the only people who can supposedly stop Serious are these weird creature/demons called Dementors. First, how does Serious escape from the Dementors in the first place. Once again, makes no sense. Personally, I think Rowling was just running out of ideas for books, but she really wanted the money. Then there is the fact that these "Dementors" have a very uncanny resemblance to the Nazgul of the Lord of the Rings. Furthermore proving the Rowling sucks as a writer and has made fortunes by copying and slightly modifing ideas from Tolkien. She is almost like a "Jewel" brand of soda over a real soda like Coca-Cola which is obviously much better. So, that is my overall summary and opinion of one of the worst stories ever. Sure, I may get lots of hate emails telling me that they are going to come and find me and cast magic spells on me, but when I receive those, I will laugh at how pathetically sad they truly are.  later, bradleyJ

      AHHH! I miss video games. I haven't played a lot of video games in at least 3 weeks. I have been too busy doing homework, talking to my friends online, playing sports, and other stuff. Not that I don't like any of those. Actually, I like playing sports more than I like playing video games, its just that I miss video games. If I didn't have to go to an awards banquet for LaCrosse tonight, I think I would play video games.   later, bradleyJ

      So, basically I like someone who we will call randomperson1. I've been wanting to ask her out but every time I even think of doing it, I find out she has a boyfriend. This sounds familiar, right? Yea, it was the beginning to one of my posts, anyways, I've been thinking and wondering, should I even try? I mean, what if she isn't interested in me at all? What if she turns me down? I mean, do I even have a chance? So anyways, I don't know if I should continue to like randomperson1 or not, because at this point, I don't think I even have a chance.   later, bradleyJ

      Man, I never realized how hard and complicated it was to start a band. My band is currently starting up and we still have a lot to do. Currently we have a lead guitar, lead base, drums, and a techno-specialist. Guess which one is my position. So now all we need is a recording studio (probably a basement). The key thing we are missing are lead and backup vocals. We REALLY need vocals. So far, we have one maybe two vocalist. Our base player's g/f will possibly sing back-up, and I will probably sing lead along with being the techno-specialist.  So currently we are looking for singers in our school. I'll keep you updated, and I will post the site address of our band's site once we actually make some music. Anyways, that is all I have for now.   later, bradleyJ

      YAY. My day has been so much better than yesterday. My stupid teacher didn't complain and I didn't get hit by a car :). Although, I have been thinking a lot lately............See, there is this person that I like, I mean REALLY like. For now, lets call this person randomperson1. So, I've liked randomperson1 for the majority of the year, but every time I think about asking her, I find out the next day that she has a boyfriend. It is so crazy. Oh well. I'm just gonna get back to my crappy homework, and my drawings which are also crappy :).   later, bradleyJ

      Yeah, so today has been about the worst day ever. First, I come to school and my History teacher tells me my grade has greatly dropped because of my HW even though I still have a "B" in her class. Then, the rest of the day went great up to about 8th hour. That class is the most boring class ever. Then 9th period in biology it just got worse. My lab partner is a complete moron and a jackass. Then, during the lab I have no clue what the hell to do because my stupid teacher didn't give us any instructions. Then after school it got the worst. First, my parents complain about my "low" grades which are "B's." Then I started to talk to the person whom I like because I figure that would brighten up my day, but no, she basically completely ignored me. So, I decided to take a bike ride to clear my mind. Man, that was a bad decision. First, it starts raining hard when I am about .5 mile away from my house then on the way back I got hit by a freakin car. The driver was a complete moron. He hit me on the side of the street when I was right in front of him. I mean, what a complete jackass! So, today sucks, and my life sucks. Hopefully it will get better as time goes on.  later, bradleyJ

      Well, I'm back from camp. I guess I'm happy to be home, but I really miss all of my friends that I made there. Camp was really fun, and I'm definitely going back next year. Oh, and while at camp, I accumulated many nicknames: Backback Splash Creekface Frosted Miniwheats It from the Pit Swamp Thing and thats about it. I also met some REALLY awesome people, like Zach aka California, Jeff, Laura, and Betsy. I also met some ok people like Paul, Dave, Scott, and Liza. Well, thats all for now!  later, bradleyJ
