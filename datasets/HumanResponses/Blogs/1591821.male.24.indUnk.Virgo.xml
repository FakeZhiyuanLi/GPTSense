      Good on you channel 7.  You take what is a great show from the ABC (vary rare I watched an ABC show) and then give it the Axe.  Why???  Cause you have no bloody idea how to schedule good shows.  First it was on at 10:30 on Monday nights (I think) and then it got moved to the 9:30 slot.  Why, as a pre-emptive strike to stop people from turning over to the other channels due to two high rating shows returning.    And then what do they expect... that people will just not turn over.  Are they for real.  If they had've left the show where it was, people would have watched it and it wouldn't be axed.  Good on you channel 7.  No really, good work.  Keep it up.  Hey, I'm sick of home and away, can you move that to a competitive slot so it can be axed too....?  q.

      Yes that's right folks... Bar night was back in all its glory last night.  The best part was rocking up at 10 and only having to line up in 5 minutes.  Good on the door staff for keeping the line moving.  Once inside it was packed (when it's at its best) and doing a quick circuit took over an hour due to the constant bump-ins to people who I haven't seen in a while.  Was a godd night.  Got very loose and just chilled for the night.  I must say, there was an abundance of very good looking girls there too which curli concurred with.   One thing that annoys me is groups of guys in so-called gangs.  So down the bottom of the eagle bar there was a blew.  I'm tipping about 20 guys.  Half shouting 1-1-0 and the others shouting something different.  Anyway its on and was all in.  Sounds on bodies hitting ashphalt and body blows from fists and feet.    Anyway I was paying attention to one guy stalking another guy and he gets into fighting stance.  His stance was pretty good too, bouncing on the spot, feet 45 degrees out and should width apart.  I'm thinking ooh someone's about to get hurt here.  Pity the guy kicked like a fucking pussy and so very slow.    His mate was the same.  I can only think that the've just gotten their white belts or something coz it was very very poor and if I were that bad, I wouldn't be using it.  If that's the standard of fighters from other clubs, they are in for a world of pain.    Speaking of which, I am hanging to get back to training again.  The knee is not too far off I am hoping.  Still a little bit of soreness but hopefilly a little bit of light training  urlLink here  will flush the remaining fluid out and I can go back into full contact again.  I better get cracking q.

      So last week I hear a radio promo for channel 10 bringing back Jackass!!  Fantastic news and a quick scan of the ever realiable TV Week confirmed my excitement.  So quarter to twelve rolls around last nite and on comes the MTV logo.  Now getting really pumped for their shenanigans and what do channel 10 do? They put on the bloody Osbournes.  Now don't get me wrong, they have their funny moments (especially the babysitter telling them to fuck off all the time!), but I would rather watch Jackass then a couple of pretensious teenagers with no discipline and their drug fucked old man.  So I wanna know which persons to blame... Surely not TV Week - they had to get their info from Channel 10 first.  So CHANNEL 10 - Get your bloody act together!  q.

      So plans are under way for two of my mates to do a working holiday (i guess) in the red center.  Part of me thinks jealousy, coz a working holiday somewhere different would rock!! Me would be behind a bar in the states somewhere.  But that's a dream that can only be reached in the next month, and that wont be happening (working holiday must be 25 and under).  I was nearly on one about a year ago but decided to be wiser and stay here.  Anyway onto the other part, I'm wondering if its just this months flavour.  I hope not, I hope they go and have the time of their lives.  Hell, if I had the opportunity and ability, I would.  Well, i'll miss em heaps but they are only a phone away and its somewhere to stay for a big road trip!!  Speaking of... one is underway to the gong in Jan.  I smell trouble.  better do some work q.

      So 8:30am I am feeling a lot of motivation.  I decide that I would finally do what I have put off for around 2 months now.  Yep, the big re-arrange.  So... 3pm later and I finally get to sit down.  I am happy with all the big stuff, it's just that I am not sure that I will remember where I put all the little stuff.  Maybe i'll enjoy it more tomorrow once my body recovers! q.

      Ahh the Harp.  You have put yourself right up there next to eagle bar.  How good is it when chicks kiss!! Nothing excites the place (well the testosterone side anyway) more that it.  They did a good job of it too.  Something I will never tire of.  On a humorous note, I was telling the 'dilemma' how she iced me when I went to say hi earlier in the night.  Tapped her on the arm and she kept walkin.  So anyway as I was telling her this (which she apologised for anyway :) ) the dj spins up.... boom boom boom ba da boom boom... ice ice baby.  Hah hah hah - unscripted comedy at its best.  I even got the 'did you rig that?'.  The boys were killen 'emselves laughing!  Oh oh - back to bar nite tonite :)   Wonder if theres any female canandian exchange students again this year that like to kiss each other again... time and persistence can only tell!  q.

      So am pretty sure the rig show is terrorising at 'the gong' this week to finalise some details before the new season which would mean that I stay home tonite (instead of harping it up).  But lower case q has twisted my arm so off to the pub I go.  Why do I like going out so much!!!  Oh well, live for now and suffer tomorrow.  Nah it wont be all bad, there will be people to look at :)  q

      Well, back to it once more. Lucky it has been a pretty easy morning.&nbsp; Good for me to get stuck into the coffee!! &nbsp; Probably wouldn't have been so bad, except one  urlLink fool  got me at 12:00, then 1:30 and then 3:30.  Not that I care, just why I am sleepy!  Is it Friday yet!?!?!?!?  Went and seen the rig-show beat canberra yesterday.  Pretty scrappy at stages, but fukin great standard to watch never-the-less.  Beat them by 20 odd points to I think, which is good going into playoffs.  Member #1 put up 38 shots in an unrelated story.  We all found it funny when he said that they were 20 points down and he then decided he would take out the scoring title!! He got it too, by .1 points!!!  The seems to be some sort of cataclysmic event coming.  Ok, probably not that big but it has been quiet of late so I guess I am just speculating.  But it's sorta like.... 'Do you hear that?' - 'I dont hear anything' - 'Exactly, that's what worries me'  Peace out rabbit. q

      Well, here i am.  Having other blogs out there before that have sort of dwindled over time here is a new one.  People change, life changes.  More so in the last 12 months then I can ever remember, but I guess things are working out allright.  So what's been happing at the moment?  Apart from my usless knee stopping me from competing, I am just doing my work thing.  At least the pay rise was a great bonus (specially coz I thought it was inclusive of super and not exclusive as it turned out to be!!).  Recently I have been watching from afar the events of   urlLink neurocam . I was bored and bouncing around blogs ( urlLink Katie Baby  ->  urlLink EgoTript  ->  urlLink Capcoincidence ) and had a read.  It all sorta sounded a bit 'out-there'.  I guess it's intention.  But nevertheless curiousity had me run a few basic leads.    Anyway, I threw out what I found out.  Mainly just to stir the pot I guess.  Interesting reactions.  But was asked to not play anymore so I just sorta watched.  I even ended up in a cash converters... apparently!!   Anyway, go there and have a read.  Well it's off to the regular tonight.  Will be intersting for a variety of reasons.  Prob shouldn't say to much coz of the public forum thing but even I don't have a clue where this particular thing will head and I am usually pretty good with foresight.  Take it easy - till next time q.

      So after a 3 month lay-off and a little bit of pain, I got out to it once more.  This time getting past warms ups and evern finishing the game.  Quite an accomplishment!!!  Even got on the score board.  Best thing is no soreness today.    So will have another run tonight. Here's hoping for a 2/2 success rate :)  And then wednesday nite - back to inflicting pain!!! oh how i miss it!  franky is still laid up in bed.  come back soon dude!  and the weatherman has issued a cyclone warning for the diamond valley area!!  shit to do - back later  q.

      You gotta love how, when you know you are in sooooo much trouble you still find it funny.  I can think of one situation that is digging deeper and deeper and spiralling out of control fast, I can't help but sit back and giggle.  I am in no way laughing at the people, but just how the turn of events led to where we are now.  AND how it isn't that much different to how it was two years ago (give or take few months?).  I am not even going to begin to forsee what might happen next.  I know I'll be there tho if needed.  I am though, a little disapointed that one thing different from 2 years ago is missing.  I dunno if I was being mislead.  I don't think so.  I just think how it all came about happening was the reason it couldn't go further.  Which i sorta laugh at coz i can see why.  But just a shame that's all coz i know there were outside factors doing their best to disrupt.  of which i have not forgotten.  I also know that I was in no position to be making choices as I was severly impaired, but is there ever a time when we are not impaired, even slightly.  How can we ever say a decision was made, that had no outside influence.  I dunno, maybe there are cases.  I dunno, I guess if you make the decision that is best for you at the time you can't really complain.  And the one thing that I am good at, is backing yourself in that decision.  Don't make it and then doubt yourself.  If you are anything like my you will have thought it out, even just a little bit.  Run with it, life can't turn out all that bad.  sorry if this is all to cryptic when read! wow - not sure where all of that really came from either. eh. q.

      Remember a little while back I predicted some sort of catastrophe.... well i am thinking it is imminent.  Time to keep out of the crosshairs I am thinking.  Majorly loose on sat nite too. Resulted in the first early nite in a long time.  Not as early as some though.... one person was quite upset when I woke her at 2:30pm sunday only to find out she had been asleep since 9pm sat nite!!!  Major sleep there.  The rigshow secured a berth in the granny.  good luck to them. shld be a killer final too!!  a must see.  And this coming saturday is bush's 23rd.  Ahh you gotta love Puggs, one to many funny moments in that place!!  must run q.

       - You don't remember the drive in  - You slept so heavy it felt like you were in the mattress  - You can't concentrate on one thing for more than 30 seconds  - You are day dreaming for sessions of 5 minutes and above  - You are still laughing at shit that happened last nite  - Your typing has a stutter from the shakes  Gonna back it up again tonite :)

      mmmm 2am finishes - who doesn't love them.  Especially when you are required at 8am.  Ahh the stories I'll tell my kids!!!  And in other news, the dilemma lost the problem. So in a little sadness I guess she doesn't throw away her life and is once again free to choose her own path.  Don't get me wrong, I am sure she would've made it work, but wow tuff choice.  Sadly there will be no eagle bar tonite.  One - i cbf and two - the second week usually doesn't pull the crowd.  Might opt for a quiet sip somewhere else.  Over  urlLink here  things have become a little more intricate with the  urlLink N  word saga.  I am too tired to even bother re-reading this for grammer and spelling.  Apologies up front! q.

      Yes, it is wednesday night again.  Can only mean trouble especially if  urlLink this  fool is in town for the event!  Once again off to the regular and most likely bump into the dilemma.  Frankie will be off to the doctors tonight for a 3 day stay.  Hopefully he'll be back by monday.  Went and saw the  urlLink team  last night.  All is well there, with some guys doing well in the malaysian open.  Good news.  Even better will be my return, hopefully on Wednesday night.  Will the knee hold up - well there's only one way to find out.  check you later, Slater q.

      So one name has popped up repeatedly.  Will put that in the memory bank. Also another lead has the names of those present on friday night.  I am sure through a simple process of elimination we will find out those responsible.  Odds on favorite that the same name will appear in this group too.  Then just match up the names to the photos I have been provided.  It's all too easy.  'Boy I'm glad I called that guy' - I AM that guy :) q

      I tried to use that 'post a blog from email feature' but it never came thru.  But I think I am probably to blame for that.  Now, memo to the turds on friday nite.  If you want to play with the big boys children, be prepared to get hurt along the way.  Don't be surprised when you turn around and there is 115kg of 6'4" anger behind you.  You will be punished and wether it is one person for the team or the group of you receiving the punishment - this is up to whoever i get first.  Remember this - what you did to my car, I will be returning.  And I WILL find out who you are.  It has already begun.  hmm is the above just for my own benefit?  probably.  I mean, they may never read this.  Either way - it will happen   q.
