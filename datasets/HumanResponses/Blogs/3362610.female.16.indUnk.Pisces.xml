      So I had a pretty uneventful weekend. It was fun tho. Saturday night, I went up to the Z's house for awhile with my dad. Then Kait came over and we just talked for like 4 hours and then went to sleep. We woke up at like 8:30 and went and got donuts while we were still in our pajamas. It was great. We were walkin through King Soopers wearing our matching weiner dog pants. All these lil kids were like makin fun of us, but we just laughed the whole time. Until we saw Mr. Murphy there. That was kinda freaky but o well. Then Sunday I just kinda laid around and came to my moms house and hung out. I met Louie, Ryan and Meghan at the park at like 1 in the mornin. We were layin in the grass lookin at the clouds and the sprinklers went off! I was soaking wet and Louie just laughed! Jackass. But we had fun. And then I had to come home and I slept until 2 this afternoon. It was awesome. Etta made me get up and go to lunch with her and mom. We went to Woody's. Then I dropped em off at home and went and changed clothes at my dads and then I picked up Kait and we came back here. We picked up the mothers and went down to watch the bike racing in Golden. Alex competed in his first pro race ever! It was awesome to watch him! We also met this guy Jared....hes our new big brother according to the sisters. Kait came back over and we had some more bonding time. It was fun. Its really great to be getting so close to her again. I think I have decided who I like but I'm not sure. Boys are so stupid. Matt called me and wanted to hang out but that didnt happen. Surprise surprise. Im going guy hunting this summer and Im gonna find cute ones. Man i want Calvin soo bad! I hope that works out! Alright well Im off to bed. Nighty night. ~*Chels*~

      So school is out. It's a bittersweet feeling. I truly miss seeing my friends every day. My last day was really fun tho. I'm gonna be Blincoe's student assistant next year. That excites me cuz I love Blincoe. He's like the coolest teacher ever! And then in photo i just screwed around the whole time. Off block was a lotta fun cuz Mel and Mone came over and we just messed around. Then English was awesome cuz me and Kait and Rissa were just bein dumb the whole time. I'm not friends with Amber and Lindsey anymore. I'm actually pretty happy about that because they are complete and total backstabbers.  They were basically just using me for my house. I wont put up with that from anyone so that doesnt really upset me. I found out they have been talkin shit about me. I really love how girls are so damn two faced. Like seriously its just awesome lemme tell ya. But I'm really startin to think there is something wrong with me. Like I have been invited to at least 2 parties tonight and I really have no interest in going to either one of em. I really dunno why that is, but its pretty weird. So Melanie blew me off last night. I just wanna say thats the last time I'm gonna go outta my way to call her. I'm sposed to hang with Kait tonight but she hasnt called me yet. She better or else I think I might just scream. O god so tonight...at Timmy's graduation party...I saw DREW!!! AHH! It was way awkward for me, but he came over and was talkin to me and wanted to hang out again. I started laughin at him cuz I thought he was kidding! But he said that he wished he lived closer to me so we cud hang all the time! Man he is sooo hot! I'm gonna try to hang with him at least once this summer. That's the only thing I wud want to do. I wud go to Iowa or somethin but I can't cuz of my tattoo. Yea so I'm sick of typing again so I will just write more some other time. Call me when ya get a chance Mone.

      Ok so I wud really just love everyone to know that just because girls get in pissy moods doesnt mean they shud be bitches about it. I mean seriously. Sometimes it really isnt someones fault if they arent allowed to have a party. They dont just say that to piss other people off they really cant have one! I wud also like to say that I officially hate girls and I really cant understand how I can be such good friends with them. LOL actually at the current time Im not! so I withdraw my previous observation. So school is out tomorrow. Thank god. I dont have the best grades but at this point I really dont care. I really wish I cud just transfer schools and get it over with. Ya know...it really isnt too late to do that. I'm seriously considering asking my parents if I cud move to Iowa or like transfer schools for my last 2 years. I think that wud be the highlight of high school for me if I cud. I honestly dont see a reason in staying at shit ass G. The girls are very very mean (with the exception of maybe 3) and will stab you in the back for anything. And the guys are total assholes. I really wish I cud just find a boyfriend away from G that will treat me with respect and not be so fuckin stupid. I also wish that Kevin wasnt so damn confusing and wud make up his stupid mind. Ok so I'm sick of typing right now so I think Ima go call Simone so I can talk to someone that actually cares about me.

      Ok well today is a little better. I finally talked to Kevin and figured out what the hell that was all about....lemme just say that junior boys are really really stupid and make up bull shit so never believe a junior boy! Ok so moving along...I worked out tonight and it was a good stress reliever and I think I am finally startin to see a change! YAY! ok so I'm a nerd I know but ya get used to it. LOL yea well this entry was kinda pointless cuz I've been tryin to write it for like 10 minutes now but I am also talkin to Katie, Simone and Lindsey AND I'm textin kevin so things are a lil hectic right now. I'm gonna go finish some bio homework!

      So I really don't think I can imagine having a worse day. Seriously. It's like I always have a few really really good days and then it all has to just go to shit one way or another. Yea so I know I'm a girl and I prolly get pissed off at the stupidest things, but I really can't take people's bull shit anymore. So I would say it is definately mostly guys...but on top of that...my car freakin squeaks! Now I know I shouldn't freak out about it, but it is seriously sooo humiliating and I can't take it either. Thank God my dad is letting me drive his car tomorrow cuz otherwise I don't think I can take it! That's one of the only things going good in my life....that and my mom and I haven't been fighting lately..knock on wood. Ok so one question...if you do stuff with someone do you just go telling the whole freakin school? Well I don't. And I sure as hell don't go makin shit up either. But maybe that's just me. O well I'm gonna go so I will just talk to yall later.

      Hey guys! Well I am super dee duper bored right now. I am up late talkin to Crysta and waitin for Simone to call me. These past few days have been pretty hectic. I went to a party at Tom's with Sammy, Linds and Amber and it was ok I guess. I wud say the highlight of my night was seeing Matt there and talkin to him. He is so hot! I wish he wasnt graduating this year:( But anyways, Saturday I went to the Rockies game with Amber and we had fun. Then, we went out for ice cream with Iris and we met up with Brandon and Cory and Jesse. They came over for a bit, but I was texting Kevin almost the whole time. He promised we wud hang out this weekend and we almost didnt until today. He came over for a few hours and we pretty much watched movies and talked the whole time...with the exception of about 20 minutes of some good kissing! Lol! Well I'm off to bed since I have to go back to hell tomorrow!

      Yea so I really don't care about anything at all anymore. I am the only person I know that doesn't have a guy out there that cares for them. I'm really not. I started crying tonight. Stupid I know. But I just get soo frustrated sometimes that I really can't take it anymore. Lindsey made me go to Tyler's house with her. Again. This time was even better then the last time because another couple was there. It was awesome lemme tell ya. We went driving around....me, Linds, Tyler, Joe, and Kirsten. That's it. If you ever have felt like the 5th wheel then come talk to me I've got a great story for ya. I'm supposed to hang out with Ben and Lindsey tomorrow. I really dunno if that is actually gonna happen. I might hang out with Molly instead. These last few days have been pretty uneventful. I spent all day Thursday with Kait. We saw Harry Potter and then hung out at her house and then went to her LAX game. I went out with Linds and Sam that night but didn't do much and then Kait came over and spent the night. I went shopping with Kait on Friday and then Linds and I hung out. We were gonna go to a party in Genessee but the weather was really starting to scare us so we just went to her house and watched 2 Fast 2 Furious. It was fun. We made popcorn and turned down all the lights like in a movie theater. I spent today with Kait. We just hung out and watched Drumline and Bruce Almighty. She wanted me to go on a double date with her tonight but I had already promised Linds I would go over to her house because they had company. I have that really alone feeling again. I really don't know why that is but I do have it. I wish people wouldn't get so mad so easily. Especially when things aren't other people's faults. I never knew girl language was so damn hard to read. It turns out that if a girl says something she means the exact oppposite. I know most girls are like that with guys, but I never knew they were like that with their friends. Well to all of you that are mad for one reason or another I'm sorry but it isn't my fault you are so damn confusing. Well I'm gonna go...I have a looong day ahead of me tomorrow. ~*Chi-Chi*~

      Ok so Amber and Iris are leaving on Friday for California! Farewell to you both I will miss you! They won't be back til the 3rd of July either. How sad :(. Ok so these last few days have been really interesting. On Friday night, I hung out with Amber, Lindsey and Corey and we had a lotta fun. We just sat at my house and watched Lord of the G-String. It was interesting to say the least. I was payin more attention to Corey then anything else tho. On Saturday, Linds and I got invited to this really hot guy, Ben's, party. It was up in Genessee and was SOOO much fun! We played this game, Beer Pong, with some really cute guys....Ben and Tim and Lindsey made me drink everything cuz she wanted to get me drunk. She had just a lil tho so it was kinda tough gettin her back to my house. I talked to Corey for 3 hours on Saturday night. We were both pretty drunk, but it was interesting. He told me that he likes me too and we were supposed to hang out but we never did. During the day on Saturday I hung out with Angela and Dee and we had soo much fun! I really miss all of my friends that have been out of town. I really do. On Sunday, Dee and I got together and looked at her pictures from Hawaii. Then I hung out with Crysta, Garret, Stephanie, John, Josh, and Spencer. We sat at Jillian's and then went to Garret's house. He has the coolest house in the whole world! And it is soo huge! So on Monday...Lindsey and I went and met up with Crysta, Lyndzi, Charli, John, Kyle, Garret, Colby and Sean and we went to Tyler's boss' house. We played with the slot machine and played some card games. I had about 10-12 shots of Jack Daniels and Skyy Vodka and lets just say I was drunker then I have ever been before. I do not remember the ride to John's car or the ride from his car to my house. I guess we made out a whole bunch but I really don't remember too much of that. The only way I know for sure we did was because I have a hickey on my chest. I came into my house and bounced against the walls and then went downstairs and started puking. I stayed up until 2 throwing up and then I passed out and finally made it into my bed. I had to pick my mom up at the car place really early the next day and it was hell. I was soo hungover that I threw up again. That night, Tuesday, Lindsey and I went with her friend Tyler to his friend, Chris', house. My god those boys are soo damn cute. Chris said he wants to get to know me better and there might be a future there so that makes me really excited. Lindsey got drunk and I had to take her home. Today, I slept in until like 1:30 and then Amber, Danielle and Iris came over. We were supposed to hang out just for the day, but they kinda stayed longer then they were supposed to. We ended up going to Lindsey's horse show at the Fairgrounds together. I left my cell phone at my house and everyone else left them in my car for some reason...it was really weird so we all missed a whole bunch of calls. I was supposed to get together with Sammy, but that might wait until tomorrow or Friday. Kaitlin is finally back in town I am so damn excited! I think I am supposed to get together with her tomorrow to look at pictures from Hawaii and we might go and see Harry Potter finally. I am really excited that she is back because I have really missed her and our friendship. She has been my closest friend since like 6th grade and I don't really think it is possible to not have our friendship around. I got another email from Nicole today and I might hang out with her soon. That would be fun as long as there is no alcohol or weed involved. Well I'm sick of typing so I will just write more later. ~*Cheech*~

      Yea so I'm in a really bad mood right now. Parts of me just want to explode and get it over with. Amber got mad at me again last night and then apologized this morning. She even admitted that she always takes shit out on me and I can't stand it. I put up with soo much shit from that girl that I really need to take a break from it all. My mom told me that I shouldn't hold a grudge and forgive her since she was making such an effort. But then I talked to Simone about it and I basically have to say fuck the effort. People that actually care about me are home now and that's all that matters to me. I'm really sick of everyone fighting over boys. I've just figured out that I can't really introduce anybody to anyone anymore because then I have to put up with their shit. Right now, I really know the people that actually care about me and will put up with me no matter what. Those people are Simone, Kaitlin, Sammy, Andrew and Ches. Cisco invited me to a party with him tonight but I dunno where it is. I think it would be a lotta fun to go to and meet some new people but I dunno I'm kinda afraid of it too. Kaitlin is finally home and she wants me to go to a movie with her tonight. But she has a lacrosse game in like Parker soon so I really dunno if that is gonna work out. I would hate to be invited to 2 different things and then just not do anything. I might call Nicole and see if she wants to go to the Arvada party with me. I dunno. Right now I am still really pissed off and there are many reasons for that that I don't feel like writing so I'm gonna go. ~*Chelsea*~

      SIMONE COMES HOME TODAY!!!! WELCOME HOME SIMONE!!! Ok so I guess I need to do more catching up. I promised myself I would write in here everyday to keep Simone updated while she was gone and that really isn't workin out so well. So on Saturday night, Iris, Amber, and their friend, Kira, came over and we went to dinner at Johnny Rockets. Linds met us there after a while and Neil was our server. We also saw Nick and Robb there so it was like a reunion! We went to D West after dinner and met up with a bunch of the guys. We all got really bored so all the girls loaded into Lindsey's truck and then all the guys loaded into Cody's car. It was Cody, Jesse, Brandon, Cory, Tejas, and Zach. We drove around and did Chinese Fire Drills everywhere. It was soo much fun! We did one at a red light in front of these kids at a bus stop...it was soo funny I couldn't stop laughing. Then, all the girls came back here and Linds went home and we watched Sweet Home Alabama and then went to bed. On Sunday, the girls left early and I just kinda lounged around. I got really bored so I started to make a collage for myself and I found some great pictures for it. Sunday night, Sam and I went to Lindsey's and hung with her for a bit. Then, we went to her barn and sat at a gas station for awhile. We went to D West and got hit on by these really weird kids that are always there. They wanted us to follow them to a gas station but we wouldn't. Then, a really creepy van parked next to us with these 2 black guys in it. We thought we were gonna get shot. We all had to be home early so thats what happened that night. Yesterday, (Monday) I hung out with Crysta and Charli and we ran errands and then went shopping. We met up with John, Tim and Eric. John kept hitting on me which is really sad since he has a gf that hates me (Yankee). So I came home and then went to get Sam and we went to my moms house. Amber, Iris, Linds, Andrew and Austin came over and we just screwed around watchin movies and such. The boys left and Sam had to be home at midnight so we took her home. The other girls spent the night and we watched Sixteen Candles and Can't Hardly Wait. We didn't go to bed until like four this morning. We had to wake up at eleven so Iris could go to an appointment and me and Linds did not want to move. We finally got up and took a movie back that had to be back by noon. I am excited because I think I am gonna hang with just Linds tonight. She has been having a really hard time lately because Crysta is being stupy so yea. I really have a great time when I hang with Linds cuz she is just so fun! Max and I have been writing emails back and forth and Louie admitted to me he liked me. The guys called me drunk the other night and Jason told me that Sky is in love with me. I don't believe it but it was funny at the time. He also told me that Ben and Alan did too but I highly doubt that. Then Louie and Ryan called me drunk and Louie wanted me to have phone sex with him. I told him good luck gettin home at 2:30 and then hung up. The Hawaii people come back on Thursday! Man am I excited! Well I guess that is all I can write for now...but call me when ya get home CHA CHA! ~*Cheech*~

      Ok so I really havent written much lately so I'm gonna have to catch up here. On Wednesday, I went to dinner with my mom and her friends and Sammy came with me. We were sposed to go see Harry Potter, but we hung out with Lindsey instead. We just went to her house for a bit and then we went to Jamba Juice and met up with Andrew and Ches and just sat there for like an hour and a half talking. It was fun! So then on Thursday, I went to the Creek with Amber, Iris, Linds, Danielle, Ches, Andrew, Austin, and Evan. We were there for a couple hours and we got tubes and such. Most of us just tanned and listened to music the whole time tho. The water was freezing and there was no sun so I didnt want to freeze to death. Then we all went to Quiznos for lunch and we had a lotta fun. I gave Danielle a ride to dance and then just came home and relaxed for awhile. Then, later that night, Ches, Iris, Lindsey and Amber came over and we went to D West. We were meeting my friend Mikey and his friend Luis there. It was really funny tho cuz they pulled up next to it and we didnt even realize it! So they went into Wendys thinkin we were in there and Mikey ditched Luis to go to the bathroom. So Luis went and talked to Blakelee, Alex, Cheryl and Kayley thinkin it was us. Ha! Surprise it wasnt us! They were bein total bitches tho and pretending that they didnt know which Chelsea he was talkin bout and they said they knew a bunch of Chelseas and all this shit. Then they told him they thought he was cute so yea I think they were just jealous. Stupid Beeches. So everybody just came over to my house and we watched Enough and then everyone had to be home by midnight. Friday, I had to help my parents with the Garage Sale and then Amber came over. We just screwed around and watched some movies and then we got ready and saw Stepford Wives at 10:10. Austin and Louie kept callin me tho. So we met up with Louie and Thom after the movie but just for a bit. They didnt have anywhere to go to spend the night so they were tryin to mooch off of me. So we just kinda left. We came home and like passed out and woke up pretty late this mornin. Amber had to go meet her family for lunch so I'm pretty bored. Marissa finally wrote me an email and Angela finally wrote me back! I'm excited cuz Sam got her license and so did E! Simone comes back really soon and all the Hawaii people will be back on Thursday! Lindsey will be back from Limon tomorrow! Everyone is gonna be comin back I'm so damn excited! Everyone keeps saying this is their best summer ever and it really isnt mine yet. I really miss everyone! So I'm just really excited for everyone to get back so I can finally start the summer off with a bang! Ok so I'm bored with typing...sorry Simone :( I will try and write more for ya later! ~*Tater Tot*~

      LOL ok so that's just what I am listening to. But yea today has been kinda bittersweet. Simone left today for Mexico. She will be gone for a week. Kait and the Hawaii folk wont be back for like another week and a half. Sammy is finally back tho! I'm so excited cuz now the fun really begins! I got my car fixed yesterday. I'm really excited cuz I'm sposed to hang with Linds tomorrow and Sam either tomorrow or on Thursday. It's great to have some people home for once. Even tho the majority of people are still gone. I was supposed to hang with Amber and Iris today at Water World. But I really didn't want to go because I know that they would have made me drive and I really felt like the fifth wheel because they had all of their friends going and then it just wudda been me. O well. I'm glad I didn't go tho cuz I don't think I would have had that much fun. I'd rather save my money and go with a group of people that I actually know and can get along with. Plus, I can just enjoy the pool and tanning experience in the privacy of my own backyard. So thats what Ima do for most of the summer. I'm having some major boy dilemmas. I really dunno who I wanna focus on right now. I know its summer and I should just kinda be playin the field, but it would be nice to have a main guy for the summer. Even if it's just a summer fling it would still be nice. Ok well I gotta go run some errands so WELCOME HOME to everyone and FAREWELL I MISS YOU to everyone else! ~*Chels*~

      Ok so first of all, I'm absolutely exhausted. And I feel really bad cuz Louie and Megan and Ryan are coming over for awhile soon. I would cancel and say lets do it some other time, but I have bailed on them like the past 3 times or so and Louie is start to think I'm not interested. To be honest, I really dunno what I want anymore. I truly feel like they are playing pass the girl or something because I am being passed from Ryan on to Louie. It's kind of flattering I guess cuz that prolly means Ryan never said anything bad about me but it still feels very much like I am being used. Blah ok new topic.  So Kait wrote me back again tonight! I was really excited because I am able to talk to her a lot more than I thought I was going to be able to. Tonight I hung out with Lindsey and we did a bunc of random stuff. Including making me pee in a men's restroom because I had to go so bad and Linds was in the woman's. We hung out with a bunch of different guys....Louie, Ryan H, Ryan W, Colby, Scott, Byron and Zach. It was fun but interesting. But I think Colby is finally starting to warm up to me. I'm happy about that just because I think hes a real cool kid so I just wanna be better friends with him. Umm I can't really think of what else to write so yea I'm off to wait for Lou to call me! ~*Chels*~

      So I had a blast yesterday! Amber, Iris and Lindsey came over and we swam for quite awhile. Night swimming is sooo much fun! We got bored so we decided to drive around in our swiming suits! We went to Denver West at like 10:30 and then we just started following random people around. We went around the roundabouts a million times. Then, we were leaving D West and Lindsey yelled Chinese Fire Drill so we all busted outta her truck and ran around the car! I almost lost a shoe and my top almost flew off! But it was hilarious! We did it two more times in my neighborhood and then we finally landed back at my house. Lindsey went home and we watched EuroTrip and Club Dread! EuroTrip is hilarious! We didnt go to bed until like 4 in the morning but it was worth it. Kait finally wrote me back yesterday so I was really excited about that! Today we swam and I am finally starting to get tan. Thank God! Note to Self: gotta watch Cruel Intentions, Super Troopers and Slackers with the Chickens! I was sposed to hang with Louie last night but my phone was freakin out so that didnt work out. I feel bad cuz I really like Lou! But there are other guys in my life to think about so yea I dunno. But no drama cuz its summer dammit! Well I gotta go start gettin ready cuz I think I'm hangin with Linds tonight so laters! ~*Chelsea*~

      Lol ok so don't ask me why I named it that...I just did. So today was a lot of fun. I went shopping with Simone and her neighbor Janine. We had a lot of fun. I got 3 skirts and 3 shirts. Then tonight Simone and I went and saw Shrek 2. We went to Wendy's and hung with a bunch of people there...that was some fun I guess. I'm really glad that I have someone I can just rely on like that. Kaitlin wrote me back today! I was soo excited because I miss her soo much! I have to stay up really late so I can talk her! LOL the sacrifices I make! So that's one of the reasons I'm up so late...another one is that AJ and I are fighting and there is a really loud college party goin on behind my dad's house. O I went swimmin for the first time today! I was way excited...its the first time all summer! So the guy situation is really pissin me off because ppl just cant take hints and they do shit right in front of your face to make ya jealous. I'm so sick of this middle school bull shit. I wish people had enough guts to just tell someone when they like them. I know I have to be like that and its hypocritical because I'm not like that, but I think I cud change if other people wud change with me. Ok well I need to go play a game or somethin to keep me awake! ~*Chels*~

      Yea so the weather is really startin to piss me off. Don't get me wrong I love the rain....but it just needs to make up its mind. I can't stand it when it rains for like 5 minutes and then just stops. I need a full out thunderstorm! I know that makes me weird and all but hey Simone understands me! So I'm sick and tired of people using me and pretending like we are friends. If we are such good friends then why dont you ever wanna hang out with me? huh? k sorry just had to get that off my chest. My pool is finally ready to be swam in! I'm so excited....except of course its raining but o well. I'm gonna get to see Calvin soon so I'm waaay excited! Which reminds me....I need to find the perfect outfit for his party...hmm. So Kait left today. I hope she has an awesome time down there. The only down side to it is that now Kait, Molly, Dee, Max, and Marissa are gone for 2 weeks! So I wont get to hang with any of em for awhile. And Sammy is gone til Monday. Nicole is still mad at me for some bogus reason and Simone heads off to Mexico on Tuesday! Damn everyone just seems to be leavin. I wud hang with Melanie but she doesnt seem to think I'm good enough for her anymore but whatever. Matt H called me yesterday and really wants to hang out...its kinda weird but I dunno. Theres another feeling from that too I'm just not quite sure I know what it is. Well I think I'm gonna try to go entertain myself....Simone call me when ya get off of work if ya can! ~*Chels*~

       Alrighty I should prolly update this. Last Thursday night, Iris blew me off and hung out with Amber and Lindsey and then went home. On Friday, Amber came over and we worked things out and then got ready for that night. Kait came over and we all went to Zach's house to watch movies. We watched Gothika and Tommy Boy. We had a lot of fun and there were tons of people over there. Early Saturday morning, we picked up Kaitlin and went downtown for the Buffalo Bill Days parade. It was like 2 hours long and we sat with my mom, her friend Beth, Beth's daughter, my dad, Amanda and her mom. Afterwards, Kait and I walked around down at the park for awhile and saw a ton of people. We both got cold so we went home. I went over to Nicole's and then we went to her boyfriend Kenny's house. We ended up at Faith's house in Genessee with Charlie, Jake, Andy and Kenny. Cole took me back to my car and I came home and then went over to David's house. I met Ryan, Louie and Colby there. They were all drunk and decided we should go down to Buffalo Bill Days. The minute we got there, they ditched me to find some other chicks. I found Amber, Lindsey, Iris, Danielle and Chelsea and realized they had blown me off. Then I saw Kait and Sammy who had also blown me off. It was quite a night. I finally got the guys to take me back to my car so I could come home. I didn't get home till late, but I still had to pack. Sunday morning, my dad and I left for our roadtrip to Iowa. I got to drive for about 3-4 hours of it. We got to my grandparent's house and just visited with them for a bit. The next day, we went to lunch with my grandparents and then met my Aunt and cousin back at their house. That night, we went to dinner at my other grandparents' house. Ashley and Trevor came, too. After dinner, Ash and I took Trevor to the pool and then went to my cousin Eli's house. We stayed there with him and his roommate Dustin for awhile. Then, we went to my uncle John's house and visited with him and Theresa for awhile. Ash finally took me back to the grandparents' house and we saw  Tyler. My dad let me drive home and I stayed up playing cards with my grandma. We woke up early on Tuesday to go tubing with my uncle Tom, aunt Terry, Andy, Alex, Jeremy and Billy. It was a 2 hour drive to Eldora and then it took us about 4 hours to tube down the Iowa River. We ran out of beer after 2 hours. It was very sad. I rode with Alex, Jer and Billy and we ran some errands before we got home. I took a quick shower when we did and then Alex, grandma, dad and I met Ashley and headed over to Tom and Terry's for a barbeque.After we ate, Ash, Alex and I went on a walk around their property and then went up to his room. (Ask for more details about that experience ahem Simone ahem). Alex came over and spent the night but Ash had to go home. Alex and I stayed up until about 3 am just talking. It was actually a really good experience for me. We just kinda hung out on Wednesday and packed stuff up. Alex, dad and I went to Casey's for awhile and just cried and talked about life. It was sad, but really really good at the same time. I really enjoyed connecting with Alex on that level. Then, we went to Tom and Terry's and took some pictures with baby bunnies and the dog. Afterwards, we headed back to the grandparents' for the final goodbyes. Dad and I headed to Omaha and met my aunt Shirley for dinner. We finally hit the road late and I got to drive for another 4 hours. We got home at like 2 am and did some unpacking and then hit the sack. Yesterday, I went and got my hair highlighted and then rented some movies. I saw Nicole for a bit and then came home and watched movies. It's been pretty uneventful and I have a strong feeling that none of my friends want to hang out with me anymore, but whatever. I'm gonna go jump in the shower so I can go shopping with my daddy. ~*Chels*~

       Ok so it has definately been awhile since I updated this. So last Friday, Amber came over and we just hung out for awhile. Amber, Iris, Kait and I went to see A Cinderella Story that night and we had a lotta fun. After I took Kait home, we went to Cisco's cuz he was having a party. It was ok I guess. We took Iris home and went back for just a bit so Amber could make $10. Amber spent the night and the next day, I went to the Rockies game with my dad. We left the game early and I met up with Kait and Amber and we went to Cisco's again. Scott, Austin, Evan and Drew were there so we hung out with them for awhile. They left and Scott got some alcohol so we went up to Austin's house and drank it in some land next to his house. Amber, Kait and all the guys got really drunk. I didn't drink at all because I had to drive home. It took a long time to get Amber settled in but we finally managed. On Sunday, Kait left and Amber stayed for awhile. She had to leave tho so I just spent the rest of the day with my dad. On Monday, my mom and I went to Denver for the day. We saw the Notebook and did some shopping. We had lunch at the Hard Rock Cafe. That night, I went and saw A Cinderella Story with Lindsey and then we just hung out at Denver West and met up with Ben, Crysta, Charli, Scott, Andrew, Evan&nbsp;and Vince. On Tuesday, my dad and I went and got perfume and a few misc items. Amber was supposed to hang out with me that night but she blew me off to hang out with Lindsey and go to Crysta's party. I didn't want to go because that would make my mom mad and make me very uncomfortable. I stayed home and watched SWAT with my mom instead. Brenden is finally back in town so I talked to him for awhile that night. Yesterday, I spent most of the day with my dad, but I ran a few errands with my mom. My mom and I went to dinner at Woody's and then came home and just screwed around. Simone was supposed to spend the night but her mom is a evil woman and wouldnt let her. Today, I woke up really late and came over to my dad's for awhile. I might have Iris spend the night tonight but if not I will just hang out with my mom because then I am gonna be gone for 4 days. It's really interesting to learn who is your friend and who isnt when a party is involved. O well I'm gonna go take a shower so I will update later.

      Ok so I have learned a lot about myself these last few days. So on Saturday night, Lindsey, Amber, Chelsea, Iris and I went and saw Sleepover and then we went to Zach's house afterwards. At his house we watched Nightmare on Elm Street Part 2 and part of EuroTrip. Amber and Iris spent the night that night. On Sunday, I went and saw SpiderMan 2 (yes again) with Timmy, Meghan and Sean. On Monday, I hung out with Sean and some of his friends. Tuesday, I went to the river with Linds and Amber and then Kait came over that night and we watched Spice World. Linds was over for a bit but not for very long. Yesterday, my mom and I went shopping at Flatirons. We had fun and I got some really cool stuff. Last night, Kait, Linds, Amber, Iris and I just drove around bein stupid for awhile. We met up with Scott, Andrew, Cisco, Drew, Tyler, Ian and Cisco's friends at Wendy's. It was actually a lot of fun. I am really really stressed out right now and I really didn't feel like writing in this but I just wanted to say WELCOME HOME SIMONE I REALLY REALLY MISSED YOU BUT I'M SURE YOU HAD A GREAT TIME! and call me if you get a chance but if not I understand you are really busy unpacking and such. ~Cheech~

      Ok so that is just what I am listening to. But wow it has been a long time since I have updated this. So on the fourth, Kait came over and we just hung out and then Scott came over to my mom's house and met up with my mom, Theresa, Ann and Etta. Kait, Scott and I went down to Lyon's Park and met up with Andrew. We went to Kait's old house for a party for a bit and then went back to the park and claimed our spot to watch the fireworks. Amber and Iris and some others came and sat with us. We watched the fireworks and then everyone went back to my mom's house. We took the top off of Scott's Jeep. Amber, Iris and Andrew had to go home early so the rest of us went cruising. Kait and I stayed at my mom's house. On Monday, I just hung out around the house and then spent the night at Amber and Iris' house. On Tuesday, I came down the hill early and spent time with my mom and her friends. Tuesday night, Amber, Iris, Alex, Ches, Andrew, Scott and I went and saw Spider Man 2. On Wednesday, a bunch of us went to Water World. It was kinda fun but I didn't really know a lotta the people that went. I was supposed to go bowling with Kait, Scott, Sam, Ian and Austin that night but Austin backed out so I just went back to my house and watched Practical Magic with my mom. On Thursday, Kait, my mom and I painted the office at her house. Thursday night, I went to Timmy's softball game with my mom, Etta and Meghan. I met this guy Sean and we spent the rest of the night together. We went to Woody's for dinner and then back to his uncle's house to go hot tubbing, play darts and pool. Friday, Kait came over and we just hung out all day. Last night, Kait and I met up at Mills with all the guys for this festival. It was really boring so everyone came over here. I ended up having Kait, Amber, Linds, Cheryl, Kayley, Blakelee, Austin, Scott, Travis, Britton, Evan, Ian, Jason, Ryan, David, Drew, and I dunno maybe other people too. Sammy and I got into a huge fight last night and I dunno if that is gonna be fixed any time soon. Amber spent the night last night and now we are just hanging out. I think Amber, Iris, Lindsey, Chelsea, Kait and I are gonna go and see Sleepover tonight so I will just write more later.  ~*Cheech*~

      Ok so these past few days have been pretty uneventful. On Friday, I picked up Kait and we just went to my dad's and laid out and tanned next to the pool for most of the day. She had to be home to go to dinner with her family so I just stayed home and watched a movie. I made a bookmark from the stamps my grandma gave me! It is freakin awesome! I was really bored last night so that really entertained me. I cleaned my room and raided my closet last night, too and it finally is starting to look like my room again. Amazingly, I got rid of a ton of clothes. I woke up early today so I could lay out and get some good color. I actually got quite a bit of sun and I am really happy about that. I swam a little but the pool was kind of cold. My dad smoked ribs for dinner so I stayed home for dinner. At like 8:30, Sam called me and invited me and Kait to a party at Sky's house. We decided to go and Ian drove us up there. It was ok. The people there were Ian, Sammy, Kait, me, Matt, Tyler, Sky, Jordan, Scott, Tim, Cheryl, Kayley, Amanda, Brent, Blakelee, Amber, Cody, Devin and Lauren Davison. The guys just played pool and smoked and drank the whole time. We kinda walked around and just screwed around. It was fun tho. Kait had curfew so I had to come home early too. I was really excited because Amber called me last night! I miss those guys sooo much! They are coming home tonight sometime so it will be really great to see them sometime tomorrow....Independence Day is my favorite holiday ever so I am really looking forward to it! This year might be kinda lame tho because fireworks are illegal in Golden so we can't have a show of our own. We might go to Wyoming and buy some on our way to Iowa but we will see I guess. I am excited to watch all of the shows throughout Denver tho. I really dunno what I am gonna do yet..I just know that Kait and I are hanging out and some guys might come over too. I might have a small party at my mom's house but I dunno yet. Ok so there isn't really anything else to write so I will just write more later. ~*Booger*~

      Yea so that is the song I am listening to right now. These last few days have been really interesting. On Tuesday, my mom and Sammy and I went to the Rockies game. We actually didn't get rained out...it poured before the game but then stopped when the game started. So it was just really cold.It was a lotta fun tho. I got a new hat! It's really really cute and pink! After the game I went to Lindsey's and watched Road Trip with her cuz she has never seen it and that was the last time I would get to hang with her for a week. On Wednesday, Kait came over and we just kinda hung out and then we went to dinner at the mall with Austin and Scott. We went and saw the Notebook after that. It was a really really good movie. I highly recommend it. Kait and I cried and then Scott made fun of us. I saw Brooke Sauer and Steph Liddick at the mall and movie and Brooke has her license and was driving! It was sooo cool to see her doing that. We all went to Lindsey's so I could pick up Nemo (her fish) because I am watching him while she is gone. We went out for milkshakes to Sonic and then took Linds home and came back here and watched EuroTrip. Kait spent the night. Today, I washed my car with my mom and then went out to dinner with her, Theresa and her mom. It was a lotta fun. Simone left today for Texas and Linds left for Michigan. Simone wont be back for 2 weeks and Linds will be back on Wednesday. Amber and Iris are comin back on Saturday! I am soo excited for the 4th this year! I am hangin with Kait and maybe Amber and Iris. It's a tradition for me and Kait to hang on the 4th so I am really glad we get to do that. I really can't think of anything else to write. O well I will just add more later. ~*Chels*~

       LOL ok so whew gotta write some shit down before I esplode.  Yes, that's right. I wrote esplode and meant it! So anyways, I can't really remember too much of what has been goin on so Ima try my hardest to update this. Ok so on Friday, June 30th, I went to the Blue Collar Comedy Tour with my dad. We sat in the fourth row and got all of their autographs. It was freaking awesome! Ok so on Saturday, I hung out with Lindsey and Chelsea. I'm pretty sure we just sat at Denver West for a long time. Sunday, I went and saw Larry the Cable Guy with my dad. Later that night, I met up with Amber, Iris and Lindsey and spent the night at Amber's house. I came home the next day and went fridge shopping with my dad. We finally bought one and then went to lunch. I went shopping with Amber and Iris at Victoria's Secret and Abercrombie & Fitch. Monday night, Iris, Danielle and I went to dinner with my mom at the California Pizza Kitchen and then rented movies and watched em at my house. We watched the Texas Chainsaw Massacre and EuroTrip. The ladies spent the night and Iris and I played at the school the next day. We met up with Amber and went out for ice cream and then to the river for a bit. We decided to go to Iris' barn so we did and I went horseback riding for my first time ever! It was soo much fun. That night, we hung out with a bunch of people at D West for awhile and then went and saw Napolean Dynamite. I swear we laughed through like the whole thing. Once again, the ladies spent the night and had to leave early the next day. I went to the Rockies game with my mom and Etta that night. It was ok except for the fact they suck and it's impossible to win a game. On Thursday, I hung out with Cisco and Christian for just a bit. It really wasn't that much fun so I just came home. I found out on Friday that I didn't get a parking pass this year. Very, very depressing. I hung out with Linds and Chels that night and we did all sorts of fun things. We hung at D West for awhile with Brandi and then we went to a party with Lauren A, Lisa G, Matt B and Ben H. It was kinda creepy so me, Linds, Chels, Matt and Ben just went to Lindsey's and watched FearDotCom. Weird freakin movie. I still don't get it. It actually kinda sucks cuz I think I kinda have a slight crush on Ben now. But it's just a little one I swear. Today, I went horseback riding with Linds and Chels all day at Bear Creek Lake Park. They came over for dinner and then we were tryin to find somethin to do. We ended up at the mall for awhile and then went up to Andrew's. We hung out at Brooke's for a bit with some of the fellas, but it was nothing very exciting. But anyways there are tons of things to write down....mainly about some boys, but I will just write more tomorrow cuz I am tired and Brenden wants to talk. So laters! ~*Cheech*~
