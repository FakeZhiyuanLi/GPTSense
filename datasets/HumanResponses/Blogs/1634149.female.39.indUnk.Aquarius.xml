      Well, I guess in the beginning, one should really do a bit of an introduction. I'm not going to go on and on with a large, long-winded thing. I'm just going to state my intent.   Next June 18-19 is my old hometown Relay for Life. For the second year, I am the Co-Captain of a family team (and a few very important friends) which goes by the name Keith's Brain Trust. Our Honorary Captain is my husband Keith. We formed the team in his honor after his battle with a brain tumor, which took place in 2001. A few of us participated in the 2002 Relay as members of one of the already formed teams just to see what it was like. We really had fun and decided that we could do this on our own with our own team, and would have a heck of a lot of fun doing it, so we gave it a shot in 2003.  Since we did have a great time, we are going for it again in 2004. We exhausted our garage sale resources during the 2003 contribution-seeking period. As a result of that, I decided I'd better come up with some other idea for seeking funds this year and THIS IS IT!  Welcome to my 500-Mile Run to No Where! I may not be going anywhere, but I'm working on seeking a cure for Cancer in my travels, and I'm using my feet and hopefully your donations to get me there.   This is the site that I told you about in the donation-seeking letter. This is where I told you that I would keep you updated on how I was doing on my goal. I hope that along the way, you will leave me some words of wisdom, maybe just a hello or a "keep on going!" (by clicking on the word comment at the end of the things I write and filling in the blanks). I'll be thrilled to see that you've been here for a visit and to check up on me.    Anything  to keep me moving!  I'm also in hot pursuit of a corporate sponsor that would be interested in doing some sort of matching funding or giving a cool discount to people who sponsor me on my Run to Nowhere. If you know of anyone that might be interested, send them my way! Let them know about me.   If you haven't sent me back the donation letter, don't delay. Every letter that comes back to me, helps get me back on that treadmill every morning (or pounding the pavement on a good day).   I already had my first person jump on the donations bandwagon - one of my Diva buddies said she would sponsor me the very first day I mentioned it! Thanks, Kath!  Today was the starting day of statistics...  So here are today's stats on the road to Nowhere...  I ran 3.16 miles. Only 496.84 miles to go!  Hope you visit often, and speak much! Encourage freely!    Hmm. Okay, it's a little more long-winded than I thought it would be.

      This morning I ran with Danny Ocean and Rusty Ryan. I've really got to get some new movies in my collection. I mean,  urlLink  Ocean's Eleven   is a great movie, and it will keep me running (especially after that gorgeous Andy Garcia... I loves me some Andy Garcia!) for a couple of days. But I could use some new flicks to keep me going and distracted.   Zen Master Warrior tells me to run unaccompanied and to just FEEL the perfection of the run. I love you honey, but I would fall flat on my butt after the first quarter mile if I just ran and had to actually pay attention to what the run  felt  like. Seriously. Zen Master Keri I'm not.   I think I'm going to ask for some Mr. Movies gift cards from my folks for Christmas and my birthday  (hint hint mom!)  so I have plenty of backup movies for this running thing.   Here's how I did on Ray's run...  Today's miles: 3.18 miles Total so far: 24.86 miles Still needed to goal: 475.14 miles  Thank you dedicated cheerleaders! You guys are the bestest! (((((hugging)))))  (Hutch? Are you here?)    Tomorrow's run is dedicated to Trudi's friend, Stacey R. Keep on kicking that breast tumour, baby-cakes! You know you can!

      I put in four miles today. Finished watching The Two Towers. Alas. How many weeks do I have to wait for Return of the King to hit the theaters? This one was for KathyK and her papa. Hugs to you both. May he continue to do well with his current chemo treatment! And Kathy? Keep up the good work yourself, hunny-bunny! ESC!   Glad to hear the letters are hitting your boxes. Been getting some good responses from people... (500 miles? Are you  NUTS? ).   I may even have to post a photo of my sweaty and nasty self running some of those miles on the site someday. I actually got the idea from one of my neighbors. You know. To show me on that treadmill and oh how lucky it is that none of you have to actually witness the horror in person because by the time I've done 500 miles in my family room, it will need to be fumigated!   Okay, so here are the stats:  Today's miles: 4.02 Total so far: 21.68 Still needed to goal: 478.32  Tomorrow I'm running for family friend Ray, who just had bypass surgery! Notice, I'm not having any trouble finding people to dedicate my miles to so far, but if any one of my three readers has someone special in their life that they want me to run for, it really helps get my butt on the treadmill to have someone special that I'm doing it for, so drop me a comment please!   And your cheerleading really helps, too! (Shameless begging begins anew!)

       The first official piece of paper came in the mail today promising donations for my run! (Yes mom and dad - you were first!) Things are really starting to roll now. I'll have to get the number-cruncher working on those spreadsheets this weekend so I can just plug numbers in as the pledges come in. It's so exciting! Thank you backers! This is in addition to word via e-mail and forum chats. What great friends and family!  Today's run was for Kat. It was lonely and small, but it was hard-fought. I had the didn't-get-my-own-Cities-Sampler blues.   Today's miles: 2 Total so far: 17.66 Still needed to goal: 482.34  Tomorrow I run for Kathy's dad. She is one of my Diva sistahs and her dad is battling inoperable lung cancer in both lungs. He has been taking experimental chemo, however, and they've just had word that the cancer is stable after 30 days on the treatment with no new activity. That's really great news!  I'm dedicating my miles tomorrow to him, and to KathyK because she's had a really rough year. Love ya sweetie!

       Today's run is dedicated to a stranger named Dave, who is celebrating being cancer free. I learned about him at  urlLink d's  place.  I'll be back to report the miles later.   I'm on my way, Aragorn!    Update:  Today's miles: 3.09 Total miles so far: 15.66 Still needed to goal: 484.34  That was for you, Dave. And I'm still Snoopy dancing for you, too. Because I am truly excited that you are clean of cancer cells. What is better than that? Congratulations! Huge cyber hugs!  And tomorrow? Well, I've promised tomorrow's miles to Kat. They're all yours baby. I'm gonna do them when I come back from running all over tarnation looking for my Cities Sampler. Because I was unsuccessful in my attempts to win one on the radio. And I have my priorities. Music first. Then running.  And for those of you waiting to hear about the Beckster's biopsy results? You're going to have to hang in there like the rest of us and wait a little longer because things were effed up at the lab and the poor dear has to go back in next week and have things re-done. Now tell me things aren't a little screwed up in the medical world. She's been waiting a week for those results and now she has to wait again. Love you guys. Hugs. Hope you get better and faster treatment this time around.

      Today I ran with Shadowfax... We ran side by side our long legs quivering with speed and endurance as we raced up hills and over the mountains and through the forests on our way to Rohan.   (all right all of you who know me, stop laughing at that long legs thing...)   True, I  felt  more like Tree Beard and his creaky movements as he carried Merry and Pippin through Fangorn Forest, especially during the first mile, but I kept on and eventually I felt like I was running with Shadowfax, really I did!  Today's miles: 3.25 Total so far: 12.57 Still needed to goal: 487.43  The letters should be trickling out to people finally. I'm loving my cheering squad! Thanks gang!

      Okay Trudles... No wimps allowed.   I got home from helping the Warrior husband move to his new weekly lodgings around 10 pm and I was bushed. Okay, so yesterday I took a day of rest. My second day on the 500 run to nowhere and I rested. I needed it to prepare for all those days ahead!  Today, I got up at 6 to get my daughter off to school, prepared to stay up for the day so I could get some miles racked and determined to set the pace. This is November of NaNoWriMo and the start of the 500-Miles! There is much to accomplish!  Today's miles: 6.16  Total miles run so far: 9.32 Still needed to goal: 490.68  Now I'm going to go hobble off to my laptop and try to get some mega-words typed in on that story I'm working on. And then perhaps I'll be able to stand up long enough for a good hot shower. I sure hope we get some sunshine today. I know a few of my friends out there love these gray and rainy days that we've been getting but I seriously could NOT wake up yesterday. These Pacific Northwest kind of days just drag me into the doldrums (no offense).   Thanks for the cheers, friends! Hugs to you!

       Had this whole entry done once already but it was as dry as toast and I had to throw it away. I'm afraid that's just how it's going to be today, though... dry as toast. It's just one of those days. Where everything that rolls off your fingers is blah. And there's nothing you can do about it.  Glad deer hunting season is nearly over. The cannons were going off last night before I ran to town for the little parade we had to light up the town for Christmas. It seriously sounded like they were in our back yard. Close. They were on the corner of the lot line. I took the dog out to his dog run hoping he would start barking and piss off the hunters enough to make them leave, but he was just so afraid of them he ran in the garage and cowered by the back door until I let him back inside and I sat in his dog run whistling as loudly as I could instead, like I had a dog I was whistling for. It didn't help. They just sat down there shooting off their cannons. I finally yelled, "Sure feels great feeling like I'm living in a damn warzone!" But they couldn't hear me over the sound of their cannons. So I went back inside.  Well, I'd better go help Keli clean her rooms since she was so helpful to me last night. She got a wild hair and decided to clean the wood floors in various rooms. Really clean - not just dust. She did some other impressive stuff too. So I said I'd help her this morning. And things didn't get any less dry around here. Sorry about that. Hopefully I'll get a little damper tomorrow. May you all have a cheery day...  Here's the stats for Uncle K's run...  Today's miles: 3.12 Total so far: 45.49 Still to go for goal: 454.51  Tomorrow I'm running for my hubby Keith because of his tube ride on Monday. Give him an extra thought tomorrow or an extra prayer tomorrow night, please. This is his annual checkup to make sure his tumor site is behaving itself and that there isn't any sign of regrowth.   We are lucky enough to have a great team that we meet with who give us the results right away. Some people aren't so lucky and don't get their results for days after their MRI, so I'll already have the news by the time I come back later on Monday, but I'll also be helping him get moved in to his new week-day apartment that day. At any rate, by the time I post my Monday workout (if I can fit one in with all of that going on) I'll be able to let you know that we got the all clear. (power of positive thinking)

       I was going to just pretend yesterday didn't happen. Thought maybe since the cheerleaders were kind of non-existent for a couple days, nobody would notice if I skipped a day. And then Trudi happened. :) I'm not complaining. I love Trudi. I'm glad she posted on my post about the 26th wondering where my run for Thanksgiving was? She's keeping me honest.   So here's the thing. I slept in every day this week. Every blinking day! I couldn't drag my sorry butt out of bed! I've got a really cozy bed. It isn't comfortable. The mattress, which we spent a helluva lot of money on, SUCKS ROCKS. (don't ask me what that means, or where I picked up such a stupid phrase, but it does... the mattress sucks rocks). But climbing out from between those sheets and covers?  Hard to do.  And not even because Keith is home to snuggle with all week. Nope. He is up and out of bed by 6:30 because the dog doesn't let him sleep in. It's just me. In the big cozy bed. All alone. So comfortable. Well, by the time I did get up, there was food to be cooked to take with us to the folks' house and showers to be taken and there just wasn't time to run before going.   And by the time we got back, I could barely move for the food I'd eaten. But it was a good day. Much fun and laughter. So no. I didn't run. But I ran today!! (after sleeping in again...)   I ran with  urlLink Anthony Hopkins  in  urlLink  Titus  . It was a good run. A slow and steady run.   And now I have a whole mess of cleaning to do. We're having dear old friends over tomorrow. And their new addition to the family... Riley.   Here's the stats for my run of the day...  Today's miles: 3.52 Total so far: 42.37 Still needed to goal: 457.63  Tomorrow I will run for my Uncle K, who battled prostate cancer and beat it. Love you uncle! And that was after battling many heart problems (open heart surgery, heart attacks, etc.).

       Alrighty then. After getting dressed and heading downstairs and getting sidetracked by Keli who needed a ride to The Boy's house because she had a party to attend with him tonight, I finally got started around 5 on Barb's miles. I finished watching Untamed Heart and started on Titus, but only rolled through the intro and opening credits before I'd had it for the evening and decided I'd better get the oven heated and the pizza out of the fridge...   Tonight's dinner in order to hold back the mess and the cooking for tomorrow: Papa Murphy's Gourmet Vegetarian Pizza (hold the onions). Delish!  Received a couple more pledges in today's mail. It really makes going to the mailbox exciting! Had a letter in the box from a former co-worker, which was much fun - hello! I'll write you soon, thanks for the updated e-mail and the pledge! People are so generous and wonderful...  And another very surprising and overwhelming pledge arrived today as well... all I can say is wow and bless you and thank you.   My updated stats...  Today's miles: 3.11  Total so far: 38.85 Still needed to goal: 461.15  Tomorrow's run is dedicated to KathyK's mom, who battled breast cancer and is a 10-year survivor! KathyK, your family has been through the ringer with this stuff, eh darling? I'll have had your whole family after tomorrow! Do I need to start on your hubby's side after this? I haven't heard you mention his family battling the old Cancer beast, but I'm sure with as prevalent as the bugger is, it is highly possible. Thanks for your visit yesterday. Hugs to you and yours. I hope your dad continues to fight hard with his chemo.   Happy Thanksgiving to everyone in case I don't get out here tomorrow to post! We're heading to the folks' house for a family dinner... Enjoy the time with your loved ones...     thanks to all of you for your support.  Keri

       I can tell on this day before Thanksgiving that as the holidays approach, they are going to be some tough days for getting on that treadmill. I mean, here it is the day  before  Thanksgiving and it is 4 pm and I'm struggling to get on the monster.   Also, the holidays are going to mean that my cheerleaders are busy with their own lives and not hanging out on their computers just waiting for me to need their assistance... So here I go. Just letting you know that it's a tough day. But I'm going. Right now. And I sure am glad I've got Barb to run for. This one's for you, Barb... I'll be back.

       Spent quality family time last night with the Warrior (who cooked his fabulous cheese tortellini dinner) and Keli (who wanted to watch a movie, so I rewound Grosse Pointe Blank and we watched all of that together).   So today's movie on the run was  urlLink  Untamed Heart   with  urlLink Christian Slater  (yes, another one) and  urlLink Marisa Tomei . This is one Keli picked out as it has two of her favorite people (the aforementioned) in it also. So far, so good with that whole 80's romantic thing going for it. And another perk is that it is set in the Twin Cities area, looks to be right around the U of M campus, so that's fun.  I'm getting some e-mails and phone calls with questions regarding the fund-raising letter I sent, so I will try and clarify a couple of things here, too. I tried to make the letter crystal clear, but that's difficult sometimes - trying to make it short enough to get people to read it and yet clear enough to avoid questions.    You needn't send any money at this time (and I'd kind of prefer you didn't because of the delay before the relay, but I'll take it if you really prefer it that way).     If you are sending money now, you can send a check made out to the American Cancer Society. Do you mind if I hold that check until next spring when we start depositing for the relay?     All I am hoping for at this point, is the tear off of the letter returned pledging whatever (for example, a penny a mile would be a $5 total donation when/if I make the 500 mile goal... a nickle a mile would be a $25 donation on June 1 or when/if I make the 500 mile goal, etc.)      If you are reading this site and did not get a letter and would  like  to because this sounds like a great idea, please send me a comment to that effect and we'll e-mail each other and connect somehow. I  love  you!  Any other questions? I'd be happy to answer them for you. Let me know. I hate being confusing.  Here are the stats for Dawn's run...   Today's miles: 3.50 Total so far: 35.74 Still needed to goal: 464.26  Tomorrow's run is dedicated to my friend Barb. She battled the breast cancer bugger several years ago when I worked with her in downtown St. Paul. She beat the beast and took on a new lease on life asking herself what she was missing from life that she really wanted to have there. The answer was horses and she brought that old love and joy back into her life. We should all learn from her example. Hugs to you, Barb! I hope you are well. It has been too long, old friend. We must get together again - all four of us.   The pledges are starting to roll in! Thank you so much!!

       Finally I can update! Blogger was down for a while this afternoon and I was going  crazy  because I hate when I want to get something done and can't. Can we say i m p a t i e n t? Um yeah. That's me. Just a little bit. Ask the Warrior. He says when you look in the dictionary for the definition of impatient you'll find a picture of me. He's probably right. I don't know. I haven't looked it up lately.  So today was the day Becky had to go into the hospital and have her tumour aspirated again (yes, I really did say again because the first time they didn't get any tumour cells... doesn't that suck?). She won't get the results until Friday, so send a little bit of lovin' and healthy vibes into the universe for the Beckster and for her mommy because they could use your good thoughts, okay?  And so today (this evening, in fact because I really had a rough time climbing on that treadmill today) I climbed on the treadmill (taking your submissions for names for the damn thing because I'm sick of calling it "the treadmill" - please send your ideas to my comment section... another shameless plea to see how many of you are reading, aren't I tricky?) in Becky's honor because she is a good daughter to my best writing buddy and traveling partner Marge, whom I lurrrrrv.(Hi Marge!)  Thanks to  urlLink Billy's  terrific movie idea, I stopped at Mr. Movies this afternoon while I was out running errands and picking my daughter up from school, and I picked up  urlLink  Grosse Pointe Blank   (starring that handsome hunk,  urlLink John Cusack  - yum!). I began watching it on tonight's run. I've seen it before, of course, but I'd forgotten how much fun it was. I'm loving the 80's music and I really like  urlLink Minnie Driver , so that's a plus, too. And  urlLink Alan Arkin  as the therapist is a hoot and I'd forgotten all about him. So I'm enjoying that thoroughly and it will make climbing on "the thing" tomorrow so much easier. I think that was part of the problem earlier today. I didn't have a great movie to pop in, you know?   But, I did it. Even after a really slow start to the day and not wanting to do it, I finally climbed aboard "It" and did it. I'm not patting myself on the back here. I'm just damn glad it's over to be honest. Because tomorrow I have to do it all over again. But at least I'll have John to look at! Thanks, Bill! That was a great idea.   And now Trudi has given me more great ideas.  urlLink  BJD  , of course is in my stack of watchables and girl, she is committed to memory... Honey? You should see Keli  do  Bridget. You know the scene at the end where Mark reads the diary and goes storming out of her apartment and B hears the door close and comes out of her bedroom wondering what is going on in just her knickers and t-shirt?  "Mark?     Mark?" Peeking around corners and tip-toeing around... Keli knocks me over with her impression. I'm nearly wetting myself when she does it. Sounds like her, facial expressions, movements... only thing missing are the thighs and such. My dear daughter...  Loved  urlLink  Bend it Like Beckham  . Going to own that one soon. Haven't seen   urlLink Men With Brooms  , so I'll definitely check that one out on the next rental run! Thanks for the suggestions! Keep 'em coming!!!  On with the stats...  Today's miles: 3.33 Total so far: 32.24 Still needed to goal: 467.76  I'm dedicating tomorrow's run to Dawn D. She is currently going through treatment for breast cancer here in my home town. She is the mom of one of my daughter's very dear friends and every one of Dawn's sisters have also gone through treatment for breast cancer; one of them has been through it twice!   Won't it be fantastic when they finally stamp out this nasty beast? Because they will you know. They  will  find a cure. I am positive of that fact.

       Well, aside from knowing that the battle against cancer is a beotch of a battle, I haven't had to fight it personally. Yes, I watched my husband fight it and in a way, had to fight part of it myself, but physically, I didn't go through it. I've never felt the effects of chemo or radiation, or had the surgeons knife remove any foreign tumour from me. Millions of others have.   I'm not sure how much of that battle Stacey has had to go through. I just know that my friend Trudi has asked me to dedicate a portion of my 500 miles to her dear friend Stacey, battling breast cancer, so today, I did just that.   I've never used the programs on my treadmill before. I've just hopped on and run the flat road and done a bit of time and miles as I've watched a movie. Today I thought I'd hit one of the programs while I finished watching   urlLink Oceans Eleven   ( urlLink George Clooney ,  urlLink Andy Garcia ,  urlLink Brad Pitt ... Oh MY!)...  I'm not a fan of hills. I hate them. They make the lungs and the legs  hurt , dammit.   But the way I looked at the pain today was, Stacey's been through a LOT more pain than what that little treadmill could dish out. So when the hill got steep? I kept going. For her sake. When my legs started to burn? I kept going. Because she does. Every day. So Stacey? This one was for you. Thanks for helping me get on that treadmill today and put in the miles.   Huge hugs to you in your battle. I wish you the very best. You've got a really great friend in the Trudles. I lurrrrrrrrvs her a lot. I hope someday to meet her in 3D so I can give her a really big hug, too.  Here's the stats for your run...  Today's miles: 4.05 Total so far: 28.91 Still needed to goal: 471.09  Tomorrow's run is dedicated to Becky. She has to go to the hospital and have her tumor aspirated (sp?) tomorrow so it can be tested for cancer. I don't know if this is the right way to put it or not, but that's the basics. A retest because the first one didn't work. Prayin' for you Beckster.

       Well the bed wasn't spinning when I opened my eyes this morning and the world didn't twirl when I stood up, so I decided I could go for my run. Lurch was amenable and I popped What Lies Beneath into the VCR and put the headphones on so I could get the full effect of the whispers and screams and all that. Actually, I have to turn the TV sound up pretty loud to hear it over the pounding of my feet on the "pavement" and don't want to bug the whole family (Keli was still sleeping just down the hall).  There are some great creepy scenes in that movie and plot twists and turns. Not a bad flick. I go for a scary movie now and then. Not necessarily while running, but I'd already watched it snuggled in bed earlier in the week and this watch was to catch all the ghosties that I missed the first time around and to keep my mind off my aches and pains and shortness of breath.   While I ran the scent of cinnamon and sugar kept wafting down the steps and into my nose and it was like a cartoon smoke arm and hand grabbing me and pulling me away and up into the kitchen... When I finished running and headed that direction, I found a cinnamon crumb cake cooling on the counter that Keith had made. What a darling hubby, eh? No wonder I bring him home on the weekends. Have I mentioned that Betty Crocker I am  not ?  Tonight we are off to see the play  The Best Christmas Pageant Ever . My niece, Erin has a small part in it, so we get to see her on stage this year. We missed it last year when she also took part. Think we'll go get some dinner in town, too.   Hmm, crumb cake, dinner out. Think I should have done an extra mile or two for David today! Here's the numbers...  Today's miles: 3.5 Total so far: 64.25 Still to go for goal: 435.75  Tomorrow I will run for my Aunt E. who kept things so quiet that only a couple of people even knew she had battled cancer until we saw her at the Relay last year in the survivors' tent celebrating with the rest of the survivors.

       David Bailey is getting a rain check on his run. Not because today was a total wash, but because it was enough of one that I want to give him a better day.  I had a big mix up this week with my prescriptions. When I thought I was taking my blood pressure meds, I was actually taking an old prescription of Claritin-D. Not mine. Keith's. Pay attention and read labels folks. So I was not only not taking my BP meds this week, but I was doubling up on claritin 24 hour  and  taking the decongestent part, which I'm not supposed to have for reasons which I can't even remember any more. I made the discovery on Tuesday night when I went to fill up my pill container and thought my BP pills looked "off". Then I realized I'd been taking from the wrong bottle for about a week. Ack. I'd been feeling a little off for a few days, too. Especially when we were moving Keith and after the appointment for the MRI. I chalked it up to all of the stress. Guess it might have been the drugs.   So I got back on the full dosage of the meds Thursday morning. And when I climbed out of bed this morning, I nearly fell over. The room was spinning. BP meds? BP falling to it's lower range? Migraine? Don't know. All I know is I had bed spins when I went back to bed and the world was really flying. So when I finally did get up because the world slowed down enough, I didn't do a full workout. I did a slow and easy walk on Lurch.  I also put up the Christmas tree and cleaned the ceiling fans and putzed around the house, turning a fingernail black and blue in the process.   So Mr. Bailey? I hope you'll accept this rain check for tomorrow. Or another day if need be. We'll see how the bod is feeling when I climb out of bed in the morning.  Keep those pledges coming! Wait a minute Mr. Postman...   Here's the numbers...  Today's miles: 2 Total so far: 60.75 Still to go for goal:439.25  Tomorrow is the follow up for  urlLink david m. bailey !

       Today with curly-haired Kimberly on my mind, and crazy Ferris on my screen shakin' up the Windy City (is there anything better than that scene of him on the float in the middle of the parade lip-syncin'  Twist and Shout  with The Beatles and dancin' his cute little free-wheelin' heart out? Ah, the simple life of an 80's teenager, skipping school and having fun. Those were the days... But I never skipped school... much... Pooh's not around here to verify that... are you Pooh? And I don't think Hutch ever cut with us so she can't squeal. I mean, she never cut  either ... We were all good kids. Not a class cutter in the bunch. Huh uh. Not us.  Wow, did I digress... As I was saying, with curly-haired Kimberly on my mind, I climbed aboard Lurch (that doesn't sound right, does it???) and ran 3.25 miles today.   I was reminded by my Naturopath to take my vitamins and minerals when she pointed out that I'm lacking in some basic mineral the other day (which one escapes me, of course) and she asked me if I was still taking them. I told her I had been a bit lax. So, she cracked the whip and told me to get back on them and I'd be feeling fit as a fiddle again. It would probably explain the sore knees and legs and such (has nothing to do with the running, believe you me). Today it was back to the good stuff and in no time I'll be whipping down those streets to nowhere again, probably putting in 20 miles a day! (hahaha - glad to know I can still laugh at myself).   Here are today's numbers before I'm off to do the many things yet to be accomplished, the least of which is to run to the mailbox for more joy!...  Today's miles: 3.25 Total so far: 58.75 Still to go for goal: 441.25  Tomorrow I run for a man who's brain tumor journey has inspired my Keith ever since we learned of him. His name is  urlLink david m. bailey . I hope that you will visit his website and read about his own journey through the nightmare that is cancer of the brain. He was given less than a year to live when his baseball size tumor was found and now over six (if I remember correctly) years later, he is still going strong. He quit the corporate world and went back to his first love of music. He's a singer/songwriter with a really powerful message of hope and love and strength and I could go on and on. His music and message have meant a lot to us and a lot of other people that we know. That is why I'll run for him.   We've had the opportunity to meet him a couple of times after some concerts and he is as genuine a person as you would ever hope to come across. Check out his schedule and if he is in your area, please go hear him. Pick up a cd and have a listen. Click on his links online and have a listen that way. You might surprise yourself and like what you hear. Okay. Enough promotion. No, I'm not getting anything from it. Just the satisfaction of knowing that I'm exposing a few more people to something really great.

       Today I ran with Ferris Bueller. Bueller? Bueller? Anyone? Anyone? And Matthew Broderick only gets better looking with age.   And do you see the rubber duck at the top of the page? That rubber duck is a 10 percent indicator... Everytime I hit a 50-mile marker, I get a rubber duck... well I hit one yesterday so I'm 10% of the way there. This was devised by the originator of the 500-mile club,  urlLink Marn .   It was a busy day! I had to get up and get going with that run because then it was off to the folks' house for an extended family meeting about Christmas Eve. Our family CE is getting smaller. Looks like it will only be 40 this year, but we'll still need to rent the local shooting range to hold it in, and Santa will still pay us a visit. The meeting ran three hours long and then I stayed to copy my notes for Mom and give a hand with some lights outside and chat with the folks a few minutes before heading back to the high school to pick up Kel. We came straight home to work on some of the Christmas decorating and a couple of other projects I have in the fire.   I've gotta say my favorite task of the day right now is picking up the mail. There is nothing like opening that box and finding another of the self-addressed stamped envelopes I sent out returning like a homing pigeon with a pledge or donation from one of my lovely friends or family members. I don't know how I will ever thank you. I guess by jumping on Lurch every day that I can and continuing this journey of 500 miles!   Yes, I did name the damn treadmill. Without any help from any of you. Perhaps you missed the request (See  For Becky  11/24) - I'll give you the benefit of the doubt. Anyway, the treadmill is hereby dubbed Lurch, for a couple of reasons... One of the reasons is because some days, that's what I tend to do when I climb aboard - I lurch along. It's all I can do, but I just gotta do what I can. Another is that you may remember Lurch from the original Addams Family TV series? Remember that sound he made in his throat when he was somewhat disgusted with Gomez or some other family member? That's how I sound when I'm about to climb aboard. When I jump back off nearly an hour later, I've got a spring in my step and a cheerful trill in my voice (yeah, right) and sound nothing like Lurch, but before...  So I just thought Lurch was fitting.  Speaking of Becky, you may have caught Marge's meaning in her comments to me yesterday. They are still waiting on Beck's biopsy results. Poor girl found out Monday that the second set were "too close" to call and had been sent on to a second lab for their opinion and she now has to wait for another week or two. Keep those fingers and toes crossed please.  So today for my darlin' Southern Belle Judikins...  Today's miles: 3.5 Total so far: 55.5 Still to go for goal: 444.5  Tomorrow I run for Kimberly. She's another of Keli's friend's moms. It is so hard to see these young teen girls with moms going through hard-core breast cancer treatment and fighting for their lives. Kimberly fought hard during the summer of 2002 and has been cancer free for a year now. And WOW did she get a curly head of hair after that chemo! Her husband joked with me that it was an expensive way to get a perm!

       For those of you who read what's written elsewhere, you already know that the MRI results came back with good news. The doc says there is no sign of growth (is that how he put it?) at the site and that things are stable. PHEW!   Thank you for your good thoughts, prayers and well-wishes. We all appreciate your love and support. Yesterday we had that early set of appointments, then we headed back home to get our loaded car and met up with the folks and their loaded car and headed for Keith's new apartment. He'll stay there during the week while he's working and I'll head over and  bring him for the weekends back here to our home in the woods of Wisconsin. It's a nice new apartment complex overlooking a lake with a really nice walking/bike path around it. As we got him settled in, we watched the sun go down over the lake. It was beautiful. I bet I put a lot of distance on my running shoes yesterday just running around with all of that! But I was far too tired when I got back home to get on the treadmill. And still too busy!  When I got home, I called Keli to see if she was ready for me to pick her up from her friend's house. They were just starting dinner, though. Then as I hung up the phone, I saw the note hanging on the refrigerator that I had a meeting to go to at the high school regarding registration for next year starting an hour later. After that, she and I headed to Target for a shopping excursion because three of her friends had birthdays to celebrate and we needed to shop for them (after all, it was  The Boy's  birthday today! And that was critical!). I was really beat by the time I got home and finally could really go to bed. I think she was up wrapping and writing cards until nearly 1. I couldn't keep track. Besides, she has teenage youthful vigor going for her!  So today's results, run in recovery mode...  Today's miles: 2.49 Total so far: 52 Still to go for goal: 448  Tomorrow I will run for Southern Belle Judy M. who battled breast cancer and won. I love her southern accent. I love to hear her say "Bless your heart." I miss her because she's a friend who is missing in action these days, but I think about her a lot, so this one is for her. I love you, Judy!

       Today I ran for my hubby. Tomorrow is his tube ride for the year. And we'll get good results. We're lucky because we'll actually  get  results.  Tomorrow . Within an hour or so of the MRI. A lot of people aren't so lucky. They go for their checkups and have to wait for days for their neurologists to get back to them with results. And those results often come in the form of a phone call from the nurse. We'll get to meet with the doc himself. And since he's a professor at a University and loves to teach, any questions we have will be greeted with "I'm glad you asked." He'll sit back in his chair and answer to his heart's content. Did I say he loves to teach? Have I mentioned how Keith loves the University setting? I think we'll end up back at some little College some day with Keith in the roll of Professor if we can swing it. One dream. Anyway, we have an excellent team of physicians now handling Keith's case.   I ran for the final day with  urlLink Anthony Hopkins . That is one wicked movie. And you thought he was a bad dude in  urlLink Silence of the Lambs ? There is some nasty stuff happening in  urlLink Titus . N.A.S.T.Y. Shakespeare had some twisted ideas. Or the Romans had the twisted ideas I suppose and Shakespeare was just writing them? Whatever. It was violent and nasty.  Our friends P&C came to see us yesterday. We had lots of laughs, lots of food and enjoyed their baby Riley immensely. Hope to see them again soon, maybe even before Christmas.  This  year. One can hope.   I've done some chuckling of my own today. I had to convert my novel, completed at 3 am, to a text file so that I could upload it to be verified at the  urlLink NaNoWriMo  website as being large enough to qualify as a winner in the competition. Yep. I made it. My first attempt - beginners luck. I owe it all to my Grandma Lilah and her china teacup full of green tea that kept me awake long enough to finish it. Oh, I did a bit of sleep writing around midnight. Various new characters tried to creep in at that time... some old friends including one named Janet from my home town. She might find that pretty funny. I'll tell her about it some day maybe.   Anyway, while converting that novel, I found some real humor in all of the ridiculous twists the plot takes. I haven't read it all of the way through, you see. Don't know that I ever will either. Maybe some day when I need a good laugh. Could be fun. I flipped through it very quickly and added chapter headings this morning and saw characters that I had forgotten were in it. All in just a month of writing!   And I've only been running for two weeks. Imagine the twists and turns  this  adventure will take! So many more than the writing of a novel did... Hang in there with me cheerleaders and we'll have a whole new story to tell in the end.  The pledges keep rolling in. I'm certain to reach my hoped-for goal at this rate. Mr. Number-cruncher hasn't had time to plug in the numbers but once he's set in his new apartment I'll get him to do that and figure out where I'm sitting thus far if I hit that 500 mark... I'm aiming for the stars!!!  For my Keith...  Today's miles: 4.02 Total so far: 49.51 (argh! Had I known I was so close!) Still to go for goal: 450.49  I'm not giving tomorrow's run to anyone because I'm not certain I'll get to the treadmill with all that is happening. If I get there it will be gravy. I might get on just for that last .49 miles when I get home! Happy Sunday evening all.

       Today I ran in gratitude to all of you who have pledged my run and to everyone who already sent checks instead of pledging. I am so grateful for your generosity. It has been overwhelming and amazing. I am so touched and feel so blessed by my friends and family once again.   And what did I watch, you ask? Okay, maybe you didn't. Maybe you couldn't care less. But I'll tell you anyway. I watched  urlLink Matthew Broderick  in  urlLink  The Freshman ,  idea provided by  urlLink Bill  - Thanks Bill!   And Kent and Bonnie? I'll be over to raid your movie cabinet one of these days soon. I think the 5 for 5 deal at Mr. Movies only lasts through the end of December. :)   Here's how I did today...  Today's miles: 3.25 Total so far: 77.50 Still to go for goal: 422.5  Who should I run for tomorrow??? I KNOW! Tomorrow I run for the cheerleaders! I lurrrrrrrrrrvs my cheerleaders!

       Today I ran for Sydnor watching the first half of a movie called  urlLink  Possession   starring  urlLink Gwyneth Paltrow . It was an interesting movie and did a lot of flashback stuff utilizing a couple of actors from other English Period pieces (Emma, Pride and Prejudice),  urlLink Jeremy Northam  and  urlLink Jennifer Ehle . I finished watching it in the evening while doing a little knitting. What a waste that was. I was trying out some new yarn I purchased. It was a wonderful and soft type of chennile and at first I tried to crochette it into a scarf but the hook kept getting caught up in it so I switched to the knitting needles. Unfortunately I didn't fare any better with those (I'm not much of a knitter; I always feel as though I have two left hands).   I then had an extremely busy day (and Saturday was busy too, obviously!) but satisfying - I got a little Christmas shopping done, got some writing done with Marge (hi Marge!), went to see a movie for a birthday celebration (hi Carolyn!) and enjoyed time to breathe in front of the tree with the knitting needles at the end of the day. Also saw Keli off to the Wisconsin Dells in the morning before all of the rest took place!  Here's how the run went...  Today's miles: 3.00 Total so far: 74.25 Still to go for goal: 425.75  Tomorrow I'm running in gratitude of all of the wonderful people who are pledging me and who have sent fabulous checks because they are so wonderful and generous. THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH!

       Today I jogged for Marn with  urlLink  Bridget Jones  . God I love that movie. I have watched it a bajillion times and I laugh every time.  Every  time. It kills me with laughter. Laughter is a good thing on a treadmill. It makes you forget the pain. I love laughter. I love Bridget. And oh my god do I love Mark Darcy. Mmm mmm good. Keith is okay with that. Really he is. Because he knows that his romantic bent is easily as strong as any movie character. Yep. He and his romance can make me cry tears of happiness any day of the week. So he lets me love all these movie characters.   When I popped Bridget into the VCR I found that I had been watching her on another jog. So I was just getting to one of my favorite parts of the movie - her birthday - when she finds she is not something of a genius in the kitchen. A kindred spirit. When Mark comes over and finds her splattered with the makings of her birthday dinner and he helps her salvage what he can and they cook together side by side and it's all very romantic. I lurrrrrrrrrvs that part. And much of the rest of the movie.   Anyway. I enjoyed the run immensely. And knowing I was running for  urlLink Marn , that sexy and inspirational athlete from Canada who is the leader of the  urlLink 500 Club , well... that was just the icing on the cake today. I would have run much longer than I did because it was going so well, but I had to dash and get Keli to a chiropractor appointment since we missed yesterday's due to snow and furnace fixers and smoke detectors beeping and all of that.   Here's the stats...  Today's miles: 3.25 Total so far: 71.25 Still to go for goal: 428.75  Tomorrow I will run for Elizabeth's mom, Sydnor, who was diagnosed with lung cancer last June. She is going through chemo (second round) and her tumor has responded a bit... HURRAH! Keep on fighting Sydnor!!!

       Today I read while I moved. I decided I'd better get going on Return of the King if I'm going to have any hope of finishing it before I want to see the movie. Obviously I won't be finished before they release it, but I'll be done before I go. I won't be seeing it as soon as it opens because I can't stand fighting the crowds, but probably around my birthday I'll get to it.  It's pretty hard bouncing around on the treadmill and trying to read so I did a little more walking/jogging than running today, but once in a while that's got to be okay.  Besides, I was finished with my movies. I'll be glad when Christmas arrives and a new crop of movies has entered the house. Although, I did see that Mr. Movies has kicked off their 5 Movies/5 Days/5 Bucks promotion for the month of December, and with all of the great suggestions I've gotten, I could go down and get five to watch. Unfortunately, I can't possibly watch five on the treadmill in five short days unless I'm really going to pack on the miles in a short time! Anyway...  There was a beautiful sight when I awoke this morning and opened the shades. Snow had fallen during the night and coated the trees of the Woods of Wisconsin. It is incredible out there. Gorgeous. I'll hate driving in it when I have to go out tonight and get Keli from her friend's house after their usual Tuesday night together, but I'm enjoying looking at it! Glad I don't have to run out there in it! I'm thankful for my Lurch!  Here's how I did for Lauren and Dawn...  Today's miles: 3.50 Total so far: 68 Still to go for goal: 432  Tomorrow I will run for Marn who basically got me going on this whole idea by inspiring me with her own 500 mile idea and doing the Jog for the Juggs in Canada. You can see story here and find the history of her own trek within its pages. She was the brainchild of the 500 Mile Club. Her own lump was benign, but that certainly doesn't make her any less important in anyone's eyes for all the good that she has done for the cause. Thanks Marn! You're a peach, luv!

       Finished watching  urlLink  What Lies Beneath   while I ran for Brian. The last part of this movie is the worst part but I'll give nothing away in discussing it here.   This few weeks building up to Christmas is getting so busy. Am I going to always be running a day behind in my posts? Going to try and correct this.  I'm thrilled to report that I've heard back from a  third  of my friends and family who I sent my pledge letter to. That is so awesome. You all are fabulously supportive and I really appreciate it!   Today's miles: 3.25 Total so far: 64.5 Still to go for goal: 435.5  Tomorrow I'll run for Dawn again because the chemo is really knocking her on her butt this time. And I'm running for her daughter, too. Lauren is having a rough week, so kiddo, this one is also for you.

       I didn't skip the run on Sunday. I just never got back out here to write about it. So here in very condensed form is that info so I can get back on Lurch and do today's run...  (and I'm changing the date on the post to Sunday to keep track of everything)  Today's miles: 3.5 Total so far: 67.75 Still to go for goal: 432.25  Tomorrow I'm running for Brian P. He's a fellow BT warrior here in town and the dad of another sophomore at Keli's school. He's already had to battle one recurrence since dealing with the initial finding around the time Keith battled his. Nasty beasts these brain tumors.

       I ran today for Keli's best friend Annie's step great grandpa Carl. He is really sick right now. In fact, her mom is out visiting and not home because of how sick he is. And it is because of Cancer. So today's run was for Carl.  Keli and I watched  urlLink  Nine Months   together with  urlLink Hugh Grant  and  urlLink Julianne Moore  while I ran.   Today was supposed to be the family progressive dinner if you've been following my misadventures at all. Well that fell apart. Kind of like the family. Dad got sick several days ago. Mom got sick day before yesterday. Keli got hit with it yesterday. Niece got hit with something last night. I'm still feeling great (knocking on wood). Keith appears healthy. Sibs are all fine, and most of the other nieces and nephews are okay. We're still trying to pull together a date that will work for everyone for the makeup date.   Guess I'd best get back to my baking. Russian Tea Cakes are still on the agenda for this evening.   Today's miles: 3.5 Total so far: 98.5 Still to go for goal: 401.5  KathyK, how is dad doing?

       A quick run this morning before dashing off to my mom's to drop some things off and then it was off to meet Miss Marge for writing and gift exchange at Baker's Square (alright, there was some breakfast in there, too!) for a couple of hours and then BACK to mom's to make lasagne before the family progressive dinner tomorrow at eldest brother's house and then the folks' house. Did a little dashing about in the old home town, too to a couple of stores. It was another of those days!   Now I have some fast cleaning to do and then a grocery list to prepare for the holiday baking that must occur around here this weekend and early next week because WOW, Christmas is days away!  There is wrapping paper and bows and ribbon strewn about after Keli wrapped things for her friends last night and I've been working on getting things wrapped as well. I'm still trying to unpack the decorations and get them out. Man, it's just creeping up more and more quickly.   So this is it for today's post folks. Dashed off as quickly as possible because after cleaning and list making I have to dash off to get Keith from his apartment and then stop and get those groceries and then get back here to the house and get him settled in.  And now the dog is telling me it is his dinner time gosh darn it. And looking at the clock, I guess he's right!  Today's miles: 2.0 Total so far: 95.0 Still to go for goal: 405

       Did you ever have one of those days where you were running and running and you just felt like you were getting nowhere? :) Well that's me in a nutshell thank goodness! Wow! Past the 90-mile marker today! Should be able to hit the 100 mile goal by year end! That is cool. I never thought I would get this far so fast. I should have set a higher goal... don't tell anyone.   I'm finally getting somewhere on the Christmas thing, too. Started wrapping things today. That's cool, too. I hate the wrapping part. So tedious. I love how the tree looks once you get things under it, though. So I'll be glad to get a bunch of stuff finished so I can put them underneath the tree. It will be so much nicer that way. I might take out Keli's old wooden Brio train set and put  it  around the tree this year, too. Just for fun and for something different. We don't have any other real use for it anymore with no little ones in the family, so that would be kind of cute maybe.   Had to stop and do some more shopping on the way home from school tonight with Keli. She forgot a few of her friends last night. Shopping for all of the friends is a bit expensive. She's going to need to get a job if she's going to keep this up for next year. Wow. Her dad is going to be surprised when the bills come in on this one. I mean, it wasn't all for her friends, we did get a few things for him and for others, but I say again - Wow. She has a lot of friends. And I'm glad to see she is generous and the holidays aren't all about what  she  wants for Christmas anymore. But Wow.  Now I'd better go throw some dinner together. And feed the dog. He's looking at me with that pathetic "What about me?" sort of neglected look. Because you know, he's so neglected. Oh, and now he know's I'm writing about him. He's whimpering. He can tell. He's got a telepathic connection to all of us. He knows when we are thinking about him. He's smart that way. Just like he knows just when we hit that deep stage of sleep at night. That's when it is time for him to wake us up and tell us it's time for him to go back outside again. Poor thing. I think he has a little bladder thing or something (something being an "It's all about me and when you enter deep sleep you are no longer thinking, breathing, eating, sleeping or dreaming in my domain so wake up and get back to living your life for ME ME ME!!!"). Okay Bear. I'm coming.   Here are the stats for Phil's run...  Today's miles: 3.50 Total so far: 93.0 Still to go for goal: 407

       My dog is barking to come inside... it's cold out there!  So I'll be brief.  I ran a short one today in the hopes that I would be showering and rushing off to a massage appointment. Unfortunately, I got a phone call just as I was jumping into the shower saying that my massage therapist was under the weather.   So sad for her and so sad for me. I've been looking ahead with aching muscles to this for weeks!  So here are the stats for Tracey's run...  Today's miles: 2.50 Total so far: 89.50 Still to go for goal: 410.50  Tomorrow I'm running for Phil C.  I'm coming Bear... You can stop barking now!

       For all you BT Warriors out there, I ran for you today. This includes Tim, from the Brain Tumor conference in Denver - one of the most endearing men you'll ever want to meet and his sweet wife, and all of you out on the boards at NBTF that we've met along the way, and those we haven't had the opportunity to meet yet.   And I didn't run watching some movie to keep my mind off my pain and agony or the miles or the exhaustion, although, I did have some distraction.   I put in the new Christmas DVD  urlLink  Christmas with Chanticleer  . We saw this amazing group of men at The Ordway in St. Paul a couple of years ago and really enjoyed their concert, so this DVD was no disappointment. It wasn't as good as seeing them live, of course, but it was really fun to see them on stage again, even if only on TV. We have a few of their CD's, but this is better because they are all so yummy to look at. And because it can be so impossible to believe that all of the voices singing that music are male. They have an incredible vocal range!  So here are today's stats for the BT Warrior's run...  Today's Miles: 3.50 Total so far: 87.00 Still to go for goal: 413  Tomorrow I will run for Tracey, one specific friend of Keith's from the BT world.   Sure is quiet out here... sniffle.

       Today I ran for Alta's friend Joy. And I ran watching  urlLink  Gosford Park  . It was kind of a sleepy movie. And I was a bit of a sleepy runner. I just couldn't put  urlLink  Night Train to Venice   back in the VCR. I doubt I'll ever finish watching it. Oh well. Some movies are just like that. I did enjoy seeing  urlLink Jeremy Northam  again - he was in  urlLink  Gosford Park  , if only for a bit of annoyance as a Hollywood Star.   Then it was another run around kind of day. But I acccomplished some more spending for Christmas, that awful commercial holiday that it has become.   Here was Joy's run...  Today's Miles: 3.00 Total so far: 83.50 Still to go for goal: 416.5  Tomorrow for Keith, I will run for the many BT Warriors we have met along the path.

       I finished watching  urlLink  The Freshman   today with a young  urlLink Matthew Broderick  and a very old  urlLink Marlon Brando . Very cute. Nearly lost my cookies at the whole idea of the Gourmet Club, though!   After finishing that I popped in  urlLink  Night Train to Venice  . I've only seen about 10 minutes of it so far, but let's face it, I picked it up for  urlLink Hugh Grant  and I know nothing about it. So far? Bizarre. We'll see. The one review I just popped on at IMDB says "So bad that it's worth seeing!" uh oh.   Keli returns from the Wisconsin Dells today and then on our return from taking Keith to his apartment we'll hopefully stop and visit with my cousin Dianne who is in town this weekend celebrating Christmas with Uncle H and Aunt D and the gang. We want to get together with her and talk about Japan! Keli will be going there with her in April and this will be their only chance to get together and talk about it before then.   Now I'm going to go wrap some Christmas gifts before she arrives and tuck them under the tree. Hope everyone is having a good weekend.   Here are the cheerleader run stats...  Today's miles: 3.0 Total so far: 80.50 Still to go for goal: 419.5  Tomorrow I will run for my mother in law's dear friend Joy.   I broke the safety key that attaches to my clothes for the treadmill the other day. So now I'm just tucking it the waistband of my running pants. Last night I bought a tiny little clamp at the grocery store to use instead. I forgot to use it today. Will have to remember to attach it for tomorrow's run. If you are a treadmill user, always remember to use your safety key. Attach it to yourself. I have a long story which I refuse to post here because I have siblings (at least one sibling in-law) who read this blog and it is far too embarrassing to relate, but trust me. Safety keys are a good thing.   Use them.

       Got back on the horse so to speak.   Did it while reading today. Reading a really silly book. Trashy thing. The word erotic on the back should have been my first clue, huh?   It looked like a good mystery thriller for reading in the car during all that time I'm sitting in the car waiting for Keli.  It's a thriller all right. Phew!   Today's Miles: 3.5 Total so far: 104.5 Still to go for goal: 395.5  Hope Christmas was peaceful and happy for everyone. Hope all that are struggling had a little respite. KathyK, I know that things were pretty dodgy for you because of your dad's health. I hope he is doing better. Hugs.   And huge hugs to Annie and her family who lost Great Grandpa Carl early this week.

       I been slackin'.   Not runnin'.   Takin' time off.  LAZYYYYYY.  Today's Miles: 0 Yesterday's Miles: 0  It's true. Haven't done a thing.  But I'll get back on Lurch. I will. I know I will because I'm picking up Keith at his apartment tonight and he crack's the whip. He doesn't cut me any slack at all (as you can see from his comments when he's away).   So check back when you're done eating your Christmas Ham or whatever it is you'll be eating during your holidays if you celebrate something else.   Because I'll be racking up the miles again.   Hugs to my fabulous lyrical cheerleaders. You all are the bestest!

       Today I ran watching  urlLink  Face/Off   with  urlLink Nicholas Cage  and  urlLink John Travolta . It's a movie to keep the heart pumping all by itself with all of it's action and confusion and shoot-em-up bad guys and heroes.   I saw it once many years ago when out at Keith's mom's house for a holiday with the whole family, but couldn't remember most of it, so it was fun watching it with Keli and having her speculating on what was going to happen next. She hadn't seen it before. And she loves John Travolta, so she was enjoying his parts in it.   But the big news was hitting the 100-mile mark! Yahoo! I had set a goal of hitting 60 miles by the end of the year and I kicked that one in the butt! So I added my second rubber duck and am continuing on my way down that road to nowhere.  Today's Miles: 2.5 Total so far: 101 Still to go for goal: 399  Time to help Keith make his famous Fantasy Fudge... Then it's off to return him to his apartment. He says he feels like he is getting sick now. Hope he recovers quickly. Me... I'm still healthy as a horse and have every intention of staying that way. No  WAY  I'm getting sick. No way.

       Started out our day with brunch at neighbor Don's. What a great time! Keith and I walked over to their house for the 10 AM feast with our fellow Valley neighbors and it was fabulous. They had juices and coffee for drinks when we arrived. And within minutes of the last guests walking in the door, the spread was on... including a wonderful spinach/egg dish (because they know all about us weird vegetarians), fantastic cheesy potatoes, a huge bowl of fruit and wonderful dip, a huge platter of breads, there was another big bowl of eggs with canadian bacon, some wrapped sausages that the meat-eaters were raving about. It was all so great. We stuffed ourselves.   And we laughed until our faces hurt. It was wonderful to gather around the table again with our neighbors. We've done this once before. Two years ago for chili and pie. Again at Don and Sue's house. They are wonderful hosts. And terrific neighbors. We are lucky to have them. 'Specially me.   In fact, I was counting my blessings just the other day. That was the day of the strange pickup truck that came flying up my driveway. See, I live in the woods. At the end of a country road. And Keith is gone during the week. Keli and I were home alone and this pickup backed right up to my garage door. And sat there. And sat there. Nobody came to my door. I was still in my jammies. I ran with my dog to the bedroom to hide out because we have lots of windows without shades.   Lots.   And I waited for the doorbell to ring. Or for the pickup to drive away. And waited. And waited. And then I started waiting for the sound of crashing doors when whoever it was broke in. And my heart started racing. I put the dog down and he went to his bathroom window perch and started watching. Nothing happened. I snuck back out and looked out the door. The pickup was still sitting there so I grabbed the phone book and took it back in the bedroom with plans to call neighbor Don to ask his advice.   Keli then gave me the advice to put some clothes on. That was better advice. Then the dog went ballistic from his perch in the bathroom which I figured meant the truck was leaving. So I went and looked at the dog and out the window. Couldn't see any truck and the dog wasn't looking down the driveway or at the road. He was looking at the top of the driveway. I snuck back out and peeked. Truck was still there. In fact, now there were two.   Snuck back into the bedroom to finished getting dressed and as I picked up the phone, one of the trucks left.   The other one did not.   I called neighbor Don.    Me:  Don? This is Keri... Across the street...   Don:  Keri! What the hell is going on over there, you've got trucks driving all over your place!  Me:  I know! And nobody is coming to my door! They're just sitting over here!  Don:  I see one just left, are they gone now?   Me:  No, there is still one over here and nobody has ever come up to my door or anything. I have no idea what is going on and Keith isn't here. I was wondering if they've been up to visit you, too.  Don:  Nope, nobody's been up to visit me. You want me to come over there and ask 'em what the hell they're doing?  Me:  That would be so great.  Don:  I'll be right over.  He was driving up my driveway within two minutes with his big and loud dog in his cab with him. He told me today he would have had his shotgun with him, but that it would have taken him so long to load it they would have been gone by then (glad he skipped that step for more reasons than that!). He did bring his new digital camera with him to take pictures of the truck that was parked in the middle of my driveway blocking me in (good thing I didn't have an emergency and need to get out). The driver was gone and his tracks led off into the woods.   Turned out it was a couple of young guys hunting coyotes and chasing their dogs and they weren't bothering to ask owners' permission when they chased them onto private property.   Neighbor Don gave the guy an earful when he came down out of the woods because we waited out there for him. He let him know how wrong it was to be there without getting permission and then too, that they'd made me plenty nervous backing up to the house like that and hanging out there all that time without letting me know what was going on. I mean that was just plain stupid. I could have called the sheriff on them.   Ah well. As I say, I'm really glad to have such great neighbors. I appreaciate them in a big way.   I finished watching The Men Who Killed Kennedy tonight while I ran. Then I sat in the hot tub for a little while. That felt great. Here's the stats...  Today's miles: 3.0 Total so far: 122.2 Still to go for goal: 377.8

       Relatively...  No kidnappers, moosenappers, snownappers visiting. I went writing with my buddy Marge, then I met my buddy Carolyn for a movie. We saw  urlLink Something's Gotta Give . We enjoyed it!   Then I finished another mitten with the old crochet hook and checked in here. And who should be checking up on me?   Trudles!  So I thought I'd better get my rear in gear and hit the old  urlLink Lurch ...  Today's miles: 3.06 Total so far: 119.20 Still to go for goal: 380.80

       Yes, poor thing... Practically suffocated, stuffed in a plastic bag, and forced into our mailbox still wearing the paper napkin around its eyes.   Middle brother miraculously found it as he came visiting with his wife only a short while after the kidnappers were at our place, asking to borrow our digital camera (hoping to destroy the evidence perhaps???). Wish I'd had the presence of mind to snap their photo as they stepped in the front door (or to have grabbed the security camera footage from THAT time of day) to compare to the photo below, but I was too shook up from the whole incident.   Well, the snowman is now in my possession, a little shook up, but here and okay. Although Devil Dog did grab hold of the thing and drag him across the floor and have a good shake before anyone knew what was up. Guess he'd had enough of the excitement and attention being taken away from him on his birthday. I promised I would post  his  photo soon to make up for it. Stay tuned...  At any rate, the snownappers are still on the loose (so to speak) and armed and dangerous. And the moose is still missing. Poor mom was beside herself to hear that it had been Moosenapped from my place. She was quite worried about that and said "I'll never see it again!" when she heard. I think she wishes the exchange had taken place in her presence so she had had control over her own critter. Oh well. Now she'll have to deal with those dastardly characters herself. Sorry 'bout that one, Mom... Good luck.

       Update on the snownapping situation...  They visited/infilatrated our compound... Poor Keith was quite traumatized... tied up, gagged, left in a corner with a baggy containing a small carrot nose and the message,  RELEASE THE MOOSE AND YOU'LL GET THE REST OF THE SNOWMAN.   But when Devil Dog and I got out of the bathroom where we had been because I was showering from the run, I noticed my moose was gone. And released poor Keith from his bondage. And found this on the security camera footage:     As you can see, they are armed and dangerous. And they made off with the moose. Be on the lookout.

       Happy New Year to everyone and special Birthday greetings... First to Keith's mom, Alta, who is 29 years young and to our own Devil Dog, Hound of Hell, our little Bear, who turns 9 today.  Who sat up doing sit-ups through the midnight hour last night? Hutch? Was it you? ;) Not me. I was sitting by the fire with Keith. We were trying to get  urlLink URU  working on the old laptop. It didn't work. I was sad. I had been looking forward to it ever since  I  Santa  bought  gave it to us for Christmas.  I thought that would be how we would close out 2003, he and I... playing the new game of Myst... We've spent many hours together, huddled in front of the computer screen playing for hours the other games from the series.   But alas, this game is too new, too intensive for the "old" (four years) laptop. Then as I was reading through the instruction booklet, in order to go online and play at the URU live site, you have to have Broadband. Guess we'll be out of luck there, too, even if I do install it on a newer computer (Keith offered up his new work laptop). But we can still use the new laptop to play the box version. We'll do that one of these nights. It's a fun thing, to be lost in these other worlds for hours. We would "come to" around two or three am having discovered we had been playing for hours and had no idea it had been so long. I thought it would be so perfect for New Years Eve.   Keli spent her NYE at her best friend Annie's house. They watched movies and she was working (crochet) on her new scarf. She called for some instructions throughout the night. Wonder how far she got on it. Now it's nearly three in the afternoon and I haven't heard a thing from her. G-ma and G-pa have called to say they want to stop out for a while so I guess I'll have to call her to get her back here so they can come and ooh and aah over her Christmas presents.   In the meantime, here are my run stats for today. I got my stride length for my new pedometer so it will be easier to track my miles when I'm not on the treadmill (you know, next  summer  when the snow melts)...  The miles: 3.25 Total so far: 116.14 Still to go for goal: 383.86

       First off, I must apologize to my bro, Kent. Because whether he did it or not, jumping to conclusions about him being the snownapper was just wrong. Besides, he doesn't have a digital camera and couldn't have sent this to my in-basket right after our family party before I'd even noticed that my new snowman hadn't come home with me:    Don't involve the authorities or it's the greenhouse for Mr. Snowman       And on with today's run...  The miles: 3.14 Total so far: 112.89 Still to go for goal: 387.11  That one was for you Vonnie. Hugs to you and all your family. Much love from ours.    Happy New Year My Darlings!

       First of all, it seems that the comments on this site are down more than they are working lately. I may have to switch which comments I'm using. If I do that I'm going to lose all of the ones I've collected so far, though. That will suck. But I really like getting comments and I hate it when you guys can't leave them. So I'll be changing that in the next couple of days if things don't improve quickly within Blogspeak.   Migraines also suck. But I swore I'd get some time on Lurch if I had to crawl.   It was a weird day today. Strange pickups in the driveway. The headache. The dog being obnoxious (oh wait, that's normal).  Keli is off at a New Year's Eve Eve party tonight. I'm catching up on some reading and might do some crocheting.   Here are today's stats...  Today's miles: 2 Total so far: 109.75 Still to go for goal: 390.25  Tomorrow I'll run for Vonnie, a dear friend of the family who just learned of her cancer. This really sucks, you know? I don't like having new victims to run for. We're all praying for you, Vonnie. I hear you have an MRI coming up. Fingers crossed here.

       Okay, Christmas is finally over. My family had it's party yesterday and I can get back to business around here. No more days off. Not even New Years. I'm finished with the slackin'.   I ran while watching a tape that Alta's roomie got for The Warrior from The History Channel - The Men Who Shot Kennedy. Pretty interesting stuff. I've always been interested in this stuff. He was killed a couple of years before I was born, but I find the topic fascinating still.   Finished that trashy book. WOWSER! Did pass it on to my folks. :) Think they can handle it? I should have mailed it out to KathyC... I remember she used to love those books... hehehe. It isn't harlequin, but I think you might have liked this one Kath... It wasn't at all a typical old romance, though. It was twisted!  Okay, here are the stats for today...  Today's Miles: 3.25 Total so far: 107.75 Still to go for goal: 392.25  Sorry to have kept you from your shower for so long Trudi. Glad you are clean and tidy once again. And Kent? If you're reading? I want my snowman back.

       Yesterday was a busy one full of dashing here and there and eating good food with friends and never being home, but today I managed to climb aboard Lurch for a run with  urlLink Brad Pitt . I didn't quite finish  urlLink  The Mexican   yet, but almost. Now it's on to housework and then to the University to see Keli in the St. Croix Valley Honors Band this afternoon. Tomorrow she and an ensemble perform Carol of the Bells (Lorrie Line's arrangement) at another concert and on Monday evening her Wind Ensemble has yet another concert. It's days and days of music for me to attend, but I love it.   Here are the stats for today...  Today's miles: 3.25 Total so far: 139.68 Still to go for goal: 360.32

And I was running for Keith's coworker, Phil, who as Keith puts it, "He's a 5+ year survivor of some pretty challenging cancer. But, he's got attitude and that counts for tons!" So this one was for you, Phil!  Today's Miles: 3.25 Total so far: 136.43 Still to go for goal: 363.57  Vonnie has begun her chemo treatments. Hope you are feeling better soon!

       Okay - now that I see it side by side with other reindeer, I accept that my moose, is indeed a reindeer. And I must say, a very sad looking reindeer... you might think it looks happy with those other stuffed things of its kind, but what it really wants is me. My happy little loving arms around it. It misses me. You can see it in the eyes. Mine is the one without the tag - the big one on the left. Poor baby. It's crying for me. Let it come home! Please!   By the way, this photo was taken at the deernappers' home... so they let it bond with these other critters, and then took it away from them and brought it back to my folks' house where it was tossed back on the bench by the door just waiting for me to lift it again. It was  waiting  for me I tell you!  How come I didn't get this picture? I had to send it to myself from the folks' house! The travesty... The injustice. And my daughter, the tattletale. "I'm not a tattletale... I'm the zookeeper!" She wouldn't even let me try and slip it back out of their house tonight. I'm so ashamed to have raised such a little loudmouth. She must have gotten that from Keith.

       I did it. I ran. I watched the first half of  urlLink  First Knight   which I've seen before, but it is a good one to get caught up in. Keli got it from her best friend for Christmas. It has  urlLink Richard Gere ,  urlLink Sean Connery  and  urlLink Julia Ormond  starring.   So for Tricia's run...

       I was lazy yesterday.   It was Keli's first day back at school so I had the day to myself and I slept. All day. I needed a vacation from vacation. I had weird dreams, too. In one, a cement truck came racing up my driveway and I called Neighbor Don to come and investigate!  So today, I'm back in the game. I'm off to visit Lurch right now. I'll let you know the outcome when I get done. More in a bit...  Oh, but before I go, Keli told me yesterday that her math teacher, Tricia B, did not manage to kick her cancer. I went to school with Tricia, back when she was Tricia N. I don't know what her next course of treatment will be, but I'm really sorry to hear about it. Today's run is in honor/support of Tricia...

       I can't believe it is the final day of holiday vacation. It went so fast. Keli goes back to school tomorrow. I don't think she'd count this as one of the stellar holiday breaks of all times. There is a gloomy cloud hanging over the house right now. I won't name that cloud, but it is tough to see the silver lining of it. Believe me, though, I'm searching for it.   It's been cloudy and cold here today. Keith is soaking in the hottub. It's always a good place for him when I Lurch it because I really have to crank the video up to high volume in order to hear it over my feet pounding on the treadmill. Today's movie of choice:  urlLink  Bend it Like Beckham  . Loved it again. Highly recommend it.  Today's miles: 3.0 Total so far: 125.2 Still to go for goal: 374.8  Hurrah! Over a quarter of the way there! Yippee! According to Marn on the  urlLink Going Nowhere  site, that means, I get to put a quarter of the way there icon (you'll see the dancing chicken) now by my rubber ducks... :)

       Keli's first date was "fun". They went to see  urlLink Big Fish  and really enjoyed it. She was home seconds after I arrived with Keith after picking him up at his apartment for the weekend. Her date seems like a really nice guy.   My massage was fabulous. Ahhhhh. That's all I need to say about that.  And Dad, being the wonderful hubby that he is, bought Mom a souvenier on his trip to Green Bay with bro Kent this past week... I'll have to provide a photo one of these days if I ever get to see it again... It was a moose in a GB Packer sweater. :)   Stats for today...  The run: 3.1 miles Total so far: 161.3 Still to go for goal: 338.7  I've gotten such support from so many people to whom I sent pledge requests! It has been incredible. Thank you all so much!

       Keli has a first date tonight. I have a massage! Hurrah for me! But that means I have to rush back here so I'm here in time to meet the new man when he comes to pick her up before they slip off to the movie... Any spies who are interested, they'll be at the Hudson theater for a movie this evening. He's pretty handsome, and about a foot taller than she! She'll get used to it. I did!   Sadness abounds tonight due to Vonnie's passing. I know that she was in a lot of pain, though. But I won't sit here and say it was a blessing that she went quickly. Those platitudes don't make anyone feel any better really. Love and hugs to her family. She will be missed.   Stats for today...  Today's run... 3.2 miles Total so far: 158.2 miles Still to go for goal: 341.8  Will work on comments this weekend while Keli is off being a social butterfly and Keith is out in the hot tub.

       Comments are being transferred to Haloscan and more information is coming about that in the days ahead. I'll keep ya'll posted as to how it's coming along.   Finished watching  urlLink Pirates  last night as I ran for Dawn. I've run for Dawn before, but I had to do it one more time because I was so happy to hear that she had her last chemo treatment for her breast cancer on Tuesday of this week. This was a celebratory run in honor of that!   So here's the stats...  Today's run: 3.60 miles Total so far: 153 Still to go for goal: 347  Hurrah! This means I've earned another rubber duck!   We received a lovely card in the mail from Barb at the dental office yesterday. Thanks Barb!  You  and Bernie inspire us. Hugs again to both of you.   A space for comments coming soon, I hope. I miss hearing from all of you...

       If I want to use the computer anymore, I have to use it before 3 pm because my daughter has discovered the joys of MSN messenger with her friends and the joys of making new friends at her school among friends of her friends by using MSN. I've created a monster by showing her how to use it. I basically have to give up all use of the computer from the time she gets home from school now until well past our bedtimes.   And that means my run time can be switched to after school because she doesn't want me anywhere near her computer conversations. But I can't report on my run times until the next day!   So here are the stats for the run from Tuesday night, with another bit of beloved  urlLink Johnny Depp  and handsome  urlLink Orlando Bloom  and  urlLink Pirates of the Caribbean ... It's another for you, Bernie!  Today's miles: 3.22 Total so far: 149.4 Still needed to goal: 350.6  Tomorrow I'm running for Dawn in celebration of the fact that today was her final chemo treatment! Congratulations!!!  Regarding comments, I'm still hanging on, because the latest word is that there may be a transfer to Haloscan (another site) which means our current comments will go there and we wouldn't lose anything if all goes well. Just hang in there for a while longer with me. In the meantime, you can always send me an e-mail! :) You know where to find me!

       As you can see, unless things have changed that is, there is currently no place for you to leave comments and no place to go read what has been written by anyone.   That sucks. Truly.   At the bottom of the page you will see a box (until I change it) which says "Comments Powered by Blogspeak". If you clicked on that box earlier yesterday, it gave the message  "Comments are down but they should be up later this evening."   I was torked about this news, but hey, they are free. Everything about this site, other than our internet connection and my time, is free at the moment, so who am I to complain?  This evening, when I click on that box, the message that I get is this:   "BlogSpeak is currently down because the bastards that host it decided to suspend my account. I do not know as of yet when this situation will be resolved. If you don't want any JavaScript errors on your pages, take the code off for the time being. Thanks for your patience."   For the time being (and because it is very late and I would like to go to bed soon), I am going to leave things as they are because I am hopeful that he will get things together and all will work out for the best. I have a big day with a trip to Hutch's place tomorrow for lunch and visiting (hurrah!) and I won't have time to work on this site, either. With luck, by the time I get back, comments will be working and I won't have to do  anything!   So if you've been wondering what is going on, there is your answer. Thank you for your visits and keep on visiting because I know that you are stopping even if you don't get to comment. That little rainbow colored box at the bottom tells me you are visiting and checking up on me. I don't know all of the time WHO you are, but I know how many of you are stopping by. And it means a lot to me. It keeps my butt moving and my feet on the treadmill.   See you soon. Very soon. Only hours from now. Like six or seven. When I have to drag my sorry butt out of bed (yikes, that's only five from now) to get Keli off to school. Then I have to stay up to get the run done before I go off to see Hutch (I'm so excited!!!).

       So today's run is a fast one before I dash off again for the final concert of the long weekend.  I saw our dental hygenist today and got the update on her husband, Bernie. Huge hugs to you both, Barb...  This one is for you, Bernie...  Today's miles: 2.75 Total so far: 146.18 Still to go for goal: 353.82  And since today was so short, tomorrow is for Bernie, too. What a long road he's been down with his cancer. Wow. And what good people Barb is. Wish I could sit down with her for a long cup of coffee some day. Maybe we'll get that chance.

       Another day, another concert. And it was a good one. First we got to hear the freshmen concert band, followed by Jazz II, then Keli's special ensemble piece and finally Jazz I. There were some bugs with not enough microphones set up for the ensemble, and the drummer tossing his drumstick exuberantly at one point, but the music itself was wonderful for Carol of the Bells. I'm looking forward to hearing it again tomorrow night when they'll hopefully have more mikes set up and we'll get to hear all of the solos.   Tonight I ran finishing off  urlLink  The Mexican   and then  urlLink  Pirates   with Keli by my side. Keith is out in the hot tub under the clouds I suppose. We had a light and pretty dusting of snow this afternoon. There isn't any falling now, but I don't think the sky has cleared up any.   The stats...  Today's miles: 3.75 Total so far: 143.43 Still to go for goal: 356.57

       Happy Birthday Jena! And Happy Belated Birthday Caitlin... I seem to be forgetting to do this happy wishing thing for my family members as they come up...   It's my burfday again, too... Sort of. We didn't get a chance to celebrate it together on Tuesday with Keith at his apartment, so we get to celebrate it today. Keli was more excited about this than she was about Christmas she said last night as we picked Keith up at his apartment. So she came up and made me open my present this morning before we got anything else going on the party.   Bear helped. He likes opening presents and ripping the wrapping paper to shreds.   Keli got me the Harry Potter movies on DVD! Which is totally cool, considering what Keith got me. I can't announce that yet since I haven't officially opened it yet, so I don't  know  for sure. But Keli and I have known about the gift for weeks and have been really excited and waiting extremely impatiently for me to receive it so we can put it to use, so... when I get it, we're going to have a HP movie party or two with popcorn and everything prior to the opening of  urlLink  HP3  .   I also opened (with Bear's help) my gift from Dranny Alta and Great Grandma Dot. Dranny Alta painted really cute pictures on the outside of the mailing box - I'll have to take pictures because it is really awesome. Wish I had the talent! I received two really cute new tops from Alta and an awesomely inspirational new journal to write in from Dorothy. Love it all! I was kind of hoping for another box of Frango mints in the box, too. But how could she know that I reward myself with one mint at the end of each run (okay, sometimes two at the end of a particularly  good  run) from the box that she sent us at Christmas. Nobody else around here is particularly excited about them, so I get them to myself for the most part (hurray!). Who's complaining, though? I LOVE my gifts!!! Thank you both!  Keith is out in the kitchen now slaving over my birthday cake. There are strange noises coming from out there. He went to the store by himself this morning while I did my run and came home with  four  different containers of ice cream. I had to laugh at him. He said he wouldn't have had so much but the neighbors were there and they thought he looked like he needed help picking it out. LOL!!! So they helped him. I LOVE our neighbors!  Just found out what the noises were - he's blowing up balloons. What a sweetie!   Okay - so on with the run. I finished watching  urlLink  West Side Story   today (not completely while running - I sat down and finished with Keli afterwards) and did the following run...   Today:  3.36  Total so far:  180.10  Still to go for goal:  319.9  See you tomorrow!  Oh, and I hear Jena found the Moose and Reindeer in their hiding place! Way to go, Jena!!! Let's hope those two little mischievous characters stay put now and don't cause any more trouble for Grandma...

       The week is winding down! Keith comes home tomorrow and Keli's social activities ramp up... She had pep band tonight for wrestling. Tomorrow night there may be a party to attend. Sunday we have Phipps tickets to River Falls Brass... The weekend will go quickly again.   I finished watching  urlLink  A Mighty Wind   last night with Keli so today for my run it was onto something new... I chose the new DVD of the old  urlLink  West Side Story  . Man, I could watch  urlLink George Chakiris  and  urlLink Rita Moreno  dance the Mambo forever. What a great scene! The picture and the sound on the DVD are excellent. I'm really pleased to see how well they got the old film cleaned up.   Here are the stats from the run...   Today:  3.08  Total so far:  176.74  Still to go for goal:  323.26  I'll be back! Hey Mr. Number-Cruncher... Are my numbers still checking out okay???

       Sunny day! And 30 degrees... A heat wave!   I just saw the biggest hawk flying away through the woods. Wish I had seen it sitting in the tree at the edge of the turnaround before it took off. It was amazingly huge. I'm not feeding birds here this winter as I usually do because I got so tired of feeding squirrels and providing little birds for the huge birds of prey. I just couldn't stand it anymore. So I wonder why it was hanging out here? It could have taken the little frozen dead mouse that I pushed out of the garage a couple of weeks ago, but I don't think that would have been of interest to it.  I finished watching  urlLink  Apocalypse Now   while I did my run. Why do I find so many movie endings unsatisfactory? I'll just have to go into the business of writing movies myself so I can always end them myself... :)  When I finished that one, I started watching  urlLink  A Mighty Wind  . I'm grinning the whole while just because I find satire so darned satisfying and I myself actually enjoy folk music, so I can laugh at the fact that they are making fun of that, too.  For today's stats...  The run: 3.25 Total so far: 173.66 Still to go for goal: 326.34  See you tomorrow!

       I didn't get on Lurch until noon today - or actually a little after noon. Because I let myself sleep in (there's a surprise for you!) since it's   my birthday!   But then I popped in  urlLink  Apocalypse Now   and climbed aboard for today's run and in honor of Gerry C, I did today's run.  And with the remainder of my day? I'll be picking Keli up from school, heading to the folks' for some dinner and socializing, and heading back home where the kid and I will read our books (she: The DaVinci Code; me: The Wayward Bus by Steinbeck) before hitting the hay. A real exciting day, huh? :) Hope you all have a day that is just as exciting!  Here's the stats...  The run: 4 miles Total so far: 170.41 Still to go for goal: 329.59

       Keli had the day off from school. So we all got to sleep in around here. Even Bear, who was recovering from his prize-fight with the Gonzo yesterday.   Gonzo is Bear's Christmas toy. When I can get a photo of Gonzo and Bear together, I will. They are quite a pair. I call it Gonzo, because it looks like, well, a little like the old muppet named Gonzo. But only slightly. Keli says not at all. It is a dog toy with a tennis ball for head and lower body. It has stretchy arms and legs. It has these googly eyes (well, one eye these days as Bear removed one a while back). It has a squeaky thing inside that Bear sometimes manages to hit while attacking. He goes for the jugular mostly. And has ripped its lips mostly off - just red thread there.   Well, I think Gonzo got tired of being attacked yesterday because he attacked back. While participating (okay, not participating exactly... Gonzo was more being the participatee) in a tug of war between Bear and Keith, somehow he ripped himself out of Keith's hand and swung around and threw himself violently into Bear's eye. Same eye that Bear had torn violently off Gonzo's face, in fact.   We really thought Bear was going to  lose  that eye for much of yesterday. He walked around looking like Rocky Balboa after a particularly rough fight with Apollo Creed... eye swollen shut and kind of runny... Had it not been for the black fur, we probably would have seen some amazing colors there, too... But later in the day we noticed something interesting. When he was looking away from us and out the window or something, we could tell both eyes were open, but the minute we would come around to look at him face on or call him to have him turn toward us... eye shut. Just like that.   Smart damn dog. Playing on the sympathies all over the place. Walked around winking at us all evening. When I got home from dropping Keith off at his apartment? He was just fine. No swelling, no winking, no tearing up. Fine. Keith says it was all an act to make him feel bad. I'm beginning to agree.   And to think, I almost ran for him...  Today's run: 2 miles Total so far: 166.41 Still to go for goal: 333.59  Tomorrow I'm running for Gerry C... KathyK's dad... His chemo is no longer working on his cancer. I am just so damn sick of this disease and what it is doing to the people that I love and their loved ones. It makes me so angry. I love you, Kath. I wish I could be there with you to give you a hug and just wrap you up in comfort. I'm sorry, hunny-bunny...

       Done with the run before noon! I like it when that happens. Now I can do other stuff with my day and not have that hanging over me.   I'm running while watching  urlLink Apocalypse Now . Reason being, I took a quiz the other day called "What Classic Movie Are You?" and that's the movie I ended up being... Seeing as how I've never  seen  that particular flick, I couldn't actually judge the acuracy of the quiz, so I rented it last night to view as my latest running film. I mean, it  sounds  about right by the description and all... "rogue wanderer on the winding river of life..."          urlLink What Classic Movie Are You?

       Nope, it didn't take me this long to recover...   Yesterday, though, was so busy as to be considered a totally crazy day. I spent the morning in Hudson at Perkins with my writing buddy. Hi Marge! While there, I had a brief but nice chat with Carol and Tom M. Hi Mr. and Mrs. M! They were saying they were going to be heading out on their Caribbean Cruise any day now. I hope they have a wonderful time. I told them they should take another Alaskan Cruise so that we could stow away with them. That's someplace I'd like to get one of these days.   After Perkins I had a little running around to do in Hudson - just a couple of errands and then I had to dash back home for a couple of things before the next bit of running around.   Because at 3 I had to be down at the high school to pick up Keli and a couple of her good friends, Brendan and Lauren. We had some power shopping to do for tonight's Swing Dance. The girls needed to outfit Brendan in appropriate Swing Dance clothing so the first stop was Goodwill in Stillwater where they found him an excellent vest and jacket. After that it was off to the Mall of America for  HOURS  of shopping (the girls wore him out). We hit Ragstock where they found him pants and a great hat. Keli also found a terrific outfit to wear while there. I hope to get a good photo tonight that I'll post here tomorrow if I'm able.   We wrapped things up as the stores were closing at 9:30 and then headed to Chanhassen to get Keith.  Dropping the kids off at their homes around 11:15, I guess we got to bed around midnight. It was an exhausting night.   Hey Dad, remember the sound that awful scorpion bug-like thing made, that dug its way into Neo's belly in  The Matrix ? I think it's in my left ear. I've heard it there every once in a while whenever I look down at the floor. It's back again today.   I'm having prophetic dreams lately, too. The latest ones are telling me that my brothers need to have their blood pressure checked and I need to get back in and have my meds updated because my blood pressure is too low now. Interesting, huh? Anybody put any stock in their dreams?   Okay, on with today's run...   The miles:  3.4  Total so far:  192.9  Still to go for goal:  307.1  As we head in to the first week of February, I'm going to devote the miles this week to some special friends. Tom and Janet have lost a lot of family members to cancer and as a result have gotten heavily involved in the local Relay for Life. They give a  lot  of their time and energy and money to this cause when it comes up. Their whole family does in fact. I can't even tell you what all they do for it. I know Janet was working in the tent selling the luminarias if I'm not mistaken for the last few years at the event. But for the weeks working up the event she's busy doing stuff to help get ready for it, too. She helped our team out last year with garage sales, too. Their daughter Kathy cooks the breakfast starting around 2 in the morning while the rest of us are trudging around the track or else sleeping and then has to listen to either raves about it or complaints about it when people come up to get their food. Their son Mike does his share of helping, too. They all do a lot to get involved and help out.   But the reason they are heavily on my mind this week isn't cancer. It's another poison. The anniversary of their son Danny's murder is coming up on Thursday. I think about Danny and James and that cold February day every single day that goes by. I wonder when their murders will be solved, because I know that it will. I can't go through life imagining that it won't. I wonder how this could happen in our sleepy little town. I wonder how anybody could do such a horrible thing to two bright and beautiful young men. And I pray that Tom and Janet and Tom Jr., Kathy, Mike, Jennie and especially Kaitlyn and Kyle are living life every day to the fullest and not allowing the poison of not knowing to eat away at their quality of life. That would have to be such a difficult task. But such a necessary one.   So I run this week for Tom and Janet. And for their family. I run this week for Danny and James. And for the people who love them. I run this week for an answer. Because I want to see the killer(s) caught.

        Stomach pains...   Warning:  Too much information ahead...  I think after a really bad run in at Angel's in Stillwater back in September with a soup they deceptively named Cabbage Soup, I am now forevermore unable to eat cabbage in any form without getting really bad pains in the stomach. Their soup  should  have been named sauerkraut soup since that's what it was made with and it was   n*a*s*t*y  .  I had bad pain all night and all day today after having another dish with cabbage in it for dinner last night.   Therefore, I didn't run today. Sorry to disappoint.  Amazingly, however... I did receive yet another check in the mail today from another fabulous donor. My friends and family are so unbelievably generous!  Thank you all again! I am going to so make this 500 mile goal by June 1! I've nearly made 200 already! I'm hoping to to be done with 500 by the end of April even! That would be so awesome... then I could kick back and slow down and relax a little bit. I'll continue to run but I won't have to be so stressed out about it. Because I've set a personal goal of running a thousand miles by the end of the year just to continue getting in shape! Of course, if I slow down too much, I won't make that goal.   Well, I have to go pick up Keli from play practice now. She is studying with the Stage Manager to take over as the next stage manager when she graduates next year so Keli can do that job on the future plays at the high school next year possibly. She is really excited about this and hopes it will work out for her.   Send me some healing vibes so the cabbage worm in my stomach moves out soon. It sure is a pain. Thanks...

       What a deceptively gorgeous day here in the big woods of Wisconsin! Blue skies and beautiful crystal snow sparkling on everything.   But darned cold.   Our high today is going to be 5 degrees farenheit. The tree tops are swaying in the breeze and we are under severe wind chill advisory.  I finished watching  urlLink  Bootmen!   today while I did my run. Today I ran for a local celebrity who just underwent surgery for her recently discovered breast cancer. In the afternoon here there is a twin cities radio show called Moon and Stacey that Keli and I giggle over once in a while and Stacey is recovering at home but still doing the show from there after her surgery. Today's run was for her. I wish her well, as I wish everyone battling the beast well.   Cancer sucks.    Today's miles:  4.0  Total so far:  189.5  Still to go for goal:  310.5  I'll be back!

       Okay. Finally got the computer back so I can log the miles I ran. See. I  did  run while it was snowing. I just couldn't get back on to TELL you about it.   If I wasn't waiting for the computer, I was out driving around in the snow delivering Keli to play practice at the high school or waiting for her while she was there.  So now I'm home and here's what I did... Oh yeah - and while I was running, I was watching  urlLink  Bootmen  ! Because I'm on a dancing theme here this week...   Today's miles:  3.20  Total so far:  183.3  Still to go for goal:  316.7  See you tomorrow!

       Well gang...  A frozen septic is certainly going to put a cramp in my style for this run. It won't make me stop running, but it will sure make me stop and consider when I'm going to run and if I'll need a shower/clean up anytime soon. I'm going to have to think things through  very carefully  as I climb aboard Lurch.  What is it with this weather? How discouraging!  Will wait to put a call in to Roger until tomorrow because the alarm didn't even stay on long enough to get to the basement to put it on silent, so it may have been one of those situations where the floater got hung up in some ice when it came up for just a second and then went back down again. We'll see if it comes on again maybe before we call him.   Uggggggh!

       The weekend has arrived again. And again, Friday was too busy for running because I was running too much! If I am able to find it, I will have a post for yesterday to finish off the week of thoughts for Danny, James and their families. I wrote a letter to a stranger a couple of years back after the murders and  that  is what I'd like to close this week with, but it will take some digging because I haven't been able to turn it up just yet.  So today I ran with a little bit of  urlLink  Bridget Jones   (again!) and a little bit of Tom Petty larger than life on my wall. Made for a fun run to watch videos from  urlLink  Playback   as I went along. One of my favorites is I Won't Back Down, backed up by Ringo Starr on the drums and George Harrison on guitar, among others. Gotta love that.   Now Keli is at a party and we are spending a quiet evening together and so I'll make this short.   G'night all...   Today's miles:  3.19  Total so far:  211.62  Still to go for goal:  288.38  Until tomorrow...

          can't believe it's been two years... our town loved your dimpled grin  your warm heart and open arms  for every one who came within  you were taken from us much too early and it came as such a shock  the cold of february won't be the same for someone stopped the clock  we still do not have answers but i know someday we will  it won't make the loss any easier but perhaps some fears it will still  everyone felt warmed by the sight of you you were so generous with your heart  thus, all were stunned and saddened when it came time for us to part  oh Danny Boy we miss you but we know that you are fine  telling stories to Saint Peter and sharing the good Lord's wine

       This one was for you, Tom and Janet and for your family... I have never met a family who spread more sunshine and love than your family has to more people in a community. You deserve only happiness and love coming back to you. I'm so sorry that this happened to you. It breaks my heart every time I think of it. And I think of it every day.  And for the family of James, too.

       Yahoo! Got a haircut!   Now the hair won't be hanging in my eyes during my run. This is a very good thing.   Made myself late for the appointment by getting carried away running today.  This is for you, Danny and James!   Today's miles:  3.5  Total so far:  204.39  Still to go for goal:  295.61  Back later...

       A shorty...  And a quickie.  Ran while watching the end of last week's Gilmore Girls and One Tree Hill so I'd be ready to watch this week's when we go to the folks' house tonight!  It's great to see them on tape (thanks mom!) so I can buzz past the commercials...   For Kathy today - because she makes me laugh whenever I meet up with her during those crazy garage sales and the Relay, too... She's true to your memory, Danny, and carries so much love in her heart it's nearly bursting for you...   Today's miles:  2.0  Total so far:  200.89  Still to go for goal:  299.11  How're those numbers???   Awesome! I made 200!!!  Another duckie!

       Keli got the day off school today due to the snow. And what a snow it is! It is still coming down and it must have snowed all night. I think we have 6-8 inches out there so far. It is a really fine powder or we'd have a lot more.  I just got off the treadmill. We hung some sheets on the windows downstairs so we could see the projected movies on the wall during the daytime really well. Finished watching HP1 before starting Lurch and then ran with some of Bootmen as Keli wanted to watch it again. When I finish posting this I'll shower and then we'll watch HP2 together. Don't know what we'll watch after that, but it's a movie kind of day since we are snowed in.   Maybe some tomato soup and grilled cheese sammiches are called for as the dinner of the day, too...  Here are the stats on another run for Danny, James, Jan and Tom...   Today's miles:  2.65  Total so far:  198.89  Still to go for goal:  301.11  Hope the snow stops soon! I wonder if the kids will still have play practice tonight? Hope not!

       Kicking off the month with a bang as it is snowing here to beat the band. Last winter we always seemed to get a good snow on the evenings or days that I either had to drive to the cities to drop Keith off or pick him up. Well, it is Sunday and I get to take him back to his apartment this evening. First we'll drop Keli off at Bren's for their RP game of the week and then we'll head off. Should be an interesting drive.   The kids had a great time at the Swing Dance last night. Yes, the stalker was there, but I had my eye on him all night. So did Rhonda and lots of Kel's friends. I even alerted her football player friend, Matt. Don't these three look awesome after the "shop til we drop" experience?       After this photo was snapped, I hardly saw them  off  the dance floor again!   Well, here are the stats from my first run for Tom and Janet, and Danny and James... It might have been cold and snowy outside, but it was hot and sweaty down on the treadmill!   Today's miles:  3.34  Total so far:  196.24  Still to go for goal:  303.76  Be back tomorrow...

       Running with the WB... Mom taped our shows for us on Tuesday night - our "Must see TV" night, so tonight I ran with Gilmore Girls and One Tree Hill. Didn't get all the way through Tree, but will finish it up with tomorrow's run, if I get one in on my typically busy Friday.   Gorgeous sunny day today, but chilly. Tomorrow we're gonna have a heat wave, though! 34 degrees farenheit! Woo hoo! Celebrating getting above freezing, how does that work?   Got a Valentine in the mail from the folks' today! Thanks mum and dad!   Keith got a big Valentine box in the mail a couple of days ago. He'll be surprised... I get to talk about it here because he hasn't been visiting the site, but I won't give away what it is until after the actual day. Maybe I'll even get a photo put up after the fact. :)  Talked with my MIL today. She told me of a really cool project she is working on. There is a program out there thought of by a young girl who was undergoing cancer treatments... she had to travel back and forth to the hospital during her treatments and became very attached to a special blanket, so she came up with the idea that all cancer kids should have a special blanket of their own. Thus was born her idea of cancer quilts for these kids. So people make quilts for the kids and donate them. I guess 25 were donated last year. Alta is pretty crafty with her sewing machine and has decided to help out with these quilts and is working on some now! Very cool idea!    Today's miles:  3.5  Total so far:  226.01  Still to go for goal:  273.99    Thanks to everyone for your continued cheerleading and support! You can't believe how much I appreciate seeing your comments!

       Very excited! Going to see Calendar Girls today after I pick Keli up at school. Heading there with Mom and Janet and Alva. It should be a  fun  time with the ladies. I think I'm going to have more fun laughing at my companion's reactions than at the movie, what do you think?   Would you believe it is snowing here again? We have really missed out ont he snowfall over the past few winters, so we could probably really use the moisture as we've had less rain in the summers, too. It makes the woods quite lovely.   I got another box in the mail yesterday from Alta - a Valentine! I can't wait to open it. I'm so spoiled. I don't send any Valentines out, but I receive them. How lucky is that?   Finished watching  urlLink  Pay it Forward   while I ran today. No matter how many times I watch this movie, I will cry like a baby for the last ten minutes of it. I love this film. I have to return it to Mr. Movies tomorrow, but if Keli doesn't have too much homework after watching Calendar Girls tonight, she'll want to finish watching it, too. More tears!   Today's miles:  3.0  Total so far:  222.51  Still to go for goal:  277.49  Back tomorrow. The week is flying by...

       Running short.  Watching Josh Groban's DVD that came with the CD I bought over the weekend. Hard to believe this young kid has a singing voice like that. Wow.   Also watched a little of  urlLink  Emperor's New Groove .  Yep. Disney. Kronk makes me laugh.    Today's miles:  2.0  Total so far:  219.51  Still go go for goal:  280.49  Until tomorrow... Tomorrow I'm running for Chris's cousin Michael, per Alta...

       I  never  get the computer time anymore!  Ran watching  urlLink  Pay it Forward   today.   Currently  reading  Mystic River by Dennis Lehane. I had been told that the book is so great - much better than the movie, which I think is usually true of books that have been made into movies pretty much all of the time. But I have to say that with this one? I've almost never read a book in which the movie has more closely followed it. There has been very little difference. Things have been very subtle when differences do exist. And it's head stuff. Stuff you aren't going to be able to get on screen very easily. I expect to finish it up tomorrow if I continue to  neglect the real world  get as much reading time in.   Massage today! Lovely.   Got a Valentine gift in the mail the other day... Keith's mom, sent us a  frightening  really sweet gorilla in heart-covered boxers who dances to the tune of "Hooked on a Feeling" in a rather jerky way. We (Keli and I) meant to send it with Keith to his apartment when he went back this past Sunday night, but forgot. We think it would be a cheery thing for him to keep there and less likely to  give us nightmares  be accidently eaten by the dog or something. Thanks Alta! It's really  scary  cute! :)   Today's miles:  3.09  Total so far:  217.51  Still to go for goal:  282.49  Back in a bit!

       It's been a busy day for only being half over so far!  Had to be up early to get Kel to a morning play practice and Keith went along for the ride so we could stop for groceries. Well, one grocery stop isn't enough for us vegetarians, we hit both Econo Foods  and  Good Earth to try and find everything we wanted. Since Good Earth wasn't quite open yet, we had to go to Lighthouse for some coffee and kill a little time first. Then once we had all the food we needed, we had to swing into the bank and the post office, too. From there, we had enough time to head home and drop the food off, grab a little bite to eat, have a lovely chat on the phone with my brother Kent, who is  still  missing his flag, stolen right off the side of his house, pole and all (and who do you suppose is the first person he suspected??? the NOYVE, I tell ya!)... before I had to dash back to town and pick Kel up after play practice. What a morning!  But at least by then I was wide awake and ready for the run when I got back...   Today's miles:  3.2  Total so far:  246.64 (that halfway mark is so close I can practically  taste  it! -  tastes like chicken! hehehe)  Still to go for goal:  253.36  Tonight we are looking forward to a nice dinner in town (Barkers!) with Carol and Gary... Haven't seen them for a long time, so we're hoping to catch up on life.   And finally, Happy Birthday, Cory! 20 years... I still remember being off at school that day and calling back from payphones for updates to find out if you'd arrived yet! Hope your birthday's filled with joy. Much love from your much-shorter Aunt... :)

       Had a great time at lunch with Hutch today. As I told her, I wasn't going for the meal, but for the company. Good thing, too... Country Kitchen doesn't cater to the vegetarian... I'll keep that in mind from now on when I  am  interested in food... :) But the company was outstanding. As always. Thanks, Hutch. Got a few rows done on my latest scarf, too. And mmmm, that syrup!   Kel was back at school today. And she had a load of homework tonight. That's what happens with block schedule. You miss a day of school and it's like missing two. Well, she missed two days. You do the math. So I hauled her butt to play practice tonight and dropped her off. Watched her walk to the doors. Saw the other kids milling about in the commons and thought to myself, "That's odd. They aren't usually milling about in the commons. They are usually in the auditorium. I wonder if practice isn't really happening tonight. I should stick around and find out. Wish I'd forwarded the home phones to my cell in case she has to call right away to let me know." Then I proceeded to kick myself as I made the fifteen-minute drive all the way home.   When I got there, there was a message on the phone. But it wasn't her. It was Keith letting me know he was home from work. So I called him back on the second line. In the process of our conversation, the main line rang. I checked caller ID - it was the RF schools calling. Rats.   Keli:  Mom?   Me:  Yes...  Keli:  Play practice was cancelled.   Me:  And they couldn't let you know  before  you got there? Okay, I'm on my way. Which doors should I come to?   Keli:  The normal ones down below by the band room. Thanks.  Me:   Okay. I'll be there as soon as I can.   Then I went back to Keith's conversation and let him know I had to run back and get her. It was a good thing it was cancelled since she was doing homework until now - 11 pm. And actually, she isn't finished, she just finished with the computer. Now she is heading to bed with a book she has to read 50 pages in and a list of vocabulary words to study.   Finished watching a made-for-TV movie that mom taped earlier in the week while I ran tonight (Ted Danson and Mary Steenbergen). Anybody out there with HBO, there are a couple of things I'd like to see... send me an e-mail if you'd like to tape them for me! :)   Today's miles:  3.35  Total so far:  241.44  Still to go for goal:  258.56  We're having a slight lull in the weather at the moment. No rain and no snow. My writing date with Marge is on hold until we see what the weather is going to look like in the morning and if I'll have to get Keli to school late, etc.

       Well, Kel was home sick today, as I thought she might be when she went to bed last night. Took her in to the doc today for strep and mono tests. The quick results both came back negative. She had slept all morning before we went there, and then when we came back home she collapsed into bed again and slept nearly all afternoon.   Now she's trying to get some homework done because she'll have lots to catch up on after two days out of school. I suspect she'll try to return there tomorrow even though she cries out in pain everytime she stands up. She has a horrible headache with this bug.   Mostly I  walked  on Lurch today, but I put some miles behind me. The first of what I suspect will be several in honor of C. Hope you have good fortune with all of the treatment that lies ahead of you, C.    Today's miles:  3.8  Total so far:  238.09  Still to go for goal:  261.91  Looking forward to my lunch date tomorrow with Hutch! Yahoo!

       I'm sorry. No matter how hard we all try to eradicate it, it just keeps plodding away claiming more victims, grabbing more people to drag down and out. This makes me so angry.   And sad.   Found out over the weekend about Uncle By having prostate cancer. But I don't know how this goes, severity and all that. I do know Uncle Ken had it and it was very treatable. I think that's the norm, isn't it??? At least when caught early enough.  And found tonight about another of Kel's friends with a dad having cancer. Can't name names here because for now it isn't known in the community. They want it that way. But it's bad. Colon cancer. Kel and I had a cry together last night when we heard. Too many young people.   Keli returned from Colorado today. She had a good trip but she's exhausted and sick. I hope she's up for school tomorrow. I have my doubts. She went to play practice tonight. Not a wise move perhaps, but who can keep a teen down? She wanted to see her friends. She was missing them.   A quickie today... This one was for Uncle By...   Today's miles:  2.2  Total so far:  234.29  Still to go for goal:  265.71  Tomorrow, I run for C, the latest of those we know nabbed by cancer.

       My writing buddy Marge and I had a fascinating conversation tonight in Instant messenger... it went like this:   KinnicChick:  Marge!   KinnicChick:  I just had to see if you were online so that I could tell you thanks. Your e-mail today made me laugh so hard I nearly choked...    KinnicChick:  Actually it was the one yesterday... sorry.   KinnicChick:  Marge? Helloooooooooooooo? Are you there???   KinnicChick:  It's KERI!!!!!!!!!!   KinnicChick:  Sorry. I changed my name.   KinnicChick:   Imagine smiley face here...    KinnicChick:  zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz   KinnicChick:  Wish I knew how to send a sound...    KinnicChick:  Did you fall asleep at the keyboard?   KinnicChick:  YooooooooooooHoooooooooooooo...   KinnicChick:  Good Lord I can be annoying.    KinnicChick:  This isn't Becky, is it? Wow. Wouldn't THAT be embarrassing??? If so, HI BECKY!  Imagine smiley face here...    KinnicChick:  Geez Marge, turn the sound up on your laptop, will ya?    KinnicChick:  Maybe if I make the writing a little louder, then you'll be able to hear me?    KinnicChick:  I don't know... You seem to be online, but just not listening. Or maybe I'm just crazy. Maybe I'm not really typing. Maybe I'm just imagining this whole conversation! Oh yeah. That's probably it. I guess I'll just give it up and go do some crocheting. Or writing in my notebook. Or more steaming over the whole ... situation.   edited for privacy...    KinnicChick:  Too bad you are ignoring me. I thought you were my friend.    KinnicChick:   Imagine winking smiley face here...    KinnicChick:  Later baby...   KinnicChick:  Hope you actually find this conversation before you sign off for the night. It would be a pity if you don't.   There is a pause of about a half-hour then...   KinnicChick:  You're still online!??   KinnicChick:  Can you hear me yet?   KinnicChick:  Guess not. Well, I'm going to bed now. Talk to you later, Marge. Have a good night.  Fascinating stuff, huh? Educational, too.   Sorry I missed you, Marge! Maybe next time!

       We've been playing around with a book here the last few weeks. A book called  If... Questions for the Game of Life . It's got some great questions in it to contemplate if you want to do some deep thinking. And some great questions to think about for fun, too... The book became so popular after it was published that they wrote a whole series of books around similar themes. I thought I might throw a question out here once in a while for people to think about and if you want to, you can even throw your answer in my comments just for fun and read what other people thought.   I know, I know, there aren't that many people reading or commenting here these days, things have dwindled, but for the couple who are, it might be fun...   Here's your first question... We'll start with an easy one - If you were allowed to eat only one vegetable for the rest of your life, which one would it be? Please leave your answer in the comments section! Thanks.  Here's today's run...   Today's miles:  3.50  Total so far:  261.64  Still to go for goal:  238.36  I'm still receiving donations. My friends and family are the most generous and coolest people I know. Thank you so much. I can't wait to tally this all up after I make the 500 miles and send out the collection envelopes to those who pledged for the miles. I'm so psyched. I want to get the miles done fast so I can get it collected.   We're going to have a hot dog stand up at County Market and I hope that lots of people will come and eat lots of hot dogs that weekend. Hutch, I bet your boys can put away a lot of hot dogs! :) I'll let you know the time and dates!   Thanks for the support everyone. Keep the comments coming. They keep me going. They really do.

       Today's workout was for Gerry C... He's my girl KathyK's dad. Hope he's feeling comfortable. Haven't heard from her with an update for a bit, so I'm not sure how he's doing, but I thought I would devote one for him today. He's had a rough haul. Decided I wanted to get away from Lurch today, too. I've been reading Emerson lately and feeling the itch to get out into the wilderness, so I strapped on the snowshoes and headed into the frigid (melting) wasteland.   Here are Gerry's stats...   Today's miles:  3.25  Total so far:  258.14  Still to go for goal:  241.86  It was a beautiful time out there. Carol and Gary inspired the snowshoeing as much as Emerson did. They went out on their own snowshoes during Valentine's Weekend and reminded me of our own. It sounded like fun and it was. I headed around our own front five and rather than head into the woods and up the back hill (it looked a little daunting today, if you've seen our hill and the woods in which it is buried, you'd understand), I trekked out across the field in front of the Kinnickinnic River Land Trust land that adjoins our property and circled their property. It was fun tracking deer and turkeys through the snow.   It was fabulous just being out in nature again, too. I haven't been outside enough this winter. I came across a pile of acorn shells beside a deep hole in the snow. I found several deer lays. Now, looking out my office window I see a yellow-bellied sap sucker hopping up the tree just east of the house. There are little red squirrels scampering around the yard. And the brightest flamingos grazing in the snow you've ever seen! ;)  It isn't a bright and sunny day, in fact it is gloomy and overcast, but it is warm (about 36 or so right now) and the snow is melting and dripping from the roof. I might have to add an outdoor walk/run to my workout from now on at least once a week if the weather will permit through the end of winter. My soul needs it. Who's going to join me?

       Last night Kel and I put together a CD for one of her friends. It was the friend with a newly diagnosed cancer dad. She listens to a lot of music when she is hanging out in her room, and the majority of it is instrumental stuff. A lot of that tends to be very beautiful, but also not so uplifting... kind of down at times. We know this because she calls it sad music. So I asked Kel if she thought her friend might like some of the Linus & Lucy music of Vince Guaraldi that George Winston put out a few years back. After we burned it, we listened to it in the car on the way home from play practice last night to make sure it worked okay (I've had a little trouble burning CD's in the past on the old pc). We literally bounced in the car. It's great music - talk about uplifting and happy stuff. It just puts you in mind of the Peanuts gang dancing around and Snoopy dancing on his dog house, etc. I think (hope) she'll really like it. Kel is going to give it to her today. We want her to smile and think of us when she listens to it, and to just think happy thoughts sometimes and feel good.   She also chatted with Kel last night for a while on MSN. I'm glad she felt she could share the news with Kel when she hasn't shared with too many others... a kindred spirit, a kid who's already had a dad with cancer and been through the scary surgery stuff and all that. Kel invited her to join us for the Relay in June, too. I saw her at the band concert on Sunday and wanted to give her a huge hug, but again, not many know, and she doesn't even know that   I   know, so I couldn't. It's tough having these kids at that age where they feel they have to handle everything on their own and without any parental intervention.   So today I again ran for the nameless and faceless C. I know you're out there, C. And for all your family, wife and kids. Love and hugs to all of you. We are thinking and praying for each of you.    Today's miles:  4.65  Total so far:  254.89  Still to go for goal:   245.11  Back again soon. I'm off for my frango mint. Thank you Alta!!! :) They are so divine!

       We've been listening to a lot of CSN lately (Crosby, Stills and Nash). Before that it was the Triple CD set from Simon and Garfunkel but Kel loaned that out to Bren a couple of weeks ago (hoping to get him and Rusty to pick a song to sing at the Pops Concert) so we made a switch to this. This is good, too, though. Really good. Takes me back a few years. Keith, too. He was talking about his college years with Kel in the car last night while we were listening to it. She's starting to get that college bug. The colleges are starting to woo her. She has taken a pre-ACT exam and so the schools got her results and are sending her some info. Not too many of them yet, but a few of them. She wants to go someplace   warm!   I just hope she finds a great school that is a good fit.   Oh - here's some information from Alta for anyone interested... Sounds great to me, but I'm not a talented seamstress... Regarding the quilts I wrote about not long ago: "The program is called Project Linus and it is at numerous hospitals. They give homemade quilts to any children who are admitted with serious illness. The quilts vary in size from 30"x30" to twin size. I went for fabrics which were really soft, too. The 15-year-old girl found that there was no Project Linus at St. Mary's Hospital (in Grand Junction) here, so she started a group."  Stopped over and dropped off a newspaper for my brother, Kent tonight after I left Keli off at play practice... good to see you, bro! :)  Okay, so here's the details on today's run...   The miles:  3.6  Total so far:  250.24 (oh yeah, baby!!!)  Still to go for goal:   249.76 (look at that - I've gone further than I have left!!! Woohoo!)  Looks like it's time for a half-way there smooch! Yeah, baby!

       Took a day off and just spent the day enjoying my family. Had a morning of rest. We all needed it after late nights Friday and Saturday. Keli went to her first LAN party on Friday night and was out fairly late (no, didn't let her spend the whole night - no way, nuh uh, this is the hang out area of other people who seem to want to be near her that we don't want near her, so I was probably remiss in letting her go in the first place but what am I going to do, lock her up for the rest of the teen years?).   Saturday night we had dinner with Gary and Carol at Barkers - great food, not so good service, excellent company, laughs and good conversation. We had fun! And then we stopped back at the folks' where Keli had spent the evening watching movies and picked her up after watching the end of Nemo with them...  But again, Sunday we rested in the morning and enjoyed some fresh muffins, lemon poppyseed and blueberry - yummy. Keli joined us after noon and watched a movie. She did a little homework, too. Keith had some time in the hot tub. I did a little writing. It was one of those nice laid back kind of days with a fire in the fireplace.   But running? Nope.   At 5 pm, we headed to the high school where Keli and her many cohorts had a band concert. Dad joined us for that. Mom was feeling under the weather (hope you're feeling better now, Mom!). It was a great concert. Afterward it was off to the cities to take Keith back to his apartment and we stopped for some dinner along the way, just the three of us. It was a great family night. We don't get a lot of time together these days, so when we do, the time is precious.

      Kathy C asked me to run for her friend Todd today who just learned that he has prostate cancer. So today I'm running for him.   I haven't made it down to Lurch yet, but Keith is making his pot of coffee to take to the hot tub now, so I thought I would get ready and pick out my movie and head that direction now. So far this morning has been a casual sit around with Keith and Kel, chatting and relaxing about life. After our late night, Kel was up really early finishing her weekend homework and watching a movie before anyone else was awake. I guess that all-day sleep yesterday caught her up on sleep for a while.   Keli's cousin Bobby has just been diagnosed with a rare auto-immunological blood disorder called ITP. From the little bit of research I've done about this on the web, what I've seen so far, is that this frequently hits kids between the ages of 2-4 years and "in most cases, their ITP goes away within the first two months, tends not to lead to other problems, and does not return." It is a nasty beast, though. With ITP, "the platelets are the target.  They are marked as foreign by the immune system and eliminated in the spleen and sometimes, the liver." Bobby's blood count is at 5000 (normal is 150,000). He's basically living in a bubble right now. Most of the family is. They had to pull the girls out of school so they wouldn't bring any germs home with them and the daycare that Mom ran at home had to be shut down for the time being. Dad is the only one leaving the house to go to work and he has to shower and change as soon as he gets home before he can see the little guy. I'm going to be running for Bobby tomorrow.   On Monday I'll be running for Keith's friend Gail M.   Okay. Keith's coffee is ready. I'm off... Back in a bit for an update.  Running with more old Cheers episodes (and wishing I had "Kelly's Birthday Party" or whatever it was called so Keli can see it and hear Woody's ode to Kelly) today, here are the stats racked up for Todd...   Today's miles:  3.58  Total so far:  287.63  Still to go for goal:  212.37  So tomorrow is for Bobby. We're all praying for his speedy recovery and no further drop in his counts or illnesses.

      Wow did we get the snow during the night and into the morning! Snow day! I got Kel up and sent her off to get ready for school. About fifteen minutes later I remembered that we were supposed to get a bad storm during the night so I turned on the outside lights and pulled the shades. Blast. Snow everywhere, sticking to the trees and still dumping! Wind whipping it around making visibility very limited. I jumped out of bed and ran for the office. I had to boot up the computer because I hadn't gone through my usual pre-storm morning preparations last night and then ran for the radio in the kitchen to see if I could catch a forecast or some school closings. I caught the tail end of them on the local station and he named the old home town, but not the local district.  BUT , if the old home town was closed, that's a pretty sure sign the local schools are closed, they always follow suit. I ran back to the computer and brought up a tv station's website from the twin cities. Then I hit their school closings button and gasped at the long list of schools that appeared... I scrolled down the alphabetic list and sure enough - there we were. Now to inform my sure-to-be-ticked and already-ready-for-school daughter...   Me (from the hallway outside her bathroom):  Um, Kel?  Her:  Holy Crap you scared me!  Me:  Sorry...   Her:  What?!  Me:  You can put your pj's on and get back in bed... no school today... bad snow storm.  Her (coming out of her bathroom completely dressed with wet hair, grinning):  Snow storm??? What's with this weather?  Me:  You get to go back to bed!  Her:  I'm ready already.  Me:  You get to go back to bed!  Her (still grinning, but not necessarily in a good way):  Snow storm?  Me:  You get to go back to bed!  Her:  Okay Mom, I get it...   She did manage to go back to bed, and back to sleep. She slept until 2:30.  edited to add: I stand corrected... She informs me that she actually slept until 3 pm...  Not bad, eh? I think she's got that whole teenage thing down.   Tonight she went to the local Relay for Life and worked at Zany Janie's Henna booth, applying henna tatoo's to people for a free will donation for a couple of hours. She did a great job. I'm so proud of her because she was pretty nervous about it. She worked by herself for much of the time and many of her clients were college students and adults - most of them total strangers to her. She handled it very professionally. I know because I got to watch her from a distance for much of it while I waited for her. It was her first time working for Jane and she was told that she'd be called back to do other shows and festivals for pay if she is interested. She said she had a great time and would love to do it again. It's right up her alley being the artist that she is.   Speaking of the local Relay, Keith and I were there watching it for a while. We saw it as very well organized. It had a lot of energy, brought in part by the addition of all of the University students, I think. It was nice being indoors and having no bugs or weather to deal with (which can be part of the charm of the one we do in the summer, I think). We were thinking we might have to join a team down here sometime and do them both.   Today I ran watching old reruns of Cheers that Kel found while going through old unmarked tapes in the drawer of our dresser...    I ran for Sarah - a relative of Keith's who lives in Utah.    Today's miles:  3.51  Total so far:  284.05  Still to go for goal:  215.95  See you tomorrow! Only have to average 3.19 miles a day now to make 300 miles on Jacob's birthday!!! (Do I get to count the tenth as a running day Hutch?) Think I can do it Jacob?   Addendum: I had to pick up Kel at her friend Lauren's tonight a couple of hours after her stint at the Relay but instead of coming home, we decided to go  back  to the Relay for a little while. The reason for this was that Kel has a few friends in a band that was playing there at various times during the night including the luminary ceremony and that was going on about that time. I had purchased a luminary in honor of Keith when I was there earlier and thought it would be kind of nice to be there to see part of their ceremony, too. So, I asked Kel if she wanted to go back and she thought that sounded fun. She also thought it would be good to check on Jane and see if she needed any more help.   Well, we got there and Jane was swamped. So Kel pitched right in and got back to work. And I headed into the gym to have a look around. I am so impressed with this Relay. I watched the end of the luminary ceremony and got to hear Keith's name called off, Kel did too, actually because at that point, Jane had no extra bottles to work with. I got to watch a Survivor game played between the teams that was a hoot. They had a great time playing it and those of us watching had a lot of fun just watching! I watched a limbo competition that was a lot of fun. Still to come were hula competitions, a tug of war, a timed team tent set up, campfire stories and songs, partner skills involving fishing waders, more team games, a workout with a YMCA fitness instructor and a yoga session. They'd already had the Dude Looks Like a Lady contest, some dancers from a local dance studio and two live bands.   I discovered another positive about their indoor setting - the sound system is incredible. You can hear everything that they say and all of the music really well. It's a really hard call which is better... but they were definitely really well organized, I'll say that for them. And again, all of those university students give it a different kind of energy.   Kel thanked me as we were leaving (before she fell on her butt on the hard sidewalk which had gotten very slippery from the still falling snow) for going back because she'd had a really good time helping out with the henna again and seeing her friends some more. They made a total (I think) of $250 in donations which means they did 50 designs in the 6 hours they were working. Not bad!

      Hola! Hope everyone is having a good Thursday. I'm starting the day early because Mum and I are heading West to the cities for a yarn shopping experience. She's in the knitting mood and I'm in search of baby yarn for a baby blanket. I have a cousin having a wee-one and there is a shower coming up. Of course, now that mom is doing some knitting, she has decided to do the baby blanket thing and took my job away from me, but I might just have to double the job and make one as well... We'll see. I don't have much time as the shower is at the end of the month. Of course, I haven't seen an invitation, either, so... perhaps I shouldn't worry about it, eh? :) Just kidding.  Anyway, here are the stats for today as I finished watching  urlLink  Titanic  .    Today's miles:  3.76  Total so far:  280.54  Still to go for goal:  219.46  Man that last hour is a painful one. Although I did manage to watch nearly the whole thing without sobbing this time. Third time's the charm I guess. First time I saw it was in the theater and I cried a bit but watched it mostly in shock. Second time I saw it I cried pretty much from beginning to end. This time I just cried a bit here and there. Could have been that I was chugging along on the treadmill. Who knows?  Okay, it's Thursday, so it sounds like a good day for that question from the book again... I told you this week's would be a little more thought provoking than vegetables, but don't let that stop you from answering. I had great response last week and would love to see that continue this week. Here goes (I admit this one is a little out there, but interesting):  If you had to be someone's body part, what would you be, and on whose body?  I thought this was a near impossible question. I asked it of a guy whose blog I read when I was sending out interview games for people and I thought his answer was really interesting (I don't think he reads here, but if he does, HI DEW!) Anyway, he said he would choose Lee Harvey Oswald's eyes because then he could have seen what really happened the day Kennedy was shot. Wasn't that a cool answer? I thought it was great. But then I thought about the fact that he also soon after saw Jack Ruby coming after him, too. That was a little unfortunate.   Now I have to go shower (pee u) and head to the cities and think about my own answer because I've never come up with a satisfactory one myself... Somebody else will have to kick the comments off today. Hope you have fun with this one and it generates conversation!   Have a great Thursday and I'll see you later! Thanks for being my cheerleaders gang! I lurrrrvs you all!   I've made a few changes around here to try and make things a little more readable with or without the bifocals... Hope it helps. Let me know what you think.   Totally looking forward to seeing the new S&H movie which came out today. It's getting a lot of hype for Owen and Ben. I'm excited to get together with Hutch and see it. In the meantime, here's a great picture of the originals, which really can't be replaced, no matter how they try...

      Thanks for the comments about the new layout. I'll look into changing the comments for those of you who had difficulty reading the blue on black. That isn't tough to do at all. I like the colors but maybe I can find a larger font that would make it easier.   Well, it looks like winter has returned around here. We are getting dumped on with snow showers today. It wasn't snowing when I headed down to the basement for my run but things sure changed by the time I emerged... What a difference an hour makes. Yuck.   I enjoyed watching more of  urlLink  Titanic  , though. Rose just helped Jack escape his handcuff situation...   I have such a strange dog. Haven't written about him for a while. Yesterday after I crawled out of the cave I'd hidden in all morning with my migraine, I was in the bathroom washing up and getting ready to head to town to get Kel from school when I noticed in the mirror that one of my earrings was missing. So I wandered around shaking out the shirts I'd worn over the past couple of days and nothing fell out of them. Next I headed to the bed and picked up my pillow and was fortunate enough to find it lying there in the bed. This meant of course, that the back was missing, too. So I started looking around on the floor and saw something shiny that looked like a little crumpled piece of tinfoil. I bent over and picked it up figuring it to be a remnant of a Hershey kiss from Keli's Valentines that Bear had gotten hold of or something. Turns out it was the earring back.   Guess it was crumpled into that shape because it was the hard thing I heard my weird dog chewing upon yesterday morning while I was lying in bed nursing my migraine. I heard him chewing on something while he was lying on the floor beside the bed. I asked him what on earth he had gotten hold of now. He ignored me. Of course. I didn't bother getting up to investigate because I was in pain and he eventually dropped whatever it was and left it alone and I forgot about it. Now why on earth would a dog chew on the silver back of an earring? Guess he has a sterling deficiency or something. Or it looked like something interesting to chew on. Or he wanted to get my attention. Or he's just weird.    Today's miles:  4.16  Total so far:  276.78  Still to go for goal:  223.22  Closing in on that goal for the tenth even faster than I had hoped! Hurrah! That means the March goal is that much more reachable, too. Yippee!   Better hit the shower so I can go get the kid. She wants me to force her to go to bed at 6 tonight. Yeah. That outta be fun. She loves it so much when I try and force her to do anything. Movie night with the girls has been cancelled again. I miss it and we've only done it once!

      Thought I needed to jazz things up around here a little bit. Found this pretty skin with the lovely runner and decided it was the look for me.   The migraine is still with me. I'm taking a poll. Any other migraine sufferers that might read along with me and live up in this area, I'd love to hear if you might be suffering along with me at this time... Weather related stuff seems to be hitting people right now. Hutch, how is Jacob this week? I'm hearing of lots of people who are being hit with migraines in the past two days. Just curious.   Okay. Heading down to lurch along on Lurch now. This one is for K (you can refuse it, but I'll still give it to you! hehehe). Hope your medical tests gave you answers and that they also gave you help and comfort, Dear. Hugs.  I'll be back to post my miles.  Okay, I ran watching the first hour of  urlLink  Titanic   tonight. Haven't seen that for a looooong time.    Today's miles:  4.26   yeeehaaaw!   Total so far:  272.62  Still to go for goal:  227.38  Headache faded into the background during the run. I actually thought it was gone for good. Seems to be roaring now, though. Perhaps the shower will help. Have a good night. It  WILL  be gone tomorrow. Tomorrow is movie day with the girls...

       First migraine in months and it happens on the first of March and on a Monday and on the first day of Hutch's challenge which I read totally wrong the first three times I read it. I read it correctly tonight when I came in to post my day's run results and look things over and figure things out...   Today's miles:  3.50  Total so far:  268.36  Still to go for goal:  231.64  So now that I really know what Hutch's challenge (from yesterday's comments) is, I can recalculate things and figure out what I have left to accomplish if I want to try and reach that goal... (whipping out handy-dandy calculator) 31.64 miles to go by March 10 and 9 days left to do it... Just over 3.5 miles per day with no days off! I can do that! Jacob - for you? On your golden birthday? No Problem!  Busy day today after I finally dragged my painful head out of it's dark cave of a bedroom (thank goodness for room-darkening shades) when I had to go get Kel at school. Her new glasses were ready to be picked up so we headed for the vision place for those, then we headed to the folks' to show off the new specs. As soon as I can get her to stand still I'll get a photo and post it.   From there we grabbed some junk food and headed off to the high school where Kel had play practice and I got to stand in lines for 90 minutes and talk to teachers at Parent/Teacher conferences. This was actually a delightful time because the teachers love my daughter and I have fun chatting with other parents I don't get to see often. Then I sat around in the car for another 90 minutes finishing a book I was reading and doing some writing until play practice was over and we headed home.   Then it was on the treadmill to get started on the March mileage challenge. Tonight's viewing pleasure was Gilmore Girls and One Tree Hill from last week - thanks Mom!  Hutch, after seeing previews again a few days ago for the new Starsky and Hutch movie, I am SO looking forward to hitting that movie with you... Looks to me like Ben Stiller has totally NAILED the Starsky character. Time will tell how Hutch is. :) I can't wait! Kel wants to go with us. Don't know how we're going to do that.   Okay. Posting this so I can help her finish up some last minute homework stuff before bed. G'night all. Determined that tomorrow this headache anomaly will be gone!

       Don't you just feel like you should do something extra special today since you are given this gift of an extra day this year? This is the first leap day in eight years, too! An extra special leap day. To me it feels like I should be doing something profound. But as yet, I haven't figured out what that is. So all I've done so far is run.  And because I'm so enamored with  urlLink Brad Pitt , I ran looking at his larger-than-life form projected on the wall in front of me watching  urlLink  Seven Years in Tibet  . Again. Because I already watched  urlLink  Meet Joe Black   earlier this week. Again. :)  WOW! Did my question of Thursday ever take off! Who'd a thunk? I'll pull another one later this week for you all to ponder. But it won't be vegetables... you'll have to dig deeper than potatoes for the next one! But thanks for your responses, that was fun! We set a record here for number of comments!  I'm blue that I didn't get another hundred miles in for the month of February as I've done so far in each month, but I won't despair... I still have plenty of time to reach my goals (getting out the calculator and calendar and frantically figuring things out...). If I ran 3.5 miles six days a week (I know that is pushing what I've been doing lately, but let's face it - I've been slacking this month and that's why I haven't gotten my 100 miles in this month), I could be done by mid May, which is my goal so I'm comfortably there before June 1 and able to collect my funds before the relay in mid-June.   Today's miles:  3.22  Total so far:  264.86  Still to go for goal:  235.14  Actually, I'll be a few miles short, but I can put in a couple of long runs and make it as I've done along the way. I've done some runs over four miles. I mean, I  know  I can do this. I just have to get my butt moving again! I am now, but I was slacking for a bit there because I'd gotten ahead of myself.   See you all back here tomorrow. No more slacking and days and days off (heck I just took another two in a row!). It's back to work for this kid.   Also, for all of my virtual friends who have been interested in possibly contributing to the run, I'm looking into a paypal account. I've actually created the thing and am in the process of hooking it up to a bank account this week, so I can have online contributions if anyone wants to do that. I'm stepping further into the 21st century every day! Thanks for the nudge!

      Well, the hottub was divine. 'cept for the part where the ice pellets started raining down really hard for a few minutes and were hitting us on the head!   And the part where my book fell in the water. :) Annie Dillard's  The Writing Life , which is one of my favorites. It will be okay, though. Just a little wrinkly and crinkly...   While I was cooling from the hottub and getting ready to run, we had a big old roll of thunder! That was cool!   I actually didn't feel any pain in my leg at all while I was running. The only thing that hurt was after I finished stretching. I have to remember to leave out one of the stretches. It's one we were told not to do back in high school cross country anyway... Back when I was considering running and joined them for one practice... back when I realized that no way could I run distance...   So here are today's numbers...   Today's miles:  3.5  Total so far:  309.94  Still to go for goal:  190.06  I think I'll ice my leg now before I shower. Then it will be time to run after Kel again. I think we might head over to Borders after that. There is a very interesting new book out that I'd like to pick up to share with Keith. I heard about it on Minnesota Public Radio this week. It's called  I Had Brain Surgery, What's Your Excuse?: An Illustrated Memoir.  It sounds humorous and we're all about humor with this topic.  Hope you all are having a great weekend.

       The weather and OUCH!!!   It's a lovely day here in God's country. We woke up to a normal chilly Saturday in March but just as we were getting ready to head out the door to run Kel to play practice we heard the distinct sounds of ice hitting the windows. Looking out on the steps of the patio, we could see the stuff falling and bouncing off the paving stones. Ish. It was a fun drive. We had a lot of stops to make in town... high school, post office, grocery store, bank, Perkins for a vegie omelette :) and the roads weren't horrible, but the ice did pile up to about three quarter inch on the roads in some places before it stopped falling.  The run will be painful today I believe. There wasn't time for one yesterday and frankly, my leg injury was too new...   Yep. Leg injury. Unfortunately I didn't get it in some cool way like skiing down the slopes or out running around on the snow shoes or ice skating or climbing a mountain or snow boarding...   I wish I  could  report something like that.   No. I incurred my injury of all things...   Vacuuming.   Yep.   And I thought I was in shape.   I squatted down to vacuum beneath the desk and was lifting up a basket full of paperwork to vacuum beneath it and the squat was just too much I guess. Because when I stood back up, I knew something was wrong with the back of my knee that hadn't been wrong with it before. It had been bent too much or something. So I hobbled around the rest of the day finishing things up and running around. I noticed it the most while driving because it is my right knee and I use it driving all of the time - depressing the gas and the brake and moving the foot back and forth between the two.  I wondered how it would feel today when I got out of bed...   Not bad. But driving was a little painful again. And after driving when I got home and sat down to do some writing and was paying attention and moving my legs around a little I noticed something... the pain wasn't just in the knee anymore. It was radiating down the outside of the calf toward the ankle...  So the run will be interesting.   I've decided that since I'm still pretty full from my garden omelette, I'm going to go have a soak in the hottub first. Loosen up the leg for a while. Then I'll cool off for a little bit, drink a little water to rehydrate, and head to the tread. We'll see. It might be a short run. Afterwards, I'll soak it again. Maybe some epsom salts... then I'll report back here with the mileage.   Wish me luck. Oh silent ones. :) I know you're reading. I'm checking my stats. But darn it, get busy commenting! I misses your words of wisdom! I feel like I'm talking to myself here (with a couple of exceptions of course! thanks!!!)...   Listening to: My new Meet Joe Black soundtrack... I lurrrrrrrvs this music!!!

      Heard from Bobby's Mom today. She said his platelet count was only up to 7000 this week. His sisters are back at school and doing the immediate shower and clothing change when they come in the door since their being out had no real positive effect on his count.  He is headed to Childrens' on Tuesday next to see a Hematologist and one of their Pediatricians for a full blood work up and check-up. Put him on your good-thoughts and prayer lists please... I'd like to see him speedily recover from this rare and odd disease, ITP.    Listening to: Perfect World by the Indigo Girls

       Conversations in space...   AOL's Buddy List told me that my buddy Marge was online again tonight. I was going to check in with her to discuss our plans for writing in the morning...    KinnicChick:  is this the ghost of DivaMarge past???  Marge:   KinnicChick:  hello? hellooooo???? elloooo??? ellooo??? llooo?? ooo??  Marge:   KinnicChick:  Marge???? Marge??? arge??? arge?? arge? rge? ge?  Marge:   KinnicChick:  Is anybody in here? anybody   here? body r?  Marge:   KinnicChick:  Damn.   She called and talked with the good people at AOL the other day to find out why it appears that she is online when she isn't really. And why I can have these conversations with her when she isn't really there.   I'm just glad they didn't ask her if she talks back to me... :) No Keith. She doesn't. hehehe...   Okay - enough of this foolishness... I must run. Back later to update with the mileage.

       A New Baby in My Blog Family...   Hutch reports this week that   It's a Girl!!!   Isn't she sweet? And now her name will be forever emblazoned in my brain because...        Her name is Rio and she dances on the sand...  Just like that river twisting through a dusty land...  Okay, enough with the old eighties music.

       About that body part thing...   Remember my question from a week ago where I asked:    If you had to be someone's body part, what would you be, and on whose body?   I got some great answers during the next couple of days, but just this week, I've heard a few more, and since they were later in coming, and some of them didn't get put in the comments, and some of them were so late, that regular readers might not even see them unless they were really searching for them, I thought I would repost them here, because they were so great...  Hutch's little guys had some really cool answers... The birthday boy came up with these: "Jacob had a hard time narrowing it down, but the first two that he mentioned were Neil Armstrong's feet, and Thomas Jefferson's hand."  And her younger son had this idea... Ben wanted to be the brain of Mr. Andrews, the engineer who designed Titanic, so that he could do a better job so it wouldn't sink.   And finally, my dad added this... "I would be the part of the brain that Keith is having the problems with so he and the rest of his family could have a little better quality of life."   For those of you who are newer readers around here, my husband had a brain tumor removed two and a half years ago, along with a sizeable bit of brain matter and still has focal seizures in part of his brain. He has a pretty normal life for having this occur. But he did lose his driving ability. As a result, with his current job in computer consulting and most of the work being on the opposite side of the twin cities (about an hour from where we live), he now has an apartment near work where he can walk every morning and Kel and I only get to see him on the weekends when we go pick him up and bring him home to spend that time with us.   Frankly, that sucks. Mostly for him. And for Kel, who gets to be mostly fatherless again. But we still have him. And we're really ecstatic of that. And the brain tumor is mostly gone and unless it starts growing again, we can relax about it.   So Dad? You had an incredible answer to my question. You brought me to tears. Thanks. Now I can do the same to you by being a totally healthy, young and vibrant heart beating in your chest so that you never have another heart attack. But it isn't the same. Because you thought of it first. But that's what I'm going to choose. But you beat me to it. Damn it. Love you Dad.

       Moving into the future...   I've finally gotten the test with paypal accomplished, so I hooked the button up and put it online. Dad and I performed one more minor little test this morning and all systems should be go now. Let's give it a shot! Anybody who wants to donate to my run to nowhere from out there in cyberspace now can. Thanks again for those of you who have been inquiring. Hugs to you!  If anybody does try it and it gives them any trouble, please let me know. Thanks.

       It's that time again!   Time to order our tickets to the  urlLink david m bailey  concert! He'll be here in May people and I'm planning on ordering soon, so if you want to join us, I want you to let me know so that I can order a ticket for you, too! Please give it some consideration. We always have a great time at his show and we love to share his music with more people every year. It's appropriate for all audiences. He travels to a lot of places and I know that many of you who are following my running progress would really like his stuff. Please check out his website and his story. He's our brain tumor hero...          The proceeds from the concert go to a great cause - their local Relay for Life and helping pay David's expenses getting him over here as this is what he does for a living... but that's it. We were able to bring Delores S to his show last year just a couple of months before cancer finally claimed her and she really loved his message. He's special people. I hope you will join us.

      It is so blustery out there I just can't believe it. The tops of the trees are really whipping around for not having any leaves on them to be caught by the wind. They're talking about a 40 degree day so that should melt some snow. They're also talking about rain changing to snow for tonight, so the warmth won't help clear winter away much should that occur.  The varying temps and sporadic snows have made for some interesting poses in the pink flamingos of late. They look like they are doing a coordinated and synchronized dance out in the woods. It amazes me how some are leaning left and some are leaning right but all look as if they are doing exactly the right thing because they look so coordinated and I feel I should put some music on a speaker and dangle it out the window for them. But I suspect they hear their own music already...  It's time for my favorite candy to be in the stores again... Cadbury mini eggs. Good thing my favorite candy is only available for a small window during the year. I'm blessed that way. Unfortunately, it now comes in a BIG BAG like everything else that America manufactures. How's that for this week's question of the week, a day early... a bit of a no-brainer again since last week's had people thinking too hard. We can alternate like that...    What is/was your favorite candy?   And don't forget to think back to all those candies that are no longer available that you use to race to the corner store with your nickles as a kid on allowance day (back then I was partial to candy cigarettes - how politically incorrect those have become - and candy lipsticks with that red dye that caused cancer).   Okay. I'm going to run around and clean house for a while now because it needs it. Then I'm going to hop on Lurch if there is still time before getting Kel from school (told you it needed it). Then we might be off to a movie. I'd like to accomplish some writing time and a cup of tea or two at some point, too. Hope you all have a great day.   Run results...   Today's run:  3.06  Total so far: 303.18  Still to go for goal:  196.82  Didn't get to update last night with the miles because I fell asleep before Kel got off the computer, so there you go!

      Well, I had to get on Lurch early today. I have a lot to do. First there is the 9:30 appointment with the local glass service company to fix the target in my windshield that got hit with a rock yesterday on the way into town. That's the second one in about six months. I hate that.   Then the car is well past due for an oil change. Oh joy. A favorite activity. But right next door to the glass place, so a convenient stop.   From there I'm off to the bank to set up a little savings account so I can get the Paypal button on here for anyone who might want to donate online because there are so many unbelievably generous people in the world. It cracks my heart open everytime I hear from one of you. I'll get to deposit a few new checks that have come in from other donators. Thank you!  Figured I might as well do Kimberly's run bright and early before all of that. I discovered something. When I run early? I run even slower than I normally do! It was a  loooooong  run!   Tonight Kel has play practice. At that time I'll have even more errands to run, this time in the old home town.    Today's miles:  5.09  Total so far:  300.12 (I made it for you Jacob!)  Still to go for goal:  199.88 (WOW! That feels so attainable!)  If I get permission from Hutch, I'll have to put up a cute puppy picture here at some point soon. Her family has a new addition to their family. Did I really calculate the miles correctly that I made the challenge a day early? Seems hard to believe...  I'll probably be back later today.

      I've got the bank account hooked up to the Paypal account, but for now, the button will have to be on hold because there is a test that has to be done between Paypal and I... as soon as that has been accomplished, it will go on the blog here for all of you wonderfully anxious people who want to make donations!   I lurrrrrve you all!

      Today I ran for Keith's friend Gail who was recently diagnosed with cancer.   And would you believe it is snowing here again? A   lot.   I didn't even know we were  expecting  snow today. It is beautiful, but I'm really ready for winter to be over with. They are talking about high 40's by Friday, which means a quick melt again, but we really have enough mud and water going on around here already. Things are flooding quite enough in these parts with the creek just up the road. We don't really need anything else right now. Oh well. Can't control the weather, I guess.   Had a nice MSN chat today with methinks. It is so cool to chat live with someone on the other side of the world! I love modern technology. And to be looking at her beautiful photograph while I chat with her is cool, too - she looks in the photo like she is cheering me on while I'm running as she is doing a cartwheel in it! :-) Speaking of cartwheels, Hutch, have you told the boys about the hundreds of yards of cartwheels we did up at the football field that time? I'm thinking of a Relay fundraiser involving cartwheels now... Not involving me, but my daughter and nieces or something...   If you ever come on the blog and can't see the photo at the top or the chickens or something, as is the case right now in fact, it means the website where I store those things is down and I can't do anything about that but wait for it to come back online. Sorry!  Here are the stats for Gail's run...   Today's miles:  4.16  Total so far:  295.3  Still to go for goal:  204.7  Since I found out at the Relay on Friday night that Kimberly, who I ran for earlier, had gotten bad news and was no longer currently in the lead in her race against the beast, tomorrow I will be running in honor of her again. It makes me so sad to hear this. She had breast cancer and had been through surgery and the treatments about a year and a half ago and I did not get any details about what her news was, but she has a daughter Kel's age and another daughter in middle school. I saw Kim and her husband and both girls at the opening ceremony on Friday night before I heard about it and they all looked really positive about things, so I'm just going to keep on praying and being positive with them.   We also heard from Keith's mom over the weekend that Sarah had passed away. You'll see that I added a list of the names of the people I'm running for to the right of the blog entries. Those are just the names of the people fighting cancer, or who have already done their fighting and who are now in remission. The names at the bottom are those who have lost the fight since I've run for them. Let's hope there aren't too many more falling into that category. I'm always looking for new names to run for - either those celebrating being finished because they've beat it or those fighting, so please let me know if there are people you know of who I can hold in front of me as inspiration. It helps me get on that treadmill each day.    If you know of anyone that I've run for who I've excluded from the list, please knock on my noggin and let me know because I'm not always the greatest record keeper and I don't want to forget anyone on my t-shirt!   When will it all end? Keep on racing for the cure with me!

      It was a late night run for Bobby. There was much to do today, so Lurch was last on the list after a lot of other stuff. And now I'm off to bed but not before I update here.  Hope you all had a great weekend. I think I can speak for all of us in saying we all did.   And it was exciting for me to hear that  urlLink KS95's Radiothon for Kids  made a   HUGE   sum of money for Gillette Children's Hospital and Children's Cancer Research Fund... Last I heard they'd made over $1,280,000 so far and were still taking calls even though the actual Radiothon was over and the auction of items was still going on. In looking at their website, it still is as I post this. I listened to a lot of it as I drove around this weekend and they are doing a lot of good stuff for these kids. Having a healthy teen myself always makes me feel pretty humble to listen to the stories and makes me want to help in some way. I'm glad to be climbing on Lurch for this Relay again tomorrow.    Thanks to all of my special friends and family for your donations and for the cheerleading. You keep me moving toward my goal!     Today's miles:  3.51  Total so far:  291.14  Still to go for goal:  208.86  Back tomorrow!

      The concert was awesome. I just find it so hard to believe that a group that good playing here in a college town, can't fill the auditorium. They deserved to.   A couple of local high school groups opened for them. They both did a fabulous job. WAY TO GO!!!  The concert wrapped up at about 9 and we stood in line for about a half hour with Kel's poster so she could have it autographed . We were home shortly after 10 by the time we stopped for gas. A long night. But fun...   I see by their schedule that they are coming to your neck of the woods later in the season, Hutch. It would be a fun night for you and the Hutch guys. I think you'd all really enjoy it. I could point you to some places to hear snippets of their stuff if you are interested. Or perhaps you already know about them. I bet they are possibly doing a fundraiser for a church or school in your area? Their concert was benefitting St. B's school music program here. FYI...

       This month's goal...   Well, obviously I won't get to 400 by the end of the month, but I did crunch the numbers for 375. If I ran every day and averaged 4.3 miles, I  could  make 475. That'd be difficult, but doable. And spring is here. So it's possible, if not probable that I could be out on the road for part of it. And when I get out on the road, it's inevitable that I will do more miles per run because just getting around the block is over four miles. Depending on which block I choose. One of them is over five miles, I think. I usually go around the block once I start. It just doesn't make sense to go part way around and then turn and come back the way I started.   So I guess that's my new goal for the month. 375 by April 1. And I never could have shot for that without Hutch's challenge at the start of March. So thanks, Hutch! I appreciate your push. And your friendship. How are the miles racking up on the new treadmill in  your  house?

       I'm back...    Today's miles:  3.75  Total so far:  332  Still to go for goal:  168  How is it that the weekends can be so busy? I thought the weekends were supposed to be relaxing and calm? Are anybody's weekends actually like that?   I didn't post a question for the week on Thursday last, so I'm going to do that today... I'm not going to try for thought-provoking or simple. I'm just going to open the book and stick my finger on one. Here you go. Hope to hear from you all...  If you had to name the dumbest purchase you've ever made, which would it be?  Going off to shower and think about this one for a while and discuss with Keith. . I'll be back to comment in a bit.

       Weekend Wanderings...   I've already been out and about this morning dropping Kel off at play practice (only a week left of this) followed by a stop at the grocery store where I picked up a few things, and a stop at the coffee shop where I got Keith's transfusion (two tall triple shot mochas) and breathed in the wonderful aromas going on there and just absorbed the wonderful atmosphere while standing in line in one of my favorite places in town.   One of the part-time barristas was standing in line herself chatting it up with various townsfolk. There is a photo of her in this week's paper and an article about how tired she was of the mess along Main Street and how she wants to see it cleaned up so she is organizing volunteers to do just that. She's taking donations of cleaning supplies and a cart for storing and hauling them. She's organizing the times for getting people on the street to do the pickup and cleaning. It was a great article and just the sort of thing I love about this town. Go Nell!  Tonight we see Tonic Sol-fa in concert. Looking forward to that!   Keith is heading out to the hot tub now, so I'm off to utilize Lurch and make up for lost time from yesterday. My genius daughter helped me figure out how to get some great sound with the DVD's so now I can really hear what I'm watching. That's cool.  Today I'm dedicating my run to Dan K. I just heard this morning from our friend Alva (who is also a Brain Trust member - Hi Alva!), that Dan (he is Alva's dear Andy's brother) has stomach cancer. So this run is for you, Danny!

       Today's Miles:  3.5  Total so far:  328.25  Still to go for goal:  171.75  News - Learned today that the High School Band Awards night is the same night as the David Bailey concert. Don't know exactly what this means - because I really don't think Keli will have any awards coming this year as she hasn't done any solo/ensemble competitions this year or tryouts for anything. She intentionally took this year easy, so we may not be attending awards night... we'll keep you posted. I can still arrange tickets for the concert so let me know if you want information.

       Thursday's Child Works Hard for a Living...   Helped Kel clean Joe's vase today... it needed it! We do this as a tag-team effort. First she took out the plant and rinsed the roots good to get the debris and stuff off them and set it aside. Next I removed the sea shell from the bottom of the vase and she cleaned it while I scooped some of the water from the vase. Joe swam around frantically watching and freaking out, trying to avoid the scoop. (For those of you new to the Joe saga, Joe is a betta fish that we "won" at a silent auction at Kel's school last November...) When she was done scrubbing the shell, it was time to dump the vase and transfer Joe to the temporary pitcher of water while she cleaned his home and decorative marbles... this is always the tense/terrifying/tricky part. And Joe doesn't like it much either!  Keli held the collander in her left hand over the sink, the fish net in her right hand to catch Joe when he comes sliding out of the vase in her right and I picked up the vase and began to pour into the collander... He's impossible to just scoop out with the fish net - he's too quick and too big. This technique has been perfected over the months we've been doing it, but it happens differently every single time we do it. That's what makes it terrifying - the unpredictability of it all.   This time, everything happened in slow motion. We didn't think Joe was  ever  going to come out of the vase. And basically, he didn't. Pretty soon, nearly all of the water was gone and the marbles were creeping closer and closer to the edge. I kept freaking because I thought his lacy tail was going to get caught in them. My freaking was making Kel freak. And what did that do? It made Bear, who was standing down at our feet, bark up at us. He thought this was all quite a cool game. And gee, not to mention, wasn't it his dinner time? And what was that wiggly blue thing we were talking to? It looked like something fun to play with. Or eat.   And now there wasn't any water left to carry Joe out of the damn vase at   all.   How did  that  happen? That  never  happens.  Usually  he comes flying out of there so fast we don't have any time to react and he's lying in the bottom of the collander sucking  air  before we realize it. And then we're freaking for a totally  different  reason.   The net certainly wasn't going to work in this situation.    Keli:  Mom, get him  out  of there!  I reached in with my hand and picked him up as gently as I could from his bed of marbles and put my hand into the temporary pitcher of water. He swam from between my fingers. Phew!!! She then went on to clean the marbles and the vase, replace the bed of marbles, the sea shell and refill it with fresh water, pour the pitcher and Joe back in and put the plant back. Then we fed him some of his favorite blood worms. He's so happy tonight!  Like I said, this job wouldn't be so bad if it weren't for the unpredictability of it all...

      Busy day...  Between going to lunch to toast Lilah on what would have been her 99th birthday, running back to town to get Kel from school, heading home for a while to let Bear, the devil dog, out for a little while, then off to my known-her-since-diapers girlfriend's Mary Kay business kickoff party tonight... it was just a busy day!  I ran tonight watching the premier show of S&H... I only did 3 miles though since it was 10:30 pm. I was already kind of tired. So I watched part of the show without being on Lurch. I was right, it will be the perfect amount of time on the treadmill to watch an entire show while I run.   Thanks Easter Bunny!   Today's Miles:  3  Total so far:  324.75  Still to go for goal:  175.25  Finally, here's a poem, written by my cousin last year when my grandma passed away... in honor of Lilah...   Grama by Jody Brown Miranda 1-17-2003    Blessed with the Luck O' The Irish  She was born on St. Paddy's Day.  Grasping a rosary in her fist  and a feisty desire to pray.     She set her sights on Mr. Brown  and married her Scottish mate  the two of them, side by side,   worked hard and set their own fate.     Soon God sent them four little lassies  and a lad for all to spoil,  helped in childrearing by the Catholic Nuns  all hyjinks were quickly foiled.     Her claim to fame was an ample bosom  and her talent for song and dance.  As a kid I remember her snappy housedresses  and her disdain for young ladies in pants.     I remember Grama Lilah in her apron  at home and in the Catholic School gym   makin' chicken or spaghetti for banquets  or decorating Christmas ornaments with trim.     I also remember the Thanksgiving treats  and the stomachaches we'd be feeling,  and all of us cousins listening in on the grown-ups  through the vent in the first-floor ceiling.     My sweetest memory brings the faces  into sharp focus after all these years.  Grampa Howard hugging and kissing and tickling  'till her laughing eyes filled with tears.     Memories and tales came tumbling out  as we strengthened the Brown family ties  as we waited for her Guardian Angel's descent  as we whispered our loving goodbyes.

      because I just found out that Hutch is the proud owner of  urlLink this .       And my own mother went to Sam's Club today, asked me what I needed and I   forgot   all about this being on my Amazon Wishlist! I could have had her pick this up for me! It would be the perfect running show. PERFECT I tell you!   What's a person to do???

       I'm so lucky...   I love beautiful music. I am so lucky because I get to hear it live and in person. Not as often as I used to and not as often as I like to, but hey, beggars can't be choosers.   Kel is an awesome (and I'm not just being a mom here) french horn player. She's been playing since she was in sixth grade. Back then she was homeschooled, but the school district welcomed her into the school band. And since she was home with me all day for the most part, I encouraged the twenty minute practice per day rule. Only I didn't send her off to do it alone, I practiced with her on the keyboard so she'd know how the tones were supposed to sound, because much of playing a horn is in how you hold your mouth as there are only four keys (three back then) to depress and the rest is all done with the way you play. So she had the advantage of having lots of extra practice time because it was a rare day that we quit at twenty minutes, but there is no doubt about it, she has an ear for music.  Tonight she brought home her music from school and is treating me to rehearsal... she is playing John Williams' The Cowboys. I've always loved this music but I never realized what a terrific horn part it had until now. She is filling up the house with gorgeous sound. This is a good house to fill with high ceilings and wood floors. There isn't a lot of great acoustical material to grab the sound so it does tend to bounce around a bit, but it still sounds beautiful.   So thanks, Kel. I've enjoyed the treat...

       Mileage...   Today I ran watching home movies. I watched my little girl as a little girl - age 18 months to 2 years and just above. That was fun. And interesting for personal reasons that I won't go into here.   I'm on hold now with my old Gray Street Girlfriend. Vivaldi, I think, is playing in the background. I'm sweating and starving. But I'm glad she called. We can't catch up via email anymore. We're too busy! So I guess I'd better not hang up on her. :) Hey girlfriend, next time you visit my blog, you better comment! And be thinking about what movie you want to go see when you do have some time off. I will too.   Grandma and a couple of the granddaughters are off shopping and lunching today. Wish I could join them because it sounds like fun. I just have too much on the agenda. Are you going to see a movie girls???   Tomorrow would have been my grandma's 99th birthday. She died last January (2003) the day before my birthday. Each year on her birthday, her children and several of her grandchildren took her out for a traditional corn beef and cabbage meal (yes, she was Irish). And we'll continue the tradition this year by heading off and lifting a pint and having lunch in her honor.    For those of you scratching your heads over this one, I won't be lifting my vegetarianism for the day... I join the family and eat a different meal, toasting Lilah along with the rest of them...   Okay, so here are the stats for the day...   Today's miles:  4.25  Total so far:  321.75  Still to go for goal:  178.25     Listening to: Nothing. I can't get the damn soundcard working. I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling and rebooting and all that crap. Squat works. I'm torked. We aren't that hard on computers. I don't get it. I really don't. This doesn't happen to other people.

       Ode to Spring...   When oh when will Spring arrive? We're supposed to get snow again tonight. At least that's what I last heard. Believe me. We don't need any more snow around here. Our driveway is a sheet of ice. Keli went out for a run on Sunday. I suggested she take something with her to slide down the driveway on so that she wouldn't fall on her butt heading down to the road because we have quite a nasty hill to get down if there is even a hint of ice. She laughed at me. And proceeded to fall on her butt.   Maybe that impending snowfall is what's making my elbow sore. Maybe it really  is  arthritis. It's tough to get old.   Anybody know anything about Dell computers? And SoundMAX sound cards? Our sound card stopped working. I just don't understand. I think it is the stupid websites we visit. This time it might have been Rathergood.com and the spongemonkeys singing  urlLink We Like the Moon ... Okay. So we are easily amused... Maybe they broke our soundcard (don't pursue legal action, this was just a joke). I would like to be listening to some Crosby, Stills and Nash. Or Chicago. Or Simon and Garfunkel. Or a little Tom Petty. The silence in this office is deafening.   Guess I'll just go run instead. And watch another repeat of a movie...   Oh, and speaking of Nano... Did you know that March is Nanoedmo? I didn't either. Until today. I signed up, but I probably won't get very far this month. I may have a glance over the thing for old times sake... May even print it out and take out a red pen and have a swipe at a few pages... Who knows? We'll see. I might choose another month for editing instead. We'll see.   Back later to post the miles.

      Time just flies by, doesn't it? I can't believe how quickly the weeks are slipping past. In just a short time, my little girl is going to be 16 years old! That one boggles my mind...    Today's miles:  3.55  Total so far:  317.5  Still to go for goal:  182.5  Marge, have you recovered from the crabby old guy giving us the business at the bakery during our Friday morning writing session? He outta be a character in our next writing practice... It might be cathartic. Speaking of that, where are we going to write this Friday now that he's spoiled my mood for your bakery at least for this week?  I've got tennis elbow or something going on in my left elbow. I'd blame it on writing if I was a lefty. I can't figure out what's going on. It isn't from vacuuming because I push the thing with my right arm. I'll have to ponder this one for a while. I must be getting old and have arthritis or something setting into my bones. "Tough gettin' old, eh Ker?" That's what my pops used to say when I started complaining about things. :) Now I can just say, "It sure is." My left pinky is bugging me too now that I think about it. What a baby I'm becoming. Waaahhh! I guess that's what happens when the migraines are managed... I start to notice all the other aches and pains that weren't so evident before.   I found a new favorite pen at the store the other day. Favorite for having black ink, that is. I'm a pen snob you see. And I prefer blue ink. When I do my writing it is in longhand. Except when I do the Nanowrimo thing in November. That I have to do on a keyboard because there was no way I could do a 50,000 word novel longhand in a month. Anyway, this new pen is divine and I have to find it in blue ink now because it is so fabulous. Any other pen snobs out there who want to know the details, leave me a comment and I'll go on some more about it. Marge, it was the one I showed you on Friday.   Okay, I guess that's all I'll ramble for now. You've seen the mileage, that's the important thing for today. Have a good night and before you drift off to sleep, send some good vibes off to Bobby for his platelet counts. He's off to Childrens Hospital tomorrow for tests. Thanks.   Hope your migraine is completely gone tonight Robert.

      Got to watch the final episode of Cheers while I ran today. I'm so glad we taped those shows when they were on. It was fun to have them and find them for running with. Kel watched them with me. This was the last of what we had taped, though, so now I'm finished with them. I do find I can watch them over and over a few times, though. But I've done that now. Time to find something new.    Today's miles:  4.01  Total so far:  313.95  Still to go for goal:  186.05  We're off to deliver Keith to his other home. Well, as soon as I shower. Have a good evening!

       Poetry...   I was listening to Minnesota Public Radio earlier this week and during Midday they had a program with Bill Holm, who has put out a new book of poetry called  urlLink  Playing the Black Piano  . During the course of this show, Bill read a poem called Lemon Pie which was written about a friend who later died from AIDS.   I cried when he finished his reading. It brought back a lot of the same feelings that we swirled in during our brain tumor days. I went out that night and bought  urlLink  Playing the Black Piano  ... Here is Lemon Pie, by Bill Holm.   Lemon Pie  For your last Thanksgiving in Minneota I invited half the universe, Holm's single-handed feed-the-hungry, stuff-the-lonesome-stranger with turkey and giblets and pie. Already death had winked at you  once or twice from behind its shadowy curtain.  My neighbors pitched in with gravy, bread, and labor. Thursday morning Tom brought lemon pies, steaming, acid-sweet smell,  majestic meringues, soaring peaks of beaten egg white. On the table cooling, you smelled them, found a fork, and, a mischievous sweet-toothed boy, were set to violate a hot meringue, when I walked in and said, sharp of voice, "Get the hell out of there! Those hot pies will be ruined if you dig into them."  "So what?" You shot me an insulted look. "They're only pies. Eat them yourself." You skulked out into the morning. Toward night your snit evaporated, and you resumed your usual grace and humor. By then I'd grown my guilty conscience, remembering that you lived under sentence of impending death.  I should have kept my mouth shut, one nagging inner voice  said to another, watched you put an entire hot lemon pie  into your gullet. What a hard business being human -  all we know and remember shadows every simple act.  The next Thanksgiving you lay close to death, all food loathsome, indigestible. Kept half alive with cans of glutinous  Ensure, we made a lemon pie to tempt you into one more  small pleasure, but you impaled the pie with a fork,  left it standing upright in the meringue, and turned away, lost to all joy.  We are who we are until we aren't anything anymore but air. I carry that steaming pie to my own grave, offering it to you over and over again, atonement. I hear your wry voice saying, as you it said so often: "Eat dessert first; life is short and uncertain."    I leave you with his wise words and head off to lurch along on Lurch. I'll be back with my mileage in a bit or after I return Keith to his apartment. Have a good Sunday.

      Keith and I were sitting in the living room this morning reading when we heard a very odd sound... We looked at each other wondering what on earth that was and where it was coming from... What appliance was going on the fritz  this  time?  Then we heard it again and realized what it was...   The Eastern Wood Pewee had returned to our yard and was making its scratchy-voiced call! Wonder if it will nest in its usual spot beneath our screened porch off the master bedroom again?  And driving home from picking up Kel from school this afternoon, we saw a bluebird! I love this time of year!

Today's miles:  6.52  Total so far:  358.37  Still to go for goal:  141.63  You know, staying on the treadmill for such a long time gets me through season one so quickly, how am I going to wait for them to come out with season 2? I haven't even heard  rumors  of season 2 yet! I'm already through the second DVD out of five! Hutch, how many episodes have you made it through?

        Owwwwwwwwwwch...    I always feel much worse from a soreness standpoint a couple of days after a hard workout.  I'm feeling the pain of Wednesday's outdoor run on the pavement in the old shoes today. My legs are hurtin' for certain. I'm heading down to Lurch with Starsky and Hutch now. I'm hoping to go a minimum of two episodes to get some real miles behind me and I'm hoping that in short order the pain will be numbed to a thing of the past...  And at the doc's yesterday I found out I get to cut back to half dosage of my blood pressure meds because I've gotten that in control. And my resting pulse was a lovely 52... I guess I'm getting in shape with all this running! :) I highly recommend it from a mental standpoint, too.   Okay. Wish me luck. I think I'll have a sit in the whirlpool full of epsom salts when I'm through. Or steal Keith's massage this afternoon... kidding.

        It's the Weekend Already!    I'm picking up Keith tonight because tomorrow is Kel's birthday and the opening of her play at school... That means tomorrow is the weekend kind of. Except I didn't go writing with Marge today and I got a long run in. And I won't be writing with Marge on Friday because she can't make it (boohoo!). So it will be more of a regular weekend with Keith sitting in the hottub and therefore plenty of time for me to get out there and run. Right? Right!  That's what I was concerned about. Four days' worth of weekend and slacking on the run right when I've made this challenge to myself. But I'll keep going. Just watch me. And push me.   Please.

        Summer!    Or so it practically feels...   It is gorgeous out there today! And so, I ran outside! What a fun time...   I walked very quickly the first 1/2 mile out to the end of our driveway where I did my stretching. While standing there stretching, I noticed the mailbox was standing wide opened because there was a box sticking out of it. I walked over to investigate. Our postal delivery person sucks. Forgive this statement, but truly... what US Postal person does this? Leaves the too-large delivery in the box with the door hanging open and the rest of the mail just sitting in there, able to blow out or be taken by anyone walking or driving by? We had something from our bank in there! I stuffed the mail under the box (no small feat, indeed, that box was wedged in there but good) so a thief or the wind would really have to work to get it out and started off on the run.  I discovered that 1 pm on a week day is a pretty good time for a run around here. Traffic was light today. This is a good thing because country road shoulders are pretty light, too.   I ran all of the way to the cemetery before my first walk. Not far, but pretty good considering I'm pounding the pavement rather than running on a nice bouncy treadmill at a slower pace and now I'm doing hills rather than flat landing it as usual, and now I've got wind working against me instead of climate control. The walk was very brief... About 10 steps and I realized I didn't really need it. Just long enough to scare the robin off the fence and notice the valentine heart by my old town chairman's gravestone.   I picked it up again and admired the new houses ahead and the two large dogs in the yard of one of them; the two large unchained dogs who were noticing me and trotting toward the road; the two large dogs whose master was also in the yard collecting the large dogs' large poops with a large poop pooper scooper. He looked up when he noticed his dogs had become interested in something coming up the road. He called to them. One of them came back and the other one stayed real interested in me. I kept moving straight at him. He kept looking at me and making this interesting noise. Not a bark, not a growl... just an interesting noise in his chest... kind of like, "Can I keep it Daddy? Can I? Huh? Huh?" I reached the driveway and kept on running. The dog just stood there looking at me. Watched me run past. That was all.   It was about this time I realized that by the time I reached the next bridge over the Kinni, I was going to have to stop completely, take off my right shoe, dump the sand out and put it back on. That's what I get for wearing the  old  shoes. But see, I didn't want to wear my good running shoes when I have to go through the muddy driveway to get out to the road because I know I'll be back on the treadmill on rainy days (probably tomorrow) and I don't want to wear muddy shoes on the treadmill. So I have to wear the old shoes which have three open holes in them. Yes, we are talking very old running shoes here. Broken down. I could go out and get replacements for them. That's actually what I'm wearing on the treadmill. Replacements for these. But I still can't give these up. These are the gods of running shoes. I promised myself I would throw these out when those arrived. But I couldn't do it. Because they don't make these anymore. Dang Nike. I don't know what their problem is. Why would a company stop making a running shoe? Especially a specific specialty shoe? I was heartbroken when I began looking for the replacement and found out I couldn't get them anymore. So was Kel because she had grown into it and started wearing it too. She was the other reason I couldn't throw them out when the new ones arrived.   I digress.   Suddenly it struck me that I wasn't even going to make it to the bridge because the sandy shoe had come untied. Rats. So I had to stop at the corner and take it off to dump it and retie it anyway. And I had double-knotted it! So I reached over and tightened the double knot on the left side, too. Good thing. It was loose. I started off again. But if I was going to stop completely and have to restart, it couldn't have actually happened at a better place... my restart was on a downhill point. I glided downhill and didn't think much about running past the lonely house with the workmen and the fact that I hadn't brought my cell phone with me. Instead, I was continuing to write this entry in my head and watching the robin in the yard.   I ran over the bridge above the river and didn't stop to watch for trout. I just kept going, interested in whether my level of fitness had improved much since my last outside run in the late summer/fall of last year. I started paying attention to that... Less bounce of the various parts of my body. That must mean something. And I'm definitely doing a lot more running with less walking. I started running up one of the killer hills knowing that this would be a tell-tale sign. Normally on this hill I'm telling myself to just get to the top and then I can walk for a while. This time I just ran. Didn't think much about anything... And suddenly the ground was leveling off and I kept on running... Another good sign. I guess my fitness level has improved a bit. I didn't have any cramps. This actually surprised me because I didn't drink much water before taking off today and I know that can have a lot of impact on the muscles.   The final mile and a half was the toughest because I did stop at the last bridge and do a little stretching and water gazing/listening/enjoying. And I wished for a bottle of spring water to drink. I was thirsty. And I stopped for a walk shortly before that so I could spit. Spitting while I'm running is always a nasty affair because it inevitably just spreads all across my face. TMI you say? This whole entry is TMI... look how damn long it is!   Got back to the mailbox and tugged and pulled the box (there were actually two) out and the rest of the mail and walked the last half mile home for the cool down. What a gorgeous day for running outside. It is supposed to be in the 60's again tomorrow, but they are talking thunderstorms. Probably a good day for lurching on Lurch, I guess.   I've gotta get another bottle of water and hit the showers now. Hope you all enjoyed (haha) this play by play of my run. I left out a lot believe it or not. Like the fact that I was wearing an outfit that made me feel like I walked out of an episode of Star Trek and could be 'beamed up' at any minute, or the woman I saw tootling around on a four-wheeler with her golden retriever on a leash. Guess the dog needed exercise but she didn't? I wanted to yell at her for putting the animal at risk like that. Looked dangerous to me. Oh well.   Gosh, almost forgot the stats!   Today's miles:  5.5  Total so far:  348.5 (Wow! Look how close I am to another duck!)  Still to go for goal:  151.5

       This and That...   In honor of  urlLink Stacey , who loves bullets...   It's going to be 60 degrees farenheit tomorrow... I'll be running  outside,  thank you very much.    I need to gather up the pink flamingos from their current listing positions in the yard or the 60 degree heat will carry them down the hill with the torrents of melting snow...    I think I'm finished buying bananas. Everytime I do, I bring a new batch of those danged little fruit flies into the house and they manage to find me in the office and buzz around my face while I'm at the computer. Drives me insane.    I'm hopefully getting a haircut today! Good thing, too because it was getting too long for my spiking up with spray. It was getting to the point where I was frightening little children at the post office again...     I'm  Starsky,  she's  Hutch...    My baby is actually turning 16 years old on Thursday at 6:11 am (that's 5:11 am according to her birth certificate, but she was born mountain time...   Bear needs his one and only dew claw removed (is that how it is spelled?) so we're going to have it done when he goes in for his spring check up this year.     Kel missed the bus yesterday so I made her get up 10 minutes earlier today.     When I told her the Relay theme last night, Kel said "Disco should never have happened!"    I corrected her swiftly and sternly.    I think she has come around.     Okay, I'm heading off to hit Lurch. I have some miles to put on before I can go for my possible haircut. Hope you all have a great day. I'll be back to post the mileage.

      The Relay Committee has announced the theme for the Relay for Life in June. This is where things start to get really fun. Now we get to take the theme and start to figure out how to decorate our campsite, whether we'll be dressing up at all for the team parade, how our "Lady" will be dressed for the  Dude Looks Like a Lady  competition, etc. All of this gets planned with the theme in mind.   The craftier of the crew (Alta and anyone else with abilities - not me...) will set to work with sewing machine, hot glue gun, paints and her incredible mind and she'll really come up with something awesome while we shout out ideas at her if we actually think of any. And we'll buy stuff. Usually at  urlLink Oriental Trading Company  because they have tons of stuff that fit the theme and because you can often find reasonable prices. And yes, we always buy way too much. So if anybody wants a good deal on Mardi Gras beads and masks, you know where to come (that was last year's theme).   So, it should be a good time. I'm looking forward to it. I sent out an e-mail to everyone on the team with e-mail capabilities. That's all but one on the team. I'll ask my mom  (hey Mom, are you getting this???)  to call her tomorrow and let her know verbally... So by tomorrow, the whole team will know the theme.   You're all biting your nails aren't you? You're dying to know.   Okay. I'll tell you.   I won't keep you in suspense any longer.   Here it is.   The theme.  Are you ready for this?     Staying Alive    Is that not the greatest? What better message for those cancer survivors walking around that track... Well, I could think of a few songs with better lyrics to walk around during their surivor lap...       Well, you can tell by the way I use my walk,  I'm a woman's man: no time to talk.   Music loud and women warm, I've been kicked around  since I was born.   And now it's all right.  It's OK.   And you may look the other way.   We can try to understand  the New York Times' effect on man.  Whether you're a brother or whether you're a mother,  you're stayin' alive, stayin' alive.   Feel the city breakin' and everybody shakin',  and we're stayin' alive, stayin' alive.   Ah, ha, ha, ha, stayin' alive, stayin' alive. Ah, ha, ha, ha, stayin' alive.    But maybe they'll be walking to something else...  Okay. I'm going to bed. I'm tired after the six mile walk and all the running around today.   First though - happy anniversary to my Kel and Keith for five beautiful years... Or happy 5th birthday to Keli as we like to say also. She's just a baby! :o) It's been much longer than that really. Keith's actually been her dad since just before she turned three because that's when he became the most important man in our life, but it became legally documented five years ago today.

       Weekend weirdness...   So Keith and I were lying around reading on Saturday night. I'm reading aloud again - and this time it is  I Had Brain Surgery, What's Your Excuse?  (an excellent and very funny book, by the way) - and all of a sudden as I was nearing the end of the chapter (about the fourth or fifth, and it was very late but we were enjoying it so much that I couldn't put it down - too many weird similarities to our own experiences with the medical world during his surgery)...   ANYWAY... (take a breath)  all of a sudden there is this HUGE boom.   Like a cannon.   I swear.   I thought we were being bombed or something. Or that I would wake up in the morning to the light of day, look across the valley and discover that neighbor Don's house was missing because the noise that I had heard was a neighbor's house blowing up or something. It was that loud. To me. I stopped reading and we both looked at each other.    Me:  What the hell was that?  Him:  What  was  that?  I looked at my watch.    Me:  1:15  We sat there silently looking at each other for a couple of minutes.   That's when it happened again.    Me:  Oh my god! What is going on???  Keith got out of bed and opened shades and looked south into the dark woods wondering if he'd see a fire ball or something. We swore something had to have blown up.  Nothing. We went from window to window looking out and looking for the burning propane tanks or house or something. Absolutely nothing. We opened a bedroom window to see if we could hear sirens in the distance or anything. Nothing. About three minutes it happened one last time. We never heard anything about it from anyone else. We never read about anything in the paper (so far). Nothing.   I still say it sounded like a cannon. It was that loud. But it was the middle of the night time silence. Keith says it sounded like a hunter in the woods just shooting when we get them not too far from the house. He didn't think it was any louder than that.   It was LOUD. Horrible and frightening. And the middle of the night, people. Put your guns away. What can you see in the middle of the night?   Even weirder? We never heard a dog bark. Not one. Where were all our obnoxious neighbor dogs who bark at everything? Explain this to me! I'm glad Keith heard it, too. So it wasn't all in  my  imagination!

       Monday Monday, for Marlene...   Well, I went ahead and missed my first of the 10 days I had to make that goal, so that means I now have 9 days and updating the average I now have to do 4.78 miles per day in order to get to 375.   WOW!   So today I did 6 just to kick things off in a big way and make up for lost time. Because it was dumb to miss yesterday. But I always manage to do that. You know. Get lazy that first day and regret setting myself up like that. But I watched two S&H episodes and took my time, mostly walking and very little running so I wouldn't burn out.    Today's miles:  6.0  Total so far:  338  Still to go for goal:  162  Today I ran for a friend of my mom's - Marlene Z.   And I heard from Elizabeth, that her mom Sydnor will have her last chemo for a while this week. Hurray for you, Sydnor! Glad you'll get a little break from that. Hope you are feeling well or will be feeling well soon.   I'm having so much fun watching the Starsky and Hutch episodes! Thanks again Easter Bunny! Those were a great purchase for the cause! Well worth it! Very entertaining and they hold my attention and make me forget any aches and pains while I'm running or walking... I really appreciate it!  Well, I suppose I'd better get to the shower. Have to pick up Kel soon and it will be a busy week.   She has play practice every night because the play opens on Thursday night, plus it is the last week of third quarter, so homework and finals abound. Can you spell S T R E S S E D ??? She has to give an oral report from the point of view of a character from a book she picked out and read this quarter on her birthday on Thursday, too. Her chosen book was  The Bell Jar  by Sylvia Plath. She is thinking of having a(n) (intentional) nervous break down in the middle of the report... Keep in mind this is my very type-A and extremely shy perfectionist child who doesn't like calling attention to herself in class.   I still have to laugh when I think of Lorelei and Rory (Mother and daughter from Gilmore Girls - our must-see-tv on Tuesday nights) sitting in front of their open gas stove cooking s'mores and trying to keep warm when the heat went out at their house and Lorelei saying something along the lines of "Did anyone ever stop to think that maybe Sylvia Plath  wasn't  crazy? Maybe she was just cold?" Okay. Sick humor, but everytime I see  The Bell Jar  in Kel's hands or she mentions her project, I think of it and one of us starts laughing about it.

      Sitting here in the office to write this out I'm just amazed listening to the wind in the trees. Unfortunately it isn't a nice warm southerly wind, either. Keith and I had some errands to run in town this morning and with the sunshine and blue skies, I assumed it was a decent enough morning out there to wear jeans and a t-shirt, light jacket and a pair of sandals. It would have been had we drove everywhere, but we parked the car by the market and walked to the coffee shop when we'd finished our shopping. At least we didn't have to walk to the post office and bank, too. We used the car for those stops.   We were literally blown from the coffee shop back to our car and really had to fight the wind on the way up to it. Once we got there, we listened to a grandpa complaining about how the wind was going right through his fleece jacket and that he didn't want to go back out in it and then he and his little grandson waited there for someone to pick them up while we had our drinks.   Here are the miles I ran for Marge's friend Mary! (and for Marge...)   Today's miles:  5.0  Total so far:  391.96  Still to go for goal:  108.04   I'm so ready to be under 100 miles. I may need to head to the school a couple of nights with mom this week after Kel leaves for Japan so I can get extra miles in at the top of the month. We're gettin' down to the wire!  Keli was off to the MOA today with a friend who had a school project to do there. They spent about six hours there. Sounds like it was fun. She came home with a few trinkets that she likes. She's back now and anxious to check the blogs of her friends. Keith is out walking to the mailbox in the blustery wind. Bear is outside barking pathetically because he wanted to go along. And because he is hungry since he thinks it is dinner time. He'll be happy for the start of daylight savings time as he still hasn't become accustomed to the time change from last fall.   I want to go see the movie  Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind . Sounds wonderful. Sometime soon maybe.   I need a shower. Guess it is time.

        Weekend!    Busy day yesterday with writing and running around, so that means I have to get lots of running on the feet in today!  Yesterday while meeting with Marge, I learned about her friend Mary M. who has been fighting cancer for quite some time. And I'm talking about really donning the suit of armor and going into battle. She has been a tough cookie! I'm running this weekend for Mary. And for my friend Marge. Because she's a honey with a really big heart. Smooches, Marge. I love you.  I'm off to lurch along on Lurch now. I'll be back.

      Happy Happy Birthday to Every Boy and Girl!  But mostly to my   MUCH OLDER BROTHER!!!       It's a big important birthday, too! He's 45 today!   Woohoo!!!!!!!!!    Love ya, bro! MMMMMMMMWWWWAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA! Cyberkisses!      Edited to add:    (From the comments) "You may remember hearing that our first daughter, Kimberlie, was born the same day as your brother Kent, and your mother and I were room mates at the Hudson Hospital. Tom always said  "your brother Kent was the first boy his daughter ever slept with." ( at age 1 day). ....... Kimberlie is finding it hard get old.How is Kent taking it????"   My reply - I stopped over to see him this afternoon... He's in pretty good shape for a guy his age. He seems to be taking it fine, but with this many years' experience, he's gotten to be a pretty good actor. Who knows?     I completely forgot, Carol! Thank you for reminding me... here's a slice of cake for the first girl Kent ever slept with...  HUGE GRINS...  Happy Birthday to YOU, Kim!

It was fun... See you tomorrow after my writing with Marge and other running around. Kel gets to see Hidalgo tomorrow night.

        More hints...     Josh Groban rocks my socks. Listen to him while cleaning and you may or may not get anything done. You may just stop everytime he hits a great note and clasp your hands together at your chest (or spread your arms wide - both are great) and hit it with him...  at the top of your lungs... this house has great acoustics for singing. And the spawn of satan is a great audience. Really.      David Gray also rocks my socks. Listen to him and cleaning flies by. If you can get anything done while dancing. Truly.    Bare feet or shoes are best for dancing on hard wood floors. Socks alone are far too slippery. Danger! Danger Will Robinson!    When hungry and cooking a lunch of ramen on the stove, don't leave it there for the requisite three minutes to update the blog without setting a timer. You  will not  remember that it is boiling. Until you smell it or hear the results of the water having been boiled away. Bad idea.     Ramen that has been cooked for 20 mintues tastes more like paste. No matter what you top it with.    Back to work...

        Great news!    Hey, guess what? In doing all of this cleaning today, I've discovered that I think I'm going to need another garage sale! Isn't that great?   I'm so  dreading it  excited. Dad already said I can't have it at his house again back when we had the last one there. Guess this will be a country sale! Yippee! I bet you almost anything Keith will stay at his apartment that weekend. Unless he gets nervous about what I might sell out from under him. That might bring him home.   The one good thing is how I'll feel when it is all over and the house is back to its good old normal pared-back and simple feel. I'm so tired of piles and clutter. I can't think with all of this stuff - wonderful as some of it is. How did we acquire so much? Somebody needs to cancel Christmas and birthdays and all of the rest of the holidays for a few years. Then we can stop spoiling each other with too many gifts.   Back to work...

        Hints... cont.     Always remember, when standing on a barstool to change lightbulbs, if the phone rings and it is mid-morning? It's most likely a telemarketer and  not  someone you know who is in critical need of getting a hold of you. How many critical phone calls do you get in the middle of the morning anyway? There is probably no need to panic and drop the lightbulb and/or  fall  scramble down from the stool to rush for the phone.    Even better, get out the ladder when changing lightbulbs. It is only a few feet away in the garage, after all.    Having a lightbulb moment (the kind in your brain - not the kind listed above) while standing atop a barstool, is also not a great idea. Hey MOM! It was Gloria Bunker Stivik (thanks Hutch)!!! The other night while watching Gilmore Girls (must see TV Tuesday night... it was a repeat I've now seen three times thanks to the miracle of videotape,  and  the one with Lorelei joking about Sylvia Plath being cold, ironically enough - anyway, I digress again), I asked you who that woman was that Lorelei and Rory were visiting and having cocoa with and you didn't know (but you also didn't get to see her very much after I asked you that.)  It was little Gloria, all grown up and many years later!     It's best if you have pets that scurry underfoot (especially spawn of satan pets) to let them outside and leave them there when you'll be climbing up and down on barstools. 'nuff said.   Back to work.

        Hints from Helo... er... Keri     Don't argue with your teenager first thing in the morning as you are sending them off to a hard day at school. You'll feel horrible about it all day and it will be pretty much the only thing you can think about no matter what else you are doing.    When cleaning a sink "to the nines" and soaking it in bleach water for that extra shine and sparkle, don't lean over it in a not-tucked-in t-shirt to clean the mirror that is behind it. You may dangle said t-shirt in bleach water and then wander around the house for twenty minutes or so before noticing that you have bleach water dripping from your body.    Do not wear your very   VERY   favorite jeans while cleaning your house "to the nines". You may end up doing something really stupid (see above) and dribbling bleach water on them, leading to much wailing and gnashing of teeth. Not that anyone around here would do that over something as silly as a pair of jeans, but you never know.  You  might, and I'm giving you hints.     Do not sneeze at the very end of cleaning a gigantic mirror unless you happen to also be smart enough to turn your head, or have time to cover your entire face with your arm or something. Unless of course you  enjoy  cleaning gigantic mirrors over and over again and it makes your day to feel like you are spending inordinate amounts of time doing the same job twice when there are miriad jobs still ahead of you. Then by all means. Take that sneeze and let 'er rip. All over the mirror. TMI. I know. Allergies. Welcome to Spring.    To be continued as the day goes on. Because I just know that I'll have more brilliant flashes of inspiration every 45 minutes or so when I get to take a little break from my work.

        Thursday Question...    Okay. Here we are with my fascinating question of the week hoping to generate some additional comments because you all know how I like to hear from people.     Mwaaa  to my regular comment posters!   This week's question comes to us from  urlLink The Little Book of Stupid Questions  (and yes, I do actually own this book; a writer must have all sorts of research and idea material)...   Is it more time efficient (and just plain  better ) to put on both socks and then both shoes, or one sock, one shoe and then the other sock, the other shoe?   I actually saw this situation argued on an episode of All in the Family between Archie Bunker and his son-in-law, who's name - other than Meathead - totally escapes me now. They must have argued about it for a good 10 minutes! I won't tell you who was on what side of the argument or what his view was until after I hear your comments, good people. I DO hope I hear your comments.   Okay. I have work to do. I hope you all get back to me on this very serious issue in our world today.   And by the way - Happy April Fools Day! Hope it is a good one for you and someone is able to play a great joke on you. Because everyone needs a good laugh in life.

      Just wanted to let ya'll know that I kicked it at the school with mom tonight. Her pedometer wasn't working very well, however. And my pedometer just tells me how many steps I've taken which isn't very helpful right now for me, I'm afraid... But for the time we walked and the speed we walked, we  know  we did at  least  four miles. So that's what I'm giving myself on the charts tonight.  I don't know if that changes things at all in Hutch land, but it gives me a boost in starting out April toward making it to 500 by the end of the month. That's my goal. Anyone want to place a little bet with me? Have I got any takers? I was originally shooting for June 1, but I'm betting I can hit May 1.   What do   YOU   think?   Tonight's miles:  4.0  Total so far:  383.86  Still to go for goal:  116.14  I'm tired. I'm sore. I'm going to bed. Well, pretty soon. ;)

        Reporting In...    Well Hutch. I suppose Jacob will get his breakfast in bed for this one.    Today's miles:  4.0  Total so far:  379.86  Still to go for goal:  120.14  Make sure you check back in before bed tonight if it's close, though. I might go up and do another round of workout with mom tonight if she is walking at the school tonight as usual... Just for fun and the extra miles.

        Sad Anniversary...    Today I'm running for our dear family friends Carol and Tom. As I've said before, I don't run for cancer every day. There are other special reasons I run. This is one of them.   A year ago today Tom and Carol lost their son in a frightening and very sad  urlLink shooting . Once again, I'm left with very few words because there is so little that can be said that doesn't sound trite. I send you my love Mr. and Mrs. M. Know that I think of you and your family often.  I'll be back to post my miles in a bit. Just heard from the papa. He's coming out to look over the tractor. As I was putting it away last fall, Keith looked at me and said, "Watch, the breaks are going to fail on it as we put it away." We've had problems with the breaks busting before. And what happened just as I was putting the dang thing away? The breaks made an awful noise and gave out. Just like that. I swear that boy can jinx just about anything if he sets his mind to it.

        Lock Down!    Well, there is a lovely situation going on in our little town today. About a week and a half ago, the manager of a local restaurant found a tiny bit of grafitti on the wall in one of their bathrooms and reported it to police. It was a handwritten statement threatening UWRF African-American students and referring to Columbine High School. It also mentioned today's date. As a result, all of our schools are in lock-down mode today because the police and campus authorities have been investigating the threat and haven't come up with anything as yet and are concerned for the safety of all of the kids. Thank goodness.   Kel came home from school yesterday and said there had actually been another incident on Monday at the UW. She said a fire alarm had been pulled and when authorities got to the alarm site, another bit of threatening grafitti was found. Fun fun. So it is a bit of a tense day around here. I'm sure it is a prank. But it isn't a good prank. And tensions are running high.   Keep the kids in your thoughts today.

      The snow was thankfully unimpressive yesterday. It fell for a sum total of two minutes and if you blinked, you missed it. We didn't even get any rain. We aren't expecting any of the warmer temperatures this week, but snow is back out of the forecast at least.    Today's miles:  6.26  Total so far:  375.86 (Made the goal with a day to spare!!!)  Still to go for goal:  124.14  Yummmmmm. Frango mint. I don't allow myself two anymore. Even on the high-mileage days. They go too fast that way. Thanks again, Dranny Alta. They are still great incentive. Terrific combined with S&H Season One DVD's.   Cool. Made it to 375 by the end of the month, now let's see how much closer I can get to 400 tomorrow to settle Hutch's family bet.   Visited at my cousin's house for a bit on Sunday while we met up to discuss the big Japan trip for the girls. It was my first visit there. They have a beautiful place in the woods. They were just finishing up a big birthday party for my uncle. The big finish involved karaoke. Yep, a family bash with karaoke. My own little family of origin is made up of people far too shy to do anything like that. Although my mom did sing at this party. Then again, my mom is the least shy of the bunch. Not a shy bone, eh Mom? She and Nando sang first off, from what I hear. Ricky Martin was the song - something fast. Way to go, you two. Sounds like it was a great production. Kel and Dad did  not  sing, however... much more typical of how our party with karaoke would go...   Well, would love to stick around and write more, but I'm coming up slow here today. Everything is stumbling off my fingers at a  v e r y  s l o w  p a c e... I'd better shower and get ready to go get the kid. I took Bear along to pick her up last night when I had to get her late from the school from her last night of any play involvement (they took apart the set and did a kind of awards with voting on made up catagories - Kel won "best techie")... Anyway, one of the other kids needed a ride home and it was dark outside so Bear, who is getting old and kind of blind and cranky decided to be particularly crabby and bark at her in a mean way. She was already kind of afraid of dogs. I don't think I'll take him on too many more rides to get the kid in case other kids need rides. He's such a brat sometimes. Spawn of Satan.

      That's the sound of my neck when I try and turn it to the left. I think I slept on it wrong. I hate when that happens.   It's one of those all-in-one weather days. Woke up this morning to a beautiful sun rise with incredible blue color in the sky and a forecast of snow and rain showers. Haven't gotten them yet, but the clouds have definitely taken over and turned the sky a hazy shade of winter. The forest is now definitely gloomy and dismal. I wish the rain/snow would just move in and get it over with. A nice thunderstorm would be cool. Those are always good.   Today's miles:  5.5  Total so far:  369.6  Still to go for goal:  130.4  Forgot to send a note to the HS office today telling them about Kel's pending Japan trip. She wants to let them know and start getting her homework in advance to get going on it. Unfortunately there are only four days of school left before spring break. I'm not sure how many teachers are going to get the homework together for her in that time. Can't believe she is going to be leaving in just a week and a couple of days!   Well, I'd better shower and get ready to pick up Kel from school. And my house needs some desperate housework. One of my days off from mommyhood when Kel leaves for Japan is going to be devoted to going to Keith's apartment and cleaning and organizing for him, too.   Where's that snow? Bring it on! Let's get it over with!

      It was tax day and run Kel to the play day and run errands day (picking up flowers for Kel, going to the co-op, going to the bank, returning things to Tar-zhay, stopping for coffee, putting the button together for th ebirthday party Kel was going to today, waiting up for Kel to return from the after-the-play-party, etc.)...   I didn't run yesterday. That didn't mean I didn't feel guilty and think about how I  should  be running practically every minute of the day.   Today, I did run. 5.73 miles. I ran for Kathy's dad, Gerry C. I'm running to bring him comfort and peace. He is at home with hospice. Love and hugs to you, Kath. And to your family.    Today's miles:  5.73  Total so far:  364.1  Still to go for goal:  135.9  I won't be as close to 400 as I'd hoped at the end of the month, but I'll be getting there. Barring any significant problems, I'll definitely be able to hit 375 with three days left.   Gotta run now. Taking Keith back to his apartment. This four day weekend went fast. Too fast. ...Sigh...

      After many laughs with  urlLink Bill  in the past over Peeps and the many iterations they've been through in their marketing twists and turns over the years (not that  I'd  ever eat them, mind you), I had to laugh today when Keith and I went into our favorite coffee shop in the old home town and found the front page of the Express section of the cities paper covered with photos of Peeps in dioramas sent in by readers competing for prizes. A funny little contest by the paper. Here's a link. Hope you get a kick out of it. Make sure you scroll through the photos. They were priceless. And the article was pretty humorous, too!    urlLink Peep show   On with my workout.   Update: Man, did I have troubles trying to publish this! I spent many frustrating hours hopping in and trying to get it to take. Thought I was going to have to spend all week next week re-vamping my site just to get things going again. Thank goodness things are finally moving this morning (Sunday). I'm changing date and time to reflect the time I actually wrote and ran to reflect truth in publishing. :) I'll be back later today if I have anything to report from a running standpoint, but Keith and I are off to Red Wing, Minnesota now to celebrate my parents' 51st Wedding Anniversary with them and one of my brothers and his family. The other bro' is entertaining his in-laws for Easter. Happy Weekend to all... And here are the stats from yesterday...    Don't worry Sue (if you actually found the site)... I took it easy, despite the numbers...   Saturday's Miles:  4.0  Total so far: 425.94  Still to go for goal:  74.06  Later!

      No running today as ordered by Sue my magnificent massage therapist. Got a massage from her too! And in all honesty, she ordered a  week  of rest. Well, if she ever finds this website (Hi Sue!) and manages to comment on it... I'll know that she found me out and discovered that this one day was my week of rest... ahem.   In other news, she pointed me toward some arch supports to help with the foot problem, realigned my twisting pelvis (I swear I'm just doing too many Elvis moves) and got me on the road to recovery. I'll be fine tomorrow.   Got e-mails from Kel and Bill (one of her fabbo traveling companions...). He sent photos! So I've decided to post one. I'll leave the rest (unless I get a really great one that can't wait) for her to share with her friends before I post any more later. Perhaps when he makes a photo CD for them, he'll also make one for their parents who may never see that CD again, or any copies of the photos from it! (hint hint)  So here are the girls, climbing the stairs to their seats in the First Class section!        Now I'm going to join my hubby at whatever he's going since I just got him home from his apartment for the weekend.   See you tomorrow when I'm back to post my miles for the day!

      Well, kiddo has been on the plane for about five hours so far. I just took a look on the airline's website to see what the plane layout is. There are twelve seats upstairs and a galley and a private bathroom for the twelve people sitting up there. Nice. I don't suppose they are suffering much. They have another eight hours or so to go. Rough journey, eh?   Don't worry. I'm not going to give updates every few hours. In fact, this is going to be my second to last post of the evening. I'm going to go do some more putzing perhaps. Yes indeed, Mark! We runners putz all the time! Not only around the house, though. I'm a putz pretty much every where I go. Ask my brother. He'll agree whole heartedly. yuck yuck.   Okay. Enough. Good thing I've got a massage tomorrow. I needs it my precious.   Watching those miles wind down? I've got two things going through my mind.   1) What will I do for that last mile? I'm picturing friends and family gathered up at the track where the Relay will take place with some streamers stretched across it - me running down the track breaking through at the end (in slow motion)... Music playing, can't you hear it??? I'm hearing Chariots of Fire... (hehehe... good grief what a melodramatic sap I can be) What do  you  see?   and   2) What will become of this blog when the 500 has been reached?   I said I was giving myself until June 1 to reach my goal, so do I keep on running to see how far I get until June 1? Some of my pledgers?/donors? said they were pledging a certain amount per mile up to the 500 and a few of them said that they would give me over and above if I went over and above by June 1. Well, I made a personal goal for fitness of running a thousand miles this year, so I'm obviously going to keep running, I guess I can keep the blog going and keep reporting on my progress so those who've pledged in that manner can keep track of me. Also, the Relay doesn't take place until mid-June, anyone who might come on board reading the blog later, may want to make a donation to a great/fantastic/fabulous/important cause at some point after I reach 500 but before the Relay and would still be able to do that if I keep blogging until then.   Hello, my name is Keri and I'm a blog addict.   The first step is admitting you have a problem. Time for that shower. I'm making some ramen and going to go soak in a tub after that shower. Mmmmmmm ramen. Mmmmmmmm soaking in hot epsom salt water. With ramen. And candles. And the music from Chariots of Fire. Okay, maybe not. I bet I can find something better than that. Later kids.   Thanks for your support. And comments. Notice I'm not asking for more. Because that always bites me in the butt. Which I no longer have because  I ran it off tonight!  Woooohoooo!

You just sent that e-mail! You've GOT to be online!!! (breaking concentration, eyes flying open, nearly falling off chair and onto floor)...  KinnicChick:    MARGE!!!!    KinnicChick:  Hey, wait a minute. I'm not getting a message back saying anything about her. Don't I usually? Or do I add those witty silences and stuff later when I post them into my blog? Hmmmmm. Feeling stupid...  KinnicChick:  insert huge stupid smiley face grin here - :D  Marge:  (Complete and utter silence)  KinnicChick:  I'm so bored. Ho Hum.  Marge:  (The kind of silence that hums in your ears)  KinnicChick:  She really  did  just send me an e-mail so I don't understand this at all.  Marge:  (Silence so deep you begin to wonder if you really are alone in the world and everything else is just a dream)  Time passes   KinnicChick:  Well, now it's been about 15 minutes since she sent it and it's getting rather late at night, so I suppose she has gone by now and signed off. Brat. I guess I may as well give up on her. Snot. Your loss, Marge. You had this great opportunity to chat with me but you blew it and got off line right after sending me an e-mail without waiting five minutes to see if I would bring up my buddy list and find you first. Oh well. Maybe next time. See you tomorrow! At the challenge write-off!     Keri sits there quietly looking at her screen for several more minutes wondering if perhaps she should just wait a little longer because maybe Marge is watching the one-sided conversation and laughing at her, but then she decides that if that  is  the case, it's best to cut her losses now and turn off the computer and go to bed.

        Why do I wait so long?    Had a call from Kel a couple of hours ago...  from the plane!     Kel:  Hi.   Me:  Hi! Where are you?  Kel:  On the plane.  Me:  Oh. Are you  comfortable?   Kel:  You  knew?   Me:  Yeah.  Kel:  I hate you.  Me:  Well, I didn't actually find out about it until after I left you at the airport yesterday. Is it cool?   Kel:  We had to come up a staircase to get to our seats!  Me:  I hope they are taking lots of pictures.  Kel:  They are. They took pictures of us coming up here.  Me:  Were your jaws hanging on the ground?  Kel:  Yeah, pretty much.   She sounded uber excited. I could hear the other three chatting and Nat giggling in the background. God this is going to be an awesome trip for them. What an experience.   Good news in the old hometown this past week. An old school chum of mine is home from Iraq. Glad to see it. Welcome home, Chris. Haven't seen him since my ex graduated from high school or before, but I've thought about him plenty during this war when I'd heard he was over there. Spoke with the ex on the phone for a while the other night (that was a trip after about 10 years or so of non-conversation) and told him about Chris's return and did some reminiscing about their high school wrestling days.   After my late night last night I need a jump start to get moving this afternoon... maybe I should make a little coffee - medicine of our pal  urlLink David Bailey ???       Java Junkie  David M. Bailey 2002  I like a caramel cappuccino with a double shot of jo And a white chocolate mocha, you can make that one to go See, I'm a coffee connoisseur, a Dali lama of latte  A genuine java junkie every hour of the day   Columbia and Kenya, Ethiopia, Peru  They all make a fine roast, the French do too  Cubans drink it sweet, the Turkish drink it strong  Me, I just drink it,  All. Day. Long.   Most drink it for breakfast, some after they dine  Guess they just don't know you can drink it anytime  Pre-brunch, post-lunch, afternoon tea  Perfect coffee breaks if you're asking me  I like to brew a pot before the lights go out  Some say it keeps me up, I say it helps, no doubt   Now, some of you are thinking it's gonna make me sick  That I should switch to decaf as though that would do the trick  But I've learned a thing or two in my 30-something years,  Life is short so stay awake before it disappears  And if that means that I should drink an extra cup of Joe  Well sign me up, fill my cup, let it overflow   It's more than just a beverage; it's better than a drug  It's like an old best friend who greets you with a hug    Okay, headed off to  lurch  run my butt off on Lurch...   I've been putzing around here and hoping that the beautiful sunshine would bring the temps up enough to make me want to run outside, but it never did.   Back in a bit to post my results.

My  spoiled brat  adorable daughter and the rest are flying first class in those luxury seats that slide out into beds to and from Japan. Oh yeah. This will be a trip to remember.

       Today's miles:  4.5  Total so far:  414.86  Still to go for goal:  85.14  I was all about taking it easy on the foot because Sue, my all-knowing massage therapist and guru-extraordinaire said so. And seeing as how I'm going to have a massage on Friday, I didn't want to be getting in trouble with her when I go see her so I thought I'd better listen up and listen good. So these were  easy  miles, not my usual running miles. These were cool and calm walking miles that didn't require an immediate shower afterwards.   Okay. I'm outta here. I have lots to do before bed that don't involve sitting here catching up on my blog friends. Honest. I want my house in ahhhhhhhhh shape still before I sleep. I'm working on that as my goal tonight. It's coming along nicely. And I'm not doing anything that I need to post helpful hints about, either.    Listening to: Ghost in the Machine by The Police

        They're off!    Kel and Nat are on their way! In fact, they're probably already in Seattle by now, as that leg of the journey was a short one. They'll spend today doing a little site-seeing there with my cousin Dianne and her husband Bill, spend a night at their place and fly off to Japan with them tomorrow afternoon! I'm so excited for them! What a fun trip. Wish I could be there! I hope they have a great time. I can't wait to hear all about it when they get back.

Just to forewarn you, foot?              I STILL HAVE NEARLY 90 MILES LEFT TO RUN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   Okay. That outta fix it. The foot has been warned. I'm sure it will be fine from here on out.

Bloggers are the shiznit.    shiznit: (def. from urbandictionary.com) adj. 1) the best; 2) the greatest, in a certain category or universally; 3) gaddam' phenomenal, bi-atch!   Yesterday I had  urlLink Bill  pointing readers in my direction and telling them good things. Today it's  urlLink Kim . (If I knew anything about the trackback feature, I'd be taking advantage of it, gang)... What did I do to deserve such lovely friends in cyberspace?   Thank you.

        Can someone please tell me    why  I'm  more nervous about this trip than Keli is? She seems cool as a cucumber. She just skipped out the door to go hang at her friend's house and watch tv for a few hours. She's going to 'pack when she gets home'. I'm nervous enough for the both of us I guess.   It's more excitement than nerves, though.   And she's always been one to play her stress pretty close to her heart. That's why she gets to hang out with a chiropractor once in a while. She holds her nerves in her back. So Di, if she gets a back ache while she's there, you'll know why!   You all are going to have the   best   time!

        It's a Beautiful Day...    Wow. Blue skies and the temps are climbing. The forecast says it should be near 70 today. I can handle that. Got some errand running to do so I thought I would get my run out of the way earlier than usual...   Today's miles:  4.5  Total so far:  410.36  Still to go for goal:  89.64  Wow. The numbers are dropping so fast! I can almost see Nowhere, Hutch... It's a little hazy with all this near-sightedness and my old contacts, but... I wonder what it will look like?

        Countdown to Japan...    My baby is flying to the other side of the earth in just a day and a half. Without me. It isn't the first time she's been off for an extended vacation without me. And she's growing up and will someday in the not-too-distant-future leave the nest for college and the great beyond. But Japan! Lucky little tyke.   Okay. Let's face it. I'm jealous. And filled with gratitude for this opportunity provided for her by my cousin and her husband. Kel is totally fortunate. She knows it and her dad and I know it. We're all very thankful for it.   Now if we can just get her ready for it in time! Rushing out the door for last-minute shopping experience with grandma...

        Thank you...    Bloggers are some of the nicest people on earth, as demonstrated by  urlLink Bill . Thank you, Bill. I shed some fat tears of gratitude reading your blog this morning. You and your family are good people. You make my running so much easier. You and my folks' and Hutch and her kids and that list of people over on the right of my blog, and the Kathies, and Marge and  urlLink Marn , and all of my regular posters who make it so much easier to update here every day, and Kel who gives me some of my best material to post about, and of course my husband without whom I never would have gotten this whole thing started because I may never have gotten involved in the Relay in the first place.   Thank you. Thanks for donating. Thanks for your words of support. Cheering me on helps me immensely. I don't have a lot of time to go read up on what's happening in a lot of your lives, so when you come here and give me your words of encouragement, you can't imagine what it does for me. But you can see the numbers! Bloggers, I ran for you today.   Thank you...   Today's miles:  5.25  Total so far:  401.46  Still to go for goal:  98.54  Adding another duck to my progress chart!

      Yep. Daylight savings time. Gotta love it. Lost an hour. One hour I could have been running. Or sleeping. Or laughing. Or eating. Or whatever.   For me I guess sleep is most important. I hate losing out on sleep. So yeah, I guess I lost out on sleep. That's the hour that disappears anyway since the big change happens at 2 am. Kel can attest to that. She was online at two. She was chatting with friends and suddenly noticed it was after three. She realized she had totally missed out on the two o'clock hour but Spense assured her that it hadn't really happened so it was okay. It was just DST. She was relieved. And yes, she slept until after 1 this afternoon.  She and Keith really rocked on the Algebra II this weekend. They finished six days worth in just a few hours. He taught her the concepts and sat with her while she did the homework. She's now finished with her homework for the Japan trip with the exception of some reading of novels and the journal that she has to write during/about the travels. With 20 hours on the plane, the reading should get done in flight, hopefully.   To all of you spring breakers here in RF - have a safe and happy vacation!   Well, since I lost out on that sleep last night, I guess I'll go grab a bit now. Kel's down cleaning her room so I don't think she'll be getting any very soon. She has laundry to accomplish for the trip so I think I'll hear the washer going in the wee hours once she has gathered things together...  Here are today's stats toward my 500 miles to nowhere. Just to say thanks once again for all of the support, the sponsorships are still coming in the mail - I'm so grateful for your generosity... THANK YOU!!!!!!!  I ran again today for Mary M... This was her weekend!   Today's miles:  4.25  Total so far:  396.21  Still to go for goal:  103.79  No reason I shouldn't be under 100 miles after tomorrow! Should be reason for celebration!

      I didn't go far... I'm not feeling tip top yet and jogging the body around just isn't what I'm up for yet. I did a slow walk. Very slow. As a result it didn't get me very far, but I had to start putting the miles back on. So here's how I did. Gulp.   Today's miles:  2.5  Total so far:  440.5  Still to go for goal:  59.5  I know what you're thinking. I'm thinking the same thing. But don't sweat it. I can still do it. Thirteen days is a long time. We all wanted this to be a fight to the finish, didn't we? I know I did!   Going to bed now.   Moving for Elsie tomorrow. Didn't know she was a survivor. Glad to know she is. (in rereads this sounds a little strange - not surprised to know she is because she IS survivor like... does that make sense? I hope so...) You go girl! :-)   Oh, before I go...   Heard from my lovely daughter tonight. She says  everyone  in Tokyo has adorable shoes.   So she bought some. Like mother, like daughter (like grandmother should be in there, too...)!   I love that child and look forward to seeing her. She's sounding under the weather. And her back is bothering her. Sounds like I should contact her fabbo chiropractor now and get her set up for an appointment toward the end of the week. I think she's going to need it. I can't wait for the big hug I'm going to get at the airport on Monday!

        I'm back. Sort of.    Still in some pain both behind my right eye (migraine) and in the abs (food allergy???) but I  will  put some miles behind me today.   Mum and Jan and I went shopping on Thursday. We had many laughs and I may have found some new running shoes (thanks Mum!). I'll know more when I try on a different size this next week.   I learned from Jan that according to an interior decorator she knows, you must have at least one wall in your house painted with your favorite color. I'm lucky enough to have two  rooms  in my house painted in the coolest shade of green with white trim. My whole mood changes (improves) when I walk into them. Her decorator is right!   Did you know that when you are standing in the vicinity of a turkey vulture's nest (aka too close for comfort), they may decide to circle overhead so close that they break branches off the tree tops above you and you can hear them swooping through the air with their gigantic wingspan? A little something Keith and I learned on one of our spring walks.   I'll be back later with my miles for the day.   I'm planning to steal  urlLink Marn's  idea when the Relay arrives and write names on my T-shirt for anyone you would like remembered who fought the battle with cancer. If you would please send me their names in my comments section, I will happily begin compiling a list of those names so that when I get my t-shirt I can begin to get the names on it. Obviously, all those names on the right for whom I have run so far will go on it, but I know there are names I haven't heard yet. Send them on, please!

      I do not know what my dog managed to find that was edible during his adventures outside the dog run, but he sure is gassy now...    + + + + +   Also, Alta updated the comments down in the "Winding Down" post with a great idea for the finale' of my run... I think we should go with that. Since nobody else came up with anything. Unless ya'll are still thinking. Anybody?    + + + + +   Today's miles for Dana!!!: 3.51 Total so far: 438 Still to go for goal: 62  I'm going to go do some writing now with paper and pens in my favorite coffee shop. Because I can. Because I don't have to take anybody anywhere. Or pick anyone up and wait for them. Mmmm. Coffee. Scones. I'll be back. But don't wait for me.   And tomorrow? Shopping. With the girls. And lunch! On Grand Avenue! Yeah!   + + + + +   But before I forget, I just wanted to let you all know, that Newman's Own Ginger'N Creme Ginger-O's are the best cookies in the world and you should all run right out and get some. They have a crunchy, zippy good ginger cookie sandwiched around a creamy sweet (and light!) filling (way better than the oreo filling you find these days).   Tell 'em Keri sent you! (I've always wanted to say that)  Besides, there's the added bonus of a handsome picture of Paul on the package looking quite sweet in a pair of bib-overalls and holding a pitchfork!     (No money has changed hands in the endorsement of this product. I just think they make a darned good cookie).

        Furry Critters    Today I'm putting in the miles for Dana at  urlLink Think Pink.  She's a survivor with a great story and she's all about cancer awareness and, more important,  life awareness  after cancer.  SURVIVAL!  Go pay her blog a visit and tell her I said hello!   While I was sitting here visiting blog sites and catching up on MSN with Keli and doing other various things online this morning, I saw a little furry critter moving down my driveway. My mind buzzed through a few billion bytes of data thinking about the various critters we've had in our forest during the past several years since we built the house... racoon? possum? fox? woodchuck? ... as I moved my chair around into position so I could look out the window to see what it really was.   BEAR!   No, not that kind of bear.  My dog, Bear. Slowly sniffing his way down the driveway in a relaxed, "Oh yeah, I'm free and I've been this way for hours" kind of way.   I jumped out of the chair and ran for the front door. I ran out onto the front step and said, "Hey Bear! Do you want a marshmallow?"  These are his very favorite treat. He sprang into action and ran pell-mell toward me and into the house, straight to the kitchen and the cabinet where the marshmallows are kept. I gave him one and said, "Wow. I guess the holes you have been digging in your dog run have gotten really deep, eh?" thinking he must have escaped by digging under the fence, to which we added an eight or ten inch wire fence down into the ground to prevent this type of thing from happening! He looked up at me happily, hoping for more treats and I told him to stay.  I went out into the mudroom, shutting the door behind me, slipping on a pair of sandals. I headed into the garage and then to the dog run... the holes looked about the same, certainly no deeper and they didn't appear to be deep enough to go under the fence. I glanced to the far end of the run and the gate at that end was standing wide open.   Again.   This happened once in the middle of winter.   I think my dog has developed opposable thumbs and the ability to stretch four feet in the air so that he can reach up and unlatch the gate. Or someone is coming in the night and opening it to let him out. Someone who doesn't like it when he barks all night perhaps?   It's beginning to freak me out.   Hey Kent, could it be your flag culprit? My brother has a bandit who stole his American flag off the side of his house some weeks back. Today someone stuck a tiny little flag on a stick in its place. Are they out to get us?   And now, the dog who kept me awake much of the night is lying here on his side sleeping so hard that he's snoring. And has been for over an hour. Spawn of Satan.

        Yes Virginia, there IS such a thing as too much fresh air.    Especially for a girl with allergies. Well, maybe not too much fresh air, but too much dust, mold, leaf bits, grass bits...  something  got kicked up yesterday during my time with Hutch. We spent a few hours yesterday at a park having a picnic and chatting in the sunshine. The entire time we were there, a very industrious woman rode around on a lawn tractor mulching up leaves and cleaning up the park. When she was finished it looked fantastic but the entire time, there were little bits of leaf and dust swirling through the air on the wind blowing right at us and we were breathing it in the whole time.   By the time I got home last night, after the rest of my day's tasks, which included picking up frozen food at the high school that Kel sold during a band fund-raiser, delivering that to the people who had purchased it, stopping last at my folks' house with their food and asking mom if she wanted to put on some miles with me as I hadn't done my run yet. She did, so we set out together and did the four plus miles. There was a little MORE fresh air and pollen my body didn't need. I probably should have gone home and run on Lurch instead. Afterward, we had a little bite to eat there before I went home and collapsed into bed. I had a project with a pen and some paper to work on then (if you're wondering Hutch, it involves sitting on the dock at the cabin - remember our cabin? - peeling the skin off my mom's back after a sunburn... and a turtle who's been run over by a car... I digress) but couldn't give it much concentration as my head was beginning to pound.  The pounding raged all through the night. My dog didn't help much. He refused to come in and go to bed, so I left him out there, but then he barked incessently throughout the night. I would go get him thinking he wanted to come in, which he would, just long enough for me to fall asleep, and then he'd insist on going back out again. I don't know what his problem was. I guess his wolf ancestry or something was kicking up. He goes through a night or week of this every spring. Devil Dog - hound of hell. I've taken my claritin now. I'm hoping it helps. Soon. My eyes hurt - sure sign that the sinuses are hurting...   WOW! The pileated woodpecker is right here at my window! I love to see this bird - so prehistoric looking. But I hate seeing it on a tree so close. Hope he isn't trying to tell me this tree is dead. Good. He didn't stay or even peck at the tree at all. He moved on to another tree. But he came flying right at the house before he did. I was afraid he'd hit a window before he did. What a mythical looking creature!   Our crocuses are blooming after the warm temps this week. We're supposed to have 70 today. And with the pounding in my head I won't feel much like running. A nice walk perhaps to get the miles, though. Hope you all have a great Wednesday.

        Because it shouldn't be hidden in the comments... (Keith's Story)    Here's a conversation that happened 3 years ago today:   It was a Friday the 13th at exactly 2:34pm. The phone rang. I ran from the shower to the phone in the kitchen.   The voice on the phone said, "Is this Mr. K_ K_ ?"  I was annoyed. I figured it was a telemarketer who had just gotten me out of the shower. Ready to hang up, I answered, "Yes."   "This is Dr. S_ from Dr. O_'s office - the neurology clinic."  Hmm. I wasn't expecting a call from them. I wondered what was up.    Dr. S_ :   "I have been trying to reach you on your cell phone and work phone."  Me:  "I had the day off."   Dr. S_ :  "Your neurologist, Dr. O_ is on vacation today. But, I thought I had better not wait until he got back. I thought I had better call you today."  Me:  "Oh, okay, thanks."  Dr. S_:  "You just had an MRI of your head, right?"  Me:  "Yep."  Dr. S_:  "I'm sorry to have to tell you this, but the MRI of your brain was abnormal."  Me:  "Oh"  Dr. S_:  "We see something that appears to be a lesion of some sort. Could be an old injury. But, could be a brain tumor."  Me:  "Oh"  Dr. S_:  "We need to get a better look with a more detailed MRI and with dye. I've already set up the appointment for the MRI. It's 10:00 Monday morning. Do whatever you need to be there."  Me:  "Okay."  Dr. S_:  "If this is a tumor, we should be able to get it."  Me:  "That's good."  Dr. S_:  "In that location it is very likely causing seizures. Tell me your pharmacy name. I want to call in a prescription for an anti-epilepsy medication. I want you to start taking them right away."   Me:  "Okay."  Dr. S_:  "On the good side, it looks like we found the cause of your symptoms."  Me:  "Yep."  Dr. S_:  "We'll call you in the middle of next week with the results of Monday's MRI. Please make sure you get to that."  Me:  "Okay."  Keri and I had been raking leaves all day. I walked out on the front step where Keri was still raking leaves. I called to her. She put down her rake and came to me. I began to cry. I could barely tell her. "The doctor called. They say I might have a brain tumor." We held each other and cried.   Later, we spent more time silently raking together. That memory of raking together, lost in deep thought and deep hoping is so vivid. We knew that life was maybe about to change. I wondered if I would ever see another Spring.   That was 3 years ago today. What an amazing 3 years. What a roller coaster ride. The surgery, the recovery, the doubts, the medical foibles and medical heroes. I don't think we'll ever be quite the same.   And, it lingers on. It wasn't until just a couple of weeks ago that we got the final word on the pathology. They said that it was extremely hard to classify, but they thought it most likely a "Grade 2 Astrocytoma" - fairly wimpy on the malignancy scale. My current doctor said my situation lacks enough studies to have final answers on how best to treat this. He said that the lack of research leads to doctors having to base treatment more on gut feel than on scientific evidence. I'm glad we have the gut feel of such an incredibly good doctor working in our favor. He said that some doctors would recommend brain radiation now. But, he recommends that we save this "in our toolkit" to be used in case of a recurrence - since the brain can only be radiated once in a lifetime. And, he said that in my case he gives it about an 80% chance that I would permanently lose all ability to turn short term memory into long term memory, if I have the radiation.   3 years later, I have 15-20% less brains. But, aside from the continuing episodes that the doctors say is mild epilepsy, I'm doing really well 3 years later, all considered. Driving is a problem. But, I can work. And, I can be with my family. I can remember my family and recognize them. I have my hearing so I can hear the wind and the birds in our forest. I can think enough to help my daughter with her math homework. I have my sight so I can see a sunset, and maybe better understand the value of sharing it, sitting next to my wife.   I remember a doctor telling me after the diagnosis that I was really fortunate that this was happening to me then, and not 10 years earlier. He said that technology had advanced tremendously in that 10 years, giving me a much better chance.   So, things are progressing in the area of cancer and brain tumor treatments.   I know everyone has a story. This is my story for this day. And, I guess all I can say is "Thanks for supporting efforts to continue the progress." And, "Thank you, my wife, for this run."   And, thank you, thank you, thank you for all the support, prayers and well-wishes from family and friends.

      Have you ever left anything in a public restroom intentionally or unintentionally that would have been thought unusual had it been found or didn't belong there?    (I know, this is worded weird. I could have said, did you ever forget anything or lose anything but sometimes you leave things there on purpose! This way I'm hitting both sides of the coin).   My answers:  1) Many moons ago, before I even met Keith, I went to a company Christmas party just for the division I was in - a pretty nice ritzy affair. I went out and bought a fancy black velvet dress, stockings, pumps, purse - the whole nine yards. I had a sitter for Kel for the night, a hot date also in the division, and I "borrowed" a ring from Mom, only she didn't know it because she was off on a fancy trip with a bunch of friends and couldn't be reached. It was a little gold ring with three little diamonds in it. She had it for a pinky ring, but it was a little too big for that for me. However, it was too small for me to wear on my ring finger, so I also had to wear it on my pinky.   During the course of the evening, eating hors d'oeuvres and drinking the bottles of wine that were just sitting around on all of the tables and dancing every dance, requesting all my favorite songs like  Unchained Melody  by The Righteous Brothers (most romantic song of all time - don't argue), I may have gotten a little tipsy. At one point, I wandered into the ladies room, did what all ladies do after drinking beverages, and then I washed my hands, dried them and threw the paper towel into the trash can. It wasn't until halfway through the next day at work that I realized I no longer had my mom's ring. So I called the hotel where we'd had the party, told them my dilemma and they alerted the housekeeping staff, who was at that moment, cleaning the ladies room.   The delightful young woman cleaning the ladies room had not yet emptied the large trash can, and she took out each towel, uncrumpled it, and searched for the ring, working her way through it until she found it. Wasn't that lucky?    Upon further remembrance...  Phew! What a stressful day that was! I've been thinking about the drive over to the hotel during my lunch break with my date to see if they had found it because I didn't know yet and how totally freaked out I was...  (mom is gonna shoot me... mom is gonna shoot me...)  and then the total relief that she had not only been kind enough to look through the trash for it but that she had found it and was honest enough to turn it in.  (WOW! Mom doesn't ever have to know that I lost it or even that I wore it in the  FIRST  place! Yippee!!!) ...    pssst, dad - she hasn't been reading much lately... she doesn't have to know a thing about this little story, right?   RIGHT???  heh heh heh... just our little secret...    I'll tell my other story later. I do have another. Yepper. First I wanna hear yours, though.   I'm waiting!

        Another Week Begins...    Hope everyone had a good weekend. Ours went quickly. The first without Kel around and without the extra dashing about to take her to this party or that movie and it still went by fast.    We enjoyed brunch in Red Wing. We had many laughs, took a family portrait (minus six missing family members), ate too much food, saw some people we knew which surprised us considering we were several miles from home, (I saw my first boss at the corporate IT job I had in St. Paul - that was a big surprise - and he even remembered me), and then we dashed back home for a nice Sunday afternoon before getting Keith back to his apartment. On the way we made a pit stop at Dunn Bros. and enjoyed a plate of vegies and dip before indulging in a mocha brownie and some coffee. Yum.  Once at the apartment I spent a bit of time assembling his new vacuum cleaner, following directions and putting all of the pieces together. There were no spare parts or missing pieces. It was great. And it even ran right once it was finished. Afterwards there was no rush to get Kel back home to finish homework so I stayed there and watched the sunset over the lake with him and we laughed at our silly jokes for a while. I took off when I could no longer see the sun. I planned to run when I got home, but decided instead to go to bed early.  I think I'll do two workouts today if I'm in the mood later to head to the old hometown and head to the school with mum. We'll see. That will make up for it, I figure.   Here's today's stats...   Monday's miles:  4.25  Total so far:  430.19  Still to go for goal:  69.81  Those miles are just moving down there! I'm liking it!  Got more photos and updates from the traveling kid today! I'm so jealous! They sound like they're having a great time...

      Tune in tomorrow night to America's Most Wanted (Saturday 4/24 - 8 pm Central but please check your listings for time and station). They will be highlighting a murder case that means a whole lot to me and all of the people in my little home town. We want to see it solved. You remember those families I ran for back in  urlLink February ? Danny was loved by everyone in the town. His funeral was the largest I know of in the town history. If everybody, everywhere watches this show, maybe somebody, somewhere will see something or hear something that will trigger some little memory of something they heard.   I don't know. It's a long shot.   All I'm asking is that you watch. And that you tell everybody you know to watch.   Fellow Bloggers? This would get even further if you would all put in a plug, too. You can link back to me for the explanation if you want. I'd so much appreciate it and owe you all a Blog it Forward or something.   Please. It would mean a whole lot to me. And everybody in my little hometown. And two families torn apart by a senseless murder still unsolved.   What's one more hour of television in the scheme of things. Most everybody watches television, right? I'm just asking that people do it with a purpose in mind.   Thanks.

      I haven't been a great communicator. I changed computers and didn't transfer my e-mails that had downloaded to the old over to the new and didn't end up replying to those e-mails. But that's a lousy excuse. As a result, we ended up missing out on communicating with one of the great BT warriors that we had the distinct pleasure to meet.   During the early fall of 2002, Keith and I attended the National Brain Tumor Foundation's Brain Tumor Conference in Denver. It was a great opportunity for us because he had family there so it was a chance to see them, plus there was this great conference there so a good time to get information and meet other BT survivors. And to top it all off, David Bailey was performing there besides! So it was all good.   Well, we flew out to Denver, and family met us at the airport and delivered us to our hotel. We got checked in and took the elevator up to our room, sharing it with another couple who were obviously also there for the conference. The husband was very tall and forbidding looking with his shaved head and walking stick. The wife was shorter and very friendly looking. We got off at different floors and found our rooms.   There was some preliminary stuff going on for meeting other conference goers which we skipped out on that first day because we just needed to rest up a bit, but finally we decided to wander down toward the conference to get our bearings and see what we could find. While we wandered down the hallway, we again bumped into the couple we'd seen in the elevator. Keith and I are pretty shy meeting people, but we did introduce ourselves and began searching for the conference rooms together.    I tell you, they couldn't have picked a worse venue for that particular conference. Take a bunch of people who've had surgery to their brains and are suffering from short term memory loss, have difficulty with map reading or following directions, and other such problems, and put them in a hotel where all of the conference rooms are spread out so you have to go down varying hallways, different sets of elevators, and even different buildings because the hotel has been added onto over the years! Luckily, these BT warriors also have a great sense of humor for the most part!   We met more people there with big open hearts full of love and laughter. As the conference went on, we got to know Tim and Sharon a little better. They were wonderfully open people. Tim was being treated for a stage IV GBM, the same tumor type as David Bailey. Those are the biggies, folks. They don't get any scarier than that. He was so funny and made you feel so comfortable and at ease talking with him. He was always threatening Sharon that he was going to have a tattoo put on his head to cover his scar. :) That just sounds darned painful to me.   As I said, I wasn't a great communicator. I e-mailed them after we got back from the conference. I heard back from Tim in January of last year and we exchanged a couple more e-mails that month. He sounded pretty good at that time but said he wanted to talk with us some more about things and that he hoped to hear from us soon.   I got an e-mail from Sharon today. You can imagine how I feel tonight hearing that Tim lost his battle in December. Our love is going out in waves to you, Sharon. I'm so glad you got in touch with us. We'll be lighting a luminaria on June 18 at our Relay in his honor. He'll be walking with us in spirit. We remember you both well.

I'll make it up - don't worry. I'm doing enough of that for all of us! Besides, the original goal  was  June 1st. There is still plenty of time for THAT!

        Damn.    The beast strikes again. One of my SIL's just learned that a friend of hers (she's had since birth!) has breast cancer. No details are really known yet. They found it during a routine mammogram. Keep Patty in your thoughts and prayers, please. She'll be having surgery next week. She'll be the focus of my run for the rest of the week. And you too, Di, because I know how worried you are.   I'm off to school to pick up Kel. I forgot to report that there was only minimal eye-rolling at the airport when I showed up with the giant butterfly balloon. I think Nat was doing more of it when she saw her Dad there with a baby wrapped in a blanket. While she was in Japan, her only sister had a baby a month early, so Dad thought he would be clever and fake her out with a Care Bear wrapped up at the airport. She had him pegged right away.   More later. I have much to do yet this afternoon. Including a five mile run!

Marge:  not a peep...  KinnicChick:  ...whistling...  Marge:  stares back unblinking...  KinnicChick:  (singing)...fly me to the moon ... and let me sail among the stars...   Marge:  Obviously unimpressed...  KinnicChick:  too bad girlie... you're missin' the whole dinner show tonight.   KinnicChick:  (Joe Cool smiley...)  Marge:  total quiet  One of these days she's going to shock the heck out of me and really be there. Waiting until just the moment I'm about to give up on her and sign off. Then she's going to pop out and scare the bejeebus out of me. Not tonight, though. Nope. Not tonight. Cuz pretty soon I'm going to give up and sign off.   Yep. Pretty soon.    KinnicChick:  Okay. I guess I'll be going then.  Marge:  silence  KinnicChick:  G'night.  Marge:  .........  KinnicChick:  Talk to you soon...  Marge:  nothin...  KinnicChick:  bye.  Yep.

        Distractions...    I haven't done one of these in a long time and I found this one over at  urlLink Krush's  place and thought it looked interesting. Curiosity got the best of me and I had to find out...     urlLink      urlLink Which Disney Princess are you?     Not a bad result for me at all!    Updated for Alta!  Kida is the Defender of the Empire! She's from Atlantis. I had no idea what you were talking about because I'd never seen this movie! I had to Google her! I'm still waiting to hear what Princess my Dad is most like, too! :)    + + + + +   Many thanks to  urlLink Bill  for again sending people my way from he and his wife's place yesterday! I totally appreciate the plug as I'm getting down toward the finish line on my run. I would like everyone to know that I'll be accepting donations for the Relay for Life right up until the relay, too! You can click on my donations button over there on the right and know that every penny you donate will go to the American Cancer Society. Thank you so much! It means a lot to us to be doing something after what we experienced with Keith and what we have seen since then in getting to know other cancer survivors and victims.    + + + + +   Today was  urlLink DoS  at Kel's school (well, nationwide actually but I just mean that her school also participated) for those who signed up to participate. She said it was pretty tough being quiet for so long!    + + + + +   Well, I've put off today's run for a while here, eh? Guess I'd best get to it. A very tired Kel is napping and I told her I'd wake her up around 6:30 for some dinner and to help her study. That gives me a little over an hour to lurch along on Lurch (my treadmill). I haven't picked up the final Matrix yet because I forgot the coupon. *sigh* Guess I'll have to watch something else.   I'll be back with mileage.   Thanks again Bill!

      Another gray and rainy day, but we need the moisture, so I won't complain. Kel was wide awake when the alarm went off and up and out to school on time for the bus. Guess she was happy to get back to her friends. I don't think tomorrow will go quite as well. She's exhausted and full of headache (and homework) tonight.   Finally watched The Matrix Reloaded today while I did the run and was so sucked into it that I broke my cardinal rule and even sat down and finished watching it after I finished the run. I usually only allow myself to movie while I'm running. I should have saved the end for tomorrow's run because I have no movies for tomorrow. I do, however, have a coupon for Mr. Movies - rent a new release and get a second movie free... Might be time to go rent the third Matrix now that the second is fresh in my mind!    Today's miles:  4.5  Total so far:  455  Still to go for goal:  45  Had a Relay meeting tonight. It's getting close! I'm getting excited!  Working on postcards to get out to the people who pledged per mile now that I'm within 50 miles to let them know I'm down to the wire and to be looking for a pledge envelope from me soon. Really soon. In just a couple of weeks. I'm bringing it home.

They may have been scary, but they were nothin' compared to the hail we had hittin' the house last night. Summer has arrived with gusto. And gustin winds!  I'm looking for those names to go on my shirt! Keep on sending 'em! I know you have battlers of cancer in your lives to tell the world about. Let me put their names on my shirt! Tell me about them in my comments, please! I will wear their names with pride! I'm compiling my list...   My kiddo comes home tomorrow. As always when she travels, she's coming home sick! Hurrah... This is one of my favorite shots of those sent from abroad... The Japanese school children constantly ran up and asked them if they could practice their English with them. Keli got to practice very  little  of her Japanese!

        Stormy Nights, Gorgeous Days...    We had quite the storm last night. It woke us up around 2. Thunder, lightning, and hail that hit the house and windows so hard, I was certain there would be damage to something. Some of the hail wasn't only the size of marbles, they were as big as  shooters!  But I went out in the lovely heat today and worked in the yard for a couple of hours while Keith soaked in his much-cooled hot tub (storms frequently trip the breaker to just the hot tub, and we frequently don't notice it until the temperature has dropped several degrees) and didn't notice any damage to any of my plants even. On an unrelated but thrilling springtime note, I did get to pull a deer tick off my shirt at one point.   Yesterday after my walk I wandered around the field looking at the growth in the pines we've planted and ended up pulling five wood ticks off of myself. They are definitely thick this year. The veterinarian told us it would be a banner year for them. He said he saw them earlier than he could ever remember seeing them before (February). I wondered after having five easy-to-spot wood ticks, how many deer ticks I must have, but I couldn't find any. They can be such hard little buggers to find, though. My dog  *Satanic creature*  loves to bring them as gifts and deposit them in the bed for us in the night. We sometimes find them the next day creeping toward us on the dark purple blanket.  If we're lucky enough to see them.   *devil dog*   Well, it's time to take Keith back to his apartment. I'll be back and post my mileage later. Hope you're all having an enjoyable Sunday.

      I Made it!  Today's Miles: 5.4 Miles So Far: 501.03 Still to go for goal: (1.03)  Keli ran with me today. It was a beautiful day for it, although I did moan a bit about the cold wind until we really got going. She gave me many kudos for how far I've come because she hasn't run with me for a long time and my conditioning has changed considerably since then.   This is us coming down our road on the way in.     yep. here we are running down the road. can you picture it?    When I got back to our road I had tears streaming down my face because, let's face it... I never imagined back in November what a trip this was going to be. I believed I could do it (sort of). I thought the time frame was doable. I hoped I would hear from people giving me names of people to run for to help inspire me, and as you can see from the list at the right, there was a lot of inspiration. Damn cancer.   Here I am at the finish line Keith had waiting for me when I got back. :) Kel wouldn't cross it with me. I insisted but she wouldn't do it. "It's  your  500 miles, Mum." And blasting from the car stereo as I came across the finish line he was playing David Bailey... My favorite CD - Coffee with the Angels. Go out to  urlLink CD Baby  and buy it. Now. It's good stuff.     Hey! Look how much energy I have after 5 miles!    And the medal he "made" me...     Isn't it cool? It says "Survivor of 500 miles!"    Now I get to return! And I shall. 500 miles. But first I'm going to take about a week and simply walk. And nurse the achilles in both legs. Ice. Lots of it.   And I'm going to blog that return. And I hope you'll join me. Because I'll miss you if you don't.   Listening to:  Vangelis - Chariots of Fire  of course...

      Heard from my sister-in-law today that her friend Patty had her surgery... As it turns out, they were able to get all of Patty's cancer without having to do a mastectomy, found NO cancer in the lymph nodes and will NOT have to do chemo! She'll still have to go through radiation, and has just been through surgery, of course, but all of this is very good news!   Very wonderful to hear! So glad they caught this in such early stages! Thank you for keeping her in your thoughts and prayers through her radiation and recovery!

Spent some time with a long-time friend today. It's been far too long but it was delightful to see her. I dropped by her workplace on a whim and she happened to be there and spent over an hour with me. Good to see you, Pooh! Let's do it again soon. And next time let's not wait so long. Now that you're running, perhaps we could run together sometime. Of course, I'm awfully slow, I doubt I could keep up with you.   Hope you are all having a good day and have a terrific weekend. May it be a nice day tomorrow for the finish of the run. It would be cool to finish outside.

        On the road again...    I've said this before but running outside is nothing like running on a treadmill. There are the obvious things to deal with like the hills and the rocks, the traffic, the people and the bugs, the weather and the pounding on the very hard pavement. But the things I've missed out on doing all those miles on Lurch too!    The anticipation the first couple of miles going today's route, wondering if I'll maybe get a glimpse of Sam Shepard out working on the fence or checking on his cattle at his writing studio, or maybe just driving away in his pickup truck (no, I'm not a scary stalker fan, I've never asked for an autograph or honked or go out of my way to drive by or anything, just enjoy the occasional accidental glimpse)...     The happy surprise realizing the family with the scary old malamute have moved out of the old farmhouse so I won't be chased by THAT old dog anymore...     The sound of the water rushing in the Kinni at this time of the year and the splash of the occassional trout when I stop on the bridge to stretch...     The croaking of the frogs in the swampy area at the second bridge where the creek runoff is particularly high...    The honking of the pair of geese that are scared off when I run over the third bridge...     Stretching my legs and really being able to  run!  You just can't do that on a treadmill without preplanning and getting the speed just right and everything coordinated just so...    The weather! (yes, I know I mentioned that as a negative, also - you understand, I'm a Wisconsinite and I've been stuck in winter for  months!  It's 85 degrees and SUNNY here today... gorgeous!)...     There is this jingling sound just past the farmhouse where the crabby old dog used to live on the opposite side of the road on a windy day... It sounds like the most beautiful windchimes you can imagine. I believe it is an old barbed wire fence that is now cut apart and rolled up and just hanging there blowing around in the wind. It sounds magical.    The birds!...    I still have to go  how far  to get back home???    Thanks for my new running shoes mom and dad! They are really comfortable. I probably should have broken them in a little slower than taking them straight out and pounding the pavement for 5 miles, but the road was calling me today. It was fun!    Calling all fellow runners (are there some of you lurking?)...  What do you do to break in new running shoes? Especially shoes that are a totally different brand and type than you have ever worn before?  Today's miles: 5.2 Total so far: 489.06 Still to go for goal: 10.94  Going to get the kid from school now. Guess that means I'm finished with the computer for the day. Or until around 11 pm at least.

      I did better than I thought I would today...   Today's miles:  5.39  Total so far:  483.86  Still to go for goal:  16.14  Whoa. That doesn't leave much!   Tomorrow Mum and I are going to pick up those new running shoes. Guess I'll be running back from Nowhere during the remainder of the year to complete that thousand! :) Of course! I knew that. The real question is, will I blog it, and will anyone care?   Party was much fun tonight, therefore, a big success. Now to get some sleep because we're exhausted. No homework getting accomplished, but it's final quarter. Who accomplishes that anyway? Just kidding. I'm going to help her get some of that done before we crash. Must go.  And how do I begin to thank all of you who are donating to this cause? You are so generous and kind. Together we will make a difference and a cure will be found! I can feel it. Someday soon...

      Well, what will I do when it's over???   Today's miles:  2.6  Total so far:  478.47  Still to go for goal:  21.53  It was a very busy day today... I had to go to town and partake in my annual physical (fun fun...) and even though it's a year early, my doc and I decided that I would have my baseline mammogram this year so I'll get to have that in June (first available appointment). My blood pressure was still super low even with the bp lowering meds cut in half at that last appointment, so that was great news. We're watching for a little while longer and I may get off them altogether in the next couple of months.   After that appointment I had mailings to do for the people who have pledged per mile to update them on how things are going and a post office trip to make. Then I had to get to the school to pick up Kel and Lauren and take them to the florist for an errand they needed to run. From there it was home to do some serious prep work for a party Kel is having tomorrow night so it just wasn't your five-mile-run kind of night!  And tomorrow is party night, so I think tomorrow is going to be a short one, too...   Besides, I just don't want to see this end! It's the journey, not the destination, after all.   And as Keith says, what am I going to do when I get to Nowhere, and how am I going to get back???

      And it'll be quick because I never get the computer anymore!    Patty's Sunday Miles:  6.84  Total so far:  475.87  Still to go for goal:  24.13  Keli's concert last night was wonderful. I still haven't seen AMW from last night, though. Hope they get some action on the case from it. Thanks to everyone who watched it. I'm hoping to get a look at it tomorrow.   Thanks to  urlLink Robert  for promoting it! And thanks for  urlLink Mark  and  urlLink Busy Mom  and the  urlLink Pondering Princess  for letting me take over little bits of their blogs to promote it myself! :) Ya'll are special people! Now Robert, since you figured out that whole Trackback thing, you know you're going to have to teach me how one of these days...   Hope everybody had a great weekend.

      Well, my memory post went over well, as Mark so kindly pointed out for me. Thanks pal. :-P Guess people are loving the new look of my boring blog or something.   Anyway, been working on the gardening and yard around here. I think it's looking better than it has in a couple of years. I'd been ignoring the foundation plantings and they've been getting away from me. Even got the birdhouses out. The squirrels are thrilled.   Going to start up with the running again today. A week is a long enough hiatus. I can't stand  not  running anymore. By the looks of the wind, though, it will be with Lurch. Besides, with the great speakers now hooked up to the movie projector (thanks Dad!), I've got to go experience a movie and what better way than while I run?  The  urlLink David Bailey  concert last night was great, as always. He played a little new, a lot of old, and mixed in some of his typical David humor. Keith got to talk to him afterward for a bit, which was really terrific. David also had a special guest who will now be another of our favorite musicians, I think. His name is Michael Billet and he plays "Impressionistic acoustic guitar". It was beautiful. He is a survivor of cancer also - a tumor which was removed from his neck. Surgery and radiation took care of it, but seven years later it returned. "Another surgery saved his life but left him unable to speak... except through his guitars."   Okay. Off to the garden. Back later to post the running miles.

      Seen several places now around the blogosphere... But seen  first  at  urlLink Busy Mom's . Please feel free to give it a whirl whether you are a blogger or not, because I know that many of my readers aren't...   Invent a memory of me and post it in the comments. It can be anything you want, so long as it's something that's  never  happened.   If you are a blogger: Then post this in your journal so that people can invent memories for you. (I consider the last bit optional if you’d rather not use it in your own blog.)

      Okay. It looks a little milk toast around here, but we'll all get used to it. Right? Sorry about that. Here's a list of the changes... bulleted in Stacey's honor. Because I lurrrrrvs my  urlLink Stacey . And she's just having a rough week. Go give her some luvin.    First off, and most obvious, no pictures. I've explained all that already. Wrists slapped. I haven't had time to go through the archives and disconnect all of the links. I will. Don't worry. Because I've done wrong. Didn't know it at the time. Would have if I'd thought about it for five blinking minutes. But I didn't. Not really. So I'll get that done. Soon. Before the AF police come and take me away, I hope.     My links to other blogs and important sites are now at the bottom of the blog. Please don't forget to scroll down when you are finished reading the newest post and visit those blogs and sites. Because they are good people and good sites. And I'm not smart enough to figure out how to skinny down these posts and get them up here on the sidelines where they are visible and where you'll see them and remember to click on them easily and frequently.     The names of the incredible survivors and the people who I'm running in honor of are now also at the bottom of the page. Please remember to scroll down and have a look at them, too. Because they are what keep me going. Every day. Okay, not for the past week, but I'm resting my all-important Achilles. Mark says I'm in big trouble if I lose them. So I'm listening to him. So scroll, people! Scroll!    My progress chart (remember that?) of the rubber ducks and all is now at the bottom of the page. I think you know the routine by now... I'm going to need just as much cheering on the return 500 miles as I needed on the out-going 500. I hope you'll all be here to do that.     Hey! It's Thursday! Time for a stupid question! I think I'll toss one in right now...  From the book  If... Questions for the Game of Life      If you could have directed any film in history, what movie would it be?      The archives are now at the bottom of the blog. Same routine, different day.     The button for donating to my Relay for Life efforts has moved from on the right side of the blog to the top left. There is still plenty of time to make a donation! ALL proceeds go to the American Cancer Society. Let's help beat the cancer bastard right into the ground.     I'm still looking for more names to add to my inspiration lists. Bring 'em on. Those names are going on my T-shirt for the Relay, too. I can't wait! I'm going to be taking photos. But now I won't be able to put them on my blog. Maybe I can get one of my blogging friends who actually pays for their own site to put the photos up... :) cheap cheap... LOL!!!    Was there anything else on the old blog that I'm forgetting about? I can't think of anything right off the top. Oh yeah. I remember. That great Relay for Life logo is missing. So just pretend I still have it. It's now at the top of the blog - top right of the page. Right up there next to the blogger ad stuff. There is a nice blank square just screaming for it.   Okay. Have a great night all. I have more blog fixes to make. Mistakes to correct. Major oops. And a letter to get out to some fabbo people who pledged some money per mile to let them know I made it!!! Whooo hooo! Big-hearted people are the bestest... I know a lot of them... Thanks ya'll.

      Had a fun day yesterday. My old Gray Street pal from our diaper days, Cari, took me out for my birthday (yes, we really have been that busy - it was in January). We went to lunch at Sidney's (mmmmm, Sidney's), and then we went to see  urlLink  Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind  . I'd have to agree with the people who said it was Jim Carrey's finest work of acting... A complete departure from the usual stuff he's in and none of his slapstick. It is going to stay with me for a while. One of those movies I'll think about for a long time and will see again on video when Keli rents it because I'll want a second peek to review certain things about it.   It was a beautiful day, too. The sun was incredible, the sky was that deep cerulean blue. And then there is today. Dave Dahl gave his skymax forecast and predicted rain moving in around noon. When Dad called to come out and see if we could get the tractor started (we've had to jump start it the past three times in a row now), I told him the prediction and we agreed that we'd have nearly three hours before then, and Dad didn't believe it anyway. We had to jump it again, and the rain was falling by 12:15. It was amazing. It's been chilly, too. But Dave says that the rain would be a pre-cursor to a heat wave. By 2 pm we're supposed to have 82 degrees. Dad doubts that one, too. After that rain, though, I'm wondering if my money shouldn't be on Dave... we'll see.   I'm going to do some laundry now (darn it if the sun isn't trying to poke through the clouds) before I have to head to town to get the kid.   I'm thinking ya'll need a new pic of the poor puppy, too. He's really pathetic today. He wouldn't stop trying to chew the bandage off last night, so I stuck a sock on him. He's not pleased. Oh the humiliation...     Image snatched by the angelfire police - and rightfully so... I was unrightfully linking to it but didn't know that wasn't allowed. I am ashamed!

      Poor Bear. This is a dog who has  always  been susceptible to choking/coughing fits. Trying to walk him on leash was always impossible because he strained at the leash causing himself absolute fits choking himself. Putting him on a body harness which became a total necessity (because as you look at him you can see that his neck/rough is much thicker than his head, so he can just back out of any collar now) but not much better for walking him because he still strains at them too much and manages to somehow choke himself.  Well, having a tube down his throat for the procedure and teeth cleaning yesterday was a bit much. He is sleeping soundly beside me now, but most of the night consisted of his getting up and having a choking/coughing fit, sounding like he was going to cough up the contents of his stomach (which wasn't much as he was restricted), my trying to convince him to drink some water or eat some ice chips (which he refused), and his settling back down and fitfully falling back asleep with these little coughing fits that were like little hiccups... Kel moaning and groaning beside me because she had decided to sleep upstairs by the injured little puppy. Around 4:50 am, about five minutes after I whispered, "You should really go back to your room and try to get a little more sleep." Kel threw back the covers and said, "I'm sorry, but I'm never going to make it if I don't go back to my room and get some sleep!" And she left. I wonder how many times she'll fall asleep in class today?  Amazing how easily he is sleeping now. Hope this is a sign that he is recovering. He ate breakfast okay and finally drank some water. Maybe that helped.   Poor puppy.

      Doesn't he look pathetic?     Imagine poor puppy looking pathetic. Image snatched by angelfire police. Sorry...    I just thought it was funny that he was wearing a little pink cast much the same as the one I wore in Colorado when I broke the bone in my ankle many years ago. I think mine was on the right side, though.   Poor baby...

      I'll be doing a run for  urlLink Krush's  sorority sister who just found out she has cancer. She'll find out next week how things look, but I told K that I'd do a run for her as soon as I start running again after I rest my achilles for a couple more days.   And that goes for anybody else, too. My return from Nowhere will be dedicated in honor of those who did not survive, but when I hear about new cancer fighters, I'm definitely going to dedicate runs that direction, too, so please let me hear about them!   Took my little Bear  (Spawn of Satan)  to the veterinarian today and had to hold him while they gave him the anesthesia to knock him out for some minor surgery (they say with a nine-year-old dog no surgery is minor, though). Poor baby. He just went limp and I helped him slide down onto the table and had to stay there with him while they put the tube down his throat and put him on oxygen.   And I didn't even pass out!  I'll get to pick him up after I pick up Kel from school so she can help me carry him on the way home. Poor little puppy. He gave the doc and the assistant some nasty spitting growls and showed his teeth while they took blood for the pre-surgical screening and then while he got shaved and had his anesthesia shot. He's crabby at the vet. And very stressed. He quaked in my arms for about 20 minutes prior to getting in for his appointment.    Better go try and get those Japan pictures printed out. The first place I tried was unsuccessful. Let's hope the next has more luck. It's a beautiful but windy day.  David Bailey is in town this week. Who's with us?     Feel free to go check out  urlLink David's website  where you can find photos of him there since you can no longer find photos of him here! ;) He'll be thrilled by your visit!    Marge is depressed because she can't make it this year. We're bummed too, Marge. We'll miss you.

      I've decided that on the return from Nowhere, I'll be running to honor the memory of those who did not survive.   Please send me the names and any memories you'd like me to post as well. I'll start with the names of those who dropped down my survivor list, then I'll move on to the names already sent me for my Relay shirt and continue on with names kindly sent by all of you. I'm making my list and checking it twice.   Send me my inspiration.   I now return to icing the achilles and resting for a bit. Thanks for all your support and love and generosity. Keep those donations coming to the American Cancer Society. Taking donations right up through the Relay in mid-June! Together we can make a difference to stamp out this beast. All donations go directly to ACS to help find a cure.

      I wasn't going to post the results of what book I am because I hate to just do these rather than writing all sorts of brilliant things to impress you all with, but this stuff was just hitting too close. I made Keith take the What Book are You and What Country are You tests... here are his results first, followed by my own book.        You're  Les Miserables !   by Victor Hugo     One of the best known people in your community, you have become something of a phenomenon. People have sung about you, danced in your honor, created all manner of art in your name. And yet your story is one of failure and despair, with a few brief exceptions. A hopeless romantic, you'll never stop hoping that more good will come from your failings than is ever possible. Beware detectives and prison guards bearing vendettas.      Take the  urlLink Book Quiz  at the  urlLink Blue Pyramid .     Okay. Even more frightening??? Here's what country Keith is... He's still walking around muttering "That is WEIRD!"         You're Bosnia-Herzegovina!      You've just been through a big tragedy. &nbsp;You weren't sure you were going to make it at all. &nbsp;Now that you have, there's a lot to pick back up in your life, and not enough people are helping you. &nbsp;You just wanted a little more freedom, a chance to be away from those who thought poorly of you. &nbsp;Now it's time to build up some confidence, and it looks like you have a good chance at that. &nbsp;But you'll need a lot of therapy.   Take the  urlLink Country Quiz  at the  urlLink Blue Pyramid .        And finally, my book results...       You're  "Master Harold"... and the Boys !   by Athol Fugard     Even though you should have realized it for years, you're only just starting to understand how bad your society is. It's been keeping some of your best friends down for ages, and even you have been complicit with this system. When you make a mess, someone else is quick to clean it. When you need help, someone else is quick to your rescue. But when they point out injustice, you've pulled the wool over your eyes. Until now. If you ever need a cast, it will be small.

      Running today for another new addition to the survivors list, Michael Billet. He was the special musical guest at the David Bailey concert the other night and he was fantastic... I spoke about him in my post about the concert  urlLink here.    Today's miles: 5.25   Total so far: 20.53   Still to go for goal: 479.47   Another rainy, gloomy day in Nowhere land. Hope I get back sooner than later at this rate. We have low forties for temps today. Watched   urlLink Poolhall Junkies   last night. Not enough  urlLink Christopher Walken , but loved seeing grown up  urlLink Rick Schroeder . Always enjoy  urlLink Chazz Palminteri  and thought newcomer (for me)  urlLink Mars Martin  was good.

             You're Cuba!      How bad can you really be? &nbsp;So many people have said so many  bad things about you, but you know they can't all be true. &nbsp;Not even most of them. &nbsp;You went a little crazy for a while, but now you're just getting older and tired  of all the nasty stuff people think about you. &nbsp;You could use a little more money  and you really wish people wouldn't keep leaving you for richer people, but other than  that, things aren't so bad. &nbsp;You really like used military clothing.    Take the  urlLink Country Quiz  at the  urlLink Blue Pyramid       Not too far off base, really... :) But for the used military clothing part. They missed on that one.    LMAO  at myself! If you were here for the timeframe that I was Cuba fifteen times on my blog (okay, I exaggerate - I always have, right dad?), you'd be laughing at me, too. Everytime I tried to publish, blogger blew up, so I didn't think it worked... so I published  again!  I didn't know it was working! LOL, LOL!!!

      The mother's day gift was a bobblehead Raidaire.  Not  a cheerleader. I was only a cheerleader for a very brief time starting in early junior high. If you look carefully at the bobblehead, you'll see that she is fully formed, like an upper high schooler.   Am I going to have to come over there and paint a tiny little Raidaire insignia on her chest? Perhaps she needs a little Raidaire sash?

      Blogger has made so many changes! It looked totally different when I signed in this morning to make my updates and I didn't even recognize it. I still don't recognize my own blog. This is practically too much to bear!  The weekend was so gorgeous! I got lots more done in my foundation plantings. I don't have to plant them, they just needed some serious work because I haven't done much to them for the past couple of years so they kind of took over the place. Right now as I gaze out the windows of the office, there is quite an amazing bunch of color out there. The crab apple is bursting with white blossoms, the pink flamingos are in parade up the yard, the rose breasted grosbeaks have returned and are gathering on the feeders, there is a male cardinal on the ground beneath the feeders, there are two male indigo buntings - stunning in their indigoness (word???) in the incredibly green grass, the blossoms of the azaleas that weren't beaten off in the storms last night are so close in color to the flamingos that it's funny. The barberry add a nice deep dimension to the colors. And the bright yellow of the millions off dandelions that sprang up overnight pop out quite nicely giving the whole thing a star-dappled backdrop effect. Wish you could see it! But you can't. Because I can't post a photo.   Today I'm going to be running for survivor Nancy Lindstrom. This is my writing buddy, traveling buddy, Instant-Messaging buddy Marge's dear friend. This is what Marge has to say about her...    I have a Survivor friend I would like to request a dedication for ... Nancy Lindstrom, a breast cancer survivor of ... 5 years now?? ... who has been my friend since we rode trikes together in White Bear Lake. Nancy has great insight into her cancer, and also has that fierce faith and determination some call stubbornness that makes for survivors. I love her dearly.  Okay. So I guess I'd better get on it.

      The running started off with a bang this weekend. Quite literally. I was running full tilt on Lurch (my treadmill) watching a movie, when suddenly everything stopped. Dead. There was a loud beep from our electrical something or others - perhaps the smoke detectors which are wired into the power, perhaps the carbon monoxide detectors, maybe the computer which had been on because Keith was using it, maybe it was the security system or it could have been a combination of two or more of those things. There was a significant beep as they all went down when the power went out. And Lurch stopped suddenly, stopping me quite suddenly in my tracks.    Today's miles:  4  Total so far:  5.03 (on the RETURN!)  Still to go for goal:  494.97 (ugh... good thing that first 500 is behind me!!!)  Today I ran for  urlLink Krush's  Sorority Sister who recently learned she has cancer. Keep her in your thoughts. Have you heard any more about how she is doing, K?

      I'm running today for Ned. Ned was a very dear friend of the Hutch family and he fought the cancer beast and lost just recently. I know they are still hurting and missing him.    Today's miles: 4.20   Total so far: 33.79   Still to go for goal: 466.21   The Brain Trust has a new team member! My Aunt Ev has decided to join us and as a survivor herself, we'll have another reason to be celebrating at this shindig. We're having a big team meeting this weekend to discuss plans for the all important fund-raising hot dog and bratwurst stand taking place in just another week and a half at the big County Market up in the old home town.   I wish I could invite the whole blogosphere so my team could be assured of making their required Relay entry fee at this event because we'll be up there cooking those delicacies and working out butts off asking only for donations. Wish us luck!   Hitting the shower now so I can head out to pick up the kid from Driver's Ed.

      We had a gorgeous morning around here - sunshine, breezy, around 70 degrees (f)... I guess the breezes were bringing in the storms that were expected for this evening. The clouds have arrived and I'm hearing rumors of drizzle in the outlying cities that is expected to move in a bit later. I haven't checked the radar but the radio tells me to expect possible large hail and damaging winds... same old song and dance of the springtime storms.   Today's miles were for Greg's sister, Bobbie Jean (see who Greg is  urlLink here ).    Today's miles: 4.06   Total so far: 29.59   Still to go for goal: 470.41   My resolve to attack the push mower once more yesterday after hearing neighbor Don on his never-fail tractor was a good one... I suppose it could have been the extra long cooling-off period and not just my stick-to-itiveness, but I got it started fairly quickly. I mowed that front yard so I could move the feeders back into place for the birds and get the flamingos back on parade. Then, with it still running, I hauled it up onto the wall in the dog-run (no stopping it this time, I wasn't risking it - rather, risking life and limb! LOL) and got that mowed.   From there, it was lowering it back into the dog run, push it out to the north side and mow that where I promptly ran into a metal decorative sunflower that sits on a slender metal post (usually) but at this moment was buried in the leaves. It stopped the blades (and motor) rather abruptly. I pulled it out from under the mower where it was jammed against the body making it impossible for me to try and pull the starter again. I still had a tiny bit of mowing to do before I wanted to quit for the day and was luckily able to start it right off. Poor sunflower was quite destroyed. Isn't it great to hear every little detail about my lawn mowing annoyances? It's fun for me!   Now it's off to the showers for me. Hope you are having a great Wednesday, oh loyal reader or two.

      Nothing makes me feel like more of a girlie-girl than fighting with my lawn mowers and being stuck and unable to do the job. I had a good start. I worked in Bear's dog run for a while, cleaning up some of the foundation plantings that are there and realizing quickly that this wasn't the most important job to be doing. He definitely needed a place to pee by the smell of those plantings. So I got out the push mower. I checked the fuel tank and remembered as I did my helper saying he had topped it off the last time he was out visiting. It started on the second or third pull (rowr). I mowed in his kennel and just south of it.   Next it was time to pull the mower up onto the wall inside his kennel. I've done this enough times to know how dodgy that job is so I decided to cut the engine first and restart it once up there. Well guess what. I couldn't get the damn thing restarted. Checked the fuel... still had plenty. Tried again. No go. Took it back down on the flats as the top of the wall is a bit hilly - thus the need for the retainer... Tried again. No go. But hey. That's okay. There was still plenty of work to be done. I'll let the mower cool off for a while and get out the tractor and do the field and alongside the driveway.  The first worry with the tractor this season has been the battery. Would I have to jump start it? I haven't been doing it myself and haven't been taking notes when my helper has been around doing it with me. But it popped off on the first attempt.   I didn't head straight down to the field after I started it. We hadn't mowed the turnaround last week, so I thought I'd start there. Okay. I wasn't feeling terribly optimistic that the blades would go. And they didn't. No matter what I tried, I couldn't get them to pop off.   Days like this make me want to go inside and put on my bikini and grease up with baby oil and lie in the sun with a trashy romance novel and a tall, cool lemonade at my side on the hammock.   I don't need a lecture about the dangers of skin cancer. I'm not saying I'd DO that. I'm just saying that being whipped by my damn lawn mowers on a pretty much weekly basis makes me feel like a girlie-girl who can't accomplish squat sometimes. And as I sit here in my chair writing this the birds are screaming at me because I'm in  their  yard and I'm not getting my work done and I haven't put their feeders back up after moving them out of my way to mow. The nerve.   But that isn't the only noise around here. Oh no. Now I can hear the sound of neighbor Don's never-fail mower, too. Damn it.  Think I'll have another pull at the starter on that push mower. It has had quite a cool down.

      Today I'm running for Ditto's brother Lenny. Ditto is a very dear friend of mine with whom Kel and I crashed last summer when we did our Hippie Road Trip. Next run will be for her husband Greg's sister, Bobbie Jean. Both of their sibs are cancer survivors, Lenny from colon cancer, and Bobbie Jean from thyroid cancer.   Kel is still bragging about getting to drive the boat around the lake. Something she'll remember forever! We had a great time at their place.  Hugs to you Ditto. I'm missing you and Greg big time! Hope we can see you sometime this summer.   Huge congratulations to their daughter Anndrea who graduated from UCO on May 8! Way to go A! And hello to Nici! We miss your whole family so much!

Over 50 miles (finally!), so I'll be able to add my first duck (of the  return  trip)... hmm. This new method of adding photos is kinda weird. I see how to add them to the posts, but I'm not quite sure how to get them stuck on my template so they are out there all the time. Will have to think about this for a bit. The other problem is that the ducks aren't jpg files. This new method can only add jpgs. Yep. Going to have to think about this one for a while. That's the other reason I haven't put the Relay for Life logo back on the blog. It isn't a jpg. Hmmm...

      I ran for Vernon and Colleen's whole family today. I hope the surgery went well and the results they get from the pathologists give them a clear direction of action.   Today's miles: 4.0   Total so far: 48.59   Still to go for goal: 451.41   Aside from that I don't have a whole lot to say today other than, I feel like crap. My cold is still very much in my head, but it is sharing time with the cough in my chest now too. And since I'm coughing so much my throat feels like it is ready to rip apart each time a new attack hits me.   And as night comes on, my sinuses are beginning to really pound for some reason - but only on the left side. They hurt so bad my  teeth  ache. I've never been able to say that before.   Finished sharing the movie  urlLink  Speed   with Keli today after school before she dashed off to other parts with the ex and his family. What's that you say? Totally unbelievable movie with a cheesy ending? Well, yes. But come on, it's  urlLink Keanu!  Huh? He can't act? Who said that??? Besides... do we care?!    Taking my pathetically whiny self to bed now. Sleep. Plenty of fluids. Is it feed a cold and starve a fever, or starve a cold and feed a fever?

      Marge and I actually had a real conversation tonight! I didn't have to talk to just her ghost on IM! It was very exciting...  Just a sample of our thrilling reparte'...   KinnicChick : is this you?  Marge : It's me! It's me! I'm not a ghost!  KinnicChick : Wow... this is amazing!    KinnicChick : I picked up t-shirts tonight at the Relay meeting. I'll try and remember to bring yours tomorrow.   KinnicChick : *tying string around finger*  Marge : OK! I have been very awful and not collected a cent yet, but I will, I promise!   KinnicChick : remind me to ask you tomorrow if you want to work at the hot dog stand at all... you could make some there if you do. if you already know you can just tell me now, though.  Marge : We can look at dates. My weekends between now and closing are pretty tied up with garage sale, daughter surgery, pack & move garbage...  KinnicChick : Yar... I figured that. Just thought I would ask to make sure since many are getting their money from this I wanted you to have that opportunity, too.  Marge : Saleswoman I ain't. Hot dog fan I ain't neither. I do like one or two a summer if they're grilled, though. Are you going to be selling soy dogs?  KinnicChick : Nope. Mom said we could, but I don't want to mess with one more thing. If anybody requests them, I might run into the store and get some or maybe just have some in a cooler on hand or something. I don't know. I've definitely thought of it.  Marge : I thought I was being cute!   KinnicChick : I'm not much of a saleswoman, either. I figure to be a gopher running into the store for more supplies when we need them, etc...   Ha! Little did you know that THIS veggie woman had already been down that road!  KinnicChick : Agonizing over the decision!  Marge : I'll bet! Who's brainstorm was it?  KinnicChick : The soydogs?   Marge : yes  Marge : no, the hot dog sales!  KinnicChick : I thought of it immediately. Then Keith mentioned it before I verbalized. Then Keli brought it up...  KinnicChick : hehehe  KinnicChick : Jan brought up the hot dog sales when we were sitting at our garage sales last year with no customers.  Marge : I've had turkey dogs. They're good. Don't believe I've ever had a soy dog. EEK! Don't say "garage sale" and "no sales" in the same sentence!  KinnicChick : You'll do fine. S_______ is much busier for sales than we were.      KinnicChick : We're still looking for a Dude, too. Thought we might have snared one, but he's sounding like he already has cold feet.   KinnicChick : He's going to get back to me by the end of the week and let me know.  Marge : You'll probably never get as "game" a chick as last year!!!   KinnicChick : Well, I'd better get back to editing. I have to leave to go get her in about 15 minutes. I'll see you in the morning, eh? It's been fun actually talking to you and having you actually talk back! hehehe...  Marge : yes indeed. I'm much more conversant than my ghost. See you in the morning  Hurray for really catching her online!

       urlLink Kim  found a fun new quiz I had to try. Go try it yourself. Hey Dad... who's  your  inner bombshell? :)     WORSHIP! You're inner Bombshell is the beautiful Audrey Hepburn. Like her you've been blessed with a "certain something" that no one could describe accurately. You are more reserved than other bombshells, and that shows in your gentle, graceful nature. You like doing things for other people and love volunteering for your favorite charity. Yours is a rare gift in this day and age. You don't need to show a lot of skin to be sexy, all you need is your eyes. To see Audrey at the top of her game watch the movie "Breakfast at Tiffanys".    urlLink   Who is your  inner bombshell?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla

Because it's where most of my miles come from.&nbsp; urlLink     Got a photo, as you can see, of Lurch and I, as per Dad. Can you guess the movie?  It was a gorgeous day for running outside today, except for the wind. I didn't think I should battle the wind with this new cold, so I stuck out the short miles indoors. I felt a little feverish by the time I was done as it was. Whine whine whine.   Enjoy your day.

      My mother had to ask who she was speaking to when she called this morning... verify that it was really me when I answered the phone. I sound like a toad. This delightful cold thing did truly materialize. It's all in my head, but not in  that  way. I mean it's in my sinuses and my throat. Like anyone needs to know this! I'm drinking my tea. It will help soothe and make my throat  feel  sound better. I've gotta get back to taking my vitamins and minerals!  Watched  urlLink Pulp Fiction  last night. I saw it once before in theaters with a group of people from work when we went out in the middle of the afternoon for an outing to celebrate the end of a big project. Wow. I remember at the time being surprised by it for various reasons and watching it last night, I was really surprised by how much of it I'd forgotten. It was as if I'd never seen it before there was so much I couldn't remember. I remembered three distinct scenes and the whole remainder of the movie was pretty much brand new to me... I remembered the dance scene with John and Uma (but that was in all the trailers, so who wouldn't remember that?), I remembered the diner hold up (where it began  and  ended), and Uma's bad drug scene (who could forget?). It had been ten years, but still!  Dad thinks that because the vast majority of my miles have been done on Lurch, that I should have a photo of me lurching on Lurch posted. So I'll be posting one of those soon. I disagreed, but then thought of a way to take one that I'd probably like. :)   Okay. Enough rambling on varying topics. I have stuff to do. Including a run. Going to get to it. Enjoy your day. We actually have sunshine today - real blue skies without a serious cloud cover. It's still cold, but at least it's pretty.

      Ran for Hutch request Virginia Dietz today.   Finished watching Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone.    Today's miles: 3.0   Total so far: 41.09   Still to go for goal: 458.91   All of this very cold and then really warm weather has me coming down with the crud. My throat is starting to feel tickly and my body is trying to get me to cough but with the Claritin-D, it doesn't want to. I know that makes no sense, but... that's how it feels.   Did a LOT of driving today. Picked Keith up at his place, took him to an appointment on the opposite side of the cities from where he stays during the week and then back to his place again before coming back home. And now that it is spring, that means the REAL other season of the year has begun in Minnesota/Wisconsin...  Road Construction season . You can pretty much double your drive times when travelling around the cities these days.   Got home and wrassled with the push mower for a while since Dad was over. I swear he has the magic touch. He had  no  trouble getting the blades started on the tractor. Explain that to me. And they worked for me while he was here, too. But if I wanted to run them tomorrow of some reason, I bet they wouldn't work. Small comfort was that he couldn't get the push mower started either. That wasn't just me.

      I've had a busy couple of days but I just wanted all of my fabulous supporters to know that if you have at any time during the course of the 500-mile Run to Nowhere given me a donation via Paypal, snail mail or in person, you will be receiving a thank you note in the next few days (relatively few) either in the mail if I have your snail addy, or via e-mail if I do not.   Now, here's the important part... If you do not receive a thank you and you donated to my Relay for Life run, something happened and I do not know about that donation - ie, did not receive it - so  please , contact me so we can figure out what happened!   Along with those simple notes? I'm sending out a  lotta love  because you are all the greatest bunch of folks I know!  Okay. I'm off to lurch along on Lurch now. Hang with me over the next few weeks through the Relay when I'll be announcing how much ya'll helped me raise! (and then hang with me through the end of the year while I finish returning from Nowhere!)

      Today I ran for Carl Dietz, a running request from Hutch.    Thanks Keri. It's nice to have my grandpa remembered. He died 20 years ago from what I believe was bone cancer. It was in his hip.  And for my entertainment on the run? Harry Potter, Year 1. Watching Years one and two again in preparation for Year Three, coming soon to theaters near you. Can't wait!   Today's miles: 4.3   Total so far: 38.09   Still to go for goal: 461.91   We have the big team meeting this afternoon. Of the fourteen on the team, I'm counting eleven that will be in attendence. Not bad! We will be filling out the schedule for who will be on the track when during the Relay, who will be working at the hot dog stand next weekend when, and answering questions if anybody has any. I had hoped that some of the kids could work on luminarias, but I guess those haven't arrived at County Market yet.   I had one of "those nights" last night. Don't know where it came from. All I know is that I had to pick Kel up at a party at midnight and when usually I'm dragging and having a hard time keeping myself awake for that duty, last night I was wide awake -  wide awake...  And at 3 am I was lying in bed blinking around at the dimly lit room wondering what the heck I was doing still wide awake. So I got back up. My mind was going a hundred miles an hour on fifty things so I got up and wrote some of it down. At 4 I went back to bed, did the old count backwards from 100 trying to relax into sleep and was still blinking up at the ceiling as the room began to grow light at 5:30.  Wide awake.  Around 6:15 I realized I was drifting. I drifted in and out until 8 when Keith got out of bed. And then again until 10. I feel fine now. Like I had a perfectly normal night's sleep, but we'll see how long that lasts.  I took Claritin D nondrowsy formula yesterday afternoon for the first time in years. Sudafed will keep me up all night. Maybe this had the same effect. But I have to admit, after taking it, I felt more normal health-wise than I have in about three weeks. I've been wandering around in a headachy and awful fog with a stiff neck, and such. I've been tired and just dragging. And in all that time I've taken regular Claritin. Without the D. I had to stop taking the D a while back because of my high blood pressure and other meds I was on. I've gotten the bp down and stopped the other meds, so... I felt really good again from one dose of Claritin D. Couldn't beat that. Going to stop and check my bp today and see if it had any impact because I want my allergies to be this in control.  Okay. Bored my loyal reader enough. Just commenting on my bizarre lack of sleep and possible cause thereof. Couldn't have possibly been the triple shot espresso mocha drank around noon (too early) or the two and a half tiny cups of green tea at dinner with my favorite Vietnamese food from Duc's around 6 (too little). Perhaps a combination, though... :)

      There was one beautiful moment of grace over the past busy weekend (among many that I'm just not remembering, I'm sure)... Keith and I were sitting in the sunroom discussing one of three things most likely, when all of a sudden, three adorable fawns (fawn? what is the plural?) came gamboling over each other out of the forest and right into our yard and onto the patio about 8 feet from where were sitting, just beyond the wall of windows. Beyond them, nearly hidden in the woods, mom watched them. They were so tiny and sweet! Of course, I didn't have my camera in the room with me and had either of us tried to go get it, they'd have been gone like a shot. Plus, Spawn of Satan was in the room with us and we knew that any discussion or exclamaitions of their beauty would send him off lunging and barking at the window like a madman.   Unfortunately, by the time I did get to my camera, they were as predicted, dashing off... hehehe... I outta be a professional photographer, don'tcha think?    urlLink    Come back! I wanna show 'em how cute you are!&nbsp; urlLink

      Man. I can't believe how this cold/virus/allergy thing is kicking me in the butt. The weekend was a hectic mess. My ex was in town and so my daughter was gone all weekend spending the time visiting with him, his wife and their little baby, her little sister that she is so in love with and proud of. Which meant if I wanted to see Kel at all and keep a watch on how she was doing emotionally, I needed to be keeping in touch by phone and staying in touch with all the ex-in-laws to make sure they got her where she needed to be all weekend. She had the high school graduation to play for with the wind ensemble and the Memorial Day Parade to march in.   There were wild storms passing through with sirens going off and basements to seek shelter in.   There were handmade purses from my mother-in-law to sell with all proceeds going to the Relay (have we got some awesome people working on our team or what???). I've sold seven of the ten made!   There was an impromptu dinner at the folks' house with part of the extended family where we did a little discussing of the Relay and hot dog stand stuff, and celebrating of the fact that we have a "Dude Looks Like a Lady" for the contest (w00t!).  I guess by the time all of that was over and the ex had left town and Kel had decompressed (I almost said decomposed - eek! - it wasn't  that  bad, trust me) and I had sent her off to school on Tuesday morning, I was wiped. I spent all day yesterday in bed. Seriously. All.day.  I'm sleeping in the basement. Have been for about five nights. To get away from the rest of the occupants in the house and give them peace and quiet for their sleep. I cough a lot. My daughter has so much sympathy. She tells me to  shut up  please stop that everytime I cough now.   I think I feel a little better today. I might even go walk on Lurch tonight. Not run, though. That really would kick off a coughing fit to beat the band. I've been doing quiet activities today like working on the luminaria designs for the Relay.   Guess I'll grab something to eat now and see how I feel about walking after that.   The hot dog stand is coming quick! I wanted to kick butt in June with the miles, not  be  kicked instead!

       I was having an odd half awake/half asleep dream this morning in the midst of my coughing attacks about someone named Charlie Korzo(?) and the fact that he was dead. When I woke up the name seemed vaguely familar as an actor so I jumped on trusty  urlLink IMDB  and looked him up. Closest I came was  urlLink Charlie Korsmo , who as I knew him, played Jack in  urlLink Hook  (great  urlLink Robin Williams  movie, btw, and  urlLink Dustin Hoffman  as Hook makes me laugh every time).   Charlie  isn't  dead, but he also isn't acting anymore. Maybe that's what the dream was about... the death of his acting career?   According to IMDB,  "He currently serves as Deputy Domestic Policy Analyst for the House Republican Policy Committee of the U. S. House of Representatives."   and he only got involved in acting because he was bored in elementary school. So we may not see Charlie in any more movies. His acting wasn't that outstanding anyway. He was a cute little kid, though.   Speaking of the death of performers, what do you think of  urlLink this?  Kind of funny, eh? He said that if his death was all just another of his jokes, he'd be back in 20 years... I notice there hasn't been a post since the 20th. Has the joke ended? Did he go back into hiding? Is he too busy with the tour? Or did one of the non-believers catch up with him? Curiouser and curiouser...

      I ran today (veeeeeeeery slowly) for our dear friend Delores. She passed away just before last year's relay and we miss her. A lot. I graduated from high school with her daughter. Her husband and son were up for dinner at the brat stand last weekend. It's a family of good people.    Today's miles: 4.0   Total so far: 68.7   Still to go for goal: 431.3    Great news!!!  Becky's pathology report is in and there was  no cancer  found in the tumor removed from her thyroid! I'm Snoopy dancing here for Marge and Becky! Thanks to everyone who had them on their prayer lists!  Off to bed now. Hope the weather is warm and sunny tomorrow, though I don't think it is supposed to be. Kel is at a waterpark for this couple of days. Cold and rainy. Gloomy. Great timing. Early June can be so unpredictable. And we just had record breaking heat a few days ago...

      Today I ran for  urlLink Kim's  mother-in-law, Faith. Kim's family has decided to put their own Relay team together for the Canadian version of the Relay for Life in memory of her MIL.   By the way, Kim is accepting donations for her team, also. (Kimby, you need to get a link on your blog to that site you posted a while back...)    Today's miles: 5.11   Total so far: 64.7   Still to go for goal: 435.3   It rained and was miserably cold out today. Just in time for the kids from the foreign languages classes to head to the Valley Fair theme park for the day. Kel came home soaked to the skin and freezing, but she'd had fun. Tomorrow she's supposed to head Wisconsin Dells way for more waterpark fun. Again - cold and rain predictions. She'll be plenty sick by the weekend is  my  prediction.  Dad came out and spent several hours working on the d@#&ed tractor with me today. Thanks, Dad! It should be all ready for use next time we get weather that allows for cutting.   Time to relax a while with the kiddo. Have a good night.

      Breezy for sure. And warm. Last day of school around here. A silly one, though. This is one of those forced make-up days because they took too many snow days. But it makes for a ridiculous day at school because it will be a worthless day in the eyes of education. I got outside for my run today. And as Bob Seeger would say, I was running against the wind.    Today's miles: 4.0   Total so far: 59.59   Still to go for goal: 440.41   What a great weekend we had for the hot dog stand. We were so fortunate! With all of the lousy weekend weather we have had for the past many months, we really have to be thankful for the three days we were blessed with to sell those brats and dogs. And the people really responded. We ordered more food for the following day each evening, and each day we were still running out and having to go on shopping trips multiple times to buy more food. It was  great.  Better than our garage sales of last year? Definitely. Less work to begin with and more profit overall, I believe.   Will we do it again next year? Still thinking about that one. But I really don't know what else we would do for our team money makers unless we get someone on the team who is a great fundraiser with other fantastic ideas. Personally, I've tapped all of my friends and family with this running idea this year, and I'm not sure of the response I'd get doing it again next year, short of doing the run backwards or walking on my hands or something crazy, so I'm already trying to get creative and think ahead - what can I sell or do that will be different or that can reach out to the public and strangers?   This is such an important cause to me, and to many others I know.  Thanks to everyone who stopped by. I wish I'd handed out my cards with the blog address on them. I didn't think about that. Thanks to Hutch for coming by and bringing the boys and her sister. I haven't seen  her  for so many years. She gave me two fabulous things - first an incredible donation for which I cannot say thank you enough, and second, a really great compliment... she said I still look the same. She and Hutch are the ones who haven't changed a bit. Seriously. I blew your cover though, Hutch. Now my brother knows that Hutch=you. When my dad got back I said, "Dad, you missed Hutch!" And the bro then asked who Hutch was. I had no idea he didn't know. Dad was really bummed he'd missed you. So now you  have  to come to the Relay. :)   I also saw an old neighbor that I hadn't seen in many years. That was fun. She  also  said I looked exactly the same. I now take this to be a nice thing to say to someone when you have nothing else to say because you haven't seen them for so many years that you don't know them any more. *sigh* But it is still a nice thing to hear.  And I spoke with several survivors and a few people who were related to someone currently going through treatment. One was the uncle of an eight-year-old boy with an inoperable brain tumor. One was the husband of a woman who'd found out a couple months prior that she had breast cancer. One was a woman who lost her husband a few years back to a brain tumor (glioblastoma). It was a powerful weekend, driving home the fact that we've gotta keep it up. They cannot do too much research in this field... they've gotta find a cure.

      Getting down to the wire! 1:20 am. Can't sleep. Wide awake. Thinking of a zillion things about the Relay which kicks off in about 14 hours. Thought I'd get out of bed and make some notes to try and help myself get some sleep. Yeah. Maybe that'll work.   Thank you so much to everyone who helped me shatter my $300 goal. I took in   $2,215   for the American Cancer Society with my little 500 mile run to nowhere! And of course, if anyone still wants to contribute, ACS will accept donations anytime, so feel free. Now I'm working on figuring out how to top that for the next Relay, so if anyone has any ideas and is good at fundraising, send me an e-mail or comment... People are awesome and generous.  And remember that  urlLink Kim  is raising funds for the Canadian Relay now, too! Go support her efforts! She has a link on her blog to help you do just that... Once I get back from my relay, I'm going to do the same!   G'night!

      This week is flying, but not quite as quickly as I thought it was. All day yesterday was Wednesday for me. And by the end of the day I was really getting stressed because I was not getting finished with as many things as I wanted to be. But this morning I discovered that  today  was only Wednesday, so I wasn't as far behind as I thought I had been and I'm a little less stressed.   Spent yesterday mowing and grumbling about the tractor. Dad was out and  helped get  got the tractor blades moving again and remowed much of what I had done because one of the blades doesn't seem to be cutting it (mower humor). Even got Kel out there using the push mower and the trimmer. I bet she'll be groaning when she rolls out of bed in a bit. The yard is now ready to survive another week or more if we don't get a bunch more rain. It looks good, too.   Afterwards, I had some banking to do.  {Side note: Can you hear the drumroll? I'm almost to the point of being ready to announce what you've all been able to help me raise. I'm really excited because it has been great. People are so generous! I'm just waiting until the last minute - a late post on Friday before I head out to the kick off because you never know about late donations and such.}    I dropped Kel off at the folks' so she could go swimming and headed off to the bank and Target. After the shopping, I went back to the folks, did some Relay calculations, and got back to work on the luminarias. They are coming along brilliantly. I'll be posting pictures next week probably. I think I'll finish putting them together today and take the photos but I won't have time to put them up until next week when I wrap things up with the stories about the Relay.   I have a feeling the people filling them with sand and putting them out on the track won't love me very much for all the work I've put into them... They probably prefer a simple bag with a name written on them that they don't have to worry about so they can fill it quickly and put it out. I've added to the complexity. But I'll also offer to fill and put them out myself, as well as help them fill and put out others if they want that night. I'm sure they can use the help. We have several kids associated with the team that could help, too, if they want it. I should put out an e-mail to the committee and find out.   After that, I went up to the pool to join Kel and swam a few laps. It's been years since I did this. And my body can tell. I even did a few flip turns. My body hasn't attempted those for a while either. Huh. Just realized I didn't try the butterfly stroke. What a shame. Take  THAT  Miss Jorgenson. Nobody can make me... Sorry. Ninth grade swim team flashback...   Didn't get a run in. Resting after two days of street pavement pounding. Back to luminaria creation. Then I've gotta get the house cleaned up. And these clouds that are covering our skies? They may create some rain. But it's going to be the  only  rain of the week. We're going to have beautiful weather for the Relay. And very few mosquitos. It may be Minnesota's state bird, but we're in God's country here... this is Wisconsin.

      I still have plenty of room on my Relay t-shirt for the names of friends and loved ones that you might want remembered and/or honored for having battled or fallen to cancer and it won't cost you a dime. I'm still taking donations to the American Cancer Society for the Relay, of course, but I'm wearing the "memorial shirt" because I want to honor those who have had to deal with the disease. So please feel free to send more names if you wish. I've added all those on my Inspiration list at the right and still have plenty room for more.

      Kel ran with me again today. I love running with her. She and I have a perfectly matched pace and we laugh at the same stuff and can chat about things or just breathe in sync (*gasp*) or whatever. July is going to suck when she goes off to Colorado and I have to run alone again. I'll have to get lots of miles in before then so when I start slacking after she's gone (as I probably will) it won't be so detrimental. She is almost my height now and her legs are maybe even a little longer. I'm not sure she'd agree that our pace is perfectly matched, but I think we rock running together. And the weather this evening was awesome, too.   Today's miles: 3.5   Total so far: 77.7   Still to go for goal: 422.3   So you're probably wondering why we didn't go further with all the elements in our favor? I didn't have enough water prior to our run and was paying for it. So we made it a short one.   And we ran today for my Uncle Bill. He was our favorite Santa and always quick with a joke and a smile. He was taken from us far too soon and I think we've all admitted to missing him a lot. He brought a certain sparkle to family gatherings which haven't been the same without him. He knew how to get a smile from the shyest of his nieces  (me)  and could make even the most dour elders lighten up when they would catch sight of the mischievous twinkle in his eye, knowing that he was up to something and that it was probably going to bring gales of laughter and hurt nobody's feelings. Thank you for laughter and smiles and love, Uncle Bill.

      Kel and I ran today for Keith. Three years ago today he went into surgery with a 50/50 chance of coming out of it. I think my biggest fear that day (does that sound horrible? - I knew he'd make it through - the death thing wasn't an option you see) was that he would come out of it alive but with no memory of who we were (a distinct possibility). Thank goodness we had to face neither of those conclusions and he is doing so well considering all of the possibilities.   Life has changed a lot since that rainy June day in 2001, but I'm grateful to have you here with us, Keith! I know that you face a lot of challenges and I'm sorry for that, but I'm grateful for all that you do for Keli and I. You are a wonderful husband and father!!!   Today's miles: 5.5   Total so far: 74.2   Still to go for goal: 425.8   Heading to the folks' this evening for our last team meeting before the Relay next weekend. Mom's even serving dinner!

      Who are they making clothing for these days??? Supermodels and 14-year-olds only???  Keli found an adorable sundress - reversable. She looks totally sweet in it. Photo will be posted when she gets into it again and I can slow her down long enough to capture one.   I found? A blouse. Sleeveless. Hopefully my mother would have told me if I had um, what did  urlLink Marn  call them in a recent post of hers? oh yes... Kimono arm... Mom saw me in the sleeveless blouse and hopefully she would have told me if I had a serious or even not so serious case of kimono arm and not let me buy it. It is bright pink and quite pretty.   I also tried on a black dress with white polka dots, meant for the sixteen year old crowd, I believe. I tried on a really hot black suit. It was great. I meant for it to go with the pink blouse. And it was great from the top down to about the knees. That's where it started to fall apart on me. Because it was meant for a supermodel. Even in my 5-inch pumps, which I owned at one time (no more, however - I could NEVER walk in them today), and actually wore to work when I was a computer systems analyst (yep, I had a real job at one time), and walked around in them for 8-hour days... Even in those tallest of tall shoes, these slacks would have been in a puddle around the floor because those shoes would have taken me up to all of a 5' 9" stature... Not over the 6' that the slacks would have required. And by the time you got to the bottom of each leg? The opening on them would have fit an elephant's foot! They weren't bell-bottoms, but they were WIDE! What's up with that? Who are they making these clothes for?  I loved that suit. It looked so cute! Well. Until you got down toward the floor. Then it looked just plain silly.   Oh. And then there was the other little black dress. I had a little black dress back in my real job days. I loved it. It was so cute. So when I saw this hanging on the rack I thought, "Little black dress!" and I ran over and grabbed it. That's when I realized that it felt a little like a parachute. A stretchy parachute. And it was kinda shiny. And it was lined in bright red that showed all around the edges of the arm holes and neck opening. But I took it back anyway. Because it still  sort  of reminded me of that little black dress. A little bit. Kind of. It was the first thing I tried on. I zipped it up the back. It made me feel a little sexy in a way because I haven't had anything fitted on in a long time. Years probably. Shh. Don't tell my daughter I said sexy. She'll roll her eyes. Again. But it was shiny and stretchy and weird. Not in a good way. More in a dominatrixy kinda way maybe... Anyway. Took that off. Not an option.   So I had high hopes for the suit. Oh well. I bought the blouse. Mom invited me over to her place. She said if I liked the suit she had something I might want to try on. So I did. She had a black suit! And it was really cute! With black slacks that were normal! And she's got these strappy little sandals with colorful beads on them including bright pink... I'm gonna wear that tomorrow. I have a shower to attend. At a Tea House place. Never been there, but it should be fun. Now that I've finally recovered from the shopping experience.   Unfortunately, she suggested that I just come over to her place early to dress. That way, after the shower, I can just return there and change back into my clothes and won't have to get her clothes back to her later. Isn't that convenient? How does she expect me to steal her adorable suit and strappy sandals when she makes things so difficult? I think she had my number all along...

      Today's run was for the father of an old high school friend, D. I guess I should just say SCHOOL friend, though. He and I have been friends since at least second grade. I remember when he drew my name in the Christmas gift exchange that year and I received a Raggedy Anne pin from him. We were in the same class until at least fifth grade and then off and on again until graduation. I haven't seen him now for a good 15 years I guess, since our 5 year class reunion. His dad passed away after last year's Relay. I got to see most of his family at that Relay and had hoped to see them there again this year, but I think most of them are out of town now.    Today's miles: 4.5   Total so far: 105.7   Still to go for goal: 394.3   It sure doesn't feel like summer. I enjoy the lack of bugs. But I don't like feeling like I need to "bundle up" when I go outside and having to keep the windows and doors shut most of the time because the house is just too cold when I open it up.

      Had a call from the Relay for Life Chairperson last night. She was calling to let all of the team captains know that the Honorary Chairperson who had just spoken at our event on Friday night had passed away. From the newspaper...   Just days after leading the survivors lap at the local Relay For Life, Hudsonite Eric Pechacek, 32, died from his cancer Wednesday night.   Pechacek was diagnosed with leukemia last November and underwent numerous rounds of chemotherapy and an unsuccessful bone marrow transplant. He decided late last week to stop treatments for the illness.   He came from the hospital Friday night, however, and spoke to the Relay For Life crowd at Hudson's Relay For Life at Newton Field. With his wife Chyanne at his side, he told the crowd of survivors, caregivers and Relay team members that he did not want to focus on the negative things that had happened to him.   He spoke to the crowd with emotion about the love of his wife, children and family members and then was one of the leaders in the survivors lap to open the event.  "I've learned something more important from all of this - I am stronger than I ever thought I could be because of the people around me," said Pechacek. He spoke with emotion about his wife's devotion and the love he had for their two children, Peyton and Hayden. He also thanked the members of his family who have been at his side through his ordeal and to the many friends and strangers who have reached out to help his family.  "You all know what I'm talking about ... All of you are here for the same reason. It's about loving someone and supporting them. God has blessed me with my family and friends and all of you. I wanted to be here to tell you that."  Pechacek was back in the hospital Saturday.

      Click on any photo to embiggen!   urlLink    Our campsite was set up that afternoon with care. We had a great spot, right on the track but on the outer edge where we were allowed to have a campfire and staked-down tent (important the way the wind was blowing) and how cold it got that night - don't let Caitlin's little t-shirt deceive you, the wind was chilly! &nbsp; urlLink      urlLink    First there was the Survivor's Lap, in which my two honey's walked hand-in-hand...&nbsp; urlLink      urlLink    Next we had the team parade and marched along with our team banner and remembering those we've lost to cancer and honoring those who have won the battle both on the flags you see here and all over my shirt (I'm behind the team banner, though)... Don't we have a great looking team???&nbsp; urlLink      urlLink    Next came team photos, a lot of walking, visiting with friends and family, and eventually after it got dark, the luminaria ceremony. This is an example of what some of the luminarias looked like...&nbsp; urlLink      urlLink    And then it got cold. Really cold. &nbsp; urlLink      urlLink    Did I say cold???&nbsp; urlLink      urlLink    And we got tired. Really tired. Extraordinarily tired. Exhausted even...&nbsp; urlLink      urlLink    Oh.so.tired.&nbsp; urlLink      urlLink    But eventually, the sun came up! And so did the temperature... And somebody was out on that track walking all night long from every team. There were at least two or three from our team walking all night. And the cold and the exhaustion? They were so worth it. This is a great event. This is a great cause. And we'll do it until it isn't needed anymore. And I sure hope that day is soon. Because nobody wants anyone else to suffer or to die from cancer. &nbsp; urlLink

      I decided to mow the lawn today. Dad had called yesterday morning, but Kel and I had a very late night the night before and I didn't have any allergy meds and was really feeling it so I begged off and we agreed that Friday would be the day since Thursday is a day of golf for him. Well, today was pretty nice - chilly and low on bugs, plus I had replenished the claritin-D yesterday during my Target run - so I decided to get out there and spare Dad the gory dust and bumpy ride if I could.   I stuck my phone in the cup holder so I could call Kel at the house in case of emergency and off I rode, confident that the blades would start. &nbsp;   urlLink     urlLink     It was brilliant really. Dad had disconnected one of the safety features that was really causing us some grief (if you got out of the seat the blades shut down, sometimes losing us the ability to ever get them started again, well for that mowing session anyway), so I knew that I had that one licked...   Early into the mow, I got stuck. Really stuck... in a low section of the yard. I called Kel and told her to get warm clothes on and come down and steer the tractor while I hooked up the car and pulled the thing out. Just a couple of weeks ago, that wouldn't have been possible without shutting off the blades unless she could have slipped into the seat with me still in it and we could have tricked it into believing I'd never left...   Long story short, I managed to finish the WHOLE FIELD and along the driveway and EVERYWHERE without the blades shutting down, even though I bet I got stuck 7 times and had to disengage the transmission and push myself out of being stuck or hook the tractor up to the car three of those times. After a couple of hours, I was finished.   I got out the push mower and did the hand stuff. I went in the house and got out the stuff for pancakes. Then Kel told me she wanted to go to a friend's house. So I went out to get the phone to send with her.   That's when I realized it was gone. :(   AAAAAAARRRRGGGHHH!!     I spent the next hour wandering the fields, around the pines (especially around the pines figuring a pine branch had grabbed the phone and snapped it out of the cup holder), and along the edge of the long grass looking for the phone. We tried calling it. The first couple of times it picked up right away. I got a little upset by this because I knew the phone was on. Did I run it over causing it to be smashed into a billion pieces? In the meantime, Kel left with her friend. I came back inside and decided to look on top of the mower deck with the flashlight. Nothing but a lot of grass. That was a stupid idea. I looked in the car. Not there, of course. I tried calling it from the phone in the garage.  I HEARD IT RINGING! AT THE MOWER! IT  WAS  ON THE MOWER DECK!  I took off the protective cover over the gears for the blades and as you can see, there it was...&nbsp;   urlLink     urlLink      urlLink      And  this  is what the back of it looks like after having the wheel spin around on it for who knows how long. I've needed to replace this phone for a couple of years. The screen fades out completely on it on a regular basis so I can't see what I'm dialing or who is calling. I have to hit it to get it to come back and sometimes what comes back is gobbledy gook. But I don't mind really.   I think it is official. My daughter will probably never again be seen with my phone. :)&nbsp; urlLink     Oh - the best part??? Even with the beating it took - It seems to be still working fine. Won't have to replace it yet! Heh...  And  now  it's time for those pancakes... I'm starving.

      Well, today I figured out how to get Kel to Colorado without too much worry about the dog sitting and price of gasoline, etc. She's flying out. I somehow found a really inexpensive flight - roundtrip and only a week away.   Today we headed to the DMV and she got her permit. While there they said I could renew my license since it was within a year of expiration for me. I've had mine forever and it was an awful picture. I was glad to be rid of it. The new one doesn't seem a whole lot better. It's kind of stern looking in a smiley way... go figure.   And I finally got to see Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban! It was definitely different than the other two. And I liked the first two better. I admit it. I miss the old Dumbledore. But I like me some Snapes. There isn't enough of him in any of them. :)   Hutch is looking for more Relay photos. I have one I'd like to post. But I can't upon punishment of pain and suffering. And I didn't take very many. So while we wait until my Dad e-mails me some, we'll have to settle for the  other  few that I did take.    urlLink    This is the survivors from across the field all spread out around the track taking their lap...&nbsp; urlLink      urlLink    Here come the survivors rounding the final curve on their kick-off lap of the Relay! This year we had the largest group of survivors with us we've ever had! It was beautiful... &nbsp; urlLink     We had visitors - Jerry and his daughter and grandkids stopped by. His wife Delores is on my list of Honorees... They came for the luminaria ceremony. I graduated with his daughter and it was really nice to see her and her kids.   Another really good friend of mine, Carolyn, came by with her husband and daughter. They were there from opening ceremony through the luminaria ceremony. John made a luminaria for his dad; they participated in the silent auction and took home a fishing pole; they stuffed some money in our dude's purse and visited with some friends; they had some dinner at the concession stand; they visited with us and offered to walk with us next year... all in all, I think they had a good time.   Our teammate Lauren's mom, Dawn, who was treated for breast cancer and only recently completed her treatments in fact, came by and walked in the survivor's lap. She stuck around for a couple of hours.   Hutch's sister came by after the luminaria ceremony. I had just taken off to let the dog out and feed him his very late dinner and to get myself some warmer clothes for the night time hours. I hurried as quickly as I could because I hate to miss any of the Relay, but I still managed to miss her visit. I got back to the school and headed to the campsite and said to Keith, "You know what? Donna didn't come tonight." And everybody on the team who happened to be sitting around the campfire just then said in chorus, "You just missed her!" I could have cried. I was torked that I'd had to leave. Next year, I'm getting a puppy sitter. I had to leave for part of it last year because of him, too. Or else I'm going to put him in his crate and take him to my folks' house so that he's a lot closer than that drive all the way to my house... *grumble grumble*  We had a lot of fun in the morning watching the Road to Recovery car races that the little kids take part in. They decorate cardboard boxes like cars and get inside them and run around the track in them. And they are just little kids who can barely  make  it around the track. We stood there screaming and whistling and clapping for them. We were about the only few people doing that. Nobody else really noticed them. We had to yell at some walkers to get out of their way because they were coming up to them and the walkers were blocking the whole track. Some of the kids were so little that when they heard us they thought they were finished. We had to yell to keep going so they'd know they had a ways to go still. One poor little boy (Big Dan) kept tripping over his untied shoe laces and his mom just kept picking him up and telling him to keep going.   The weather was so great. The sunset was incredible, but the sunrise, after being up all night... WOW.   Well, I guess that's enough for this post. My daughter is late getting home. I'm going to sign off and get out of the office and get my teeth brushed. Think I'll read for a bit. It sure is going to be a quiet month when she is gone...

       urlLink    The photo is really grainy, but this is Kel and Keith when they got back from walking the Survivor's lap together. I usually walk it with him, but this year I sent Keli along instead because they timed a special Caregivers ceremony to take place during the Survivor's lap. &nbsp; urlLink

      Today's run was for my Uncle Roy. He had a difficult battle lost late last year.   I had to run it alone as I couldn't convince Kel to join me. She was too tired after being up all night on Friday and then until 2 on Saturday after a grad party, then all night for another grad party (the same one actually) on Sunday. Grad parties are a lot different than they were when I was in high school! This party was three days long and was a gamer party - for the kids to bring along their game cubes, computers, tv's, etc. and hang out playing all fof their cool games for as long as they wanted.    Today's miles: 5.5   Total so far: 101.2   Still to go for goal: 398.8   Looks like it's time to add another duck!   My run was pretty uneventful. I tried to keep the pace at about the same speed it goes when Keli paces me. I think I was pretty successful. I figured I'd better get out there and do it even without her because I'll need to throughout the month of July.   Any takers to fill in for her that month? I'm going to miss her! Who will fill in as my running buddy? Well, I have some thank you's to write out...

      Slowly getting back into the groove of things.   Talked to my massage therapist this morning to verify the massage I have set up for later this week. Got some errands run yesterday. Caught up with some bloggers and read the stuff I had missed over the past several days. Got the tent dried out and just need to get it rolled up and put away which will be done after I finish this entry, along with some other stuff put away. Looking up the hours of the DMV while I'm online so Kel can go get her permit this week. Figuring out arrangements for the dog so I can deliver Kel to Colorado sometime soon. As soon as the rain returns to our area I'll do some house cleaning. Until then I can't be bothered. Tonight I'll get back to laundry.   What's up with the electrical in our practically new house? Both our dishwasher and our hot tub trip their breakers. This makes no sense to me. And now, we've completely shut down the hot tub electrical stuff outside at the tub itself and the breaker still can't be turned back on. Ideas? Guess we need to get someone in here to have a look. I think our electrician wasn't the greatest or something.   Going out for a run in just a bit.   It's another gorgeous day.   Go contribute to  urlLink Kim's  Relay for Life team! She has the instructions on her  urlLink post today . She was on of the supporters who helped me become one of the top donors at my Relay for Life! It's her first year out there with her own team. Go help her make it a success!

       Thank You!   Because of your generous donations, I was honored to be called out onto the field during the closing ceremony to be photographed as one of the top five individual fund-raisers Saturday morning.   I couldn't have done it without the help of my cheerleaders and the pledges and donations from all of you. I say it again... people are  so generous!

      There will be much more to come.  We had perfectly beautiful weather. Friday was a little chilly and windy for setting up, but when the sun came out, it felt good. The breeze kept the mosquitoes at bay again this year, and we didn't need any bug repellent. That was nice. We were happy to have a campsite where a campfire was allowed because the temperature got down to 40 degrees farenheit around 4:30 am just before dawn, so the fire felt really great during the night and we were all saying that we couldn't believe it was mid-June. But better that than really hot.   Walking/running/dancing around the track was terrific. Many miles were accumulated and laughter and merriment was had by all. Our "Dude Looks Like a Lady" was fantastic and we owe him/her a huge debt of gratitude for stepping up to the plate at the last minute when our other Dude had plans that couldn't be changed interfere with his commitment. Ours was the ONLY Dude who actually fit the Disco theme of the Relay. He should have taken first prize for THAT alone! You were AWESOME Dude. And your seamstress was the BOMB.   Some of the things that had been announced to be happening, never happened. I don't know why. Things just fall apart and don't come together I guess. For example, karaoke and disco late-night were supposed to happen at the dj's tent. That was a no-go. The morning stretch infield was another no-go this year. The medals that were supposed to be handed out to teams collecting a certain dollar amount didn't happen. Our team ROCKED accumulating a total of over $5000 in only our second year as a team! Way to go Brain Trusters!    Relay miles: 18   Total so far: 95.7   Still to go for goal: 404.3   Okay. Have to take the kiddo on some errands. Back later. Hoping to get some miles under my belt for the day now that I've recovered my sleep, etc.   Another thing - our local Relay has now collected over a  Million dollars  for the American Cancer Society in its five years running. I'm proud to be a part of that. And just because it is over for this year? Doesn't mean you can't still contribute. Because I'm now working on Relay 2005!   Yep. You heard me. I'm working on fund raising ideas and a whole new campaign to get things in motion for the next one. My neices were already hitting me with themes for next year, too. I hope I have comments and e-mails filling my box from them soon because they have a whole list of theme ideas they want me submitting to the committee for the next one. So they're all psyched for next year already, too. Wanna contribute? You know where the button is. Feel free!

      The heat and the humidity. The bugs. The totally dry grass that crackles under your feet if you walk across the lawn. The severed crow's head in the middle of your driveway.   I even decided to run on the treadmill to save myself from dehydrating on the superhot pavement running around the block today. Besides, I needed to get a photo or two for   What's Keri Watching?     I hung out with my old Gray Street buddy today (Hi Carolyn!) for some girl time. We had fun. We sat out on her beautiful back patio and chatted while the morning birds sang to us. Then we went and had some lunch at Noodles (GO CARBS!). From there it was off to find a movie. We settled on  urlLink  Secret Window.   It was one I had been wanting to see and Kel wasn't interested the night before she left because she didn't want scary that night.   Cari and I saw MANY at the video store we could have gone with, but this was the first we came upon in common, so I think that was why she said we'd go with it. After  urlLink Mark's  review the other day, I was even more intrigued, and I'd have to say, I was really surprised by the movie; I wasn't expecting the twist at the end, which I won't give away for those of you who haven't seen it. We also made a stop at the nursery for a few plants.   Then I came home and got my run in, took a few photos for the game, and now I'm going to shower off and get a little reading and writing in before bed. I told Kel that I was going to re-visit the Harry Potter books while she was away. I've already read the first two a couple of times, so I'm starting with year three as that was the movie I just saw and I'd like to figure out just how much of it was left out. I'm already seeing once again just how much better the books are than the movies! And I'm only about 50 pages in. Ah well. There's only so much you can do with a couple of hours of film, eh?    Today's miles: 4.8   Total so far: 113.7   Still to go for goal: 386.3   Today's run was for my Dad's mother. I never had the pleasure of meeting my Grandmother. She died when my dad was pretty young. I think I look a lot like her, though. I have her nose. :) Kel does, too. Love to my Grandma C...  Isn't she beautiful?&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink

Even did a little writing. And I got to talk to Kel for a couple of minutes. All in all a good night!

      Well, I had a nice nap this afternoon after getting Kel sent off to Colorado (and sleeping all of about 90-minutes last night). She landed safely on the other side and should be settling in there okay by now. Sounds like she had a couple hours of sleep on the plane. I thought I'd post a few more of the photos from the park last night as long as I've got family peeking in to check on them... &nbsp; urlLink     urlLink     This one was quite an ordeal, but I won't go into all the details... Much laughter ensued.&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink     This one has Kel's best friend Annie... &nbsp; urlLink     urlLink     They've played on nearly all of the toys in the park by this point. Hey Hutch - see all of the green space back there? That's where the pirate ship and the tree/house or house on stilts use to be... Maybe you knew that, though. Did you take the boys there during your tour of the old town that day?&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink     And finally, here we all are at the end of our busy time at the park (or just before Gramps ran out of battery time on his camera)... Still to come - the girls climbing through the triangle rings you can see behind Kel in this last photo (if I post 'em). That's what set off this photo-taking frenzy... And no, Grandma and I did NOT climb through them. We COULD have, of course... we just didn't want to show the girls up with our speed and dexterity. *cough cough* &nbsp; urlLink     urlLink     Okay. Time for me to go exercise. Gotta get logging some siginficant miles. I told  urlLink VJ  I'd join her in a workout yesterday and that turned into play time (as evidenced above and below). Now that I've napped I think I can make up for that.

      We had a little going away party for Kel last night. We started out at the folks' house where Kel and her girl cousins and her best friend went swimming in my folks' swimming pool, then they hung out and did a lot of giggling. Serious giggling. After that they had a great meal of spaghetti, raviolli, salad and toasted garlic bread (sound like a familiar celebratory meal around our place, Hutch?)... More serious giggling ensued. SERIOUS giggling, right Jen?   From there, the girls wanted to head to the park for some play time. I'm not sure the parents of little children who were at the park were very excited to see all of us pile out of the cars when we arrived, loud and boistrous as we were, but those girls wanted to play and they had energy and giggles to burn. After we'd been there for a while, one of them said, "Where is the video camera when you need it?" as another of them climbed through a tricky obstacle (by this time my facial muscles were seriously in pain from all of the smiles and laughter). And then they all started calling out, "Grandma, go home and get the camera, please??? You need to get a picture of this!" So Grandma did the next best thing. She had me get my cell phone from the car and call Grandpa at home and have HIM bring the camera up and take pictures of all his granddaughters (and friend) mugging it for the camera.   Here they are trying to get the merry-go-round to go fast enough...  (as always, click on a picture to embiggen)   &nbsp; urlLink     urlLink     And here is me coming to help speed things up because everytime they jumped on after trying to get it going fast enough, it dropped all speed...  &nbsp; urlLink     urlLink     And the unfortunate result of that help... bye Erin!   &nbsp; urlLink     urlLink     She's OKAY!  &nbsp; urlLink     urlLink     From the merry-go-round it was off to demonstrate their coordination through the obstacle they'd created for themselves... I'll show the great pictures from that another time, perhaps. And then they were ready for group shots on other toys throughout the park. It was family photo night, basically. It's been a long time. They were so much fun and the pictures all turned out really cute.   It was a fun send-off for Kel. She really appreciated it, so thanks girls!  &nbsp; urlLink     urlLink

      for dying appliances/utilities in Keri's house (as seen at  urlLink Busy Mom's  this morning):  1. Dishwasher? Check 2. Hot Tub? Check 3. Overflow Freezer? Check 4. Spotlights (not bulbs) Above Fireplace? Check 5. Recessed Lights Above Window Seat? Check  Oh yeah. Sometimes I wonder who we had for an electrician when this house was built. I think rather than a certified electrician with a real brain, it was Skippy, the Contractor's 14-year-old nephew who needed a summer job.

      Ack! In less than 24 hours, my baby will be off on another trip! This time for a whole  month!   It's going to be awfully quiet around here without her. I'm going to read more books. Do a lot more writing (because I've certainly let that little practice of mine fall by the wayside), and work on getting some of the out-of-control plants out of the gardens. What would you do if you suddenly had a month off from being a parent?

       urlLink    My very artistic mom-in-law sent me this adorable award to coincide with the Relay last weekend. It's what I'm holding in my current profile picture... I wore my Inspirations T-shirt for the photo when I noticed that there weren't any shots of me from the Relay that showed it very well. It is covered front and back (and sides) with the names of all of the people you sent me and that Keith and I met along the way on his cancer journey. &nbsp; urlLink      urlLink    She also sent along a ribbon to place around my neck - and only the type of ribbon fit for a Diva - check out that fur! :) And you can't see the glitter, but believe me, it's there. My Diva sister's can appreciate this, I'm sure. Diva Katie, all that's missing is one of Sunaliza's scepters and a crown, don't you think? And a cape, of course... &nbsp; urlLink

      I took one of those online personality tests today. The title of this post is my result... I'm a Wacky Emotional Constructive Follower - otherwise known as the Candle Burning at Both Ends. Here's what it said about how I answered it:    You are a WECF--Wacky Emotional Constructive Follower. This makes you a candle burning at both ends. You work until you drop, and you play until you can stand to work again. You have so much enthusiasm that you can find it hard to control on your own, and you appreciate the guidance that channels your energy and lets you be your best.  In a relationship, you require lots of attention and support. You often over-contribute and end up feeling depleted and cheated. You may benefit from more time alone than you grant yourself.  Your driving force is the emotional support of others--especially affection. You can run on empty for miles if you have positive energy behind you. Without it--as it occasionally must run dry--you are depressive, listless, and difficult to motivate.  You need a lot of affection. Get it any way you can, but never at the cost of your self-respect or well-being.  Sometimes these things are scary.   Today's miles: 3.07   Total so far: 125.8   Still to go for goal: 374.2

      to successfully mowing my grass: Never put the tractor in reverse. Never. If for some reason you have to back up, get off the mower, put it out of transmission and push or pull the damn thing backwards. Do NOT for any reason put it in reverse. And NEVER stop the mower blades once you have them going.   Unless you are my father. Because he has the magic touch.   Magic touch man...&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink

      That total for our Relay just keeps going up. Our team received a donation last night over plates of pie at a friend's house from a friend whose darling wife passed just before the '03 Relay (and goodness do we miss her and her giggle), a former co-worker mailed hers last week, and angels sent incredible love via FedEx just this morning...   Love is so big.  Drumroll. My new total -  $2,340!  Thank you angels! Keith's Brain Trust's new total -  Over $5500  (we don't have an exact total because of the silent auction the night of the Relay, and the Dude contest)...

      But before I go, we received Michael Billet's CD,  Silent Victory , in the mail late last week and listened to it all weekend. It is fabulous. He is the musician who performed at the David Bailey concert in May. As Keith put it, "His music speaks to me as a kindred spirit on this journey..." It is an arrangement of beautiful acoustic guitar pieces by another eight-year survivor.   He is working on a website and when he gets it put together, I'm hoping he'll let us know about it.

      Last week I learned that Elizabeth's mom, Sydnor, needs to start having chemo once again. So tonight I ran for her. I know from having seen friends and family go through it what a challenge chemo can be. I hope she has an easy time of it. That's my prayer for her. And that she only has to have it for a short while and that its effectiveness is incredible.    Today's miles: 5.03   Total so far: 122.73   Still to go for goal: 377.27   I watched  urlLink  Identity   while I ran. What a suspenseful movie! And I ran starting around 9:30 pm here in my very quiet house. Think I'll be sleeping tonight? I'm not so sure. I think my next batch of movies will include some nice light comedies or romantic chick flicks for a change. This week's trio ( urlLink  Identity  ,  urlLink  The Italian Job  , and   urlLink House of Sand and Fog  ), while all great, were a little more heart-quickening than I need when I'm already running my heart at its exercise pace.  I also got to  go  to a movie today. Mom treated me to  urlLink  The Notebook   in the old hometown this afternoon. We thought we would be joined by a couple of "The Girls," but they both were too busy at the last minute to see us. One had to attend her grandson's last regular baseball game of the season, and the other had a "young man" coming to talk about a wall in her house... taking down? putting up? I don't know which. I didn't get the details. All I know is, they both missed the movie. We'd planned to see   urlLink The Terminal   with them, but when they ducked out, we changed plans because Mom really wanted to see this one instead and I've already seen   urlLink The Terminal  .   Anyway, I guess I'll try and get some sleep now. Or read. I'm going to reread  House of Sand and Fog . I actually really liked the movie. A lot more than I thought I would after having read the book. From what I remember of the book at this point, I liked the movie better and I can't usually say that. So now I have to read it again and see if that holds up.  urlLink Sir Ben Kingsley  gave an awesome performance, as did his "wife" in the movie, Iranian actress,  urlLink Shohreh Aghdashloo . And  urlLink Jennifer Connelly  was fantastic in the role of the addict in a downward spiral... It was all fabulous. Okay. To bed.

      I know that he bugs a lot of people because they don't want Hollywood to be political, but  urlLink Richard Gere  impresses me more and more everytime I read something new about him. I know there are more stars using their celebrity for causes and sometimes they are even noble ones, but it is a consistent thing with RG. He's got a strong belief system. You've gotta give him that.

      Is anyone else paying attention to the Tour de France? Having just finished reading Lance Armstrong's  urlLink It's Not About the Bike  last week, I'm quietly cheering him to his sixth victory. There is nothing I would like to see more than this headstrong Texan cancer survivor who at one time had so little chance of living, grab another Tour victory. It's one of those times I'd almost like to have TV and cable!

      Actually, this is a total giveaway for Miss Lisa - too easy, I'm afraid. The other photos didn't turn out well enough to use. The who is obvious, the what - not so much because there were several videos using the same setting/costume... &nbsp; urlLink     urlLink     Lastly, does this trigger anything for anyone? and does the  urlLink combination  of the  urlLink four  photos tell anyone what all-encompassing thing Keri was watching?&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink      Updated 7/7/04:  Okay - now for the answer to  What is Keri Watching?  from way back last week. Lisa got things rolling by knowing that the first photo was the Tom Petty video for  Mary Jane's Last Dance  with Kim Basinger. The second photo was a young Johnny Depp, which Lisa also knew (she's so smart!). And yes, he was also in a Tom Petty video, which she guessed when she saw the third photo, which was Tom himself, from the same video -  Into The Great Wide Open.  The final photo was once again, Mr. Petty, this time taken from his video for  Yer So Bad.    And all of these videos come from one source - Tom Petty and The Heartbreakers: Playback.

      Is anyone else on blogger having as challenging a time as I am these days?  Just displaying the blogs can be a pain - Error messages abound telling me The Page Cannot be Displayed... and I have to Refresh again and again and again before I can get them up (including my own).   And trying to Publish my page can be a nightmare at times. Is Blogger getting too busy for its own good? Or is there something else going on?   And is it just me? Or are you all having problems too? Those of you using blogger, are you having difficulties also? Please let me know!

      Last night I ran for Greg. Greg was a fellow Brain Tumor Warrior. Keith met him on the BT support board at the NBTF's website a couple of years back. He's the one who introduced us to the inspirational music of David M. Bailey (another BT Warrior). I've written about Greg a couple of times.   Greg was in really bad shape during the 2003 Relay because his BT had recurred as a GBM (the nastiest type) and it was progressing very rapidly as these things sometimes do. He passed away shortly after.   He and Keith shared a real love of David's lyrics and they also shared a passion for life that they discussed after their experiences with the BTs. Cancer definitely affects everybody differently. We've seen people fight their battles with it, and when they've conquered it and gone through the chemo and/or radiation and/or surgery or whatever is needed to fight their particular fight, they come out of it with many different responses.    Sometimes they are just ready to be fininshed with it. The battle is done and that's that. There is no longer any reason to do any thinking or talking about it and they don't want to dwell on it because for months that's all they  did  do.     Sometimes we've seen people throw themselves into volunteering and helping others with cancer.    There are those who go into a kind of depression or let down after having all of that help and concentrated effort focused on healing them now finished with the healing of their cancer.    Some get busy researching their cancer learning everything they can and figuring out how and why they ended up with it and how they can avoid any recurrence from happening.   And of course, there are all mix and variation of these and a myriad of other possibilities that we haven't come across (or that are slipping my mind this afternoon). Our own response to Keith's experience has been a bit of a jumble of these things and I didn't even include much of the emotional impact (aside from depression) including anger and some bit of mourning of the life prior to cancer.   Anyway, where I was going with all of this is that Greg was a kindred spirit. Keith and I talked about the fact that  several  of the BT Warriors connected deeply and we wondered if it was a Brain Tumor thing... And then there was the music from David, another BT Warrior and how meaningful it was to the experience... But it was  my  experience, too. And I didn't have a brain tumor. So...   We've each got our favorite set of lyrics. David is coming out with a new album really soon made up of some of the favorites from the survivors. I can't wait. Keith is going to put together a compilation of his favorites one of these days, but I think Hope (the new one) will probably do it for me. My favorite has always been  urlLink The Painter and The Poet . Moves me to tears nearly every time I listen to it. And I love the entire Coffee with the Angels album. If you only bought one album, that would be the one I'd recommend, but Hope isn't out yet, so...   If I remember correctly, one of Greg's was  urlLink Her Favorite Color Was Green...    I won't hazard a guess at Keith's today because I know he has several.    Last Night's miles: 4.0   Total so far: 117.7   Still to go for goal: 382.3   Anyway, I really digressed in this post, but it was a post of love for Greg. He's drinking coffee with the angels and sliding down rainbows, right between yellow and blue.

      Is it Monday already? And Monday afternoon no less?   Keith and I had a wonderful anniversary yesterday. We stayed home rather than our typical going someplace... our traditional is the St. James Hotel in Red Wing, where we get a room on the river so that we can watch the fireworks over the river from the comfort of our room with a light dinner of fruit, bread, and a variety of cheeses like Brie and Camembert, some champagne, or chilled fruit juice or something similar... Every so often we go back to where we were married in the Colorado Mountains and visit our favorite city of Georgetown where we watch the fireworks...   Yesterday we puttered around the house. I did some more weeding around the gardens while he did some of his computer work. Then we went out and played in the yard with a Frisbee and an airpump plane - that was  fun  - until the plane had crashed into it's nose one too many times and was nearly lost in the woods causing near panic as I ran across the field chasing it and almost wiping myself out because I was running looking up instead of watching where I was going a few too many times. Great exercise running and much fun, though. The plane was much more fun than the Frisbee...  We caught a late dinner at a place we thought would be packed because the old hometown was ripe with celebration of it's Fourth of July Booster Days, but we timed our meal to coincide with a popular band playing at the bandshell and people were clearing out to go listen, so we got in without a long wait and had a great meal and great service. They also moved their fireworks from this final night of the celebration so we weren't competing for parking for that. After dinner we went home and went out to our firepit where we lit the fireworks that we purchased but never used  last  year and did a lot of laughing in the process. They weren't spectacular (the stuff you can buy at the grocery store rarely is), but again, a lot of fun.   On the way home from dinner we had watched as a fog was rolling in and I told him that the creeping fog reminded me that he really needed to see the Mystery Science Theater Creeping Terror and that would be a good night for it - a good spooky night for a really frightful movie, the scariest (haha) ever. He agreed.  So after the fireworks we headed downstairs for  The Creeping Terror  and we probably laughed even harder than we had all day. It was a really enjoyable day. Good to be able to spend that much time having fun together. And Kel called while we were walking to dinner, so we even got a Happy Anniversary from her.   All of these anniversaries are precious to me, no matter how we spend them. We'll remember this one for the laughter and playfulness...   Hope you all had a wonderful Fourth of July. I know that I did.

      Can't wait to see  urlLink today's  results! &nbsp; Busy day yesterday. I'd worked so hard around the house the day before that I decided to head off to a movie but that was after meeting Marge for our typical Friday morning writing date (this week at Cafe la Poste).  &nbsp; I also did some errands in the old home town, including a stop at Wally World where I saw an old classmate of mine. It's funny. I had just been quizzing myself with my senior yearbook the night before during one insomnia attacks. (I scored about 35% on trying to put a first and last name to the photos of the faces in my own class - pathetic memory that I have; we had what, Hutch - 180 in our class? or were there fewer... I'd count them but I'm lazy, she'll prolly remember). I went through the class three or four times with the quiz improving only slightly each time. But I thought that at least if I ran into people after that, I'd maybe have a better chance of knowing who they were. &nbsp; Wrong. I saw her, knew I graduated with her, knew she hadn't changed (other than looking a little older, maybe more tired), came up with what I thought was her first name and blanked on the rest. Couldn't for my life come up with the rest. She glanced at me a couple of times as we stood in line and didn't even seem to have an ounce of recognition, so I don't feel too bad, but still.  &nbsp; I checked the yearbook later. I did have the first name right. 1/2 point.  &nbsp; After the movie the folks took me to dinner at Green Mill. This is owned by another grad of my class. I already knew this going into the situation, though. So when I saw him there later (looking great, I might add for other classmates who might be reading), it wasn't even a test of braincells to come up with his name. He was deep in conversation with people at the bar, though. I didn't get a chance to test his own memory with a hello from me. Too bad. It would have been kind of fun. I like this game.   I hear another classmate I haven't seen in over 15 (maybe 20, I can't recall if he made it to the 5 year reunion) years is coming to town near the end of the month. I'd like to arrange a bumping into to test his memory, too. But I'm afraid the joke would be on me and I wouldn't recognize him...

       I ran today for Mylette Simone. She is one of Dana's requested inspirations. In fact, Dana just posted some lovely photos of   urlLink  Mylette    a couple of days ago out on her blog,   urlLink  Think Pink   . You should go see them! You know, Miss Dana is quite an inspiration herself...       &nbsp;    Today's miles: 3.0    Total so far: 143.9    Still to go for goal: 356.1      I didn't do any movie watching today during my run, so I'll have to postpone "What is Keri Watching?" at least one more day. Sorry about that. Hopefully somebody was amused by the choices meme...    Blogger has made more changes. I can't keep up! I want a new design. I'm so fickle.

       AND  I have not yet prepared my photo for   What's Keri Watching   (stay tuned), I'm tossing this little meme first found at  urlLink Dave's  this morning. (This meme came originally from a site called  urlLink The Thinklings : The Nexus of the Intellectual Universe...)   The Rules: Pick one or the other. "Both" is not an acceptable answer; this is a gun to the head scenario. "Neither" is only acceptable if you have no information on either choice or don't understand the options. As always, feel free to provide reasons for your choices.  1. Tea: Hot or  Iced - It's summer and it's a hot one today so I'll have iced, thanks.  2.  Spider-Man  or Superman -  But I'm a child of the movies here. I was never keen on Mr. Reeves' Superman. Give me handsome Tobey Maquire anyday of the week.  3. John Lennon or Paul McCartney -  George Harrison. :) Okay, okay. That wasn't the question. John Lennon of the two.  4.  The Beatles  or The Rolling Stones -  The Beatles. But I do get a kick out of Mick Jagger and Keith Richards.   5. Newsweek or TIME or U.S. News and World Report -  None of the above. I don't read any of them.  6. DJ Jazzy Jeff or  The Fresh Prince  -  The Fresh Prince. I love Will Smith.  7. Dostoevsky or  Tolstoy  8. Horses or  Cows - I'm from Wisconsin, what else am I going to say? ;-)  9.  Lemons  or Limes -  I love me some lemon meringue pie. I've always wanted to try key lime, but lemon meringue is constantly calling me when I have the opportunity so I never try it...  10. Catwoman: Julie Newmar or  Eartha Kitt - Could there BE another Catwoman? Who IS Julie Newmar? ;)  11. Wallpaper or  Paint - I actually hate wallpaper but love the look of a fresh coat of paint in various colors.  12. Radiohead or  Coldplay  13. Conan O’Brien or Craig Kilborn - neither. I haven't seen late night TV since Letterman changed networks. 14.  Widescreen  or Full Screen -  for a long time I resisted thinking there was no difference other than an annoying black space, but then I did a comparison between our widescreen DVD of Bridget Jones and our VHS and realized the subtle things we were missing out on.  15. Red or  Blue  16. Salsa: Hot or Mild -  not a salsa person, I hate chunks of onions and other unknowns in my food; I'm weird that way.  17. Peanuts or Pecans -  wait, which ones are pecans again? do I like those?  peanuts I think.  18.  “America the Beautiful”  or “God Bless America” 19. Lynrd Skynrd or  Neil Young - but only in small doses and with CSN  20. Checks or  Cash - I've gotten lazy since the invention of the chextra cards, I hate writing out checks.  21.  Paper  or Plastic -  but give me paper only if it has handles. Otherwise I'll try and remember my own cloth bags. And I usually try to remember them anyway.   22. Golf or  Tennis - table tennis, that is. :)  23. Flowers or  Candy - are you kidding me?  24. Howard the Duck or Ishtar - shoot me now. neither! At least I can say I've never seen either of them! 25. Hall or Oates - um, neither. 26.  Captain  or Tenille -  I had a serious crush on the captain when I was about 8. He was so cute!  27. In a chick’s hair: Clippies or Scrunchies - a chick's? Anyway, I wear my hair short. Scrunchies suck. Clippies? Who calls them clippies? Chicks maybe.  My answer is neither.  28. Fannypacks or  Spandex Biking Shorts - heh.  29.  Science Fiction  or Fantasy - tough call that.  30. Jason Seaver or  Steven Keaton - give me Michael Gross's grown-up flower child dad over Alan Thicke's character any day.  31. Mike Seaver or  Alex P. Keaton - this one is tougher but I love Michael J. Fox and his uptight characters contrast with his parents.  32. Rainbow Brite or Strawberry Shortcake - who? 33. G.I. Joe or  Transformers   34. Dawson or Pacey - wha? 35.  Sunny skies  or Rainy day -  Sunny skies. Definitely.

      Today I ran (finally) for the family of Cecilia Ledevehat. I can't believe it took me this long. I should have had a calendar sitting right beside my computer to write down who I was going to run for when so that I would keep track of everything properly. Miss Trudi asked me to run for Cecilia's family back in May. She was the mother of one of Trudi's oldest and dearest friends and she has passed away the morning that Trudi asked me. I'm only a couple of months late Trudles. But here is your run, sweetie!    Today's miles: 5.5   Total so far: 140.9   Still to go for goal: 359.1   I finished watching  urlLink Road to Perdition  and started watching something else. I'm not going to tell you what, though. Because tomorrow I'll snap a photo and put it up for What is Keri Watching??? I'm having trouble posting today, though. If I get any posts to go through, we'll all get to play.  Maybe I'll see you soon.  Excitement! I just saw the brilliant flash of a scarlet tanager go flying by my office window. Haven't seen one of those all summer!   Off to the showers now. And to find the Tums. I had to finish off the yogurt with one more bowl of grapenuts and yogurt his afternoon before my run as I hadn't had brekkie before Dad came by to work on the tractor. Besides, there were all sorts of ripe black raspberries alongside the driveway that I picked as I waved goodbye to him that were just crying out for a yogurt/grapenuts parfait...  Then I'm going to go return mom's vase to her. I filled it up with all sorts of beautiful hydrangia from my garden... Shhh. Don't anybody tell her. I want to surprise her.

      No mocha tastes better than one given by friends unexpectedly...   I had a venti  urlLink mocha frappuccino   with  whipped cream because it was such a nice day outside!   Mmmmm Mocha!  Now I'm going to go finish watching  urlLink Road to Perdition  and do my run for today.   Dad and I just spent a frustrating several hours with the tractor. Sorry, Dad... Hate to waste your afternoon like that. Hope your day improves.

      Today's run was for Kathy, Anthony, Minnie's Sister, and Bruce. This is a group of BT Warriors, most of whom Keith knew through the BT Support group he met at the  urlLink NBTF's  online website and one that we met in Denver when we went to the conference out there a couple of years ago. A strong and wonderful group of warriors, all of them.    Today's miles: 5.1   Total so far: 135.4   Still to go for goal: 364.6   Started watching  urlLink Road to Perdition  today while I lurched along on Lurch. And Robert? You'll be happy to know I don't always run the entire thing. Today I bet I quickly walked about a third of the mileage.   Now I'm going to shower and run some errands. I'm still trying to get a hold of some music to get in the mail for Kel, and I have some shopping and some play tickets to order and I could use a mocha. Mmmmmmm mocha...

      My all time favorite brekkie is Grapenuts and Old Home fat free vanilla yogurt.   As Kel's furbie would say, "Yummmmmm..."   But after three consecutive days of that for breakfast and even a late night snack last night of a tiny bowl before bed, I now remember why I'd stopped having it a few years back.  I have the worst heartburn! Why is it the best tasting stuff has the worst effects on a person?

      Being so much younger than my brothers, going on car trips with them when we were kids had some of the usual challenges ("Give that back, it's  mine! ", "MOM, he's on my side of the seat", etc.) but wasn't as crazy as some carloads of siblings can be.   Perhaps it was different with my two brothers being so close in age when they were young. All I know is, Kira has three boys, close together, and she has a serious gift for writing about their life. She's written  urlLink another classic  today (or rather, last night) and if you haven't read it yet, go there now.  I haven't played along for  urlLink Buzz's  Blog it Forward lately, so here's my contribution to his great idea.

      I watched   urlLink Stolen Summer   while I ran, the first Project Greenlight contest winner for those of you who may have followed that documentary.   Saw my sports star nephew Ben play baseball tonight, too. His team didn't win their first playoff game, but not for lack of trying.    Today's miles: 4.25   Total so far: 130.3   Still to go for goal: 369.7   Dad is coming early tomorrow to work with me on the mower. I went over and picked up the ramps tonight so we could pull it up and do the cleaning out without removing the mower deck if we want to. We'll see how that goes.   Now I'm heading to bed so I can get up in the morning... I stayed up late on a phone call with Kel and then trying to finish reading  urlLink  House of Sand and Fog   last night and didn't notice my watch had stopped running until I reached to turn the light off at what I thought was a little past two and saw my clock on the nightstand. I was shocked to see that it read 3:30. Oops. Must have more sleep...   Damn. Looking at my watch right now with the new battery I thought I was getting a jump on that sleep tonight. I thought it was 11:20. Here it is 12:47 already. Rats. Morning will come more quickly than I'd hoped.

      We had a fantastic family get together Saturday (missing a couple of people with Keli in Colorado and Benjamin golfing and Cory working - I think) at my oldest (soon to be even  older ) brother's house. We headed there for a BBQ and volleyball! If I don't look dressed for volleyball in the photos, it's because I wasn't expecting it. I only heard barbeque in the invitation and I simply decided to dress for an afternoon of lounging about on the deck with a drink in my hand. I can't help it if I had to jump into the middle of things when I heard the siren call of my beautiful nieces!   Here are the grandkids and kids with grandpop... &nbsp; urlLink     urlLink     As you can see, everybody soon got into the act. A few of us took a tumble during the game.   That's   how competitive it was!&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink     We went from regular Vball rules to "no rules" to "no bouncing off the ground" and adding a "no double hits" back to "no rules". We didn't score the game after the first six or so points as people dropped in and out of the game. And David, who just got the cast taken off his broken hand the day before (well, his now mended hand), used his  noggin  to return  and serve  the ball when it was in his area and managed to score several points for our team... yeah Dave!  Yes, we were working hard in the sun to make points - even though we weren't keeping score.&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink     And the between-play commentary across the net was also a little competitive... There was distracting dancing and joking around going on. Certain young ladies have the hardest time serving when they are giggling... &nbsp; urlLink     urlLink     The five of us haven't sat together for a family photo for a long time. Every girl needs some big brothers around when she's growing up. &nbsp; urlLink     urlLink     Life is never boring when my family is together.&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink      I spoke with Kel on the phone while I was putting this post together. She called around midnight and asked what I was doing. I said blogging. She asked what I was blogging about and I told her that I was putting together the photos of our time together up at her Uncle's house and she said, "Oh, did you go there for the Fourth of July?"   I said, "No, we were just invited up yesterday for a barbeque and some volleyball."   She was quite put out. Wondered why we couldn't have done that while she was home. "Oh sure, you all get together for fun when I'm not there."   I told her not to worry, there would be pictures for her when she got back. :) Hopefully we can do it again in August before the kids are back in school (she says sheepishly inviting the whole family back up to her brother's house...)

      Question for Hutch is on vacation for the rest of the weekend because I just KNOW how busy she is this weekend what with that big Country Jam thing going on and having to get all spiffied up to go see Mr. George Strait. I'm jealous besides. Did you hear that Hutchling Number One? That is one cool birthday gift you got there. Have yourselves some fun and sing along a few times in my place. 'cuz you KNOW that's what I'd be doin' if I was there.   Darn right I would. I'd have on my jeans and cowboy boots and a little white tank top (in honor of Dierks Bentley) and even my hat I bet... Ya'll would be totally embarrassed to have me along so it's a good thing you didn't invite me. You'd be sneaking off down the lane pretending you weren't with me... Man. What was I thinkin'? ;-)   Have fun!!

      Sweet  urlLink Dana  is gettin' busy (among a whole lot of other bloggers out there) with  urlLink Project Blog , which I will someday participate in (or the blogathon if that comes back next year or whatever)...   Her current post is about  urlLink Dana Perry , one of the inspirations in my list on the right, and the woman I last  urlLink ran  for. I just wanted to make note of that here, because I had mentioned that I was hoping  urlLink Dana  would pop by and say something about Ms. Perry in my comments that day and she has been so busy preparing stuff for Project Blog that she hasn't had a chance to do that. So now you can read all about her, and go support Dana's other efforts in her twenty-four hour blog-o-mania (there are already some powerful posts out there, and some beautiful photos, and funny stuff).   Leave her comments, ask her questions, anything to help keep her going for several more hours!  And certainly not to be forgotten,  urlLink Angela  is also participating in Project Blog! Hope you visit her and cheer her on, as well!

      You are all probably already aware of this totally cool website, but every once in a while I have to talk about it anyway because I think it is such a great idea.   Being big readers around our place, we have tended to amass a huge quantity of books.   Huge.   Far too many. So many that I have boxes of them downstairs waiting for the day that we have lots of time on our hands to design and build the bookshelves of our dreams in various locations around the house to hold all of said books.   Because we have a very difficult time parting with them. Or many of them anyway. I've parted with some. I sold a large number in the Relay for Life garage sales we had last year. And I've also managed to release a few into the wild. Through  urlLink Bookcrossing .   If you haven't heard about  urlLink Bookcrossing , it's this really great place on the web where people from all around the world share books and follow the paths of those books as they are passed on from person to person. Follow the link and have a peek. It's cool.

      All that's left is the basic victory lap at the Tour de France - the ride in to Paris... And Lance leads by a large margin! Looks like he will wrap it up tomorrow with an historical first six-time win...   I am   so   pleased!

       Blisters? Check!    Sunburn? Check!    Sore calf muscles? Check!    Lactose overrun? Check!    Weight gain? Probably!   Today was baseball day! Since Keith was hard at his overtime work the minute he woke up this morning, I decided to head in to the old hometown and watch my nephew play a little baseball. I don't know where he gets his energy. I suppose the fact that he's eleven helps... He played two games at one field, then ran off and jumped into another uniform and played as a substitute for another team that was short players in a tournement at another field. So I jumped in my car and followed him to that game, too. He's got another couple of games tomorrow, but I'll have to miss those. It was fun to watch them play today, though. He's a great player, and he can play any position. He's an all around great athelete. Put him in any sport and he'll take to it like he was born to it. He's a natural.    These aren't actually from yesterday's games, but here he is outfitted and ready to play... (he's in the helmet)   &nbsp; urlLink     urlLink     Action shot! Poised and ready to swing. I bet he knocked this one out of the park!  &nbsp; urlLink     urlLink     You'd be proud of me, Hutch. Saw the parent of another class of '83 student at the baseball fields this afternoon. Went and had a little chat with her. I know she's in town and generally where she lives and works. Told the mom I'd be in touch to get more details soon. :) I'll be getting those updated address books together before you know it. Maybe you will want to be on the committee when you see how put together I am. It will be all fun and no work! heh.  Brought home dinner from Papa Murphy's. Going to eat now and then I need to run ramps down to the other bro's house.

      Will you please send me the name and addy from the last reunion book for Tuna aka J.O.? (e-mail) Apparantly she got the box of reunion stuff back because KH didn't want anything to do with it. :) I have to start with her and I think she's still in or around the old hometown, but I don't know who she married.   She still has at least one sib in town, though. So if you don't have anything on her, I can go that route. Thanks!    (Question for Hutch is a daily segment where I ask an old school chum of a mine a question - in order to continue conversating with her, just because I like to chat with mah friend!)

      I planned it that way. No running. It was a day of walking. And because I was walking, I wore jeans and a t-shirt. It was a lovely day out. The temperature hovered right around 70 and the dewpoint was nice and low. There was a sweet breeze keeping things cool. It was great. And I walked. And walked.    Today's miles: 5.9    Total so far: 163.5    Still to go for goal: 336.5    I had determined my path before I even drove in to town to meet with Magnificent Marge for our writing date. We met at our favorite Cafe' la Poste. She had a list of writing ideas gleaned from her Mom, which turned out to be a great idea. We wasted much less time trying to find our own ideas and there wasn't the usual back and forth on whether we liked a topic or not. We just took her "assignments" and did them. We ate cheesecake. :) We drank copious amounts of coffee. It was a good morning. Then I drove over to the folks, changed into a lighter shirt, wrote my dad a note telling him I was walking since he wasn't home at the time, and I set off on my pre-determined path.   I had no idea how far the route was, I just knew where I wanted to go. I had no idea how long it would take me. I didn't think it was far or long. So rather than put my fancy running shoes on (I wasn't running after all), I simply wore my kiddo's hiking sandals sans socks.     Note: When setting off on a walk for which you do not know the distance, do not wear shoes you aren't positive are the most comfortable in the world and which aren't enclosed to keep out all manner of pebbles and sandy grit. I'm just saying.     On the way back to the folks', I planned the route to take me past an old classmate's house, rather&nbsp;- the house a classmate grew up in, and that her mom still lives in. I knew that over a year ago, all of the class reunion stuff had been dropped off there as this classmate was a part of the new reunion committee assigned to planning the next reunion. I decided I would stop there and check in with this mom and find out whatever happened to that box and see if I could get my classmate's address information.     (The route also took me past a nice grocery store with a really clean bathroom, thank goodness - really necessary on a long walk after copious amounts of coffee... Just saying!)    So ninety minutes after setting out on my walk and twenty years after last seeing her, I knocked on this woman's door. I hadn't seen a car through the windows of her garage, so I didn't really think she was home, but a few minutes later, I heard the lock opening, and then the door opening, and then I heard, "Hello Keri!" She invited me in and we chatted for a little while. I asked about her daughter, got the address and asked about the box. Turns out she doesn't have it anymore. She returned it from whence it came about a year ago.   So Hutch, your question of the day is coming up... :) Go dig out your last reunion packet! I need info girlfriend!   It was a nice visit. I continued on my way, knowing my feet were becoming quite blistered and that I had made a big mistake wearing the shoes I was wearing, but hey, I was looking good. Heh.   About 20 minutes later I climbed the fence in my folks' yard to save myself about a third of a mile (maybe even a half mile - I should check that some day) of further walking.   And now I'm waiting for the hubby to get done with his massage so I can pick him up there and we can go off to Duc's - our favorite Vietnamese restaurant for dinner. And so far? Everybody has loved the cheesecake and said that if I hadn't mentioned the mistake I made, they never would have noticed it.   And hubby? He said it's just like E used to make - his first love. Isn't that sweet? Comments? I'd love to hear them. Really I would.

      Just want you all to know that I've done it. I've created the beautiful cheesecake you can see pictured  urlLink here . No, I haven't tried it yet. Yes, I did mess up on the recipe once. It was a minor little thing. I'm sure it will still be fine. *cough* I never claimed to be a Suzy Homemaker. And this is just the test run. It's going to be great.    Guinnea Pig Taste-tester Marge is going to love it. :) Just wait and see. I'm taking some with me on our writing date tomorrow morning. Stay tuned for her review...

      Which musical act is Hutchling Number One looking forward to seeing/hearing the most? That is coming up, right? Let him know that I'm quite jealous and Kel will be, too, when she is reminded.   I'm thinking I'd like some good old George Strait if it were up to me. But of course, it's not. Then again, the whole lineup that day sounds pretty fun! Dierks Bentley, Tracy Lawrence, Patty Loveless... Is he a big fan of all of them? Okay, okay, I'm asking a lot more than one question... Sounds like a fun time could be had by all! Say hello to your sis for me.   And have fun!

      Blogger sucks bigtime. Okay - Blogger doesn't suck. Blogger is great because they have all of this free stuff for me to use and I love it, but tonight I'm really frustrated because of this problem with my photos disappearing...  I had a lovely photo essay put together, sent e-mails to the family about it and then one by one the photos started crashing because blogger was wiping off the last part of the file name...   Don't ask me why/how. I'm trying to get the stupid thing fixed. I'm totally frustrated.   Grrrr.  **************************  IMPORTANT UPDATE for Blogger users who are posting photos via Hello   VJ - this means you! (among others)  I figured out the problem I had tonight only happened when I went to blogger's fancy new interface screen (Compose) with my page full of pictures. Anytime I did that, for some reason Blogger chopped off half of the file name of my photos and I had to put them back on there again over on the Edit screen if I saved the post, or just start from scratch and retransfer them (but it took a while to figure out where I was losing them and when).   I'd say they have a little bug in the system. I guess it pays to have a background in software testing, too... :) Well, it doesn't   pay   exactly. I wish that it  did  pay. I could use the money. *sigh* I should go get a job. Do you suppose Blogger would pay me to sit at home and test their stuff before they roll out the changes?

       I realized as I went back to Keli's  urlLink party   urlLink  pictures that I never posted the shots of the girls doing their big obstacle course challenge... And they turned out so cute, too. So for my own amusement, and for the rest of the family and friends who haven't gotten to see them yet (I realize that isn't many as I've already forced most of you to look at them), here they are! &nbsp;   (Click on a photo to embiggen, please... they're so much better when you can really  see  the expressions on their faces!)      &nbsp; urlLink     urlLink   &nbsp;  My girls are tough and beautiful!   &nbsp; urlLink          urlLink      &nbsp;  Filled with adventurous spirits and inventive minds...   &nbsp;  urlLink        urlLink      &nbsp;  And they have fun...   &nbsp; urlLink        urlLink      &nbsp;  Aren't they gorgeous???   &nbsp;  urlLink        &nbsp;  urlLink      &nbsp;  And they know how to just be themselves and laugh!   &nbsp;  urlLink        urlLink      &nbsp;  I hope they can always maintain that firey spirit within!   &nbsp;  urlLink        urlLink      &nbsp;  Bye Girls! (and Mermaid...) Thanks for the memories!       As Mark has said, these photo essays need music! Wish I knew the first thing about adding it because I would! That would be cool...

       It was a curious thing I noticed while looking at my friend's photos from her class reunion... For the most part, the years had been good to the kids in her class and in looking at them, I saw a lot of familiar faces.   Well, among the  women ... Not to be cruel or anything, but the women were aging very gracefully and changing the least. There were men among those faces that when she told me who they were, I didn't believe her! Not all of the men, mind you. But a few... They were completely unrecognizable and I should have  known  them because they were  friends  of mine while in school!&nbsp;   Yes, yes. I know what you're thinking. You're remembering back to my little   urlLink  quiz    and how poorly I did on the names thing. But these weren't names! These were  faces!    A lot of the kids I was wondering about hadn't shown up, so that made me kind of sad. But there were some there who had me curious and some of my questions were answered. That was fun.   I'm thinking I might pull that list of committee members out one of these days and contact a couple of them and start working on the address list for our next reunion and actually get working on something. It won't be long before our big twenty-five is knocking at the door. It might be fun to see some of the gang. *gasp* Did I just write that? Hutch? What's come over me!?!

       The next in line of  urlLink  Dana's   inspirations! Hope she pops by and tells us a little bit of history!     UPDATE! Dana is in the midst of her blogathon and has just posted a whole lotta great info about  urlLink Dana Perry  so now I can link it and you can read all about it!   Today's miles: 4.1    Total so far: 157.6    Still to go for goal: 342.4    I started out the day with a haircut! Call me Shorty McShortShort! I Lurrrrrrrrrves it! It is cool and easy. Then I changed into my running shoes and a cooler (and hairless) shirt.   Today I ran in the old hometown again. I started out walking at the folks' house, and took off up the hill and into a different cemetary. I stopped briefly at an old schoolmate's gravesite where he is buried side by side with his brother. Scott was killed in a tragic car accident on the day he and his friends were celebrating his eighteenth birthday. His brother took his own life a few years later. Very sad. Then I noticed a funeral a little distance away and respectfully moved my feet out of there.   I moved past&nbsp; urlLink the park   &nbsp;from the   urlLink  recent party    for Kel and had grins and chuckles all the way past.   As I reached the corner, I saw a car at the intersection with a grinning and familiar face in the driver's seat but with my headphones in, didn't realize what she was saying until she had drivin away and simply waved my arm off at my hairstylist ("Nice haircut!").   That's when I started running and was moving along really well using music for the first time. I think I'm going to have to get me one of the new cheaper MP3's. I see Apple is coming out with a cheaper iPod that I might have to  save up for   beg the Easter Bunny for  ask for this Christmas. Anyway, I was listening to my Best of Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers CD which is just long enough and just rockin enough to keep me moving.   I decided to run down Gray Street for kicks and some old neighbors were outside, including a gal I grew up with. She was a kick-ass bike rider. We'd have races around the block on our banana seat bikes and nobody could beat her. Her kids were there today, too. I stopped and chatted with all of them and met the kids and told them how awesome their mom was on that bike. They laughed. I don't think they could picture it. Finally I took off again. Good thing I had the music. I'm not sure I could have restarted after that cool down!   I had an incredibly difficult hill to run up at one point. Ended up having to walk half of it. Some day I'll rerun that route and kick that hill's butt. When I'm in better shape. Just watch me.   Going to shower now. And drink. Lots. At least the humidity has released its grip. We had some nice storms move through last night and cool things down a bit. Going to post some more photos from Kel's party later. There are some fun ones that never got up. And still a Q4H to come!

       Oh yeah... Movies, popcorn, dill pickle potato chips, vegies with dip, and TGIFriday's Mudslides. Is there anything better? And for dessert I still have strawberries and fruit dip to enjoy if I want...   We watched   urlLink   Runaway Jury     (yes,   urlLink  John Cusack    - of course) and   urlLink   Along Came Polly    . We also looked at her photos from the reunion and she told me what was happening with the various people who came to it.   It was a fun afternoon!

       I was really sore today. I mowed with the push mower yesterday and it took me a while to get the thing started. Pulling on that starter stresses out the muscles in my neck and upper back a wee bit.   But with mom heading for Dallas this week, she had to give up a massage. She asked me to cancel it for her. I did one better. I took it instead.   I've just returned from there. Sue has the magic touch. I feel much better. Now I'm going to go wash the massage oil out of my hair because my Gray Street Buddy is on her way here for movie day...   I've picked up treats. Not all bad stuff, either - vegies and dip, some fruit, and popcorn. Of course. What would movie day be without popcorn. I didn't even get M&amp;M's to throw in it while it's still hot. Unfortunately...   Will report later on what we watched.   Hope ya'll have a good day. It's been too quiet around here. I know you're reading. I've got the statistics to prove it. Even the gov'mint is reading. :)

       Hey, Hutch... You're falling behind, buddy!   Another easy question for you today. Has season two of Starsky and Hutch come out on DVD yet?     (Question for Hutch is a daily segment where I ask an old school chum of a mine a question - in order to continue conversating with her, just because I like to chat with mah friend!)

       I said I might be back with   urlLink  TJ's questions    since it was Tuesday. I haven't done these in a long time. Probably never here at 500 miles. I think that was only in a past life. So here they are for your amusement. I hope you play along, but if you choose not to, so be it.   Would you rather:&nbsp;    &nbsp;  1.   run a mile with a cracked shinbone   OR do 50 situps with a cracked tailbone?    I've run with really bad shinsplints before and I know that they suck bigtime, but I've also felt the pain of horrible pain in the tailbone after a bad fall and 50 situps with even worse pain from a cracked tailbone would wipe me out completely. A mile isn't very far at all. I'll take the mile.    2.   be stuck beside somebody with horrible body odor on a crowded subway car for 10 stops   OR against someone with an obvious erection on a long elevator ride?   It's called breathing with your mouth open, baby.&nbsp;    3.   feed your children by regurgitation   OR have to lick them to bathe them?   Okay, both of these sound&nbsp;disgusting, but licking to bathe would make me regurgitate anyway,&nbsp;and I'd end up doing both, and no bathing would be accomplished... I'm just saying.&nbsp;    4. while still living,   get a glimpse of   heaven OR   hell  ?    I don't know why. Just morbid curiosity?     urlLink  Tuesday is Chooseday

       Today's Question for Hutch:  I know that we haven't finished up with yesterday's yet, but this is an easy one that you can answer in conjunction with yesterday's. Since I'm getting together with the Graystreet gal tomorrow for movie day and we are discussing her class reunion, is there anyone that you want me to ask about? Get out your yearbook and flip through it... I don't know if they invited teachers or have any info, but I'll ask!

       Because that deserves a really great run and today was hot, but fun. Well... it was a long one. And it earned me a new duck! I've got a long way to go if I'm going to make it to 200 by the end of the month, which is where I wanted to be, but if I keep going like this, I can do it. No pressure, but it would be cool. We're so thrilled by Bernie and Barb's news! We're celebrating with you guys!       &nbsp;    Today's miles: 5.4    Total so far: 153.5    Still to go for goal:&nbsp;346.5  &nbsp;     &nbsp;   So today I ran the old route in the old hometown. I use to run this route back in the old days when I moved home from Colorado. My folks lived in a different house then, out by this old route. And the road I ran out was a lot quieter and had a lot fewer houses on it. Things change. The road I ran out had some other history, too.     &nbsp;   It was the road that back in, oh 1982 or so, I totalled my Dad's prize Cougar. It was so pretty - midnight blue metallic and fawn, two doors - it was sweet. I was going around a blind curve on dry roads and another car came around from the other direction on my side of the road so I swung wide to miss him and headed straight for the supports of the railroad bridge. Being the young driver I was (I'd had my license prolly less than a year at that point), I cut back too sharp and shot toward the other side of the road and then cut back again, swerving out of control. About that time the left rear of the car slammed into the far curb snapping the rear axel before I shot back across the road and up an embankment. The other driver never saw any of it happen, he just obliviously kept going. As I sat there stunned but unhurt, three other cars drove by looking at me sitting there in the road where the car had rolled back down and thinking to myself that I was a dead duck. Finally a guy stopped and gave me some help. But Dad's car was history. And my brother  (the favorite son)   will never let me live it down. *sigh*      I used to run this road with my buddy, Lynn. Wish I could run with her again. Haven't managed to connect with her on the whole running thing, though. We had a pretty well-matched pace back then. I think it would be fun to try that again. Especially on the old routes.     Movie day with my Gray Street Buddy tomorrow. Get to hear the updates on her class reunion. She was part of the class after mine (my ex's class, too) because she is younger than me. She never lets me live that down, either. :-)

       When I was a kid and we had any power shopping to do, my mom used to take me to this mall (can't remember which) and at lunch we headed to a restaurant in the mall that I believe was called the Walrus and the Carpenter. I don't remember anything about my meals at this place, they were your average meal for a kid... But what I always looked forward to and what made the pain of shopping so much more bearable was the dessert. They had a Mississippi Mud Pie that would make a little girl sit through agonizing waits outside the fitting room door for...   Deep dark chocolate cookie crust, a coffee ice cream layer, a rich fudge layer... It was heavenly to this kid...   So the other day I'm in the grocery store picking up the things for the cheese cake I'm going to make - you know, the recipe I found over at Stacey and Bill's   urlLink  kitchen blog   ... And while walking past the freezer, I found Starbucks Coffee brand, Mud Pie ice cream. Well, of course I had to buy it. I just had a little dish this afternoon to try it out.   It tastes  just like  that old pie from the Walrus and the Carpenter restaurant. Like a little slice of childhood in a dish.

       I finished mowing the grass this morning out in the sticky, humid heat.   Now I'm going to spend some time updating the old blog entries getting photos that were on angelfire out on Picasa where they belong so I don't have things triggering that nasty message when people go surfing in the archives.   I had an interesting visit to the blog yesterday from the gov'mint. Statistical reporting is fascinating and frightening all at once.   Hope things cool down after the rains come through. Okay - hope the rains come through in a bit to cool things down.   I'd like to go out for a nice long run again this afternoon. It was fun running a totally different route through the old hometown yesterday and today I'm thinking a really  old &nbsp;run through the old hometown would be even more fun. I was running about 15 or so years ago when I first moved back from Colorado and used to run a pretty predictable route. After driving it last week on my way to my all-star nephew's baseball game, I realized that route isn't so predictable anymore and think it might be fun to run it once for old time's sake.   Okay. Off to work in the archives. And it's Tuesday. I haven't answered TJ's questions for a long time. Maybe I'll slap them up here for fun later, too. We'll see.

       I so enjoyed conversing with Hutch over the past&nbsp;couple of&nbsp;days in the comments that I think each day I shall have one post devoted to a Question for Hutch...   Who knows what I'll ask? But it'll be just for you Hutch.   Here's today's  Question for Hutch: Not to get too detailed here (or in your answer), but after the FF dance, we headed up on the hill to UB for food and beverages and then to WP. On the way to WP we walked past the place you and I first met, right? And my memory says we also went across the cartwheeling place and at that point something happened which stressed us out... Has my memory simply embellished and so you have no idea what I am talking about???    I ask this question because I'm seriously beginning to doubt my memory on this point and am wondering if I've made that whole incident up. If you  don't  know what I'm talking about, next time we do lunch, we need to talk about the FF dance so you can tell me what  did  happen that night! :) Or e-mail me. Soon. I'm getting old. I dreamed about JW the other night. He was a doctor. *cough*

       Today's run was for Paul N, brother to Danny, who just passed away. He has throat cancer so I'm adding him to my inspiration list immediately.       &nbsp;    Today's miles: 4.2    Total so far: 148.1    Still to go for goal: 351.9      &nbsp;   We also learned today that another person on the inspiration list, Bernie O, is in remission! This is miraculous!&nbsp;I am&nbsp;not usually a&nbsp;pessimistic person, but I did not expect to hear good news today when I saw his wife for the first time in months. There was some serious snoopy dancing going on when we heard...&nbsp;      (yahoo! Looks like I'll be able to add another 10th of the way duckie after my next run - only have to go another 1.9 miles for that!) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;

      We all joke around here about how there are basically two seasons - winter and construction... You are either dealing with driving in snow and ice and the lousy roads that those cause or else you have to deal with road construction and traffic problems caused by that and all of the rerouting going on.  &nbsp; Well, if that wasn't bad enough, last weekend it was  urlLink mayfly  season! wtf?

       Hey Dad! Look what I had working this evening!!! AND how clean and shiny???&nbsp;   &nbsp;    But might&nbsp;I ask whatever possessed you to hook up that damn switch in the seat again???       urlLink      urlLink   &nbsp;      &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;    Luckily when I  did  start to get out of my seat&nbsp;so I could&nbsp;attach the bungie&nbsp;to the grass&nbsp;chute I was moving slowly and carefully and sat back down really  fast  when the blades began to falter. Then I drove back up to the house, stuck my&nbsp;DEET covered fingers in my mouth and whistled.   LOUD.  &nbsp;'Cuz I've got big brothers and learned that cool trick when I was a&nbsp;kid and I'm cool like that.        &nbsp;    Keith heard me and came running outside to figure out what was going on. I had him hook up the bungie and get me my cell phone in case I had any incidents&nbsp;  (like getting stuck)   in which he'd have to come out and help me so I could call the house since I wouldn't&nbsp;be able to get off the tractor and push myself out.      &nbsp;   And it was a totally successful mow! Aside from the push mowing which I'll have to do when I get back tomorrow, I'm done! It didn't quit on me at all. I didn't get stuck once and I never accidently hit the reverse pedal. Yahoo!     &nbsp;   And   urlLink  Kathy   , the drink of choice in MY cup holder happens to be 40% DEET. heh. Take that  suckers .

       Just returned from much driving again. Had to run Mom to the airport where she was jetting off to Dallas in a spur of the moment decision to visit a friend in need after the death of one of Mom's high school classmates&nbsp;(who also happened to be&nbsp;the friend's husband). She was on the phone with Carolyn (her friend) and Carolyn simply asked, "Will you please come?" Mom checked on flights and decided to go for it.    &nbsp;  My whole family was saddened to hear of Dan's death. He was a great guy - funny, opinionated, generous and loving. RIP Waldo. We'll miss you.     &nbsp;  After the airport I brought Dad back home, stopped in the old hometown for gas and a carwash and the streets were crowded with people visiting the Music and Arts Festival so I thought, "Why not?" I wandered around for a little while stopping at all of the art booths. I avoided all of the greasy food booths even though the mini-donuts smelled divine.     &nbsp;  From there I stopped at the cemetary where I realized I hadn't visited since my grandmother's funeral 18 months ago. Dad had just been there watering flowers I noticed. He said he was heading that way. I offered but he said it would give him something to do.     &nbsp;  Then it was off to the grocery store where I picked up everything I needed for   urlLink  this   . I'm going to make it next weekend and if it turns out okay (yes a test run), I'll make it again the following weekend for Kel's homecoming. And then we'll all drop over from the extra cholesterol. :-)    &nbsp;  Things are starting to cool off and now that I know I have to get Keith to a dentist appointment tomorrow morning and then to his apartment instead of having the whole day for mowing, I think I might go get some of that done now. You know, if the mower works and all that.  *cough*     &nbsp;  Gonna run today, Ker? Well, duh. Later.

       The other day when dad was over for tractor maintenance and repair, we ended the day in worse shape than we started with there being no connection whatsoever to the mower blades. We couldn't get them to make any sort of firing at all in the switch when we had finally found the electrical component where that was happening.     He sent me home with a package of fuses yesterday and we crossed our fingers. I told him I'd give him a call and let him know the results. A clicking in the switch when I pull up on the reverse pedal would mean we were at least back to square one (phew!) and that would be exciting news.     I got home and had groceries to put away and a few other things to take care of, but a few hours later, I was finally able to go out and put the new fuse in and give it a shot.  CLICK.   Much rejoicing and snoopy dancing in the garage was observed by all daughters present...     I called Dad with the message, "We have clicking, we're back to square one!" and let him know that I was confident that I would be out there mowing on Monday. We'll see. I'll need as much luck as   urlLink  Kathy    is looking for today.

      Today I ran for the last of  urlLink Krush's  requests, and I believe her Grandpa Ed.    Today's miles: 5.17   Total so far: 186.17   Still to go for goal: 313.83   Had a good (but HOT) run in the old hometown again today. Did a little tour of the cemetery right in the middle of things to give myself a little break and get out of the sun for a couple of minutes. While there I splashed a little water on my face and stayed in the shade and looked for some significant gravesites. Found some, Missed some. When I took off again, things had really clouded over for the last couple of miles, thankfully.  Met Miss Marge for writing prior to the run. We got our topics from her mom again. Had enough time for an extra again. That works out really well. Next week I'm going to pop out here on Thursday if I think of it and ask any readers who are around to send in suggestions, so I hope people will send a few in. All we want are sentence fragments or words that we can just go from. Nothing fancy. For example, today we had the following (I don't have my notebook right in front of me, Marge, so forgive me if I butcher them or forget something):   the sunflowers were ripe   itchweed   there was a strong wind from the north   We had enough time to add a fourth, and since tonight there will be a blue moon, we wrote on (oddly enough!) blue moon! :)  Now I'm going to put together a welcome home banner for Kel because she's coming home tonight. Then I have to hit the grocery store and put some food in the house. Again because she's coming home tonight. I think she'd like it if there was something here for her to eat. Maybe.

      I'm back to  urlLink Krush's  Inspiration list tonight for my run... I ran for Don B, who had brain cancer. Unless I have him out of order, I think he was her Uncle. Hope I got that right, sweetie.    Today's miles: 5.75   Total so far: 181   Still to go for goal: 319   I ran in the old hometown again tonight and only did part of my mileage running up on the hill in the old neighborhood. Afterwards, I ran down Third Street Hill (tricky) and stopped by the band shell where the Community Band was giving a concert so I had a rest and a listen for about an hour, meeting my mom there. Then we walked back to their house which finished off my mileage.   Now I'm going to shower, do some more writing and get to bed. I started my day with writing, housecleaning and more writing. It was a good day.

      Well, the headache never dissipated, but I did manage a fast walk just the same. After spending the remainder of the afternoon post-sumac fighting and mowing just sitting around the house waiting for the pain to go away, I decided to get off my butt and ignore it. So I showered and spiffed up and grabbed my notebook, one of my current reads, my list of errands, and headed to town.   First stop was the co-op where I had to pick up a special order for Keith. From there I thought I would go to the old hometown for some writing and/or reading at our favorite postal coffee shoppe. As I drove up, I was thrilled to see there was plenty of parking right in front! With good reason. They had closed half an hour before I got there...   So I continued on to Borders as I had a price discrepancy on our last purchase. Seems like everytime we go there lately they either overcharge us for something or double charge us for something! It's amazing. Got myself a caramel mocha (a freebie because I had a full drink card - made it worth the drive over there!) and perused the shelves for about an hour... Then I sat down to finish my drink and do some writing, but there was a magazine sitting there with a blurb on the cover saying they had an interview inside with  urlLink Christopher Walken . Couldn't pass that up! (Oh, and Mark? Same magazine also interviewed  urlLink Kirsten Dunst ! What a goldmine! Great photos, too...) So I read that first. I did get a little writing in... Spent nearly three hours there and didn't spend a penny! Not their favorite customer of the night, I'm sure...  Finally I headed back to the old hometown, stopped to see the folks and find out how their dinner out with friends was and changed into my tennie bummers... Went for a fast walk in the dark (how else do you walk in the dark?). It was a great night for walking, just the right temperature, a nice breeze to keep the skeeters away, and enough of a moon to keep it from being  too  dark.   And the stats for Mary Ellen...   Today's miles: 3   Total so far: 175.25   Still to go for goal: 324.75   Haven't heard their plan of action with treatment, but I wish her the best.

      Had to add another name to the inspirations list today...  I  hate  it when I have to do that. It makes me so sad.   Today's name is Mary Ellen. She's a friend of my parents'. My mom called them today because she hadn't heard from them for a while. Her husband Dan answered the phone and he didn't sound like himself. She asked if everything was okay. He told her they were going through some stuff but that he was going to let Mary Ellen tell her and put his wife on the phone.   She has colon cancer and when they found it, it had already moved into the liver. Sorry to hear about it Mr. and Mrs. S...   That's all I know for now. If my head feels well enough to take a run later, I'll be running for Mary Ellen... I hope the storm that's brewing moves through and gives the barometric pressure some relief. I think that's what's causing my headache...

       Who puts sumac in a garden???  My landscapers, that's who. And at the time, I didn't know anything about plants or gardening and I simply said, "Our house is in the woods... we want our foundation plantings to fit in with the surroundings and I want them easy to care for because I know nothing about taking care of them and don't want to have to be out there all year fussing over them. So please plant easy-care plants."   They put in a  lot  of plants. Far more than we really needed. For the most part they were things that didn't need a lot of care. For the most part, they are beautiful. Some of them died. This past winter, we lost four rose bushes. I balked when they brought the rose bushes out. "Roses need a lot of care," I said.   "Not these roses," they assured me. And for several years, they thrived with no real input from me, other than pinching off the dead buds and trimming back the stuff that hung over the lawn and caught me when I had to mow (damn thorns). But this was a difficult winter with little snowcover and cold temperatures until late in the game. I guess that's what did them in.   And then there was the sumac. Very natural looking in our forest setting. But also very aggressive. Did I say aggressive? I actually meant barbaric. They planted three (  THREE!  ) sumac in our foundation plantings... one in the front yard and two in the back, rather close together and just behind the back patio. We had this done about five summers ago and last summer I realized they were growing to gigantic proportions and blocking the view of the forest from our windows, blocking the sunlight from our home, blocking the little animals of the forest from access to our yard (heh, just kidding)... So I bought myself a large ( sharp ) pair of pruning shears (grrrrr), and hacked them back. Waaaaaaay back.   This made the little sumac get even more rapacious. They began to spread their roots far and wide, popping up everywhere. They came up beside each of the surrounding plants, just randomly within the rocks, and all along the retaining wall behind them. It was ridiculous. Something had to be done. So this year? When they shot up to their record twelve foot height in the spring? and spread far and wide before the summer heat had even come to Wisconsin? I got the shears off their nail on the garage wall, and I gutted them. I pulled as many roots free of the rocks as I could, and I bought Roundup weed killer. I poured it on every bit of the roots I could find and sprayed what I could on the small plants that were growing in the rocks to get their roots.   Where am I going with this story? Dad came out and we got the mower and blades going today. We got the grass mowed in record time because of the dry spell of the past week (couldn't mow everything because not everything had grown)... And then? We dug those dead root balls out of the ground. And when I saw how far reaching those roots went within the rocks both over and under the black plastic used for the landscaping? I was reminded of that day earlier this summer when I attacked and killed the little (HAH) sumac plants and discovered those roots.  If you've read along with me this far, You have to be totally bored today and you'll enjoy the ending to my story. :) The day I tugged and pulled those roots and drove myself absolutely crazy in the sun and heat finding how far-reaching they really went, amazed by the shear number of them (I think that heat was getting to me...) I finally grabbed my cell phone and called our house to wake my daughter up, knowing that calling her was a better way to talk to her than banging on her window or going inside...    Her:  Hello?  Me:  Kel! I've figured it out! I know the secret of the Matrix!  Her:  What?  Me:  I know the secret of the Matrix!  Her:  Oh. My. God. What are you talking about???  Me:  The secret of the Matrix!!! I figured it out!  Her:  Okay Mother. What is it?   Me:  It's sumac!  Her:  I WAS SLEEPING!   Me:  But you should see these ROOTS!  CLICK   I swear sometimes she has no sense of humor. Or that she thinks I'm insane. One of the two. But it all came back to me today anyway when Dad and I were pulling up the root balls. Which were totally trapped within the Matrix. Heh.

      The following is something Keith left in my comments. I thought I would do an actual post about it so that more readers would see it. I hope if any of you have ideas you'll leave a comment. I know that there are lurkers who don't comment (according to the blog stats), so lurkers, if you come up with anything at all, please don't be shy! He'd like to hear from you, too!  There are readers of this blog who have lots of good ideas. So, I'll ask you to help me with ideas on this topic. The week after next I go into the hospital for a week or so of testing. They will have me wired from head to foot. They tell me I will be in bed the entire time. And, probably for about 3 days of it they won't allow me to sleep. So, what can I do to pass the time in a hospital bed for days on end? Electronic equipment isn't allowed in the room. And, everything is closely monitored. Visits from the outside are pretty restricted (sorry, Keri). The nurse told me that she has seen old man farmers take up knitting just to find something to do during this testing! I've got a stack of books to read. But, that might be a challenge when I hit 72 hours without sleep. So, any ideas on what to do to pass the time? Knitting just doesn't sound like my bag! I leave that to the old men farmers. Thanks!

       urlLink     either leave your answers or a link to your webpage with your responses.   Would you rather:  live with a tribe of pygmies in the amazon for a year  OR    live with three of your ex-boyfriends  /girlfriends for three months?  I think I left things on pretty decent terms with ex-boyfriends and could co-exist peacefully enough for three months... Living in the amazon for a year with anyone would kill this little girl, I'm afraid.    produce enough saliva to fill two buckets daily    OR  produce enough ear wax to fill a cup daily?  Oh dear. This one is a tad nasty, isn't it? Ummmm. I guess the saliva thingy. I'm swallowing a lot and having to visit the little girls room frequently but I can hear, eh?  be caught spying on your neighbor undressing  OR    be caught digging through their trash?    I'd rather explain that I'm just looking for a bit of junk to decorate "shabby chic" with than be considered a perv...    eat a live ladybug    OR  a dead snail? EW? After the kabillions that Dad washed out of the spiderwebs behind the gutters this afternoon, this question had to be asked? but a tiny little ladybug would go down real fast compared to a snail, I think. (heh - specially with that double bucket of saliva I've got going for me.)     Play along at  urlLink TJ's blog ...

      So the other day when Dad stopped by he noticed something at my house.   Later when Keith and I stopped by his house he asked, "Have you looked  up  lately when you're around your front door to see that you have trees growing out of your rain gutters?"   I hadn't, of course. Frankly, I don't ever use my front door, and when I'm driving up to the house, I'm usually concentrating on the garage door opener and whether or not the garage door is actually opening and if it is opening all the way or not. I told him I'd seen a squirrel up there eating the seeds just the other day, though. That's because   urlLink Devil Dog, Hound of Hell (aka Spawn of Satan)  &nbsp;was barking madly out the front window at said squirrel while sitting in his little perch on the window seat in the office as I blogged one morning...   So there had been a gathering of leaves and upon that gathering another gathering of maple seeds and now those maple seeds were begining to sprout into cute little maple trees in one area where the leaves had thickened enough to trap a goodly amount of moisture.   We've had a dryspell for several days, and we're expecting rain tomorrow afternoon, so once I'd finished my run today, Dad wondered what I was doing next. Thought it might be a good time to clean out those gutters. Before the rain. While the stuff was still good and dry. He cleaned them out last time for me while they were disgustingly wet.   Well, I couldn't think of a single thing I needed to do this afternoon, so I told him to come on out and keep an eye on the ladder for me while I climbed up and down and cleaned them out. They were some cute little trees! Once done, he dragged the hose up and flushed it through. We also got rid of a paperwasp nest in the corner that we'd agitated during our work. A evening's work...   Thanks Dad!!    But what is that poor squirrel going to find to eat now?

        What is the best book you've read this year?  From "If (Questions for the Game of Life)" If you could, in retrospect, thank one teacher you had in school for what they taught you, who would it be, and what would you thank them for?"  (I was going to ask you to limit this to the old hometown so that I would actually know who you were talking about, but that's hardly fair - this is open to all of your school experience through college and seminars you've been to - religion classes, whatever...)     (Question for Hutch is a daily segment where I ask an old school chum of a mine a question - in order to continue conversating with her, just because I like to chat with mah friend!)

      I believe today's inspiration, coming again from  urlLink Krush , is another of her Aunts. But with Krush on hiatus from blogging these days, I can't just pop over to her blog and ask her to come and fill us in.    Today's miles: 4.75   Total so far: 172.25   Still to go for goal: 327.75   I ran around the old hometown today. Even took a few turns around the track since it was open, but the hot black surface and somewhat enclosed area was so much warmer than when I was out on the street so I only did a mile in there. I do like the more springy surface, though!  Once on the road again, I ran into another aquaintance. He happens to be the father of someone who was in school with me for just a couple of years when I was really young. Only back then, he didn't know he was this kid's father! Yes, it's all very fascinating and such. I learned all about it a few years back when I was waiting in the same loooooooong line he and his wife were waiting in. I recognized them as being old neighbors and introduced myself. They hadn't recognized me since I was all grown up and had been just a little tyke. Anyway, as we were talking, he suddenly asked me if when I was young, had I played with this certain little boy. I said, "Sure I did! I remember him well and always wondered what happened to him because he moved away!"   So Mr. X said, "Well, a few years ago he came and knocked on our door and said, Mr. X? I don't know how to tell you this, but you're my dad."  Well, today I saw Mr. X out watering his lawn and letting his beautiful puppy run through the sprinkler - that was adorable! - and asked him if he thought Joe would want to come to our next class reunion. He thought maybe he would, so I'm going to contact him when I'm collecting addresses and as long as Joe is only as far away as the Twin Cities, we'll get him an invitation, too.   Wow, what was I thinkin' yesterday? The weekend was over and I totally forgot to get back to Q4H! I'll have to ask two today! Coming up...

      Just finished reading  urlLink  The Pact: A Love Story   by Jodi Picoult. It's also a Lifetime Original Movie, but my not being one with a TV, I won't have the opportunity to see it. I have a feeling this is probably one of those stories where the book is better than the movie. I'm not usually very fond of made for TV movies anyway.  Powerful story. Serious issues. One issue left in the dark throughout leads to the destruction of lives...

      We had an interesting meeting yesterday at the party. Just as we were preparing to leave for the airport, an older gentleman came up to us and stopped Keith. "Hey brother! I see you have a scar there on the side of your head. It matches the one I have on the opposite side of my head. Mine is from an aneurysm..."   And the two of them were deep in conversation, which left Keith feeling very grateful once again. Grateful that he is able to work and live his life fairly close the way he always had prior to his brain tumor. Our new friend had been a banker, but the aneurysm, being on the left side, left him unable to work with numbers and do the calculations he needed to do in his work. So he was left unable to continue his career. We were so glad he sought Keith out before we left. A little moment of grace in a hectic day...

      I think that's what my nephew must be calling me. Because on Saturday when I followed him around to all of his games, his poor team had really bad luck and lost every one. It was definitely not their day. While they had some decent plays, the other teams were smacking that ball and grabbing it out of the air in unbelievable ways, plus our guys had a few sloppy mistakes besides.   But yesterday? You know, when I couldn't go to any of the games? They won! Yes, every single game. For the championship of the tournament. Uh huh. When I wasn't there to see it.   I think my nephew is going to request that dear Aunt Keri just not bother to come and watch him play anymore. Or I won't hear about the games. Or maybe I'll hear about them but I'll get the wrong field location or the wrong starting time or something. Cuz I've gotta be a jinx. Poor guys. Sorry B!

      Stretch!   Lazy Monday... Beautiful fair morning - lovely weather. Been reading a book... summer beach reading basically. Heading out for a run... Going to fuss a little with the format around here because I'm in the mood for redecorating but not for a lot of hard work, LOL!   Then I'll make a few phone calls about a Box...  Mondays.

      I'd like to run today. Really I would. But it's just so busy around here and I really have to allow for a good 90-minutes to do it.   So I just don't think it's going to happen.   Because in a mere 35 minutes we are going to have to have the car loaded for the evening's portion of events so that we can take a wander over to our neighbor's house for their party.  They are having a little get together. Nothing fancy. I should call it git together. That's closer. Just a bunch of us local yocals gathering together for their porch warming party. That's the new porch attached to the barn... The one built to hold all of the antiques and junk they've been gathering... It will give me a chance to pull on those old jeans and boots I was  urlLink yammering  about yesterday after all. Not that anyone was paying attention. Blogs are so quiet on the weekend!   We won't be able to stay long because I need to pick up dad and get Keith back to his apartment and pick mom up from the airport when her flight comes in. And there is the traffic and the construction and getting mom and dad back home.   So ya'll will understand if I don't run again today. It'll give those blisters one more day to heal. And the sunburn on my shoulders... *sigh* But I  do  want to be running.   Tomorrow  is  another day.

      Lisa from way back in grade school with red hair and strange expressions to verbalize did  not  say "I like ice cream" as I said earlier this week. Her expression  was  "I like onions!" I stand corrected by myself. I woke up to her voice in my head Thursday morning around 5 am. Another of her expressions was also blasting through my memory at that time but has since slipped back into the subconscious.   I'll let ya'll know if it comes back, though. Until then, I'll leave you hanging on the edge of your seats.

      Stolen from  urlLink Lucy ...  1) First Grade Teacher:  Mrs. Iverson. She was so cool – and gave me such confidence. I was a good reader and got to be a reading assistant to other kids. When they sat in front of the class to read aloud to others, I sat beside them and helped them on the words they didn’t know.  2) Last word you said:  Bear!  3) Last song you sang:  "Well it’s a marvelous night for a moon dance…" (I’ve got Michael Buble’s cd in my car and when I’m driving anywhere alone or with Kel, I crank it and I/we sing along at the top of our lungs.)  4) Last person you hugged:  Keith just now as I realized we were so busy loading the car with his stuff in a hurry to get back last night to get Kel and her friend on time from the play that we didn’t even hug hello!  6) Last time you said “I love you":  last night to Kel in the car on the way to town – she’s really having a tough couple of days after making some bad choices not using her brain so much as her heart  8) What’s in your CD player:  car – Michael Buble, bedroom – John Mayer’s Heavier Things, kitchen – Meet Joe Black soundtrack *sigh*, portable – Tom Petty and the Heartbreaker’s “Best Of” for running  9) What color socks are you wearing:  barefoot  10) What’s under your bed:  lots o’ dust and dog hair  11) What time did you wake up today:  10ish for the last time  12) Current taste:  water from taking my meds and clariti*n  13) Current hair:  short but not spikey today with just a few grays still.  14) Current clothes:  just replaced my nightie with yesterday’s clothes so I could run downstairs in the room Kel and her friend slept in to look for something  15) Current annoyance:  the fact I haven’t showered yet, heh  16) Current longing:  chocolate   17) Current desktop picture:  David M. Bailey playing at the concert we attended last year with the local folk group which accompanied him and the beautiful pipe organ of the church as the backdrop behind them. It’s my own photo from the concert, but I think there is something similar on his website that I’ll  urlLink link  to if I can find it. You can't really see him in this photo, but the guy playing drums in the back reminds me a lot of the photo of  urlLink Mark  on his website. You don't have a drummer in your family who lives up in Minnesota, do you Mark?  18) Current worry:  Kel has some problems with friends.  20) Story behind your username:  I’m not really using my user name. I have a user name of KinnicChick and the story is a local thing.  21) Current favorite article of clothing:  don’t know if I can pick just one thing. I just bought a skort from title ix that is really comfy and easy. Also bought a t-shirt dress that I love that is comfy and easy. Also bought a little black dress that is kinda sexy and cute and makes me feel pretty that I’ll be wearing to Phantom tomorrow (not from Title IX). And I love my comfortable low rise levis jeans.   22) Favorite physical feature of the opposite sex:  it’s always been about the hands. I fell in love with the look of Keith's hands first. I could tell they were an artist's hands. He was a woodworker and had those strong and thin hands - sensitive.   23) Last CD that you bought:  shiza, I can’t remember. Thinking… I think it was Jason Mraz’s Waiting for my Rocket to Come.   24) Favorite place to be:  Home  25) Least favorite place:  sitting in traffic.  26) Time you wake up in the morning:  when I have to. Used to be a lot later. I’m becoming an earlier riser. I wake up a lot earlier when the shades are open. Go figure.  27) If you could play an instrument, what would it be:  the piano. I do okay, but I’d be lots better with my left hand.  28) Favorite color:  green froth – the color of the walls in my office and sun room.  29) Do you believe in an afterlife:  yes, but more in a nextlife kinda way.  30) How tall are you:  5'4'  31) Current favorite word/saying:  Not my favorite, but seemingly stuck in my vernacular at the moment... "I'm just saying..." Maybe we should call this current overused phrase and just shoot me whenever I use it...  32) Favorite book:  The English Patient and To Kill A Mockingbird and Pride and Prejudice (tie)  33) Favorite season:  Autumn  34) One person from your past you wish you could go back and talk to:  Mr. Nederloe  35) Favorite day:  Every one  36) Where do you want to go:  Lots of places, actually.  37) What is your career going to be like:  writer for hire! Heh…  38) How many kids do you want?  just the one I’ve got  39) What kind of car will you have:  mini cooper  40) Type a line you remember from any book:  “Ma ma ma Mice Aroma” from the book of misheard song lyrics…   41) A random lyric:  "Well I won't back down, no I won't back down  You can stand me up at the gates of hell  But I won't back down   Gonna stand my ground, won't be turned around  And I'll keep this world from draggin' me down  Gonna stand my ground and I won't back down   Hey baby, there ain't no easy way out  Hey I will stand my ground  And I won't back down.   Well I know what's right, I got just one life  In a world that keeps on pushin' me around  But I'll stand my ground and I won't back down   Hey baby there ain't no easy way out  Hey I will stand my ground  And I won't back down  No, I won't back down" Tom Petty, of course

      This one was for my dear Diva friend KathyC's Uncle Matt. And it was a great run!   The sun was bright and there was a nice breeze (thank goodness). I'd had a couple of cups of coffee so I was slightly worried about dehydration from the caffeine so I did have a bit of water at the folks' before I took off on my determined route. Still, when I got out to the furthest point, and was on that black pavement, and seemed to be totally surrounded by tall weeds, trees, a few houses, just enough high stuff that the wind wasn't reaching me... I was HOT. And parched.  Not titched, Jena, just parched - inside joke...  :)   There is a hill early in the route - a large hill (going up toward JL's housing development from our class, his parents still live there - Hutch) and while I've been running all the way up it, I've been nearly dying at the top and soon after, having to walk for a few steps once I get up there until I catch my breath. Yesterday, a great Petty song came on half a mile before the hill (quarter mile maybe) and made me smile like a dope. I've increased my pace because I really wanted to push myself on this one and I asked myself "Why the heck are you smiling?" Oh yeah, I'm crazy like that - talking to myself in my head all the time while I'm running. I'm goofy like Hutch said.   Better yet, I answered myself. "I'm smiling because it is a gorgeous day out here and I've got kicka$$ music playing in my ears and because I'm healthy enough to be doing this. And I'm smiling because I'm about to run all the way up that damn hill. And I'm going to smile all the way up. In fact, I'm going to smile all the way through the rest of this run. People driving by me are going to think I'm nuts."  I kicked butt on that hill. I ran up it with ease.   Okay. That's an exaggeration. But I did run up it with a smile on my face. And it was a genuine smile. And I didn't walk at the top. I kept running. I ran nearly the entire 5.5 miles. Except the usual warmup. Which I think I walk too much of because if I walked less of that I'd probably be stronger for the run. And I walked a decent cool down, too. Because I just really enjoy that walking/practically strutting back to the house when I'm done. Grinning like an idiot.   Is this what they mean when they talk about a runner's high? I've never really experienced that. I don't think. Unless this is it. This weird talking to myself and grinning like a dope. And enjoying the music and the day. Whatever it is, I'll just keep on doing it. Because I'm still having fun. I'll stop when it isn't fun anymore.    Today's miles: 5.5   Total so far: 206.97   Still to go for goal: 293.03   Don't know if I'll get a run in today. But maybe I should, as  urlLink Lisa  put it, get some miles on that new swimsuit. She's right about summer being nearly over. Maybe Kel and friend would like to go up to the folks' and go swimming for a bit today.   Looks like rain right now, though. Only a short blip on the radar. One can hope.

       Anybirthday(dot)com used to be a great service. But like all free services, they added a paid extension to their website and sank right into the gutter. Now the free part just sucks. At least that's my experience. I went there to luck up a birthday and an hour after entering the search criteria, it is still cranking away. Searching. Didn't use to take that long. It used to be quick. But I'm not using their Plus service. 'Cuz I'm cheap like that. And don't tell me every web site has gotta make a living. They had advertisements for their other for pay stuff on there when they were a freebie only thing. I think.     Keith goes into the hospital for his tests on Monday morning. He's had updates finally after talking with the nurse who normally sets all of this up (she had been on vacation). He can have visitors any time and all of the time. She said the most difficult thing to fight during this week is boredom. And she couldn't stress that enough. But he thinks his boredom genes were wiped out when he fought the brain tumor. He says he is incapable of becoming bored. I still haven't found him a Rubik's cube, but as he says he has solved it once in the past, that's okay. I told him that was prior to having some of his brain removed and challenged him to solving it again  now . But I'm betting Mr. Smarty would have it done quickly the first day. He has a VCR/TV in the room, but he's really not a movie/TV guy, as he  urlLink said . Does anyone else have any further suggestions to add to the great ones he's gotten already?    Hutch? Can I just say I'm totally  urlLink jealous ? Happy Birthday to you indeed!!!    Writing went well with our pile of little papers in the middle of the table from which Maniacal Mannered Marge plucked out topics for us to do our timed exercises... We got through a record five topics before I had to dash off to get Keli to field show practice. She didn't seem to have any arguments about the writing practice blog, so once we get the details figured out on how she'll get her writings into the blog (she's never blogged before), we'll get it online and connected to this somehow for anyone who might be interested in checking in on ideas they have submitted (or just laughing at our practice - sometimes we get a little goofy on caffeine). Thanks again for the topics you sent! And I see we've received another since then... I'll have to have a special place for them to be submitted so they all get dumped to the same spot and I don't lose any. Maybe when I get the other blog public.    Didn't get any mileage on the swimsuit yesterday, alas...  Did  get some more mileage on the running shoes instead, though. That wouldn't have happened without the cancellation on our other plans, so it all worked out okay. Although I would have rather had the chance to catch up with Pooh. Soon! Maybe Hutch will be able to join us  that  day with a little advanced warning.     My lilacs are starting to bloom again. Nothing like a long enough summer to get two blooms from one plant! I thought perhaps I would see three sets of nestlings from one pair of Eastern Wood Peewee's, too. But they took off after just two.     Got to visit with a paternal Uncle and his wife last night. It was great to see them again. Last time they were in town was their surprise visit for my parents' 50th wedding anniversary bash a couple of years ago when you could have knocked me over with a feather as I caught sight of them. This time they are here for his 45th High School class reunion at Kel's school. He went to the hometown's big rival too! It was fun to look at his yearbook last night and see how little things have changed about that book in the basics with Kel's current annual.    So ends this installment of more random bullets... Time to shower and brush the sweaters off my teeth. Cappuccino tastes good while I'm drinking it, but afterwords? Meh... not so much.   But first, I'll post yesterday's mileage...

      It's supposed to be a nice day tomorrow with highs in the upper 70's and sunshine... Pooh and I are meeting at 12:15 at the HS (she doesn't know where the folks' place is) to go swimming at the folks'. Would you like to join us? If you don't have anything better to do and the boys are in the mood that is. There isn't a diving board or cool toys or anything. Just one small regular slide - not at all like your really cool water park pool. Think about it. And if it appeals to you, come on up! I'm sure she'd love to see you!

       Why does it sound like a war zone around here tonight? I suppose someone must be setting off fireworks or something. It's loud. And it isn't anywhere close to the fourth of July anymore. hmmm.    My daughter wasn't able to go see Bren's play tonight. It was sold out when I called at 6 pm to listen to info about tickets. Maybe tomorrow night. So she went to a party at another one of her ex-boyfriend's house instead. Have I mentioned lately that I wouldn't be 16 again for nuttin'? I don't care how social her life is. It sucks to be a teenager. I had a steady boyfriend all through high school. My life was relatively calm. And I still wouldn't go back and do it all again.  Yuck.     I cleaned my house today. It's a Thursday thing to do. It's a good thing for a Thursday because on Friday the hubby comes home for the weekend and the house starts out in a kind of nice state this way. Doesn't stay that way for long with bringing his suitcase and a cooler and boxes and such in the door and him living out of those things for the weekend and stuff coming here from the apartment and then stuff going there from here that it's been discovered that he needed and vice-versa. But come Sunday night after I load him up and take him back over there, I can usually put things in their place relatively easily before heading to bed and start the week off in a pretty calm state. After two and a half years of this, I've almost got a routine down. Geeze, it took me long enough!    Kel has ended up with a really ripe sunburn after all her work in the afternoons on the field show this week (with an spf50 sunblock on). Only six more days of it before they get to perform what they've got so far for all us parents and we have the big cookout. The kids knock themselves out for two weeks learning as much of the show as they can and then show their stuff. Then when school starts they work on it some more during a class on marching an hour a day during the fall quarter. They'll have one competition in September about mid-month. That will be the first. Then nearly every weekend in October they'll travel around the state doing other competitions. It's my favorite month of the year. I love following them around, videotaping and predicting scores and winners. The show promises to be a good one this year. And Kel is a nervous wreck because she has a solo and will be front and has to stand up on a  box  to perform it and that's  much  more "in your face" than the little two note show opener solo she did last year.    Mom treated me to a new swimsuit the other day. And I get to test it out in the pool tomorrow when I meet up with Pooh (not poo,  Pooh !) at the folks' and go swimming with her during her lunch break from work.    Russell Stover S'mores are  da bomb ! (and very dangerous - eat with caution... buy them singles if you can or have someone else buy them and dole them out to you if possible).    Kel and I watched  urlLink  Stand By Me   last night. We laughed a lot. It's a good old movie. I had remembered this from back in the mid 80's when I saw it in the theater, of course. Kel was skeptical in looking at the dvd packaging. I told her I was going to watch it and asked if she wanted to watch it with me. "Is that the one about the  boys ?" But she did join me and she did enjoy it. Most enjoyable? The music. Halfway through after loving everything heard so far she finally turned to me and said, "We have  got  to get this soundtrack." Yep, I raised a kid with well-rounded musical tastes... She's an eclectic one. And she's loading it all on her iPod.    Heard today that Ralph Fiennes, one of my favorite actors (well he's certainly not hard to look at!) will be playing Lord Voldemort in the next Harry Potter! I thought it sounded like a great match... He's played a couple of evil guys already (in Schindler's List and Red Dragon).   Well, that's enough of the random bullets for tonight. Stay tuned for Q4H. Then I'm gonna go do some of my own writing before I have to go get Kel from the party. I didn't make her find her own ride tonight. I should have. I'm sure someone could have gotten her home. I didn't like the immediate options available, however.

      Get those writing ideas in quick! Ms. Marvelous Magical Marge and I are meeting at 8 am and if I'm going to get them printed and take them along with us, I'll need your writing topics ASAP!  I've gotten some ideas from  urlLink Ken  and from Ziggy (aka my mom) so far, but I'd love even more! I slapped together a quick blog this afternoon that we can put the stuff we dash off out on if Mystical Miraculous Marge agrees to it and we decide to share the fun.  Keeping in mind this is just our "what we toss together in ten minutes" based on whatever topic we turn up. Throw out a topic and say "Go"... write for ten minutes keeping our pens moving and letting whatever come bubbling up from that topic flow out of the pen... You never know what you're going to get. And it is totally unedited... I'll keep you posted on that.  If you have a word, phrase or idea for us to write about at our favorite writing haunt, please comment   NOW!

      So, you prefer the multiple choice questions... okay, I'll come up with something easier tonight. Although I did just give you the easiest question   ever   the other day, if you'll recall... Ooooh! I found a multiple choice question the  MINUTE   SECOND  I opened up The Little Book of Stupid Questions! It must be fate because there aren't very many multiple choice questions in there! :) I guess it was meant for you.  And anyone else who wants to answer, please feel free. That was pretty fun yesterday! Especially since you all knew just who I was talking 'bout! You had me in stitches. Okay, here we go...   Given the choice between the following occupations, which would you select, assuming they all received the same level of compensation:     a highly successful professional magician     a highly successful professional ice skater     a highly successful professional clown     a highly successful professional exercise guru     (Question for Hutch is a daily segment where I ask an old school chum of a mine a question - in order to continue conversating with her, just because I like to chat with mah friend!)

      Yesterday's super-duper buttered microwave popcorn that's been sitting on the counter in a bowl is pretty soggy and disgusting this evening. It tends to stick in the teeth a lot.  The SCVST production of My Fair Lady is fabbo. If you are in this area, go see it. Eliza is wonderful, Freddy has a terrific singing voice, I could have listened to him sing all night (pun intended - I could have danced all night...), and of course, Kel's school mates Bren, Rusty and Laura were all in the show making it really fun to watch for me. GREAT JOB GANG!!! The first half was a little painful, not from the aspect of a bad show - it was great - but because I got there later and didn't have my ticket yet. I had to take what they gave me when I bought it. I ended up behind a rather tall gal, and beside another gal who had just had a smoke right before she came in and she came straight from the farm to the show, too. I think a lot of people at the theater tonight came in from the fields to attend. It was a ripe audience. That's what happens in this small town sometimes I think.   Anyway, I scoped out an empty seat on the aisle and two rows forward for the second half and moved up during intermission. I had a clear view of the whole stage and much cleaner air. The old gentleman to my left kept covering his nose and mouth through the first half too. I think he thought it was me. That was just sad. I was  urlLink looking  and smellin'  good  and that man thought it was me!  Well, now I wait for the kiddo to get home from another night out (she has quite the social life, don'tcha know) and then I get to go to bed. Tomorrow night she gets to see the play. Wait 'til she hears I'm going to make her come home afterward. She'll be torked, but I didn't get home until 11 and I came straight home. I have to get up early Friday morning and she's been out with friends and such all week. She'll survive.  Keep those writing ideas coming! What we don't get to this week, we'll use in the weeks to come! Thanks...  oooh. I need to do a Q4H! And she likes multiple choice. Putting on the thinking cap...

      It's true... I wanted to get myself another duck (as explained way back  urlLink here ). And I thought with only a little over six miles to go, I could do that in one run. And I'm sure that I could have today. But when I got within site of the folks' house after five miles, I just couldn't see going another whole mile.   It was a gorgeous day. Spectacular. Deep blue skies, sunshine, warm. I was lovin' it. I had run the fourth mile and had some hills. Finished that mile off and had to walk. Was breathin' heavy and thought, "That's it. I'm done runnin' for today. I've had it. And within about fifty yards of walking, I'm listening to Petty just jammin' along to  Free Falling  and I'm  running  again! So it was one of  those  kind of days. I felt great out there. And I still felt so good when I got done that I was dancing around in my folks' house. I think Dad thought I was goofy. Petty does that to me. I feel so healthy right now. Better than I have in years. I feel like I'm regaining my youth - aging backwards or something. But six miles? Nahhh. Leave that for the kids. :)   Today's miles: 5.3   Total so far: 198.47   Still to go for goal: 301.53   Thanks for all the great ideas for writing  urlLink Ken ! Actually, I haven't really read them yet, I only opened the comments up and noticed that you put a bunch of them out there... cool! I didn't read them because we like to go with them cold and not having thought about them in advance. I especially don't want to have any time ahead of Ms. Marge to think about them. But THANK YOU! I'd love to see more from others out there, too... Mom, you were asking me some questions when I was at your house yesterday, and those would make good writing topics, why don't you put those in the comments. At least that first one you asked me. Do you remember it?  You know , the one I couldn't/wouldn't answer at the time?   Gotta hit the showers. I stink/stank/stunk. And Kel is due outta field show practice soon. The old hometown band is doing their field show practice right now, too. It's kinda sad really. I told Kel that my old high school band is practicing for their field show, too. Her response???  "Booo!"  I'm raising my daughter in our rival high school! What have I done??? Know what else? I wouldn't go back to being 16 years old for anything.   How about you?

      Marge and I are meeting early on Friday for our writing date. And we want to write like the   wind !  (does that trigger any lyrics for you Ken? for me it brought up Bob Seeger, but I guess that's   Against  the Wind  and not exactly what we're going for here... heh). Anyway, we are looking for writing topics on which to expound, elucidate, extemporate, and expatiate for ten-minute periods of time (minimally) and   we want your fabulous (and even your lousy) ideas!    Please pop on out to the comments section, leave a word or a phrase or even a sentence with which to kick us off on our rants. If I can convince Ms. Marvelous Marge of the beneficence of the idea, I may kick off a whole new blog in which we post the results of these resplendent pieces of literary genius... *cough*

      There was a kid at our grade school waaaaaaaaaay back in the day... I don't remember if he continued on to Middle School or if he moved before then or not. He lived up in a house just below the water tower if I remember right - on the same street as you, only much closer to the cemetery. Do you remember him? Blonde, I think. Quiet guy. Nice. I ran past his house the other day and thought about him.  Reminded me of another child from our class who moved away in grade school, too. Lisa? Red hair... said very funny things... Talked Valley Girl way before Valley Girl was a thing. I think. Or am I remembering that wrong?  Gag me with a spoon...

      Ran in to another old friend today. She and I go back to... let's see... summer after my sophomore year of high school. We met on a trip out west that we were both involved with for a youth group. The group split into four or five different groups for a week of hiking in the mountains of Montana and a mutual friend convinced me to go in his group so I would get to know this girl better and would be able to hang out with them. I don't remember his logic, but I'm glad that I did. She and I became best friends on that trip and were inseperable after that. For a long time anyway.   Today as mom and I were going through the checkout line at Target I saw her enter the store and disappear. I handed mom the bag of stuff and told her that I'd meet her back at her house in a bit and that I was going to go try and find P if I could first and I headed in the direction I had last seen her. I circled the entire store before I finally found her. I snuck up behind her with, "Do you  feel  like you are being hunted? I've been circling this store looking for you ever since you walked in while I was checking out..."  She gave me a huge hug and said she was really glad that I had found her. We stood there talking for probably an hour before she finally had to leave to get her kids from their swimming lessons. We're meeting on Friday during her lunch. I'm really glad I saw her. I was just thinking this morning how it would be great to have a reunion of that youth group, too. I wonder if that will ever happen?  I suppose it's doubtful.

       urlLink     either leave your answers or a link to your webpage with your responses.   Would you rather:   be covered head to toe with 500 mosquito bites   OR  find a leech attached to your genitals?  I realize I've never had a leach removed from any part of my body, so I don't know what exactly that entails or how painful it might be if at all, perhaps it is a painless endeavor, but I don't want to experience it  there.    Ever .  Bring on the skeeters. I'm from Wisconsin. I'm used to them.     be blind for a month   OR  paralyzed for two weeks?   Nothing makes me more crazy than an inability to do something. I have got to be able to move. A month without sight would be very difficult (especially with how I need to be able to drive), but inability to move? Impossible.   have a skin condition that forces you to wear a wool  sweater  year-round  OR  wool underwear?   Can't stand wool against my skin. Think I'm allergic or something.   only be able to speak in rhyme  OR  only be able to speak in  haiku ?  How cool would THAT be? heh.

      Today's run was for Olga and Dorothy. They were requests coming from a business acquaintance of my parents who generously gave to the team when she heard about it shortly before the Relay in June. The kindness of strangers... Thank you, Lynn.   Today's miles: 3.5 (It's muggy right now, what can I say?)   Total so far: 193.17   Still to go for goal: 306.83   I feel like I'm  never  going to make 200 at this pace and get that next duck but it has been so hot and muggy when I've gone out the past couple of days. 6.83 miles isn't an impossible goal for tomorrow, unless it is again really hot and muggy. Maybe I can finish it off then. We'll see.   Today I went out with a tummy full of cappuccino, too.  That  was a mistake. Blech. Won't do that again.   Finally got a call back from my classmate about The Box. Onward. She had a surprise of her own to tell me. She's going to have a baby for her fortieth! Woot! There but for the grace...   We had quite a storm rip through here this morning. Bad enough that I left the comfort of my own bed and moved to the basement. It was a scary sounding thing. I bet as it moved off across the state, it made a few other friends of mine slightly nervous as well...

      Went to see Broadway Bound, a Neal Simon play put on at our local theater last night. It was really great. There is a local boy who we admire greatly when we get to see him and he has played Eugene in Brighton Beach Memoirs already at this same theater a few years back. I thought he was delightful then and was really looking forward to his portrayal here, too. We had a lot of fun. Kel thought this was the best play we'd seen there.   This week I'll have to get her to My Fair Lady at the University. Her friend Bren is playing in that.   And next weekend we're off to see Phantom of the Opera. I've been saying for a long time that if it came back to the Twin Cities I would have to take Kel. It was the first big production I ever saw back when Keith and I were first dating and I really loved it. Well, it's here again. It isn't at the Ordway, where I'd really prefer to see it, but I want to get Kel to it before she heads off to college and it too far away to join me. Hope she can stay awake through it with all of her marching this week!

      Keith's Grandpa was today's inspiration! Keith will comment tomorrow maybe and talk about him. He was such a cool man. I wish I had known him longer. I can still hear his voice telling us stories of when he was a young boy on the reservation. I loved to hear his stories.    Today's miles: 3.5   Total so far: 189.67   Still to go for goal: 310.33   I walked quickly tonight. Just a brief walk in the darkening skies. Mosquitoes were out but they couldn't catch me.   Kel's home! She had a great trip and she's full of tales from the west. When we can catch her at home and she isn't busy chatting online with her friends. She's been off to the Mall of America and IKEA today... tonight they're out swimming and tommorow she begins intensive field show training for the competitive marching band season is nearly upon us again... Has it been a year already?

      Phantom was most fabulous! Even though we forgot our opera glasses...  Dinner at the folks' afterwards was quite fun, too. Much of the family was there, though SIL Bonnie had to leave because she was in need of sleep before the midnight shift and so David and Jenn left with her. Cory was off working hard again.  Keith brought home more MST3K DVD's for us to enjoy, so enjoy we did. He and I watched The Atomic Brain Saturday night while Kel was off at the County Fair with her friends. He even made his famous malts!  Then Sunday night he was off to prepare for the hospital stay. Kel and I rented some movies that night and watched   urlLink House of Sand and Fog   together.  Another movie rented that I finally got to see last night, was   urlLink Return of the King  ...  It was so great! I'm so happy that I finally got to watch it. So  urlLink Lisa , WHAT SAY YOU?!!!! :)

      He made it through the first 24 hours of testing with flying colors. Unfortunately he hasn't given them anything great on the monitors from a testing point of view, which means they might make him stay awake all night again tonight, but he made it through the first night without difficulty. Of course, each night would get worse.   He doesn't look too bad after having to be awake all night the first night. Nurse Cratchet designed this test methinks... He's holding up some of the computer stuff showing how he's "hardwired" directly to the computer. His nurse Joe (a former computer guy himself) had renamed him Borg because of this latest development and said that each time Keith awoke he'd have a new body part made of metal...    cyborg(cy·borg)(sbôrg) n.  A human who has certain physiological processes aided or controlled by mechanical or electronic devices. a human being whose body has been taken over in whole or in part by electromechanical devices; "a cyborg is a cybernetic organism" Main Entry: cy·borg Pronunciation: 'sI-"bo(&)rg Function: noun : a bionic human    &nbsp; urlLink     urlLink     ============================================ Here he is wired up for the test that is happening all week. The red marks are simply from the marker they used to draw on him to let them know where to put the little "plugs." Kel says she thinks he looks like a science experiment from the middle ages. Something for Mystery Science Theater perhaps??? heh... A nice shot of his surgical scar here, too!  &nbsp; urlLink     urlLink     My mom came along with me today when I went to visit him. We arrived when he was having his lunch so we went up and had lunch in the hospital cafeteria. I'll know my way around the place pretty well by the end of the week. It's a nice place. They have several of the Charles Schultz statues around there - there is a Lucy right up on the floor Keith is on and a Charlie Brown down in the lobby. I'm sure there is a Snoopy around there somewhere, but I haven't stumbled across him yet. They have done a couple of the other characters in the past few years, too. I think Linus is around town, Snoopy's doghouse, someone else perhaps? I'm going to charge up the battery and maybe get a couple more shots in the coming days to put up.   With all of the extra running around I haven't gotten a chance to run, but it sounded like another friend of his would be stopping to visit him tonight and that means I definitely won't make another trip that direction, so I will probably take a run instead since I know I won't be heading into the cities. Last night it was up in the air whether I was going to drive that direction or not, so I didn't want to change and take the time to run not knowing.   Kel is having another good week with drill practice. She really seems to be enjoying her section this year. Three out of the four of them are getting together tonight for a movie even. This is good.   I have a Relay follow up meeting in a couple of nights. We'll get our plaque and any incentive prizes won.   Congratulations Marvelous Marge! You'll be moving into your new home at the end of the week and we'll have to miss our writing date because of it, but I can't imagine a more exciting reason to miss! Speaking of Marge, she was agreeable with the whole writing blog thing (did I say this already?) so we're going to get going on this and will post more as it is updated enough...  Can't wait to catch up with other blogs. Should have some time tonight maybe after running and getting Kel back from the movie if the computer isn't totally monopolized... heh, right.
