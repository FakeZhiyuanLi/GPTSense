      Well, its not really a  "LAN PARTY" , more of a "LAN get together", but anyways, tonight (in about 30 mins) Joe is coming over and we are playing RISE OF NATIONS. I am excited... I've never played LAN RoN. Okay well here is my day: woke up at 11 0' clock knowing that I already had plans from the night before to go and eat lunch with Joe and Dave B. So in a frenzy, I rush to my best friend Trillian, and talk to Joe. We all end up going to Chipotle (How I love thee...) and in the process pick up Mortonson. Then we go back to Joe's and we have an idea... Ryan brings up that in his Chem. class one time, his teacher did an experiment with a 2 liter bottle of pop, and 1 "mentos".(mento?) What happens to the pop is phenomenal, you drop the mento(s) in and within 3 seconds the pop literally explodes out of the bottle. We (I) could not prefect the simple task of screwing on the cap all the way. So we went through two 2 liter bottles of pop, and all we get out of it was sticky hands and wet shoelaces. Ahh... The good times we all have... I'll miss you guys when you go. Anyways, after that we went in Joe's house and watched some funny episodes of "Family Guy". I went home, got ready for work, watched the lightshow being displayed outside, and then wrote this. Did you know that the PIG produces more food products than any other animal out there... Even the COW! That is nuts, I mean how many tasty body parts can one animal have? I do not necessarily want to know what all of the parts are used for, (Read "The Jungle",such a cool book) but I can take a guess that a majority of the parts are used in Hot Dogs. So the next time you are at the ballpark debating whether to get a big bag of peanuts, or a nice juicy hot dog... Well you get what I mean.  That brings me to another question. When you think of baseball players, or even baseball in general, don't you think of sunflower seeds? So here is the real question, (if you answered yes to the last one) why don't they sell sunflower seeds to the audience? They keep your fingers just as busy as peanuts, or if you are like me its something to keep your mouth busy. Not to mention the mess factor, I don't think a lot of people get the peanuts at the ballpark for the taste, (mostly for the salt if it was for taste) yet for the mess that it makes. By the time you leave you pretty much feel like "Ahhh... I can go home... Look at this mess I made, HAHAHA, I don't have to clean it up! That is for the janitors." Well sir, sunflower seeds make about the same sized mess, if not bigger. Okay that is my randomness for the night.  Jeff slept: who cares? I hate this stupid gimmick... I'm getting a new one.  Adios!

      Ahhh.... I feel so relaxed after getting through last week. (AKA hell) I felt like I was in a blizzard walking against the wind, 30 degrees below zero, and I was naked. Now I feel like I am in a sweatshirt and sweatpants, and I am snuggled up in my warm bed, dreaming of happy things.  So anyways my main reason for posting here tonight (I have to have a reason, or else I wont post) is the whole "DB" issue. We are going to take a vote, use either the "Post Comment" feature or the "Chatter box" feature (found on the sidebar) to vote. Here is our question, "If you were/are my friend would you rather call me Dan, DB, or Kid?" There we go folks, the question of the night. Now for our "Mortonson Randomness" topic of the night... tonight's isn't very random.... But it is off the subject of everything else... My sister went to go see "The Day After Tomorrow" and said that it stunk. But, she did NOT want to go and see it in the first place. So, was she just saying that it stunk because she wanted to defend her case of not wanting to go and see it, or did it really stink? Well, this reporter thinks that it is "option A" I know my sister all a bit too well to say "option B". I still want to go and see that movie, I just don't really know when. I'll probably go when school is all said and done, but even then, I don't think so. Graduation is creeping 'round the corner, and I cannot help but feel sad.... It is hopeless, I am going to cry. Too many people whom I have grown to love are going away. I will now name them off and after all of the names are read we will have a moment of silence. But please, when I name the names no cat calls, cheers, or applause until ALL of the names are read. Carolynn L. Beal, Joseph A. Macaluso, Ryan Morton(son).... Yeah that's it. But hey! Don't just say that  is no reason to cry... THESE SENIORS (SENOIRS HEHE) ARE GREAT PEOPLE. :*-(  Well sir I'm off. I will blog again very soon! BYE!  Jeff slept: 11 hours (5 1/2 units) RAKING IT UP!

      Don't we just love being busy? This is actually not a sarcastic comment... It's TRUE! We love being busy, just so we can say that we are! That is not the only reason, busy-ness is just part of our keeping somewhat sane. What would I do if I wasn't busy? Psh, NOTHING! I'd get fatter, that's what! Wow. I am a bit riled up. I will continue to do these short sentences. Well, I know no one really wants to hear about me and my homework so here it is. Today: 2 1/2 hours of homework. Or if you have ever seen the movie, or read the book (I've done both) "About a Boy" By Nick Hornby, that homework took up 1 1/4 units. Gosh, I need a god book to cheer me up. IM TOO BUSY TO READ? NO! I JUST LIKE TO SAY THAT I AM. But seriously folks I am a bit busy lately, between work and homework and sleep (I've gotten too much, I take about a 1 unit nap after school everyday) there is hardly any time at all. Well who cares, right? I need a little bit of "Mortonson Randomness" Who downloads music illegally anymore? I used to before I knew that piracy was actually a crime. ( :-/ ) But anywho, it's not the lawsuits that scare me... It was the spyware, viruses, and random pornography being stowed away on my hard drive... All nice and warm. But anyways that was back when my favorite song was the latest "N'sync" hit. I have more "sophisticated" tastes now. (depends on what you like) I buy CDs religiously, and I have a nice collection of about 100 to 125. It's weird, maybe I should go and buy the CDs online because all I do is put them directly to my MP3 player anyways. Maybe it's the whole resale thing. I like to have the booklet to look at, lots of pretty pictures and lyrics. [;-)] Back to the real world, we are doing debates in World history and it just makes me further realize how stupid people really are! Come on! This is an actual quote from one of the students in my class, "What are weapons of mass destruction?" THAT IS SELF EXPLANATORY! Gosh, don't get me started... Anyways I have to get going.  Jeff slept: 11 hours today (5 1/2 units)

      Do not get me wrong. I am not here to complain but I need to vent a little. Please excuse the CAPS in these next few sentences, but it helps me feel better. AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH! I HAVE HAD HOMEWORK PILED UP TO MY NOSE IN THE PAST COUPLE DAYS! WORK WAS.... NOONE WANTS TO HEAR ABOUT MY WORK DAY, AND MY SISTER IS "FED UP" WITH ME NOT CLEANING ENOUGH! let me repeat, AHHHHHH! Okay I am done.  Here is my real blog now...  Everything is wonderful, and I am happy :-D! Anyways these past few days are full of homework. The storms outside are creepy :-/. I now have a text posting thing on the top of my Blog.... It wasn't really put on correctly, but I like it.  I will update later tomorrow with more  Exciting Dan News!    Hours Jeff slept: somewhere in the 10 1/2- 11 hour range... Creepy :-/ (that is my creeped out face)  Adios!

      I haven't much to say! The weekend was good, on Friday Ryan, Joe and I went to Starbucks to discuss student govt. plans. (not my plans) That was fun, and after that we went to Joe's house to watch the highly anticipated  Frasier Finally.  It was sad... Not for the show's end, more for the ending of the finally, I was sad that I didn't find out what happens. I guess it is better that way though. Anywho, Saturday I worked from 5-8, then went to Joe's house, he was having a campfire, we all talked and had some fun... even Jeff stopped by. And today is the boring day... I have some homework to do, but other than that, I AM BORED. Who wants to write a script for "decfiles de modelas" in Spanish? Well anyways, tomorrow should be alright... Work will be my sweet release. (weird, huh?) Its funny 'coz I don't hate what I do there... It's hard for a 15 year old to find work anywhere, especially with the way the economy is and all... But anyways, The people are extremely nice to me and the work (for the most part) always keeps me busy.  Well that was my little speech for the day...  I should start up a little thing at the end of my blog, like Ryan, or Alliegh, or Joe... No wait... Joe doesn't have anything. He has about 6 blog posts, so what do you expect? (just kidding Joe) anyways I need a tagboard, because this would be a subject to tag up. "Anyone who has an idea for what I should say at the end of my blog, tag it up on the board and I will decide the winner." Yeah...  How about this...  Funny quote of the Day:  nay...Over done.  Maybe...  Useless fact: Nope.  Okay I've got it  Kiss up of the day: No, wait Joe would always win... ( ;-) )  Okay seriously here it is... DRUMROLL PLEASE!  How long Jeff slept today: 9 hrs. (this is LOW he is usually higher than this)  He sleeps a lot, and he is home all summer, so this could get interesting  That is all folks and if you know how to put up a tagboard please email me at whitelephantstripe@sbcglobal.net (THAT'S a doosey!) Adios friends!

      I don't actually think that people make these things having anything interesting to say, it's all a game, who can update more, who can complain about their troubles more etc. etc. Etc....  Well I guess I should start this way...  Today I started my first day of work at Mario's Pizza. It was alright... Can't complain much. Anyways, lets talk about my school day shall we? Well 1st period was fun, but we aren't ready for the concert tomorrow. Mr. McG didn't teach our class today. Joe should get paid for what he does for our class... No not kiss Mr. McG's butt, more like teaching ALL of the classes Mr. McG is supposed to be teaching. I guess he was too busy selling choir stuff on Ebay.  Second period was BORING! we took that fine arts exam... all the lady said was "LOOK AT THE MONITER!" it was annoying. I know when to look at the Television, thank you. Third Period was Spanish-a-licious fourth period is more confusing than ever... Graphing quadratic inequalities, when am I going to use this in life! 5th period was gym, i pretended like i was good at basketball. 6th period I didn't get to eat my lunch I had to use the online school resources in the library. (they are really helpful!) Well, 7th period was boring, it usually isn't. 8th period we took a test and for the first time all year I felt confident when i was done with it!  Who cares about my school day? Why did I even bother. I need to stop playing the computer game "Rise of Nations" it will kill me before I can stop playing. That didn't make any sense... Well someone has to "IM" (instant message) me, and tell me how to make a conversation box in my blog... Like Ryan's. I use too many ...S it even annoys me. All I do is complain on this thing. This Blog is bringing the worst out of me. Well anyways, Jeff is now home, (he smells) and all he does is sleep. It bugs me, because I am sleep deprived. I go to bed at night, and I get too hot, or too cold, or too awake. This BLOG seems like a perfect solution to write my troubles away.  Well if you can, please link my blog on yours. I want people to read this  On a different note: my grammar isn't really this bad, I just don't care enough to think. I'M lazy now. S'pose I should go... My sister is being scolded. Bye!

My teacher is actually my counselor. (better do well in there) Any ways Jeff and Carolynn left Tuesday to go to Disney World, lucky ducks. They call daily and boast, it makes me mad GRRRR... Just kidding, i am happy for them, they needed this vacation. Also, i am going on a just as good vacation in November a CRUISE!   My job is going well, my boss seems to finally like me now. We gave my sister her graduation gift last Sunday (digital camera Coolpix 3200 3.2 megapixels, decent camera)she seems to like it. SHe plays around with it alot learns the functions and what not. Oh yeah, i bought a new computer! pretty neat-o specs:  512 Ram DVDR/RW DVD+R/RW 160GB HDD 7200 RPM 64 NVIDIA GE FORCE VIDEO CARD AMD ATHALON XP 3000+ PROCESSOR 8-IN-1 MEDIA CARD DEVICE READER XP HOME  and thats all folks until next time...
