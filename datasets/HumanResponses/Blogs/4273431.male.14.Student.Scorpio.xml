       Gunbound  is a online game where players select mobiles and using them, try to eliminate their opponents. It's similar to  Worms , or  Scorched Earth . But enough of that, let's move on.

         Something quite unusual happened today. As the title suggests, it all began during my visit to the doctor's office. This visit was the second part of a yearly physical, and I was to have a blood test. After my brother had his blood taken, he came back, complaining about how bad the doctor was and how much better our previous family doctor was. Soon it was my turn, I wasn't really expecting anything, so I just waltzed right in, and sat down in the chair. A woman, presumably the nurse, came in and tied a blue rubber elastic around my arm and asked me to make a fist. Seems like proper procedure so far, as my vein began to bulge out. Then came the prickling sensation, of the needle going into my arm. I stared in wonder as one container of blood filled up, then two containers. I wanted it to stop, but the words stuck to my throat, my blood boiling. My head began ache, and I looked away as the third container began to fill, my vision blurred, and blackness.... When I regained conscieness, I found myself on the cold, tiled floor of the room. Two people were scurrying around me, one I recognized as the nurse that was drawing the blood moments earlier. I didn't know what was going on, so I asked, "What am I doing on the floor?" Soon I began to panic. "What am I doing on the floor?!" No answers, just indistinct talking. My ears rang, and my head began to throb harder and harder. Then I heard my brother's voice, echoing through my mind, I could make out what he was saying, but it was calming to hear a familiar voice. After partially getting back my senses, they directed me to a bed to lie on. A couple minutes later, my brother came back to the room holding a bottle of juice. They beckoned me to drink it, even though I really didn't want anything, but my body ignored my commands and began to drink the juice. It had a raw, artificial taste, that seeped down my throat, cooling my insides. I lay down again, still disoriented, A while later, I was back on my feet, they kept asking me questions, "Are you sure you can walk?", and suggesting that I lie down again. "It's all in my head," I thought. "It's all in my head." I continued to walk, my mother and brother closely behind, making sure I wasn't going to collapse again. Although my head still throbbed, I tried not to show it, because the last thing I wanted was to stay in this clinic any longer. After reaching home, after a quick detour to Blockbuster, I walked upstairs, gave my shirt, which now had a couple of blood spots on it, to my mom and wiped out on my bed.    The rest of the day went by normally, watching  Finding Nemo,  and having some barbecued lunch, courtesy of my brother, although my mother was the one who prepared the meat and vegetables, so she did most of the work, I think. And so my day ends, when I go over to my un-made bed, and doze off until tommorrow comes.

       My first post, this is kinda wierd. I don't have too much to say, as it's nearing the end of the summer holidays- the point in time when you run out of things to do...anyways, I'll try to write more interesting posts as time goes on.
