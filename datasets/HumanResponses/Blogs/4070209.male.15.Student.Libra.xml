      This is the first time that im actually writing my blog hehehehehe....... Well today was an okay day for me because we didint have classes&nbsp;half day only.....&nbsp;But we still had our Religion UT...........Today was different&nbsp; bacuase we went somewhere that i dont know were we are.....We went to a scince somthin somethin its about science experimentations.....But it was something good for because we learn things thruogh those experimentations................After that we my brother fetched me and we went around to find a billiard table that he wants coz he wants it to put it in our new garage cz we have space yyaaaahooooooo................. But the last thing i will do tonight is prepare my things for tomorrow because im goin to my friend's house to study because he invited me....For me&nbsp;there is no other option because the workers are still workin on our new&nbsp;garage&nbsp;and they kept on hammerin to make a hole to the entrance of the new garage......It was very harsh for the ears it kept ringin and ringin until now........but anywayzzzzz its still nice to be here just typing and thinking "what will i do next?"..........Well this is it for today...............................Peace out remember patience takes you a long way.........................................You will see why  &nbsp; ]

      Sorry..... If did'nt blog for a long time coz i've been busy thinking about a lot of things..... Last 2 weeks ago we had our exams nothing special........On that week that Saturday my friends and I went out....We went to Robinson's Galleria the "mall of my mom"..... I called it that because my mom works for Robinson's now she is very happy in her job because she is the head of the Big R somthin somthin......... Then last week we just had our regular classes...The teachers gave us back the exam papers and I found out that I don't Have failing.......On that same week out soooo called Latin teacher is disappointed at our scores in our Exams and Ut's so that's why he has given us another chance to pass Latin....We need to come up with a play consisting of what we learned in the first quarter that's why i went out last Friday to do that...we went to my friends house to prepare a script for our performance.....And we did half of it... Aftet that again we went to my mom's mall to eat dinner and i was picked up there around 8 30....Then the next day it was Saturday we needed to go to my friends house agian to finish the script and we did it....Then we decided just to play basketball for fun and when we were at the court we were invited to play against a few people who lived there in the village... It was a tight game for us the score was about 9-9 but suddenly we were all tired and we dont subtitution players to accomodate the 5 players so in the end we were defeated the score was 24 -15 were defeated by 9 points only 9 points....... The players were ME as the point guard, Miggy the Small forward, Jef the shooting gaurd, Miko the power forward , And lance the center..... All most all of us scored with the help of team work....... I really think that in a team you need unity in order to win......That's what we did even though we were fatigue.........

      Well well well ........................Our new garage/badminton/basketball/volleyball/party area it almost finish because of me and my brother(bbbbboooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooyeah).....It's about 95%  complete.........We helped the workers destroy the wall connecting to the garage/badminton/basketball/volleyball/party area........It was really hard coz the sledge hammer was quite heavy because it's all made of pure metal...The workers took 3 days to destoy part of it..But the other wall connecting the garage/badmitnon/basketball/volleyball/party area was destroyed by us it took my brother,I and another worker to help us about 45 minutes heheheh we were so happy to see our house from that side it was very pleasing even though we got blisters in our hands and pain through out the body because of hammering the sledge hammer.......After that i took a bath because im going to Berting's house  to "study" daw..... There 4 of us there ot was Me Berting Migs and Jason we just fooled around the doin nothin but shouting :hoy aral na... But instead we just sat by the computer chattin with people..There was nobody home except Joelo Frits Berting and Alexys.........After we planned to play ball so we just dressed up and go to the court.....We were brought to the court by Bertings new Volvo because Alexys was goin to a seminar the she do not want to attend to???? ewan ko lng ........But anyways after we played ball i bought each of us a 1.5 L of coke just for to see who gets to finish it first........Then we just argued that we sutdy na then we were at the TV room and watched the movies we did when we were freshys.....The first one to go home was Migs then Jason and me i was the last one to go home because my brother had to go somewhere before he fetched me.........Even though it was exams week we still managed to have fun....It was a blast........That night i studied until 3 o clock just to make things right for me......
