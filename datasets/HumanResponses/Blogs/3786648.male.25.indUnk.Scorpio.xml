      I am honestly confused why this war in Iraq is so split down partisan lines.  Truly I believe this war could quite possibly set the record for completely conquering another country.  Wait that's not true...I'm pretty sure France surrendered in a matter of days.  At least Iraq TRIED to fight back.     I think to myself, WMDs or no WMDs, why was our actions wrong?  It seems to me the whole invasion of Iraq has fault tolerance on several political and moral levels.  No WMD?  Okay, overthrow him b/c he continued to threaten the U.S.  If his threats aren't valid, that's not our fault.  What we did was go into a country, overthrow a tyrant who was in violation of UN resolutions and give an entire nation something they've never had before:  Freedom.  There was a time in America when people were willing to fight and die to preserve freedom.      Now this is where I REALLY get confused.  Liberals are supposed to be people who consider themselves champions of human rights, civil rights, women's rights, equality, helping the poor, etc.  So...shouldn't the war in Iraq be EMBRACED by the liberal left?  Let's recap:  We just overthrew a totalitarian dictatorship- one of which who committed human rights violations, did not grant equal rights to women, used foreign aid money designated for food and medicine for the dictator's own personal interests.  I mean, Hussein broke every liberal rule in the book...yet liberals equate George Bush on Saddam's level or worse!    But the one liberal tactic that irks me the most is the fact that these hippies wave peace signs on the sides of the streets showing the numbers of Americans who have died overseas.  They want us to pull all our troops out so that there will be no more slaughter.  Michael Moore shows us a few pictures of people missing limbs and they cry out against such atrocity.  Oh the humanity, stop the insanity!  When did liberals become more emotional than progressive?  Yes, over a thousand Americans have died.  Yes, there were many more Iraqis who died.  But consider how many Iraqis would die if Hussein were left in power.  How many more would die under his son's rule?  Plus, when you put into perspective that an entire evil nation was overthrown at the cost of 1000+ Americans, that is truly a monumental accomplishment.  When you consider about 3000 men were killed at Fredricksburg in ONE day during the civil war, 1000+ lost over a year of occupation in a foreign land is impressive.  Folks, I'm not saying that it's good they died.  Quite contrary.  I value what our soldiers fought for and I honor them in death.  Their lives were a sacrifice- a sacrifice for a foreign people to have the opportunity to become that which we take for granted on a daily basis:  Freedom.  To say otherwise is a dishonor to the fallen.  To say what they are fighting for is not worth dieing for makes their entire mission pointless.  I love America.  And if there's one characteristic that defines Americans from the rest of the world is that we die to protect other nations.  We have time and time again sacrificed ourselves to protect freedom throughout the world.  I guess that's why it hurts me to see liberals completely ignore and reject all the good that we have brought to Iraq.  They focus only on our losses and not our accomplishments.  They focus only on our flaws and mistakes, not our achievements.  I find such people will never be satisfied, no matter what you do.  Liberals are a miserable people.

      For those of you who are living with Mom and Dad, you might be unaware of the recent surge in the cost of living- especially when it comes to the housing market.    I read in the John Kerry Times over the weekend that the average housing prices increased again over the last year.  After reading through it, I think it safe to say roughly the average price of a home in California appreciated another 35% or so.  In La Mirada, the womb of my adolecent years, the median home goes for about $435,000.  On a 30 year loan with a LIBOR at 3.5%, the mortgage payment alone would be $1,930.89.  This ofcourse does not include the cost of hazard and mortgage insurance, utilities, and other expenses.  If you also factor the cost of interest over that time in being over $265k, you'd realize you're spending about $700k for a home.  Most people, unlike the financial genius that is me, will not qualify for the LIBOR and will have to take a higer rate based on the American Bond standard.  In other words, with interest they'll be paying closer to ONE MILLION DOLLARS!  That's a lot of money for a run down 50 year old house.   To put it into perspective, the median house in Inglewood is going for $330k.  All I can say is it pays to be a crack whore or pimp.  All an Inglewood resident has to do now is sell their home and their addition expenses are covered for the next five years!  Which brings me to my point:  The Democrats have long been the party that traditionally strives to help the underdog.  They work to protect those who can't help themselves, right?  If this were true, I would be the first to jump on the bandwagon.  But if Democrats are supposed to help the underdogs, then what have they done to try to help people get into homes?  If you're reading this, tell me:  How have the Democrats helped you with anything?    Let's see what they have done: -In California, they put us into an unimaginable debt after having a 23 million surplus. -They raised the minimum wage.  Teenagers and illegals rejoiced.   -They fight for homosexuals, abortion, and relativist worldviews of which seek to undermine traditional, moral worldviews.  All this masked under the word "tolerance".  The list goes on and on...  The problem I have with Democrats is that they are no longer a united group of people trying to improve the lives of people.  They are now made up of groups of fringe elements such as the environmentalists, minority groups, women's lib, etc. who's sole purpose is to burden the majority with the agenda of the minority.  The 2 to 3% of Americans who are environmental whackos push to pass legislation causing extra expenses to industries and consumers.   When Democratic legislation is passed, it burdens the majority of people!   The same can be said in general for all Democratic legislation.  Sadly, while 80% of Californians living in Orange County do not own their homes, the Democrats are still pushing for things like health care, gay marriage, taxing the rich, etc.  Talk about being out of touch!  A few years ago, only 43 million people did not have health care.  That means over 200 million do!  Gay's claim to be 10% of the population.  Even if they are (which is doubtful at best), 9 out of 10 people do not benefit from gay issues or legislation.  And how is taxing the rich going to somehow make the world a better place?  Nonsense!  Nothing more than social jelousy from the lower class.  Besides, it is not the responsibility of a rich man to financially support the financially and socially foolish lifestyle of the poor.  But that is another rant I will get to in the near future.   While I recognize Bush is no Reagan, at least I got a fat tax refund in the mail the last two years.  The first time, in fact, I ever got a refund was under the Bush administration.  To be honest, that is more than what any Democrat has EVER done for me.

      I swore I would never do this.  Here I am.  Rock you like a hurricane.  Well, I've never really been good at keeping promises so I suppose this is within the boundaries of bad character.  I imagine such surprise by my actions should rather be considered expectation.    Today marks the beginning of my voice being shared throughout the world.  I will not advertise.  I don't need to.  I will speak my mind and hopefully the few who read and hear my words might be enlightened by my magnificent mind and reason.

      Well, the Democratic National Convention is over.  I am happy to report I watched three out of four days (I didn't program my TIVO correctly for night #2).  Here's a summery:  A)  Did you know John Kerry was a Vietnam Vet? B)  Take it from Teresa, it's time for women to receive full equality. C)  Reestablish good feelings with the rest of the world. D)  John Edwards cares about the common man and he'll continue to fight for them. E)  Did you know John F. Kerry was a Vietnam Vet?  F)  Iraq is a failure.  We have failed to maintain any level of peace in the region. G)  Make health care affordable. H)  Did you know John eFfing Kerry drove a boat in Vietnam? I)  Make prescription drugs affordable for the elderly by making drugs from other countries permissible.  J)  Help is on the way for our troops. K)  John Kerry will fight when attacked.  L)  The President (who will remain unnamed) is involved in an orgy with the Saudi royal family and his decisions are based more upon their interests, not America's.  M) Raise Taxes for the rich only, but cut taxes for everyone else.  N)  The unnamed President is to blame for the reduction and elimination of essential afterschool programs that keep our children off the streets.  O)  John Kerry was a Vietnam vet and that experience will make him a better Commander-in-Chief. P)  Priveledged yuppies like Bush, Cheney, and Bill Clinton all avoided the draft, but John Kerry volunteered to go to Vietnam.  By the way, did you know he was a Vietnam vet? Q)  John Kerry will unite America to better work together!  Now, some of these points may appear a little off-beat, but when you're as fluent in Liberaleze as I am, you'll begin to see the hidden truths that lie beneath.  Allow me to translate:  A)  John Kerry spent only 4 months in the Vietnam War. B)  The equality liberals speak of for women is a code word for abortion.  Here's news for you folks:  Women have full equality.  Abortion can never be an issue of equality because it is an issue of inequality by nature.  Men cannot have abortions.  A baby is a product of a man and woman.  Therefore, it is unfair for a woman to ultimately make the decision that will destroy the possession that is only 50% her's (I speak in liberal terms.  We all know abortion is murder).   That aside, liberals are simply hiding their agenda to further the barbaric murder of millions of unborn human beings by labeling it "equality".  I was disappointed by this.  If liberals truly believe abortion is a moral proceedure, then liberals should proudly say it directly.  But the fact is that more and more Americans are less likely to support abortion then they did ten years ago.  Swing voters are less likely to support it, so they camoflauge the abortion issue under "equality".   C)  They say they want to reestablish good ties with foreign nations.  Truth is they want France and Germany to like us.  Who cares?    D)  John Edwards is not a champion for the comman man.  He is a trial lawyer who has made a fortune off of the winnings of his clients.  Since when does a lawyer care about the comman man?   E)  John Kerry got three purple hearts.  Two of which were injuries caused not by the enemy, but John Kerry himself.  Normal proceedure would have a superior officer fill out the paperwork to nominate a soldier for the purple heart.  Kerry filled out the documentation himself.   F)  In the 60s, liberals claimed Vietnam was a failure.  America was sending its children off to die with no purpose.  Last night, I witnessed liberals portray Vietnam with the upmost respect and demonize America for sending its children off to die with no purpose.   G)  Liberals are still on the health care kick.  45 million do not have health care.  There are approximately 290 million americans.  That means only 16% of Americans do not have health insurance.  Do you know the single largest uninsured group?  It's men and women in their 20s who are in good health and choose not to be insured.  Aside from them, there is Medicare to take care of the poor and Medicaid to care for uninsured children.  As we stand now, there really isn't an excuse NOT to have health care if you WANT it.  I say if someone is too stupid or lazy to sign up for free government health care, then whatever happens is a consequence of their behavior.  I don't think those people should be further rewarded.   Now let's put this into perspective:  The liberals want the MAJORITY of Americans to pay the cost to insure 16% of the population.  Once again, this is a core value of the modern liberal:  Wealth redistribution.  Burden the many to benefit the select few.   Maybe a better solution would be to reduce the amount of liability that health care providers are responsible for.  Maybe work to stop trial lawyers like John Edwards from forcing health care providers to continously raise their rates to compensate for the rising insurance to cover court settlements.  Maybe try to make the HMO system work smoother.  No.  That's too much work.  Why work when you can have someone else pay the bill.   H)  John Kerry came back from Vietnam and claimed at a Congressional hearing that Vietnam troops were actively engaging in war atrocities and that he was ashamed to be a part of it.  Today he paints another story.   Oh yeah, there were actually more recorded war atrocities in World War II than in Vietnam.  I)  Democrats have long cried out for help with prescription drugs.  I believe this issue has been put to rest since Bush signed the Prescription Drug Act (I forget the exact title).  Kerry wants you to be able to buy drugs from other countries.  If this were to happen, I wonder then what would be the purpose of the Food and Drug Administration if they can't prevent Americans from using drugs they don't permit.  Maybe I'm missing something here.  J)  Help on the way for our troops?  John Kerry has said that he won't take our troops home.  He's said that he would maintain the status quo.  How is that better help than Bush?  K)  John Kerry will fight when attacked (emphasis on WHEN).  I don't find this conforting.  I translate this to mean Kerry won't act to protect Americans unless Americans first die.   L)  I find it childish that they would follow the Michael Moore bandwagon and claim Bush's decisions are more based on Saudi interest.  This is stupid.  The Saudis urged Bush not to go to war with Iraq.  Saudi Arabia disagrees with America's support of Israel.  Now, if Bush were in fact engaging in sexual bliss with 12 Saudi virgin daughters as liberals claim, don't you think his foreign policy might more represent their interest?   M)  Dems want to raise taxes for the rich only.  Rob the rich, give to the poor.  Classic Liberal thinking.  This is nothing short of class envy.  "I got a tax cut, but that rich guy's cut was bigger and it's not fair!"  Personally, I don't think it's fair to punish somebody for becoming successful.  If liberals are going to raise taxes, they're going to raise taxes on everybody.  The rich are able to find loopholes to protect their assest.  That's just the way the world works.  The middle class and poor then end up having to pay the most.  Unfair you say?  I don't.  I just use reality to motivate myself not to be poor or in the middle class the rest of my life.   N)  Afterschool programs?  Once again, it's the whole "burden the majority to benefit the select few".   O)  4 months of experience in Vietnam does not make a person ready to handle the responsibilities of being the Commander-in-Chief.  However, 19 years as a Senator is enough experience to demonstrate leadership and critical decision making.  It's ridiculous that they would sensationalize his involvement in Vietnam to better qualify him for President than his history as Senator.   P)  Clinton did avoid the draft.  However, Cheney was not elidable to go to war because he was a father at the time they began the draft.  Bush was in the National Guard during that time.  While maybe not as glamorous as going to war, it's unfair for liberals to portray Bush as a rich kid who avoided the draft.   Q)  John Kerry will further polarize this nation.  He was rated the #1 most liberal Democrat in the Senate and his partner, Edwards, was rated #4.  This is the most liberal Democratic ticket ever.    Okay, those are my thoughts.  Enjoy.  If you don't like what I have to say, I challenge you to research it and respond.

      When you think of the domestic environment, probably one of the first things you think about are the decline of our forests, the size of landfills, and how so very little of it is being recycled.    The truth is (as reported by the American Forest & Paper Association (AF&PA):  -In 2003, 49.3 million tons, or 50.3% of all paper consumed in the US is now being recycled- up from 33.5% in 1990.   -In 2003, recycling of cardboard boxes (OCC) rose to a record high of 75.8%. -In 2003, 73% of all Old Newspapers (ONP) were recycled. -Recovery of office papers increased to 48.3% last year, an all time high. -Americans recycle 270 million pounds of paper every day (roughly 49 million tons a year). -Every ton of paper recovered for recycling saves 3.3 cubic yards of landfill space.  This means almost 162 million cubic yards were spared from our landfills.   -Recycling continues to increase throughout the nation and is showing no signs of slowing down.    -I read on http://textonly.mde.state.md.us/Programs/LandPrograms/Recyling/index.asp that every ton of paper recycled will save up to 24 trees, each 40' tall.  This means that up to 3,888,000,000 trees were spared last year because of recycling.  In other words folks, our domestic trees and forests are in no real danger of being lost forever.    But the biggest truth Liberals don't want you to know about is this:   Liberals want you to think that the hard work, sacrifice and concern from environmentalists is what's causing recycling to grow.  This is not true.  Recycling works and continues to improve because EVERYONE makes money.  The public recycles and they receive money.  The recycler makes money because he sells the material to mills.  Mills make money because recycled material is cheaper than virgin material.  Printers, bottle makers, and can makers save money because recycled material lowers their overall expenses.  Plus, recycling companies purchase the waste paper, plastic, glass, and aluminum from commercial and industrial businesses, adding to their revenue.  The end consumer benefits again because lowered production expenses, lowered trash expenses (resulting from recyclables being diverted from the waste stream), and revenue received from selling recyclables to recycling companies help lower the prices consumers pay for goods.    Making money is the only thing that is going to save the environment.  That's the problem I have with toothless environmentalists:  They spend all their time concerned about the problem without thinking of innovative, money-making systems for improvement.  Instead, the best they do is create costly industrial restrictions.  They therefore, are a hinderance to their own cause!
