						    The Three Sisters by Rebecca Locksley  
 isbn: 0380814005  

This is a fun and entertaining read. If you enjoy fantasy and/or scifi fiction, you will enjoy this one. For the first time fantasty reader, this novel could leave you a bit confused early on as a lot of information is crammed in the first few pages. However, this is not an individual fault but rather a genre fault. Names and places are orginal and inventive, and an Australian aborinigal and Celtic influence can be felt. The swearing is also good and brought a smile to my face. If you also like to read about conflict, this has some exciting and well written battle scenes. One part I found confusing however, was the method by which the heroine excapes. How???

						    Best of Friends by Cathy Kelly   
 isbn: 0007154038

Best of Friends is Cathy Kelly's seventh novel, but the first of hers that I've read. It's the story of three women who are brought together by the demise of another. This story has been described as warm, chatty and delightful, which I partly agree with. However, there are a few major faults with this novel which, in my view, should have been tidied up before being sent to the publishers. Firstly, there are too many 'fillers' which make me wonder if they were included to meet the required word length. Also, there are too many 'so&sos said' and other descriptive words such as 'so&amp;so grumbled' which could have been left out. This would make the sentences tighter. But leaving technicalities aside, this is a nice saccharine sweet story of three women, their individual lives and how they interact with each other, their different coping styles and how they support each other. What I can't believe though, is how these women became very close friends after a matter of weeks!

						    Bridget Jones's Guide to Life by Helen Fielding  
 isbn: 0142000213  
A funny light read from Helen Fielding. Short and sweet, and to be read after Bridget Jones's Diary and Bridget Jones: the edge of reason. Or even after watching the Bridget Jones's Dairy film. Without, this might not make a lot of sense. I enjoyed reading this short mini-novel but I think less photographic pictures would have been better.

 Flatmates by Chris Manby  
 isbn: 0340689609  
Hurrah, another Chris Manby novel! I must admit that I am a fan of hers. It might be because Lizzie Jordan's Secret Life by Manby was the first 'girly' novel that I read. This novel is about three friends who move out of their respective parental homes to share a house in London. Chaos ensues! This book is a fast and fun ride through each girls chaotic year that ends all too quickly. A tight plot and well rounded and believable characters make this a must read. 
Rating 8/10
