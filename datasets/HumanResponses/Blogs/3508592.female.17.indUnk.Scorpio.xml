      Being a full-time worker is starting to take it's toll somewhat not in terms of energy or anything but in terms of takin over my everyday life. I miss hanging out with everyone in the common room I haven't heard from some people at all in the 2 weeks I've been gone but at least this experience has shown me who my real friends are really the ones that really give a damn. I think I'm going to have to sacrifice a day a week or so and just set it aside to catch up with friends because otherwise I think I might not be able to handle it that well. I suppose one upside is that I'm going to be getting used to what others are going to have to adjust to next year still I have no idea how long it's gonna take me to get used to this and it's only been a few weeks. I no longer have 2 days off this week I only have friday so I intent to make the most of it maybe go and see some of my friends or hopefully go out that night if anythings going down it's been a few weeks since I done that.

      I'm glad I'm not the dependant in my family I had to take mum to town today she's my pensioner for the day. Mum rung Fallon up in Australia and talked to her for half an hour apparently she's bought me and ebonee heaps of stuff but some of it's for our birthdays. Lucky cow bought a digital video camera so they've recorded alot of the rides they've been on. I think she gets back on the 1st or sumthing. Well my full time work is really kicking into gear as of today from now on it'll be long shifts and asshole customers to deal with hopefully I won't spend the majority of my time on front counter cuz I had 9 hrs of that the other day and was so sick of it. I get to drive the car in as well so thats cool I haven't been allowed to drive it to work yet but it's only a 4 hr shift so I'll get home before ebonee does so she can't pack a shit cuz she won't know I had the car. It shouldn't take me long to save a grands deposit for a car, Dad's building and extension for Kerry Heveltd on the storage barn dad built him anyway so dad can talk to him about a car. I'm not getting a sedan though I want a hatch only if I really really like a sedan will I consider getting one. I think If I can to I'll get an auto there ain't no use changing a formula that already works now is there. The balls tommorow and thank god I'm not going how boring I know some people like that kinda shit but I'm not one of em.

      Well school for me is pretty much finished all I have left to do is finish my leavers card which I'm supposed to do before leaving but haven't got round to really and secondly go to my psychology exam tommorow.It's in a church which I don't think is going to help me too much. I haven't really prepared for it but I don't care I just want everything school related over with I'm tired of it. I know it's gonna be weird not seeing everyone everyday but it's going to have it's positives and negatives equally I think. The balls this weekend, obviously I'm not going I think it's a waste of time and not what I find fun at all but I might go see everyone before they go although I'm gonna have to overcome a pretty big case of outsidedness cuz I'm gonna feel so outta place with everyone. I'm not planning on going out after it finishes because last year I went out after finishing work and it was pretty boring I thought but I managed to stay awake for 24 hrs so I was pretty impressed by that. The folks are just writing a goodbye gift to the school if you will, a nice complaint letter about "mullet head" or "meathead" as my parents have fondly named her. I think wasting the six months of this year with that bitch will all have been worth it if somethings done about her. Well guys good luck with the rest of the year and I'll see ya's round sooner rather than later I hope.

      It seems everytime I look at the new on the web it without a doubt has something about terrorism and saddam and "told the USA this and I told them that but they didn't do anything about it" Who really gives a damn! It's disturbing the whole situation in Iraq quite frankly George Bush is a fucking idiot and I think even he knows it. I do hope michael moore succeeds with using his publicity to oust the bastard I think my cat could run that country better than him. Michael Moore by the way seems to be the only American with half a brain or if he isn't the only one with enough balls to do anything about it the rest just sit on their ass and complain. Real constructive huh. I'm just sick of hearing about it. Anyway on a more positive note I think anyway I got to drive last night yay for me! took like the whole day to convince dad to let me cuz the wind was like howling the whole day but thankfully died off. Went to renegades last nite really just to hang out some of the others did their make up stuff for the ball next weekend. I can go out and see everyone before hand but I highly doubt I will it'l just seem too odd for my liking anyway laterz ppl.

      Technically I think I'm supposed to be at school but to hell with that I don't need to be there so why should I be. I'm going in an hour or so anyway, I didn't realise how many more signatures I needed to get like the librarian and all those kinda people why? I have no idea most of them don't know me. I'm gonna get to drive tonight hopefully anyway and without dads'criticism considering I have my restricted now he's confined to the passenger seat and thats the way I like it. I'm going up to Nelson in August so by then I should hopefully have enough saved so If I spot a car up there I like and of course passes dads approval hopefully I'll come back with a car. After my dentist visit I have to go back again if the next one is gonna be as bad as that was I'm going to avoid it at all costs. I don't like having half a numb face it's not the most pleasent feeling and doesn't help when everyone laughs at you :( Anyway Friday nite theres a rave at the DP1 ya not allowed to drink to my knowledge so the plan is to before and then go down there cuz they've got some good djs spinning so it ought to be good for a change.

      Oh yea got my restricted today! Was quite stoked and surprisingly I wasn't nervous until he asked me to do a parallel park but I done my best one yet. My only flaw was when turning left I didn't go close enough to the curb so another car would have come up the side of me. I got to drive by myself to town too although I had to drive the whole way to town with the headlights on low cuz I couldn't figure out how to change it but ebonee showed me once I got her. So hopefully in 2 months I'll have a beasty honda civic and there will be no boundaries I'll go road tripping every weekend I have off providing I can afford the gas that is. Ebonee wasn't too happy she wasn't allowed to drive and I reckon a argument about the whole situation isn't too far off. I have the dentist tommorow so I doubt I'll go to school theres no point anyway as I usually have a half day on a tuesday anyway. I better start studying for the psychology exam which is next tuesday so I have a week to learn everything I need. Here's hoping

      Only six days of school left that is considering I attend them all. I probably will. I purposely made myself late for photography only by a few minutes or so. I had to eat after all. Upon my arrival I was told that she (Malock) wouldn't sign my leavers card unless I went all the way home and got my work and paid my fee so really I have to pay for her signature. I guess she wanted to feel like it was actually worth something, and I knew there was a reason I wanted her signature first. So I went home during the 2nd period I had of it and gave it to the bitch much to my mums disapproval and promptly walked out again. Mr Shea the H.O.D called a few of us into a meeting about her bit late I thought but he seems to actually want to get something done about it and even though I'm leaving school, he thought it was mine and my mums 'obligation' to complain to the principal. He was gonna ring my mum but he hasn't yet I dunno if mum will take it to the principal. Anyhow I left school in search of fine tuning my road skills mainly in the give way area. I managed to do so to my own satisfaction then headed to the beach for a walk. Kirsty and Renegade pulled up behind me saying they'd been following me. So after that we all headed to the tiphead which I've never really been to the end of basically cuz I thought you weren't allowed to but it's freaky up there thats for sure but I quite like it. We headed to maccas after that and then to dixon park and I left to go home after that. It was fun just hanging out though not really doing much the days of doing that are numbered too I think. I got home to the "Where have you been" routine but they were genuinely worried so I felt quite bad even though I had told mum I probably wouldn't be home straight after school. I had rung her after this meeting with Mr Shea to warn her he might ring and she thought I was upset about it for some reason and I'd taken off cuz they'd tried to ring my cellphone but i'd never answered but I must of been on  my way home then. I tell ya drama who needs it. I go for my restricted licence in a few days I'm quite nervous about it but I'm confident enough I have the road rules sussed now I only question my driving ability but hopefully it'll all be up to scratch.

      Randomest party ever last night seriously, didn't really know the guy but we turned up anyway to witness some of the younger schoolies off their face it was all quite scary at first. The alcohol was flowing well until 4 in the morning with a good 8 people having a good old 'power-chuck' myself unfortunately included. A word of warning don't drink benidictine or whatever it is it is ****in disgusting and not to mention lethal. Overall it was a pretty good night I had fun anyway for most the time some people weren't on their best behavior when they should have been and it will be interesting to find out the consequences they'l be in for because of it. I'm just downloading the gollum feature that was on mtv a while back I never seen it but apparently it was damn hilarious and I'm quite obsessed with everything gollum cuz he's so damn funny. Well I'm quite tired and need my rest so I think I'll go txt a few people as ya do and settle in for the night with some vids sounds good aye.

      I didn't go go to school today as I still have the flu, you wanna know why I really hate getting the flu? is because the length of time that goes by before you actually get it till the time it passes onto someone else (heres hoping).I even called into work sick for the first time ever thats right ever! I really didn't want to cuz I said to mum I needed to so I could pay for my licence then she pointed out I'll get paid sick pay so thats good because I completely forgot. Luckily the manager I talked to was able to get someone to cover virtually straight away.I watched the final episode of friends last night at about 1 oçlock  just because I couldn't sleep can't say I thought it was a memorable sendoff for a show thats been running a good 10 yrs but I was never a regular watcher anyway.I'm gonna have to get my ass into gear and find out if Dave is gonna give me full-time work or not I don't like not knowing where I stand. Hopefully the majority of this flu has buggered off at least the symptoms of it by tommorow night I don't mind drinking and feeling like shit as long as I don't have the symptoms of it. I aren't allowed to whatever social gathering will be taking place tonight because if I can''t go to school or work I can't go to that apparently. I don't think it would be much fun in the state I'm in anyway. Until tommorow which better be a blast gotta love a 3 day weekend.

      I'm quite excited just sitting here I've managed to find a song I've been looking for in ages I have no idea what it's called just that I like it I dunno who it by either which doesn't help but I'm just glad that I've found it again. Anyway the weather being the bitch that it is has decided to attack my immune system with a damn cold which i really don't appreciate especially with the long weekend coming up.Nature can be so cruel sometimes. I still intend on having a good one though. I have work today and I really aren't in the mood for it I think I'll tank up on panadol to deal with this shitty headache thats decided it wants to wreck havoc with my poor brain. One good thing that could quite possibly come out of tonight is that I might find out if I can actually get full-time work cuz the longer i stay at this shit hole school the more demented I'll become (if thats possible).

      Well after a prick of a year so to speak I'm finally gonna give school the flick. There is just no point to me being there anymore I'm not getting any credits, not by choice there's just shit all on offer. So I scooted down to see Dave(mcd boss) and he was just leaving when I was walking up so I was quite gutted so I gave mandi the money I owed but didn't owe back and thought better of asking her about full-time work seeing as though Andrea was in there (daves wife). So feeling rather defeated I walked out and had a good look around for some reason and there was dave waltzing back to the resturant so i seized the moment and asked him about it. This was all rather scary as I've never talked to him for more than a minute in the whole yr and 6 months i've been there. Anyway he said he wouldn't commit to saying I could get full-time work but he'l take a look he said he could probably give me over the 30 mark which is good enough for me I'm only looking for 35-40 hrs is that really so much. I wouldn't settle for any less though I am trying to save ya know. He's gonna get back to me in the next few days anyway so hopefully the 22nd of june is my last day of school. I popped into the aa and grabbed me a licence form to fill out I'm gonna go book it soon possibly before the end of the week so I will hopefully have my restricted licence before I finish school.No more freezing my ass off on the scooter cuz dad will let me use the car if only for pity reasons. This weekend queens bday weekend I'm quite excited it better be a blast seeing as though i have it off.

      Went out to Joshs last night with Nicola, Rupert and Richard had had a little too much to drink so nicola drove Ruperts car. I didn't wanna go with them the second time but was peer pressured into going apparently I didn't really care anyway till nicola was speeding like a maniac and I had no seatbelt which is what worried me most. I have close tonight and tommorow which sucks but it's the holidays now so I'll get to see everyone more often. Shellz, Josh and rena turned up this morning and stayed for about an hr or more playing the ps2 which I must say shelley sucked ate lol she'l kill me. I'm gonna sign up for deviantart today because now that I'm not doing cgt at school I wanna do more of it at home and just post it up there for the world to see honestly there are some brilliant people out there that only design for fun and deviantart is the hive for those people.

      It's been ages since I last post but no one ever reads it anyway so I'm sure I wasn't missed. My car is now working although the bumper is not really where it should be and my stereo now doesn't go after dad fixed the leak in it but I don't think there is much point fixing the stereo because I'm going to buy a new mp3 one with some 6x9 xplodes for the back . Well that'l do for today
