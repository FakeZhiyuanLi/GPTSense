      Ambrose I fear you have designs for blog domination of the wolf nation. However, by having shown the way in the fact that you are the only one to have posted a sizeable blog I will give you status of official 'renegade' blogger on Wolffies World. Further behaviour may lead me to promote you to 'renegade master' and renegade master of the ill behaviour.. and so on. I recommend watching Goodbye Lenin a great drama/comedy but also very educational for anyone wanting to learn about Ostalgie and life in the communist bloc. Other recommendation: Moonsoon Wedding, a refreshingly contemporary/un bollywood clich√© film about a marriage in India. One to miss: Gerry by Gus Van Sant. Perhaps the slowest most prentious film I have ever seen. Alternative rubbish film: A Nymphoid Barbarian in Dinosaur Hell.

      what on earth is this zone? hmmm one thing i note is that none of the links below are clickable. use the link button people! oh, there doesnt seem to be one.   so, for no reason, my amazing film round up:  monster: crap crap crap. charlize theron looks ugly and wins an oscar for the trauma of doing so. oh! she put on 30 pounds! amazing! dreadful acting from her and bug eyed christina ricci, a stinker.  girl with a pearl earing: well, i kinda liked this. scarlett johansen perfects her "gawping at camera" technique which she employed to such er...effect in lost in translation. it looks nice. but colin firth as vermeer? silly man  la mala educacion: almodovars new one. saw it in spanish so didnt understand most of it. not as good as his others that i have seen. too autobiographical? a bit like,  "catholicism fucked me up man! priests sometimes abuse kids in their care! I'm gay by the way! did i mention that! oh yeah! this is what my career has been leading u pto all this time!"  along came polly: sorry, ben stiller is a dick. jennifer anniston is some boho chick? hollywood casting people must be doing far too much coke at the moment. first charlize, now this.   well thats my first post. dopnt forget, people, for a different perspective, check  hollo's kingdom

      wolff your link on the email appears to be faulty. Met up with Tak the guv and Raz tonight which was good. You should come down this weekend, hopefully Joel, Raz and Gav will be about on the saturday night.  On the topic of mullets, you should be well versed having sported one for about a year. I believe that you resembled a german rock star. They are good though, my top ten includes Chris Waddle and Glenn Hoddle (a.k.a "the diamond lights"), Pat Sharp from funhouse, Carlos Valderrama, Jason Gillespie and of course Hasselhoff, particularly in his knightrider days. Take it easy.

      The mullet is back out, isn't it? The best thing about a mullet is that if it looks shit, you can have it cut off and replaced with something non-shit. Which is a bit better than having a swear word shaved into the back of your head.

Actually come to think of it that was the main reason for this blog, as a means of keeping in contact and keeping people up to date. So there you go , you now have a good excuse for an exotic holiday!

      Following the salacious blog of the high class escort belle du jour, I wish also to follow in the same vein as I had an interesting encounter last night and wish to tell everyone about it.  It was actually in the house of all places, it had been years since our last encounter. Looking as fresh as 10 years ago and beckoning me to come over I approached with a mixture of  trepidation and feverish excitement. I had longed to grap to touch and fondle. Yes, it was my stamp collection. All the charms of Azerbaijan, Upper Volta and southern Wurttenburg in one book. Hoorah! All my favorite pages including my specialist collection of hungarian stamps with goats on them. I spent all night feverishly licking my stamp hinges so that I could add to my collection and make it even bigger! Wow! I ended up this morning covered in a white mist of stamps. It was all too much so i'm going out to go and look at some caravans today.

      Right in order to get my visa type thing, I have to propose some sort of travel itinerary for japan. The only problem is that I have no clue, particularly as I have no idea of where I am going yet. As short circuit would say "I need input" If anyone has any suggestions or links to long stay travel suggestions to Japan It would be greatly appreciated.   I have been reading my grandfathers memoirs recently which are very interesting. He lived in Japan as a french teacher in Kyoto in the late 1930s, a fascinating and exciting period. Towards the end of his stay he was monitered by the Japanese authorities and even had his flat broken into. Himself and some compatriots were also carefully monitoring the activites of German merchant vessels untill they were found out and expelled from their lookout.   He had a very active life and lived as a diplomat in Australia, New Zealand, Los Angeles and Chicago in America, Cardiff, South Africa and Gibraltar. What is interesting about these memoirs as is not so much what he puts in as what he leaves out. Lots of talk about the politics of the time, meeting the stars in LA such as Mansfield and Monroe but he says little about other things such as his life from 24-30.   The advantage with personal diary blogs vis a vis autobiographies and memoirs is that they are more of a stream of consciousness, they tend to be more candid and honest. I was thinking if politicians all wrote blogs they would restablish a sense of honesty and interest back into politics. Mind you most blogs talk a lot of crap of well so what's new there!

      Templor indeed praises France for its secular commitment, especially the 5th Republic's notion that beliefs in god or religion are a private matter and should not be condoned by the state.  And your grandad being forced to imbibe devil books secretly - maternal demands are often amusing!  Templor visited the Order of the Liberation site (and found the  urlLink English  version), but what exactly was his brother's role?

      No they are not sadly, they are private memoirs. His brother is mentioned in various books, and has a mini biog on the net but in french: http://www.ordredelaliberation.fr/fr_compagnon/739.html There are various anecdotes though that i'd like to recall. One of them which I think templor i think will find interesting is when he was a young boy before the first world war. His mother was very religious and this caused friction between her and fathers profession, as at the time in the 4th republic there was a strong division between church and state. The father was in fact told that their church going would impede his career as a civil servant so they had to have private church services in their house. This didn't away the mothers religious zeal however. She was shocked and flabbergasted one day when she found my grandfather reading Machiavelli's 'the prince'. She immediately told him to write on it that it was written "by the hand of the devil" and to dispose of it. My grandfather who was so fascinated by politics kept on reading these sort of books but in great secrecy to avoid his mothers wrath.

      I have just been to that new virtual methodist church, an interesting experience. I can't say I was spiritually moved by a 3d mock up of a church. It felt wrong probably because I felt I should be playing half life or something so I didn't feel so much holy but wanting to pump lead into peoples hearts. It didn't help that all the men had beards. Overall verdict: A bit of a bore, untill someone tried to bum me in the crypt. This greatly enhanced the sense of realism and feeling that I was actually in a church.

      It has just occured to me that I will be leaving on the 8th July and haven't sorted out any formal farewells. This weekend I am busy with my sisters wedding which leaves the weekend of the 2nd-4th. I think it would probably be best to have a bit of a shindig at my place but if anyone else has any ideas let me know. I will probablty be free to go out at the beginning of the week of my departure as well if anyone fancies it.  I will be gone for a while so it would be really nice to catch up with everyone before I go.

      Well i have finally arrived in Japan and boy and im tired!  My travels started on thursday afternoon. Upon checking in i was told my visa had expired and I couldnt go. The lady at the desk however then realised she was actually looking at the issue date. Such was her embarrasment that she bumped me up to business class (well thats what i like to think anyway!) So the flight was good, had ample leg room and amazing food. Arriving in Osaka I was greeted by a comical half japanese half irish guy who whisked me off straight onto another connecting flight and relieved me of my two suitcases which was a little worrying but i have them now. When I got to Fukuoka I was then greeted by another fellow who put me on a train to Kumamoto. Thats when I realised I was in Japan. I was alone and it was quite intimidating, fortunately there were some taiwanese who spoke a little english and they made sure i got off at the right place. What was truly terrifying however was trying to find my flat. I was armed with a map but it was of no help to the taxi driver who drove me to the nearest intelligble place to it. I went around asking people pointing at the map but to no avail. Then some ladies took pity and decided to help me and drove me around the block about 40 times trying to figure out where the hell it was. Finally we found it tucked away behind another block where I orginally thought it was (and intruded upon an old lady doing so!) I have never felt so relieved!

      Just a quick note to say goodbye. Profound apologies to anyone I haven't had the chance to see in the last few days; I have been in a manic frenzy trying to get everything done in very little time. By the way, I won't be bringing my mobile out as Japan is one of the few countries where it won't work. In any case, as I have personally found out, it can be quite an unecessary burden on your finances. I will be getting a mobile in a week or so - I will email it to everyone in due course.    All that remains to be said is 'sayonara' and the next blog you will recieve from me will be from Japan!

      &nbsp; Now im a week into the Japanese experience my blood pressure, heart rate and general nerves have come back to normal and im really enjoyinng it out here.  &nbsp; The second two days of training were straight forward and easier to deal with than the first. I have also met a lot more people and have been introduced to some great places. There is this crazy tiny bar down a small alleyway which has what looks like about 20000 cds stacked up on the wall and you can choose whatever you want to listen to. They also do an all you can drink over two hours for about 12.50! I mistakingly however started talking about the war with regards to my grandfather. In japan you really dont mention the war, its ultimate taboo. Im also not allowed to talk about sex and drugs in my lessons. &nbsp; I have also discovered this really cool cyber cafe which also has pool tables, darts, video games, and amaaaaazing massage chairs. Everything is charged at an hourly rate, i.e 2.50 which is good value for money. In fact it would seem rather fallacious to think of Japan as expensive... well in relative terms to Britain in anycase.„ÄÄBooks, Cds and Beer is the same if not a bit Cds and Beer is the same if not a bit cheaper. Eating out can also be very cheap. Internal transport is pricey but you get what you pay for, which you don:t in britain. &nbsp; Kumamoto seems to have a relaxed and a very youthful atmosphere (there are seven universities) Bizarreley all the night clubs anÔΩÑ music seems to be mostly hip hop and there are even is a small community of„ÄÄafrican americans here. There are also a few younguns who americans here. There are also a few younguns who have been to south east asia, have tried pot and become all mellow and chilled! &nbsp; I now have a mobile phone! Very exciting, the camera on it mobile phone! Very exciting, the camera on it is better than my actual camera! I also have a mobile email which I will be using a lot and which you can now email me directly. (N.B i may not give very long replies as im not sure of how much it costs for a long email, but please email me on it anyway as I dont have to pay to go to the chat room to recieve an emil.) &nbsp; I am also thinking of selling japanese stuff so if you have any requests I will be able to do some research and get back to you;  urlLink www.japanesecoolstuff.blogspot.com  sayonara!

      I know what u mean - wandering around a new country, absorbing  everything  - can be information-overload. I've only been to Switzerland & Netherlands by myself and that was dizzying enough..   When do u start teaching proper?  Hopefully the infamous Japanese courtesy and humbleness will ease ur transition!  Dunno what your computer setup is, but if u really want to experience local life, u gotta download  urlLink Mario Forever  - it put Japan on the map for me!  It must feel strange to be an obvious ethnic minority.. Try not to erase ur memories with gallons o' alcyhol!  Templor hasn't done much today.. Walked into a cupboard and cut a 1" gash into my big toe.. Cooked some potato dauphinoise, ate a couple of blueberry muffins..  Anyway hope all goes smoothly!  kris

      Well im a few days into Japan and it has been a crazy induction. I never appreciated what culture shock was untill I came here. I feel like ive drunk about fifty cups of coffee but feel knackered. Theres so much to absorb that it can be a bit overwelming. I feel like a baby just taking everything in and staring aimelessly. I woke up on saturday at three a bit dazed and confused and just walked around and got the feel of the city. The first thing you realise and probably what is the the MOST striking element is the monculutural nature of Japan, thats not to say there is a lot if western influence (the first advert I saw was a picuture of referee Collina advertising profiteroles!!) But there aint many foreigners in Japan (probably 100 to 200 in my city of 661000) and you do stand out. Japanese ÔΩêÔΩÖÔΩèÔΩêÔΩåÔΩÖ„ÄÄÔΩÑÔΩèÔΩéÔΩî„ÄÄÔΩìÔΩîÔΩÅÔΩíÔΩÖ„ÄÄat you because they consider it impolite but you know theyre pearing at you from the corner of their eye and you get the occasional exclamations of gaijin (foreigner.)Having said that they are incredibly friendly, I had a very broken conversation with some ladies on the train and they seemed really interested in what i was doing and where I was from. Similarly on my second night I went to an irish bar downtown and got asked by a couple of Japanese girls to go to the beach with them. They are incredibly genuine and unduplicitous which I am not used to although you do need to be particularly astute in reading into their feelings because they dont like to reveal to much. They tend to have gone ooooh and aaaah quite a lot which could mean I dont have a f ing clue what you are saying! I have already started to nod incessantly which they all do over here as well which is a sign of conformism.    I started training today which was very scary, particulalry after having drunk half a bottle of absinthe the night before.  After 2 hours I was made to conduct part of a lesson and then another bit onto that all within a frantic time limit.  I also had to make evaluations about pupils performance. My brain didnt work and I almost felt half dead but somehow I got through, thank god my trainer is nice!

      Well I had my first day of work on firday and it seemed like it went off without a hitch, although I did only have two classes. I was invited by two fellow employees to go over to theirs afterwards. One of them who is a wee bit eccentric methinks asked me to make a bloodstain on her scrapbook. That was no problem as I had a massive scab from a cycling accident (by the way i now cycle unnbeleivebly) The only problem beibng is that it bled massively and I ended up feeling a bit quesy not to mention staining my shirt. Last night I had my first proper proper experience of a&nbsp;mexican restaurant which certainly dispelled the bad&nbsp;experiences I have previously had. Also went to a funky trip hop club where I met some american military police who are stationed not far away. I also met a fellow english teacher who studied french and german at southampton! Small world small world... My Japanese is making tentative steps forward... but&nbsp;im on a steep learning curve.

      Well its been another few interesting days in Japan....  A couple of nights ago I went to a bar with a friend, everything was cool and then she took a photo of the adjacent table as she knew someone on it. The next minute I know there is this incredibly angry man trying to start on my friend and spitting at our table. Through the mediation of his romanian wife we learn that he was very angry at having his picture taken. Thankfully she pacifies him and takes him out. I later learn that he is a japanese pimp and his wife is probably one of his hoes....  Other than that I have been meeting more foreigners out here all of whom seem very nice and pleasant. Its quite easy to get to know people fast. I seem to have bumped into loads of people in the main shopping arcade already. Teaching is going alright although I had my first kids lesson which was a bit of a disaster. The two kids were completely hyper and i couldnt control them. One even flashed his willy and I dont think the mother was too impressed&nbsp; (they can observe everything.)  My cycling skills are gradually improving, which is pretty impressive considering I had previously hated it. But you cant avoid it over here and its very handy for getting out and about.  Have also been to the cinema which is the only thing I have discovered that is out and out more expensive than the uk, 1700 yen which is about 8.50 a tad pricey. Otherwise things like cds, videos and„ÄÄbooks are all the same. Transport is a wee bit more expensive but 100 times better.  ÔΩÉÔΩôÔΩÅÔºÅ

      It has been over two weeks since my arrival in Japan, it has gone so fast but at the same time it feels like a lifetime ago that I was in England.&nbsp; This week I have been mainly settling in and getting into the grove of things as they say. Teaching english has been pretty straightforward in terms of syllabus, but challenging in terms of application.&nbsp;Japanese students tend to be on the shy side and it is sometimes quite an effort getting them to talk, particularly if they are lower levels and I get looks of bemusement (wha? wha? me no undastan?)It seems as if it as much about getting them relaxed as teaching them anything. The nightlife out here has been "eventful" and "unpredictable" and generally a lot of fun. Still sampling many delights of japanese cuisine. Theyre obsessed with food over here, even more than the french.&nbsp; Every other program on tv seems to be about food and you get the obligitory taster with the inevitable chorus of oishi! (tasty.) Right I must be off now as im going to a barbecue!  If you want an idea of some of the interesting people working here go to  urlLink www.japanagogo.com   sayonara

      Well its been another interesting and crazy week in Japan....  I put up an ad for language exchange a week or so ago. At first I just recieved the one reply which I was quite content with. Then two, three, four and now its about twenty million at my last counting, all female all looking for a western boyfriend. I actually got quite excited at the prospect of teaching a guy but it turned out to be another girl. Dont get me wrong its flattering to recieve so much attention but now its starting to get ridiculous.  The longer I have been in Japan the more fascinating and intriguing Japanese society has become. I think it would be an amazing job to be a psychologist out here. There is such a schizophrenic sense of "seeming" and "being" out here that is pretty screwed up from my western perspective. "Seeming" is everything, your appearance, your manners and above all not losing face. "Being" is totally different you can act totally different and be totally different as long as your under the guise of seeming. The one exception I have seen of this is evening drinking culuture at night where the rules of what is acceptable change dramatically. Things often simmer on the surface too, hence you have totally normal looking "bookshops" that are basically 90 percent porn, playing videos for anyone to see, men reading pornos in bookshops and school girl knicker vending machines. Japanese morality dictates therefore that as long as nobody knows im doing wrong then its ok.  The only thing that has really been bothering me however is David Beckhams shameless advertising of chocolate coated macadamia nuts.
