      AnonamousDyke IF this were a script I'd start with some schmaltzy dialogue, but this isn't. It's just a blog about me. It's my life; it's day-to-day mundane details.  I keep several blogs. Two I let my friends read and this one, well, is for you, the readers and me. I'm anonymous here; on my others I write my name and name my friends. It's open but personal and yet a little closed off. I don't talk about my inner most secrets and feelings. Here I do.  Let me tell you about myself. I'm close to 30. My high school just had its 10-year reunion. Nothing special, but I wouldn't know, I skipped it. I'm not overly fond of the people I graduated with and with my physical condition, I didn't really want them to see me and think of me as the woman who got fat after graduation, which would be a fair assessment. IÂd like to think there's more to me, but really, that's about all I've done with myself.  I'm an artist, but that's where I'll leave this, since this blog is about anonaminity, I won't go into the who, what where and why of me.  I work for a multi-national company that is really just a high-end grocery store. I tell myself IÂm doing more than working at a grocery store, but it's not true.  I lie to myself a lot. It's part of who I am.  I've told myself for a long time that I havenÂt gained as much weight as I have. I tell myself I'm happy when I'm not. I tell myself I like my job when I hate it. Worst of all I tell myself I'm achieving something when really I'm hawking consumer goods to consumers. I'm not saving the planet because the goods I hawk happen to be organic or responsibly grown. It doesn't matter I'm still killing you and me slowly by giving into the consumer greed of the US. The goods I sell are grown in Columbia and Ecuador by people paid a pittance while you pay top dollar and have flowers for your $500,000 foyer. (We both justify this by telling ourselves that it's third world country and the people are happy for some money, and at least where they work has running water, but if we weren't there buying their goods they wouldn't have even that.) It's so easy to play the justification game. Make yourself and myself feel better by telling ourselves lies about who and what we are.  Is this a rambling introduction? It is, but that's me. In reading this you should come to realize that this is how I am, it's who I am.  I'll start with a run of the mill comparison of my relationship. It's a roller coaster ride. Simple. But it's not; see the carnie who runs my roller coaster took his smoke break an hour ago. Instead of coming back on time he's getting a blowjob behind the control shack. So instead of getting off the roller coaster I'm stuck riding.
