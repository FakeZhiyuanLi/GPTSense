      Not even a week in college, n a  LAFDA  (a fight).  There was this guy in college whom I didn't know but wanted to make friends. with our group. No one objected him but he sat behind me and started to disturb me. I warned him several times but to vein. The next day, same again. I am a very short tempered guy. I tried to be calm but could not. As soon as the professor went out of the class-room, I went up to him and gave him a very hard slap on his face.   He started bleeding. He retaliated and started to scratch my face and at that very moment I gave him a second slap. Now he was bleeding really badly and he went off giving me a warning that he would beat me up with the help of seniors.   Those warnings were that, just warnings. He couldn't do anything.   I m fine but with a few scratches on my face.

      Hey ppl., &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; College has satrted. This was my firsst day in college. It was good fun, for the first lecture the teacher didn't come. And we gat the last two lectures free as the electronics department will start later in the week.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The college is good, but the class room feels a bit cramped. &nbsp; &nbsp;The ID - card is really good, n its hi-tech. &nbsp; And the main part is. There was just no ragging. &nbsp; Will keep u'll posted.

      I went to college t'day, to see my roll no. I saw my name in Biology but I wanted Electronics. My father is a very infuencial man, and he had used his influ. to transfer me to Electronics. And it worked. We went there and we paid the fees for Elec. So, I will again go tomm. to get ma new division n collect my identity card.

      Hey, I got admission but the college has not yet started. I hav got admission in Khalsa College. I have taken Science but have still not got vocational. Just keeping my fingers crossed. Well, on my first day to college I expect some ragging (i.e. troubling by my seniors). So, I wont take my cell-phone, cause they can use it to make lots of phonecalls, thus increasing ma bill. I wont even take lots of cash, just the absolute bare necesary.
