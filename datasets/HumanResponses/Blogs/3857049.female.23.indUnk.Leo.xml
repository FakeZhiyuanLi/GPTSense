      I read The Man in the High Castle about a year ago. It was cool to be able to recognize the different San Francisco locales in the book, although I didn't understand one crucial scene until I discovered that there really was an  urlLink Embarcadero Freeway . They tore it down when it was damaged in the  urlLink Loma Prieta  earthquake in 1989. (In California, the big quakes get names.)  In other PKD news, George Clooney and Steven Soderbergh have picked up the  urlLink film rights  to A Scanner Darkly.  Also, if you haven't seen  urlLink Fast, Cheap, and Out of Control , the documentary featuring Rodney Brooks, definitely check it out. Fascinating stuff and terrific filmmaking.

      For maybe two of us who care, the Eno's  urlLink Oblique Strategies  deck has been  urlLink reissued .  50 decks are signed, but are packaged exactly like the other 950.  Jesse, have you read  urlLink  The Man in the High Castle  ?

      From Sam's last post:    A landslide victory in the last poll for Britney Spears, with a 26.3% lead over Bush after nearly 10000 votes cast. Britney Spears, the first woman president of the United States. Why not?     Things can't get worse than they are.  Who would her VP, Sec of State, and Cabinet members be?

      I've been writing my grocery list and some music that I have found particularly inspirational is by a band called  urlLink King Johnson .  They are from Atlanta and, with guitar, bass, drums, sax and trombone,  their influences are primarily New Orleans and James Brown.  I have been a fan of these guys for the last year or so and just got the chance to see them at the old Tringas Theater in Fort Walton.  They are red-hot and super-tight...the hottest act to pass through these parts in memory.  The guitarist, Oliver Wood, is the brother of the Wood from acid jazz greats  urlLink Modeski, Martin and Wood .  We discussed the possibility of us doing a show together.

      I've been writing my book, and on a recommendation that music without words would help me focus better, I have ventured into the realm of  post-rock . Far and away my favorite among these bands is  Godspeed You Black Emperor!  Yes, the exclamation point is part of the name. Alternately haunting and totally rockin'.

      I've been rediscovering my punk roots with  urlLink Iggy Pop  ( CAUTION: UNBELIEVABLY IRRITATING MUSIC LOOP ).  I didn't realize he has a new album out; I may have to see what he's up to these days.  The album I've been listening to is  urlLink Raw Power ; it is at times kinda cheesy, but at times exactly how I want my music to feel.  The song Search and Destroy may be my current favorite song.  You can hear a terrible sounding version of it  urlLink here .  I like this  urlLink review .  The next Iggy album for me is  urlLink Lust for Life .  I'd realized that Black Light Syndrome would probably be pretty painful.  Modern Prog Rock is a disgrace to 70s Prog.

      I bought Wayne Shorter's The Soothsayer album the other day.  This 1965 set features McCoy Tyner and Tony W. together and has some inspired playing.  They wouldn't reunite on record until 1977 for the Supertrio's album.  I also got Bozzio Levin Stevens' Black Light Syndrome record.  I'm not completely sure yet, but so far I think I'd rather tussel with a cow than listen to this record.  I also got Andrew Bird's Bowl of Fire's Oh! The Grandeur.  Has anyone else listened to this?  I think this guy was part of the Squirrel Nut Zippers and I bought this album on a whim because I heard some of his newer album on the radio and liked it.  I'm not sure about this one either.  Last night we went to see Bob Dylan in concert in honor of my brother's 30th birthday.  It's hard to knock Bob too much because he his such an important figure on so many different levels.  Suffice to say though, that nowadays when he says he ain't workin' on Maggies farm no more, he's talking about the song itself.  It wasn't nearly as bad as his forgettable performance on David Letterman's 10th anniversary special, but still largely an exercise in random growling and bad arrangements of his work.

      My only memory of the Fisher-Price little people was that Dave and I had some kind of house (possibly Fisher-Price little people accessory) that would split in half and open up.  You could put a little person in the chimney while the house was split open then slowly close the house until the little person popped out of the chimney like a rocket.

      I did a bunch of Little People research a few months back -- I was trying to get the proportions right for an illustration for my book. You won't believe the  urlLink amount of detail  these collectors have put together (just keep scrolling down!). Travis's Gilligan's Island set (I remember it too!) was not Little People, however, but rather a  urlLink Playskool bathtub toy .

      For Myers-Briggs types, I've always liked the conversational tone of the  urlLink TypeLogic  descriptions (most of which were written by the unfortunately named Joe Butt). However, their  urlLink mousepads  are pretty cheesy. (Travis: In Keirsey's nomenclature, architect is a sub-type of rational, corresponding to INTP. FWIW.)

      It sounds like you're an INTP or INTJ Trav.  I'm an INTP according to my Meyers Briggs test (they don't offer an actual Meyers Briggs online).  The way it was explained to me is that these are indicators of your comfort zones.  Of course we all have free will, jobs, and parents so we don't always end up where we'd most like to be.  Meyers Briggs is to Jungian psychologists what Linda Goodman was to libidinous lounge lizards...what's your type sweet thang?  If you thought Tobacco companies were scary, check out the other  urlLink white lie ?

      Keirsey says I'm rational, humanmetrics says I'm an architect.  I think the humanmetrics test was better.  Every question was easy for me to answer; Less indecision.  That's pretty fun.  They don't tell you the bad stuff, though.  "You are a self-centered egomaniac who ignores the input of others and is likely to go completely bonkers in the relatively near future."

      I think we've got most of the ST figures that might be turning up at Big Lots.  It's interesting; most toy companies make tons of figures, can't get rid of them, and have to blow them out.  These practices destroy collectibility.  Playmates (who made the Star Trek toys forever) usually make about the right amount of toys.  You can find what you want, but if you wait, they'll be gone forever.

      Finally, another  urlLink ice skating scandal !  I was getting so tired of fruitless searches for religious fanatics and all the talk of that American Talib.  Finally we get back to the stuff that really tugs at my heart strings.  This reminds me, are any of you bloggers familiar with the late comedian  urlLink Bill Hicks ?  He was truly an "ahead of his time" funny-man and his routines would definitely suite many a sensibility of you bloggers.  He was around the Sam Kenison era and Dennis Leary ripped off so much from him it's not even funny.  His stuff was truly subversive and pretty amazing considering the temperament of the 80's.

If you haven't ever listened to Reich you should prepare yourself for a maximum of minimalism.  Tension and release are a long-time comin' if you get my drift.  If you can stomach the ride, it's well worth the trip...i think.  Also taken off my local music store's hands was a copy of Mahavishnu's  urlLink Birds of Fire .  I didn't have it on CD, so now I do.  Tension and release happen very quickly in this band.  The Shiner site is great.  Flash makes for big fun.

      WARNING: MUSIC WILL PLAY WHEN YOU FOLLOW THE LINK.  (just don't have it turned up too loud, and have a cable modem at least) I thought you'd dig this  urlLink Flash .  Not that the programming's all that tricky, but the jukebox plays all of their songs off all of their albums (some of which are out of print).  I listened to it for hours tonight.  Probably my favorite album right now is Starless.  The drummer is into Tony Williams and Bill Bruford and incorporates some of their stuff into the songs.  Listen to the chorus of the first song off of the album Starless, called Spinning.  I love the way the fills resolve into a traditional rock drumbeat; reminds me of Bernie saying that all music is just tension and release.

Here's a fun  urlLink mythology  site that I think some of you might enjoy.   urlLink Vectorpark  is really cool.  Make sure you spend some time there because it can take awhile to catch on to everything you can do.  By the way Trav, sometime you have to remind me of the link that holds great animus toward Nancy that you mentioned to me on the streets of San Antonio.  The one Tim G. didn't respond to.  And finally (am I being a blog hog), I present to the blog the  urlLink Web site  of a Dr. whose name, in light of his chosen speciality, will make you laugh.

If there's any interest, I can make MP3's available.  It's noisy and raucous but also pretty inventive and sounds completely out of place for 1968.  The last track includes Sun Ra and goes way out.

       Bill, the bb cards are a GREAT alternative to biz cards and have a higher visibility factor -- more visual appeal and you can get more info on the back.  The fish looks HUGE!  Dang, you have always had special luck fishing; I know it had to be good eating.  Re: your comments on B. Dylan songs, I agree, though you would think that with Dylan's rep for being prodigiously glib, he might have spontaniously come up with a humorous couplet or two somewhere in "See You Later Allen Ginsberg" instead of the mindless repetition we get.  Btw, I think that is A. Ginsberg singing backup (was recorded over at his Greenwich Village apartment).   The cut, "Everybody Must Get Stoned" was recorded in Nashville with a bunch of great but straight N'ville studio musicians including the legendary Charley McCoy.  When it came time to do the take, Bob asked, "What do you guys do around here for fun?".  Somebody responded with, "We play golf on weekends, bowl..."  "No, what do you DO around here.  There is NO way I am going to cut this song with a bunch of stone cold sober backup musicians" ... or words to that effect.  Dylan soon realized they were in the dark so he sent out for shooters from the local bar and everybody proceeded to get roaring drunk.  Somebody pulled out an old marching drum, a trombone player was called in at 3 am and...well, the rest is history.   Oh yeah, looking forward to R. Howard's take on what really happened at the Alamo.  You might be interested to know a Garrett fought and died there.

      I didn't know Bob Dylan did a bad song.  Maybe that is why everyone is having so much trouble...  : )  Thanks Jim for remembering the Mount Freshmore album cover.  It is certainly an  honor that they chose our idea.  We had gone to a movie (I don't remember which one).  We were tossing around some ideas and then you came up with that one.  I thought it was clever, so set out doing some preliminary sketches until I found one that worked with the concept..  We mailed it in for their consideration and they decided to use it.  It was really fun.  I had the original sketches but haven't seen them for years.  Ray might have them.   Speaking of What's Wrong With This Picture, Jab Wilson, Billy's partner, was pretty startled.  The three of us had a good laugh about it.  Whoever designed it is a sicko (in a godd way, of course).. .

      Jim my vote goes to #2 (add poo joke here).  Dylan clearly had too much in  urlLink vein  when he wrote about that heroin(e).  Somebody stop me.   Speaking of Jim...I was listening to (and thereby degrading)  urlLink Jim Hall's  It's Nice To Be With You album last night.  Talk about someone who makes every note count.  I love his guitar playing and the moods he evokes.  He's like the Miles of electric guitar.  Incidentally, Daniel Humaire plays drums on this album and years ago I found it at the FSU school of music on CD when Travis and I were looking for Daniel Humaire sessions.  It's a great album.  Travis, a  urlLink guy  at the record show alerted me to an album he plays on by Jean Luc Ponty called  urlLink Sunday Walk .   Jim since you mentioned turntables, there's a place here in Austin that specializes in vintage high end audio stuff like Marantz, McIntosh, Dual, and other great tube and early solid state stuff.  They are called  urlLink Circle Stereo .

       Sam, those old vinyls will be great collectors items -- the longer you hang onto them, the more valuable they become.  Btw, you might want to think about finding an old turntable to throw into the deal (if you should ever decide to sell them).  Not many of those left around either ;-)  Re: "Freshmore" by the Four Freshmen...my sister Nan and I get credit on  the album for Cover Art Concept or something.  It was my idea, Nancy's drawing was featured on the cover.  Ray asked, "What should we put on the cover?" and we all stared blankly at each other.  Thats when it hit me: "Mt. Froshmore!"   Btw, I have been informed by inuendo that my  urlLink "Whats Wrong With This Picture?"  puzzle was...well, a little sick.  One guy said it sent his six year old screaming from the room...  Ok, then...here's a change of pace.  How about this?  Its time for the "THE BOB DYLAN'S WORST SONG CONTEST" contest*  * Don't get me wrong, I like the guy.  Have just finished the B. Dylan bio "Down the Highway".  Interesting to learn the story behind the songs.  I checked out after about his dozenth album, so have had about 20 years of B. Dylan to catch up on ;)  I personally consider him the greatest vocalist of our time.  From the crystalline purity of  urlLink "Song for Woody"  to the emotional lament of his MTV Unplugged version of  urlLink "Shooting Star" , his vocal style has never stopped changing.  His lyrics are always provacative.  Anyway, after a 117 DLs of every Dylan mp3 I could grab off Bearshare -- and an almost equal number of great songs -- I have uncovered a couple of entries for the "THE BOB DYLAN'S WORST SONG CONTEST" contest.  You be the judge...  1.  urlLink "See You Later Allen Ginsberg"   2.  urlLink "Is Your Love in Vain?"   Well, Ladies and Gentlemen, there they are.  You tell me which one of these turkeys take the prize.  You may have other favorite worse song entries for the "THE BOB DYLAN'S WORST SONG CONTEST" contest.  Or something else completely off topic to add, or not...in any case, its your turn.  JRG

      I agree with you on the vinyl.  I'm by no means a big audiophile lp guy, but they are out there.  I did buy 17 albums for $80 though, something you just can't do on CD.  I've attempted to record some beloved albums on my computer and then clean them up with some software I have.  It works, but it takes some time and effort.    Thanks for the Four Freshman info.  Ray is definitely the man.  I remember how cool those binders Trav had with all of those FF charts were.  The album I got was one I remember hearing with Trav many times called Four Freshman and Five Trombones.  They didn't have Psonic Sunspot Trav.  I did see 25 O'clock though.  I should have mentioned that they also have cd's, dvd's, and back issues of soft core pornography (Vanna White in Playboy anyone?) at these shows too...my mistake ( :.    I'm digging the Nissan so far.  I don't know if it can roast tires.  I don't want to find out given what I paid for them (YIKES...I didn't read your message until after I got back from the tire store!).

      I really enjoy a good record show, but, ultimately, any way you slice it, in terms of audio quality and durability, vinyl cannot stand up to CD.  With every play on a turntable vinyl degrades.  Not so with digital AND the audio quality is just plain more transparent.  Do an A/B comparison: take your favorite LP and compare it to the CD.  It's quieter (less extraneous hiss) and cleaner.  I hear things on CD that I have not heard in a thousand listens of vinyl.  It is the nature of the medium.  Please feel free to refute me.

      MXV4s are really nice, pretty expensive tires.  They were the nicest tire we sold at Sam's.  Not really high mileage, but ultra high quality.  I love Nissans; they are my favorite japanese car maker.  And Maxima's are generally pretty tough cars.  Will it roast the tires?   I wanted to go with you to the record show, but didn't get paid again this weekend and am corespondingly destitute.  The only album I'm always looking for is the Euro release of Psionic Sunspot that has a gatefold album cover.  Gotta go; I'm trying to get  urlLink Scorched Earth  to work on my computer.

      Hey,  A big glob of mayonaise just fell out of my  urlLink Krystal  burger onto my nice, white shirt.   urlLink Damn !  I'm so hungry it seems worth it.  That can't be right...    urlLink Here  is at least one thing that Matt Pinfield is up to.    Sam, if that record show has  urlLink Four Freshmen  records, it's gotta be cool.  I think I may have one of the most extensive Four Freshmen mp3 libraries out there.  I have been collecting them for years now.  Tell me the best way to share it and I will be happy to.  You may or may not know that , on the  urlLink audio page  at the official FF website, they take great pride in trying to feature ONE song from EACH of the Freshmen's 30-something (or more) albums.  They are almost there.  The one song that they chose to feature off of Mount Freshmore (the record Ray Brown did with them), is a song that Ray, himself, arranged for that record,   urlLink Here's That Rainy Day  , and for good reason.  The arrangement is completely unique and unlike any other song you will ever hear by the Freshmen. Ray, to his everlasting credit, continued the tradition that the Freshmen started of stretching the musical possibilities of vocal arrangements.  The chords AND time are all Ray and totally different from any song the Freshmen have ever recorded, before or since.  Also, note that  Here's That Rainy Day  is one of the few songs that is featured in its entirety.  Most of the tunes are just clips.  Ray has played with royalty, literally and figuratively.  Get him to tell you about jamming with the King of Thailand.  Ray, friends, is the real deal.   Congrats on the car!

      Went to the record show today and got lots of stuff.  John McLaughlin, David Torn, Bruford, Mingus, Four Freshman, Monk, Buddy Rich, McCoy Tyner, and Kenny Dorham were all represented in my shopping cart by day's end.  I saw Matt Pinfield of MTV 120 minutes fame...twice no less.  I don't know what he does now, but he seems like a stand up guy.  Oh yea...I bought a car later too.  A Maxima to be exact.  Trav, remember the brown (double meaning intended) Maxima and the way it talked.  I got the car because it was a kick ass deal that I couldn't pass up.  1999 SE "limited" that I bought "as is" because it had just been traded an hour before.  The dealer made a profit without having to do any thing to the car and I benefited by paying under invoice.  I've never had a vehicle this nice and I'm having a little bit of the automotive version of white guilt but hopefully it will pass.  I've got to get new tires for it and my Dad recommends Michelin Energy MXV4 Plus tires.  Travis do these tires sound OK to you Mr. tire guy?  Bill your forearms look remarkably like Lee Haney's?  Get your vintage vinyl requests to me soon blog if you got 'em.  Tomorrow's my last chance to make it to the record convention.

      Cool pics Bill.  I was wonderin' though...could you try and get more of your forearm in the shot next time?   Yea, Trav the stalking pics were too weird.  Awfully close range for clandestine shots me thinks.  He's definitely the vapid voyeur.  From what I read on the Woods amp site the things sound pretty rare.  At least in France!  I wonder if there's any E-bay action on em'.  Has anybody done much E-bay?  What were the results?  This reminds me, the  urlLink Austin Record  (LP not probate) Convention is this weekend.  Trav, I'd love it if you would make a surprise appearance but I invite any bloggers to put in requests for rare recorded music because this thing is huge and I'm likely to find it.

      I don't hate all midi files, just...yeah, I hate all midi files.  Trav, that is the hottest forearm site I have ever seen!  Sam, years ago I did a search for Walter Woods amps to no avail.  I am happy to see some info on the web about them finally.  I have posted a couple of pics I took of this model.  There is no model number on the thing.  The  urlLink first pic  is of the front panel.  It is funny the way they have labeled the controls.  There are three big knobs labeled "lows", "highs" and "middles" and if you look closely you might be able to see the two switches which are switchable to "more", "same" or "less".  The  urlLink second pic  is of the side panel, which has a bunch of writing, most of which we care little about except for "120 watts RMS into 4 ohms", which is pretty strong considering the whole unit is only about 12" x 7" x 4" and weighs under 5 lbs.

      Wow Bill, that's the best news I've gotten all week!   Sam, yes that is a Woods amp, but the one Bill found is a smaller lower power version about the size of a cigar box.  Still really cool, though.  Didn't anybody think the weird link ( urlLink this ) in the middle of the McLaughlin post was worth comment?  I have no problem with alternative sexuality but I thought that was plain weird (and it's creepy to sneak around taking close up pics of unsuspecting womens' forearms).

      Thanks for the John McLaughlin links Trav.  Yesterday TMBG was on our local radio station talking and playing some.  They're in town right now for SXSW.

Since I didn't get the TMBG  urlLink Sapphire  connection at first (I'm terrible at remembering song titles) here   urlLink are  some  urlLink cool  sites I  urlLink found  in the process.  I knew I'd get in trouble for bringing up Ozzy ( :  As I write this I'm listening to the Inner Mounting Flame midi style.  You weren't kidding Trav...too funny.

      OK I'll say it...I'm a huge fan of  urlLink the Osbournes , the new "reality" family show on MTV.  I find it laugh out loud funny most of the time.  The family is as much remarkable as it is blandly wholesome which makes for interesting television.  Ozzy cracks me up and the kids I think, are hysterical.  The mom...well "cukoo cachoo Mrs. Robinson" is all I have to say about her (now I'm really revealing too much).  Ozzy has been a guilty pleasure of mine for a while (I can hear laughing), and I encourage everyone to check out the show.  If you hate it, I'm sorry.

      Bill...great web site (underdogblues et. al.).  For some reason 106 sounded like a lot of years and I never subtracted it from 2002 to realize that it couldn't possibly be right.  Texas was already 51 years into it's statehood by then (dorky state trivia fact: Texas and Florida were both annexed in 1845, Mr. James K. Polk presiding).  Ah Texas!  As Floridians, it's still hard to get over the people here and their state pride.  Every ad is Texocentric and bubba's even get state tattoos.  I like to piss off Texans by referring to it as the "One Star State".

Finally:  urlLink a modern classic    Don't rent these videos from blockbuster video ;  they edit the  hell  out of guys like Cronenberg, Lynch, and Argento.

Has anyone seen Spiderman yet?

      I've thinking about it, and I'd like to get Carter a decent guitar for his birthday/Christmas this year.  Buddy is gonna feel him out and figure out exactly what he wants, but I'm thinking mexican  urlLink Strat  or  urlLink Tele  (depending on what he wants).  These run $350 and I'd lke everyone in the family to contribute (remember this is for his birthday and christmas).  So Uncle Bill, mom, Uncle Jim, myself, Buddy are the names on the list so far.  That's about $70 a piece or $35 per holiday for Carter.  I know this may be a bit generous for a Christmas gift for some of us who have to buy a hundred Christmas gifts, but that's why I'm tackling it so early in the year.  Please let me know if you're in or out.

      Mother, I edited Tony's post and inserted the nancy friendly statement.  I do this to prevent people from seeing explicit pornagraphic images that they may not want to see.  I don't care if you click it or not (I thought Tony's post was pretty funny), but the Nancy friendly label is also a warning that a link might not be work safe.  I will now change Tony's message to reflect the fact that I altered it and will try to do this in the future so as to prevent further confusion.    However, it's good to see someone posting besides Jennifer and Sam.

      Hi Tony.  Glad to hear from you after all this time.  Hope you are well.  I am debating on whether or not to take your "bait."  I am not sure what "Nancy friendly" (or not) means so am curious, as can be expected.   I think I like having my name bandied about as a term used to protect  urlLink mom-ness  and the  urlLink shockable  , even if it is attached to a term of  urlLink censorship  .

      Jesse James urlLink  Garrett  is my new hero.  Travis and I sit down to have a little talk about what I'm up to in graduate school the other day and he say's, "hey  that sounds kind of like what Jesse does."  "Neat" methinks, "show me more."  And so he does...and it turns out what I'm learning is not only  like  what JJG does, it's what JJG is leading, innovating, crafting, shaping, exploring, discussing, and pioneering.  He's the Elvis if IA.  He's Venus and Serena Williams combined, with a little Doug Flutie thrown in for good measure.  Forget Cook, Cabot, Magellen...it's Prince Jesse the Web navigator whose exploring our new frontiers.  Imagine, me someday sharing with my grandkids the story of how my dog Shay once launched herself through a window displacing a large pane of glass that broke on the forehead of the brother of the father of information architecture.  I knew Jesse was destined for big things when I first met him.  Anybody that can correctly identify the Henry Winkler directed classic   urlLink Cop and 1/2   simply by hearing the names: Ray Sharkey, Sammy Hernandez, and Frank Sivero you just know is going places.  I tell you what...you degarretttypes...you are some special people.

      Carter's guitar has been purchased.  It's a beautiful natural wood grain Yamaha Telecaster copy I found in Fort Walton.  I told Carter I was thinking about buying it for myself, we went down and he played it some and said he thought it was a really cool guitar.  The total cost for it and a case was exactly $250.  As I recall, Jesse, Christine, Mom, Billy (Carmen?), Me, and maybe Buddy were going in on it.  That's about $40 per person.  I'll see if I can't think of anyone else to get in on the deal.

       urlLink For anime fans.   It's funny that you post Donnie Darko links; Jennifer and I watched it recently and were divided on our opinions.  She liked it I thought it was really slow and ultimately went nowhere.  How did you guys feel about it?

      I just got the new 30Gig Ipod and it's amazing.  8Gigs into it already and my music collection is now being appreciated like never before.  I just set it to random and let it fly.  Having 7500 songs at my finger tips with all kinds of playlist possibilities is spawning ideas in the rocky recesses of my mind.  Most significant for me, is thinking about how cool it would be to have unlimited index possibilities with music.  I want to find things with certain side men, in certain keys, time signature, moods, produced by X, recorded in winter, mono, stereo, 1982, and any other attribute of my choosing.  Somewhere in all of this information is the key (no pun intended) to why we all like certain things and in how we know where to look next to expand our musical horizons.  I want to teach my Ipod why I like certain things and then have it go find related things that I might also like.    Am I full of crap?  What kinds of ways can you all think of to organize your collection?

Just mouse over "galleries' when you get there.    urlLink Here  are some great pics of my former bandmate, Duke Bardwell, back in 1973  playing bass with Elvis Presley.  I stumbled across them at a  urlLink site  which centers  around The King's many  urlLink jumpsuits .  If you are interested, there are more  Duke and Elvis resources  urlLink here , including an extensive  urlLink interview  with Duke  about his time working with Elvis.  It is a great read.

      Last night I watched a movie about the making of the last  urlLink Wilco  album.   The movie, "I am Trying to Break Your Heart," is really, really good.  It chronicles the band's attempt to make and release an album that their record label dubbed "too musically adventurous."  The album, "Yankee Hotel Foxtrot," is so good that I think every person who reads this blog would enjoy it.  It has become one of my current favorites.  Also, if you own a copy of "YHF," you can download a free copy of an EP that Wilco released in Austrailia.  Look for the link at the bottom of the Wilco homepage.  Finally, in celebration of me finaly downloading a pretty good copy of Martix Reloaded, here's a  urlLink link  on how to  urlLink hack the matrix .

      Some movie recommendations that seemed right up some of ya'll's alley:   Young and Dangerous  was so wildly popular in Asia, it has spawned 5 sequels and a prequel, 5 official spin-off movies, AND countless rip-offs The best entry in the series, however, is the ORIGINAL. A group of youth led by Chan Ho-Nam (Ekin Cheng), Chicken (Jordan Chan), and Baau Pei (Jerry Lamb), join the Hun Hing Triad, experience the ups and downs of gang life, and form bonds through friendship and loyalty. The whole film is shot mostly at nighttime, and captures Hong Kong's famous neon-glitzy scenes. The very stylish camera work, mixed with comic book images and slick visual effects, make this a modern day classic. Andrew Lau also directed last years Hong Kong smash hit Infernal Affairs as well as our second Hong Kong Sunday feature this calendar, A MAN CALLED HERO.    VERSUS  Zombies.  Time-travel.  Kung fu.  Gangsters.  What the heck else needs to be said?  This is for all of you who checked out 28 Days and don't feel like spinning your heels waiting for the weird remake of Dawn of the Dead.  Get your insane zombie action now without having to buy another Resident Evil game.  Don't believe me?  Check out what the Chicago Tribune had to say:    ?Imagine a movie that?s a cross between RESEVOIR DOGS, John Woo?s THE KILLER, KWAIDAN, NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD, EVIL DEAD and DEAD ALIVE and you?ll get an idea of what VERSUS is like; a yakuza-zombie movie of unrelenting comic ferocity? fast, kinetic? outrageously stylish??

End of Evangelion  Giant destructive aliens called Angels have landed, each with hostile intent. Only pilots of bio-organic mechas called EVAs are able to fight them, and succeed in destroying them all. However, with the arrival of the 13th and last Angel, it is discovered that perhaps these ?aliens? are not so alien after all, and their arrival signals a chain of events that would ultimately spell ultimate doom for humanity. The fate of the world has been placed on the shoulders of one particular EVA pilot, a most unwilling and frightened 14 year-old boy named Shinji Ikari.
