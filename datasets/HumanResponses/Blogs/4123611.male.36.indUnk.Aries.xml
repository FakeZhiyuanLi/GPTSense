      As I promised, I've been watching the Olympics religiously. Here's a blog that I've enjoyed following ( urlLink Scott Goldblatt ). It is done by Scott Goldblatt who is on the US Swimming team. He's blogging and journaling his experience. It has been fun to see the games from the athlete's point of view. His race ( urlLink 4x200 Freestyle relay ) is today.  I've probably enjoyed the swimming the most up until this point. We've also been following some of the Hungarian's. We watched  urlLink Timea Nagy  win the Gold in fencing on Sunday. I've never watched much fencing, but it was fun to root for our adopted country. The kids are getting into it as well. Kendall wanted to wear US colors today and she was searching the house for something to wear.

      Well, I'm not ashamed to admit it, I have Olympic Fever.  I normally enjoy the Olympics when they roll around every couple of years, but this year I'm looking forward to them more than ever.  I'm sure it is because I'm a sports freak and about the only thing there is to watch over here is sumo wrestling, snooker, or soccer (all with audio in Hungarian).    As the Opening Ceremonies start tonight, I won't get to hear  urlLink Bob Costas   on  urlLink NBC  as he makes every Olympic story seem as if 10 year olds will be learning about it in school someday.  I should get to see some American domination (or at least I hope so).  I'll be watching on  urlLink Eurosport  which is a british station that I can only get in Hungarian and Czech.  I figured out how to stream the english audio on my computer, though.   I'm most looking forward to watching  urlLink basketball ,  urlLink track & field  (which the rest of the world calls Athletics - isn't all of this Athletics?),  urlLink diving  and  urlLink swimming .   What are you looking forward to?  or are you not?

      I'm just flat our whining and complaining now, but last night my satellite TV went out.  I was following some instructions on how to get it updated and poof, there went my signal.  It could have something to do with the fact that I was reading the instructions in Hungarian.  I actually had to change the menus to Hungarian so that I could follow them.   Here's the website where I had to find the instructions  urlLink www.upc.hu .  Check out the English equivalent (which has almost no information)  urlLink www.upcdirect.hu/english  .     I think my body has become magnetic.  Anything electronic that I touch goes poof.  I'm sure that this blog will crash as soon as I post this.   Feel free to cry along with me.  I'm hoping not to miss the Opening Ceremonies of the  urlLink Olympics .

      I was making breakfast for my kids this morning when I heard a funny noise from my PocketPC. It sounded sort of like an alarm, but not only did I not have any alarms for this morning, it wasn't a sound I normally hear. As I looked down at it, I realized that it had restarted and erased all of my data!!! I had a backup and I knew I could put it back until . . . it did it again 30 seconds later . . . and then again . . . over and over all day long.  Later, I got out my computer to see if I could salvage the morning and it was responding very slowly. I looked at my error log and I was getting a bunch of disk errors. When I clicked the link for Microsoft to tell me what it meant, here's the message "If these events are logged regularly on a primary system drive, replace the device.  "If these events are logged regularly on a primary system drive, replace the device ."   There went the rest of my day. Bad hard drive . . . impossible to replace here in Budapest.  I am typing on the computer right now so it is still hanging on, but I figure it is just a matter of time.  Feel free to cry along with me. I'm going to apply for a construction job tomorrow that doesn't require any technology.

       urlLink Channelnewsasia.com  This happened about a mile from our house this afternoon at about 5pm our time.  I was about to start a meeting at work (about 5 miles away) and the building shook.  The guys with me thought a bird hit a window.  Valerie called soon after and said that the blast was extremely strong and the kids ran to the basement to hide.  Others called and reported seeing the fireworks come out of the blast.  I saw them as well when I drove home over an hour later.  It is amazing that only one person was killed.  This was the first news we were able to read on the subject.  The TV news was reporting like crazy, but we couldn't understand a word of it.   Our house is easily within the range of the 3 miles where other houses caught fire.    It was quite an exciting evening.  Thankfully, we are going to bed safe!!

      I had to take my son to the Orthodontist this morning in downtown Budapest. In the US, anytime that you had to "Go Downtown" for something, it is never a good thing. You would think the same would be true here in a city of 2.5 million. It was a great time! We took Public Transportation (several busses and trams) and relaxed along the way. There were no hassles with traffic or parking. We enjoyed seeing the city and watching the people. My son loves it!! He is always bummed when we drive there because it isn't nearly as adventurous.   The main down side is that it takes a little longer, but if you have the time then it is great!!!  It will definately be one of the things that I will miss when I return to the US.

      In the category of challenges of living overseas, we have found it near impossible to find presents for our children.  Valerie searched all morning just to find some Playmobile toys for Kirby Ann's birthday on Sunday.  When she did find them, they were easily twice the cost of stores in the US.   Here's to hoping that overseas shipping gets cheaper.  amazon.com here I come!!
