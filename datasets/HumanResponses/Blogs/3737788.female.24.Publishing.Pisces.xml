      The  narcolepsy  is back - yeah, stop this rock 'n' roll party girl! Met up with  LawyerGirl  last night, had two glasses of wine and a lovely time, but then went home and fell asleep on my bed at 9.30pm. Woke up at 11.40pm long enough to scrape the caked facepaint off and desperately gulp some water before passing back out again.  Classy .  I'm now  selling  on stuff on eBay - it's the only way to fund my crack vintage habit.  All my lovely friends have been lovely this week - many thanks to all. Particularly,  FastestViolinInTheWestBoy ,  LawyerGirl ,  TummyFromHeavenGirl  and  EightiesDisasterMovieBoy , who have all offered to take me drinking, or take me on  mini road trips , or generally look after me. You guys  rock .

      Every cloud has a silvery lining, and mine today has been the discovery of gloriously guilt-free experience that is  comfort shopping . Yes, I have been PayPal-ing away my sorrows to people I have never met in far-flung places, for second hand ephemera and exotica.  So far, I have purchased one  vintage dress  and one 14k gold  mermaid charm  for my charm bracelet. My watch list also includes:  Three pairs of  cowboy boots  (one white, one black, one grey with black toes) Two more  vintage dresses  A wraparound skirt with  cherries  on it  I don't know why shopping is so therapeutic. There are clearly important psychological processes going on - seeking to buy love? shopping as route to financial oblivion, thus nirvana? I must ask one of the  Editors  in the day job, it's the sort of thing they'd know.  Grief is not only about shopping, but it is also about the transfer of liquids. One loses water as tears, but one gains in the forms of  hot tea  and  wine . I have been trying not to go on a boozy bender this week, given that I sob out my bleeding heart about anything when drunk at the best of time, but the people who love me just keep suggesting alcohol. I shall not refuse their kind attempts at  therapy , in fact I shall line their attempts neatly up on the bar and raise toasts to the fine  Nonna  herself.   Why is it that no matter how sad I am, I am never so unhappy that I lose my appetite? One would have thought at least grief might shift a few stubborn pounds, but I could swear that the saddlebags are loving all of this. Bastards.

      Dear Readers,  Just a quick note today to say that my  Nonna  passed away over the weekend. I hope you'l join me in wishing that, wherever she's gone to, they'll have 24-hour Vatican channel waiting for her.  Love to all x

      Friday morning, praise be to Allah. I am so tired at the moment that I don't want go to bed at night, as it brings me closer to having to get up in the morning...  Last night went to  HippyGirl  and  TooCleverByHalfBoy 's flat to watch  The Game That Has No Name . This morning, I have carpet burns on my knees from sliding across the floor in a moment of excitement, cruelly snatched from me seconds later like a BigMac snatched from a fat teenager. It was good to see the pair of them, and I pray now for more joyous occasions on which to see them.   Slept well afterwards, didn't want to get up today. But nearly the weekend...  ActorBoyfriend 's off on tour doing his Mini Theatre (tm) work every weekend in July, so we're getting in some Quality Time. Basically, eating lots of food, getting pissed, watching  Futurama Season 4  and the new Harry Potter. Ah, true love.  I also home at some point to achieve more on  Skull Candy , the magazine that  EightiesDisasterMovieBoy  and I have been working on for over a year now. Unfortunately, we've been to half-arsed to get anything done yet, but we have a whole bunch of article and I am determined to beat us both with  willow switches  until we achieve something with our live.

       A whole new world... A new fantastic point of view... No-one to tell us no, or where to go, or say we're only dreaming...   - Aladdin, "A Whole New World"  A whole new world, a whole new blog. Possibly a whole new  Me  but that's unlikely - I've tried reinvention a few times, but I never have the spare parts when the  New Personality  breaks down.  I'm still in the publishing  DayJob , which has got busier and better. I still want to lose weight, I still spend all my money on clothes. The French might say " plus ca change ", but what do they know? They are, after all, French.  I went to the  ballet  last night, with  FastestViolinInTheWest Boy , and we had a grand time. Well,  FastestViolin... Boy  was thrilled, I liked the one where the costumes looked like a  Labyrinth  rip-off. I think I may have a  Labyrinth -themed party - it has been a while since I have played the happy hostess. We drank drinks together afterwards and gossiped like fag- and hag-trooper. I do love spending time with him.  Stayed tuned. There may even be regular updates.

      So far today, I have bought a  Wannadies  album, a  No Doubt  album, and a pair of  silver espadrilles . That should keep me going until Monday, I think. And it all came to £13.54, including postage.  Have had a busy but entertaining week.  ActorBoyfriend ’s play on Wednesday was a&nbsp; great night, even I got rather intimidated by all his  ActorFriends  – they may all be blaggers, but they Talk The Talk and Walk The Walk very well.  ActorBoyfriend  told me off for being intimidated, but they are  Cool . I also saw some  UniPeople  that I had not seen in ages, which was nice.   Last night went out for a leaving thing for some people from my old department in the  DayJob . Unfortunately, I missed out on the free all-you-can-drink-plus-full-Thai-meal due to  ChubFighting . It will be so worth it when I am thin, thin, thin.  I am planning an  intensely chilled  weekend. I have loads of little decorating jobs to do to the  LittleHaus , so when  ActorBoyfriend  comes home he will not recognise it. I am planning to sew felt flowers onto my skirt, and to meet  TummyFromHeavenGirl  and her new man for a drink on Saturday. I am getting very into my  HausFrau  lifestyle. I may, if I feel very virtuous, hire the Three Colours...&nbsp;trilogy from&nbsp;Frank's off licence and video store&nbsp;across the road. Frank waves to me when I walk past the window now.  I am also planning to have  Garden Fete Party , with cake stall, barbecue and tombola. Possibly a Bring and Buy stall too. I am not sure when I will have this – it needs to be soon, though, and I will keep you all updated.

      Off to see  ActorBoyfriend 's play tonight, with  HippyGirl .  ShinyWhiteTeethBoy  will be there too, I think, so be nice to have some girlie company whilst he and  ActorBoyfriend  drink themselves into a stupor. Also (fingers crossed)  ActorBoyfriend  are going to have dinner before the play -  little things  but they make me happy.   Had a gorgeous and chilled evening with  HippyGirl  last night, drinking wine and drawing flowers and looking at photos of the  OldCountry , where we are going in just over four weeks.&nbsp; Gagging for it now like a  porn star  gags on&nbsp;a  horse's cock .   SPeaking of horses, posted Horse Bling Present to  EightiesDisasterMovieBoy . Posted it second class, but now wish I had not been a cheapskate as I am excited about his reaction. Presents are so great to give.   Have booked off some time to sleep next week and the week after, am getting too old for all of this.

      It is odd when you hear someone telling an impressionable mind something that you don't agree with... On my bus in this morning, a woman in her twenties has sitting with her pre-school son on the bus. This bright little chappy was asking lots of questions, but something about his voice managed not to carry in the same way as his dear brood-mother's. The entire bus was treated to the fullness of her work-shy wisdom as 8.30am on a Tuesday.   I was lost in a little world of daydreams (something to do with becoming a fabulously influential and respected journalist, I think) when I could her her saying to her  rug-rat  "People go to work to earn money. Then they can use the money to buy things they like."   I pondered her words for a good part of the morning after that. Surely we're not only in it for the money? Otherwise, I would be working for Goldman-Sachs, or something in&nbsp;a  suit in the city . But I quite like my  DayJob , and am planning on taking courses to improve myself at it. And  ActorBoyfriend  has been AWOL for days now on a set design project, which he is doing just for the love of it. In fact, I think it would be very sad to be working only for the money - I mean, I love to shop&nbsp;far more than the&nbsp;metaphotical next person, but even I have some smaller, nobler reasons for doing what I do each day.    Brood-Mother  then went on to say "That's why it's so quiet on the bus. Everyone's going to work." The thought that it might be quiet because nobody knew each other and didn't fancy spending a five-minute bus ride making new intimate acquaintances seemed to have passed this judgemental lady quite by.   On another note, I have lost another three pounds thanks to  ChubFighting . That is six pounds altogether now, in two weeks. Yee, and as they say,&nbsp; ha.

      Back from the  ParentHaus , which is always  a joy , and sitting at my desk musing on why there are so many more Mondays than Fridays in the calendar. I know that this cannot possibly be the case, but it strongly feels as though the Monday:Friday ration is distinctly skewed towards the beginning of the week. I am surprised Stephen Hawkings has not mused on this subject in his seminal  A Brief History of Time , but perhaps he just never thought of it. Indeed, this could be a whole new branch of temporal physics. Maybe I should raid the  DayJob  contacts databases, and communicate with scientific leaders worldwide on the subjects of why there seem to be more Monday than Fridays. I will keep you updated with my research on the subject.   Moving on to things&nbsp;both inherently tied up with time, and time passing, we come to the subjects of  death  and  fashion . In particular, why are certain dead things in fashion at any one time, and others not? Whilst sorting through my Nonna's possessions over the weekend to make sure no thoroughly joyous fashion items were given to a cruel and uncaring charity shop (I hauled two great  vintage shirts  and a slinky  retro dress , as well as two  handbags  and a&nbsp;full carrier&nbsp;bag of  costume jewellery ) I was startled by the number of dead things she wore. We found boxes of highly illegal ivory jewellery, which no-one wanted but we have decided to keep as heirlooms (for future generations not to want?), a pair of creamy and worryingly perky looking minks, and a&nbsp;whole menagerie&nbsp;of fur coats. They were mildly nauseating, but I couldn't help but see an irony as I looked down at my suede boots and over at my  BeardedBrother 's leather jacket. However, as these had been treated so much that they were indistinguishable from living animals, this seemed not to make anyone present squeamish. In a way, once has to admire generations who wore foxes, furs and rabbit's foots - at least they were acknowledging the bloody and barbaric roots of some of our treasured fashion fabrics.    BeardedBrother  also lent me his  Best of Meatloaf  CD, which I am listening to in the  DayJob . 'Cause like a sinner before the gates of heaven I'll come rolling on back to you...

      &nbsp;I have been so busy with my&nbsp; DayJob  busy-ness that I missed buying a pair of white cowboy boots I was watching on  eBay . And I didn't even notice for 48 hours.   The working world has had me shackled to my desk, sleep-deprived and raving, while I covered for people having great holidays and prepared presentations for co-workers who slept through them. I have never cared about a job this much before, I feel responsibility constricting about my throat like a  work-related boa . I am also having the world's fastest energy spikes, and run around manically&nbsp;waving  work-related paper &nbsp;at  work-related people &nbsp;for a minute or two before slumping at my desk and putting  cocktail sticks  under my eyelids to stay awake. A great side effect of all this is a wonderful sense of calm in all other areas of my life - the key to happiness is being knackered, now I see the  Way .   My mother and two of her insane sisters came up for lunch today. The conversation meandered around all the important subjects, such as death, children leaving home, menopause and vibrators. It was an experience.   I am going to  SmallTown Berkshire  tomorrow night for the weekend. If anyone is about let me know - am going out for  GirlieNight  with  GirlieFriends  on Saturday, which should be a laugh riot, so long as they don't make me go to a CheesyClub. Mental note to self; take clothes for a CheesyClub, just in case.

       My goodness, what a thoroughly  marvellous weekend . I haven’t had so much fun since… Well, I haven’t had so much fun in a long time, I can tell you.  &nbsp;  On Friday night, myself and  ActorBoyfriend  and  FastestViolinInTheWestBoy  went to the  IndieGayClub , which was a riot as usual. Free entry and I nicked a free CD inside – bargain. I decided not to drink (to be loyal to the  ChubFighter  ethic) and so was able to dance away all night with far greater energy than normal and not have a headache the next day. I danced, and danced, and danced some more. We also managed to facilitate love, or something very like it, between a friend of  FastestViolinInTheWestBoy  who came with us, and a boy I know from student days. They left together – early. How sweet, and  not at all sexual  in nature. It is nice to be a part of such happy events.  &nbsp;  On Saturday, after dragging myself reluctantly from bed and watching soap omnibuses with  FastestViolinInTheWestBoy  ( ActorBoyfriend  having left at an unfeasibly early hour for work), I trekked up to north London for  PhoneGirl ’s barbecue. It was a great laugh, filled with  computer scientists  and  Eastern Europeans . I got far too tipsy and even dozed off on the way to  LawyerGirl ’s flat in the evening.  &nbsp;  Saturday night was like entering another world – one that has door porters, pools and Jacuzzis, and views of the Thames. Me and  LawyerGirl  took full advantage of the all available facilities in her posh new Docklands apartment building (I can’t call it a flat, it is an apartment in a  gated complex ). She works very hard and deserves it all, and is happy to share with her  drop-out wierdy skint  friends. She is wonderful.  Finally, having stayed up late with drinking wine on Saturday, I&nbsp;met&nbsp; ActorBoyfriend  for lunch on Sunday, then went to the cinema to see  superhero movies . I was so sleepy last night but unbelievably content this morning.&nbsp;  Party animals  have more fun.

      It is going to be a whole weekend of  mini adventures ! I have a little green suitcase full of my worldy goods (vintage dresses, perfume, flyers for  IndieGayClub ) and I am not going home until Sunday. Tonight is Party Night with  FastestViolinInTheWestBoy , to my favouritest club in the world EVER. They play all my favourite tunes and I fall in love with guitar music all over again.  ActorBoyfriend  and I will be chastely sleeping in his bed tonight, then I am going to  PhoneGirl 's BBQ tomorrow afternoon. Then I am going to  LawyerGirl 's excessively nice new Docklands flat for a house warmeing  avec  jacuzzi, then sleeping somewhere then. Finally, I am meeting  TapQueenGirl  for a surprise birthday Sunday lunch for her man... My goodness! What a weekend! &nbsp; I can't drink too much as I want to stay  thin . If I do drink, I'll have to make sure I drink some much I throw it all up again, then the calories don't count. &nbsp; I am so classy it kills me.  &nbsp; See you Monday!

      Ow. I  did something amazing today , and it bloody well hurts. Anyone who tells you that being a blood donor doesn't hurt is  lying . Come and see my swollen, oozing, throbbing and possibly  gangrenous  arm, and you will see the truth.  Ow ow ow . They tried to placate me afterwards with crisps, biscuits and fruit squash, like when I had  tantrums  at playschool, but  ChubFighters  say no to such high-fat high-sugar snacks and I left with my head held high. And my arm cradled low.  eBay is just so great. I have brought two dresses in twenty four hours - and it cost less than a tenner for both, including postage. As Carrie Bradshaw says, "I was looking for a $7 vintage dress to go with my $300 shoes"... I am so happy, especially as today is  DayJob PayDay  - the happiest day of the month. If I weren't so weak and anemic, I'd jump for joy. I am now listening to  Siouxsie & The Banshees  and contemplating eyeliner.

       ChubFighters  are go, hurray!  I have joined an international organisation of  Nazi food-deprivers  (who work on a patented  Points  system of starvation) to shift the hideous bulk that encircles poor poor weak skeleton. It’s going to great, I shall be more  slim-line  than  slim-line tonic . I am, of course, hungry already, but it is a myth to think that you can lose weight without being hungry. If you’re not hungry you’re not burning fat, are you  fat girl ?  I’m feeling great about the diet, and myself. It won’t work because I’m far too luxurious about food, but I love the feeling of virtue and control just by signing up to weighing sessions. Sigh – it’s all going to great when I’m thin…  Public reaction to this has been mixed. Some people have said that  ChubFighters  are a good way to lose weight and keep it off. Others seem to think my membership fee has gone directly to  supporting child slavery ,  terrorist activity  and  dumping of nucleur waste in the Antarctic , judging by the vehemence of opposition to me joining.  The ideal situation would be to be like  EightiesDisasterMovieBoy , who’s tried-and-true method is just to not eat until he is thin. His willpower is so great, I love it.   KungfuFightingBoy  arrived back in these grey, unspiritual islands over the weekend, and stayed at our house practicing  transcendental meditation , watching  Twin Peaks  and playing  PlayStation  with  ActorBoyfriend .  SmallTown  in Surrey became a  nexus point  for social activity, with much communal eating and drinking and wandering around the river banks over the weekend.  HippyGirl  and  TooCleverByHalfBoy ,  CosmoBoy  and  WifeGirl , and  KungfuFightingGirl  all spent much of the weekend at our house. We played with toy guns and put the world to rights several times. It was great.  I almost forgot as well the long, drunken afternoon that was the  DayJob Summer Party  on Friday. Champagne was first sighted (and promptly consumed) at 11am, and it carried on in a similar vein, moving from the office to posh gardens in Chelsea, onto a pub which quickly ran out of toilet paper and had its sinks filled with vomit. Tasty. I got  rat-arsed  as ever, got sleazed at by several men who were probably groaning with embarrassment into their pillows on Saturday, and shouted at people I work with to buy me drinks. I also broke into someone’s house for an explore (well, they left their front door open when I was outside) and managed to gather excrutiatingly graphic gossip on a good proportion of co-workers.  ActorBoyfriend  always say I am never so drunk as when I have been out with work, but I like to think of it as never so drunk as when the  booze is free . Roll on the  Christmas party …

      Well, it was a  crazy long weekend  and let's hope I don't have to do anything like that again any time soon. There was some great parts though, such as being at the  ParentHaus  which is always great fun. There are people to drive me around, and there are also bottles of  fine wine  to drink whenever I fancy. Most visits to the  ParentHaus , I am thus freed of the need to walk and supplied with alcohol, and so time passes in a happy haze.  Carbooting with  EightiesDisasterMovieBoy  was great - I got two jumpers, a belt and two pairs of shoes that are very  LadyChic  (tm). I am going to cultivate a haughty demeanor. I'll probably end up falling over, but it is important to have  goals . I also bought the greatest dress on eBay, but it is being posted from the US and won't be here for  days , by which time I'll probably have lost interest.  After discussion with  ActorBoyfriend , I have decided that I am going to start going to more parties and events that I am invited to. At the moment, I estimate that I attend one in three of the various social events I am invited to. I shall now try instead REFUSING one in three, and attending the rest. I think that a diary will be a  key investment  in these new social season.  However, before that social whirl starts I will be spending tonight at my little white cottage, sorting out  ends and odds . I have a to-do list for my evening, which will give me the structure I need for a night in. I think it will be most productive.

      Last night I lay awake in bed at 1.30am, listening to teenage revellers outside. They were having a party down the street, and some of the stragglers who wanted a bit more  privacy  or fresh air had decided that the mini roundabout outside my house was the perfect spot to  screech  and  holler  at one another. Hoorah! When they were silent for a moment, the sound of bumpin' and grindin'  R&B  (music of the  Devil ) filtered down the road from ten houses down. I tried lulling myself with sweet fantasies of climbing onto the roof and sniping them with an  air rifle , inserting small metal pellets into their tracksuit-clad  bottoms , but even this daydream was spoiled by the fact that this would probably only cause them to screech more. Then  ActorBoyfriend , who was sleeping blissfully through all of this, started snoring. Life can be so cruel and ironic.  On arriving at the office this morning and checking my eBay account, I was pleased to see that I had not won white cowboy boots with metal tips. As my previous entry testified, I did log in and cancel this bid. Then, at the last minute when  FastestViolinInTheWestBoy  was waiting for me outside the office, I logged back in and placed another bid. The guilt wracked me all evening, and I was delighted and relieved to see that the matter had been taken out of my hands by someone bidding far more than I would ever waste on eBay. Thank God for being a  tightwad .  I have a bag with me to head back to the parental  SmallTown  tonight. It contains two pairs of boots and four vintage dresses, and little else. I feel  rock 'n' roll .

      My new favourite thing of the day is...  http://www.weebls-stuff.com/toons/29/  -  Got lions and tigers, only in Kenya... Forget Norway!   It's so great! I've been looping a one minute song for half an hour on my computer at work... It makes me happy.  It's just one part of my very  brain-dead  week, with as few intellectual pursuits as possible.  Sleep ,  wine  and  PlayStation 2  have all featured heavily, as have gossipping on  messenger  and lusting over  eBay crap .  Will whip myself back into shape by mid-next week.  KungFuFightingBoy  is back from a land far, far away where he has been for a whole year! He has been very sorely missed. He and his sweet ladyfriend are currently spending  quality time  together, possibly in bed, but I couldn't possibly comment. I have missed him (though in a different way to his ladyfriend) and want to make sure that I am able to make the most of him next week.  Poor  HippyGirl  is poorly, so no  children's theatre  for me this week. Get well soon,  HippyGirl .

      Took  HippyGirl  out for a Chinese last night, and talked the night away. Long chats with  HippyGirl  are all right by me. We made lots of plans for the holiday, including at least one shopping trip to pick up  bargain Italian clothing loveliness .  I think I may have an  obsessive personality , or at least a terrifyingly neat one. I have spent much of the afternoon working on a spreadsheet of what clothes I am taking on holiday, and as I am only taking a small bag I need to plan carefully. I have coloured in various parts of the spreadsheet to see how much of each colour I am taking, and to check that everything in my capsule wardrobe will co-ordinate. This cannot be  normal behaviour .  Got home in time for  The Sopranos  but too late to do any creative work last night. Still, at least I have a good excuse ( cheap booze  at Weatherspoons - I didn't say it was a classy excuse).  Lost another pound  ChubFighting  today. I am loving my new  slimline  look and the fact that I can get back into size 12 clothes without  bulging , but I am desperately looking forward to getting absolutely hammered when it is all over. Restraint can yield wonderful results but it's pretty fucking dull.

      I seemed to have arranged lots of social engagements involving  food  this week. How peculiar, and tricksy.   I cooked Sunday lunch for the  ParentUnits  and my  Nonno  yesterday, and added plenty of  cider  to make sure everyone enjoyed themselves thoroughly   HippyGirl  and I are going for dinner tonight. There has been some sadness in life of late, which can clealy be assisted by prawn chow mein   BeardedBrother  will be even older on Wednesday, and so I am going to  Basingraad  for his birthday meal  And finally,  GermanPhilosophyBoy  will be cooking for  ActorBoyfriend  and I on Thursday night. Personally, I am holding out for strudel   Only two weeks until my holiday, and I have bought bikini, travel hairdryer, and books to read. I have also begun work on my novel "Where The Happiness Lives!" which will be Louis de Berniere meets Alice Sebold. Exciting, don't you think?  My weekend involved shopping, drinking, socialising and  The Sopranos . Highly agreeable.

      To motivate myself, as my creative energies seem to be an  all-time low ebb , I have decided to list a few of the little plans / schemes / projects that I am planning to embark once I've had a bit more  sleep .  1. Distance learning  feature writing course  (add a bit of structure to my incoherent ramblings) 2. Website called " Elegant Living for Modern Times ", just because I like the title 3. A new play called " The Greatest Mix Tape I Ever Made ", set in the summmer of 1997 and based not-so-loosely around my  drunken and disreputable  indie youth  Well, that's not a bad start.  Two weeks until Italy, and some more ChubFighting to be done. I am going to buy a  bikini  tomorrow, which will be fairly terrifying for all concerned. Wish me luck, compadres.

      Today, my ambition is to start leading a double life as a masked militant defender of the London streets in the starlit hours. Why this urge to fight crime nightly? It would give me a good excuse for the constant yawning in daylight hours. I am convinced that  DayJob  co-workers think I am a lady of the night anyway, with my  bloodshot eyes  and  bumping  into things.  Had an amazing evening last night, with  KungFuBoy  and  HippyGirl  and  TooCleverByHalfBoy  and  AstroBoy  and  GlamourPussGirl  and  ActorBoyfriend . We had a gorgeous  tapas-y  meal accessorised with masses of  booze , and spent hours just drinking and eating chatting.  KungFuBoy  is going back to  MadeInTaiwanLand  tomorrow - we will miss him sorely for another year. I hope his sword gets through customs.  Stumbled home at about 1.30am, which is just for  too late  for me on a school night. Especially as I had to get in early today to leave in time for my haircut tonight. I have been looking for pictures of  retro  Sixties and Seventies hairstyles on the Internet, but I think I will just have to describe what I want when I go in. This may or may not be successful. I am still strongly tempted to crop it and bleach it  platinum ; however, I’m not sure this look would suit me as well as I like to imagine it would. I think cutesy Gwen Stefani when I imaging it, but I would probably look more  Highly Doubtful  than  No Doubt .  I want a  turkey ham sandwich  now, please.

      Everybody  chub !  chub ! Everybody  chub !  chub ! (sung to the tune of  that song  that you always hear in clubs going  jump !  jump ! but I have no idea who it’s by…)  Yes, the  ChubFighting  still continues as an unparalleled success, as I have now lost a total of  nine pounds in four weeks . I am a  happier  person because I am  thinner . I am terrible, and shallow, and fickle and image obsessed. But thin (ner).  Have been out of the  DayJob  since Friday lunchtime as I decided to use up some holiday time footling and tootling about my house. I scrubbed and shined all yesterday, and then did some gentle needlepoint to relax. I cooked a roast chicken for  ActorBoyfriend , and wished I had a little pinny to wear. I wonder if I would look good with pin curls? My little  mariachi  band figures that I drunkenly bought on eBay also arrived, and they are arranged in a procession across the top of the cooker hood.  Saw  ChicaGirl  and  EightiesDisasterMovieBoy  on Friday night, along with a whole other bunch of actors (they surround me, they haunt me, they stalk me). They both looked fabulous, and quite put me to shame. I generally feel quite proud of my fashion sense until my  KillerFashionFriends ™ turn up and put me to shame. Then spent the weekend up in a free festival of samba and nice stuff in Regent’s Park in the  BigCity . Bliss. I even drank some  beer  and became the life and soul of the party. It is amazing how much you can enjoy something just by depriving yourself of it for a few weeks.  I am currently totally flat stony broke, so I think this week may be rather quiet. Still, I think we are having a leaving dinner for  KugFuBoy  and  KungFuGirl  tomorrow. That’s all my plans at the moment, but I’m sure I’ll think of something else if I get bored.

      I have been  promoted : whereas before I was just plain old DayJobee, I am now a  Senior DayJobee . Hooray! Promotion basically means no more extra work, but the word Senior in my e-mail signature... and a little  teensy bit more money . Hey, I ain't turning up my nose at no pay rise.  Have this afternoon and Monday off, going to look at badges and meet  EightiesDisasterMovieBoy  later today. Enjoy the sun my dearest readers, each and every one of you is treasure in the Aladdin's cave of my heart.

      Last night I was a vile monster pickled in  cheap white wine . I was horrible, which goes to show that two bowls of bran flakes and a chicken wrap is not enough to sustain you for a whole day if you then go out and drink a bottle of  pinot grigio  to yourself. Oh, I was rancid. Poor  TapQueenGirl  and  HippyGirl  must have been disgusted at my appalling behaviour when we were supposed to be having a charming drink in a charming garden suburb of London. And poor  ActorBoyfriend  got  bullied  and  browbeaten  all the way, and it is a testament to his strength of character that he has not now declared himself  ActorExBoyfriend .  No more drugs for that girl.

      I am currently having  knickers  issues. When buying all of my current pairs of panties, I had the gentle curving swell to go above them known as a  LadyBelly . The top of my  knickers  would gently hug the bottom of the  LadyBelly , and all would be well.  However, due to ChubFighting and the subsequent lack of  Belly -forming  beer , my belly has shrivelled down to a sad, hollow, flattened imitation of its former self. It would be laughable to call it a flat  Belly , but it does not form a gentle cushion for resting beer or  ActorBoyfriend  on. And, to my distress and embarrassment, my  knickers  now ride up whereas they were stopped by  LadyBelly . All my sweet little smalls from M&amp;S now come up to waist. I am in fashion crisis. Damn you,  ChubFighters , damn you!

      Feeling   molto  relaxed  today, after a lazy sunny smiley weekend. Went for some drinks with work on Friday then made it home to see the rather excellent remake of  Psycho . I am normally morally outraged by the cultural nullity of the remake, but Anne Heche looked so great in the film, and as it was a shot-for-shot remake it couldn't fail to be a great film.  Woke late on Saturday, painted my nails Uma Thurman red in the garden, before tottering off in sandals and a teeny-tiny vintage dress into the  BigCity  to meet  TummyFromHeavenGirl  and her lovely new boyfriend  OfCourseHeIsStrawberryBlondBoy . Young love is great. Drank on the South Bank with them, wandered up to Covent Garden for more drinks with  KungFuBoy ,  HippyGirl  and  TooCleverByHalfBoy . I bade them farewell at closing time as they went in search of Chinese food, and nearly froze in my teeny-tiny vintage dress on the way home.   ActorBoyfriend  was around briefly yesterday afternoon, which was bliss. I cooked him food and cooled his fever'd brow for a while, then went for a  Sunday Promenade  and picked up the first of the Three Colours trilogy from the video store.  ActorBoyfriend  rolled in around two this morning, and then, as the song say, it was  time to do it all over again ...
