      Fuck everyone yo. I'm in such a bad mood. Have you ever questioned whether or not your closest friends are really your friends at all? Or will they be quick to turn on you, or choose someone else over you. Welp. Shit happened to me twice today already. im gettin mad aggrivated. i swear yo, i will rip someones head off pretti soon  man all i kno is that shit will not be tha same after today cuz im fed tha fuck up yo. people be comin to u and sayin that u is their best friend, their sister, their everything. no one tops u. then go off tellin' someone else that they dont give a fuck about anyone else, they is their everything. that everyone else is nobody. fuckin 2 faced people on tha real yo. people who i thought were fuckin' real are like this. so whateva it aint like im gna stop chillen wit them, jus let em kno not to push me, cuz once u test my nerves, you will fuckin get clapped the fuck up!  this chick be puttin her man over me! wtf is that yo? i dont like that shit, like i'v been there when u were fuckin pist off at him, when u didnt want anything to do with him, thru everything. and now u put him tha fuck ova me? fuck that shit yo, i aint workin' like that. fuckin listenin' to everything he says. she be actin' like a dawg and shit. she mad tough, she neva listen to no man and no man will eva fuck wit her like that. she be doin her. haa people got jokes these days cuz on some real shit - her mouth is bigger than what she really is. she says this and that but when it comes to really doin it, shes all fuckin soft and shit cuz she dont wanna lose that nigga. I'ma lose my mind. I'uno bout anyone else, but I'll be damned if I let a nigga run my life. Fuck that shit. I'ma do ReeRee; ain't no one finna run me. I don't take orders. This shit is sad.   So whateva she jus called me up from her new best friends house when she was supposed to call me when she was done cleanin or what not. people cant fuckin stick with their word anymore. let me find someone real, someone who actually sticks to their word, someone that dont give a fuck what people say. i cant fuckin stand girls anymore. i love mah niggaz man for real. these bitches be givin' me too much drama. on some real shit mah nigga josh is what i call tha realest. he dont give a fuck bout nobody, he be doin him. Nobody can tell that grown-ass man wat to do, if he wants to do somethin' - he'll do it .. if not - he aint doin shit! thats tha kind of shit i like. like fuck u think u r? i dont give a fuck about people man, im fuckin selfish - i only do shit if its for my own benefit. fuck tha rest cuz u be doin so much for people and get nuttin back so im GOOD!   im fuckin wylin' out mah niggaz. yo i cant wait till tonite so i could fuckin show people wut im about. how they cant do shit to get me ta change mah ways. fuck that shit. people be thinkin' wut they do affects me. nahh only one it'll affect is you. bitches get all butthurt when i tell them i dont give a fuck about them. Ladies write this down please; "REEREE DON'T LIKE ME" Just like that, read it to yourself over and over. Memorize it. Remember that for life. You disrespect me, and we will never be coo.

      Music- Ciara ft. Petey Pablo "My Goodies"  Sheeit. I be drivin' myself crazy thinkin' bout *HIM* but im so much betta now, except that i be wonderin' if this shit is real. Im not even gonna stress pety shit thats goin' on in mah life right now. So Mothafuckin' focused right now. Just tryna spend some time with tha fam, get a job, go out - dont give a fuck bout nuttin' else. On dawgs, these past couple days have been mad weird, its like everything i let go of, be comin' back to me. Its like that Quote - "if your lofe somethin' - let it go, if it comes back to your, its yours. well he's mine then.   smh, tell me why this nigga, Natas, needs to be tellin' me that he wants shit back and he like me and its seems like i like him, so we could have somethin' goin? It was like 9 when he called, i havent talked to him in tha ill minute (prolly round 3 months) we ended up talkin for 6 hours straight. I told him he could call me again - im supposed to talk to him tonite and we supposed to cheel tomm - but i highly doubt it. I'll see how shit goes. If things go good - that'll be nice. If it don't - I dont give a FUCK! Niggas like him aint shit- Pussy feein' motha fuckas.   Bitches these days be lettin' their lives be takin' ova by men. Fuck all that shit, and fuck what they got to say about it. Blinded by "love" whatever the fuck that word means. I know damn well it don't mean he say jump, she say how high, or vice versa. So fuck em all. I'd be damned if i let a man take ova my life!
