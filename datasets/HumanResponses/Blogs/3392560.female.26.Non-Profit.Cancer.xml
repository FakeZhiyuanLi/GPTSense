      Niether of the two can ride a bike. Could it be ADD?   Kerry pokes fun at Bush mishap,   From combined dispatches      Democrat John Kerry joked about President Bush's weekend bicycle accident by comparing the president to a child, Internet newshound Matt Drudge reported yesterday.       "Kerry told reporters in front of cameras, 'Did the training wheels fall off?' " Mr. Drudge reported on his Web site, www.drudgereport.com.      Interviewed by The Washington Times yesterday, Kerry spokeswoman Stephanie Cutter would say only that the words Mr. Drudge reported were "off the record."      Mr. Drudge said the debate among reporters over the on-camera "training wheels" remark has been "whether to treat it as on or off the record."      In comments reported by the Associated Press, Mr. Kerry said, "I hope he's OK. I didn't know the president rode a bike."      Mr. Bush, who is widely ridiculed by liberals and Democrats as dumb and incompetent, suffered "minor abrasions and scratches" in the accident, which came near the end of a 17-mile mountain bike ride on his Texas ranch Saturday.      Mr. Kerry had his own bicycling mishap earlier this month, taking a spill while riding with Secret Service agents through Concord, Mass. Mr. Kerry fell when his bike hit a patch of sand. He was not injured.    urlLink http://washingtontimes.com/national/20040523-112924-2653r.htm

      Berg execution was a FAKE - for the love of god read this   First of all, I know this is largely Pit material, but I feel that news of this caliber deserves the increased exposure of the main forum. Please keep replies intelligent, honest, topical, and free of slander against me. Debate the topic, not the person who brought it up.  Sources for all my facts can be found at the bottom, they are labeled according to subject.  That having been said...  Many of you might remember that I started a thread on the day the video was released noting how "convenient" it was that the tape had come out, just as the Iraqi prisoner abuse scandal was in full swing. Not only did this take the abuse scandal off of headlines, but it swayed public opinion back against "those fucking Iraqis".  Evidence  1) Most people replied by asserting that the execution occured as retribution to the abuse photos that had surfaced, but you have to ask yourself - do these terrorists, who are clearly capable of brainwashing people to the point where they are willing to kill and be killed for their beliefs, really have no concept of political tact? Here they are, the whole world screaming at the US for hypocrisy and injustice over these pictures, and they perform and publish this execution right in the heat of the scandal. In other words, these masters of brainwashing and spin and deception release a video of a despicable act just as the US, their sworn enemy, is being globally grilled. Does this make sense to you?  2) Second, I wonder what the standard issue chair is at Abu Ghraib prison?         *cough*  3) Is it not interesting that the wall colour at Abu Ghraib prison is identical to that of the video?  4) Is it not also interesting that Berg is wearing the same orange jumpsuit worn by prisoners at Abu Ghraib prison? Sure, you say, perhaps he was kidnapped directly from the prison (as stupid as this sounds, anyway) - but then can you please explain (7)?  5) Is it also not interesting that the timecodes in the video jump back and forth?  6) Is it also not interesting that Berg did not exhibit any of the convulsions that typically accompany decapitation?  urlLink http://www.ahsc.arizona.edu/uac/iacuc/rodents/avma.htm  I am suggesting here that Berg was already dead when the decapitation occured (which accounts for 5). Before you go calling me crazy, please review the evidence; why did he not exhibit the convulsions that go hand in hand with decapitation (especially such an extended one)?  7) Is it not curious that the US denies contact with Berg, and yet his friends and family insist that he told them he was being held by the US? Huh? Why?  8) Another tape oddity - the men SPEAK RUSSIAN for several seconds. Not only that, but they speak Arabic with Russian accents. That's right, in the final seconds of the tape, one of the men speaks in Russian. Those here who understand russian (and have the stomach to view that final seconds of the video) can verify this. Those who speak Arabic will be able to verify that these men speak Arabic in Russian accents.  9) Finally (the physical evidence that will convince you in case you already aren't)... You will notice, in watching the video, that 6 times, a gold ring flashes on the hand of the executioner. What is the problem? Islam completely and utterly forbids men to wear gold rings. This fanatical muslim, willing to kill in a gutwrenching manner, and be killed for his beliefs, is violating one of the clear prohibitions of his religion? Really? DOES THIS MAKE SENSE TO YOU?  edit: Two more points:  10) Nick Berg understands Arabic, but sits calmy while statement is read, waiting to be killed. Hmm?  11) One of the executioners is wearing Air Jordans. WHAT?  edit 2:  12) The "terrorists" signed the video, yet they wear hoods and masks. Why?  13) The "terrorists" have lily white hands.  14) The video time is in US Military English. What the hell?  Conclusion As many has suspected, but have not had the time to build a solid case for, the execution of Nick Berg was performed by coalition interests (most likely independent Russian mercenaries) in order to dwarf the abuse pictures and sway public opinion back against the Iraqis and in support of the war by taking advantage of the emotional reaction we all experience when hearing of such an despicable act. The poor production quality (all the "curiosities" I have pointed out) of this video can be attributed to the haste in which it was made after the order was given to distract the public from the abuse scandal, and is in line with my conclusion.  Again, before you attack my conclusion, attack my evidence. No matter how crazy you think this sounds, examine the evidence objectively and please try to deny a single thing I have said. If you cannot deny my evidence, you logically cannot deny my conclusion. Make your replies free of subjective opinions and ad hominem attacks or I will not reply to them.

      Sivits, the 1st one to go on trial for the abuse in the Abu Ghraib prison gets one year confinement, he is discharged from the military and demoted to private. Yes, one year of confinement into a military brigg! (And he's getting an appeal.) I guess the real punishment for Sivits is going to be him coming back into the states as a free man trying to find a civilian employer.   urlLink CNN.com - Soldier�sentenced to�1 year�in Iraq prisoner abuse - May 19, 2004

      A Schindler's List box set     It comes with a book of images from the film, a foreword from Steven Spielberg and some production notes. Also a relaxing soundtrack.         It also has a limited edition senitype. It's one frame from the movie which is art graphics, produced from a single frame of motion picture film. The film footage is an actual 35 millimeter film frame produced from the original motion picture by master optical film technicians. Every senitype has been individually numbered for this edition box set.          From Steven Speilbergs' Foreword, he writes :   As Itzhak Stern says at that critical moment in the film, "The list is an absolute good. The list of life." When the workers gave Schindler a ring, it was inscribed with words from Talmud, "He who saves one life saves the world entire."    One man made a difference. So a conversation that began in a luggage shop has taken me on a journey I could not have expected.

      The US convoy had been attacked during the past week by people in civilian clothes who set out road side bombs and slipped away. On this day the scouts were set out front, entering a region where no US soldier has gone. As they went on they saw in a distance what appeared to be a man running away. They pursued on foot through a mine field, firing warning shots. The figure in the distance doesn't stop running therefore requiring the US troop to fire again but with a aimed shot instead. After the said man was hit, the scouts catch up only to find a combat soldiers worse nightmare. The target turns out to be a 10 year old boy. He'd been helping his father tend to their cattle. Inside the suspious bag he was carrying was nothing but a bottle of water and a stick. One of the soldiers kneeled down asking, "you alright buddy?" The father pleaded with the soldiers to let him take his boy home to die but he was denied. He is later taken away by helicopter to an American field hospital. After all that the US troops are stunned one saying, "it was like getting kicked in the gut."  The father gets to finally see his son 2 weeks later in the Afghan catpiol, Kabul. It was his first time there. It had taken intervention by the providential governor and the help of some Americans to get him there. The father said "because of this, my son is injured, my cattle went missing and my wife has gone crazy."  CNN asked the army if there would be any compensation for the boy and his family and the answer was "no...we do not take compensation for injuries in combat operations, ever."  The boy will be returned home in a month.   urlLink Actual footage here  (This video can only be seen if you have the  urlLink premium service news pass  with  urlLink cnn.com )

      A television show called 60 Minutes did a special about the Skull and Bones Society, a secret society at Yale University. John Kerry, George H.Bush, and George W. Bush are all members of this society along with quite a few more members that are inside the United States government. I will also add that George W. Bush has taken upon himself to tap five members of the secret society into his administration.

       LINCOLN, Nebraska (AP) -- The American Civil Liberties Union filed a lawsuit against the city of Omaha on behalf of a Muslim woman who says she was barred from accompanying her children to a city swimming pool because she was fully clothed.   The lawsuit filed in Lincoln federal court Wednesday says Lubna Hussein took her three children to the pool in June and August 2003 but was turned away at the gate after she told employees she could not wear a bathing suit.  Hussein is required by her religious beliefs to keep her body covered in public except for her face and hands.  She was told she could not be in the pool area in her street clothing, even though she saw other people in the area who were not wearing bathing suits, according to the lawsuit.  On one occasion, the lawsuit says, city workers told Hussein that her children could enter but that she would have to remain outside and observe them through a fence... WTF?!   "The city cannot operate its pools in a way that discriminates," said Amy Miller, legal director for ACLU Nebraska.  Omaha City Attorney Paul Kratz said he had not seen the lawsuit and declined to immediately comment on its specifics. But he said the city has a policy of not allowing people in street clothes inside pool areas.  The lawsuit says the city violated Hussein's equal protection rights and other constitutional guarantees. It asks for a court order declaring the pool policy unconstitutional, as well as unspecified damages for humiliation, embarrassment and suffering.

          "Some people have been waiting all their lives for this. Nobody alive has seen it," said astronomer Peter Boyce, who plans to watch the "transit of Venus" from Massachusetts' Nantucket Island.  People across much of the Earth will be able to see it, but it won't be visible in the western United States. In the Midwest and East, viewers can watch its final stages for a couple hours starting at sunrise, if skies aren't clouded over.  Transits of Venus occur twice -- eight years apart -- about every century, when the sun, Venus and Earth precisely line up. Past transits -- the last pair were in 1874 and 1882 -- helped astronomers calculate Earth's distance from the sun. This time, Tuesday's transit and one in 2012 carry little scientific significance, but they've still stirred up interest.   urlLink http://www.cnn.com/2004/TECH/space/06/07/transitof.venus.ap/index.html

      BOSTON- 5/26/04- A group of people got together to do an action at the Tremont St Armed Forces Career Center (AFCC) in Boston. JP and CW met NF and JM at the location. (11:00 am) JP donned a black hood, a loosing fitting black shawl, sandals and two black cords hanging from his hands. He was standing on top of a plastic milk crate. (11:25 am)      This was a visual approximation of the infamous torture photos from Iraq's Abu Ghraib prison.       After standing in front of the Armed Forces Career Center for about 10 minutes someone came out to talk to us about the action. (11:35 am) The man that spoke with us was quite angry. He made several statements such as: (11:40 am)  "Hey, you need to go away." , "You should go." , and "This is federal property… You are damn right… in front of the building."       "This is a public building, it is federal property." The protestor responded.       "I will call the police, don’t worry about it." During this exchange the man grabbed JP by his shoulder in an attempt to remove him. This incident was clearly videotaped. The man seemed to discontinue his actions when he became aware that he was being videotaped. Just as the man went back into the AFCC, SP arrived. (12:00 noon) At one point someone who seemed to be in the employ of the AFCC came out with a Poloroid instant Camera and took a picture of the action from the door. (just after noon)       Several law enforcement officials (Park Rangers, State Police, and MBTA Police) passed by the event. None of these people took any note of the event as being offensive or terribly disturbing. None of the law enforcement officials talked to or questioned any of the individuals involved in the action.       Also during this time an individual inside the AFCC pointed to JM, who was taking photographs and made a fist and clearly mouthed the words "I am going to fuck you up". While doing this he pointed at his fist and pointed at JM.       A Boston Police cruiser arrived in front of the Military Career Center. Some short time later another cruiser arrived and then a third. For at least twenty minutes, perhaps more, the officers who arrived in the cruisers said nothing. They did not question or ask individuals to move along. They seemed to assume a posture of 'wait and see'. (12:30 pm) That was all dispelled when a ranking Boston police officer (lieutenant?) arrived. He entered the AFCC with at least two, possibly more, Boston Police officers. After a brief time inside (10 mins?) they exited the building and along with other Boston Police officers started to clear the sidewalk of onlookers who had gathered to watch the action and response. They started taping off the area with yellow "police line" tape. When this started CW approached JP (who could not see due to the black hood over his head). CW asked JP if he wanted to leave the area, CW further suggested that it might be a good idea at the time considering the attitude of the police. JP stepped down from the milk crate and removed the shawl and the hood. As he started to walk away, two Boston Police hurried over to prevent JP from leaving and separated him from his fellow activists. (12:40 pm)        JP was not handcuffed. He was questioned at length. Sometime during this a Black Boston Police van arrived. Someone of the onlookers mentioned that this was the "Bomb Squab". No one from the "Bomb Squad" immediately inspected JP. At one point one of the black clad "Bomb Squad" officers casually looked at the shawl JP had been wearing and then picked up one of the cords and turned it in his hands for 2 or 3 seconds before tossing it to the ground.       Soon afterwards, JP was handcuffed and arrested. He was placed into an Area A-1 Boston Police Cruiser. Boston Police repeatedly refused to respond to NF and JP when they asked what JP was being arrested for. And one must mention that it seemed at the time the Boston Police didn’t know why they were arresting JP themselves. The police cruiser drove off with JP in it, presumably to Area A-1 holding. (12:55 pm) Boston Police approached the remaining activists, SP, CW, NF and JM. All of these people were made to give ID to the police. (1:00 pm) CW remarked,       "I am aware that I do not have to give you my ID, but I am going to anyway. I am sure you are aware of this as well."        To which the officer replied, "I am aware of that." Then one-by-one all of the activists were questioned by a rather large and tattooed Boston Police officer. CW was asked "How tall are you?", "What do you weigh?", "What do you do for a living?", and "Where do you go to school?" The last question CW refused to answer by stating, "I do not have to answer your questions, I want a lawyer present." With this statement the tattooed officer became visibly upset and began to raise his voice.       When SP was questioned, the police officer asked for her social security number. She asked, "Why do you need that information?" The officer did not answer the question but repeated the question. SP gave him her SS number. He asked her "What is your work?" She replied: "I am a volunteer. I don't get paid for my work." He said: "What do you do?" "I work at a soup kitchen," she replied. He asked: "So how do you make your money?" SP replied: "I don't see how any of this is relevant." He repeated the question. SP answered that she had money saved from college jobs. When the officer finished questioning her, she started walking away and one of the remaining officers also questioned her. "So how do you know these guys? What group are you with?" SP replied: "We are friends." "Yea but how did you meet each other?" SP replied: "I met JP at school." "What about the rest?" "We are just friends," she replied.        After questioning them, SP, CW, NF and JM were allowed to leave. The 4 activists left the scene and went to the office of the National Lawyers Guild. After several calls CW found out that JP was being held at Area A-1. While on the phone an officer at Area A-1 said that JP was going to be taken to Boston Municipal Court to be arraigned. Several activists went to the court to see the arraignment. With the help of a friendly public defender they found out that JP was not at the courthouse but at Area A-1. (between 1 and 3:30 pm)       CW, NF, SP and NP then went to Area A-1 to see if JP wanted to be bailed out. Upon arrival CW asked the Desk Officer if JP was in holding and if the desk officer could ask JP if he wanted bail. (4:00 pm) While the desk officer was checking with JP about the bail, a Boston Police officer asked CW       "Was he [referring to JP] the one over there at the military center?"        "Yes." CW replied        "Well you know those Marines and the Navy there shudda' came outta' the office and beat the shit out of him."        "Umm, wouldn’t that be like assault?" CW asked.       "I don’t give a shit. Look I just got back from the Air Force Reserves and … look … grrrr … assholes!"        "I think he (JP) just got back from the Middle East."       The Officer then said: "Yea, I don’t care ….ggggggrrr… scum!" (around 4 pm)       The desk officer returned and told the activists that JP didn’t want to be bailed out. It is assumed that JP was making a statement of solidarity with poor and oppressed people.        JP, full name Joe Privetera, has since been charged with a felony for exercising his freedom of speech.

      Wednesday, June 2, 2004 Posted: 9:05 AM EDT (1305 GMT)   The universe's first million years sound like a low-flying jet overhead     Listen to the primal scream here:  urlLink http://www.space.com/media/mp3/universe.m3u    An astronomer has turned observations of the early universe into a sound clip that represents a primal scream from the first million years after the Big Bang.  Mark Whittle, an astronomer at the University of Virginia, based the work on a "wonderful gift from Nature," the cosmic microwave background, CMB, that was unleashed when the universe was about 380,000 years old. At that point in time, a dense fog began to clear and radiation was first allowed to escape its natal cocoon.  Other studies have generated sound clips out of data from the universe and even from our own solar system. But none have reached so far back in time and space.  Whittle first figured out the sound at the time of the cosmic microwave radiation itself. Then he and colleagues made some assumptions about the dense state of things before the CMB and modeled the sound that likely occurred in the interval between the Big Bang and the release of the CMB.  Sound would have traveled easily through the early cosmos, he explained, because the more compact universe was denser, like a hot, thin atmosphere.  "If we want to access times before and after the microwave background, we have to make use of computer simulations," Whittle said here today at a meeting of the American Astronomical Society.  The simulations generated a growing hiss that resembles a roaring jet plane flying low overhead. It represents the first million years of the cosmos and it is compressed into about 5 seconds for easy listening.  "I was relieved," Whittle said. "I didn't want the universe to be some wimpy, quiet thing. But I didn't want it to be inhumanly, fatally loud. And it isn't. It's just loud...and that's great, just great."  Whittle said that most people think the theoretical Big Bang starts out with a huge explosion, then it gets quieter with time.  "In fact, the Big Bang starts out completely silent," Whittle said. "The expansion...is purely radial -- there's no sideways motion. There are no pressure waves. What they are, are density variations on all scales, everywhere."  The universe expanded rapidly after the Big Bang, during a period called inflation. Later, it continued to expand at a slower rate as it cooled enough for gas to condense and form stars. All this time, density variations contributed characteristics to the sound that Whittle's team has determined.  "It's nice to kind of get a clean handle on it," Whittle said. "It's as if the universe is a bad concert hall. It has drapes and carpets which absorb the high frequencies. It deadens the sound. What you'd like to do is to put your instruments right in the middle of the orchestra instead of the back of the hall. And to do that you need to use computer simulations, which are quite accurate to access the pure sound."  The chord is somewhere between a major and a minor third, Whittle said, adding that he's drawn to associating human emotions with music. "Majors are buoyant and happy chords. Minors are subdued and sad," he said.  "So at the time of the microwave background, the universe in a sense is between two states," Whittle said. "It opens its symphony on a major chord and subtly transforms into a minor chord.  Whittle said that he's got other ideas for playing out the cosmic concerto. "This is getting more into tinkering. I'd like to fix the fundamental in pitch and then watch how the higher harmonics change."  Another idea, Whittle said, is to generate images of primordial sound waves, thereby weaving in other fields to help play out the birth of the universe.  "Just as the government likes...we're doing sound science," said Steve Maran, press officer for the American Astronomical Society.  Maran said that Whittle's work leads to a central observation: "The Big Bang was really the 'Great Silence.' We went from the Great Silence to louder and louder sounds and ended up with the stars we see today," Maran said.

And I will appoint an Attorney General who actually upholds the Constitution of the United States."

      CNN's "Crossfire" co-host Tucker Carlson writes in  urlLink CNN's new blog  about what he's learned about Democrats while at the 2004 Democratic National Convention.   "You hear a lot from self-appointed smart people about how the conventions aren't worth covering anymore -- how they're shallow, news-free informercials for the political parties that sponsor them. This is only half true.  Yes, conventions are stage-managed. But they're also interesting as hell. You can learn a lot about a party from wandering among its faithful, as I did this afternoon for a few hours at the FleetCenter in Boston. Here's what I learned:  Democrats don't like Bush. That's the one sentiment all Democrats -- liberals, Blue Dogs, ethnic party bosses, vegan skateboarders from the anarchist fringe -- agree on. Bush is bad. If you were to write a three-word catechism for the Democratic Party this year, that would be it. To committed Democrats, nothing else matters. Literally.  Take Iraq. According to a survey in today's Boston Globe, fully 95 percent of delegates to the convention oppose the war in Iraq. Yet this is not John Kerry's position. Kerry voted for the war, of course. But he also supports the Bush administration's position that American forces -- possibly even additional American forces -- need to remain in Iraq indefinitely.  In other words, Kerry and his supporters disagree dramatically on the single most important issue in the campaign. You'd expect to hear more about this at a political convention. Not one person I talked to mentioned it. When I brought it up, Democrats, to a person, dismissed it as unimportant.  One of two things is going on here. Either Democrats don't take their own beliefs very seriously. Or they despise George W. Bush so much, they're willing to overlook the fact that John Kerry doesn't represent some of their core beliefs. I think the latter is probably true.  The second thing I learned today is that Democrats have terrible taste in hats. This didn't surprise me. Almost no one looks good in a hat. "    Here's the thing you dim-wit. He only supports the war now because he knows you can't just pull out troops from all the genocide we added to overthere. I sure hope CNN can afford to keep  urlLink shoes on your feet  because it sure seems you've been eating quite a few of them.    Viewers who want to reach Carlson can, in fact dial the television "personality" at CNN's Washington bureau at  urlLink 202-898-7900 .

       Joan Baez : "In the end, if we manage to get out of this without either World War III happening or whatever other scenarios this administration has for us, it'll be because people kept doing things like making statements, signing petitions. It'll be because the Michael Moore's out there didn't quit." (San Diego Union-Tribune, 6/17) 	  Drew Barrymore : "I never come to premieres, but I'm so here on this one. I'm looking forward to this more than anything in the world." (USA Today 6/10)    Tony Bennett : "For a documentary to win over every other film in the Cannes Film Festival is unheard of, so he's quite a genius." (KXAN-TV, 6/15) 	  Mary J. Blige : "I have to vote this year. After seeing that movie, I can't do anything else." (NY Times, 7/6)   Big Boi of "Outkast" : "... urged people "to take time to catch Michael Moore's Fahrenheit 9/11." (Africana.com, 7/15) 	  Princess Caroline of Monaco to Michael Moore : "My mother would have been so proud of your movie." (Detroit Free Press, 5/21)   Bill Clinton : "I think every American ought to see it." (Rolling Stone, 7/13) "As far as I know, none of the facts in the movie have been refuted. That is, I think the evidence in the movie is accurate." (Nova TV (Dutch), 7/14) 	  Mario Cuomo after watching Fahrenheit 9/11 3 times : "I was convinced that it should be viewed and reflected upon by as many Americans as possible... especially young people who, in a few years, might be part of our military forces. I'm committed personally to the proposition, as more than just a lawyer, that everybody should see this film." (Chicago Sun-Times, 6/17)   Carson Daly : "I think it's important that there's something that's provocative out there for younger people. I'm 30 so for anybody that doesn't think about what's important to the country, at least there's something provocative that they can go see, make up their own mind." (KXAN-TV, 6/15) 	  Patti Davis, daughter of Ronald Reagan : "Seeing "Fahrenheit 9/11" made me think deeply about love of country, how it molds us, drives and emboldens us and how it can sometimes make us so angry we want to shout out to the world: "No, this is wrong." Many things have been said about the movie, and of course about its director, Michael Moore. But I don't think I've heard anyone comment on Moore's love for America. It seemed evident to me that the film was born from that love." (Newsweek, 7/20)   Leonardo DiCaprio : "I think a lot of people are going to be talking about this film. And I think a lot more people who are on the fence about who to vote for, after they see the film, they'll be solidified in their vote." (NY Observer, 6/21) 	  Dale Earnhardt Jr. : said that he had taken his buddies to see Fahrenheit 9/11 and that "it's a good thing as an American to go see." (The Guardian, 7/10)   Frances Fisher : "Every American has to see this movie." (USA Today 6/10) 	  John Fogerty : "With the Michael Moore movie, certain conservative talk show hosts call him un-American. Him and anybody else who says anything about the war. .... To question your country's policy, especially in a war that kills people, is definitely not un-American. It's probably the most patriotic thing you can do." (Scripps Howard News Service, 7/14)   Tom Hanks : "I want Michael Moore to have my seven bucks for that movie." (USA Today, 6/15) 	  Seymour Hersh : "The truth is it's so ironic. The best information we may get about this election may come from a combination of The Control Room, Fahrenheit 9/11, John Sayles, the nightly news from Jon Stewart..." (www.informationclearinghouse.info, 7/19)   Madonna : "I don't think I ever cried so hard at a movie in my life. I urge each and every one of you to see it." (NY Daily News, 6/18) 	  Camryn Manheim : "A lot of us look to Michael Moore to uncover the real truth." (USA Today 6/10)   Moby : "I think Fahrenheit 9/11 is very truthful. I think the reason Fahrenheit 9/11 is so important is because it tells the truth about issues where the truth has been suppressed for the last three years." (CNBC, "Topic A with Tina Brown", 6/20) 	  Rob Reiner : "I think this is one of the most important films ever made. It has the potential of actually affecting the election, and if it does, it will change the world. There are very few films or works of art that have a profound effect on world affairs," he said, mentioning "Uncle Tom's Cabin" and "I Am a Fugitive From a Chain Gang."

(Las Vegas Review-Journal, 7/16) 	  Leelee Sobieski : "(It) should be required for everyone in America to see as part of their education in high schools." (USA Today 6/10)   Tilda Swinton : When an Italian journalist complained that the film had "only one point of view", she replied, "We've heard what Bush has to say. We live with it. It's not a fair fight. This film helps to redress the balance." (Chicago Sun-Times, 5/24) 	  Quentin Tarantino, Cannes 2004 Jury President : "We want you to know that the politics of your film had nothing to do with this award . . . We're giving (it to) you, because you made a great movie." (Chicago Tribune, 5/30) "A film can be funny and that's all it has to be. It can make me cry. It can make me laugh. It can disturb me. It can elate me. This film did all of those." (Toronto Globe and Mail, 5/25)   Uma Thurman : "I'd like to hear why it is that Disney thinks (Moore) should be censored. I'd like to hear a statement to that." (Entertainment Weekly, 5/28)

         I always keep coming to  urlLink this site  to see if there's any updates. Amy Bowers is a journalist that was in the middle east for awhile. She's actually had her  urlLink camera stolen  at gunpoint but later got it back.

It's about Ashraf Al Giwari, a 28 year old interpreter that was shot and killed in Baghdad. She had street smarts there but I guess that doesn't mean your exempt from the danger.

      System of a Down joined director Michael Moore and the crew from "Bowling for Columbine" to make the video for "BOOM!"   See the video  urlLink here &nbsp;    Michael Moore was arrested during the filming of the video "Sleep Now In The Fire" by Rage Against The Machine, protesting Wall Street and the investment of American money overseas. The filming also shut down the New York Stock Exchange early that day when band members tried to enter the floor univited.  That video can be found on kazza but meantime here's the lyrics:   The world is my expense The cost of my desire Jesus blessed me with its future And I protect it with fire So raise your fists And march around Just dont take what you need Ill jail and bury those committed And smother the rest in greed Crawl with me into tomorrow Or Ill drag you to your grave Im deep inside your children Theyll betray you in my name  Hey, Hey Sleep now in the fire Hey, Hey Sleep now in the fire  The lie is my expense The scope of my desire The party blessed me with its future And I protect it with fire I am the Nina The Pinta The Santa Maria The noose and the rapist The fields overseer The agents of orange The priests of Hiroshima The cost of my desire Sleep now in the fire  Hey, Hey Sleep now in the fire Hey, Hey Sleep now in the fire  For its the end of history Its caged and frozen still There is no other pill to take So swallow the one That made you ill The Nina The Pinta The Santa Maria The noose and the rapist The fields overseer The agents of orange The priests of Hiroshima The cost of my desire Sleep now in the fire  Yeaaaaaah  Sleep now in the fire Sleep now in the fire Sleep now in the fire Sleep now in the fire

         He was the Palestinian teenager who wanted to become a suicide attacker. He's now 16 and in Israel serving up to a 3year prison term.&nbsp;BBC news went to the prison for an interview to ask him of the events of that morning and what he was going to do after his term in the prison is over. The reporter descibed him by saying  "He was wearing a brown prison uniform and handcuffs. He was tiny - he didn't even reach my shoulder."   &nbsp;   Interview   &nbsp;   James Reynolds : Everyone saw the TV pictures of you at the checkpoint that day. Can you tell me what you did that day?  &nbsp;   Hussam Abdo : In the morning at 6am I prayed and kissed my mother goodbye and told her I was going to school.&nbsp;Then I went to my friend's house at 6am. He took me to some guys in Nablus. I sat with them and spoke to them. And then they took pictures of me and put on the bomb belt. And then I went off to the checkpoint. I got to the checkpoint at 1pm. The army caught me at 1.30pm. I stayed with the soldiers at the checkpoint till 9pm and then they took me to the military base.  &nbsp;   JR : When you went out with your bomb belt what was your target?      Hussam : They told me to go to a checkpoint. They told me you blow yourself up at the checkpoint. They showed me a videotape of it.      JR : When you put on that belt did you really know - as a 15-year-old - that you were going to go and murder people, that you were going to go and cause great suffering to mothers and fathers, that you were going to be a mass murderer? Did you really know that?    Hussam : Yes. Just like they came and caused our parents sadness and suffering they too should feel this. Just like we feel this - they should also feel it.   &nbsp;  J  R : Were you excited ?  &nbsp;   Hussam : I was a little bit nervous. But not to the point that I was very scared. I was kind of normal.      JR : Were you scared of dying?    Hussam : No. I'm not afraid of death.      JR : Why not?      Hussam : Nobody is going to live forever. We're all going to die.      JR : But you were only 15 years old at the time.      Hussam : I wanted to be relieved of school.      JR : When the army caught you, how did you feel?      Hussam : I was a bit scared. The soldiers came to me and there were many of them so I was a bit scared. I was afraid that they would beat me but I wasn't afraid that they'd shoot me. They were nice to me - they treated me well.      JR : Are you sad that you didn't manage to blow yourself up and kill many Israelis?      Hussam : I feel normal. But I thank God that the operation didn't go through.      JR : You thank God that you didn't die - why?      Hussam : It's just the way it is. God doesn't want me to die.      JR : Who sent you?      Hussam : My friend Nasser. He's 16. He was my classmate.      JR : How did he tell you about it?      Hussam : I was sitting with a friend of mine and he comes to me and says can you find me a martyr bomber?&nbsp;Then I told him I'll do it. My friend says - really? And I answer - yes I'll do it.  So he agreed and he took me to see another guy. The guy's name was Wael. He was from Al Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades. He was 21. Then he took me to another guy who put the bomb belt on me and they took pictures of me. The pictures were on the day before. Of course he asked me a lot of questions. He asked me who I was and why I wanted to do this. I answered all of his questions. I told him I wanted to do it because of my friend who was killed and he agreed to let me do it.    JR : Did the people who sent you - the people from the Al Aqsa Brigades - did they promise you anything?     Hussam : Of course they did. They told me, once you carry out the operation and the soldiers come and demolish your home, we'll stand by your parents and rebuild your house and give them money.    JR : What are your feelings towards the people who sent you?    Hussam : I feel normal. One of them is my friend and he will stay my friend because, just like, me he's also in prison.    JR : Did you ever talk to your family about what you were going to do?    Hussam : I didn't tell my parents.    JR : Why not?    Hussam : Because if I'd told my mother she wouldn't have let me leave the house. She'd have yelled at me, cried and told me not to do it.    JR : Have you spoken to them since your arrest?    Hussam : I spoke to them shortly after I was arrested. I was at the army base and the doctor there was checking me and I told him I wanted to speak to my mother, so he lent me his mobile phone. He let me speak to my mother. She began to cry - she'd seen what happened on TV. Then the doctor took the phone away from me and he spoke to my mother. He said don't worry about your son, he's fine, we'll take care of him.   &nbsp;  JR : How did you feel when you spoke to your mother?    Hussam : I felt relieved.    JR : Some teenagers want to be footballers, others want to be singers. You wanted to be a suicide bomber. Why?    Hussam : It's not suicide - it's martyrdom. I would become a martyr and go to my God. It's better than being a singer or a footballer. It's better than everything.    JR : What was the main reason for you deciding to become a suicide bomber? The one reason in particular.    Hussam : The reason was because my friend was killed. The second reason I did it is because I didn't want to go to school. My parents forced me to go to school and I didn't feel like going.    JR : Are you saying that one of the reasons you wanted to become a suicide bomber was because you didn't like your teacher?    Hussam : That and because of my friend Sabih, who was killed.    JR : It seems extreme that if you don't like your teacher it could partially propel you towards murder and suicide.   Hussam : The thing is my parents forced me to go to school and I didn't want to go.  So I used to go there and run away. Then I had problems with the teachers. The principal took me to the police because I got into a fight with the teachers.    JR : Let's say there's another kid your age - 15 or 16 - and he wanted to go and blow himself up and kill Israelis. Would you stop him?    Hussam : I would stop him because if he got caught he would go to prison and it's not a nice place and he shouldn't be away from his parents.    JR : If you could turn back time and go back to that morning would you do it again?    Hussam : No.    JR : You wouldn't do it again? Why not?    Hussam : Because of prison. And also in the end there'll be peace.    JR : You really think in the end there will be peace?    Hussam : Yes.    JR : Do you know how long you will be here in an Israeli prison?    Hussam : The lawyer told me two-three years.    JR : What do you want to do with your life when you get out of prison?    Hussam : I want to go home and be with my parents and work in my father's shop.

      Last month we  urlLink (Eastern Bikes)  held a joke contest and received several entries. There are several types of humor so the only fair way to judge this contest was to take two people with two totally different sense of humor and see if they could both agree on any jokes as being really funny. So after reviewing all the jokes, our judges picked a winner. There was a close second place winner so we decided to send our runner up something to.   Here’s the winning joke: When I was younger I hated going to weddings... it seemed that all of my aunts and the grandmotherly types used to come up to me, poking me in the ribs and cackling, telling me, 'You're next.' They stopped that crap after I started doing the same thing to them at funerals.  Sent to us by Braden Wallace  Check out  urlLink Leighs' monthly updates ....he's a gas.

"On January 2, U.S. troops detained Reuters cameraman  Ahmed Mohammad Hussein al-Badrani , Reuters journalist BadraniSalem, and their driver, Sattar Jabar al-Badrani, near Fallujah. The journalists say they came under U.S. fire while attempting to cover the aftermath of the downing of a U.S. helicopter by guerrillas and were later detained by U.S. soldiers. The three Iraqis were held for three days and allegedly subjected to abuse. The U.K.-based Guardian newspaper reported on January 13 that the journalists were blindfolded, forced to stand for hours with their arms raised, and threatened with sexual abuse. Citing a family member of one of the journalists, the paper said that U.S. interrogators forced one of the men to take off his clothes and put a shoe in his mouth. Repeated attempts to get comment from the U.S. military about this incident were unsuccessful."    Update : I just talked to him!! =p

        Now the real prospects for authentic democracy depend on something else. They depend on how the people in the rich and priveliged societies learn some other lessons. For example the lessons that are being taught right now like the Mayans in Chiapas, Mexico. They are among the most impoverished and oppressed sectors in the continent. But unlike us they retain a vibrant tradition of liberty and democracy. A tradition that we've allowed to slip out of our hands or has been stolen from us. And unless people here in the rich and privileged society, unless they can recapture and revitalize that tradition, the prospects for democracy are indeed dim. Does it seem strange to you? The confetti. The balloons. The mile-wide grins and the victory dance to welcome in the heir to a state of (utter and complete) disrepair? Because it sure seems strange to me: they're acting like they won the fucking lottery! I mean, shouldn't they feel terror at the task that lies ahead: to feed and house the people that this system's left for dead. And could I have hit the nail much harder on the head? It's profits before lives. They are motivated by greed. First they taught us to depend on their nation-states to mend our tired minds, our broken bones, our bleeding limbs. But now they've sold off all the splints and contracted out the tourniquets and if we jump through hoops then we might just survive. Is this what we deserve? To scrub the palace floors? To fight amongst ourselves? As we scramble for the crumbs they spit out, frothing at the mouth about the scapegoats that they've chosen for us. With every racist pointed finger I can hear the goose-steps getting closer. They no longer represent us so is it not our obligation to confront this tyranny?...Propagandhi(1996)       "A patriot must always be ready to defend his country against his government." ...Edward Abby   It is our duty to question and hold accountable the power that is used in our name.

       urlLink This article  from CNN says the FBI and Postal Inspection Service are conducting searches in western New York and the central New Jersey coast relating to the investigation of deadly anthrax-laced letters mailed in the fall of  2001 . 2001?! Common!! Authorities are  still  trying to trace where the anthrax used in the letters originated. They're using search warrents to search through peoples houses. Officials would not say what agents are looking for in the homes but the headline of this article is "Anthrax investigators search in N.Y., N.J."   And look at the kind of neighborhood they're at doing these investigations.    I bet you won't see them in any inner city doing these things. Most of those people know of their rights.  I especially like the last two sentences in this article...  "Officials hope if they can pinpoint the origin of the anthrax that will help them find the perpetrator. But officials involved in the probe have  privately  said they are not making much progress."   All and all, there's nothing to be afraid of right? Just go about your normal lives.  urlLink "The situation could hardly get worse."

        There are no plans yet to remake "The Dirty Dozen," but music's own dirty dozen are heading to Hollywood. D12 plan to make two movies in the coming months, according to their spokesperson.  Few details have been released about the projects except that one, "Devil's Night"(named after D12's debut album), is a horror movie, and the other, "Runyon Cash," is named after a street that members of the Detroit group grew up on, à la "8 Mile." Both are scheduled for release in 2005.  Max Gousse and Jeremy Geffen, who together manage D12, are producing the movies. Gousse, who previously worked with B2K at Epic Records, executive produced "You Got Served."   urlLink Source

         Bill O'Reilly gives his opionion  urlLink here  about how an hour long speech by John Kerry would not only hurt John Kerry physically but test the peoples indurance unless he's "spellbinding." ...Spellbinding?! I don't see the scientist chasing after him accusing him of using psychology like  urlLink G.W. Bush  is doing.  urlLink CNN reports  from some scientists that by G.W. Bush talking about death (ie. 9/11) it makes people in need of psychological security.  Yes, I said it was a report by CNN of all news sources.     So in closing I'll say that the only people that are "spellbound" here are the die hard viewers of Fox News, which just happens to be ran by G.W.Bush's cousin.
