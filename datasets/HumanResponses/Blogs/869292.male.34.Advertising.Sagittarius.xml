      As some of you know, Superstar Billy Graham (the former pro wrestler that received Kate's liver donation) is writing an autobiography and has asked me to design the cover of the book. Here's an update...     This is where we're at right now. We still have to add some text to the front at the bottom. And I'm sure Simon & Schuster will have something to say about it since they are publishing the book, but essentially this is it. It's been fun working on this project and I can't wait to see it on a book shelf at Barnes & Noble!

      In case you were wondering what my computer screen looks like...  This is pretty much it at any given time. I'm organizing some photos in this picture, plus listening to iTunes and chatting with friends on iChat.

       urlLink Pixar's  "Finding Nemo" has surpassed Disney's "The Lion King" to become the top-grossing animated film ever.     Pixar's "Finding Nemo" has surpassed Disney's "The Lion King" to become the top-grossing animated film ever. "Finding Nemo" brought in $313.1 million in nine weeks vs. Lion King's $312.9 million.  Janet and I took my nephew to see the movie and we all thought it was fantastic. I never thought I would see the day when I believed that an animated movie for kids was the best movie of the year!  All I can say is, "Mine, Mine, Mine, Mine, Mine!"

      Janet and I have both been working pretty hard lately, so this past weekend we decided to run and hide in the Arizona mountains...  A family member has a nice cabin in Prescott, AZ - just a few hours drive from Phoenix. We drove up on Friday night and stayed until Sunday. It was a fantastic trip, and while only two days, it provided some much need rest for both of us.  We took a short hike (short because my knee started acting up - apparently it isn't completely healed from surgery), fed lots of birds and chipmunks, and watched a grouchy hummingbird guard a feeder.  We took a few pictures, which I hope to post as soon as we get them developed, so check back soon to see them!

      The trip to work from a visual perspective. Just a few photos of my commute to the office each day. Some photos taken while I was actually driving - not exactly the poster child for safe driving am I?  I traded in my great job in Vegas with an 8-minute commute with literally no traffic at all, to move to Phoenix where I have to battle bumper-to-bumper traffic for 45-minutes each way! What????  Here's a teaser photo taken while driving to work, as well as the final destination. You can view the full trip in the  urlLink photo album .

      I saw this on a web site today and thought it was hilarious.... but then again, I grew up in the Midwest!  A message from the rural Midwest ----Because of misunderstandings that frequently develop when Easterners and Californians cross states such as Illinois, Ohio, Indiana, Wisconsin,Nebraska, Kansas, Iowa, Missouri, Minnesota, North Dakota, and South Dakota; those states' Tourism Councils have adopted a set of information guidelines. In an effort to help outsiders  understand the Midwest, the following list will! be handed to each driver entering the state:  1. That farm boy standing next to the feed bin did more work before breakfast than you do all week at the gym.  2. It's called a 'gravel road.' No matter how slow you drive, you're going to  get dust on your Navigator. I have a four wheel drive because I need it. Drive  it or get it out of the way.  3. We all started hunting and fishing when we were seven years old.Yeah,we saw Bambi. We got over it.  4. Any references to "corn fed" when talking about our women will get you whipped... by our women.  5. Go ahead and bring your $600 Orvis Fly Rod. Don't cry to us if a flathead catfish breaks it off at the handle.  We have a name for those little trout you fish for...bait.  6. Pull your pants up. You look like an idiot.  7. If that cell phone rings while a bunch of mallards are making their final approach, we will shoot it.! You might hope you don't have it up to your ear at the time.  8. That's right. Whiskey is only two bucks. We can buy a fifth for what you paid in the airport for one drink.  9.No, there's no "Vegetarian Special" on the menu. Order steak. Order it rare. Or, you can order the Chef's Salad and pick off the two pounds of ham and turkey.  10. You bring Coke into my house,it better be brown, wet, and served over  ice.  11. So you have a sixty-thousand dollar car you drive on weekends. We're real impressed. We have quarter of a  million dollar combines that we use  two weeks a year.  12. Let's get this straight. We have one stoplight in town. We stop when it's red. We may even stop when it's yellow.  13. Our women hunt, fish, and drive trucks--because they want to. So,you're a feminist. Isn't that cute..  14. Yeah, we eat catfish. Carp, too--and turtle. You really want sushi and caviar?  It's available at the bait shop.  15. They are pigs. That's what they smell like. Get over it. Don't like it? Interstates 70, 80,& 90 go two ways-- Interstates 29 &35 go the other two.. Pick one and use it accordingly.  16. The "Opener" refers to the first day of deer season. It's a religious holiday. You can get breakfast at the church.  17. So every person in every pickup waves. It's called being friendly.Understand the concept?  18. Yeah, we have golf courses. Don't hit in the water hazard. It spooks the fish.  19.That Highway Patrol Officer that just pulled you over for driving like an idiot....his name is "Sir"...no matter how old  he is.  Now, enjoy your visit.

      OK, I'm a tad bit nervous about the strange foliage growing in my backyard. After seeing what the government was up to in the X-Files: Fight the Future movie, the last thing I wanted to see growing in my backyard was corn...  But apparently, that is just what I have. Is it a government conspiracy? Is it a poor, misguided corn seed that fell from the claws of a bird? Is it simply a really big weed? I have no idea. You be the judge. The photo on the left was take about 4 weeks ago when the foliage in question was about 6 to 8 inches in height. The photo on the right was taken today, and is easily 24" in height. We are also receiving strange radio signals from what appears to be a government space station.... but that's probably just a coincidence!

      I guess it was only a matter of time before AOL/Time Warner (parent company of Netscape) killed off Netscape Communicator & Mozilla (Netscape's beta team).  For those that don't know, Netscape Navigator was the evolution of "Mosaic," the first web browser. Netscape basically owned the internet as far as browsers goes. But then Bill Gates stepped in and stole the entire market right out from under Netscape. AOL purchased Netscape a few years ago, and since that time Mozilla/Netscape has languished, and the software bloated up to buggy, sluggish crap software. Even AOL itself uses Microsoft Internet Explorer. The one saving grace that Netscape had was that it was the premier browser on the Macintosh platform. That is until Apple released their own web browser, Safari, and gave it away free of charge. It's faster, smaller file size, has nearly as many features and is much easier to use.  Though I haven't really used Netscape in a long time (even I made the switch to IE years ago until  urlLink Safari  came along), I'm sad to see Netscape go. They were always a small sign of competition against the evil empire. It's rumored, and I suspect it's true, that even though AOL killed off Netscape, Mozilla will continue to thrive, since it's an open source browser anyway. Hopefully, a few good coders can come along and make Mozilla what it always had the potential to be... a lean, mean surfing machine!

      Halfway through my first week at R&R and I feel like I've worked 10 days without sleep.  Wednesday was filled with meetings. 2 hours of brainstorming a "get out and vote" campaign, followed by another hour and a half staff meeting over lunch discussing Cox Communications branding/marketing strategies. A few odd jobs and back to another meeting. Arghh!!! My ass hurts!  So far, I haven't settled into a comfort zone at the office, I'm still in the "new guy" zone, getting to know everyone and where I fit in on the food chain.  One upside is the near daily Foosball tournaments! Almost as much fun to watch as it is to play.  On the freelance front, I got two more jobs to complete, to accompany the web site I already have to get done. One is a poster for a car show (a fun subject), the other are simple rate cards for a convention center.

      Two days of living the "bachelor life" is enough!  Janet has been spending two days a week in Tucson for the last several weeks to train new employees, and crack the whip on the corporate execs! I know she enjoys it from a work perspective, and I don't mind the time to myself, but it's great to have her home. The dogs miss here too, since she tends to throw the frisbee a few extra times!

      We can argue that statement all night long.     Apple introduced the PowerMacintosh G5 a short while ago. Since the last year of work has been freelance, and I haven't purchased anything to write off so far, Janet has more or less given me the go-ahead to buy something... and anyone who knows me will surely know that this is what I'm looking to upgrade my war-chest with!  The G5 will go quite nicely with my recently purchased Formac 2010 Gallery LCD display!

      A friend from the  urlLink MacMinute Reader Cafe  created a fantastic little OSX app.  JonnyCat over at the MacMinute ReaderCafe developed an app that is a God-send to anyone who frequents web forums and regularly posts images.   urlLink Xtralean software  (as JC goes by) gives us ImageWell, a free OSX Menu Bar extra/application which allows you to edit images and upload them to your iDisk, FTP or WebDav server. I won't go into a lot of details, but I will tell you that if you are a regular at a web forum, this app is a MUST HAVE!

      A great new program from the guys at Iconfactory.  I confess, I love the Mac OSX interface, and one of the things I like is the ability to change all the icons on my system whenever I want with just the click of a button.   urlLink Iconfactory  just released Pixadex 1.0 and it rocks. It's kind of like a photo album for icons. It's fully searchable, and offers drag and drop control as well as the ability to import/export iContainers for Candybar (another great utility from Iconfactory).  If you haven't tried it, and your collection of 3,247 icons is driving you crazy when you're trying to find the perfect one for a folder, then I urge you to give the program a shot.  You can download a demo  urlLink here .

      After a year of freelancing upon moving to back to Phoenix, I'm employed again...  I left R&R Partners in Las Vegas with little hope of getting hired at their Phoenix office. It's a much smaller office than the 120 people we had in Vegas. So I began my freelance career, keeping most of my long-time clients from Vegas, and hoping to gain more in Phoenix quickly.  Just when I start to build-up my Phoenix client base, wham, R&R Phoenix calls me and I start work with them the next day. Amazing how fast things change.  So, I've already started offloading existing freelance work, keeping only my long-time clients (the ones I really love to work with).  I'm looking forward to being at R&R again. After my first few day, I hope to settle in and start kickin' ass and takin' names!

      ...Well, my little corner of it anyway. All sorts of new things happening around the Dempsey house lately.  A new web page, a new job for me, a new position at the office for the wife and new landscaping for our yard. All sorts of new things lately.  I started a new job with a former employer this week. R&R Partners hired me to work in the Phoenix office almost a year to the day after leaving the R&R office in Las Vegas. It's good to be "back home" as far as employment goes. I've been freelancing since moving to Phoenix a year ago, and while it was really starting to pick up, I missed the human interaction I had while working for someone else.  Janet got a new position at her company. I'm just counting the time until she's running the company!  The front yard landscaping has finally been completed. We removed the grass when we bought the house, and finally got around to completing the yard by adding rocks - for a desert landscape. We also added rocks around the shed in the backyard.

      It aint no holiday for me...  We have a 3-day weekend, unfortunately, I’m going to be busy finishing up concepting on a client web site, finishing up a poster and some ads for a car show for another client, and starting some show cards for yet another client. I remember the day when a long weekend meant going out of town or hanging out with friends and family for an extra day... I miss that!!!

      We're nearing the end of the first week of the gas shortage...  It's been a stressful week here in Phoenix with the gas situation. Last week a pipeline broke that supplies some of the gas to the valley. Gas prices rose up to $4.00+ per gallon at some stations, while most remained in the $2.25 - $2.99 range. The problem wasn't the price, it was the availability. I would venture to guess that maybe 2 out of 10 stations actually had gas to sell on any given day this week. Lines at the pump were anywhere from 10 to 50 cars long and tempers were flaring everywhere.  Thankfully, Janet and I were able to carpool to work a few days which eased our gas consumption, and we both lucked out in finding a station that had gas late this week with little or no line. So we're good on gas for at least the weekend. We're being told that things should be getting better by the end of the weekend, but I'll believe it when I see it.  The upside to it is that there were significantly less cars on the road, so traffic was at a bare minimum which made for pleasant, traffic-free rides to and from work.

      Wayne has sent us the tickets to SummerSlam for this weekend, but how will Mom survive?  I've always been a pro-wrestling fan. I always describe it as a "soap opera for men." So Janet and I, along with my parents will be attending one of the largest pay-per-view events of the year for the WWE. It's sold out, and the main event is a 6 man steel cage match (where they all fight at one time in a giant steel cage - which makes for lots of blood).  Janet and I have been to a wrestling show before, but my parents haven't. Dad has watched it on TV a few times, so he has some idea what he's in for. But Mom on the other hand isn't aware that she's in for high-flying acrobatics, half (or completely) naked women prancing around and the pyrotechnics that accompany many of the wrestlers entrance to the arena. I'm actually more interested in seeing her reaction to everything than I am in the show.

      I've been living with an electric lawn-mower (probably about a 2 horsepower engine), and while it worked fine in our small yard in Las Vegas, it just doesn't cut it here (pun intended).     I went out today and bought a Craftsman, 7 horsepower, self-propelled, multi-speed mower! Awesome!!! No more pushing the mower with muscle, no more flipping an extension cord around, no more running over the same spot 3 times to get the grass cut level!  I never thought I would be excited about getting a lawn mower, but to be honest, I rather enjoy the time outside cutting the lawn, and this new mower will make it a lot less work, and a lot more enjoyment.  The best part was, the mower I got was discounted nearly $100 because Sears was out of stock on the lower price one, so they gave me a better one at the same price as the lower end machine. Sweet!

      I don't ever recall "needing" a weekend like I need this weekend.  Work has been stressful this entire week - with lots of concept work for Cox Communications. Combine that with freelance work, and I've about reached my limit with patience. The lawn needs mowing more than boxing needs a white heavyweight!  Janet and I are still trying to find window coverings for the house. We haven't quite decided what to get yet, but after a year of having what was in the house when we moved in, we're definitely ready.  On the brighter side, we got a call from Wayne ( urlLink Superstar Billy Graham  - Kate's organ donor recipient and former pro wrestler) letting us know that he has comped us tickets to the upcoming " urlLink SummerSlam " pay-per-view event at America West Arena.     My parents have never been to a WWE pro-wrestling event, so it should be interesting to see their reaction to it. Janet and I went to one a few years ago and had a great time.  I also finally got to see and hear from someone I met on the internet about two years ago who lives in Canada. I met Alec on the  urlLink MacCentral  web forums and we've had a pretty good "online friendship" since then. Since he lives in Canada, there isn't much opportunity to hook up for a quick beer, but this past week we video conferenced over the computer for a few minutes. Anyone who has the opportunity to use video conferencing should give it a shot if you know someone who also has a web cam. It didn't cost us a dime, and it's better than a phone call because you can actually see the person. We used  urlLink iChat  from Apple to hook up, but there are many conferencing apps available. I used our Sony CamCorder hooked up to the computer. It's not the ideal web cam, but it works. I will probably be getting Apple's  urlLink iSight  web cam soon, which will make for a more pleasant experience.

      Anyone who's turned on the boob-tube in the last year or so knows that their are only 3 shows on television: E.R., the Sopranos and reality shows.  Personally I think they pretty much all suck, with the exception of Survivor (the one that started it all), and American Idol - which is worth watching if for no other reason than to see Simon just rip the hell out of people's ego!  In any case, I thought this cartoon pretty much sums it up!

      Janet and I went and saw Bad Boys II today. Don't like action movies... don't go then!     All I can say is, "Don't buy a soda" - because you aren't going to want to miss a second of this flick to go to the restroom! If you're an action-movie junkie like I am, BB2 won't dissappoint you! It's one car racing, gun-shooting, fist fighting scene after another. It does get a little gross - I counted three people who lost their heads (literally) via bullets or speeding automobiles. Comedy and action made this flick one that I wouldn't mind buying the DVD for!

      The only bad part about the summer (besides the heat here in the desert) is the lack of ANY decent television. Thankfully, this week marked a new season of  Survivor, E.R., West Wing, Soprano's  and soon,  "24" .  I fear our NetFlix account won't get used much for the next few months.

      Janet and I finally got a kitchen table this past week. We've been considering a new one for a long time now, but were waiting for the right time and it finally came. Solid oak, 96-inch table with self-storing leafs and 8 chairs!  It's nice to have a table that when we have both leafs in, is large enough to seat both our families during the holidays and get-togethers.  I suppose less time will be spent sitting in front of the boob-tube eating now, which is not necessarily a bad thing considering the quality of television shows lately.  Pictures to follow soon!

      Apple is being sued by Apple Corps., the parent company of The Beatles, over the iPod and the iTunes Music Store. According to Fox News, the breach of contract case was filed a short time ago in London's High Court of Justice, but was just served to Apple in California in the last couple of days. This is the third time Apple has been sued by the band. The Beatles filed suit against the company in 1981 over the use of its corporate name. The result of the suit was a huge cash settlement and a promise that Apple would stay out of the music industry. Years later, 'when computers starting having music come through attachable speakers,' The Beatles again sued and won, this time over breach of a trademark agreement since Apple had agreed to steer clear of the music business. It is estimated that Apple has paid US$50 million so far to the band. "

         I guess it goes without saying that September 11th will never be "just another day." My thoughts go back to 2001 and I think of all the brave fireman who gave their lives trying to rescue people from the towers. Also to the families of victims... what an incredible loss.     Every generation seems to have "that one big thing" in their lives that they remember exactly where they were, what they were doing and who they were with when it happened - such as Pearl Harbor, the Kennedy assisination, the Space Shuttle Challenger, etc... Unfortunately, September 11, 2001 will most likely prove to be "that one big thing" for us.

      In the past 3 weeks, R&R Partners (the agency I work for) pitched 3 new accounts. We were working 15 hours or more a day preparing our presentation and coming up with new creative work to show them. I barely even saw Janet last week, as she was in bed by the time I got home, and gone by the time I got up in the morning.  This week we found out that we got all 3 accounts! So we are now the agency of record for Phoenix International Raceway, Valley Metro (Bus System) and National Bank of Arizona. Whoo-hoooo!!!  We are already trying to figure out how to fit more people into our already crowded office. It's especially pleasing because there is a larger ad agency a few floors up in our building and we beat them out on one of the accounts - so we have territorial "bragging rights!" And with P.I.R., I'm sure we'll all be getting free passes to the NASCAR races whenever we want (at least, I hope we do!).

       Lick Me, I'm A Macintosh  What the hell is wrong with Apple that they still  give a damn about design and packaging and "feel"?     By Mark Morford, SF Gate Columnist   Oh right like you even care.   Like careful sexy product design even matters and as if you give a twit for packaging and aesthetics and user experience anymore in this overly plastic bloatedly excessive landfill wasteland Wal-Mart dystopia we call proud capitalist gimme gimme gimme America.   And OK maybe every now and then you sigh and give in and buy yourself a new tech gadget, because you're just that kind of consumer lackey and not really expecting much anyway but who the hell cares it's just one more hunk of tech landfill but what can you do.   And maybe you buy yourself, say, a new Apple PowerBook, as I just did, and it comes in this really quite beautiful sleek black box with small elegant typeface and gorgeous subtle graphics and a strange and obvious attention to detail and you think, pshaw, who cares, just another big heartless tech corporation trying to smooth talk me, just another suckass hunk of plastic and wire and metal to break down in a month and be obsolete in a year and really, why should I give a damn.   And yet. You can't help but notice. Apple seemed to really put some serious work into this, into the details, the packaging, the shape and texture. The rich black box, the clean unobtrusive font, the silver sliver inch-wide side-shot photograph of the PowerBook itself on the box lid.   No screaming colors and no garish cartoon graphics and no massive corporate logo and no bullet-point exclamation points listing the outrageous features you'll never use and you're like, wait a minute, what they hell does Apple think they're hawking here, art?   You can't help but handle the package with something approaching astonishment and even a trace of reverence. Could this actually be something interesting and reasonably cool? Could this be something tactile and lovely and graceful that flies in the face of normal mediocre dumbed-down consumer design and tepid IKEA kit furniture and bland Windows chyme?   Could this be, in short, something that actually adds a modicum of refined grace and simplicity and aesthetic warmth to the world, instead of sucking it away like so many disposable DVD players and garish LED-spasming boom boxes and 10-gallon drums of spaghetti sauce from Costco? Nah.   And you open the gorgeous black box and lift the white cardboard inside flap, itself adorned with clean offset typeface declaring "Designed by Apple in California," and you are confronted with what is quite possible the most thoughtfully designed and pleasing packaging you've ever seen, not like you care about this stuff and hey it's all just Styrofoam and garbage anyway, but still.   Cables wrapped in elegant tight slots on the sides. Small manual and paperwork in the center. All clean and clear and meant for optimum visual and tactile experience. Lift out the top half of the foam and there's the computer itself, solo, centered, encased in beautiful eminently touchable sleek aluminum, a subtle tech-fetish object par excellence, wrapped in delicate foam padding and not cluttered with crap and not requiring you to do anything but lift it out and peel back the sheath and stroke the silver metal and turn it on.   And there it is. The welcome screen. An exquisite downtempo chill soundtrack and the world "Welcome" swimming over the monitor in a number of different languages and you think, what the hell is this? Where's the pain? Where's the hassle and the misaligned factory molding and the broken keyboard and the 3,000 setup steps and the sense that I'm drowning in a sea of programmer jargon and plastic waste and ubergeek hell?   This is what Apple does. This is what they are known for and why their design team is so famous and why they win so many awards and why they engender such passionate devotion from their adherents and why Macs are still far, far superior to PCs and always will be. It's true.   Apple actually cares about this sort of thing. Which is odd. Which is rare. Which is why they deserve gushing adulation now and then. They actually put the time and energy and labor into creating a gorgeous package most people will toss anyway, and why they include a first-time welcome experience, with subtle music, with flowing lush clean graphics, one that will never be repeated, just because.   This is the point. Detail and nuance and texture and a sense of how users actually feel, what makes them smile, what makes the experience worthy and positive and sensual instead of necessary and drab and evil.   These are the things that are nearly dead in our mass-consumer culture, things normally reserved for elitist niche markets and swanky boutiques and upscale yuppie Euro spas and maybe cool insider mags like I-D and Metropolis and dwell. They are most definitely not to be expected of mass-market gadget makers. This is why it matters. This is why it's important.   Oh sure, Apple's elitist. This is the common line. Sure they're slightly more expensive and cater to artists and designers and creative types and people who actually care about such pointless stuff as fit and finish and "feel."   And they command only a sliver of the PC market overall and despite how their designs and innovations resonate across the entire industry and in fact affect industrial design across all consumer culture, true PC/Windows geeks just scoff and snort and go back to trying to patch the latest of 13,876 "severe" or "drastic" security flaws in the nonintuitive bug-ridden hell that is Windows.   Look here, at the packaging for the iPod. You ain't about to find this type of artistic approach in any sort of mass-consumer package design. Yes, it is one of the most expensive MP3 players on the market. Yes, it is by all accounts the best and most elegantly designed MP3 player on the market. And, yes, it is selling by the truckload. There are reasons for this.   Fewer and fewer manufacturers of consumer landfill crap give a damn for how consumers might actually, dare I say, care about the fit and finish of the products they decide to allow into their lives. And this is exactly the sort of nuanced stuff we so desperately need more of.   Is it just another goddamn overpriced radioactive instantly obsolete tech gadget they suck you into buying via sinister marketing and cloying ad copy and the sense that if you don't buy one now you must be a Luddite dork? Sure. But then again, maybe, just maybe, if you look a little closer, it doesn't always have to be.

      We've been extremely busy with work, the dogs, visiting family and lots of other stuff.  Our latest home improvement project is on hold til after the holidays. We removed the grass around the edge of the back yard, ran sprinkler lines and had a cement curb border put in. Once we adjust the sprinklers in the flower bed area around the yard, we can then start filling it up with rocks, and planting dozens and dozens of colorful flowers and plants that Janet has planned.  My birthday was non-eventful (just the way I like it!). Janet got me a box of cigars and we had cake and ice cream over at Mom's house.

      Dad and I made the trip from Phoenix to DesMoines this past week to pick up all of Kelley's belongings. She should be in Wisconsin by the end of next week to start her rotations, now that med school is done.  On the trip up we drove from 6:00 a.m. Saturday morning to about 3:00 a.m. Sunday morning - stopped in a hotel for 3 hours sleep and continued to DesMoines for a mid-afternoon arrival.  Once in DesMoines, which is a beautiful little town, we got to wait out 2 tornados and a massive rain storm and flooding! Oh joy!!!  It was great to see Kelley again, but that trip is one I don't care to make again any time soon. I have decided that New Mexico is the absolute ugliest state in the country. There isn't a single redeaming quality about it, other than leaving it! At least Nebraska, while flat, has some greenery and lots of farm animals to look at.  In any case, we're looking forward to seeing Kelley back in Phoenix for six months starting in December, as part of her rotations.

      I haven't updated as often as I would like to, but that's going to change. Keep coming back for lots of updates about what's going on here in Phoenix with Janet, Rufus, Wazoo and myself - as well as random ramblings about anything else we feel like yapping about.  That being said, I'm off to work for what I hope is a busier day than yesterday!

      I've been messing around with various ideas for our Web site. In the past, jdempsey.com has been a business (freelance graphic design) Web site. The last year or so, I decided to try "Blogging" instead. I enjoy the ease of use that a Blog brings to the process, but have hated the fact that I don't know CSS very well, and that makes customizing the site quite difficult.  I'm currently looking at Moveable Type, iBlog and the service I'm using now, Blogger.com. Whichever application/service I settle on, I want to add a photo album directly into the site, rather than linking to an outside service.

      A blonde woman was speeding down the road in her little red sports car and was pulled over by a female police officer who also happened to be blonde.  The cop asked to see the blonde's driver's license so she dug through her purse becoming progressively more agitated. "What does it look like?", she finally asked.  The policewoman replied, "It's square and it has your picture on it."  The driver once again looked into the purse and pulled out a square mirror, looked at it and handed it to the policewoman. "Here it is.", she said.  The blonde officer looked at the mirror, then handed it back saying, "Okay, you can go. I didn't realize you were a cop."

       urlLink Spymac ::  News  : "Despite being released in October 2003 — and overlooking the fact that there are nearly seven months left in the year — PC Magazine has named the Windows version of the iTunes media player and Music Store as its 'Software Newcomer of the Year.' With the only gripe being the so-called proprietary encoding of iTunes tracks, PC Mag has nothing but good things to say about the software, calling it 'impressive, handy and easy to use,' and of course, noting its great looks.  'Apple makes Windows apps about as often as Microsoft ships bug-free products, and if iTunes for Windows is any indication, that's a crying shame.'  The magazine also lists Mac OS X Panther as its operating system of the year (in the 'Bare Necessities' category), saying, 'we hope Microsoft is paying attention as it works on the next Windows.'"

         How many members of the Bush Administration are needed to replace a lightbulb?     The Answer is SEVEN:    1. one to deny that a lightbulb needs to be replaced   2. one to attack and question the patriotism of anyone who has questions about the lightbulb,   3. one to blame the previous administration for the need of a new lightbulb,   4. one to arrange the invasion of a country rumored to have a secret stockpile of lightbulbs,   5. one to get together with Vice President Cheney and figure out how to pay Halliburton Industries one million dollars for a lightbulb,   6. one to arrange a photo-op session showing Bush changing the lightbulb while dressed in a flight suit and wrapped in an American flag,   7. and finally one to explain to Bush the difference between screwing a lightbulb and screwing the country.
