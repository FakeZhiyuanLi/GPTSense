      Okay so maybe I lied and I can't go back to sleep now.  Who reads these??  Who takes time out of their busy schedule to read about my fish that no one even knows who I named them after??  I called Mattie to tell her about my fish and wouldnt you know it, her and Fred were about to watch a movie!!!  And I couldnt shut up, I blithered like an idiot.  Shit happens.  They're my good friends, they wont think me completely crazy, (will they??  do you??)  Anyway, I wonder if all bloggers start out with ten entries on the first day.  Or just really long ones, because none of you have limited internet time as I do.  Damn rich people.  Geezum.  Oh, one more thing, I'M PUTTING DYLAN ON MY SITE SO HE WILL HAVE NO REASON NOT TO GO PUT ME ON HIS WITHOUT ME HAVING TO DO BAD THINGS FOR HIM!!

      So what do you do when all you want to do is make him understand?  I love my boyfriend.  I do, with all my heart, there will never be anyone for me but Matt.  BUT!!  Matt started this thing last night . . . its called getting pissed.  At ME.  He’s never done that before.  We refuse to fight over things that could actually hurt our relationship, so we fight about stupid stuff (ALL THE TIME) but this??  This was real.  This was the silent treatment.  Only for a while, but it was . . . horrible.  Okay, all I said was something about Joey.  I have a friend that I’ve known for a few years now, and dated God knows how many times . . . I love this guy.  Joey.  I do, and I’ve told him to read this because I write about him, but damn. It’s more of a best friend way, though, because I do love Joey as a guy and all but I accepted when we broke up that that was the end, and now I could either get close to him or push him away.  For a while he pushed ME away, but we got over that recently. Anyway, so I said something about how when he gets back from Winter Haven that he will hopefully be spending a lot more time here, with me.  He’s visiting a buddy there and he has to stay for his buddy’s girlfriend’s mom’s wedding.  (on the 21st!!  geezum!!)  So Matt gets mad.  The conversation goes on for a few minutes, and Matt just stops, and closes his eyes – he’s all sprawled out on my bed (on his back, just like Fred did and got in trouble for) like always, and just goes rigid.  Well, of course I go get up in his face . . . that’s what I do.  I don’t leave people alone when they’re angry because I hate being alone when I’m angry!!!  And what does he do??  I’m talking and I keep kissing him even though he pretends I’m nowhere near him, and HE BITES ME.  Hard, gets my bottom lip between his teeth and bites me.  Just like he gets mad at me for doing when we’re just messing around.  Matt doesn’t get mad at me.  Or rather he didn’t, hasn’t before, blah blah blah.  But I don’t like it and I plan on avoiding hose situations in the future . . . EVEN THOUGH I WAS BEING HONEST, AND I DO STILL LOVE JOEY.  That’s it, that’s all I have to say about Matt’s attempt to make me feel like shit.  (which yes, he DID do.)

You notice how they are always afraid that their kids are going to make the same mistakes they did at a young age???  WHO does the shit your parents did??  And I dont know about you, but you cant tell me the stove is hot . . . SHARON HAS TO BURN HER HAND.

      I have been reading people's blogs that wrote to Sophie and I have found that mine is very simple but I like it's content very much.  I'm not sure how to describe some of the styles, they just aren't interesting enough.  Hell, maybe mine isn't to ya, but I am trying.  Some people just seem like critics . . . tell you what they DO day to day and not how they feel about things.  That, to me, is horrid and boring.  WHO CARES?  Call the people who want to know what you did today, but tell me how Lilo and Stitch made you FEEL!!!  Tell me how hard you laughed, not that you went to see it and it's a must see!!  (though it is, i have been to see it myself, y'all.  I went with Hoss and Antonio, we laughed so hard we cried.  Lilo is so great!  I wish I had been like her when I was younger, she kicks ass!!)  Anyway, if it were up to me, I would make all blogs like Sophie's, so they wouldnt drag, though Kat's was very PRETTY.  Okay??  Pretty.  Good night to you.  Goodnight to all.  Have a wonderful night.  Sweet sweet dreams. And for those of you that are God-fearing as I am, God bless ya.

      You know that saying "you can't teach an old dog new tricks"?  Who the heck comes up with that stuff?  Yes you can, because dogs are smart and beautiful and they know it, and they listen.  And if they don't listen they can be trained to.  And if you cant train them there will always be someone who can.  Which sucks, because I really like having an excuse not to learn new things.  I'm a veteran of my own ways, no trying to change me now.  You know, I need the light switch where I can reach it from the computer, it's a pain in the arse getting up at dusk, I've had to two days in a row now.  If anyone suffers from this same deal I would like to know about it.  My granma is mad because I close the door all the time and I cant hear her when she calls me for a phone call.  Who's granma wants to hear the kid's music all the time?  I mean I listen to some crap!!  I really do.  Geezum.  At any rate, its stuff she doesn't like.  Sometimes. Not all the time, she'll isten to Unwritten Law with me, and Nickelback, she doesn't mind them . . . it's when I break out the Veruca Salt, Pink, Alanis, Ozzy, and Rob Zombie that she cant stand.  "Did you know that man got famous by biting the head off of a buzzard?"  "it was a pigeon, Gaga, and he was messed up bad that day.  No one even talks about that anymore."  Yes, and then I tell Matt about it and he just says, "no one even talks about that anymore."  Geezum.  I wrote my mom a letter, I told her about the website.  If she gets it, HI MOM!  My mom lives in Georgia, she's the better half of my two biological parents, even though her past had it's share of problems.  So do everyone's, ever notice that?  Everyone (but Fred) has a story or hardship.  Matt does, all of our friends do.  Especially Mattie.  Sometimes I feel so bad for her, for the fact that I cause her pain when she has a lot on her plate already.  Let me go crazy on you!!  (it's Heart, what did you expect??  What are they really saying that about, anyway??)  lol.  I miss Matt, his phone is jackin up.  I'm going to kill either the phone or him tomorrow, not sure which.  Geezum.

      "I'm not the kind of person/you think I am/ I might be anti Christ or/ the Iron Man" but yet another song on the very compact disk that Ozzy Osbourne recorded is another song, saying he's "just a dreamer" . . . lol, talk about strange sides of people coming together.  I like Ozzy because he confuses me, I didn't start listening to him and Kelly until the show came out, and the music just doesn't match the stories I'd heard or the show.  Very Blue Moon, all of it.  Macronian cheese.  If you please.    She woke tonight in somebody's bed She's gone and dyed her hair red She only went and did what she did  Because he would drive her home then There's lipstick on her new dress She hadn't even paid yet But it doesn't matter where the money went  It wasn't how she paid rent Looking out across the city lights She thought they'd be a good pair He could make a living sellin cars Maybe she could work there She's gonna pick a star in the night And pray to make it all right She tried so hard not to pick a kite She always prayed to headlights Hear no speak no evil about us Yeah I think im gonna buy myself a Rolls Maybe a Chevrolet One where I can put that top down Just let my radio play Im headed out on that highway Going right out of state And I aint looking back till I pass right through  Heaven's gates  Ok, so I like the Wallflowers.  Big deal, I'm not a hard core punk or metal head, I like everything.  So sue me, Sophie, I'm not an Indie chick.

      I wish I had a dime for every time I heard Matt say "you're more than good enough for me" or "I Love You", because I would be swimming in my millions.  But what about all the times I so desperately needed to hear those words and the people that I wanted to say them screwed me over?  What about what I need?  Well, I have everything I need and want right now, but Mattie will tell you, I worry about tomorrow.  I wish I was like Sophie, and I had this life that I could just write about stupid things I think . . . geezum, Lord knows I have tried.  Check out the first entries.  There will be happy ones, and my template is happy, but gosh sometimes its good to be grim and sad . . . and lonely and mean.  Matt's at work now, and usually I think too much about bad things while he's at work, but today is different.  Today I just KNOW, finally, that it's all gonna work out for him and not just me, that he isn't going to leave me.  Do you ever get that feeling?  Like you found love, only it gets squashed?  You haven't found love until you know (not just wishing) that it isn't going to get squashed.  I put on a new title today.  I want to give a shout out to Coach Dunham, he calls me Red . . . people called Matt Red when he was younger and he played soccer, and that's what it says on his high school ring (which is in my possession).  It's kind of funny that I ended up with the name too, only my hair is steadily getting more strawberry blonde every day.  I like my hair when it's faded, so Im not going to dye it again for a while.  Everyone in Matt's family has red hair, so I fit right in.  My granma says, "well I knew they kept you around for SOME reason".  Geezum.  Over and out, more later.  Hi Christy!

      My family is a broken one, I have tried to patch it with everything from Scotch tape to JB Weld . . . nothing works on a torn family.  Nothing works on incessant pain.  Why do people inflict it then?  I know some people are so cruel they would put you in pain forever and not think twice, but not as many people who do it can be so careless, and rigid, and mean and cruel . . . and just plain hurtful.  Why do people cheat on one anoter?  Why do people lie when they are talking about love?  Love is the one truth, guys, the nly one that will stay true for always.  Trust isn't, because its easily broken . . . but true love??  By the way, the love you feel for your family is also true love, and you don't have to get it back to have it.  I know this; Colin refers to my father as "the jerk". Mattie told me that the only people who deserve your heart are the ones who give you theirs.  I have Matt's.  all of Matt's.  I have a little bit of Mattie's. and Fred's (a miniscule amount), I have part of Joey's, and I was always the keeper of Rickie's, but he died . . . I will tell you half my heart went to the grave with him.  The first time I skipped school I skipped to go to his funeral.  I love my Rickie.  He never let me down, he just made some bad decisions.  Decisions that cost him his life and his love.  My point?  I don't have my father's heart.  I don't have my stepmother's.  I don't know how to love a man without hating some part of him because it feels good, because it gives me leverage . . . or rather I didn't before I met Matt.  That's why I never even kissed Joey, by the way, Matt.  So I had something he wanted.)  Blogs are made for the truth, Mattie said, and she said let's face it, the truth hurts.  Well the truth didn't have to take my eyes and my ears and my taste and my feeling . . . all it left me was my sense of smell, which I use to find food and determine the feelings of others, like a bitter shewolf.  (Love my analogy, been waiting to use that one.)  I tell the world this because I dont want people to waste their time caring, as I have.  That's one thing my granmother is trying to teach me, she doesn't know she long ago suceeded.  I will wirte more later, I will be bored.  oh, and Mattie, I WATCHED A REALLY GOOD MOVIE TODAY, wink wink, and it was definately not the one I borrowed from Fred!!  LOL!!

      "But I just shrug it off and try to laugh when they are being funny,but inside its cold and dark...and everything said to me comes out like the charlie brown teacher(ya know--wah wah wah -)**sorry, I watched peanuts when I was younger,and I am sad to say it has stuck with me *****...I pretend to listen and be focused but nothing tends to catch my attention...Not unless I close off my thoughts,but that only last a second....." I took this from Mattie's blog and I'm using it as my explantion for the below statements.  Matt . . . I love you honey.

      I'm talking to Matt now and I think sometimes I could kill him.  Earlier I asked him if he was coming to my house after my granma got home and he said, "probably, probably, probably . . ." and I think I said something like, "you don't have to if you don't want to" and he was like, "ooookay" like he does that makes me feel like a child and so small and stupid.  So when my granma gets home I call him to tell him I am going grocery shopping, and I call Mattie, and then I go . . . and when I come home and call him so he can come over, he says he's not going to.  NOT GOING TO????  Why on God's green earth not?  Geezum!  And it wasn't a flat out no, it was an I don't know.  I hate those.  What the hell is up with that?  What do you say to that?  So I got angry, like I always do for no good reason other than the fact that I like to get angry and matt gives me nothing substantial to get angry about.  And I had to tell him I was getting off to eat so I could off the telephone and SCREAM.  But when I called him back I was fine, and I am fine.  But I get so mad because he just doesn't get it sometimes.  I AM A HURT AND DEPRESSED PERSON WHO IS JUST NOW FINDING THE LIGHT!!  There are lines you cant cross with me, things you can't do.  I am not normal.  I'm not like a normal human being, I'm not okay with the things that normal human beings are okay with, I can't deal with things on a normal level.  He just told me I shouldn't tell the world about what happened tonight, I sort of dared him to object and he gave me an unreadable grumble.  I hate those, they piss me off.  I wake up quick just like I want to/yeah but I stay out much too late . . . -Matchbox20.  A song called Better Than Nothing, I believe.  You've got to think with a girl like that it's better than nothing.  That's what he says, why that fit right there so well I don't know, it just crept into my head.  And Mattie, if you call yourself boring no one is going to think you interesting besides me.  Matt, if you don't get yourself together and accept that sometimes I do think you are an asshole, and it's okay for you to think I'm a bitch, then I don't know what I am going to do with you . . . God - everyone has off moments!!!!

      I hadn't finished reading Mattie's blog when I spoke to her today.  She talked about Fred holding her, and I cried.  Isn't it the sweetest thing in the world to sleep in your love's arms?  That's why I hate Matt not being able to do it.  He doesn't know how, because he's still getting over his horndog state that I snapped him out of.  That night I stayed at his house he didn't even hold me all night . . . he kept getting up, or waking me up, or moving.  That night was the most wonderful night I have ever had, because I got to spend part of it in his arms.  (Read Mattie's blog, it's my first Fav Link.)  Matt in my bed is my singlemost favorite thing in the world. I cannot describe what it is like to know that he's next to you if you don't know already (by that I mean your man).  Sleeping next to somebody has to be the sweeetest thing, but the problem is I hate sleeping by myself now.  I hate the way my bed seems so big, and the way me and Matt argued over who's side was who's that night, because we both sleep on the same side.  We were all tangled up on each other the other day on the couch and we both fell alseep.  And I told him I hope that's how we always sleep . . . all tangled up.  He smiled at me. He has the most beautiful imperfect smile in the world. I can't talk about this anymore, it kind of hurts now that I think about it.  He doesn't know how to STAY, even when it's me . . .ME . . . me . . . .

      Mattie said she got on last night and started a blog and wouldn't you know it?  She couldn't stop writing. (typing, whatever.) In reply to her, I write, "HI MATTIE!!"  Yes, we're strange.  Did you know that I am partial to muddy daisies??  Geezum, I forget how that even started.  One night me and Mattie were on the phone and out of nowhere she says something about a fat kid running over the pretty daisies on his bigwheeel (I still don't know where that came from, so don't ask) and I said something like, "well thats okay, I'm kind of partial to muddy daisies.  I think if Mattie doesn't stop being so happy I might call her Daisy . . . Ho kinda got old, even though it was a funny joke . . . (she's gone plural!!) is that okay Mattie?  If I call you Daisy?  Maybe just in the blog?  Or is it too happy for ya?  Well I call Matt Pokey, you know like the red horse from Gumby . . . yes, he hates it, did you have to ask?  I also call him Punkin Nose, I think that gets on EVERYBODY'S  nerves (but mine). You know how in She's All That Laney gets out of the car and her father always calls her pumpkin nose?  Well I thought t was cute and shortened it to punkin nose.  I already call Gabrielle Pumpkin Head for her red hair . . . I'm about to go to the grocery store, my granma decided to put her feet up before we went.  I'm listening to the J. Geils band . . . More Than A Feeling . . . something about the guitar break in that song just gets me all over!  I just smile . . .and smile.  You know it's a great song when it makes you feel that good.  Whew!  Now I'm listening to Hot Blooded . . . why don't they maek music like this anymore?  You ever hear 70's and 80's music and want to DANCE??  I just get the beat in me and . . . okay I'm going to stop about that.  I just noticed that no music from nowadays gets me all happy like old music does.  My granma will be very happy to know about that one I guess. She'll say, "I told you so!!"  I told Mattie how last night all the stuff I had written last night that I lost was bad things about Fred, so I took it as a sign that I was unable to post it.  I find it strange.  What I had said yesterday was mostly that I had seen David Micheal Luci at the Blockbuster, and it had been so long, and I had missed him so much, it was good to talk to him.  I had borroweed Not Another Teen Movie from Fred and since I did I had to take it back.  he hadn't gotten it from the normal one on Merrill, so I had to journey to the one on Lonestar and University (which it is, by the way, closing on Sunday).  Because it is closing David will be transferred to the one on Merrill which is good for because I might get to see him frequently now!  It was a good day.  An off day, but a good day.  Matt was in a very good mood, like bouncing off the walls good, so I was happy.  Today he was shitty.  Ask Mattie.  And he has forgotten how to stay in bed.  I hate that.  More after I go to the grocery!  KEEP ON ROCKIN ME BAYBY!!!

      I was so pissed last night, I spent a long time analyzing some Fred and Mattie-isms and I lost all of it because of a problem with my page.  I had a Bob moment and was like, "yep, the computer is going to end up on the lawn."  Bob is Jason's friend that hates the TV at Mom's house because its digital and fucks up all the time, and when he is watching he always says, "yep, if this thing were at my house it would be thrown out on the lawn by now".  I think Bob is highly entertaining, I have gotten way to used to chillin with people a decade older than me. It's not a healthy thing for a 15 year old, you know.  I know that I am wise beyond my years, but I got ranked on by my parents for so long to be a normal kid that now it seems like I'm jumping a little TOO  far ahead in the age game.  How is one supposed to feel though I ask?  Privelaged??

      I wouldn't go to the clubhouse luau with my granma (free marguiritas for those of you that are of age) and she says, "well what did you do online that upset you?"  I made a mistake telling her about the blog.  I get in my moods, ask Mattie, or Fred, or Matt.  Shit, I forgot to call Hoss back.  He's back in town by the way.  Nothing like Hoss when I need a good cheering up.  And I am used to having Hoss even Joey out, because they both talk about eachother (Joey not near as bad as Hoss) and I'm in the middle, but Hoss has been out fo town . . . or somewhere, God, I don't pay enough attention.  My stepmother had lunch with my granma yesterday and said to tell me hello.  I don't know what's wrong with her, but okay.  I can't beleive I forgot to call Hoss, I am a horrible friend.  Geezum.  Mattie told me that she thought she wrote too much on her first entry for her blog, *Mattie, look how much I write in a day!!*  I want to give a shout out to Eleni, a very interesting charachter who mailed me about my site, told me it was cool . . . I'm working on my layout because I'm not happy with it yet, but yes, I think the site is coming along very nicely!  And I like hers, check it out, its http://endtask.dot.nu - I thought it was a good site . . .I guess I'm going to go, call Hoss and I have to call Matt in half an hour.  The pains of love . . . call my name . . .

      I told Matt last night how I felt about him being in my bed . . . I am going to quit writing about Fred because it seems like somebody upstairs (i.e., God) doesn't want me to post it.  I have tried four times now, two that I have written about.  I made him stay in the bed today and I said, "how can you not love this??"  And he smiled at me, like he always does, and he told me that he did . . .he does . . .it's just hard . . . and it was a beautiful moment.   You tell me summer's here and the time is wrong You tell me winter's here  And your days are getting long Tears are in your eyes Tonight You tell me that you haven't slept in days You tell me sleeping only makes your tired anyway Tears are in your eyes Tonight Tears are in your eyes Every night Although you don't beleive me, you are strong Darkness always turns into the dawn And you won't even remember this for long When it ends alright Please tell me how you know tomorrow staring at your shoes Tears are in your eyes Every night Tears are in your eyes Every night Tears are in your eyes Tonight Yo La Tengo - Tears Are In Your Eyes That just seemed like a good place for that.  I'm going to write to Mattie about the rest of my day, I know people who read this that probably don't want to know about it so I'll have her post it on her site and you can go read it if you so choose.

      TO MATTIE - Girl, you have got to be kidding me.  Daisy, honey, you know *most* of my past and you know who I am now, and you know that my attitude is very . . . "FUCK OFF!!"-ish.  How could you think that I'm just trying to be nice to you?  How could you think me that fake?  You are the only person that has ever been able to be close to me (in the way we are close) EVER, and you have to know that I wouldn't tell ya you are "da shit" in my book if I didn't mean it!  (That is the highest compliment coming from me, by the way.)  You remember how that started?  You said that for one day, just one day, you wanted to be the shit to somebody.  So all that day and I think the next I told you you were the shit, hun.  Because I beleive that, and I am not only trying to make up for the pain other have caused you, and  have caused you, and Fred has caused you, but I beleive in you, and I'm proud of who you are . . . and I love ya, girl . . . I want to have just a little bt of the strength on my own that you have given me, because no one indirectly tells me to "suck it up" as well as you do.  Nobody tells me that I'm not hopeless and I can go on quite like you do.  Because YOU GET IT.  And that is something I don't fuck around with/or about.

      I'm sorry I put your link on my page, Mattie, Matt doesn't read the blog (thank God, he'd be pissed after last night.  SOMETHING I WROTE LATE LAST NIGHT -   I just talked to Joey.  It's funny to me how I always come across him when Matt pisses me off.  He read the blog, and I cried (so I'm crying a lot today, big deal) when I saw what he had to say . . . "so you like to be held? I always held you."  Joey did always hold me.  We always say/it would be good to go away someday/but there was nothing there to make things change/if it's the same for you I just won't/ -Matchbox 20.  And I just told Matt what he said, and the problem with Matt is he hides reactions well, especially on the phone.  THEN SHE LOOKED AT ME WITH THOSE BIG BROWN EYES AND SAID YOU AIN'T SEEN NOTHIN YET!  BBBBBBABY YOU JUST AIN'T SEE NNNNOTHIN YET!!!!!  I shouldn't be able to be so happy about making someone angry, but Matt hates Joey right about now.  And I am happy that he's seeing red right now.  I'm seein red/don't think you'll have to see my face again/don't have much time for sympathy/but it never happened to me/you're feelin blue now/I thinkyou bit off more than you could chew/and now it's time to make a choice, and all I want to hear is your voice -Unwritten Law  You can't be straight up with people anymore.  I told Matt I still have feelings for Joey and that Joey still has feelings for me and the boy is so afraid now that I'll go fuck Joey while he's gone.  Can't trust a sister!  It took Chip telling me that even though I wasn't available that it was okay that Joey and me still had feelings.  Geezum, and he was right.  It's simple, why is Matt making it so complicated?  I love him, I tell him this about ten million times a day, and he does ditto . . . so he needs to just calm the fuck down.  I want to go to Warped Tour this year, but I don't know if I will be able to.  Rob Zombie is going to be here the day after I leave town, which majorly blows.  Then I am missing the premier of Goldmember because I am going out of town.  Which means I can't go with the huge group of people that are going over at Matt's house.  Actually, you know what?  Last time I went out of town it killed me being away from Matt.  But this time I am thinking I need to get away from him for a while.  See what it's like to think about things besides him.  I say this because I think that's what he wants me to do.  I feel bad because I feel like I smother him, so if he wants it I am going to give the boy his space.  Make muchos sense?  I'm out of line . . . I know, but I'm in a bad mood so I can be.   ANYWAY - thought it was fair to post it even thought that was so 5 minutes ago. I'm going to post this and then write more.

      Geezum, it has been a while since I last posted, forgive me (ahem, MATTIE!).  A lot of shit has gone down, and I haven't been comfortable not being honest . . . because Mattie says that blogs are for the truth, and the truth hurts.  Well yes it does, but why give it to the world when you aren't even sure if that's how you feel yet?  You see, people like me write without thinking . . . and thinking is good . . .

      Today he says I love you and it's like, whoa!  Really??  Because Matt had the biotch thing going today.  I had a journalism meeting at noon at school for next year, and we all had free Subway, and Matt drove me because Gaga was at work.  He said he was having a good day until he went into Dana and Jason's bedroom to play video games and I came in . . . he started a new game without asking me if I wanted to play too . . . and I said, "no, I don't want to play, it's okay," and he said, "your ass can wait".  He said it with this tone, though, like he was serious or something, and I know he saw the look on my face that told him that I took him seriously, and he didn't say anything.  I was sooo pissed, I was like what the hell?  So I sat there for a second, and then I got up to go watch tv with Tabitha in th eliving room.  When I got up, I heard him say, "where are you going?" and he says he said "get back in here!" but I didn't hear that . . . I didn't know he wanted me back in there so I didn't go for the longest time.  On a commercial break (we had ben watching Wannabes: Mandy Moore) I went back in the room and there's Matt, playing the Doors way up loud . . . and he didn' turn them down when I came in, and he let me climb up on him and kiss him and then he gently pushed me away, turned off the stereo and the Playstation 2 . . .and left.  He sat in my chair in the living room, the chair that we slept in when I spent the night at his house, and I came in and sat with him . . . and he wouldn't look at me.  He said this girl on tv, one of the Mandys was hot, and I got angry.  He told me I was hurting him so I had to move, and I got up and sat on the couch . . . anyway, he called me when he got home from bringing me home and said that yes, he was pissed at me, and told me that it was because I left him twice, and I was rude.  BULLSHIT.  Guys are so weird, I only left because he pissed me off - several times before I just walked away.  And I didn't go far.  Pisses me the fuck off, why does he have to be so weird??  I seriously needed some Apple Pucker right about then . . . the Banana flavored Joaquin is nasty by the way . . . the others just taste like Jolly Ranchers, and they warm your entire body starting in your throat . . . maybe it's because there aren't any banana Jolly Ranchers . . . I think me and Matt made up, at any rate, how the hell should I know?

      I wonder if people really mean what they say . .  . Matt told me he loved me about a zillion times today without being prompted, and he told me i was sexy and beautiful and it's just a wonder to me that despite the millions of whores on this planet that might actually give him head the weirdo found the love of his life and settled down.  How does one go about doing this?  Why?  I can't beleive I finally found someone who is just as obssessed about me as I am about them.  Joe's one truth.  You know what we did today?  Went and got the Avril Lavigne cd and a mag with Vin Diesel (his real name is Mark Vincent) on the cover for me.  He got the Beastie Boys, he wasn't totally neglected, but it was fun and very sweet.  I like Vin, next to my man he is the sexiest beast one Earth.  I hope he sees that one day too, even though I know he already knows he is.  His parents must be so proud, lol.  I wouldn't be, I expect my kids to be incredible, and even if they aren't to you, they will be to me.  Tomorrow my granma has an all day meeting, so she has to go to bed, and I want to talk to her before she decides to, so you must pardon me.  Hope alls well.  Be good yall, peace.

      I find it very hard to be real.  Mattie brought this point, of being fake, up in her blog on Friday, and it made me think.  Why be real?  Why let anyone know that they have a power of you, and put yourself out there?  I do it for love.  I love Matt, and Mattie, they have never let me down.  Though I will never expect anything from anyone ever again, besides Matt, I do love them both, and I always have and always will embrace every detail about them.  Mattie, even though I didn't know how to show it when I was fighting for Fred, I still loved you, that day you came up to me and told me you loved my sweater . . . I beleive it was the blue one, was it not?  I am real, and honest, because truth can fuck everything up, but justifyingly so.  If you break someone on account of the truth, then there will always be a good reason, and an excuse, a justification, on why that person was broken.  Fred broke me.  Three times, and the last time he wasn't going to come back and (even indirectly) make it better.  He is ont his earth to love Mattie, and hold her and understand her, and be hers, and he can never, and will never be anything to me.  I'm not worth it to him.  And that, my friends, is the way it should be, and though Matt isn't fine with it, I am (now). More later, gma needs to use the phone.

      Why does the dean give you detention and then not make you serve it?  I was ready for that AC and hour of writing notes to Mattie and Matt.  Geezum, it sucks.  I spent yesterday looking through pictures with Dana at Matt's house, she gave me a lot.  And we cleaned her room (usually Jason does it, but we were home, so!) Matt had an eye exam at 10:30 and work at 11, but I didn't do nuthin but stay with Dana until 5:30 or so.  Matt gets off at 6, but I couldn't wait for him to get home, I didn't feel like it.  I got to talk to Alecia some though, and it's been a while since I have done that.  I showed my dad my grades (finally).  Kira spent the nite last week and James stayed at Matt's and we all partied on Friday and Saturday . . . I got my blood taken, it was cool.  I was so scared, and I took 5 people with me, but it was fun.  Adrenaline rush!  For nothing but still.  GIVE BLOOD!

      Don't look at the screen like that, I know it's been a long time since I wrote but who reads this shit anyway?  I doubt Mattie even really does anymore, and the point is to be honest and be heard, like the chick at littlefrenchgirl.org is!!!!  But nooooooo, it never works like that for Sharon.  Geezum.  Well I did some stupid things and now I can't see the love of my life for 30 days . . . well it was supposed to be thirty, and we have made it through 23, but my dad changed it since I continued doing stupid things.  I'm not sure I am ready to discuss Matt and his family and DDC with anyone yet, but since no one reads this I guess it'll be okay, I need to get the fear out.  I didn't tell Mattie the whole story, but she doesn't know that (she will now) and I don't feel like putting it all here so you get the condensed version.  Basically, my parents let me go and stay at Matt's house because they didn't beleive that his family would be down with that (they were, they thought it was great, or at least Dana and Gabrielle did).  So I stayed for two days, which was longer than planned, and my parents called the Po.  Yes, the police.  My parents.  Well I guess I shouldn't be shocked, that's the way those dicks are.  And it's hard to admit they were doing me a huge favor, but they were - nothing would have ever changed if I hadn't spent that night on that top bunk that smelled . . . like dirty disenfectant.  People are dirty, runaways are dirty, battered people are dirty, and homeless people are REALLY dirty, and I had to sleep in the same bed as these people had, and if it hadn't have smelled bad or been so fucking cold in there I would have been fine. The YCC people didn't come get me and this other chick (was her name Jennifer??) until 4 a.m. and then we didn't get food or to sleep until 530, and then they don't wake you, so you have to get up all by yourself and go and find these people (dude, they like, hide from you in this room with one plastic window you have to talk through and all these video cameras and stuff).  And the room they made us wait in at DDC was so cold and so small, I almost ralphed so many times, and I kept hyperventilating and they kept making me breathe into a bag so I would stop crying and could breathe normaly again (I'm sure they thought I had asthma or something).  What I wouldn't give to have none of that ever having to happen.  It's a scary place, just thinking about living there kills me.  Makes me so sad.  I couldn't have Matt, or Mattie, no one but my family and I don't want them.  Except for Gaga and my mother and the girls.  Well I guess I had better go, I am making myself depressed talking about it and I haven't had any of my medicine today.  I miss my baby, and I miss my baby's family.  I hate this, and Dad, for now, I hate you.  You had a reason to take him away fro 30 days, you DO NOT have a reason to do it for longer.  Fuck OFF.

      Mattie requested my online time be put to good creative use so here I am, yet another night, without my baby typing to . . . well . . . Mattie.  For the amusement of . . . Mattie.  So . . . howdy Mattie.  She came over to my house today, it was great, I called Dylan too but he wasn't home (says he never is on the weekends).  Mattie and Kathy and I went swimming and did our laundry and listened to music and smoked . . . and it was really nice, I miss Mattie.  YOU ARE NOT A LOSER IF TP SCREWS YOU OVER!!!  Just needed to make a sistah feel bettah (you know me, Daisy girl).  Mattie had to go home to her uncle and to dinner, and I came inside to my sister folding her thongs and dance leotards and booty shorts and my gma's grilled cheese. Isn't it great?  I think so.  (Yes, my sister wears thongs.)  I also found out that Jessi's favorite store is Victoria Secret, which is disturbing because she is 13 and that's just wrong.  But if she can afford the "Angel Collection" who am I to judge??  Okay, I love you Mattie, and I know it's only quarter to eight, but I am exhausted!!  I miss Matt.  I love Matt.  Always.  I'm gonna go cry now, good night all . . . I mean MATTIE - lol.

      My boyfriend is not a loser, thank you very much.  I am not going tot alk about who thinks that but it made me very mad today, I got pissed.  Sara Ball (BIG HAIRY BALLS IN YOUR MOUTH) is taking me to Brian's next party and Matt is going too, and we gonna boogey down (I use those words to fool my granma, yall!)  It will be fun, I can get all messed up and no one will care.  Besides Matt, and he won't drink if I'm there, he'll take care of me, he knows I'm not responsible.  I like to think that Colin and Josh might have their eye on me too, but Colin is a jackass and Josh gets trashed and pees on the fence and you just can't stop him from doing his shit.  I need tot ake Mattie, she needs to get completely wasted and she'll have a whole new outlook on things after she has been for the first time in a long time.  Maybe not Mattie; maybe just Kim and Fred.  And then Kim needs to get laid.  Oh well, Mattie reads this so I'm not talkin bad about your wodies, girl, I'm just messin.  Matt sent me this email and it said "wow!" and I wrote back and I was like "what?" and he wrote and goes, "you think you're getting trashed!"  But oh well, then he needs to stay home and let good little christian Brian take care of me.  I am starting to think I should not put my name on these things.  My parents would be like ohmigod.  Snivelage!!!  SNIVELAGE!  Snivelage on my behalf.  Oh well, crontz.  (That's Melissa Pankhurst's word, I just steal it on good days.)  This is killin me, I really need to do math homework and I don't want to.  I mean I really don't.  It's feeling really nice to blog again.

      I still find it quite amazing to see things that I wrote there on a page where everyone can read them and go "HELL yeah!" not that anybody does except for Mattie.  Matt . . . is driving me crazy.  Today Brigitte told me I should ask him if he still wants to be with me (I told her about him blowing me off on the phone all the time), so I did, and he said yes . . . and he said he still wants to marry me and he still loves me and blah blah blah . . . but he also sounded really tired, and I hate it when he does that.  And he didn' t tell Mom to call me yet.  Says he forgot.  He just forgot.  And yes, I believe him, I listen to Matt because I am in love with him and I would jump off a bridge if he asked me to (I say that because he would NEVER ask me to jump off of a bridge).  Matt is the second most beautiful person I have ever met (the first being Mattie) and I don't know how I could be me without him.  Right now . . . at least I know he's still mine, right??  He's my baby, and my love, and he isn't giving peices of himself to anyone else while I can't be around.  The 11th we have off from school, and he wants to get that day off so he can come be with me all day.  Would that not be the most wonderful thing in the wide world?  I wonder why Eleni hasn't blogged.  She used to talk to me a lot.  And I read her shit to get ideas when I first started.  I'm not going to Brian's party because Matt won't let me.  He says I can if I want and that means "baby, don't go or I'll be really mad!"  So I'm not, and I'm bummed - but oh well.  It's for my own good.  I guess I will get off so I can do my LAM homework, and so Mattie can call after a while.  Peace!!!

      Sorry about all that Mattie, I was just being kinda mean . . . and if Kim is getting laid then why can't you tell Kim you're getting laid?  Or have you already?  How come I'm not caught up on shit like that?  Well I'm not going to Brian's but I am going to Jessica Lambert's party with Sara this weekend . . . she invited me so I will go.  I haven't talked to my love today which makes me mad, I guess maybe he is working until 630, that's only ten minutes away.  Good.  I had tutoring today after skool for the great and wonderful American Government . . . and I convinced these black guys (my "cousins") that Gabrielle was my daughter which was really funny.  They were like, how old are you?  And I was all like, 17!  And they were like, oh, ok.  And she'll be 3 when?  I was ike, "yall don't really think I have a baby girl, do you?"  Yeah, isn't that nice?  Again, Mattie, I was just messin about your friends . . .and about the sick reality . . . coming back off of or down from any high (or just being drunk in this case) is a sick reality, because no fine person with a wonderful life puts any substance into their body.  The problem comes when you use it as a tool to get away from your sick reality that you created.  I don't anymore, I drink because I see Josh and Colin do it and I want to play with the big kids. I feel like I'm being left out of something if I don't.  And it makes Matt mad.  He asked me why it seems like all we do is fight lately, and I said I don't know, that I don't want to.  He better get Friday off, the 11th, or I will be really sad - he needs to fix what I broke a long time ago.  And it's sad because I am counting on him to fix me, and he keeps letting me down.  He takes me as a whim; like I don't need him to come see me - but I do, I need to feel him and make sure he's stillr eal, and it breaks my heart that a lot of the time he's too busy to pick up the phone (that may or may not be his fault).  When it comes down to it, my worst fears were confirmed: I cannot live a normal life, and I cannot be genuinely happy without Matthew Patrick Alexander.  And that terrifies the shit out of me, but God, I want him so bad, every second of every day, and I am so surprised I lasted this long.  But I couldn't make it to tomorrow without knowing he was still mine, all mine.  He better not break my heart.  I don't have a replacement this time, I'm not fixable anymore, this is it, last chance on love, I have already in 15 years wasted too much of my heart.  That's sad.  That's the part of me that's happy Mattie: the part of me that knows one day me and Matt will be together all the time and have a wonderful life and nothign can matter but the family we build (if we so choose), but the part of me that's so miserable is the part of that knows that I have to wait at least two years to get there.  That I have to deal with my fucked up family for at least two more years.  And now I have to go because I'm crying and I can't see the computer screen very well.  Matt, I know you don't read this but I love you honey.

      So what is that??  If Mattie is getting laid then Kim can too?  What the fuck?  Okay, well that's why she backed off babe!  My granma is all like, "I have to talk to your father about this Matt shit, it's been too long!"  and I was like "FUCK YEAH!!"  I am so happy, she'll work it out so I can see him and I will be so . . . happy, remember Mattie?  Ok, I have to go infortuantely, Hi Tyler . . . no HA HA'S ok?  It's not funny when I'm lonely!

      I doubt my good buddy Tyler will come to the site but if he does - I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW YOU SUCK (I know you had fun today, and my day was lame).  Right now I'm trying to find out what Matt is up to (he mailed me at six and I was in the shower).  He isn't responding (what's new?)  So I get to sit here and talk to myself, and to Mattie.  Maybe Tyler.  God, I seem so boring and lonely today - guys, I HAVE friends.  I just like it when it's just me and Matt that I have to deal with, to answer to, and so I blow people off because every time I try to do anyting anymore I get blown off.  Like this weekend I was supposed to go to Sara's house and she is wroking and doing homework and we might go out tomorrow afternoon but that's it.  I like screwing other people up rather then letting them tell me to fuck off (inadvertently).  I used to wish that somebody close to me would die so I would have a reason to be so angry and so withdrawn . . . and then two of my best friends in the world died in my arms, and I didn't tell anyone about it.  I just cried silent tears when I got the chance to, all alone in my room, all by myself in the world.  And what would I say if they were still here?  Go to hell, and go now, so I can have a real reason to cry.  A reason besides MY LIFE SUCKS because at that time I didn't know that it wasn't okay for my dad to hit me and or my mom to ignore me.  I just didn't.  I thought I was just . . . and then the doctors told me that I had manic depression, and a panic disorder, and I'm obssessive compulsive, I was so releived.  THOUGH MOST PEOPLE THINK THIS IS REALLY COMMON SO THEY SAY WHO CARES, it made me feel damn good to know that somebody recognized that what you could see of me was an empty shell, and that that shell wasn't real.  Do you know what the first thing people see is when they walk into a crowded room with me in it?  Me.  I'm so loud, and tall, and people say I have "magnetic energy" (thank you Paul) that people are drawn to me.  Only that seems to only be a select few people lately, because the people I've only known this year - I think I freak them out a little bit.  Matt is such an asshole.  God I just want to be mad at him so badly. I just want him, can't he understand that?  I want him.  I'm lonely, and he's mine, and he won't just . . .what the fuck I am so going to bed I am not making any sense.  I cannot go to church in the morning, I'm too fucking cynical for that.  Who needs God when you have the whole fucking world planning out your life for you?  I would like to say I do, and not that my faith is gone, but what the hell do I think I'm getting at?  I'm trying so hard to cry and I can't.  It's just that angry knot in my throat that makes me feel pathetic and no tears to releive the pain.  Okay, Dylan just got on, he'll save me . . .

She called me late last night To say she loved me, so..? But I guess he changed her mind. Well I should have known it wouldn't be all right But I can't live without her So I won't even try... Maybe some day, I'll think of what to say. Maybe next time I'll remember what to do, She looks like heaven, maybe this is hell, Said she'd do it all again She'd promise not to tell! If I get drunk well, I'll pass out on the floor now baby You won't bother me no more (and she said) It's OK boy cause You know we'll be good friends and I say I think I'll have myself a beer.

      What do I get from anyone, ever?  Jesus Christ (sign of cross, my apologies) . . . for once, can someone just not be lying when they say they love me, and then can they not be so complicated??  People are so damn complicated.  Like Matt, for instance, or Dylan, or Lee . . . they all, well, you get the feeling that even though they're already awesome that you haven't seen anything yet, you know?  And that's a good thing, until . . . well, it's your boyfriend that has that air of mystery.  What does the damn air of mystery mean??  Does he have another girl?  I mean, I know he doesn't, let's face it - Matt couldn't pimp anymore if he tried - but the thoguht is there.  I trust him.  I have to tell myslef that all the time.  Did you know that pickles stick to the wall at McDonald's really well?  They do.  And watching guys chip eachothers' teeth ("find it so I can tape that shit back in!") and mooning cameras ("you know the security guy is having a feild day with my ass, right?") is the best.  Until Ben gets all up in the Kool-Aid ("just get out of the van, right now, I'm not playing").  Ben is gay.  He just is, he likes cock (Brigitte, would it be better to say KOK!!) which is sad because even though he looks like he washed his face with this mornings' leftover bacon grease he's still the same old Ben that I've been chillin with since 6th grade (well, I just kind of seem to adopt his posse).  Dylan, you know you guys are the best right?  (Even if Daniel thinks I'm too freaky for him.)  And Tyler needs to get his ass online when a sistah is on, because I get lonely when Dylan has better things to do than talk to me (lol, like he's my only friend in the world!  Ahem, no.)  I am so sad; I come home and play the same music every day, (U2's "In A Little While", Hootie and the Blowfish's "Let Her Cry", Sublime's "What I Got" etc etc etc).  How eery is that?  Who does that? Oh and Tyler - about Nicole's party sucking ass - ha . . . . HA . . . HA . . . .HAAAAAAAAAAAA!  (Ooh, got 'em.) About the complicated thing . . .ask Avril cuz I don't feel like filling you in on these damn Sk8r Bois.

      I knew that this would happen if I was honest.  God, why is Mattie always right?  The truth hurts.  It sucks, it eats, it blows . . . Matt broke up with me.  He broke up with me.  Why?  I told him I had a slight attraction to Daniel Hodges and that the guy blew me off (analytically) and made me see how much I really do love and need Matt, and only Matt.  Did he see the whole situation?  Hell no.  He saw me cheating on him.  Okay, a couple of guys touched my boobs, but they were covered, and a girl who's not getting any that publicizes it is gonna at elast get put on once in a blue moon.  And I told him.  Why?  ****.  **** told me to tell Matt how I felt and just keep telling him once I was confronted, and it was **** that first told me to be honest with him.  Dana had only this to say: "That's just Matt, that's the way he is."  They (Jason, Dana, and Matt) went to Bob's last night for a while and Dana said Matt didn't say a damn word about us.  My first thought was, "when were you gonna tell everyone?".  Or was he just trying to upset me, or just take a break?  Okay, this guy **** has ignored me when I instant messaged him today (there could be a reason for that) but I want to sleep with him.  Let me put that right out there.  And he has let me beleive that he wants to be "friends with benefits" . . . but he hasn't talked to me today, and that is really messing me up.  I just want . . . what did John say . . . a friend.  John also said if he could he would drive to me and let me cry on him, but he has no gas money.  He lives in Alabama.  I don't know what to do without Matt, I just don't.  I'm sick right now too, and so I'm groggy and stuff and I didn't need this at all.  Matt tried to make me promise I wouldn't hurt myself, but I didn't, because he didn't promise what I asked him to promise.  I asked him to promise that he'll come back to me one day and at least consider being my husband and he said, "I'll think about it".  I'm not sure what I'm supposed to be feeling, last night was easy because I replaced Matt with **** and it worked but now I haven't talked to **** and I sound like a frantic desperate idiot so I am going to stop now.  If I ever gave him this web addie he'd figure out who **** is and think I'm completely strange.  I wish Matt would come back, I miss him.  I love him too, even though I am so mad at him right now.  John told me to kick some ass;  I'm starting to think this could come to that.  And I am not a hoe, Matthew.

      I went to Triple Plays last night with Brigitte and Rich, and they introduced me to this guy Danny, who just happens to be 20 (which is just lovely).  He isn't fine, and he's kinda big, but he was just an awesome guy.  He held my hand all the way back from Campeche Bay (none of Rich's friends were there so we left) and he drove me home because Brigitte didn't feel like driving and he kissed my hand when I got out of the truck.  (He has a green Tacoma if I remember correctly).  It was the cutest thing, Matt wasn't ever that sweet.  In fact, Matt is never sweet.  He's just not.  Anything nice he says about me has to do with sex, which is fine for a while, but not when that's all he says.  He doesn't know a thing about sweeping a girl off of her feet.  Danny strikes me as one who would know exactly how; but so does **** and I'm still waiting to see how that comes out.  And if John comes down here at the end of the year, he could change a lot, I think.  I don't know what to do, I actually have quite a few guys who want to be with me and there is nothing wrong with any of them.  As long as I keep going out with Brigitte, and talking to Danny, and as long as Danny knows that he has to go slow because I'm hurt . . . if I'm not getting Matt back I have to do something.  Wicker was there last night, he walked in with another sweet-faced staff sargeant, a chick Marine reservist ("tell her about being in the Marines," "it's BADASS!") and two other girls that are Marines but getting transfers to the Army soon.  I made my decision last night, too, about being in the military.  I want to be a Marine.  I do, I want to be better than Matt.  I want to be better than Dad.   And I want to kick some ass.  I want to learn discipline, and I'm sick of being WEAK in the mind and the body so here is my chance.  Wicker is leaving in 60 days, but he told me that when I turn 18 he will travel back to me and go see the recruiter with me.  It was Wicker, that made me want to do this . . . "so I thought you didn't want me in your Marine Core . . . "  "Well, I thought you were gonna be part of the family in another way."  He used to tell me I couldn't be a Marine, and that sparked something in me.  Matt asked me not to do it, for his sake, and I said okay . . . but now things are a whole lot different.  Now I have no one to stay here for and I plan on keeping it that way. I am going to marry the Marines for a while.  And that sounds so good right now.  The pain raging through my head and my neck and my back and my whole body . . . damn I can't wait.  Whew.  I really can't.  The sweet-faced guy who can't play pool is the one who gave me the beer.  It was for Wicker, and Wicker said "I don't drink beer . . . and I'm not drinkin tonite."  And he looked at me and winked and handed it to me, and I suavely poured the AmberBock into my Coke glass that had been almost empty, but I didn't get anywhere close to finishing it before we left for Campeche Bay.  This guy, Greg, bummed cigarettes off of me all night.  He was the bartender.  Danny spilled a beer all over me by accident.  I was mad because it only hit me, Rich had gone to the bathroom.  Rich hugged me and kissed my neck before I left.  It was really sweet, and Wicker talked to me for at least an hour.  I told him to ask Matt for my number so we can go work out.  LOL!!

They kicked me out because I'm too young and with they're drug users and I can get them in a lot of trouble!  I can't even write yet . . . damn . . .

      God I just hate people so much!  I got dumped last night.  Me and Matt got back together and then he dumped me again last night.  He said it didn't feel right anymore.  What's that shit all about?  Who the fuck says that?  How am I supposed to feel about that?  I'm so in love with him.  I didn't want to be, and I tried not to be, and I got really good at pretending I didn't, and then other guys came along and . . . nothing.  All for him.  and then he dissapeared for a week and a half and I call him and he breaks up with me.  That fat bastard,  that's what Sara said.  Sara Ball, who knows him and loves moi.  And I don't know what to . . . I don't want to break.  I haven't cried.  What do I have to say?  Two things:  Jesus can't mend a broken heart unless you give him all the peices, and YOU BETTER LOSE YOURSELF.  Yall Eminem fans know what I'm saying.  If you don't ask me, or ask one.  I still don't feel like explaining that weekend yet.  It's too hard.  I feel like a pit bull . . . you can raise us so well and so lovingly, and yet at a certain age a chemical in our brains planted from our bloodlines screws us all up and makes us lash out at people.  It kills most of us pits, or puts us in cages.  And when people like me get mad or upset, we get to be just like animals  . . . no sense of the blows that are coming right between the eyes, just pain, shear pain . . . and it beats in your head louder and louder . . . and then you break and fall asleep.

      WELL!  I went out with Zac and Charlie last night.  They taught me to play pool (yippee!) and I was good, better than Kathlyn.  It's a feeling of satisfaction to take the first hit and break 8 balls, sending two into the holes and picking up your stick that you just hit Zac with by accident then dropped to take your second hit.  Being with Charlie made me think of Fred, and there were weird things that reminded me of him all night.  Like we went to McDonald's like me and Fred used to, sat at the table we used to, ordered the same things we used to.  Large #2's with Coke . . . they sat and talked to my granma, she wasn't that embarassing when he was around, let me tell you!  I think me and Zac are going to hook up.  Me and Charlie were supposed to go out today but me and Gaga decided I should not put myself in that position should Kathlyn find out we were together.  Kathlyn dumped Charlie two a couple of weeks ago.  (Yeah I know, I was just as shocked, I cried with Charlie and I hate her for it).  Just like I hate Matt for what he did to me.  But I always knew he wasn't the one.  He isn't tall enough.  But I wanted an excuse for him letting me go, just like Charlie wants one and Kathlyn won't give it to him.  Why are people so heartless?  Bitches. I miss him, I will admit that, but I'm over it.  I have accepted that he's not coming back, at least not right now, and when and if he does I can tell him to go fuck himself - and that I just love.  I can just say "it won't feel right anymore" and boom!  Sweet revenge.  Sweet SWEET revenge.

      It's nice to know that Mattie is keeping up with me.  The blog, I mean.  Well, Chris, the limo guy, isn't coming over today because he can't until 7 (some people had to go to the Jags game and now some people have to go somewhere from Ponte Vedra at 5) . . . so I said fuck it and told him I had to go to church.  That's true, I should go to church, my Nana is singing tonite, but I don't feel like it.  I went last week (I always go in the morning  but I usually just go to youth choir and then leave if we aren't singing).  I went and sang last week, and I danced for them with Liz and Jennifer and Mason on Wednesday . . . or rather I practiced, because we aren't good enough at our interp to show it off (Susan's fault).  Gaga is letting me stay home until 11 tomorrow when Zac gets off work so me and him can go out for lunch and then chill until at least 4.  Tomorrow is a school night.  Thank God for Veteran's Day.  If it weren't for that I wouldn't be able to see Zac, (other than normal, you know).  Our relationship is interesting and I hope it will continue to get more interesting.  He's a virgin.  Technically, sort of.  (Don't ask.  I don't ask you.)  I got an Abercrombie catalog yesterday and there are some FINE men in there this season.  Everyone should pick it up.  Plus the sweaters are cute, if that's what you're more interested in.    Some of us don't have MEN at the moment.  We need other kinds of . . . youknowwhatnevermind!  Sorry Mattie that I have nothing good to say but I'm callin you later so it doesn't matter now does it?!!?

      *says in Ace Ventura voice* I have a MAN!  And Nick, be happy.  Life after love!  I have a man . . . Chris.  Well, as apposed to Zac who isn't doing too hot in the dating area.  Charlie came over today and we went out to the clubhouse and played pool.  That was fun.  Chris wants to come over tomorrow but Charlie can't and I don't know if I can play pool with him all by myself.  He's a hell of a lot better than me.  But then again so is Charlie, and I beat Charlie all the time!  And Zac.  I wonder if Tim will come play or, who was it I asked . . . that said that they play . . . I can't remember.

      FAST AS YOU CAN - FIONA APPLE   I let the beast in too soon, I don't know how to live  Without my hand on his throat; I fight him always & still  O darling, it's so sweet, you think you know how crazy   -How crazy I am  You say you don't spook easy, you won't go, but I know  And I pray that you will  -Fast as you can, baby run-free yourself of me  Fast as you can  I may be soft in your palm but I'll soon grow  Hungry for a fight, and I will not let you win  My pretty mouth will frame the phrases that will  Disprove your faith in man  So if you catch me trying to find my way into your  Heart from under your skin  -Fast as you can, baby scratch me out, free yourself  Fast as you can  Fast as you can, baby scratch me out, free yourself  Fast as you can  Sometimes my mind don't shake and shift  But most of the time, it does  And I get to the place where I'm begging for a lift  Or I'll drown in the wonders and the was  And I'll be your girl, if you say it's a gift  And you give me some more of your drugs  Yeah, I'll be your pet, if you just tell me it's a gift  Cuz I'm tired of whys, choking on whys,  Just need a little because, because  I let the beast in and then;  I even tried forgiving him, but it's too soon  So I'll fight again, again, again, again, again.  And for a little while more, I'll soar the  Uneven wind, complain and blame  The sterile land  But if you're getting any bright ideas, quiet dear  I'm blooming within  Fast as you can, baby wait watch me, I'll be out  Fast as I can, maybe late but at least about  Fast as you can leave me, let this thing  Run its route  Fast as you can

      I went out in the limo tonite.  I have nothing to say but that for right now.  Take that good or bad, I don't care.  Mattie, some contact, please?  Questions about Brigitte!

      I got kissed (again) . . . it was better this time.  I went up to Triple Plays with Charlie and Brigitte and waited for Chris . . . and he came, and he was mad at me for being up there, but he kissed me, several times.  We had to spy on rich, who didn't come up there because he owes Greg like $150.  Asked if he could borrow it and hasn't been back for a week.  Little bastard, he's cheatin on Brigitte, and she knows it, and she's not letting it get to her, and thats cool, but it makes ME mad because I love her, and she's my bestest friend right now, and I cannot watch her get hurt.  And if he hurts her, I can just feel a can of whoopass opening.  Let me explain:  me and Brigitte have been going thru a lot of shit lately, and we're doing it together.  That makes a friend.  She stood by me when Matt broke up with me, she took the phone out of my hand when I wanted so badly to call.  She introduced me to Chris, and to Danny, and to Rich . . . she introduced me to how life is when you play it safe while toeing the line at the same time.  She taught me how to make it work even when it sucks (whether you have to lie or pretend while you squeak by) . . . and that's so much because no one stands by anyone anymore!  Hell, me and Mattie aren't even as close as we were for a second there . . . and Mattie Johnson is definately in the box.  She gets it!  And I didn't think Brigitte did at first but she does.  In some ways more than Mattie does (though Mattie knows some shit too, lots of it!)  What's my point?  I don't do a good job of explaining my shit anymore, do I?  Live and let die.  I will expand on that either in a few minutes or tomorrow.

      Oh the second thing, the second fear, was that of moving, Dad said if one goes, we all go, and I can't handle that, so Gaga will for me.  I can't leave.  Not now.  Things are right side up right now, I WILL NOT VOLUNTARILY SHAKE THEM UP.  Dad can visit on weekends.  I love all my girls, they'll come too, of course, but Gaga needs me here, needs someone, I know I'm not the best but shes kept me things long.  She calls me her daughter and her baby and I'm hers, it's too late for them.  They weren't there when I was scared, and I was so alone, so no . . . no . . . hell f***ing no!!!

      Two of my worst fears have surfaced recently.  The first?  I forgot who my family was.  I don't think of my dad as my immediate family, though I love him so much, I think I love what he was before Korea, and I miss that.  That's wrong.  I'm supposed to love him no matter what, right?  Never second guess that?  I forgot who Eric and Amy were.  I forgot how it felt to hold Joshua when he's tired, or watch a movie with Emily.  And it wasn't painful until it hit me and I remembered.  I remembered that no matter how much I try to tell myself my family sucks, *parts of it do sometimes*, but I have these . . . these beautiful people that like to hear from me, and love me, and miss me when I'm gone, who know who I really am.  Who can see, even through my mistakes, what I really am and what I want even though I go about gettting it the wrong way sometimes.  I love my daddy, and I love my Uncle Eric, and I can't stand being away from either, but it's the thought of finding them when I made them lost, banished them to the outskirts of my mind, that makes me feel good, and stay sane.  That wants me to do better, and not just for me, but for everybody.  There's a picture from my birthday, it's the bookmark in my book, (White Oleander, READ IT) but I treasure it, it's from my birthday.  I journaled about what it felt like to be the center of that picture, this is what I wrote: 1) Loved.  2) Hope.  3) Eric's hand on my shoulder.  4) Emily's hand around three of my fingers.  5) Joshua's smile (it just radiates sometimes).  That's what I wrote, that's what I feel.  I also felt Amy's unhappiness, being sick, and having Eric about to leave her.  It's not forever honey, it'll seem like that for awhile, but you know you're under the same sky, and the days are as empty for him as for you.  I miss my daddy too, JJ, Em.  I know.  Anyway.    Dear Diary Written by Pink & L. Perry Published by Pink Publishing Designee/EMI-April Music, Inc./Stuck In The Throat/Famous Music Corp. (ASCAP)  Dear, dear diary  I wanna tell my secrets 'Cause you're the only one That I know will keep them Dear, dear diary I wanna tell my secrets I know you'll keep them So this is what I've done  I've been a bad, bad girl For so long Don't know how to change What went wrong Daddy's little girl But he went away What did it teach me?

      I suppose I won't be doing any more skipping.  I'm 16 now, my birthday was on Saturday, and now my old attendance contract is cancelled and a new one stands because of me missing Thursday and Friday: if I miss one day, any period except for third . . . (I wouldn't get marked absent), I will automatically be withdrawn from school.  Automatically, no more Parker - and even if the parental units decided to re-enroll me I would have to do some serious convincing as to why the principal should let me back in . . . and then it would just get old again, and I'd start skipping.  The one thing that concerns me is that I think my parents would kick me out.  I couldn't live with Gaga, and they would find some place to send me so I wouldn't be at home.  I couldn't just go live with a friend, or with Joe and be the nanny for their baby and get my GED and go to college . . . they'd put me in a YCC-type place and I don't want that.  I mean, I'm just really scared of living anywhere but home.  Terrifed.

      Eric is coming over to stay Saturday night.  That's gonna get me in trouble.  Hope my court issue isn't brought up, I don't want to be in trouble with him again, it makes me feel worse than when anybody else is mad, because it feels like he actually gives a shit . . . I know other people do and I see it and know it in my mind, but Eric is in my head and in my heart, and I have the hardest time with that.  And it's kinda like what Mattie says, about how she's paying for things from when she was younger, but the anger was what drove her to do those things.  I'm the same way, I don't get it either!!  WHY???  Why me?  Why us, Mattie?  Why do I have to be the fuckup??  Why can't the fuckin bitch that rules Hell not bother me for two damn seconds??  FUCK!!!

      ..but what I'm trying to say ..Is what the hell did I do to diserve the pain I hold and the anger and everything else..I would say it's because of the things I did when I was younger...but the pain is what drove me to those things..I mean ..damn it..I want something different..but I know I cant have it unless I was willing to fight for it..but I havent ever really fought for anything...I feel as if I let people run over me..and I cant do anything about it because I don't want to hurt their feelings..how hard is it to say what is really on your mind..hmm..very hard..and I feel I owe some people pain for the pain they caused me but yet I still can't do anything about it..I am at war..and the sad thing is it is with my self..its sad ..I know and pathetic..I feel so PATHETIC..but yet I do nothing....I am so afraid of being alone..but sometimes I think what could it hurt..but that doesnt last long I usually go right back to my constant worry..and I think toooooooo much about things that just make me angry..I know this isn't making much sense so I'm gonna quit. -Mattie's blog-

      Congrats to Mattie's nephew . . . it's all good.  I'm not feeling like a very nice person today.  I thought church would help but it didn't, and right now all I want is Lee's phone number so I can call him and tell him my granma is not dead.  Him and Cody are the only people on this Earth that would ever wait with me like they did today.  Lee refused to leave me until my ride came, my granma left me up at the school because she didn't see me when she came to get me.  I called Mom, and she brought me home.  Lee rode by and saw me and him and Cody came to chill with me, and they stayed for a long time . . . I was freaking out, I thought my granma was dead . . . anyway I looked at him and I said, "why aren't you gone yet??" and he said he couldn't leave me alone to go completely crazy.  I cried, after he left.  Nobody's ever . . . it's like Eric, like I said before, him and Cody I can feel in my heart, I know that sounds odd, but they don't just care, they'd take a bullet for me.  And I can use them as a fasod when I need to, even though it's wrong.  They're there when you need them, they always have been, I just didn't notice how much we've been through.  You can't take anything for granted anymore!  I'm so afraid they'll go away.

      I had a clove cigarette the other day.  Gaga says Gary used to smoke them and that repulsed me.  I don't plan on taking them up, they just taste good.  Smoking that was a very nostalgic thing for me, it made me think about some things.  Clove cigs are black, and they have a gold band around the end of the filter, and they are very strong in smell, I beleive Nina used the word "potent".  Eric is asleep in the living room.  I want to go to American Eagle and get some clothes when everyone gets up.  I'm mad.  Mom got a cat.  They named her Abby, and she's Siamese lookin from what I've heard.  I couldn't have one but when the cat's away the mice will play (Dad being the cat, the girls being the mice).  I'm not being fair, I know the whole story I'm just not giving it to you.  I'm gonna go, I don't have as much to say as I thought I would if I got to typing.  Hi Daisy girl!!

      Apparently I have psychological problems.  I am going to a social worker tomorrow and then to a psychiatrist . . .  and then to a week-long program from 9-5 sometime soon.  I am so angry about that I could spit.  I don't know if I can go.  I just don't know.  I am supposed to skip tomorrow, and if I do, I can come up to school after first period, but I don't know if I can . . . I don't want to go . . . I don't want to fix the rage, the hurt that I feel . . . it's justified . . . my parents are fucked so I'm gonna be fucked too .  . . Mattie lives with the rage in her head, why shouldn't I deal with it too??  What if they can't fix me, dammit?  Then what?  Those days I can't take it and I leave, what if they don't stop?  What if the screaming doesn't stop??

      You're the only person I can't get mad at when you tell me I'm wrong and I know you're right.  There's no use in fighting people you love, does no good . . . isn't that part of what you were saying?  So I suppose I just took the first step.  I never acknowledge shit like that, that you're or anyone else is right, but something has to change because there's nowhere to go anymore.  Bad reason, but if that is what it takes . . . I'll feed off that for awhile.  At least it's something besides someone else's fucking feelings.

      Santeria  I don't practice santeria  I aint got no crystal ball.  I had a million dollars but I'd,  I'd spend it all.  If I could find that heina and that sancho that she's found,  well I'd pop a cap in sancho and I'd slap her down.   What I really wanna know,  my baby, what I really want to say I can't define.  Well it's love,  that I need, oh ,  but my soul will have to,  wait till I get back and find heina of my own.  Daddy's gonna love one and all.  I feel the break,  feel the break,  feel the break and I got to live it up,  oh, yea huh, well I swear that I.  What I really wanna know, baby,  what I really want to say I can't define.  that love make it go,  my soul will have to...  What I really wanna say,  my baby,  What I really wanna say is I've got mine.  and I'll make it, Yes, I'm comin' up.  Tell sanchito that if he knows what is good for him he best go run and hide.  Daddy's got a new .45.  and I won't think twice to stick that barrel straight down sancho's throat.  Believe me when I say that I got somethin for his punk ass.  What I really wanna know, my baby,  what I really wanna say is there's just one,  way back,  and I'll make it, yea,  but my soul will have to wait.  yea, yea, yea

      Hey all . . . I just got back from Atlanta . . . my Gram is in the hospital, and my mom and my granma are freaking out, so my stay wasn't at all enjoyable . . . but it was a break which is what I wanted, right?  Well now, I have to convince Mrs. Landress Monday to let me stay at Terry Parker High School . . . if I can't it's off to FCCJ for a GED and to college . . . most likely also at FCCJ . . . isn't that just lovely.  I'm scared, I will say that.  Well, no I'm not.  I prefer school, but a job and college and a car don't really sound bad to me.  I hate that, I am going to do my absolute best to stay at TP, but I don't know whether I'm gonna be a TP student on Tuesday.  And is that bad?  People do survive with only ten years of public school, you know.  Maybe this will even turn out better than high school will, and I don't have to show up as often.  That sounds wrong, I don't mean it that way so don't take it that way.  But nothing I say is ever right anyway.  That's what Dad says, and thinks.  I know why he feels that way, but it doesn't take the sting off the slap like I thought it would.  I thought knowing would be easier, but it's harder.  Daisy, I'm so sorry your holidays weren't good, they should be.  Christmas and New Year's are supposed to be the most wonderful tim eof the year.  But they haven't been, and I needed a reprive.  That will sound selfish to anyone who knows me but I don't give a shit.  Now is a time fro change, and so many things have changed . . . I just need time to prove that.  I'm gonna go talk to Mattie about it all . . . *sigh* . . . I just can't explain it right now.

      Jamie . . .what can I say?  I had my first wrestling match today, it was badass, I am so proud of myself . . . I only managed it . . . flipped cards and did books, but I am, I'm proud as shit!!  Me and Britney managed, and I had to beat this guy Robert off of her, if he called her sexy one more time I was gonna jump on him.  Just because the chick has big boobs, leave her the fuck alone until you realize she is a PERSON.  Anyway, I asked Jamie today if I was prettier than his girlfriend and he said yes . . . and then he got all shy because he said it . . . and he likes me and that makes me feel good because its been so long since anyone was attracted to ME!!  Yessim, I am the MACK!!  I gotta go, I gotta go to bed, but I am really happy . . .*sigh* . . . hi Mattie!!

      Jamie has a girlfriend, and he told me he likes her today . . . he said she isn't pretty though . . . I can't tell what he wants though, and my gift is reading people.  Granted, I usually use that to hurt them, especially I don't like them.  I got hit today.  Some bitch in my Geometry class.  In class, there's this guy Anton . . . and he smokes bud, and he told us he did, and he was absent the other day and I said, "he's just out in the parking lot smokin a J, he'll be back in a minute" and this bitch wiles out on me.  And today I called her a bitch, and she saw me . . . I was really smooth, I give myself points for that, dude . . . so in the cafeteria this bitch comes up to me when I'm with Jamie, and starts yellin . . . I just looked at him, I think my face turned red because I got really hot . . . but I couldn't do anything, couldn't hit her, couldn't yell, they'll kick me outta Parker . . . so when she walks away I shouldered her, and she slapped me on my back . . . not even a fist, and it didn't hurt, but GEEZUS . . . I was like, "Jamie, don't let me go over there, don't let me . . . I'll wrestle her into the ground and then get kicked off the team here and then get withdrawn . . ." and he held me back.  Bitches get what comes to them.  Maybe she will back down when she finds out I'm on the wrestling team.  She's pretty small, anyway.  I don't know what she's thinking.  Biotch.  God, I don't shit with people, why did she shit with me?  I was kidding, Anton is my FRIEND, okay?  I get so mad at people like that.  The only worse ones are reefers, bad ones.  Lazy reeferheads.  Then comes the bitches.  I got to see Mikki today, and Kevin again .  . . he looks gross but he's a nice guy, he's growing on me, I have to see what Jamie does.  I think I will go write to him and wait and see if he calls me back.  He writes to me, it's cool, I suppose the only other thing he does is sleep.  Ha ha.  Why couldn't I get to my senior year without Geometry??  I could wait and do it like Jamie.  Okay, I'm going, Brandon just told me he doesn't like me . . . that was sooo mean.  I'm gonna cry.

      We are both shvingers, you see??  I made Kevin watch Goldmember, he has satellite cable . . . he didn’t like me for it . . . Mattie is in North Carolina or somewhere . . . I forgot.  Came to a conclusion.  I like Kevin.  I want to be close to Jamie, I want to be his best friend and have him be the one I run and cry on, because he loves me already, but I can’t love him like that because we mesh too well . . . couples have to fight.  If I date Kevin, we can be one big happy family, can’t we?  That’s what Jamie wants.  Well, no, Jamie wants the bang-bang and Mary Jane and then everybody to go home happy!!!  Ha ha ha!  Jamie told me that the other day, that I should feel very loved for the way they’ve accepted me and treated me already.  He’s right.  I should be, how does he spell it?, “greatful”.  Not grateful but greatful.  Ha ha.  Anyway, I wrote Jamie a note about Kevin but I don’t know whether he’ll think I’m obsessing or not.  I have been skipping fourth period every day to leave school, and Mom and Dad came to get me the other day and kind of tricked me into going to the psychiatrist.  The lady did an evaluation and concluded, after saying that I could have ADHD, that I am bipolar.  No big, right?  Aren’t a lot of people?  Yessim.  I’m glad I get meds though, so I won’t be so pissed all the time for no reason, or so easily agitated.  I had tournament for wrestling yesterday.  WHEW!  Bishop Kenney took first place, Paxon, second, and TERRY PARKER, THIRD.  At least we placed.  We placed well, too.  Lots of forfeits is all, because we are missing three wrestlers.  Joy, huh?  Worry is wasteful and useless in times like these.  I won’t be made useless; I won’t be idle with despair . . . gather myself around my fate . . . soooo.  How ‘bout them Lakers?  Kill them all and let God sort them out is what I say.  I had an interesting conversation with Kevin’s mom last night, about the Marines and God.  Notice, I’m not in church today.  I’m not mad at God, but I’m not sure if I care anymore or not, I gotta get back with it before my flame is completely gone.  Tell me, are you a badfish too?  I have to go, I’m being paged . . . I’m not online, so I have to cut and paste this into it in a few minutes . . . I have to go because the phone is ringing and it could be Jamie.  I think Kevin is asleep.  He should be.  At any rate, LATA!

      I called my granma.  I was supposed to go to work with her today, and I refused, so I called to apologize profusely, and she is going to call my pshychiatrist . . . that new medicine . . . I had a panic attack last night, and it was worse than it ever has been, and I have had a migraine since then . . . for hours, and hours, and I think she's getting scared, since she isn't mad anymore.  What if nothing works?  What if I'm always this fucked up?  I know I needed an attitude adjustment, I did that - now when I'm happy I'm actually HAPPY, and I'm fine, and I like school and all . . . but last night, it's like my head just exploded and I was so angry for no reason at all except I had to get up at 5:00 a.m. on one of my suspension days . . . which is like, no big, because that's normal time, right?  It's not a day off.  It's a day for me to feel like shit for being completely retarded most of the time.  So, now that I have gotten all that out, dammit, I called Kevin and woke him up.  He was sleeping.  I don't think Sim spent the night, or Sim would be up already, and would have called me and hoped to wake me up so he could yell "GOOD MORNING LIGHT OF MY FUCKING LIFE!!" in my ear.  I'm quite bored.  But the doctor is going to call, so I must find simpler ways to occupy myself.  I kissed him though.  I kissed Kevin.  He's such a sweetheart, I couldn't help myself.  He's cute when he shaves.  Ha ha ha.  Must go, see if Jamie went to school.

      Fuck you, Mikki, I know I'm terrible, LOL!  Chill, I'm kidding. No, I'm not withdrawn, Landress didn't let Sermons run the papers.  I'm on new medication so she wants to give it a try, which I appreciate.  So I'm still in school, but I'm suspended today and tomorrow.  I was gonna call you and see what you were doing, but I'm sure you're working.  I just want to see ya!  I have to go, I'm not supposed to be online, but I wanted to tell you everything is okay, especially if I don't get ahold of you today.  Love you.

      And by the way, Kevin told her to move her car so she'd leave yesterday . . . he didn't want me to go with her.  And she went out the door I had to tell Jamie the whole story and now they think I'm a weirdo too.  So you got what you wanted.

      We agreed to do these so we could vent, right?  Well unlike you, for the first time I'm going to vent about YOU.  Brigitte, of whom you told me isn't even really a good friend of yours, does not need to know what you told her.  If I wanted her to have the reaction she had, which I knew she would have, an not beleive me and have all this fucking drama shit because she's insane sometimes, I would have told her.  But I had already tried to tell her Rich was a scumbag before and she didn't beleive me, so I said nothing.  YOU, however, I was not afraid of you throwing a fit, and I tell you everything, and Brigitte was my best friend at the time, it was bothering me, so I told you.  AND THEN,  the part I'm actually mad at you for (because nobody ever keeps their mouth shut all the time) when Brigitte called your ass, you couldn't think of another time I've lied to you, but you said you've wondered??  And YES I COULD HEAR YOU!!  WERE YOU AFRAID OF ME BEING MAD?  THEN WHY DID YOU FUCKING SAY IT?  You couldn't help me out then?  I may lie, now and then, never to you, but who doesn't?  But I do not make shit up.  I have never had to.  You know this, I'm honest with you.  And you, for the first time in our friendship, completely let me down, for a girl that you can't stand to be close to because she's complicated and can be a bitch for no reason (your words were "she has her on and off days for no reason and is complicated").  She came to me and disrespected me in front of my boyfriend with my best friend in the house where he could hear her, and then using the car as a contol factor, she yelled at me, and was mad becauase I didn't show any emotion.  DId she want me to cry?  I'm not upset!  I know Rich hit on me in the bar that night.  I KNOW.   I was there.  But somehow, for no fucking reason, I'm untrustworthy when I have never lied to either of you??  How does that make any sense at all?  I trusted you.  I don't mind so much that you told her, but the fact that you egged her on when she didn't beleive me, that was cruel and mean and almost made me cry because I felt like you were against me . . . you're the only person that really knows me and it's like you hate me now.

      Shit does happen, and I'm sorry I said what I said and I appreciate you taking what you said out of your blog . . . I know how the ordeal sounded . . . but with Brigitte . . . she's 17, and that's only two years older than me and he thinks she's attractive . . . I don't look 16 . . . it's one year, too . . . that's all I wanted to say.  I just hope that this doesn't mess up our friendship and you hate me for it or anything, because that would kill me more than losing Brigitte and watching her and Liz drive away did.  I can't stand the fire that some people have about things, and it is hard for me when I don't understand.  Don't wanna sound like a girl but I get so scared so easy.  Hopefully I will see you soon so I'm gonna go.  Sorry to the people who read this shit that don't know what the FUCK I'm bitching about, ha ha ha lol!

      About talking over people . . . it's weird because I don't do it to everyone . . . like Joe, and Hoss, and Kevin and Jamie and I did at first to Brigitte but then I stopped.  I let her own me.  It's the mentality that I have, that I have to be the big person and stand up for me so people don't run over me but I do it to the wrong people . . . I'm offended that you said something because I'm sick and that's the kind of thing I fucking freak about . . . because it's me and I forget that I do it and I feel bad and stupid and I HATE FEELING FUCKING VULNERABLE . . . I wasn't trying to talk over you at Hoss's, I just felt like you weren't getting the point at all, and I thought you were wrong about some of it, and I wanted you to stop, because I started feeling pathetic.  And I can't feel that way, I feel that way all the time, and I was having fun over at Hoss's, and you were all like, on Brigitte's side, and I couldn't stand it, she's such an asshole sometimes, and I feel so rejected and miserable that she left me at Five Points . . .the FUCKING GAY COMMUNITY . . . DIP ME IN CHOCOLATE AND FEED ME TO THE LESBIANS, WHY DON'T YA!!  So what was I supposed to be thinking?  I have to slow down and tell myself to listen.  And I forget, and when you get mean, or cut me off . . . it's just that, Mattie, I can't talk to anyone else, they tell me all their shit, and I can't get a word in without getting murdered . . .so I do it to the few people that let me . . . I will get better now that you said something and I thought about it though.  I'm so sorry.  I really am.  If you only knew that helpless feeling I get.  If you only knew the anger situations like that burn into me . . . so I can't breathe until I take it out on somebody.  It'll stop, just don't get mad at me okay?  I can't deal with too many people getting mad at once and I have some shit to work out right now, so help me.  Okay?  I called the bitch today and left a message on her voice mail and apologized for Kevin's juvenile behavior in calling her and being angry that she left me at Five Points and all.  I was cocky, and it was an asshole thing to do, but she is the one that shit with me, was she not?  I didn't do shit to her.  Her boyfriend is just a grown pervert who also happens to be an idiot and a drunk druggie who is just . . . it's bad.  He is. She's fucked up too.  All over the place.  She needs help.  I'm gonna call you and see if you're home.

      Kevin is still fucking asleep . . . I don't really care, but dammit . . . he isn't avoiding me, it just feels that way.  I don't feel like calling Sim to see where he is, so I'm not.  I don't feel like calling Andy to see where he is, so I'm not.  I called Jamie.  Sleeping?  Yes.  Very much so.  His brother didn't even want to try to wake him up.  Hoss went out to Blue Cypress with his paintballs and slingshot.  Mattie, you're online talking to me but I don't know how long I will be on.  My granma gets home at 4, and I have an appointment today that I'm half looking forward to and half dreading.  I don't mind talking to Betty (yes I remember her name now).  I don't mind explaining all my problems and recieving funky medication to make me a little happy person.  I should, but I don't mind at all.  It makes me less annoying, almost bearable.  It makes me want to live one more day, instead of writing out the ways to make this go away, the royal fuck you, the big one . . . to die, to be gone, to not cry anymore, to not let myself feel hopeless for someone else's sake.  To wake up and breathe and to have peace . . . you can get it no other way then popping a pill . . . and when they work, when you can do drugs with fucking permission, why the hell not??  And I don't have to smoke weed . . .I'm not free when I smoke bud, I feel like I'm imploding . . . I know it's because I'm a lightweight but damn . . . it hurts.  You spin and spin and spin.  It's like your first cigarette times about a million.  And after that, after acid, you get these cold flashes.  I'm always cold now, even when it's hot I get tense and cold.  Can't help it.  Jamie freaks out now and then, he just thinks I'm weird.  When I passed out he was the one to get scared.  OMFG!  One more, one more down and only so many more to go.  Shit.   IndieLoser05: hey IndieC8: yeah well...people dont give a damn about other people ..Ive learned that..they lie..cheat..steal...fuck man kind is all FUCKED IndieLoser05: would you care to explain that further for the court Mrs. Robinson?

      Messing with my man is bad for your health 'cuz . . . they tryin ta take my baby oh what the hell NAW . . . sorry, I keep having these black people moments, I don't know where they come from.  I'm feeling better than I was the last time I wrote.  I couldn't find Kevin last night, no one picked up the phone which means Kevin is at Andy's and Mom and Frankie weren't home . . . or they were drinking, like usual . . . however, after I called him, I called Jamie, and he had slept until 4, and eaten this big family dinner and shit but finally got to talk to me.  I only had ten minutes, but I got to talk.  Jamie is fine, so is his fuckin woman (I mean his woman, not his 'fuckin' woman, that's mean).  I was hoping to see them all today, but Kevin isn't awake yet.  I bet Sim is, but he's probably at work.  I have a psych appointment today at 5:30 . . . and stuff . . . so I'm gonna go . . . I could have sworn I posted something earlier!  Tell me I'm not crazy. Shit!

      Ok, I re-edited.  One more thing - it's not my fault you haven't let go.  Of me and Fred.  I'm gone, Mattie, what is there to worry about?  Now if you were suspicious of him now and then I could understand that.  But me?  I have nothing to do with it, and it's not me that should still be getting shit for it.  Or at least I shouldn't be getting it alone.

      And the only reason I edited it where I did is because my family reads this now and then, at least my uncle does, and like I've told you, you're the only one who knows my shit.  But you taught me something.  Want to hear it?  You can't trust anyone, ever.  You can't ever think that you met someone you can be honest with.  You just can't.  You get that close and then people start to find your imperfections, and they have a power to magnify them because they have all of you - and your trust.  Never trust anyone but yourself.  Never wish that anyone would let you be the special person they trusted.  It all goes away in the end.  It all goes to hell.

      I appparently have a lot of problems that I didn't know about . . . or if I did I didn't care . . . I don't . . . I'm angry right now, so I don't really give a shit . . . plus, after I get offline and I cry, you'll find something else that's wrong with me.  I did say that to Fred, I told him that he had a girlfriend and she was my friend, and that he was making a mistake and so he left.  It happened.  What is with people and not beleiving me.  Fred has his own ass to cover, or he just doesn't remember, or something.  It's not that I cant sit still for five minutes and listen, it's that I never tell anyone about all of it, and when you talk to me it brings things up and I forget miserably what the point was.  And it makes me feel better that you know how I feel and so I tell you why . . . but you don't have to worry about that anymore, because you're not gonna tell me anything now that you think and tell people that I'm this lying selfish person . . . what is with that, how can I be untrustworthy when I'm the one who tells you everything?  Why is it that you think that I make shit up?  Do you think it's fun?  Okay, so I make a big deal about being honest with you, okay that went over the top too fast and so it seems like I'm a little weird.  But Goddammit, look at Brigitte.  She will not beleive that Rich cheats on her because she asks him and he denies it and she doesn't want to . . . you were angry, you don't want to be wrong . . . even if Fred did say that that's how it happened, what the hell is the significance of that?  We've been through it.  I will not be the person that I used to be when everyone hated me and thought I was annoying . . . so I'm sorry that you feel that way . . . that I'm annoying and selfish.  Plus, as a friend, where the hell did you fucking find it in you to say that to me?  Do you have any idea how that could screw me up?  Oh, sorry, my bad, seriously, this isn't about me.  I apologize.   And I'm fucking sorry that I even spoke to you yesterday, okay?  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  What else do you fucking want me to say?  I'm sorry.  Lies and more lies, from who?  Why are you so stuck on not beleiving me?  I don't get it.  I have never lied to you.  I'm the one who told you about the Fred thing because I can't keep it in.  He verified all of it then, why are we re-hashing it and now I'm the bad person again?  Before it was our problem, now it's my problem. Fuck that.  FUCK IT.  THIS IS MY FAULT BUT AT THE SAME TIME ITS NOT.  YOU'RE MAKING ME INTO SOMETHING THAT I AM NOT.  AND FOR ONCE I CAN SAY THAT.  I DIDN'T DO THIS, YOU JUST HAVE TO LET IT GO BECAUSE IT'S YOU WHO REFUSES TO BELEIVE ME.

      I have 22 minutes before I am supposed to call Andy so I figured I'd blog.  Mattie, you had a good time last night!  With ME!  Yay!  And there were absolutely no flying fish or whales involved.  We're gate-deaders!!  Anyway . . . see why I hang out with these people?  They get high a lot, but other than that (which I do it too now and then) they're straight and honest and faithful loyal people.  They make me feel like spaghetti on the inside.  All limp and warm and yummy.  LOL.  Sorry, my metaphors aren't coming out too good these days.  Did you go to Fred's last night?  How was he?  I'm sorry about what I posted before this, I won't retract, but I will apologize, I was angry.  I don't think it's too offensive, but I saw your blog and I got so mad.  It's so funny when I get mad at you because it still takes so much for me to use profanity to you, in a bad way.  I get all flustered and I'm like, shit!  So do I get to be on the happy list now since we had a good time last night?  Andy is 22 . . . I had forgotten . . . but if you dated him, like ever, you have to play Mommy too . . . that would take my job.  Veronica freaks people out - especially girls.  The man is 22, it's okay for him to have a baby, you know.  Not that you would ever date him because you have Fred, but if that ever falls through my friends think you're hot.  Ha ha!  They told me so.  I can't help but tell you.  I'm hungry.  I haven't talked to my father in a looooong time, and that sucks because it's like he doesn't care about me right now.  I know that isn't the case, I guess he is just busy, but goddammit, when do I get him?  Never, ever.  He's okay with that, why can't I be?  I hate thinking about it, it's not as bad as I make it sound, but my mind is all fucking screwed up so I do that. I don't like what Andy said about Veronica's mom . . . it made me feel crazy because I'm bipolar.  I think it kinda turned Kevin's head too and I'm not wierd!!  I'm not.  Well I am but I'm not crazy (most of the time).  Not in this insane kinda way.  He's like, "don't say m-o-m!!"  I was like shit!  "NO, don't say shit!!"  Whoops, then.  "Better."  Andy is a trip.  If I didn't have Kevin I'd like Andy, but Andy is too old, and it would be gross, and stuff.  I'm 16.  I act about 12.  I don't need help, jesus.  I wish I was you sometimes, Mattie, because I want a car, and a job, and to be 18.  So I guess I could be Brigitte too, she's almost 18 . . . anybody really . . . but I hate this.  This in between shit.  Looking for a first job.  Looking for a life.  Damn.  I just took a shower and I feel all better.  I still smell like smoke and booze and Veronica and Mattie's spray . . . but I like it.  I smell better, though.  That's always good.

      Hoss just told me the secret to life.  Well, not to everyone's life, but to mine.  The only reason I am the way I am is because I refuse to face this person that I become . . . being obsessive, and making myself vulnerable because of it . . . using songs and friends and my family to justify the bitch that I am . . . the annoyance that I cause.  I do not have to be a sad person.  I do not have to feel this way.  It is MY FAULT that people leave me, it is MY FAULT that I drive people away.  Dylan says I have to keep things simple and it's true.  I do not have to rely on people, I don't have to scare people.  But see, it takes time to do more than recognize that because it hurts so much in the first place to take up for it . . . that ever tear I have ever cried, just like Mattie said, has been self-inflicted.  To hear someone say that . . . not just listen, to hear them.  Listening is hard enough to get into the habit of doing, and here I am trying to change myself overnight.  God, but I can do this now, I can use Kevin and Jamie and Mattie and Sim and Andy and everybody to learn how to actually be around people, to actually function. To let things be.  To let somebody call me, not call them first.  To go a day without talking to Kevin, or asking Sim (or Mattie) to come get me.  Because you know, being alone isn't always bad.  People have to learn sometime to be happy by themselves.  Mattie seems to be the only person so far that has that need to have a man like I do.  It's like without Kevin, since I'm not in school, how am I ever gonna find somebody else?  Poor Kevin, I think he really likes me.  Like really.  And Hoss approves, ha ha ha!  Actually I don't know, I know he has his doubts, but I think he'll get past them, and I'm using his fear of girls to help me out.  Well I am going to go, because Dylan has decided he'll play with Andy and Kevin, and they told me when I asked him to call them . . . Andy should be off work and back from getting Veronica right now . . . PEACE . . .

      Okay, my mom just woke me up asking me about fucking books at school . . . why the hell is she down there . . . then I called Mattie, I thought she might be up already . . . she isn't, I woke her . . . but shit happens . . . Hoss asked me why my icon for my IM was a cow.  Interesting question.  So I changed my AIM one to Cher.  Hmmm . . .

      This was my horoscope today: Be patient with indecisive people. You've been in that position yourself and know how exasperating it can be. Bask in the goodwill of friends and associates in other parts of the world.  WTF?  Why is the damn horoscope always right? Smoke Two Joints - She was living in a single room with three other individuals. One of them was a male and the other two, Well, the other two were females. God only know what they were up to in there. And furthermore, Susan, I wouldn't be the least bit surprised to learn that all four of them habitually smoke marijuana cigarettes. Reefers! I smoke two joints in the morning. I smoke two joints at night. I smoke two joints in the afternoon, it makes me feel alright.  I smoke two joints in time of peace, and two in time of war.  I smoke two joints before I smoke two joints, And then I smoke two more!  SMOKED CIGARETTES UNTIL THE DAY SHE DIED!!  Toke a big spliff of some good sensimillia Smoked cigarettes 'til the day she died.  Toke a big spliff of some good sensamill..."  Easy E were ya ever caught slippin'?  Hell no!  Daddy he once told me, "Son you be hard workin' man" And Momma she once told me, "Son you do the best you can"  But, then one day I met a man who came to me and said, "Hard work good, and hard work fine but first take care of Head"  Whoa, rock me tonight, Whoa-oh, Jah say, Ohhhhhh ohhh ohhh ohhhh . . . Good song . . . I adapted to saying Elmo instead of hell no because for some reason people in my family don't like that word and it sounds like Sublime is saying 'elmo' anyway  . . . I don't know, it's mysterious, lol!!  Whatever, that's another word I can't stand . . . geezus . . .

      HI Mattie, how are you girl?  I miss you, I can't talk to you when you are gone, dammit.  I talked to Andy earlier and to Kevin (I decided not to call Kevin and see how long it took him to call me . . . he called at 8:30 this morning).  And they both said tuesday is great . . . and Dylan (JD, lol!) is going too . . . he's actually happy about it too i think.  I neglected to tell him that both of them COMPLETELY SUCK though, he's gonna be playing with the worst guys in the world.  Andy isn't bad on the drums, but see, I don't pay attention to them.  I think they're both good.  Now Dylan, he's just fuckin awesome, that's his problem.  I didn't get my horoscope today, I'm sure everyone is relieved.  No over analytic shit today.  But anyway, Kevin called, and I told him that I went to church, and that I was going back and shit, and he reacted weird, but he can deal . . . it doesn't mean I'm not still mad at God . . .it means those people are my friends and some of the best I've ever had . . . they have known me since I was a kid and now they call my almost daily and if you think that I'm gonna fuck up pure love you're crazy, because that's what it is.  It's beautiful because you don't find open hate in churches; its not always about God, it's about positive values . . . positive things and openess . . . not the crazy shit that I have to deal with in my every day life.  It's that looseness, that peace, that's why I go.  Even though I don't believe it I like going and hearing that Jesus loves me . . . if nothing else maybe I get a good laugh or two.  I don't bring my faith (or lack of) to Kevin's house so why did he say anything?  I don't know why I'm explaining, because I don't really give a shit.  I have blue eyes.  They just have this ring of brown around the pupil.  But I have blue eyes.  So does Kevin.  I love blue eyes.  Gotta go back to church, I have Praise Band practice.  Bye Daisy girl!!

      Uugh . . . I talked to Kevin earlier this morning and he was throwing up . . . he sounded so groggy, I felt so bad . . . and then I called Jamie and found out he has the same thing . . . they both sound the way they do when they're smoking pot and trying to hold it in (all the time).  And we were talking (me and Jamie) and he goes I gotta go throw up and hung up on me so I'm just gonna wait until tomorrow to talk to him again.  Ha ha!  But it's okay.  Mattie, if you read this tonite - if you really don't want or can't come tomorrow, JD still wants to go really bad, he's down for it, and I think he will give me a ride and all.  I don't want to do it like that because I don't know how I will get back home . . . I'm sure he'd leave when I wanted to, right?  Hmmm . . . I really hope you aren't busy, it's gonna suck if you are.  I don't know if Kevin is going to be sick or not.  Jamie told me that Kevin was at his house last night and that's why no one answered the phone.  No problem there, it all makes sense now.  I'm gonna go sing 'Video Killed the Radio Star' at the top of my lungs and dance alone . . . maybe I will call you . . . but you I mean Mattie . . .

      Mattie, well that's too bad if you do have to move because I have to go anyway . . . I just have to get JD to pick me up because he is going.  I don't want to have to convince him to though, so I hope you're free.  Plus he hates taking me home.  Don't know why, but he doesn't see it as a packaged deal.  But it'll be cool if you do come!  We've been trying so hard to get together!  Damn!  I went to a Super Bowl Party last night and stayed until about 11 . . . called Kevin when I got home and he didn't pick up the phone.  I didn't feel like calling aroud for him so I didn't.  It was at my friend Matt's, and I went with his girlfriend Jennifer.  Kimberly and Chris rode with us and we sang SHOW TUNES in the car!  Kimberly put in this cd and Chris goes,"I love Disney!!"  And Kimberly, in the car, was barking at people!  Barking!   I was like, shoot me now.  It was fun though.  We sang Dancing Queen and Hakuna Matata.  We sound like we're 12 but we aren't, it was hilarious.  Ansley and Jarood made me this cd that has this song called Smoochie Girl on it, and it's been stuck in my head all morning.  AnnMarie gove me a cd with Big Tymers' Still Fly on it, so I have been running around singing "and then I heard BOOM from the amplifiers" for two days.  Don't think I'm completely weird, I'm just easily amused.  The game was good, Tampa Bay won just like I wanted them too.   The halftime show SUCKED ASS though.  What was that??  Don't even know what to call it it was so bad.  Hoss, you stayed home again!  Weirdo!!  I'm comin over, just let me find a ride, okay??

      Truthfully . . .I don't want to be in love ever again . . . but at the same time I want it so bad I can taste it . . . I do I do I do . . . and Kevin . . . he could love me if I show a shred of humanity and maybe normalcy.  I hope I'm not reading him wrong, because when I'm in the room with him I can feel there's like this crazy tension . . . and I have never been like that with anyone . . . Stephen and I had a dirty realationship . . . and me and Joey had a wrong one . . . and me and Matt had and natural one . . . and this one is just crazy, completely overwhelming . . . more on that in a minute, I have to get offline and then back on . . .

I am in Atlanta and will not be able to share my discoveries until I am back in Jacksonville where I belong, but have no fear Mattie, I am learning so much (forreal this time) where I am . . . I don't think I am going to end up staying though, as I had hoped. Remember, if you hold Sprite in your mouth too long it loses its burping potential.  Mattie, BLOG.

      Hi, I haven't written in so long, there has been such a gap in all of what you have heard, Daisy girl.  I have been in the middle of . . . the middle of ME . . . and finding out who I am, who my dad is.  Breathing.  Meaning.  I am who I am, and what I am, but I do have the ability to be that without masking it.  Crap I gotta go.  I'll be home Saturday.

      I hate the world today . . . Chad doesn't want me to do this at all . . . but at the same time he's beside me, but it's my decision and I can't handle that.  I'm afraid.  Oh, and I need to get something out.  I like Chad.  I really like Chad.  If I just thought he was a guy and he was there when I was mad and I was drunk I would have made sure he knew that was all it was that it was . . . that's the way I am, I don't let guys have false information, they do too much with feelings.  Always, they don't know when to quit.  I will never let myself forget about that again, because I get hurt.  I stumble and I fall and it sucks.  Girls don't like boys they like cars and money.  (Good Charlotte.)  I hate everyone who says their new cd sucks because I love it.  I'm talking to Craig, I think I am freaking him out giving him crazy details, ha ha.  But you know what?  I don't give a shit. I love myself, right?  No, not yet, but I'm finally fucking working on it, and that makes me proud.   I want Chad around.  I hate to admit that but I do.  Let's see what I can do about it.

      Do you ever just stop and think to yourself, "SHIT!!"?  I do that a lot.  I don't mean to, but I am quite the spaz, and I freak people out, but what they don't realize is that I freak out too . . . really easily.  And I get hurt too.  So why is this my fault all the time?  Some people get over it, and some don't.  Why?  I can call Chad and he can be all like, you know we did this so let's fix it, and I can hang out with my dad and he can be like, you did this but I'll help you if you let me for once, and I can call Mattie and she can be busy but still talk for a minute, and I can call Andy and him be like well fuck, let me know if I can help . . . la de da . . . but Hoss, he gets mad because I'm the asshole, after a month, I'm still the asshole.  I'm the peice of shit.  Explain it to me, because I DON NOT FUCKING UNDERSTAND!!!  It isn't about anyone but me!  I'M THE ONE IN TROUBLE!!!  JESUS!!!

      Hey Mattie, I'm home!  Finally.  I went to Atlanta and I had a good time, but I can't move up there because I had a good time and that isn't okay with the parentals.  You know, they get jealous too easy.  But it was, not to be corny, a growing experience, and I am really happy that I went.  I sit here at 7 in the morning because my father will be on his way to pick me up at 730.  Why, I have no idea, we have no business at THIS hour.  He should have made it later.  I still don't know who I am, but I have learned how to handle people . . . with finesse . . . without getting angry or sad or freaking out which was my whole issue before.  It's a powerful thing to speak without feeling, or rather to have feeling but not be biased in a conversation no matter what the conversation is.  Bias is a reporter word, but I use it because I like it.  I have some work to do.  I have to fix my life, which involves fixing Hoss, or my relationship with him, and his mother, finding out whether Andy did what I told him he had to do, finding Chad when he gets out of jail (though he's going to find me, I'm sure).  All fucked up sounding I know.  My dad wants me to keep bussing tables at Tony Roma's but we're looking for another job for me today, but we can't do it at 730.  I have no idea what is going on.  But I don't have to.  Okay, he is going to call soon, but I had to blog SOMETHING.  I'll find you soon Mattie, I just haven't had time quite yet, I got home two days ago.  I'll call you.  Behave!!

      I have been in the hospital Mattie, I am sorry for the lack of communication.  I have missed you.  I had a nervous breakdown, pulled a little russian roulette of my own and I ended up admitted to Baptist.  I am now living with my dad and Kathlyn and everybody but it's going soooo well, I am sooo happy now!  I will call you soon, for now mail me and stuff because I don't have phone privelages yet, lol. I can get online though.   I miss you, I hope you're okay, I need so badly to be able to talk about all this and I can't yet.  It just won't come out, I have faced too much about myself that I ran away from.  Anyway, you can ask if you care, I don't want to vent to you if you don't want to hear it.  I love you girl.  I still don't love me but I love you.

      Screw this lifetime.  I am moving out!  Me and Dad are moving to Fort Myers.  I don't want to go, frankly.  Mom wants me out though.  I suppose that's my fault but I think it's deeper than me. I am really mad and taken aback about it actually.  She said she isn't going to let me see Ash and Brooke until she decides otherwise (which will be never).  She also said that her and Dad were probably getting seperated and/or divorced within the next year and it was all my fault.  She threw in a "don't you feel bad now??".  I'm going to miss my family so much, but it isn't all my fault, so I can be grateful that I have some truth (I'm bad enough at blaming myself as it is).  When I moved in I realized how much love I had for them, and that they weren't really crazy, so I feel bad that we're falling apart anyway.  I realized what it was that was really my fault and what wasn't, and it's just sad that Dad told me I could save everybody and Mom said she agreed until I was actually good and now she has to find another reason to break it off.  She must just have issues with him.  They go deeper than me, she wouldn't do that to him only for me.  She wouldn't.  I lost my job, my beloved job.  Josh lost his too, trying to protect me and my lies I think.  Figures.  And now I can't find his cell phone number so I hae lost him.  That sucks.  I don't know what to do about it.  My focus should be elsewhere I know.  But I think about him every time I see a red pickup truck, especially a Dodge.   I don't love anyone.  I don't even love me.  But for some reason I am completely jaded and I have no issues with flings now and then.  Or maybe I just fall quickly in and slowly out of love.  I don't know.  All I know is I miss my job.  My Woger Wabbit and my Sonny Bunny and my Josh with the nice ass and my Ambygirl.  But things change.  HONULULU!!!  GOTTA GO THERE!!!

Go wolfpack!  I am also passing, and relatively happy.  I go to church twice a week, and my sister is getting married in a week and a half.  She asked me to be the maid of honor!!  How times change!  I miss Mattie.  We talk online sometimes.  I don't call though.  Matt is in San Diego and is leaving for Japan December 12th.  Bummer.  He has a fetish for Asian women and he's going to Japan for six months.  What kind of world do I live in?  Okay, I'm going.  More later.  Thank you for shopping.

      Today I had the worst day.  Well, nowhere near the worst, but fourth block sucked because of Mike and his foolish flubby bunnies.  I call them that because my sister called stupid people that when she was little.  My dad wouldn't let her say 'jerk' or 'dickhead' so she made up the phrase above.  I am the master, and that's all I have to say.  I guess I get annoying, but I have been around people that I've known all my life for so long I just don't know what to do at this new school.  Wolfie is soooo stupid.  I am soooo stupid.  I make A's, but not anywhere but school.  I'm sick of Matt being gone.  I am sick of my father.  I am sick of everything but church.  I love church.  For every skeptic out there, I beg you, let me be your little Bible thumper.  As long as you don't tell my friends I cry at night I won't tell anyone that you carry the Good Book on a chain on which everyone thinks your wallet hangs.  *Saw that in a movie once*.  Lol.  You'd have to be JD to get that one, sorry.  I miss David.  I'm a nervous wreck.  I have to go, Brett is ont he phone . . .

Marie was house-sitting for Eric's parents this weekend and he came home late, saying he had gotten a flat tire.  (ahem, bullshit!)  He then proceeded to tell me that he went muddin' the next morning and I didn't know Marie didn't know, so I accidentally told on him.  What do I do now?  Oh, and I hit Lita in class Friday.  Go me.

      Sometimes I just don't know what to think.  I got really mad at Mom after school (DETENTION WAS CANCELLED!!) because she went to Burger King with me and then got HERSELF something to eat and proceeded to tell me to eat at home.  Okay, there isn't anything wrong with that, is there?  I mean, shit happens, right?  Boy was I mad, I about cussed her out.  Over food.  I haven't talked to Matt in like, a few weeks and I am wondering why.  I hope he is okay . . . what would I do without him?  I keep dreaming about him.  The other night he died, then last night he was just there and I kissed him but not as much as you might think, which was weird.  Kat and John are getting married in a few days.  I'm mad crazy about John but I worry about them.  They're too young.  And if they're too young, doesn't that mean that Matt and I are too young???

      Aladdin is my friend from chorus that keeps me sane and laughing. He likes pina coladas and getting caught in the rain .... isn't that nice?  Aladdin is controversially sexual.  His favorite song is The Voice Within by Christina Aguilera (who is evil).  He was mad because I wrote about Zlatan (also controversial) but not him.  Let me just say that I'm straight but I have gay pride.  I want email from anyone who thinks there is something wrong with that, but it's against my religion to be gay. Plus, in general, I judge girls but I prefer Dicks to Hooters *chicken wings and sexually*.

      I'm in Chorus and I haven't written in a long time.  We have a sub and Zlatan isn't here, he went to Disney, which I was supposed to go, but I skipped school and Ms. Chandler found out about it.  She's the biggest bitch in the whole wide world.  I used to think Ms. Huff was the laziest, but now I absolutely know.  She gave me an 'F' last semester because she "didn't feel like putting in the juniors grades".  It was bullshit.   Eric's parents are selling his truck because he left with me Sunday night to go smoke and got busted by Marla who then called their mom.  He's left with me a million times, and so he's getting in trouble for it.  Only the problem is, he is blaming it all on me, because I begged him to leave (I wanted a cigarette so bad).  We took Daniel too, but noooo, it has nothing to do with him!  Just lil' old me.  And I yelled at Marla about tellin' and now she's pissed off as hell.  Erg.  I wish Zlatan was here.  Have you seen the new cell phone commercial?  The one where the cell phone guy goes to the sorority house and is like, "now your nighttime free minutes start at 7 and not at 9!"  and they all look at the clock and its seven and they're all like, "OH MY GODDDDDDDDDDD  SEVEN!!!!!"  It's extremely funny!
