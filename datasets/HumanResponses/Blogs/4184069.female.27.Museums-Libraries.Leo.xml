      I've journaled extensively for some time. I've written about people I hate, people who get on my nerves, how much sex I'd like to be having, crazy dreams I've had, etc etc. This is one of the literary forms that I enjoy partaking in the most. Journaling, or "blogging" as it's now known, can be liberating. You can say all of the crazy shit on paper, that you couldn't say to whomever it was you may've been conversing or arguing with or even shagging (or gank banking as my best friend and I lovingly refer to it as).  As Tony Soprano said this past season to his psychiatrist, Dr. Melfi, sometimes spilling open is like taking a massive shit. You feel a sense of relief. You've gotten rid of a load, albeit the load is personal. You feel triumphant. Holding bac- (bowels or thoughts) - is like Tantalus Torture... it can be very uncomfortable, the more the pressure builds. Unloading one's thoughts is an intimate act as is deficating. You sit on the can, and you ponder, as you're unloading. What a great analogy! It's usually something you do by yourself. Journaling allows you to expend that feeling.... the anger, the lust, the happiness, the joy etc etc. You can fucking trash people without having to deal with the drama you'd be bothered with, if you were to curse someone to their face. I suppose what I'm trying ot say is that my mind works in stereo folks! I am the quintessial shit talker and most of the time it's justified. I'm direct and I'm honest, but I'm also guarded and leery. There are times I simply can't say what I'd like to say to people. I simply write it down and store it away. I think now that I am ready to make the web masses privy what goes on in my head. All of it is worthwhile and thought provoking. Some of it might be a little profane and perverse. My mind run 'round and 'round liek a colorful mobius strip... none of the geometrical shapes ever really making any sense, but it's good shit nevertheless!  Of course I will compose your basic run-of-the-mill thoughts about current events and popular culture.  Important thoughts such as why Paris Hilton's sensuous vapidness is so appealing and noteworthy opinions of the like.  Fasten your seatbelts. This voyage inside my head may be turbulent, but it will be funnier than hell!

      Today plans to be a very unproductive one here at work... I hope. In the meantime, what to do, what to do-o... Hey! I know! I'll blog!  Let me blog about how unpredictable and strange the male populace can be. Not all of them... but some of them. Enough to make me scratch my head in befuddlement.  Some dudes are guilty of the same codes of conduct they accuse some of us women of e.g., complaining, talking incessantly and whining incessantly. Guys within my age bracket (26-mid 30's) can make you feel like you're the only person in the world when you're with them. They whisper sweet nothings in your ear and confess their feelings right on the spot. Sometimes this might even occur on the first or second date. Meanwhile, you're sitting there the whole time think,    "Ohmydog! Is he serious?? We don't even know each other this is moving waay to fast..."     Of course you don't voice your concerns aloud, you simply just sit there nodding and smiling politely, wondering if it was a bad idea to make out with this clown. They mistake your smile for mutual feelings, however, and shortly thereafter... all of a sudden, this is when the guy decides to pull the rug out from under you.  He  beats  you  to the punch and end abruptly puts an end to things ,  after a handful of trysts. He accuses  you  of developing "big feelings" notwithstanding the fact that he pursued you and is the one with the big feelings. He is the one who talked up all of this rhetorical bullshit about seeing alot of each other, while you sat across from him with a grimace/smile combo on your face, trying not to wretch over the prospect of seeing this annoying so-and-so on a consistent basis. I think some guys like to flatter themselves. They build themselves up and think some of us women are supposed to idolize them. We should be flattered that they've asked us out and treated us to a couple of drinks and some take-out. There is nothing wrong with a little ego-boost fellas, but give me a fuckin' break! Dudes are always shocked as shit when some of us girls don't go sniveling and crying for an explanation. They're speechless after having given this long-winded speech about how fast this is going, because you simply listen quietly, nod, and then say,    "Okay. Well good luck with your endeavors."     They stumble around    "wha', huh... uhhh... oh okay..."    stunned by your indifference and your willingness to accept that this brief courtship has fizzled. I can't even begin to explain how many self-absorbed dickweeds my best friend and I have dealt with, who think they're the shit and we're completely and utterly in love with them after like 3 dates. They become insecure because they've laid all of their cards on the table only to not have the feelings reciprocated. They make up some fucking bullshit explanation making US look like the clingy ones. Contrary to popular MAN-belief, we are really relieved that it's over. We simply do not give a fucking shit, because you were annoying to begin with. Not all women are pathetic dames looking to settle. If all you wanted to do was screw or make-out, then cut the pretense, shut the fuck up, and let shit unfold naturally. This bullshit is precisely why I prefer to date an older gent. The conversation is a lot more interesting and flows consistently, he is more direct with what he wants and needs, we can agree or disagree and then we proceed to  agree  on a mutually convenient time and place to carry on our shenanigans... point, blank, period. Older men also tend to keep the incessant whining to a minimum and actually ask YOU about YOUR day, instead of launching into this whine-fest about how horribly his day went. He's aware of the fact that you aren't his mother. After string of horrible and annoying dates with our male peers, my best friend and I celebrate our single-ness even more. We are none too worse for wear inspite of and despite our experiences. Being in the company of some annoying bitch doesn't even hold a candle to just being alone, sometimes. It's not as bad as I fancied it to be actually. The fact that in another week we'll both be 27 and 26 respectively and are not in serious relationships yet or married doesn't bother us anymore. It's not a bad thing to want to find something concrete with someone later on in life, and to WAIT for this.  In summation, dudes who're insecure and self-absorbed... this tirade is directed towards you all. DO NOT FLATTER YOURSELVES WITH YOUR ENDLESS PRETEXTS AND CHILDRENS' GAMES! Some of us require MEN who actually talk to us about worthwhile things. Intellectual intercourse I call it. They resume the intellectual seduction by putting their hands in the right places without asking (as was explained in my favorite French film, "Romance" by a self-professed casanova who bedded 10,000 women by simply engaging them in intelligent discourse). We're caught up in the rapture of the valid things they have to say, and allow them  to go there , with their hands. It starts upstairs first... and continues downstairs... if you catch my drift. This is how to seduce an intelligent woman effectively. You can't expect us to yield to you by "playing" us because of your own anxieties and your half-assed attempts at seduction.

      Sooo... This past weekend has been a very productive and alcohol laden one. I celebrated my birthday this past Sunday, so by today's standards I am officially over-the-hill... at a whopping 27 years of age! Hell, MF'n yeah! Despite my old-ness, I must say I am stoked and can't wait to reach the 30 years mark. My best friend (whose birthday is three days after mine, making Wednesday her official day) came down from Somerville, Mass to help me bumrush this smallish New England city. We had a blast. Cat is 1 year younger than me so is more immature and weird by default (tee hee... personal dig, 'cause I know she'll read this). Anyway, so Cat came down late Saturday afternoon, and the immediate consumption of several libations began. ... well not immediate... well... lemme explain...  We didn't want to seem like raving alcoholics, itching to drink at jump, so we pretended to catch up (yeah right... I saw her like a month prior and we talk on the phone constantly), and I gave her a giftbag... complete with lipgloss, toiletries and a gift certificate (which came inside a nifty compact mirror)- all from Sephora. We pretended to be interested in watching DVDs-  Strangers With Candy season 2  and some perverted Japanese film called,  "In the Realm of the Senses"  perveeeerted city! I loved it! Anyway, at around 8pm or so we headed down to Pastis, a French brasserie in town, to listen to some live jazz and to indulge in drink and grub. Cat ordered some pork dish that was supposedly so tender that it was supposed to melt in your mouth. A pork party on your tongue - Um... no thank you, please. I had some simple thin thread pasta tossed w/ some vegetables and olive oil. We ordered kir and red wine respectively.  Whilst we waited for our food, we scanned the room critiquing bad hair and attire. As the band,  The Edwin West Project  (a twosome which featured a singer (Edwin) and a guitar player) - was setting up, I couldn't help but notice how familiar the singer looked to me. I realized that I recognized him from two local record stores he worked at (first one and then the other, not at the same time). I couldn't wait to hear his gig. All set up and ready to sing, Edwin looked over and said during his intro, "Hey I know you..." which I found amusing. Every so often, we'd pass each other on the street and exchange cordial head nods of recognition, but we never introduced ourselves formally. Needless to say, he was great. He covered a lot of great jazz standards with a smattering of Bossa Nova thrown in...   The Girl from Ipanema  , for example. After Cat and I devoured our food and drink, I waited for Edwin to break before I went to the bathroom. Upon returning, I found him sitting in my spot chatting with Cat. I squeezed in next to Cat and then Edwin and I formally introduced ourselves to one another. The three of us chatted for the duration of his break about his singing endeavors and such. Afterward, Cat noted this bartender who I'll refer to as  'S'  she and I befriended about a month ago, from this place called Agave Grill. I wrote a favorable review of Agave, for a local magazine, after which Cat and I saturated our bloodstream with its high-end tequila and sangrita... Hey, it was all in the name of post-article research. I can't speak what I don't know... Anyway, Cat spied him and would later admit to me that she'd been thinking about him for some time after we familiarized ourselves with him during our tequila induced debauchery. hint-hint. She went over- (I'm sure she sauntered and swayed)- to say hello on her way to the ladies room. Sometime in-between then, we got a free chocolate birthday souffle with a side of lemon sherbert on a thin cookie and a  digestive  courtesy of the manager of Pastis. Oh yeah, we had coffee too. I would later discover that this digestive would be the culprit for a killer hangover the following Sunday. Anyway, we listened to Edwin sing a couple more songs, then S'... came over to say hello to me. He had another Agave staffer in tow. They enouraged us to meet them at this OTHER place called Peppercorn Gril further downtown, on Main Street. So, Cat and I polished off our digestives and made our way on down to Peppercorn Grill in the rain... pushing our way through a thick cloud of clubbers. Upon arriving, we found S' and the other young woman, (I'll call her 'G'), whose boyfriend is a bartender there. We told them that we'd walked and they practically gasped with shock. I guess walking is some antiquated notion nowadays. While chillin' at Peppercorn Grill, we all passed around some cucumber and melon martini that G's boyfriend had concocted. It was very good I must say. Afterward, we all headed down to this wine and panini bar called, Bin 228 where we had several more drinks. Meanwhile, sitting across from the two of them, I could feel the sexual energy emanating from Cat's and S's attraction to one another... so during one of my drunken, obnoxious semi-tirades, I began teasing the both of them. I mean, it was obvious to me that they were attracted to one another.  G and her boyfriend were also in the midst of some weird discussion, trying to determine whether they were a serious item or not. G would later turn to us and tell us that she and her boytoy had been fucking for about 7 weeks so she figures that constitutes "dating." hahahaha (sorry had to laugh at that one). See, G is from Ecuador, so "dating" is a weird term there. I guess they call it something else. In any event, during the course of the evening, I also learned from G. the origins of F.U.P.U.A. - an acronym for Fat Upper Pussy Area. Oookaaay. 'S' gave Cat and I a ride home (I live right down the street from Agave). Next morning, I woke up with a killer hangover, we went to brunch/lunch... at this diner called Mississippi Bar and Grill, I drank black coffee, ate my lunch with a side of Advil and then we walked down to a Tea/Coffee/Martini bar combo for some loose tea in a pot. Later we would head on over to my mother's house for more birthday food. Sooo it was a productive birthday weekend. Cat and I also made time to call my job's voicemail repeatedly during our drunken shenanigans to listen to one of my colleagues' weird cartoon voice. She offered up options on the voicemail's phone tree. Cat kept opined that she sounds like she should be saying, "WELCOME to MOVIE PHONE!!" Plus said co-worker is one of those people who says,  "progrum"  instead of  program . hahahah, funny stuff. I must say, Cat and I always have a blast when we meet up, so it's not like I'm surprised by how much fun we both had. In summation, I learned this past weekend taught me that it is not appealing to have a F.U.P.U.A., I don't ever want to have a hangover again so I have to stock up on  Chaser  or   lay off the granddaddy liquor altogether, and that two people who're attracted to one another just need to be prodded on by a drunken third party.  cheers!
