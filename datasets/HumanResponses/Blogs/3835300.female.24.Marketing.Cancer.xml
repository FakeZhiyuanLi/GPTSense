       .m o v i n g_i n. 07.06.04- 07.09.04     After a quick 30 minute drive, we saw our apartment for the first time. Friends had toured the apartment before we signed the lease, but there was still an element of surprise and adventure as we laid eyes on our new dwelling! Needless to say, our arrival was much anticipated. We met the apartment manager, Bonnie, who showed us to our apartment so we could let the cats out and put down our (overweight) luggage. The cats were quite surprised to find themselves in California!    Before we could officially move it, we headed to the apartment manager's office to take care of some final paperwork. To our surprise, Bonnie asked us for our deposit and first month's rent. Rick had mailed a cashier's check two weeks prior, so we were caught off guard when she said she hadn't received it. "Well, I can't let you move in without that money, and we don't take personal checks," Bonnie noted with a forced smile. I was sort of waiting for Cuba Gooding Jr. to appear shouting, "Show me the money!!" It was quite a reality check. This woman was not going to bend the rules for anything, and wasn't amenable to any of the alternative solutions we offered. For all of her sweet words and smiles, she is a tough cookie! I couldn't believe that after all of the planning and anticipation, everything could fall through at the last minute. Thankfully, after a few tense moments she finally agreed to let us put the deposit on a credit card. To this day, we don't know where the check is! (Rick is going through the long process of putting a stop payment on the cashiers check.)                Now that we had maneuvered our way into the apartment, the next step was to move all of our belongings. Our moving truck was scheduled to arrive on Thursday, 7/8, so we rented a dolly and enlisted the help of Rick's brother Gene. (In the meantime we had an Aerobed, but it had a small hole so I had to reinflate halfway through the night! It was quite amusing to wake up in a deflated bed.)     When moving day arrived I called the movers to triple-confirm the appointment. Everything had already been set up and confirmed, but I hadn't heard anything from them for awhile so I began to get suspicious. Sure enough, when I talked to them they informed me that they weren't coming. Our stuff was on a train somewhere, and they could not give me an ETA.    "Maybe Monday.  Would Monday be ok?"  they asked.    "Absolutely not! I start work on Monday. There would be nobody here to accept the delivery." At this point I was exasperated. Moving really wears out your patience!   "That's ok, we can just leave everything on the sidewalk in front of the apartment." was her reply.    It's moments like these that I'm thankful I'm friends with so many New Yorkers. Some of their NYC attitude rubbed off on me, and that is something you just can't learn on your own. I will spare you the details from the rest of the conversation, but when all was said and done, the delivery was expedited and arrived on Friday.    Friday was a big day, because I I also had a dress fitting for my bridesmaid's dress in Pasadena (for Brooke's wedding in August) and an appointment at the DMV. The dress fitting went well (although quite rushed!) , but the trip to the DMV took hours. Turns out I had to take the written driver's test again in order to transfer my MA license! Thankfully I passed, and I am now officially a California resident. The movers arrived shortly after we returned from the errands, and we spent the rest of the afternoon moving everything in.     I started taking some photos of the apartment in order to track our progress.  To experience the mess firsthand, check out my  urlLink ofoto album  (I will eventually figure out how to post pictures on the blog, I promise). I will be taking more pictures soon, as we have made great strides since these were taken. Enjoy!    To conclude, now that we are finally here we are very happy with the apartment itself as well as the location. We live on a residential street at the foot of the Hollywood Hills. We are one block from famous Hollywood Blvd., home of the  urlLink Kodak Theatre ,  urlLink Hollywood Walk of Fame , and  urlLink Grauman's Chinese Theatre .  There is also a new complex called  urlLink Hollywood + Highland , which is very neat.   We are also two blocks from Sunset Blvd. We are still exploring the area and discovering new local treasures. Next week I am planning to hike through  urlLink Runyon Canyon Park , which is one block north of our apartment.    This is not, however, the end of the moving saga. Stay tuned for the next issue of Moving Chronicles to hear about our first days at work! I promise drama, suspense, and even a few chuckles.

      Although the purpose of this blog is to catalogue my celebrity sightings, I have only recently moved to LA and hence haven't yet spied a single famous person, with the exception of the media guy I work with who stars in a Progressive commercial. To fill the white space, I figured I would fill you in on the trials and tribulations we experienced whilst moving across the country. While it's not as intriguing as celebrity sightings, it's at least some reading material if you are dying of boredom or trying to pass the hours at work.    I think Murphy's Law succinctly summarizes the whole ordeal: everything that could go wrong, did go wrong.     .t h e_f l i g h t. 07.06.04     After many weeks of debate, Rick and I finally decided that we should fly across country rather than drive, if only to save ourselves the misery of driving with our two rather temperamental cats. Of course, we were also concerned with the well-being of our cats, and the rationale was that the flight would be 6 hours of trauma as opposed to a week. We were able to bring them on the flight with us as carry-on luggage, which seemed like the most humane way to transport them.     Moving day arrived, and we woke up early to give our cats the sedative our vet had prescribed. We made our way to the airport and waited in a looooong line to check in. As we checked our luggage, the ticket agent informed us that our bags were overweight by 20 pounds each! We paid the overweight charges, and went on our merry way with lighter wallets, anyhow.     We didn't have to wait long for the next obstacle to present itself. When we reached the security gate, the attendant asked me to take the cats out of the carrier. "What?!?" I asked, incredulously. I thought he was joking! Nope. He was serious. I think he didn't know what he was asking; I was convinced that once I took the cat out of the proverbial bag, I would be scratched, bitten and mauled, left to chase down a terrified feline in Boston's Logan airport. I thought they would run away and I would never see them again! This guy obviously did not know my cats.    After a few stern looks I complied. The cat was not happy, but we managed to pass through unscathed. Rick, however, was not so lucky. He was holding Pearl, and as he walked through the metal detector he set off the alarm. With one arm holding the cat, he tried to take off his watch with one hand. When he was successful he tried again, but to no avail. When all was said and done, he had managed to hold on to the cat while taking off his shoes, removing his cell phone, and taking off his belt. After a few more attempts, he finally made it! We put the cats back in the bags, and I cried- out of joy, relief, stress, who knows?!? I'm emotional, ok?     After waiting around a bit longer, we finally made it onto the flight. We were thankfully seated next to a very patient man, because the cats were vocal about their dissatisfaction with the whole situation (although the vet assured us that they would not make a peep). Pearl cried throughout the flight, and Marx thrashed about the carrier in a futile attempt to break free. By the time we landed we were all happy to get off the plane. Pearl especially, because she had managed to go to the bathroom in her carrier (yuck!).     Rick's mom picked us up from the airport, and was quite a welcome event. We had finally arrived! It was an exhausting trip, but we were almost done. She took us to the apartment that we would now call home. This was a much anticipated trip, considering that Rick and I had never actually seen the apartment before we signed the lease. The saga continues...

      Ladies and gentleman, I am proud to report that I have finally seen some movie stars!  Today I saw none other than the  urlLink Fresh Prince  and his wife  urlLink Jada - and I wasn't even in Bel Air!  After work I headed over to  urlLink The Grove  (a Los Angeles shopping center) to pick up some last minute items for Brooke's wedding.  I debated about whether I should go, because it was already 8:00pm and I had to eat dinner and go grocery shopping.  However, I figured I should seize the opportunity to get errands done, so I headed over.  When I arrived,  I was surprised to see a stage set up right in front of the  urlLink Crate & Barrel .  There were quite a few people gathered around as I made my way over to the store.  I went around the back of the stage to avoid the crowd, and as I approached the stairway  urlLink Jada Pinkett-Smith  appeared!  She stood at the stairs waiting for her cue to go onstage.  Apparently she was performing with her new band,  urlLink Wicked Wisdom .  I was literally standing about 4 feet away from her!  She waved and smiled at everyone as she was waiting.  It was totally bizarre to have a benign shopping trip turn into a celebrity sighting!  Only in LA can you run errands and bump into a movie star!  After she went onstage I went into the store, where I could hear the band performing (they were playing some pretty heavy rock, which was  somehow not what I expected from Jada's band).  You can see some pictures of the concert posted  urlLink here .  After I had shopped for about 30 minutes, I reemerged only to hear an explosion of applause.  I peered over to see what had happened,  and realized that  urlLink Will Smith  had taken the stage!  He was kickin it old school, and busted out with his 1991 hit, " urlLink Summertime " (from the Homebase album).  It certainly was missing the stylings of DJ Jazzy Jeff, but Will seemed to manage just fine on his own!  When the show ended they again departed the stage right where I was standing.  It is times like these I curse myself for not having a camera phone!  They stood there for awhile, signing autographs and smiling for Entertainment Tonight cameras.  Hooray!  I feel like I'm really living in Hollywood now!  I'm also looking into camera phones... :)

      Some of you may have already read about how our rent deposit check was lost in the mail, much to our dismay on moving day, so it won't come as a surprise that I don't have very good luck with cashier's checks.  Thankfully, our deposit refund from our Cambridge apartment arrived unscathed at the post office about two weeks ago. We were thrilled that our old landlord had requested a secured delivery, with signature required. At least  this  check managed to escape the (allegedly) sticky fingers of our new landlord!  However, as it turns out, I proved to be a bigger foil. Because we hadn't opened bank accounts right away, we were unable to deposit our very punctual check when it arrived. It joined the piles of junk mail, important documents, trash, and myriad papers strewn on the kitchen table. We shouldn't have been surprised when Rick was unable to locate it on the day it was to be deposited. He woke me up one morning, inquiring about its whereabouts. I got up to help him search for it, certain that it was hiding in the piles on our table. "We really need to organize this!" I thought, as I smeared the papers around and aggravated the chaos in a futile search for the check.  Then it dawned on me: I had "cleaned" yesterday! Note that "cleaning," at this stage of moving, means "throwing away unscrupulously."  In my dazed state of half-sleep, I replayed the whole scene in my mind. I had looked at the envelope, decided we didn't need it, and tossed it away in the garbage, with the rest of the junk. The memory replayed in my head almost flawlessly. No haze, no fuzzy recollections. I was pretty sure I had thrown it away. Uh oh.  By this point we were both in a panic. Between the two missing checks, we had literally lost over $3400!! We had turned the apartment upside down (or rightside up? It didn't look any different than when we started), but the check refused to appear. I promised Rick I would take care of it, and ushered him out the door to go to work.  Time to get down to business. I rolled up my sleeves and donned the pink rubber gloves we had in the kitchen. I found a long handled stick and grabbed a kitchen chair, and made my way to the basement in my pajamas, complete with tie-dyed shorts.  I must have been a site to be seen!   When I reached the dumpster, I positioned the chair so I could peer into the abyss.  I was determined to rescue the check and redeem myself!  To my dismay, there wasn't much to see.  Apparently the trash had been emptied recently,  and I lost hope of finding the check in the ruins.  I poked around for awhile,  just in case, and returned to my apartment in my ridiculous, now smelly, outfit.  No check.     At this point my mom called to tell me that someone was interested in my car (he bought it today- it's sold!!!!), so I got to recount the whole event to her in my state of distress.  She was comforting and encouraging, as always, and assured me that everything would be ok.  She was right!  I called the landlord when we got off the phone, and when I explained that I had thrown away the check she said, "That sounds exactly like something I would do!"  Lesson learned- we now have ONE pile of papers, and I'm not allowed to throw them away.  A week later, we had another check in the mail, and we lived happily ever after.   :)

       .f i r s t_d a y.07.12.04             It wasn't long before the "vacation" was over and we had to start our new jobs here in California. I have the privilege of working right here in Hollywood, a mere 5 minute drive from our apartment (lucky me, I get to avoid LA traffic!!). I'm working in the home entertainment division of a market research company named OTX, conducting studies related to DVDs and other home entertainment-related issues. Rick is clerking for Judge Stephen Reinhardt in the  urlLink US Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit  in downtown LA. Rick also gets to avoid traffic because he takes the subway, so unfortunately our sporty new Toyota Corrolla doesn't get much action!  My first day at work was great. I met everyone in my department, filled out paperwork, and was introduced to OTX in general. It turns out that it is a pretty cool place to work! I'm very happy that I ended up here, in part because they really treat their employees well. Here are some of my favorite perks: • Yoga on Wednesdays (so LA! Yoga mats even feature the OTX logo.) • Subsidized Coke ($0.25!!) • Bagel Fridays • All the candy you could ever want (including,  but not limited to, gummi bears, hot tamales, M+Ms, and Goldfish) • Free microwave popcorn • Netflix account • (So, essentially the yoga is to burn off all the calories you consume while taking advantage of the free stuff at work.)  The office itself is pretty hip. It's in a warehouse and has exposed brick walls and slate blue interior. Gracing the walls are huge black and white photos of great thinkers and innovators, including Jimi Hendrix, Federico Fellini, Neil Armstrong, Bill Gates, and Martin Luther King Jr. It's altogether very stylish!  The work is fun, too. So far I have worked on studies for Harry Potter, Garfield, Troy, and the Chronicles of Riddick. These studies involve measuring purchase intent (who wants to buy DVDs?), and TV spots (which DVD commercials appeal to different audiences?). I'm also helping on a study measuring interest in Video on Demand.  But enough about that.  I'm sure you're really reading this to hear about my  second  day at work!  .s e c o n d_d a y.07.13.04   The day started innocently enough; the sun was shining (this  is  LA, after all!), and I was excited to learn more about my new job. I headed into work without any indications that disaster was about to strike!  Lunchtime rolled around, and we decided to order from a Greek cafe down the road (which will remain anonymous). I ordered a gyro, but when the food arrived we realized that my lunch wasn't included. I walked back down to the restaurant with a coworker and picked it up; by this time I was starving! I don't know if it was my hunger or it was just good food, but when I actually got to eat I really couldn't believe how good it was. Somehow everything was perfect- the pita was warm, the tomatos were ripe, the tzatziki sauce was divine. Yum! It was a great lunch.  Apparently my stomach had a different opinion about the whole thing. By 1:00pm, I started feeling... well, gross. At first I thought it was all in my head. Maybe I was just nervous about being at a new job, or maybe I ate too much. I kept trying to talk myself out of feeling so sick, but waves of nausea kept washing over me. By 2:00pm I couldn't deny that I was ill, but I didn't want to leave early on my second day at work. I had never called in sick throughout the entire 2 years I spent at my last job, and I wasn't about to start now!  By 2:30 it was obvious that there was no turning back. A coworker was at my desk in the process of explaining something to me, and I practically bowled her over in my rush to the bathroom. I couldn't believe this was happening! As I ran/walked/hopped toward the bathroom in my heels, I realized there was no way I could make it to the bathroom. Thankfully I was passing the receptionist's desk (she wasn't there!), and I spotted a gloriously large trashcan. Hallelujah! I proceeded to vomit a venerable cornucopia of Greek cuisine in the middle of the hallway. Embarrassed, I tried to keep moving to the bathroom, hugging my beloved trashcan and stumbling down the hall while throwing up (I'm a multi-tasker!). I finally made it to the bathroom and continued (I'll spare the details), until I was finally able to stand and walk straight. I smoothed my hair, emptied the trashcan, and tried to muster up whatever dignity I had left. I gracefully embarked on the long Walk of Shame back to the office.  Needless to say, I was mortified. My boss looked a bit horrified when I returned, and he insisted that I go home. I did what any reasonable person would do and tried to play it off like I was totally fine. He didn't buy it for a second (smart man!), and sent me home after assuring me about a dozen times that it was ok and he understood that I was sick. I felt terrible! Of all the things NOT to do on your second day at work, I'm pretty sure getting sick is one of them!  Luckily I was fully recovered by the next day, although a bit humiliated. I am fortunate to work with some really easy-going people, so thankfully they were very nice and sympathetic. I was very happy to put the whole thing behind me. I am happy to report that I have worked an entire three weeks without a similar incident!  This would not be the last foil in our California adventure, however. Stay tuned to hear about some more California sites (pictures coming soon!), and adventures in dumpster diving.
