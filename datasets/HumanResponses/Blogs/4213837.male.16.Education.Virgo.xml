       Yo sup homie....  Today, i was ill and couldn't go to school... I told my classmates i got hit by a car and they actually believed it.... Lol so gullible... Anyhow, i gave my work to Kenneth so that he could hand them up to my teachers... Ms. Koh made me rewrite my essay outline just because i forgot to hand it in a week ago and left it in the history folder which i gave her... what an ass!!!  Also, went to the doctors around 4 and he gave me medicine... paid $20 just for a visit... what a rip-off.... i can write myself an excuse letter without having to pay $20!!! Oh yeah... or fencing coach is thinking about sending us to Malaysia for an international fencing competition... wonder if it'll push through...  Anyhow, i gtg do my work now... peace out ...

       GRRR... the shit i do for people...  Anyhow, today's fencing competition was a disaster... We got a bronze... Yes, but a fatal error on my part gave us a bronze instead of a gold or silver.... out of the four members that joined, one was a reserve for every match.... Chow, Kit and I agreed that Ryan was to sit out for all the bouts we had, because he was the weakest of us all... So Ryan sat out the first and second bouts for the team event.... Taking pity on him, I let him fence the next one.... THE MOST IMPORTANT ONE! It was the first round of the Semi finals and Ryan screwed up... he was off form and he lost all the lead chow and kit got.... we ended up losing the Duxton Plane by 1 miserable point.... Chow and Kit were already yelling at me to get Ryan off the Piste and get back into my position but I thought that Ryan deserved a chance to fence.... We lost the match but went on to win the bronze in a deciding match where we made sure Ryan sat out...  Ryan felt bad after but i told him not to worry... but sometimes when u tell others not to feel bad about losing a match, u still feel angry inside... thats how i felt but i put on a mask and pretended to be ok with not winning a silver at least...

       Yo waddup ya'll...  Ayt this is my second entry and i still wonder why I'm blogging... I'm talking to a GOD DAMED WHITE TEXT BOX!!! ARHGHGH!!!  So anyhow, fencing competition is tomorrow, and I'll be taking part in the team event along with Chow, Kit, and Ryan... One of us has to be in reserve but I don't know who... Personally, I think it should be Ryan... He's the shortest one of us all and Kit, Chow and I fence better than him... Anyhow, wish us luck for tomorrow...  Sometimes I wonder why i chose to come to CJC... I culda gone to Singapore American School... all I had to do was to make a call and pay the fees... But my mom heard stuff about SAS and she doesn't want me mixing with the people there... Sometimes she thinks too conservatively... Traditional Asian values... she's afraid that i might turn wild and crazy like back when I was in Manila.  But overall, I don't regret it... I got to meet all my friends inCJC... Thing is they're all humble but truly your friends... Kids in International schools tend to be more materialistic and aren't true friends... When you get in trouble, they disappear... Still, I sometimes miss hanging out with international kids... I miss being materialistic... I hardly have time or even bother to shop much anymore... I'm more comfortable around them... All the fun and excitement they bring opposed to the dull, more studious Singaporean kids... But still, I've no regrets in my current position although i miss being in the Philippines sometimes.  Oh yeah... mom bumped up my allowance to SG$100 a week now... the allowance includes me going out on weekends and eating in school, and it doesn't include school supplies... But I'll only bring 50 bucks to school a week, I'll save the other 50 every week... Gotta buy my brother a laptop for his Birthday next spring break... but then SG$50 a week ain't much... fine I'll starve for my brother.... The shit i do for people sometimes puzzles me...  ayt anyway, i gtg... peace... hope i kick ass tomorrow.

       I was told that when you blog, you write what you would say to a close friend... So I'm staring at this white textbox, trying to imagine dear Jamey, my best friend whom i left behind in the Philippines. I'm pretty sure the last time i checked, Jamey looks way cuter than this...  So anyhow, a short intro, I'm Khai, Asian, 16 years of age and about 5'8 and 120lbs... Yeah i know, pretty small sized for a 16 year old... But still my mom thinks im good looking... Thats all that matters... hehe :P... And yes i'm a mama's boy... Parents like to spoil me and I LOVE IT! I now study in Catholic Junior College... Pretty good school in terms of acedemic standards, yet again it's sorta the cheapest and the most autocratic school I've been to. Feel as if I'm in communist North Korea, serving old uncle Kim Jong Il!  Anyhow, why am I blogging?! GOSH!!! My good American buddies in the Philippines were right! Coming to Singapore will make me gay like all the other people here... WEll, let's not be to harsh, I'm sure there are some straight people around. So anyway, I agree, Singapore's a bitch... NO GUM?! U GOTTA BE SHITTING ME!!! BTW, cars drive on the wrong side of the road here and i got hit by a taxi while crossing a T-junction when i first got here in January. So life has turned upside down for me. Local people think I'm wierd, and I think their wierd too... But still, in life, you expect changes and you gotta go with the flow... so i cut a deal with a few classmates of mine that by December, I'll start speaking wierd like Singapoerans.... NO LAH! WAH LAO EH! You know, slang terms like that... Ain't that shit cool... And when I go on my vacation with Jamey in New Zealand next year, she's gonna start wondering WTF happened to me... btw, Jamey's from North Carolina... like me, we were expats in the Philippines.  Ayt, enough for today... i gotta go... peace... BYE LAH!!
