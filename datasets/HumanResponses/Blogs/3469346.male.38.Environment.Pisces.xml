      ...and I'm in work. Got here at 10, managed to get into the place without too much drama (first alarm code didn't work, but the second I'd been given did). Sat down (first mistake, should have made coffee and checked email first), began eom reps. Only problem being that I did the cleardown procedures first before the EOM reps. Ahh, well, back to the beginnig (only an extra hour to add on to my Saturday working).  I can't be bothered with any of this crap. I've just been looking at pictures of beautiful girls on various Formula 1 sites and I'm thinking that I want a piece of that action. I mean, I want to have something more to my life than sitting in a crappy 85 year old office, with no heating, one window (facing a wall), energy-saving lightbulbs and a PC onitor that's very quickly burning the eyes out of my head (so mu so that I'm having to go to my doctor next week to have him look at what's going on with one of my eyes which has got either an infection or has been in some way damaged by these dodgy monitors).  I want out of this, this job and this life. By that I mean I want a new life - one of adventure and some decent cash in my pocket. I'm working for a workers co-op but I don't feel like one of the members. I'm an outsider. Always have been. Always will be.

      Well, it's Friday and I should be glad - but - I'm working tomorrow (End of Month Reports to run and other such exciting things to do). Of-course the back-up tape drive has failed (again), which means that running the EOMs might be a tad risky if something goes wrong (which it will). There is also the minor matter of me not having any keys or alarm code to get into the building as the person whose keys I was supposed to get and whose alarm code I need to use has taken the day off without saying so. All this means that at 10am tomorrow morning (when I should be sleeping) I shall be sitting in my car outside the work hoping that my co-worker will turn up.  Yes, I could ask someone else for their keys but therein lies a problem. I can't. It's not because I *can't* ask someone else, but because deep down in my psyche there's a little bit of me that just *can't*. I think I must be deeply repressed or something but I'd feel like I was imposing, puttting undue pressure on someone. I mean, what if I borrow someone else's keys and something goes horribly wrong? Like, for example: maybe the alarm will go off because I've made a mess of pushing the code buttons, or I didn't set it correctly and it goes off after I've left (or even worse as I'm leaving). I'd also have to come in on Monday to hand the keys back and Monday is supposed to be a holiday.  On the other hand...if I don't ask someone else for their keys then I'll have to come in and work on Monday (even though it's a holiday), otherwise I'll lose a days wages.  I need rest.  I also need to change my life around. I need recognition, recognition for having acheived something, for being someone. That's my goal now - to be someone. I'm 38 but I want to be the next David Bailey or Ansel Adams. No, no,no,no...I want to make images like those of Mapplethorpe (http://www.mapplethorpe.org/malenudes6.html). Ahhh, Mapplethorpe, such talent, such talent.  I know I can do it, I know I have the talent. So much work to do in such a short space of time. Time, there's never enough time. And now it's time to go. For today anyway.

      Well, its lunch time at the Muesli Factory (as I affectionately call my place of employment). Got loads of work to do but the server is busy and the scripts I have to run will slow everything down. Yes, I'm a Sys Admin. Not entirely by choice you understand, more out of necessity (it's a long story). One day I might tell the world about it. Maybe.  I'm 37 and I guess that what I'm feeling right now might be best described as a 'mid-life panic'. Not yet a crisis, but definitely a panic. I really don't like computers. Using them is one thing, actually doing anything moderately complicated on them is another - and I don't like complications. There's nothing worse than having massive, awkward complications in ones life. And computers, generally, add complications to my life - especially when they go wrong. Of-course I have to add to all you out there who are by now saying, 'no - computers don't go wrong, its the people that use them that are nearly always the problem'. Well, yes, that's right, but the problem for me is that when computers go wrong its nearly always because I've messed up.  I mess up frequently, generaly because I'm a naturally curious sort of a person. Curiosity killed the cat and all that. Except in my case its curiosity killed the system. Though I've (so far) resisted the temptation to go to root and type rm* -r. Not that I've got an cause to because I know that the repercussions would be enormous (I'd lose my job, I'd lose my house, my partner, etc, etc, etc). Also, I rather like the people I work with (generally) and I've no reason to do anything like that. The thought that I should have done it in my last place of employment does niggle a little though. Hmmm.  Have to think a little more about this.  Overall there was a smell of fried onions.  Zzorg!

      Good grief! it's been a month since my last posting. Can't believe it. Anyway, you didn't miss much, same old crap at work. Did another Month End report (managed to actually set the alarm off this time).  Having a crisis of confidence. I'm 38 and desperately trying to change my life/career. Would really have liked to have made it as a portrait photographer but, if the results of my night class are anything to go by then it'll be another lifetime before I can give up the day job...) Not happy about that at all. Sigh.  My depression is back. Big Time. Feeling very dumb.  Something's got to happen - and soon.
