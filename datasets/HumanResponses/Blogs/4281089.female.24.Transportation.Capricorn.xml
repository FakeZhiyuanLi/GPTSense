      as i was sitting at dinner, involved in normal conversation and it seemed all the attention was directed towards a certain individual, but not another. i began to analyze the reasoning behind this, was what she had to say any  more  interesing than what the other had to say? not really, but as i listened and observed she always used the "catch". it's classic, like fishing with a worm, you have to let him play around and nibble a little bit before you make the snatch. back to people...the "interesting" girl would reveal just enough to draw the attention of the audience and then once they had taken the bait she would reel 'em on in. do people really fall for this!?! i guess so, i was witness to it right there across the dinner table.  maybe it is because it is something i have endured with my mother and have grown to loathe, but if what i am saying isn't interesting enough to at least be listened to then i don't want to talk--another learned trait--i don't want to have to dangle the bait.  i guess if you have made it this far then i should come to a conclusion, it is all about presentation with something like this, the more intriguingly it is presented the more captivated your audience will be. and just because there are people that aren't quite as talented in the presentation of their life doesn't mean their life is not interesting--usually they are the ones with the most fascinating things to say.

      i wonder sometimes if all that we do in our daily lives is the costume of "who" we desire to be, masking who we really are.   how many of us can sit in a room, alone, and be content?   is our constant need to be "juicing it up" or the--if not working then playing-- mentality really a disguise hiding ourself from ourselves.

      as i was driving back from a friends house late friday night, i saw a small apartment complex.  it was well lit and looked clean, but it was smack dab in the "bad part of town".  who is to say that i couldn't live there and be perfectly safe and happy.   in my tired state of mind i got to thinking of our friend sarah who moved here not knowing anything about the city and what kind of neighborhood she was moving into.  when i found out where she was living my initial reaction was to be agast that she would live in such a place.  but really, what does it matter if you live in the "ghetto"?   yes, yes, yes, you do have to be smart and aware of your surroundings to not be nieve and stupid, i am not denying that, but her moving in to that area wasn't going to be a problem because she was not involved in the situations that warrant concern.  it could be a problem for those who are currently involved with or had past involvement with the things that are part of the "ghetto" experience, to be put back into that environment.  so for sarah, being a 'good girl',  there was, and is not, a reason for concern.   so, now that she will be moving out of the "ghetto" and into phase 5, i have come to terms with the fact that she lives(d) in the ghetto.
