      I'm sure that nobody that even reads this cares, but I've finally made my purchase of a boat to live on.  It's an Ericson 27 sailboat.  It needs some work, but she'll be a beauty when I'm finished this fall.  But then again, she'll probably never be finished...

      So I'm reading on  urlLink Wired.com  right now about how Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) wants to pass a law called The  urlLink Inducing Infringement of Copyrights  Act. This law is supposed to protect copyrights by making it illegal for any technology that "induces infringement". It's aimed at Peer-to-Peer networks but aparently from it's vague descriptions, applies to any technology or device that allows someone to violate another's copyright. You can read more about it on Wired...    But my thoughts are this...    I think I'm getting quite sick of special interest groups managing or trying to push legislation through that protects their interest but harms the rest of Americans. If we want to keep people from doing anything illegal, I guess we should take away everything that allows people to break the law. To me that would include guns, cars, telephones, various sharp objects found around the home...     Organizations like SCO and the RIAA are really focused on copyrights and patents, basically because their whole business model revolves around them. They are not so concerned with producing new and innovative products that encourage the consumer to buy more, but are simply ready to sue anyone out of existance that comes to close to imitating them. Why do we still pay $17 for a CD at the store? I was paying that much for them when they first started to get big. I know the cost of the actual production has gone down. And why do the artists only see a small percentage of that price? Oh that's right, to keep the big fat cats in million dollar mansions in Bel Aire somehwere... I forgot...    I'm all about being a capitalist. Go supply and demand! But if people demand lower prices on CD's and you don't give it to them, yeah, you're going to start losing money. Or more appropriately put, just making less because you're ripping everyone off to start with. Don't get me started on broad reaching patents which only have the purpose of allowing companies to sue other companies that compete... Isn't competition supposed to be part of capitalizism?

      I would like to thank anyone who actually reads this...    I've started this blog because I feel disconnected from the one thing that brought me closer to the world.      My story starts in the middle of nowhere. I had very little connection to the outside world living in a rural community in Oregon. When I finally got my first IBM compatible computer (a Packard Bell 486SX 25), I was exciting beyond belief. I thought I was the coolest shit on the block with my 2400 baud modem. I would get on BBS's in Colorado because the long distance was cheaper out of state than in. One day an Internet provider came to town. I couldn't stop myself from riding my bike down to the store to find out more about prices, etc. Luckily for me, there were looking for a good nerd and they hired me soon after.    When I first got on the Internet, chatting was the first thing I was drawn to. Finally, the chance to talk to others with the same interests as me. The people I met on IRC changed my life, opened my eyes. I can't describe the feeling of knowing there were others like me, even members of the opposite sex that were into the same things as me. This connection to the outside world became my obsession.    At this time, the Internet wasn't the commercialized place it is now. Although there wasn't the information available as there is now, there was still a purity to the content. Few people had personal webpages, let alone blogs like this one. Newsgroups actually contained useful information and were generally considered where all of the good info was kept. Search engines were in their infancy.     Fast forward to 2004. Even though this might only be 8 or 10 years later, it feels like forever. I feel lost sitting here in front of my monitors. I jump on to any chat channel, looking for others like me and I'm confronted with bots leading me to sites for sex and webcams. I do a search through Google and I have to sift through 50 sites trying to sell me something before any real information comes up. We are now simply consumers...    Between the spam in my mailbox and the bots I run into on chat channels, all of the personal aspect of the Internet is gone. People have become distrustful and standoffish. Nobody is the friendly, happy to help you individuals they once were. Now we sit and have to consider if the person we are talking to is even a real person or just some stupid program designed to have us click a link to some porn site. Commercialism has killed the community of the Internet.     Sure there are small groups of individuals that wouldn't have met if it wasn't for this great communication medium we have, but if more and more businesses use it to bombard us with stupid offers and more chances to spend our money on stupid stuff, they will kill it.     The Internet is probably one of the most prolific events to happen to mankind since the Industrial Revolution. Technology is now just not a part of lives but integrated into it. I'm starting to get sick of someone trying to capitalize on it...
