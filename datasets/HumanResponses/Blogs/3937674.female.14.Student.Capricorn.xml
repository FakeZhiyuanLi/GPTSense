      This is a fragment of a story I never got very far on... Just putting it up for the heck of it. I gave it up because the relationship between Ather and Lion would be way to far fetched. *********       								Prolouge 							  	A hunter prowled the shadows. The alley was dark, dank, and full of dark nooks and crannies. It looked to be straight out of a cliche. Someone walked briskly through the shadows, as though by her brisk, cold demeanor she could keep away the nightmares that lurked in the shadows. She was a business woman, dressed in a somber suit, and thought that she had grown accustomed to the darkness and undertone of fear that haunted the City. She told herself firmly that The City had one of the lowest crime rates ever, and those...things that were lurking in the shadows were nothing more than exhaustion and remnants of childhood nightmares.  She was perfectly safe. This woman was structured, organized, and prepared for every situation, up to and including attack. She had pepper spray in her purse and a gun at home, but neither were going to save her life now.  	She whirled. A faint noise from behind her left shoulder caught her attention. Shaking slightly, she passed the sound off as nerves. She quickly walked off, and on an instinct began to jog clumsily. Her heels clacked noisily on the pavement, the sound ricocheting off of the clammy walls, masking a faint growling sound that was her only warning. The creature leaped out of the shadows, at his hapless prey. A muffled scream echoed through the night, then all was silent.  *****   	Ai'Renn was a contradiction.  A 22 year old technogeek, college student, closet psychic , and sword enthusiast.  Her name was a bizarre gift from one of her foster parents, remnants of a puzzling childhood, haunted by shadows of reasonless fear.  She had survived highschool, avoiding drinking and drugs, but had been outcast from any semblance of a social group in her freshman year, due to a few slips of the tongue. She hadn't learned the value of discretion, and had revealed information that she couldn't possibly have known. She made it through only by driving herself scholastically to distraction. It was the only way she could escape the fear and loneliness. She had a certain fascination with swords, and after a long time of saving her spare cash, she could afford to buy a middle rate katana, and using books had taught herself Japanese swordwork.  She learned to write computer programs, another of her fascinations, and made a sum of money by doing quality webdesign. This, a well  tended savings account, and a scholarship for academic excellence had sent her off to college, in The City. She found that her tendency toward the macabre was fueled by the darkness of The City. She found herself loving the harsh skyline that the jagged skyscrapers  created. Though The City was highly modern, it had a peculiar trend towards a mixture of mod and gothic styles when it came to architecture and even interior design. Ai'Renn found The City's cool, apathetic darkness calming.    	 	She knew fully well why The City was reported to be so secure. Petty criminals feared what lurked in the shadows.  Murderers of any sort found that their prey had been taken by another predator. And the punishments for crime was to be given to the creatures of the shadows. Many things lurked the streets of The City, few of them friendly. Shifters, vampires, gangs of creatures unnamed. To encounter one was surely death. Which was the reason Ai'Renn was so fascinated with them. Ai'Renn was a hunter. She had discovered her own calling by way of revenge.  Jessica, the only person Ai'Renn had ever loved, had fallen prey to the self styled Merlin, a shifter with a taste for killing. Ai'Renn had hunted Jessica's murderer down, and avenged her. She swore that she would stop something like this from ever happening again, and had immersed herelf in dealing justice to the death dealers that haunted The City's streets.   	Her current target was a complete mystery. There was no pattern to it's violence, just that it hunted in the same area every time. And any other dark creature that entered it's territory came down with a bad case of dead. She had only one choice. Her allies had no information for her, she had no information about this latest batch of brutal murders, only the location of the creatures territory.  She could only go to the place where the others had died, and "read" what had happened. Dangerous, possibly deadly, certainly unpleasant, but the only option. She would not let this crime go on undealt-with. ******* 	Iris pushed her black hair out of her eyes. She put her head in her hands. One more day, she thought. Just one more. School was almost out.  Iris was a junior in highschool, who called herself Ather. She had a haunted look, fire burned in her black eyes, a smoldering spark of madness that threatened to break through. There were dark circles under her eyes. She had a vaguely Asian look to her, was thin, and small.  She dressed in somber black, lined her eyes darkly, hoping to mask the plain tiredness in her eyes. She had taken to wandering at night, in order to escape her home, and on the way, she had found Lion. Lion was a man, sometimes, and others.... no one really wanted to know. She had fallen in love with Lion. He was her Beauty and the Beast dream.  Ather knew she was insane, deep down. Something inside her heart had broken beyond mending. Her life was full of pain, sorrow, grief from the start.  She had Lion, though. Lion kept her sane. Lion couldn't speak, but she understood him. He cared about her, protected her, even when no one else cared.  But the only time she could get away to be with Lion was late at night.  	This is insane. The only person who cares about you is a half -human that can't talk to you. You should have killed yourself ages ago, Ather....

      								Chapter One  	The acrid tang of smoke burned her eyes and made her choke. Sayuri De'Lir crouched behind a half crumbled wall, the only available shelter in a now-burning plain. The raiders seemed to have temporarily disappeared.  They'll be back, she thought grimly. They had systematically slaughtered her family, burning the caravans, looting, pillaging. Murderers, traitors, she cursed them, furious. The Drow held these lands, on the very edge of the Black Vale, in their protection, yet these peasants could be so easily stirred to rebel. It only took a few coins and a silver tongued stranger, and they forgot all oaths, and attacked the next Drow caravan that passed through.  Dropping the sword that guards you, indeed.  	Sayuri had survived, barely. bleeding from a deep cut on her shoulder, she could barely walk, thanks to an ankle injury. Maybe it was broken. But Sayuri was young (very young, Drow lived for hundreds of years, depending on the strength of their magic, and Sayuri was a mere fledgling 17, the Drow adult age, and usually when they stopped showing signs of age) , she was brave, reckless, and on her last wind. She had depleted her mage energies earlier, had ran herself out of even anger-energy, from throwing any form of combative magic she had at the raiders. Sayuri cried silently for her family, and from the smoke that was obscuring her vision and choking the air from her lungs.  She heard the shriek of warhorses in the distance, and brought herself  forcibly back to reality.   	Alright, you got to think. These peasants are to well trained and armed to have rebelled without help. Think, Sayuri! The Drow have enemies, they could have incited the commoners to revolt. So where does that leave you? It hurt to think, she was tired, drained, weak. Her weapons were gone, except for her long witch-knife that she kept with her in an arm sheath always. It was a beautiful weapon, crafted by the Mage-Smiths of the Drow, balanced perfectly for throwing, razor sharp, and drenched in protective magick. But it hadn't been enough to save her family. Tears threatened to start again.  Focus, Sayuri, she tried to fight tears down, and shook her head to clear it. You've got to make a run for the Black Vale, you'll be safe enough there . But it's leagues from here... Curse it, I have a job to do! I've got an oath to the Vale, I have to warn them! This reeks of outside interference, not just the usual peasant revolt. I've....  	She was so absorbed that she didn't hear the horses approaching on the otherside of the wall, didn't notice the jingling of very fine armor. And didn't even get a chance to notice that a pommel of a knife, decorated with an 'A' in rubies, had suddenly met the back of her skull, with a certain amount of force. The world went black, and a small, midnight-haired drow collapsed behind the remnants of a ruined fort wall. *** 	She awoke, freezing, on an icy marble floor. She fought down panic, and surveyed her surroundings.  "Where am I?" she managed to croak. Her throat was ravaged, but it felt like it would heal. She felt for the source of a thudding pain in her head, and her hand came away bloody. Her hair was matted hopelessly from the wound in her shoulder, which apparently had scabbed over. Her ankle didn't bear thinking about. She tried to struggle upright, and everything swam again, and she passed out.  	When she came to, there was a pitcher of water beside her, and a blanket folded up next to it. Sayuri shivered, and grabbed for the blanket.  Everything was fogged, she was in a daze, where the world was on fire and burning her, but she still froze. Wound fever, something in her memory told her, from far off. She gingerly propped herself up against the wall. That small effort left her gasping.  She reached for the pitcher, carefully, slowly, and took a sip from the water. It was clear,clean, and tasted faintly of herbs. That helped to dismiss the fog in her head a little. Odd way to treat a captured enemy, she thought. Unless it's poisoned. In which case I don't care.  She drank a little more, wrapped herself up in the blanket, and drifted into unconciousness.  	She had recovered enough to dream, at least. She drifted through faraway dreamscapes. She watched a young drow with Sayuri's hair and her face, but different eyes in a band of mishmash travelers, and watched this strangely familiar girl fight her way through hordes of enemies, with another girl who looked half drow and half wood nymph. She heard the nymphish girl speak to the drow. "Celeblaithwen. We're running out of time..." with a dreadful urgency in her voice.  The faces wavered, and for a moment she was Celeblaithwen, and the other girl was standing over her, saying,  "Get up!  Quickly, move NOW!"  	Sayuri woke with a start. Someone was shouting at her. 	"Get up ! Don't just sit there, you little ninny, up!" a harsh faced young woman stared at her, a servant by her dress.  "Ugh. They shouldn't have wasted the energy to heal a useless little Drow wench like you.  No, here the dark elves are no better than any others, oh no. Don't think your heritage is going to get you anywhere her, no, no, no."  The woman's voice was harsh, cold, and had a tone of madness in it. Sayuri stood up for lack of any other choice. She noticed that she didn't seem fevered anymore, she could walk on her ankle again, and she would be willing to be that her shoulder had healed, too. That was what the maid had meant, about healing her. Memory came back. She remembered the raid, and being knocked out by the soldier. She vaguely remembered her imprisonment, and the rat faced apprentice healer who had bungled the job of healing her shoulder, gave her the wound fever, and didn't even try to fix her ankle.    	Someone else must have finished the job,she thought as the maid ushered her down the halls. She was suddenly acutely aware that she was still very grimy. Revulsion crawled along her skin like a spider. Sayuri shuddered. But fortunately, the maid seemed to be taking her to a bathingroom.It was a relatively small room, with a sunk in bathing pool. It seemed to have some kind of complex filtering system, similar to the ones in the Drow cities. She maid left her in there with a small bundle, that she found out had clothes, soap, a towel, a brush, and the witch-knife. She was surprised, but quickly stripped off her filthy rags. She scoured off what felt like (and could possibly have been) weeks worth of grime.Wringing out her still-tangled hair, she pulled on the provided clothing.  It was black breeches, a highnecked tawny undershirt, and a black wrap-around garment, similar to a robe, but more like the wrap dresses that had once been popular amongst Drow nobility. It was embroidered in red rosepetals, and had a tawny sash that tied around the back that was decorated with black and red dragons.  She looked in the reflecting glass in surprise. It was very well made clothing, allowing for the aesthetic as well as freedom of movement. There's something rather odd about this, she thought.  Very odd. I ought to have been locked in a dungeon for monthes, starved, allowed to die of wound fever, but after extensive questioning and torture. Why are they treating me like some kind of mildly unwelcome dignitary, unpleasant, but still worthy of some respect? She pondered this as she surveyed her hopelessly snarled hair. She sighed. there was only one thing to do for it. While her hair was still wet, she grabbed her witch-knife, unsheathed it, and began hacking at her hair.  When she was finished, all that was left of her beautiful, waist-length midnight colored hair was an uneven, layered looking, mass of slightly longer than shoulder length hair that framed her face like a shadowy headdress. It almost suited her. She surveyed herself in the mirror. Gaunt, thin, dark skinned Drow girl, with uneven hair and huge crystalline eyes that looked like black veined diamonds, and were just as hard. She was too skeletal to be beautiful, too sharp featured to be pretty.   	"Hurry up! You've got two seconds to get out here before I go in there and drag you out!" The crazy maid interrupted Sayuri's ill timed reverie. She blushed a little at the thought of staring moodily into a mirror during a captive situation. It must be an after effect of the healing potions. I wouldn't normally be this frivolous. No, not frivolous, idiotic. They're trying to put you at ease, fool you into feeling secure. And it almost worked didn't it? Idiot. Disgusted with herself, she shoved her knife into her sash, and headed out, warily. The maid had a wicked grin on her harsh face.  "You think it's all going to be easy,hmm? I hope they teach you little girls to fight in the Black Vale," she spat, as though the words were distasteful. "Oh yes, you'll not last five minutes if they didn't," she chuckled wickedly, with no humor. Sayuri had a temper, though, as much as she tried to remain proud and silent, her anger burst forth in a stream of carefully controlled motion. She pulled her knife from  her sash, caught the maid off guard, and had her pinned against the stone walls with the witch-knife at her throat.  	"Hold your tongue or lose it." Sayuri said in a soft, icy cold and silky  voice. She spoke in Drow, not in Common,  but the meaning was clear enough. 	"Heh heh heh, they won't like to hear that she's threatening the maids, will they? They'll be sure to kill the Drow brat now, for certain." Sayuri made a sound of disgust and let the mad servant go.  She followed her down the halls. It wouldn't do any good to kill the maid, not when she was armed only with a knife in an unfamiliar fortress. She couldn't call for help with mindspeach, either. Anyone who would aid her was out of range, and the very walls of this place were sheilded. 	 	The maid turned a sharp corner, and two guards in burnished mail stood, one on either side of the door, each holding a wicked looking halberd. The maid ducked back into the shadows, but the guards signalled for Sayuri to step forward. They rapped sharply on  the floor with the metal capped ends of their halberds. The doors swung open, and Sayuri stepped into a moon-filled courtyard. An audience watched from a grove of trees on one of the lawns. In the center of the courtyard was a fighting ring. Just a circle of chalk on the clean swept marble square. On the left side of the ring was a weapons rack, and a small tent. On the right was a weapons rack and water stand. A few guards stood on each side, possibly to prevent interference. A pampered blonde woman in mage-robes stood off to one side, looking bored. A stand faced Sayuri and the entry way on the opposite side of the ring, and four richly dressed people with a look of those in power about them surveyed her with interest.  	"Sayuri De'Lir of the Black Vale, you have been sentenced to trial by combat. Should you refuse, you will be allowed to choose the manner of your death," Small comfort that is, Sayuri thought wryly, as a herald for the nobles at the stand spoke. " Should you accept, you will have until the hour of midnight, to prepare yourself. Facilities have been provided," the herald gestured at the tent. From that time on, you will face opponents, one at a time, until sunrise or your death." The slightly superior expression on the nobles' (who appeared to be her judges) faces told her which ending they thought likeliest. "In between opponents, you will be able to rest the amount of time it takes for the next opponent to prepare themselves or one hour. Do you agree to the terms?"  	Sayuri nodded, her face fixed into a coldly impassive mask. She would not let them know that she felt the icy hand of death on her shoulder, or that she knew that the odds of her survival were slim. 	"You have one hour to prepare." The herald said, smirking. Sayuri bowed respectfully at the nobles, then stalked off to her tent. ** 	Inside the tent, Sayuri was formulating aplan. She had spent the first fifteen minutes or so calming down, and settling into what her arms instructor had laughingly called 'Warrior-Vision'. She could now put aside most of her emotions and think tactically. She knew that the likeliest course of action was to send out the weakest fighters first. This would not only wear her down, but test her skills so that the more expert challengers knew what to expect, or kill her outright by sheer luck (or sheer incompetence on Sayuri's part). then they would send out the more advanced fighters after her, they'd have a better chance of eliminating her, as they would be fresh and Sayuri wearing down. So that means that I have to play dumb, if I can. Or at the least, let my opponents wear themselves out and spare my energy. She took a deep breath.   	Sayuri nibbled on a little bit of bread, so that she wouldn't get the shakes during a match, but not enough to make her cramp up, either. She mostly drank some water then examined her clothing more closely. She removed the wrap-around robe, and carefully hung it upon one of the tent poles. On closer inspection, the shirt had detachable sleeves, which she removed. The sleeves then were reattached, but to the back of her shirt, where they criss-crossed across her lower back and stomach and were secured to her breeches, to prevent her shirt from flying around. Her breeches had laces around the ankles, which she tightened. They had not seen fit to provide her with shoes, so she went without. Not like it's much of a disadvantage. I'm more comfortable barefoot, anyway, and the ring is marble. And if any of them try any hand-to-hand tricks, they'll be disqualified. She retied the sash, and placed her knife securely in it. I can't use it in the matches, but if I get into a tight spot, I might be able to use it to make a run for it. I have no idea where I'd run to but it never hurts, I guess... That taken care of, she stretched out, and warmed up her muscles.  	Finished, Sayuri stepped outside of the tent, to view the weapons. Halberds, axes, spears, and a peculiar implement that was a long, scythe-like blade atop a five foot long stout pole. A glaive, she thought. A broadsword,  a straight blade, a short sword, and a sabre. The sabre caught her eye. It had an interesting curve to it, and looked somehow familiar.  She pulled it off the rack, and read the fading inscriptions. The blade claimed to be for Celare Da'Redin, the famed Drow princess who had given up her title in order to lead the Drow armies against invasion. She had saved the Black Vale, and regained the Sunsrise Mines. This sword was finely made, old, but still deadly. It had a wicked edge, and an excellent balance. Even in it's slightly run down state, it would be worth more than a city. Her captors obviously couldn't read Drow, if they left it in a weapons rack for a lowly prisoner's trial by combat. Sayuri smiled. The blade would do nicely. Slowly at first, composing her face into an impassive mask again, she began to practice, to get the feel of the sword.  **  	Sayuri De'Lir was being watched by more than one onlooker, but one was more important than others. 	"What do you think, my lord?" the watcher's companion said. 	"She's studied swordwork before, though she's tryingto hide it.  She's doing cheap sword-dancer tricks right now, you see, so that the amateur fools will overestimate her, and the masters will underestimae her. Clever, but not infallible. If you carefully observe, you'll notice that her body positioning is perfect. She balances the sword perfectly. Ah, look here." The watcher pointed. 	 	"What am I looking for, my lord Aikane?" 	"Look closely. She about to launch into a  very complicated maneuver, that will end her practice session, and will through the future opponents off track." Sayuri rotated her wrist, spinning the sword, used the momentum to bring it up over her head, brought it down in a reverse thrust. She then switched her hands around, flipped the sword back forward, dropped into a crouching roundhouse, and ended in a graceful lunge. "You see?" Aikane said, "Perfectly predictable, to the trained eye."  	"Will you face her, then? She'll be no match for you." 	" That depends entirely on how long she lives."  ** 	A bell cried somewhere in the distance. Midnight. Sayuri felt a chill of fear. Time's up. She watched her first opponent select a weapon. The figure chose a halberd. That was good, Sayuri's sabre was light enough to be maneuvered quickly, and dart in past the large pole weapon. Her challenger now in sight, she saw that it was a boy, perhaps a little younger than herself. She inwardly sighed with disgust. He was too small, and didn't have nearly enough in the way of muscle to handly the large halberd. He was trying to be impressive, and failing miserably.  	She stepped into the ring, and felt a mage barrier go up. The blonde sorceress no longer looked sleepy, she looked alert. The two fighters moved to the center, and heard  a shout of ,"Begin!" Sayuri danced away, knowing that he would have to begin with a swing. He was slow, clumsy, and not very skilled. She stepped around his second swing and rapped him on the skull with the pommel of her sword. He collapsed, unconcious.  	 That was the first, and the easiest. As the night wore on, she faced a woman with a two bladed sword, two twin sisters with wicked skill with blades. They had come within an inch of beheading her, she had managed to disarm them only by luck. An older soldier with a two headed axe had proved troublesome. Once, a younger man, a fencer, had proved an ill-tempered loser. She had swatted the blade out of his hand, and assuming that he would withdraw peacefully, she had seen only a brief flicker of steel. She ducked instinctively. A razor-sharp throwing knife bounced off of the mage shields, inches from her. Sayuri did not hesitate to run him through.,She noted calmly, as she cleaned her blade, the audiences' shock. she had only rendered her previous opponents unconcious, or disarmed them. Sayuri had upped the stakes.  	She was wearing down. None of the other matches were as easy as the first, and she was begining to wilt. Sayuri was a vicious fighter, but she had little in the way of stamina. Fortunately for her, the sky was a predawn grey as she prepared to face her next opponent.  However, it wouldn't be over until the sun itself was visible. She turned to face her challenger. The figure wore black, partially armored clothes that were well made, and a mask that was part helm. He was holding a mace. It was not the usual style of mace, however. It was smaller, more compact, with spikes. And it was on a chain. 	 	The mage barrier went up again, and Sayuri was sick with fear. Her hands were clammy and her grip was slipping.  The sun was rising soon, in would be a few more minutes until it was visible. Maybe she could last long enough. The herald cried," Begin!" and the masked opponent began swinging his mace slowly above his head, gaining force and speed. His stance was perfect, balanced, and utterly tuned to the task at hand.  Survive that. Right, and be crowned Empress while I'm at it. That can go on my list of impossible things to accomplish. Uh-oh. Sayuri leapt out of the way as the man altered the swing of the mace and fed it out towards her with a kick, missed, then drew in back smoothly into a steady swing. She took a moment to note that if she survived this, she was going to learn to use a mace like that. It would have been a thing of beauty,a joy to watch in action, this weapon, if it hadn't had her impending doom written all over it. 	He sent the heavy ball out again, and this time she was so worn down and preoccupied that she didn't have time to dodge and the mace hit her squaredly in the chest. Sayuri fell flat on her back, gasping for air, desperetly trying to fight back the excruciating pain enough to fill her lungs again. Her sword clattered to the ground, and everything went black. Her last coherent thought was not very coherent at all, but a plaintive wish as blackness swallowed her up that the sun had risen sooner. ** 	"Broken ribs, bruised lungs, sternum cracked. A real mess, this one. " A detached voice noted, rousing her from darkness. A soft touch on her chest brought agony, and she lost conciousness again. She regained wakefulness sooner this time, feeling achy and weak, and slightly short of breath, but otherwise well enough. She was laying on the ground, anxious faces peering at her from above. She struggled to her feet. Then the memory of why she was there hit her like  brick. Oh gods, she thought. I lost.  						Chapter Two 	The crowd around her thinned as an unhappy noble stode up to her. He had the look of a child who's favorite toy had been taken away. "Sayuri De'Lir has been declared and fairly tried by combat amongst witnesses of good standing. While she was disarmed in the final match before the sun had completely risen, it was visible at the time of disarmament and therefore Lady De'Lir completed the trial successfully by the word of the law. However, the spirit of the law says that she did not pass. As the judges were unable to come to a sure verdict, we have decided to allow her to keep her life and remain amongst us as a probationary. Unless a full member of this community should sponsor Lady De'Lir, she will be confined to specific quarters and areas of the-"  	"I will sponsor Lady De'Lir." A ringing voice called out, cutting off the pomous old noble's rattling. The noble looked up in surprise, then shook his head. 	"Fully and of your own will, my lord Aikane?" Sayuri looked up to the sourceof the voice and saw in surprise that it was her last opponent, the one that had nearly killed her. 	" Of my own free will, I swear to sponsor and protect Lady Sayuri De'Lir. I take full responsibility of her and any harm she may cause." Harm! She fumed inwardly.I've just been practically sold to a man who tried to kill me, and now they're accusing me of causing harm when they raided our wagons and killed my family and- 	"Sayuri De'Lir, is this agreeable to you?" She hesitated. Being sponsored would give her acces to most of the citadel, but it could be a bad situation. If she went as a probationary, she would be confined to one of the worst places in the citadel, she knew, but it was better than having someone else responsible for her. Hurry up and say yes, you silly girl, and I'll get you out of here. Aikane spoke in her mind. On your honor? she asked suspiciously. Yes, on my honor, now hurry up! She voiced her assent.

      This one's for writing. Stories, WIPS, stuff about writing. And if you happen to recognize the names in the title and the address, it's because I'm on a serious Heralds of Valdemar-fest. But, my regular blog will still be at www.yozakura.blogspot.com  Soooo. I'm going to post some things that I'm working on here, such as character profiles, the stories that I'm working on, maaps for the particular worlds that I'm "building".  That being the great thing about writing fantasy. Once you get a story or two out, and the basic world principles set up, you get to play.

      I'm going to Fresno in about....*checks calendar* 3 days. I'm soooo excited *bounces*.  I get to hang out with Michelle, and play Baldur's Gate 2, and go see Spiderman 2 and King Arthur. (Kiera Knightley is my hero).  I got my friend Collette's YIM address last night in karate, so I can find out what sort or gear I might need. Those armiesse (spelling, anyone?) sticks are awesome. My sliding side kick is much better. I kept crossing over in the recover, like I was trying to do a fourth position. Two & 1/2 years of balllet coming back to haunt me.  I really need to learn how to do slap downs. That is, falling properly.  The cool thing about this is that it does have an effect on your self confidence. I figured that was all fitness guru crap at first, but it actually isn't. You become more social, more confident, and you figure out how to analyze situations better. It's awesome.   Bizarre, though.
