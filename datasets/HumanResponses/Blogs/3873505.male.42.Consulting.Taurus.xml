      Yeah, I've been slacking, not posting.  Thought for the day:  Puritan = Someone who lies awake at night worrying that someone, somewhere might be having a good time.

      Comedian commentary on the campaign:   "The Tonight Show with Jay Leno":   "Here's something shocking according to the latest issue of Newsweek magazine: The Bush administration officials are reviewing a proposal that would allow for the postponement of the presidential election in the event of a catastrophe. You know, like Kerry winning."   "I love that the Department of Homeland Security always tells Americans if you don't fly commercial airlines, 'the terrorists have won.' If you don't hold the Super Bowl or the World Series, 'the terrorists have won.' If you don't get out to the mall and do your Christmas shopping, 'the terrorists have won.' Comes time for the election, 'Oh, let the terrorists have that one."'

      Remember just before the 2000 election, when conservative alarmists said that Clinton was going to declare martial law and stay president?  How about something to truly  urlLink fear ?

      This is my 25th year of playing Dungeons and Dragons. This is also D&D's 30th anniversary. Here is one of the few articles I have seen in mainstream press that covers it:  urlLink D&D

      A million years ago, a tribe of early humans were sitting in front of their cave, watching the sun go down.  Gorg: Ugh, dark comes. Sleep soon. Murg: Me not tired. Gorg: Hunt tomorrow. We wake when sun appears in sky. Murg: That's too early. Why not sleep until we wake ourselves. We don't have appointments to go to. Why hurry? Gorg: I lead. I say we get up with sun. Murg: This sucks.  It may not have happened exactly like that, but one thing I am sure of: I am a direct descendent of Murg, not Gorg.

      I saw a t-shirt at the latest  urlLink Origins  gaming convention: "Anime - Drugs Would Be Cheaper". I have to agree.   urlLink Twelve Kingdoms  - Incredible. Your usual Japanese students transported to a fantasy world, but with realism, detail, and grit. Highly recommended.

      I have over 500 DVDs in my collection. I do not wish to contemplate the monetary cost of such a crazy thing, but I can tell you a bit about the psychological price I have paid. I'm referring, of course, to the accursed stickers placed along the edge of the packaging, allegedly to deter theft.  Budding DVD thieves take note. If you want to steal a DVD, just use one of the many handy-dandy razor openers to quickly slice the top, opening side, and bottom of the packaging. This will, of course, cut through the aforementioned stickers. Then simply pop the case open, put the disc itself in your coat (that  is  what you came here to steal, right?), place the now empty DVD case back on the rack, and whistle your way out of the store, not a care in the world.  Law enforcement, take note. I have never stolen a DVD, and don't intend to...  So what good do those maddening stickers do? Do they deter theft? Absolutely not. They only punish the actual paying customers. If you want to protect DVDs from theft, I suggest an RFID tag embedded  in  the DVD disc itself. End of problem, folks.  If I ever meet the person who invented those stickers, and the stupid "suit" who decided to make them even more fragile now, I'm going to be spending some jail time after I beat them until candy falls out. I think the bastard should have to come to my house every time I buy a DVD and take the stickers off, without damaging the case.  End of Rant.

      Where to begin?  Unlike a lot of people, as I get older, I actually think less of the past and more about the here and now, and about the future. I'm not going to write constantly about days gone by, or about how much more simple the world was when I was growing up. Looking back on their childhood causes a lot of people to gloss over the bad things, the emotional stresses they suffered at the hands of parents, bullies, and teachers. I have plenty of bitter feelings stored up, but I don't see the sense in dragging them out to burden other people with.  I don't read blogs. The closest I come is Eric Alterman's fine piece of work on MSNBC, and no, I'm not going to offer you a link. I tried to find an easy one for him and gave up. If you're looking for links, you're in the wrong blog. So, I don't have a lot of preconceived notions about what a blog should be, how long a post should be, what to say and not to say. Perhaps this is for the best. I don't know if anyone will actually take the time to read my ramblings, but if someone is, welcome to my nightmare. I think you're gonna like it...
