      This weekend is gonna be great....BEACH!!  hopefully i'll come back not looking like a lobster, haha.  It's gonna be so much fun because my sis ;-) is going.  Woohoo!!  Today was good...got to spend some time with Mom, which is always good.  She's pretty cool most of the time.  I didn't get to go to the Y though, which kinda made me mad..I wanted to go work out.  But hopefully I'll get to tomorrow.  And maybe go swim too.  Well, I think I'm gonna get off here and go do some reading.  Do something productive for once, haha.  :)   its for you that I'm on my knees now daily praying praying that God opens your eyes now to what I'm relaying now I'm praying that it's your heart that will soon be changing praying one day that you'll be calling upon his name... and even though now it really might sound redundant God's got mad love for you up in a mad abundance... till then one love, one God, one way  ^KJ-52 "Dear Slim"   Later  <>

      Ahh, that is what summer is for!  Sleeping 'til lunch, getting up and doing nothing at all.  It's great...makes me want to never go back to school again, haha.  Youth was really cool tonight..we talked about our upcoming mission trip to KY.  I'm so excited!!  It'll be my first mission trip ever, and it sounds like so much fun...we're gonna be working with little kids the entire time..we're doing a vacation Bible school, and the theme is sports!  WOOHOO!!  I can't wait!  Going to the beach this weekend, and megan's coming too!  It's gonna be great.  SUMMERTIME!!  Good song that I just heard...   Oh cuz I don't know I don't know what he's after But he's so beautiful Such a beautiful disaster And if I could hold on Through the tears and the laughter Would it be beautiful?  Or just a beautiful disaster ^"Beautiful Disaster" - Kelly Clarkson -------- And because this song is also cool, it has to be put in here:   There's a place off Ocean Avenue Where I used to sit and talk with you We were both 16 and it felt so right Sleeping all day, staying up all night Staying up all night  There's a place on the corner of Cherry Street  We would walk on the beach in our bare feet We were both 18 and it felt so right Sleeping all day, staying up all night Staying up all night  If I could find you now things would get better We could leave this town and run forever Let your waves crash down on me and take me away  There's a piece of you that's here with me It's everywhere I go, it's everything I see When I sleep, I dream and it gets me by I can make believe that you're here tonight That you're here tonight  If I could find you now things would get better We could leave this town and run forever I know somewhere, somehow we'll be together Let your waves crash down on me and take me away  I remember the look in your eyes When I told you that this was goodbye You were begging me not tonight Not here, not now We're looking up at the same night sky And keep pretending the sun will not rise  Be together for one more night Somewhere, somehow  If I could find you now things would get better We could leave this town and run forever I know somewhere, somehow we'll be together Let your waves crash down on me and take me away ^"Ocean Avenue" - Yellowcard    Later  <>

      You know, I am a firm believer in the fact that nothing is coincidental...everything happens for a reason.  And sometimes, you don't see that reason at first, only God does.  But usually, you figure out why He had you go through a certain situation, or meet a specific person, or move to a particular city.  Sometimes I think about that..I wonder why I ended up in hickory.  Or why I ended up going to Foard.  Why I had to leave charlotte.  Why my group of friends has changed so much in the past year, or even six months.  Some of these things I've sorta figured out..and others, i have yet to discover.  Alright, enough of that thinking stuff.  Today was awesome.  I went to the Y, had a really good workout, saw some people from school..went to the library...went home to shower...went to go see Shrek 2 with Audrey, Megan, and Alex - and it was SO FUNNY!  It was equally as good as the first Shrek.  Wow.  I laughed so freggin hard.  Then after the movie, we all had yet another good laugh when megan about peed her pants b/c of something we won't discuss in here, haha.  HAHA meg, "those 8th graders, tisk tisk.." - you KNOW they were checking us out, mmhmm.  RIGHT, lol.  No one checks me out, remember?  Haha.  Good times, good times.  And SOOO many more to come.....lol..Folly Beach, SC and Pineville, KY, LOOK OUT AND TAKE COVER!!  they will never be the same.  Wow, you can tell that it's really late, haha.  I think I'll get off here and go do some reading.    If you want to I can save you I can take you away from here So lonely inside So busy out there And all you wanted was somebody who cares  ^"All You Wanted" - Michelle Branch    Later  <>

      This song applies to my life so much right now.  I just want to please God and make him proud of me.  And I want so bad to make a difference in someone's life...to really show them the love of God, and hopefully lead the way to Him.  That's my top priority this summer and the next school year.    I wanna be beautiful Make you stand in awe Look  inside my heart And be amazed I want to hear you say Who I am is quite enough I just want to be worthy of love and beautiful  Sometimes I wish that I was someone other then me Fighting to make the mirror happy Trying to find whatever is missing Dont you help me back to love me ^"Beautiful" - Bethany Dillon    Later  <>  Btw, Benny B..I'm so sorry for all that you're dealing with right now.  I'm praying for you buddy.  Remember, the clock doesnt matter...you can call me anytime you need to talk.  Keep your head up, things will look better tomorrow.

      This day has seemed eternal, my goodness.  I was awakened WAY TOO EARLY by bo and andrew...DAH!!  That started me off on the wrong foot, being as i didn't go to bed until 4:15.  Then, we left the house LATE (which is one of my BIGGEST pet-peeves).  We went to the mall, and it was so crowded...which made it frustrating, along with some other things that i wont discuss in here..but i did end up getting a new pair of jeans and a necklace.  Then when i got home, I had to go babysit.  It's crazy, the one day that i go over to the norkets' house frustrated, the kids are horrible.  They didn't listen to a word i said, AND the parents were an hour and 45 minutes LATE!!!  I was so mad.  DAH!!!  But hey, I know that somehow, today could've ended up so much worse than it did.  Still, i'm reallly thankful that God got me through it...and I didn't lose my temper once!  Lol.  ANYWAY..I'm gonna go to bed so I can be well rested for a MUCH better day tomorrow. :)   Good lyrics:  I see you standing there  I see a tear in your eye  Why’d you turn away  Why’d you run  Run til this point of breaking   No walking away You were the one  That I looked to  I never thought  I’d see you run  I never thought I’d see you  Turn your back on  All you knew was right  You turned your back on God  I see you’re back again  You’ll never run again  This time  No walking away  ^"This Time" - Kutless   Later  <>

      What a day...last day at good ol' Foard.  Like I said before, most people won't cross my mind again after today.  But there are a certain few that, without them, life would be bland and somewhat empty.  I just don't know.  Well, I'm gonna get off here and go do some thinking.   Lyrics of the moment:  Everything I have in mind It begins to fade away I searched for it and I longed for it And now I know it's gone Everything has slipped away And I'm so overwhelmed Everything that rests upon my shoulders fell I would like to tell anyone who has depended on me for themselves, I'm sorry And everyone I've held in my arms I believed I've pushed away I would be there if I could be there But as it stands, I'm gone Everyone has slipped away Don't be overwhelmed Everyone that loved me more than I could tell, I'm sorry There's a private hell for anyone who lives to only love themselves Everyone has slipped away Everyone has slipped away Everyone has slipped away Everything has slipped away  ^The Juliana Theory - "As It Stands"   Later  <>

      WOOHOO!!  I just finished by last exam, so I am DONE until August 9th!  Score and a half...now if only I had a job, haha.  Anyway..after I get out of here, me and Meg are gonna hang out for the rest of the day.  Bo's having a birthday party at the Y at 5, and then after that, Meg and I are going to Atlanta Bread to meet some people.  :)  It'll be cool.  You know, this is my last day ever at Foard.  Most of the people here won't ever cross my mind again.  But there are a few that I won't ever forget...and it's going to be the hardest thing I've ever done to leave them.  They know who they are.    And even though the moment passed me by I still can't turn away I saw the dreams you never thought you'd lose tossed along the way Letters that you never meant to send lost or thrown away And now we're grown up orphans that never knew their names Don't belong to no one that's a shame You could hide beside me maybe for a while and I won't tell no one your name I won't tell em' your name Scars are souvenirs you never lose , the past is never far Did you lose yourself somewhere out there , did you get to be a star Don't it make you sad to know that life is more than who we are You grew up way too fast and now there's nothing to believe And reruns all become our history A tired song keeps playing on a tired radio and I won't tell no one your name I won't tell em' your name I think about you all the time But I don't need the same It's lonely where you are come back down, and I won't tell em your name ^Goo Goo Dolls - "Name"  Later  <>

      It's crazy..today started out really badly, but it got so much better as time went on.  First off, I overslept, had to rush around to get ready for school, most likely failed my exam once i got there, AND had to go with Mom to gastonia to get her car fixed.  But oh man, after all that happened, everything improved:  1. The sky got un-cloudy and the sun came out :) 2. I realized that I don't have to go to school tomorrow. 3. Dad got back from out-of-town. 4. I got to listen to my favorite CD and sing at the top of my lungs all the way home from gastonia. 5. I realized that things could be so much worse!!  God has been so good to me for 16 whole years..and it gets better every day. :):):)   Lyrics of the Moment:  "Echo" - Trapt  I think about your face And how I fall into your eyes The outline that I trace Around the one that I call mine Time that called for space Unclear where you drew the line I don't need to solve this case And I don't need to look behind  Close my eyes Let the whole thing pass me by There is no time To waste asking why  So I'll run away with you by my side I need to let go of this pride Until this echo in my mind  Before this echo can subside Do I expect to change The past I hold inside With all the words I say Repeating over in my mind Some things you can't erase No matter how hard you try An exit to escape Is all there is left to find    Later  <>

      Just came back from running, and I don't feel so great..but at least I only have to go to review today.  Then after that, I'm gonna come home and probably go back to bed for a while, only to wake up and study some more, woohoo!!  LOL.  Speaking of studying, if anybody's taken physical science EOC and wants to give me some helpful hints in what to study, it would be GREATLY appreciated, lol.   Lyrics stuck in my head:  With a fresh sense of purpose and direction We cannot hide now from ourselves In disguises all our own Still we can't escape at all We run from things that can be seen... I won't run from this world Only our faces hide The quiet defeat inside Only our faces show Reflections of so much more  "Only Our Faces Hide" - Beloved   Later :)  <>

      I decided to get up early tomorrow and go run...even though I COULD sleep late.  Oh well, I need to be getting in shape for volleyball season..:)  Lyrics that I have stuck in my head:  I wish you would step back from that ledge my friend You could cut ties with all the lies That you've been living in And, if you do not want to see me again I would understand  That's a good song..and really easy to play on guitar too, might I add.  Gonna go rest up so I can hit the pavement in the morning. :)  Later  <>

      WOOHOO!!  Today concluded my daily suffering with the insane, bipolar, tantrum-throwing Coach Crites!!  I'm so happy to be outta there.  Holy goonies.  Oh man, and today in Mrs. Foote's class, we got to watch Ice Age, which I'd never seen before...and it was sooo funny!  It was great...me and Florin were passing notes across the room like the entire time..until Mrs. Foote caught me, lol.  But we kept doing it even after that.  Then in 4th, all I did was talk to people.  After school, I was almost in a wreck (haha, j/k, but I did have a close call)..then I got home, had some oreos, debated on whether or not to go running, decided not to, and played some piano.  :)  I'm so glad that I don't have to go to school until 10:30 tomorrow (for exam review)..that means extra sleep!  :)  Ahh, life is good.

      Woohoo!!  Tomorrow I go to school for ONE class period..and then I'm going home.  We aren't doing diddly-squat the rest of the day (some gay senior awards ceremony deal is planned, but why would a sophemore wanna go??).  Plus, my grandma is here, and I want to spend some time with her.  PLUS, it's the very end of the year, and i only have 1 absence per class.  SO...i've decided that it will be a great day for shopping. :)  Have a great day tomorrow, everybody!!  Later  <>

      Today has been somewhat upsetting...we got our yearbooks, and all I've been able to think about is how much i'm gonna miss everybody next year.  Man, I don't know what I'm going to do.  There's only one answer to this........this HAS to be the absolute BEST summer ever!  :)  You know, it's really weird how just one person can either make or break your day.  Just a smile from them, or a simple "hey", or even just a wave...it can make everything else seem alright for a minute or two.  And on the other hand, all it takes is a certain person not talking to you, or giving you one not-so-nice look, or acting like they don't want to talk to you...it can make just about everything seem bad.  I don't know, maybe I just let some particular people get to me too easily.  :/  I know, that sounds really stupid.  But it's true.  Some people just mean a lot to me and they're always going to whether we're "together" or not.  You know, I don't even care about that.  Again, this sounds so stupid, but my one wish is that everything will be ok before I have to leave for Charleston.  WELL, I'd better get off of here because I've got early dismissal in a few minutes for softball...we're playing at Kings Mountain today at 4:30.  Later  <>

      Just 2 more weeks, and I'm outta here...for the summer, that is.  Ahh, i can't wait.  This summmer's gonna be great.  I'm going on a mission trip to Pineville, KY in June, going to the beach at some point (maybe with Megan), and moving to Charleston probably in late July.  I'm not exactly looking forward to the last part, but it'll be alright.  I feel like God's telling me that it's where He wants me and my family.  It really is a good situation for my rents and Bo.  We've got a game today (at home) against HHS...we'd better win, haha.  They're horrible.  Hey, maybe I'll actually get to play today, that'd be a nice change, lol.  Well, I'm gonna go for now being as I am in computer class at the moment.  By the way, happy birthday Benny B!!  :)  Later

      Ever have one of those days where everything that you hear or see reminds you of the lyrics to a particular song?  Well I have those days quite often, and today was one of them.  It's cool, sometimes a certain song comes to mind whenever i see a particular person.  Like for a certain SOMEONE, i think of these lyrics:  You've got the most unbelievable blue eyes I've ever seen You've got me almost melting away ^"I love you always forever" - Donna Lewis ;-)  It was also one of those days when even when something really made me mad, i got over it quickly..maybe it's because i was thinking about "someone" all day, who knows.  i can only hope that he was and is doing the same.  Well, I'm gonna go watch a movie...God bless!  Later  <>  P.S. Benny B-feel better!!

      I had a really good day today..after I got home from meg's house, bo and i went to cvs for a bit.  Soon after we got home, mom and dad came in (they'd been in charlotte).  I later went to go get a haircut (and it turned out aight for once, haha), and then came home to pick up dad and go to the Y, where I had a great workout.  :-)  after i got home, dad and bo left for bo's baseball practice, and i stayed home with mom.  i cooked dinner all by myself!  and didnt' screw up!!  haha, anyone who knows me well at all knows i can't cook worth a flip..but that all changed today!  and i even made dessert!  sure they were slice-and-bake pillsburys, but who cares?  at least i didn't burn them to a crisp this time.  oh goodness, i can be quite the spaz.  but hey, it's all good.  and after dinner, i went up and played guitar for a while until i decided to call jordan, which of course he's never home, he's got a life unlike his best friend, lol.  so i didn't get to talk to him, but i called meg soon after, which is always cool.  haha, she and i could talk for like centuries.  but anyway, i'm gonna get off here...there's a certain guy i need to go spend some time with, just me and Him.  :-D  Later  <>  Draw me close to You Never let me go I lay it all down again.  To hear you say that im your friend.  You are my desire.  No one else will do.  Cause no one else can take the place.  To fill the warmth of your embrace.  Help me find a way.  To bring me back to you. You're all i want. You're all i've ever needed You're all i want. Help me know you are near.     P.S. Sorry, Tyler B....I've been there, dude.  :-/

      The beach was a lot of fun, but I'm glad to be home.   Really glad.  But I still can't wait until the mission trip next week..I've been looking forward to it for so long!  It is going to be so awesome.  I just pray that we'll all be spiritually ready to go...and that we'll make a difference to someone.    Is it true today that when people pray We'll see dead men rise And the blind set free Yes it's true and I believe it I'm living for you  I'm gonna be a history maker in this land I'm gonna be a speaker of truth to all mankind I'm gonna stand, I'm gonna run Into your arms, into your arms again Into your arms, into your arms again   Well it's true today that when people stand With the fire of God, and the truth in hand We'll see miracles, we'll see angels sing We'll see broken hearts making history Yes it's true and I believe it We're living for you ^"History Maker" - Delirious  Later  <>

      It's been a really good day so far.  I got up relatively early, and Bo and I went to the Y to work out.  Then went to run a few errands, and came home and played football.  And I think I'm going to Meg's tonight for a cookout.  Who knows.  I mailed a letter to Jordan today...gah i miss him.  It really sucks that we can't hang out this summer b/c he's in NY like the whole time.  Well, I'm gonna go play guitar.  And I've got this song stuck in my head:    I took off for a weekend last month  Just to try and recall the whole year  All of the faces and all of the places  Wonderin' where they all disappeared  I didn't ponder the question too long  I was hungry and went out for a bite  Ran into a chum with a bottle of rum  And we wound up drinkin all night  It's these changes in latitudes, changes in attitudes  Nothing remains quite the same  With all of our running and all of our cunning  If we couldn't laugh we would all go insane  Reading departure signs in some big airport  Reminds me of the places I've been  Visions of good times that brought so much pleasure  Makes me want to go back again  If it suddenly ended tomorrow  I could somehow adjust to the fall  Good times and riches and son of a b**ches  I've seen more than I can recall  So many nights I just dream of the ocean  God I wish I was sailin' again  Oh, yesterday's over my shoulder  So I can't look back for too long  There's just too much to see waiting in front of me  And I know that I just can't go wrong  ^Jimmy Buffett
