      so i had applied for a job as the admin asst for the VP of corporate sales & i didn't quite fit his bill. which i didn't really think that i would. admin is not the role that i really want, i was actually trying to catch the eyes of those around me. make them understand that i'm not going anywhere in this department & i want to further myself along within the company. so i feel like i've accomplished my goal & I'm happy instead of being sad about being declined for the position.  it's all good & it's a 3-day weekend. yippee.   here's to remembering our heroes overseas, our veterans of wars past & our brave fallen soldiers. happy memorial day weekend.

      so i'm getting something out of the q&c 'stash' for two of my "teammates" and one of them says to me, "are you of celtic decent" and i'm like, "well, kinda, yeah". and he's like, "i dig your rings." and i say, "then you'd appreciate my tattoo." he says, "you'd appreciate mine as well, then."   we go on to discuss where they're located how big they are & what not. i was so happy to hear this from him. he had made a comment to me earlier on in the year regarding my celtic necklace (that has recently broke, but that i'm going to fix VERY SOON). so i'm glad to hear that there are others that appreciate & truly take in their celtic heritage and are proud to show it off with body art.   dammit i gotta get back to see Josh soon. i've been putting it off & i know what i want, but i need to get him to truly put his mastermind behind the design & layout. argh!  that is all. slainte!

      just got back home from flying with marshman. left from chesterfield, went to dinwiddie for a landing, then went back up east followed 95 to follow route 288 all the way out to short pump, then back for a landing at chesterfield. the sun set early behind thick clouds in the west. it was still gorgeous. a bit hazy at times, but no real big deal. haven't been up since late march & it was a blast to go back up. marsh is a great pilot & very descriptive in what he's going to do. i even got a chance at the controls, but that was kinda giving me a heart attack, so i made him take over again. went to Ledo's for dinner & had a killer cheese steak sammich. now back at home & it's time for "beddy bye".   XOXO - 10-4, Good Buddies.   Co-Pilot Kellfire

      this weekend ROCKED! saturday, we head down to the rivah house. once there we go to bask out on the dock & wait for dad's arrival from a day of fishing. he caught 14 flounder! my favorite. after he got in, we ate a wonderful steak dinner. we then watched "the princess bride" & had a yummy bowl of ice cream (butter pecan w/hot fudge...mmmm) & then we watched "as good as it gets".   before i proceed, let me just say that my bro poors drinks the way i do, too much liquor! he made dad a whiskey/ginger with way too much whiskey for dad. he was slammed for most of the night...what a light weight. ha!  so we went to bed saturday around 1am. got up sunday around 10:30am to a wonderful breakfast. marshall even made some pork roll (which might i add sounds nasty, but tastes like pork bologna when cooked) for us. after breakfast, we all got our swimming trunks on & went out on this little secluded beach on an island on the other side of the river. it was beautiful. the water was warm & the weather was perfect. we couldn't have asked for a more perfect father's day weekend.   dad had to have been happy. he got all of us on the boat at the same time, which hasn't happened in years. we had such a blast. can't wait to go back!

      we're off tomorrow a.m. to visit the 'rents at their rivah house. i can't wait to get out on the water in dad's boat. it's been way too long since the last time i went out. captain marshman is coming along. hopefully we can get out in the water, if there's no stinking jelly fishes there to attack us. (crosses fingers).  tonight is clean, dye hair, shop for sodas, snacks & adult liquid refreshments & at Ledo's! (mmmmm!)  i'm so more than ready for it to start...3 more hours to go.  xoxo.

      MDA Bowl-A-Thon August 7th, 2004 10:00am - 2:30pm   I would like to ask you for your time, help, assistance, donation, anything you can offer to help this cause. Owens & Minor is sponsoring an MDA Bowl-A-Thon this year, open to the entire city and I'm on the committee to head up this event. I am looking for people to make up teams for bowling, for donations from you, your friends & family, for your support in any way you can help. There will be plenty of door prizes & raffles at the event, August 7th, but you must be present to win them. You are more than welcome to just come out & watch us the day of the event & cheer our teams on!   This year's proceeds from the Bowl-A-Thon will go to the ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis - AKA - Lou Gehrig's Disease) Division of MDA. ALS is a disease of the parts of the nervous system that control voluntary muscle movement. When it strikes, it's usually in the late middle age (late 50's) or later, although there have been cases of it in young adults and even children, as well as in very elderly people. For more information regarding ALS please go to: http://als.mdausa.org/.   If you are interested in helping out in ANY way, please contact me via e-mail rockin_betty79@yahoo.com.   Thank you all for your time & support always! KNI

      woke up around 6am, went to UR to help run the track & field events for the special olympics. that rocked. i've never seen people so happy to just be in a competition. all of the competitors were friends & in the end they didn't care who came in first. they were there for the fun of it & to cheer their teammates on. it was an awesome event!  around noon, left, rested for a bit. captain marshman & i discussed potentially flying to newport news to see his brother craig. so craig calls to discuss redskin's tix & the captain asks what craig's doing tonight, if he'd like to go out for dinner or something. so it's arranged for us to fly to newport news. so we leave the airport at 4pm & the sky is so clear we can see up to 25 miles in front of us, which is VERY rare for a summer afternoon. it's amazing how short of a trip it is. what's even more amazing is I could see williamsburg & newport news from as close as New Kent County. when on land it seems like forever away, but in the air it's all oh so close to the eye.  we went over the ghost fleet in the middle of the James River. something i didn't even know existed until about a month ago. it's about 20+ old ships just anchored in the middle of the James down in Newport News. it's remarkable to see from the air. most have never seen it let alone heard of it.   upon landing, Craig was there waiting for arrival. we went and ate at Das Wald Cafe, a wonderful german restaurant off of Warwick Blvd. marshall & i both got the knockwurst. it was outstanding. nothing better on flight back to richmond than having knockwurst, sauerkraut & german potato salad rumbling around in your tummy.   the flight back was awesome. flew right over busch gardens, that was weird. it all looks so very small from up there & so very big when on land.  we returned to the airport at 8pm. we rested a little while at home & then went out to see WEST at McCormick's Irish Pub. a good time was had by all. we finally made it back home around 1am & then to bed around 2am. we were completely, udderly WORN SLAM OUT. it was indeed one of the best days of my life, to have done so much & had so much fun in one day! can't wait for next weekend!

      to our dear mr. reagan,   you were a tough old bird. a comical irish joker. a family man. a valiant patriot.  i respect you and your efforts. i admired your strength, your poise, your wit. you were strong in times of weakness. you led Americans through a lot of changes throughout your terms. as i grew up in the 80's, i loved my president & my first lady. you two were the greatest in this child's eyes. even as i grew up & learned more about the negative events that took place during your presidency, i still maintained respect for you. for you gave us Americans hope & pride.   with your passing upon us, i hope that once again, we as Americans can see that there is hope for a better tomorrow, that this war will have a positive outcome & our soldiers come home safely to their families once the job is done.   may your spirit walk among us & give the American people that hope & pride once again.  bless your spirit always.

IT ROCKS!)went to williamsburg on the way back home. bought some new vans for $20. gotta love that outlet store. it's so dern cheap. friday night we found out that marshman was going to lancaster all week until saturday night. so this will give me some time to clean & straighten up my bedroom & office. (which i wanted to do this weekend, but never really got around to doing it).  this thursday night is grrrls night out. pizza & beer. good times shall be had by all. holy crap, that's tomorrow. i love 4-day work weeks. it's closer to the weekend. today i am driving with a co-worker to charlottesville to find a new digital camera for the corporate office. should be a fun trip. this dude's really cool. he's like in his mid-40's and he's got the coolest kid i think i've ever met. his kid's like 10 and he's an actor and he's very artsy. gals you'd love this kid to death. he's years beyond the rest of his age group. so i'm sure we'll talk about him alot on the trip.  ok. time to go get ready for another day at work. x's & o's for all of you!
