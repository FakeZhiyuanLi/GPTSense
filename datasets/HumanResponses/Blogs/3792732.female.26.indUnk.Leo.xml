      Hello all!  A friend recently sent me an invitation to join a blog, but for some reason I kept getting an error message. Anyway. So I went to the website, took the little tour, and was tempted to start my own blog! Resisted this temptation, however. But recently read about a man named Mil Millington (yes, Mil Millington, if I'm remembering correctly) who turned his personal blog into a bestselling novel. You know, fictionalized it some. He's English. But this sounds like a freak accident. He was sitting at home one morning and Random House (or whoever) called and offered him a book deal.   Grr!!  So cannot blog til sundown every day and hope this happens. That would be nonsense.   Already the allure of a potential audience makes me giddy with questions: 1) Would people read my blog? 2) Would people like my blog? 3) Would people like me after they read my blog? 4) Would my blog be interesting to others or just clog cyberspace?   None of these questions are answerable, really, without first blogging. I myself have run across people logging their blog with gluttonous abandon, writing to all and sundry who will listen about late-night parties, skipping school, the odd romance, their day at the beach, what they had for lunch, and whatnot. And reading what an anonymous 15-year-old had for lunch is not all that interesting.   Or is it?  This is the frightening thing about the kinds of things I write, actually. When it comes right down to facts I'm not at all sure the stuff I write for fun is sellable as a memoir/novel/short form item because more often than not I am talking about what I had for lunch (if metaphorically).   And for some reason, I know people who I wouldn't want hovering around my blog hoping to read what I had for lunch.  Is blogging for me? For all my apparent choice-driven inconsistencies, it's still tempting.  LA

      Hello all!  My sister Nancy and I went to a bath house recently. It's a fully operational bath house in Hot Springs, Arkansas, a town famous for it's natural hot springs. In the early twentieth century the Hot Springs bath houses were flocked to for the "curative" powers of the naturally hot water. I visited Buckstaff, which is the last original bath house still operating today on bath house row. At least 4 women attendants saw me completely naked from all angles. I had to wear a thin white sheet between bathing stations that was soaking wet most of the time.   I sat in 100 degree water in a huge porcelain tub, scummy looking liquid soap foaming from my outboard-motor whirlpool and crusting around skin that broke the surface of the water. (This after being loofah-scrubbed by a plain girl named Tonya, four inches of water in my tub while she adjusted dials and fixed temperature, water level rising up the porcelain. We accidentally made eye contact as she instructed me to lay back, loofah scratching at my knees, my face undoubtedly flickering between discomfort (sandpaper loofah) and embarrassment (being completely naked). Tonya leaves and I'm there 25 minutes, feeling my muscles relax and I try not to imagine the thousands of women, many seeking cures from diseases with the hot springs, who have bathed in this tub since 1917.  I sat in a mildly humiliating sitz bath cubicle (Me: "What is this?" Tonya: "A sitz bath. You put your bottom in it." It's like sitting in a sink.) facing the bustling baths unshielded by a curtain, my front covered only by a stretched-looking hand towel.   I sat in one of those sweatboxes (Me, on approach: "It's so hot!" Tonya, ushering me inside: "Yes it is, it's good for you.")--metal with a hole cut out for your head, with steam billowing inside, sweat gushing (yes, gushing!) from every pore neck-down--that got so hot inside I questioned both my sanity and my ability to stay conscious. Sweat sluiced down my back, my front, my sides, the back of my knees, and my hands got so hot I had to press them between my legs. I had to slouch down so the metal box could settle comfortably around my shoulders without my skin touching hot metal. Tonya wrapped my sheet around the neck opening, and I lay my flaming face against the amazingly cool cotton and waited for release.  I lay on a plastic-covered slab of foam with hot towels wrapped around my knees and shoulders (Me: "Those towels are so hot!" Tonya: "Yes, they are.") and I could feel the burned skin sloughing from my legs, but I look later and they are intact. Tonya came at my face with a towel, which I tried to rebuff, but before I could it touched down and I realized it was blessedly icy.   I was ushered by a new lady, name unknown, to the needle shower. "See if that's too hot," she says. I stick my hand in. "It's too hot!" I say. We slide down to the other end of the concourse, and I am presented to the other shower, which is cool. I see Nancy, wilty in a chair, looking slightly flushed in her white sheet.   "I've bypassed all the other things! I got too hot!" She shouts to be heard over the din of running water.   I look at her in surprise. "No sitz bath?! No sweatbox?!" I am flabbergasted.   "What's a sitz bath?" she asks.   "That sink thing over there!" I point it out.   "No," she says, "no sitz bath. You actually got in a sweatbox? It's too hot!"  I go back to have my massage. I lay in a small cool room with an overhead fan and am rubbed with hot lotion by yet another lady whose name I don't remember. This is the best part of the day. I decide to forego the bath next time and just get a massage.  After, N and I are faint from hunger and can only manage to drag ourselves across the street where we end up at some odd low-rent blues lounge. The outside looks respectable, like a place with character; we get inside and after a few moments decide it's not the kind of place you want to use the bathroom. It's almost deserted at 4.00 pm. Non-smoking is a joke, as the sunken velvet-covered (maybe velour) seats soak up everything. It's dim, the illumination coming almost solely from the deepset windows, and the walls are covered in horseracing posters. The menu has a racetrack theme. It's a squirrelly combo of racing and hard-drinking nightlife, the former infusing the atmosphere with cheap chain-store kitsch and the latter adding trailers, trash, and tattoos. But at least it has air conditioning. It's about 90 degrees outside and I worked up a sweat just crossing the street, ruining whatever cleanliness my bathing experience had generated.   Once seated, we look at each other and debate, but decide on staying. We don't have the energy to find somewhere else. I order cold roast beef and she tries the club with a side of onion rings.  She grudgingly gives one to me and they turn out to be the best onion rings I have ever had in my entire life. My fries are mediocre. The white bread on my roast sticks in my teeth and since I've touched my straw with lotion-soaked hands I'm wary of my water with lemon.  We manage to stroll the street after and have ice cream cones and coffee. Nancy gets two whistles from passersby, one from a truck full of redneck guys and the other from a semi-homeless-crazy-looking guy on a bike. On the way home N puts Garrison Keillor on the radio while she drives, and we float along smoothly, and I feel exhausted, and I doze.  LA

      Hi.  I know a guy who does ventriloquism. You know, talking with a dummy and pretending the two of you are having a real conversation. The guy's name is Robby and the dummy's name is Raymond. I know Robby from work and Raymond from one of Robby's (what to call these?) performances. Robby is a children's speaker and uses Raymond as a teaching tool for the kids, which is good. Most kids like the whole ventriloquism thing, I think.  Except me. As a kid I didn't like watching the dummy half of a ventriloquism act talk or move. Ventriloquism makes me feel squirmy.   What's more, there is a promotional poster of Robby and Raymond in my workspace! It was there when I started working and for some odd reason I don't feel I have the authority to take it down. I have an open workspace, I guess is the thing. It's just a head shot of both, and from the way they are positioned Raymond appears to be sitting on Robby's lap. Raymond (the part of him I can see) is wearing a white buttondown, tie, and sweatervest. I can feel Raymond watching me a I type this (yes, I know, from work), round face and bulbous nose above his crisp collar. It's one of those snaps where the eyes follow you. And strangely there is  yet another identical poster across the room!     I know this sweatervest is green because Raymond was wearing exactly the same outfit when I saw him in person at Robby's talk. Raymond looks like Goober from the Andy Griffith Show. Goober dressed in white buttondown, tie, dark green sweatervest, grey flannel trousers, white socks, and black and white oxford saddle shoes. I wonder if Raymond has more than one outfit, but I don't dare ask Robby. It might seem like I'm more than normally interested.   I had met Robby a couple of times through the course of my work, and before I saw him with Raymond he was a normal guy. Outgoing, friendly, professional. But now that I've seen Raymond, every time Robby speaks I hear Raymond's voice in the background saying the exact same thing on a 0.5 second delay. It's like wearing headphones while each speaker intones the same thing in a different voice into either ear. Even the casual "Hi, how are you?" has Raymond's voice in eerie overlay.  The grandfather of a good friend died last week and his funeral was on Saturday. I didn't know this until I arrived, but Robby knew the guy. I spotted him from across the room as I walked into the church sanctuary, but there wasn't time to say hello. Then the service started.   And Robby gave the eulogy.   And so did Raymond.

      Hey.  8|   This is me. My eyeballs are glazed over and I'm so bored I'm expressionless.  I'm glad to have somewhere to go every day, but I wish I were busier.   I'm sooooooooo sleepy.  3|  This is me sleeping at my desk. I could go to sleep here at the computer right now. Even though it's a bit chilly in here.  See? I can close my eyes and type at the same time, and in a few minutes I'll just stop typing, slowly drift off, the clatter of the keys diminishing, each stroke becoming laborious, heavy, sluggish, sleeeeepy.  Haven't had any caffeine today. Maybe this is the thing. But I need to wean myself off caffeine anyway.   It's way too easy to close my eyes at my desk. When did this become acceptable????   So it alternates (in five-second incriments):   8| 3| 8| 3|   Then the phone rings, and   8|   LA

      Hello all!  So Nancy and I are sitting in the dim theater waiting for Spider-Man to start. It's opening day, crowded. We manage to find seats halfway up the gallery, way over on the right, three seats from the wall. We juggle our jumbo Sprite (Nancy has this late-night caffeine adversion, late night being after 5 pm) and large popcorn (N: "It's 50 cents cheaper if you buy a bigger combo!") and plain M&Ms. I find going to the movies with Nancy to be somewhat economical, as she's got no qualms sharing a drink or a snack. It works well for both of us.   The couple in the row in front of us appear to be on a first date. I say this because that's how they looked to me. You don't often overhear people announcing things like that. They are youngish, but not teenagers. Early twenties? She's a mildly attractive blond in bright lipstick and red top, and he's a mildy attractive guy with dark office-worker hair and one of those three-button knit pullovers with a solid-color collar and striped body. Some muted earth tones.   His hair is thick and ends abruptly in the back as if the hairdresser failed to taper but instead mowed a line straight across his neck with clippers. Disconcerting, but okay then. They smile a lot into each other's faces with that I'm-trying-to-impress-you-but-am-pretending-not-to-try-because-not-to-pretend-would-be-too-obvious-but-this-is-not-(although-this-maybe-kind-of-is) kind of way. Brief snatches of their conversation drift upwards and backwards towards me.   He's saying, "You didn't know that about me? But yes! And of course I love my Chillow..."  I poke Nancy in the elbow. "Chillow!" I hiss, trying to be covert. I gesture discreetly with the popcorn tub. "That guy has a Chillow!"  There's a look of incredulity on Nancy's face. She thinks  urlLink Chillows  are crazy, and is no doubt shocked to find that someone else owns one. "Oh my gosh! There's two of you!"  I feel an instant rush of goodwill and commonality towards him, and am suddenly able to forgive his haircut. I think the Chillow is a great invention. I purchased one for my mom for Mother's Day, but have since borrowed it and use it shamelessly.   "And here's something else you don't know!" he announces. Oh my. He's one of those guys who think it appropriate behavior to begin spouting lists of facts or ask you stupid job-interview-like open-ended questions while on a date instead of having a normal, flowing conversation.   "And--the backseat--my car--." Drat! He's mumbling. "I have this doll that--." I hear that loud and clear.   I poke Nancy again. She is now eating the top butterd layer of popcorn out of our tub. "That guy has a doll!" I sqeak at her, this time cocking my head in his direction.   Nancy pauses, hand poised above the popcorn, fingers glistening with butter, eyes hard and wary. "Yeah, that's not working for me."  "And the circus!" we hear him exclaim with joy. Nancy and I look at each other, eyes wide with horror that anyone 1) actually likes the circus and 2) announces that type of thing on a date.   "Look, she's in shock," I whisper, meaning his date. The blond's eyes have begun to glaze a little and her smile is on automatic.  All feelings of warmth and solidarity I feel over the discovery of another Chillow-user evaporate. Nancy fluffs the popcorn and angles it in my direction. I eat a few pieces and watch the crowd, wondering how many more bad first dates are going on. The lights begin to fade and the chatter of the crowd increases in anticipation. Applause breaks out and ripples across the gallery as the screen in front of us flares with light, and we watch.

      I'm in my car, pulling up to the drive-thru at McDonald's (yeah, yeah), sliding into the narrow isle beside the building. I can see several cars in front of me disappear round the side of the building--the line begins to wrap around the corner. I'm sliding into place, slowing, when a white SUV darts through the side of the parking lot--ignoring the narrow isle obviously marked Drive-Thru--and rolls to a stop "in line" moments before I do. Our front bumpers meet at a right angle, his gas-guzzler lining up perfectly behind the car in front of us, my car perfectly balanced on the cusp of the curve of the designated drive-thru isle curling around the building.   He is not making any eye contact. He is lighting up a cigarette. He is rolling down his window in anticipation of ordering. The nerve! He lets off the brake and rolls forward, bringing his front tires in front of my bumper. I now have a great view as he flicks ash and adjusts his glasses and looks hard-edged and defiant.  The line moves forward and he pulls up, but not far enough to let me get around the corner. His SUV now blends seamlessly in line, filling in the corner slot. We wait. I contemplate revenge, but can think of nothing satisfying yet inconsequential to me. Instead I try to transfigure those huffy feelings of indignation into smug self-satisfaction. I have done a kind deed. I have let someone take my place in line. I have....  In my self-deluding reverie I have not noticed the gap between our cars widen. Suddenly, out of my peripheral vision, I see a flash of green careening towards me. I snap to in time to see a green SUV squeal to a halt in front of me, squirming its front quarter into the small gap between me and the white SUV. There is a woman in the car. A woman on a cell phone.  Something inside me snaps, setting off an internal dialogue between me and my evil alter ego.   Evil: HONK!! HONK LOUDLY!! Me: (Gasp of uncertainty.) No! Evil: HONK!! Me: No! (I am angst-ridden.)  Evil: HONK!! Me: No! (But I think this feebly.)  Evil: HONK THE HORN!! Me: Maybe I can. Maybe I should. She certainly deserves it.  My hand hovers over the horn.   Evil: Yes! Just honk the horn! Me: Can I really? Evil: !!!!  Evil is speechless with frenzied desire to honk the horn.   Okay! I'm going to honk the horn! I feel empowered and justified and completely right whilst at the same time seething with revenge. My hand moves to honk, and then something stops me.   Time. It's been too long. I've missed that special window of opportunity. I instantly know that if I honk now it will mean nothing. It will not be the spontaneous and deserved response to an injustice against me; it will be a pathetic, aborted attempt at self-assertion that will look foolish. Or look like a joke. It will have the classic tell-joke-then-take-comic-beat-then-tell-punchline rhythm. Completely inappropriate for revenge purposes.  Suddenly it all seems like too much. I break past every sanity barrier and scream out into my windshield in a high, shrieking voice, "YOU WILL GET YOUR COMEUPPANCE!!!"  And instantly feel better.   My window isn't rolled down, and hers isn't either, so I doubt she hears me, but that doesn't seem important.   The line moves forward, and she jerks around the corner in starts and stops, like she is pressing on both the gas pedal and the brake at once. She gives her order. The line moves. I give my order.   We are now around the bend and I see the white SUV move up to take his place alongside the hand-out window. There is now a large gap between the white SUV and the green SUV. I see the brake lights of the green SUV disappear, and I hear a rumble in front of me. Suddenly, the green SUV lurches forward with startling intensity. And rear-ends the white SUV.   Immediately, the chain-smoker in glasses jumps out of the white SUV and postures with angry shock next to his rear bumper. He gestures with his cigarette to unseeable damages, smoke billowing from angry nostrils. I see the lady in the green SUV lean out of her window. She says something, but I cannot hear what. It obviously angers white SUV because he suddenly becomes dramatic, bouncing back and forth between her window and his bumper, gesticulating with his cigarette, head jerking back and forth on his neck, and saying in a raised voice, "Watch where you're going you bitch, you...."   I am immediately in awe at the inner workings of the universe. I feel one twinge of guilt, and then it disappears.   He spews more angry obscenities, jumps back into his vehicle, grabs his food from the hands of the McDonald's employee hanging out the drive-thru window, gets change, then drives off. The green SUV pulls forward to receive her food. It's my turn. When I get to the window the McDonald's folks are still shaking their heads and looking mildly shocked. I, on the other hand, am enjoying cosmic justice.     LA

      I’m sitting here fully expecting prose to burst from my fingertips at any moment. That’s the life of a writer. Long moments of quiet solitude filled with the dance of language and the feeling that everything you write will be nuanced and meaningful.  Instead I find myself waiting for inspiration, pondering the backs of my hands as they linger mournfully over the keyboard, and imagining myself writing, writing like a champ. Instead I find myself writing long, drawn out sentences of ungrammatical proportions, like Garrison Keillor, my new writer of envy. Only his sentences are grammatical and nuanced and meaningful and since they are so long on top of everything take on monumental importance and only show the beauty of the craft, if done right.  I think email has ruined me. Nothing comes now as easily as sitting in front of the Compose screen in my Hotmail account and pouring out my thoughts and feelings to loved ones. They appreciate all and criticize nothing. Unlike the rest of the world, they await my prose with an eager, open mind. I’ve come to realize a receptive audience is everything.  I haven’t got one of those—a receptive audience. Not even a hostile audience. I’m what they call unpublished. Well, okay, technically not. Technically I have three published pieces. I have sold one nonfiction essay to a website a friend works at. However, even though they have purchased my essay, it has not yet been posted on the website. I find it embarrassing now to have told friends and loved ones that I was being published on the web only to have my so-called debut delayed indefinitely. The second essay is also nonfiction, also published through a friend in a newsletter. And there’s my master’s thesis (fulfilling a degree in writing, no less) and my name is on the copyright page, but only two copies have gone into distribution, and both of those to the school I graduated from.  I’ve not gotten much further. But something will happen. I'm working (thinking) on it.  Without this internal, self-investment-type praise, no writer would ever publish.

      I met Garrison Keillor very briefly at a recent literary event. After a one-hour presentation, an informal book signing was staged in the lobby of a downtown auditorium. I went with Nancy (she's also a Garrison Keillor fan) and I was a little star struck, I’m afraid. We chatted for approximately three minutes—an eternity in the book-signing line—as he inscribed my hardback copy of  Love Me , his latest book. Here’s what the inscription says: Leigh Ann, love and oranges, garrison Keillor, and then the date. Lowercase "g" and everything! I wonder now if he writes frequent emails (the nature of email being somewhat lax on capitalization).  Afterwards on the steps outside the building I spend several minutes trying to decipher that word that looked suspiciously like “oranges.” For some reason it seemed bad form to open the book and read what had written right in front of him. It must be some quality of the celebrity that made me think that Garrison Keillor might inscribe something of great importance on my personal copy of his novel, or impart some great wisdom during our 3 minute exchange. I left feeling horribly cliché.  This is a paraphrased transcript recounted to the best of my recollection.  Me: Hello! (We shake hands.) It's nice to meet you.  GK: Nice to meet you. (He takes my book and opens the cover).  Me: My name is Leigh Ann.  GK: Let me guess. (He spells out loud): L-e, capital A-n-n.  Me: No, I'm L-e-i-g-h, capital A-n-n.  GK: A high-rent Leigh Ann.  Me: Yes, I suppose so.  GK: Are you from around here?  Me: Yes, I grew up in Arkansas.  GK: So what do you do?  Me: Um, actually, I'm looking for work. (At this point I desperately don't want Garrison Keillor to know I can't get a job as a writer.)  GK: As what?  Me: Well, as a writer, coincidentally.  GK: Oh really! You'll have to move away from here to do that!  Me: Yes--I've heard NY. What would you recommend?  GK: I wouldn't recommend NY unless you have some contacts there already. I wouldn't just pick up and go. You need some contacts.  Me: Hmm. Okay.  GK: What kind of writing job are you looking for?  Me: I'm open to all possibilities. I just graduated with my master's degree.  GK: In what?  Me: In writing. (At this point GK looks up from my book--he's still writing on it--and we make sudden eye contact. He lookes mildly surprised, mildly assessing, and later Nancy says he seems impressed.)  GK: Is it an MFA?  Me: No, it's an MA in professional and technical. I'm trying to stay away from the technical and concentrate on professional.  GK: No, you don't want to do technical!  Me: I was teaching freshman composition--  GK: Well, maybe your parents could support you for a month or two? (He hands my book back.)  Me: Hmm, well, maybe. (I nod). That is a possibility.  GK: Or you could just have a nervous breakdown.  Me: Yeah, there you go. I could just have one of those. (I try to keep this as lighthearted as possible by my tone.)  GK: You have to write every day. Every day. And observe things. You have to watch, and to listen. And write every day.  Me: (Nodding.) Um hmmm.  GK: If only I could just hit you on the right spot, right on the side of your head (he gestures), knock something loose....  Me: (Smiling.) If only....  (A pause where we just look at each other.)  Me: Well, it was nice meeting you.  GK: Bye.  ---------End Transcript---------  I blacked out around the time he was talking about my parents supporting me, so I couldn't figure out if he was talking about supporting me in NY or elsewhere. I think it was the combination of GK telling me not to go to NY and the alternate track in my head that was running with all the things that I *should* have said that distracted me for that millisecond. I should have asked about what he meant by contacts.  It's all so horribly cliché! The unknown/unpublished asking advice from the great author. At a book signing of all places! As Nancy and I walked up the steps to the auditorium before the program started (he did a presentation before the signing) I overheard one woman say to another, "I've been taking a creative writing course..." and it made me sick. Everyone in that room probably took a creative writing course in their spare time! Everyone thinks they can be a writer! In the bigger picture I'm no different from 100,000,000 other unknown writers in the universe, all of us asking Garrison Keillor how to become a writer.
