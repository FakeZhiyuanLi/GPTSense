      We didn't do alot. Kim and Jo went through their piece and the rest of disscussed what to wear when we perform it. We seem to have decided on old jeans and shirts, luckily i have my old ripped pair of jeans and i'll persuade my sister to had over her shirt (it used to be my dads and for some reason, proberbly because she's Genny, she wears it a lot) We're going to peform it next friday, i have my work experience interview so i might be a bit late but hopefully only quarter of an hour or so.

      We didn't do a lot at lunch, Jon and I were late because he had to eat lunch, and i had to eat his food. We began to do the scene but everyone was just mucking about, then Kim left because we wern't doing her scene. We tried to go through the first scene once but we only managed to do part of it. We got fed up and left.

      Everybody exept Kayleigh was there, she was late and didn't turn up to first period. Everybody pretty much knows their lines now exept Joanne but she has more lines to learn than the rest of us. Jon and the others argued again about how he keeps interuppting to suggest things. I said he should write them down but i don't think he'll bother. Oh well. I feel rather confident that our performance is going to go well. I think that with a few more rehersals we'll all know our lines and what we're doing. Unfortunately because of a useless assembly we didn't have as much time as usual but we managed to do all the scenes, which was just dandy.

      I forgot to write down who's playing who last time so i'll do that now:  Willie:Me John:Jon Peter:Joanne Raymond:Jenny Angela:Laura Audrey:Kayleigh Donald Duck:Kim  I know all my lines now and our rather nice teacher (sucking up)gave me and Jon a sweet for learning our lines. Most of the others have learnt some of theirs. Kim and Joanne went through their scene together while the rest of us went through our lines in the first two scenes. We decided to come in tomorrow and wednesday lunch times to practice and then monday after school.

      We had three rehersals today. In the lesson we didn't have very long so we just went through scene 10. At lunch i think we did scene 10 again, i can't quite remember. After school Jenny tried to stand on her head but she couldn't so we've changed it to her standing on one leg. We did scene 10 and 11, we couldn't do the rest beacuse Kim wasn't there. we seem to be getting on together ok exept the other girls have a go at Jon for telling them how to do stuff which is a bit unfair as he's just trying to make it better. i've learnt nearly all my lines now.

      I have just returned homw from Sam's sleepover.  Most weekends i sit at home doing homework ans msning but this weekend i had 2 social engagements! Yesterday i went to see my friend, Katie, in 'Once a Catholic' (a play) it was really good, really funny teeheeheeeheee! Clair drove me there which was cool because i had to map read and we found our way there perfectly! Slightly worrying that she's only recently passed her driving test but we were great! We felt ever so proud of ourselves getting there. We had to make a slight detour to Reading on the way back (nice way of saying we got a bit lost :s) But we got back in the end :D I then had to go staight out to Sam's. She lives really far away 'out there' so it took aaages to get there. We had dinner in a pub and i had a delumtious cajun chicken chaibatta. yumyumyumyum. At first i did feel a little like i didn't fit in but i was ok after a while. Daniel and i were getting on like we used to which was great, we have been getting on but i feel he likes to kinda look after me in a way, and i don't see him as much or rely on him as much anymore.  It was all rather dandy :)i slept ok which is odd for me, usually when i sleepover with lots of people i sleep badly but i was all rather snug on the floor with lots of blankets and stuff. We watched Aladin in the morning and had yummy pancakes for breakfast! yum! I need to have a shower now and do revision, grrrrr. i'd better go before Genny scalps me for being on the computer for longer than 5 miniuts.

      I'm talking to Andy and he's talking about how much he's looking forward to going to Sam's on saturday and how much fun it's going to be. I'm sure it is going to be fun but it's not like i can't wait to go or anything. I'm feeling more and more detached from them all. And i don't care either. Should i care? When i think back to the spanish trips and the time me and Emma used to spend together i hardly feel sad or wish it was still like that at all. When i meet up with Emma and Andy and Daniel and everybody i don't really feel part of that group anymore, i think i'm just different to them now. Maybe i've grown up or something but i notice things about them like i didn't used to notice, like Daniel always having to be right and telling me stupid facts which are so obvioulsy untrue and his weird plans that most people make up when they're ten. stuff like living in a flat with your school freinds and stuff. Andy seems to think the world revolves around him and that he's the most important being in the universe. Maybe i've just outgrown them. They were Emma's friends in the first place anyway. I want to just be without her now, not be overshadowed by her. make my own friends instead of sharing hers. I am looking forward to Sams thing, it'll be fun, at least daniel's there :D  i'm gonna stop bitching now byebye

      He did a really nice blog about me and said i should do a nicer one about him, so i will.  First of all i'd like to thank him for writing such a lovely blog about me, i don't think anyone has ever said (written) anything so nice about me :D  I keep writing stuff and rambling on and then deleting so i'll just say that Jon is great, he's such a cool friend. Making friends with him was the best thing that's happened to me this year. Because of him i'm much happier than i was. I don't want to go out with him whatever people might say. i'd really hate not to be friends with him so even if i fancied him i wouldn't do anything about it. Jon is different to my other chums because i actually wanted to be friends with him, unlike most my other friends who i'm just, friends with.  That makes you extra special my dear :)

      Hohum, bloggity blog. i can't really think of much to say but i don't feel like going off and doing homework or revision.  My dear mother is being a tad annoying. She's so enthusiastic about such stupid things. I got a little bit upset that i had to cook and first she raised her eyebrows in the very annoying way she does then started asking me 'how could i make cooking more fun for me' and 'what is it i don't like about cooking?' I HATE COOKING!!!!!!!!! there is no reason! i just hate it! fortunatly after 4 years of her being a 'trainer' i know what sort of answers to give so i just told her that singing would make cooking more enjoyable and then ignored her. And she keeps asking me what would help me to revise. she keeps saying things like 'write a poem' or 'act out a little play about electricity' or something. write a poem??? i don't think so. it's not going to help me to remember. grrrrrr but i've realised that if i just go along with it i can go and do more fun stuff like watch tv or go on msn after she's finished rabbiting.  I'm going (with other people as well) to visit Chris on fri coz he's broken his feet oh, or not, he's just told me that his mum doesn't want anyone coming over while he's in a wheelchair which seems a bit unfair to me. poor chris! :(  i'm gonna go now, i'm so popular that i'm talking to 4 ppl and i can't keep up  ciao

      Jon said i should write a blog about him, as i wrote one about Genny. So i thought i could write one about all my different freinds. I could look back later on and think 'urgh! why did i ever like them':p  So, as Jon suggested it I think i'll blog about him first (you should do one about me and my beauty:p)  A blog about Jon: I'm can't write anything really nasty and bitchy about him sadly as he'll read this :p. ok, well Jon is fat and ugly. Out of my good freinds i've known him the shortest time. I made freinds with him on the 23rd of september (i know, i'm sad, i remember dates, but it was around other times that i remember)At the time it was rather boring with Emma and Andy taking no notice of anyone around them and daniel going off coz he was fed up with emma and andy.Anyway then Jon came along and i had a new freind, sadly not a very pretty one (dnt hit me!) He gives me lots of food! yum! He has a really boney bum which is so painful when he sits on me (which is alot, he obviously just wants to get close to me :p)The best thing about him is his fun hair that i can poke my fingers through the curls.  A blog about Emma: She's been my best friend since year 7 when we were both shy loners on our own so made freinds. We've had a rather gleeful time over the past 4 years but this year with Andy coming along we havn't been as close. Emma was really really shy when i first met her but then she stopped being so shy and became 'fun' and everyone started to fancy her which used to really annoy me, it used to really annoy me that evrybody liked her more but i don't care anymore. This year it seemed like we were going to get on better than last year because we have most of our lessons together and Andy would worry about her doing stupid stuff instead of me, but then just before the year 11s left i decided i didn't want to be her sidekick anymore so i don't spend very much time with her out of lessons. She has Sam instead who is practically her stalker she seems to love Emma so much. Anyway, Emma is still one of my best freinds and i fell glad that i have her.  Andy: I've had a strange freindship with Andy, we made friends with him when we were in year 7, then him and Emma went out, that was really good, it lasted 10 months (their 2nd 10 mnth anniversary is today) and i got on really well with Andy. Then they split up and he hated Emma so we stopped being friends with him untill last July, then in august he and Emma got back together. Most of the time i really like Andy, we're quite similar and he always makes me laugh but a few months ago we fell out so i don't like him quite as much as i used to.  Now i'll go on to Daniel :He's been out friend since year 7, he's always been really great to me and Emma and i've often felt like he's my older brother. Last year i was really close to him and i wasn't always very happy because i felt i was losing Emma so i really liked it that he was always there and made me feel better. This year i havn't been quite as close to him but i still love to soend time with him and chat to him. i'm going to make an effort to stay in touch now he's left.  Last of all, Beth: I've been freinds with Beth forever. She's more like my sister than my freind, we're very different and when i came back from New Zealand we'd both changed a lot and i found it hard to get on with her, but over the past 2 or 3 years we've got on really well together and we're really good freinds. Beth is really great at making you feel wanted, like you're the best person in the world and she thinks you're greta. She can also make you feel like the most unimportant thing in her life too which isn't a great thing about her. The best thing about us being freinds is we don't ever need to make an effort because our parents do that for us, they're really good freinds so hopefully Beth and i will stay friends for a long time (untill our parents die :p)  i don't have any other really good freinds and i won't bother writing about people like Jennie and Natasha and Filippa so i'll write a little about my most beautiful wonderfull freind, me: beautiful, sexy, intelligent, witty....i could go on forever ;)

      I don't really have anyhting to write about but i really don't want to have to go and do my homework soooooo.......  hohum, i'm having a very uninteresting conversation with Paddy, he's been online for the first time in months. It's a bit weird talking to him, he used to be one of my really good freinds but i havn't spokent to him since septemeber.  Last year i hung round with him, Daniel, Emma and Peter, and sometimes Vicki. Paddy really fancied Emma but by about April he got really obsessed over her and got depressed that she wouldn't go out with him. Noone could ever talk to him because he was rude and horrible. I used to sometimes chat to him on msn but he was so rude and i hated the way he was so depressed over nothing. Some people have real reasons to be depressed and just get on with it but Paddy thought he had a hard and awful life. i'm not the sort of person who gets depressed so maybe he did have some reasons or something but we all just ended up getting so annoyed and then Emma got together with Andy so he went off. I want to laugh at him thoguh because he is such a loser, he hangs around now with a group of rejects from each year who can't make anyother friends like mouse boy and sarah west (uurrgghh)We're hardly most popular people in the world but i'd rather hang aroung with me and emma and people than with that lot. hohum, i'm sure they all love each other sooo much :p hahahahahah, he was talking to Emma and then he said he couldn't talk to her because 'it brings up too many bad memories' hahahah well i think thats funny coz it was so long ago now and most people would have got over it. hohumdedum I'd better go as my parents will be home soon and i'm not supposed to be online so much :s tarra

      I'm going to blog about how cool Genny is. Some of the time i really hate her like when she leaves cups around and noses into my life too much, but at the moment i really love her. She makes me laugh so much, when we have dinner and we're all sitting around the table it's so funny coz my parents get so annoyed with her talking REALLY loudly and then me snorting. hahahahhahahahha she's so funny! she's also a little perverted for a 13 year old girl, her favorite phrases at the moment are 'nice knockers' and 'juicy mangoes' in a sexy voice. She and jake make me laugh so much. And i can talk to her about anything. She's the only person who knows almost everything about me. We have such cool conversations about really stupid stuff, i love having pretend arguements with her. Like earlier today she was trying to tell me some wierd way of proposing, her idea was that you send the person ur gonna propose on a plane then tell them to look out the window because there's ostritches outside then write 'marry me' on toilet paper and put it on the runway. hahhahahahah maybe none else finds that funny but i find it VERY funny. teeheehee She's so cool! i get jelous of her which is a bit odd because you're not supposed to get jelous of your younger sister. I'm much calmer than her though so thats ok. She's pretty and so confident, she has really weird dress sense but everything looks cool on her. yesterday she wore: a skirt we've had in the dressing up box for 8 years, my old black skirt and a tshirt she made in school. She's really odd though, she loves cucumber dipped in chocolate and her ambition is to be head of the norweigen mafia, she's leant quite a lot of norweigen but only useless stuff like 'this isn't my laundry'. She thinks Tony Blair is great and wrote him a letter about wanting to become a butcher and how her art teacher is a tramp. Anyway, enough about Genny now, i'll proberbly blog again in a few days about how much i hate her but anyway........  the rasberrys are coming out! it's really exciting(ish) we can eat them yumyumyumyum  hohum, think i'll chat to Emma for a bit on msn, oh the joy of it. ciao

      i know i do it but on msn it really annoys me when people can't think of anything to say so just type in absolute twaddle! If i'm talking to Chris he'll just write 'sooo' (i know i do it too but i'm stopping) if i'm talking to daniel he'll write random stuff like 'monkey sex' or other random stupid stuff. Most annoying is Emma though ( i keep writing mean stuff about her, i feel bad but i've got to get rid of my negativity of her somewhere) if she can't think of anyhting interesting or meaningful she'll write 'fat toads' or 'smelly slugs' it pisses me off so much! It seems that i keep getting annoyed with a lot of stuff she does at the moment. i really really love her but...oh i can't explain. Andy and Jon are ok tho, if they can't think of anything to say they don't say anything (which if i'm talkin to only one person i get a bit bored but anyway..) or Andy will think up something interesting to say and we'll have a decent conversation.   i don't really know why i bother going on msn so much, maybe i should get some new contacts who have fascinatingly interesting lives or i don't know as well. But that doesn't always work coz when i talked to Ashton i had nothing to say to her. She is very different to me now though. I could have tried to stay in touvh with her but she obviously wasn't bothered about me so i just left it in then end. We were too different anyway, even if i'd gone to Willink or tried harder to stay in touch i don't think we'd be freinds. I don't care about her anymore so i dnt know why i'm waffling on. Think i'll go chat to Genny, i AlWAYS have stuff to talk about with her.

      Went on the sponsored walk today! oh the joy of it :p Emma and Sam didn't bunk (surprise surprise) they chickened out. I knew they wouldn't do it, it's Emma, she's to shy and scared. I didn't walk with her, not that i really care, i think that now we know each other so well we don't really have anything to talk about anymore. Her topics of conversation are very limited (Andy, guitars) oo er thats being a bit mean :( i got one sponsor but forgot my form, oh well who cares. Went to see Harry Potter after the walk, rather gleeful. Emma said to me yesterday that this is the first time we're not doing anything after the walk, and i was like, hohum i suppose so, but i hardly want to hang around watching her and Andy get off (unlike Sam, who is in love with Emma) Emma and Sam didn't spped walk either, they were only a bit in front of us. i talk to Emma for like, a second, but i never really know what to say anymore, i don't want it to get like Genny is with Grace, i'll make more of an effort to be nice and talk to her.  hohum, i'm rather tired and i had to cook, grrrrrr this weekend looks full of excitingness (NOT) think i might go and watch tv now (i'm not a telly addict, i hardly watch any anymore)  ciao

      In art today Emma and i went on the potters wheel, it was so fun! my pot yurned out....... ummm well lets put it this way, my teacher got rid of most of it and told me to make a plate with then rest. then i made a plate, mr. wilson told me to throw it in the bin after i accidently cut it in half. i don't think i'm a very good potter.  On the bus home there was only me and jak! only 2 people! i remember i time when it was so crowded we had to sit on each others knees! but i got home extra quicky :D yay  Sponsored walk tomorrow, i don't know what to wear, if it's sunny my criminal damage jeans with big pockets for keeping stuff in but if it's cloudy i'll wear my butterfly jeans and take a bag. oooh what a pickle.  i sound so girly man thoughts man thoughts...........

      feeling a bit melancholy. people don't seem to be very happy at the moment. i'm rather gleeful myself but when people are sad it makes me feel a bit sad too.  on a more cheerful note, i ate a delicious dinner today, it was this really nice sausagy thing Genny makes. And Emma and Andy seem a bit better, hohum, maybe things are getting jollier.  it's so hot! if it's like this on the sponsored walk i might have to walk naked :p. i've just bought some new jeans and now i can't wear them coz it's too hot, hurumph.  lalalala listening to Coldplay at the mo 'all the things you do ... all yelloooww'(dnt rlly know the words.....)

      Emma started crying again today. i didn't know what to do, i'm no good with crying people. I know when i cry i prefer to be left alone because i look really ugly when i cry (jon, dnt say i look ugly anyway :p) but i didn't know what to do with her. Luckily, Sam, Emma's biggest fan seemed quite happy to deal with her crying her eyes out so i went off (like every best friend should :s)I keep feeling guilty that i'm not a good enough friend for her. Sometimes i think she really hates me for not always beeing with her, she can't do anything about it though, she did it when andy was at school. i keep typing stuff then deleting it so i think i may as well go now as i'm not actually writing anything.  i'll just mention how hot it was today: it was really hot! there, the mention of the hotness

      everything seems to be pretty much hunky dory with emma and andy now, not that its even my problem.  i'm glad they didn't split up. anyway...... i felt quite pleased this morning because i got up, had a shower, cleaned out the rabbit, put a wash in, sorted 2 piles of washing and did my homework all by about 10.30 so i ahve the rest of the day to do whatever i like, i think i might go for a bounce. i ought to do some revision for science, maybe i will. i wish i was more motivated to revise and learn stuff, i am so lazy! i shouldn't be. it seems funny that people who don't go to school coz they live in a really poor country or something rlly want to go but everyone who does go to school doesn't want to, rather ironic. sponsored walk on friday funfunfun. emma's bunking it,i'm not coz i'm good :D it seems odd that i'm not paticually bothered about emma not going. hohum, i don't know what i want with her, sometimes i really want to b close to her again and us to be best buds and everything but a lot of the time i don't care.  if emma reads this, i do love you so much but i can't be best friends with you forever, remember, i like to think realsitically, don't get hurt as easily and all that.  the sky looks nice and blue today, i think i'll get genny and go for a bounce  tarra

      my crappy little sister has been messing around with my blog, god sometimes i really hate her! she thinks she's so clever and funny and she's NOT. grrrr  i went over to calcot today and met up with, emma, daniel, steven and helen. it was really boring. as usual we walked about aimlessly all day. emma was really miserable, i hate it when she's sad, i hate it when any of my friends are sad because it always makes me want to cry :( emma got off with helen after telling andy she would only ever kiss him. so in effect she cheated on him. she is really really unhappy because he feels so cross at her. Andy  seems very insecure where emma is concerned, he seems to hate it when she does stuff he doesn't like, i think because he feels he has no control over her. but the thing is, he does. she loves him so much she'd do anything for him but she often doesn't think before doing anything stupid. i felt so helpless, i've never seen her so upset or cry so much, she hardly stopped crying all afternoon and when she did she had very wet eyes, i don't think i really saw her smile or laugh, she did a bit when me and danile tried to cheer her up but in that way you laugh when you are so upset that it's not really funny, you just don't want anyone else to know how awful you feel. i hope she's ok, i really don't want her to split up with andy, sometimes i really hate him and he can make me really mad but she loves him so much and i want her to be happy. i felt a bit guilty today that i'm not as close to her as i used to be but i can't carry on being 'bosom buddies' with her if it's not going to work anymore, too mcuh has changed, she can't expect it to go back to how it used to be before andy. i think she knows this too. i never thought when i met her that we'd become best friends but no one else better came along....... i AM still best friends with her, just not in the same way. oo er i hope she doesn't read this. anyway, enough about all that.....  it was a tad annoying today as i wanted to catch the bus from mortimer to daniel's but i only had a five pound note and the bus driver ddnt have enough change  so fotunatly he waited for me to dash across the road to the shop for me to get change. unfortunatly for me though there was the longest que of old slow people with piles of shopping. but an old lady let me go in front of her which was nice but then the girl at the till wandered off somewhere, grrrr luckily the bus waited but it was a rather stressful journey especially when i almost forgot to get off at the right stop :s  humdedum, i'm really thirsty so i think i'll go and get a drink  taataa

      it's a bit weird that anyone can see what i write, having a blog isn't like having a real diary because you can't really write your secrets how how you REALLY feel.(although, in the past when i have kept 'secret' diaries genny has always read them, i suppose thats the problem with having a sister, they are so nosy) but it is very weird if you do read someones most secret and inner thoughts, whenever i have read genny's diaries (which is not recentl if you read this) i am always shocked about how little i know about her, well i supose i know a lot about her as she is my sister and my best friend but i don't know what she thinks about. i wish i could read minds! it would be so interesting, some people really interest me and i want to know everything about them but they are always the people i know nothing about. i wouldn't like it if i found out evryone hated me though so i suppose it's a good thing i can't read minds :s, i think i'm confuddling myself. It's always strange when you do find out something, something really awful or weird about people or things you think you know so well. I know i'm rambling on and on but i don't really have anything better to do. I also think it's weird the way ideas change in my head, like, i'll think one thing but then start to doubt that and think another untill it's compleatly different and i don't know what i really think. i bet none of this makes any sense at all, but it does to me so i spose thats ok :s i'm trying to think of something ultra fascinating to say but i can't so i might go as it's getting late and sometimes i say really really stupid things when i get tired, i don't think whatever stops me from saying exactly what i'm thinking works very well when i'm tired. this has been a rlly rlly long entry but i love to type away............:p

      i had a rather interesting dram last night, i dreamt that something was kiiling everyone then these huge dinosaurs came and were killing even more people so i went into a wood which was full of torches because i think i'd had this dream before and so knew what to do, i stayed in the wood. But there was this man who's kids were in the wood and he tried to get them out even though it was unsafe! very stressful dream! then the sun came out and the dinosaurs dissaperared and evryone swam in the sea but then the world blew up! the end!  that was VERY interesting!  school was alright today but mrs. zambanini's leaving, all the nice teachers leave. i got 20 in my science practice paper which was crap so i neeeeed to revise, i will i will even if i can't be bothered i will. i finished my eesay last night! i redid the start coz it was a load of tripe.  i'm now going to make a few changes to it TTFN

      This will be my last blog for a couple of weeks untill my return from frankfurter land. We have to get up at some highly immoral time of the morning tomorrow to go and catch a horrible ferry where i shall proberbly be seasick and cold. I guess Germany will be quite cool and it seems like we're doing interesting stuff.  Today we're just packing and stuff, i've been really good and cleaned out Angus's hutch and cleared up the kitchen. My mum is making me hoover the house as well, i don't see the point, we're away, we're not gonna be looking at our messy house but all parents seem to be like that :p.  Trying to decide what cds to take in the car, i want to stop my mum taking Elvis Presly love songs, i agree with Nora Jones and Simon and Garfunkel but Elvis Presly is going to take up a cd space where i could have Red Hot Chilli Peppers or Idlewild. Oh well maybe i can sneakily 'lose' it.  I'd better go and pack my bag with stuff to take.  tarra everyone

      We go to Germany on Saturday, i get to wash my hair in my own clean&nbsp;shower and sleep ina comfortable bed instead of a lumpy tent for the last time tomorrow night. I  am  looking forward to going but it seems like such a long time to be away for.  Daniel came over today which i was really pleased about because it's not often he makes an effort to come over to burghfield. We didn't do much exept chat and tramp a bit but it was nice. Emma didn't come because she was painting her room, i won't see her again now before we go away, nevermind i see her as sson as i come back, and everybody else.  My feelings towards Emma and Daniel and everyone keep changing, one minuite i think they're great and i want to spend time with them then the next i can't stand them. I really enjoyed talking to Daniel today, when we have a good chat i always want to tell him everything and so he ends up knowing a lot of stuff i wasn't planning on telling him :s oh well, i trust him, i really do, Emma doesn't but i don't think thats very good because he'll be less likely to keep her stuff. I don't see why she doesn't trust him, i think he's more trustworthy than me, i seem to be such a gossip *guilty face* but i am keeping some people's stuff because i like them more than others and i want them to keep my stuff.  Ladeda, i'm feeling sort of jolly, Julia and co are coming over for a barbie, should be yummy, if a little stressful :D

      I am so, so tired, i stayed up really late talking to Genny last night. I sometimes forget about how good she can be to talk to. She's very down to earth and is great at telling me the truth about stuff, which in a way is annoying because it means i can't live in my little fantasy world of everything being how i want it to be but it's good because she makes me think about what everything is  really  like. It was a really good talk though, i was feeling a bit down about stuff and a little confused as well but she made me laugh so much by talking about how we are 'upper class mean princesses' and how we live in our 'castle' looking over all the scummy people in burghfield and how if we ever started smoking we'd do it with style with long cigarette holders like Cruella De Vil has. That proberbly makes no sense but it did in our conversation, the great thing is we feel almost exactly the same about stuff and it makes us laugh to talk about it.  Daniel and Luke are coming over tomorrow (hopefully) which i'm really, really pleased about because they don't often make the effort to get over to burghfield ("but Alice, we have to catch a bus! that's just too much"). So i'm feeling more positive about them again. I keep going up and down about how i feel towards my 'old' friends (the ones i've had since year 7) I think i'm outgrowing them. I don't always want to hang out with people who's idea of fun is to nick dog poo fine signs, roll cigarettes and talk about electric guitars. They seem to be typical boring teenagers and I don't want to be like that. Last summer that was all i wanted, to be like them but I don't think i ever could be, i'm too different. Yesterday when i was at Daniel's, Emma, Clare and Sam were always together and i was with Daniel. Emma, Clare and Sam all suit each other so well and i don't feel part of them. I don't care because I don't want to be like them but it is odd that Emma is my best friend but i don't seem to have much in common with her anymore, we seem part of different things.  This all keeps confuddling me but i know that when i leave school i'm going to have a completly different, more interesting life and school will seem insignificant and petty compared to other stuff. I think i realise this while Emma and Daniel don't.  I have to go and feed the pets now, our neighbours are away and they have 2 fat rats (gizmo 1 and 2), some fish, a cat (dead cat) and 4 guinea pigs (lesliey 1, 2, 3 and 4) !!!! that's a lot of pets!  &nbsp;

      Went over to ye olde Calcot today. I went to Daniel's with Emma, Clare and Sam. It was soooo much better than the last few times i went there! I ate! Daniel cooked us one of his delicious pasta lunches. Yumyumyumyumyum. It reminded me of last summer, but without the argumentitive parents.  Also i felt a little bit of left-outness that i havn't felt for a very long time because next week they're all going to meet up while i'm away, in a way it's not that great, feeling left out but also good because it means maybe i'm not quite as bored with them and i feel more like i'm part of them again, good good good. Also i'm not  that  bothered about being left out so maybe i can have the best of both feelings :D  I'm going shopping for clothes to go to Germany with tomorrow, goody, my mum can buy me lots of stuff! Only downside is i hate shopping with my mum, she thinks that everything i could ever want in my whole life can be found in TK Max.  I was feeling rather jolly all day and i'm still all happy :D I feel rather dandy and loved :D smily smile.

      Kinda boring, I rang Beth to see if she wanted to meet today instead and after lots of 'maybe, well if i get a better offer then i won't bother but if not.....' well she didn't actually say that but thats the gist of it. Anyway she got a better offer so it's a dullish home day today. Daniel rang me up to see if i wanted to go over to Calcot to meet up with him and Emma and Luke and people but i can't really get there as my mum's out, well i can, but i'd rather stay at home scoffing nectarines than wandering around in the rain. God, it doesn't feel like summer! It should be sunny!  I watched '10 things i hate about you' this morning, i love that film! it's sooooo romantic (just going a bit girly there) but it is so so lovely, ahhhhh :) and it has cool music in it.  Lalalalalalla if it was sunny then i could tramp, bummy.  I feel kinda weird about staying at home and not caring about going out with Daniel, i mean, last year i would have got up, gone out and caught a bus to his and even if i had a really boring day i'd still enjoy being with them. But these days i just seem to get  bored . I'm not sure if it's doing nothing or whether i'm bored with them. Yesterday i didn't do much at Natasha's but i wasn't bored. If i had to choose people to hang out with this summer i don't think they would be at the top of my list, i like being with them but i get kinda bored :s.   Genny's making us some yummy potato waffles for lunch, i love it when my parents go out, we can eat anything, i always seem to end up eating a lot of fruit yumyumyum peaches and nectarines.  I spose i ought to do some homework but the end of the holidays is so far off............

      I went out today and Beth asked if I wanted to meet up but i was out! Usually this is the other way around, ohhhh i feel so powerful!.  I went to Natasha's, it was cool, Natasha and Jennie met me in town then we went to the river by WOMAD and went on her boat, he boat is so cool! I want to live on one, well just for a bit, i quite like my big house. We played pass the parcel because it was one of Natasha's mum's friend's birthday and Jennie got some face paints and our faces were covered in writing and pictures, it was fun!  My skirt is done! It is soooooo beautiful! Here's what i want everybody to say when they see it:   &nbsp;  Person:  Wow Alice! that skirt is gorgeous! where did you get it from  Me:  Oh, you know, just a little something i threw together.  Person:  Oh you are so talented and fantastic, MARRY ME!!!!!  well maybe that's taking things a bit  too  far but i feel very pleased with myself for actually finishing it. This morning i got up at 8 to finish it and i didn't eat anyhting untill i got to town i was so into my sewing. In fact, all i've eaten today has been a blueberry muffin and some cake. Oh well, dinner soon, but i'm not actually that hungry.  Today, this man was peeing in the river! At first i didn't think he was peeing because there was so much but he was  peeing in the river!  Natasha said that it was a big river so it didn't really make a difference but it was a  lot  of pee! GROSS!  I have to clear up my sewing stuff now, tarra

      I seem to be writng a lot at the moment, oh well it means i'll have more words than Jon, teehee.  I'm quite looking forward to going to Germany now, Genny says we'll take the video camera and film 'Genny's hour' always fun. Unfortunatly our video camera is CRAP so it will run out of battery in about 2 days, grrrrr. I want a new camcorder but they're expensive and i want a digital camera and something else that i can't rememeber. oh well.  It's a bit dissapointing that as Jon's away i have no one to comment on my blog, whoever reads this please comment! i'm feeling all saad..... and aloooone..... :p  Genny and i were watching old videos of us in the olden days, i have such a weird voice in year 7, i'm quite pleased to say that i'm pretty normal by year 9 and don't speak too weird and don't have too weird hair.  blabla i'm bored, and tired, but i can't be bothered to go to bed, i'll only think about stupid stuff or sing Joni Mitchell songs that i can't get out of my head that are driving me nuts!!! grrr, but i know the whole first verse to 'case of you'   ummm laa (can't remember the 1st line)   I am as constant as a northan star   constant in the darkness   if you need be i'll be in the bar   on the back of a (sumthing) coaster   in the blue tv screen light   i drew a map of canada   oh caaanadaaaaa!   with your face sketched on it twice   oh you're in my blood like holy wine, tastes so bitter and so sweet oh i could drink a case of you, and still be on my feet. oh i would still be on my feet    &nbsp; i feel quite pleased at that because usually i can't remeber lyrics at all but it's bugging me because i can't get it out of my head. I'll try and sing Idlewild instead, that usually works for getting stuff out my head.  hohum, tired, think i'll go to bed after i've found out if Daniel knows any gossip

      I'm making a skirt, quite odd for me because i hate sewing but i couldn't find one in the shops. I want a blue, tie dyed, long, flared skirt and i'm just about to dye my fabric.  I took Ben and Joe to see Shrek2 today, it was good, Ben and Joe were really well behaved and were good about crossing roads and hurrying to woolworths etc. The we met up with Julia and had lunch in Pizza express where i have never been before.  I want to get my skirt done in time for going out on sunday but knowing my sewing skills maybe not. I think Natasha's party will be really fun! she said to bring people but everybody seems to be away at the moment, i think Emma's going but she's going to WOMAD so might just be there for a bit. I'm babysitting tomorrow night which is a pain because i could have stayed over at Natasha's but good because it means MONEY!! and i need money now because the material for my skirt cost 19 pounds!!!!!! The people i babysit for are moving to America though! I won't be able to babysit anymore! sobsobsobsobsob:p  Germany next weekend, I'm not going to see people for so long! I havn't seen Andy for ages and he goes to this drama thing next week then i go away, and Jon's already away then he comes back when i go away. Oh well i'll proberbly see everyone the day after i get back because Emma's having her sleepover then. I'm also proberbly not going to even talk to Jo untill we go back because she's away so much, it's a shame, we have good convos.  blablablabla i can't think of any other news or stuff to say, i'm about to go and do something  really  sad, i won't say what it is, evrybody will point and laugh and i will shunned from socaity (it's not that bad but it's nice to inject a bit of excitement into stuff)

      Lokks like these holidays are going to be more socail than the last:D Tomorrow i'm going into town to see Shrek, it  is  with my cousins but it's better than doing nothing and my cousins are really sweet. On sunday i'm going to Natasha's boat warming party which should be reeeeealy cool (and hippyish) i should hopefully see Emma again next week before i go away then when i get back it's Emma's sleepover then Daniel's and Sam's birthday sleepover then i might have a big one because my parents think our new house is great for parties. Funfunfun.  I made my hair go curly again which i am very happy about, i don't need to worry about my hair in Germany at all, god! i'm so shallow :p  I even started my english homwork! shocking! but i only did question one and three. i don't want to leave all my homework till the last minute but i think i will.  I had a good time at Emma's being a hippy and listening to Bob Dylan and Barry Mcguire, we also listened to The Kinks a lot and Greenday. yumyumyum i wish we could download music.  gotta dash, i'm being summond

      The funny thing about Genny is that we all listen to her. She talks a load of tosh, we'll be talking about one thing then she'll say something that you think will be relevent but actually it'll be about something completly random such as telling Mr. Mathu that Matt wasn't looking at her wordsearch, he was looking at the pattern on the paper. And me, my mum, and my dad all sit there listening to her, if I talked about random boring stuff i'm sure someone would interrupt. Today she started talking about her 'bubble' apparently i have the key to her bubble but my parents have to ring the door bell. She's so funny. &nbsp; I can't really think of much else to say, I'm feeling grrish at Emma again, not a good thing, i'll forget about it, then hopefully it'll pass. &nbsp; Finished my essay! yay! something in my brain keeps telling me i have more homework, but i don't, hohum what a pickle. &nbsp; hahaha! last year Beth was trying to starighten my hair but in Sabrina something really funny happened about pickles and i laughed so much she nearly burnt my head. hahahahah i love laughing insanly, i can't remember the last time i laughed without being able to stop, oh yeah! it was today in art, i can't remember what George said but i know it wasn't  that  funny. I laughed so much i kept spitting out my drink whenever i tried to take a sip. teeheehee &nbsp; Actually i've laughed quite a bit at the moment, like when i spilt water on Genny today and signed Mr. Piercy's card ' I love you, love from Jon' teeheeheeheeeheeeee funny funny ahhh oh well think i shall say adios mis gordos loco amigos y voy

      Good and bad.  Good because it's the holidays, no work, no early mornings, no RE lessons and all that stuff.  But bad because year 10 was really good, better than the other years and year 11 might not be as good, i will  make  it good though. Also bad becuase of Genny, we go through phases, we are really close for a year then not so and i really want to be as close to her next year as i have this year because i don't think we've ever been closer. Not much bad just i won't see people as regularly, never mind. &nbsp; Going to Emma's tomorrow and staying over, i was really happy about going, we usually have fun but Sam has&nbsp; put me off a bit. I wont bitch but i think Sam isn't such an Emma minion as i first thought. &nbsp; Art today was  really  pointless, we had a party that lasted about 3 quarters on an hour then Emma and Jo put dirty fingerprints all over my back which i was really pissed off about but i didn't say anything because it made me look better than Jo who was complaining about one small pink splodge on her t shirt. We left an hour early so Emma and Richard walked home but Jo and I can't so we stayed and talked with Sam and Danielle which was ok. &nbsp; oh great, my mums home, we can finally eat.

      One and a half days left of school! it  should &nbsp; be spent doing nothing or playing games or watching videos but us poor year 10's are doing moutains of coursework! i think it's frightfully immoral. Genny and Jake are coming home talking about how they're doing no work, grrrrrr. &nbsp; I just thought i'd finished my essay but now i see i've missed a whole section! i'm hungry, i'll wait till after my delicious sasuage and pasta to finish it. &nbsp; We're going away on the 31st and coming back on the 14th (i think). Emma's having her sleepover, which is going to be a hippy sleepover on the 15th so i'm gonna be sooooo exhausted. oh well. i'm just annoyed i'm going away for 2 weeks! i think thats a little bit greedy of my parents. &nbsp; I've found someone to see Shrek with! I'm being a lovely big cousin and taking Ben and Joe on friday, should be fun, at least they're well behaved, well Ben is, i'm not always too sure about Joe. &nbsp; It was our last drama lesson with Mr. Piercy today *sobs* :p. We gave him 2 cards, ahhhhhh. i hope we don't get the fat woman next year. &nbsp; This last year has gone past sooo quickly, shame, as it's been a really good year. oh well, year 11 might be good too. Daniel's hopefully coming back to 6th form! yay! i hope he does!  Andy's not, oh well, don't care that much. &nbsp; It actually felt quite summery today for once. I hope it's nice in the holidays and for Emma's hippy sleepover!

      very funny lines from 'dog friday' a tape book i listened to years ago, Sundance yells 'blood, blood BLOOOOD!' when Ant and Perry fall through the greenhouse roof. anyway, i bit my ugly mouth thing and it went huge so i popped it to let the blood out and there's lots of blood (sadly it wont dissapear altogether) &nbsp; Went over to Calcot today, it was ok. only ate a muffin for lunch and we did a bit of aimless wandering but it was just me, Emma, Daniel, Andy and Luke instead of hundreds of Daniel's friends who i don't know. We sat around and talked most of the time. &nbsp; HA! i feel all clever, Jo's having a go at me for taking the piss out of going to church camp, i'm just doing it coz it annoys her but she then went on about how i don't know anything about the true meaning of christmas or christainity, i went to a church school for 2 and a third years and i've read my childrens bible. I am not as ignorant as she thinks, HA to her. &nbsp;  Our new sofa has arrived, my dad is completely in love with it, he hardly likes to leave it. teehee.   Last night my cousin, Dom, kept bringing all the cushions in the living room over to my dad, it was so funny, he is so so cute! (Dom, not my dad) if you say 'go away dominic' he'll say 'go away mummy/daddy' and he says 'my daddy' in a really cute voice    &nbsp;  g2g my parents are shcoked i'm on the computer, grrrr sadists    &nbsp; &nbsp;

      I am so tired, i didn't go to bed really late last night but Julia came home from a wedding at about 1 in the morning and instead of ringing the doorbell like a normal person she threw stones at my window to wake me up to let her in. I was half asleep and was a bit surprised to find things being thrown at my window. &nbsp; I made my hair go curly! i was amazed it actually worked for once. I'd love to have ringletty hair that i could poke my fingers through, that would be fun! &nbsp; Went to look at sofas,  not  my idea of a fun afternoon but hohum for some reason Genny and i had to go just to agree with my parents that the sofas they had chosen were fine. &nbsp; My odd mood from wednesday seems to have carried on a bit, but i keep being grumpy and annoyed by stuff instead of sad. I'm proberbly just tired, or attention seeking (subconciesly) or something. &nbsp; I'm sooo tired, an early night for me tonight i think! :p &nbsp; Today's been ok altogether, it's nice having lots of people to talk to, but it now seems to be the joke of the weekend that i'm fat. Everybody keeps talking about my fattness. teehee it is quite funny, (even if i did used to be fat, or a 'large lass' as Julia put it) i so was never fat! &nbsp; I'm kinda looking forward to Germany now, hopefully it shouldn't be too bad, after all we have new tent and we don't go camping in the summer as much as we did in New Zealand, i so hope we can go there next year, but i doubt we will :( I said a while ago when Michele commented that i should blog about her that i'd blog about New Zealand, i'll do that soem other time, can't be bothered now. &nbsp; ciao darlings

      My  entire  family have invaded my peaceful household, I have always wanted abig family, full of people, so i quite enjoy having a temporary one for a bit. Fortunatly in the new house i do not have to give up my room or have anybody staying in it :D &nbsp; Genny's friend Cherie was crying today, and noone knows why...ooooh a mystery! Jake says me might have an idea but he won't tell me. Maybe he'll tell Genny. &nbsp; I think i might have my hair cut again, i can't stand it long, i can't wear it down and it feels weird all tied up so i'm thinking i'll have it cut, i wanted it long for the summer because we're going camping and i wanted to plait it but it's not long enough. &nbsp; Writing on my blog is different now, there is new stuff to add like different fonts and stuff, i don't know why i'm bothering to write that as everyone who reads this has a blog so therefore will know. &nbsp; I have so much coursework to do this weekend, grrrrr why do they leave it till the end of term then give us heaps of work? &nbsp; My dad is very nice, he is keeping my secret from my mum for me and he said he might take me to Reading rock! isn't that nice! he might not, it was a 'hypothetical question' &nbsp; I have finished my book, it had a very happy ending (apart from that the dog was dead, but his son was still living) but now i have nothing left to read and i'm going through a big reading phase because of only an hour on the computer or tv. &nbsp; Ha! i was talking to Jo Buswell and she kept going on and on about how fit Mr. Piercy is and do i think he is 'sooo gorgeous' and i was like 'er, well i'm personally not attracted to teachers' teeheehee. &nbsp; Natasha says we are going to get the fat woman next year, i hope not! &nbsp; I keep going on and on about random stuff but it really annoys me when i forget things i want to say so i'm trying to remember everything. &nbsp; Genny and i went to get some milk (and chocolate) and we just spend the whole way there and back yelling about things we were annoyed about such as our hair, me wanting Genny's clothes, Cherie and Hannah being friends, Beth and her monolouges about how perfect she is, ugliness, my trousers falling down and gennys, and lots and lots more, it was actually quite fun. &nbsp; My uncle has just arrived, i have to babysit tonight(for my cousins, not my uncle :s) for 'a modest wage', translates as 'not a lot' &nbsp; I should be going to Emma's on wed, i hope, she's getting really bad about letting me down, but at the moment we're getting on really well again which is great. &nbsp; We're planning lots of things to do in the holidays, lots of sleepovers and going over each others houses (her's more than mine) hopefully without Sam (oh i'm such a bitch!) Holidays hopefully should be fun :) i'm gonna make sure i get out and do lots instead of staying stuck at home like last time, but i'm getting on better with Emma and Andy, which i wasn't at Easter and hopefully see lots of my other millions of friends as well. &nbsp; My legs are really gross, i'll make myslef look beautiful tomorrow, i don't have drama and i'm not going out so lots of time for homework and beautifying &nbsp; anyway i think i've rambled enough and Jake is saying to me 'when's Genny coming online' ungrateful swine. &nbsp; toodlepip &nbsp;

      My book was very sad, i had tears streaming down my cheeks, onto my neck and down my top. This man's dog, his lifelong companion over hundreds of years (they both drank an anti aging drink which means they can live for thousands of years) anyway, the dog dies! it is so,so sad! Then before the dog dies he leaves Vienna where he has been living and he's friends with this woman, Claudia and secretly she loves him then he leaves and she's really sad and he tries to make it work and she says 'i love more than i am loved' and that just seems so sad! I was rather sad and melacholy, then i came on msn and Jon said it was stupid to cry over a book. i don't think it is, i often cry over books. i do think it's stupid to cry over adverts for abandoned dogs (which i do, i am ashamed to admit) Anyway then i ate some delicious chocolate yumyumyum and it's getting late now and i want to carry on reading so i'm off to maybe cry some more.

      Julia, Jim, Joe and Dom have arrived, Ben is staying with George tonight, he obviously doesn't love us sobsobsobsob :p Julia and my mum are already catching up on the goss about tables and sunbeds gone wrong and wine and stuff I'm very glad they are here but i know in a few days i'll be driven mad, thats why my family are cooking chocolate, after a few bites you feel sick, after a few days you're tired. I might escape this weekend for a bit, maybe not though, depends who can fit me into their busy sceduals and whether i can be bothered. I don't think i have any interesting news hmmm well i didn't feel all weird today like yesterday which was good, i don't know what was wrong with me, very strange!  just have to say, i don't need to worry about Emma anymore! yay! I hope she is more sensible in the future, i have to go eat yummy spag bol now  tarra

      I kept crying this afternoon, not really, really crying, just getting tears in my eyes, it was over so many silly things. I don't think anyone noticed, if you don't blink then tears can't fall out. A few people asked if i was ok. i don't know why i was like this, i'm not usually like this. i just kept wanting to cry.  have to go move furniture tarra

      In terms of chocolate, my mum is a malteaser, my dad is a mint aero, Emma is cadbury's dairy milk, Beth is double berry, Jon is lindt lindor, Daniel is a wispa, Andy is a galaxy, Genny is a penguin, My grandparents, cousins, aunts and uncles are cooking chocolate, my nanny is these willy wonka stick things i once had a couple of years ago, Sam is a crunchie, Luke is a mars bar, Jake is a belgian chocolate, Jo is fruit and nut, Natasha is chocolate ants, My tutor girlies are a sainsbury's take two. Filippa is a jaffa, Adam, Alex and James are kit kats....and thats all i can think of i don't know where that came from.  anyway, other news.... Emma and i have decided to give up bitching about people for a whole week. I'm not doing too well so far :S. I havn't bitched about any of my friends which is good but i just had to voice my thoughts on Megan, yesteday in drama and then the drama performance today. anyway, apart from that...  For the last 2 days i have been geting on really well with Emma again, we seem to have got closer again, i like that, i think. We spent a whole hour in tech yesterday talking, not bitching or talking about Andy either, just talking about stuff. We've been planning stuff too, something i love to do with Emma, we plan parties, sleepovers, holidays, we hardly ever do them but it's great fun planning them :D.  I'd write more but i have to go help my mum with something  ciao daaaaaaaaaaaarlings

      It was the CDR open day party thing today so no more file making hurrah! There was a staff meeting so i took over as receptionist. I turned out to be a fantastic receptionist! i answered the phones and took messages and i sent a few important emails regarding important things. I am so much more above ugly work experience boy (James) i tried to boss him around using my new status but he remaind unbossed and as i couldn't make up get me a drink of water i had to go thirsty, hurumph. (i couldn't have got it myself or he would have taken my chair and become the receptionist) I kept commenting on what a great receptionist i was all day, Jmaes said i was a fake and a phoney and that i was actually a work experience student which i thought was being a but rude to his superiors (me, the receptionist) I got on very well with the oringinal receptionist and helped her give out name tags at the door. everybody commented on what a lovely helpful student/ receptionist i was :D  anyway, today was a lot better than the rest of the week exept i didn't have anything to eat untill 3 so i was a bit peckish. Oh, and there was this really rude man who didn't have a name tag so i had to make him one. James asked his name and he mumbled 'hugh crabtree' now i didn't hear this so when i had to write it down i asked him what his name was again and he said 'hugh crabtree, same as before' in a rather rude manner. Then i accindently wrote 'huge' instead of 'hugh' and he said ' a common mistake' in a nasty sarky voice then i asked him to spell his last name coz he mumbled and i ddnt have a clue what it was he'd said and he said 'it's like a crab and a tree and put them together' in an equally nasty voice. after he went off to mingle me, James, the original receptionist (who's name is Pam) and another woman called Heidi, i think, bitched about him, mwahahaah. We had caricatures drawn, the man asked James if he had any hobbies and i told him miniture tea pot collecting so the artist drew him with teapots and him saying 'i'm a little tea pot short and stout' so James told the artist i loved on a monkey farm so drew me as a monkey. teeheehee fun. and then i got to go home early coz my mum came to the open day, yay! alltogether a good day exept i'm ment to be going to Emma's and she's let me down, again :( it's her parents wedding anniversary so i can't really blame her but i know if it was andy who was coming over she'd make and effort to argue and she'd fight untill he was allowed. she said 'lets meet up on sunday then' and i was like 'hmmm i'll have to see', now why not saturday? because she's seeing andy!!!!!!!!!!! oh emma, i'm sooo glad u can fit me into ur busy andy seeing scedual this weekend. i DON'T think so. this weekend i'm going to be busy, one day i'm going to go out (not sure where yet :s) and the other day i'm gonna do homework, shame emma. hohum, going to chat now tarra

      I'm really not having fun on work experience (only 2 days left though yay!) The best thing about today was talking to people on MSN. It was so,so good to actually talk, instead of being absolutly silent all day, i could talk but i have absolutly nothing in common with the 2 other girls. I spent all morning emailing and talking on msn. Weirdly i am missing all my friends a lot, usually i can go for about 2 weeks without missing anybody, i have Genny and even my parents are better company than most of the people i work with. Lunch was ok, i went into the village with James again, i wish i could work with him, i could actually have a conversation with him. He's there for 2 weeks! i am so, so glad i am not him. I am so starved of decent conversation that i'm getting obsessed with going on msn again, after next week i'm not gonna go online quite as much but i feel so cut off from the entire world stuck in Goring (it takes about half an hour to get there from burghfield!)It's ok for James, all his friends live in Goring. I can't WAIT to see Emma on friday, recently i havn't got paticually enthusiastic about seeing her but i would be excited about seeing ANYONE at the moment (well maybe not anyone, lets exclude some people i don't like) Everyday i just can't wait to get home, i thought work experience would be ok, sometimes it's not to bad i just wish i was doing something i'm really interested in. oh god! i can't stand going back to school and have Beth going on and on about what a great time she's had. oh well, it'll be good to be back *shocked face* i think i'd prefer maths to another day of doing nothing exept making a few files (which is impossible, why can't they make files easier to make?!) This has been a very moany blog and(just to moan some more) why isn't anyone online! i'm going mad! need to talk to people who don't say 'oh my days' and seriosly mean it. moan moan moan lets think of good things. umm my mum is coming to the CDR open day on fri which hopefully means i can get home earlier. I'm going to Emmas on friday, thats good :D i did have good conversations on msn today and talked to michele, very cool. umm i cooked a great dinner and my parents we'rnt home to eat it so genny and i were able to drink the rest of the soup up with a ladle and not be told off for being disgusting i'm re reading 'the beach' which is an excellent book and has kept me occupied in otherwise boring situations today  there, lots of good things too :D

      I'm at work at the moment, they don't seem to be able to think of anything for us to do so they're letting us go on the internet and do whatever. i've been having some nice chats untill people had to go off to bed. But i'm still chatting to chris, the poor dear (i'm such a granny) he's very bored stuck at home with broken feet. lalalala not a lot to say, i think i'll have a chicken tikka sandwich for lunch.  i'm going to emma's on fri, yumyum should be fun and gossipy, she's going to the cinema on thursday with andy, i shudder to think of it, a dark room with so many people in it is going to be so tempting ...teehee (PRIVATE JOKE :p) teeheeheehee  boredybored i need to do lots of homework, oh well, do when i get home

      Work experience was better today, i don't much like the two other girls doing it but i was with James as well today so that was cool. He took me into the village to get a sandwich as i couldn't remember (i need to improve my spatial memory) We were doing all these 'cognitive tests' this morning and doing stuff about memeory and reactions and stuff.  In the afternoon we had to make up a cognitive test but the two girls we were with were kinda intimidating and James and i didn't feel like saying much coz whenever we did they'd just stare at us like were mad. Then Isobel, who was one of the science ppl we were working with came in and they were rude to her so Holly came in and told them to come with her so James and i did it by ourselves and they were really impressed. *sparkle sparkle* Trouble is i'm just not that interested in drug reseach and they all think we are so keep rambling on and on. oh well.  Emma and Andy are so childish! they both keep moaning on to me about their stupid problems with each other. They both love each other, grrr.

      not paticually interesting. I stuck some labels on floppy disks, made some folders and stuck some labels on envelopes. Oh the joys! There are 3 other work experience people,James who i'm not working with because he's there for 2 weeks so is doing something else and 2 other girls who seem ok.  yawn yawn i'm tired. I'm a bit annoyed that there arn't more people online to gossip with. oh well shame shame. I prefer talking to people in real life anyway.  I'm gonna see Emma on friday, should be a giggle, we're geting on a bit better at the mo, i suppose thats good.  Genny and my mum went to see Shrek 2, now i have to find someone to go with, what a hassle!  laaaadedaaaaaaaa i can't think of anything else to mention

      I don't really have much to blog about, it being a sunday and i never do anything exept mooch about on a sunday. i am unwisly using up my one hour on the computer (unfairness) to do nothing much, just can't be bothered to do homwork and all that stuff. I babysat last night which was cool coz they have sky tv *grin grin* I watched 'The Sweetest Thing' which was crap and had no story line. i think whoever made it just thought that some more sex should be shown in cinemas or something. The i watched 'America's Sweethearts' which was ok but the end was a bit stupid, the sister of the famous woman fancied the famous womans husband then they eventually got together which i think is silly because i would never ever want to get together with someone who prefered someone who was always liked more than me, i'd want someone who never prefered that other person such as the sister in this film. Anyway, then i came home and was so tired i fell straight into bed and went to sleep only to be awakened by my mother at some indecently early time in the morning. it's not fair, when i was little i'd get into bed with my parents at about 7 in the morning and wake them up and they'd always complain about not getting a lie-in but theses days they don't let me ahve a lie-in. It's their bitter and twisted minds at work here. Although actually my parents arn't too cruel, they're not making me go to Genny's guitar concert which is great! i can't STAND the guitar concerts and always make sure i'm doing something else. I know that sounds mean on Genny but she doesn't care, the only time she cares is if she's made to go and see something of mine which is hardly ever. my Nanny and my auntie are coming for a visit, hahaha they have to go to Genny's concert teehee, although they don't talk much so it'll be ok for them, they can just sit and think about, whatever they think about. dogs, proberbly. when they're out i might watch 'The Importance of being Earnest' i bought it yesterday, it was really cheap and i keep spotting cheap things and buying them, they just call out 'Alice! buy me buy me, i'm half price!' and that kinda stuff. i did stop myself buying a nice red skirt though so maybe i'm gaing some self control :D i hope my hair stays nice :s i put it up in my bandana to clean out the rabbit hutch, it had better not curl, grrrr. it fells straight, a good sign i think i might stop wittering on about my hair now and go tarra

      I went into town with Genny today, am i really sad? going with my little sister into town? We went and saw 'Mean Girls' it was ok, the sort of thing Genny and i would watch when we're having one of our 'girly video nights' when our parents go out. We didn't stay very long in town, last year i used to go in all the time, now when i go in i get bored so usually go to the cinema, what did i used to do? The end of term is so close! scary! this year has gone past so fast! i want year 11 to go sloooooow, i don't want to do exams and stuff, argh scary. I'm going babysitting tonight, lots of money! :D i need to do all this homework i have, grr, i know i'll proberbly end up doing it next sunday :s oh well, i think i might go and have a shower now, my hair feels icky

      it seems like FOREVER since i last blogged, my parents banned us from the internet and tv!!!! they think we have bad attitudes! just because my mum was in a bad mood. my dad immediatly took her side, he wanted to ban us for 2 weeks and make me rewrite my english essay by hand! i never knew he was such a sadist! now they've got a new rule that we are only allowed to 'stare at a screen' (as they put it) for 1 hour a day, so thats both computer AND tv! which is a bit tight but i can't argue or i'll be banned forever. Jon's just said that he'd walk out if that was him but he's an internet obsesed freak. So, i havn't been in the best of moods this week. Tomorrow i feel quite lucky that i only have drama because i have my work experience interview then we have drama to perform instead of science then it's sponsor day. i hope it doesn't rain, i don't feel like having lessons. hohum, i can't think of anything to say now, the excitement of being back online has made me feel all giddy and happy :D i have gossip! but sadly i can't write it down because it's secret gossip! i think i might be allowed to tell next month or next year or something. oh well heeheeeheee i know goss! i feel smug!
