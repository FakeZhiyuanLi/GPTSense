						     Detroit has been great.  It was absolutely evident that God brought Erica and I there for a reason and that reason was to experience new places, new situations, and most importantly new people.  We were so incredibly blessed by the people that God brought into our lives for the first year of marriage.  If you are reading this and you are one of those people, let me say thank you so much.  Thank you for blessing our lives with your examples and your constant encouragement that turned so many tough situations into just a bunch of fun trusting our Savior.  He is so amazing and always knows just what we need for us to be made more mature.  So many of you are more mature than I and I aspire to pursue my relationship in Christ like you do.  Please continue to keep me (and us) in your prayers as I continue to do the same for you.  Rick, Mike, Wally, Todd, and Scott (among others) I am so encouraged by you and really think it is interesting to see where God is taking us all and the ministries that he has prepared for us in different parts of the country. Let us always be obedient to where he is calling us!!!!     Anyways, we are back in Indiana tonight (which is a dream come true) and are really excited about what the future holds.  Last night it was kickin' it in Detroit with both of our families watching a little Shrek 1 (with the Lakers game interspersed) tonight we are relaxing with my family in Detroit, and tomorrow we will be worshipping alongside several of our friends and family at a great church in Ft. Wayne and celebrating the graduation of several seniors (from high school) that have made it despite great odds. It's going to be a great weekend.  By the way, go Pacers!!!  I like the Pistons, but lets be honest, it's tough to compete with Hoosiers.  Glad to be home, JJ

						   Really searching hard for a good house to buy in Indiana.  It seems like things have happened so quickly getting right back in the swing of things here.  Erica and I are staying in the house that I grew up in, with the people I grew up with.  I'm the oldest in a family of four with a single mom, and yes, we are all there in that house together this summer!  What a great chance to share fellowship and community with the one's you love!  Or, more realistically, what a great chance to find out things about each other that you had no knowledge of previously!  Just kidding, but it is definitely an adjustment for Erica and I to be there without the space and privacy that we are used to.  And, I'm sure it is an a adjustment for my family as well to have a couple of newlyweds in their midst all the time.  They definitely are privy to sides of us that they would not normally get to experience not living in the same house!  It's pretty interesting!  I'm pretty sure that our living arrangement for the summer could be made into some form of reality television and that we could profit in some form.  But wait, even in the most heated discussions, language is mild, and we actually conduct ourselves with some form of human decency, and there is no form of infidelity or moral compromise, so it probably wouldn't generate the ratings that are necessary to produce such a show.  Although, there may be a couple of American Idol stars in the mix!  Have you ever seen Erica do a William Hung impersonation?  Just kidding, she doesn't really do one. So, enough of the rambling.....I'm glad that the Piston's humiliated the Lakers last night, congratulations to all of you Detroit fans who I rooted so valiantly against during the Pacers series (the Pacers could not have done what Detroit did to LA).  I'm very, very excited to meet Scott Sample's latest addition to the Sample family....great job Tiff!  And I am thankful that God has brought so many incredible people into my life that all show me a glimpse into what true love, friendship, and loyalty look like.  Signing off, still looking for a good house, JJ

						   I thought I'd title this posting "under attack."  First, because the Pacers seem to be having trouble warding off the attack of the pistons and their aggressive attack and control of the boards.  And, secondly, because it seems I have been struggling of late warding off the poisonous arrows of the enemy.  It just really seems that I've been experiencing more temptation than usual.  Anybody else feeling that way lately?  Please continue to pray for me and my family.  Oh, and by the way, hopefully we'll see you Pistons fans in game 7.

						   Finally found a house that we liked here in Indiana.&nbsp; It is a sweet little ranch with 4 bedrooms and a nice deck out on the backyard complete with storage shed and great climbing tree.&nbsp; Now, we just have to wait for everything to come together from a paperwork/finance/closing perspective.&nbsp; This is really good as we were both starting to get anxious with the start of school just around the corner.&nbsp; Had a great weekend at the lake with family!&nbsp; The weather was great and we had the chance to play some bball and get some sun as well!&nbsp; Really felt God tugging at my heart all weekend to continue to pray for transformation into that which he is moving me towards.&nbsp; It seems like he wants to come in and totally overhaul who I am right now and move me towards something brand new and exciting.&nbsp; Sounds kind of painful, but I think I'm up for it.&nbsp; He is a God of radical transformation through his love.&nbsp; Anyways, just wanted to drop a quick journal here and then get back to work....hope everybody is learning, growing, and being transformed as well!&nbsp;   Jay
