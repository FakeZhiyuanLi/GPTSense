      Welcome, flesh of my flesh and blood of my blood. This blog has been established for all of us to use, hopefully opening up some extra lines of communication between all of us. We know how hard it is to share everything that's going on when we live so far apart and talk only occasionally. Gone are those days. Let us partake in the free exchange of thoughts, feelings, and experience...and maybe some pictures, too. I want to know what's going on in the minds and lives of those I hold dear. Please join me on this excursion...or else we'll have a vote and disown you.

        Mikeee...I downloaded the 'Hello' picture thing because I want to put my picture on my profile. I've opened the picture, but I have no idea how to get the picture onto my profile. Is this making any sense? lol I asked dad and he couldn't figure it out. Help me! I'm melting ...

      What's this I hear about someone and their Honey Nut Chewies getting a possible "big break". What's up? Are you going public? When can I expect to see them in my mall's foodcourt?

      Only kidding.  I'm honored to join this fine assembly of folk.  The link to join from my initial invitation didn't work, however; success has been had.  I am here.  Prepare for stories and lessons untold (seriously, I won't be telling any here, or. . . maybe I will).

      As a father of four children, I am richly blessed. I mean, honestly, I had NO idea how rewarding being a father would become. At age 24, When Mike was born that chilly day at Travis AFB, California, on December 26th, 1976, I had no real clue about fathering. The Lord, however, has all along. And here I sit now more than twice the age I was when Mike was born, and I'm still learning and wondering if I'll ever get it right. Sometimes I really  struggle  with what it takes to be a good father. Oh, some of the ususal "stuff" is fairly easy, but other parts of parenting are near impossible. Take for example "letting go." As a good father it is my natural inclination to spare my children from harm, and so when I see trouble headed their way I try to save them from it. God -- who loves us far more than any earthly father ever can -- loves us in a different way. I'm sure He takes no joy in seeing His children (us) harmed, but He loves us enough to let us make mistakes and be hurt by our unwise choices. I suppose He knows better that if we didn't make that  specific  mistake we would not learn and grow. As an earthly father I sometimes have to fight very hard my desire to protect my children, and instead allow them to make poor choices and be hurt in the process... It hurts me a lot to have to deal with issues like that -- I can't describe the anguish -- but I think it would hurt me a lot more to watch my children avoid a skirmish now but lose the war later, if ya know what I mean...  Love, Dad '8^)

        Well well well ... today was the first day of school :) :P I dreaded waking up at 5:30am because I've gotten barely any sleep over the entire weekend. I'm about to fall asleep at the keyboard. Oh wait, I have to talk about Saturday first. I spent most of the day with Jonathan at the park just goofing off and acting like little kids. That evening I went with his family, Tiff came, too, to KY to a drive-in movie theatre! It was a perfect night ... we were in KY so there was nothing around so the stars were gorgeous! It got in the low 50's which was really nice (a little chilly), but we cuddled all night so it wasn't too bad :) The drive-in was playing Princess Diaries 2, which was cute, and IRobot, which was better. I hope we go again before it closes in September. I had so much fun. Ok ... back to school. The first thing I have to say is that, for the first time in several years, I didn't worry about what I was going to wear on the first day of school (applause!). Yay for Lisa! I'm a senior and I'm so excited, but not about waking up before the sun almost every morning. Anyway, since today was a half day a bunch of my friends and I went out to lunch. I had to mooch off of Sarah's plate because I only had $1. Oops. I called Jonathan and we got together afterward, and spent hours at Crockett Park :) Mike, I'm doing you a favor and keeping all the lovey dovey thoughts strictly to my journal. I gotta have props though ... this is hard man! Well, I have to finish my egg-in-the-hole before it gets cold. I have to go to bed early, too. Shoot! I have to do my laundry. Night! P.S. I love my Shawny Mac!

       This week I made the trek down to Columbus, Georgia for two graduate courses in Hebrew at Beacon University. I should have known I would be in for a rough ride as I arrived on the southwest side of Atlanta and realized I was following The Weather Channel's " Storm Stories " van. I thought, "What's with that?" I mean, after all, it was a beautiful sunny day... not for long! The next 90 miles on the interstate were spent at 40MPH with the car's hazard lights flashing and the windshield wipers going as fast as they could. I honestly expected to see the ark float by any minute. It was the longest torrential downpour I've ever experienced.  I arrived, safely, and spent the remainder of that day, all of the following, and more than half of the next in classes -- 6 semester hours of Hebrew within 3 days... okay, I'm a glutton for punishment? The classes were awesome, and Dr. Cottle is a fantastic teacher. I made the 6-hour drive home Thursday and returned to work yesterday (Friday). I now have two final projects to complete, each working with 8 passages of Scripture. The class is exegeting all of Psalm 119, and will publish the work when finished. I am doing verses 1-16.  Well, time to feed Theo his breakfast, take the garbage to the dump, and head off to church for worship team practice. Shalom!  Dad (patriarch of the Jones Clan until Mikey takes over...)

        Today I woke up at 1:30 ... pm lol. But then again I didn't go to bed until 2am this morning. I spent the entire day in my pjs talking to Jonathan for hours and hours. When I wasn't talking to him I was organizing the photo box. Four hours to be exact. Ouch my back! So nobody at home better touch it haha. Anywho, I'm still listening to Shawn McDonald :) It's been like almost 3 days straight hehe. Dad just got back a couple of hours ago from taking another language class in Georgia or whatever :P Hebrew or something ... smarty pants. Alrighty, I'm going to end this now. Night!

          Wow it's really late. Lately I've been staying up until the wee hours of the morning talking online with Jonathan. For what other reason on this planet would I be up so late? I'm talking to him right now, and I just wanted to let everyone know that I have the best boyfriend, and I'm so proud to say that he's all mine!   He's incredible and I love him so much. He bought me the  urlLink Shawn McDonald  cd that just came out today, which made my night so awesome. I am so excited about it :) I have been listening to it nonstop for hours. I love you!

      Mom, Just so you know...you don't have to introduce yourself here. Whenever you post a comment or create a new post it tells everyone else who wrote it ("Mom said..."). And we are the only Jonze family using this blog (I think - hello, anyone else out there? anyone? anyone?), so there are no other "Mom"s around for us to get confused with you. Also, if you're wondering why you're name hasn't shown up on the right with the rest of us, don't worry. It'll show up there once you create a new post of your own. Anyway, love you and welcome to the BLOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOGGGGGGGGG!!!!!

      Well, after several failed attempts and much toil and trouble, it looks as though Lisa and I have finally succeeded. She is now officially in the Jonze Family Blog! I had to create a new email address just so I could send an invite to it and then go check it myself and accept the invitation. After I did this, it worked the first time. So Lisa is now a member. And she even got a  urlLink new email address  out of it.  Welcome, sister! Do join in on all the blogging madness as soon as you can, Lis... If anybody else has been having trouble joining the blog after I sent them invitations, maybe I can do the same thing for them (cough, cough - achem, Tiff and Matt!)

      Just wanted to let everyone know that I'm going to be getting my wisdom teeth pulled soon. Sorta dreading the experience but it really needs to be done before they cause more damage to my good teeth and before they get really painful. I had a meeting with the doctor yesterday and Dana found out today that our insurance will cover 60% of the procedure's cost. So that's good news. I still have to set a date for the surgery. Well, just wanted to tell you guys about that. Next time you see me it'll be with four less teeth than the last time you saw me.

      Hi, everyone. Dana and I attended another wedding this weekend. That makes two in eight days! Dana was a bridesmaid in both weddings. They were both pretty fun. I think we liked this last one better, though, since it was at the same place that our wedding was held. It was really nice, as I'm sure you all remember. And Dana looked absolutely beautiful in her dress, with her hair done up all cute, and wearing the diamond earrings I gave her for our anniversary. I couldn't take my eyes off of her for most of the wedding and reception. I'm a lucky man! Our friends, Emily and Ryan, who got married yesterday, hired salsa dancers to come to the reception. They performed a couple dances just for entertainment and it was really cool to watch, but then they also gave a lesson on the basic steps of salsa. Yes, I did go up to the dancefloor and, yes, I did participate. It was more fun than I was expecting it to be. The only problem was that I was sandwiched in the back of all the people, smooshed between two older ladies and pressed up against the DJ's table. So I didn't have enough room to do some of the steps. I didn't want to run over those poor old bagels!  Anyway, here's some pictures of us yesterday. These weren't taken at the wedding, though. They were taken at Dana's parents' home. After the reception was over, we stopped by to spend a little time with them and Michelle. We were still dressed up so we had them snap a few photos for us before we changed into some more comfortable clothes. Enjoy!
