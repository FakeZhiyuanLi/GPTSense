      Yesterday I started my hip-hop intensive...it's so much fun! We're doing a dance to Britney Spears' "Toxic" but it's not all girly. It actually looks like hip-hop! We're doing break dancing and popping and locking (all hip-hop terms). The first hour of the class is pilates. It's a good stretch but it's also a great workout, my abs are hurting! Then the second hour we do conditioning and we practice so essential moves. Then the last hour we work on our dance! It's great! Yesterday I also took the one and a half hour ballet class...that was killer! Most of the company was there and they were doing things I've never even heard of, but I kept up! It's kinda fun not being the best in my class because then I work alot harder so I can get up to their level. I can't go next week because of yearbook camp but the week after that I'm definately going! I need a challenge!&nbsp; urlLink

      Last night I hung out with Kamae. It was fun, we went and saw 50 First Dates at the dollar theatre, so it was cheap! I loved not having to pay like $15 to go do something! I'm starting to feel like I need new friends. Kamae is great but I am getting kind of bored with my old friends.  Especially Deana...  That girl makes me so mad sometimes! She treats me like I'm a convenience to her. I put more into our friendship than she's ever done on anything in her life. She treats me like crap if she's having a bad day and I'm tired of it! She makes me feel bad about myself, but in reality she really feels bad about  herself . Whatever...I say I don't care but I really do. But I'm tired of always trying to fix things with her. Like the other day, for example, she pissed me off. I was driving and I saw her and her brother and her brother waved and everything so I waved to him but she didn't even turn around, so I drove on. She texts me like 5 minutes later and is all "Somethin wrong?" And I was like "What do you mean?" She proceeds to tell me how we haven't talked in awhile (keen grasp of the obvious there Deana!) and that she's heard from all these people that I'm mad at her and that there's something going on with Gerry, her boyfriend. So I tried to go off on her and she stopped talking to me and I thought I had made her feel bad. But she probably didn't even care. That night I called her and apologized cuz I just can't be mean to someone you know!? It was bad!   Just certain things are really getting to me about our friendship, like the fact that she calls me a slut and a whore all the time. I know she's joking but when I tell her stop she gets all offended and asks "Can't you take a freakin joke?" But when I say something like that to her, she gets all pouty and says "Fine, whatever! God I hate people!" Come on!!!!!! Get over yourself! It makes me so mad! Sometimes I just wanna tell her how I feel but I don't even know how I'd express it in words! It makes me so upset! Alex said "Tell Deana to fuck off!" I should! The only time she talks to me is to tell me how she went out and "partied hard" the night before. Ya, ok Deana! The only person besides me she's hung out with is Aspen. I love Aspen, but she's really not all that popular and cool. I'm not trying to say that I'm trying to have a popularity conference, but Deana makes me feel so bad about myself sometimes I have to say things like this to reassure myself. I was the one that made varsity soccer. Her boyfriend used to like me. More people want to hang out with me than her. I'm more rounded, smarter, prettier, funnier, and WAY less dramatic. Now I understand why so many people don't like her! Oh well, she is my best friend so maybe on the way to yearbook camp I can talk with her.

      Goin to California...on the 14th of July! I'm so excited! The only bad thing is that I'm going to miss dance auditions, but I might be able to schedule a private audition. So whatever! If I miss it, I miss it. There was a girl who was in a lot of my classes last year and half-way through the year they let her join the performing troop. I have to call Carrie and make sure she's still going to try out. I don't want to be the only 16 year old in the  junior repetory !  So excited about going to Cali! I get to see my grandparents and my cousins and my friends! I might even be able to go to the beach! That would be tight! And since I'm driving my car it'll be twice as fun as it was before!   cali cali cali cali cali cali cali!!!!

       urlLink    Italian Leather Handbag&nbsp; urlLink    My mom just got back from Italy today! I'm really excited for her! She had a lot of fun. She bought this really cute pink italian leather shoulderbag (like the one in the picture, except it's not that same brand or color). She also brought me some  really  cute clothes.   I missed her alot, but tomorrow is my last day with her for awhile. Starting Sunday I'm house-sitting again. I get done with that on Saturday. But then me and Deana are going up to Ft. Collins and then Greeley for yearbook camp. And I'll be gone until July 1. Then sometime in July I'm going to start a nanny job for a really rich couple, and then I'm going to California! I'm so excited!

      Starting June 1st, my dance studio is offering summer classes and intensives! I'm so excited!  On Monday through Friday, from 10:00AM to 1:00PM I'm going to a Hip-hop/Jazz/Pilates Intensive. It's going to be so much fun! Screw trying out for softball! I can't even catch the damn ball! Dance is something I already know I'm good at and I know that I'll be able to stay in shape with it. I'm going to call the softball coach tomorrow and tell him "Sorry, but there will be no softball for me! I just wanna dance!"  I was talking to my old ballet teacher about going to NYU and she said that if I do go there that I should try to take at least 3 dance classes outside of school. I've heard that there are tons of great studios on every corner! And since New York runs on the Subway I won't get too terribly lost driving! I'm so excited, next summer I'm going to try to go look at some colleges on the East Coast and while I'm there maybe catch a NY performance or something!

      I'm going to try to start girl's soccer thing this summer. I did it last year but only me and Deana went, and we just sat around on the grass!  One time we tried to teach ourselves how to slide tackle. It was so funny! All we ended up doing was running at the ball and sort of fell on our sides and stuck our foot out when we got close. But hey! You do what you can to get by in this world! lol  This year I just want to scrimmage if we can get enought people together. It's been raining alot lately, so some people might not want to come. But me and amanda will still play! During season last year it was pouring ice and snow and rain, all at the same time. Coach decided to hold practice inside the gym, but me and Amanda really wanted to play outside. So we put on our sweatshirts and ran up to the field. It had just been airraded or whatever that is when they pull up little pieces of dirt. So it was wet  and  muddy! It was so much fun! We were covered in dirt and mud! I loved it! So if it starts raining this summer during our little soccer scrimmage, me and Amanda will keep on playing!   urlLink    Amanda and me at our soccer banquet...."Kill coach!" lol&nbsp; urlLink
