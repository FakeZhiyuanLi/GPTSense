      Had another day at school today, nothing much happend as usual :P I decided Im bored of most of my subjects, english is almost the only class I dont fall asleep in. Next year Im definatley doing some artistic subjects, even if its only to get a break from this boring stuff! I also got a maths test back today, one which Id thought I aced.. I flunked it. I still havent decided what I am going to do in Computer Graphics and Design! ack! I'm gonna do some webdesign but what on? No idea, although Im liking drawing those ancient arab styled swords, so maybe a desert themed website :)  Im out, but i reccommend grooving to some songs from Eagles Of Death Metal! \m/  Bye.

      Had my first day back at school today, was very... ordinary :). English was kind of interesting and Computer Graphics and Design was okay. I really need to decide on my major project too :P. I think I am going to do a web design, what on I wonder? hmm.. thats my job for tonight think of a topic for my going-to-be-awesomely-groovy website :D

      I didn't get upto anything interesting today, other than bludging around home doing nothing in particular.. Back to school tommorow, eek! I didnt even end up choosing my major project topic today (as i planned) which was a bit of a bummer.  Here's to hoping next Term is even better than the last, and I do all the things I hope to do.  Good Evening, and Goodnight :)

      I have until the end of tommorow to have thought up, and started basic work on my Major Project in Computer, Graphics & Design! I cant believe it, I have so many weird ideas, but I dont want to start work on any of them because I have no idea if i will be able to finish any of them, let alone in the timeframe! With any luck I'll think of something stunning AND do-able in the next hour or two and then be able to start sketching and figuring out what to put in my brief tommorow.  Good Luck to Myself :)  Bye.

      I've been trying to figure out what i should do with my life recently, as all the things i currently do at school i dont quite feel 'comfortable' with, especially as a career path. I'm not sure but I would like to do something that is beneficial to someone or some people. I dont think i want to do something that is repeditive and established, I want to do something where i can push the boundaries a little.  I seem to have been drawn towards graphic design, because I guess I love art, and can draw well, but I lack the outgoingness or imagination (hmm well i do have an imagination, but I am more comfortable not letting the world know about it) to do well in a purely artistic career. And grapic design is sort of the middleman between my liking for visual art, and my logical well thoughtout personality, But even then I see myself burning out, I just dont have the artistic talent to last, I'd always be following the trends. So with graphic design gone, what else is there? Well im constantly using my computer so I take computer science classes. While I can pass them, I feel quite distant, bored even when just coding. I like the theoretical side, but dislike the doing part (which is critical to a career in Comp. Sci.) So there has to be something im missing out on! Some kind of design i think, as a used object with a good design is beneficial to the people using it and you can constantly be in search of the optimal design to meet functionality and ease of use. A major problem with my quest to find my place in life is that I cant rate my long term staying power, for instance I have never stuck with anything long-term (because its not for me, or because im not for anything?) so that impaires my judgement on what kind of career I could last at and enjoy doing for (heck) the rest of my days. But then again, statistically I will change careers five time in my working life, so how would I ever get to push the boundaries if I change careers that often. I wish there was a way for me to just live life and think and do what I may, when I may, for example for a while reflect on some problems then go and help a group of people acheive something they could be proud of. I just dont specialise, or get really into anything. And I dont know if ill ever find that job that is 'right' for me.. It's all so over my head and Im so confused, I dont want to continue my schooling when im so confused as I could waste away so many years of my life in the wrong field. The only way forward I see is to just keep on keeping on, trying a variety of subjects and continue to contemplate what really makes me happy in life.  Well thats all I can be bothered to write about for today, Bye.

      Well i finally got off my ass and updated this blog :)  Not much happening lately, except ive started doing some sketches, and ive been reading a little philosophy lately. I have a new resolution to try and find a decent sleep pattern, one that will fit into shape with everyone else's. Because my sleep cycle is too out of whack, I mean ive been noticing things like; I've been getting wierd things happening to my nails, which only happen when im going to school. While you could put that down to stress (hell maybe it is stress?) I have a little pet theory that maybe its because im not getting enough sleep on school days and maybe my nails arent getting enough time to do whatever they do :P (okay the stress explaination is sounding more rational now :)).   I watched a movie called 'Love Actually' today, which stars my kind-of-crush-on actress Keira Knightley. I thought it may be a little corny or what have you, but i actually found it to be quite nice, funny and made me feel good at the end. It also highlighted something to me, lately i have been looking to hard at the negatives in life: for example all the bad things that could happen if nihilism(the belief in nothingness, or that pain and suffering is inevitable, thats my take on it anyway) takes off, and how people might lose their morality and end up in a completely greedy and eventually brutal world. But this movie highlighted the positives for me, i think. For people like me who are born and raised atheist, have read religious books and when reading them have had no connection to them other than the moral examples they set (which is bringing me to the conclusion that religion was born to stave off nihilism, which would have prevented civilisation and all the good things that have come from it) but im not entirely sure if maybe it was some above average intelligent people that thought it up; because they could not find a reason for life; why they were there, or if it is somewhere locked inside of us, some kind of natural instinct.  So what are the right morals? are there any? I don't think so, except the ones that we are brought up to know and practise, but then how did we come up with morality? It certainly seems logical that it must have been something humanity came up with by itself, so does that mean there are right morals? or are there simply different 'inbuilt' moralities for different people? I think the latter is more to the point. But this also raises another question, how does things so terribly evil happen? how did the nazis do what they did without feeling extremely bad about it? maybe they did feel bad but were influenced so strongly by Hitler and his cohorts that they overrode there on morality with that what they were told was the correct one? But this means that some people are born with a conflicting moralty to the norm(or conflicting in some areas) because otherwise they would be no such thing as evil?  and if people are born with different moralities how can we hold one as more 'right' than the other?  This blogging thing is actually quite rewarding im finding, its an easy informal quasi-private way of letting out all my thoughts and worries (I'm by nature a very private person). I have no idea if anyone will ever read this, or if so when? (because of my shyness, I'm not sure wether I want people to know about what im thinking on a non-personal level :\) It also (if used often) may improve my writing skills, which arent too great at this very moment :P  Well thats all I've got time for tonight as I need to get some sleep :)

      I havent posted in... ages!  well not really all that much has been happening, I'm getting back into all the bands i used to listen to ages ago (well only a year or two)  School is going okay, a couple of things are slipping, but the majority is okay. Still havent really got started on my major project in Computer Graphics, although its going to be a website promoting the use of GNU/Linux as a high quality/low cost multimedia system. I hope it works :)
