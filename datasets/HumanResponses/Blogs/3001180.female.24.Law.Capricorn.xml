      I was randomly given an espresso brownie at Starbucks for being a regular customer.  That's pretty cool.  Tastey, too.

      It's amusing to me how ordering anything but a venti white mocha can completely flummox the people in Starbucks.  But I've found a hot chai works ever so much better on a sore throat.   It's funny how hearing a certain song can bring back memories.  I heard a song that the  urlLink Sirens  used to do while waiting in line for my Chai.  I really should drop TM a line.  Anyway, a quick glance at their website reveals that they're getting ready to release their first official CD.  It looks like they may be becoming as organized as the  urlLink T-tones .  And they're about to release another CD as well.  I'm sorry I missed both groups participating in West Side Story, I'm sure that would have been a great time.  Not oh, let me drive 11 hours great, mind you.    I do miss the T-Tones concerts.  Sirens too, of course, I just didn't see them as frequently despite the fact that I actually knew some of the Sirens and didn't know any of the T-Tones.  Hm, I should see if someone wants to drive down for the annual Mother's Day concert next year.  And I'm sure the T-Tones if not the Sirens will be performing in Seattle sometime in the next year, they usually do.    I'm beginning to think this needs to be called the "Blog o' Reminiscing" which isn't what I'd intended it to be.

      So much for adding links and writing posts.  Ah well.  In other news, I'm sick.  Nothing serious, sore throat, cough . . . lots of fun.  Also, we lost our phone service at the office as of 12:30.  The internet connection was fine for some reason, but I wouldn't be surprised if we're without phones at work until Friday.  So it is quite likely I won't be able to make any posts at work and will quickly go insane from my inability to post, web surf or chat.  Fun for me.

      Jon's back!  Yay!  Don't get me wrong, I love Stephen Colbert, and he's definitely my second favorite person on  The Daily Show , but there's a reason it's  The Daily Show with Jon Stewart  and not  The Daily Show with Stephen Colbert .  Jon had a son, I believe.  He was back at work so quickly that I'm sure the baby was in great health but he didn't give any details.  He did thank the doctors at the hospital by name, which I thought was pretty cool.  Great to have him back.  Though I admit, I did get a kick out of last night's intro: Welcome to The Daily Show with Jon Stewart, ironically, I'm Stephen Colbert.

      Okay, that took way too long.  Note to self, next time  start  by checking the source on Myr's blog when you want to see how she's done something.  Would have saved ever so much time.

      So about an hour and a half of fiddling with my stupid template later. . . I think I can finally copy Myr's use of  color and bold  for media titles.  Why are my tech support people never around when I need them? (yeah, okay, because 2 of the 3 are in time zones that are 2-3 hours ahead of me and it's 12:36 here and Anna's either not on-line or is intelligently sleeping, unlike me.  It was a rhetorical question, okay? Sheesh.)  I said earlier to . . . someone, that the simplicity of the new templates is good for some things (like if you actually know what you're doing) but not so good if you don't and you're trying to follow the help instructions only they're written for the older, more bulky templates.  I'm just sayin'.

      I talked to Georgia yesterday.  Poor girl had her wallet stolen.  The loss of her credit cards and driver's license didn't bother her that much.  The cards were canceled (though whoever stole her wallet had already made three purchases) and fortunately, she had her passport with her in California so she has photo ID when she's traveling.  Unfortunately, she had a lot of irreplaceable personal things in her wallet, including a ticket stub from one of the longest games in Mariners' history signed by Lou Piniella.   Now that he's in Tampa the possibility of getting something personally signed by him is pretty remote.  She also had some other ticket stubs from memorable games.  Sadly, her wallet also contained a frequent customer card from The Perk in Walla Walla with quotes from what I'm pretty sure was the last SCA event we ever went to.  We'd stayed up late the night before to finish sewing until Georgia's sewing machine burned out (oops).  We were going to convoy with the rest of the Whitman/Fluetfalle delegation, but our car, Georgia, myself and Brandon, decided to stop at the Safeway first because we were all extremely hungry.  Thus began the only time Georgia ever had serious problems with her navigational duties.  In her defense, the directions we had weren't for worth the paper they were written on.    The event was in Idaho, so we set out about 5ish I think.  We were going to start from Coeur D'Alene so we drove through there, kept going North until we saw a sign that we were nearing the Canadian Border, prompting a  Canada?!?  reaction from our band of stalwart travelers. It was almost as good as the  Welcome to  Oregon !  exclamation from Georgia and I, but that's another story.    So then we headed South becoming very sleepy.  Worrying that the two other cars in our group were going to worry about is since we were already massively late.  At which point we were pulled over by a cop for having a headlight out.  Brandon (whose car it was and who was driving) had a nice chat with Mr. Policeman and we asked if he happened to know where Kitteridge was.  He gave us a look and said it was three hours south and we weren't trying to go there tonight, were we (it was now Midnight).  Um...maybe.     So then we keep going South, now playing The Lion King soundtrack over and over and all three of us singing along.  Why, I don't remember since I'm pretty sure I'd brought other CDs.  We sang, we talked about how we'd laugh about all this . . . some day, and worried about the rest of our group who must surely be extremely concerned by now.  And so we continued on until we finally came across an SCA sign on some backwater dirt road.  And we drove some more.  And realized the car coming towards us was driven by another member of our party, Demian.  Only by that time we were all in a stupor and didn't think to flash our lights or anything until it was too late.  This was followed by some debate as to whether we should turn around and go after him, because surely if he was driving around at 3 a.m. it was to look for us.  But eventually we decided he'd go back to the camp site and we were all very tired and screw it.  So we drove some more, more backwater roads, more dirt.  Finally we got to the campsite, checked in, asked where Fluetfalle/Whitman might be.  They'd never heard of them, but they would have checked in hours and hours ago and those records were elsewhere.  Whatever.  So tired.  Must pitch tent.  Must sleep.  We walked around the campsite for a bit calling "Whitman?"  "Fluetfalle" very softly.  No answers.  Screw it.  Pitched a tent and went to sleep.   Next morning . . . still no Fluetfalle, no Demian.  We finally find a payphone and find that the rest of them hadn't been able to find the campsite at all.  Demian had been on the right road and if he'd just kept going he would have found it but it was so poorly marked and it seemed like  such  a backwater road he'd given up.  So everyone else was back at Whitman.  Demian's party managed to return in the middle of a freak sandstorm and the car either broke down or ran out of gas so they had to hike it back to the college.    We stuck around for a little while and watched some of the fighting which is where the quotes on the card in Georgia's wallet came from.  The only one I remember now is "Children are not a legal offhand weapon!"  Thus ended the last event Georgia and I attended (I think. There may have been another Baron's in there somewhere) and Brandon's first event.    The point is that it's too bad her wallet was stolen because she did have some monetarily worthless but personally valuable things inside.  It would be nice if whoever stole it would just  mail back the contents sans the credit cards, but I'm not holding my breath, and neither is she.  On a more positive note, she was able to get Clinton's memoir signed by the man himself when he was in California.  She was in line for 20 hours and loved every minute of it.  That's one of the reasons I miss having her around. I'd've gone with her, but it's not the kind of thing I'd do on my own.

      So I was going to spend a bunch of time finally getting my sidebar all fixed up with the rest of my links and write those posts both on here and  urlLink Fresh Hell  that have been rolling around in my head and I am  so  behind on my  urlLink Fresh Hell  posts it's freakin' ridiculous.  But then I started playing  urlLink Defender of the Crown  on the theory that I'd just finish the spot I was stuck on last night.  Only it was the stupid green dragon of death that wouldn't fucking die!  So about oh 4 hours later . . . yeah.  So, maybe tomorrow.  For now, I want to go finish one of the many, many library books due on Thursday.

      So what does everyone think of this one?  I discovered that the "archives" header in the Scribe template was actually an image, so as long as I only wanted headers that said "archives" and "recent posts" I was fine, but anything else . . .

      Well, let's try this again, I suppose.  This was the first time in a number of years that the 4th of July festivities were not held at my parents' house.  I can't remember if Zach was even born yet.  I think he was, actually, but he was very, very young.  Must've been a year or so since his birthday is Bastille day.  So it would have been 6 or so years ago.  That year we took the bus down to Gas Works Park in Seattle.   It was a brilliant fireworks display.  The shells were huge and perfectly synchronized to music.  Even more impressive, they were able to make shapes in the sky.      It was a fun way to spend the day, kite flying, picnicking, but I prefer the intimacy of home displays.   Not to mention that it doesn't take an hour and a half to get home afterward.  Of course, it gets harder and harder to do home fireworks displays since they're becoming illegal in most places.  Not that it stops people from doing it, of course.  This year we had the fireworks display at Chris and Jen's new place.  I decided I prefer doing it here.  My parents' house is located on a short street with only one other house.  It's the middle part of an "H" shaped area.  So we have lots of open space and the other houses that set of fireworks are facing to the right of us.  The view of their fireworks is partially obscured by houses and large trees.   Chris and Jen live on a cul-de-sac and it was easy to get distracted by what everyone else was doing and hard to see our own stuff because of the cars and other stuff in the driveway.  The fireworks were also a lot tamer than they've been in previous years.   Still, a good time was had by all.  Katie was old enough to appreciate what was going on.  Old enough to say "pretty" and then go back to doing her dancing. :)  I loved the 4th when I was growing up because Chris and I would go and pick out fireworks together, just the two of us.  We'd usually get the jumbo box and several individual fireworks.  My favorite was always the pagoda, I liked watching it spin and loved how it looked when the red windows glowed.  I'd keep it for a month or two, though I'm not really sure why.  It smelled like smoke and usually at least part of it was singed.   It was special because it was something Chris and I did together.  My parents would watch the display, but they wouldn't pick them out with us and they were excited about it like kids are.  Now it's more about Chris and his kids, which is natural, but I still miss the special time.

       urlLink More  on the firing of&nbsp; George Eads  and  Jorja Fox .     Sources said that Eads showed up for work late Thursday morning, when the show had an early 6:15 a.m. call time, and was sent a termination letter soon afterward.   Fox was understood to have been sent a similar termination letter Wednesday. Sources said CBS recently asked all of the actors on "CSI" to send in a formal letter assuring the network that they would report to work as scheduled for the start of production on the show's fifth season.   Sources said CBS terminated Fox after failing to receive her letter. It is not clear whether the actress had sent the letter, but one source indicated that she had.   Eads did comply with the network's request to submit his letter, sources said.   Eads and Fox, both of whom have been with the drama since its debut in fall 2000, had approached the network about a salary increase for the coming season, sources said. CBS is said to have responded with what industry sources described as a modest take-it-or-leave-it offer of an increase.  &nbsp;  . . .  &nbsp;  Sources said Eads and Fox had two more seasons to go on their existing contracts. There were conflicting reports about whether series stars Marg Helgenberger ( urlLink news ) and William Petersen were at work Thursday, but one source said that the only cast member on the set that day was Gary Dourdan. Reports of strife on the "CSI" set came on the same day that the show earned an Emmy nomination for best drama series.

       CBS has  urlLink fired     George Eads  (Nick) and  Jorja Fox  (Sara) from   CSI  .&nbsp;  Marg Helgenburger  also failed to show claiming that she was sick, but she is expected to return.  &nbsp;  I have a feeling this is really going to bite CBS in the ass.&nbsp; I'm not a fan of the Gil/Sara storyline, but I know many, many fans are.&nbsp;&nbsp; Many of   CSI  's female fans really like Nick despite his limited screen time, so I think his absence will really hurt.  &nbsp;  It will help   CSI   that (aside from Sara/Gil and lately, Catherine) the show doesn't focus much on the personal lives of the main characters.&nbsp; That's one reason that  Law &amp; Order  is able to get away with its constantly changing cast is because we know almost nothing about the personal lives of the characters (still,  Jerry Orbach  will be missed).  &nbsp;  But I still think this is a big mistake.&nbsp;  William Peterson  and&nbsp; Marg Helgenburger  can't carry the show on their own, and while I love Warrick's character,  Gary Dourdan &nbsp;hasn't had much screen time either.&nbsp;&nbsp; As for  Eric Szmada , yes, Greg is supposed to be moving into the field now, but he still seems like he belongs in the lab.&nbsp; I like the dynamic when he's in the lab, and I feel like Greg is able to make a real contribution there.&nbsp; As opposed to in the field where it's going to be a lot of Greg doing basic training stuff which just isn't that interesting to watch and if he's in the field I think he'd definitely have to really tone down his personality.  &nbsp;  It'll be easy enough to explain Sara's absence, she was, after all, pulled over for a DUI at the end of last season.&nbsp; I'm sure they'll have Nick decide that he was bothered by not having the funding for his promotion.&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm fairly confident they won't do a  Sorkin  and just act as though Nick and Sara never existed (Mandy who?).  &nbsp;  And what does "similar roles" mean?&nbsp; They can't seriously be&nbsp;considering plugging in different actors to the same character roles.&nbsp; I'm very&nbsp;unhappy with this decision.  &nbsp;  I have a feeling they may be counting on  CSI: Miami  and  CSI: New York &nbsp;to carry the franchise if   CSI   loses ratings. That might work, but  CSI: Miami  has never done as well as   CSI  .&nbsp; I would argue that's because  CSI: Miami  is crap.&nbsp; We'll have to see how well  CSI: New York  does.&nbsp;&nbsp; CBS may have been able to get away with it if they only fired one actor, but I think they'll see some serious repercussions from firing two at once, particularly if people get as tired of the  CSI  franchise as they are of  Law &amp; Order .   &nbsp;

      I'm home sick, again.  I think Friday will make week three of this thing and I'm so ready to be done.    At the moment I'm actually waiting for the electricians to return.  The lights in my room, my mom's office, and the chandelier above the front door started flickering like mad last night.  Fortunately I left work after about an hour today and as luck would have it an electrician could be dispatched provided someone was around to let him in.  So I got a bit of sleep and now I'm waiting for the guy and his son to come back with a new circuit breaker.  Then it's definitely back to bed for me.  So we should have electricity restored to that circuit today instead of Monday (yay!).  Sick or not, I don't like to be without my own computer.   I found  urlLink this  in  urlLink The Seattle Times .  It's something I'd absolutely love to do, but I don't fit the criteria they want.  I would make it a soap box and I don't know that much about my neighborhood's political views save that the majority of them are Conservative.   With so few undecided I'm not sure how you keep a blog about the election from being partisan, but oh well.  It does make me wish I knew more about my neighborhood so I could apply, but my neighborhood doesn't do much as a group and right now I'm sick and don't think people would appreciate it if I were to go door to door.  Ah well,  I'll always have  urlLink Fresh Hell .

      I just finished reading  How to Lose Friends and Alienate People  by Toby Young.  Don't. Or at least, don't read the last quarter if you're a woman.    Toby Young does have some funny lines.  But the anti-America crap gets old.  Yeah, our entertainment reporters aren't the same as they were in the 20's or 40's.  Get over it.  Ironically he thinks our non-entertainment news reporters are very objective and balanced.   Um...yeah.    Anyway.  I was still enjoying it until the last quarter, though I've never understood people who are obsessed with celebrities.  Sure, I read parts of Parade in the Sunday paper, but I don't subscribe to People or similar magazines and don't really have any desire to do so.  Most of the time I'm more interested in news about a particular show or movie than a particular actor or actress, but I recognize that's not true of all people and I'm okay with that.  Here's the thing.  Simply put, Toby Young is a dick.  We keep hearing about a "friend" of his, Alex who becomes more and more successful throughout the book.  I say "friend" because every time Toby's reaction is "that fucker!   I  should be that successful!"  It never even occurs to him (or if it does, it was never in the book or it was edited out) that maybe, just maybe, Alex has more talent than he does.  I'm not about to deny that networking is an extremely important skill and it will really help you get ahead.  And yes, you're dead without it.  But you don't make large script deals if you can't write worth shit, regardless of who you know.  But the part of the book that really turned me off is the last quarter where he really deals with his attempts to date women.  Apparently, all women in New York are only looking for the other half of a power couple.  And I'm sure quite a few are, particularly in the industry that he was in (writing for Vanity Fair).  He complains that women are only interested in the size of his paycheck and who he knows and how they can use him to get ahead.  A few times he bemoans the fact that he's 30, balding, not that attractive and no one's interested in his personality.    At the same time, he says over and over again that all he really wants is a quick, meaningless fuck and big tits.  At one point he even says that he wants to fuck a supermodel not for the experience of fucking a supermodel, but because he wants to be able to brag to his friends that he fucked a supermodel.   You know why people try to get away from you Mr. Young? You're a total ass.  You continually laugh at your own jokes which just aren't funny.  You act like the worst stereotypes of frat boys and you're in your mid thirties.  Grow the fuck up.  You spend all your time feeling sorry for yourself, and you literally treat women like objects to be used entirely for your pleasure.   If you're going to complain that women won't give you a chance because they're not interested in your personality, maybe you should be interested in something other than her bra size and whether you will get laid that night.   By the end of the book, he is married, yes, to a woman with large tits.  God knows what she sees in him.  His reaction to her suggestion that he move in with her as a three month trial period is that he's older and really, she should be giving up her job (which requires her to be in London) because frankly, giving up his job is just not macho despite the fact that he could do it anywhere.  Eventually he decides to move back to England.    Though before he leaves he talks about how Americans no longer believe in romantic love and how that's so sad for us . . . Apparently forgetting that about 20 pages earlier he'd told his then girlfriend (the woman who becomes his life) that he doesn't believe in romantic love it's all crap etc.  Suffice it to say I'm glad he's no longer in the US and by the end I really hated him.  And while I'm on the subject of dating, both Young and most men who have  urlLink complained in print  about the difficulty of finding someone to date seem to have an immediate aversion to a woman who asks what he does for a living.  (That wasn't so much the issue in this section of the Times, but it has come up in previous parts of the series).  Men seem to hear "how much money do you make?" which annoys me.  If I ask someone, male or female, what s/he does for a living what I mean is "you spend about 1/3 of your day sleep and about 1/3 at work, how do you spend the 1/3 of your day at work?  While I certainly don't think jobs are the complete definition of a person, they are certainly part of that definition.   I'm only two years out of college, I don't make very much money, and I assume anyone I'd date is probably in that category too, which is totally fine.  It just irks me that women can't ask that question without being perceived as "gold diggers."  Like the men who apparently think if a woman asks what time it is it's because she wants to know what kind of watch he wears.  Who cares?  Maybe there's a movie you're supposed to get to and she doesn't have a watch of her own.    Anyway, there's my mini-rant.  I feel better now.  And don't read that book.

      It's getting more and more difficult to listen to  urlLink KIRO  these days.  Conservatives make up the majority of callers even to the few moderate or left wing hosts.  Many callers seem ill informed at best and most don't want to have a discussion.    There was the caller last week who claimed that Edwards was responsible for driving half the obstetricians in North Carolina out of business and when Dave asked where he was getting it (since it wasn't in the huge memo the Bush campaign had just released on Edwards) he just kept repeating it over and over.  Or the guy today who apparently really believes that the entire reason we went into Iraq was because Iraq was "in violation of UN resolutions."  Jeffords, the host, went on about how that wasn't actually true, they didn't have any WMD . . . but my argument would have been this.  Even if it were true, Israel and Turkey we  know  are in violation of UN resolutions, are we going after them next?  And if we care so much about the UN why is it that we haven't paid our dues in years?  It's really too bad, because there are hosts that I really enjoy.  Mostly Dave Ross, who will, of course, be leaving at the end of the month to run his campaign.  It's frustrating too.  The Conservatives already have KVI and whatever station it is that is now playing Rush.  Can't we have just one station?

      I saw  The Bourne Supremacy  with Cassie. It was great to see her again, I wish we'd had more time to talk. I feel like there's a lot to catch up on.    Warning: spoilers for the movie .   I have some major issues with this movie.&nbsp; First of all, it doesn't occur to  anyone  that Bourne is way the hell too professional to leave a fingerprint?&nbsp; And not even a partial but a very clear, non-smudged fingerprint?&nbsp; Please.   And then one guy  one guy  figures out that the charge that didn't explode was placed in such a way that there was no point at all in placing a charge there?&nbsp; And that's the one with the fingerprint?&nbsp; And no one thinks that's a  tad  suspicious?   These people are too fucking stupid to be spies.&nbsp;&nbsp; Seriously.&nbsp; Especially after the whole "these people don't make mistakes" conversation.&nbsp; Grr.&nbsp;   The problem with watching so much   CSI   is that it really bothered me that the angle of the shot into the Russian wife was all wrong for a murder/suicide story.&nbsp; C'mon guys, elementary ballistics here.  And Bourne not killing the guy in the end?&nbsp; I know he's all, my girlfriend wouldn't want me to kill and everything, but c'mon.&nbsp; You  know  the guy's going to be after you.&nbsp;   Speaking of the girlfriend, it doesn't have to be like this?&nbsp; WTF?&nbsp; Yeah, sure, give up, turn yourself in and either go back to becoming a hardened killer or get killed.&nbsp; Wow, thanks bitch.&nbsp; She's killed right after that comment though, so I view it as poetic justice.   I felt like nothing much happened and there was a lot that wasn't explained.&nbsp; Classic middle of the trilogy movie.&nbsp;   Despite all of that, I did like the movie.&nbsp; There were some great action sequences, and  Moby's  "Extreme Ways" was used again for the credits, which I liked.&nbsp;&nbsp;   I don't know.&nbsp; Normally I really dig character development, but I guess I felt like this movie really lacked the urgency of the first one. Maybe because the CIA wasn't really trying to kill him.&nbsp; I know if they'd caught him they wouldn't have let him go, but still.&nbsp;   And the other assassin just . . .&nbsp; it was just a job, it seemed more personal in the first movie.   And for someone whose job it was to monitor and presumably do something about the mental health of the Touchstone members, Stiles seemed woefully unprepared to deal with Bourne.&nbsp;&nbsp; You'd think she'd have had some training in how to deal with people in that situation.   I did like the movie, I guess I'm just disappointed because I liked the first movie so much I was hoping the second would be equally as good.   You know what it was?&nbsp; Bourne had something to lose in the first movie but in this movie he really didn't.&nbsp; His life, of course, but in the first movie there was more at stake than just his life.&nbsp;

      I had a pretty busy weekend.   On Friday I hung out with Christina and newly Ikeafied apartment. She has some really nice furniture, and I love the new look.  I still wonder how I'm going to fit all my crap into an apartment when I move out, but I still have some time to figure it out.   We went to the California Pizza Kitchen for dinner. I highly recommend it.  You wouldn't think pizza that's a bit sweet would be good, but it really is.    On Saturday I saw Georgia for the first time in what, a year?  The police located some girls who had the contents of her wallet, so she'll get all her mementos back, eventually.  At the moment they're evidence.  But it's nice to know she'll get her M's ticket stubs and The Perk card with the quotes on the back returned to her.  Unfortunately they didn't have her actual wallet, but I think the contents were far more important to her.  We had lunch/dinner at Azteca, then hung out at Redmond Towncenter for a while.  Naturally, we spent lots of time (and money) in Borders, had some coffee . . . really, the only thing missing was a trip to Best Buy complete with a brief period of not knowing where we were (we aren't lost, we just don't know where we are).    Then we saw  Fahrenheit 9/11 .  It wasn't as bad as I thought it would be in terms of spin.  Don't get me wrong, it was anything but objective, but it never pretended to be anything else.  All and all I thought it was okay.  I didn't learn anything new.    I thought the section with Bush reading  My Pet Goat  to the students could have been stronger.  Instead of asking if he was thinking about all his business ties, I would have wondered if he was thinking what most Americans were thinking, how bad is it, do we know who is responsible, is anyone claiming responsibility, is it over, what should our response be . . .and then ask why he is not immediately asking those questions.  But I doubt he was thinking about business ties.   Similarly, while the Saudi flight is troubling, I think it's worth remembering that (as far as I recall, anyway) we didn't know on September 13th that 15 of the 19 hijackers were from Saudi Arabia.    I thought the film was most effective when  Michael Moore  was silent.  Most of his narration seemed unnecessary, and the film immediately became less effective for me when Moore got in front of the camera because then it was about  Michael Moore  and not whatever they were shooting at that particular time.   The part of the movie that annoyed me the most was when Moore confronted politicians to get them to register their sons and daughters for the service because the whole thing was just stupid.  A) parents don't sign kids up for the military, that's something the kid must do for him or herself and B) if you're the kid, thank you very fucking much for sending me to a War Zone Mr. Moore.  Why not ask if they personally are willing to fight? And using the whole of Congress as the number with only one member with a child fighting is disingenuous.  While I'm sure that many, maybe even the majority of Congressmen and women have sons and/or daughters who are eligible to fight, I'm sure some of them either don't have children or have children who are underage.  So using the number of every member in Congress doesn't mean anything.  I'm sure that they could have spared someone to find out how many Congressmen and women have eligible children.    I do think that's a grossly unfair burden to put on the children of Congresspeople. They have no control over who their parents are.  It's one thing if he or she joins because s/he really believes in what we're doing, but it's something else if s/he is pressured into it just to make mom or dad look good. That's a completely unfair thing to ask of another person.  I was amused that Jim McDermott's office looks about as organized as most of my Whitman Profs.'  I'm not surprised at the behavior of the soldiers.  We train them so that they can kill, is it any wonder they get revved up when doing so?  To soundtracks, no less.  I'm sure the music helps lessen the fear, too.  I felt for the family whose house they went to in the middle of the night. I really wish we had enough translators to send one with every foray like that one, but since our intelligence services can't seem to find enough people who speak Arabic, I don't see that happening any time soon.  I thought the footage of the American mother who lost her son was particularly powerful.  But I also realized that the footage of the American mother who lost her son was more powerful to me than the mother at the very beginning of the film who lost children to American bombs, and it bothers me that I feel that way.  I don't know if it was the language barrier (subtitles just aren't as effective as understanding the words when they're spoken) or that Moore spent so much time with the American mother so we got to know her a little bit, and we got to know her son through his letters.  I know it's easier to identify with people who are more like you, but still, my reaction bothers me.  On a lighter note, it was great to see Georgia.  She looks fantastic.   She'll be coming back to the Seattle area in October, so that's exciting.  And then she'll do what the rest of us are doing - - trying to figure out our lives.  On Sunday we took my nephew to his birthday movie.  We saw  Spider-man 2 .  I liked it better than the first one, which is good, because the only time I saw the first one I couldn't stop thinking about how  terrible  the dialog was.  This one was much better, though I think Zach was restless because it wasn't action all the time.  But I appreciated the character development.  It was a fun, entertaining movie, I don't think it's the best movie of the year or the best comic book based movie ever (I still like  X-Men )but I enjoyed it.  And it was ever so much better than the movie he chose last year,  The Wild Thornberrys .   And that was my weekend.  It only took me until Friday to get the post written.

      This morning I went to the dentist.  It was not the most fun I ever had.  Turns out I get to have a root canal.  Feel free to give me lots of sympathy.  My dentist was very nice and it didn't hurt that much.  The Novacaine didn't wear off until 3 o'clock though, and the appointment was at 9:30.  I'll have the rest of it done Tuesday.    Anyway, my dentist is a great lady, though the office isn't quite  urlLink this  nice.    My lower jaw is a little sore now and I'm overly concerned about ripping out temporary filling.  But other than that I'm pretty much okay.  I may turn in early tonight though.

      Update on  George Eads  and  Jorja Fox :    BACK ON THE JOB: Exclusive sources telling  urlLink E! News Live  that  Jorja Fox  will report back to work at CSI and it was just a misunderstanding with CBS.   . . .  "They think it's about money and it's not,"  Eads   urlLink said . "I overslept. ... I woke up white as a sheet 3 1/2 hours after I was supposed to be on the set."   He called in, said he was on his way and was told, "Don't bother," Eads said. The Texas native compared himself to a football star who makes a similar error.   "It's like I'm the quarterback with the Dallas Cowboys and I overslept the first day of practice," he said. "I'd expect the coach to have me run hills and run wind sprints until the sun goes down, not you know, completely fire me."   Asked if CBS had sought an apology from him, he replied: "Let me tell you, I've apologized nine ways to Sunday. It's a big misunderstanding, straight up."   "I want all this to work out. 'CSI' is a part of who I am," Eads said.   Eads said he wants to speak with Moonves to resolve the issue but had yet to reach him. He compared getting hold of Moonves, a top executive with CBS parent company Viacom, to reaching the mysterious Charlie in "Charlie's Angels."   "If after I've spoken to him from my heart he knows exactly what the situation is, he's the boss. It's still up to him."    Calling himself the quarterback may be a bit much, but it's interesting that  Eads  has said from the beginning that it was a mistake and all the stories have said that he was late but not that he failed to show. We've heard absolutely nothing from  Jorja Fox , but she's coming back.  I'm not surprised that she's coming back, but I do find the contrast in treatment extremely irritating.  Especially since I like Nick's character and Sara has gotten on my nerves from the beginning.  Grr.

      According to  Carl Jefford's  ( Dave Ross'  fill-in on KIRO)&nbsp; there's a study that Liberals tend to not watch police procedurals such as   CSI   and  Law & Order .&nbsp;     There's probably some amount of truth to that, (though I have a feeling most of the people on the slash lists are not Conservative).&nbsp; On the other hand, I'm not sure what that leaves for Liberals to watch since it seems that shows fall into three categories these days:       Reality TV   Shows in or about Las Vegas   Police Procedurals    I'm not sure what that leaves us.&nbsp; But I'd be surprised if Liberals didn't appreciate the science of   CSI  .

       urlLink  Stewart  v.  Koppel   pulled from Sufergirl's Blog on  urlLink Slate .    But after the commercial break, something unforeseeable happened on  Nightline: an anchorman showdown! What began as a casual media-on-the-media puff piece turned into a fascinating 5-minute referendum on old and new ways of looking at the meaning and purpose of television news. In a one-on-one chat on the deserted convention floor after the day's festivities had ended, Koppel, in his low-key, dignified, What-Me-Worry way, got medieval on Stewart's ass.  From the start, Koppel made no secret of his distaste for Stewart's show: "A lot of television viewers -- more, quite frankly, than I am comfortable with -- get their news from […] The Daily Show." His first challenge to Stewart: "You say that [the Democratic Convention] is like a product launch." "Not like a product launch – it is a product launch," Stewart replied, and proceeded to outline his take on Kerry's nomination as the result of a year-long process of corporate branding: "John Kerry: now with lemon!" A pretty standard line of argument for those of Stewart's generation, reconciled as we are to our postmodern condition as the constant targets of marketing and spin, but to Koppel, it must have sounded like the sheerest nihilism. As the interview proceeded, it became clear what a gulf lay between Stewart's and Koppel's views of the world, and it was heartbreaking to watch, like eavesdropping on your cool brother and your nice uncle as they pursue some hopeless ideological argument over Thanksgiving dinner.  "Unexpected things used to happen in the world. They don't happen anymore," continued Stewart matter-of-factly. Parried an impatient Koppel, "Oh, sure they do." Stewart was careful to separate The Daily Show's mandate from that of "real" television journalism: "I know my role. I am the dancing monkey." But that dodge didn't satisfy his broadcast-news interlocuter: "The reality of it is – and this is no joke – there are a lot of people out there who do turn to you." "Not for news," Stewart countered, and they were off again.  What was at stake in this debate between two men, a generation apart in age (Stewart is 42, Koppel 64), both of whom host some version of a late-night daily talk show on current events? Clearly, Koppel's beef went far beyond the question of whether most folks who watch The Daily Show do so for yuks. (As a long-term viewer, I would contend that of course they do, and that anyone who can't tell the difference between Stewart's out-there satire and actual investigative reporting is too dumb to understand the "real" news anyway.) No, the battle of the network anchors was about nothing less than the future of TV journalism.  Koppel, a venerable holdout from the era of the three-network system, stands up for the beleaguered notion of an objective truth that journalists can wrest from politicians, protect from satirists, and bring to the American public. Stewart, on the other hand, finds it "dispiriting" that broadcast news has become complicit with the pre-spun narratives coming from both left and right: "It's Coke and Pepsi talking about beverage truth." And yet Koppel is far from naïve – he quickly concedes that the convention-as-product-launch concept is "one I'd like to steal sometime" – and Stewart is no jaded Gen-X cynic. At one point, he even encourages Koppel to use the bully pulpit of Nightline to speak truth to power: "You can say, 'That's B.S.' You don't need humor, because you have what I wish I had, which is credibility and gravitas."  Wednesday night's discussion came to an abrupt end when Stewart, who was clearly ready to go on talking, was told by a polite but brusque Koppel, "You're finished." To my mind, Stewart (who, crushed-out fans like myself will be keen to hear, was looking foxy-fine in a casual black sweater and jeans) won the day. But I was looking forward to Round Two on Thursday, when Koppel was scheduled to be Stewart's guest on The Daily Show. Koppel never showed, and his absence went unmentioned. Last-minute scheduling snafu, or anchorman blood feud? A call to the Daily Show office to find out went unanswered, so I'll have to leave you to speculate on that one. What do you think I am, a news reporter?    Where to start? First of all, I doubt that most of  The Daily Show's  audience gets  all  their news from  The Daily Show.  In fact, I think in this day in age it would be damn near impossible for anyone to get  all  his or her news from one source. My guess is that the people who do use it as their main source of information wouldn't seek out an alternate source if there was no  Daily Show  so at least they have some idea of what's going on in the world.  As for me, I find  The Daily Show  to be intelligent and practically a guaranteed laugh. And yes, sometimes, I learn stuff. In fact, I think one of the biggest strengths of the show is that it picks up on interesting and noteworthy stories that the mainstream media doesn't cover. Stories that otherwise would fall through the cracks and I don't mean just the  Back in Black  segments.  And  Jon  has a point.  Koppel  et all  could  use their power to do more than parrot back they're told to say by those in power. They choose not to. These days "objective" seems to mean repeating the talking points without really analyzing let alone daring to question anything. The mainstream media has been practicing rigid self-censorship for at least the last 3 years.  Why do I watch  The Daily Show ? Because they can smell BS a mile a way and they'll call people on it.

      I had to return  urlLink Suspect Identities: A History of Fingerprinting and Criminal Identification  to the library. So if I want to finish it I'll have to put it on hold again.  I'm always amazed by how much more slowly I read non-fiction. It seems like it takes three or four times as long. I think it's because you can scan most fiction in a way that you can't scan nonfiction which tends to have more theme specific words, often technical.  For example, I was reading  urlLink Callahan's Con  last night and one of the characters speaks with a slightly skewed word order. Not quite Yoda, but noticeable if you're paying attention. I didn't notice it until another character mentioned it and then I had to really pay attention to everything the out of order character said. I'd just been mentally rearranging the sentence to make sense. It's like that e-mail that goes around that says if the first few letters in a word are right you won't even notice if it's misspelled. I think I have that e-mail at home, maybe I'll post it later.

      I had my most not-fun visit to the dentist so far. Apparently there's a nerve in your cheek that if you were to say, put a needle full of Novicaine into it, makes it feel as though someone has taken a knife and stabbed out your eye. Hurt like hell. I couldn't stop shaking for a while. My dentist was very apologetic about it, apparently it's a nerve that is sometimes higher and sometimes lower and mine was very low. She thought it was the scare more than anything that upset me and while it did scare me at first (I was wondering if the Novicaine had somehow sprayed into my eye) it also  hurt like hell .

      I'm not sure I'd call a story about a defenseless hamster nearly drowning "silly" but that's me.   There are apparently two schools of thought about what  Kerry  needed to accomplish in his acceptance speech. One school says that he had to define himself by showing where he stood on the issues. The other school of thought was that he had to make people like him.   I didn't dislike him more after his speech, so I guess he succeeded as far as the second school of thought is concerned. To be fair, I thought he did better this time than he has on other occasions when I've heard him speak. I actually wasn't more depressed listening to him. Don't get me wrong, I wasn't inspired. But I didn't want to kill myself, either. So that's an improvement, of sorts.   But my overall reaction was "sound and fury, signifying nothing." He talked for about an hour and said exactly nothing. He talked about Iraq a lot, but didn't really say anything. He has a plan to get 44,000 more troops and end the "back door draft of the reserves." That sounds nice and all, but the military is having trouble meeting their recruitment goals as it is, so where is he going to get the 44,000? I may have missed it, but I don't think he said anything about increasing military pay, either.   He was going to fix healthcare but didn't really say how. Well, actually, for a moment it sounded like he was talking about Universal Healthcare.   But the focus was really on Vietnam and Iraq and he touched very briefly on healthcare. But there were almost no specifics. Nothing about civil rights or civil liberties or gay rights or why foreign leaders would be more inclined to trust him except that he isn't  Bush .   He made some very vague promises with no clear plan for how to fund them aside from repealing the tax cuts for those who make over $200,000, but there were almost no specifics. At one point he mentioned that you could go to his  urlLink website  for more specifics, except that his website is equally vague as nearly as I can tell.   It's one thing to make vague promises in a 30 second spot, but to have an hour on national TV and still not have any kind of plan or vision? That scares me.   It's as if even  Kerry  feels that his only selling point is that he's not  Bush . Or that he doesn't have to have a plan because his entire plan is that he's not  Bush .    Kerry  said that he would never send troops to war without having a plan to win the peace. Not being  Bush  may be enough to win the election, but I need a plan for what happens after his inauguration.   Finally, the whole "this part of my speech is for  Bush , let's be civil and about issues" thing annoyed the hell out of me. They've done little besides bash  Bush  for the last four days and  now  they think they should be civil? I strongly dislike hypocrisy whether it's from Democrats or Republicans. Just be honest about it. If you're going to bash  Bush , bash  Bush , more power to you. But turnabout is fair play and you can't bash someone and then say that everything should be civil.   And if it was about issues and ideas . . . wouldn't he have to get some?   Current Mood: Dispirited.

      The always insightful  Dahlia Lithwick   urlLink asks  why no one's talking about the likelihood that the next president will make up to four SCOTUS appointments.   Lithwick , by the way, is definitely one of the people I'd have at a dinner party.  You know the question, "if you could have any five people at a dinner party"   Jon Stewart  would be on the list.   Bernard Lewis .  I'm not sure who else.   George Stephanopolous  or  Bill Clinton , maybe.  Assuming we're talking currently alive, and I'm going to assume that we are because all of history is just far too much ground to cover.  Maybe  Martin Sheen .  But I digress.  I have to admit, I hadn't been thinking in those terms, either.  And that's scary, because I work in the legal field so I should be thinking in those terms. I know it was a big issue in the last election, or at least, it was an issue most people were aware existed.    I think now there's just too much other stuff.  Iraq, Afghanistan, Al Qaida.  Mostly Iraq.  Our standing in the world is so different from where it was in 2000.  An incredible amount of damage has been done to this country over the last 4 years and trying to focus on anything besides terrorism and the war in Iraq is too overwhelming.  I can't think of anything that's better now than it was four years ago.   SCOTUS is important but it seems like there's been such a push toward making them less relevant if not completely irrelevant.  Do the secret courts have more power than SCOTUS?  I don't know.    The federal judiciary became so packed with Conservative judges that I really fear for the future.    So much power has become concentrated in the Executive branch.  I think it's difficult for the Legislative and Judicial branches to actually check the Executive branch.  Yes, the Democrats have blocked a lot of judicial appointments, but the benches are still packed with Conservatives.  The Legislative branch which is currently controlled by the same party as the Executive branch has little interest in stopping the Executive branch from expanding its power.  And the Democrats continually speak up only after they allow it to happen and it can't be reversed.   At this point, working to rebalance the power may be more important than who's sitting on the bench.  Current Mood: Drained

      Unfortunately, I wasn't able to see all of  John Edwards'  speech.&nbsp; The part about the Right's negative campaigning, while expected, was also highly annoying.&nbsp; If you want to be about positive campaigning, then be about positive campaigning.&nbsp; But the Left is just as negative in some of their ads, it's just that the Right does it better.&nbsp; But the truth is, negative campaigning works if done correctly.&nbsp; That's why people do it.&nbsp; It seemed especially hypocritical coming on top of speech after speech about how  Bush  has screwed up.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I, of course, agree that  Bush  has hurt this country more than any other president, but I'm also not claiming that the Republicans use negative campaigning while pretending that the Democrats would never consider such a vile thing.   Most of the speech that I saw was so/so, although I did like his energy when he was talking about being inspired.&nbsp; Still no  Clinton , but a pretty good speaker.&nbsp;   I'm so tired of hearing about  Kerry's  service in Vietnam.&nbsp; He's a war hero, I get it already.   When I'm Czar for a day, these will be the rules for the rollcall vote:      Each delegation gets to name exactly two things about the group they represent.&nbsp; Two.&nbsp; You do not get to name every single federal representative from your State that happens to be a Democrat.&nbsp;   There is no introducing the person who will report how the delegation allocates its votes.&nbsp; There is no, "Hi I'm x blah blah blah and now I hand it over to y who will allocate the votes."  Maryland needs to not have  all  the key positions in the new administration.&nbsp; Senate Majority leader, House Majority Leader, Head of the Black Caucus . . . um, do any other states get to play?&nbsp; Selfish bastards.&nbsp;   Current Mood: Authoritarian

      I added a list of TV shows I'm following to the sidebar under "On the Small Screen."  Man, I watch a lot of TV.   There are more that I watch, but those are the ones I try not to miss.  Apparently I'm into crime, medicine, and the news.  Current Mood: Semi-accomplished yet vaguely guilty

      I received the new  urlLink IKEA catalog  yesterday. It makes me want to go down to the store and see what they have. Play that mental game of  If I had my own place and an unlimited amount of money  . . ., well, okay, if I had unlimited money I'd probably be shopping elsewhere. So more like  If I had my own place and a budget . .  .  Actually, I've been looking at  urlLink Dania , too.   I think IKEA's new catalog design is much improved over last year's. Last year's tried to demonstrate all the stuff you could fit into a tiny space and it just looked cluttered and icky.&nbsp; This one is much better.&nbsp; My problem is I have absolutely no style. I know just enough to know that the woods or at least the stains should probably match. But other than that . . .   Of course, since I have absolutely no idea of what kind of space I'll have and I don't have the funds to buy furniture right now it's all academic anyway.&nbsp; But it's still fun to think about.   For example, I'm a Winter.&nbsp; I'm drawn to Winter colors. But I'd like to have at least some rooms in the house done in a warm color scheme because I think even though I'm drawn to cool colors the warm colors are more inviting.&nbsp; Only warm colors are counterintuitive for me.&nbsp; It's all very confusing.  And I'm somewhat interested in Feng Shui but I don't know all that much about it and I'm certainly not going to hire someone to decorate my space.&nbsp; Maybe I could take a class in it.   I read a book once that suggested that you shouldn't have anything in your home that you don't absolutely love. I think that's a great concept, if impractical. But it would make for a great place to live.

      Pulled from  urlLink Myr's blog :  urlLink  Orlando Bloom  to Play College-Age James Bond .   Myr's reaction pretty much says it all:     Wow. The only way they could have screwed up that casting more is if they'd hired a black female midget to play the young James. Her more complete reaction can be found  urlLink here .   As for me, I have no desire to see James Bond does  Girls Gone Wild .&nbsp;   I don't know who I'd pick to replace Brosnan, but so far none of the suggestions have done it for me.&nbsp; And seriously, young James Bond?&nbsp; Why?

      Finally  urlLink found  that thing  urlLink Myriem was talking about .     Reiko Aylesworth  (" 24 ") has signed on to join the cast of the veteran drama. She'll play a lab-based detective in the series when it returns for its fifth season this fall. Industry insiders say the move is unrelated to the recent firings of cast members  George Eads  and  Jorja Fox . Additional details about her character are expected shortly.   She must be the replacement Grissom tells Greg to find in the season finale. That's too bad, I like the lab tech to be younger and cooler in a different age group kind of way. Like Greg on   CSI   and Abby on  Navy: NCIS .

      I caught most of  Teresa Heinz Kerry's  speech tonight.&nbsp; I may have to take back the things I've said about her being a liability to her husband's campaign.&nbsp;&nbsp; I still think there are things that she needs to work on, but I really liked her speech.&nbsp; She was one of the few people at the microphone who didn't talk very slowly and overy enunciate every word which is to say she sounded like a person instead of someone screaming each word and I appreciated that.&nbsp; She spoke eloquently and handled herself well.   While she wasn't as inspiring or energetic as  Bill Clinton , she was one of the better speakers I've seen so far.   The little girl, on the other hand, was annoying.&nbsp; But then, I find most kids to be that way so I'm not the best judge.&nbsp;

I probably won't put&nbsp;a link&nbsp;in my sidebar because I don't anticipate posting very much that isn't posted either here or on  urlLink Fresh Hell  and I still prefer Blogspot at the moment.&nbsp; But for those of you who use LJ, it's there.

       urlLink This  must have been what the DJ was talking about.   In other "  CSI  " news,  William L. Petersen  -- Head Investigator Gil Grissom -- didn't show for the first day of filming because of a recently diagnosed heart condition, says the Los Angeles Times. But the 51-year-old actor is scheduled to return to work today, along with  Eads  and  Fox .    Hopefully it's not too serious.

      A post about the Democratic Convention probably belongs on  urlLink Fresh Hell ,&nbsp;so I may parallel post it there.&nbsp; But really, you didn't think I could have a personal blog devoid of politics, did you?   I watched about an hour and a half of coverage last night.&nbsp; I was unimpressed with most of it.&nbsp; There were the standard "personal sob stories" families in trouble who had been helped by  Kerry  (or, more accurately, his staffers).&nbsp;&nbsp; It was at that point that I remembered why I watch so little of the Convention coverage despite the fact that I love politics.&nbsp; It's like watching the Olympics.&nbsp; Every single contestant has a story about overcoming adversity and all you really want to do is watch them compete.&nbsp;   There was a lot of 9/11 stuff.&nbsp; I'm not entirely sure what the point of that was.&nbsp;&nbsp; The speakers who included a mother who had lost her pregnant daughter and I believe her son-in-law, a violinist, and  Glenn Close,  kept saying we must never forget, as if there was a possibility that we'd wake up with mass amnesia.&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, it should be not be forgotten and yes, there should be some acknowledgement of it but the focus should be on how the Democrats want to shape the country.   There were some other speakers, including a man of the cloth who was with Kerry when he earned his purple heart.&nbsp;&nbsp; Again, typical elect this person because he's brave, decisive, etc.   I watched  Bill  and  Hillary  speak.&nbsp; I'll say it now.&nbsp; I  really  miss the  Clintons .&nbsp; Not only is  Bill Clinton  an amazing and gifted speaker, but he has infectious energy that this campaign badly needs.&nbsp; Even his campaign song is upbeat and energetic.&nbsp; The audience immediately started moving to the music as it played.&nbsp; Does anyone even know what  Kerry's  theme song is?   We need another gifted orator.&nbsp;  Bill Clinton  may not have been able to unite the country, but he was able to create harmony with our allies - - not alienate them.&nbsp; He could get Israel and Palestine to at least come to the table.&nbsp;   They both spoke about New York far more than was necessary.&nbsp; Yes, I get that  Hillary  is the Jr. Senator from New York, but New York is not the country, despite what New Yorkers seem to believe.   I really do miss being inspired by a president instead of having a president and his administration that tries to instill fear.&nbsp;  Clinton  believed in the power of government to be a source of hope and a force of good.&nbsp; I still don't know what  Kerry  believes.

      Part 2 of the root canal today. Thing that I learned today: I have tight muscles in my jaw. That means I get to be a lot more sensitive to things like, say, a big needle full of Novicaine being repeatedly stabbed into my cheek. (My dentist is a great lady and I don't mean to suggest that she was anything other than pleasant and skilled). But still, fun for me.   And I heard the radio DJ say a teaser about a new drama in the cast of   CSI   but after an hour she never did say what she was talking about. But she meant the original   CSI   because her co-host asked if she was talking about   CSI   or  CSI: Miami  and she mentioned she doesn't watch  Miami  because it sucks. My kinda woman.&nbsp; Although I would have liked to know what that teaser was about.&nbsp; I can't seem to find anything on-line (yet).

      You know how "they" say you learn something new every day?  Today I learned that I should  never ever  try to parallel park downhill.  Especially a steep hill. When I'm pulling forward I'm terrified I'm going to crunch the car in front and when I have to back up I'm afraid if I give it too much gas I'll crunch the car in the back but if I don't give it enough gas then I'll be back to crunching the car in front . . .    No cars were crunched in the making of this post.

      And my response to  urlLink Hana's response  to my response to  Sappho's Leap :  The other Sappho based novel I've read was called  Psappha  by Peggy Ullman.  I read it a while ago and remember thinking that it wasn't particularly good.  Sappho would have been risking everything for youthful passion.  In most Greek societies, women weren't even supposed to leave the house.  Think fundamentalist Islam, there are actually quite a few similarities where the treatment of women is concerned.  I believe the Greeks even built their houses so that line of sight was extremely restricted and women were often confined to the gynakeum (sp?) or women's quarters.  Oh I agree that if I were to have sex with someone it would be for a better reason than simply having the hots for them.  But I recognize that choice isn't for everyone.  And I don't think it's the choice that Sappho makes.  I don't believe in love at first sight because you can't possibly know someone well enough to be love when you first see them.  Deeply infatuated, yes.  And that, it seems to me, is what she felt for everyone except Praxia, Alceus and Aesop.  Aesop seemed like comfort sex but she feels friendly love not romantic love for him.  Same with Praxia although with Praxia there's the added master/slave dimension.  And it's worth remembering that Praxia  is  Sappho's slave until Sappho gives her her freedom.  The sex with Praxia seemed (from what little we saw) like it happened because Praxia was there, but it was nothing about Praxia herself except that she happened to grow up with Sappho.  The real Sappho did write about her students, though I don't think we saw very many of those poems incorporated into the story.  I think a lot more could have been done with them.    And it wasn't a waste of time to read it.  I realized when I reread my post that the ending came off more harshly than I meant it to.  I disliked nearly all the books we read in our bookgroup, and I recommended some of the worst.  But I'm still glad I read them.   I'm sorry,I didn't mean to make you feel bad.  And what was the deal with ferry boy anyway?  Aphrodite creates him  not  Alceaus as the end all be all and he's not really that important except to give Sappho a grandson.  He's supposed to be this great temptation, except she doesn't feel any differently about him than, say, the women on the boat.  He was there, he was convenient and he was a nice fuck, but that's about it.  I guess what really bothered me is that I felt like the sex was used in place of passion.  And while sex is certainly part of Sappho's poems, her poems are also about love and passion and that seemed to be completely lacking except where her daughter was concerned and again, at that point we're not talking about romantic love. Did she write any poems about her daughter?  I can't recall very many of them . . . hm.  Should get TM's input on this, she was the Sappho scholar.  The other thing that gets me about the two novels I've read (both written by women) is that much time is spent on the  men in her life, and very little is written about any woman except her daughter.  Any intimate relationship she has with a woman is perfunctory at best, as though the author(s) were acknowledging Sappho's love of women because you can't write about Sappho and ignore it completely, but you can minimize it to the point where it may as well be ignored.    I enjoy discussing books with you, and I really liked  Saffron , this one just didn't do it for me.  But that's okay.  We can certainly have different tastes and this appears to be one of those times. :)

      Hana  urlLink suggested  that I read  Sappho's Leap  by Erica Jong and then we have a discussion.&nbsp; So here's my reaction, anyone else who has read it feel free to join in.   I really need to stop reading&nbsp;novels about Sappho because I'm inevitably disappointed.&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, based on the two&nbsp;I've read.&nbsp; I should confess,&nbsp;I've read several books since  Sappho's Leap  so I'm probably&nbsp;forgetting a lot.   I had two main problems with this book.&nbsp; My first problem is that she's supposedly motivated by this deep, passionate love for Alceaus and I never&nbsp;got why.&nbsp; He's in the beginning for about 10 minutes when he lets her into the banquet and later when she&nbsp;goes with him until just before the attack.&nbsp; Apparently the time&nbsp;she's with him in his camp before the attack is when she falls in love with him, but we're shown very little of this.&nbsp; We're basically told they&nbsp;spend time together and have sex once (her first time).&nbsp; (As an aside, I love how there's virtually no discussion of what would have happened at that time if a noble woman had sex outside of marriage).&nbsp;   Sappho is a poet who write&nbsp;beautifully about love, but we don't really see her experiencing that love.&nbsp; We're just told that she does.   My second major problem is that the thing Sappho is best known for aside from her lyric poems,&nbsp; her school on Lesbos, is barely mentioned.&nbsp; I don't remember how many chapters it got,&nbsp;but it was certainly less than a quarter of the book.&nbsp;&nbsp;I'd like to see a novel that treats her school in depth.&nbsp; There are some wonderful poems that come out of her time at that school, it's a shame they weren't used.&nbsp;   The random  Odyssey  meets  The Aenied  was&nbsp;strange.&nbsp; It seemed like a typical historical novel right up until they're visiting the land of&nbsp;the dead.&nbsp; And after that weirdness it went back to being your typical historical novel sans the random conversations between Zeus and Aphrodite.   Which reminds me, the&nbsp;random interruptions with Zeus and Aphrodite were totally unnecessary.&nbsp; They inevitably ruined the flow&nbsp;of the story for me.&nbsp;&nbsp; There are ways to work that kind of thing in, but it was not handled very skillfully here.&nbsp;   Now a story that takes place primarily at the school and includes Aphrodite,  that  would be interesting.   As&nbsp;arguably  the  most famous Lesbian in history, Sappho's attraction to women was barely mentioned.&nbsp; The relationship with the priestess seemed more about sex than anything, and while she enjoyed instructing the women aboard the boat about&nbsp;sex it was one or two lines and didn't seem to mean anything to her other than, yeah, it's nice that I could do that.&nbsp; But there was little about genuine feelings for particular women.&nbsp;   Not a book I'd recommend, but that's okay.

      I saw  SG-1  for the first time in a long time.&nbsp; Is  Don S. Davis  still in the credits?&nbsp; I didn't notice.&nbsp; I think the whole General O'Neill thing isn't going to work if has to stay shoving paper around.&nbsp; I can't see Jack staying behind a desk while the rest of the team goes off adventuring.   I also saw an episode of  Stargate: Atlantis .&nbsp;  William Peterson  once said that the other   CSI   spinoffs will never be as good because they don't have his people (or words to that effect).&nbsp; That's how I feel about  Atlantis .&nbsp;&nbsp; The characters just annoyed me.&nbsp; They were whiney and uninteresting.&nbsp; But mostly there seemed to be a lot of whining.&nbsp;  I find the woman in power trend annoying.&nbsp; Both Landy in  The Bourne Supremacy  and Dr. Weir in  Stargate: Atlantis &nbsp;rubbed me the wrong way.&nbsp; &nbsp;I felt like the women were in power because someone decided that there should be a woman in power as a kind of token gesture.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Stargate: Atlantis  is clearly designed to be more PC, more of a "world effort" hence the people from different countries.&nbsp; Though is it really necessary to wear patches with the flag of your country?&nbsp;&nbsp; The only one I've really noticed is the Canadian guy, but still . . . and Landly was just irritating.   Why is it so hard to write female characters well?&nbsp; It clearly is a difficult thing to do.&nbsp; My favorite characters both in film and books are all male and I'm hard pressed to think of any female characters that I think are really well done.&nbsp;&nbsp; It's very frustrating.

      Great news.  King County Superior Court  Judge William Downing  ruled today that Washington's version of the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) violates Washington's Constitution.  If you have  any  interest in gay rights and/or gay marriage, read the  urlLink opinion .  It doesn't read like a typical opinion, which is to say that there's minimal legalese and it's anything but dry.  Judge Downing apparently has a pretty good sense of humor.  More importantly, he does an excellent and thorough job of explaining why legally and logically he ruled as he did.  He also carefully refutes the non-legal but common objections to barring gay marriage.    This is obviously going to go before the Washington State Supreme Court (for those non-Washingtonians, we have Superior, Appellate and Supreme state courts, well, excluding the Courts of Limited Jurisdiction).  Judge Downing was very careful not to raise any federal issues and deals exclusively with Washington's constitution.    Regardless of how the Washington State Supreme Court rules (my dad suspects it will be a 5-4 decision but isn't sure which way) I think this opinion is an excellent move in the right direction.     Judge Downing , thank you.  (someone remind me to vote for him)  Current Mood: Hopeful

      I'm still into the whole live journal icon thing. I wish I could have more than 3, but not enough to actually pay to do it. I'm still spending a fair amount of time looking for icons.  urlLink Myr  managed to  urlLink find  some for  Rosencrantz &amp; Guildenstern are Dead  which rocks. I  really  need that movie on DVD.  I couldn't find any  Navy:NCIS  icons though, which was surprising. I watched  NCIS  tonight and I'm really getting into the Gibbs/DiNozzo scene. I think the fandom has some really strong writers, which is always nice. I think the characters on  NCIS  are easier to capture in writing than the characters on   CSI  .  I think it's because the focus isn't as much on the case on  NCIS , although that's certainly a big part of it. But this episode (on Replay, not the episode that aired tonight) was particularly good for the Gibbs/DiNozzo fans what with the references to DiNozzo staying at Gibbs' place for a while at least once before, DiNozzo knowing Gibbs' sleeping habits and Gibbs' telling DiNozzo his door was unlocked (DiNozzo needed a place to stay because something in his apartment broke leaving him without electricity or hot water).  I also realized that Gibbs is a badass just like Gil Grissom, albeit in a more traditional way. But like Gil, he's a badass because he doesn't care whether or not he's a badass. Unlike, say,  CSI: Miami's  Horatio Kane who so very clearly does. Gibbs is also the least distanced from his team. He still has the "my private life is just that" vibe going on, but he manages to be tight lipped about his past and still seem constantly connected with his team in a way that Gil isn't. He's not the most approachable guy because he's a hardass, not because he's withdrawn and built a wall around himself. Though to Gil's credit, he's theoretically working on that a la  Jackpot . I love that episode.  sigh  I want it on DVD dammit!  Anyway, there's a lot more to actually work with in terms of slash in  NCIS  than   CSI   but that's alright.  It's just that much better if you have to work for it.   Gil's still definitely #1 in my book.  Current Mood: Content

      I finished  urlLink Demon .  I have to say, not one of my favorite modules.  I don't feel a need to play it again, which is good in a way because I would have wanted to start at the beginning of the series and that would take  hours .  I feel bad though because I've been  urlLink following  Adam's progress and I know he's devoted  a lot  of time and energy to it.  One of the reasons I've loved his other modules, particularly  urlLink Dreamcatcher , is because of the strong character development which was lacking in this this one.  Ah well, I'll always have Dreamcatcher.  There are a couple other series I'm waiting to complete, but I have no idea when the next modules will be out.

       urlLink Demon  finally came out on Saturday so of course that's pretty much all I've been doing. I was playing until 4:30 this morning. Because hey, three hours of sleep before work is plenty, right? If I really like it I'll be very tempted to go back and replay the entire series from the beginning. It's like when an author adds a book to a long series and you feel like you should really go back and read the entire series again, except that there are 10 books so you know it's going to take a while and you're not going to get anything else done. So we'll see. Besides, the  urlLink Dreamcatcher  modules are fantastic but  urlLink Shadowlords  is a little slow to start and while they're definitely fun to play, I think Dreamcatcher is much better. But then the Dreamcatcher series is my favorite of all time and it's hard to beat that. The jury's still out on Demon.  Friday night was all about Live Journal icons. I can see why  urlLink Myr's  obsessed with them. My favorite so far are by  urlLink Foxglove , though I've seen some great   CSI   icons as well. (Thanks to Myr for pointing me in the right direction for Foxglove/Circe.)  If Blogger would just have user icons and mood indicator icons it would be perfect. You can upload pictures for free now, but it's just not the same. Plus there's this whole you have permission to use my icons on LJ but I imagine if you want to use them on Blogger (or any other blogging site) you should ask specifically. That having been said, I must admit I yanked one of mine from a service called great journal or something. But you couldn't leave a message for the author unless you were registered and no one else seemed to have any icons of  Gaiman's  Death. Well, there are some from the manga, but the manga is too cute for me. I haven't read it, but the art . . . The Endless are not cute. I guess you could argue that Delirium is cutesy, but none of the others are.  I also hung out with Christina on Saturday.  We did a lot of window shopping, spent a lot of time in  urlLink Fireworks  playing the "if I had unlimited money and sometimes space" game. I love Fireworks, it's full of the kind of stuff you want to buy but have no idea what you'd do with it if you did.  If only it weren't so expensive.   They do have some beautiful artwork.  It's just a cool place to hang out.   And the good thing about high prices is that I'm less likely to randomly buy something, unlike, say, a bookstore.  If we'd gone to a bookstore I would have been lost.   Fortunately, we didn't. I'm trying not to buy any more books until I can make a dent in the ones I already own.  Yeah, go ahead and laugh.
