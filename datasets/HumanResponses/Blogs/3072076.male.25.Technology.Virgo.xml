       Yesterday I went to see the much-hyped Mani Ratnam movie " urlLink Yuva " with Kalpana and Asif. Much to my disappointment, the movie did not make an impact and lacked the luster one would have expected from a Mani Ratnam movie.  Yuva is painstakingly slow. It drags. It does not have a firm story line. Hence, one can find the " youth moving into politics trying to clean the scum of the earth " kind of an old tune being played this time though by a much respected and professional producer/director. Somehow from the beginning of the movie I had begun to believe that the movie is going to suck. Who knows, it could have been my dreamy sleepy eyes which wanted the much needed rest after a grueling day at office; that made me want to doze away, forcing me to loose all interest in the flick.    So what?s the story?  All things said and done, Yuva is a drama, a serious movie about three men (Devgan, Bachan, Oberia) who, coincidently fall into each other, having their own story narrated by Ratnam in his own good style. The biggest drag, however, was the climax that was shown four times, over and over again, from each person's perspective.  Devgan is a Student Political Leader, interested in cleaning the scum from the Indian politics by working things out HIS way. Bachan is the corrupt politician?s right hand who is asked to kill Devgan, as the latter?s advances into politics seems to threaten the corrupt politician's fate. Oberia is a person thrown into the plot, a flirt my nature, having a desire to settle in the US of A, saves Devgan when he is shot by Bachan and would become a major fan of what Devgan wants to do, ending up beaten to pulp by Bachan and of course at the end winning the elections along with Devgan. Even A. R. Rahman's music was no music to the ears.  To cut the story short, there is nothing great in this movie, care to ignore it or wait till it comes on Sony/Set MAX/Star, which I fear, is going to be pretty soon.   urlLink Read more

       So, it is finally over. After a month long pain of arranging things for our own marriage Kalpana and I are finally glad that everything just went fine. The biggest surprise, however, comes from the fact that even after five days both of us fail to believe that we are finally married to each other and would be living together for the rest of our lives.   Not many relatives from both my father's and mother's side had turned up so it was easy managing the lot. The  Devagon  and  Yagnopavita  where done gracefully and everyone had some good fun too. To my embarrassment, I had to take my shirt off during the thread ceremony (Yagnopavita) and bare my hirsute paunch to the lot. The marriage, on the other hand, was a great surprise to all. No when anticipated that the  urlLink Arya Samaj  people will no such a nice job. I think my granny really loved the stuff.  Papa left the next day as Annie had to get back to college. Mama is leaving tomorrow with granny. Kalpana and I would be leaving on the 28th for Jammu to attend the reception on the 30th. I must say I should have taken the days off from today till Friday but I guess it is too late now. I sure made a mess out of it.   Its been great fun all together, meeting old pals from college; Adapa Srinivas ( got placed with Wipro from IIM-L and he is also getting married soon ), Abhik ( he is joining IIM-A next month, would really miss him here. He has been a darling ), Deepak Alse, Vagi ( both working with Wipro ), Abhishek Katwale, Poulimi ( both working with Citibank after finishing their MBA ), Surya, Anand, Chetan Nipane and of course Sanchay; the people from office; the people from CDAC; relatives and friends.  Gosh, One memorable marriage.

       The days are numbered now and I can count them on my fingers. On the twenty first day of the fifth month of this fourth year of the new millennium I shall be added to the list of 'the responsible men of the world'; what's worst, I have already started getting nightmares as weird as a marathon shopping spree where at the end Kalpana purchases almost nothing, a marathon roti making session, kids coming in tandem and pissing over my face while I am fast asleep and some more weirdoes which I can't even talk about on this blog.  Out of the three mentioned above the most irritating is of course number one. Its a big pain to shop with Kalpana who, in spite of having a particular taste, would want to look at everything under the sun; what's worst, when my Mom is around to give her company, one feels as miserable as an Ostrich.  Tomorrow is going to be a very hectic day. Papa and Annie would be coming in the evening along with Nana and some more relatives. The  Mainzraat  ( the night where ladies sing and the groom sobs ) is on the 19th and so is the  Devagon  ( the pooja of Lord Ganesha, at least that's what my father wants for my Devagon ). 20th is another big day; my  Yagnopavith  ( the thread ceremony, without which I am not entitled for marriage ) and then the big day of course.  more updates later

       The verdict has come. NDA is finally out. Atal Bihari Vajpayee is a quiet man today and back to what he has been doing for some of the best years of his tenure at the Parliament; sitting on the other side, part of the opposition, now of course the leader of the tribe.  The congress has arrived and so has the scion of the Gandhi family and along with them all those dark horses who, in the recent past, had laid there fate to rest assuming they were already out of the big game.     This is India, where most of the people who have really seen India shining never care to come out of their fortresses to cast their ballot, which of course has taken an electronic metamorphosis. This is the country where people living in localities for decades don't find their names in the voter list. This is the country where a person can't vote because he does not belong to the city where he earns his living. This is country which does well at the international markets but whose democratic structure is governed by the mood of its rural population.   The verdict is out. The farmer is not happy. He has not seen what he was promised. A delayed monsoon, a drought in most parts of the country, no drinking water or electricity, why should he not vote against the NDA?   Rome was not built in a day neither do economic reforms happen by football rules. It takes time for a change to materialize and to translate to all fields. In my opinion the NDA deserved a second term but then that's just my two cents.  Wishing the Indian National Congress and its allies the best of the next five years.  urlLink Read More

       After all these days, now I know that Kalpana likes "Ginger Chicken". Went to dine out yesterday with Tanu, Raja and Datta. What a feast :)

       Living in Bangalore could sometimes become quite boring for frequent diners and this time when I was going out with my team I could feel the dearth of dinning options in the silicon city. Some people might think  eating out in five or six star hotels could be exciting but I personally prefer going to small places. Hence, this time we went to the "Feast of Asia", a small Chinese restaurant along the Kormangla Inner Ring road. The food was spicy and tasty yet affordable. What more, I am planning to go there with Kalpana again. :)

       I am really surprised to see how the propaganda is going on for the general elections in India since the last couple of months. It is nothing but a joke and a mockery of democracy in the world biggest democratic country. The element of surprise comes from the fact as to how the poor and illiterate people are being mislead by the politicians on the use of the electronic voting machine. " If you press any other button, you will get electrocuted ", " Even if you press any button the vote shall be counted for Laloo " and many more. This is really a shame. For a country which has been economically doing well of late, the threat of having an unstable government at the centre is certainly going to mar the Indian economy.  urlLink Read more

        Finally, the name changes   From sometime, I was thinking of renaming this blog from the exanimate title "Piyush Garyali's Weblog" to something else. When I finally could not think of anything else even after giving it so much thought, I thought  T h o u g h t s ...   would look like a title I was thinking about.   So hereafter  urlLink http://piyushgaryali.blogspot.com  would take you to the 'thoughts' of Piyush Garyali. Gee, I guess I should get back to work now.

       Sometimes I wonder why I still haven't renamed my blog to something like   l'estomac affam&eacute; parle   [The Famished Stomach Speaks] but then I can't help but write about yet another dining-out adventure I got into this Saturday when Kalpana decided that she wanted to have something Punjabi.   Owing to the fact that both of us are pretty bad at our culinary skills and that too coking Punjabi food at home would have been more of an exercise in itself, we decided to hunt for a good place to hog.  As I have mentioned before, hunting for a good place to eat in Bangalore can sometimes become quite annoying. We took the Bangalore Times which has a special section on food on Fridays where the restaurants throw up ADs in the anticipation of the fact that all the IT people in the city would definitely want to move out of their daily boring schedules and dine out on the night of Friday as Saturday happens to be a holiday.  So, Kalpana jumped ahead of me to grab the paper and was pretty fast in finding out about some restaurant by the name "Chandani Chowk" in Koramangla which happens to be 'the' place to have Punjabi food (well according the AD at least). Directions Madame??  "Oh, its on the Koramangla 80 ft road next to Microland ", she said.  Only after reaching Microland and knowing the fact that the 80 ft Road was no where near to this so called landmark, I knew for sure we were lost but still, to try our luck out, we went as far as Asian Sports Village and found nothing. What next?  "Well, now that its getting late and we are hungry too, lets go to the Feast of Asia ", she said, a little disappointed though as I knew she wanted to have something good. (not that Feast of Asia is not good)  So, we started moving back to where we came from and were all set to park our Honda 'Activa' (can't we make that invisible) when I saw something just opposite to Feast of Asia that made my eyes sparkle. No No!! It was not  "Chandani Chowk"  but another Punjabi restaurant called  "Dal Roti" . :)   Dal Roti  At first I thought this place would not be as nice as it turned out to be. Situated on the first floor, just opposite to the Feast of Asia, this place is really 'the' place to go if one is looking for a break from the daily dose of South Indian delicacies. The menu is in English but reads Hindi. So, one can find the name of the dish in pure Punjabi iStyle, "Sarsoon da Saag aur roti" and what more it also serves some Chinese dishes and the section in the menu for those delicacies reads "Chini Chini" .. I thought that was really cute.   So, what did we have? Before I answer that I would like to add that this place serves both vegetarian as well as the other kind. Well, we started with the Veg Clear soup, which was really well made, no additives, no sticky business, plain clear soup with whole bunch of vegetables. To accompany that we went for the "Dandi Veg Kebab", something really delightful, and came as five kebabs rolled on small sticks served with Pundeney ki Chutni.    For the main course we went for Karela Masala (wow!), Rajma and can you believe it, these guys serve you plain atta rotis, the one your mother would make for you. Though they also have the regular variety of breads usually available in any restaurant these days, I would definitely vouch for the plain ones.   Well, the food was tasty (no doubt) and quite in the budget too but then there were so many other things to try out, looks like I would have to pay these guys a visit again :)   Till I find where "Chandani Chowk" actually is, its "Dal Roti" all the way.

       I had been waiting for this movie every since I heard that Farhan Akthar is making a new one. After  Dil Chatha Hain  I had a feeling that there was going to be something different about  Lakshya  as well.   The movie got released in Bangalore on the 18th (Friday) and the first thing I did after getting up on the 19th was to go to  Innovative Multiplex  and book the tickets. Lucky me for when I reached the theatre the tickets were only available for the night show.  The show was at 10:00 in the night. When I reached the theatre with Kalpana, Asif and Chetan (Asif's friend who is studying at IIM-B) I found that they were screening the movie in all four screens. For a while I thought the people at  Innovative multiplex  were damn rich guys to have the courage of buying four prints of the movie. Later, after talking to one of the gate boys, I found that they actually had one print but they would be running it in all four screens. For a while I could not make any sense of out it so I kept bothering him for more details to which he gave me the following explanation. The four screens of the multiplex were at the four corners and hence the central projection area for all the screens was same. So, the reel would be fed to the first projector and then to the second, followed by the third and fourth. This way all the four screens would be showing the same movie with a delay of just about four to five seconds between them. Amazing isn't it. Well, I wondered if this was legal? Anyway, due to the arrangements the movie got deferred by 20 minutes.   About the movie  Lakshya is a movie about the Kargil war but is completely different from the regular "Sunny Deol" stereotypes. Its is all about a boy who is not sure of what he wants to do with his life till is joins the army and ends up becoming a captain at the LOC. The movie is about the transformation of Hrithik from a confused person to a focused individual and the gifted director has handled this change in an outstanding manner. The cinematography is awesome especially the ones at Kargil. One nearly misses a beat in the rock-climbing scene that talks loudly about sheer professionalism. I was literary in tears in the scene where Hrithik talks to his father before going for the mission. This movie is worth the 120 bucks spent and I am going to see it again even if Kalpana sits on my head and bangs it.    urlLink Read more

       At last! The snaps have been uploaded. All these days it was on the back of my mind that I had to upload the photographs but I used to forget it every day. Good that Kalpana chose to do it before it was time to upload the ones for our anniversary :P (bad joke)  Click  urlLink here  to view the Ofoto Album. You might have to Sign In to view the album. The snaps also have the description of all the steps which were taken in the wedding conducted according to Arya Samaj. So viewing the slide show would be interesting.

       More on food. Weekend Shopping!! And this time we went to  The Forum , the new "Mega" Shopping mall at Kormangla. Wedding gifts? Some friends had given gift vouchers for  Landmark  and  Westside , so it was time to redeem them before they would become invalid. Kalpana was busy getting goodies for herself and some cute things for the house. Poor me, she did not buy me anything. Anyhow, once all the shopping was done, it was time to hog and the perfect place for a quick bite was " Transit ", the food court at  The Forum .  This place is awesome, the look and feel gives you an impression as if you are in some Bond movie, the food is not bad either. This time though we had a bite of the Thai food at the " Panda Club ".  Chicken Satay , kind of a Thai version of Chicken Tandoori though the size was a hundred times smaller. I had a Thai combo non-veggie meal while Kalpana went for the Vietnamese Combo veg meal which she did not like one bit. So, I had to swap my plate with her in the anticipation that she does not throw up. What can I say, she has peculiar tastes :) But I had a good time and I really feel the food court is done well, a thousand times better than the one at Kemp Fort.  Highly recommended for a change.

        "Harry Potter 3"  and  "The Day After Tomorrow"  are out in theatres now and I am thinking of plans to convince Kalpana to come with me to the movies. I know it is going to be really tough to make her agree to come for both movies in one weekend, so all I can do is to pray that they continue to be screened till next Saturday. What's worst I can buy her into this by agreeing to go for  "Hum Tum".   Lets see :)

       Talking of places to eat; this one is new. Its called   Manjia  , a Chinese restaurant in JayaNagar on top of the Corner House. The food is extremely pleasing though a little expensive.   It was Saravana's birthday on the 2nd of June and he decided to give a treat today which turned out to be good opportunity to taste the wide variety offered by the restaurant.  So, if you plan to go to this place here are some hints to pick your meal  1) If you are a vegetarian/Non Vegetarian, go for a Hot and Sour vegetable/Chicken soup. It is mind blowing.  2) For starters you can have the Spinach Toast if you are a vegetarian or the threaded Chicken if you happen to be a non-veggie. These are really different and you would not have had anything like this before.  3) For the main course go for Chicken volcano, Mongolian Noddles or Szchewan Egg trapped fried rice; something really new.  4) You can avoid the Combo meals and the vegetable spring roles as they are not worth the money.   How do I reach there?  Simple, If you know the road in Jaya Nagar where Nandani and G K Vale are on your left and Pizza Hut is on your right, keep going straight, cross the junction and you will find the place right at the corner.  Happy weekends

       Talk about 'corruption' and you can find it written all over in any Indian Office.  This time though I had a taste of it at the office of the registrar where I had to pay a visit to get my marriage registered.   The deal  The deal was simple. One fine day, I went to this office to enquire about the things which need to be attached with the registration form and I was not amazed to find a person being too polite to me. He was even kind enough to come all the way down to the shop where I paid 30 bucks for the registration form.  Next week, while Kalpana and I were leaving to get this job done I asked her to carry an extra bit of cash as we might find it handy. Needless to say, she was already ready with it in the anticipation of what was coming our way.  On reaching that place, I was asked to see this *Madam* on the first floor who would be helping  me out with the next level of proceedings. She was also very kind and at that time I had a  feeling that this endeavor is going to cost me a fortune.   Not to my surprise, the *Madam* asked the same old chap, who I found the other day, to  accompany me towards the ground floor where I was supposed to pay the *official* sum of  15/- bucks. While I was coming back, he asked Kalpana to take a seat, thinking the 'poor girl' need not know what's going to happen next. Well, I must say that was a  blessing in disguise for her. She was already tired pushing one corner to another with  me and I could see that she was more than happy to take the seat.   Climax  While in the middle of the staircase, the chap told me. "Look sir, when do you want  to get this done. I understand this is Urgent, Right!", putting a little more emphasis on the 'Right'. I knew what was coming and I did not want to get into any verbal disputation, so I placed the 150 bucks I had in my hand quietly into his. Needless to say, I was a way too nervous as this was the first time I was doing anything like this. I assumed the story would have an happy ending here but something he said drove me out of the imagination-loop. "Kitna Hain (How much is it)?". "150", I shot back. "Well, Madam  ko bhi dena hain .. who manegi nahi (you need to give some to Madam otherwise she  won't agree). No need to mention as to what I did next.  So there I was, in front of *Madam*, with the registration form and other stuff in my hand and the money tucked under them all. I was so nervous that I just did not know what to do.  *Madam* stared at me for sometime and then started to look into the case of another couple. Then she asked another person to look into my matter which indirectly meant that I had to give the money to the new guy. What a network!  Nervous I was, I did not move, did not even say anything. The new guy waited for sometime and I feel he understood that I was new in this trade. He told me in front of  everyone, "You have to give a fee, Sir". There you go! I handed him the cash in front of all told him that I wanted to take the certificate by evening and bingo! my job was done.   After thought  If you look at it now, there are approximately 5 people coming every hour for getting  the registration done. So assuming that Madam works for her full quota of 6 hours, she can expect 5 * 6 * 200 = 6000 bucks everyday. Lets assume she donates 50% of that to the other shit heads, she still earns a healthy sum of ~90,000 untaxable income per month.   What does the Govt Loose?  The rule is that with every marriage registration an NSC for 2000 bucks from a post office needs to be purchased by the couple. So, going by the same logic, 30 registrations per day would have given the Govt a revenue of 2000 * 30 registration  = 18 Lakhs per month. As this is just a small office, 200 to 300 bucks per registration is peanuts. I fail to imagine the stakes involved in the big *Page 1* scams!  Well, I never wanted to get involved into all this and by paying a 'fee' I count myself as a criminal too but then do you think with a system where corruption creeps in from the lowest level of authority, I would have wanted to wait for the next 'n' number of years just to prove to the authorities, which happen to be the same kind of people, that I  have married Kalpana Palaniswamy!!  I feel that's a waste.  Anyhow, God bless *Madam*!!
