       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rating : ** &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seen Via : In The The Theaters &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Buy This Movie : Not Yet Available  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was honestly not a very good &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;movie. I really loved the actual premise &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of it, though: evil fighting evil. The necromongers were pretty damn cool, as were the Furians, which is what Vin Diesel's character Riddik is. They didn't delve deep enough into the story, however. What was with the Furian eyes? I know they were special, but we just don't know. Also, this movie was too predictable.  All in all, this movie was exactly as I had expected it. The plot was flimsy, but the action was good. The dialogue was absolutely hilarious, though. My favorite line was this one: "It's been a long time since I smelled beautiful," uttered by Riddik. Damn, I almost had to hold my hand over my mouth to keep from laughing to that.

       urlLink One Word   Home is where the heart is. Home is the place where I feel most comfortable. No matter how old I am, whenever I have a sleepover I miss my bed. It's just a response to the loss of familiarity. I also feel so comfortable at home because I'm with people who will never stop loving me, even if I say stupid things.

       urlLink Random Inspiration    List 10 words that you hate.    Weird. It's so hard to spell!   Finally. For the same reason   Hair. When you say it with my, your words slur together in the most annoying way. Plus, I hate mine and get teased about it often, so hearing the word only brings to mind the teasing.   Like. It's way overused. I find the whole valley-girl thing very annoying   Coffee. It's weird, and I hate coffee.   Antidisestablishmentarianism. It's long, it's gangly, and it's just annoying.   Homies. WHY IS THIS WORD USED! WHY CALL PEOPLE homies WHEN YOU CAN JUST CALL THEM FRIENDS? IT'S STUPID! Plus, it's the same length as friend, so what's the point?   Retard. It's used in the wrong fashion (I do it, so I guess I shouldn't complain), and often. It's also a word that isn't associated with good things.   Sexy. It's just annoying.   Yo. Damn, that word annoys me. Why do you say yo when you mean you or hello? It's only one letter different from you, and there's already an abbreviation for hello. It's hi. So shut up with the yo thing, okay?

       urlLink Blog Ideas    How long have you been blogging?  I've been blogging since October 27, 2003. So, it's been over seven months since I began. I had my first blog until March 2004, and got a new one then. I moved to my own domain some time in June or July (haven't put it up yet, so I don't know!)

       urlLink The Saturday-8    1. When was the last time you went car shopping, either for your own car or for someone else's?  I went car shopping with my father around four years ago, which is when he bought the car he just traded in for his new one. I didn't go shopping for his brand new one with him, though.   2. When was the last time you had an ear infection? What did you do?  I had an ear infection last summer, I think. I didn't go swimming for a week while at camp, and I took antibiotics.   3. I was lucky enough to find a car that my mechanic had to sell. Unfortunately, I need to wait for 1.5 weeks before it's ready. How long have you ever had to wait on a car repair?  I have never waited on a car repair, I've never had to buy a car, and I've never had to drive one. I'm without a car.   4. I can't swallow well at all. What do you do when you have a horribly sore throat?  I swallow, drink lots of water, clear my throat a lot, and complain.   5. I gave my mechanic a down payment for the car, and will owe them approximately $3K, which I'll be paying off when I can. I haven't had a car payment in 5 years. Do you have a car payment currently?  Nope. Again, I have no car, so I have no car payment.   6. I skipped a trip to the doctor's because I knew what I had, and instead got some doxycycline from a neighbor like I did the last time I had this double ear-infection/crap throat thing. Have you gotten antibiotics or prescription drugs from someone who was NOT a licensed pharmacist?  Nope. My parents would never let me do that, and I would never do something stupid like that anyway. The only place I would get prescription drugs from would be a licensed doctor of physician.   7. Have you ever been in an accident so severe that the car was totaled? If not, tell us about a totaled car of someone you know.  Nope, and I don't know of a time.   8. When I was in high school, I was sick with mono for 2 months. I was SO weak; I had to sleep by the toilet for one week because I could not walk. What was the longest that you have ever been sick?  I was sick for a very long time when I was two and first discovering that I was gluten intolerant. I don't know how long this was, since it was so long ago. The runner up is when I was sick for a week with the chicken pox.   Originally Written on June 11, 2004

       urlLink Diarist.Net Spark    Pride, Envy, Gluttony, Sloth, Lust, Wrath, and Greed. The "Seven Deadly Sins" — a warning for some, a party checklist for others. Whether you think they're capital transgressions or merely personality quirks, you can't deny at least a spark of each dwells within you.   Perform an inventory and audit of these sins in your life. For each, perhaps ranking them, evaluate the degree of power, and account for the reasons — overt actions, or hidden feelings — lurking beneath them.   Do you try to minimize these traits, or revel in them? Which is the least of your worries? Which sin would be your signature?     Pride   Pride is probably something I don't have to work on much. I take pride in my work, and sometimes I brag about it slightly, but getting good grades or doing well isn't usually something I do. I know people who do this constantly, and it really freaking bugs me. I definitely try to minimize this trait, because of how annoying I know it to be.    Envy   This one is something I seriously have to worry about. I get envious about almost anything. If someone gets a better grade, I feel slightly jealous. If someone is liked more then I am, I feel jealous. There are numerous occasions in just about every day during which I feel envious. I don't really try to minimize it so much, but I sometimes feel guilty about my jealousy.    Gluttony   Gee, well, umm, wow. I don't really know about this one. I eat  a lot , but I wouldn't say I was gluttonous. I eat what I get, and if there's more I might eat that too. I can stuff myself on WAY too many snacks after a meal, but other then that I am okay. The only thing I can't stay away from is ice cream. This is my most favorite food. There are so many kinds, and so many toppings. I could eat ice cream all day, every day, forever and ever.    Sloth   Ah yes, here's another one I've got to work on. I am one of the laziest people you are likely to ever meet. If I can't get it done quickly, I probably won't want to do it at all. I get bored with things and I move on, or I just get tired of work. This is why I have learned almost no HTML; I'm too lazy to take the time to learn it. I NEED to work on this.    Lust   I'm 13. I'm not quite in the "teenage boy" mindset yet, so I don't have this to worry about.    Wrath   I get angry A LOT. Once more, something I need to work on here. Little things get me mad, and big things get me mad. It's not that hard to get me mad, and oftentimes I get into screaming/yelling/crying tantrums with my parents. So yeah, I've got some problems with wrath. Well, why do you think I named this site  Grrness: The Mutterings of an Often Angry Teen ?    Greed   And here it is, my signature sin. I am one of the greediest little (female) bastards you will ever encounter. I want everything, but don't need much. I go into a store, and I'm all, "I want it. Give it to me  NOW !" Yeah, my signature sin, and probably the worst of the lot. Go Marsha the Greedy!    Originally Written on June 11, 2004

       urlLink Random Inspiration    What could you not live without?  I couldn't live without my computer. It is my life. It is my salvation. Without it, I would always be bored. If I was a poet, and I didn't know it, I would write a verse for this wonderful contraption. Whoever invented computers, I salute you!   Originally Written on June 11, 2004

       urlLink Blog Ideas    If you were president…  If  I  was president, which will never happen, the world would be screwed. I'm no good at making people do things they're supposed to, I know nothing about politics, I'm clueless about almost everything, and I would basically make the worst politician in the world. Plus, I don't have opinions on anything. What would the world do with a president who can't make up her mind?   Originally written on June 11, 2004
