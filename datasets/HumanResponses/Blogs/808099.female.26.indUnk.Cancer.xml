      I'm not a good girl.  Am I?  My boyfriend is, however, a reformed slut.  Five years slut-free, because of me.  Hmm.  The way I worded that, it sounds as though he is five years free of associating with sluts.

      If I don't stop looking at pictures of Anthony Stewart Head on last week's episode of  Buffy , I may never accomplish anything.  Damn him for being so gorgeous!

      Blogger, blogger, on the wall... Why is my baby sister prettier than me???   Why???     Funnily, K and I have almost the identical haircut now.  Hers is a far better color than mine, thanks to Clairol.  I know how to fix that.  In other news, Will, Jenn, Geoff and I started a Deadlands campaign yesterday.  I am already sad and depressed, less than 24 hours later, because we're not playing.  I think I am starting to understand why so many AD&D geeks are such losers.  Poor things - I feel your pain!

      Yesterday I went to the Buzz Stop.  It's a hair place.  I was hoping, based on the name, that they also sold coffee, but alas, no.  Anyway.  I went there because my hair was a disaster, and I got paid.  I was planning on growing it into a Louise Brookes style bob (shorter than I always used to keep it, but longer than it was yesterday), but it really needed something done to it in the meantime.  So my hairdresser's name was London.  Yes, I know.  London.  He was this oddly straight dude with a strange, hip attitude.  (I think.  In all honesty, though, I wouldn't know  hip  if it smacked me in the face.)  I explained the trouble.  He looked at my head.  A lot.  He then uttered the devilish phase, "I wish you would let me give you a pixie cut," and proceded to describe a sort of updated pixie cut which would involved straightening my hair and kinda spiking it a bit.  I argued, but was weak.  I told him that if I hated it he'd get no tip.  He cut.  He styled.  I look fabulous.

      I love my UPS man!  A little while ago the doorbell rang.  (I live in an apartment.  This was the apartment door.)  I figured it was the building manager, who was supposed to send an electrician by weeks ago.  Will called him earlier.  It wasn't.  It was the UPS driver, with a package for me!  My name wasn't on the board downstairs, so he'd tracked me down!  He was cute too.  Life is good.  John sent me movies and candy.

      I think I'm going to be ill if I don't stop laughing hysterically like this.  After posting at the Watcher's Diary, asking* people to use spoiler tags if they were going to discuss the current season of  Buffy , I have received more replies than any other post I have  ever  made there.  Here are a few examples of the comments from morons who do not quite understand what an "established board member" is:   So, you're 24 and can't express yourself without resorting to profanity?!   That's not something most people would brag about.    About the spoilers, I agree with your sentiment, just not the pathetic way you expressed it.  *********************************************************  You have some serious anger management.  I don't like non tagged spoilers either,  but it's no need to fly that word around a public forum.  I don't care how old you are.   Darling.   The second one got deleted, which is too bad, because it made me laugh.  Oh well.  *cussing at them

      I was just in the bath for an hour and a half.  I feel remarkable.  I read  The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe , exfoliated, shaved, washed, and relaxed.  Suddenly, nothing seems too much to handle.  (Except for the jeans I tried to squeeze myself into afterwards.  I got them on, but may have to cut myself out of them...)

       She said - he said   I want nice things, a nice home.  He wants more movies.  I want to get married and have a family.  He wants to have a career.  I worry about the future.  He worries about now.  I save instruction manuals.  He saves...actually, I cannot think of anything important he saves.  I like fleshy geek girls.  He likes plastic girls.  I want to go out.  He wants to stay in.  Maybe we  aren't  meant to be together.

      Things are better today.  Not 100%.  Not yet.  Maybe 50%.  But still, better.  I'm smoking, though - that's bad.  What's worse, I lit a cigarette while typing that.  In other news, I made a friend today.  In still  other  news, I have decided that I wish to be a  urlLink Suicide Girl .

       A Woman's Life and Love    Since I first saw him, I think myself blind  I look around me, and it's only him I see  His image floats before me,  So gentle and so kind, he has got a clear mind and firm courage  o ring upon my finger, little golden ring  devoutly I press you to my lips and to my heart  sisters come adorn me, banish foolish fear  twine upon my furrowed brow  the blossoming myrtle  I serve him and live for him  Belong wholly to him  Give myself and find myself transfigured by his brightness  Ring upon my finger, little golden ring  Devoutly I press you to my lips and to my heart  The blissful dream of childhood has ended  Now I drink delicious death with you my love   Now you have me caused me my first pain … that really hurt.   You sleep, you hard cruel man, the sleep of death  The veil falls, the bell tolls, the black shawls, the carriage rolls  You, my whole world.

       Pathetique    I bear no grudge, even though my heart may break  Eternally lost love, I bear no grudge  Though you're shining in your diamond splendor  No ray of light falls on the darkness of your heart  I've known it well for a long time  I bear no grudge.  Ich grolle nicht  und wenn das Herz auch bricht  Ewig verlornes Lieb!  Ich grolle nicht.  Though you're shining in your diamond splendor  No ray of light falls on the darkness of your heart.  I've known it well for a long a time  I bear no grudge.  I saw you in a dream, I saw the darkness in your heart.  I saw the snake that feeds upon your heart  I saw my love how utterly wretched you are  I bear no grudge, I bear no grudge  I'm over you, so come on back to me O.K.?

      What is it about alcohol?  It makes people into entirely new people, ugly, violent people.  And I am afraid that maybe that is the real person, uninhibited.  In other (totally related) news, I was given two packs of cigarettes last night by a Camel promoter.  What is it about misery that makes me want to kill myself?

      Grrrrrr.  I never do my best thinking in the morning, particularly when taken unawares.  As I got out of the shower just now, my cell phone rang.  I haven't used my phone much in months, for a few reasons: 1. it still has a Chicago phone number; 2. the phone itself is large and unwieldy; 3. I cannot make sense of my call plan and don't want to be charged for peak minutes.  So I answered the phone this morning, because I thought the caller ID said it was John.  What I forgot is that last night I'd used the address book feature to double-check his number, and hadn't cleared the display.  I also forgot that he'd be at  work .  [rolleyes]  It was Brandi, or Sandi, or something, from Sprint.  She wanted me to know about my outstanding bill of $229.54.  Now, I know my bill is past due, but  two hundred dollars ?  Inconceivable.  She said that she was calling me to have me pay over the phone by check or credit card.  I lied and told her that I didn't have my wallet or checkbook with me.  In actuality, they were (and still are) across the room, but there is no money in my account.  And by 'no money' I really do mean no money.  In fact there is approximately negative $1500 in my checking account.  Stupid overdraft.  I told her that I couldn't pay over the phone.  I told her that I had been trying to pay online, but unable to get onto the members area of the website*.  This part was absolutely true.  She said the site must be down.  I said, "For the last two months?"  She said that in that case I could pay over the phone.  I told her, somewhat incredulously, that I did not have my checkbook or wallet.  She asked if I had paid over the phone before, informing me that they would still have the credit card info.  I'm sure that's illegal, but all I said was that there was no balance on that card, which is perfectly true.  She said that I could pay over the phone or at a Sprint Store.  I, having no idea what a Sprint Store is (I've since figured out what she meant - I was flustered, but I'm not stupid), told her that I would surely do that.  I eventually got her off the phone by hanging up on her.  I   hate   Sprint PCS.    Now excuse me while I go try,  again , to get onto the website so that I can find out what I'm being charged for.  Bastards.  *I ceased being able to access the site immediately after I chose to receive no paper bills.  I am extremely suspicious that this may be a conspiracy on the part of Sprint PCS, and possibly the government as well, to get my money.

      Beth and I are  too cute .  We have requested matching titles at the Watcher's Diary, though no one will know it to look at them.  Mine shall be  candy lithium  and hers  what a dream life would be , both lyrics from  Tea & Thorazine  by Andrew Bird's Bowl of Fire.  [edit]  I suppose it would be helpful of me to note here that we already have matching avatars, signatures, and bios.  We are dorks.

      After some research (i.e. playing the CD) I have come to the conclusion that I do not like Rasputina.  I thought I would, because I enjoy listening to strings, but they are either over- or under-produced, or possibly just lacking in talent, and also I hate their arrangements.  "Why Don't You Do Right" is one of those songs that should be impossible to ruin, but they somehow succeed.  In other news, I think I am having an online affair with Christine.  She is from Germany, and very pretty.  Currently she is in Charlotte, NC, and I am plotting ways to get her to the west coast.

      As a much-needed break from my C&Ping of MSN chats, a series of Buffyguide private messages:  [me]  Come have sex with us!  Will is wearing chilli pepper pajamas, and I am wearing a tight leopard-print skirt and tank top. We are seeeeeexxxxxxxxy.  [Beth] Damnit! You know I  so  would have sex with you!  Stupid Indiana being so far away.   [me] I find it interesting that you named Indiana, the state you are  currently in , as being the far away one. Clearly your [heart] is already in California with me. That, or you forgot where I lived.   [Beth] You know... that's a really good point. I think my heart is in CA.   [me] Will: You're going to leave me for Beth. Me: Well, she  is  taller than you...By my calculations, that puts me at boobie level.   [Beth] Why do you have to leave Will? There's plenty of Beth for everybody.  Not everyone gets to be at boob level, though. You're special.  [me] Will says he is a one-woman man. I say we shall see.  Hang on. He just took it back. "I was thinking...there could be good aspects to having two women in my life..." He looks all thoughtful now.  [beth] You just let me know.   **"Will" is the Boyfriend Formerly Known As Sick Boy.

      Good lord, I am a dork.  I just spent ten minutes trying to get the jewel case for Twisted Willie down from its precarious position on a high shelf, because I do not know the names of Willie Nelson songs.  I was enjoying the cover by L7 (which I had to ask Sick Boy about, as I didn't recognize the band, either), and wanted to know the name of the song.  Well, it's "Three Days," and it's about the most obvious song title ever.  I mean, it's Willie Nelson - all of his song titles are obvious!  Why couldn't I just guess?  In other news, I spent over $100 at Target today,  without  buying myself any prezzies.  Toiletries are expensive!

      Well, I typed up the outline for my novel, wrote a chapter, and then went and got the car washed and oil changed.  And you know, I never ever ever in a billion years would have thought I'd write a novel.  I do short stories, not novels.  (Though, truth be told, I'll be lucky if this is a novella or even a novelette, seeing as the chapters are a page apiece.)

      I feel stupid posting two entries in a row, but oh well.  It's Friday the 13th, which I only noticed when I viewed my last entry.  I love Friday the 13th!  Sick Boy and I got together because of one.  (Long story.)  Today we get a paycheck, which is Very Good.  It would be better if we could stop going into overdraft, but until someone deems me worth paying for something, his income is all we've got.  I think I'm doing OK at keeping us above water, though it's getting close.  Heehee, speaking of water, it turns out that there  is  room for two in our tub.  Quite comfortably.  What was I talking about?

      I had trouble sleeping last night.  I think it's because I drank tea (caffeinated tea) before bed.  Which I swore wouldn't keep me up, but I was certainly awake half the night.  Oh well.  I felt  dead sexy , laying in bed next to my sleeping baby.    In the first year or so that we were dating, I tried wearing sexy clothes a few times, and he kinda laughed at me.  So, for obvious reasons, I gave it up.  The other day I was looking at pictures of Dita von Teese, and he asked me why I never dressed like her.  I was a little put off, and answered, flustered, that I wasn't as pretty as she is.  He made the near-fatal mistake of agreeing with me.  I became furious, because not only did he not respond to sexy clothing in the past, but he thinks that someone who has stylists looks better than me - I was wearing jeans and a t-shirt, and no make-up.  Duh!  After a brief fling with anger, I decided to get back at him.  I fetched my Sexy Bedroom Clothing from storage and tried it all on for him.  The item I like least, my pseudo-fishnet body stocking, really did it for him.  His tastes are retarded, but the nookie was pretty fine.  Last night I put on one of the outfits he'd laughed at in the past, a trashy little jacket-type top with panties, and once again it worked.  I really don't understand him.  I wish I had the money for more lingerie.  I really want a corset.

      I had a migraine all fucking day.  This excerpt from my chat with Tina (post-headache) cheered me up a little:  Tina says: Hey!  Just remembered a "homeopathic" remedy...a girl that used to get them said it would sometimes help to lay in a really hot bath with the lights off and just a candle or two... Bettie says: I wanted a bath today, but I tend to get lightheaded/dizzy when I have a bad headache, and I didn't think that passing out in the tub was a good idea.  Now that the Boy's home I may take one. Tina says: Just don't make it too deep   Bettie says: Heehee Tina says: Drowning to cure your headache seems a bit drastic   Bettie says: It seems awfully melodramatic.  I'll save it for when I'm famous. Tina says: hehehehehe....just make sure that enough people know that you were actually trying to cure a headache.  Drowning while trying to cure a headache is melodramatic...drowning in the tub for no apparent reason is just sad and overdone Bettie says: So true.  And I plan to be as original a celebrity as possible. Tina says: well, that WOULD be an "original" way to go   Tina says: (oh, and you wouldn't want anyone to think it was a new variation of autoerotic asphyxia) Bettie says: Certainly not! Tina says: because if you're going to die during sex, it would REALLY be sad and overdone to die alone!  I am considering abandoning the concept of this being my online journal and just quoting MSN chat.

Noire Bettie says: Wow. I totally voted for you. Jennifer says: Me too! Jennifer says: Someone told me it was wrong of me--I shoulda voted for Bush. I said, "Hey- I'm not in Florida, now am I?" Noire Bettie says: You are very witty, Mr. Gore. Jennifer says: I am. Doesn't come off so much on camera, though, does it? Noire Bettie says: Say, do you get teased a lot for your name? Like, by horror fans, maybe? Jennifer says: Sometimes. Mostly I get teased for marrying Tipper. Jennifer says: I try to tell those fuckers, er, I mean my constituents, that she was a real babe back in her day. And she's not as uptight as she comes off. I hear her dancing around singing "411 is a joke in your town" ALL THE TIME! She LOVES Public Enemy.

      Fuck it.  I think I'll have a cigarette today.  Got this from the boy: Also: I love you horribly, and I don't want you to get too down today.  So when you go for your walk, I strongly suggest you take the no-incline Santa Monica walk, so you can smile at all the sculpted and chiseled queens and their dogs...  Take a few bucks and buy yourself a fruit smoothy or some yogurt, seriously.

      You know, with all the media focusing on memorials and rememberances and whatnot, and the code orange the country is in today, and the fact that the sun is shining and it's an absolutely gorgeous day, I am having some difficulty not being sad as hell.  I would really like to  not  think about last year on this date, but I woke up and looked out the window and it was so beautiful that I turned on the radio to find out if the rest of the country was still there.  This is, after all, LA.  We'd keep going anyway.  In other news, Sick Boy and I had another fight about sex, based on another misunderstanding.  I have got to figure out how to avoid these if I want to keep getting laid - though really, the sex we have after these horrible misunderstandings is phenomenal.  I wish he wasn't at work.  Sex aside, I am really quite dependant on him and cannot deal with him being away on such a sad day.

      We tried to watch the commentary from  Waiting For Guffman  last night, but it was dreadfully dull.  In fact, I highly recommend it to anyone who is currently recording commentary for a DVD and would like a lesson in  how not to do it.   For everyone else, I say this: it's like watching the movie with interruptions.  Honestly, they (Christopher Guest and Eugene Levy) speak during perhaps half of the movie, and most of what they have to say could be found in the credits.   "This is Matt Keesler..."   No kidding!  So we watched the commentary for  The Dead Hate the Living  instead.  Brilliant!  A bunch of kids drinking beer and laughing at their own movie.  And they even admit that  absolutely everything in the movie  is a "tribute" - or, in layman's terms, rip-off - to either a classic horror movie, a director, an actor, a special-effects company, or Tom Savini.

      So, I had a cigarette on Saturday.    OK, as long as I'm being honest here, I had two and a half.   Technically.   The first one I broke the filter off of  while I was smoking it , and wound up chewing rather than smoking.  The second (which was the "half") was Sick Boy's (he strayed too!) and I just had a drag or two, and the third was the only one I actually smoked properly.  In my defense, I was drunk.  And stoned.  And I haven't felt any urge to go back to smoking since.

      Last night I dreamt | That somebody loved me...  And it wasn't my boyfriend, either.  It was someone who looked, in fact, remarkably like Ty from  Trading Spaces.   *sigh*  It was lovely.  Alas, most of the dream was taken up with realistic, non-Sex stuff, but still... *sigh*  Just for the record, in the dream Sick Boy and I had broken up, amiably, and I was pursuing a  meaningful relationship  with Hottie Who Looked Like Ty.

      It's Friday.  I think I've gained about six pounds since Saturday, which evens out to a pound a day.  If I don't start smoking again, I will eat myself out of house and home - and not fit in my bed anymore.  Oh dear.

      I haven't had a cigarette in five days.  I feel like crap.  Actually, that's a lie.  I feel fantastic, but I  really  want one.  We watched  Waiting For Guffman  last night.  It was very funny, but I think I preferred  Best In Show .  Eh.  It's nice to be in the minority there, I think.  Now I just have to watch  This Is Spinal Tap , like a good little Gen Y-er.

      Remember how I said everyone I know is getting married?  Well, now a friend has filed for divorce.  I'm trying to talk myself into the idea that this should make me feel better.  It isn't working.    I know that they will be happier not being married, but divorces are sad.

      Your wish is my command, Jennifer.  You  urlLink slut .  So, a few months ago Will had this dream.  As per usual, it was about vampires, or something.  (I say  usual , but I should clarify that usually he dreams about vampires in conjunction with soldiers.  I don't remember if there were soldiers.  It wasn't  my  dream.)  Anyway, that was a Friday night.  Saturday morning he told me about the dream while we were lying in bed, playing the Game of Wills, in which we hold out to make the other one get up first.  Whoever gives in (usually because of a need to use the potty) has to make the coffee.  Anyway, I wasn't terribly awake yet, but his description of the dream gave me all sorts of fabulous mental images, and we started brainstorming about story ideas.  I took some notes and made a basic outline for a  different  vampire story.  The original plan was that I would write it as a story, and give it over to him to write as a screenplay.  Time passed, as it is so prone to doing.  Yesterday Jenn (not Jennifer) came over and we watched the  Blade II  DVD.  It was very cool, and I want to have Guillermo del Toro's fat, geeky babies.  While watching, I started to think about my story again, and wrote out a bit of dialogue, longhand.  After Jenn left for work, I sat down at the computer while Will did some work on his soldiers (1:6 scale, and it was work, not play) and typed out what I'd written, with some additions.  Then I spent a few hours mulling over ideas and going insane like I always do when inspiration strikes.  I took a break to watch  Angel , which was fantastic, and then talked ideas over with Will, who loves what I've written so far.  Unfortunately, he is such a genre junkie that his input was overwhelming.  It's now early morning.  I need a shower, milk, and smokes, but I'm sitting at my computer, trying to write and feeling generally full of myself.  It's Will's fault - he predicted that I'll become "that screenwriter" that the genre junkies have all been waiting for, the one who will write a "different and important" genre movie.  If I do, it will only be due to my absolute lack of knowledge of the genre.  I figure I don't have to follow the "rules," because I don't know what they are.  Yay for me!

      I have this book of matches from Ralphs which I am using to light my cigarettes, because I don't know where I put my lighter.  Every time I light one, the end flies off, aflame, and tries to set me and/or my apartment on fire.  I think I ought to either stop smoking or find the Zippo.

       Weatherman repeats himself!  Film at eleven.   I understand that the news must be repeated for people who join on the half hour.  I started watching at 5:00 - it's no wonder that the weather, at the very least, would be repeated at 5:30 and 6:00.  Information about the sniper suspects was also repeated, with no updates.  I understand, I do!  But why, oh why, must they start advertising news items "coming up next" at 5:00 and not run the stories until after 6:00?  I want to know about the conjoined twins!  I do!  And the abusive babysitter!  This is Important News.  Oh, nevermind.  I'm going to watch  The Royal Tenenbaums  again.

      Dear "H,"  How am I doing?  I'll tell you how I'm doing.  I want my sunglasses, my mail, the  Buffy  tapes you were supposed to copy for me, as well as the 4 months superfluous rent I paid you, back.  I want the time and effort I put into this friendship back.  And, while I'm at it, I'd like for you to stop forwarding virus warnings to me.  Every single one so far has been a hoax.  Didn't I show you how to use  urlLink google ?  Thanks for asking.  But I could do without your pathetic gestures.

       me:  I feel really bad (still) about Thanksgiving.  I hope your parents aren't angry.  I know they'll be disappointed, but I really hope they have the sense to understand.   my boyfriend (who is perfect):  sweetie, you have no reason to feel bad.  It isn't like I made a decision: "Family or Bettie".  That decision didn't really need to be made.  It was common sense, which is probably why it took me so long to realize it was the right thing to do [tongue icon]... And I don't say that like: "I choose you over mi familia" but like... Ack.  Brain fart.   Me:  You didn't choose me  over  your family.  You chose me  as  your family, and the rest of your family is inconveniently located.   Him:  Wow.   Me:  Did I get it right?   Him:  Totally.

      I'm bored and hungry, and there's a little kid in the hallway of my apartment building screaming her head off.  I am sick to death of pop-up ads that I don't notice.  It inevitably occurs when I am staring at the keyboard (as I do when I type) and I don't realize until 10 sentences later that nothing I've typed has actually gone through.  I'm afraid that Jamie didn't like my synopsis of  Help , because I haven't heard back from her.  Did I mention I'm hungry?  I knew I should have bought those sun chips that were talking to me at the store earlier.

      I'm in an excellent mood, for no discernable reason.  I suppose it  could  be due to the huge bowl of cereal I ate, but I doubt it.  It could also be due to...no, I can't actually think of anything specific.    I blame Phoebe.   Edit  On second thought, while I'm certain that Phoebe and the cereal contributed, I think Katherine's present that arrived today may have also had something to do with it.

      Damn it.  I psyched myself up.  I went over in my head a million times the pros and cons.  I was all prepared to do it, to deal with the ick factor, and to just get it all over with.  I even ran through some fights with Mary in my head, just to prepare myself should it come to that.  Now it looks like we can't afford to fly me to Pittsburgh.  Which means one of a few possibilities.  Either he goes alone, and his parents get the satisfaction of knowing that their son comes when he's called (even though I know it's because he wants to see them, and his  sister ), neither of us go (he doesn't get to see his sister), or we go further into debt so that he can see his family and I can prove a point.  I liked it better when I planned it out before looking into plane fares.

      Dear Will's Mom,  Your manipulations have got to stop.  Will isn't falling for them, just hurt by them.  It is your choice to not accept me, but the fact is that I am part of your son's life, and have been for five years.  He told you in  April  that he wouldn't be coming home for Christmas.  He told you that it was because he was spending the holidays with me.  To ask him, repeatedly, if he is coming home is just mean at this point.  You are only setting him up to have to either hurt you (again) by choosing me or hurt me (and himself) by changing his mind.  He is 27 years old and can make up his own mind.  There is no call for you to torture him about it.  I love that you love and like your son so much that you want him home for the holidays.  I really do.  But I am starting to despise you for your methods of trying to get him there, and I am afraid that he will too.  Please - this is for your own sake - fuck off.

I am inviting all of you, and if anyone changes plans because of anyone else, I am uninviting  everyone  and sulking forever.  Also, I wouldn't have said anything if it weren't for the fact that I value all of your friendships.  So stop being so paranoid.  Jen, this means you.

      It's just irresponsible, it is.  Because it is after midnight, my boyfriend is asleep across the room, and I'm in pajamas, I am using google as my sole resource for the information I need to find.  Ahem.  What I mean is, I am using the websites that I find through google searches.  It would be futile to only use google.  Anyway, I came up with an idea for a screenplay on the drive back from CassyLee's (I love you Cassy!  I had a fantastic time!) and it requires some dated "accessories."  Because I am a picky perfectionist in addition to a World-Class procrastinator, I feel it necessary to note in the screenplay what time of telephone my heroine has in her bedroom.  This is utterly ridiculous unless I am going to direct the picture  and  be its researcher and props mistress, but...well, there you go.  I am also a Master of the ridiculous.  In my hunting, I have come to a conclusion: People with websites featuring Stromberg Carlson, ITT, Northern Electric and Western Electric princess phones  suck .  Is it really that hard to include a date?  I want a 1957 telephone, and none of the pictures of different styles are dated.  I did find out that the pre-1962 version had an external ringer (they had not invented one small enough to fit inside the phone), which might make me inclined to use a different phone - but there are  no pictures .  Damn it.

      Speaking of  Buffy the Vampire Slayer 's bottle blonde vamp:  Bettie says: Fucking Spike Lickers.  You know, I like Spike, but they're all killing it for me.  Tina says: huh?  Bettie says: The Defenders of Spike on the WD.  Tina says: I knew who you meant (more or less) but not which post set you off  Bettie says: Eh - I keep finding myself drawn into the Spike v. Angel thread.  Tina says: oh....I've avoided that    Bettie says: Good on you.  You'll stay sane longer than I.  Tina says: well, with a title like "Why Angel is 10X the man Spike is", I could see where it was going  Bettie says: *sigh* You're so much wiser than I.  Tina says: I love spike  Tina says: I love [name deleted]  Tina says: I have no desire to crawl into that particular minefield, though    Bettie says: I love Spike too.  But I see no reason to defend him.  Tina says: you know, on the one hand, I love the disection of the show at WD...it's part of what drew me...but when it goes on ad nauseum and the arguments are essentially reduced to "You're stupid!"  No, YOU'RE stupid!"...well, enough already.  Just watch the damned show    Bettie says: Absolutely agree.  Tina says: I mean, I agree that Buffy treated Spike abysmally last year...I also agree it was a fucked up relationship...and the "attempted rape" scene was so out of character, they had to contrive a reason why Spike could even momentarily overwhelm Buffy and even still, people have to clamor and conjecture to come up with explanations for it on both sides (an indication to me that the writer's did a really shitty job--when the fans have to pull conjecture out of thin air to explain completely out of character behavior)  Bettie says: But the fans will do that anyway.  Tina says: But what's done is done...can we at least get halfway into the season before we decide "this sucks" and "so and so is STILL a bitch/a whining prat/etc"  Bettie says: At least people seem to be giving Dawn a chance this year.  I'm not one to defend the characters (as you well know) but I always found her to be portrayed as realistically as is possible with a character that is formed from pure energy and just thrown into the mix.  Tina says: true....I got tired of the screetching, but at least they stopped that    And yeah, they do seem to be giving her more of a fair shake    Tina says: Do you realize that we're talking on topic...in msn??  Tina says: *claps hand to side of head*  Bettie says: Shit happens.  I'm only on my third cup of coffee.

      Dear "Centennial" Card,  Thank you for your generous offer to help me rebuild my credit.  However, you might want to rethink the unsolicited email route you've chosen to acquire my business through.  I inadvertantly deleted your email, and had to dig through my Yahoo "trash can" to find said generous offer.  Before giving you my business (and, I assume, my money), I have a few questions:   Re: your use of the word "Centennial" in your business name: Are you referring to our nation's centennial?  If so, does this mean that your card has been around since 1976?  That's amazing!  I didn't know there were credit cards back then.  Of course, I am only 24, so that was "before my time."   Re: my credit: Is it actually possible to rebuild something that never really existed?  I failed my very first credit check ever, and have had to pay cash or not purchase every expensive item I own (the computer that makes it possible for you to email me, for example).  I have student loans and a bank account, but the former are outstanding and probably in default, and the latter overdrawn.  I assure you that I only have them in the first place due to the government's desire to see all Americans in debt.     I have a job, but I am paid "under the table," which I am fairly certain is illegal.  Will this affect my standing with your organization?  I think that about covers it!  I look forward to your response, and a future business partnership.  love, Bettie Black  p.s. "Bettie Black" is a pseudonym.  That doesn't bother you, does it?  I'm sure she has far better credit than I do.

      Dear Fox Network Executives,  While I realize that you finance  Firefly  and can therefore do anything you jolly well please with it, I would greatly appreciate if you would be a little bit less blatantly obvious about trying to kill it.  Running episodes out of order, never airing the pilot, airing the show on Friday night, preempting the third episode for a baseball game - all of these infractions might not, individually, be a big deal.  However, when one factors in the fact that not only have they all occurred in the  three weeks  that the show has been running but there has also been next to no advertising, and you've got a fairly obvious fix.   I'm onto you.   Please take any and all action necessary to keep  Firefly  on the air.  Yours, BettiePie

      So, I've gained weight since I got to Los Angeles.  About 15 pounds, I think.  Not a big deal, though occasionally I am very self conscious about it.  The real problem is my clothing.  None of my pants (trousers) fit me, and there is nothing that makes a girl feel fat faster than a pair of pants, previously loose, not buttoning.  So on Saturday Will took me shopping.  We couldn't really afford it, but I can hardly go around with no pants on.  So I tried on several trousers that just made my thighs and hips look chunky.  One pair of chinos fit nicely, and I got them, and a full-length skirt, and a sweater.  I wore the sweater and skirt all weekend.  They're  gorgeous  and more importantly, I feel sexy in them.  That hasn't happened lately in any of my old clothes.

      I'm a  freak !  My eyelid is swollen to absurd proportions, as is a small portion of my earlobe, and I can find no explanation!  Also, I am stubbornly refusing to go to the ER, as I am in no pain whatsoever.  Plus, I'm missing work in case it is something bad, because, you know, infant.  Will was right.  I'm bored.  Maybe I  should  go to the hospital.

       Hi, my name is  [deleted]  and I'm a big fat moron.  I've decided to make myself the Martyr of the Day.  I'm going to paint a picture in which there is no possible way to perceive me as anything but the wronged party, and ask for opinions from people who weren't involved.  I wonder who they'll side with?   What an idiot.

      I spent five hours cooking today.  I made the  World's Best  Thanksgiving dinner.  I am now sitting in my chair, fat and bloated, awaiting Sainthood.  Oh, also: we watched the animated  Lord of the Rings.   If Ralph Bakshi were still alive, I'd have a thing or two to tell him about making a decent movie.  Maybe I shall, in a later entry.  Right now, I am trying to will myself to have enough room for one more slice of pie.

      This morning on the way to work (or it might have been yesterday morning - they all lump together in my mind) I saw a van for a company with the most offensive name I have  ever  seen: SIDS Air Conditioning.  SIDS!  What were they thinking?  This afternoon on the way home I saw a van with the best company name/logo  EVER : TNT Electric.  "Let us look into your shorts."  So now I'm home, and Will is braving day-before-Thanksgiving shoppers to pick up wine and butter (and anything else he wants) while I lazily troll the internet.  He's the best.  I'm so incredibly happy, because I get five whole days with him and neither of us has to go anywhere.  I mean, we have a lunch date on Friday, and we might go down to Huntington Beach on Saturday to see Cassie, and I think we have plans on Sunday, but we'll be  together  the whole time.  *sigh*

      So we started our Christmas shopping today.  We bought...cards.  And one book.  Oh!  And a CD of an old radio version of  A Christmas Carol  with Orson Wells.  That was for us.  We also looked around World Market and I showed Will everything I want.  Then I took Will to The Buzz Stop and London (that is  so  not his real name) chemically straightened his hair.  Straightened it!  Poor Will.  All of his friends are going to call him a girl now.  It looks lovely, though.  It's still kind of wavy, but my goodness!  What a difference.  I can run my fingers through it without getting stuck.  When we got home, we went to Amazon to look for all the stuff we couldn't find at the bookstore.  Of course, they had it all.  I love Amazon.  Then Will and Elliot had a bitchfight on MSN.  I saved the transcript, and will forward it to the person with the best bribe.  It's hilarious!  In other news, I am still desperately in love with Sean Bean.  I have come to terms with our love never leaving my living room, as I have no intention of ever getting involved with a man who's been divorced more than twice.  (Bruce Campbell, that makes you eligible!)  Damn it to hell.  Oh well - 25 days until  The Two Towers , which, while notably devoid of Boromir, ought to have some nice gay hobbits.

      Damn it.  Have just discovered Sean Bean is 43 and 3 times divorced.  This does not bode well for our future together.  Age, of course, isn't a huge issue, though his daughters might not agree about that.  Darn.  Must check into possible younger brothers who are decent with a sword (as that is one of his top selling points).

      My head hurts.  Too much staring at screens today.  I rewatched  Him  to synopsize (is that a word?) it for  urlLink Buffyguide , then we watched the first half of  The Fellowship of the Ring  with director/writer commentary, and the second half (which I fell asleep during on Thursday) without.  I've never read the books.  I have almost no idea what's going to happen.    I am so excited.      Boromir only pretended to die, though, right?  RIGHT?  My god, he's delicious.

      I'm really confused.  Hence, this entry will probably be fairly confusing.  This is  my  weblog, though, so I don't care.  I will not name names or specifics.  This is partly because I don't think that would be fair to the parties involved, partly because too many people already are involved who shouldn't be, and partly because there is a lot of misinformation going around, and I may be guilty of believing some of it.  It is also because I can do whatever I want, and I don't want to name names.  This is about my feelings and nothing else.  My inclination is to simply say, "Stop.  Just stop."  I'd like to leave it at that.  But that is neither realistic nor a complete expression of what I want.  So, to expand a bit: Could everyone just step back for a minute?  Think.  No, really think.  Are you hurting anyone?  Are you doing so in a way that is unnecessary?  Stop.  No, don't do anything detrimental to your own happiness in order to avoid hurting other people.  Just think.  Use reason - reason! - to determine what secrets should be kept.  Use common sense.  And for god's sake, if you fucked up, apologize.  I've said before that I don't want to be put in the middle.  This is still true.  However, sometimes it is inevitable.  If I am automatically in the middle (i.e. two of my friends decide not to be friends with each other) don't avoid me and keep me in the dark about it.  I'm already in the middle, I should at least know what's going on.  I'm not one to judge my friends, but it's awfully helpful to have a fucking clue what's going on so that I don't put my foot in my mouth.  I'm not terribly flexible.  [tongue]  Moreover, I'm sick of my feelings being spared.  It just gives me a feeling of doom -  one of these days, these people will treat me like shit and I will have had no warning.   Except, you know, my paranoia/intuition.  I'm not a mindreader, so I tend to assume paranoia until it's too late.  Everyone, stop being selfish.  That's less of a non-sequitur than I'd like it to be.  ********  Changing the subject: We got the extended DVD of  The Fellowship of the Ring  yesterday.  Yay!!!

      The following is, I believe, the thought process a  normal  person would have.  Let it be noted that I am not a normal person.    Normal person (NP) gains weight.  Say, 15 pounds or so.  NP's pants do not fit.  NP's boyfriend is bigger than NP.  NP's boyfriend's pants were, in the past, absurdly large for NP.  NP realizes that it would be fairly logical to try boyfriend's pants on and see how they fit now.   I've been heavier for months, I only tried Will's pants on today when I was headed to the store and realized that my pants (the only ones that fit) had no pockets.  D'oh!

      bettie says: You know what pisses me off? Tina says: what? bettie says: My own pet peeves. Tina says: well, yeah, that would do it bettie says: I ran to the bathroom just now, to pee.  I didn't bother turning on the light, because I'm fairly comfortable with the layout of the room.  I used the last of the toilet paper.  I didn't want to replace the roll!  But I had to, because if anyone else had left an empty roll, I'd have gotten peeved.  So I had to change the roll in the dark.   Tina says: how much stuff did you bump into? bettie says: Not much, but fumbling about under the sink for the package of toilet paper was a bit awkward in the dark. Tina says: I know what you mean   Tina says: of course, it beats having to yell for someone to bring you another roll (or worse, there not being anyone home to bring you another roll)

      Note to self: Buy some film and a fucking flash for your camera.  Preferably yesterday.  It was Halloween last night.  I love Halloween.  It seems like every year I love it more.  I think this is due to Will's infectious enthusiasm.    Yesterday morning we got up at the crack of dawn (quarter to eight, actually), and Will showered.  I opened the packages of the 'theatre' makeup I'd bought for 50 cents apiece at the drug store.  He put on his (well rumpled) suit, and I chose a tie.  By happy coincidence, it was a tie that Harriet had chewed the end of.  Will sat down on the kitchen stool (it's red!  I love it) and I took my red lipliner and ran it over a flame.  He looked frightened, moreso when I said, "Close your eyes."  I lined his eyes very lightly with the red, then took black grease paint and lightly bruised the area around his eyes.  After some deliberation, it was decided that this would include his eyelids.  I should have mentioned that before I did this, I did his hair.  I blowdried it, which made it really unmanageable.  Perfect.  I added some pomade, basically "trying" to style it like he usually does.  Anyway, back to his face.  He hadn't shaved in 2 days, so the streaky, light coating of white greasepaint had the exact effect I'd hoped for, and then some.   My boyfriend is* a zombie.   *was (he got better.)

      Let's just say, for argument's sake, that I've got it in my head to write a (mostly non-fiction) book about relationships.  (That would be just about the broadest generalization humanly possible of the subject matter, but I am being purposely vague.)  So, let's say I'm working on some ideas for this book, and I've decided that I probably should do some sort of survey.  Would you be willing to answer questions and possibly be quoted?

       A story about legwarmers, as promised.   So, Kevin McKenzie is the current (creative) director of American Ballet Theater.  The position was previously occupied by Michail Barishnikov, for those of you keeping score at home.  My father has been the principal timpanist in the NYC orchestra for about 26 years, and I've been to the ballet pretty much every spring since.  (ABT is at the Met Opera House for 2 months every spring.  The rest of the year, they tour and play with local orchestras.)  In 1982 or thereabouts, when McKenzie was still just a lowly (principal) dancer with the company, PBS broadcast a performance of Romeo and Juliet live from (I think) the Met.  Live.  During the third act, ol' Kevin pranced onstage still wearing his legwarmers.   Live on television!   He apparently never got over the embarrassment.  Poor slob.  He did, however, exact his revenge on the world by re-choreographing The Nutcracker, and making its target audience the Ballet-Illiterate Retards of the world.  Bastard.

       urlLink My evil twin   I've realized that my life would be much more interesting if I did one or more of the following:   Left the house more often.  Lived closer to Katherine.  Drank more.  Took over the world.  It's doubtful that any of these things will happen (at least soon), but I can dream.  My boyfriend is sleeping, a much-needed sleep after a bottle of Maker's Mark and a terrible awakening at 6:00 this morning.  He had a nightmare, but tonight I have sworn to protect him in dream-land.  For now, Kudsai is guarding him while he sleeps, but I will find him if he needs me.  I promised.  I also promised to kill anyone who tried to stop me, and to make it good and bloody for cinematic value.  My life isn't so bad.

      I have come to the conclusion that the one thing guaranteed to make me happy all of the time will be swing dancing.  On a regular basis, of course.  This means, of course, that I have to get Will to learn.  He isn't unwilling, and in fact we've taken lessons in the past - he just has some sort of learning block when it comes to dancing, which is weird, because he's usually very good at picking things up, and quick too.  We're looking for a new apartment.  I didn't call the places in Los Feliz or Silver Lake, because of the commute he'd have to work, but now I'm wishing I had.  At least 2 of the buildings were quite close to The Derby, one of them practically across the street, and I'm almost positive they still have free swing lessons once a week.  Possibly more.  Besides, I've never been there, and it would be less hassle if we could walk.  I have also come to the conclusion that I need a digital camera, ASAP.

      Dear Tolkien fans,  Kindly take your fingers out of your butts/noses (delete as applicable) and repeat after me:   It's a movie.

Thank you.

       It's days like these* that I wish I had a shotgun.   * yesterday   So, I got locked in the bathroom on Tuesday morning.  I feel that it is of great import to note, from the start, that there  is no lock  on our bathroom door, but merely a sticky latch.  Occasionally the handle is difficult to turn.  Yesterday morning I took a shower with the door firmly shut, the heat lamp on, and the water fairly hot.  I got out, dried myself off, put lotion on my hands and face, and opened the door.  Ahh.  Right.  I  tried  to open the door.   The handle didn't turn.  Assuming that my hands were simply too moist from the steam and the lotion, I grabbed a towel and tried to open the door holding it around the knob.  Nothing.  I called to Will, who tried to open the door from the outside.  No good.  Worried that Will (and possibly I) would panic, I began fiddling with the knob, trying to figure out how to take it apart.  There was no obvious solution, as there were no screws or in fact anything that one might normally find on a doorknob that would enable one to take it apart.  By sheer luck, I found the small slit on the side of the knob which, when my nail file was inserted, released the catch and enabled me to take the actual knob off.  I fiddled with the insides, hoping to force the latch.  Nada.  I attempted to explain to Will how to take the knob off on his side.  I had him pass me a screwdriver under the door, and took apart the rest of my side of the knob.  The latch remained firmly stuck, even after Will took off his side of the knob.  I think the thing was made of titanium, or some such material.    In past experience, I've found it possible to force even a locked door to open if you insert a flathead screwdriver between the door and the jamb and wedge it into the latch, using your body and the tork of the screwdriver for leverage.  Unfortunately, this has to be done from the outside, which is the side of the latch with the 45 degree angle.  The outside of our bathroom door has molding around the jamb, which made it impossible to insert anything, let alone a screwdriver, and get it anywhere near the latch.  So there I was, naked, stuck in the bathroom, with a small hole through which I could see my boyfriend, and both of us late for work.  I decided, naturally, to take apart the hinges.  There are (were) two, and as I'm sure you know hinges merely rest together and are held in place by a long bolt.  Using my screwdriver and a wrench that Will slid under the door, I managed to extract the bolt from the bottom hinge with very little trouble.  The top one proved a challenge, though, as it was above my head and the only thing in the bathroom upon which to stand is the toilet - across the room.  After much sweating and cursing, I did it, though.  I am very strong.   With both bolts removed, I climbed back into the bathtub and hid behind the plexiglass door while Will used his body weight to force the door open.  He managed, with his shoulder, to lossen the top half of the door, but the bottom hinge, painted over several dozen times, held firm.  I told him how high it was off the ground, and he started kicking.  Suffice it to say, I got out, but the door is now in two rather large pieces, having broken in half horizontally at approximately the height of the damn latch.  Incidentally, the latch moves smoothly now that it is nowhere near the doorjamb.  There were other reasons for wanting a shotgun, all of which involve  the mall , but I'll leave you to draw your own conclusions.

      Well, I am both shocked and appalled.  We watched  Reign of Fire  last night.  I was reading when Will started it, but put my book down for the intro, and again (for the duration of the film) when Christian Bale first took off his shirt.  I'm  very shallow.  But that isn't what shocked me.  What shocked (and appalled) me is that this movie has  no right  to be any good, but it was.  I really enjoyed it!  It was funny, fairly well-paced, not too cheesy, and had cool dragons.  Backing up a bit: We decided to try out NetFlix.  Our first batch of DVDs arrived on, I think, Thursday.  We didn't watch any that night, as it was Sean "Baby" Smith's birthday, or Friday, as we were going to the Kodak to see  The Nutcracker  (more on that later).  Saturday evening, after a very long nap, Will asked if I'd like to give  Brave Two Zero  a shot.  Gee, watch Sean Bean as an SAS operative?  I don't know... Unfortunately, the movie was a very good example of how  not  to tell a story.  It had tons and tons of potential, but just was really crummy.  Oh well - it had a nice shot of Mr. Bean's ass.  When it was over, I was pretty much ready for bed, but Will wanted to watch another movie to get the bad taste out of his mouth, so to speak.  I told him to watch  Dagon , as I knew it was based on H.P. Lovecraft stories, and have not been impressed with any of the "interpretations" I've seen so far (namely  The Haunted Palace ).  He was very excited about the movie, though, as he'd seen an internet teaser for it that was excellent.  He wanted to show me the trailer on the DVD so that I'd know why he was looking forward to the movie so much.  Let's just say that the trailer blew, and leave it at that.  He was almost prepared to skip watching the movie, but I made him start it so that he could see if it was worth the original trailer he'd seen.  Well, the movie was excellent.  I just might brave the reading of some Lovecraft one of these days.  Backing up again:  Friday night.  I got dressed up real pretty and entered the Kodak Theater on my sweetheart's arm.  We hung about in the lobby for a few minutes, checked out the facilities, and then were ushered to our seats.  We were in about the tenth row, a bit to the right.  I was very excited, as it was an American Ballet Theater performance.  My father's been in their orchestra (the NYC one, not the one that played at this performance) for 20-some years (since before I was born, which I think would make it 26) and I've been to more ballets than I could ever dream of trying to count.  We sat waiting for the lights to go down and talked about our childhoods in theater - his father was the director of the National Symphony.  We have so many memories that are of nearly identical experiences, but are from opposite viewpoints.  It was really neat.  Then the house got dark, and the conductor came into the pit.  Had I known it was Charles Barker, or ever seen Kevin McKensie's choreography before, there's a good chance someone else would have had our seats.  I truly had a wonderful time, but my god!  No one has tried this hard to ruin Christmas since The Grinch, and Scrooge before him.  As my dad, said, Kevin McKensie just never got over the leg warmers.  (Full review and explanation of final comment to come, I promise.)  Up to speed: It's Monday.  It's very cold, and I'm doing this instead of the cleaning and wrapping and addressing I should be doing.  I suck.

      On Sunday we watched  The Hobbit .  I've been calling myself "my precious" ever since, and I think it's giving Will the heeby-jeebies.  Yesterday, our large styrofoam crate of steaks and other goodies arrived from Omaha.  We put all the foodstuffs away and then poured water into the crate to make the dry ice turn into scary fog.  It was  wizard .  When we got bored with that, we put the remainder of the dry ice into the toilet and Will pissed on it.  This was great fun until  I  had to pee.  Then it was a rush to drench the stuff in water and make it evaporate so it wouldn't freeze my hoo-ha.  Today I went to work for the first time in two weeks.  Tiny Owen is sick again, and it was quite frightening to see his little body convulse when he coughed.  He turned bright red and looked all panicked - and who wouldn't?  Poor thing.  Then he fell asleep, and I put him down, but he kept trying to roll onto his tummy, which frightened me even more.  I still haven't written my Christmas cards, or sent a certain package overseas.  The cards might arrive in time, but someone's present is going to be late.  Had a very funny discussion with Cassy about Christmas trees and Detroit, and an equally funny one with Phoebe about...a thing that I can't name because I used her real name.  Oops.  In conclusion, I hate Ben Stiller.

      I must still be sick.  Last night after I fell asleep, Will got back up to read his book, which he loves more than me.  At some point, I started talking to him in my sleep, apparently telling him the same incomprehensible thing over and over again.  He thought it sounded like I was saying something about him being cursed, and asked.  I laughed, said, "Not  cursed , silly," and repeated whatever I'd been saying yet again.  I'm retarded even in my sleep.  And also funny.  Heehee.  Someone just made the Most Pointless WD Post of the day.  It made me giggle.  To paraphrase: "Vampires are evil and murder people, but they're keeping the population down!"  Only less articulate.  I am so easily amused.

      Have discovered that my mother reads my blog.  Hi mom!  Would like to state on record that I do not smoke, drink, have sex, or do any drugs whatsoever.  In other news, I was thinking yesterday about an old friend who I haven't seen in ages.  Almost emailed her, but thought better of it, since I was feeling rather incoherant.  Today, she had re-registered at the Watcher's Diary.  Joy!  We've been PMing all day.  There's a new episode of Firefly tonight.  I'm very excited.  I love, love, love this show.  I just know Fox is going to cancel it, for that very reason, so I am savoring every minute of it that I can.  In conclusion, I love the  Buffy  fans, even if they are very stupid sometimes.

      Yesterday Will came home from work and informed me that I would not be getting the entire Sharpe series for Christmas.  Now, please note that I didn't ask for it.  I've never even seen it.  It's a 10-part series about Richard Sharpe, of Sharpe's Rifles, as played by Sean Bean.  I'd love to see it, and not just because I want to have hot monkey sex with Mr. Bean.  My boyfriend is so sweet.  Of course, he's right in thinking that $270 is far too much to spend on me.  My goodness, for twice that I could go to England.  Which I would in no way be doing in order to see Macbeth.  Nope, not at all.  In other news, I will from now on be referring to Jamie as Princess Jamie.  She figured out what was wrong with my computer, even though it wasn't really her problem at all.  Now I just have to wade through all of the crap that Microsoft thinks I should download and identify the updates that I actually need.

       Well, that proves it.  They're out to get me.   I was over at  urlLink CHUD , poking around for their review of  Equilibrium , which is supposed to be fabulous but I know nothing about excepting the cast.  So, I find the review, and I start reading.  The first two pictures are of Christian Bale, which is fine - he has first billing, and is presumably in most of the movie.  So I keep reading.  I scroll down.  More pictures.  A book.  Christian Bale.  Christian Bale.  Christian Bale.   Where is Sean Bean?   This is  so  unfair.

      Despite some conflict and a bit of panic, I've had a lovely weekend.  Yesterday as Will and I were finishing our coffee and getting ready to go down to see Cassie, it started to rain.  Heavy, loud, fierce rain, and the sun shining the whole time.  Due to the fact that Angelinos cannot drive in inclimate weather, we cancelled the trip and just spent a lazy afternoon, reading, playing on the computer, napping.  I didn't get a rainbow, though.  I'd write to my congressman if I knew who he was.  And if I were a California resident.  I don't think I'm technically an anywhere resident.  Hmm.  Must fix that.  Today we were going to have lunch with Jenn's friends Ludic and Amy, but they cancelled, so Jenn came over and we had a research party.  We've been looking at Deadlands books all day, with a brief hiatus to watch  Big Trouble in Little China , and Will and I may have created the Best Character Ever.  Will has the coolest dreams on earth.  I also did some online Christmas shopping, which went well except that I fucked up my Amazon orders and wound up having to pay more shipping than I should have (which would have been none).  Since fixing my mistake did mean buying a lower-priced item, I suppose I still came out ahead, but only if I over-rationalize and under-think the matter.  Now the weekend is over, and tomorrow Will has to go back to work.  Sometimes I hate holidays, because they end.

      Tomorrow morning I will pack my  sweet baby  computer into its boxes and move it to the new place.  I may be offline for several days.  Here's something I wrote earlier.  It makes me look so pathetic that you may not even miss me.   I should really know better.   I turned the television on this afternoon to provide background noise while I packed.  Despite the DVDs that I left unpacked for this very purpose, I decided to flip through the local stations first.  All that was on was news and Oprah.  One of Oprah's guests was Maya Angelou, so I stupidly left the show on.  Today's topic was the new display at the Museum of Tolerance ([eyebrow]) which features rooms of memories of Maya Angelou's, Billy Crystal's, Carlos Santana's, and the manager of the Yankees' family histories (I obviously cannot remember the latter's name, and honestly, he could be the manager of the  Mets ).  Interesting stuff, and it reminded me that I've been meaning to try to find my family's geneology.  My mum's side of the family should be easy, as an aunt has already done it, and all I'd need to trace is my grandpa's family.  My dad's side of the family will be... interesting , considering that they don't even know if the family name is Barrant i  or Barrant e , or whether we're Sicilian, Spanish, or Moorish.  (The family is from Sicily, but who knows.)  Anyway.  Back to Oprah.  One of her guests was a writer, whose name I also forget (he is a poet and the screenwriter of Smoke Signals), who is a native American whose grandfather died when his father was six.  In tracing his geneology, he discovered that his grandfather was a decorated soldier, but the medals had been lost.  After he told his story, and explained that he was trying to have the medals replaced for his father, so that his father could make peace with  his  father, Oprah called out several United States military officers (I am ashamed to say that I don't know what branch.  I suspect Army.  I also don't know the officers' ranks), who presented him with replacements for his grandfather's awards.  About a dozen medals and 2 plaques.  I was bawling like a baby.  No.  Babies don't cry like this.  They have more dignity.  I've learned my lesson about daytime TV.  Now that Days of Our Lives sucks, I shouldn't watch anything before 6:00 - possibly 8:00 - in the evening.  (Of course I mean after 10:00 am - Regis and Kelly crack me up.)  Could I possibly have incuded more parenthetical statements in this entry?  (I don't think so.)  (And nevermind the confusing pronouns.  Sorry.)

       The rest of my day in review   I was very tired.  I had a fight with Will.  I had a killer headache, which is probably to blame for the fight.  We brought some stuff over to the new apartment.  I found a roach.  I got really angry about the roach until it occured to me that I lived with roaches for the first 18 years of my life, and know how to kill them.  I decided not to bother making this a list.  I decided to sleep in tomorrow (which probably means that I will wake up at 7:00).  I came online to PM Jenn and Cassie, and haven't gotten around to it yet.  I had long conversations with myself in my head.  I found out that Alan did indeed sell my monkey to someone else.  My lighter ran out of fluid.  We got our new phone number, which will change on Saturday.  I think that's it.  Man, I'm tired.

       My day in review (mid-day)    Refused to get out of bed.  (Obviously changed my mind eventually.)  Put gas in our car.  Picked up keys to new apartment.  Brought Will a Big Mac because I love him.  Went to storage space where most of my stuff (read: books) has been since July, picked up computer boxes, gave notice for mid-February.  (It seems silly to rush to get everything out of the apartment  and  the storage space.)  Went to Koontz's, the best hardware store on earth, and purchased assorted cleaning supplies, bungee cords, et cetera.  Thought of eight billion other items I should have gotten while there.  Came home utterly exhausted despite it barely being mid-afternoon, decided to take an internet break.

      Transcribed from my notebook:  It's 7:00 in the morning.  Sunday.  I woke up just now and discovered that I was crying.  I don't usually cry myself awake.  Last night we went to Max's, which is our favorite bar.  Alan had a new art show up, and we went to see it, and him, and have a drink or two.  As well as three or four giant squids (a specialty of Alan's), there was a new series of paintings: a robot and a monkey.  Not since the Bluebird of Friendliness and Skelaton Lu has Alan painted something that moved me so.  Hell, the Bluebird and Lu  didn't  affect me like this.  One of the paintings is of a monkey, alone, sitting on a grassy hill looking away.  At the top it says "Waiting."  I became entirely smitten and stared across the room at the monkey until Kan, one of Will's co-workers, announced loudly that he was, "buying that one."  I was depressed an anti-social for the rest of the night, coming out of my protective shell only to pry Everwood spoilers out of Sean (who works for the show).  I should, I think, do one of two things.  One, forget the painting (I can always ask Alan for a photograph of it), or two, come up with $200 and fight for that monkey.  Alan and Will have a lot of history - Will should be able to steal my monkey from Kan, right?  But then I think that I'm a terrible person, and anyway Will wouldn't do it, and then thinking  that  makes me feel terrible, and it just keeps going like that.  But shouldn't I have the monkey that can make me cry?

      Dear Jesse Dayton,  Why San Diego?   Why?   Los Angeles loves you.   I  love you.  (Will says that I cannot offer you sex for playing a show here, but we can just keep it quiet, OK?)  ***  I just sent the following to Kirk, who has never read the Lord of the Rings and is concerned about whether Christopher Lee will be in the third movie.  I've read Fellowship and the first half of Two Towers.  (The first half of the book is the Aragorn/Legolas/Gimli/Galdalf/etc half, the second half is Frodo/Sam/Gollum.)  I have just gotten to the part of the book that takes place after the movie ends, so I can assure you that there will be more Christopher Lee, if Peter Jackson doesn't want me to beat him up.  I still like the first movie more, but nothing will ever rival the Helm's Deep battle scene.  Seriously, if anyone ever tops that, I will probably die.  (Will, who has read all three books many times, assures me that the third movie will, indeed, top it.  I'd better start taking my heart medicine NOW.)

You're  Alexander the Great !  Yeah, baby. You were the King of Macedonia, and conqueror of much of the world; you're responsible for the spread of Christianity, as well as Hellenistic society and even the Roman Empire. Your power was feared for thousands of miles around.  And how gay were you. When you'd conquered Persia, you fell in love with a male courtier from that court - scandalous in those days, because the Persians were believed to be uncivilised barbarians.  You were always really in love with your boyhood friend, Hephaestion, and when he died you were grief-stricken to a legendary degree: convinced that he would live on after death, you passed away soon afterwards.    urlLink     urlLink Which Famous Homosexual are  you ?

      I have the best family in the world.  Things are not doing very well in regard to my finances.  I'm not working, and Will, though making a fairly good salary, doesn't really bring home enough money to comfortably pay for two.  The bills are, not to put too fine a point on it, piling up.  My father told me today that his wife Debbie, who he met when I was 17 and married three years later, was paying bills yesterday and turned to him and asked, "What does Annika need?"  She apparently has remarkable hearing, because she was practicing her clarinet when he and I were discussing money stuff the other day.  She went on to tell him that I am the closest she will ever have to a daughter.  I, of course, started to cry when he repeated this to me.  After I got off the line with my father, my mum called.  (They've been divorced for almost 16 years, but still have a weird telepathy when it comes to talking to me.)  I'd asked her for some help paying my student loans (I cannot justify Will paying them), and she asked me to get the exact amounts so that she can just pay them off.  It took a while for me to comprehend that.  Pay them off?  Like, one payment, all gone?  Inconceivable!  Not only that, but they've both offered to help with the deposit for a new apartment (whenever I find one), as well as my absurd balance on my old cell phone.  (Note to my stalkers: Sprint PCS - not good.)  Some of my guilt is alleviated when I remember that my younger sister is currently studying abroad in Paris.  But then I become extremely tense because her living conditions there are terrible.  Her professor is apparently a complete space cadet, and poor K didn't even know for certain until she arrived in France whether she had a place to stay.  Well, she does, but I think she might be better off without.  For two people, there is a flat with a crawl-space loft (for one) and a couch (for one), nowhere to hang clothing, and  no phone .  Now, the phone might not be a big deal if it weren't for the fact that we're talking about two young girls in a strange city in a foreign country.  Not to mention that the school promised they would be staying with  actual French people , not on their own.  (If K is anything like me, she won't mind that aspect.  Alone time is of the good, and easier with only one flatmate.)  The good news is that K had her first encounter with a rude French waiter on her first day there.  (She may not consider it good news, and was in fact very distraught, but I am amused.)  So, are there any millionaires and/or Parisians out there who want to help my sister or I out a bit?

      I have purple post-its.  They make me think of Stephanie and Amy.  Which reminds me, the purple color schemes are a bit much.  Seriously, is purple suddenly everyone's favorite color?  We didn't get the apartment, but the little Korean lady didn't speak enough English to explain why to me satisfactorily.  I have an appointment to look at another one tomorrow.  It's a little bit more expensive, but is one bedroom plus a loft, and the building has a pool.  Yikes.  Maybe I will finally learn how to swim if we live there.  I think Will is more depressed about all of this than I am.  Any suggestions for cheering him up?

      I'm so irritated!  I made a dreadfully amusing entry a little while ago, and it didn't go through.  I won't try to recreate the humor, just the basic idea: Cross your fingers for me.  I put in an application for a new apartment, and I want the place a lot.  Here's hoping for an OK credit check!

      Today I called all of the apartments on my list.  I'm pretty sure it was a fruitless effort, but I'll probably try to look at some of them tomorrow anyway.    I ask you, though - is it anyway to run a business?  "You call me before you come, I show you apartment."  Can't I make  an appointment?   Damn it.

      I got to play Chandler today.  She has some unfortunate internet access issues and asked me to send out the G.A.P. newsletter.  I think it went off quite well, and geswho (copy editor) was even kind enough to point out the dreadful spelling errors in my column.  Not that I'd ever misspell palantir.  I meant  typos .  In other news, I hate geocities.  Uploading stuff to my site is far more work than it should be, and PageBuilder is too retarded for a 4-year old, nevermind me.  I need to get some money, get some proper webspace, and learn enough html to make the site look OK.  Any volunteers for monetary contributions?

      Will and I were talking the other day about the game some people play where you list the famous people, living or dead, that you would like to have dinner with.  My version of the game involves a babelfish, because the first person on my list probably didn't speak English.  My list - let's assume that ten guests are allowed.   Peter Ilyich Tchaikovski  Shirley Jackson  Stanley Hyman  Alan Moore  Neil Gaiman  Wes Anderson  Cary Grant  James M. Caine  Kendall Hailey  Peter Jackson  And that is just off the top of my head.  Needless to say, this list is certain to change depending on my mood and current subjects of interest [read: obsessions].  You'll note that I left Sean Bean off my list.  You see, I am not as single-minded as one might think.  Also: for Kirk - (Mediocre)  urlLink Shirley Jackson page  with good links.

      So, I'm watching the Golden Globes.  I've never seen them before, and I'm impressed by how much more enjoyable than the Oscars they are.  Maybe it's the combination of TV and movies, maybe it's the more casual environment (tables, people eating and chatting, etc.), maybe it's just that I'm a sap of an old woman...I don't know.  Two speeches (so far) and one commercial have had me in tears.  Please form your own conclusions.  I am terribly pleased by the fact that Old Hollywood seems to be returning.  I have seen some of the loveliest hairstyles tonight.  In particular I liked the woman who represented the Hollywood Foreign Press (the one who laughed at Brendan Fraser behind her hand after his flubbed delivery of her introduction).  Dagmar Somethingorother.  Stunningly beautiful, with very old fashioned style.  Oh!  The clip from  The Two Towers  also made me tear up a bit.  In other news - a question:  Am I totally insane for wanting to adapt Shirley Jackson's  Life Among the Savages  and  Raising Demons  as a mini-series?

      Kirk on Fellowship of the Ring:  I'm hoping Christopher Lee wins.  I may be disappointed on that score.   Yes, I am taking it somewhat out of context, but it made me laugh a LOT.

       Bad Taste   I would greatly appreciate it if someone would volunteer to keep track of the myriad times that I make the following statement.   This is the best movie,  ever .     If he didn't already have fat, geeky babies, I would totally have Peter Jackson's.    My favorite line:  "Jeez, I hope we're not too late to save the world." Will's favorite line: "I'm a Derek.  Dereks don't run."  A review will be forthcoming in an all-new installment of  urlLink Grumpy Critic, Angry Cook .

       You can't ask a homeless guy for change.   Will and I went to Barney's for dinner.  We had, of all the strangest things, a gift certificate.  Yes, for Barney's.  Let's keep the story rolling.  After dinner, we walked, with our carry-out styrofoam cartons, to Gelson's supermarket to buy milk.  (If I cannot have milk with my coffee, I am  very  cranky, and the milk we had at home was starting to threaten sourness.)  As we walked down the street, a man coming toward us said, "Hey, can I ask you guys a question?"  Will said sure, and the guy almost won me over, because he said, "You have to stop walking first."  Almost won me over.  He proceded to explain that he is an out-of-work drummer, and used to play with David Bowie.  He is now, he tells us, divorced, and has sold his house in Sherman Oaks.  He's been walking up and down Santa Monica Boulevard, singing the chorus of Papa Was A Rolling Stone for a buck or two.  He'd like to sing for us, and if we like it, we'll pay him, and if we don't, he'll give us the full two dollars.    I knew that we had a twenty dollar bill.  "Do you  have  a dollar or two, sweetie," I asked Will pointedly (I hoped).  He said he didn't, and the guy tried to haggle us down to fifty cents, then a quarter.  I offered to look for change in my purse, and Will offered his leftover food.  "No," the man shouted at Will, "I want to find a cheap motel room."  That's where he lost me.  I do not trust homeless people who will not accept food.  And frankly, it is currently 70&#176; fahrenheit.  A night outdoors will not kill anyone - certainly not in this neighborhood, anyway.  I gave him the fifteen cents I was able to dig from my purse, and we walked on, but not before I saw that the man was crying.  I am somewhat distraught.  Somewhat less so because as we were walking home it occured to me that the tear I saw could have been a sign of a sad, pathetic man, or could have been the sign of a man ready to snap at any second, and there are alleys and doorways he could have been in.  But I knew (and confirmed when we arrived home) that Will was prepared to slug him, and I knew that I could wield that gallon of milk with deadly accuracy if I had to.  We're fighters.

       It isn't Tchaikovski, but...   [super geeky story]  I've been listening to the  Fellowship of the Ring  soundtrack a lot lately.  I would say "constantly," but that wouldn't be true, since sometimes I don't listen to anything at all.  I can't think of any piece of music that affects me as much as the Fellowship theme.  The mazurka from Delibes'  Coppelia  comes close.  Several Tchaikovski pieces do as well, hence the [post] title.  I visualize the scenes from the movie when listening to the soundtrack - not for every moment, but for several of them.  I freaked Will out yesterday by saying, "Great.  Where are we going?"  along to the appropriate part of the music.  Obviously, I need help.  What  really  worries me is some of the reactions I have.  The best example is during the  Bridge of Khazad Dum , about halfway through the piece when the fellowship theme plays for the second time.  Actually, just before it.  Every damn time, I worry that  this  time, Boromir and Legolas won't catch Frodo and Aragorn.  This is clearly absurd - I don't even worry about it when watching the movie, and didn't (much) the first time I saw it.  [/SuperGeek]  I was going to make this a WD post, with BOQ, but then I realized that it is too lame and pathetic, even for the WD.  Plus, I couldn't think of any questions, let alone a bunch of them.  Go on.  Make fun of me.  Just remember that I can edit your comments to my heart's content.

      I love my mother.  She sent me money, offered to pay for courses if I go back to school, and bought me the coolest measuring cups and spoons ever.  In addition, my sister sent me a video tape, program and poster from her last dance concert (which I was unable to attend) and 2 pairs of boots.  Now I can get rid of the 2 similar pairs of boots that I've never broken in because they are too tight.  Anyone wear a ladies' 7?  They're free.  Finally, a note to my neighbors: There are 40 units in this building, and only 4 washing machines.  Don't you think, perhaps, that leaving your laundry in them while you're at work is a bit rude?

      Will isn't going to be home until about 8:30 tonight.  This makes me sad.  But really - that's not much more than an hour later than he is usually home.  I don't know why it bothers me so much.    The good news is that he came home for lunch.  That was really nice.  In Buffyguide news, I think I must be losing my touch as a PMer.  I almost never get the flashing envelope of joy anymore.  ...and as I was about to post this, I got a PM.  Whoops.

      Today I told my friend John that I think I have Social Anxiety Disorder.  As it happens, I don't even  believe  in social anxiety disorder, but I can come up with no other explanation for my recent decline in ability to socialize.  John is manic-depressive, and anti-social in much the same way I've become, so he is a good person to talk to about these things, especially because he will tease me so mercilessly that I cannot help but feel better and then change the subject to Cary Grant.  Unfortunately, we must eventually get off the phone, and I then go back to feeling small.  Will can often tell when I am feeling small, because even my voice gets very small.  Of course, sometimes my voice gets small when I am just feeling cute, but that is neither here nor there.  Presumably due to my unemployment and lack of a vehicle, I almost never leave the apartment during the day Monday through Friday.  Now, I live in a nice neighborhood and the weather here is positively lovely, so I could very easily go out and just walk on a regular basis, but for some reason I don't.  Occasionally Jenn and I will do something on a weekday, but other than that I really am a total shut-in when left on my own.  On the weekends, Will and I rarely go anywhere, preferring the comfort of the living room, the DVD player, the computer, and our pajamas, not to mention each other.  When I find myself in social situations, I tend to be fairly shy unless I am with people I know well and feel comfortable with.  This is not new.  I think I was quite outgoing at one point in my life, but that stopped around the time I started to get my grown-up teeth.  I can deal with my own shyness, and am quite used to it.  It's changed.  I totally clam up when attempting to carry on a normal conversation with people I am fairly well acquainted with.  I have trouble communicating with even good friends except over the telephone or on the internet.  It seems as though the only person I am myself with (in person) these days is Will, and while I would choose him if I had to choose one person, I'd rather be able to talk to the rest of my friends too.  Hell, I am finding it difficult to even say "please" and "thank you," which as far as I'm concerned are not optional.  I am also not accomplishing anything lately, whether it be laundry or writing or anything in-between.  I am watching the same scenes of the same movies over and over, and though they are very comforting, I'm sure that I would benefit from variety in my routine.  I'm spending too much time on the internet without really enjoying much of it.  I am letting the dust on my bookshelves accumulate and the dirt on the floor become one with the carpeting.  Don't get me wrong - it isn't disgustingly dirty or anything, but I know I could do much better and feel that I am failing Will, who works so hard to provide for me.  I don't like feeling as though there is something wrong with me.  I am often somewhat depressed in wintertime, but this isn't depression.  It's like I am stunted, incapable of moving forward.  I'm actually quite happy on the whole, just - immobile and small.

      You know, it's strange - I am generally not the least bit amused by "Hollywood funny" - my sense of humor is too sophisticated, or something.  However.  We watched  Austin Powers in Goldmember  tonight.  I laughed almost non-stop for however long the movie is.  It was...words fail me.  I am terribly ashamed, and plan to watch some godawful art films to atone.

      Dear Everyone,  A word of advice: if I have just woken up, and you tell me something important, and it isn't good-important, and my reaction is less-than-good (or possibly even nasty), perhaps you should have waited until I'd had a cup of coffee.  I can be a very selfish person at times, but first thing in the morning my behavior has nothing to do with that, and everything to do with my inability to focus and comprehend.  I'm not a bad person, I hope.  I certainly am not nasty to my loved ones on purpose.

      Whenever I think about the time I worked at USA Today, I instantly feel paralizing terror.  My heart beats faster and my chest constricts.  I relive the tense moments, the times that my superiors were particularly bullish and I didn't know how to stand up for myself.  It's been almost a year since I gave my notice and left the corporate world of Advertising Sales forever.  My trains of thought are abstract at best.  I was thinking about tattoos, which made me think of my mom's former co-worker Rachel, whose wedding I went to.  She and her husband got tattoos on their fingers under their wedding bands.  Then I was thinking about the last time I saw them, at a company picnic, which they brought their baby girl to.  Also at the picnic was my mother's friend Holly, whose husband and son's names I can't remember.  Both names, like the men, were Algerian - when Holly met her husband, broken French was the only language they had in common.  Holly was one of those women who carries several extra pounds stunningly well.  That made me think of my other friend Holly, who I think would be less pretty if she were to lose weight.  Trying to remember Holly's last name, I used the trick of association - she has the same last name as one of the guys who worked down the hall from me at Gannett (the company that owns USA Today) - and thinking of  that  Steve made me think of Steve-my-boss, who was all right but a bit of a terror to try to keep happy, as his expectations would change with his mood.  All this happened while I was lying in bed two nights ago, and the terror struck.  I had a great deal of difficulty sleeping.  I have no idea what I'm going to do about all of this, but I suppose that one of my "goals" will be to just let go of it.  If I may change the subject a minute: I'm not very happy about a great deal of what this country does with its military.  But I would like to say right now that I love the soldiers, marines, sailors, pilots, officers, and every other individual who is protecting me.  Except possibly the National Guard, but I just may be biased there.  On a similar note, I love the police.  I was thinking about running over to the Sheriff's Department to tell them as much, but have decided to do that only if I wish to find out what their interrogation room looks like, or at least what sort of drug tests they administer.  Maybe next week, if I'm bored.

      Well, I'm glad that's all sorted out.  So, it's 2003.  In just under two hours it will be (by the American method of writing things out) 01/02/03, which I find to be impossibly cool.  I am hoping that P@ will do something neat on the board to celebrate, as I have no ideas whatsoever.  Then again, he hasn't been on the board since last year.  [cue polite laughter]  Will (who is currently passed out on the couch in a food coma, and looks really adorable) and I have been working on some truly amazing stuff for Deadlands lately.  I think we may have combined more universes than anyone has ever previously attempted, and I kind of (only kind of) wish we had a bigger gaming posse to impress with it.  Jenn, you'll just have to be REALLY impressed, OK?  Earlier, I spent a bit of time typing out a response to a bOq that Stephanie posted.  The topic was school, and I think I held back a lot.  Not in a bad way, just in a  not scaring the peons  way.  Go me!  In other news, I have decided to hate A&E all over again for cancelling Nero Wolfe.  Asswipes.  Oh!  I've decided that instead of making New Years Resolutions&#153; I will make a list of life goals.  One that I can add to at any time, but will, if things go accordingly, definitely add to every New Years.  Not to mention that I will have the option to cross things off as I accomplish them.  I am even going to try to be realistic.  And finally,  monkey!

      Because I don't want to type it out again and it'll be deleted from the Buffyguide testing forum fairly soon:  She was wearing a sheared raccoon coat, and Lane, walking toward her quickly but with a slow face, reasoned to himself, with suppressed excitement, that he was the only one on the platform who really  knew  Franny's coat. He remembered that once, in a borrowed car, after kissing Franny for a half hour or so, he had kissed her coat lapel, as though it were a perfectly desirable, organic extention of the person herself.

      God help me, I've begun alphabetizing the hardbacks and oversized paperbacks as well.  There were a few books that were hard to categorize - and I do mean between fiction and non-fiction.  What?  We have weird books.  In other news, I am about 2 minutes late in wishing Pat and Stephanie a happy fifth anniversary.  I love you guys!  In yet other news, I am nearly tempted to unban Jennifer from my comments simply because I know she is still reading this and I am utterly baffled as to why.  I doubt she'd say, and anyway there just isn't a good enough reason to allow her any closer to my life than she seems determined to stay.  But still, it is somewhat tempting.  Blech.  Just typing that left a bad taste in my mouth.  I think I should have some yummy juice and start my reply to Beth's wonderful letter.

       The trouble with alphabetizing my paperbacks  is that I've got my James Kirkwood books next to some Dean Koontz books that I'm certain I've never seen before.  Now, not having read anything of Mr. Koontz's, I am completely out of line if I imply that he is a sub-par author.  However, it is not unreasonable of me to assume that his books do not match up, so to speak, to Mr. Kirkwood's, which I'd put on the same level of literature as J.D. Salinger.  And of course, only one of  them  threw a hissy fit and stopped publishing, so I think it's safe to say James Kirkwood is one of my very favorite authors of all time, with James M. Cain and Shirley Jackson and Neil Gaiman.  (It is, of course, only fair to note that I am aware of only three novels of James Kirkwood's, though I also know that he wrote plays.  Perhaps he, too, stopped publishing.  Must look into this.)  Speaking of books,  The Return of the King  is eyeing me from across the room.  Bastard.  I really want to see the movie unspoiled, as it were.  The first two movies I saw with very little idea what to expect, and though I know more about this story, I don't think I should read the book first.  I don't want to have expectations.  On the other hand, the suspense is killing me.  Poor tiny Sam!  (Obviously, I read the end of  The Two Towers , against my better judgment.)  I have other Tolkien-related books to occupy myself with, but half of the stuff I've looked at gives away major events in the last book, which makes it pointless to not just read it.  Note to self:  Get a life.  Oh!  Speaking of books (again), two of my paperbacks got stuck together during the moving and storage portion of this past year.  I pried them apart, and it seems that the culprit was some runaway shampoo (or something like), and it is still all over the covers of the books.  One of them has a glossy cover, and I think I can clean it with a damp cloth, but the other is old and frail and very much  paper  - any ideas on how to clean it?  I made myself a latte this morning, and had the unfortunate experience of drinking coffee, milk, and dish soap.  As I was too distraught to identify the object responsible, I got a new cup and am now drinking black coffee.  Not what I wanted at all.

      So hungover.  Yuck.  We went to a country bar last night for a rockabilly show.  It felt like being home!  I suppose this headache is a fair payment for such a good time.  Bah.  I'm getting nasty at the WD.  Maybe I should go take a nap.

      I am happy to report that I found my diamond ring.  It was my great-grandmother's, and is really quite beautiful.  30 diamond chips.  Or 29.  It comes to  one  of those numbers each time I count...  Anyway, I found it a few days ago, but it just occured to me that I had told  someone  that I hadn't unpacked it yet and was worried, and I can't remember who it was.  I'm a dope.

      When I first began using instant messenger programs, I refused to use emoticons/icons/whatever.  I think I may go back to that way of thinking, because I loathe the concept of having my tone represented by stupid smileys.  And now for a more serious topic:  After an unexpected explanation to [name withheld] as to why I had him blocked on msn, I feel the need to get a few things off my chest.    I thought The_Avenger was hilarious.  Detrimental to the WD community and deserving of immediate banning, yes.  Hurtful to many people I care about, yes.  But funny.    I was lied to by at least 2 people, including the perpetrator if the false identity, when I asked them if they knew who was behind it all.  One of those people had no reason to be truthful with me.  The other did.  I've ceased communication with both, because I see no reason to continue false friendships.  The former was only ever a casual, insult-each-other and occasionally-talk-seriously friend, and perhaps it was unnecessary of me to stop talking to him.  The latter, however, was someone who I trusted.  I do not intend to ever speak to her again.    I have been accused of hypocricy over this situation.  There is a very distinct line between being amused by something unfunny and expecting your friends to be truthful with you.  End of story.    Despite possible indications to the contrary, I understand why someone would lie to one friend if they'd told another friend they'd keep something secret.  I do not, however, understand why the thing that was being kept secret in the first place ever happened.    There are a lot of people I consider friends, and sometimes I cannot be a  good  friend to all of them, particularly since several of them violently dislike each other.  I'm trying.  I really am.  But it's very tiring sometimes.

       For your amusement – the msn chat log is back.    On grammar  Phoebe: How're you? Annika: Pretty good.  Or does "I am pretty well" sound better? Phoebe: Huh. I think that the latter requires too much to be put in ellipsis--your brain has to figure out "I am doing pretty well." I read in one of my grammar books that one should avoid overuse of ellipsis. Annika: That hurt my head.  I'll leave it at "good." Phoebe: Okay. It hurt my head, too.   On Salinger  Annika: I read "Uncle Wiggely" the other night, which I know I've read before but didn't remember at all.  I liked it a great deal. Phoebe: So do I. I understand it very poorly, though. Annika: I doubt that I understood it well the first time - I think that's why I don't remember it well. Phoebe: Yeah. I always forget what it's called, too. Annika: I misspelled it, but it's Uncle Wiggly in Connecticut. Phoebe: Oh. Is it? I thought it was "Wiggily." Huh. Annika: It is.  I misspelled it again.   On apartments  Annika: Oh!  I had some thoughts about apartments that I wish to write down.  It will either be extremely boring or just the sort of thing that you and I tend to talk about. Phoebe: Oh! I love apartments. I suspect it will be the latter.  Phoebe: Your apartment is so pretty. You shouldn't move until I grow up and sub-let it from you. Annika: The apartment next-door is empty.  It's just like ours in mirror image.  I desperately want to rent them both and have a Through the Looking Glass apartment. Phoebe: Ooh, like Coraline, but hopefully not dangerous. Annika: If there is a Will there with button-eyes I will be very upset. Phoebe: You are incredibly cute. Phoebe: And, yes, that would be very alarming. Annika: I don't know what I would do, but I think it would involve fetching you and possibly Dustin to help.   On hair  Phoebe: My hair, in theory, grows very quickly too, but I can never tell anymore. Well, maybe it does, because I'm always trying to trim my hair-in-face. (I keep parts of my hair shorter so that they'll be in my face.) Annika: That is terribly cute. Phoebe: Thank you. Phoebe: It started when I wanted to be like Phoebe-the-character. She has hair-in-face. Annika: I wish to be more like a character.  My trouble is that I haven't got a character in mind. Phoebe: I know exactly what you mean. I want to write a book about wanting to be a character.   On  The New Yorker   Annika: I'm going to ask [Will] tonight if I may renew the subscription.  I shouldn't, because we're broke, but I want to. Phoebe: Oh, the New Yorker is wonderful. I mean, it's really good these days, but in addition to that it's great for one's image. Annika: I completely agree.

      I just said the following to Phoebe:  "I wish to be more like a character.  My trouble is that I haven't got a character in mind."  When I picture my ideal home, as I try to put my things away and create such an environment, I picture mysewlf doing things like reading the New Yorker on the balcony (must renew my subscription), chopping vegetables, watching the news (I'd read the paper, but I know me better than that), walking to the market for fresh fruit...  I am a total goon sometimes.  I'll finish this thought later, but for now, just know that I'm a fruitcake.

       A shorter entry for the benefit of my lazy and/or illiterate stalkers (hi, Matty!)   All of my stuff is out of storage, and I have located all of my Salinger books.  I'm part-way through  Nine Stories , specifically my favorite, "For Esme, With Love & Squalor."  I plan to re-read  Franny & Zooey  next, then attempt "Seymour: An Introduction," which I have never read.  I thumb my nose at you all.

       Am I a bad citizen or are you a bad journalist?   I’ve never been good about following the news.  In fifth grade we did Current Events as a fun weekly project – we each brought in an article or notes on a news report and we split into teams of about five and did a “news broadcast.”  We were given preparation time and did commercials as well as presenting our stories.  It was… okay.   For almost two years I worked for USA Today.  I was an assistant in the Advertising Sales department, and part of my job was to read the paper every morning.  Well – sort of.  Technically, what was expected of me was to flip through the paper and look at the ads that my sales reps had sold, to make sure they looked good.  But they  said  that they were paying me to read the paper, so sometimes I did.  On September 11, 2001, I was sent home at about 10:00 Chicago time.  I (and my roommate) watched CNN for approximately nine hours that day.  I haven’t read a newspaper since, and I rarely watch the news.  Oh, sure, I read the headlines when I had free access to the paper, but I  didn’t want to know  anything further.  Recently, I’ve started watching the news on television more often.  It’s nice to have something in the background while I unpack, and I wish to be better informed.  My news show of choice is the ABC 7 News – not necessarily because it’s better than the other news programs (I wouldn’t know) but because we don’t have cable and ABC gets the best reception.  I am going all to pieces over this business with Iraq.  My primary issue is that it is, apparently,  impossible  to become an informed citizen.  All day every day all I hear is, “Coming up on Eyewitness News at eleven, the latest on the  Showdown with Iraq. ”  The what, now?  It is  my impression  that G.W. is insistent that we will go to war, troops have been sent over in droves, celebrities are protesting, and the U.N. is insisting that weapons inspections continue and war be a last resort.  This cannot be the whole story.  On Friday, I saw part of the live coverage of the U.N. Security Council thingy.  (See?  “Thingy.”  I am not well-informed.)  Colin Powell, who if I’m not mistaken is the Secretary of State, and therefore a Major Player, stated that we (America, I assume) will only use war as a  last resort,  but that it must be  a  resort and we must be prepared.  Now that sounds intelligent to me, but it contradicts everything I’ve heard from the President.  Is this because G.W. is taking a more pro-war stance, or has the news been only showing the more impassioned portions of his speeches?  Are we backing down because we don’t have the support of the U.N.?  And why, for the love of whomever, would we declare imminent war before having the U.N.’s approval?  Doesn’t that make the whole concept of the U.N. obsolete?  I am not necessarily opposed to war.  I believe that Saddam Hussein is a  Bad Man .  The best article I ever read in The New Yorker was about the Kurds.  I understand what a threat the Iraqi government is – in the Middle East.  I understand that it is the custom of the U.S. to interfere – I mean  help  - in situations like this, but why  now ?  I swear, if I hear the words  Showdown with Iraq  once more without further explanation, I will scream.  (People of Koreatown, fetch your earplugs.)   In other news,   Will’s mysterious errand on Friday was to Polkadots and Moonbeams, one of our favorite shops, where he bought me a beautiful necklace.

      Will ran a mysterious errand today.  I am  dying  to know what it was.  Also: in approximately 90 minutes, Primanti Bros. LA will be open for business.  Or, you know, Barranti Bros.  In approximately 97 minutes, I will have a massive food coma.   And finally,   a poem by Shirley Jackson:  Song for all editors, writers, theorists, political economists, idealists, communists, liberals, reactionaries, bruce bliven, marxist critics, reasoners, and postulators, any and all splinter groups, my father, religious fanatics, political fanatics, men on the street, fascists, ernest hemingway, all army members and advocates of military training, not excepting those too old to fight, the r.o.t.c. and the boy scouts, walter winchell, the terror organizations, vigilantes, all senate committees and my husband:         I would not drop dead from the lack of you&#151;      My cat has more brains than the pack of you.

      Yahoo! Photos is a real pain in the ass.  I have been uploading pictures of our apartment for over half an hour now.  I think it is time to invest in DSL.  In totally unrelated news, I spoke to Phoebe last night for over an hour.  We discussed many things, including sewing, Peter Jackson, Alexander the Great, raincoats, exercise, and public school.  It was a devastatingly lovely conversation.  So today is Valentine's Day.  It looks like I won't be receiving candy (don't want it), flowers (requested that he not pay the inflated prices for something that will die so quickly), or jewelry (I'm guessing, but I know the bank balance).  In listing the things I will not be given, I don't wish to appear to be complaining, just observing.  I told Will that I just wanted him and I meant it.  Last night, the five-year anniversary of us, we went to a comedy club.  It was interesting.  Oh, sonofabitch.  Netscape just freaked out and closed.  I doubt if any of the photos uploaded.  Anyway, this comedy club.  We went because my friend Lisa Beth's brother was one of the comedians, and I've been meaning to meet him/see his act for a while now.  $12 cover and 2 drink minimum seems a bit steep, but oh well.  Some of the guys were really funny, the MC was oddly attractive, and I looked fabulous.  We're best not talking about the drinks at all, though.  Dude!   urlLink It worked!   I'm going to quit now while I'm ahead.  Happy Valentine's day to all of my stalkers.  Your  restraining orders  cards are in the mail.

      Dear Jane Espenson,  I'm really, really sorry that I said nasty things about you in Best Buy the other day.  It was before  First Date  aired.  love, bettie   Dear Zales, Diamond Exchange, Kay Jewelers, Sears, et cetera,  Please stop airing manipulative commercials.  I understand that Valentine's Day is a lucrative holiday in the "Love Industry," but you are ruining my relationship.  I am finding myself agonizing over the fact that my boyfriend hasn't proposed, and I blame you 100%.  This is absolutely unacceptable, as the status of my relationship is none of your business.  I resent the implication that a diamond is the only way for Will to declare his love for me, as I know, rationally, that it is absolutely untrue.  I'm an American.  I  will  sue.  love, bettie   Dear Christine,  You are a beautiful, amazing, brilliant woman and I am thrilled to know you.  love,  bettie

      It's raining out.  Perhaps I am just being a big baby, but I have to go to the bank and I don't wanna.  Stupid rain.  In other news, last night's  Buffy  had me yelling at the TV.  Seriously, I think I scared Will.  The second the teaser was over I shouted, "THANK YOU!"  ...About a minute later I asked Will if the opening credits had run.  I was so busy being excited and grateful that I didn't notice.  I think this is my favorite episode of the season.  Even better than  Same Time Same Place .  (I know there was at least one other that I really loved, but I'm drawing a blank.  I think I'll go to the bank now.)

      I've currently got two pressing questions to which I need answers:  1. Should I read  The Return of the King , or wait until after I've seen the movie?  I read the other two books after seeing the movies, and am glad I did, but I don't know if I can wait 10 months to find out what happens to poor Sam.  2. Should I stay up late so that I can sleep in tomorrow and don't have to wait too long before I get to see Will (I'm picking him up at the airport at noon) or should I go to bed early so that I don't get lonely?  I was thinking of putting up a poll, but I'm not as cool as Pat.

He's in the air right now, and will land in Portland in about an hour.  Stupid granny, having a stupid birthday.  [pout]  ...OK, fine, I take it back!  She's a swell dame, and you only turn 89 once.  I think I should write a comic book. [/nonsequitur]

      Have decided that nothin' says "Love" like piles of presents for me.  And also cheese.  Possibly presents of cheese.  (I am currently sick and avoiding dairy.  It is torture.)  In other news, it is nearing my two year anniversary over at  urlLink That Place .  I don't know if I'll do anything for it.  There have been quite a lot of anniversaries lately.  Then again, I could always write that BOQ I've been planning forever and ever.  And I think I might send out the G.A.P. newsletter on the day, because I can.  In other other news, but still board-related, I want to reply to Soupy's post about the Michael Jackson "special," but Will wouldn't let me watch it.  Too traumatising, I suppose.  We watched The Surreal Life instead, because watching MC Hammer berate Corey Feldman for taking too long on the crapper is far from traumatic.  [rolleyes]  Oh!  That reminds me (in a weird way) that I need to sit down and write my screenplay.  Which one?  Doesn't matter, but I think I'll work on  Mona Lisa,  because I already have the first and third acts worked out in my head, and the middle will either write itself or be put on hold.  I'd work on  Revenants,  but I think I want to watch  Dagon  again first.  I'm weird, I know - I in no way plan to base anything on  Dagon,  just feel like watching it.  Horror is horror, right?  (Hint:  the correct answer is "No.")

      I had the  strangest  stress dream last night.  For reference, I always have panicky dreams immediately after moving.  The dreams are always about moving, essentially a reliving of the move with everything that could have gone wrong and/or all the stuff I forgot to pack, et cetera.  Last night I dreamed that we were moving the stuff out of Will's second apartment.  ([eyebrow])  This sort of corrolates, I think, to the stuff that I still have in storage.  As with the real move, I was packing stuff as Will and our friends were loading the truck.  In this case, there was a made-up girl ( not  Jenn) who had a moving truck that we were using.  She was a  total bitch .  I think my subconcious gave her absolutely every quality that I hate.  She was mean and bossy and wouldn't listen to anything I said, even though it was my stuff.  I'd be in the middle of packing a box and she would grab it and load it up.  When I tried to explain that I'd been dealing with this move for two weeks and needed her to let me pack my own stuff  before  it was put on the truck, she interrupted me, told me that I just couldn't have things my way, and wouldn't let me finish my sentence.  I eventually got so angry and frustrated that I slapped her.  She left, taking away the truck.  Freud?  What was really strange is that this girl (she didn't have a name that I recall) was absolutely made up.  She looked ever so slightly like Valerie, but not entirely.  I love my subconcious for giving me an anonymous someone to take out my frustrations (and just possibly control issues) on.  Of course, it is entirely possible that the dream was the fault of the medicine I've been taking.  It's just over-the-counter Tylenol Cold, but the sleepy stuff in their nighttime medicine is VERY affective.  (Alas, the actual cold medicine is questionable.)  I have no idea how I made it from the living room, where I was mostly passed out in front of the TV, to the bathroom, where I brushed  and  flossed (obviously I was drugged), to the bedroom.  I vaguely remember Will kissing me goodnight, and then nothing until this morning when he gave me my stuffed animals before he left for work.  Incidentally, I adore him.

      Being sick sucks.  I mean, sure, I am lightheaded and easily amused, which is nice, but then I do things like go downstairs to refill my water and  forget to bring my glass.   Nevermind that I do stuff like that when I'm healthy.  Just give me sympathy.  Hopefully haloscan will fix itself soon.  Sweet monkey!  Valentine's Day is in a week, as is our 5 year anniversary, and I have no idea what to do for Will.  Suggestions?  Please?  (It also might be a good idea to post suggestions for stuff that he can do for me.)  In other news, I found out Phoebe's middle name today.  If and when I have a daughter*, you will all find out, because it is the only girls' name Will and I are in agreement on (though not, alas, because of Phoebe).  Since I never met the person we would be naming her for, though, I can just hope that she'll turn out smart like Phoebe.  *please note that I am  not  pregnant, merely speculating.

       Thank god it's (mostly) over.   My faith in humanity has been restored.  After last week, I wasn't really sure I could trust anyone but Will.  After this weekend, I know without a doubt that I have the best friends in the universe.  Last Monday we were approved for the apartment we wanted.  I started packing immediately and on Tuesday we signed the lease and packed some more.  Jenn took me out for lunch and helped out by bringing over boxes and packing with me.  Wednesday we picked up the keys and moved over one carload of stuff, missing  Angel  in the process.  I hear we didn't miss much.  By Thursday I was in a bit of a state, as the old place was so tiny that I'd run out of room to pack and was only about a third of the way through our stuff.  Friday Will took a half day and Jenn came over with her pickup truck.  Geoff met us at the old place and Cassie came by shortly thereafter.  While Cassie and I packed more, the three superheroes took stuff over to the new place.  They got about 3 loads done before Jenn had to take off, leaving us with her truck (the angel).  After one more load, we went out for middle eastern food and called it a night.  Next day we started again, san Jenn but with the addition of Dave, a former intern from Will's company who is quite the little workhorse.  I took care of the last of the packing while they did runs with the truck (and on occasion the cars as well), and by 7:00 I had the place spotless and we were ready to turn in the keys and go home.  Home!  By far the most interesting part of the move was on Friday when we tried to get the couch into the new place.  The short version is that it fell on me twice and is currently in our bedroom.  The long version is that because of the way the entryway of our apartment is set up we cannot get the couch around the corner(s) into the living room.  By the time it fell on me (the second time - the first time was my own fault because I thought I could carry it up the stairs and found out the hard way that I was wrong) we'd wedged it quite firmly (we thought) and discovered that we needed exactly a quarter of an inch leeway.  I've unpacked the hacksaw and plan to take the couch apart entirely if necessary.  You know, or buy a new one.  But couches are really expensive.  Back to my original point - my friends, and in particular Jenn and Cassie, are amazing.  They go above and beyond every day without even thinking about it.  I have no idea what I've done to deserve them.  (This is in no way a slight of Geoff, who put in an amazing amount of time and muscle this weekend.  It's just that Geoff and Will are much closer than Geoff and I.)  This weekend Will is going to Oregon for his grandmother's 89th birthday, so I will be all alone for 2 or 3 days.  What sucks is that I still have a lot of my stuff in storage.  What is truly amazing is that Jenn, without a moment's hesitation, said, "Oh, we'll get it without him.  See if Geoff can help again."  (It should be noted that Geoff had already volunteered.)  Oh, and while I am listing the Wonders of Jenn, she is giving me her baker's rack.  It's gorgeous, and I'm very excited.  If I feel any better this afternoon, we'll move it in.  Also today Sears is delivering our refrigerator.  It's common in LA to rent a place that is not furnished with all appliances - namely, fridges.  Thanks to our daddies, we were able to afford a very nice, albeit somewhat small, one.  Yay!  I can have milk again!  This is getting long and rambly.  I have lots more to say, but I think I'll hold off.  Missed you all.

       Warning: this entry is about issues of a girly nature.   Dear Uterus,  What the hell is wrong with you?  We had a lovely schedule worked out, and suddenly you're being weird.  Every three weeks?  Isn't that a bit extreme?  I'm going to run out of fabulously expensive self-adhesive heating pads soon.  I am not amused.  As I am bigger than you, I feel that I should be in control.  Get back on schedule,  or else.

      Dude, I totally forgot to tell you all: we got a couch!  Or, more accurately, a loveseat.  It is the  weirdest  color.  I don't know how to describe it - it almost looks as if someone spilled red wine, but very, very evenly.  It's fairly comfortable, not hideous, and generally OK.  I would have preferred a pull-out, but this one was free.  Free!  And now I must end this entry, as I am chatting with Saren and will soon be leaving for LAX to pick up my sister.

       Things I (almost) did today     Filed my Federal Tax Return.  This would have been in the (actually) done list, had I remembered to send my W2s to work with Will so he could mail everything.  Sent a harsh letter demanding Will's security deposit refund from the old apartment.  This will be (actually) done tomorrow - I need photocopies made of a few things, and to visit the post office so I can send it certified.  Ate before 4:00.  I had some pretzels, but I don't think it counts.  Finished filling out all of the state and local forms.  Hell, I don't even  have  the local forms.  In conclusion, I suck.  But K arrives tomorrow.

      Dear Anne Rice,  I've never had anything but the most grudging respect for you, so I hope you'll forgive this out-of-the-blue missive.  As you know, I find Lestat to be the most appallingly  dull  character ever to have several books devoted to him.  However, I find it  even more appalling  to see him onscreen under the pseudonym "Spike" - or, more accurately, "William."  I recommend suing David Fury, Drew Goddard, and Joss Whedon.  yours, Bettie

      Last night we went to the Beverly Cinema for a double feature of  Evil Dead  and  Dead Alive .  The movies were great!  Of course, I already knew that, but it was immense fun to see them in a theater - especially  Dead Alive , which had an excellent audience reaction.  I hid my eyes a total of 3 times in 2 features.  Not bad for a girly-girl.  My favorite part of  Evil Dead  was when the sound went out while Ash was in the basement.  It was  hilarious.

But then I'd have to get over that whole thing I have about talking to people I admire and sounding like a moron, which would be a great deal of trouble.  So probably not.

      I've been reading plays.  Specifically, excerpts of plays that my friend John is writing.  I've only ever been able to write short stories and screenplays.  Stage is totally beyond me - a fact that never deterred me when I was younger, but then I never wrote anything good.  Now I'm finding myself wanting to tackle a play, even though my brain just doesn't wrap around the concept of a single set.  (And yes, I understand that sets can be changed; what I mean is that the stage is  it  - all there is to work with.)  All of this pondering is serving only to remind me that I haven't actually written anything in ages.  Now I am depressed.

      I've had another great weekend.  Spending time with Will is just so damn nice.  I ran my first Deadlands game today.  It was so  weird  for Will to be a player and me to be in charge.  Lauren's post about local bands is making me extremely nostalgic.  I've really not got much to say.  I apologize.  All of my creativity is going into writing a letter to Beth.

      Will and I invented a game.  We were lying in bed and he was sort of nibbling on me, and I said  Nibble nibble like a mouse, who's that nibbling at my house?   I believe it's from Hansel and Gretel.  Anyway, he began nibbling at different parts of me (it wasn't  that  naughty, I swear), and I'd make up a rhyme for each one.  The top three, in reverse order:    Nibble nibble like a Bringer, who's that nibbling at my finger?  Nibble nibble like a boob, who's that nibbling at my boob?   (He didn't find this one nearly as funny as I did.)   Nibble nibble like a pickle, who's that nibbling?  Stop, it tickles!   Good times.

       Name Bettie's Blog!   So, as you can see I've made some minor template adjustments.  Thank you, Beth!  Helping you procrastinate has worked out very nicely for me.  Now I want to change the name of this damn blog.  I named it without thought, before I told anyone of its existance.  I was listening to Social Distortion.  I call Will "Sick Boy" sometimes.  (I'd explain the "good girl" part but then I'd be paranoid that someone might steal my book idea.)  Anyway...  What should I re-name my blog?

But I must admit, I  really  want to be able to include pictures and graphics.)   EDIT  Oooh, and I forgot.

       *sigh*    Warning: extremely boring entry.   Tax time.  Wheee!  Fun.  I tried to do the paperwork for Will's taxes yesterday, but ran into a few wee problems:  The post office had the 1040EZ forms, but no booklets, state forms, or city forms.   Gee, thanks.   The IRS has the booklets available online as PDF files, but it is exceptionally difficult to read a 32 page PDF file, even with a large(ish) monitor.  The idiot accountants who cut checks for Ben Stiller's employees do not withhold enough federal taxes, meaning that,  if  I read the "booklet" correctly, we owe the IRS about $700.  We don't  have  $700.  We don't even have a  couch !  I am unable to file my own taxes, as my W2s were sent to Chicago and my (former) roommate is forwarding them to me but they have not yet arrived.  Once they do, I will face the challenge of getting Illinois tax forms.  More fun!  Also in financial news, the owners of the apartment we moved out of last month have yet to send Will his security deposit  or  a written explanation of why they are withholding it, as required by law.  It's been over 30 days, and though I have to double-check the local laws, I'm fairly certain that this entitles us to a full refund.  Will left a voicemail for the building manager, but he is notorious for not calling back, so I will most likely be taking care of this by mail.  Which, granted, is the best solution anyway - a piece of paper with "CC: West Hollywood Housing Commission" is more likely to produce results than a phone call.  In terrible financial news (because the above isn't bad enough), I've discovered that Will's credit card is charging him something in the vicinity of 21% APR and that my bank account seems to have been turned over to collection agents.  Please note that I haven't heard a  word  from my bank since sending them my change of address, so I cannot  possibly  pay off my overdraft, because I  don't know what it is .  I've applied (ironically, at Citibank, which holds my [possibly ex] checking account) for a new credit card in Will's name, and hopefully will be able to transfer the balance over.   End boring part.   We're having a party in a week and a half.  I'm looking very forward to it, though I have no idea where we'll find money to purchase booze for it.

      K is coming for a visit in a few weeks.  Exact date to be determined.  She asked how long she could stay, and I told her "more than 2 days, but one day before we kill each other."  She has determined that to be two weeks.   We shall see.   If Phoebe doesn't update soon, she will never hear my boring comment about my mother and J.D. Salinger.  I hung a few more pictures this morning, and watched the last few minutes of today's  Port Charles  while giggling about it on the phone with Jenn.  I don't believe I have ever seen so many genre shows/movies ripped off in one place.  I keep using markup instead of html.  I have laundry to sort and then wash.  Again.  And when I've done that I can look forward to folding it and putting it away.  Perhaps I was mistaken when I stated my goal to be a housewife.  I just misread the phrase "grumbling to self" as "grumpy house elf."  It's time to put down the Harry Potter books.  (Actually, I've already done that, having finished re-reading  Goblet of Fire  last night.)  And finally, a snippet of a conversation held in the bathroom yesterday afternoon:  Annika: My hair is so shiny and soft...I think I'm becoming narcissistic. Will:  Becoming?

      What a fantastic weekend I've had.   *happy sigh*   I had tons of things that I meant to write about when I came online, and I've forgotten  every last one of them.   Maybe someone should get me a notebook and tie it to my wrist.  It would be uncomfortable, and I might have to stop showering, but at least I could take notes!  Here is the thing I just remembered: We played Terminal Pursuit with Jenn and Geoff, and Will won.  I am so proud of my geeky sweetpea.

      I think everyone missed the point of my letter to Nora Robertson.  I fully understand the use of pseudonyms, and even the concept of the book jacket stating that you're Nora Roberts  writing as  J.D. Robb, just not the damn television commercial advertising it.  Of course, I'm known for not making my point clear.  In other news...nope, I've got nothing.

      Dear Nora Roberts,  Why on earth would you write a book under the pseudonym JD Robb and then make a commercial announcing your new book as "Nora Roberts writing as JD Robb"?  That is just weird.  If you want to break away from the romance genre but still be recognized, write as Nora Roberts.  It worked for Sandra Brown.  Of course, her non-romance novels still had a romance as the secondary storyline, and tons of steamy sex, but that's her problem.  You're a good writer, but clearly tipped.  Love, bettie

      Amanda is now stalking me.  This works out quite well for me, as she is one of those people whose posts I always read and whose diaries I visit occasionally, but for some reason I almost never speak to directly.  I had a serious (!) conversation with Matt last night.  Shocking, I know.  I can honestly say that he is one of my best friends, even though we rarely talk except to exchange insults or at least self-depracating remarks.  But he is a truly fantastic and  real  person, and I'm thrilled to know him.  Incidentally, I still want Mexican food.  Will made chili con queso, Texas style, which will probably be satisfactory.

I'm considering resigning as a moderator and maybe leaving the WD altogether.  It might be a good idea, though, for me to not base this decision on  one  hideously self-righteous board member.   *sigh*

       My neighbors.   The building we live in is huge.  There are approximately 150 apartments.  There are 9 staircases (assuming I didn't lose count), 3 elevators, 2 courtyards, and 1 pool.  The building itself takes up an entire block (not a square block, just one side of a block), and inside the hallways are seemingly infinite stretches of white walls and purple carpets, disturbed only by grey firedoors ever 30 feet or so.  I have gotten lost more than once, and have to go through 6 firedoors to reach the front of the building.  The roof is an impressive maze of heating/AC vents, surrounded by peaked bits of roof around the perimeter.  The exterior apartments on the 3rd floor all have porches overlooking the roof, and from our side of the building the Hollywood sign is visible between two of the peaks.  There are two trash chutes.  The ground floor has assigned parking and a laundry room with 12 machines.  These last 2 amenities cause more problems than I would have expected.  Trash.  Trash strikes me as something that, while not necessarily pleasant to take care of daily, is not difficult.  You take the bag out of the bin, tie it off, and stuff it down the trash chute.  I lived in the country for years, and trust me - weekly trips to the dump are a lot less fun.  So why is it that my neighbors cannot seem to keep the trash off the floor surrounding the chutes?  I'm not just talking dirty kleenex here, either - I'm talking chicken bones, lemon rinds, gum...It's fucking disgusting.  I have, on more than one occasion, seen trash bags sitting in front of my neighbors' doors, not even tied off.  Today, the door in question was about 10 feet from the trash chute.  No wonder we occasionally have roaches.  Laundry.  There are, as I mentioned, 12 washers and 12 dryers.  Unlike our old building (which had 4 of each, none of which worked very well), it seems that most of the people washing their clothing are housewives, like me, as opposed to the single men and once-a-week housekeepers I usually saw in the West Hollywood building.  They are, however, unlike me, terrible housewives.  Now, granted, I never dust and rarely clean the toilet, but I know how to do laundry, and I have respect for the fact that other people use the laundry facilities.  These bitches ALL use powdered laundry soap, and never bother to contain it  within the washing machines.   They never clean the lint screens.  Today I found a lint screen sitting in a dryer, loose, spreading linty bits all over the otherwise clean dryer.  No one ever seems to actually check the machines for missed items.  I can't tell you how many loose socks and undies I've found abandoned.  ARGH!  I'd go on, but I think I've reached my Annoyance Capacity.

      Before I came online, I watched a bit of a show called Celebrity Justice.  It may be the saddest excuse for a half hour's programming I've ever heard of.  Yes, worse than Texas Justice!  There, I've said it.  Not even my Katherine-esque devotion to stupid celebrities could make me watch that show again, even if there is nothing else (besides Port Charles) on at 11:30.  BBC Radio did a version of The Lord of the Rings several years ago.  I believe it is the version I came across during Christmas shopping, which was priced so absurdly that I doubt there is a single American out there who owns it.  I desperately want to hear it, though.  So last night we went to Sean's Everwood screening party.  I don't think there is anything stranger than watching a television show in a bar with several people you don't know.  While standing up.  At least there was wine, even if one glass was approximately three and a half times the price of a bottle of our current favorite.  Yay for Trader Joe's!  In other news, there is only a bit more than two months until my 25th birthday.

       Dude, someone really wanted to find me.   I just checked the IPs for hits to this page over the weekend, and someone got here through a google search for "Annika."  I checked, and the hit was on the  fifteenth  page of the search results.  That's dedication!  I have no idea who it was, or I'd send them cookies.   Also.   Will and I had the most splendid weekend.  On Saturday we drove out to Antelope Valley.  Will says that it is "high plains desert," which I have trouble believing since it is only an hour away from sea-level and my ears didn't pop at all.  Maybe the phrase doesn't mean what it sounds like it means.  Anyway, we went to a place called the Devil's Punchbowl in the Angeles National Park, which is stunningly gorgeous.  There were trails, but we weren't wearing appropriate footwear, so we just wandered down far enough to get some good photos.  We stopped at a so-called Farmer's Market (it wasn't, but that was the name of the store) where there was a lunch counter with spectacular Mexican food, and we bought some produce for absurdly low prices.  Yesterday we played Deadlands with Will running the MetaHuman campaign for the first time since we moved.  Once again, I  am  Jenny Sparks.  I'll move on since most of my readers are probably not gaming geeks.  Yesterday evening we had the Monday Night Supper Club one day early, as I cannot cook tonight.  I made honey-jerk chicken and an assortment of other goodies, and it was great.  It is starting to worry me, though, that every time Andy walks into a room Will starts doing his "Andy voice" and doesn't stop until Andy is gone.  Now, Andy's voice is pretty sexy, but it's still creepy.  To compensate, I have decided to be a Will/Andy shipper.   And so forth...   Tonight, our friend Sean's episode of  Everwood  airs, and we are going to his screening party.  This will be weird, because we hate watching television with other people.  On the other hand, there will be booze, and probably finger food.  Hee.  Fingers.

      I am listening to the commentary on  The Royal Tenenbaums  and just thinking about how good I've got it.  Will is amazingly wonderful, to the point that I can't even describe.  Katherine sent me the sweetest (or possibly most disgusting, I'm not sure) PM today.  My sister sent us her copy of  Alice  because Will mentioned enjoying the demo.  Jenn came over last night to watch  Vampyr  with us and didn't make fun of my choice to sleep through the middle.  And I am reading Phoebe's paper and will (hopefully) be reading Crystal's screenplay and they are both so talented and trust me to give good feedback.  Not to mention all of the remarkable support that we're receiving from the people we've talked to about the Cabaret.  I could go on, but I owe Beth a letter, and to make up for the amount of time it's taken me I'm going to try to make it extra good.

      Dear Everyone,  I am posting this here because, well, I want everyone to see it.  (Please note that I am not delusional and do not actually believe that  everyone  reads this, but I think most of the people I wish to address do.)  I do not wish to get involved in any sort of Us Vs. Them thing.  It may appear that I already am, or possibly even that I started it, but I hope to clarify.  I  never  meant anyone any sort of harm or even offense by my wish that the other blog remain private.  The fact is that yes, it is true I do not like Adam.  This is for a personal reason, and has nothing to do with anything else he may or may not have done.  Frankly, I don't care about that.  I also cannot see any reason whatsoever that my dislike of him should mean anything to his friends - I'm sure many of them dislike certain of  my  friends, and I'm not bothered by that as long as I am not drawn into any conflicts.  I understand that things that were said by me and a few other people hurt the feelings of the people those things were said about.  I hate that, because I don't want to hurt anyone.  Well, maybe whoever keeps giving work to Drew Barrymore, but even then only a friendly clip on the jaw.  ...Sorry, my brain went Elsewhere for a moment.  This feels like it felt when (some) people stopped trusting me simply because I was made a moderator at the WD.  Yes, there is an "Exclusive Club" feeling to the whole thing.  No, it does not change who I am.  If people choose to stop liking me, that's fine.  I won't like it, but it's their prerogative.  But please, please, please: have a reason other than "I expressed my feelings and/or did something  I  wanted to do."  I hope that even some of that made sense.  I will try to clarify anything if asked.   --edit--   Please note that I have not banned anyone from the comments, so please ask away if you are so inclined.

      Dear Uterus,  I have no grudge with you, specifically.  Your mechanics, perhaps, but I put that down to a basic design flaw.  The problem I  do  have is the fact that the pain isn't contained.  Is this another design flaw, or have you incited a riot?  Yours, Your (aching) Body   Annika :  Ouch .  Will : I'd buy you a steel uterus, but then we can't have kids.  Annika : Maybe we can find a steel uterus that's very loving.  We laughed for about ten minutes.  I am out of disposable heating pads.  Well, not really  out , but I've only got one.  This is  disasterous.   Bother.

       Reasons Will should work in television (the first in a series)   We watched 7th Heaven tonight.  The show is an absolute train wreck.  It hasn't been funny since before the twins were born, and even then it wasn't very funny.  But really, how could we miss  Lucy's Wedding ?  I mean, surely this is the first time a cabbage patch doll has said "I do."  First, Will suggested that Ruthie should move over to Everwood after 7th Heaven ends and become Delia's arch-nemesis.  That is  funny.   When Mary called from the car, and they made a big deal of not showing who her passenger was (which, incidentally, I never found out), I guessed that it was Matt, and Will said, "Nah, it's Dawson."  That is  hilarious.   After the wedding part, when RevCam introduced the couple, I said, "No!  It's 'I am pleased to present to you,  for the first time , Mr. and Mrs. Whatever.'"  Will's reaction?  "It was the fifth take."   These are the things that just Happen to me.   Today, Will and I began a crash diet, combined with an all-new work-out regime.  The diet is mostly for him, as I am only five pounds over my ideal weight, not to mention a vegetarian*.  I'd  die  if I cut down too far on carbs and fat.  But I digress.  This morning, I did 30 leg lifts and 10 crunches.  It's not very impressive unless you know just how much physical activity is a normal part of my day.  Actually, I was quite pleased, because even that small amount of exercise helped my back, which has been really bad lately.  (There's a story about a car accident in it for any of you who are very bored.)  After eating a vaguely healthy lunch, which followed a few hours online trying to catch up on everything I ignored this weekend, I did a load of laundry.  It was done around the time Will got home, and I noticed when I collected it that all but 2 of the washers were free.  Taking it as A Sign, I had Will help me carry the rest of the laundry downstairs.  While it was in the machine, I made dinner - salmon with ginger and brocolli with soy sauce.  Man, was it good!  (For those keeping track, a lot of this happened during 7th Heaven, and we were collecting the clean, dry laundry when Mary and her Mystery Passenger arrived.  I'm still betting it was Matt.)  After Everwood, we folded the laundry.  By that, I mean I sat on the couch and Will put all of his work clothes on hangers.  It appears that I somehow managed to shrink some of our clothing.  I washed and dried everything on the exact same cycles I always use (warm water wash, cold rinse, permanent press dry).  I haven't tested anything, though Will tried on a pair of jeans and they were tighter than usual.  Most of the clothes look fine, so I'm thinking perhaps the smaller of the two loads of blacks just got over-dried.  Still, it would be  so ironic  if I shrunk our clothes on the very day that we started trying to lose weight/get into shape.   In other news...   Was today a bank holiday?  I didn't get any mail, and while I can accept the possibility that no one loves me, I cannot believe that my creditors have stopped writing.  *not really, but close enough.

      It occured to me today that I rarely wear jewelry, but own quite a bit.  I had just returned from the airport, and was bored senseless with the apartment all to myself.  So, I got out some of my jewelry boxes and hunted through.  I am now wearing 3 rings.  I found several of my favorite earings, but alas my right earlobe has closed up.  How this happened after having it pierced for 14 years is anyone's guess.  Oddly, I think the second set of holes is still open.  I've only had those for around 10 years.  And...I'm outta here.

      I finally have seen  Ginger Snaps.   Unfortunately, we watched it unaware that K cannot stand any sort of gore or blood, so even though it didn't strike me as being any more than remotely bloody, it upset her immensely.  That is  Not Good.   The movie, though, was pretty all right.  I thought the pacing in the second half, and particularly the end, was far too slow.  It kept doing the "This is going to be the end...no, wait!  Foiled again... This  is going to be the end...Nope!" thing, which got old.  And the final part, in the house, took too long.  But the performances were outstanding and I thoroughly enjoyed it.  I haven't got much more to say.  My stomach's been upset off and on all week, so I am just staying awake until I feel well enough to go to bed.

      I've added several people to The List.  In the interest of not playing favorites or hurting feelings, I'm going to keep it to myself.  Rest assured, though, that I'm feeling much better than I was two days ago.  It's raining, or was minutes ago.  LA is so strange.  We had a fantastic weekend.  As usual, it lasted about three days too few, but I can deal.  We are working on a  fabulous  project.  I'm so excited that I start thinking about it the minute I wake up, a time usually reserved for trying to remember where the coffee filters are kept (right next to the coffee pot).  Anyone with a background in theater (of any sort), a lot of time on their hands, and a terribly creative nature (any two of the three will do) should contact me if they want to play with us.  I should look into whether show ideas can be copyrighted.  K is watching a cartoon movie (I can't see the TV, so I don't know which one), and I think I recognize David Spade's voice.  That is just sad.  Can anyone recommend any  good  Burlesque on video?   Tease-a-rama  might not cut it.  I mean to check Dita's site, but other than that it's google or nothing.  My house really needs to be cleaned.  Badly.  At least the bathroom sink is clean.

I'm reasonably certain that there are about a dozen other people who will make it to the list, so don't panic if you aren't one of those three.  At least, don't panic  yet.

       It burns!  It burns!   I chopped a hot pepper for my lunch.  I washed my hands very thoroughly.  And yet, after touching my nose just a teensy bit, it is on  fire.   No more spicy food for me.  Maybe I will stop cooking altogether, in fact.  The good news is that after I put a little tea tree oil on my nose, the burn went from BLINDING PAIN to "ouch."  OUCH!  Damn it.  Now my tongue is burning.  At least I've found the culprit.  Note to self: 1. Stop biting your nails.  2. Invest in a nail brush.   In other news...

      K and I used to watch  The Journey of Natty Gann , like, all the time.  Tonight we watched "I Only Have Eyes for You" and I made her guess who the guest star was that she ought to recognize.  She didn't get it at first, but when I said, "Are you callin' my dad a commie?" she got it  instantly.   We're definitely sisters.  In other news, I think I need to come to terms with the concept that I am most likely allergic to milk.  My tummy is so sore right now, after a huge mug of hot cocoa.  That'll teach me to make it from scratch.  Those packets have hardly any milk in them, I bet.  Bleh.  Tomorrow I have to actually  get up  so that I can drive Will to work and have the car to take K to the beach.  I use the term "beach" lightly - I'll most likely take her to the 3rd St. Promenade and we'll just wander down to the pier.  She wants to see the ocean.  Since I haven't seen it in almost a year, and I  live in Los Angeles,  I think it's only fair.  Also,  Angel  was watchable.  Not a great episode, but it's actually got me speculating, which hasn't happened in ages.  Not really since I decided months ago that Cordy was evil.

It got very interesting when the woman from US Airways asked for the credit card, and I gave her the info, and she asked to talk to  me , thinking  I  was  K , and I (me) had to give permission for the card to be charged.  Naturally, I handed the phone to K, mouthing, "You're me" and gesturing wildly.  I think I need to lie down...

       With apologies to Katy and Simon...   I'm sorry, but am I the only person on earth who actually paid attention during  Brotherhood of the Wolf ?  That was the  worst  movie ever.  (I reserve the right to exaggerate slightly.)  From start to finish, it was an exercise in stupid trick photography and a lesson in  how not to tell a story .  Yuck.  Also, between it and  The Musketeer , I have seen two too many movies with charming crossover fight choreography.   Dear filmmakers,  please use Chinese characters if you use Chinese martial arts in a  period piece .  And for the love of god, if there is mud  everywhere , don't be so afraid to get your actors dirty.  Thanks.  I'm being terribly unfocused in expressing my dislike for this movie.  I'm sorry - it gets me really worked up that so many people liked it when it is such a piece of crap.  But I still love you guys anyway.  Promise.

       Intelligence cannot be measured by knowledge.   Rather, it should be measured by an individual's willingness and effort to expand his knowledge as he sees fit, and put his knowledge to use daily.  Whenever I begin to feel that I am not  doing anything with my life , I read either  The Day I Became an Autodidact  or  The Teenage Liberation Handbook , both of which are books about taking control of your own education.  Both books begin with the assumption that education and schooling have nothing to do with one another, a concept I adore.  After an exchange with Angie (who, by the way, I consider extremely intelligent, even if I don't agree with her on anything), I began to question whether I was living up to my own expectations.  Because I'd given "The Bible" (Grace Llewelyn's  Teenage Liberation Handbook ) to Lauren last year, feeling that at 14 she needed it far more than I, I settled down with Kendall Hailey to read about her life as an autodidact once again.  As usual, I am inspired to greatness.  In answer to that inspiration, I took a long bath and forgot about bills and paperwork for an hour.  When I left the haven of the bathroom, I wondered briefly at myself for getting so worked up over a filthy bathroom sink yet refusing to clean it, and then started to think about my short film.  It only exists on paper so far, but I've had my first semi-professional feedback and am still reeling three days later.  (To the few of you who read this and have also read my script, I value your feedback immensely and have already made some changes based on your suggestions; all of the notes I received this week were about parts of the story that none of you touched on, so I feel that your comments were invaluable.)  Three people read the script, which I had sent to work with Will under a false name.  I assumed, correctly, that my readers were be more honest if they didn't know it was mine.  Two people thought it was hilarious and urged Will to read it, giving notes on things that I definitely agree could be improved.  My favorite feedback came from an intern at Will's office who hated the screenplay, feeling that the story was unclear.  He is a film student, and of course believes that there is a proper way to tell a story and if it lacks certain elements it is flawed.  My script lacks every one of those elements, and I could not be more delighted to be told that.    Gertrude Stein said once (and Kendall Hailey quoted) that she wrote for herself and strangers.  This could only possibly be said to be true of me if those strangers are of the zombie-film-lover pursuasion already.  This is, I think, slightly peculiar of me, since I don't even watch horror movies very often (unless they are made by Peter Jackson or star Bruce Campbell), but Will has said that it is my lack of knowledge of "the rules" that makes me a good genre writer, and he is the only critic whose opinion matters to me in the long run.  He may not be a stranger, but he is certainly strange, in the genius way.  If anyone has a few thousand dollars and is harboring a secret desire to make short films, call me.  I've got a great project for you to invest in, as soon as I finish some minor rewrites.

       Shock and Awe come home?   I am suspicious of anything that is done in the name of National Security, since it seems that any action that has to be justified that way was purposely not done through the proper channels.  There's a reason for those channels, and when the so-called leaders of our country decide to call all of the shots on their own, I get very nervous.  I mean - things run poorly enough (IMO) when they are taken care of properly.  There's a reason we keep yelling at all the other countries about being a democracy; I'd like to  stay  a democracy, even a parady of one, and avoid living in a police state.  I'm hardly a conspiracy theorist.  I don't buy into most of the "the government is out to get me" mentality.  I'm even fairly certain that racial profiling isn't all bad.  But I am starting to freak out.  According to  urlLink Friends of Meigs  and the  urlLink Aircraft Owners and Pilot's Association , Mayor Daley hired bulldozers to destroy the runway at Meigs Field (Chicago).  His excuse is homeland security.  16 planes were stranded because of his actions.  In an effort to form an unbiased opinion, I ran a google search on the matter.  From the Chicago Sun-Times I found  urlLink this  from today.  After registering at the Chicago Tribune's site, I found some well-hidden stories in the archives.   urlLink This  seems to be most relevant, as it is Daley's side of the story.  At a glance, my conclusion is that Daley is a moron.  My mother, a pilot, is having nightmares over this.  Why is no one doing anything about this fascist?

       There is something about a blank page...   I seem to have overburdened myself with writing ideas.  As usual, the outcome is that I am overwhelmed and not working on anything.  Damn my brain!  Just a few days ago, I started work on an adaptation that I've wanted to do for literally years and years.  I was very excited to finally be putting it on paper (well, my computer), and am taking my time about it because the source material isn't going anywhere.   This morning I woke up with a perfect picture in my mind of how to adapt my favorite novel ever.  I had until today thought it un-adaptable, but now I  know  that it can be done, and well at that.  So now I have two adaptations that I want to write (coincidentally, of books by the same author), in addition to all of my half-finished projects that are lying about collecting dust.  A few minutes ago I opened up Final Draft, thinking that I would write down the opening scene as I'd pictured it.  I looked at the blank screen and simply froze.  The ideas didn't go anywhere, I just didn't have anything to type.  Performance anxiety, or something.  But I know that if I take out a yellow legal pad and start scribbling, it will happen.  And then I will have to type it all up later, and that will be irritating.  Would anyone like to volunteer to be my amanuensis?

      Today (technically yesterday) I got a library card.  Yay!  I can cross one thing off my (nonexistant) list.  The man who gave me the card was very funny.  There must be a script that they have to memorize for card applications, on How To Use Your New Library Card.  It was reasonably informative, but it seemed to be information aimed at small children.  Not in a patronizing way, though.  It turns out that the local branch of the LA Public Library has a lousy fiction selection (at least in English - the Korean section was  enormous , but I don't know how much of it was fiction), and only a semi-decent non-fiction section, but that's OK because I can borrow from another library if there is something I want.  For today, I only brought home a  New Yorker  collection.  ( Talk of the Town , before you ask, Phoebe.)  There is a decent VHS and DVD selection as well, which is good.  I've done yoga every day this week, which is surely a record for me in regard to sticktoitiveness.  (Should that be hyphenated?)  Will says that tomorrow he will do it with me.  I am trying to figure out how to videotape this, as it will be  An Event.   In other news, my computer still hates me.  For a while there I thought maybe it didn't, but it was just preparing a new and inventive way to hurt my feelings.  Incidentally (alternate paragraph intro: "In other-other news"), whenever I get noirbettie.com up and running as a proper website, I am considering doing it as a webzine.  I don't know why.  Good thing I did today: sent some Good Flight mojo to Wil Wheaton.  I think I am going to order his book as a birthday present to myself.  Er, if I get any birthday money.  I currently haven't got any money of any variety.  Thus endeth a random peek into my brain.

      I'm thinking of taking out my belly button ring.  Like, permanently.  It's a tough decision, because I've had it for 7 years, and I like to have it there to fiddle with.  On the other hand, though, it still gets massively infected about once a year, and the scar is getting uglier and uglier, rather than fainter as I'd been hoping.  It's coming down from an infection as we speak, and I think when it stops dripping goop (YUCK), it's got to go.  Here's hoping that once the jewelry is out the scar fades at least a bit.  If not, it will look like I have 2 belly buttons.  YUCK again.  I think it is high time that I make a list of Things I Want To Accomplish In My First Quarter-Century, seeing as I've only got about a month left.  I'm sure that there is a list a mile long of things I thought I'd have done by now, but lucky for me my memory is utter crap.  List forthcoming, if I remember.

       A day of good news.   First I discovered, completely by accident, that Ridley Scott really does love me, and is in fact releasing a special edition DVD of  Black Hawk Down.   (OK,  he  is not releasing it, but had it never been released, as I feared, it would have been his fault.)  Not only that, but it will be out in a few weeks!  I've got to scrape together some cash, and quickly.  Then, this evening, I opened my email to find a 'newsletter' from a gal called Andrea.  This newsletter contained the   West Coast tour dates   of one Mr.   Andrew Bird  .  Including a show at The Derby, where I have always wanted to go.  If Slim Cessna has any New York shows while I am there (which looks to be the second-to-last week of June, but is still subject to change), I will  know  that I've died and gone to heaven.

      I can't seem to find any screencaps from  Dead/Alive .  Surely they exist, but... *cries*   I just want a picture of the monkey.  Incidentally, I wrote  Pretty Girl  long before I saw  Dead/Alive , and was horrified when the mum is doing her makeup and pulls off a bit of skin.  When I finally make my movie, people will think I stole that bit!  At least mine is much more low-key.  Oooh, I should look under its original name.  Duh.   ...Hooray for IMDB.  So far, I haven't found monkey pics, but I did find a few of Selwin.  And that is almost as good.  On a related (I swear) note, does anyone have recommendations for decent web hosting companies?  As many of you have probably noticed, I haven't updated my site in forever, because I simply cannot deal with geocities.  I've been (laboriously) learning html, and I think I can fake it well enough to re-create my site from the ground up and even make some minor improvements, but I am not sure who to host it with.  If I can just find a host and figure out FTP, I will be GOLDEN.

      Will and I watched  Re-Animator  this evening.  It was worth it to see Jeffrey Combs so young.  As the credits were rolling, Will did the dishes.  I was half paying attention when the credit for Intern Production Assistants came up -- and guess whose name was there?   Tim fucking Minear.   I checked IMDB (unreliable at best), and they have him listed as an Assistant Director.  Not bloody likely.  Will's going to check the official channels tomorrow.  I don't know if it's because it was made in 1985 or because it was his (Stuart Gordon's) first movie or just because, but I didn't really like it, and it certainly didn't compare to  Dagon .  Being me, though, at the same time I totally loved it.  My exact words when it ended were, "Well, that was craptacular."  I meant it in a good way.  I  think.   Anyway, I am seriously considering watching  Bride of Re-Animator.

      I was thinking of going a full two weeks without an entry, but then I figured that no one would even be checking in by then.  As it is, I hope there are one or two readers still peeking in here occasionally.  It has, after all, only been 11 days.  (Oh, dude.  And about 11 hours.  Hee!)  At first I was going to make an entry after Will's father left, detailing the visit, and I started writing it but it turned out to be too personal.  Maybe I will post an edited version at some point.  My most recent plan was to make a brilliant entry about the weekend in Vegas.  I got as far as planning the first three sentences, which I shall now attempt to recreate for you:   We were somewhere around Barstow on the edge of the desert when the  drugs began to take hold  traffic began to slow down.  I remember saying something like "I feel a bit lightheaded;  maybe you should drive....  Why aren't these cars moving?"  And suddenly there was a terrible roar all around us and the sky was full of what looked like huge bats, all swooping and screeching and diving around the car, which was going about  a hundred  ten miles an hour  with the top down  to Las Vegas.   My cleverness knows no bounds.  So anyway, we went to Vegas and spent a pretty damn fantastic evening with Pat and Stephanie and Becky and some guy with bleached hair who kind of attached himself to us, like a leech, but was kind enough to pay for dinner and a good portion of the beer, so we put up with him.  We also spent quite a bit of time talking with Saren and Harper.  Saren is still my very favorite person on the planet, but Harper is really moving up in the ranks.  Perhaps it's because she's started talking more, but she seems to have miles more personality than last time we saw her, and she had an awful lot then.  My favorite thing that she does is this weird shrugging thing that I can't really describe, but I guess Pat and Stephanie will know what I'm talking about.  Deciphering her speech could be a full-time job, maybe at the UN (I'm certain that she could  devour, conquer, or at least rule one nation, possibly more).  My score of the weekend was "boo-uh-uh," which was very obviously "beautiful," but Will couldn't understand.  My sister and I both said "boo-fuh-uh" when we were little.  Or anyway, one of us did, and I don't remember which.  I have several other things to write about, but I also have a screenplay that is coming along well which I'd like to work on, and several things to read, some of which require feedback, so I'm going to end here.

      Last night was just  weird.   I've never felt so ill without either being ill or being drunk.  Let me back up a bit.  I spent the entire afternoon on the telephone with someone I've never met.  This was definitely my longest WD phone call to date, and one of the most delightful.  I nearly dropped the telephone after hanging up and looking at the display, which informed me I'd been talking for 242 minutes.  Immediately after hanging up, I got in the bathtub.  Will got home a few minutes later and hopped in with me immediately.  (I lie.  He did not hop, and it was not immediate; he took off his clothes first.)  After the bath we got dressed and went over to Jenn's house.  She'd made tortilla soup, which is my new favorite food.    Unfortunately, something about it didn't agree with me.  Maybe it was the huge portions, of which I had 2.  Maybe it was the richness, or the spiciness.  All I know is that about 5 minutes after I finished eating I had terrible stomach pain, had heartburn, was dizzy, and thought I was going to die.  It took Will and Jenn both to get me home, where I took off my pretty clothes and put on sweatpants.  Then I spent about half an hour sitting in front of the toilet.  I was not able to vomit.  This whole time, my back was in terrible pain as well.  Whenever my stomach is upset, my back ties itself up in knots.  Finally, when I decided that if I hadn't puked by now I just wasn't going to, Will remembered the heating pad we have for  his  back and carefully wrapped it around my waist.  I felt better almost immediately.  Then we watched the Crappiest Television Ever.  First up was The Bachelor: the Women Tell All.  What a bunch of stupid cunts.  Then was Extreme Makeovers.  Ahhh, plastic surgery.  Good times.  Around midnight I felt well enough to go to bed.  I also felt morally superior to everyone on ABC.  And hey, it was only slightly worse than Tuesday, when a shelf fell on me.

      Dear Santa,  Is it to early to start asking for presents?  I've been a very good girl, at least today.  First, I would like  urlLink this  for Will.  I will be totally upfront about it and tell you that I fully intend to also use it for myself, but it is  mostly  for him.  Second, I'd like  urlLink this .  Thanks a million.  And thanks to  urlLink Mark Hemmings  for his beautiful snow monkey photos.

       Weekends suck.   They're all ordering pizza and eating until you nearly explode, and sleeping in, and drinking coffee with Will, and seeing X2 with Cassie, and going out for sushi with Cassie, and Cassie paying, and having leftover pizza for every meal that isn't sushi, and staying up late watching Trading Spaces, and sleeping in some more, and telling mom I love her, and finding places to put the stuff I thought we'd never find places for, and watching the 90210 Reunion show and laughing, and doing laundry so your favorite sweatpants are clean and smell nice, and taking longs baths with Will, and reading trashy novels...when suddenly, they end.  Just like that, tomorrow is Monday and Will has to go to work and I have to take care of paperwork, and sure, there's a new episode of Everwood, but who cares about Ephram falling in the water really, when real life starts up again so abruptly?

        Man , is it windy.   Today I went to the Beverly Hills Courthouse and picked up the paperwork to sue Will's old landlords in small claims court.  We are entitled to sue for the amount of the security deposit plus  twice  the amount for "statutory damages," whatever those are.  I guess I ought to find out between now and the court date (which will be assigned when we bring in the filled-out paperwork).  If we win, I am going to cash the check so that Will and I can do a silly dance and sing "We got two thousand dollars, we got two thousand dollars" and then buy The Guitar.  (Alternately, we may  not  do our Wayne and Garth impressions.)  If we do not win, I am going to have seventeen fits and forty-three tantrums, because the law is absolutely on our side.  In other news, I think I might take a bath.

      I am like a giggling 5-year-old with Halloween candy right now, and it's all because of the  Angel  season finale last night.  For the convenience of my readers who have not yet seen it, I present spoiler tags.  [ spoiler  for Angel  4.22  "Home" with speculation for Buffy episodes  7.21  and  7.22 , and spoilers up to  7.20  "Touched" and the preview for  7.21 ]  First of all,  holy crap.   That was a truly excellent episode.  I won't say that it made up entirely for the mess of season 4 as a whole, but I will say that I am no longer on the fence: I LOVE this show (again).  I ought to clean my apartment over the next few days, but I am far more likely to watch season 2 of Angel and grin a lot.  (Note to self: compromise.  Listen to season 2 while you clean.)  All of the characters finally feel like themselves again.  And it really says something that I loved Lilah, who I am known for complaining about loudly.  Tim Minear, I would like to volunteer to have your children.  You are the only person who has written a truly great episode all year.  I really, really miss Firefly, but this kind of makes up for that heartbreak.  Now if only you weren't moving on to a new series.  So, about Buffy.  Angel has an amulet, which will give him a reason to go to Sunnydale.  Fine, we saw him in the preview for 7.21, and I was spoiled for Boringanus's guest appearance anyway.  I am going to speculate that the amulet/vial/whatever it is will somehow make the First corporeal, and that the scythe/axe/whatever will allow Buffy to kill it.  OK, not  kill , but banish.  I think it will be banished from this dimension.  This fits in with what I have been told about the Fray comic books, but as I've never read them I may be off a bit.  I also hope very much that Angel will appear as both himself and the First.  Just because.  (Plus, that would possibly cut down on Buffy-as-the First screentime, and I fucking hate that.)  Back to Angel for a second - I curled up into a tiny ball at the end and burrowed into Will's lap.  Giving up Connor was the ultimate expression of love.   However , it does make me wonder just how many "secrets" Angel has to carry.  He is the only one who remembers his day with Buffy as a human, he is the only one who remembers his son, and I'm fairly sure he knows about Dawn too.  Poor fucker.  John had only one complaint about the Angel finale - Lilah's comment about Cordelia getting a manicure.  People in comas cannot wear nail polish.  I made the excuse that a manicure does not automatically include polish.  [end spoiler]  I have many more thoughts, but my head is simply reeling and I will have to think more about all of this later.

      On Jenn's recommendation, I joined the forums at  urlLink The Deadlands Resource Center .  I immediately made a reply to one of her posts, calling her a slut.  Good times.  I find it interesting that so many male roleplayers post about girls not 'getting it.'  Roleplaying is a  very  female thing - which is not to say that it's un-masculine, but that creating and playing a character is something that anyone might enjoy.  Now, I'm not talking about (A)D+D.  I hate that game.  I'm talking about  good  RPGs.  By which I of course mean Deadlands.  I've tried some others, and  meh.   Then again, our Deadlands campaign is probably better suited to the world of Marvel...  In other news, I have  almost  perfected the art of grievously injuring my enemies using only the powers of my mind.  And no, I'm not talking about RPGs anymore.

      I've got it in my head that I need to paint all of my furniture red.  By "all," what I really mean is the 4 matching bookcases, the "matching" IKEA chair, and possibly the unfinished pine bookcase that is desperately in need of repair from cat-claw damage.  Also maybe the computer desk, even though I bought stain for it already.  I don't have any red paint.  My shoulder is  killing  me.  I need an in-house masseuse.  I've been going through photographs of myself, and decided (again) that I should be in pin-ups.

      Will had an appointment this morning with his Other Girlfriend.  She is, of course, his dental hygienist.  She shot his gums full of novacaine and scraped plaque and other nasty stuff from them.  Apparently, it sounds more gross than it is.  Anyway, he took the rest of the day off work, expecting to be mush-mouthed the whole time, but was actually fine by the time I got up (11:00 or so), so we had a lovely day of playing hookie together.  We went to the Westside Pavilion, which is, alas, a mall.  We looked around K-B Toys, which had an apalling selection, and Barnes & Noble, which had ten billion graphic novels we want but cannot afford, and assorted other stores.  Then we had lunch at Poquito Mas, my favorite "fast" Mexican food joint.  This eveing Jenn came by and we played "Beat the Geek," which is nothing like the cable game show.  Now I am trying to upload photos to Yahoo!, because my computer won't allow me to save them on a disk.  Stupid computer.  The upload is not looking promising.  Stupid Yahoo!.  Punctuation following Yahoo! looks strange.  Today is (well, technically  yesterday was ) Cinqo De Mayo.  I did not get in nearly enough Mexican jokes, though I did inadvertantly eat their (LA-style) cuisine.  Frankly, I just really like burritos.   (note: I am in no way prejudiced against Mexicans, or anyone else for that matter.  I hope that goes without saying, but am saying it anyway, just because.  I just like making fun of people.)   My pictures have still not uploaded.

      We saw X-2 on Friday night.  I was blown away.  Literally.  We saw it at Grauman's Chinese, and the sound system there is unreal.  I'll write up a full review in the next couple of days - for now, let's just leave at  "Wow."   Will is downstairs surrounded by comic books.  Alas, none of them are X-Men comics.  I'm fairly sure we have some, but they're in Pittsburgh or something.  Will's father is coming to visit in less than two weeks.  I'm not  nervous , but slightly concerned about entertaining him.  This will be the first time we've seen each other since I moved back in with his son, effectively saying "Fuck you if you don't like it."  He and I get on just fine, but I want to make sure that he has a good time.  It's my own backwards way of getting back at him for not accepting me at first.  I am so weird.

      Last night I took Phoebe to the ballet.  Pictures are not yet uploaded, because Yahoo! is being a total pain in the butt.  **edit:  urlLink photos  (+ monkeys)**  The ballet (Swan Lake) was wonderful.  It was yet another new choreography, and as usual the ballet suffered for it, but the set was improved immensely (to the point that it almost overshadowed some of the dancing) and of course the music is fantastic no matter what.  I cannot stress enough that the  dancing  was excellent, but the  choreography  lacking.  The best illustration of this is an observation I made in the first act.  A male dancer had a solo, after which the audience applauded.  This is absolutely normal, except that the solo required nothing applause-worthy.  Female ballet dancers (ballerinas) are known for many, many special moves.  Male ballet dancers have exactly three things going for them: A marvelously toned ass, a huge bulge, and the ability to leap spectacularly high.  This particular solo consisted of the gentleman in question spinning around about three times.  I'm terribly sorry, but any ballerina in the  corps de ballet  can spin around six times, with her off leg held up higher,  en pointe , and smile while doing it.  If the male dancers are to impress us, they must jump really high in the air.  That is just How It Is.  There is a short piece in Act II for the four cygnets.  I seem to remember thinking that the dancers were actually much younger, perhaps ballet students.  In my recollection, they ranged in size from left (a tall girl en pointe) to right (a teensy girl in a different tutu and regular ballet slippers).  Now, it is entirely possible that I am right about the height thing but it was merely a case of two drastically different-sized soloists, but I suspect that I am right in my memory and the number has just changed.  All of the dances for the  corps , that is, the swans' group numbers, were phenomenal.  There is nothing more beautiful than thirty women in white moving in unison onstage - the Dance of the Snowflakes is another favorite, or it was until Kevin McKenzie got his hands on it.  Paloma Herrera danced the roles of Odette and Odile, and Marcelo Gomes danced the role of Siegfried.  Paloma was wonderful, if a bit overly dramatic in her gestures (has ballet always been that way?), but poor Marcelo didn't have an opportunity to show that he could dance until the end of act three.  I must say, though, that once he did -  boy , can that boy jump.  Speaking of jumping, I burst into tears when Odette threw herself in the lake, and didn't stop crying until well after the curtain calls.  I wonder if Phoebe noticed.  (Incidentally, I suspect that curtain calls would not take  quite  as long, at least to get to the solo bows, if it were not such a long journey up to the stage for the conductor.)  After the show, Phoebe and I had a cup of coffee at the Starbucks in Barnes & Noble.  We meant to go to a 'real' place, but that was very convenient.  Also, neither of us had coffee - I had chai and she had hot cocoa with extra whipped cream.  It was very nice.  We talked about stress, diseases, and zombies.  Voudon zombies, not cinematic zombies (though of course there was a brief detour in that direction).  This entry is probably longer now than the ballet, which has four acts, a prologue, and an apothesis.  Time to go.  P.S. The price of culture (besides dumbing us all down) is apparently $90.

      Apparently some asshole posted a MAJOR Harry Potter spoiler and my sister saw it.  I don't know  where  said spoiler is posted, so needless to say I am going to throw away the computer and lock myself in a dark room Just In Case.  My sister hasn't read the book yet because she is waiting for her copy to arrive from England; I haven't read the book yet because it weighs 40 pounds or something and I don't feel like carrying it around.  I might buy a copy to read on the plane going back to LA.  I don't know.  All I know is that if I find out who dies before reading it I will buy an automatic weapon and use it without reserve.  What's funny about all this is that I have not read  Return of the King , as I am waiting until after I see the movie to read the book (I'm weird, I know, but I don't want to be disappointed in the movie), but I don't mind some spoilers for that.  I mean, maybe it's just because ROTK was published 50 years ago and it's My Own Fault that I've not yet read it, but still.  I actually  asked  Will to tell me if anyone dies, and to be specific.  Of course, this was only because I was tired of crying over Boromir and figured I just wouldn't watch the other movies/read the rest of the book if anyone else I love died.  Come to think of it, I missed some major details when I grilled him about it, so there ought to be some surprises still.  In conclusion, I need to take a decongestant.

      Holy smokes!  I've been using my dad's computer all week.  It's a Macintosh PowerBook (laptop), and it's on a cable modem.  I don't believe I shall ever be able to go back to dial-up.  Happily, I think I get home in time to take advantage of a "sale" on SBC Yahoo DSL, which I hope is decent service.  It has to be better than my MSN dial-up, and it's only $6 more a month if I order by Monday.  (Yes, we are drastically over-paying for our dial-up, but it is almost worth it for the convenience of not having to change our service.)  Also, I like this computer.  I mentioned this elsewhere, so apologies to those who've already read it in another form.  I don't understand Macs at all, and I think that it is my (somewhat decent) understanding of PCs that causes me to at times hate them violently.  My theory is that if I had a computer I didn't understand, it would  seem  superior, even though PCs probably are, at least for what I use them for.  However, I haven't got $2000 to invest in anything, so I will not have an opportunity to put my theorioes into practice.  Tonight Phoebe and I will be attending Swan Lake at the Met Opera House.  It is American Ballet Theater's third-to-last performance of the season, and I am excited.   --Drastic Change of Subject Alert--   On Tuesday I had dinner with Nova.  As far as I know, nobody reading this knows Nova.  She and I grew up in the same town and attended the same college, but did not meet until a few years after college, at a mutual friend's funeral to be precise.  She and Will and her boyfriend, Erik, all attended Antioch at the same time, but she and Erik had already graduated when I got there.  She has a Master's from Columbia and he is almost finished with his (from NYU).  She tells me that, though they would like to be permanent New York residents, they are thinking of moving to LA for a year or two so that Erik can explore the film industry.  He is currently working on a feature here in NY, and has made several shorts of his own.  Nova is a writer, and works as a copy editor for a publishing house.  I told her about some of the stuff I've written, and she seemed genuinely enthusiastic.  She wants to see the children's story, as the company she works for publishes children's books, and she would also like to read my "grown up" stories, and thinks that she will be able to suggest literary magazines for me to submit them to.  This is all very neat and exciting, and a bit odd because I am so used to not doing anything with my writing.  It's 11:11.  As good a time as any to sign off.

       the subway is so depressing.   My father is very much like me in many respects.  For example, he writes down things that he sees that are striking to him in one way or another.  This is from a sign that an elderly man he saw in the subway was carrying:  My daughter died My wife is sick I lost my job Please help me  It made me indescribably sad, but also it made me angry.  The other day, on the airplane, I read  How To Be Good  by Nick Hornby.  It is perhaps the story of a marriage and perhaps an emotionally manipulative attempt at getting people to look at the world differently.  Either way, I have been thinking of myself as a Bad Person every time I ride the subway.  But am I automatically a bad person if I do not give money to the homeless?  Am I OK as long as I do not have new clothes from the Gap despite the fact that my closet is already full?  That is to say, am I a bad person if I keep my money, or am I still a good person as long as I really need the money that I keep?  (I am not making myself any clearer, am I?)  So now the question is whether to allow myself to be sad and accept that I am human just for that, or get angry and beat myself up over not looking at The Big Picture.  (Not to mention the fact that I have new clothes from the Gap.)

      Last night I did  not  buy the new Harry Potter book.  I also did not buy the complete short stories of Angela Carter, or any number of amusing-looking dating guides, but I think it is safe to say that  Order of the Phoenix  was the most tempting, and I persevered.  I am so sleepy that I had to look up persevere in the dictionary to see a) if it is the word I meant and b) how to spell it.  Despite appearances, it is a perfectly decent hour - I am on the east coast and my blog is set to Pacific time.  Nevertheless, I am sleepy.  Strange bed and all that.

      Thanks so much to everyone who's responded so far to my last entry.  This sort of discussion really thrills me!  In the hopes of keeping it going, I offer the following:  "As for me, I knew nothing except what I gathered from  Time  magazine, but as I inched sluggishly along the treadmill of the Maycomb County school system, I could not help receiving the impression that I was being cheated out of something.  Out of what I knew not, yet I did not believe that twelve years of unrelieved boredom was exactly what the state had in mind for me."  ~ To Kill a Mockingbird  by Harper Lee

      OK, I know I've been updating this like mad today, but I keep thinking of things to say.  I just found a reference on Amazon to the Marilyn Monroe film  Niagara  - on a  film noir  list!  Are these people insane?  That is the  worst movie ever  and does not in any way resemble  noir.   Believe you me, there is plenty of crappy  film noir , but  Niagara  is in its very own class of Crap.  ...Then again,  Fargo , and excellent non- noir  picture, is also on the list.  Maybe the person who put it together just didn't read the assignment.

       I have a dirty mind.   What else is new?  So I was at amazon.com browsing documentaries.  I came across one called  urlLink Porn Star: the Legend of Ron Jeremy .  The "uncut and unrated version."  My first thought?   Uncut???  He's circumcised!   And then I started missing porn.    Speaking of my viewing habits, I am looking at the Cowboy Bebop box sets and trying to decide which kidney to sell.  Also, I need to go to an office supply store.

      I've come to a further conclusion that people slightly younger than myself (by people I mean  girls , because I don't know very many boys) are doing much better culturally than my generation, as are people slightly older than me.  It seems to be primarily we 25-year-olds who are losers (I use the term in a friendly manner, I assure you).  Oh well.  I made something resembling puttanesca sauce for dinner last night, and I am now eating the leftovers for breakfast/lunch (also called "brunch" by civilized people), against my better judgment.  I will probably make it again in the future, but without the anchovies, because they gave me gas.  Unless the garlic or tomatoes are responsible, but I prefer to blame the nasty little fishies.  It's cold(ish) and overcast for the millionth day in a row, and it is starting to depress me.  I  like  this weather, but for crying out loud, I live in  Los Angeles.

       My boyfriend, the Unschooler.   Last night, Will asked me to choose a book for him to read.  His only specification was that it not be a biography of Nathanael West.  I gleefully brought him  The Day I Became An Autodidact  and shyly asked if it was all right.  Are my adverbs conflicting?  I don't care, it was how it was.  Anyway, he read about a chapter before we went to bed, where he switched to one of the books in the  Series of Unfortunate Events , which he reads to me every night.  We finished the first book last night.  And I could not be further off topic if I tried.  What was I talking about?  Oh, hell, doesn't matter.  I've just read a Miss Manners column, which made me think of something else.  But first, I shall quote my favorite response:  Dear Miss Manners, Is it incorrect to have candles on a buffet table in the daytime?  Gentle Reader,  No, only to light them.   I am too lazy to look up the html for an indented quotation.  Anyway, reading Miss Manners reminded me of something I was thinking about earlier: the women of my generation do not practice any of the traditional hobbies that women of previous generations did.  Presumably this is because we have jobs and equality and all that, so knitting and bridge aren't our only options, but...Well, I think it's a shame.  Not that I don't  want  jobs and equality and all that junk, but that I appreciate tradition in some aspects, and wish there were more renaissance ladies out there.  I can only think of one person my age (among my friends) who knits.  I can crochet and sew, but I don't often.  I know I'm not expressing myself very well, but I think I can go on to say that this is only a small part of my dissatisfaction with modern American culture.  I know very few people with a good appreciation for opera (I include myself here - never really understood it), or ballet, or really any form of art or entertainment that has been around for more than 100 years.  Not to mention that people think there is an actual cocktail called an apple martini!  I'm terribly sorry, gentle reader, but it is only a martini if it is gin and vermouth.  My goodness, don't I sound grumpy?  I swear I'm not.  Just scatter-brained.

      I have seen Andrew Bird play live four times.  The first time, Nora O'Connor was playing at the California Clipper, my favorite Chicago bar, and he accompanied her (on fiddle, of course).  I got very drunk and made an ass of myself after the show.  Let us not speak of it.  The second time was at the Hideout street festival two summers ago, where he performed with the Bowl Of Fire, including Nora and with back-up vocals by Kelly Hogan.  (In your face, Beth-bitch!)  I was standing right up against the stage, practically on top of the monitor.    The third time was, until last night, my favorite.  It was crowded and horrible in [insert name of club], but Will was with me, at one of the few shows in Chicago that he was able to accompany me to.  Last night was divine.  I've never seen Andrew solo before, though I've heard one of the songs before (two, actually, since one is a re-working of a Bowl of Fire song).  The Derby is every bit as wonderful as it looks on film, and I wore a top that I've had for some time but never worn before.  It was quite chilly, though, so I kept my jacket on.  Perhaps it's because I'm used to clubs in cities where smoking is allowed, but the air circulation in there was  too  good.  Brrrr!  There was an odd moment entering the club, when tthe doorman checked our IDs and asked if we would ever hang out with a 19-year old.  I said, without thinking, "Not on purpose," and went in.  I was being funny, as it obviously would depend on the 19-year old.  It seemed to me that perhaps he was worried that we would buy drinks for underage patrons, but then I realized that they are strictly over-21.  So I have no idea what he meant, and it is still bothering me.   I watched  Pride & Prejudice  today (the BBC/A&E production) and was quite pleased.  I really must write about all of the movies I've seen lately.

      I just received an email promising me  Free MoneY From The GoV-= .  Acting on the assumption that the government is, in fact, going to send me loads of free cash, I am scanning the real estate pages.  I think I will buy a house boat.  Those are real neat.  Oh.  No, but I  am  going to see  Andrew Bird  tonight, finances be damned.  Also, I have no summer clothes.  This is ridiculous.  I have more clothing than some 3rd world countries, but nothing appropriate for summer.  I have one pair of shorts and a lot of old t-shirts that I don't wear in public anymore; I have two bathing suits that don't fit me (but I don't really swim anyway); I have one pair of sandals that are sort of falling apart.  We've watched a bunch of movies (BOM?) lately.  I might make an entry about some of them later.

      After spending a frustrating period of time (about half an hour) with my dear friend The Calculator, I have come to the conclusion that we do not, in theory, spend more money each month than we bring in - this, of course, not including emergencies, which we do not have often.  I have come to the further conclusion that a large portion of the trouble lies in the fact that the vast majority of our bills are due on the 1st of the month, putting us into overdraft if we wish to do anything rash like eat (actually, even if we skip food for the first half of the month).  We go into overdraft before the mid-month paycheck, and half of that paycheck goes to overdraft fees.  The only solution that I can think of for the time being (that is, until we work out a way to have a better income) is to prevail upon some of the companies we send money to every month to allow us to move our payment to the 15th.  I have tried to change billing dates with telephone companies in the past with no luck whatsoever, but I am hopeful for the car insurance - surely if we were to make a one-time payment that covered more than a month, they would be amiable to the change.  That, or they will laugh at us.  We shall see.  In other news, something smells like gasoline and I am afraid to go check the grill.  Will, come home now! (Please note that I am fairly certain it isn't the grill, but not positive.)

       I am cursed.   Seriously - if I talk about anyone famous, they die.  In this method I killed Trevor Goddard and...somebody else.  Crapola, I cannot recall who it was.   The good news  is that I do not think responsibility for the death of David Brinkley rests with me.  The jury is still out on Gregory Peck.  I'm really going to miss him, even if I do always think of him as a young romantic lead.  I suppose that's for the best.   Rest in peace, Gregory.

      I am pleased to announce that my boyfriend and I are currently having an email conversation about British royalty in the 15th and 16th centuries.  This sparked by my google search on Richard Plantagenet, who is mentioned in  We Have Always Lived In The Castle .  I've just explained to Will the difference between Anne Plantagenet and Anne Bolyn (with Anne of Cleves thrown in for good measure).  I feel like  such a geek.   In his defense, the genealogy chart on the website I sent him the link for was near-impossible to read, and it isn't easy to find much info on women who died in 1476.  And Will just managed to get in a  Buffy  reference.  That'll teach me to bring Marie Antoinette into the conversation (don't ask).

      Lately I have been having strange stomach cramps with increasing frequency.  I've been getting the sort of gas that resides high up in (presumably) the intestines and causes great back pain.  This seems to be primarily associated with eating rich foods, so I've not been too concerned.  This morning, though, I had a horrible cramp for about two minutes, and with it a horrifying thought.  A little known fact about me (because I didn't deem to tell most people about it until now) is that in February of 2002 I had surgery to remove abnormal cells from my cervix.  As far as I know, the surgery was successful.  But I have not been to a gynecologist since.  This is primarily due to the fact that I moved across the country and lost my health insurance within a month of each other (and the surgery).  I know that I should have a regular check-up, particularly as a follow-up to the surgery.  But with our finances, it feels like I would have to choose between that and the monthly car payment.  If only there were an affordable way for me to get on Will's insurance policy.  If only Will hadn't owed the Feds money this April, and I could have used my return for the things I need.  I am 99% certain that my stomach cramps have  nothing  to do with my girl parts and their health.  But that 1% is making me nervous.

      I've been noticing that the ads on people's blogs are often tied in to the general theme of the blog.  Not always, but often.  On Phoebe's, for example, there were ads for two different magazine subscription sites that offered the New Yorker.  Pat's had one for the Peace Corps, which I'm sure could be tied in somehow.  Stephanie's used to have ads for things like DNA tests, which is absurd, but her blog  is  primarily about her family, so...Now it has ads for blogging services.  This is also sensible.  My blog had, last I checked, ads for getting rid of zits, undoing sun damage, and improving the quality of your fingernails.  Huh?  I think I ought to be offended.  In other news, but still relating to advertising, I was watching TV yesterday and it seems that several internet service providers have (at least temporarily) lowered the cost of DSL.  This is really exciting, because it is coming close to being affordable.  And by affordable, I mean that we can't afford  any  internet service but Will won't allow me to cancel it because he loves me.  We're currently paying something obscene like $23/month for dial-up, and I saw an ad for broadband for $29/month.  Unfortunately, we currently use MSN, whose broadband prices are still around $40-50/month.  I'm not opposed to changing services, just nervous about the hassle.  I wonder if I could still use the MSN services (I don't mean just messenger and email, I mean the convenience of using msn to check these things) while using a different ISP.  Then again, I  hate  MSN Explorer, and half of the time it fails at sign-in.  Argh.  Choices.  Incidentally, I followed one of the links from Phoebe's blog and found that I can get a subscription to the New Yorker for under $30, with a  free  subscription to a second magazine.  I suppose it's worth noting that the most interesting choice for the free magazine was FHM, but still.  Have I mentioned that it's my birthday soon?  And while we're at it, I'd also like web hosting prepaid for at least a year and my domain names renewed.  Thank you.  That is all.

      I forgot to mention - I have been reading the Christopher Snow novels by Dean Koontz.  I never expected to read anything of his, but Will insisted that I might like these, and he has yet to steer me wrong.  I've finished  Fear Nothing , during the reading of which I developed rampant paranoia, and am a few chapters into  Seize The Night.   So far my only complaint is that there are evil monkeys, which is wrong-wrong-wrong.  But then, I liked  Brain Dead  ( Dead Alive ).  Will swears that he thought they were evil  apes  - baboons I think - which really wouldn't have made a difference.  Or maybe it would, as no one in the books would say "evil monkey" and make me cry.  Anyway, they are quite good, and unlike  Cherish  I would recommend them.  Just be aware that you will be afraid of the dark and possibly rhesus monkeys after reading them, unless you are truly made of Sterner Stuff.

      There is a noise coming from outside that I can only assume is a pidgeon.  Possibly a dying or heartbroken pidgeon.  It sounds  awful.   Like a cow with laryngitis.  (I have never heard a cow with laryngitis.)  Last night Will and I watched the strangest movie.   Cherish , starring ceasar salad girl.  I mean, Robin Tunney.  It was just...strange.  I kind of liked it, but wouldn't necessarily recommend it.  It had an excellent supporting cast, including Tim Blake Nelson, Lindsey Crouse, Nora Dunn, Brandon Walsh (excuse me, I mean Jason Priestley), Liz Phair, and Brad Hunt, who I had never heard of but was very impressed by.  After the movie, I went off on a long rant about how I wouldn't name my daughter after my writing partner if my writing partner and I were famous.  This baffled Will entirely until I showed him our copy of  Life With Father , by Lindsay and Crouse.  Ugh.  There was just a loud clanking sound from outdoors, which I am certain was also the pidgeon.  I don't want to check.  I am starting to get freaked out.  This is obviously a sign that I don't get out often enough.  In other news, Matt is a big old whore.

      How can people not like children?  This is seriously distressing to me.  I can comprehend not liking being around children too much.  Their energy is so different than an adult's that I can make some sense of that.  But flat-out hating all children?  I don't get it.  It seems that you'd have to be some sort of monster, or just incredibly stupid.  Like I said, I really do understand (even if I don't identify) that some people are not comfortable around children or dislike certain aspects of their natures.  But it makes me unbelievably sad that anyone would talk about them as through they are some sort of plague.

       Sex and the single girl   Not the Helen Gurley ( *snicker* ) Brown book, though I've always meant to read that.  No, this is about my single friends (and me).    A lot of my friends seem to know absolutely everything about one another.  What's more, they all seem perfectly comfortable thinking that it's their (and/or each other's) business.  I find this slightly off-putting, but not enough to stop listening when one of them tries to tell me all about another's date last October and why it was so awful.  Let's face it, I am human.  Rather than sit around knowing all of my friends' secrets (which are, in fact, no such thing), I have decided to look at the information somewhat objectively and present the highlights here.  Consider it 'The Rules' according to my friends.  First of all, apparently there is new dating etiquette.  I say 'new' as though the girls in question were younger than me - they are, in fact, not.  Maybe this is a California thing...except that they are not all Californians.  Did you know that all dates split the bill?  Not necessarily in the old-fashioned 'going dutch' style, though.  It seems that one person pays for the drinks and one for dinner, if it is that sort of date.  This seems like a fine practice, really, but I always preferred the 'I'll get this one - you buy next time' style of dating.  Then there is the matter of permanence.  I have a friend who is in a fairly new relationship.  Two months, perhaps a bit more.  They are in the spending-as-much-time-as-possible-together stage, have said 'I love you' to each other, and recently had what I can only assume was their first fight (surely I'd have heard about it if there were others).  I won't go into detail, but will say that she found a suspicious (but, it turned out, innocent) item in his belongings.  He didn't explain satisfactorily, and she commented that she just wanted an explanation so that she'd know if she had to break up with him.  Certainly there is some sense in the 'if he cheats, lose him' mentality.  But it has never been that cut-and-dry for me, and I marvel at the confidence with which she said it.  Perhaps I am old-fashioned, in some strange way.  After all, I have only dated 2 1/2 men since I care to remember, and perhaps another 2 or 3 before that.  I've always felt ( digression alert ) that children of divorce are more likely to fight for a relationship.  We also, in my experience, are more likely to want to get married, retarded as that may sound.  It is my further theory that we children of divorce have already experienced the worst thing humanly possible - our own parents' divorce - and therefore it cannot possibly be any worse.  Or maybe we just want to do better than our parents.  I don't know.  ( Digression over. )  Sex.  I don't know if there is a handbook, or if it is merely the people I know, but it seems that there are more taboos than I remember from my pre-long-term relationship days.  Anything that fits into the category I call 'porno sex' is off-limits, it seems, and any dates trying it get the boot out of bed.  Now, there were certainly many things that I refused to try for a long time, but I don't think there was ever a list,  per se.   Not to mention that most of my bed partners have been fairly willing to discuss the sex we were having, thereby avoiding most nasty surprises (though there is, unfortunately, no way to discuss ahead of time whether you will be compatible).  I don't think that Will and I ever moved past the spending-as-much-time-as-possible-together part of our relationship.  Even when we were broken up and 2000 miles apart, we spoke on the phone nearly every day, and sought each other's approval for the lives we were leading separately.  I admit that we are an odd couple.  There is also the question of money - or rather, there has never really been any question.  There has, certainly, been tension, as usually one of us is paying the bills and the other living off the one income, but it's never been a question that we pool our resources, such as they are.  We no longer have a joint checking account, but I imagine that if I asked him to he'd add my name to his, even though I am a lazy no-good lie-about.  [This is my anti-climactic ending.]

      Last night while laying in bed in that pre-sleep state that tends to haunt us for a period of time anywhere between one minute and five hours, Will and I had an interesting conversation.  Here's how it went: Will named all of the things I do that make him angry.  I defended myself as best I could.  We decided which things I would no longer do.  Because we were tired, we only covered two of my various and sundry behaviors that bother him:    Summoning elder gods in the living room :  I have agreed, reluctantly, to stop doing this.  It seems that the main problem is not the elder gods themselves, nor even the summoning, but the sticky mess that is left afterwords.  I  told  him that I was  going  to clean it up, and if he had just left it alone I would have done so eventually, but does he listen?  No.  So no more playdates with Cthulu for me.    Putting curses on his mother :  We left this one at a draw.  He says that it will come back to bite me in the ass, I say that at 58 none of the curses I inflict on her will be really noticeable.  I mean, her skin is going to sag a little anyway, right?  And what's a little insanity at that age?  Still, I suspect that he will win in the end.    Before  all that, I tried to eat his cockles.  He thanked me for something-or-other from the bottom of his heart; I just wanted a wee taste.  Honestly - he is so oversensitive.

I confess, my first thought was along the lines of  Who the hell is this person?  Why didn't she at least send me a note letting me know that she was linking to me?   My second thought, about three seconds later, was something like  But maybe I  do  know her!  Think, Annika, think!  Who is she?   Then I realized that it is just fucking cool either way.    Whoever she is, everyone should send her some good mojo.  It sounds like she could use it.  And if anyone can tell me who she is and whether I know her, that would be great.  I do tend to obsess over the little things.

As a special bonus, there are also some photos of the beauteous CassyLee dancing in a stunning red dress, and a picture of the runner we bought from the craft area at the fair.

      I don't drink beer.  I don't like it.  For one thing, it's carbonated, which I find to be utterly disgusting.  I also do not drink soda of any kind, or champaign, or...anything else that is carbonated.  But the reason that I hate beer is not because I dislike drinking it.  I hate it because it is inconvenient to not drink it.  Take tonight, for example.  (I know it  says  it's Friday, but I am still awake from Thursday.)  We went to Jenn's for dinner, which was lovely.  She and Will drank Shiner Bock, I drank apple juice.  I  love  apple juice, and wouldn't have wanted alcohol anyway, because my head hurt.  By the time dinner was over, my head felt better.  While we were eating, Alan had called Will to remind him that tonight Nova (not New York Nova, LA Nova - I know, what are the odds?) was having a birthday party at some bar.  (I can't remember what it's called.  It was nice.)  Because we love Nova (she is So Fucking Hot), and she had specifically requested our presence, we drove over to say howdy.  Will asked me what I wanted to drink; I froze.  I often order a Maker's Mark on the rocks at bars, because I like bourbon and can sip it leisurely.  But I didn't  want  bourbon.  So I asked for a margarita - rocks, salt.  It was taking a chance, as approximately 97% of bartenders cannot make a decent margarita to save their own skin, but it was what I wanted.  It was delicious, and I finished it much more quickly than I usually finish my drinks.  But it took about five minutes for him to make it, whereas Will's beer was out of the cooler and in his hand inside of 15 seconds.  I wasn't annoyed at having to wait.  But I was annoyed at not drinking something quick and easy.  Where is the non-beer drinker's beer?  I want something that will not take up the barkeep's time, that will be delivered to me quickly, and that is cool and refreshing!  It isn't  fair.

      Immediately following my previous entry, I disconnected from the internet.  Will phoned as I was coming downstairs to look for my shoes, and I informed him that I was Going Out.  "So I read," he told me.  Ha ha.  He's so witty.  I swear he reads my blog a thousand times a day - insane stalker.  Anyway, after I hung up the phone I noticed that it was nearly 4:00 and decided to check the mail before leaving.  This served two purposes - the obvious (checking the mail) as well as getting me off the hook for any "exercise" while "outside."  This is because I have to traverse about a mile and a half of hallway, not to mention two flights of stairs, to get to the mailbox.  To my joy, today's mail included my first new issue of the New Yorker since I resubscribed.  Alas, the bill for said subscription also arrived, but I hastily filed it in a Pile of Papers.  Being a flexible sort of person (not  that  kind of flexible - well, all right, that too), I decided to Read My Magazine instead of Driving Around.  To my credit, I opted to do so on the porch, which is actually much closer to the "outside" than our car.  Exhibiting my True Nature (Survivalism?) I collected the necessary items for my journey:   Magazine (obviously)  Ice water  Cigarettes  Lighter  Telephone  Cell phone, as I had told Will that I wouldn't be home  Journal and pen  I don't suppose I really need to mention that as soon as I got outside I felt the need to blog about it.   *sigh*   It's a good thing I didn't opt to cough up the extra cash for wireless internet.  Or is it?- then I'd be sure to spend more time on the porch, most likely amusing the neighbors by yelling at the laptop for its deficiencies.  Maybe if we don't spend that $18/month on beer, pizza and toys (Ha!) I will use it to upgrade the laptop to a Functioning Computer.  I did eventually get around to reading my magazine.  As always, it was quite good, and as always I found myself thinking that it was probably better around 1948 or so.  I also got a phone call from my friend John.    After about 2 hours I decided that I ought to check on "indoors," which I am happy to report is still here.

      I like to pretend that Wil Wheaton is my friend.  I facilitate this by reading his blog, and more recently by receiving email from him regularly.  Granted, this email is notification of updates to said blog, sent to a Topica mailing list that I joined, but whatever.  It's  my  fantasy.  Today I did the Craziest Thing Ever.  I sent him an email.  Clearly my delusions have gotten out of hand .  I have decided to rectify the situation by exploring this thing I found this morning called "outside."  I'd seen it previously through windows and such, but thought it was yet another product of my fabulous imagination.  A quick internet search tells me that it either a) does exist or b) is a mass delusion, like cults have.  I dislike scenario b, so I've decided to try leaving the house.  I have $11 that I shouldn't spend, so it should be fun.

      I spent about 40 minutes on the phone with a service representative named Sylvia from SBC this afternoon.  When all was said and done, I had DSL (active next Tuesday), had switched long-distance service (active tomorrow) and had managed to save approximately $18/month.  Screw you, MSN!  Fuck you and your crappy, overpriced dial-up!  But, um, not until next Tuesday.   Edit:  I forgot to say - Fuck you, AT&T, as well.   Conversation that took place immediately thereafter:   Will: So I can have $18 a month to spend on toys? Me: Don't be ridiculous!  This is a partnership, you can have nine. Will: A partnership, eh?  The house had better be spotless when I get home.  Needless to say, he'll be getting the full $18.

      Dear Self,  First of all, you're really pretty.  Stop believing the photographs taken in bad lighting and look in the damn mirror.  Second, please start writing down your passwords.  Seriously, you can write them on a piece of paper and leave it next to the computer.  Who the hell could steal it?  Only Will uses this computer, and he doesn't give a crap about your various online accounts.  Third, I think you need to remind yourself that you give excellent advice.  It might be a good idea to take some of your own advice once in a while.  Fourth, if you want to be able to keep calling yourself a writer, you need to write.  I know that you feel too busy some days, but seriously - you aren't.  Stop procrastinating.  Fifth, stop spreading yourself so thin.  You know what I'm talking about.  Sixth, there is NO number six.  Love, Me

      All of my former best friends can fuck off.  Except Will!  Don't fuck off, I love you.  ieSpell is my  second -best friend.  In other news, I got a slip in the mailbox informing me that a Mysterious Parcel is waiting for me at the post office.  Normally the postman writes either the sender's name or the zip code.  This one just says "Ohio."  It isn't from my father, which leads me to believe that it may, possibly, be a parcel containing a dead hooker.  Ooh!  Or I might have a secret admirer!  (Or  both. )

      I had the best idea ever for a novel.  It would be a best seller and I would make a ton of money.  There is no question of it.  Unfortunately, it would be blatant plagiarism.  Damn it.

      Eileen left a comment which I am going to repeat here so that my reply will be noticed.    Therefore, my children will learn naturally, which I will facilitate by not sending them to school.     I understand why you dislike the educational system so much (although I don't necessarily agree) and why you'd want to homeschool your children. &nbsp;And it would be great if everybody who felt the same way did that too because the system would have to change for the better. &nbsp;But most people won't do that and I don't really blame them. &nbsp;It's a bit of a catch 22 problem. &nbsp;The only way to change the system is to go against the system, but unless enough people go against it, the system will carry on the way it is and the people that go against it will be screwed. &nbsp;Aren't you concerned that by home schooling your children, because they don't have official qualifications (and I don't mean degrees and stuff, just basic high school diplomas), they'll be penalised when they're older. &nbsp;They may be the smartest people on the planet but the fact!   is, at the moment, qualifications are an important thing.   I was homeschooled (with the exception of grades 4 through 8, which is ages 9 through 13), and I have a high school diploma.  There are many ways, all of them legal, of homeschooling.  (There are illegal ways, too, but I am not going to get into them because I plan to go the legal route.)  All of the ways include the possibility of a diploma.  Among the literal thousands of homeschooling choices are enrolling your children in the local school system, which will only work with certain schools and will probably require them to take standardized tests once a year; Enrolling them at Clonlara, and amazing school which is legally considered a correspondence school but actually only requires quarterly reports and converts the way you are spending your time into school credits, giving you a diploma at the end; and, in California, registering your home as a private school.  We also have the GED in America (don't know if other countries have it), which is a high school equivalency diploma.  It is generally looked down upon, though at least in California colleges and employers are required to treat it exactly the same as a "proper" high school diploma.  I myself was enrolled in Clonlara for two years, but I found that even a quarterly report was taking away too much of my freedom, so I opted to get a GED.  It was a laughably easy test, probably because it is geared toward adults who are re-entering the workforce (or immigrants who need jobs) and need a high school diploma.  (That was in New York state, I don't know what the test is like elsewhere.)  It is also worth noting that Ivy League schools in America  do not require a high school diploma.   It is undeniable that most employers these days require not only a high school diploma but a college degree as well, but that is another issue.  I agree with you that it is a bit of a Catch-22, but the only solution (for me) is to take action and do what I believe in, and hope that people will follow my example and the examples of the other families who make the same choices.

      I hope this doesn't mean I'm 26 already.  I was just starting to enjoy 25.  Yesterday I left the house for the first time in an eternity, and while I was out both UPS and the post office tried to deliver packages to me.  Typical!  So today I waited until UPS came to redeliver, signed for the package from my mum and my sister, opened it with glee, and then walked down to the post office to pick up the package they were holding, which was from my favorite family on earth that I am not a part of (not counting the Ingalls family).  From my sister I got a 4 pack of match boxes with pin-up girls on them, which I doubt I will use because they are so pretty, and a metal case with another pin-up girl that has a card inside informing me that it will hold three tampons or cigars.  This made me laugh hysterically.  Besides, I use OB, so I could probably fit about 10 tampons in there [/TMI].  From my sister and mom I got the prettiest little silver box, and when I popped it open I discovered that it is a teensy portable ashtray.  Now, I ask you, what sort of message is my mother trying to send?  (Clearly, the answer is that I should switch to cigars.)  From Pat, Stephanie, Saren and Harper I got monkey soap.  I got other stuff, but I am still giggling like a little girl, trying to figure out how they got the monkey in the soap.  Right, they also sent a pretty purple embroidered bag, a pair of funny/pretty socks (what? they're both), and a little silver box that has dragon flies on it and is  not  a portable ashtray.  There was also an assortment of beautiful drawings, and the prettiest pen I have ever seen.  I think they may have beaten Cassie for sheer number of gifts.  I forgot to mention that in the box with the gifts from mum and K was a huge stack of books mum had set aside for me a while back - mostly Kurt Vonnegut novels.  I think I now own every one of his published works with the exception of  Cat's Cradle , which I have read anyway.  I have been meaning to blog about my traumatic pizza experience on Tuesday, but it is still too awful to think about.  I will just say this:  JR at Papa John's on Vermont Avenue, I know where you work.

      Kirk responded to  urlLink this entry , and I'd like to address some of the issues he brought up.  Unjobbing?  I don't get it.    isn't it good that someone takes away your garbage once a week?    Jobs seem kind of a necessary thing to me, and certainly not a bad thing.  (Not that jobs = bad was stated explicitly, but it seemed to be implied.)   I do find these entries interesting, but inevitably there are things in life that are not lofty pursuits yet are undeniably necessary.   I never said anything about lofty pursuits.  In fact, I am talking about quite the opposite, at least in one way of looking at things.  I will talk about my definition of unjobbing, but can't speak for the author of the book, because it made me very angry in ways I haven't figured out or dealt with yet.  It may be unfair of me to use the term, but I already have and I like to be consistent.  (I also haven't got a better term.)  You infer that "jobs = bad" which, in the most simplistic way of taking my meaning, is what I meant, but it isn't the entirety of what I was talking about.  I also was only saying that jobs were bad for  me .  I don't speak for the other six billion people.  One thing from  Unjobbing  that I really, really agreed with was the job does not equal work, and vice versa.  Work is, and should be, the use of your talents.  It should be an activity that you get something out of.  That doesn't necessarily mean that it is an activity you  enjoy , strictly speaking, but that you are rewarded, in one way or another, for your efforts.  I do not mean a monetary reward.  That is separate.  Some people, like myself, are inclined toward creative work.  I personally do not want one of the so-called creative  jobs  out there.  I want to actually  be  creative, which I find rewarding.  I also want to eat, so I am trying to figure out ways that I can put my talents to use and receive additional (monetary) rewards for them.  This might include freelance writing, volunteering at events (which, in past experience, is the best way to "network" - meet people who might have helpful ideas for me), and crocheting.  Yes, I said crocheting.  No, I haven't worked out the details of that one yet.  Here is an example:  I consider the things I do at Buffyguide to be work.  I enjoy helping Jamie with the episode guide (though I've been terribly lax about it), I like participating in the forums, and I feel useful enforcing the forum rules.  Yes, there are times when it feels like a soul-sucking  job.   But I have no set hours, and there are few expectations for me to meet (that matter - I'm not talking about other users' expectations), and I can leave for a week if I want to, or ask someone else to take care of a problem, and no one will think less of me or discipline me, nor am I likely to get "fired."  The downside to having this work that I enjoy doing is that it does not, and will never, pay money.  I still do it, though, because I like it and it is a good experience.  I haven't asked Jamie if it's all right, but it occurs to me that I could probably even put it on my resume.  I look at the work I do at Buffyguide, the work I am doing to put up my new website, and the work I do at home (whether it is laundry, writing, or cooking) as equally valid, fulfilling forms of work.  It happens that I am not being paid for any of them*, which means that I am a jobless loser (not your words, Kirk, a generalized stereotype).  I, however, look at them as a template for future work, and hope that some of that will eventually bring along income as a perk.  *The fact that I have a partner who is willing to pay the bills while I pursue my dreams is more than payment for any of the less agreeable tasks, and an unbelievable bonus for the ones I enjoy.  Some people, not very much like me, are technically inclined.  Some are service-oriented (which I think might just be another word for "people person").  Some are very strong.  The list goes on.  I think that if people were offered fair hours (possibly flexible, depending on the sort of work), fair pay, and a friendly environment, they would still  choose  to do "undesirable" work.  Do I think anyone's first choice is to be a garbage collector?  Not really.  But on the other hand, it is a city job, which means that there are fantastic benefits.  I can easily imagine person X taking a part-time job for the city, collecting trash, in exchange for more time at home with his/her family and medical insurance to boot.  In fact, in some respects it sounds like a  better  job than office work.  If wanting time to be oneself, to enjoy one's family, and to simply be are lofty pursuits, then that it what I am talking about.  But if a lofty pursuit is Rock Superstar or Media Mogul, I say "No thanks."

      In my Quest for More Knowledge, I decided to read up on both Waldorf and Montessori schools, both of which I have some knowledge of, but not very much.  I really couldn't tell you the main differences between the two, and I'd like to be able to.  Will and I have been talking about life, the universe, and everything quite a lot lately, and that includes our future children's educations.  We have agreed on unschooling, but I confess that the cynic in me wants to be prepared to defend our choice.  I also just like knowing stuff.  So I found a web page of a former unschooler, which included links to websites for both types of schools.   Great,  I thought,  all I had to do was think about it and the information fell into my lap!   Well, not so much.  The sites were utterly, totally useless.  Links that went nowhere, PDF files that crashed my browser, and FAQs with no answers.  What the hell?  I am very disappointed.  If anyone has  useful  links to information about either type of school, please let me know.  If not, please scroll to the next entry, which is about a Very Important Person.

      I assume it's a wedding band, but I suppose it could be an engagement ring or just, you know, a ring.  It's a band of diamond chips in white gold.  There are probably 30 diamonds, but it might be 29.  I can't seem to get an accurate count, because the damn thing is circular.  Anyway, it's very pretty, and I felt like wearing it.  It occurs to me now, about an hour after putting it on, that I was looking at the top of my dresser because I was thinking that I really needed to dust it.  I forgot.    So, last night the bad smell went away rather quickly (it was probably coming from outdoors), and I never did go hide in the bathroom, but Will and I went for a walk so I never came back to finish my entry.  And now I don't really feel like it, though I will say that  The Big Easy  was terrific.  We walked past the Wiltern Theater (it's at the corner of Wilshire and Western, and it's called the Wiltern), where there was a Special Events Awards Ceremony.  We'd walked that way to see where the pretty lights were coming from.  It looked like quite a nice event, and I suddenly pined for my days in New York.  Not my recent visit, but the last time I lived there.  I went to events like that all the time, because I worked for Gen Art and actually ran some events.  I helped to put together a first-time film festival which went on to be quite successful (though I don't know if it is still happening), and helped coordinate some art showings.  It was so  nice , and I hope to do something similar again in my lifetime.

      Will and I had a long conversation last night about...well, about a lot of things, but if I must choose a label, I'd say it was a political conversation.  One of the things we talked about was how so many people are loud about a cause without actually  doing  anything useful.  Not only that, but so many of those loud people are utterly self-righteous about it, as though they are somehow better than everyone else because they recycle/eat vegan/insert  good thing  here.  Will mentioned a person he saw recently whose car was plastered in bumper stickers with slogans like "Make Love, Not War," "Hug a Child, Save A Tree," and assorted other well-intentioned but somewhat absurd sentiments (I am all for hugging children  and  saving trees, but that bumper sticker just doesn't make any sense).  This person wanted the world to see that they were environmentally and politically concious - in theory, there is nothing wrong with that.  But if they are so concerned about the world, they should not have been laying on the horn while the guy ahead of them in traffic, driving the BMW and talking on his cell phone, was waving some pedestrians across the street.  I'm sorry, but who is the better person there?  I think it's the "asshole" in the Beamer.  People are getting it wrong.  They are thinking globally and "acting" globally - by spending too much time worrying, yelling, and gesturing wildly about the world's problems.  I agree with them, the world is in a bad way.  But the  only  way to fix the world is to start by fixing the people (and things) around you.  Take care of yourself, your family, and your community.  If everyone did this, even a tiny bit more than they do now, the rest would  have  to follow.  There is no other logical way that it could go.  This doesn't mean that we should put on blinders to the rest of the world and ignore things like war and poverty and disease, but that we should concentrate our energy on fixing the things closest to us.  I think that this should include a level of awareness of and involvement in things like our government, but  only to the degree that we are able.   We should pick and choose our battles when they are outside of our homes, because personal happiness will open up opportunities to help on a grander scale.  One example of this is work.  I realized a while back that I simply do not want a job.  I came to terms with that very recently, and am now concentrating on figuring out what I  do  want.  I borrowed  Unjobbing: the Adult Liberation Handbook  from the library yesterday, because Stephanie had read it and was inspired by it.  I confess, I didn't like it.  This is very likely not the author's fault.  He wrote the book with the intention of helping people realize  why  the current "work" system and economy are harmful to us.  Possibly because I already understand those things, I found his writing to be somewhat preachy.  I'm sure this was not his intention, and even more sure that his book would be very helpful to a lot of unhappy people.  But I am happy, and what I really wanted was a book like  The Teenage Liberation Handbook , but for adults.  In other words, I crave suggestions of things that I  can  do instead of consuming my life with "work" that I do not enjoy or get much out of.  At the same time, I do need money.  The system will not change overnight, even for me, because I  like  many of the modern conveniences and "advances."  So I must find a balance.  I would very much like to reduce my life of clutter and do things that are better for my environment.  But I also have no intention of  drastically  changing my lifestyle.  I do, and will continue to do (hopefully increasingly) what I can.  I do not approve, for example, of our country's compulsory education system.  Therefore, my children will learn naturally, which I will facilitate by not sending them to school.  Does this change the schooling system?  Not in an immediate sense, but it certainly will make my family healthier and happier.  And the more people that do things like this, the closer we will be to a point where the system will have no choice but to change.  Imagine, for example, if every family who disapproved of the school system was able to (and did) take their children out of it.  The schools would lose so much money that they would be forced, eventually, to change.  I am too realistic in my thinking to consider myself an idealist, but there is no denying that I am a hopeless optimist.  I think that is a good thing.

      I would like nothing better than to turn this blog into  The chronicles of Annika's birthday gifts , but I probably will not do so.  I do want to mention, though, that Heath and Jess rock!  This morning I went to the post office and picked up a parcel containing 5 discs of  Cowboy Bebop , including the movie.  If this damn codex package ever finishes downloading, I will even be able to watch them!  And, since the regular DVD player doesn't recognize the discs, this may ( may ) help to push me to reorganize the office the way I want it, which would make for a more comfortable viewing area.  Last night Will and I watched  From Hell , based on the Alan Moore comic book (which neither of us has actually read). It was interesting, and mostly good, but far from great.  For the majority of the movie I felt as though the filmmakers were simply trying too hard - it was overly stylistic without having the comic book-y stylistic feel.  (Of course, like I said, I haven't read the comic book, so I could be wrong.)  The performances were fairly good, but the dialogue was erratic at best.  I ought to look into whether portions of the script were rewritten, which might explain it.  Also, I don't pretend to be an expert of English accents, but I really couldn't tell where Johnny Depp's character was meant to be from.  Heather Graham's accent was more consistant (to my ear), which can't be a good thing.  The thing that irritated me most about the dialogue was that characters kept repeating other characters' names, as though perhaps the audience hadn't caught them, but then other characters were introduced and never named.  It was confusing and, again, inconsistant.  And people just don't talk like that.  The sets were great, but again felt overdone, like they were trying too hard to recreate the feel of the time period.  At least there was tons of gratuitous blood.  And Hagrid!  I mean...

      Simon Ball!  This morning I walked to the post office with the little slip that says I have a parcel waiting for me, and I came home to find that the Amazon box contained a copy of  Amelie !  (Sorry, I don't do accents.)  Now, I admit, when I read the card with the note from Simon, I  should  have known what it was, but I didn't.  Total surprise, both in content and in the fact that it was from him.  Yay!  I love you, Simon.

      So, yesterday I turned 25.  Thusfar it has not sunk in - either that or it just doesn't mean anything.  Until a few years ago, I was unaware of any stigma relating to the 25th birthday.  Then Will had his, and moaned for weeks about being a quarter of a century old.  So I was concerned that I would also panic, but I didn't.  I suppose it helped that the first (well, one of the first) thing he said to me yesterday morning was "Twenty-five.  A great age."  Though it occurs to me that he might be feeling the fact that he's now closer to 30.  The one thing that is odd about this birthday is that I am now the age my mother was when I was born.  So, a brief rundown of my day: Got up, made coffee, drank coffee while finishing  urlLink my book , woke up Will and told him to play with me, realized that he wouldn't be awake until he'd had at least one cup of strong coffee, checked the WD, saw that my favorite lesbian had returned just to make my birthday post (I love you, Julia), had leftover Mexican food from the 4th, listened to the same Yma Sumac song on repeat pretty much all day, discussed our new series with Will, played Trivial Pursuit, danced around the apartment, went out for delicious sushi, watched parts of some favorite movies, did something Not Fit To Print with my boyfriend, had ice cream, worked more on the series, and had a few phone calls wishing me a happy birthday.  The phone calls, which deserve their own paragraph, were from: My mother, my father, my sister, Saren (and Pat), Lisa Beth, John, and Phoebe.  The last two reached my voicemail and left very sweet messages, John accusing me of being Otherwise Engaged and Phoebe singing Happy Birthday to me.  If anyone else called and I forgot, I'm very sorry.    And now, I have laundry to wash and dust to banish from my house.

      Today was, of course, Independence Day.  To celebrate, I cooked Mexican food.  I know -  what?   But shut up, it was good.  On the menu:   Carne Asada with homemade marinade  Fresh salsa (along the lines of Pico de Gallo)  Guacamole  Quesadillas (made with queso fresco)  Tortilla chips.  That I made.  And a big ol' mess of onions and jalapenos, cooked to the edge of death.  Man, was it good.  Oh, and there were margaritas and Mexican beer (Modelo, for those keeping score at home.  Also for those keeping score at home, it is not  quite  possible to make a black and tan with Modelo Especial and Negra Modelo.)

Unfortunately, in trying to read all my friends' blogs, I have tied myself to my computer.   In LOTR: TTT News...   How is it possible that I didn't notice before just how attractive Eomer is?  Oh, right. Because he isn't. The  actor , however, is the cat's meow.

      For example, the DVD of  The Two Towers  has been sitting next to the TV since 4:00 this afternoon. That's almost three hours! I could have watched the whole movie! But did I? No. Why not?

      You know John? My friend who is visiting us this weekend that I am so excited to be seeing? I hate him.  He mailed my birthday present and ordered me not to open it until he is here. This is  so unfair . It is sitting there, mocking me. Also, I don't have a gift for him (his birthday is about two weeks before mine) and I feel guilty.  In other news, Capitol One is retarded. They send Will about seven million credit card offers a week. We replied to one of them, because it was a good offer. He was turned down because of some crap or other. Then we received a new offer for an alternate card that was not quite as great a deal, but still an improvement over our current credit card.  We applied for it and were turned down  because we'd applied for another card from them in the last two months.  That was last week or the week before. Today we received another offer from them.  They have killed a few too many trees on their mail campaign to keep rejecting us for pre-fucking-approved cards for such questionable reasons. (Yes, I know that pre-approved no longer means anything. But it is really ridiculous.)

      In May, Will's father visited. While he was here, he bought me a fuchsia plant for the front balcony. I wanted a fuchsia specifically because there are some hummingbirds who hang around the trees outside of our building and I was hoping to lure them to my yummy plant.  This morning, as I was watching  The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert , I glanced out the screen door and saw a hummingbird flittering about my plant. It actually ate from one of the few open blossoms! I almost died of happiness.  Tomorrow, my friend John arrives at LAX for a long weekend of debauchery. (By debauchery, I mean that we will watch  The Two Towers  and a whole lot of  Buffy .) We haven't seen each other since I was last in Chicago, about 13 months ago. I am  So. Fucking. Excited.

      Yesterday we met duskfire from the WD.  Anyone who knows who she is may now proceed to be incredibly jealous.  If you don't know who she is, you are either blind or not a member of the WD.  Maybe both.

      Will and I had a date today.  It was truly excellent and I doubt I will do it justice in my description.  Oh well -- I was there.  I woke up and made myself coffee, which unfortunately was a disaster.  My plan was to use the espresso machine and just run a little extra water through, but somehow I fucked it up.  I was determined to drink it, though, because I've done that before and had it work, so I was angry at myself.  About two (disappointing) sips in, Will got out of bed and kissed me good morning.  I cried about my coffee and he took it away and came back with a cappucino for me.  Then I played with the computer and he made himself bacon.  (Um. He cooked it.  It was already bacon.)  After a brief chat with my mom, Will and I both showered and got dressed.  I know that isn't very exciting (except maybe to Matt), but as long as I am writing about the day in detail, I figure it's worth mentioning.  We drove to the library where I dropped off our books and paid the late fees (oops), and then we drove over to Larchmont and went to our favorite sushi restaurant.  I ate all of the Unagi on the west coast, and Will had...I don't know, I was preoccupied.  But I'm sure it was good.  We wandered around window shopping for a bit, then drove to the ArcLight Theater.  We checked out the cafe, where Will had a bourbon and I had a cappucino and some creme brulee.  The we settled into our seats just in time for the previews preceding  Open Range.   We both loved the movie, though I don't recommend it unless you enjoy westerns.  After the movie we ran home, because I am not organized enough to take my pills with me when I might not be home by 7:30, and then went grocery shopping.  On the way home we picked up fast food.  We pride ourselves in our eccentricity.  Sushi for lunch, Popeye's and Taco Bell for dinner.  Shut up.  Now I am sitting at the computer, feeling fat and happy, and Will is watching the special features on the  House of 1000 Corpses  DVD.  He also feels fat and happy.  And what more could anyone ask for?

      My mom just emailed me some pictures of our friend Melanie's children.  Radha, Everett, and David.  Her fourth child, Henry, died of SIDS 5 1/2 years ago.  That makes David nearly 6 (he and Henry are twins), Everett 7, and Radha 8 1/2.  Un-fucking-believable.  When I met Melanie, she was about 6 months pregnant with Radha. I first held Radha when she was a week old.  She had very long fingers.  I didn't meet Everett until he was 3 or 4 months old, because I was living in another city when he was born.  We fell in love instantly.  His first word was "Annika," at only 4 months. The first time he held out his arms to be picked up, it was to me.  I lived with them for about a year, and while I'm certain he knew Melanie was Mommy, he had practically no preference between us unless he was hungry (he found out the hard way* that my breasts weren't useful).  David and Henry were born while I was away at college, and I met them at Christmas, when they were 2 months old.  My mother and I went with Melanie and all the children to Sam's Club, and I had David in one of those snuggly baby carriers, like a backpack on your belly.  People kept coming up to me and complimenting me on my beautiful baby, and being shocked when I pointed out his twin brother.  I reluctantly explained that they weren't mine.  When Henry died I got a phone call at 8:00 in the morning from my friend Emily.  I went into shock - absolute shock.  I couldn't eat, or do anything really, all day. I somehow made it through my classes.  Sometime that night I got sick of my friends trying to be helpful and sympathetic, and went off to see this boy I knew.  He and I had recently amused all of our friends by announcing our engagement, despite not being involved with each other.  It was...I don't know.  It was funny at the time.  He gave me a drink and told me a joke and kissed me.  I slapped him.  Then I kissed him, and wound up sleeping in his room.  He was (mostly) a perfect gentleman.  Bless him.  The second-to-last time I saw Everett (he and I were closest, though I love all of my babies), he spotted me from across a crowded room and came running.  He was probably 3 at the time, and hadn't seen me in a year.  When he turns 18 I just might marry him.  Except, you know,  ewww .   *I was bathing him, and the easiest way was to just get into the tub with him, because he was so tiny and the kichen sink was, well, full of dishes.  Man alive, was that ever the strangest sensation!  When a 6 month old baby latches on, there isn't much you can do about it.

      I haven't updated in a few days because I have been (in theory) writing a longish entry about respect.  However, because I get annoyed when my friends don't update, I thought I'd write something here in the meantime.  Will and I have a full weekend coming up.  On Friday evening we're hosting the second meeting of our writers group.  I am both excited and annoyed about this, as I am still not sure which of my five million projects I feel like working on, and therefore showing to the group.  On Saturday we're  going on a date.   This is, of course, assuming that we aren't too lazy.  We kind of suck.  The plan right now is to go to a matinee of  Open Range  and then go out for sushi.  On Sunday we're having lunch with some friends, for Roxanne's birthday.  Then we're meeting Duskfire (from the WD) and I'll cook dinner.  I still don't know what I'm going to cook.  She can't eat spicy foods! I will have to be creative.  In other news, the number of posts lately at the WD about people wanting to have sex with Beth are starting to piss me off.   I saw her first, damn it.   Thank you. That is all.

      I've decided that actually writing out my thoughts in complete sentences is a total waste of time.  Taking a page from  urlLink THE INCREDIBLE HULK , I will from now on only write the pertinent words.  Weekend good.  GREAT!  Movies, movies, movies, pizza. Cassie.  Chris Melissa HAMMER MOVIE.  Geoff cowboys leftovers.  Geoff like food I cook.  YAY.  Will nice.  Will sunburned.  Will GREAT.  THE END.

      Last night our beloved friend Sean came over.  We made a ridiculously good dinner and tried to weasel some  Everwood  spoilers out of him.  He stuck to his guns and only told me stuff that's already been in the trades.  The WB has, apparently, approved a ten-year-old girl using the word "shit" during primetime.  I am SO PROUD.  Also, my beloved Abbots will be having more fun, and Rose will have more screentime.  This may be the only series I am excited about for the fall.  However.  After Sean left I turned on the TV to see if New York had power yet - actually, on the assumption that they didn't, to see what the skyline looked like.  ABC was in commercial so I flipped over to NBC and what did I see, much to my surprise?   Queer Eye For The Straight Guy !  A full hour this time!  I   NBC.  It was the episode with the urban cowboy who wanted to propose to his girlfriend.  Neither Will nor I shed any tears at the end, I swear!  I hate being a girl!   I want Ted!   Or any of the others, for that matter.  Except Carson.  I adore Carson, but there is no way I could live with him.  He can visit.   In totally unrelated news , today Saren is six.  I love you, Saren.

      To be fair, I am not  as  hot as before.  (We are obviously not discussing my looks.  Yowza!  I'm hot in that department.)  My darling boy left the clip-on fan with me today instead of bringing it to his office.  He says he has a "plan" to stay cool at work.  He wasn't specific.  I went to the post office this morning to pick up a parcel that turned out to be a copy of Andrew Bird's  Weather Systems  from Beth.  This is very exciting, and will be even moreso when I get my computer to work so I can play the 8 minute documentary that's on the disc.  Thank heaven for DSL - it's making the updates to QuickTime much less annoying.  (I hate QuickTime, incidentally.  It constantly puts itself in my startup menu, and I have to manually remove it to make the computer function at all.)  I spent a good part of the day yesterday looking over possible short-time jobs.  urlLink Craigslist  is fantastic but most of the listings are dubious at best.  Still, it is a huge improvement over the last time I tried to use it.  I can't remember if that was before I moved or after - if it was before, I can just assume that the Chicago database is less useful.  I must say, though, that I am appalled by the lack of grammar and spelling ability exhibited by the people placing the ads.    Anyway, my plan is to find part time work doing a variety of things so that I don't go crazy.  For example, I'd be happy doing things such as copy editor, production assistant, extra, typist, et cetera.  I was thinking that I could write bios for struggling actors, if I knew any.  (I wrote a bio for the little boy I used to babysit for, when he started going to auditions.  I charged $10, because his mom insisted on paying me and I didn't think it was necessary since I was already being paid for watching him at the time.)  I could also fix people's resumes, but that might be a tough one to break into since I can't seem to finish my own.  Oh, the irony.  I would also really like to be an independent contractor for development and production offices, reading scripts and writing coverage, but no one seems to know what companies act as liaison for that sort of thing, though I know such companies exist.  Basically, I have tons of skills that I am not putting to use (at least not for money) and I am trying to figure out how to market them.  Hmm.  I found an ad from someone looking for a teacher to homeschool her children.  I wonder what sort of homeschooling s/he has in mind.  I suspect that my idea of 'teaching' is a bit too liberal, but it might be worth looking into.  (Ewww.  I just described myself as liberal.  I loathe defining terms like that.)  Speaking of liberals, which brings me to politics, I suppose it is really time that I looked into this whole Governor thingy.  I have until October to figure out what the hell is going on.  Thank heaven I have another year to sort out the Presidential election.  I have to cut my nails.  I hope this entry is satisfactory as is.

      Even the AC isn't doing anything for my mood.  And I was eaten alive by mosquitoes last night.   I live in the fucking desert.   The bites actually woke me up in the middle of the night.  I managed to have a very productive hour or so midday, so all is not lost.  I guess.

      Not to be confused with  The Weekend In  Briefs  , which I would love to write about but - alas - I have no pants.   Cooked unbelievably delicious black bean soup, convincing myself with finality to follow through on plan to cook vegetarian more.  Gathered for first Writers Meeting with a group of fabulous and possibly like-minded friends and acquaintances.  Went to first Major League Baseball game - Cubs at Dodgers, final score 6-1 Dodgers.  I am a traitor no matter how you look at it.  Did not go swimming, despite rumors.  Made some attempt to analyze and improve myself.  Successful.  Am now perfect.  I will,  probably , expand on some or all of these items at a later time.  Right now, I'm beat.

      Someone found my blog searching for Sicilian Curses.  This is absolutely brilliant.  I wish I knew some Sicilian curses.  If only my grandparents hadn't turned their backs on our family heritage!  Bastard* first-generation Americans!  What did they think?  That  Pittsburgh  was something to be proud of?  All Pittsburgh has going for it is Primanti Brothers, and they've only been around since the 70s!  Mmmmmmmm, Primanti's.  I am suddenly very hungry.   *My great-grandparents were married.

      First let me state, for anyone who might somehow not know, that I am pro-choice.  Yesterday I received in the mail a packet from  urlLink NARAL Pro-Choice America .  It contained a long(ish), reasonably informative letter.  It was somewhat biased - it gave the impression that  all  clinics that perform abortions are bombed and  all doctors  who do the same wear bullet-proof vests (which, by the way, don't exist; Kevlar is bullet- resistant  - but I digress).  I know better, I understood their position, I moved on.  It also contained a page asking for a donation of $25 (or more) and three petitions to Congress for me to sign.  I was impressed that everything was personalized - every page in the packet had my name on it.  I was not impressed by the petitions.  There were three, and they all were identical with the exception of who they were addressed to.  Here is the text:  I am outraged that a woman's Constitutional right to choose is under continual attack by a small, vocal minority.  I urge you to support family planning and legislation that protects a woman's right to choose.  Please do everything in your power to ensure that abortion remains safe and legal in this country.  Sincerely, et cetera  The first two petitions were addressed to my state Senators, Diane Feinstein and Barbara Boxer.  Both of them are actively pro-choice.  The third petition was addressed to Representative Diane Watson, also actively pro-choice.  My state (California) has 53 Representatives.  17 of them are anti-choice and 3 are undecided.  Wouldn't one of them have been a better candidate for a petition?  I'm sure that the pro-choice Senators and Representatives would love to have their beliefs affirmed, but wouldn't it be more productive for me to contact those whose views do not match mine (or the Constitution) and urge them to reconsider?  Furthermore, I do not have money to give to any cause.  Surely there are other ways I can support an organization whose work I believe in; I haven't decided yet if NARAL fits the bill, but I object to the implication that money is the only way I can help.

      I've spent all day trying to learn html.  Specifically, figuring out CSS and tables.  It isn't all that difficult, but man is it tiring.  I think I'm going to go downstairs soon and pretend the computer was never invented.  Poor Will had to go back to the courthouse today.  Our court date is set for two weeks from today (suing his former landlord for the security deposit), and on Friday we got a letter from the Sheriff's department informing us that 6 unsuccessful attempts had been made to serve the summons.  Including several attempts to talk to people at the office who feigned ignorance, and the last one, when they called first to confirm that  STEVE FLEISCHMAN  was in, but he had mysteriously "stepped out" when they arrived.  This is the same  Steve Fleischman  who phoned on Wednesday to see if we could settle out of court, but refused to name a figure and talked in circles for about an hour.   Steve Fleischman  clearly knows that he is being sued and is trying to get out of it on a technicality.  He is a worm.  So, Will is headed to the courthouse to find out what the hell we're supposed to do, as they are not required in court unless they have been (successfully) served a summons.    I am so frustrated.  Not to be rude, but please do not attempt to give me advice.  West Hollywood has rental laws that are different than everywhere else on earth.   I could use some sympathy, though.

      I cut my finger today.  Fairly badly.  I was chopping an onion and the knife slipped.  This has never happened before - I injure myself in the kitchen all the time, but it's always burns.  I've been cooking since I was...I don't know, probably 2 or so, and I am very respectful of my knives.  I know what I'm doing.  I blame the onion - it had shifty eyes.  Anyway, I felt the knife slip, and I felt my fingernail stop it from slicing the end of my finger off.  I grabbed the finger with my other hand, applying as much pressure as I could, and shoved it in Will's face with my eyes closed.  He walked me into the bathroom, made me hold my hand above my head (holding a cut above the heart slows blood flow to it), and cut some gauze and tape to wrap it up with.  I suspect that my carrying on made him a bit nervous, but the bandage was pretty good.    Then I almost fainted.  He got me to the bedroom, where the bed was kind enough to meet me halfway (I fell), and I lay face down until my head stopped spinning and my stomach stopped lurching.  I had the presence of mind to grab his pillow and put it on top of mine; I laid my head on the mattress and put my injured hand up on the pillows.  You see, they say to keep the injury above the heart, but I've never seen it specified whether that means biologically (by the shoulder or head no matter your position) or in regard to the ground - that is, above sea level, where your heart is sea level.  Did that make sense?  Anyway, I'll be looking into that.  By which I mean "asking Phoebe."  I can't believe I almost fainted.  Sheesh.  I am a total sissy.  Incidentally, after about an hour I removed the bandage and Will put a band-aid on it.  It looks all right.  The knife went in at an angle, so the cut isn't too deep.  And a super sexy lesbian offered to "cheer me up."

      To be fair, part of my heart is in (South) Carolina, as my mum and sister are there.  Will is downstairs.  It sounds like he's doing the dishes.  Gawd, I love that boy.  I am upstairs, fucking about online.  The soundtrack to  The Two Towers  is on the hi-fi.  I am reasonably certain that I will  die  if I don't get to watch the movie again soon.  (Incidentally, there is a great article that I haven't actually read in this month's Computer Gaming World that starts off "Where will you be on December 17th?  If you said you don't know, you lost all your geek cred."  That is a paraphrase.)  The theatrical release DVD will be out soon, but I still have months to wait until the extended DVD.  More fighting!  More...fighting!  And - AND! - a flashback to before  Fellowship .  For those who are unaware, Boromir came to Elrond because he and Faramir had the same dream (that's what he's talking about at the Council); the flashback will, I  think , be the two brothers discussing the dream.  Or something.  Whatever!  Sean Bean!   *faints*   ...Excuse me, I went to the Happy Place.  Speaking of movies, we saw  28 Days Later  yesterday at the ArcLight.  Best movie theater ever.  Really fun movie, too.  I might make an entry later about some logic holes in the movie, because I think they're quite common, particularly in horror movies and military movies, and I'd like some input.  But not right now, because  meh .  I'm still full from the humongous breakfast I made for Will and myself.

      Item the first: Jewelry stores stink. Now, it is my fault that we didn't go to any 'real' jewelry stores, but I primarily just wanted to go and look at styles and whatnot. I don't really appreciate being pressured to buy a ring that I only kind of like, because it is on sale. I don't care if your store is located in a mall! Have some self-respect. The good news is that we found a fantastic store that sells beautiful custom-made wedding bands. I didn't dare ask about pricing, but I am determined to buy there.  Item the second: I am eating an omelet. It needs salt, but I can't be bothered.  Item the third: Remember when sweatpants were unattractive necessities? When did they become so wonderful? I am never taking these pants off (except for washing).  Item the fourth: ARGHHH!  Item the fifth: I am the best girlfriend/fianc&#233;e/whatever on earth! Last night Will was stuck reading stoopid scripts for work, so I went to Target and bought him underwear. I also bought toilet paper, and these magnificent sweatpants.  I guess that's it for now.

      I am making this post and marking it as a draft. That is so neat! I can post it and none of you can see it.  I am doing this because my goddamn sister isn't answering her goddamn phone. She must have a  life  or something. Stupid bint - I need to ask her something  Very Important.  No, really. This time I mean it.  You see, I'm going to ask her to be my maid of honor.  I guess you can all figure out the rest. You're a pretty intelligent bunch.   Edit after she called back...   Well, one, she said yes. Actually, she screamed it. All of Wells College is now half-deaf. And two, I don't have a ring yet. We're shopping. Oh, and we haven't set a date, so don't ask. We've only told our families and already I'm annoyed with that question.

      I was very ill all weekend, and am still feeling only about [wild estimate] 20%.  This afternoon we go to court for the security deposit debacle that should have been over six months ago. Then I go pick up Will's father from LAX. Then (presumably) I collapse from exhaustion.  Since I have been and probably will be online terribly sporadically, a few personal notes-  Cindy: I would love to chat with you but am uncertain when I'll be able to. I'll drop you a line as soon as I stop coughing so much and don't have a houseguest.  Beth: I love you to pieces and under the circumstances if you need to talk you can call me despite the reasons I just gave for not wanting to chat. I have been thinking of (and will continue to think of) your family.  Um. Oh dear, I'm certain there were others. Oh well. Thus endeth this update. Everybody cross your fingers for us to win!

      Hi. I'm home. I feel ill, most likely due to the hectic schedule of the weekend, combined with too much air travel, combined with grief, combined with other stuff.  I spent a good portion of the trip home writing stuff down about my relatives. I haven't decided yet if I will post any of what I wrote.  This weekend was the first time that all of my cousins (with one exception) have been in the same room. It was really neat. My cousin Rory did not make it back for the funeral. There is some uncertainty as to whether he was too grief-stricken or unable to afford the trip. I was soprry not to see him, and more sorry that he was unable to say goodbye. I hope that he is able to grieve in his own way.  I also saw all of my uncles, which I don't believe has ever happened.  Most of my cousins grew up near each other, or at least with frequent visits. I am still meeting people for the first time. Well, technically, I met Michael and Andrea years ago (about 22), but I don't think it counts if I am 25, he is 27, and she is 23 and we don't remember each other or know anything about each other. Andrea is recently married, and Michael is an Army Sergeant. Who knew? (The answer is "everyone but me.")  My cousin Erin is getting married next year.  I also met some (not first) cousins that I really had never met, at least not to my knowledge. There are some very neat people in my family. As I suppose is usually the case with family, I have nothing in common with most of my relatives and we would never otherwise be friends, but there are a few people who I would love no matter how I knew them.   urlLink Here  is a photograph that my cousin Michael took. He was in Iraq until, I believe, Friday. He was supposed to leave for the U.S. next week, but was allowed to leave early for the funeral.  This entry ends here, because I say so.

      Last time I was in Ohio, Matty came to see me.  Where are you, Matty?   Whenever my sister and father have showered (I was lazy forever, but now that I'm clean I'm annoyed with them for taking so long - go figure) we're driving down to Pittsburgh to go to the funeral home "viewing" extravaganza. Wait, that probably isn't the right word.  If I feel like it later, I'll transcribe what I wrote on the plane. I mostly wrote about the plane, though, so I might not bother. There isn't much to say about planes that isn't boring.  Later I'm going over to Will's parents' house. My thanks to those of you who advised against it, but I don't think I had adequately expressed that they are very kind to me nowadays. Anyway, my family is so crazy that they will seem like the living embodiment of sanity. Plus, there is no way Franny will be there (and if she is, I will probably deck her). And anyway, I want to. I know, I know. Clearly I am out of my head with grief.  In other news, I don't think my outfit matches, but K says it is all right. So if anyone dislikes my combination of brown pants and a charcoal sweater, tough. It has been okayed by the College Element. I still haven't decided what shoes to wear, though. Crud.  In conclusion, I am in Pittsburgh and you aren't! Nya-na-na-na-na.

      The final entry in the  This Week Sucked  category is so extraordinarily weird and outlandish that it just had to get its very own post. I'm afraid there is a  lot  of backstory.  Will's mom has this boss, who we'll call Franny. For years, Franny championed Will's creative work, getting him a book deal through her company and hiring him for assorted brainstorming projects. You could possibly call Will her pet project. I always thought it was kind of sweet. I admit, it annoyed me that Franny and Will's parents looked at Will as the Golden Boy - none of them have ever acknowledged that I am a writer, and just as talented as he is; in fact, they all (in the past - Will's parents have been wonderful lately) pretty much dismissed me as worthless.  When Will and I had been living together for about 2 years, Franny called him up and proposed that she pay for him to travel with her to Los Angeles. At this time, Will's goal was to be a screenwriter. Franny's goal, it seems, was to get Will to move 3000 miles away from me at any cost. I wish I were exaggerating or misinterpreting her intentions, but I don't believe I am. Will went to LA with Franny, at my urging (it seemed like a good idea). He was there for a week, and when he came back he was distant and weird. I admit, so was I. In fact, I did some things I am very much not proud of. Regardless, when he announced that he was moving to Los Angeles as soon as possible, he made no effort to include me in the proposal. We were broke, and me going with him was not an option. He didn't ask for my opinion. I got drunk a lot after he left and did something very hurtful. It was ugly. I believe (though it may not be fair) that Franny had poisoned his mind against me.  So Will moved to LA, and as pretty much everyone knows things went well for him. He isn't a screenwriter, but is doing quite well as a creative executive. He and I worked through everything and I moved out here in April of last year.  I'd been here for a few weeks (maybe a month) when Franny called and said she'd be in LA for a few days, and could she buy us lunch? Of course we said yes, because we're that sort of people. So we had lunch, and I still felt the strange "Will is a better person than you are" vibe from her, but I wrote it off as insecurity and paranoia. Anyway, the food was very good.  [Digression: Good grief, I am famished.]   Several months after this lunch, Will told me that he'd received a letter from Franny shortly after the lunch. She had, as I understand it, written several pages on Why Annika Is Not For Will. She thinks I am beneath him, she thinks that I will drive a permanent wedge between him and his parents. I never saw it, but I am certain that it was even more revolting than it sounds. Will was so furious that he ripped it up and sent it back. We haven't heard from Franny since. She's off the guest list for our someday wedding.  So yesterday I found out that my Grandpa had died. Will came home at lunchtime, and we ate together. We were cuddling on the couch, enjoying the few minutes before he had to go back to work, when the phone rang. I expected it to be my father, and answered it.  It was Franny. For me.  This is where my week went from Kinda Crappy to Ultra Surreal. (This is also where the actual story begins.)  Her company had some merchandise arrive at a vendor in LA in less-than-perfect condition. She never saw the merchandise, because it came straight from the manufacturor in China. As best I can understand, it was a Nativity scene and the people had straw hair. The manufacturors had not trimmed the straw, and the little people had straw hair in their faces. The vendor was displeased. Now, as if that wasn't weird by itself, she was calling to ask if I would be interested in (I swear to god) going to Van Nuys, picking up the merchandise, bringing it home, and  cutting their hair.   I explained that my grandfather had just died and I didn't know yet when the funeral was. She asked if I would check with Will and see if we could think of anyone else who might do it. She found out that the funeral would be in Pittsburgh and actually got  excited.  "Oh, so we can see you!" I swear, that is what she said. I managed to not reply, "No, you can't, because you are a rabid bitch who should have been put down a long time ago."  The whole conversation, I was just waiting for Will to point out the hidden camera. Except, I knew that even if it was a joke, he wasn't in on it. I was so confused. I honestly didn't believe it was real until Will's mom came on the line to offer her condolences. She asked me to call her if I needed anything while I was in town, which may have just been an empty gesture but I truly believe was sincere.  I finally hung up, relayed the entire conversation to Will, and collapsed on the couch, alternately laughing and crying.  I explained the situation to the one person I know who might have done it if the money was good, and I think he laughed even more than I did. Then I took a nap because my head hurt, and I didn't wake up until Will came home. I didn't know what to do about calling Franny back. I avoided it.  This morning I drove Will to work, and on the way I begged him to deal with it. That worked out nicely, as he just called his mom.  And that, my friends, is why I am considering getting Caller I.D.

      I think this should be in list form. I shall call the list  This Week Sucked.    Warren Zevon died. This was not unexpected, but that doesn't make it suck less.  Will had a sucky week at work. Very busy, lots of thinking about the future.  Will is going away for the weekend, for Alan's bachelor shindig. In and of itself, this is a good thing, but I hate being separated from him, especially considering everything else.  My grandfather died. Not terribly unexpected, but very sad for my family. And - I realize this will sound callous - terribly timed. I spent the better part of a day worrying about travel arrangements. I still haven't worked out how I'll get to the airport, but that's the least of my worries. At least I have a ticket, thanks to Crystal. Orbitz made me cry.  Johnny Cash died. Yet again, not unexpected. Doesn't make it less crappy.  John Ritter died. NOOOOO! This one was totally unexpected and is just depressing as all hell. I don't know why it is upsetting me more than a death in my immediate family. I imagine I will be more upset about my grandpa once I actually see my Grandma and my cousins and Aunts and Uncles.  The anniversary of the World Trade Center. I cried when reading  urlLink this.   I'm hungry. Trust me, when everything else sucks, this is a tragedy.

      OK, so. My day has gotten increasingly surreal, to the point that I'm not sure who I am. Seriously, it has been that weird.  Rather than rehashing all of the WEIRD CRAP that has happened, I am going to instead make an announcement that has  Nothing to do with me.  Hopefully it will provide some much-needed relief.   urlLink Casting announced for new Batman feature.   (Now with tasty Permalink!)  And the Caped Crusader will be played by...  Christian Bale!    I am super-duper splendiferously ultra mega excited. Please join me in jumping around the room like a (really happy) spazz.

      I was idly thinking about writing something about the events of 2 years ago. When I came online this morning, I checked my sister's blog. Just as I was reading the words "RIP Louis John Barranti" the telephone rang. It was my father, calling (with remarkable timing) to tell me that my grandfather had died in his sleep last night. He was 84 years old and had carried oxygen with him everywhere for the last several years as a result of emphazema. All of my cousins (I have a LOT of cousins) called him Pap-pap, but I didn't know him much when I was little and always called him Grandpa.  I'm not really sad yet. Not for myself. I'm sad for my father. I'm sad that I'll never see my Grandpa again. He was always so pleased to see me on the rare occasion that I went to family gatherings. But I'm not sad-sad. I suppose it will come.  I'm trying to decide whether I ought to fly east. The arrangements haven't yet been made, but I imagine the funeral will be in the next few days. I checked Orbitz (I've found that bereavement fairs are usually higher than online deals) and found some very reasonable flights to Pittsburgh, but I don't know what days I'd need to fly on.   *sigh*

      I just got off the phone with  urlLink Steve Fleischman . One more conversation like this and I doubt he will be able to walk, or feed himself, or really do anything unassisted. I was  brutal.  And now, of course, I am wishing I had said other, even nastier things.  Our court date, you see, is the week after next, and poor poor Steve Fleischman doesn't want to "waste his time."  Steve, I wave my little monkey   ass at you.

      I wish they still showed Peewee's Playhouse on television.   Also.  Will's dad (who I shall from now on refer to as Stephen, because that is his name) is going to be in San Diego in two weeks and will be stopping in to see us for a day or two. I suppose this means I will have to eventually dust and vacuum.   And finally,  it would be really nice if the internet could stop being so boring.

      In January it will be six years since I met Will.  It's such a cliche, but I feel as though I've known him my whole life. In a way, I guess I have. When we met I was 19 and was slowly changing and evolving; I didn't know where I was going or who I would turn out to be. I discovered the person I am now  with  him.  I often forget that there was a period in these last 6 years when we were not together. From June of 2000 to April of 2002 we lived apart. For a large portion of that time we were broken up; I couldn't tell you what portion, precisely, since it sort of went off-on-off-on-on-off-yuck-on-I don't know. We tried everything from maintaining a long-distance relationship to seeing other people to not speaking. None of it worked. We took turns not believing it, and were probably even right to do so, but frankly I think we just had to be together. Maybe not at the time, but ultimately.  We're not married, though I have a piece of paper somewhere that says we are. Nevermind. (Sorry, Mindi. Someday, I promise.) Most of the couples I know in our age range are married or engaged, but have been together for a lot less time than we have. There is nothing wrong with this, I just find it interesting. Occasionally I get annoyed that we haven't gotten married yet, but mostly I don't care. Will might dispute that claim, I don't know.  A few things bother me. The big one is when people assume that married couples are closer or have a more developed relationship than ours. Balls to that. All couples are different. (Related to this is when well-meaning people try to give me relationship advice.)  I hope nobody was expecting me to have a point.  Oh! You know what else bothers me? The idea that friends should come before boyfriends.  My  friends don't come before Will.  No one  comes before Will. He is as important to me as I am. He is my best friend, and my partner, and my puppy. I would never willingly fuck over a girl friend because of him, or a boy friend for that matter, but he is  it  for me.  That could stand to be repeated: Will is  it  for me.  Thank you. I did have a point after all.

      Warren Zevon passed away in his sleep yesterday after being diagnosed last year with terminal lung cancer.  The saddest and most beautiful thing I have ever read about death is from  By The Shores of Silver Lake  by Laura Ingalls Wilder, after Laura's bulldog Jack dies:  "Don't cry, Laura," Pa said. "He has gone to the Happy Hunting Grounds."  "Truly, Pa?" Laura managed to ask.  "Good dogs have their reward, Laura," Pa told her.  Perhaps, in the Happy Hunting Grounds, Jack was running gaily in the wind over some high prairie, as he used to run over the beautiful wild prairies of Indian Territory. Perhaps at last he was catching a jack rabbit. He had tried so often to catch one of those long-eared, long-legged rabbits and never could.

      (That is the title of a Pietasters song. The song is, obviously, about me.)  So I haven't been around much this week. I know that you have all noticed, because you left so many comments asking me where I was and why I wasn't blogging. [meaningful glare]   The reason for my absence is that I was performing labor in exchange for money. I think civilized people refer to this as "work." As I am uncivilized, I will refer to it as "extortion." There is no reasoning behind this word choice. Jenn works for a catering company, and I was their extra kitchen help this week. I think the technical term might be either "prep cook" or "whipping boy." I'm not sure because I have never done either professionally before. It was rather grueling extortion, as I had to leave the house by 7:00 each morning and did not get home until after 5:00. Also I was on my feet all day and chopping things is not as easy on the shoulders as I had thought. As a result, I was pretty much jelly at the end of each day, to the point that Will actually made dinner. Not that he isn't capable of doing so, just that it is usually my task. I extorted Wednesday through Saturday, which means that I missed a large chunk of my usual weekend sloth. We made up for it by having the Best (rest of the) Weekend Ever.  Last night Jenn came over, bringing supplies for supper. She cooked dumplings and we had them with some kim chi. Then she and Will drank beer and we all listened to music for hours. A vast majority of it was ska, which was nice because we rarely listen to any of our reasonably large collection anymore. After Jenn left and Will went to bed I caught up on 4 days' worth of WD posts. YIKES. That was quite a task. There was a great moment when Beth and I were the only two people online, and we were going to have sex, but there was an anonymous lurker and we were concerned that It might watch.  Speaking of the WD...No. Nevermind.  This afternoon Will and I had the following exchange after eating yummy homemade sushi (really maki, but nevermind):  Will: I  do  wish I had Matty's metabolism... Annika: Well, you've got a foot on him,  anyway. Will: Yes, and in more than one place! Hee. I miss that short, yellow-haired, ugly motherfucker. He never writes. (I think I can accept his illiteracy as an excuse, but it is wearing thin.)  And finally, I don't know if she reads this, but tomorrow is Rian's birthday. Love you, muffin.

      If you sent me email yesterday (Wednesday 29 October) to my msn account, I did not get it. Apparently when you go over your account size limit, they stop delivering your mail (including, ironically, the "Your account is too large" email they send automatically). Bastards!  Hee. My account is too large. Tell that to the spammers who want me to make it bigger!

      I refer, of course, to Daylight Savings Time. When it begins every spring, mornings are pure hell. When it ends every autumn, it is a struggle to stay up at night and maintain a normal sleep schedule.  I have a theory: this was never about the farmers. It is all about TORTURE.  Think about it: What is the clever saying to remember which way to turn the clock? "Spring forward, fall back." First of all, it would be more accurate to say, "Spring forward, fall down." Second of all, TORTURE.  If I were a farmer, I'd start working when the sun came up and stop when it set. The clock is irrelevant.  Irrelevant.   I am so annoyed. Not to mention ready for bed.

      I have never heard anyone who is not a homophobe say that they believe homosexuality to be a choice.  EDIT: If you are illiterate, or Matty, or both, here is an alternate version of the above sentence, just for you.  I have only ever heard homophobes say that homosexuality is a choice.

      You've been warned.   I don't even  like  fantasy!   Clearly, this is a patent falsehood, particularly if Amazon.com is anyone to listen to on the subject. On "The Page You Made," the following films (and television series) are prominently listed:  The Princess Bride, Willow, X-Men, X2, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Firefly, The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers, The Indiana Jones trilogy, The Neverending Story ...good gravy, it keeps going.  Legend, The Goonies, The Matrix Reloaded...  It would seem to the untrained eye that I am the World's Biggest Fantasy Fan. Granted, I've seen (and loved) all but one of these, but that is irrelevant.  "There's lots of 'relevants in the circus."   *sigh*   I miss my dad.   The weekend   Though exhausting, it was wonderful. Our room was upgraded to a suite, with a sitting room and sliding double doors and a  huuuuuuge  bed and it was wonderful. We were very decadent and ordered room service twice.  The wedding itself was just lovely, with the bride crying and the groom unable to repeat the "for better or for worse" part without screwing it up. He was so sweetly nervous. On Sunday morning, we met him briefly to fill out another of the forms (for a copy of the certificate, I think), and he was  glowing.  I want to get married right this minute.  Well, I suppose I'd like to shower first. And maybe have dinner. So what the hell, I guess I'll wait until next year as planned.   Phoebe is hilarious   "I spend all my time when I'm unable to contact him wishing I were able to contact him, and all my time when I am able to contact him not feeling able to. It's so frustrating being a teenage girl!"   Driving into the apocalypse   On the way to the wedding, we drove from downtown Los Angeles, which was clear and sunny, into Hell. The sky was grey and brown, the sun was a strange ball of orange. We passed two horrible accidents. That night, during the reception, we went out on a balcony. In the distance we could see what appeared to be the fires of Mount Doom. It was completely unreal, and beautiful. The air smelled sweet, like a campfire. It was raining ashes.  They're saying that arson is a possibility. On the other hand, southern California ecosystems have natural fires. It is part of life. I cannot begin to understand why people would build their multi-million dollar homes in areas where these fires are known to occur.   Everything else   The house is still a mess, finances are still sticky (I had to turn down work because of the wedding), I cancelled a trip to Disneyland and am sad because I'll be missing a chance to see Saren and Harper (and their parents), something's wrong with the car, and I am hungry. Time to figure out what's for dinner.    In conclusion,    Alias  just keeps getting funnier and more ridiculous.  Everwood  just keeps getting better. And...that's it for my TV watching lately. We did, however, get a DVD of some X-Files episodes from Netflix. If Will figured correctly, it includes the episode with Luke Wilson. YAY!

      Yesterday we drove to Riverside for a rehearsal and rehearsal dinner for our friends Alan and Kim's wedding. Riverside is a beautiful little historical town, and the Mission Inn, where the wedding will be, is absolutely stunning. Today we will be driving back for the wedding and spending the night. This time I am bringing extra shoes, though my feet may never forgive me for yesterday.  I don't even know what I'm going to wear. Even worse, neither does Will, and he is performing the ceremony, which means he has to find something.  I am so far behind on everything. The house is filthy, I owe people email and letters and phone calls and who knows what else, I still haven't finished reading books I started in June.  Ahhh. I love being able to update before I even post these things. UPDATE: I found something to wear. It's this dress I bought at a Salvation Army a million years ago without even trying it on. Turns out that it fits, and I look extremely attractive in it. And the shirt that Will thought he couldn't wear is actually fine. Phew!  In other news, Will is currently making me a second cup of coffee.  OK. I have to go throw in a load of laundry and pack for the night. I'll be back sometime Sunday, presumably just in time to find out if I am correct in thinking that Sydney put the  thing  on Vaughn instead of on the  other thing . (How's that for a non-spoilery theory based on spoilery stuff? And I know I'm right, because Noah posted the same theory.)

      Ugh. How hard can it be to find a ring, right? Men buy rings for women all the time, and the women tend to wear them.  Alas, it appears that all of the engaged women in the known universe either have dreadfully bad taste or men with top-secret connections.  Since I plan to wear this ring forever*, it seems to me that I ought to like it. It also needs to be within our budget (currently five cents and falling). So I've been looking for one myself.  All I want in this world (besides another Peppermint Patty - yum) is a bezel** set diamond with a thin, white gold band. I do not want the diamond to sit very high off my finger, and I'd prefer it to be small and imperfect, like me. Apparently, such a ring does not exist. I'm sure there are jewelers who could make such a ring to my specifications, but they charge for stuff like that, and besides, that would require actually finding a jeweler I like, as opposed to just finding a  ring  that I like.   *They'll have to pry it off my cold, dead hands. Literally, as I plan to be a fat old lady. **That's rub over, for the non-Americans.

      We just watched  Alias.  That is the dumbest show ever, and it is really growing on me. I like watching a show that I have no expectations for, because it always exceeds them.  I have a theory, but I can't be bothered to spoiler-tag it at the moment, so nevermind. Anyway, as I said to Will, it is entirely possible that the show isn't even as smart as me, which would mean they never thought of doing [the thing that my theory consists of].

      I would say that my evening is much improved, but it's all relative. While I was buying milk and a carrot (if you must know, I got  two  carrots), Will was hanging out with Vince Vaughn.

      But I need milk! And a carrot! (No, really.) But on the other hand, I need to do some  real  grocery shopping (not that I plan to buy fake milk and a fake carrot, but hopefully you know what I mean), and I'll probably do that tomorrow, so why can't I just stay in my chair, wearing my dirty clothes that I've been wearing since yesterday and were probably already dirty when I put them on then, and stare at my computer some more, wishing that I hadn't read all of Margaret Cho's blog in one go, and just not worry about it? Why do I need milk and a carrot anyway? Oh yeah, so that I can have coffee in the morning, and finish dinner. And don't tell me that my coffee will be fine black, or dinner will taste just as good without a carrot, because it isn't true and you know it!  My dad is in New York right now, and I want to go hang out with him, because in the last five minutes or so I've entered one of my phases of really, really missing New York. And I miss my dad a lot too, but I always miss my dad, and I only miss New York occasionally.  Maybe if I had a car I wouldn't get so restless, but on the other hand I'd probably still just sit at home, only on top of doing Notalot, I could add on some guilt over the expense of a second car, even one that isn't being driven - especially one that isn't being driven, because in that case what the hell am I insuring it against anyway?  I hope Will comes home soon, he usually knows what to do with me when I am feeling this way, and even if he does the wrong thing, there's a chance that it will piss me off - and I hate to get pissed off at him, especially for things that are not his fault in any way, shape, or form, but at least I'd be feeling different, and I think he'd forgive me.  Restless isn't a good word for how I'm feeling, but I don't think there is one. At least, not in English, and so far that is the only language I have any complex understanding of.  I put  Equillibrium  back on our Netflix queue, and it will arrive soon, but not until I send back the movies that we haven't even watched yet, because I haven't fetched them from the mailbox, because I'm too lazy to get up out of my chair, even for a nap or a bath or something else that would make me feel better, nevermind to check the mail.  The good news is that the store is open 24 hours, and I can walk there, and it's only 2 blocks away, unlike Ralphs which I won't go to right now because they don't respect the union. So I'll go later.

       urlLink CHUD  is having a contest in which they are giving out passes to  Alien  (coming soon to a theater near you). Unfortunately, I don't live in one of the cities they have passes for, so I thought I'd just answer them here, and buy my own ticket.  Ton  [sic]  win a chance at a pass, use the correct link below, include your mailing address, and tell me what you would do with Alien 5 if given the keys to the kingdom.  1. No Ripley. Look, I love Sigourney Weaver, even though my sweetheart really, really, really wants to have sex with her, but Ripley's story is really, really, really over. 2. I'd like to see the story of someone else - say, Jonesy. That's right, the cat. Oh, he's dead? I suppose a few flashbacks would be acceptable. 3. The existing formula is basically that scientists are bad, because they want to experiment on the aliens rather than destroy them. Maybe it would work out better for the franchise if, rather than continuing that formula, we had a story from the scientists' point of view. Maybe there is some actual gain to be had from studying these creatures - I don't know, a cure for cancer or something. Or is that too X-Files? 4. I loved Alien Cubed, but it started off really crappily; let's bring back Michael Biehn, OK?  In other news, either I've got Spyware on my machine or imdb has been hacked. I was going to double-check the cat's name, but now I can't be bothered.

      There is a lot of street parking in my neighborhood. We live in a building with underground assigned parking for its residents, but many of the nearby buildings have either no parking provided or limited parking, which means that only some residents have an assigned parking space. Hence, street parking.   A very large portion of the cars (both on the street and in my very own building's garage) are equipped with anti-theft devices of the LOUD OBNOXIOUS ALARM variety. I have gotten quite accustomed to these alarms going off at inconvenient times (e.g., when I am asleep).  Last night we went to bed around midnight. Several times throughout the night, the same car alarm went off. It seems to be triggered every time another vehicle drives past it. The second-to-last time that it went off was at approximately 7:00, promting Will and I to notice our alarm clock. Normally I stay in bed until between 8:00 and 8:30, but the noise was too jolting for me to even attempt to fall back to sleep. The last time it went off I actually got out of bed, where I'd been pouting, and looked out the window to determine what vehicle the offensive noise was coming from. (I would have looked sooner, but the car's owner must have a window overlooking his parking space, because he'd turned the alarm off each time it sounded.)  I went downstairs and wrote down the make, model, and license plate number. I came back upstairs, wrote a (reasonably friendly) note, and went back down to put it on the windshield. The stairs have windows facing the street at each landing, and I saw a man standing near the car; there was another man on the stairs ahead of me. As the man ahead of me exited the building, I saw the man on the sidewalk get into the car. As soon as the other man reached the sidewalk, the car owner drove off. I suspect that he'd seen me write down his info and knew that he was not very popular.  I considered calling the local police and asking if they could do anything, but decided to be practical (I would hate to waste an officer's time) and look up the noise ordinance laws in LA first.  SEC. 114.06. VEHICLE THEFT ALARM SYSTEMS.  (Former Sec. 114.05, Renumbered by Ord. No. 164,532, Eff. 4/20/89.)  It shall be unlawful for any person to install, operate or use any vehicle theft alarm system that emits or causes the emission of an audible sound, which is not, or does not become, automatically and completely silenced within five minutes. The time period shall be calculated based upon the emission of the first audible sound and shall end five minutes thereafter notwithstanding any variation or stoppage in the emissions of audible sound. Violation of this section shall constitute an infraction.  My interpretation of this is that, because the asshat turned off his alarm each time it sounded (within five minutes), there is NOTHING I can do. This makes me furious. I am still reading the document, to see if there is an exception for repeated noises, but it isn't looking good.  All I can think of as a course of action is to hunt down the car tonight and leave a (slightly less polite) note. Which will, I imagine, accomplish absolutely nothing.  Damn it.

      Let's just call this a shout-out to my new posse of insane novel writers: Lauren, Stephanie, Beth, Jess, Danielle, other Annika, Pat, Katherine and Jenny Lane. If I am missing anyone, please let me know. We can all be crazy together!  Honorary shout-outs go to Crystal and Heath, who are finishing screenplays instead of writing novels.

      I know, I know, I was already crazy. I'll explain in a moment.  First I would like to state that last night's episode of  Angel  was possibly the worst hour of television that I have ever sat through.  Anyway, the reason for my claims of insanity. A few weeks ago, Lauren posted a link to  urlLink National Novel Writing Month , the objective of which is to write a 50,000 word novel in just 30 days - in November, to be specific. I checked it out, and thought to myself,  What a neat idea.  But I kept thinking about it. See, the problem with me is that I'm a writer who doesn't write. I had this long conversation with Dustin last month about writing, and he said some things that really rang true for me - but I haven't done anything with them. One thing he said is that if you're not writing, you don't have writer's block - you're just not writing.  So I signed up. There's no penalty for not finishing, and no prize if you do - it's just a matter of trying. Something about the concept of quantity over quality appeals to me, in a masochistic sort of way. I have no idea what my novel will be about, though I have some brilliant ideas for filler and a vague idea for a main character.  November is bound to be interesting.

      Dear Sir or Madam,  Although there are Crazy People out there who don't enjoy commentary tracks, I am certain that they are recorded in the first place for the benefit of those of us who are, not to put too fine a point on it, totally addicted to them. Before I get into the bulk of this letter, I would like to thank you for taking the time to make us squeal with delight.  Now, a few suggestions.  One. Please be aware that, with rare exception, we have seen the movie or television show before watching it with commentary. Probably more than once.  Two. We are aware of who the actors are, or, if we are not, we are capable of watching the credits. If you feel inclined to tell us about the actors or characters, please include information that is not in the credits or the episode/movie.  Three. We have eyes. We can see what's happening on our television screen. A play-by-play is not required. We'd love to know how you set up a shot or why you did something the way you did, as long as it isn't mind-numbingly boring. Keep in mind that we're the audience, not your colleague.  Four. We are fans. That means that, in addition to the points above, we want  dirt.  This doesn't necessarily mean that we want to know who played the Diva on any given day, but that we'd like some sort of behind-the-scenes insight. As the commentator, it is up to you to determine what form this will take. Just make it interesting, OK?  Five. This one may sound personal, but please do not take offense. If your voice has a monotone, flat, or remarkably nasal  sound to it, please see a vocal coach before recording a commentary track. We like our ears, most of us.  Thank you.

      Last night our friend Geoff took us out for dinner to celebrate our engagement. (Aside: more people should do this. We love food.) We went to a fantastic little Italian restaurant in Los Feliz, where we ate so much (not to mention all the wine) that it's a miracle we were able to move afterward. In addition to buying us dinner, he gave us an engagement gift (please see above) of the season 2  Angel  DVDs.  YYYYYYAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAYYYYYYYYYYYYY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  This morning I woke up and made breakfast. Potatoes, scrambled eggs, sausage, and pancakes. Will made capuccino. It was all sooooo good. After we ate, we watched the featurettes and  Are You Now or Have You Ever Been  with commentary, and then just started the episodes as background. Perfect Saturday.  In other news, I found out  where  to vote, now I just have to decide  how  to vote. Stupid recall.  That reminds me - I've been trying to figure out how to categorize my political leanings. Not that I particularly  want  to put myself in a box, but I am just so tired of being called this (liberal), that (Democrat) and the other thing (I don't know) with no basis. I think later I will post all of my beliefs that I think are relevant and let you all tell me.

      One of my favorite bloggers,  urlLink Steph , is going through another rough period. I'm mentioning it because I know many of us have been through similar experiences - she's stuck living with her parents after living away from home for some time, she is separated from her sweetheart, Andy (who she lived with until recently), she lost her job, and frankly she just sounds depressed. I've been through all of those things separately - I can't even begin to imagine the stress of dealing with all of them at once! So send her an email or your good mojo for things to get better, won't you?

      Damn you, Stephanie! And damn me for doing it to you first! I really don't have anything to say.  The WD is driving me batty. Well, not the WD itself, but a few select posters who are doing their best to ruin it for the rest of the class. And, surprisingly, not the normal ones. Lately (read: yesterday and yesterday only) I've found myself agreeing with a great deal of what youknowwho and YouKnowWho2 have been saying. Also, it looks like Throaty might be back. Wheeeeee!  Oh! Very big news. Today I took my sweatpants off. Then I showered. Then I put them back on. I expect Will to stop touching me any day now.  I forgot to mention the other day that we watched the premier of  Alias , which we've both been thoroughly unimpressed by in the past, and rather enjoyed it. I doubt that we'll be tuning in religiously, but at least I sort of get it now. Phew! I was really worried.  In conclusion, I have to pee. Bye!

      Or perhaps, as none of my fantasies involve being ill (which I was this weekend), I ought to say  A Weekend of Fantasy .  On Wednesday our copy of  The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers  Extended Edition DVD arrived. We watched the first disc Wednesday evening, with a brief interruption to watch  Angel ; Thursday during the day I watched the first disc again, with Director/Writer commentary (discovering in the process what a wicked sense of humor Fran has - not that I'd expect any less); Thursday evening we watched disc 2 and began watching the special features (I was fast asleep well before the first segment ended); Friday I watched disc 2 with the same commentary, and we spent the weekend with special features and cast commentary.  What I may not have mentioned is that about a week ago I began re-reading the Prydain chronicles by Lloyd Alexander. I love these books, and a conversation with our friend Geoff about how to adapt them to the screen prompted me to refresh my memory of the story. I've read the first three - and would have read the fourth if not for the fact that it was one of the books that got doused in shampoo when I moved, and I never got around to cleaning it. I really must do that, but probably won't before leaving for Thanksgiving.  This afternoon, while debating whether to watch TTT with Design Team or Post-Production commentary, I remembered that Netflix had sent us the BBC  Neverwhere , and suggested that we watch that, which we did. It was not bad, though the production quality made me cringe. Most of the performances were better than I expected, and the only one that really disappointed me was Hunter. If they couldn't get someone who could act, they might have gotten someone who could fight, or, barring both qualities, someone who looked like a girl. (Yes, now I am just being mean.)  What this all comes down to is that I was lying. I  LOVE  fantasy. It's just that I am picky about it.

      As you all probably know, Will and I have been watching Alias rather sporadically this season, after having hated it with a firey passion for the 2 prior seasons. (By sporadically, I mean every episode but last week's.) We have been amused, both by the show itself and by each other as we correct the glaring mistakes made every five seconds. It's fun to yell at the TV, especially during a show which you are not emotionally invested in.  [spoilers]  Sydney didn't wear a wig! And it's not looking good for next week (er, two weeks from now) either! I am totally going to stop watching this show.  ALSO. Either Sloane and SpyMommy are in cahoots, and she translated the code for him and he told on Sydney, or SpyDaddy is  evil.   I prefer the latter, because I am so irritated with the whole "We can't tell anyone that Sydney did something she can't even remember because they might actually use their resources to help her and thereby make the season only last three episodes" thing.  Also-also, what is up with the Actors Who Look Like Other Actors? I thought Sloane was played by Joel Grey and Lauren by Olivia D'Abo. I was wrong on both counts, clearly, so either I am an idiot or the casting is weird.  And finally, where was Spy That I Love? (The...guy. Who I think is cute.)  [/spoilers]  In conclusion, I am REALLY FUCKING TIRED.

       urlLink CHUD - Cinematic Happenings Under Development : "Revisionist Oscars - 2001"  Everybody knows that I love Nick Nunziata almost as much as I love mashed potatoes. At least, I did. Now he is asking me to choose between Peter Jackson (for  Fellowship of the Ring ), Wes Anderson (for  The Royal Tenenbaums ) and Ridley Scott (for  Black Hawk Down ) as Best Director of 2001.  As choosing between my three favorite films  ever  is clearly impossible, I will now have to cause someone physical harm in order to make myself feel better.

      Will did a little money dance this morning. It was so cute, but completely hindered by the little dance I did to a totally different song.  I was woken up this morning by the telephone, but that's all right because it was my boss asking me to work all of next week. Which is actually a horrifying prospect, but the money will really come in handy, especially when you consider that we pre-ordered The Two Towers yesterday.  TINY HOBBITS!  ...Sorry.  (Actually, my little outburst is quite amusing when you consider that I am most excited by the Battle of Helm's Deep and the extended footage of Faramir and Boromir-my-one-true-love.)  I am either going to use the extra money (what's left after the DVDs and some booze) to pay off some of the credit card debt or to buy some storage-y bedroom furniture, which we are currently sorely lacking. Maybe both.  What amazes me is that despite the financial setbacks of the last few months  and  the engagement ring, we're actually doing better than we have in a while. Still not good, but better. I suppose my dad is to thank for that, since he stepped in with some emergency assistance. I'd like to think that my frugal ways have also played a part. I must say, though, that I  really  miss sushi.

      I grew up in a creaky old house. The wind blows, the house creaks. Hell, you sneeze, the house creaks. I love that creaking, spooky sound.  The noises that our apartment has been making today are nothing like the sounds I grew up with.  It's only happening when the heat's on, but it isn't the furnace, because it's an  apartment , and it's unlikely that it's the pipes, because I know what creaky pipes sound like and this ain't it.  And it isn't even a scary noise. Shouldn't mysterious noises in the house when you're home alone be  scary ?

      Now I'm listening to the Cure and bouncing off the walls. Luckily, early Cure tempos are quite conducive to bouncing in time to the music.  My NaNoWriMo novel is dead in the water (whatever that means). I've written 1015 words and it's already the 4th of the month. I SUCK.  This morning I dropped off a check for my engagement ring. Due to financial constraints, we'll be picking it up on the 15th, rather than the 8th. Still -  Yay!  I picked up about 25 hours of catering work this past week, so things shouldn't get too bad. On the other hand, ignoring the car trouble hasn't made it go away. Damn car. It's so uncooperative.  In other news, Stacey sent us the season 1  Buffy  DVDs. She rocks SO HARD.  Hee. I love the 80s - only 80s pop music can make a full kit sound like a drum machine. Unfortunately, non-metal 80s albums are ridiculously short, so I've moved on to pre-fame Green Day. My tastes in music are so  random.  (I would say ecclectic, but that would imply that I like a wide variety of  good  music, which is just not true.)  WHEN WILL THIS CAFFEINE HIGH END?   ...I have to go.

      Will and I went out to run errands today after I got off work. First we went to his office because he couldn't find his paycheck at home (it was next to his desk, and is now deposited). Then we went to the first of three jewelry stores on the list I had made. From the phone book.  I love you, phone book! The first store was the only store we went to, because it was  awesome.  The saleslady was very nice, and the jeweler himself was a hoot, and they had stunningly gorgeous vintage rings that we can't afford. They also do beautiful custom work, and they had a ring that was very similar to what I wanted, and when I told Karen (the saleslady) how I wanted it changed,  she understood  exactly  and described my perfect ring to Sam the Jeweler, who said he will have it ready by next Saturday. They wanted a deposit but we hadn't brought the checkbook (it never occured to me that we'd find something), and Karen was completely wonderful about it and said to just call or stop by on Tuesday with the money.  The diamond is actually a little bit larger than I'd been thinking of, but it was beautiful and I'm sure that between the rock and the custom work it's worth way more than $800 (at least to me), so yay.

      We woke up this morning to discover that the power was out in our building. Upon further investigation, we found that the entire power grid is out. Fun! It's still out, as far as I know. We're at Jenn's apartment, which, though only 2 blocks away, is apparently in a different grid.  Shelby & Wanda's plane is probably landing around now. Guests during a blackout!  More fun!   Remarkably, we got tons accomplished today around the house, by candlelight and maglite. We got our new chest of drawers home with Jenn's help and put away all of our clothes. Of course, whenever I get around to washing the piles and piles of laundry, we will still not have room for everything. Oh well.  Cassie gave us our X-Mas presents just now. More movies! X2 and Princess Bride. Yay! And she gave Will the new Bosstones album and a Jill Tracy album. We love Cassie.  Happy New Year, everybody. See you next year.

      Today Will and I went to Sears and liberated a puppy. He's a tiny black lab and his name is bean. Not, as one might expect, for Sean Bean (which I only just thought of), but because his belly is full of beans. His fur is plush and he fits on mommy's shoulder. I have not yet introduced him to the pigs and the lion, but will do so at bed time.  Speaking of bed, I am very excited! While we were out, we also went to Linens 'n Things again, because we needed new pillows. My neck and shoulders have been bothering me immensely, and I have isolated the problem as being the fault of ancient pillows. I found one of those foam contour pillows for only $30! I hope the quality is good - last I checked, those babies sold for more like a C-note.  All in all, our day was far too productive, as seems to be our habit lately. I'm hoping to break that one soon. I need some lazy time (sleeping in until almost noon today notwithstanding).

      (The previous entry doesn't count. Not because it's a quiz, though I'd use that only as a last resort entry, but because I made it before I went to bed last night, so it was sort of a Saturday entry.)  So, today was far too productive. We worked on organizing the kitchen (having gotten a fantastic cart from my dad yesterday to help with storage issues), I fixed the DVD player so it'll play widescreen for everything (except, obviously, the few retarded DVDs out there that are fullscreen), Will took apart and cleaned the grill, and I checked out his old computer to see if it would work as a second computer/gaming system. It might be too slow and not have enough memory or hard disc space for some stuff, but I can't be sure yet because I couldn't convince it to recognize a keyboard, which made it difficult to experiment. Still, I think it was a success if for no other reason than the fact that I turned off my own computer in order to borrow the monitor. And at least we know the Beast still runs, even if we don't know how well.  Anyway, I was getting tired and a bit grumpy, so Will helped me get everything hooked back up to my computer and put on the  Batman  theme, which cheered me up enormously.  I think we might have done some other stuff as well, but I'm drawing a blank. I don't think the fact that we ate and washed the dishes really qualifies as accomplishment. On the other hand, we did both, so I'll count them.  Yesterday was also quite a full day, now that I think about it - we went to Linens 'n Things to pick up the cart (the online store is out of stock or I'd link to a picture - it's so pretty!), and stopped at the army/navy surplus store for a t-shirt for Will, where I tried on some helmets (Kevlar is  heavy ), and then went to our favorite furniture store, where we got our coffee table, and bought a dresser. Finally, we will have places to put all of our clothes! Not until later in the week, as they are going to fix it up first, but hopefully by the New Year. Which reminds me, must ask Jenn if we can borrow her truck...I don't believe it will fit in our sedan. By which I mean, it is huge and we could possibly fit a drawer or two into our sedan.  Will talked to his mom today and asked her how old he was when he started reading. He was aghast until I told him that I started late too. Thing is, we both took our time but immediately jumped in to reading "real" books. I'm the fastest reader I had ever met until I met him. He doesn't actually read, he eats books.  This is coming out very disjointed.  Will's mom also wanted to know if I was working this week. That woman is never going to accept the fact that I don't work full time. I told Will that it doesn't bother me as long as he is OK with it, but I'm not sure that was true. I think her questioning may have contributed to my bad mood.  Thank goodness for  Batman.  Will loves me.

      Not the "desert" kind of cookies, of course. (I laughed and laughed over that typo when Mindi pointed it out. Um, I think it was Mindi. I am WAY too lazy to check.) The computer kind of cookies. I've had to sign into stuff all over the place that I had all but forgotten required logins. For example, I occasionally have to log into the WD, but I always have to log out oslowe first. Not today! Today I had to log in because I deleted my cookies. Also I had to log into Blogger and Blurty and probably something else. And I am totally screwed if I go the New York Times website, because I stay logged in there and I don't even know what email address I registered, let alone the password. I guess I will forgo news from now on. That will be OK.  It's so sad. Where do the deleted cookies go? Is there a cookie heaven? Is there a cookie hell for the spy cookies?  I am thinking about this way too much, and most likely not making any sense.  Will is watching  Black Hawk Down  special features. I am not likely to be online long. All of the information is transmitting to me aurally, but I can't see the pretty, pretty men. Well, the pretty men and Jerry Bruckheimer.  Oh, man.

      Because we simply did not have enough deserts in the house (by last count, brownies, cookies, fudge, more cookies, and some cookies), when we went to the store for coffee just now we picked up Profiteroles and an apple pie. I don't think I have  ever  purchased a pre-made pie before, but there is a first time for everything, or so I am told. It is usually a point of pride for me to make pies from scratch, but frankly, it is the day after Christmas and the thought of taking the time is unappealing at best.  We've spent pretty much all day with our shiny new  Firefly  DVDs. We love Jenn. When we're through with these, we have the  Black Hawk Down  special edition to play with, also from Jenn, and  Neverwhere  from my mom, and  Sullivan's Travels  from John (who assures us that we can wait till his visit in February to watch it), and  The Best of Hunter S. Thompson  (which I am afraid of) from Sledge, and  THE ALIEN QUADRILOGY  which my wonderful father gave Will. There is a distinct possibility that we will never leave the house again.

      I was going to make the Best Christmas Eve Blog Entry Ever, but then Will wrote a poem that is better than anything else ever, and since I am already outdone - why bother?  It's almost midnight. Well, almost in the sense that it's more than an hour away.  "Hey! Hey! Unto you a child is born!"  I really like Christmas.

      Yesterday as we were walking through The Grove (a shopping mall of sorts), I told Will that he'd better get me a switch for my stocking, as he'd already given me a lump of coal. I waited a minute for him to get it, and was all set to wave my left hand wildly in his face when he laughed.  I've developed a really obnoxious habit. Whenever Will leaves the apartment - even if it is just to run down the hall to the trash cute - I say, "Go with God." I think I also said this to him once when he was headed to the bathroom. I really don't know what has gotten into me.

      By which I mean Christmas shopping. After spending all day yesterday (slight exaggeration, but only slight) grocery shopping, we went and bought the last of our Christmas gifts today. This included a gift for ourselves. We had originally intended to just buy each other stocking stuffers, but neither of us was much in the mood for that, so we bought a really lovely serving dish set and a pretty ornament that is too heavy for the tree. We also bought cards, which I figure we will probably mail by my birthday (which is in July). Then we came home and I made my WD Secret Santa gift. It took me about five seconds - I hope the recipient doesn't notice. I think it came out very nice.  The whole gift-buying experience was quite painless, though I wish we'd been able to do it sooner. I dislike crowds.  I am sad to announce that Sean and Matt won't be coming for dinner tonight. All this means, though, is that the pork loin, in its Jerk marinade, will be deposited into the freezer for use at a later date. And that I will have to wait until January for  Everwood  spoilers. I am such a snob - I only take spoilers if I can get them from The Source.  Oh! I also had lunch today with Jenn and Chuck (Ghost from the WD). That was nice. I almost went into the Army recruiting office. Not to sign up (I'd go Air Force, I think), but because apparently if you ask for literature and soforth, they give you the Army first-person shooter computer game. I decided that I wasn't in the mood to bring Will a game that my computer probably can't handle, so I skipped it.

      Random fact: at age 9, I was in the local high school's production of  Oliver!  as a boy in the orphanage. I was also credited in the program as the understudy for the Artful Dodger. I still do not know why, as I never rehearsed the role.  I got off the phone a little while ago after talking to Will's father for quite a while. He'd called to tell us all about his new puppy, Palmer, who is terribly clever.  In Klein family tradition, I shall now tell you all about the food that we have eaten recently, and the food that we will be eating this week.  Last night I made pasta. I suppose this isn't very exciting, except perhaps in the fact that I make my own sauce from scratch. Last night's sauce, though, was particularly good, and I also fixed some Italian sausage and a salad. The salad was actually leftover from a carry-out order Will's office had bought Friday, but we dressed it up a little. Will also bought a loaf of excellent Ciabatta from the market, and we had some really nice wine that had come in a gift basket. Jenn ate with us.  Tomorrow night (if the plan is still on), our friend Sean and his boyfriend Matt are coming over for Jamaican. I'm making Jerk pork loin, rice and peas, cornbread, and I don't know what else. Seems like there was something else. Maybe something green.  On Christmas eve I will make pizza. I'm thinking of doing one with Italian sausage and carmelized onions (and possibly mushrooms), one margharita style, and one veggie (with green peppers, onions, olives, and whatever else is lying around).   On Christmas day we are making Mexican food and all of our "orphaned" friends are invited over. There will be Carne Asada, Chile Verde, quesadillas, homemade tortilla chips (from store-bought tortillas), salsa, guacamole, Mexican rice, and refried beans. I'm making everything but the tortillas from scratch (which is why there are no tamales on the list). I may be forgetting some stuff. It will really be a feast.  In addition to all of the regular food, I'm making Chex mix, and doing this thing with walnuts that Will's mom did over Thanksgiving (toasted with butter and curry powder). There are also tons of snacky foods from the gift baskets we received this year (one of them was from Jerry Stiller and Ann Meara!) and all sorts of other stuff.  For the week or so following Christmas I expect that we will be eating leftovers exclusively.

      From Middle Earth, that is. We saw the early evening showing of  Return of the King  last night.  Frankly, there aren't words. Nevertheless, I shall try.  [spoiler for ROTK]   I held off reading this book so that I wouldn't have too many expectations for the movie. I had been undecided on whether I would do this until I read  The Two Towers  and fell in love with Tolkien's version of Faramir.   On the other hand, I spoiled myself silly for the movie -  sort of.  I knew lots of little details that, had I known  how  they added up, would have essentially added up to the story. Some of the details were from the book, some were from the movie. For the most part I didn't know which was which. I did know about the events that were moved from the end of TTT, because there was no way in hell that I'd stop reading a book that fantastic before the end.  The two big things that I did not expect:    Eowyn and the Witch King. I knew the prophesy, that no mortal man could kill him. I'd theorized that perhaps it would be a hobbit (Merry or Pippin, even before knowing their exact roles in this part of the story), and during the movie I became certain that it would be Aragorn, based upon my very limited understanding of the Dunedain. When Eowyn was holding Theoden, I realized that it would be her. When she beheaded the Fell Beast, it actually took me a moment to realize what had happened - not because it was shown poorly (it wasn't), but because it was so stunning and sudden. When she pulled off her helmet, I very nearly cheered.   The eagles. I had NO IDEA, and was so unspeakably happy when they came. Later, when Frodo and Sam were on the rock on the edge of Mount Doom, with the lava flowing around them, I knew that it would be the eagles who'd come to their rescue (I wasn't spoiled, I am just clever), but it never occured to me that Gandalf would be with them, and I cried.  The crying was a bit of a pattern for me throughout the film. I managed to hold the tears back, though they formed in my eyes, until the first sweeping shot of Minis Tirith as Gandalf and Pippin rode up. Yes, it was the architecture that got me. (Shout-out to Jess!) The tears had been in my eyes since  at least  the moment when Merry and Pippin were separated, but this is when they started flowing.  I was very surprised at the number of songs in the movie. Merry and Pippin in Rohan, Pippin to Denethor, and Aragorn. In the two previous films, the songs have only been in the extended cuts. I thought it was lovely to have them in this version.  The utter physical disintigration of Frodo and Sam broke my heart. When Sam carries Frodo up Mount Doom, you can see the bones in tiny Elijah Wood's ass. Their recovery in the end was so sweet to watch, particularly Sam. The moment when he stood up to go talk to Rosie in the Green Dragon was so moving, because it immediately made me think of his reactions to her in the beginning of  Fellowship , and showed how much he changed. Frodo trying to be Frodo again was almost as heartbreaking, and I sobbed and sobbed as he said goodbye to his companions to get on the ship with Gandalf.  I read a review on the WD in which someone was disappointed in Aragorn grabbing Arwen and kissing her. I think that is ridiculous - he won the battle, he was crowned king, and his love came back to him. I would have grabbed her just as quickly, kingliness be damned.  I won't even mention the moment when Aragorn and all of Gondor bowed to the hobbits, because my keyboard is getting wet just thinking about it. (That sounds gross. I mean that I am crying again.)  There is so much more to say. I don't know how to say any of it. My mind is a blur of wonder and heartbreak. When the movie was over and we walked out to the courtyard at the theater, I broke down completely and sobbed into Will's chest for about ten minutes. Then we went inside and had a drink. I have never needed one so badly.  [/spoiler]

      I was watching some show like Access Hollywood (it wasn't  like  Access Hollywood, it  was  Access Hollywood - unless it was Extra) last night, and they were showing some footage of people at the  Return of the King  on opening day, including a couple getting married in full LOTR regalia. The minister "improved" on the traditional "What god has brought together, let no man tear asunder" in an adorable fashion, I thought.  Speaking of ministers, I just got off the telephone with Justin, who will be marrying Will and I. He has cleared the date and is thrilled that the wedding will be during the day, as he has tiny hobbits (er, children) who will be attending as well. Which reminds me, our wedding will be child-friendly. I know that this sometimes causes problems, but the only thing that I can think of as far as that goes that even has a  possibility  of being true is that the parents may be distracted by their babies, and frankly, parents  should  pay attention to their babies. I was thinking of maybe getting some crafty projects and setting up a table where the little ones could do stuff on their own, if they got bored.   [drastic change of subject]  I had the loveliest experience yesterday. In an odd sort of way. I had to go to the bank to transfer some money from my dad's account to ours (for the deposit on the movie theater) and to cash my paycheck. Because I stopped off at the mailbox to pick up my check, I exited the building through the front door, rather than the side door that's closest to our apartment. So I took a different route than I usually take to the bank. As I walked down Harvard, I had a stunningly vivid sense memory, though it took me a moment to place the smell. I finally realized that the patches of grass I was passing had been fertilized, and I was smelling a farm. There is something about the smell of cow dung that is just lovely. Not that I'd want a perfume of it or anything, but I don't wear perfume anyway.  I turned right on 6th Street, past the homeless guy who sits in front of the post office. I smiled at him and he smiled back. It made me wonder how many people just walk past the homeless, never even looking at them. At Hobart, I passed three or four boys who were just sitting, being hoodlums or whatever it is that boys do on street corners. They looked at me, and one of them made a funny sound that I suppose is something like whistling, and another said to his friends, "I bet she's getting a book." It was very surreal, though I  was  walking in the direction of the library. Do I look like a bookworm? Do all white girls hang out at the library? I don't know. But it was funny.  After I took care of my business at the bank I went to the grocery store, where I was horrified to discover that apparently NO ONE sells parchment paper anymore. Bastards! So I bought french fries instead.

      Seeing as my  urlLink last entry  was far more words than normal, I give you this, in the Spirit of Christmas:  Tonight, I made brownies. I also cooked fish and chips for dinner. I hope the brownies don't smell like dinner.  I was wearing my sexy new bra the whole time.  The end.

       urlLink AFAJournal.org - "Sodom's Solemn Warning"    sod·om·y n.  Any of various forms of sexual intercourse held to be unnatural or abnormal, especially anal intercourse or bestiality.  (Definition courtesy of dictionary.com)  I stumbled upon an article written by Ed Vitagliano in the American Family Association Journal, a Christian publication whose sole purpose seems to be condemning anyone who does not think the way that its contributors feel they ought to. Not very Christian if you ask me. I know a lot of good Christian people, and I must say that they are all considerably more intelligent and compassionate than this asshole.  I was raised basically atheist, and now consider myself agnostic. I have read parts of the bible, but frankly I find it dreadfully boring.  Ed says:  For “gay” and lesbian activists intent on molding American culture in their own image, the church is seen as the most stalwart opponent resisting the triumph of homosexual philosophy.  I find two things in particular about this opening sentence to be very interesting. The first is the use of quotations around the word gay, but not around the word lesbian. This can be interpreted two ways that I can think of: One, "gay" is a term meaning "homosexual," which is the (only) correct term; two, lesbians are  HOT SHIT  and therefore more legitimate than those dirty, buggering "gays." The second is the use of the word stalwart. It is used here as an adjective, and can therefore mean either "Having or marked by imposing physical strength" or "Firm and resolute; stout." Using the Pope as my point of reference, the former is obviously not what Ed referred to. If "Firm and resolute; stout" means "stubborn, obstinate, and consuming of foamy beer," then it may be an accurate description.  In interpreting what the bible has to say on homosexuality in Genesis (18 and 19), the story of Sodom and Gomorrah, he says:  In fact, the word sodomy, which generally refers to unnatural sex acts (especially homosexual anal intercourse) is derived from the name of the city of Sodom.  He is absolutely correct if you ignore his parenthetical. However, since it was published right there in the middle of his otherwise correct (if judgmental) statement, you probably should not ignore it after all. I would be terribly disappointed if my readers were to ignore my (highly amusing) parentheticals, so I will afford him the same respect that I myself would appreciate. As you can see above, my online dictionary source also singles out anal intercourse (or buggery, as I like to call it), but does not specify homosexual or heterosexual. That is because both involve the insertion of a penis into an anus, and also because the authors of dictionary.com are not disgusting homophobes.   Digression:  I have a question about the use of the word "unnatural." How can it be determined whether a sex act is natural or not (assuming consent)? Let's say it's summer time, and quite hot in our apartment, and my lover and I are in bed together, naked and performing the acts that generally lead up to intercourse. (Like, you know, smooching.) Due to the combined factors of temperature and arousal, my anus becomes slick with sweat and other moisture. When my lover attempts penetration, aiming most properly for my hoo-ha, he inadvertently finds himself an inch deep in my out-hole. What's worse, the pressure feels good and I like it! Since the course of events took place "naturally," are we committing a sin? Actually, that's two questions. Have we already committed a sin? If we continue, are we committing a sin?  Going back to the dictionary, let's talk about bestiality for a moment. Bestiality is a non-consensual act. Whether it is natural or normal becomes a moot point. What I want to know is whether animals of separate species (excluding humans) laying together is acceptable. I'm not talking about the dog and the cat sharing a sunbeam for an afternoon nap. I'm thinking more about that naughty lion taking advantage of the Little Baby Jesus-Lamb. (Or was it the other way around?)  Back to Ed.  When two angels, in the form of men, came to Sodom to stay with Lot, the men of the city surrounded the house and asked, “Where are the men which came in to thee this night? Bring them out unto us, that we may know them” (vs. 5, KJV).  Please note that Ed uses the King James bible, which many have argued is wildly reinterpreted.  With such a Biblical event casting its shadow over the theological landscape, how could “gay” advocates sidestep the obvious implication that God considered homosexuality a despicable sin?  Some simply deny that any type of sexuality – homosexual or heterosexual – is in view in the Sodom and Gomorrah saga. For example, in his book,  Homosexuality and the Western Christian Tradition , Dr. Sherwin Bailey argues that the Hebrew word translated “know” in this verse does not refer to sex at all. Instead, the request on the part of the townsmen to “know” the visitors was merely a request to become acquainted with Lot’s guests, especially since they were outsiders.  A proper exegesis of this passage reveals the ludicrous nature of this argument. Lot responded to the initial request by beseeching the men, “Please, my brothers, do not act wickedly” (vs. 7, NAS). This is hardly a comprehensible statement if all the men wanted to do was meet Lot’s guests and start up a conversation.  It's difficult to say, without having read Dr. Bailey's work, whether his is a retarded argument or not. Ed's description of it certainly makes me lean toward the more "traditional" (and anti-gay) interpretation, but I am well aware of the drastic differences between modern translations and the original Hebrew, so I am leaning back toward Dr. Bailey's side.  I had to look up exegesis, which means "Critical explanation or analysis, especially of a text." Ed does not credit his source for this "proper" exegesis, so I cannot give it any weight at all in his argument. As Rabbi Merope is on vacation, I have no source of information on the actual meaning of the Hebrew word in question, but I think it is safe for me to assume that if it does not have a sexual connotation, it may still mean a bit more than "have a conversation." There can be wicked intent without rape (or even consensual but unnatural sex) as the ultimate goal.  Furthermore, as P. Michael Ukleja argues in  Bibliotheca Sacra , with such a restricted meaning for “know,” Lot’s offer of his daughters to the men of the city (itself a disgraceful act) would be inexplicable.  Actually, there is nothing restricted about Dr. Bailey's meaning, whatever it may actually be. It is, in fact,  less  restricted than the assumption that it can only possibly mean buggery.  The more common approach for activists, however, has been to argue that the sin here in Genesis is not homosexuality per se, but homosexual rape. “Violence – forcing sexual activity upon another – is the real point of this story,” said lesbian English professor Virginia Ramey Mollenkott, co-author of the book  Is the Homosexual My Neighbor?   Why does Ed single Mollenkott out as being a lesbian? I wonder...  He goes on to argue that there is no indication that Lott's visitors would have objected to fucking the men who wanted to "know" them. This is his weakest argument yet. By absence of one item, you do not prove another item, also absent.  Later in the article Ed quote Ezekiel 16:49-50:   “Behold, this was the guilt of your sister Sodom: she and her daughters had arrogance, abundant food, and careless ease, but she did not help the poor and needy. Thus they were haughty and committed abominations before Me. Therefore I removed them when I saw it.”  He argues that the abominations referenced are obviously homosexuality. This is strangely similar to interpreting the President's Constitutional right to declare war without Congress's approval as a right that applies in non-emergencies. (I am over-simplifying because I can only really concentrate on one document at a time, and my copy of the Constitution is across the room anyway.) Why is there a need to look further than that passage for evidence of what the abominations are? I am not trying to say that the bible is A-OK with homosexuality, because that is clearly not true, at least in current interpretations. What I am saying is that he is using his own agenda to redefine something that is already defined very clearly.  Ed finally says something that backs up his argument:  In 2 Peter 2, the apostle said the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah should serve as an example to the wicked of every generation (vs. 6). Lott, he said, continually witnessed “the sensual conduct of unprincipled men,” who, among other things, “indulge the flesh in its corrupt desires” (vv. 7, 10).  But then follows it up with this piece of absurdity:  Jude 7 makes the sin of Sodom and Gomorrah even more explicit: the inhabitants “indulged in gross immorality and went after strange flesh,” and what could be stranger than men fornicating with other men?  CONTEST! Name something stranger than men getting it on with each other. Bonus points if it actually fits Jude's description of strange flesh.  I'll start you off: Cannibalism.  There's tons more where that came from (the analysis of Ed's "argument" as well as the amusing contest entry), but I still have brownies and a trip to the bank to make.

      Well, sadly, we are unable to give any gifts this year, but I am certainly feeling the holiday spirit! This morning I went to the mall (ugh) in Beverly Hills (ugh, ugh, ugh) and actually had an all right time. Perhaps my strategy of going on a Tuesday morning, which was not in fact thought out at all, was a wise one.  I went to check out a kitchen cart at Bed Bath & Beyond and to buy some jeans and stuff at The Gap, both non-surprise-type gifts from my father. I found jeans that fit and several other nice items, including another fabulous pair of sweatpants (eventually that will be the only sort of bottoms that I wear) and a few long sleeve t-shirts. When I got in line, I was at the front, but there were two women who'd queued up on the wrong side of the check-out counter. The first woman had been there before me, and the check-out girl sent her over and said she would be helped first. The other woman had her very adorable (11 or 12-year-old) daughter with her, and somewhat reluctantly asked me if it would be all right for her to take care of her return ahead of me, as she had a doctor's appointment down the street to get to. I said that she certainly could, as all I had left to do today was to buy chocolate chips, and I had all day to do so. We were called to opposite sides of the check-out, facing one another, and while we were being helped she called over to me and said she was glad we'd met, because so many people are so rude at this time of year. She said something about a song she liked that advised people to wake up and put a smile on their faces, and said that I'd reminded her to smile.  I left feeling very good about myself and about the season, and went across the way to Victoria's Secret where I (finally!) found out my bra size and purchased two. Then I bought a Chai, cried over the loss of Wizards of the Coast (where did it go?), and went to Smart & Final for some baking supplies.  And it's only just 2:30! If I can keep myself from spending all day online, I may get some baking done.

In the first two they are easier to avoid, whereas the third is pretty much one big spoiler from start to finish.  You're welcome.

        The times tables  How to write in cursive (that one didn't stick)  To always go with my first answer  Thank you, Mrs. Viglielmo. Fourth grade wasn't so bad after all.  My first instinct for a jewelry store was correct. My first instinct for a dress shop was right. My first instinct for an officiant was right. And my first instinct for a venue was right, right, RIGHT.  Yesterday evening Will and I visited the  urlLink Silent Movie Theater . We are totally in love (with each other as well as the space) and will be married there. I spoke to my father today and he will be taking care of the deposit. The price for the space seems astronomical to me, but having checked out some other venues online I know that it is actually quite a steal.  We are just waiting to hear from Justin (our minister) about his availability and talk to Charlie about the contract for the theater. If all goes well we will be setting the date by the end of the week.   I am ridiculously excited.  In other, totally unrelated news, we decorated for Christmas last night and watched  Zulu  this evening. It's been a truly fantastic weekend.

      No, this is not a political rant. I haven't got time. Well, that isn't entirely accurate. I have time, but damnit, I'm in a good mood and I do not wish to spoil it.  It's just that we were listening to that song ("All Good Soldiers" by Bad Religion) and I was thinking that it's almost definitely anti-war, anti-soldier (or at least anti-armed forces), anti-president, and anti-god, but it just makes me want to run (RUN) to the nearest recruiting center and sign up to serve my country.  Isn't that funny?

      Sorry, that was lame.   urlLink CHUD  has announced that Cillian Murphy of  28 Days Later  has been cast as a villain in the upcoming Christian Bale-starring  Batman  movie.  CHUD also  urlLink reports  that the  Firefly  movie may not be happening as soon as hoped, if at all. Since this is coming from Joss Whedon, Compulsive Liar, I don't think anything of it one way or another. CHUD is my number one source for movie info, but my pal Alan Tudyk recently told our friend Len (who is working on the  Underdogs  DVD) that things were looking good for the movie.  In conclusion, I have to go find my VHS copy of  The Replacement Killers , and also make a new Deadlands character. Poor Little Joe needs some time to recuperate.  p.s. Awwww! The Blogger spellcheck wanted to replace "Whedon" with "Wheaton." My work here is done.

      OK, so I didn't talk to Vince Vaughn.  However , Steve the Pirate (you may know him as Wash, the pilot of Serenity) congratulated me on my upcoming nuptuals and was quite giddy when Will told him how much we're looking forward to the  Firefly  DVDs. Then he started talking about Isaac Asimov and totally lost me.  Dude. Alan Tudyk!

      Therefore, I should kick lots of ass every day.  The trouble is, kicking ass is tiring, and some days I need to just go hang with Vince Vaughn, drinking martinis.  OK, I hate martinis and don't know if Vince will be in attendance, but I am going to the  Underdogs  wrap party tonight with Will. (The movie is technically going by "Untitled Dodgeball Movie," but the original name is most excellent and I refuse to call it anything else until I have to.)  The question, of course, is  what should I wear?

      I got my ASS KICKED by about 800 cookies today. The catering company I work for is catering Disney's Christmas party, and apparently this requires A FUCKLOAD OF COOKIES. It took four of us ALL DAY to decorate them all. Un-fucking-believable.  I drove Will to pick our car up from the  crime syndicate  dealership that was holding it ransom for $90 because they fixed something they didn't tell us they were going to fix (which obviously wasn't the thing that's covered by warranty, which they also fixed). I demanded to speak to the mechanic, who had left for the day, and instead got the manager, who hemmed and hawed (whatever that means) and removed the charges from our account.  On the way home, K-ROQ played  Rock Superstar.    Universe: 1 Annika: 2   I win, I win, I win.

      Dear Reader,  Thank you for continuing to read my blog, despite the inane drivel that my brain transmits to this page.  I meant to write a proper entry today, but I worked long hours and am now off to see  The Fellowship of the Ring , Extended Edition, in the Cineramadome at the ArcLight Theater. This will, without a doubt, be the second most exciting night of my year.  There is a chance that, due to the trauma of seeing Boromir die on the big (huge!) screen, I will be incapable of typing for a day or two. I hope that you understand.  Much Love to you all (except those of you I do not like).

      Will: Better than Vaughn in every way.  I might start actually liking this show. Not that I would stop making fun of it, but it's growing on me. Not enough Pudgy!Spy, though.  Happy Sunday. Wish me luck updating this week, as I will be prepping food for Disney's Christmas party.  p.s. Dear Computer,  You are a FUCKING RETARD and I hate you.

      I will continue my  Land of Milk and Honey  post, just not right now.  So, our car needs a new Timing Belt. Or, at least, something related to the Timing Belt needs to be fixed. I don't know, I'm not a mechanic. The regular mechanic that I took the car to identified the problem and called the dealership, who said that even though our warranty is expired, this is covered because it's part of the Emissions Control System. Yay! So I called the dealership and spoke to the same guy (Larry), making an appointment for today.  When Will arrived with the car this morning, he was told that the appointment was made incorrectly, and they couldn't take the car, and it was somehow My Fault. He glared at the guy a lot, and finally forced him to admit that I had made the appointment perfectly, but 5 of his mechanics were out due to the flu.  WHAT THE FUCK, MAN? Why didn't you just say so in the first place? As I understand it, he also tried to pawn off some of the responsibility on Larry, who no longer works there. Somehow, I have a feeling that this repair will NOT be covered by the warranty, and we are Royally Screwed. We'll find out Tuesday, when the Moron promises they will actually work on the car.  I cannot stand people who will lie to cover their asses, especially when it involves diverting blame to someone else, and  especially  when the truth wouldn't have made  anyone  look bad. It's a damn good thing I wasn't there, or this guy would be eating through a tube. (I speak metaphorically, of course.)

      I've been thinking lately about finances, and not just my own. (Though I admit, it's my own that led to this train of thought.)  There is practically no one in this country who lives within their means, but almost everyone thinks that they do. I could be all vague and blame it on consumerism or the media or some shite like that, but that isn't it. The root cause may be hidden in there somewhere, but that isn't the extent of it.   Note:  I will be making generalizations. I am aware that this doesn't apply to everyone.  On one side, everyone has their income. Let's make up an imaginary person who makes $30K a year. After taxes, this person (X) makes about $20-$25K a year. (I am too lazy to do the exact math.)  Then there are X's expenses. Housing is bound to cost around $800-$1000 a month, assuming that X is a city dweller. If X is lucky, this amount also covers the essential utilities (by which I mean gas and electric, and water if X owns rather than renting). A  basic  phone line runs about $20/month after taxing; most people have voice mail, which adds about $8, but maybe X was frugal and bought an answering machine. If X got a good deal on long distance service, that is another $10/month. You can't live without internet these days, and if you're going to spend $15 on dial-up, you might as well double it and have a high speed connection. X probably has a cell phone, too. That's another $30 (I'm not counting one-time fees here, on the assumption that they were already paid). X has to eat. Despite good planning, it would seem that it's impossible to spend less than $100/week on food if you cook at home, and more if you eat out. Let's assume $600 per month. Laundry must be done, at a conservative estimate of $5/week, rounded up to $25/month. That is assuming no dry cleaning, but I like to assume. Transportation is a must. Let's assume that X bought a car with a bank loan. The bank gets $250/month and the insurance company another $150. The gas station takes $20/tank, but X gets good gas mileage and only has to fill up twice a month. An oil change every three months at $30 a pop comes to $120 a year, plus the occasional new air filter or whatever - round up to $200. Maybe more, but this is a relatively new car.  I have counted the above as essentials. The internet and cell phone have good arguments against them and could be considered luxuries, but as I said, X is a city dweller and may need these items for work. Sure, X could take the bus, but what if the bus doesn't go where X needs to be?  Many people would consider anything beyond this a luxury, but then turn around and insist that they need it. Cable, $50/month. Movie rentals, $20/month (if you rent one a week or sign up with Netflix). Actually leaving the house, priceless. Hee. I mean, variable. Let's say $10/week, which doesn't allow for much of anything.  One vacation and/or trip to visit family per year is $300 for plane tickets plus expenses of another $200. It's difficult to make it through any major gift giving season without spending, not to mention birthdays throughout the year. Let's call that $500 for the year.  Unexpected emergency expenses add up quickly too. I am including booze. Easily $1000 a year, all told.  Thank goodness I have my calculator. One moment while I tally up.   ... $29,500  a year. That's nearly $10,000 more than X brings home. It's a good thing X has a credit card.  To be continued...

      First of all, today is much better than yesterday. Thanks to everyone for their kind words. We're still broke, but I am much less panicked.  So. Hell. As usual, this requires some backstory. Will's best friend in high school was Shelby. They've kept in touch over the years, and usually see each other at least once a year, on New Year's Eve. Last year Shelby wanted to visit but I had to say no, given that we were living in a studio apartment. I felt terrible about it, and invited him (well, told Will to invite him) to visit us this year, now that we have space for an extra person. A couple of weeks ago he called to say he hadn't bought his ticket yet, but would soon, and to ask if he could bring a girl he's been dating. I am less than thrilled at the thought of having an extra person here, but only due to space issues. We told him to bring her. The plan was that they'd arrive early in the week and stay until Friday or so.  Will just called to say that they are arriving on New Year's Eve at 7:00 (in the evening!) and leaving late on Sunday. I am furious. For one thing, Will has a rule: no driving after dark on Amateur Night. Once the sun sets on New Year's Eve, we don't leave the house. We like it that way. Now we will have to leave the house and go to the  airport.  Then we will have to go to the airport Sunday night, and first thing Monday Will has to go back to work. Maybe it is weird, but we always like to have a day or two to unwind after going anywhere or having guests. Now we will be thrust back into the routine of normalcy without any time to ourselves.  All I can say is, this girl had better be fantastic. If we don't get along I am kicking them out to the curb. (Not really. I am a wimp.)

      Well, yesterday just sucked. It started out fine, but around 4:00 things started going downhill swiftly, and by bedtime I was a wreck.  The first awful thing was a call from the phone company asking if perhaps we'd like to pay the bill rather than have all of our services turned off. This was  totally my fault , and I am feeling very stupid right now. What happened was that the November bill arrived with October's amount added to it as a past due amount. I was certain that I'd paid the October bill, and thought they must have crossed in the mail (which happens often - I pay my bills the day they're due most of the time), so I set the bill aside intending to check whether I'd paid in October. I promptly forgot about it. I still haven't gone through the stack of mail that arrived over the holiday week, so I never saw the late notice. If they hadn't followed up by phone, I'd have no phone or internet. Luckily, the woman who called was very nice about the whole thing, but I couldn't find the checkbook and had to pay by credit card. The card I have is on my father's account, for emergencies. Technically this qualified as one, and my father is  very  understanding about money issues, but it was awful having to call him as well as Will to tell them about my giant screw-up. And it was giant, as we get one bill for local and long distance as well as internet.  Then I checked the bank balance and discovered that my normally bad money-handling skills went down the drain last month, and we've been twenty-one-dollared to death. (The bank charges $21 for each overdraft payment.) I knew that we were pushing it by buying my ring, but I really thought I'd done the math and we were coming out even. So much for my paychecks being extra money.  So it boils down to us being into overdraft again, and right before Christmas.  The second event was far worse in the long-term, real world sense. After our friend Craig died three and a half years ago, some other friends from college put together a Topica message board so that we can all keep in touch (as most of us hadn't talked in a year until the funeral). I rarely check the board, being lousy at communication, but I'd posted there a few weeks ago to share the news of our engagement. In one reply, someone asked for news of Pasha, a boy who Will knows but I've only met once. I know that he travels a lot, and I assumed it was just a "what's Pasha up to?" question. But a reply from another friend linked to a blog maintained by his friends and parents, documenting his recovery from a car accident in August that left him brain damaged. He was rear-ended by an 18-wheeler at somewhere over 60mph and thrown from his van after it rolled several times. The impact must have been incredible, as the bruising showed that he was definitely wearing his seatbelt. His left femur and hip were damaged so badly that the surgeon said he'd never seen that kind of damage on a young person (I believe Pasha is 28). Remarkably, he is walking and communicating, though he is still having trouble with his memory (he knows that he is brain damaged by is surprised every time someone explains what happened to him) and has aphasia, which is difficulty identifying the correct word. Interestingly, he is multi-lingual and apparently finds it easier sometimes to find the word he wants in Spanish or Russian.  The good news is that he is doing well, all things considered, and  he  is definitely still in there, albeit damaged.  I'm not angry at anyone for not telling us. Pasha isn't my friend at all, and he and Will haven't seen each other in years as far as I know. But I am a bit bothered that the message board didn't have a post about this, as it was starting for the purpose of not having one of us die and the others not know about it (or not have spoken to the person in ages). I don't even think Pasha was a member of the board, but it still seems like the sort of news that would be shared.  Needless to say, Will was quite distressed. He dealt with it by going to bed, and I stayed up to read the archived messages about his recovery. I literally couldn't do anything else. When I finally turned off the computer and went downstairs, I checked on Will just as he was having a nightmare. He used to have driving nightmares constantly - losing control of the car, the brakes not working, going over a cliff, etc. - and hasn't had one in ages until last night. I got in bed immediately, forgetting all about brushing my teeth or changing my shirt, and held him until we both fell asleep.

      This is simply unacceptable. Where has the time gone? I have nothing to show for it.  Weellll...  that isn't strictly true. But there was very little in the way of personal accomplishment for me in 2003. I am no closer to having any sense of organization in my life, I haven't written anything (except for those 2500 words before I pooped out on NaNoWriMo), we've been in this apartment for nearly a year and it's still not the way I want it, and I am not wealthy, famous, or a member of Mensa. (Only one of those last three is an actual goal, so that's a relief. I'm 0 for 1, not 0 for 3.)  On the other hand, I am the happiest I've ever been. That's got to count for more than reaching 'life goals', doesn't it? Yes, I thought so.  I haven't updated all week due to being in Pittsburgh. Remarkably, we were there for 4 full days and didn't go anywhere near Primanti's. It's a good thing I can make a good  Primanti  Barranti Bros. sandwich myself. Which reminds me, must purchase cheese.  So we arrived on Tuesday evening and went straight to Will's parents' place, where we were fed a lovely chili and the largest steaks I have ever seen. Mary and Stephen gave me a bracelet that's been passed down from Stephen's grandmother Stella to his mother Lilly to Mary and now to me. I was very touched, and it's quite lovely and not like anything else I have. We had a drink and cozied up to the fireplace before going to bed in Will's old attic room. The bed up there is actually ours, but didn't come with us to California. It is the most comfortable bed in the universe, and I want it back.  Will's sister Sara and her boyfriend Jason arrived at about 7:30 Wednesday morning after driving from Maryland at the end of her shift (they're both police officers). We all went for a late breakfast at my favorite Pittsburgh diner, Tom's. (Incidentally, it is  actually  called Tom's Diner. Tom's  Restaurant  is at 101st and Broadway [unless it's Columbus] in New York City, and is the one that Suzanne Vega wrote the song about.) Later that afternoon we drove to a coffee shop to meet Darren. Will asked him to be our best man, and he (Darren) nearly cried. Then we went to Gooski's, the greatest bar on earth, and had a few before heading back to the house for a huge Italian dinner. It was fantastic, though I'm sure I make better sauce. Of course, I think I make better sauce than  everyone , so that isn't saying anything.  Thursday was Thanksgiving. Historically speaking, this is an appalling holiday. Traditionally speaking, however, it is one of the best. A time to gather with family and friends, eat until you burst, and truly live the things that you are grateful for. Jason's parents came, as did my father and sister. My stepmother didn't make it, because one of the kitties was ill.   The food was fantastic, as was the company. Much ado was made over our engagement, and I was only a  little  bit upset at the fact that it's taken 6 years and a diamond to be treated like a member of the family, whereas Jason was instantly accepted and is clearly totally adored by everyone.  Everyone got on fantastically. My sister won the whole family over (damn theater people) and my dad and Stephen talked for hours about their experiences in classical music over the last 25 years (and certainly about many other subjects, but I was full and tuned them out). Jason's parents, Jack and Kathy, were wonderful. I was terribly sad for the three of them, Kathy in particular - they lost their younger son last spring, and she was having a very rough time of it. At the same time, though, she was an absolute hoot - invited herself to the wedding, in a non-annoying way, told stories about Jack's years as a police officer, and was just generally a lovely person. Jack was...well, I could dedicate an entire entry to him and not do justice to the man, so let's just say he was a riot.  Friday started out very weird. We slept in, as neither of us was feeling well, and when we came downstairs for coffee we were bombarded with  plans  for the day. Keep in mind please that my entire extended family with very few exceptions live in the Pittsburgh area, and we had made it perfectly clear that we were going to, at the very least, visit with my grandmother. Everyone was aware of this, but as soon as we were awake we were told that we were going to the Strip, to the Theater (where Will's dad used to work), to Cannonsburgh for antiquing, to someplace called Bob's Garage, and to some jazz club. We were very stubborn and insisted that they leave us be for the day. I'm certain we offended someone, and frankly I don't care. My grandma is  eighty-three , for crying out loud.  We had also made plans with Will's friend Ron, who he worked with when we lived in Pittsburgh 5 years ago, for that evening, which we switched to dinner plans to accommodate the Crazies (or In-Laws - take your pick).  So we drove to Best Buy, where we bought more memory for the camera, and then went to my aunt Chrissy's, where we saw my cousin Erin (who is also getting married next year), my uncle Tony and aunt Mary, my grandma, great-aunt Dot, and my cousin Mike. After a nice, relaxed visit we stole Mike and went to Mad Mex, where we had a few drinks and met Ron and his friend Ralph. We had a great time, and I want Mike to come live in LA. Are you reading this, Mike? The spare bed is waiting. I'll even wash the sheets. After dinner we had to go back, for fear of upsetting the family further.  At this point I should interject a little backstory. For the last two months, since we agreed to spend the holiday there, Will's mom has been telling us,  every  time we talk, that Sara and Jason are really looking forward to going out on the town with us. They want us, according to her, to take them to Gooski's and to hang out as couples. Wednesday and Thursday nights Sara and Jason spent in the basement, watching movies, and Friday morning, after we were so very stubborn about seeing my family, Mary actually pulled Will aside to make him promise to see Sara that night.  So we get back to the house, which is empty, and Will calls his dad's cell phone. He's told that they're just leaving Bob's Garage and will be home in a few. I was feeling positively wretched at this point, and put on my PJs and settled down in front of the fire with a Hot Toddy. I made it perfectly clear that Will was welcome to go out, but I wasn't moving. Sara and Jason arrived after a few minutes, with no sign of the "grown-ups." After a few minutes of awkward beating around the bush, we realize that  none  of us have  any  interest in going anywhere. Jason ran upstairs to change into sweats, and we all sat by the fire and had a few drinks. (I should probably point out that Stephen had bought about six cases of beer and innumerable amounts of wine and liquor. Jason had apparently spent all day trying to convince the parents that it would be wasteful to go out to a bar when we had one at home.)  It came out at this point that Mary has been telling Sara for two months that Will really really really wants to take her and Jason to Gooski's and hang out as couples. When Will called, they weren't about to leave  at all , but were hustled out and deposited at the door of the house. They were actually followed here, despite having their own car, to make sure they'd be with us. We laughed about it for a bit and after a while all of the parents came home and we had a few more drinks and went to bed. It's funny - I can't decide whether to be amused or livid that this woman is convinced that her 28-year-old son and 25-year-old daughter, both successful in their fields and established as adults, cannot simply talk to one another. I guess I'd better be amused, since I'm marrying into this family.  We left on Saturday. The airport was shockingly empty, considering that it was a holiday weekend, and we were very early for our flight, so we went to O'Brien's pub for lunch. It was fantastic! I can't believe that there is such great airport food! The trip itself was fairly uneventful.  Yesterday our beloved Cassie took us out for sushi, which was so good that I am still recovering. We also watched Mucha Lucha, King of the Hill, and Alias. Oh, and The Practice, which was surprisingly good. I never liked it before. But maybe I just like James Spader.  Today I am trying to decide what to do first, so naturally I haven't done anything. I need to do the laundry, clean the kitchen, dust, upload the photos (after finding the camera), eat, buy milk, and test the old computer to see if it still works. Oh, and back up all of my files and upgrade to XP. Clearly I will not be doing all of this today...or in fact any of it, if I keep going at my current pace. Well, chances are I'll eat either way.

      So, on a whim (as I was already on the search page) I did a Yahoo image search for my first name. I have yet to see a picture of myself (er, now, not  ever ), which is sad.  What is distressing, though, is that I keep nearly convincing myself that the pictures  are  of me. They have my name! Therefore, they must be me. I keep having to give myself little "talks."   No, darling. Your hair is not blonde.    Sweetie, you aren't Dutch.    Good grief! She's a  athlete , for crying out loud.  (Incidentally, a  lot  of the Bizzaro-Me Clones were athletes.)    You're twenty-five, honey-pie. That Annika is closer to mommy's age. Yes, she's pretty. Yes, of course you're prettier. You're the prettiest.    Let's not be silly.    Oh, get a grip.   You know, I'm on page 32 now. Aren't there  any  pictures of  me -me?

      I got myself so worked up about a  Speed -style explosion that I am almost disappointed that it didn't happen.  What is worse, of course, is waiting another year to see season 3, which I am fairly certain is airing now. It is almost enough to make me want to sign up for cable and cancel it as soon as  The Shield  is over for the season. But I know me, and I don't know if I'd be able to give it up once I have it. And we do  not  need cable.  In other news, I am eating a pop tart. This is very unlike me. But  damn , it is  good.  Almost as good as Rancid.

      I just got off the phone with a gentleman (whose age I'd approximate at 18) conducting a survey about cigarettes. He asked me what brand I smoked and I told him Phillip Morris. When he repeated it several times and there was a long pause, I realized my mistake and said Marlboro. We laughed and laughed. I must admit that I am surprised that the computer system didn't include company names, only brand names. If it had been a drivers survey, and I'd said I drove a Mazda, there wouldn't have been a problem. I wouldn't have had to say "Protege." Right?  I also did my good deed for the day in telling him that the male smoker in the household would not be interested in participating in a survey. I am expecting thank you kisses and maybe a neck rub.

      Will and I are finally watching season 2 of  The Shield.  Not having cable means that in order to watch each season, we have to wait until just before the next one begins airing, and buy the DVD. This is not a problem, because so far both seasons have become available on DVD right around Will's birthday, and also because we love this show like crack, and  have to have it.  Seeing it for the first time in this format has serious advantages, like not having to wait for the next episode. It also has its downside, in that once you start watching, it is very difficult to stop, and you go to bed late and wake up with a killer fucking headache.  Sometime after midnight last night we finished watching episode 2.5 (for which I would provide the title if I weren't mostly braindead right now). I won't tag this, because I think we're the only fans of the show who haven't seen further than this already, but I'll be vague just in case.  The last scene is of Vic, Shane and Lem going into a house that turns out to be empty. Their extremely dangerous enemy knew they were coming, and tells them (over the phone), once they are in the house, that he's greenlit them. The episode ends with Vic apprehensively, or nervously, or something (man, he is hard to read!) looking around the empty room that they are in. A boombox is playing. The end.  If you've seen  Speed , you know what happens to Keanu's partner when he raids an empty house where he thought the extremely dangerous enemy was holed up. KA-BLAM! Bye-bye, Jeff Daniels. Now I know that 1)  The Shield  can't kill its main characters and 2) they are more original than that anyway, but DAMN IT, I am nervous as HELL, and can't watch the next episode until Will gets home in seven hours.  The suspense is  killing  me.  Note: Anyone who posts spoilers for any episodes after 2.5 in the comments WILL BE GREENLIT.  p.s. Love you guys. Especially Matt, whose comments don't show up in IE because I never changed the ReBlogger code when Heath told me to. For your kind words, I will refrain from sending HOT CHICKEN SOUP for you to soak your nads in.   Edited for humor and vagueness.

      I feel sick. Physically ill.  I went downstairs to check the mail. Outside the front door I heard raised voices. I looked, and it was a man, yelling at his child. (I think it was a boy.) He was generally berating him, for I don't know what, and called him stupid at least once. He yelled and yelledas he unloaded some luggage from his van (I believe it was an electric company van, but not a major one - probably a small repair company, and therefore his van). He said "fuck" a lot. I stood there, uncertain of whether to interfere. I wanted to tell him that if he tells a child he is stupid, he will believe it. I knew that if I said that, the man would tell me that his son WAS stupid.   I went upstairs and looked out the window that overlooks the front door. He was still yelling. Another man walked by, not blinking. Maybe he was hurting inside like me. I hope so, because if not then he was dead inside.  The man continued to yell at the boy and I walked to my apartment, trying not to cry. I don't know if I was - am - upset for the boy or for myself. If he had struck the child I wouldn't have hesitated to speak my mind. I would have had no hesitation in threatening him with the police, child protective service...anything. But what he was doing is WORSE, barring true (physical) child abuse. And I did NOTHING. I was afraid of him. Maybe because he was another race, but probably because he was so MEAN. And yet, I know that the child is worse off than me. I was able to just walk away to my home. I may never see that man again.  PLEASE don't tell me that it was all right not to speak to him. Barring physical danger, which I doubt I would have been in, it was NOT OKAY. I should have done  something , even if it was just writing down his license plate, or making sure that he saw me watching him.

      The other day will had lunch with some Agent. I am capitalizing that because I forget his name, and wouldn't print it if I remembered. They were talking about horror movies (I think/presume) and Agent asked Will if he'd been to ComicCon. Will said no, he'd never really been interested in being surrounded by People Like Him, but that we'd probably go this year because I wanted to. Agent was terribly impressed, and later suggested that the three of us go out for drinks sometime.  HA! I fooled him without even being there! People tend to assume that I am a geek, because I can hold up my end of a geeky conversation, but really? I just like being around geeks. I've read, like, four comic books ever (I don't mean individual comics - some of them were series of which I read more than one book). I pretty much only watch obscure movies that Will wants to watch, and sometimes (usually) I let him watch them without me. Until my recent history obsession (or re-obsession, I should say), I only read fiction and none of it was the science variety. I can't do anything with a computer. No, really! Not ANYTHING. It's a miracle I can type.  I am such a fake. It's brilliant.

I fell asleep BOTH times I tried to watch it, because it was so. Fucking. Boring. I doubt I will ever try again. **I can't honestly remember if I've seen this one, but I've seen about three Marx Brothers movies, and if you've seen three, you've seen them all.  I think that I ought to be allowed to count the movies I've got sitting by the television but haven't  actually  watched yet. However, because I am honest to a fault, I did not do so.  And finally, there is a chance that I have seen a few that I didn't mark. I blame my inability to read any language other than English, as well as my crappy memory.

      Well, there might be a few "books" that I should still read. (They still make books, don't they?) For example, I'm sure my collection is missing a  Calvin & Hobbes  or two. Also, I started reading  20,000 Leagues Under The Sea  when I was 13 and still haven't finished. Then again, I don't believe anyone has ever finished that book.  (You know what would be  great ? They should  stop making books , so that I can catch up.)  In other news, I watched some crap TV this morning, and I think half of my brain died. This is unfortunate.  I am supposed to roast a chicken this afternoon. That should be fun. ((Damn this text-based communications medium. Imagine that I said that very dryly, as though I were being sarcastic, but with a twinkle in my eye to let you know that I was, in fact, completely serious. I love roasting chickens, I just hate  doing  things.)  You may have noticed (probably to your relief) that I haven't mentioned much wedding-related stuff lately. This is because Will and I have been total slackers, and haven't done any preparation in weeks. We've agreed to sit down tonight and make a list of everything that needs to be done, as well as a preliminary schedule for doing it. That should be fun. (This time the sarcasm is a little bit more genuine. It isn't that I don't want to plan the wedding, it's that I worry that I will get myself worked up over it and become Evil.)  In movie news, the Golden Globes were handed out on Sunday and today the Academy Award and Rasberry Award nominees were announced. Incidentally, today is also the New Hampshire Primary election. Guess which of the three got the most news coverage in Los Angeles this morning. No, go on - guess. I am mildly disappointed on the Oscar front that  Return of the King  wasn't nominated for any acting awards, though frankly they'd have had to fill up the entire Supporting Actor category. (Only Miranda Otto qualifies for Supporting Actress in my book. This is not a dig at Liv Tyler, who was wonderful; she merely didn't have enough to do to compete with Miranda.)  And speaking of Liv Tyler, here is your Annika quote of the day (technically from last night): "Don't cry, Liv! When you cry, I cry...and this movie is SHIT!"

      I am having a hissy-fit. The hissy-fit itself is unrelated to my HTML woes (it's over the fact that my sister won't give me her stuff), but I'm pretty upset about my lack of skills in the coding department.  Also, I just finished several loads of laundry, and they are totally refusing to put themselves away.  PLUS, I'm out of light bulbs. The lamp by my computer keeps having... issues ...and I've broken something like three light bulbs in the last two months.  But anyway. I made several attempts at writing the new code for my blog template, and I couldn't get it anywhere close to right. Chances are it would go better if I started from scratch, but I am just not that good. I know that what I want to do is fairly simple, but I can't seem to get my head around it.  And the worst part? Internet Explorer has decided not to let me view source this week.

      Today, Will and I were planning to go have a good cry-fest at the ArcLight. By this I mean, of course, that we were going to (finally) go see  Return of the King  again.  We woke up and had coffee and did the usual morning stuff (looked up strategies for  Vice City , took showers, read Calvin & Hobbes), and then discussed The Plan.  We have decided to first head to Best Buy, because Will has a  $250  gift card from his boss for his birthday. After that, we will decide between the 4:00 showing of ROTK and going home. If we choose to go home, we still have the option of the 8:30 movie (which is likely to have fewer children in the audience) or staying home, watching SpyBaby, and going to the movies one night this week.  I like flexible planning.

      In order to own the DVD (Digitally Restored!) of  Anne of Green Gables , I would have to fork over $40. I'm sure that does not include shipping.  Now, I love this movie like I love butter, and would gladly pay just about any amount if I had it. But honestly - it is only one of the movies, and to get the whole series I would only have to pay $100-200 on pledge day... if  I could catch them on a pledge day when they were featuring  Anne.  And while I  suspect  that money paid to ShopPBS goes toward the support of PBS series, I don't  know .  Also, I am very disappointed in the complete lack of available items featuring Mister Rogers. I  knew  I should have contributed last weekend when they were giving away the documentary. It's no  Mister Rogers' Opera , but nothing really is.  Maybe I ought to continue to limit my purchases to the Frontline series.   Now is the time on Soundtrack when we dance.

       urlLink Dropkick Murphys lyrics - The Dirty Glass song text   I swear to god, Dropkick Murphys has undergone more genre changes than any band ever.  My friend Tim (who might spell his name Tem) came over tonight. We've been friends since I was 14, though we lost touch for a while. Now he's married and has babies and stuff and his job brings him to LA a few times a year.  We had a splendid time, but that isn't why I am writing. I dropped him off a little while ago, and on the way home I switched to the radio. I heard the  Best Song Ever , something like the Pogues. I became as obsessed as one can become with a song that ends as you pull into your garage, when your DSL connection and google searching skills are only three floors away.  To my surprise, it was Dropkick Murphys. I have yet to recognise a song of theirs, because every single one I've ever heard sounds like a different band. (And I've been hearing their songs for  years. )  I think I am going to have to buy the album that this song is on. It is just  that  good. And I never buy music anymore.

      Not so much in the sense of making the dirt go away - more a matter of making the  stuff  go away.  I went through the closet and pulled out everything that I am never going to wear again. This is problematic for me, because I used to read  Sassy  religiously and I still remember an article with Chloe Sevigny, back before she started sucking cock in movies, who said that she never threw any clothing away because it gave her more to work with for those funky, funk outfits she was always wearing. I think I've come to my senses, though, and realized that I am never going to wear funky, funky outfits like hers. In fact, it will be a miracle if I ever wear anything but sweatpants.  During this process I realized something vital: I am so  over  velvet. Most of the stuff I'm getting rid of is near-identical velvet items that have been worn once, if that. I am also, sadly, getting rid of my favorite dress (which I wore on the second day of college), because my boobs will never again fit into it. I just don't know when they got so big. (OK, I know exactly when, but that is beside the point.)  In conclusion, you guys are just not keeping up with the commenting as quickly as I'd like. So I'm going to do a brief roll call - if you're reading this, please leave a comment.

      Much as I may try to repress it, I know that I went through a poetry phase at about age 15. Well, it seems that I also went through one at 18. I just found a notebook full of angsty love poems written in the Gateway Diner. What is really hilarious about this is not how bad the poems are (wretched), but the fact that I have  no idea  who they're about. None! I think that is so fucking funny.

      That is to say, Happy  Year  of the Monkey.  I have until February 17th to re-register as a Democrat (or not), so keep those opinions coming in. I am seriously not going to make this decision myself, so  for once ,  your vote counts.   I don't understand why last night's  Angel  disappointed so many people. I admit that the writing was not top-notch (as I understand it, the writer was a former stunt guy), and that ME has the  potential  to take the latest developments down the Path of Sucky Plot Lines (aka The Left-Hand Path&#153;), but I really, really enjoyed the episode. And I am always right.  Anyway, Will and I got a shout-out. Don't ask what it was, I already forget. I really ought to tape the damn show, but we only recently started getting decent reception. I think the PlayStation2 is to blame.  I think we are finally picking up our Deadlands game on Saturday. This should be interesting. I created my character with the intention of having Will kill him off. I didn't care a fig for the boy. However, due to some strange twist of fate, I played him ridiculously well and everyone (myself included) has fallen madly in love with him. I managed to retain mad gamer credit by not spending points to negate the damage done last game session when he was  shot in the stomach with a Buffalo gun  (I spent one chip to ensure that he would not die on his horse, because he is loyal to the trail boss), which is fine and he might live, but now I have to create another character. Boo. I think I'll go through one of our several old west books and just steal somebody.  Apropos (of nothing)*, I am really procrastinating on that template change. I know what I want it to look like, but I haven't looked up  any  of the html, because I suck. What's really sad is the fact that the changes ought to be pretty simple. The most complicated part (as far as I can tell) will be deciding whether to make a graphic for the title or just leave it as-is. (Except, y'know, I might change it again. I've got a theme going.)  Last night Will and I had a discussion about finances and housework. I have a list of Things We Need To Do, which Will is already breezing through. Guess how much I've done. Go on, guess. I  SUCK .   *According to my dictionary, it is correct to use the word "apropos" by itself here; however, "apropos of nothing" sounds neat-o. Are both correct? Just one? Neither?

      Well, it wouldn't so much be a  change , more like a  brand new thing . I've been registered undeclared forever, but the Democratic primaries are coming up (March 2nd in California). I don't consider myself a Democrat, but I am certainly leaning about as far left of the Bush Administration as is possible without falling over. On the one hand, I almost feel that "Anyone but Bush" would be an improvement. On the other hand, I feel that I ought to go ahead and vote in the Primary, since I've been looking into the candidates and all. On yet another hand, I don't want to get mail from the Dems, which would most likely happen on a regular basis if I affiliated myself with them.  I don't feel like making a decision. Tell me what to do!

Well, whenever we get through the 120 DVDs that are already on our queue. Which will happen whenever we watch the three that have been sitting on our television stand since 1983.  Now I'm depressed again.  In other news, I get a letter today from the Christian Science Monitor, offering me 45 free issues. I would kill myself before I would read 45 issues of any publication by those fucking hypocrites. (Yes, I have issues.)  In other, shocking news, today God saw fit to show Matty some of the love.  Oh, and the President gave some speech. I watched most of it, and now I am repressing.

       urlLink Valentine's Day 2004   This is what, according to MSN, women want for Valentine's Day. The list includes roses and candy (predictable), 'heart' jewelry (also predictable), underwear, some Burberry perfume thingy, and a COACH leather handbag.  OK, I wouldn't mind the handbag.  This Valentine's Day weekend will also be Will and my sixth anniversary, and the last time that we can celebrate that particular anniversary (apparently you can't have two, and we'll probably go with the 'norm' and celebrate our wedding anniversary, even though at our one-year anniversary we'll have been together eight). We're planning to go eat sushi. I don't expect a gift. Is there something wrong with me?

      I am so fucking sore. Since my last entry, I have taken two  very hot  baths full of epsom salts and nice-smelling bubble bath, and several hundred (let's be honest here - thousand) milligrams of ibuprofin. I have a heating pad on my back and am moving as little as possible (with the exception of stretching my legs as often as I can stand it).  I just don't know how the cowboys survived without these modern(ish) comforts. John has suggested whiskey, which seems quite plausible.

      As predicted, I will not be recaplet-ing  Alias  as I did last week. This substitution will have to do.  [spoilers for tonight's episode]   W: Is it worth pointing out that passenger jets can't outmaneuver heat-seeking missiles? A: Honey, I pointed out so many mistakes and inconsistancies in the last two minutes that it's practically irrelevant.  W: So, do you think it's really Lauren, or is it one of those thingies like Francie? A: I dunno. W: You mean you don't care? A: Yup.  A: Sydney's in trouble, so he  instant messages his ex-wife ? W: Yeah, 'cause that's not interceptable. A&W: [rolleyes]  W: Not Uncle Arvin!!  A: How did we live without  Alias  to make fun of before? W: We've always made fun of shows. A: Not like  Alias.  W: I think it's because we didn't love it before. Like, with  Buffy , we were bitterly funny when we started making fun of it, but we were  bitter.   A: That's not a very good dressing if it's  still bleeding.  W: Sydney didn't go to the Sarah Connor school of field dressings.  A: Poor Vaughn doesn't have any sunglasses.  A: What just happened? W: Either he has ceremonial chopsticks or he eats his food with knitting needles.  A: Sark is a dirty, dirty liar. W: I like him.  A: Zurich's pretty. How did he get there so fast? W: What I want to know is why a North Korean officer would have a western-made firearm. They get their weapons from China, and that was a Baretta. A: Maybe he bought the Baretta on the same Black Market that sold the plane that got Jack to Zurich so fast. W: And the one that dodged the heat-seeking missiles.  (Sex, Lies and Videotape joke on ad for  The Practice ) A: That commercial made my brain sad.  A: Ahh, the obligatory "shove the prisoner." You know, they usually don't do that unless you refuse to walk in the direction they want you to walk. ...I mean, in my limited experience being held prisoner by the North Korean government.  A: I just love a man who says "Thank you" after you punch him in the nose. W: I could be that man for you!  W: That was...weird. A: Gay. The word you're looking for is gay.  W: Meanwhile, Griffin Dunne looks shocked to be in an actual Hollywood agency.  W: I have to say, Isabella Rossalini kissing him got one of the least wooden performances out of Victor Garber ever. A: You mean there was no wood? W: I'm just saying, even though she's old enough to be my mother...that was really good, honey...that is one hot woman.   [/spoiler] I hope you enjoyed that, even if you didn't understand any of it.  In conclusion,  we want more Pudgy Spy!

      We waited for six hours and didn't get an encore. (That sentence sums up the story and gives away the sad, sad ending. I want my readers to be prepared for the ultimate sadness.)  On Thursday night I was on the computer and Will was downstairs, doing something else (presumably playing Vice City). I started shrieking and probably scared Will half to death. The reason for my excitement and temporary inability to speak was that I had checked  urlLink Jesse Dayton's website  for tour dates, hoping to see if he'd be back in LA soon, and found a Road Kings show listed in Anaheim for Saturday night. The Road Kings are his rock 'n' roll band, who have not played together (except possibly in Texas) for a few years. They are the way that we discovered his music, and put on the best live show ever.  Now, you all probably know that Will and I don't leave the house much if we don't have to. But at 7:00 last night we were in the car, headed to Anaheim. The website said that the doors opened at 7:00 and there were several bands, but it did not say when the music began or what order the bands would be in, so I was rather tense when we encountered heavy traffic on the 5. It took us nearly an hour and a half to drive the 27 miles, which is sadly quite normal around here. We paid our $10 each and went inside the aptly-named "Doll Hut." It might as well be called the Doll  Shack , but I loved it. They pretty much only served beer, so I didn't drink much, but that's OK. They allowed smoking inside despite state law prohibiting it, which was very weird and uncomfortable at first. Then it was just happy-making.  Anyway, the music hadn't yet started when we arrived, and in fact did not start until about 9:30. The first band, Skeeter Truck, was great. They played for about half an hour, and then there was a wait of about another half hour for the second band, whose name I didn't catch. I am referring to them as The British Invasion, because the lead singer was British and they annoyed me by playing for an hour and a half. Don't get me wrong - they were very good. But there is only so much psychobilly that one can take, especially when crammed into a teensy space. The third performer was called Lee Rocker, or Johnny Rocker, or something. He was also excellent, and did a lot of Hank Williams covers and the like. He finished playing just before one in the morning.  The Road Kings finally took the stage at about 1:15, and they were FUCKING AWESOME. They played the one song that I'd decided I couldn't live without hearing, and a few others that I like almost as much as "Gunslinger." The stage was too teensy for Jason to do most of his tricks with his double bass (he does wheelies and stands on it and stuff), but he was still rocking out.   At five of two they left the stage. Everyone yelled and clapped and called for an encore. And we waited. And waited. And then the "DJ" music came on and some guys who I didn't care about it started setting up on stage for an "All-Star Jam." I "booed" very loudly and we left.  Of course the 40 or so minutes that we got were just terrific, but I am so disappointed at the same time.  And that was my sad story.  I was going to tell another story, but it is almost time for  Alias . I am going to try to pay enough attention to be able to comply with P@'s request for a recaplet every week, but I am not sure it will happen. In addition to being out until 2:30 this morning and sleeping fitfully (due to a sore back, neck, and hip), we went horseback riding today. It was excellent, but I am SO stiff right now, and feel as though I could sleep for a week. I guess that will have to do for a second story: I rode on a horsie. It was nice.

      Turns out that the whole saying is “Something old, something new, something borrowed, something blue, with a sixpence in your shoe."  I found this out at the  urlLink most evil site on the entire internet , which for some reason I am still using. The "sixpence in your shoe" part was a link, which I followed, thinking perhaps it would explain the traditions (I know I've seen explanations before, I just can't remember where the sixpence thing comes from).  That was not to be. Oh, no. It was a page where I could  buy  a Lucky Sixpence. The price? $10.35 for ONE. I'm sorry, but isn't a sixpence worth, like, six pennies, British? Which is what - ten cents?  So tell me, dear British readers: do they still issue sixpence? Because if they do, I am willing to bet that it would cost a lot less than $10.95 to mail one to me.  Of course, there is also the issue of walking around with a freakin' coin in my shoe. But it sounds so romantic that I am willing to try.

"ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. - Legend has it that Billy the Kid was gunned down by a sheriff in 1881. But was he?   Homer Overton will tell you that the dead man was an unwitting impostor, a drunk shot point-blank in the face by two unlikely chums — the lawman and the legendary gunfighter himself.  Overton learned this some 63 years ago, at age 9, from the widow of the sheriff, Pat Garrett."  The reason for this article is pretty damn fascinating. Click the link!  Suddenly I feel the urge to watch  Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid  again.

       urlLink Hidalgo   The above link will take you to the trailer for  Hidalgo , a new movie starring Viggo Mortenson. It is, unfortunately, "based on a true story," but if we overlook that, it looks like a good bit of entertainment.  Now, anyone who has seen the extended version of  The Two Towers  knows that Aragorn's one true love is in fact not Arwen at all, but Brego the horse. After watching this trailer, I am beginning to suspect that this particular foible of Aragorn's was not from the book at all but a characteristic brought in by the actor.  Watch the trailer. You'll see. Viggo + Horsie 4EVA. I'm off to do a google search for NAMHLA.

      The entire cast of  Firefly  (with the possible exception of Jewel Stait) are GIANTS.   At the party last night following the premiere of  Along Came Polly , Will and I noticed Summer Glau (River on  Firefly ). She towers over me at approximately 6'8 (+/- 1') and is drop-dead gorgeous. She did, however, look terribly uncomfortable until her date brought her a glass of wine. I'm sure the discomfort had nothing to do with me staring at her while shoveling free food down my throat. Nothing at all.  The other big news of the evening is that we got to walk down the red carpet. If you see any photos of Alec Baldwin from last night, look closely - we were behind him for a minute or two. I was shocked - SHOCKED! - to see that his hair is considerably less greasy than I had been led to believe.  OH! And we were in the elevator with Stephen Root. Will didn't notice, but I was all giggly. "Detention! Detention, detention, detention." And people say the  Buffy  movie sucked.  The movie (I'm back to  Polly  now) itself was fun. Nothing spectacular or ground-breaking, but certainly more original than most of the crap that gets foisted off on us regularly in the "romantic-comedy" category.  The party was saved from being totally lame (there were eight billion people there) by a fantastic salsa band. Even Will wanted to dance. We  didn't , but that's beside the point. We left early and went home, where we came up with a genius pitch for a horror movie based on the Ladies' bathroom at the Chinese. I can't say anything further - you're all criminals and will steal my brilliant idea.

      I guess I'll have to do it myself.  [spoiler for tonight's Alias]  Sydney gets kidnapped by...Kendall, who unfortunately isn't evil. He does, however, know where she was. He didn't tell her because she asked him not to.  In your face, Big Lips!  The covenant never brainwashed Syd, because when she was a kid Daddy!Spy used something called Project Christmas ( *puke* ) to brainwash her against brainwashing (yes, my head hurts too), so she faked it. She worked with Lazarama to find the  zzzzzzzzzz ...Oh, sorry, the Rimbaldi Box, but the hiding place (five hundred years old, with modern key-locks) was booby-trapped and the producers of Alias missed out on a great opportunity for a Lara Croft outfit. Seriously, half the episode was in flashback, and one ONE wig? Lame. Where was I? Right, Syd chopped off LazaNobodyLovesRaymond's hand to save his life, and they escaped with the Box, which she was supposed to deliver to Kendall. Instead, she sent him a CD of Elton John's Greatest Hits, and a videotaped message explaining that the Covenent always steals everything so she is hiding the box and having her memories removed and don't tell her anything. Syd and Kendall figure out that, because she is The Chosen One (note to producers of Alias: Was Sarah Michelle Gellar not available?), the Covenant plans to mix HER EGGS (Syd figures out what her scar is from months after the rest of us, and somehow manages to look shocked) with RIMBALDI's DNA! They're going to create a MUTANT GENETIC BABY! At the Oops Center, the team gears up for what should clearly be a SEAL mission. Dixon tells Syd that he knew everything too, and was under order not to tell her. Then he tells her he loves her, and everything is OK, because Tiny Syd cannot handle more than one emotion at a time. The team parachutes out of a plane somewhere over South Park, Colorado, or wherever it is that they make the MUTANT GENETIC BABIES, and they proceed to kill everyone but Sark. Dixon tells Syd that they are supposed to bring back all of the DNA as evidence, then turns his back so that she can torch the place. They find Lazaray (I don't know how the normal recapper comes up with all those names for him), Not Dead. Sark, speeding away in his car, calls someone and tells them that "They've got [my] father; take care of it." In the ambulance, Lazaray tries to tell Sydney something Very Important, but he doesn't make any sense. As they are wheeling him into the hospital, a sniper kills him dead, dead, dead. And the sniper is...Lauren. A hundred thousand Vaughn/Sydney shippers sigh in relief, "I  knew  she was evil." The end.  [end spoiler]

      This weekend in the Culinary Adventures of Annika and Will:   Meal #1   Roast pork loin with Barbeque sauce  Baked beans  Vegetable casserole  Corn bread   Meal #2   Fried chicken  Chicken soup with dumplings  Apple pie  The first meal was shared with our friend Ted, who is never in town long enough. The second one was just for Will (except for the pie), for his birthday. I had to massacre a whole chicken (it is indeed possible to hold a massacre with only one victim, already dead, if it is me holding the knife).  We pigged out on leftovers for the other mealtimes.

      Right, so I'm doing this whole "no sugar at night" thing, and I'm eating banana bread with molasses.  I figure the sugar in the banana bread baked off, like alcohol does, and the molasses doesn't count because...um, because. Besides, I only stopped eating sugar because it made me crave bread and salt, and I was already eating bread.  Incidentally, mere days after I made this decision, Val on  What I Like About You  tried to give up sugar. I told you!  They're listening to me...

       urlLink CHUD - Cinematic Happenings Under Development : "'IT'S DIE HARD IN A WHEELCHAIR'"   *Yawn*   I am so bored of studio execs following me around. Seriously - every time I have a hilarious or clever idea for a movie, it is announced within weeks.  OK, so I didn't exactly come up with "Die Hard In A Wheelchair," but neither did Fox. That was Nick Nunziata's spin on the franchise. I did, however, spend about an hour last week recommending  Die Hard  spin-offs to Will. I think my best was  Die Hard In A Grocery Store.  OK, so I'm pretty sure that was the only one I came up with, but I spend about an hour pitching it. (By "pitching it," I mean laughing hysterically at myself and asking Will, "Aren't I funny?")

      How the hell did that happen? Last time I checked it was Tuesday - does that mean that I missed yesterday? I couldn't have! I blogged!  Where is my mind?  On Monday, it is Will's birthday. In addition to this, he is taking me to a Hollywood premiere - though we may be shuffled into the unglamorous secondary theater. I'm not sure if I am more bothered by the fact that the main theater (The Chinese) is prettier or the fact that it is less likely that anyone will mistake me for a celebrity there (in the run-off theater). I want to be Cosmo Brown in the beginning of  Singin' In The Rain ! Of course, Ben and Jennifer (not  that  Ben and Jennifer!) are no Don Lockwood and Lina Lamont.

      I guess not. I mean, I'm little, and a girl.  I was walking home this morning from cashing my check and buying milk, and there was a man on my corner with a beautiful, beautiful dog. I stepped aside a little when I stepped up onto the curb, because I didn't want to invade the pretty dog's space, but I guess the human thought I was avoiding her, because he said "She's all right," presumably meaning that she wouldn't bite me. Of course she wouldn't bite me! She was totally calm, just enjoying the sunshine. Still, I guess it was nice of him to assuage my nonexistent fear. I mean, supposing I was terrified of dogs! Of course, then his reassurances would probably not have helped. Anyway, I said, "No, she's beautiful," and asked what breed she is. I am terrible with breeds, even purebreeds. She was a Rottweiler-Beagle mix, which I really can't imagine except that I saw it with my own eyes.  I don't really understand why people are so terrified of Rottweilers. I've known a few, and they were the nicest dogs I have  ever  met. Ditto Pit Bulls. In fact, my favorite Rottweiler was about twice as big as me (seriously, he was enormous) and was the most mellow, friendly dog on earth. I think his name was Randy. His owner is the only person I've ever known who was murdered.   Anyway.   I have a pressing problem. I am up to  Fool For Love  on my  Buffy  season 5 DVDs, and I don't feel like watching it. I have had enough Spike. But I don't want to skip! I've gone totally in order so far!

      I had some fudge a little while ago and am suddenly  starving.  I had a good dinner and was totally full, just wanted a nummy treat (hence the fudge).  Sugar SUCKS! It totally fucked me up and now I am eating pretzels. In the grand scheme of things, a few pretzels isn't so bad, but I should probably stop eating sugar (at least after meals) if this is what is going to happen to me.  I'm also mildly hyper, but that's mostly manifesting itself in super-fast typing, which I won't complain about.

      Everybody knows that John is one of my best friends in the entire universe and that, short of breaking off my engagement so that he could turn Will gay, I'd do anything for him. Right? Good. So today he called me and over the course of the conversation I became convinced that he needs to go into film archiving (something that he's shown some interest in - I didn't come totally out of left field here) and looked at the USC and UCLA websites to see if they offered related graduate degrees. I was looking for something along the lines of film history, because he is already an amateur film historian, and I found  urlLink this  (click on  mias ). It is more perfect than anything I could have dreamed of. AND it would mean that he'd stop thinking about moving to LA and actually move to LA (assuming that he was accepted to the program, but he's brilliant and they will fall over themselves to admit him).  This is not the problem. Obviously, I am thrilled that I found this and I hope it really is what he wants.  The problem is this: I can talk to any of my friends about their interests and find ways to help them get to where they want to be. I am the go-to girl for advice in certain circles. But when it comes to myself, I am absolutely stuck. It isn't that I don't know what I want to do, it's that there are too many things that I am passionate about and I simply cannot narrow it down. I become overwhelmed and wind up just doing nothing. And frankly, I need to break out of this obscene level of laziness. The only thing I accomplished today was surprising Will with a nice dinner (and dropping off the rent check, which hardly counts as it was due on Thursday). The fact that I am content to just make dinner for my sweetheart helps, but I might not always be happy this way. I am afraid that I will turn around one day and discover that I have a nice home and a wonderful family and nothing else. And part of me only wants that, but part of me doesn't want to wake up in 20 years and realize that I never followed any of my  other  dreams. I have no regrets and I don't want to set myself up for any down the road, no matter how unlikely it might seem now.  My time is so poorly managed that I was actually thinking today that I ought to go find a full-time job so that at least my days would not be wasted. I honestly think I might be able to do more of the stuff I want to do if I had less time. And that, dear reader, is just sad. It goes against everything that should be true. And yet, there it is. When I worked at USA Today, a small part of me died every morning, but my apartment stayed clean and I occasionally got some writing done. I went out on a regular basis and had fun. Of course, I was also a functioning alcoholic who hated her life so much that she dated a man she didn't even like, but that's sort of beside the point because he was really quite easy on the eyes. Actually, I take that back - it is exactly the point! I am happy and stable now, and I am accomplishing less. I've become complacent.  Plus, my calves are still sore. I need my sister to come visit and force me to learn good stretching methods. Orbitz says it'll cost about $300. I'd better work on getting that job.

      My calves are very sore.  On Friday we hiked through The Devil's Punchbowl, a strange formation of rocks in the Angeles National Forest. There are pictures of it from last year in my Yahoo photo album, but I forgot to bring our camera this time. Wanda took some photos, though, so maybe I will eventually have copies.  Saturday was a day of (physical) rest, as we played Deadlands and then had dinner with Jenn's sister Morena and assorted friends. Sunday we drove to Malibu and went to the beach. Our preferred beach is accessed by a long set of stairs. I didn't go in the water (it was cold, damn it), but Will did, and Wanda too (she's crazy - she went  in  the water), and Shelby built a sandcastle. We also saw dolphins.  I did some leg lifts this morning but had to stop rather quickly as I couldn't breath. I think I'll just go up and down the stairs a few times later, and maybe walk around the block. If I keep exercising my legs, they'll get stronger and stop hurting, right?  As we all ought to know, I don't make resolutions. However, on January 1st I did keep a promise I'd made. I've had my bellybutton pierced for seven and a half years. It never healed properly. The scar tissue around the piercing is pink-ish, and it gets infected at least once a year. The last time it got infected, in December, I made the same vow I do every time: As soon as it's healed, I am taking out the jewelry and allowing it to close up. For the first time, I followed through. I kind of miss having it there to play with, but I suspect that such behavior was contributing to the infections, so it is for the best. Next time I will pierce my snood instead.  In closing, a note to my stalkers: I will be working on a new and improved template over the next week or so. If there is anything you've always wanted to see here, please tell me now.

       "But you are my heir; all that I had and might have had I leave to you." Will came to bed last night to find me in tears. I finished the story and cried in his arms. Today I am all right. After all, I have the appendices.   And now for something completely different.   Oh, man. GTA Vice City has great music and the voices are done by most of my boyfriends. Giving in on the PS2 was the best idea I ever had!  A snippet of conversation:  Annika: (hearing shrieks coming from the TV) Are you beating up a hooker? Will: Um...yes. I know it's very bad of me, but I beat up a hooker to take her money.  Yup. Best game ever.

      Today as I was getting dressed UPS arrived with an Amazon box for me. It contained Christmas gifts for us from Jason (Thunderstrike). The lateness was no fault of his, though I would certainly not have minded late gifts for any reason. He sent  The Anti-Bride Guide , a fun book on having an alternative wedding that actual fits your style instead of the norm, and  Buffy  season five.  Also today we went to the desert. I would like to write all about it, but I am so tired that I can barely remember my name. It is certain that part of my exhaustion is due to the hike we took through the Devil's Punchbowl. I am so out of shape that it's a miracle I made it. I think it was one mile. True story.  Two-thousand-Amy is shaping up very nicely. Now if only my guests would go away so I could watch  Buffy vs. Dracula , or, as I like to call it and was its original name,  Before Dawn.

      I am also not certain why certain people seem to think that January 1 is included in a blogging every day in  December  challenge, but oh well. I was going to blog anyway.  So our power came back on this morning, and nothing in the refrigerator is destroyed, so 2004 (or two-thousand-Amy) is all right thus far. Of course, I will be writing the wrong date on checks for the next couple of months, which will be exceptionally annoying. I guess it could be worse. (He could be driving the bus.)  Will, Shelby and Wanda are out walking. I have chosen to usher in the new year by not taking off the clothes I slept in (which also happen to be the clothes I wore yesterday). I  might  take these clothes off later, but only because a bath sounds nice and I find that those are less gross if you are naked.  In other news, Rian got me high last night. She is no good. No good at all.  In conclusion, my fingernails are dirty and I am considering a fourth cappuccino.

      We were driving around yesterday and I suggested we stop at the jewelry store where we bought my engagement ring to look at wedding bands. While we were there (we found gorgeous bands, by the way) they offered to clean up my ring. It's so sparkly!  I don't have anything intelligent to say, because I can't stop looking at my ring for more than five seconds. No wonder people like diamonds so much! I feel like such a  girl.   Pat made a post asking if/why people hate ME (Mutant Enemy). I would like to make a reply, because I have many unflattering things to say about Joss Whedon, but I don't care enough about most of the people on the WD who would read it to feel bothered. Maybe I will answer it here, at some point.  It's funny. I still love the WD, but I rarely feel compelled to post there, particularly about the show. I love the people, but rarely feel the need to get to know anyone new. (Not necessarily meaning new to the board, but rather new to me.) Having this blog has given me the outlet I need for just about everything that I want to talk about.  I'm hungry. Bye.

      I was looking through some job listings, and had gotten bored of the administrative listings, so I scooted over to "miscellaneous."  I found an, er,  opportunity  to make $5000 in just a few months. There were many requirements, including these: Non-smoker, NO Drug users!  College student / College graduate Given the nature of the job, The first line makes perfect sense. However, the college requirement is even more absurd than it is for most jobs. I can understand potential employers buying into the assumption that if you don't have a college education you can't file or answer the phone, even though it is clearly untrue. But for  this ? All that should be required is consent and good health.  Guessing games be damned. It's egg donation. So I suppose that being female would also be a reasonable requirement...

      So. Will and I (er, I mean "Pooh and Piglet") were on the list for last night's star-studded premiere of  Starsky and Hutch.  Thing is, we both kinda wanted to see the movie, and I wanted to go to a premiere most desperately, but we went to  Along Came Polly , which satisfied that itch. And Will's been having a lousy week. Totally overworked and just exhausted. So I told him yesterday morning that if he decided he didn't want to go, that was fine. It would save me the trouble of taking a shower. Besides, all of Hollywood is shut down the week before the Oscars, to prevent the planting of bombs or something, so the premiere was out near UCLA. Traffic between us and UCLA during rush hour on a weeknight is a  nightmare.  So once I convinced him that I wouldn't care, Will said he'd rather stay home. Then he dropped the bomb: If we dropped out, Andy Dick would get his ticket.  Will has worked for Mr. Stiller for about four years now. (If anyone who reads this was unaware of that, it's probably because it was a secret for a while, and once it became OK for the general public to know it, I couldn't remember who I'd told in confidence. Or possibly I just don't know you.) Andy Dick worked with Ben on The Ben Stiller Show, if not earlier. That's more than 12 years. Yet Will was ahead of him on the list. By me-logic, that means that I am more important than Andy Dick. Which really, I could have told you ages ago, but I could never have proved it until now.

      That isn't aimed at anyone in particular. I've just been feeling the urge to say it all day.  I promised substance for this update, which was a terrible mistake; I don't have anything to say.  I'm starting to get upset about  Angel 's cancellation, because Mutant Enemy has a lot of plot threads going and they're all good for once (the most recent one is still uncertain, but that's a given), and I don't know how they're going to resolve things to my satisfaction. And it is  all about me.   Last night I made pizza. And it was good. I should make pizza every day.  I've been planning out my dream house, so that I can be prepared for crushing disappointment when we eventually go house shopping. The good news is that I figured out how we can afford to have one. The bad news is that now I have to find a full-time job. By my calculations, even if my take-home is only a grand a month, we can pay off debts within six months, take a little vacation, and have a down-payment within one to three years.  We'll probably have to get a second car, which would set us back, but only by a month or so if we buy a clunker and plan to trade it in later. I'm also hoping for some cash gifts at the wedding, but not counting on it, as most of the people we know aren't exactly wealthy.  A  urlLink WD discussion  on Angel's cancellation has turned into a pitch fest for a reality series. I feel that my contributions were priceless and should be read by all.  As hinted on Saturday, the wedding issues pretty much resolved themselves. Will's parents were being very pushy about hosting a rehearsal dinner  their  way, and we objected. They pulled out, leaving it up to us to come up with an alternative (if we so choose). This is exactly what we wanted, but we're a little annoyed that they didn't let us tell them that. I plan to get my revenge* by going shopping with my sister. What kind of lingerie does one wear with a wedding dress, anyway?  Will and I are starting a Production Company at some indeterminate time in the future. Any possible financial backers are welcome.  San Francisco judges continue to rock my world.  Robert Rodriguez, normally a favorite of mine, is taking on the movie adaptation of Sin City, my favorite graphic novel of all time. I am really not thrilled with the idea. However, Frank Miller (the author) will be heavily involved, so there is some hope. And if nothing else,  Batman  will kick ass. I think I will die if it doesn't. (Blogger spellcheck wants to replace "Batman" with "Bateman." I loved The Hogan Family and all, but puh- leaze. )   *this is actually a non-sequitur.

      In a completely unexpected battle maneuver, Will's parents completely reversed their strategy, leaving us stranded with a lot of rage and no one to direct it at. Damn it. Maybe we could get a punching bag...  In other news, I remembered how to write. As in, actual, honest-to-goodness, I could get this published if I bothered writing. It is utterly terrifying and strangely arousing.

      In the north-east, this would be a light drizzle. Here in Los Angeles, however, it is a torrential downpour. I'm cold. I'm wet. I had the porch doors open so that I could air the place out, as has become my morning habit. The damn rain came  through  the screen (amazing!) and soaked the carpet, which I had to walk across to close the door. I did the only reasonable thing, which was to turn on the heat.  I had nightmares all night. This tension about the wedding is really making it difficult for me to function. I am very close to pushing Will into the car and driving to Vegas. This makes me angry because I don't  want  to change the plans we've already made. I  like  the plans we've made. The dreams were so upsetting that when I woke up and tried to call to Will, "monkey" came out "mommy."  My friend Saria and her boyfriend may be coming over for breakfast, but I haven't heard from them yet. I am trying to decide if I ought to just eat something on my own. I'm not actually hungry, but something tells me food would help.  I think I might just watch a lot of TV today. Of course, it's daytime and we don't have cable, so it is DVD or nothing. Thank god for season 5 of  Buffy  and season 2 of  Angel.  I'm not really in the mood for either, but then, I'm not really in the mood for  anything.  Maybe I will watch  Aliens  and scare myself silly. Maybe I will allow reason to win and watch something comforting and un-scary, like  Paper Moon.   Maybe I will follow through on yesterday's threat and spend  all day  in the bathtub.

      To be fair, I'm not entirely  un happy either. Mostly just frustrated. There is a wedding-related issue that someone other than Will or I has decided to take control of, and while it may not be a big deal, I feel very ganged up on. So I did the logical (cry-baby) thing and called my father, because I knew that he would agree with me. Now it is just a matter of time and discussion to try to remind everyone else that this is not about them. Yes, I am selfish. Last time I checked, only Will and I had opinions that counted.  There. Just had to get that off my chest. I won't be giving any details, because for the time being it's a private matter. I just needed a brief rant, and felt the need to explain (albeit poorly) why I am so very grumpy.  Everything else about this weekend was wonderful. Will came home on Friday with his arms full of pressies. He gave me potted tulips, a box of chocolates, a bottle of champagne, an amazingly wonderful CD he made, and another potted flower that I keep forgetting the name of. It's really, really pretty. I made him a nice dinner, and we spent most of the evening sitting on the couch, staring at each other, most likely with goofy expressions on our faces. I think we were entitled.  Six years.  Gee whiz, that's a long time.  On Saturday we went out for lunch. We ate at an Indian restaurant, then went into Hollywood and stopped off at the Origins store. I'd only intended to purchase their salt butter bath stuff, but was suckered into some really terrific face products. They sell some other things, including an  amazing  body moisturizer, that I am just dying to go back for, but apparently you pay for quality, and we don't have that sort of money lying around.  That reminds me, I think I need a really nice, long bath.  Saturday night we watched Fritz Lang's  M . Unfortunately, the quality of the print combined with the white subtitles made my head hurt, and I fell asleep during part of it. The really sad part is that it was the Criterion edition, which means it's the best there is. It did look very good, all things considered, but the whites just hurt my eyes. Maybe it is time that I looked into getting new glasses. I'm started to get headaches more frequently again.  On Sunday we went grocery shopping. Our fridge is so full! I love that. Sunday evening we went to Alan and Kim's for a Presidents Day party. It was supposed to be on the day itself (Monday), but Corey Feldman messed everything up. Don't ask. It was a nice gathering, and we got to see our beloved Sean. They've given him another episode of  Everwood  to write, and it sounds like a good one! I am very excited. (Speaking of  Everwood , I think there was a new episode last night, but we didn't watch. Yay for Big Sunday!)  Yesterday we met with Emmy to talk about wedding invitations. I'm quite pleased with the possibilities we came up with. We need to send out our "Save the Date" letters soon, but first have to finish looking into local hotels and reserve a block of rooms at one of them. Will volunteered to do this, so I suppose that I will take charge of the dreadfully important (not) task of choosing paper to print them on. I think if we go with something slightly heavier than regular printer paper (around resume weight) we can just fold them and tape them shut, stick on a stamp, and send them off without envelopes. We will obviously address them as well. We also decided to use postcards for the reply cards in the invites, which I am pleased about: less postage and less  dainty.  I am not fond of dainty. I am also not fond of people who obsess over wedding details, so I am going to go flog myself now. And by flog myself, I mean take that soothing bath and sort the laundry.  Oh!  One  more wedding thing, and then I promise I'm done. I need some opinions - should I put together a wedding website, with information about hotels and local entertainment and the like? I think it's probably a good idea, as we could put all of the crucial information in one place (crucial as in registry information, of course), but it also has the potential to be a lot of work, and I don't know if everyone we're inviting has computers.  In conclusion, we also watched  Alien: Resurrection  this weekend, which I liked better the first time I saw it, and  Metropolis , which is a two hour pro-union propoganda piece, but very, very neat-looking.

      First, an apology: I wrote the first installment before I posted it here. As in, before I even came online. I did not do that with this one, because I was busy all weekend being in the relationship rather than thinking about its beginning. And now, I am really tired and just want to go to bed, so this is going to be brief* and sucky. Maybe someday I'll expand on it.   Valentine's Day  seemed strange that year, having a fiance but no boyfriend (if you know what I mean). I made Will the ugliest (UGLIEST!) Valentine possible, out of pink construction paper and lace and crap. We walked through campus, admiring the fliers our friend Adrain had posted EVERYWHERE. They were photocopies of our marriage license. Yes, the thought of it now makes me ill. I don't know - at the time I just thought the whole thing was hilarious. On the path that led to the library and/or science building (I can't remember which), we spotted a girl carrying loads of balloons. Will doesn't remember any of this, but it is clear as day to me. He did not want the girl to talk to him, so he grabbed me and held me against his chest, bending over me so that it appeared, I suppose, that we were smooching. I felt very odd about the whole thing - who knows, maybe I was beginning to be attracted to him, or maybe I suspected that he was attracted to me.  The next day was a bad day. I went shopping with two friends, and we were harassed by a man who worked at the shop. It's a long story, but I assure you that it was far more of an ordeal than the typical abuse by salespeople in crappy stores. (Er, I do not mean to imply that all salespeople are abusive, just to say that when they  are , they are generally not as bad as this guy was.) When the three of us arrived back at campus, we went to a remote location where people did not tend to walk around, and broke bottles. When we'd sufficiantly relieved our stress, we went to Adrian's room. Adrian had kicked his roommate out (well, his roommate had moved) and pushed three or four beds together to make one huge bed. There were several people sprawled about watching the end of  12 Angry Men  or  Hung Jury  or some movie with a name like that. Except it wasn't  12 Angry Men , because I'm fairly certain it was a western. ANYWAY. Will was there, and Robin and Hilary and I joined everyone. The next movie was  Event Horizon.  If you've seen it, you know that it is absolute shit, but the last 20 minutes alternate between being comical and absolutely terrifying. At some point during the movie I had started leaning on Will's shoulder, as he was sitting in front of me. Toward the end, we both came to the somewhat distressing realization that we were holding hands. When the movie ended we (separately) retreated quickly, hoping no one had noticed.  So. Today (six years ago). When I said Sunday was bad, I meant without Monday for comparison. Monday was one of the worst days of my life. I lived in North, in Randall Hall. There was a hall phone, a door down from mine, for all incoming calls. It started ringing at about eight in the morning - quite unusual. I was prone to ignoring the phone if I felt the hour was unreasonable, but something made me answer it. It was my friend Emily from back home, in hysterical tears. Before I'd left for Antioch I'd been a nanny to two splendid children. That fall, their mother had given birth to twins, David and Henry, who I had met over Christmas break. Emily occasionally babysat, and was best friends with my replacement, another good friend, Lara. They had just been woken up by a call from Melanie (the mom). Henry had died of SIDS overnight. They had just returned from the hospital (and Paul, the father, who found Henry, from the police station, which is procedure but MY GOD, how awful). Melanie was a wreck. Emily was a wreck. And I went into shock. There was a table sitting outside my door, and half an hour later two of my hallmates came out of their rooms and found me just sitting on it, not speaking. They got me to tell them the basic jist of what had happened, and practically dragged me to the cafeteria, wisely deciding that I needed at the very least some juice, and definitely to not be sitting on the table anymore. Liz and Tyler? I don't know where you are, but thanks.  I spent the rest of the day in a daze. I skipped my afternoon class (aikido), but had to go to my evening Lit class, because the professor only allowed three absences. I had already missed one class because I'd fallen asleep with a migraine, and I thought I'd probably have to miss at least one more to go back to New York. I pulled her aside before class and explained, fibbing that it was a relative (he might as well have been, as I considered his siblings my children), and I left at break time. Back in Randall, Hilary and Robin were painting their nails (it's amazing how one remembers the inane details) and were very solicitous - how did I feel, was I all right, et cetera. I couldn't take any of that, and told them I was going for a walk. I told Hil not to worry if I didn't come back (her room was right next to mine and she was the RA), as I might stay at Adrian's so as not to be alone.  This was a patent falsehood, though I am not certain if I knew that when I said it.  From the back door of my dormitory, Adrian's place was to the right. I took a sharp left and walked directly to West, where I found Will in his neighbor Jake's room. A girl named Lela was also there, and offered me some Bushmills. I had purposely avoided alcohol all day, but accepted a sip to help me calm down. Will asked me into his room, and I went. It should be noted that he was terrifically drunk. He showed me some new lyrics that he and Cliff had written to "Birdhouse in Your Soul," which had me rolling on the floor laughing. Alas, sadness set in again. Though I would deny it with my dying breath if anyone else said it, Will is not the smartest guy on earth when he's had a few too many, and he decided that the best way to cheer me up would be to kiss me. I slapped him.  Yes, I did.  From there things get fuzzy. I believe he announced that he needed to introduce me to his next-door neighbor Rachael; we knocked on her door and he introduced me as his fiance, and gave me a quick smooch. All I know for sure is that at some point after this, I was quite agreeable about the kissing stuff. I even slept in his bed - but it should be noted that I never undressed. I just sort of fell asleep, though I had, of course, every intention of staying. Will was an utter gentleman, and even wore sweatpants to sleep in, which must have been wretchedly uncomfortable in that over-heated room.  And that has you all up-to-date until about five a.m. on the 17th.   to be concluded...next month.    *Did I say brief? Ha ha ha ha ha.

      FACT: Will and I were introduced by mutual friends at college.  FACT: One of our mutual friends, whom we lovingly refer to as "Crazy Jen," was off campus during the semester that Will and I met.  FACT: Jen was about as anti-romance as you can be if you are still, somehow, boy-crazy. She was also really goth-y.  FACT: When Will and I, still merely acquaintances, discovered that Friday the 13th and Valentine's Day were happening in conjunction with one another, we decided that we'd have to fetch Jen from Indiana, or go to her, or  something.   FACT: Several of our friends had seen  The Replacement Killers  the weekend before, and told us that it was terrific. We made plans to go see it together on Thursday.  FACT: The following things happened on Thursday: 1. Jen replied to my email, in which I had sneakily suggested that I was going to call her and wondered if she'd be home, with the bad news that she was scheduled to work all weekend. 2. Will and I, independent of one another, realized that going to the movies together was not unlike a date, panicked, and both backed out.  FACT: Since kidnapping Jen was now out of the question, Will and I tried to come up with a new plan for the weekend, since we felt obligated to amuse one another. (Note that this, somehow, did  not  strike us as being too date-like.) Will suggested that we drive to Vegas and get hitched by Elvis. I responded favorably, being an Elvis fan. We talked it over, coming to the conclusion that we wouldn't get back in time for classes on Monday. We then decided (at least one of us may have been drinking) that it would be a good idea to get married locally, and have it annulled on Valentine's Day. We went to the local police station, having deduced that it was the only place at which we could acquire information about the Green County, Ohio, marriage requirements at approximately midnight. They told us where to go (the county courthouse).  And this brings us up to date (the date being Friday, February 13, 1998).  I had told Will that I would only marry him if there was coffee involved. He arrived at my dorm and woke me up at about 7:30, bearing a thermos of weak coffee. Really awful coffee. The worst.  We drove to Xenia (the same one from the They Might Be Giants song) and went into the courthouse to find out what we needed to do, if anything, and where we could find a justice of the peace. We left armed with the knowledge that we needed only our drivers' licenses, $40 for the license, and our parents' consent if we were under 18 (we were not). I believe we were told that we ought to look in the phone book to find an officiant.  We went back to school and ate breakfast in the cafeteria (something that I think I did a total of three times while at Antioch), then found our friend Hilary, who was going into Xenia and offered to drive us back to get the license. (I am really not sure why we didn't get it the first time we were there. Maybe the office was closed, or maybe we panicked a little.)  When we sat down in the office, we grabbed hold of each other's hands and held on tight. I think I almost broke his hand. He was so nervous that the capillaries around his eyes swelled so that he looked hungover, or perhaps as though he'd been in a fight. We signed the paperwork and handed over our forty dollars.  When we returned to campus, we were both a bit sobered by the knowledge that we actually had a piece of paper allowing us to legally get married. I suggested that perhaps, since we knew nothing of annulments or their cost, we ought to wait and get married the following month. February being (usually) 28 days, March would also have a Friday the 13th, and we could get the marriage annulled on April Fool's Day instead. Will agreed, and we set about notifying everyone of our upcoming wedding.  The reactions were very funny. Some people knew it was a joke. Of those people, some thought it was funny, and some warned us that we would almost certainly fall in love, because that would just be even funnier. Some people thought we were already in love. A lot of people suddenly knew who I was. I guess that's what happens when you announce your engagement to an infamous senior.  That night, Will came to my dorm again, with an "engagement ring." He had driven to Wal-Mart, or possibly Meijers, with our friend Adrian, and given him several dollars in quarters for one of the machines that gives you jewelry in little plastic bubbles. From that selection, Will chose a purple ring - one of the little metal ones. I know you've all seen them. I made him get down on one knee, and he proposed. I accepted, giggled a lot, and didn't take the ring off for about four years.   to be continued.

      Lucky for him, the person doing the instructing is one of the few who has not yet found a way to offend me for more than three seconds.  Therefore, an update. I am afraid it will be of very little substance, as I have next to nothing to say, but I aim to please, and shall endeavor to do my best.  What do you mean, big words aren't going to cut it?  I'm trying here.   I'm afraid that my outfit is not nearly as cute as yesterday's. Though I have once again opened both doors, I did not come upstairs until afternoon, so the warm weather has had time to creep in. I  am  wearing a sweater of Will's, if that helps any.  The day before yesterday I sadly informed Will that the computer I want costs $2600. He said that if he had the money, he would buy it for me. I then bravely told him that if he had $2600 I would prefer it go toward the purchase of a house. As much as I hate my current computer, and as badly as it needs replacing, I would rather have a permanant place to hang my hat. I can't think of anything (material) that I want more than a house. Maybe a wedding ring, but that will cost a few hundred dollars at the most.  House, house, house, house, house.  When we were driving to the airport on Friday, Will pointed out a house that he thought was pretty. It was pretty much exactly the sort of house I want! We are clearly meant to buy a house together.  Um, I also want a baby, but not nearly as much as I want a house.  *Runs downstairs in a panic to make sure last night's birth-control pill was taken on schedule*  Er, clearly I am a wee bit conflicted on the matter.  Best words out of my mouth recently (in response to Stacey's comment on Buffy & Spike's sex in "Smashed" being the good variety):  Oh, no. I've had that sex. It only ends in rawness and pain.   This was, of course, followed up by Will asking me just who, exactly, I had that sex with. He's a dope.  And...I'm done.

      According to Yahoo! it is currently 58&#176; (fahrenheit) and "Fair" in Los Angeles, with a high of 72&#176;. While I realize that this is quite toasty compared to other parts of the world, I am really chilly! This is most likely due to the fact that I have both porch doors wide open in an attempt to air out the apartment (and myself). The fresh air is doing me a world of good, but I am wearing an absurd amount of clothing considering that I am just lounging about at home. I have on sweatpants, a long sleeve shirt, house shoes, and Will's bathrobe.  I hope that was satisfying to any of you who I'm sure are tempted daily to ask what I am wearing. S-E-X-X-Y.  In other news, I took care of  my  "your" friend and the wedding stuff. I wrote a nice email and forced John to let me read it to him. He made a few suggestions and I sent it off. Haven't heard back, but I think I've done all I could. And I was nice. Thank you all for your suggestions. Now if you could just tell me how to handle my future mother-in-law, that'd be terrif.  In still  other  news, I have come to the conclusion that my early successes with html were just beginner's luck, or some such rot, because I cannot seem to accomplish anything with it now. So I hope no one else finds my current blog layout as repulsively boring as I do, because it looks like it's here to stay.  In conclusion, Duskfire is coming over later. You may all proceed to be jealous.

      Let's say that you are getting married in October. It's February now. You've written out a guest list, but have not finalized it.  An old college friend, who you have not been in touch with much, sends you an email. She has to put in her vacation requests, and wants to know if she ought to request the wedding date.  Would you feel that she was effectively saying "Tell me NOW if I am invited," and possibly guilting you into saying "yes" even though you are not prepared to do so yet? Would you perhaps feel inclined to tell her she wasn't invited, even though she probably would have made it to the final list if you weren't feeling pressured?  Or would you think that she was a good friend at one time and is merely asking because she has to, and respond in kind? And would it make any difference if you felt that she had been manipulative in the past?

      One of my favorite sub-genres of horror is the Evil House. Not the Haunted House, necessarily, but Evil.  Shirley Jackson's most famous novel is  The Haunting of Hill House.  Rightfully so, because it scared the piss out of me.  Every single time I read it.  Though it is said that the people who die there don't leave, it is not exactly implied that their ghosts  haunt  the premises, while it is  stated  that the house itself is not right.  Richard Matheson (author of  I Am Legend , the best vampire fiction I've come across to date) wrote a book called  Hell House.  I didn't care for it so much, as it read like a rather disgusting rip-off of  The Haunting of Hill House , but Will was quite terrified by it, so I assume it must have had plenty going for it. It is not entirely clear in his book whether the house has become evil or the Bad Things are caused  entirely  by the 'ghost' of the original owner (and possibly other dead residents - it's been a while since I read it), but it seems to be the latter.  In 1963, Robert Wise directed  The Haunting , based upon Shirley Jackson's novel. It's a fairly faithful adaptation, and quite a good picture.  Oddly, the 1963 Roger Corman movie  The Terror  was, according to imdb (not the most reliable source), called  The Haunting  for its television airing(s).  In 1973, John Hough directed  The Legend of Hell House , based on Richard Matheson's novel. I've never seen it, but again, Will was terrified.  In 1999, Jan de Bont directed  The Haunting , supposedly based on Shirley Jackson's novel, or on the original  The Haunting , or possibly on a weird dream he had one time. It is fucking awful. I couldn't sit through the whole thing. He added ghosts and a ridiculously contrived  reason  for the Evil/Haunting of the house. It was a typical modern horror movie, relying too much on special effects and giving no credit whatsoever to its audience. Waste of time. There is a terrific theory  urlLink here  that Mr. de Bont mistakenly thought he was making  Hell House: the movie  with the characters from  The Haunting of Hill House.  Easy mistake. Hell, Hill - almost the same word.  Interestingly, there is a 1999 film, directed by Mitch Marcus, called  The Haunting of Hell House . It is based on a Henry James story. I have not read the story or seen the movie, but you can bet that I will be looking into both. I certainly find the title suspicious, but Henry James died the year Shirley Jackson was born, so I'm not sure where to aim my suspicion. Oh, nevermind, I looked it up. The original story was called "The Ghostly Rental," and Roger Corman is apparently to blame for the new title. I certainly can't begrudge any attempts he makes to get people to watch his movies.

      Because I had about eight billion things I was going to blog about last night, but I opted to go to bed instead. I can't really be blamed, as it was Will's first night home and I wanted to snuggle. But now I forget everything I was going to say. I guess I will just have to wing it.   Cassie and I were going to have a Cary Grant marathon. We watched  His Girl Friday , which I somehow had managed to never see previously, and  The Philadelphia Story , which is still terrific. Then I was pretty sleepy, so we watched the first episode of  Joan of Arcadia , figuring that 44 minutes was about all I could stay up for. That was at about 10:30. At 1:30, we went to bed. That show is great! We watched several more episodes in the morning. I think seven in total. I just love that Joan is constantly listening to music with headphones, because it reminds me of "Bigmouth Strikes Again" by the Smiths.   And now I know how Joan of Arc felt Now I know how Joan of Arc felt As the flames rose to her Roman nose And her walkman started to melt...    When I got home, I immediately got angry. I had a sign up next to my door, by the bell, which is broken and has been forever. The sign read "Bell out of order, please knock." It's from  The Wizard of Oz.  It was necessary because when we get deliveries, they'd press the button and never notice that there was no accompanying bell. Someone took it down/stole it. I doubt it was the management, because it's been there for 6 months and I'm pretty sure they'd have asked me to remove it if they had some big problem with it. Plus, it happened on either Saturday or Sunday. So I am composing a letter to my neighbors in my head. It begins,  Dear Cowardly Neighbor,  Though your heart is made of tin and your brains of straw, I'd have expected enough decency from you to at least leave my shit alone.  I'll get you, my pretty.  It's still in draft form, obviously.    Dodgeball  is as great as I'd hoped it would be, and then some. Seriously, I started laughing about 2 seconds in (the opening montage is  killer  if you find people getting hurt amusing), and at points I was laughing so hard I cried. I told Will it was the funniest movie I'd ever seen, but he reminded me of  BASEketball.  Well, anyway,  Dodgeball  is sure to reach a wider audience. Apparently  some  people weren't amused by  BASEketball.  Weirdos.   I have a little bit of a dilemma. It seems that Will's mother was  this  close to using a picture taken at Thanksgiving (of Will's parents, Will and I, and Will's sister, Sarah, and her boyfriend) for their Christmas card. They want to do so next year. Sarah said that they couldn't use a picture of Jason because she isn't married to him. Will says that he tried to object to he and I being on their Christmas card as well, and met, um,  resistance  from his mother and his usually reasonable aunt.  How can I put this? I WILL NOT BE ON THEIR FUCKING CHRISTMAS CARD AND NEITHER WILL MY HUSBAND IF THEY KNOW WHAT'S GOOD FOR THEM. So how do I approach them on this subject? Clearly it isn't necessary to do so immediately - I think that after the wedding would be just fine. Also perfectly clear is the need to be a bit more, er, delicate about it. It's very simple to me - I have not joined  their  family. Will and I have created a  new  family, and the families that we came from, while still part of our lives, are not the families that we  belong  to.  Is it still acceptable (er, as much as it ever was) for Sicilians to whack people and leave things like horses' heads in their beds? 'Cause I could probably do something like that if I had to.   Tonight on  Everwood , there will be sex. Am I the only one slightly grossed out by this? I have no good reason for it.

      Yesterday when I got out of the shower Will was watching the KTLA morning news. I never, ever watch KTLA news, because it's generally retarded, but all I cared about was coffee, so whatever.  The television quickly grabbed my attention when I realized that Peter Jackson was sitting in one of the chairs at the news table. Barefoot, of course. I think he might have had a footbath or something on the floor. Hee! We have one of those. They're great.  Anyway, they were talking about the Oscars (of course), and he was saying how weird the whole thing was, because he's busy working on the  King Kong  script now. He's done with  Lord of the Rings.  He's finished cutting the extended edition of  Return of the King .   He's finished cutting the extended edition of  Return of the King .    I WANT IT NOW! It's not  fair.   I mean, OK, it's still in theaters and I still haven't gone back for a second viewing, but damn it. I want that DVD. There isn't even a release date yet.

      Of course, that would most likely involve leaving the house. But I did that today and I survived (barely!), so I guess anything is possible.  Anyway.  In LAX news, I discovered today that Harvey Keitel wears a man-purse. Not one of the briefcase sized ones, but the little cloth bags with the crocheted straps. It's black and very nice. I couldn't identify anything in it other than his plane ticket. I would have tried to get a closer look (he was standing  right next to me ), but all I could think was "I've seen your penis." So I pretended not to notice him at all. Something tells me he'd appreciate that if he knew.  I was at the airport to pick up my little monkey Saria, who I haven't seen in three and a half years. We get along as well as we ever did, which is very, so let's call today a good day, even if my shoulders hurt so much that they feel like they're on fire. I'm sure that if I got any exercise whatsoever I would not be in this sort of pain, so it is entirely my fault.  I have to go to the airport again tomorrow to drop Will off. He is leaving me for two whole days, which might not sound like much, but I really like being around him and it's making me sad. I shall compensate by going down to Cassie's. That way I won't have to be home by myself as much  and  I'll get to see my sweet Cassandra.  On Sunday I go back to the airport to pick Will up from his return flight. Then I have a respite of a week and a half before John arrives. Forget a gossip column, I should run an airport shuttle.  In crappy news, I might be off the list for the  Dodgeball  screening. Poop. More on that when I find out for sure.  Oh - I had to un- and re-install MSN Messenger. I think I successfully saved my contact list, but they're doing "routine maintenance," so I don't know for sure if I'll be able to import it. We shall see.  I don't think I had anything else to say.

      Nick Nunziata runs  urlLink CHUD.com , my favorite movie site. You probably all knew that already, since I link to them about once a week.  The other night I was reading his daily column, "The Steady Leak," which is the new version of his old column, "Piss and Vinegar." He's currently visiting LA from his home in Georgia, hanging out with Guillermo del Toro, who's finishing up  Hellboy  (my #1 most anticipated movie of the year, followed by  Dodgeball ). I wasn't tired enough to go to bed, so I sent him a quick email. Er, Nick, not Guillermo. Trust me, if I had Guillermo's email address, I'd probably also have a restraining order against me. It was basically a lame sort of "I love you, I love Guillermo, be my friend" sort of email, and after I wrote it I managed to completely forget that I'd done so.  He printed it in today's column. This isn't anything unusual, as he always prints a few letters, often with hilarious responses, but MAN ALIVE, was his response to me nice. Unfortunately, when he copied & pasted my subject line, he pasted a sentence from a nasty letter he'd printed a few days earlier instead of mine (which you can see above).  All is forgiven, as it is not a big deal AT ALL. I'd say that I plan to attend whatever sort of get-together he plans for Friday, but Will might decide not to marry me if I meet Nick  and  go to the  Dodgeball  screening on Sunday.

      I was going to watch the news this morning while I drank my coffee, but I had to stop. When I turned on the TV, a reporter was saying that two escapees had been recaptured near the I-5 without incident.  I had to drop everything I was doing (not literally) and say  No. Not without incident.   In conclusion, go watch  Equilibrium   now  if you haven't seen it yet.

      Usually I am fairly neutral about the whole thing, but today I am jumping for joy. You see, on Sunday there is to be a non-industry screening of a movie I have been excited about since, oh, forever or thereabouts.  I never read the screenplay (wink, wink), because that would have been  bad  of anyone who might have given it to me. I did pimp out the original  Terry Tate: Office Linebacker  short to anyone who would watch it, and gushed about the remake(s) for Reebok. That Rawson Marshall Thurber is  going places.   I just hope to god this movie is as good as it ought to be.  It's the same movie that Will and I attended the wrap party for back in December (where we met Alan Tudyk). Will is out of town this weekend, so I'll be dragging a posse of friends over to the Fox lot on Sunday afternoon to watch  The Movie Will Discovered  sans Will.  I'm trying really hard to feel as bad as I ought to.  However it goes, I plan to laugh my ass off through the whole thing. Fox hasn't started their ad campaign yet, and I don't want them to kill this movie the way they've been known to kill one of my favorite television shows.

      After nearly three months of procrastination, I have changed my ReBlogger code so that comments from all (hopefully) browsers will show up. This means that all of my old IE comments have vanished, though you can still see them if you remove the [blogitemnumber] from the URL of the comments page. I am fairly sure that all of the (old) Netscape-based comments that didn't show up before will show up now, which I find amusing.  Let's see if I managed to do this without screwing anything up...

      Will brought me a present yesterday. It was a Velentine card made by a homeless man. The man asked Will for spare change, but insisted on "selling" him one of the cards he'd made, because he's "got [his] pride." I just think that is so sad. I want to go over to the coffee shop where the man was and see if he is still there, but there isn't anything I could do for him except buy him a cup of coffee.  I just got an email from my friend Saria who I haven't seen or talked to in over three years. Not only did she track me down, but she'll be in LA in a few days. Yippee! She now replaces Tim/Tem as my oldest friend that I am currently in contact with. Now I have just to track down Riva, who I met in the sixth grade.  For those of you able to view my Yahoo wedding thingy, there are more photos now. For those of you not on the list, my apologies. If you really, really want to see the pictures, pop me an email with your Yahoo ID. I'm not promising anything, as I want to keep this semi-private, but I know I left some people out. Rest assured, it is NOT very exciting. Mostly ideas.  There is information out about  Angel  through episode 17, which I guess is shooting now. I hate it that spoilers are so accessible!  Hate it.   Last night's  Everwood  was awesome, even if Berlanti nixed Sean's shout-out to me and Will. Damn you, Berlanti!  I feel like having a party. This is really weird, because I don't like parties.

      I was of two minds whether I should join, but I wound up doing so because it couldn't really cause any harm.  Today around six or seven I got email notification of a message from my friend Mark. Yay! I clicked on the link. It took me to my message center thingy and told me that I had no messages. Around nine I got email notification of a testimonial from Katherine. Yay! My first one.  My entire existence is validated!  I clicked on the link. It took my to my testimonial page and told me that I had no testimonials.   my entire existence is worthless!   I signed out and am cursing Friendster repeatedly, in assorted languages.

      My first thought as I walk out the door is that I should have worn my sunglasses. They're inside, up two flights of stairs. My eyes are already starting to adjust, and I want to walk. As I step onto the sidewalk a chilly breeze hits my bare white arms. Combined with the sun, it makes for the nicest weather Los Angeles has seen in weeks.  I walk, squinting a little bit, towards Western Avenue. My destination is Magic Tobacco, a shop whose name evokes images of something a bit different than the Marlboro Red Kings I'm planning to purchase. As if the universe heard my thoughts, I walk inside and notice for the first time a glass display case full of beautiful glass pipes. One of them is shaped like an octopus, which pleases me.  I leave the shop and as I walk past Carl's Jr the smell of french fries hits me. For a minute I think I'm hungry, but it's probably just the smell tricking me. The drivers, usually so inconsiderate in my neighborhood, wait patiently for me to cross the street at the four-way stops on my way home. I admire the climbing flowers on my favorite house and take the long way around my building so that I can check the mail.  Someone has given me a credit card, which is a bit of a shock. I try to push aside thoughts of vacations and new clothing, replacing them (with moderate success) with thoughts of emergency money and a long-overdue dentist visit.  I look outside and the last bit of sun is struggling to keep its hold on my deck. Downstairs there is a streak of light across the balcony. The fuchsia's leaves seem to be leaning toward it. I look down at the floor and see my book, waiting. The canvas chair sits next to the fuchsia, and the sun is low enough that my eyes will be shaded.  The temptation is stronger than any desire I'm harboring to be indoors.

       urlLink Guardian Unlimited | Special reports | Gay couples win full rights to 'marriage'   Go Britain! I am not familiar with the 'traditional' marriage laws over there, so I am not really qualified to comment on this (the Civil Partnerships Bill), especially as very little information is offered. England seems to be our main political ally lately, so I have some hope that this could have influence on American gay rights. Some.

What is the name of the company whose catalogs usually show up on airplane seatbacks? They have Brookstone-like products, but aren't Brookstone.  Yes, it really is  dreadfully  important.

      When I was a little girl and had never heard of Elvis Presley, I thought that Graceland was surely another name for heaven. My parents were not religious, but I knew about heaven and while I didn't necessarily believe in it personally, I had a fairly decent idea what believers thought heaven was like.  My father is a classical musician. He plays timpani for American Ballet Theater, and my favorite music growing up was Tchaikovsky. The Nutcracker, of course, but also Swan Lake and Sleeping Beauty, and plenty of music by other composers too, mostly music that was written for or turned into ballets. The only rock and roll I remember hearing early on was The Beatles' White Album and Paul Simon's Graceland. I have memories of Bonnie Raitt's Nick Of Time as well, but I think that came later.  My favorite Beatles song was "Buffalo" Bill*, as I pronounced it at that age, and my favorite Paul Simon was Graceland. It wasn't until recently that I remembered my early assumption that Graceland was heaven, and even as an adult it makes perfect sense to me. "I have reason to believe we all will be received in Graceland." What a lovely image that evokes - heaven as a place that you get to on a train (always my favorite mode of transportation), where everyone is welcome.  My mother may or may not have met Paul Simon once. She moved to New York City sometime after high school and she once played frisbee in Central Park with someone who looked just like him. She asked if he was Paul Simon and he claimed to be his younger brother. I believe Simon & Garfunkle were still together at that point, so of course Central Park seems like the only place either of them could be. But I suppose it might really have been the younger Simon, or perhaps even just a look-alike.  I haven't made my mind up about heaven, but I'd like to go to Graceland. In the 20 or so years since I first remember hearing Graceland, I found out who Elvis Presley was. I have several records of his music, and I've heard countless covers at assorted rockabilly shows. I have Fit For A King, the Elvis Presley cookbook, and someday when my cholesterol is too low I might even try a few of the recipes. I love his rock and roll songs, but I really love his gospel music. I've never been to Tennessee.  But I'm afraid I might be disappointed if it turns out to be a real place.   *I didn't find out what a bungalow was until a few years later when I began devouring the Nancy Drew mystery stories. Interestingly, at that time I had never heard of Buffalo Bill either.

      Here is an entry for those of you who don't care/can't help with my computer traumas. (If you can help, though, I beg you to scroll down.) Of course, if you are Kirk, you disagree with everything I am about to say, so you might want to just keep scrolling or go away...  I am just loving  Wonder Falls.  I am not so very devoted to the Buffyverse that I've watched every show that involved  Buffy  alumni. I watched  Firefly  because Whedon's first two shows were pretty fine and because I liked the premise, and I was not disappointed. Well, not by the show - Fox made me see red over their treatment of the series. I never watched  Jake 2.0  because as much as I liked David Greenwalt, the show had two major strikes against it - it was on against  Angel  and its producers had failed to give my friend Sean a writing job (though that is just as well, because I love  Everwood , which he currently works for). I did watch Greenwalt's previous project,  Miracles  - see  Firefly , replace Fox with ABC. I haven't watched any of the made-for-TV movies starring assorted ex-cast members, because they were all on cable, which we don't have. I haven't watched  Miss Match , because Charisma Carpenter may be neat but I never did figure out when the show aired, and anyway I'm pretty sure it's on Fridays, which is not a good day of the week for me to remember to turn on the TV.  We missed at least two episodes of  Firefly , which aired on Friday nights, because we just forgot. I didn't catch the pilot of  Wonder Falls  because...well, I don't remember if we were out or just didn't remember it was on - that whole Friday thing - but it re-aired the following Thursday and we caught it and it was great.  The lead (Caroline something-or-other) is just so charismatic and believable. I don't feel for one second that she is some stereotype of my generation (the actress and I are almost exactly the same age, and I believe the character is meant to be about a year younger than me), and while I have the advantage of never having seen her in another role, I never remember that she is an actress while I am watching her.  The show is shot in Canada and it shows. Not specifically because it takes place on the "wrong" side of the falls, but because actors from  Nero Wolfe  keep showing up. This pleases me immensely.  I haven't recognized any of the writers' names yet, but they all write clever, snappy dialogue without making it seem unrealistic, and the plots have all been coherent and interesting so far. The absurdity of the premise becomes charming in the hands of the actors and writers. And I recognized a Minear-ism in this past week's dialogue - he has either influenced the writers or taken a pass at the scripts. Either way, I approve. So far,  Firefly 's "The Message" is the only Minear-penned script I've hated, and I think the blame for that one lies with Whedon.  This coming week's episode airs on Thursday, which either means that Fox is fucking around another show I love or trying to give it a better chance. Either way, I am going to try my damnedest to remember to watch it.

      I've been having a lot of difficulty lately. The primary problem is that when I have more than one program running, at least one of them will freak out on me and freeze up, telling me that there isn't enough memory. I have about 11gb free, which seems to me that it ought to be plenty - but on the other hand, I have a 40gb harddrive and I can't figure out where the other 29gb are tied up (in reality, it's more like 37 total with 26 tied up). So I tried to run the defragment thingy but it told me that it couldn't run because there is an error on the disc. Now, due to the programs freezing up thingy, I often have to force a restart, and I usually let ScanDisc run, but I followed the prompt from Defrag and told it (ScanDisc) to run a Thorough check rather than the usual Standard.   So I leave ScanDisc running and go downstairs to drink some coffee. I come back upstairs to check on it, and there is an error message that reads:  ScanDisc has restarted 10 times because Windows or another program is writing to this drive. Quitting some running programs may enable ScanDisc to finish sooner.  And then there was a prompt to keep receiving this message (or not), which I clicked OK on. So ScanDisc tells me it's "Checking File Allocation Tables," then "Checking folders," and keeps restarting. The folder check never gets past two bars of progress before it goes back to the file allocation tables. There are absolutely no programs running, so it can only be Windows itself that is the problem. So what do I do here? Is there a way to run ScanDisc (thorough) before Windows starts?  And while I am at it, can anyone tell me why my very own computer would tell me that I am not allowed to copy my files to CD and should contact the Administrator? Last time I checked,  that was me , useless though I may be. (Could the problem be that I have my computer password protected, so I am technically a sub-profile? I should check that, but it really seems nonsensical.)  I know that I should be calling Dell support with all these problems, but they've outsourced to Pakistan and I haven't gotten a single helpful suggestion from them since. I don't think it's worth being on hold for an hour and a half just to be told to use selective startup, no matter what the problem is. Useless fuckers. (Er, not  all  Pakistanis, just the ones answering the phones at Dell.)   *sigh*  One of these days I'm going to follow through on that threat to start a collection for a Mac.

      I found a $20 bill on the beach today. Yippee! We didn't run out of gas on the way home! (OK, so our finances weren't  that  bad, but I  did  use the money to put gas in the car.)  We've just dropped K off at the airport after a day spent primarily driving to and from the beach, with a ridiculously long detour to find a bathroom. It's a good thing we took the detour, too, because the beach was far more populated than I'm used to and I wouldn't have been able to do my usual  squat behind the dune and hope no one sees me  routine.  Have I mentioned yet how glad I am that the wedding shopping is done? I mean, realistically, we still have loads to do. But the clothing is taken care of except for the dreaded alterations on my dress. And I can't even begin to be bothered about that until the dress arrives, so I shan't. Of course, we still need clothes for Will, and flowers and cake and probably more junk than anyone could ever possibly need for one four-hour event, but nevermind. I'll think about it tomorrow. (Not literally - just having a Scarlet moment. I don't plan to think about it for days and days.)  I have thought of lots of stuff that I wish to post about, including the atrocity that is LA drivers; racial stereotypes; civil rights; and the fact that my hands itch like crazy and I can't figure out why. However, I am tired and I don't think I will do so tonight.

      K and I spent literally hours shopping yesterday. I am, to put it mildly, not a huge fan of the shopping. However, we accomplished what we set out to accomplish, and I will  never have to do it again.  Unless I decide that I don't like these shoes...  The little one was asleep on the couch before 9:00. I had been dead on my feet for hours at that point, and was perfectly happy to retire to our bedroom and let her sleep (though I did make her move upstairs to her bed, which is much better than our couch). I read for not more than half an hour before passing into a weird dream state. Frankly, it's a miracle that either of us even made it through dinner - I think only the fact that it was Thai take-away kept us going. YUM!  It is a perfectly lovely day. I plan to waste most of it sitting inside, cowering from the dreaded sun. I have a grudge against it at the moment for the giganto headache I walked away from Melrose with.

      Warning: Probably TMI.  It's funny how that could mean just about  anything , depending on context, but there is one thing that just about everyone associates with the phrase and nothing seems likely to change that.  So: it's that time of the month. Not unexpected, since I'm on the pill and now have Regularly Scheduled Bleeding times. I was actually quite "regular" (another phrase with a specific connotation, this time  not  what I mean) for most of my adult life, but I never remembered where I was in my cycle. Now I have little pills to tell me. Rather convenient, that. Plus, no unplanned babies, which I am  mostly  pleased about.  Yesterday, in what I can only assume was a fit of PMS-induced insanity, I had a Bridezilla moment. I am terribly disappointed, because I expected it to be fun when it eventually and inevitably occured, but it was just lame and embarrassing and guilt-causing.  The good news is that my dress is ordered and K's is in my closet, ready to go. Pictures to follow if I am able to fix the sudden and inexplicable weirdness of my computer.   [later...]   The following is an $800 ensemble that K tried on  before  we looked at the pricetag. It is stunning and absolutely perfect but there was just no way in hell. Click the thumbnail for a larger version.   urlLink     And here is the gorgeous outfit we wound up buying for her (the shoes are mine), same thumbnail dealio as before:   urlLink     Thank you for your time and indulgance. The next entry will, I promise, be non-wedding-related, though probably equally self-serving.

      My sister is arriving at LAX (boy-o, I hope it's LAX, as that is where I will be) in a little more than twelve hours. In the intervening time, I have to sleep, clean the kitchen, do two loads of laundry (well, at least towels, anyway), drink enough coffee to safely get me to the airport and back, possibly eat, and balance the checkbook. We went grocery shopping and although we bought only the basics, I'm just about certain that we've gone over. Damn it. (It should be noted that I am not entirely positive that our idea of "basic" is, in fact, basic.)  Though exhausting, cleaning was fun today. We listened to some great ska and punk music and just really dove in. I've been reorganizing and cleaning all week, so it is really a pretty thorough spring cleaning. I am expecting Ratty to show up any second. (Heh. I wonder what K would think if I called her Ratty all week.)  Darn. I wanted to clean the car before picking her up, but I just don't see that happening. I don't really care about washing the outside, though it should be done, but the inside  desperately  needs to be de-trashed and vacuumed and maybe have something done about the smell. Possibly an exorcism.  Lest anyone jump to conclusions, I have no illusions that I will fool my sister into thinking that the place is always this clean. Nor am I cleaning it for her, though the overhaul on the office was done to make it habitable, as she will sleep up here. She is just a very handy push toward something I've been meaning to do anyway but was otherwise too lazy to get started on.  I had a post in my head that involved complaints about several things as well as a few people, but I have decided not to bother. I may do it later, though. I am not very predictable.

      Last night, an unusual shift occurred. My sweet homebody fiance elected to attend our friend Chris's birthday party (at some hipster bar) without me, as I was too tired to get off the couch or out of my sweatpants. Usually I am the one pushing for us to  do stuff , but I was completely without interest, even though I do like Chris a whole lot. I didn't even mind going to bed alone, which usually I hate. Of course, I was pleased when Will came home, but still - I think it is quite impressive that we were able to do separate stuff, even if only for about two hours (and even if mine was primarily sleep).  I cleaned our home office over the past week. I did a really terrific job, completed (for the most part) yesterday with a thorough vacuuming. I still have to find places to put a few things, and I just discovered that when I dusted the computer (scrubbed, more like), I forgot to clean the keyboard. It is yucky. Would anyone like to buy me some nice filing cabinets? We have this stack of Office Depot boxes next to the desk, full of files, and piles of papers and stuff pretty much everywhere. It is disgraceful. (Note: I don't actually expect anyone to buy me anything. I just like the idea.)  I'm working on a grocery list. I'm trying to keep the spending down, because now that I am keeping the bank balance in order (I'm using the register and everything), it would be very embarrassing to go into overdraft again. Of course, it was pretty embarrassing before, when it happened (more often than I like), but now it will be apparent right there in my own handwriting, rather than on those imposing bank statements that are not my doing.  I should get a waterproof tape recorder. Surely they make them. I tend to have ideas for stories while I am in the shower with no means of writing them down. And of course they aren't abstract ideas, they are actual line-for-line stories that never quite make it to paper (though yesterday's has been transcribed and I am fairly pleased with it so far).  I have to pee. When Will wakes up I have to clean the rest of the house in preparation for my sister's visit. I doubt that she'd think less of us if the house was messy (and I already cleaned the office, which is where she'll be sleeping), but it needs to be cleaned anyway, and I am grateful for the push.

      In honor of the occasion, I made fishnchips for dinner last night. I also decided that it was only one word, but that is beside the point. Will said that mine were even better than the Cat & Fiddle's, though he had told me moments earlier that the food there was really good, so I don't know what to believe.  Except  - he took the massive leftovers to work today and gave half to his Limey co-worker Lara (who I am half in love with, by the way), and she said they were terrific, so I guess I can take her word.  In wedding news, I called a hotel today to try to reserve a block of rooms for the eight million out-of-town guests. I talked to two people and one voicemail and don't feel like I got anywhere at all, but at least I made the call. I can now go back to ignoring the planning stuff, at least until next week when my sister is here and we go clothes shopping. I am dreading the shoes.  I am now going to rearrange the bookshelves and dust in avoidance of laundry and job-searching. It's amazing the lengths I'll go to.  In other news, MSN messenger is being an asshat so I have signed onto be AIM and Yahoo to compensate. It isn't helping, because neither tells me when I have new mail on MSN.

      I am not Irish, though I've had a little Irish in me (wink, wink). So I wasn't sure if I'd make a St. Patrick's Day-related post. That all changed when Will called to tell me that his lunch meeting had been changed from an Armenian restaurant to the Cat & Fiddle. He checked online to see what the reviews were like, having never been there. This one caught his eye:  User Rating: Below Average    if you like bad food/wrm beer-it rocks Posted by johnny69 on 02/05/2003  this place sucks...warm beer and bland food, but if you like that, you are in!  Dear Johnny69,  You are a moron. Guinness is supposed to be served at approximately 58&#176;, which is probably a bit warm to your retarded Hollywood sensibilities. Fish and chips are a bland food - that is what the malt vinegar is for.  I suggest that if you are so free of culture that you don't know what an Irish pub is supposed to be like, you stay the fuck away and let the people who appreciate that sort of thing enjoy it.  Yours, Disgusted By Your Ignorance

      Everyone knows that Sydney belongs with Agent Weiss. He's my favorite! And now I have figured out what to do with stoopid old Vaughn, since the powers that be chose  not  to kill him off,  again , much to Will's chagrin. (Er, that's  my  Will, not the one from  Alias  who actually made the show worth watching. Though he may have been disappointed as well.)  I would like to announce my new position as what may be the world's first  Vaughn/Sark shipper .  Thank you for your time.

      I was pretty pissed off when  Nero Wolfe  got cancelled. I was pretty happy last year when they released the first season on DVD, even though we didn't (and still don't) have the money to purchase it.  But  now  - now! - A&E has season 2 available for pre-order. This is the best news ever! Someday when we have disposable income again we can have every episode of the best show ever available at our fingertips.  Neither season is available at Amazon, which has lowered my opinion of them somewhat, but season 1 is available at deepdiscountdvd.com for one-third the price that A&E is asking, and I imagine they will offer season 2 as well. It will be out with plenty of time to spare for my birthday.

      The conclusion to  Six Years Ago Today , posted late, backdated, and with love.  Part 1 is  urlLink here , part 2  urlLink here .  I could tell you about the intervening time. How we didn't see each other for three days and were both embarrassed and unsure and he had to get very drunk to come over and asked me to spend the night again. How we kept it a secret from our friends. How I kissed him right before his cue at a cabaret so he'd have to go onstage with lipstick on his face. How we started sleeping together in a way that involved more than sleep. How we watched  Lonesome Dove . I could tell you all of that. I could tell you the exact dates and approximate times of day. It doesn't matter.  On Friday, March 13, 1998 I walked down the back steps of West dormitory in an old full-length wine-colored velvet dress. I wore new shoes, a borrowed shawl, and a blue garter. I was "given away" by my friend Craig, who has since passed away. Waiting at the stump where we drank our morning coffee and our evening beers was Will, in a white linen suit. Adam, a minister of the Universal Life Church, read vows that we'd written ourselves. They were terribly silly. Someone had a video camera. Will put a ring on my finger. I put one on his. The combined value of the rings was under two dollars. His was the ugliest one I'd been able to find. My hands were shaking.  After the ceremony I threw my "bouquet" (a black silk rose) and garter, and then we ate tiramisu that Craig had made for us. We'd forgotten plates and forks and made a terrific mess. That night there was a dance in the community space (technically called the Dance Space but I'll be damned if I'm going to say that outside of a parenthetical) and the coordinator gave us free passes. On the walk over Will stopped me and told me he loved me.  That seems like a pretty good place to end the story. The post script is about how we signed the certificate but never sent it to the courthouse. It's valid for 30 days after signing, which means that for 30 days we were legally married but after those 30 days we had never been married.

        You are Marcie!    urlLink   Which Peanuts Character are You?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    I had to post this because I named my third car after Marcie. I spelled it Marcy, though, for a specific reason that I cannot remember. Her full name was Marcy Eileen June Solo. It's a lot of name for a car. Marcy I explained already. Eileen was for "Come on, Eileen," which I used to say to the car on hills. It turned out that the problem was a clogged fuel filter, which caused the accelerator to slip. June was for my best friend, and Solo was for Han because she was my Millennium Falcon. What? It was the year they released the stupid new Star Wars movies. You know, the original three with the unnecessary add-ons. I loved it because I got to see them in the theater. I wasn't even born when the first one came out.  I abandoned Marcy in the Antioch student parking lot after blowing the head gasket. She was not worth the $1000 repair bill. She had some great stickers on her, though. My favorite was green and said "Visualize Whirled Peas."

      I am so very tired. Standing up all day hunched over STUPID FUCKING COOKIES does not do anything good for the neck and shoulders. On the other hand, I got my karmic payback for all that whining about wanting a dog. I had to decorate 150 dog-shaped cookies. To look like a  specific dog.  I do not jest. I had help, but it was still a crappy thing to have to do.  In entirely unrelated news,  The Return of the King  will be released on DVD May 25th. I have not yet seen a release date for the extended edition.  If I had $459 I could fly to Frankfurt.  Other than the dog cookies, work was fine. Afterwards we went out for a drink and some Japanese barbeque.  I have just taken a scalding hot shower and plan to do absolutely nothing that requires thinking or moving for the rest of the night.

      You remember how I said that Will's parents have a tendancy to steamroll us? (I might not have actually said it  here , now that I think about it.) His mom did it to me today, and I am extremely ashamed of my inability to handle the situation. You remember  urlLink Franny , Will's mom's boss that we are not talking to?  Will's mom called me today from work because they are having yet another problem with a factory in China. This time, the factory has told them that by Califonia law, stores cannot sell ceramics with decals on them. This sounds absurd to me, as most coffee mugs with designs on them are decal, not glaze. Anyway, it's got something to do with Proposition 65, which prohibits lead in drinking water and all sorts of other dangerous substances, including cadmium, which is apparently in the decals used on ceramics.  What the hell does this have to do with me? She wants me to find out if stores in LA sell ceramics with decals. I am going to keep right on typing ceramics with decals every time I mention ceramics with decals, because it is that ridiculous. She wanted me to call Pier One, because apparently she can't do that herself. I won't do that, but I offered ( I don't know why ) to stop in at a local store and look at the ceramics, to see if any of them had decals. I deduced all by myself that they would have to be ceramics for the purpose of eating or drinking, as ceramics with decals that were made for decorative purposes would almost certainly be excempt from this particular law. I tried to suggest that she just read the law in question, but apparently it is too long and complicated. Isn't that her job? So I did a search for it online, but for some reason I can't read PDF files, even though I could last week. I even tried to reinstall Adobe Reader. I AM NOT GETTING PAID TO WORK FOR THESE FREAKS! I can't imagine why I agreed to help. Much like Franny's phone call in September, I was too baffled to react appropriately.  So now I am stuck looking for ceramics with decals when all I want to do is finish the laundry and watch some  Buffy . After a long break from season 5, I am up to  The Body , which I can surely only handle watching if I do housework at the same time.  Anyway, I'm going to do it (not right this minute or anything, though - probably tomorrow), but then I have to figure out a way to ask her to NEVER GET ME INVOLVED WITH HER PETTY WORK PROBLEMS AGAIN - but nicely, because I am stuck with her forever.  I am so grumpy. Please send pie.

      On Tuesday I got mail from The Nature Conservancy asking me for money to help save the darling little endangered leopards. Yesterday I got mail from the HRC asking me for money to help save the darling little endangered civil rights of gay people. I love leopards (and I love gay people  almost  as much as leopards), but I don't have any money, so I threw away the letters.  Both organizations sent me, along with their pleas for money, "Free Personalized Address Labels!" The ones from the nature people had a really ugly bird on them, and the ones from the gay folks just had a logo (it's stripey).  I kept those.  Now. The way I figure it, the gay folks might care about the environment, and the nature people might care about gay rights (especially if there are gay leopards), but neither of them has the other as their main focus. So it is understandable that the HRC would send me an overweight letter full of paper. But I really don't understand why the nature people would. In order for endangered species to survive, they need habitats, and for most North American animals, this involves trees. The nature people must have killed two or three trees just to send my letter! I find that terribly irresponsible of them. What are the sweet little baby leopards going to climb up after I save their sweet little endangered lives? My letter? I doubt it, as it's unlikely that they'd fit in my wastepaper basket. Plus,  no pets allowed.  I'll have to double-check the lease, but I'm sure that includes endangered species.  And now I am worried that if I should happen to send any letters and use those return address labels, the recipients will assume that I have given money to these careless, tree-killing organizations. Of course, they will only be able to worry about that if they don't drop dead from the shock of getting a letter from me, so I suppose I have very little to worry about.

      Our most frequent sales calls are from resorts. Always in San Diego. Always asking me to join them for some grand opening or another and offering me a free stay or complimentary airfare in exchange. There really isn't a convenient time for this sort of call, but I do think dinner time is particularly rude, even if I am not actually eating yet. (As a matter of fact, I haven't even started cooking yet and have no idea what I am going to make, but that does not change my point.) Also, I AM ON THE DO-NOT-CALL LIST!!! Apparently it doesn't count if you aren't actually trying to  sell  me something. I don't know, maybe it does. I should look into that. I don't even know if the DNC list is active, and if it is I don't know if it is working for us because we rarely ever got anything but calls from these (probably mythical) resorts.  And you know what's really annoying? If there were some way that I could  know  that it really was free and on the level, I would totally go to a resort. Even if it sucked, it would be free.

      First, the bad news: I have not been doing very well with my self-imposed job search. I have become completely wrapped up in the redesign of my website and am using the (entirely reasonable) excuse that it will look good on my resume. Sure, it is only basic html, but I think I am using it quite well.  The good news is that Elka called me out of the blue just now. She is the executive chef I worked for at the catering company. I never actually  stopped  working there, I just sort of  stopped working there.  I was always a back-up, so I assumed that they just didn't need me after the holiday rush. She only asked me to work two nights, and the pay is crap, but money is money and very welcome nonetheless. Besides, I like Elka and it will be nice to see her.  And , I can find out how serious she was when she offered to cater the wedding, since it is about time for me to be shopping around and figuring that out.  I really don't want to do catering for a living unless I am making a far better wage than I get at this particular kitchen. Even then I am not sure I could do it full time. The hours tend to be inconvenient, especially with no transportation of my own. I don't like standing up constantly. I don't like the pastry chef yelling at me. (OK, being yelled at by Marta is kind of funny.) And washing my hands six hundred times a day is not high up on my list of things I want to do in the workplace. I have really dry skin!  What I ought to be doing is sitting at a nice cushy reception desk. I realize that doesn't sound very ambitious, but that is the point. I want a job that does not come home with me and holds little emotional significance.

      I am really not a breakfast person. Most days, breakfast for me is coffee. Sometimes on weekends I will wake up and feel like breakfast, and on those occasions I will make  everything *, but I would tend toward calling that brunch. I have no idea why.  Lately I have had to eat breakfast, because I am on a medication that has to be taken twice a day, with food. Trust me, I forgot it once and took it not even an hour after dinner, and it made me feel icky. So, food it is. I suppose I could take it with lunch and dinner, but sometimes I don't eat lunch until 4:00 in the afternoon, so breakfast seems smarter.  I love breakfast foods, but I rarely feel like eating them in the morning. So this recent morning meal trend has consisted largely of toast, which is good but a little boring.  *Everything generally consists of eggs, potatoes, meat, biscuits**, and sometimes beans, as well as the obligatory coffee. **The American kind, often substituted with tortillas or even toast.

      I neglected to mention the reason that I've spent so much time looking at puppies in the last couple of days. We saw  Secondhand Lions  on Sunday, and just loved it. I highly, highly recommend renting it. I have not yet seen the special features, which are on a second disk (we got the first one only from Netflix), but I hear they're great, too.  The movie features a pack of dogs and a pig that run around together, being adorable. Most of them were either mutts or breeds I am not familiar with. One was an adorable little Bulldog-like creature; I asked Will what it was, he suggested French Bulldog, and there you go.  In other news, it turns out that I am very good with html if I start from scratch. While I remain incapable of fixing my blog template, I have completely redesigned several pages of my website. (The redesigned pages are not online, so don't bother looking yet.) I deserve cake! Alas, I already ate it all. I  guess  I could make more, but that sounds an awful lot like work.

I will eat cake in her honor. CAKE IN HER HONOR!  In other news, I just cannot wrap my head around the fact that a Shar-Pei is not a teensy, fit-in-your-purse dog. It  sounds  bitty! I have never understood this and am surprised every time I see a photo, because my brain forgets that which it does not understand. Granted, they aren't exactly enormous either, but 50 pounds would not fit in my purse. (For reference, I should mention that I doubt I could even fit a Chihuahua in my purse.)  I have to stop talking abut dogs, because it is depressing Will. I guess I will start obsessing over real estate and job searching. Whee.

      I've been looking at pictures of different dog breeds all evening. Even Will got bored of it. Of course, since he likes dogs even more than I do, I suspect that he stopped looking out of a sense of self-preservation. We cannot have pets in this apartment, nor would I bring a large dog here if we could. And we are really large dog people. Unless we adopt a French Bulldog. They are really adorable.  My plan for us to buy a house will take about two and a half years, plus the time for me to find an income that will sustain the savings plan I made. I am not certain I can wait that long for home or companion. Maybe I ought to start looking into rental homes. In the northeast, I remember seeing many houses for rent with option to buy. I haven't seen anything of the sort here, but I haven't exactly been looking for that specifically. It would really be ideal, as (in my understanding) a percentage of the rent would go toward purchase in the event that we chose to do so.  I'll get right on that. Just as soon as I've taken a little nap.  p.s. Dear Santa, my current favorite is the Dogo Argentino. Just, you know, in case.

      Apparently Martha Stewart was found guilty of all charges (obviously not counting the major one which was dropped last week). I haven't read any details, but I am oddly disappointed. I mean, if she's guilty, she's guilty - but I really like her, in an obscure sort of way.   Cold hands, warm heart?   Will insists that this is the case. I say he is really reaching. When I got out of the shower, he put his hands on my waist and I actually screamed, they were so cold.  Jenn's going to bring over her tape of this week's  Angel  later. I guess this means I can stop avoiding on-topic WD posts. Then again, I'm feeling a little bit burned out on the internet (my uncooperative computer is not helping matters), so I may take a little bit of a break. Of course, it's  me , so that's probably not going to happen.  I have to pee. (I am thinking of ending all of my blog entries with unnecessary information from now on.)

      My friend Henry called me this afternoon and said he was coming over to switch around the hinges on our refrigerator door. I love having friends who will notice that you never got around to doing something and have been going to extra trouble every day because of it and will just do it for you. I have no idea why I never switched the hinges. I've done it before (to a different fridge) and the current one even came with instructions for that very task, but here it is a year after we bought the machine and the doors still opened the wrong way.  While Henry was doing the "manly" part of the job - you know, with tools and everything - I obsessively cleaned the outside of the fridge. Surprise! It's actually  white . I had no idea. OK, it wasn't really that bad, but living next to the stove it gets a lot of grease splattered on it. Also, the top was covered in that lovely layer of greasy dust that seems to settle on anything in the kitchen if you let it go for more than a week. I do wipe the top down rather frequently, but since I am shorter than the refrigerator it can go a while without my noticing.  Then Henry left and I set about the task I had actually been procrastinating at the very time that he called: cleaning out the inside of the fridge. There was some old food that had to go, and I wanted to clean out the compartments on the door and the shelves and everything. I noticed when I took out the shelves, which are made of glass or a reasonable facsimile, that they say "spill-proof" on them. Now, I am no expert, but they were covered in what looked very much like spills to me. Also, they were fogged up, which made me laugh like a lunatic and then laugh even harder when I realized that  of course  they'd fogged up once I removed them from the colder climate and put them in the sink. And I  know  that they probably mean that the shelves won't allow spills to leak down onto the  other  shelves, but really. When it says spill-proof I expect  no spills.   I didn't bother cleaning out the drawers. That would have meant admitting to myself that I have once again let produce go bad, which makes me rather depressed.

      Google owns Blogger, right? (Right.) And while Blogger does not offer built-in comments, surely they are aware that people install them on their own. I think that they even provide suggestions for commenting systems.  Google provides the Google Toolbar, which includes BlogThis! and a pop-up blocker. I love my pop-up blocker. I have it set to allow pop-ups on Buffyguide  only , which means that I don't get very many pop-ups.  Today, a weird thing happened. My pop-up blocker started blocking comments on Blog*Spot blogs. Blog*Spot being, of course, the free Blogger host. This has  never  happened before. It isn't a pop-up! I have to manually tell the page that I want the comments to, well, pop up. Is it a JavaScript thing? Is it me? It's all right, you can tell me if it is.   *cries*

      In fact, it's dreadfully funny and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Ben and Owen have terrific chemistry, which I think everyone knows already, and they managed to make the characters their own while still playing them completely straight. Vince Vaughn was  terrific  as the bad guy, and Jason Bateman (Batman?) was unrecognizable as his sidekick. I didn't even hate Juliette Lewis, who I normally loathe. I loved Snoop Dogg too. I doubt that I could ever be so absorbed by a performance of his that I'd forget it was Snoop, but he was very good.  My only complaint is the scene you've all probably seen in the trailers where Ben takes on the "Do it" guy's identity as a disguise. The only reason this bothered me is that I don't find the "Do it" guy funny. However, the set-up for the scene is very funny, and of course Hutch makes fun of Starsky's disguise, so it's fine.  I don't want to give too much away  or  to seem as though I'm just plugging the movie because of my connections to it, but I do think it's worth seeing. It isn't as funny or clever as  Dodgeball , so if you're only going to see one movie this year on my recommendation, wait. However, if you just want an hour and a half of fun, go see  Starsky & Hutch.  I'd pay for it if I hadn't gotten to go for free.

      No, not the movie. (I liked it.) Just that so often I see blog entries by other people containing "10 Things About Me" or "10 things you never wanted to know about me" or, of course, the dreaded "100 things" that so many people do. Anyway, I thought I'd make some sort of list myself. And as soon as I thought "10 Things," my brain added on the rest of the movie title. So there you go.   There are photographs of me on a naughty website. I don't actually have copies of the pictures - anyone who feels like paying for a membership to the website, let me know. It's mostly lesbian stuff.  I attended school for a total of six years. Fourth grade through eighth grade and one year of college. The rest of my education has been self-led. (For the irrepressibly curious: Fourth, fifth and sixth grade were at the Woodstock Elementary School; Seventh was at the Onteora Junior High; eight was at Columbus Academy, a magnet school in Manhattan; college was Antioch.)  I would like to get a Master's Degree but have no intention of finishing a Bachelor's first. I have never been turned down for a job because of my education (or "lack" thereof). I think I would study Library Sciences or Film History if I were to attend a graduate program.  My dream job is to write a regular column for a magazine or newspaper. My preferred topics would be home life or entertainment (duh).  My dream  career  is to own a production company and develop film and television.  The movie version of  Watership Down  gave me nightmares for years. I have never had any interest in reading the book, even though I own it. I saw the movie when I was six. My (adult) friend Michael asked me what movie I'd like him to rent for me (we had no television) and I asked for  The Black Stallion , my favorite movie on earth (at the time). The video rental place didn't have it and recommended the evil, scary cartoon. It's been twenty years and I am still terrified of it.  I haven't seen Michael since I was seven, and I still miss him. I know where he is (he's got a website), but I don't know if I want to contact him. Once he called me (again, I was about six) and when we got off the phone he wished me "sweet dreams." I dreamed about horses running through a field; I have never had a sweeter dream. I think perhaps I would rather keep my memories than know him now.  I went through my parents' divorce at age nine (and 10 and 11 - it was ugly) and although I dealt with it very well, it has made me fiercely pro-marriage. I will never get a divorce.  I am eating pretzels.  I have strange social anxieties. I crave human contact but feel very insecure when it is not on my terms. Large groups reduce me to silence. If I go to a party with someone, I stay very close to that person the entire time, even if I enjoy the company of the other people in attendance. I am better at written or telephone interaction than face-to-face.

      Will and I watched  The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen  last night. I was very excited to come online today and trash it. The problem? I didn't hate it. I even kind of liked it.  Now. It is  not  the movie I would have made. For one thing, I would have essentially filmed the comic. And even if I were making the story they made, I would have changed the pacing quite a bit, among other things. And the special effects were all over the place - the Jeckyll/Hyde stuff was phenomenal, the Nautilus and other scientific equipment quite disappointing. But all in all, I liked it.  I am deeply ashamed.

      I voted. For Dean. I know it's a "wasted" vote, but with him out of the race I will be equally satisfied with Kerry or Edwards (though Edwards is better looking), so I voted the way I wanted to, results be damned.  I am feeling deliciously irresponsible right now.

      Today is Big Tuesday, or Splendid Tuesday, or Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious Tuesday, or something. A bunch of states, including the one I live in, are voting in the Democratic Primary election  right now.  My state (California) is also voting on four propositions, all of which strike me as  terrible  ideas.  Now. I'm not a registered Democrat; because I don't like either party, I registered Undeclared. However, I can vote on the Democratic ballot if I request it. Of course, my plan to request it sort of centered around the fact that I was crazy about Howard Dean, who dropped out. So I am tempted not to vote at all. When Will said goodbye to me this morning, after bringing me a glass of water, he said he was off to vote and he looked unhappy about it (he really doesn't follow politics, lucky bastard), so I told him not to. If he doesn't care about the propositions or the local elections (even I don't care a fig about the local elections), and the Democratic hopefuls are all the same to him, I don't think he ought to (have to) vote.  I do think that  I  ought to vote, but I really don't feel like walking to my polling place. It's about twice as far away as the place where we voted in October (against the recall, thank you very much). I am lazy and out of shape and bitter about Dean.  Grrr. I'll let you all know what I decide to do. And I have lots more to say about the Oscars, which I may or may not get around to saying later today.

      I've only seen  The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King  once. I keep meaning to go back a second time and chickening out for a variety of reasons, including laziness and a lack of interest in crying for four straight hours again. The only time I can recall ever crying as hard as I did after seeing that movie was about four and a half years ago, right after my cat who I'd had since the age of five died. I am still not sure if I was crying over the cat or not, much like I am uncertain of what, exactly, it was about  Return of the King  that hit me so hard. Heroism in the face of impossible odds, I suppose. Beauty. See? I don't know.  On Saturday evening and again on Sunday I emphatically announced that I would be happy if ROTK's only award was for Best Director. Peter Jackson deserved that award more than anyone has ever deserved it. Well, that isn't true, but he  really  deserved it. A lot of folks have been going around saying that Best Picture was sort of a token for all three films. I think that Best Director is that, only more.  Roundabout the second award that the movie picked up, I turned to Will and said, "They're going to sweep." By the third award, I was loudly lamenting the fact that I hadn't entered any Oscar Pools, because ever single award was going the way I thought it would. Granted, it was a fairly predictable year, but still...  When the song from  The Triplets of Belleview  was performed, I whispered that I hoped it would win. When Annie Lenox and Howard Shore and darling Fran Walsh were announced winners, I whispered again that I didn't care which song was better, I'd  really  wanted them to win.  I must wholeheartedly agree with whichever Hobbit-lad it was who suggested that the Academy ought to adopt an award for Ensemble Cast. I could not in all honesty have chosen any single Supporting Actor from the group, though Sean Astin stands out a bit. If you ask me (and you don't have to - my blog!) Samwise is the hero of the story. Frodo may be the ringbearer, but Sam is the hero.  When I predicted a sweep, I impressed Will by telling him that such an event would tie the picture with  Ben Hur  and  Titanic  for the most Oscars. (Frankly, I thought everyone knew that.) When the ceremony was over, I decided to check out whether any other films had ever won every single award they were nominated for. Two have, but each for a 'mere' nine awards -  Gigi  and  The Last Emperor .  In addition to tying/breaking those records, it is only the second picture ever to bring in over a billion dollars in worldwide box office. I am somewhat skeptical of that "honor," though, as it does not take inflation into account.  If I am not mistaken, the Oscar for Art Direction went to  The Lord of the Rings  all three years.  ...Oopsie, no it didn't.  Chicago  beat  The Two Towers  and  Moulin Rouge  beat  The Fellowship of the Ring.  I was thinking of Visual Effects.  I lost my train of thought.  In totally unrelated news, I can't  believe  that  Gunga Din  wasn't nominated for a single award. I'm so shocked that I actually just checked to make sure it really was released in the year I thought it was (1939, which it was). Of course, I'm wrong once again - it was nominated for Best Cinematography, Black and White.  Now I've  really  lost my train of thought. I had lots of stuff to say about how anti-Oscar I've always been, and why I'm not a gigantic hypocrite for allowing this year to matter to me so much, but I don't know. I think I'm done for now.

      I have decided to marry Will  and  Darren. We are still hashing out the details, as I am actually anti-polygamy. Wait, that's not entirely fair. I am fiercely pro-monogamy. I don't have a decisive stance on polygamy.  This is turning into a serious post! That's no good.  My boys are downstairs, drunk. Or at least, they are drink ing . And talking. And talking, and talking... I've totally lost track of what they're talking  about  - it went from  From Hell  and  The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen  to Mary Shelley to Mark Twain to Jenny Sparks and Deadlands faster than I could keep up. And that is in the last three minutes.  Heeeeee. I am in heaven.

      I've lived in this neighborhood for over a year. I know where the grocery store(s), post office and library are. But I have just realized that I have NO idea where the nearest police or fire station is, and I don't know which hospital is the closest. (Oh, let's be honest, I only know where one hospital is in the whole city, and only because it's next to my doctor's office.)  I guess I'd better not have any emergencies.

      I went downstairs to put my laundry in the dryer. There was a boy there, putting his into the washer. Ten years ago I would have thought he was  soooo  cute, but now I definitely don't. Tall, a little too skinny - should possibly be modeling Calvin Klein jeans. You know the type.  He seemed to be attempting to strike up a conversation. Either he finds girls in laundry day clothes with unwashed faces attractive or he really needed the spare quarter I gave him. Heck, he might have just been lonely. He asked if I'd just moved in, and I told him I'd been here for over a year. So then he asked me if I'm a hermit, because he hasn't "Seen me around." Er...how does one respond to such a question? And why the hell would I hang out  in  the building but  not  in my apartment? And why do I give a crap that he sold his car to some guy who didn't even test drive it?  I feel so mean, except I'm not, because he was so very obviously trying (poorly) to flirt. Am I wrong to think he's a total tool?  As a reminder, here is a picture of my left hand:        I suppose I should have gone for something less subtle, eh? (Please see the image to the right for reference.) I don't like it, but it's more obvious.  Now, seriously: Is it not obvious that I am wearing an engagement ring? Even if this guy wasn't flirting at all, I've gotten that flirtatious vibe from a couple of people over the last six months. Don't they  get  it?

      When I met Will, he was still actively involved in theater. He had one of the leads in a production of  Mad Forest , which is a weird fucking play. I've done some theater, but stopped being serious about it around age 12. I'd done one play in school, the semester before I met Will, and actually had a lead (which isn't saying much as it was a three person one-act with a single performance), but it just wasn't a big deal.  On the opening night of  Mad Forest , I had stage fright. Really bad stage fright. I must have known at that point that I was head-over-heels in love with Will. In fact, I know I knew. But if I hadn't, I think having stage fright on his behalf would have done the trick.  Right now he's recording voice-over for the  Lost Boys  Special Edition DVD (for a segment on Vampires of the World). I dropped him off at a recording studio across the way from the Warner Brothers lot. By the way, should you ever have reason to be in this building, make sure you know the gate code. You need it to get out as well. Motherfuckers.  I think I need a stiff drink. Unfortunately, I can't, because I have appointments this afternoon for wedding-related stuff, and while I have no problem showing up half in the bag, I'd have no way to get myself there. My DUI days* are long past.  Speaking of wedding crap, I should have a very amusing entry for you in the coming days.   *Oh, chill out. I only drove drunk  once , and I had NO idea how drunk I was until an hour or so later.

      Will and I spent all day yesterday playing. We had plans with Rich that fell through. I must say, as sad as we both were to not see Rich, it was something of a relief, as we'd been social all weekend.  We started out the day with Charades. It got off to a bumpy start as we were trying to remember some of the important gestures and whatnot. Will is really good at it, and I am OK. I really stumped him on a few, though. I would love to try playing with a larger group of people, but some of the shorthand clues that we devised would be totally inappropriate. (Let's just say that we came up with a sort of shorthand for "man" that will not be used in front of ANYONE.)  Later in the day we went grocery shopping and then picked up Chinese take-away. The drive home was  torture , because we were so hungry and the food smelled so good. We needed a distraction, but Charades was out as Will was busy driving, so we tried this word game that Will overheard some guys playing when we saw  Hellboy . We don't know if it has a name, and are calling it "Predator vs. Nell" until we come up with something better. You describe a movie that is actually a hybrid of two movies, and the other person guesses the combined titles. My crowing achievement came with the clue "Keanu Reeves stars as an Enlightened man who has wacky adventures in China with talking animals." The correct answer is, of course, "Doctor Doolittle Buddha." That game was harder for me as nearly every time I came up with a great movie title it turned out that I knew absolutely nothing about one of the two movies (except obviously its name). My other favorite was "Jack Black co-stars in this World War II epic as a man who has to save his best friend, whose brothers have all been killed, from marrying a woman everyone hates." That one is a little trickier as the titles don't run together in the same way. See if you can guess.

      I have a lot to say about them. I won't be saying it at the moment, but please read  urlLink this  as a starter.  Please pay special attention to Matty's comment, excerpted here:  My big problem with comic book movies is that there is no excuse for them to be bad. The source material is already storyboarded out right there for you in great detail. JUST MAKE THAT. We like that! That's why you're making the cocksucker in the first place!

      I'd taken off my shirt and was washing my face. We went out tonight and I decided, in a rather out of character move, to wear makeup. When I wear makeup, I break out, so I try to wash it off as quickly as possible, and tend to do so in an apologetic way. I splash warm water on my face, then soap it up, then rinse. Then I soap up again and scrub with a washcloth. Then, if I wore mascara, I use eye makeup remover, then rinse off with the washcloth. Then I pat dry and apply moisturizer.  So I was standing there, in my jeans and bra. My fat little belly was hanging over the waistband of my jeans. I'm pretty skinny, but there is nothing even resembling muscle tone anywhere on my body.  Will was sitting on the toilet. Not using it as anything but a seat, just sitting there, watching me.  I asked him why.  He admired the way my breasts looked - larger than usual, but held in by my bra. He commented on my belly. He wondered if he would find it attractive if we had just met and this was the first time I'd had my shirt off in his presence. Before I could figure out what I thought about that, he decided that  now , it is sexy. Because I am his wife (I argued that one). Because I am going to be the mother of his children (I glowed and blushed). Just because.  It's pointless, it's private. I just didn't want to forget.

      Thank god.  If I consume any more sugar, ever, somebody shoot me. I had a tummy-ache last night and have a rousing headache today, and I blame my willy-nilly consumption of jelly beans, chocolate chips and maple syrup (not all at  once ) entirely.  I tried to take a nap but my back is sore as well and I couldn't get comfy.  I know a bath would fix it but I tend to get light-headed from the heat if I am already feeling poorly, so I can't do that until Will gets home. Alas, when Will gets home we are going to a friend's house. No bath for me.  And of course I am sitting here feeling sorry for myself when poor  urlLink Marsh  is having a ten billion times worse day. Everyone throw cake at her. Er, or something like that.

      [MAJOR casting spoilers for the end of  Angel , don't know which episides, shown on last night's preview. NOT next week.]  So. Darla and Drusilla. I hope that the WB is being misleading as usual, because if I have to suffer through endless flashbacks of what Angelus and Spike/William used to be, I will puke. It got really, really old after  Fool For Love/Darla , with rare exception. If these girls come back, I want them in the present time. OK, not Darla, but Dru is still with us, right? And they've totally erased all the progress that was made in season 2 anyway, so why not bring Darla back,  again , and do away with the good parts of season 3 as well. By the end there, I really liked her.  [/spoiler]  ARRRGGGHHHHHH.

      Honestly,  American Idol  was more entertaining, and I  hate  that show. Well, I particularly hate Ryan Seacrest. I mean, "Seacrest?" What the fuck kind of name is that? Anyway, we watched it tonight because Jenn left a message that "The Chin" was guest judging, and I had to make sure she meant QT, on the off chance that maybe she meant Bruuuuuce, which she didn't, but by then the TV was already on, and could I  make  this sentence go on for any longer?

      I haven't actually done the math, but I believe I was on the telephone for over five hours today. My ears hurt! Most of it was a single conversation, with Stacey. I would write about that, but she and I joked that I would, so I'm fresh out of material. It would feel unoriginal, I think. I also talked to Will, which is not an unusual occurrence, but his  urlLink reason  for calling me was. I also talked to Jenn.  Needless to say, though all of these chats were lovely, I am never answering the telephone again.  While Stacey and I talked (and talked and talked), I cleaned the bathroom. I also put a pork loin in to roast (and roast and roast). If all goes according to plan, will be pulled pork when it's finished. If you don't know what that is, you have presumably never been to the south. That's OK. I haven't really either. Anyway, it's been in the oven for nearly three hours now, and the place smells delightful.  I might vacuum in a little while, and clean the kitchen floor and wash the dishes. Then again, I might not. I'm feeling pretty accomplished already.

      I'm covered in scars. Most of them aren't even visible unless the lighting is just right and I am pointing right at it saying, "There! Don't you see it?"  The most visible marks are from chicken pox, when I was nine. There's one next to my eyebrow, one on my tit, one on my belly, and probably a bunch more. I'm fairly certain there's one in my, ah, groin area, but I'd have to shave completely to find it, and I have no interest in having a naked hoo-ha.  I have two razor scars: one on my ankle from the second time I ever shaved my legs and one on my finger tip from a bad experience changing a blade, both at around age 12.  There should be a scar on my palm from the time that I hung my jacket on the top row of wrought iron hooks and my hand slid down onto the hook below it, but I can't identify it. My palms are covered with lines and I don't know what's natural and what's a scar. (It also happened when I was about 11, so it might just be gone.)  I have a scar on my knee from falling down while running and sliding several feet. To my credit, I kept running (I fell, slid and got up all in one motion - it was pretty cool), leapt over a bench, and tackled the boy I was chasing. I didn't even know I was injured until it was pointed out that my pants were ripped. It did that weird thing where it didn't start bleeding right away even though several layers of skin were lost to the pavement, and when it did start it was tiny pin-pricks of blood. I was about 15.  My arms are covered in marks. I suppose if you didn't know me and were unfamiliar with how different types of injuries heal/scar, you might think I was a self-injurer. I'm not, at least by conventional definition. The scars are all burns. Accidental burns. Some are from splattered cooking oil, but most of them are from ovens. I have a matching set on my right arm from oven racks biting me while I was checking food. They happened at totally separate times, and one of them is quite fresh, but they're nearly the exact same size and shape. There were a few occasions where I knicked myself with knives, but generally that doesn't happen. It's only heat that is my enemy in the kitchen. Most of those scars are from injuries as an adult.  I also have two belly-button scars. The first is my actual belly-button, so it doesn't count. The second is from the piercing I had there for seven years before I got sick of it getting infected constantly because those piercings never truly heal.  I think I'm going to go take a bath now and see if I can find any more scars.

      "It" being the entire purpose of this entire season of  Alias.   I'll tag it because I promised, but there aren't really any plot-related details. The most you could be spoiled for is the name of an actor who may or may not have been on this season.  [spoilers, kinda.]  I don't think the show is aimed at its audience. Oh, sure, lots of the love angst probably is, but the main story arc? It's a message. Roughly translated, it says, "Lena Olin! Please come back! We love you and we're just going to get weirder and weirder about this stuff until you do a guest spot!"  [/spoiler]  You know I'm right. After all, there is really no other excuse.

      I swore to myself that I wouldn't start being a brat about my birthday until Memorial Day (which is, for you non-Americans, usually the last weekend in May). I'm not sure that I'm going to make it.  In totally unrelated news, I was thrilled when Amazon added a ranking feature to wish lists. As soon as I noticed I went through my list and ranked everything. Then I began looking through other people's lists and getting annoyed that they hadn't ranked stuff. I am not a very patient person. (I mention patience since the annoyance came abut five minutes after I'd ranked my list, which occurred  immediately  after discovering the option to do so.)  Have a look at  urlLink my wish list . See the pull-down menus at the top? Sort it by Priority (high to low). Isn't that better?  No subtle hints about buying me gifts in anticipation of my birthday (July 6) intended.

      After a lovely Friday evening of Thai food and watching  Deadwood  with Jenn, I slept solidly and woke up motivated to, you know, do stuff. So we re-hung our Ring posters, which we've been meaning to do for a couple of weeks. I should clarify that by Ring I mean not  The Lord of the Rings  nor yet  Ringu / The Ring , but Wagner's  Der Ring Des Nibelungen . It's a four poster set, and arranged together the pattern on the posters forms a ring. It's very classy. After that we had breakfast and I read a book while Will played around with GTA Vice City, which he's already beat.  I got restless. You know that feeling when you're dissatisfied but it has nothing to do with the person you're with or the things you're doing or even life in general? It's an uncomfortable feeling, because you don't know what's causing it, only that you need to do  something , and right away. I moped for a few minutes, but that didn't help, so I asked Will if we could go somewhere. He suggested just driving around, but that sounded like more of the same. He jokingly (I think - maybe not) suggested we go browse at a toystore, and I said OK. There's a Best Buy next to the Toys R Us in Glendale, and I thought we could look at televisions to see how much money we have to put together to get something bigger than the teensy thing we've been getting by with. It's 19", which was great when Will bought it for his old studio apartment, but our widescreen movies don't look so great on it. I'm hoping to upgrade to 32" but would gladly settle for 27". Anyway, we looked around and figured that we'd need around $300, and then we went to see what PS2 games were marked down. I found the Simpsons game most appealing, but since I hate the controller for the PlayStation I didn't push the issue. While Will thought it over we browsed the DVDs. I was shocked and delighted to find  Ghost Dog: the Way of the Samurai  for  $6.99 , and we decided that at that price we couldn't leave without it. We also picked up the Cypress Hill album with "(rock) Superstar" on it, and the  Mummy  box set for me. Yes, the Stephen Sommers movies. Yes, I love them. Shove it. Will settled on a game called Tenchu: Wrath of Heaven, which sounds ridiculous but I guess is about Samurai.  We drove over to Rian's neighborhood and went to Ernie's, which is this great cheap Mexican place we love. She was asleep, the silly bitch, so we ate without her. Oh, and when I say the place is cheap, I am not taking into account the price of several drinks. Tequila expensive! Oh well. As I was driving back toward the 101 to go home, some boy leaned out of a stretch limo and said, "I can smell that" to me, which was absurd since I was smoking a cigarette. Then I realized that he must have been making assumptions based on my choice of music. I am a bad ass.  When we got home we watched  The Magnificent Seven , which I managed to go nearly 26 years without ever seeing. Silly me! It was, er, magnificent.

      So I'm half naked in the examination room, waiting for my doctor to come in and prod my girl parts, and I'm reading Redbook, the magazine most convenient to where I am sitting. Yikes - now I know everything about Nick and Jessica. Anyway, there was an article that told me that I probably shouldn't try to bring my child's fever down, because - get this - the fever is the body's way of fighting illness. Gee! Really? I've only known that since I was FIVE! I am appalled that people don't know that. It's so sad to me that important information like that is (apparently) not common knowledge.  Then on the drive home (I am skipping the part where I had to get $20 out of the bank and pay a $2 ATM surcharge just for the $1 parking fee because I am so mad about it) I was listening to the radio and heard a commercial for something called Chaser. It is a pill that you take when you drink that claims to absorb the toxins in alcohol that cause you to have a hangover. Oops, my mistake! I thought hangovers were from dehydration! I guess I can skip having a glass of water for every drink, because I am obviously drinking the magic toxin-free alcohol.  In other news, Will has a half day tomorrow, which makes it a good Friday (groan). It's just what the doctor ordered (double groan)!

      Ha ha. We are still not buying a house, because we are still poor because I am still not working. Technically, I still work for the kitchen, but I think they know that I don't want to break my back for eleven fucking dollars an hour, so I haven't heard from them.  The good news is that this morning we went to H+R Block to get Will's taxes done (I made under three grand and didn't have taxes taken out, so no filing for me)  and  he claimed me as a dependent,  and  he's getting money back from the evil government. Not a ton of money, but enough to put a nice dent in our credit card debt. And maybe get a present, or at least a nice lunch. I vote for sushi. SUSHI! We will take Cassie. (Don't tell Will! I haven't asked him yet! I just thought of it!)  So the nice lady who did the tax preparation for us, Noemi (what a lovely name), was really friendly and funny and told us that we were throwing our money away and should be making mortgage payments instead of paying rent every month. She showed us how our tax refund would look if we owned, and it came out to about the amount we'd be paying in property taxes, which seems fair. Also, she seemed pretty confident that we could buy without a down payment, though we'd still need the closing costs and all that. I don't really like the idea of not making a down payment, because it would mean higher interest if I am not mistaken, but I still like the idea of buying a house enough to give it some thought. Not that I haven't been thinking about it non-stop, but she made it sound like something that should happen sooner than we were planning, and that means PUPPY, so I want to do it.  In conclusion, I am bringing Will his lunch. I'M BRINGING WILL HIS LUNCH!

      I'm all set to install Windows XP. This has been something I've put off for essentially two years for a variety of reasons, some of them actually legitimate. But now that I am actually ready to install the upgrade, Setup won't run. It tells me I am out of memory. Ridiculous! I have more than the minimum requirement, though I probably should get more eventually. My guess is that other programs are usurping the memory needed for the installation, but I don't know which ones. So I went to the Microsoft webpage and looked at the XP Home Troubleshooting guide. Guess what?! It contains the  exact same information  as the paper guide that came with my XP CD, which does not cover the memory problem. All it says is that installation may take longer if you do not have the minimum required memory. Yeah, if longer = forever! Jerks.  I'm trying my trusty friend Google now. Again. Eventually I will have entered every single possible combination of key words and might even find a useful site.  ...Oh, great. I found a really helpful page telling me to boot from the installation CD, which I assume means that the installation takes place at least partly in DOS. I don't mind doing this, but it is very different than the Windows instructions (probably a good thing) and also seems that it would hinder the online part of the installation (but I think that is only the activation thingy, which can be done later, so that might not be an issue).  Why is this so complicated? I know that I am not stupid. I know that people upgrade their operating system every day.  At this rate, I may Scarlett O'Hara this process into next year.  In other news, today is International Dance Like A Monkey Day! Go, monkeys! Dance!

      It has come to my attention that it is the 10th anniversary of his death. Suicide always makes me sad, but his really didn't. This has, however, nothing to do with him.  About a week before his death, a friend of mine, J, had an abnormal pap smear. Having now been through this myself, it doesn't really seem like that big a deal. However, at the time I had very little knowledge of how common this is; she also had some family health issues and was, er, a little promiscuous. She went in for further testing a day or two before his body was found. On the day, I was out doing something-or-other, and got back to my dad's house to find frantic messages from both J and my mother (whose message told me to call J immediately). I assumed that the new tests had found something seriously wrong with her. I was in a horrible panic when I called her back. She was crying, and told me...Kurt Cobain killed himself.  I was so fucking relieved that I still can't bring myself to really give a crap. It sucks that his daughter doesn't have a father in her life. It sucks that he was so depressed. The whole damn thing sucks. But in the context of my life, it meant nothing.

      Here's the deal: I got up at about 8:30 this morning. Will got up a little after 10:30. He is showered and dressed and cleaning the grill and porch. I am wearing the clothing I slept in, thinking about a third cup of coffee, and goofing off online.  So, should I at least make him breakfast?

      Dear Los Angeles County Property Tax Information Line,  BLOW ME. I didn't  ask  to receive someone else's delinquent tax demand. I didn't ask to be on hold for a combined 45 minutes between different companies I was told to call (though I can't rightfully hold you responsible for the Postal Inspector's deficiencies). And I certainly didn't ask to get a  fucking busy signal  when I finally got through your ridiculously long and complicated automated menu.  Yours,  Frustrated and Angry

       DVD - Lone Wolf and Cub: Sword of Vengeance   urlLink Buy it at Amazon.com   This is a weird but beautiful Japanese movie based on the long-running  Lone Wolf and Cub  manga series (Amazon has  urlLink 18 volumes  available, but I believe there are many more in total).  Ogami Itto is the official Shogunate Executioner (the man who decapitates Samurai who perform seppuku). After his wife is killed and he is sentenced to death (for what are probably very simple reasons but feudal Japan is not my area of expertise - simply put, he pissed off the Yagyu clan who in turn framed him for treason), he chooses to walk the path of evil as an assassin for hire. He gives his infant son a choice between joining his mother and walking the path with his father. Daigoro chooses his father's sword over his own toy and the two of them set out on a path of revenge and solitude.  This first film in the series of six is burdened with flashbacks and explanations, which are probably necessary but made it difficult for me to follow. Originally released in 1972, it is violent without apology but the gore is rather silly - in one shot you may think that you see the tube from which copious amounts of bright red "blood" shoot out of a man's wound. There is another rather distressing scene in which a group of outlaws literally rape a young woman to death as her father watches, protesting. In fact, I don't recommend this one for anyone with tender sensibilities regarding women, as every one who appears in the film ends up dead (his wife, the raped peasant woman), crazy (in the beginning of the film a young woman, mad from the loss of her own son, mistakenly claims Daigoro and nurses him while her family explains to Ogami her circumstances and asks to pay him for the "rental" of his son; he refuses money, saying that Daigoro was hungry anyway), or...well, I'll get to the whore.  Honor is one of the primary staples of Japanese culture, and never moreso than in the time period during which this film takes place (the first half of the 17th century). When Ogami and Daigoro wind up in a small village populated by outlaws, the men threaten to kill a whore (and presumably Ogami as well) if he does not have sex with her. He lies with her in an utterly passionless scene, after which she praises his ability to get it up under such pressure and his willingness to cast aside his honor to save her life (there is no doubt that he could save his own, with or without his sword...the weapon, that is).  As I said, this movie is difficult to follow and the flashbacks and convoluted plot make it feel longer than it is. Nevertheless, I do recommend it.   DVD - Lone Wolf and Cub 2: Baby Cart at the River Styx   urlLink Buy it at Amazon.com   In the second movie, there is far less to keep track of and the storytelling is more linear. There are two basic plots: the leader of the Shadow-Yagyu hires a small, female branch of the clan to assassinate Ogami; men from the Awa clan hire Ogami to kill a man who is being escorted to another village to sell their secrets of indigo dyes (the escorts are, of course, three renowned brothers called the Gods of Death - more on them later).  There is a ridiculously comical scene in which the women prove that they need no backup from men: they literally chop the strongest male ninja to bits as he attempts to get past them. I just about laughed my head off, which, if I meant that literally, would have been appropriate.  To my delight, Daigoro is a little bit older in this film (though not more than 2) and participates a good deal more. We learn that his perambulator is not just a wooden cart. We rewound three times to see the look on his face as he flipped the 'switch' to release one of the many blades hidden in it as an assassin rushes him. In a tender scene when Ogami has been injured, Daigoro runs to the river and tries to bring his father water by making a bowl with his hands. Of course he fails, but he doesn't give up and his solution is clever and adorable. It is a lovely bit of insight into how self-sufficient he is, as well as the true bond between father and son. When he is later kidnapped by the Yagyu he is perfectly calm as Ogami tells them that he will go be with his mother, and follows an imperceptible direction from his father to help save his own life.  When we get back to the Gods of Death, they are on a boat headed to the meeting point from which they will escort the Awa traitor. The boat is filled with bumbling assassins as well as the one surviving woman, still bent on killing Ogami. The three brothers use unique weapons including a set of claws that fit over the (I presume) eldest brother's hands and are just wicked cool. They too follow a strict code of honor, fighting only those who attack them first or stand in the way of their tasks. One of the assassins onboard sets the boat on fire, and we learn that the baby cart floats. The woman, whose name I wish I knew as it would be easier to refer to her that way, attempts to kill Ogami as he is pushing the cart toward land, but he disarms her and winds up saving her life. There follows a very interesting scene in which it appears that he is going to rape her.  The final confrontation with the three brothers takes place in the desert (I need to study Japan's geography - I had no idea there were desert areas) and contains one of the absolute coolest ambushes I have ever seen.  I liked this one far more than the first - it even kept me awake! Having seen them in order myself, I can't say whether it would work to come into the series at this point, so I'd advise watching the first one first. Besides, you just might love  Sword of Vengeance.    The rest of the series   urlLink Lone Wolf and Cub 3: Baby Cart to Hades    urlLink Lone Wolf and Cub - Baby Cart in Peril    urlLink Lone Wolf and Cub - Baby in the Land of Demons   urlLink Also available at DeepDiscountDVD    urlLink Lone Wolf and Cub White Heaven in Hel    Conclusion  The DVD treatment of these films is astounding. The transfer is so beautiful that the movies could have been shot yesterday. The cinematography is outstanding, making the crisp, clean transfer all the more enjoyable. There are two subtitle options; the full subtitles include explanations of select words to help the viewer understand what is going on and, to some extent, how the society was set up. The liner notes, available both in the traditional form and onscreen, explain the class system in great detail and reference sources that were used for the notes as well as in the translation. I can't say how the sound is, other than clean, because we have lousy speakers.  These are short movies - under 90 minutes. And they are really freakin' neat (if disgusting in places). Go! Rent or buy them! That's an order.

      According to one rather unreliable source ( urlLink AICN ) and one vaguely more reliable source ( urlLink savewonderfalls.com  by way of  urlLink WHEDONesque ), a DVD release of  Wonderfalls  is looking likely. This is good news for those of us who thought the series was clever and entertaining.  But, while searching for the referenced statement that Tim Minear supposedly made about it, I found  urlLink this Google cached page from foxnow.com.  I know that viewership (is that a word?) dropped after the second week, but it doesn't seem possible that the decision to cancel was made completely spur-of-the-moment, so I can't help but wonder why the FUCK Fox sited the ratings as their reason for cancellation.  From the site, dated only two weeks ago*:  WONDERFALLS had a solid sampling in its first 2 weeks, averaging 4 million viewers.  The series delivers its best performance among teens on Friday night, ranking #1 in its time period.  WONDERFALLS is also popular with young men, ranking #2 in its time period among Men 18-34. One wonders how far it could have fallen in its third week, since the decision to cancel was announced mere hours after the fourth episode aired.  I'm not necessarily criticizing Fox's decision. It was, after all, theirs to make. I am just questioning their reasons.  *a few more clicks reveal that  urlLink the current page  has the same information on it.

      Today's question:  What color are my eyes?   The catch is that I'm not going to show a new picture. Granted, you could look at any of the photos in the last batch. But it's almost certain that your answer won't match my driver's license - only one person has ever thought my eyes are the color I think they are without being prompted (by me) to look closer. Much closer. (In case anyone doesn't know, you fill out your own eye color and hair color on the form when you get a license.)  In other news, I dreamed that Xia was visiting and I let him make omelets while I made potatoes. I was very hungry in the dream.

      Not the god-awful movie, but rather mine.  Here's the deal: When I was born my hair was black. It never fell out. When my sister was born her hair was red. It fell out and grew back in blonde. Her hair is now dark blonde or light brown or whatever you want to call that hair-colored hair color. Mine, on the other hand, is a mystery. It got lighter as I grew up and was fairly red by my first birthday:     On the other hand, by age six or so it was dark, dark brown:     Around 16 I started obsessively dying my hair (I wonder how many pillowcases and towels were destroyed due to the combination of me and Manic Panic).   Not Manic Panic but how I looked in college (only bangs are dyed - plenty if you ask me):     I continued dying it on and off until a year or two ago. I've grown out a very short cut and have not dyed once. So the question is,  What color is my hair?  At a glance, I'm a brunette. But if you look closely at the individual hairs they are pretty damn red. And, to complicate things further, there is a blonde streak above my left eye.  A recent picture:     And now that you've all seen how very pretty I am, I will repeat the question because I'm sure you got distracted:  What color is my hair?

      In the interest of not driving my future husband completely mad, I thought I might post about something other than my internet trials and tribulations. (As an interesting note, I had to look up tribulations because that phrase is the only context in which I have ever heard it. Turns out the phrase is slightly redundant. That seems fitting.)  I can't think of anything to write about, though. I could mention that I'm working out and every inch of my body hurts, but, well, I hurt too much to talk about it. I could wax poetic abut the joys of  Deadwood , but it would be easier to just link to suki's blog (AdventureWorld on the sidebar). I could discuss the latest wedding snafu (which is actually ongoing), but that might make me ill and anyway it isn't an issue for the wedding itself and therefore possibly Not Of General Interest.  Have any of you read  The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants ? I picked it up in an airport in transit to or from my Grandfather's funeral last September. It's Young Adult literature, which is hit or miss, but this one is a hit. It's being made into a movie which is either currently filming or about to start. There are four girls whose stories are told in the book, and Amber Tamblyn (Joan of Arcadia) is playing one of them (Tibby). According to imdb, Alexis Bledel is playing another. The other two, as well as a fifth girl around whom Tibby's story centers, are actresses I am not familiar with, though one was in  Real Women Have Curves , which I kind of meant to see. The imdb listing is  urlLink here , though of course they are generally unreliable for unfinished movies. Anyway, my point - and I did have one - is that I really enjoyed this novel and I wondered if any of my readers had picked it up. If not, and if you are not allergic to stories about teenage girls, I do recommend it. (There is a sequel, but I am not going to read it until a trade paperback is released.)  That was nice and random, wasn't it?

      Now that I've written "Testing" I feel that I ought to blather on about something completely unrelated to testing. WDers have warped my brain.  Anyway. I am trying out  urlLink Jamie's suggestion of using color  (rather than my old standby, grey) for my links. First I tried bolding them but it looked retarded. It seems  really  blue to me, but I'm opening it up for comments before I try anything else. (I might see if I can make the sidebar links a different color - probably the original grey - and leave the post links blue-grey. So that is one possibility if I don't just keep it like this.)  Also,  urlLink my FTP issues  have been resolved. I was right - I fucked something up on the server end of things. They fixed it for me. The support email was rather chiding. Honestly, for their prices, do they think they have computer geniuses using their services? Or any kind of geniuses? Oh well. Fixed now.

      The new version of Blogger offers new templates. I played around with one in my test blog and decided that I liked it, so I am trying it out here. I'm also trying out the Blogger-hosted comments, which is why you can no longer see comments on any old posts. ( Edit: it appears that if you click on 'Comments' and then refresh the post page, you can leave a comment on older posts. )  If the blog looks the way you're used to, please refresh the page.  Then leave a comment telling me what you think of the change. I haven't decided yet, and the old template is saved in case I decide to go back to it.  Yes, this is a form of procrastination.

      I have succeeded in many areas in the last few days:   delicious pizza (so good that when Saturday's supply was exhausted I made more) new blog template (see above post) configuring email (it sounds easy, but it wasn't) getting started on getting in shape (weights, crunches, etc.)  and   reading stuff that isn't on the internet (books! Remember those?)  But I am still a failure. However, I suspect that it might not be entirely my fault.  Here is the situation: I have a web host. I have SmartFTP (the free version). I uploaded some files to my server, including an image folder and the pages you can see if you go to noirbettie.com. I opened SmartFTP on Saturday and none of my files were there. They are obviously still on the server, but nowhere to be found on the FTP program. I figured I had a couple of choices: download them from the server, which I don't know how to do; ignore them and continue adding new files; or upload them again, overwriting my previous work.  I think I chose the wrong option (the last one), because now nothing is working. Except the website itself, except that it's showing the old versions of the pages (I modified two of them and overwrote them on FTP  after  re-uploading them).  I found a SmartFTP tutorial online, but it only covered getting started. So, before I got started on this folly of mine, I checked to make sure ALL of the settings were correct. They appeared to be, so I went ahead with the upload. But as I said, the files don't seem to be going anywhere. As far as I can tell, I am not in fact overwriting the information that is already on my server, but I don't know why. I'm looking through the forums at SmartFTP, but so far only one person has posted with a similar problem and no one has replied. I'm going to try the FutureQuest forums next.  I just want to cry because this is  so  not my area of expertise. Put me on Iron Chef and I'd probably be fine, but this? Hopelessly lost.  NEW INFORMATION: I have received a telephone call inviting me to go on Iron Chef.  No, hang on...that wasn't it. But I  may  have figured out the problem with my FTP program, which may not have actually been the problem at all. It seems that I may have fucked up my admin permissions with my web host. I submitted a fix-it request to my host and have already received a response, though it appears to be automated (and I hope it is, since I think about three people work at this company).  Please cross your fingers that this will take care of the problem.

       1. Take five books off your bookshelf. 2. Book #1 -- first sentence 3. Book #2 -- last sentence on page fifty 4. Book #3 -- second sentence on page one hundred 5. Book #4 -- next to the last sentence on page one hundred fifty 6. Book #5 -- final sentence of the book 7. Make the five sentences into a paragraph  I am using the Wild Cards series, books I through V. I know I didn't have to specify, but I did anyway. It should be noted that I have only actually read the first two books.  "Years later, when I saw Michael Rennie come out of that flying saucer in  The Day The Earth Stood Still , I leaned over to my wife and said, "Now that's the way an alien ought to look." It took a moment to sink in, but when it did, Jube knew he had his answer. The late summer sun was soothing on her bare arms and face. The camp was only part of it. Joey laughed."

      Do me a favor, please. Shoot me. Shoot Outlook Express. And shoot my web host. Possibly not in that order.  Anyway, I have new email set up. It took a consultation with Cassie and another consultation with my daddy and I still don't have it the way I wanted it, but it'll do.  I can now be emailed at noirbettie.com. Theoretically, any user name will work, but if it is personal mail you can send it to annika. My watchersdiary mail still works and will indefinitely (and should be used for anything Buffyguide related), but I am phasing out my crappy msn account and plan to use it only for messenger.  The first couple of pages of my website are up in test form. More will be up soon, but as soon as I got Outlook working my FTP program went all womlu on me. It would seem that I cannot catch a break. If you like, you can take a look ( urlLink noirbettie.com ). Like I said, only a few pages are up and some of them will be changing. At this point, since the content is all up in the air, I mostly just want aesthetic feedback. Comments here or email to feedback at noirbettie.com would both be most appreciated.  You are all rock stars.

      I don't know if I mentioned it before, but Darren is planning to move here. He has a "two year plan." This is a Good Thing, even better than anything Martha could come up with (and I love Martha). D's situation is complicated slightly by his 14-year-old daughter, so I was, frankly, not counting on ever living in the same city as him again (unless we lost all of our marbles and moved back to Pittsburgh). But he is saving his pennies and it looks like it is really going to happen. He called us twice yesterday to make sure it was really all right with us. I believe it is time for a rousing chorus of "Duh!"  It is my fondest dream to start a production company. It's a while down the road, but I want to develop some of the television ideas we've got, and maybe movies as well. The three of us (Will, Darren and I) are all of a creative bent, though the boys are miles ahead of me in sheer creative energy. They worked together (with some input from me) on our first TV idea a few years ago. Whenever Will and I have talked (idly, I admit) about starting this company for real, Darren is the first name that comes up. We have several friends we'd love to work with in one capacity or another, but he is the one we can't do without.  I am trying not to get my expectations up. I don't know how long it will take for Darren to get out here, and I don't know where Will and I will be at that point (not geographically, just life in general). But damn, it is hard not to plan.  Our digital camera was put to use quite a bit during D's visit a few weeks ago. The results can be viewed  urlLink here . Please take a moment to admire my handsome boys (and, oddly, my feet: there seem to be two pictures of them).

      Inspired partly (in a roundabout way) by Jess's  urlLink Reference Library  posts, I've decided to make a post of links to sites that I enjoy reading. I don't intend to include any that I reference on a regular basis (e.g. CHUD), though a few may slip in. Some of these are daily reads, some weekly, some on an as-needed basis; but all of them are worthy of a look.   Blogs     urlLink Alas, a Blog : A lefty, feminist political blog. Started by Barry Deutch, aka ampersand, a brilliant comic author. There are now three other contributers. All of them are brilliant. A daily read for me.    urlLink I Don't Think : Emily's personal blog. I don't know Emily, but I think she's smart and funny and I love her blog.     urlLink Sassypants : Sarah and Emily are friends, and everything I said about Emily is true of Sarah. I can't remember which blog I started reading first, but I think it was this one.     urlLink PORNBLOGRAPHY : Dude. Do not click this link if you are under 18. Or if you find porn and the discussion thereof offensive. (By the way, if the latter is true of you, why on earth do you like me? I  loooooove  porn.)    urlLink Cubic Hell : This is one of the most genius blogs on the web. It is anonymous and has several members. The posts are work-related bitching and complaining that cannot be done anywhere but an anonymous group blog.    urlLink Annika's Journal : No, not me. I don't remember how I first stumbled across annika-with-a-lower-case-a's site. I do remember being surprised at our similarities and differences: we are like evil twins in so many respects. We have the same name, for one thing. I go by bettie sometimes; her best friend's name is Betty. I'm moderately to the left, she's a conservative Republican. We both live in Los Angeles but grew up elsewhere. I'm a lazy housewife, she's a law student. I disagree with her on many issues, but she's always good for an intelligent post from another viewpoint. Plus, sometimes she's  really  funny.   Sites     urlLink Creature Corner : I pimp out CHUD all the time. Creature Corner is CHUD's baby sister, a site devoted entirely to horror.    urlLink Irony Central : Jeff is a computer game designer. I think he wants to run the world. Most importantly, he has a two year-old daughter named Cordelia who he writes about. Start with "The Story About The Baby." Go on to "The Story About the Toddler." New installments monthly. Pee-your-pants funny.    urlLink Union Muse : This is my dad's site. He's been a professional musician for 30 years; about ten years ago he worked for the Musician's Union. Now he works as an advocate for musicians who are being screwed over by the union designed to protect them. Probably only of interest to union musicians, but what the hell. It's my papa, look at it anyway.    urlLink Tomato Nation : You know Television Without Pity? Of course you do. This is Sars's site. The Vine is her advice column which I have attempted to rip off. Very good stuff.   Reference     urlLink OneLook Reverse Dictionary : Dude. A  reverse dictionary.  Type in the meaning, it gives you the word. Not perfect (I have found that it is not capable of narrowing down the choices enough for my taste), but for someone like me who is constantly finding the right word "on the tip of my tongue," it can be a lifesaver.    urlLink Project Gutenberg : Free e-books (generally text documents) of nearly everything in public domain (which is generally anything written prior to 1923). Thanks to Jess for turning me onto this site.  Enjoy. Part 2, my non-internet reads, will be up soon.

       BuffyGuide/WD site/forum downtime    Hello,  This is just a warning that you're going to be seeing (starting  already) some downtime and some "roughtime". The hard drive on my server is  going bad and has to be replaced. This will mean downtime while my  hosting company does the replacement and then while I move the data over and  reconfigure everything. And since I can't do this stuff from work, and  I don't have a lot of time during weeknights, it may take a few days.  Once the site and forums are back up, things still may be a little bumpy  at first while I'm installing and configuring everything. Bear with me!  If you like, you can subscribe to the site mailing list by sending an empty email to bgupdates-subscribe @ lists.watchersdiary .com -- I will send notice to all subscribers when the site and forums are back up, or if there are any other major developments.  Those of you who have friends who visit the site or the forums, please  pass this info on to them. If you have a blog frequented by WDers,  maybe you could post this info?  Thanks for your patience,  Jamie Marie BuffyGuide.com http://www.buffyguide.com

      This is a difficult letter for me to write. I have every hope that you will be the next President of my country, and I do not wish to disappoint you.  Thank you for your letter. It was so kind of you to call me "Friend."  My concern began in the third paragraph, when you referred to "our Party," and was exacerbated in the fourth when you stated that "[I] have stood with [y]our campaign through thick and thin." I don't know how to tell you this, but I am not a Democrat. I know I voted in the Democratic Primary Election this past March, but I am registered Undeclared and have every intention of remaining that way. Frankly, it would take a great deal more than you are offering for me to consider aligning myself with either party. Also, you should know that I voted for Howard Dean, despite the fact that he'd dropped out of the race. I truly felt that he was the best man for the job, and wished to show that with my vote. Rest assured, however, that I will vote John Kerry in November.  I hope this clears matters up. You seem like a very nice man, but I will be spending the $35 you requested at the supermarket, or maybe even the bookstore.  Hugs and Kisses, Annika

      So I will just mention that yesterday, between 9:00 in the morning and 6:00 in the evening, gas went from $2.35 a gallon (regular unleaded) to $2.39 a gallon. We're currently at about a third of a tank, which means that we will need to fill up fairly soon. I believe the appropriate reaction is "Oh crap." I am trying to remind myself how much more expensive gasoline is and always has been in Europe, but it isn't very consoling when you live in Los Angeles.  On the Good News front, SUV sales have apparently dropped significantly since gas prices started rising.

      First, you have to pretend that you are me. Go on, take a moment to admire your fabulous new rack.   All set?  More than a year ago you installed the software for the digital camera. Last June you know that you had the software because you brought it with you to your papa's place in case it was needed to use the camera with his Mac (it wasn't). You know you brought it back home because you called yourself an idiot a few times on the plane for putting it in your carry-on bag. Man, that bag was heavy - remember?  Anyway. Last week you installed a new operating system, making it necessary to reinstall all of your programs. Good job on that, by the way, but if you don't find Norton soon it is your fault that the computer will die.  Today you took a photograph of a hi-larious license plate/license plate cover/bumper sticker combination. Thanks for waiting until traffic stopped, by the way. You went to upload the photo to the computer. XP informed you, in its shiny happy way, that it had detected new hardware. You grabbed the two discs that came with the camera and installed everything on them. It didn't work. You ran around like a chicken with your head cut off looking for the mysterious third disc that was obviously the problem. You came back upstairs to whine to your blog about it when you couldn't find any more discs.  Now, the question, you-that-is-me, is not where the third disc went. You and I both know there never was any third disc. The question is why, for the love of god, did you run disc two twice and ignore disc one? Man, you're dumb.

      Alternate title: Adventures in driving in Los Angeles.  We drive a 2000 Mazda Protege. It's a great car. And it's metal colored, which means that the months and months between visits to the carwash don't show until it gets really gross. It's an automatic, but it doesn't seem aware of that. It has terrific pick-up, better than some manual transmitions I've driven. I love stopping at a red light next to some tricked out car whose driver is revving the engine, because nine times out of ten I can get up to full speed faster.  That was nearly my downfall today.  You see, Buco and I like to drive fast when the Weezer is playing on the stereo and the windows are down.  Today I was driving across 3rd in the right lane. I stopped at a light. There was a nice big white and black sedan next to me. The light turned green. My foot said "GO!" In the knick of time, my brain said "COP!"  More stories to come.

      and I haven't even picked up a pen.  Today I went to Staples and picked up some nice paper and matching envelopes (matching as in the same paper weight - it's all just plain white). Then I went to the post office and got 100 revolting "I   You" stamps because I found them slightly less revolting than the pink flowery stamps. I wanted monkeys, but they sold out of those in five seconds. Go figure.  So now I have to print and photocopy the save-the-dates (only two months later than I meant to),  address somewhere between 75 and 100 envelopes , and then die. Or cry. Or just take a  really  long nap.  Why didn't I buy the nice Avery address labels? Template already in Word! Stupid Annika.   EDIT: Nice Avery address labels back on the menu. Hee. "Menu."

      The all night drive-thru: not so good for the obesity problems;  damn fine  when your sweetie's had a few and wants a greasy burger.  The staff was slow-moving and unhappy. I don't blame them. I said "thank you" to every person I spoke with. Twice.  One stop for "burritos" for me. One stop for fries and "chicken" "nuggets." One stop for a burger. Yes, this is our regular routine, though we altered it as Burger King is not open all night (we substituted Carl's Jr).  The food doesn't even have that fast food smell.  The bags don't get greasy on the drive home.  The fries are vaguely warm.  The burger tastes like a heat lamp.  The burrito - actually, that tasted exactly like they always do. Three cheers for reconstituted beans and cheese made out of plastic!  Everything was wonderful. Better than when it's fresh.  The way I see it, eating food that was prepared six hours ago by someone who hates their job is better. It's like adopting a rescue dog instead of getting the purebred puppy: This food  needs  you to eat it. It tries extra hard to please.

      OK. I know html and I have a pretty good understanding of CSS. I have  no freakin' idea  what perl, mySQL and CGI mean (well, I know what they  mean , just not how they work), and FTP confuses me.  So what the fuck am I doing with this paid web hosting?  This is going to be the most basic website on earth.  (I'm just venting. I am actually quite certain that I can figure everything out as I need to.)  As soon as I figure out how to upload files, I'll need some test readers. Leave me a comment if you want to volunteer - but please be aware that I'll need more constructive feedback than "it's fine" or "it looks nice" (not that I don't want to hear that, of course). Just know that I'm asking for a little more of your time.

      Dear Prospective Parents,  FOR THE LOVE OF GOD! Look up what your baby's name means before you make it official.  Thank you.  I got a hit earlier from a search engine I'm not familiar with. The search was for "annika," a search that I sometimes find in my referrers, and I wanted to see what page my hit was on (I think I'm on page 15 on google with that search term). I never did figure it out, because the results pages were not numbered, but I did find a geocities site for an adorable baby named Annika Grace. Lovely name isn't it? There's just one  teensy  problem.   Annika means Grace.

      Yesterday I bought the juiciest, reddest, ripest strawberries on earth. About half a flat of strawberries, in fact. This begs the question,  what am I going to do with them?  The answer is either  eat them as quickly as possible  or  freeze some of them  - I haven't decided yet. I have managed to make a mighty large dent in them already. Deeee-licious.  Also yesterday I cleaned the kitchen. I didn't quite finish the dishes (there were a lot) and I swept the floor but haven't cleaned it yet. It's pretty gross and I think it requires the hands-and-knees-with-a-sponge method, which I wasn't quite up for after scrubbing all of the counters and completely cleaning the coffee machine.  I've been cleaning up (er, more figuratively) both computers as well. Didn't know we had two computers? That's OK, I usually forget. The other one is a laptop that didn't work very well or have any useful programs on it. I uninstalled almost everything, and installed Office (Thanks, Jenn!), and it is already running better. Now if I could only figure out the weirdness with the mouse. It has a built-in mouse, of course - one of the nubby ones in the middle of the keyboard - and an external laser mouse installed. Jimmy suggested that the pointer might not slide around like it was on drugs if I disabled the built-in mouse, but I can't figure out how. By magic, the external mouse worked perfectly this morning when the power cable was not attached, but the battery drains very quickly and when I plugged the AC back in, the external mouse stopped working altogether. I tried to read the User's manual for ideas on fixing the situation, but it was useless in regard to mouses. It did, however, give me some free therapy:  If problem-solving is taking a long time, take a break.  If you have been fighting to solve a problem for a long time, you are probably frustrated by now. Stand up and take a deep breath. Often, you can find a new solution to a problem just by stepping away from it for a few minutes.  It's the  urlLink Kinder, Gentler  Toshiba: It holds my hand but isn't very useful.  Excuse me, I have to go register for a breadbox.

       urlLink MSN House & Home - Low-Carb Salads   Why do people need a  recipe  for a low-carb  salad ? It's lettuce! Zero carbs! (Oh, excuse me, it's apparently 2.5 carbs.)  I know some people who have done really well on Atkins. You know why?  They followed it properly.  This obsession with the idea that low-carb everything will make you lose weight and bring about world peace, however, is BULLSHIT.  All that said, the salads look pretty tasty.

      It's been that time for a month or more, but nevermind.  The computer is running better already, but I really think that the XP design is Windows for Retards. And those of us who got used to the old versions are the retards now, because I sure as hell can't figure out where anything is. I needed the assistance of a hot lesbian just to figure out how to import my IE favorites from CD. (The fact that she's a hot lesbian is irrelevent; I'm just bragging.) Either everything is more intuitive or it is all totally the opposite (counter-intuitive, I guess that would be), but either way I expect to get used to it. I had a hell of a time getting it to recognize my speakers, but that has nothing to do with Windows and everything to do with untangling the mess of wires behind the desk to un- and re-plug them.  If the Teletubbies or the Rugrats jump out of my monitor, though, I have a Windows 95 disc ready. It might seem extreme, but all of these bright colors are freaking me out! (And yes, I know that I can use "Classic Windows," but that would just make it take me longer to figure everything out. I would be lulled into a false sense of security.)  To make the transition smoother, the first thing I did was put all my pictures back on the machine. My new desktop image is a photo of Will and Darren making funny faces in our bar in Pittsburgh. If I start to worry about anything, I can just minimize all of my windows.

I think I am looking forward to tomorrow's  Friends  finale more than tonight's  Angel . So sad. But you see,  Friends  is like comfort food. I don't always (or even often) feel like watching it, but when I do, it's exactly what I needed.  I really haven't got anything to say today. I bought a bathing suit that fits. I washed the sheets. It's almost dinner time and I have no idea what I'm going to make. Maybe we have some skabetti (which is not a play on my former Rude Girl leanings but rather the way my stepsister said spaghetti when she was little).

      Not to brag or anything*, but I made a truly terrific dinner tonight. I decided to use the rest of the garbanzo beans** I had for hummus, and had already taken out some chicken to thaw for Will, so I made a mini-Mediterranean feast. I cooked red onion, garlic and red bell peppers, removed them from the pan, and browned the chicken. Then I added apple cider and covered the pan. When it started to boil away I added a chopped tomato and some sun-dried tomato. When the chicken was mostly cooked I removed it and put the onions, etc., back into the pan with olives and artichoke hearts. I cooked that for just a minute or two, removed it again, and finished the chicken, pouring everything else into the pan with it (except for a reserved portion for myself because I don't like chicken). Served it all with pita. Dee-lish.  After we ate, Will played Tenchu and I went online for a little while. After about an hour, I decided that it was high time we got some use out of the building swimming pool. I'd kind of wanted to a few times this winter, but it isn't heated. We dug up our swimming suits and went downstairs to play. (I have added a new suit to my shopping wish list, because it turns out that when your old one is even the tiniest bit too small, your tits tend to try to escape.) I am not a very good swimmer. I can do the breast stroke and a modified dog paddle that is actually much faster and more effecient than my many attempts at the crawl, and I can tread water like nobody's business, but I do not put my head under. Any water up my nose and I freak the fuck out. I am also one of those annoying people who hates to be splashed and goes into the water about an inch at a time. I was very brave and went in up to my waist immediately, ducking under to my shoulders within a few minutes. (I eventually go totally under, usually, but I have to hold my nose.) Will is a fish! It's so cute, and rather astonishing that I am the water sign. Somehow in six years we have never been swimming together. We played for about half an hour and had a very good time, though next time I will try to remember to take off my engagement ring and glasses before we leave the apartment. Even though we were the only ones in the pool, it made me nervous to have them sitting on the concrete.  The only real downside I can see to this newfound pleasure is that Ol' Blue Eyes*** doesn't react well to chlorine, even the low levels in our pool. I am going to get him some goggles, since it's his eyes that take it the worst. I think his skin will get adjusted to it more easily.  *Who am I kidding? I love to brag about my cooking. **chick peas, for the uninitiated. ***I obviously mean Will. My eyes are also blue, but with a lot more green in them than his. I don't actually understand what eye color has to do with it, but Will seems pretty certain.

      No more moping. Not on Rex Manning Day!  [spoiler for this week's  Alias ]  When Vaughn and Sydney get to the complex and Vaughn checks the dead guard, he then takes the guard's rifle. So he puts away the  CIA issue  pistol that he was holding incorrectly and uses this rifle,  without even checking to see if it's loaded.  What a freakin' moron. Will wanted to blame Michael Vartan and his forehead for that moment of idiocy, but I blame the witless director, seeing as later on when Sloane is drugging his daughter, he doesn't get the air out of the needle before injecting her.  Also, I am willing to accept all of this Rimbaldi bullshit, but I cannot accept that in Alias-land the CIA has  Magic Helicopters  with "whisper mode."   I almost died when Lauren used the LAW (light anti-tank weapon). I am not exaggerating - I was laughing so hard that no oxygen was able to get to my brain.  The rest isn't even worth comment.  Except maybe the end, when Vaughn proves once again that he doesn't have enough training to carry any firearm on earth.  [/spoiler]

      (See what I did there? Aren't I clever?)  I have always found the cost of a wedding to be outrageous. In the U.S., the average is around $20,000. For that amount Will and I could move into a lovely home and own it outright in no more than 30 years. Or we could buy a second car, cash. Or travel the world, probably twice.  While I feel that the wedding is an important entry into marriage, it is nonetheless only one day. And not even a whole day.  But we started planning ours, and costs of regular items triple when they are for a wedding, and we've already spent thousands of dollars, without any food decided on yet. And I hear food isn't cheap. The problem is (not with food, just in general) that once you begin planning a wedding you get caught up in the things that you never cared about and they become important.  Location: For 1/4 the price of the other places I looked at, we're getting married in a movie theater. Pretty damn cool. Still a lot of money.  Food: See above.  Clothing: Spent over a grand for my sister's and mine together. Had heart attack over it. Calmed down when realized that included jewelry (not something I planned on) and shoes and was gift from mommy. (My dress only cost $250, which I understand is simply unheard of.) Still looking at stuff for Will, but looks to be somewhere in the $300-400 range, plus about the same for new boots. Darren ordered lovely $100-something jacket, will need shirt, tie, etc. (They may wear jeans - it depends on whether Will gets a suit or frock coat.)  Flowers: Just eliminated unnecessary items that I was somehow talked into, knocked price down from over $900 to about $350. Still feel that I am being had. Wonder if I should go back to that crazy idea I had about doing them myself.  Photography: No idea. Might cry.  Ceremony music: Want strings, hate price. My father says it is reasonable, but I am not happy abut the amount that has already been spent. Plus, Will is undecided. We might just have a pianist. I feel that we ought to have some sort of live music because it is a silent movie theater. Reception music will just be CDs over the speaker system.  Cake: Apparently wedding cakes are priced per slice. FUCK THAT. I think we will get a couple of  urlLink those berry cakes I had for my 24th birthday . No decoration required. Delicious. Expensive, but not priced for a wedding.  Invites, etc: A friend of ours does beautiful work with a letter press. It won't be free, but she's giving us a terrific deal.  Favors: Still torn on this. Are they necessary? Definitely not, but they're a nice touch. If we do them, I'm just going to bring some cash to Chinatown.  There's some other little things, like parking and/or shuttle service and incidental rentals (like umbrellas and linens), some of which are optional.  The amount of money is just staggering to me. I was feeling so confident about everything, and today suffered a total setback. Right now I am thinking of going to City Hall. But some of the money has already been spent and besides, I  want  to share the event with people. I just can't help but think that the money, while nowhere near the 'normal' amount, would at least pay for closing costs on a nice house.  I've already got more suggestions and advice than I know what to do with, so I'm not asking for more. I guess I just thought I'd share. Of course, I thought it would be a quicky "ARRGGHH" entry...

      Let's see...last post was Tuesday. And  oh -so informative.  On Wednesday Will took Darren to work with him and I drove to Santa Monica where I met Pat and Stephanie and Saren and Harper. We went to the Puzzle Zoo on the Promenade, which is a very cool toy store. Harper got a fairy and Saren got a zebra and I got a little Hellboy toy for Will out of one of those bubble machines. It cost a DOLLAR! Outrageous. Harper was being very shy, but Saren was her usual talkative self. We walked to the Pier and went on the Merry-Go-Round. I sat next to Harper and she grinned at me as we went up and down. When we walked back out onto the pier she trotted up next to me and took my hand. It's not like she didn't like me before or anything, but she has always been more into Will (or Mama and Daddy) and it was just the sweetest thing ever. We walked down to the end of the pier and had lunch in a mediocre Mexican place. It had this weird well-like thing into which you could throw pennies. There was a lamp/bucket hanging down and below that was the ocean. Very weird. We walked back up the pier and looked at the rides but didn't go on any of them. Saren tried the binocular thingy and then we went down onto the beach. I sat with Stephanie while Pat and the girls played Chicken with the waves. Saren and Pat got soaked but Harper was too quick. Harper let me carry her back to the car and pointed out every single taxi (taggy) on the way. She is so sweet that I could just die. (I don't mean to make this so Harper-centric, but Saren and I have been fast friends since we met and it was very new and exciting for me to chat with Harper so much.) I drove back to Hollywood and picked up the boys and we went out for Indian food.  Thursday Will took the day off. If anyone from his office asks, we did wedding stuff all day. If you are not from his office, we went to the desert (though we did stop on the way to look at clothes for the boys, so we weren't totally lying or anything). We went to our usual spot, The Devil's Punchbowl in the Angeles National Forest in the Antelope Valley, north-east of here. I fell asleep in the back seat on the way there and slept with my face against the window. I have a lovely sunburn to show for it, because I only put sunscreen on my arms. Doh. I had a hat, but apparently that only works if you wear it. We took the hike through the punchbowl. We also took pictures. I have not taken them off the camera yet.  On Friday I went back to Santa Monica, this time with Darren. He had never seen the Pacific, so we rectified that. Friday night we went to a party for Ludek's birthday. It was very nice and I had a nice time, but I am just not a party person.  Saturday was our lazy day. We played video games and sat around a talked. I made Chile Verde for dinner and Will's friend Bill came over (he lives in San Francisco and was in town for the weekend - otherwise we wouldn't have seen anyone, as it was Darren's last night here). After Bill left we stayed up all night playing one of the best games of Deadlands I have ever participated in. I was a ninja. NINJA! Fell asleep around 5:00 and forced myself out of bed a little after nine. Darren had a noon:something flight so we had coffee and then drove him to LAX. I am totally depressed that he's gone.

       urlLink This site  claims that it can tell you. You upload a photo of your face (full-front only) and it gives you matches. (It does not seem to work in Firefox, but is fine with IE.)  I entered four different pictures and got the following results:   Vanessa Mae, Ryoko Hirosue, Sandra Bullock   Vanessa Mae, Ryoko Hirosue, Juliette Binoche    Ryoko Hirosue, Audrey Hepburn, Athena Chu    Ryoko Hirosue, Whoopie Goldberg, Jamie Lee Curtis This girl appeared on all 4 lists:     Anyone notice anything suspiciously Asian about her? Vanessa Mae might be Asian as well, and Athena Chu appears to be. Whoopie Goldberg is, um, black.  None of them has facial structure  anything  like mine as far as I can tell.  Oh well. It was kinda interesting, anyway.  By the way, if anyone had signed up for the mailing list you would have received a very amusing email about this entry.  Link found on  urlLink Redsaid .

      I have never seen  Citizen Kane.   But I won't have to say that for long! A copy of the DVD just arrived from Mommy, along with a guidebook to the Southwest.  If CK is even half as good as  Touch of Evil , I will love it. (And if nothing else, I will not have to pretend that Chuck Heston is a fucking Mexican.)  In other news, I've added a mailing list feature. If you wish to avoid the annoyance of refreshing my blog hourly to see if I've updated, enter your email address in the form to the right. I can't promise that I'll send a notification promptly, but I'll certainly try.

      Emily is  urlLink blogging for charity . I'd like to sponsor her but have no idea how I'll come up with any money for it, so I thought I'd pass the word along in case any of you, dear readers, have money in your pocket that you are just waiting to give to charity. Or maybe just some money that isn't already dog-eared for necessities. Her site has a link to Project-Blog, the site that's putting the whole thing together, where you can sign up to sponsor and/or to blog.

      The mail lady just rang to tell me I had a package. I ran downstairs and fetched the Amazon box. I figured, one week till my birthday, I should be good and not open it.  Fuck that!  The lovely and generous Jason (aka Thunderstrike) sent me The Elements of Style, Streetwise Los Angeles (a map for my datebook) and EQUILIBRIUM! I am such a happy little kitten.

      On Saturday I went over to Meghan's house and fell truly, madly, deeply in love with a lost little puppy she'd brought home. If I didn't think it would get us kicked out of our building, I would have taken her home with me, expense of a dog be damned. As it is, I am seriously wondering if there's any way I could talk the building manager into making an exception to the No Pets clause in our lease. But I don't think Will wants the responsibility of a dog until we can get a house (and a second income), and I hardly fault him for that. (Pictures of my beloved are  urlLink here .) To complicate matters, Meg found a sign put up by the owner, but the damn woman has a full voice mailbox. PLEASE! If my dog was lost, I would not be more than two inches from the phone until she was found. Of course, I would also have her spayed, tagged, and microchipped. And not on a piece-of-crap, falling apart leash that she could break when I left her  tied up in the yard , which of course I would never do. Ooh, I am so upset right now.  In lighter news, we had a mummy triple feature yesterday. We watched  The Mummy , most of  The Mummy Returns  (we stopped it to go over to Jenn's for dinner), and  Bubba Ho-Tep.  Great stuff! Tonight I expect we will watch the latter with commentary.  And in completely irrelevant news, I made very good hummus yesterday.

      The following movies didn't  quite  make the cut for the  urlLink Top 25 , but are still most worthy of a mention. As before, in alphabetical order, but this time without commentary. And I managed to have only one tie, which I think everyone will agree is a perfectly reasonable tie.  1.   Aliens   2.   Amelie   3.   Bladerunner   4.   Breakfast at Tiffany's   5.   Bringing Up Baby   6.   Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid   7.   Chinatown   8.   Hellboy   9.   Jane Eyre   (1944) 10.   Jesus Christ: Vampire Hunter   11.   LA Confidential   12.   The Mummy   (1999) 13.   Muriel's Wedding   14.   Near Dark   15.   The Princess Bride   16.   Psycho Beach Party   17.   Rebecca   18.   Rushmore   19.   Silverado   20.   Say Anything...   21. [tie]   Star Wars: A New Hope   21. [tie]   Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back   22.   Switch Back   23.   That Thing You Do!   24.   The Thin Man   25.   Zulu    And I can't finish this entry without at least mentioning  Dogs in Space , which doesn't make the list but holds a  very  dear place in my heart.

      How the hell did you guys do this? It's  hard.  I decided, after coming up with 22 movies and knowing that I wasn't done yet, to make a Top 25 list. Then I cheated. What's funny is that the list is in alphabetical order, but the ties really would be ties.  Movies shot as one movie count as one movie no matter how they were released.  These are all movies that I consider good  and  that I am fond of. A lot of movies belong in one of those categories, but this list is only movies that fit in both.  Directors are listed mainly because some of the movies are only one of several versions and I'd hate for anyone to think that I meant Jan de Bont's trainwreck or Gene Kelly as D'Artagnan (though I do love that version) or, GOD FORBID, Keifer Sutherland as Athos. Besides, I knew almost all of them without looking them up, and I'm a show-off.  Without further ado:  1.   The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert   dir. Stephan Elliot Dude. It's a musical (sort of) about drag queens in the Australian outback. Even if it was awful, I'd probably love it (as long as Patrick Swayze wasn't in it). But it isn't awful. It's touching, funny, and a damn tight picture.  2.   The Big Sleep   dir. Howard Hawks I prefer the unreleased 1945 cut of the movie, available on the DVD. However, even the 1946 version provides one of the most entertaining detective stories ever committed to film. And even though Bogart was  not  the ideal Phillip Marlowe, he was damn good in the role.  3.   Black Hawk Down   dir. Ridley Scott The quintessential war movie.  4.   Charade   dir. Stanley Donen It's a thriller AND a romantic comedy!  And it doesn't suck!   5.   The Devil's Backbone   dir. Guillermo del Toro This chilling, lovely ghost story is first and foremost a coming-of-age story. Every frame is gorgeous.  6.   Dodgeball: A TRUE Underdog Story   dir. Rawson Marshall Thurber This movie knocked  BASEketball  off the list. If you know me, you know how much I love  BASEketball.    7.   Down By Law   dir. Jim Jarmusch I love Jim Jarmusch. I also think he is very weird and I might not want to sit next to him at the bar. While  Dead Man ,  Mystery Train  and  Ghost Dog  are all excellent movies, my love for  Down By Law  just runs a little bit deeper.  8.   Equilibrium   dir. Kurt Wimmer Holy crap! This is the single most kick ass movie ever made. For one thing, it takes place in a distopian future that kind of makes sense. For another, it has gun-kata. And if that doesn't convince you, it stars Christian Bale. Trust me on this one.  9.   Evil Dead II: Dead By Dawn   dir. Sam Raimi The first time I watched this movie, I had to rewind three times because the Evil Hand scene made me fall on the floor and miss stuff.  10. [tie]   Farewell, My Concubine   dir. Kaige Chen I'm not 100% positive whether this movie belongs on the list. I haven't seen it in nearly ten years because it made me too emotional the first (and only) three times I watched it. Strikingly beautiful. Very sad.  10. [tie]   The Haunting   dir. Robert Wise The limitations of the time period (1963) may be what made this movie as good as it is. No special effects worth mentioning, just hand-gripping terror.  11.   Lonesome Dove   dir. Simon Wincer I'm cheating a little bit with this one - it's a six-hour mini-series. But fuck it, it's also my favorite western of all time.  12.   The Lord of the Rings   dir. Peter Jackson If I have to explain this one, you aren't paying attention. (That isn't to say, dear readers, that  you  have to like it; just that I think everyone can understand at least in part why it is so beloved.)  13.   Love and a .45   dir. C.M. Talkington This one is sort of a sentimental favorite. But I do think it's a pretty great example of a crime spree movie. And it has Dinosaur Bob.  14.   The Man Who Would Be King   dir. John Huston Words cannot express how much I love this movie, so I am not going to try.  15.   Notorious   dir. Alfred Hitchcock My only complaint about  Notorious  is that I don't like the way Ingrid Bergman plays drunk. But that is hardly reason enough to dislike the movie with the greatest ending of any movie I have ever seen. And the rest isn't exactly shabby. Plus, Hitchcock famously dodged the "Hayes" Code in the kissing scene (but don't worry, it isn't a Kissing Movie).  16.   Once Upon a Time in the West   dir. Sergio Leone For me, this movie falls more on the side of good than favorite, though I liked it a lot. But it would make the list for the opening sequence alone.  17.   Paper Moon   dir. Peter Bogdanovich This movie is pretty much the definition of charisma and charm. It's sort of a buddy movie, except the buddies are a con man and a little girl.  18.   Raiders of the Lost Ark   dir. Steven Spielberg OK, Spielberg, you cutting-me-off-in-traffic, walky-talky bastard. I give you this one.  19.   Ravenous   dir. Antonia Bird Man vs Man. Man vs. Nature. Man vs Self. All in one excellent movie. With cannibalism. ( Almost  as good as  Cannibal! The Musical. )  20.   Secondhand Lions   dir. Tim McCanlies I did NOT expect to love this movie. I wasn't even sure I'd like it. But  oh, man.   21.   Singin' in the Rain   dir. Stanley Donen and Gene Kelly Look, this movie is too long and the "modern" ballet in the middle is pointless and annoying. But it is not only a life-long favorite of mine, it is also fascinating historically. It was written around the songs. It pokes fun at itself and Hollywood relentlessly.  22.   The Three Musketeers/The Four Musketeers   dir. Richard Lester First of all, Oliver Reed can buckle my swash any day. Or, you know, he could if he wasn't dead. The first movie makes a plot of simple intrigue; the second has one of the best monologues ever in film. And they both have swashbuckling!  23.   Touch of Evil   dir. Orson Welles If you can get over the fact that Chuck Heston plays a Mexican, and the bad guys "shoot up" marijuana, this movie is perfect.  24.   Waking Ned Devine   dir. Kirk Jones When I walked out of the theater after seeing this movie, I felt more delighted to be alive than I had ever felt or have ever felt since. This is a heartwarming, feel-good movie, in the purest sense.  25. [tie]   The Wizard of Oz   dir. Victor Flemming et al This movie should be such a gigantic mess, but instead it is pretty much  the  classic movie.  25. [tie]   X2: X-Men United   dir. Bryan Singer I didn't think that comic book movies  got  any better than  X-Men.  I was mistaken.

      So,  Dodgeball  is close to $50 million ($48,670,000 to be exact). That means that it took in almost 2/3 of its opening weekend gross  during the week.  Fucking amazing.  And now back to your regularly scheduled blog (my movie list[s] coming v. soon).

      Uwe Boll responds to the nay-sayers of his movie, the  urlLink "very big success"   House of the Dead .  First of all if you really see the move on screen or DVD you will recognize that the CINEMASCOPE look of the movie and the sound are absolutly A LIST and not one percent less quality as RESIDENT EVIL or UNDERWORLD.  Better than  Underworld ? Well, thank god for that.  I think his poor grasp of English is really quite charming.  NEW INFO (and I use the term "info" v. loosely):  urlLink "House of Ze Dead"

      So I was poking around on LiveJournal, because none of my friends have updated since last time I checked. I came across a community based on film reviews and discussion, which claimed to be better than another, similar community. We'll call the first one I found "Fuck You" and the one they directed me to "Flick You." I am using those names specifically because they  are  the communities' names - though not their  entire  names.  The rules to join Fuck You are to post a list of your ten favorite directors, then your ten favorite films NOT by those directors. I thought that was a neat idea and went off to check out the allegedly more rigid Flick You community. Their rule is a list of your top 20 films. Once you've posted your application the existing members can vote Yes or No or ask you for a top five in a specific genre (I saw films by female directors, heist movies, rom-coms and Asian films, among others). The community members are disgustingly picky - basically, if your list doesn't fit their idea of Quality, you're out. Banned. And probably verbally abused. I didn't notice the same treatment of applicants at Fuck You, but I didn't delve as deep there. Plus, they appear to be very new and only have a handful of members.  I thought I had figured out what made the Flickers tick, but then an application chock full of Lynch and Kubrick was rejected, so I guess they are a Different kind of pretentious.  I can be pretentious too! I should make you all post lists so that I can decide whether you can be my friends. Won't that be fun?  (The answer is "No.")  I went and checked out the Fuckers, expecting to hate them only slightly less. Unfortunately for my hate-on, the leader of the community liked  Ravenous , so I might have to just settle for hating Flick You.  In the interest of the last hour and a half of my life not being a  total  waste of time, I would like you to post your lists. However, it will not have any effect on whether you are allowed to be my friend. That would be stupid.  Your choice: Top ten directors and the top ten films not by those directors  or  top 20 films overall. The criteria for these lists is entirely up to you. A brief explanation of said criteria would be appreciated (e.g. "personal favorites," "best direction," etc.). Commentary on your selections is fine but not required. A different list altogether is also fine, just say what the list is (it would help if it were film-related, of course).

      (As opposed to an atypical conversation.)  Last night in bed, whilst discussing my, er, penchant for older men and systematically going through the WB cast of stars to try to find me a nice young thing:  Will: Well, now, Lindsey. If he'd just get a haircut. Me: I know! So cute. What a waste. Will: That's why Angel hated him so much. He couldn't stand anyone having worse hair than him. Me: And it clearly tore Lorne apart. Will: "A  flunky ?" "Your hair ruined my show." Me: But wouldn't Angel  want  someone on the cast with worse hair, as a foil? Will: No! Angel has to be the most angsty, hence the worst hair. Me: ... Will: Like Robert Smith. Me: [ hysterical laughter ] Me: Even Morrissey never had hair as bad as Robert Smith. Will: Yeah, he had that pompadour. I liked that. Me: It wasn't a very  good  pompadour, but still... Will: Not Dawson's Creek? Me: Oh, god no.  [Note: young = under 40.]

      My apologies for my box office obsession over the weekend. I've moved on. As to my childish hate-on for Steven Spielberg, we shall see. That bastard tried to cut me off in traffic once, you know. Not to mention the goddamn walky-talkies.  It's come to my attention that I live a very strange life. I cannot deny this.  We went horseback riding yesterday with Rian and Cassie. I am achy and bruised. As we headed back to the stables we passed a group going the opposite direction. The last horse carried a man roughly twice my age (perhaps a bit less) with a fine mustache. He turned completely around in his saddle and stared at me as I passed him. It was a bit unnerving, but  terribly  flattering. Unless he was just astonished at the awkwardness of my seat - my stirrups were a touch too long and I'd gotten banged up terribly when I finally convinced my horse to run. But he probably just thought I was pretty.  Anyone good with resumes? I am great at writing/editing them for other people, but making my own sound even halfway decent is a skill I do not possess.

      So,  Dodgeball  took in close to $12 million on Friday. Almost twice as much as  The Terminal , which makes me laugh. I laugh at you, Steven Spielberg! Motherfucker. I laugh at you, Dreamworks! Fuckers.  Ahem.  Today's box office numbers aren't up yet. I am going CRAZY waiting. I'm refreshing, refreshing, refreshing that page, but nothing.  It seems silly to say that a little comedy about people getting hit by dodgeballs is so important, but it is. Will  found  this script. He championed this movie and made sure the "important" people read it. And besides, it's really damn funny.  If you haven't seen  Dodgeball  yet, go see it. Now.

      All this time I thought it was "I  guess  the rain's down in Africa." Reading the lyrics has totally changed that song for me, and I do not know if I am a man or a woman.  Hee.  I woke up around 9:45 this morning to an empty bed and was convinced that it was a weekday and Will had left for work. I was so depressed! Then I was so happy when I realized he was just in the living room, playing Vice City. I made some coffee and walked him through the hidden packages. (He's beat the game, and started over because we'd had some difficulty with the packages before.)  Having the new TV has not only made the picture quality on everything a thousand times better (and three times bigger!) but has also enabled us to open up the living room significantly by pushing the couch back against the wall. I removed all of the clutter, making the office quite a disaster area but the main living area delightful to be in. Now if I could just get some more bookshelves, a four drawer filing cabinet, and do something about the bedroom. Oh, and I need tons of picture frames. Oh, and S-Video cables for the DVD player. And  The Sound of Music.   That reminds me, everyone needs to know that Heath is the most awesome guy ever! He sent Will the  urlLink Queen box set  randomly. We danced in the newly huge living room to "You're My Best Friend." Awwww.  *puke*   It is grey and dreary outside. In June! In Los Angeles! I am not complaining, as I actually like this weather, but it is kind of odd.

      "You don't have any friends."  Ahhh, but I will at about 5:00 this afternoon! I hope.  First, a little story.  I didn't see  Fellowship of the Ring  in a theater when it was first released. I'm not complaining - I saw an Academy screener on a big screen TV with an excellent sound system while lounging on a couch in a movie star's office. (The movie star was not in attendance.) I then saw the extended DVD several dozen times at home. Last December when the ArcLight Cinema screened the extended cut a few weeks before  Return of the King  opened, we went to see Boromir die on the big screen. I cried, of course. But more importantly, I noticed something I'd never seen on the DVD. There is a shot, only a few seconds long, of a beautiful landscape. What I didn't know was that  all nine members of the Fellowship  are in the background of the shot. Fucking 19" television! It was then that I became determined to upgrade. Finances, however, conspired against this fond wish of mine.  Well, not anymore. This afternoon Jenn will be driving me to Best Buy (she has a truck) to purchase a Toshiba 32" flatscreen television. If they have it in stock. I just hung up the phone after a frustrating attempt to reach someone in the electronics department. It rang and rang and rang, then the automated voice took me back to the menu and I re-selected the correct department and it rang and rang and rang. Repeat process for ten minutes. Those fuckers had better be helping other customers.  Now, to rearrange my entire living room!

      I am eating the most succulant strawberries right now. They're very large, and usually large strawberries are sort of  blah , so I saved the bitty sweet ones for when Will is home, but the big ones are SO GOOD. I am also eating a slice of really good sourdough with super-sharp Vermont cheddar. Someone would have told me if I'd died and gone to heaven...right? Because everything so far this week points to me being dead. I mean, the Best Buy windfall, the  Dodgeball  premiere, this food! Heaven is nice.

      Coming this Friday to a theater near you (unless you live outside of the U.S., you poor bastard).  Review coming soon, maybe.  To settle the long-running debate: Jason Bateman is about 5'9, and very convenient to have directly in front of you when exiting a theater. Hmm. Maybe 5'10. I am so bad at judging height when wearing anything other than my sneakers.  In short, see this movie.

      I just received a $500 Best Buy gift card. FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS. All I did was fill out some survey that I'd forgotten about.  Holy shit!  New television, here I come.

      OK, I admit it. I like Montel Williams. Sometimes I'll tune in for the 9:00 airing of his show, which I believe is always a rerun. This morning it was a show I've seen before, and it pissed me off just as much today as the first time. The guests were all parents who'd made controversial decisions and were being criticized by friends and/or family. Most of what passes these days as controversial parenting is ideas that have been around for ever  but have shifted out of the "norm" in western cultures. You know, whacky ideas like breast-feeding and limiting television. Oh, and let's not forget  paying attention  and  treating your children like human beings.  Montel had three guests (plus their critics), and only one of them was employing what I would personally consider weird parenting - she had forbidden her children to date until age 18 (not so weird) and interrogated all of their friends as to their sexual activity (rude), wishing to keep her children from having non-virgin friends (understandable in a way as they were 13 and 14, but awfully difficult to monitor). I'm not really going to discuss her, because I tend to agree that privacy shouldn't be invaded, even if it is your  child . There is a line and I think this woman crossed it.  The other two guests, though. Montel has me hopping mad. The issues themselves are indeed controversial, but only, as I said, in recent years. One woman said that she and her husband still sleep with their 8-year-old son, the other had refused to inoculate her baby. Perhaps I am biased as my family had a family bed and I received no vaccines until I was 12. However, I have also read up on both topics and the arguments on  both sides  of the issues are compelling. The real problem, I think, was with Montel's choice of guests. The woman who slept with her son was about the most over-protective ninny I've ever heard of (she wouldn't let her son use public men's rest rooms, forcing him to accompany her into the ladies') and the girl who wouldn't get her baby's shots was a teen mother and about as white trash as they come. Way to promote stereotypes, Montel! Jerk. That would be like having a show about homeschooling and only have religious fanatics as your guests. Oh, wait. Every talk show that has ever addressed homeschooling has treated it as something only crazy people do. (By the way, I was homeschooled.)  So the guests' arguments were far from compelling, because neither of them was able to prove that they had thought their parenting choices through. They seemed like crazy reactionaries who simply would not listen to reason. How are people going to be educated on alternative choices when the people promoting them are idiots?  I thought you were better than that, Montel.  It doesn't really surprise me when the average American thinks that measles, mumps and rubella is a serious threat, that family beds are weird, and that homeschooling is only for problem children (or problem parents). But most of the people I've encountered with these views - particularly those with a poor impression of homeschooling - have been willing to listen with an open mind to my views. My own partner has gone from thinking that school is the only way to get an education and babies sleep in cribs to being the first to defend  our  choice to keep our kids as far away from school as possible (he goes back and forth on the family bed, but I am 99% certain that he just wants his space while he sleeps). I may have first leaned toward these choices because of my own upbringing, but I also did my research. I haven't said anything about inoculating our babies because I am just not sure yet what I think about it.

      I think my problems yesterday may have been due to the above. I haven't suffered PMS-y symptoms since I went on the pill, but I missed one at the beginning of this week (according to the literature, that presents no problems baby prevention-wise) so maybe my hormones got fucked up.  On the other hand, I might have been in such a pissy mood due to the unannounced postponement of  urlLink Ape 10 . I hope everything is all right in Azwood. I mean Vegas. I mean...whatever.*  Regardless of the reason for yesterday's moodiness, I'm feeling better today, if a little bit snippy.  * EDIT.  Whoopsie! That sounded so rude. I really, truly meant to type " wherever ."

      There's a fire alarm going off in the hallway. I checked it (a cookie for you if you can guess what was in my hand when I opened the apartment door - hint: I am an ironic retard) and didn't see smoke. It is very loud.  Oh, thank god - someone turned it off. Maybe. It buzzed again for a couple seconds.  Exciting Culinary Fact o' the Day: frozen chicken bones cannot be broken with your bare hands. Oops.

      Oh, I lie. I am wearing pants. Unless you are British, as I am not wearing  under pants. Pants, pants, pants.  I started off the day with bad/weird dreams. It's possible that they were influenced by last night's viewing of  urlLink  She Creature  , but I can't remember them well enough to be sure. I imagine the part of the dream with severed limbs came from the dream sequence in the movie. Ugh.  I'm pissed off at my grandmother (enough to not bother calling her "Grammy" as she likes us to). My mother forwarded me an email from her, excerpted here:  What a wonderful weekend!  I loved every minute of it!  Especially seeing [K] walking across the stage to get her diploma.  My first grandchild to graduate!  I can't wait to see the photos.  I'm still pondering Annika's wedding.  The latest fare was $205., and I expect it will just keep going up.  Let me get this straight, now. I suck for not graduating, and the cheapest fair I have ever seen from the east coast to LA is not good enough? I understand that money is tough for her, but her tone says to me that as important as it was to see her first grandchild graduate from college, seeing her first grandchild wed is just optional. If it were anyone else I'd be sure that I was overreacting, but my grandmother is the most selfish, judgmental person I know. I call her every year on her birthday, despite the fact that she never calls me, but I am thinking about skipping it this year (if I have not already missed it - I can't find my birthday book). What an email to get when I was already grumpy! (As an aside - Mom, stop sending email with attachments to my MSN account. It's full.)  I am also annoyed with Will's mother, but what else is new?  At least I do not have to get dressed today.

      I used to have the biggest pervy-old-lecher crush on Philippe. He was only about two years younger than me, which isn't so bad until you consider that I met him when I was 18. One day I drove to his (private!) high school, found his car in the parking lot and put a bumper sticker on it that was green and said "Visualize Whirled Peas." I liked it so much that after he found out it was me I got one for my own car. I never planned to do anything about my crush and honestly had no interest in pursuing it anyway, but  man , was he cute! He totally knew I had the hots for him, too. Bastard.

      So, conservative bloggers are in a tizzy over Morrissey being  urlLink an insensitive prick . My response: Yeah,  so ? This is the man who gleefully sang that the Queen is dead (she isn't), the man who wears black on the outside 'cause black is how he feels on the inside. The man who wore a bouquet of branches and weeds in his back pocket and oscillated wildly at Smiths shows (seriously, I have video to prove it). The man who has a thing for Fatty.  I don't agree with Morrissey's death wish for the President. But I don't agree with him about much else, so I simply do not see the big deal. I just like his music.  On the other hand,  urlLink Annie  made me snort with laughter:  i'm pleased to announce that legislation has just been signed, which will outlaw Morissey forever. The bombing begins in five minutes. See? I don't agree with her either, but I still like her.

      That isn't true, but I had a moment of sheer terror a little while ago. I was looking through some photos of someone else's wedding (I don't know the person whose wedding it was, and only know the photographer through her online journal, but nevermind) and one of them was captioned "Attendants arrange the dress so [bride] can sit down." Now, it was a beautiful dress. But the thought of there ever being an occasion for which I would willingly wear a dress that  prevented me from sitting down ...  Then I remembered that I already have a dress, and it will never prevent me from any such thing. Phew! Crisis averted.

      So, I just found  urlLink Books For Soldiers , via  urlLink Wil Wheaton . It is an amazing organization that coordinates people who want to help our troops (that's you and me) with troops in need of books, movies, et cetera. All you need is money for postage (within the US - packages go to US bases and are shipped to the soldiers) and books, magazines, or whatever that are just cluttering up your home. Letters and postcards are also most welcome. Some of the soldiers make specific requests for favorites, but most of them just want  anything  to pass the time. Some of the requests are for practical items - one soldier from the National Guard wrote that her unit was low on supplies because the "real" soldiers are higher priority, and she desperately needed batteries (for flashlights, gutter-brains). Another asked for candy to give the Iraqi children. There were a LOT of requests for sunscreen, bug spray and snacks. A man from a K-9 unit asked for dog booties to protect his dogs' feet in the desert.  As I learned last fall, packages to "Any Soldier" are no longer accepted for security reasons. This is a terrific work-around if you do not personally know deployed soldiers. (By the way, while "Soldier" only refers to the Army, this website serves all military branches.)  I've put a permanent button link in the sidebar. It is currently below my birthday countdown, because anything you send to the troops is as good as two presents for me. (But I have not completely lost my mind. I still like presents.)

       urlLink Seattle Post-Intelligencer: AP - U.S.: Levee breaks in California, floods fields   I guess I have no place to stay. Or something.  Also of interest (but probably only to Angelinos -- aww, who am I kidding, non-Angelinos probably don't care about our water supply too terribly much either*), the origin of "Sig-Alerts."  From the  urlLink California State Homepage :  "Sig-Alerts" are unique to Southern California. They came about in the 1940s when the L.A.P.D. got in the habit of alerting a local radio reporter, Loyd Sigmun, of bad car wrecks on city streets. These notifications became known as "Sig-Alerts." Later Mr. Sigmon developed an electronic device that authorities could use to alert the media of disasters. Caltrans latched on to the term "Sig-Alert" and it has come to be known as any traffic incident that will tie up two or more lanes of a freeway for two or more hours. And, yes, Mr. Sigmon is still around and very proud of his namesake. Sadly, the last sentence is no longer true. Mr. Sigmon died today at age 95. Also sad is the State of California's inability to fact-check or be consistent in their spelling.  The Los Angeles Times** gives a more detailed history of the Sig-Alert's early incarnation, matching the brief explanation I heard on NPR: A SigAlert, issued when one or more lanes will be blocked for at least half an hour, originally warned of other dangers. On Labor Day 1955, the first SigAlert was broadcast by six radio stations warning of a train wreck near Union Station.  Other early bulletins included five warnings of rabid dogs and a ship collision in Los Angeles Harbor.  One time, a pharmacist who made a potentially fatal error in filling a prescription called police, who issued a SigAlert. The customer heard it in time. I think that last story is great - it inspired me to look up the news story and write about it.  *That came out wrong. It isn't that I don't think you  care , just that it isn't that important even to me. I just took advantage of the opportunity to paraphrase Zeppelin. **Story is  urlLink here  and requires (free) registration.

      I bought something at Target this morning that scanned at a higher price than the shelf price, and the girl at the checkout took my word for it and just keyed in the correct price. That act of kindness, even though I would have stood to lose only a few moments for a price check, made my day. And it kept getting better.  I made lunch and brought it to Will's office, where we ate together. His 10-hour work days are less awful for both of us with a midday interruption. Sadly, all of the offices are separated by glass, so we couldn't eat anything but lunch.  On returning home I picked up the mail, which contained a letter from our dear friend Blair and a package from John containing the Chicago Tribune's  Angel  tribute and a DVD of  Lonesome Dove , the best western ever. And to think, I was just last week saying to suki that I ought to get it in a form other than VHS! John's reason for buying it for us is "I was in Wal-Mart." I love that guy. I was tremendously amused by the "Special Features" listing on the DVD, which included "Fullscreen Presentation." I had that split second of annoyance because I [heart] widescreen before thinking,  Of COURSE it's fullscreen, asscarts! It's a MADE-FOR-TV movie!  (Even funnier is the fact that John had the  exact same reaction  in the store.)  Netflix shipped  The Return of the King  this morning. Cancel all weekend plans, buy tissues.  It's only a few things, but individually they each equal  urlLink happiness with a small h , and put together it sure  feels  like Happiness with a big H.

      The religious right is amusing the hell out of me lately. Remember last year, when the objection to gay marriage was that it would inevitably lead to beastiality and polygamy? That was so funny, but the latest is even better. One might say it's a laugh riot.  Apparently, even the  debate  over gay marriage is detrimental to society. Because of it, abortion rates are up and - get this - so are obesity levels. There is "proof."  This is so great! I need to call all of my gay friends (not to mention those gay-friendly traitors) and thank them for making me a fat baby-killer.  Don't think that I've forgotten that gay marriage not only removes the sanctity of marriage but also destroys families. I just can't write about it because I am so depressed that my own marriage and family are doomed, even though we are good little heterosexuals.

       urlLink Yahoo! News - $132K of Grant to Combat Goth Returned : "'You have to admit if you saw one, two, three, four or more people dressed in traditional Goth, it would be discerning,' she said."  My father sent me this ridiculous article, pointing out that in the above sentence, it is hopeful that the woman meant to say "disconcerting." Of course, she's a twinkie either way.  And I would like to add that it would most certainly be disconcerting to see even one person dressed in  traditional  goth, which I am certain that not one resident of Blue Springs has ever seen.

      It is completely against my nature to draw attention away from my birthday, but I have been reading some arguments regarding abortion and I got confused. I would post this on the WD, where there is a wider variety of people with extensive collective knowledge, but I will be DAMNED if I am going to be responsible for starting up any abortion debates. Besides, I know my readers are very intelligent.  Here is part of the argument that confused me. It is from the comments on a blog entry. The writer is questioning the blogger's choice (heh) to participate in the March for Women's Lives last month.  I just don’t understand how you could march with people who are willing to do such evil things to ensure that women can have abortions - like putting more power in the hands of the federal government - forcing people to subsidize abortions, etc.  Maybe I am just very, very naive, but it sounds to me like this guy (it is a guy, if that matters at all) is saying that it is OK for abortion to be illegal but it isn't OK to make sure it stays legal because that gives the government power. HUH? And as for subsidizing abortions, it's a  medical procedure.  I honestly do not know what his point is.  The blog post is  urlLink here  and the comment in question is the first one.  Please 'splainy.

      I love my birthday.  Loooooooove  it. Love, love LOVE it! My entire life I have celebrated not just the one day that is the anniversary of my birth but several weeks (sometimes months) leading up to and surrounding it. The only holiday all year that I like more than my birthday is Christmas, and that is mostly because "Santa Baby" sounds silly the rest of the year, and I get odd looks if I am caught watching  White Christmas  11 months out of the year. (Oh, OK, it is really because I love making other people happy and Christmas is the perfect occasion for an overdose of cheer.)  But back to my birthday.  It is on July 6th, which is a Tuesday this year. I will be celebrating in the normal fashion, by opening lots of presents, squealing a lot, and eating sushi. I am really very excited.  I made myself wait until after Memorial Day to start my celebration. Well, it's after Memorial Day and you'll find a countdown on the sidebar, beneath the Archives. You will also find a link to my Amazon.com wishlist. As selfish as I am in regard to my birthday, I  do not  expect pressies. I merely wish to make it easier on those of you who were already planning to get me a little something. I've ranked every item on the list but there isn't anything on there that I don't want.  Yay! It's my birthday!

       Alternate title: Please don't kill me, Suki.  When Will does his Seth Bullock impression, he makes big ol' bug eyes to get across Mr. Olyphant's facial expression. Yes, singular. But I realized on further viewings of  Deadwood  that he isn't bug-eyed.  He never squints.  Seriously, even when he is grinning or grimacing, his eyelids do not move. I have not yet noticed him blinking, but plan to do further research before deciding that he is definitely a robot. Don't get me wrong - he's a very cute maybe-robot. But his eyes really scare the bejeezus out of me.

       superfood   This post is named after my drink, to which I dedicate my entire day, maybe my weekend, and possibly even the entire week.  Deee-lish.  In honor of my vastly improved (times ten thousand) mood, here are some pictures of me. As always, click the thumbnail for a bigger version.  1. New hair and...   urlLink    ...new glasses. While Amanda totally made my day by saying I couldn't get any cuter, I believe you will find that it simply isn't true.  2. Puppies! Me and Penny napping.   urlLink    I think that being as cute as Penny (or me, for that matter) should be illegal.  Now I really do have to finish cleaning the kitchen (at least I started!) because we are having a guest this weekend. It was sort of unplanned and I was all set to be righteously annoyed, but then I got this drink and I feel soooooooooo goooooooood.

      Yesterday I cleaned the living room so thoroughly that it sparkles. Even the carpet. Today I meant to do the kitchen/entry way (let's be honest here, the entry is just spill-off from the kitchen). But I don't  wanna.      Also, I'm kinda depressed 'cause we had money for about five seconds and now it's (almost) all gone.    BUT! I got a very cute haircut. I will post pictures soonish, but not until something that I ordered arrives. Something that will make me  even cuter .    But for now, though I am cute, and though I have Nero Wolfe novels from the library, and though I ate cheese fries, which I love, I am discontent. Will isn't home and I don't want to clean my kitchen (especially after making cheese fries).  You know what? I do believe I am grumpy.

      I killed American Airlines, O'Hare, and the President.    I am in jail.    Please send money for bail. They won't actually let me post bail or talk to a lawyer yet, but hopefully they will soon - and if not, I can use the money to buy cigarettes to trade with Gina, who seems to be in charge here. She looks kinda like Jenette Goldstein in  Aliens . I like her. Alas, I think she likes me, if you know what I mean.     I don't know where I am, but based on the smell of the small amount of air we get every morning, I am thinking Guantanamo.

      American Airlines and Chicago O'Hare are now my sworn enemies.  I'm supposed to pick John up at LAX at 11:08 tonight. Yay! Yeah, not really. Because it is now 9:47 and his plane has NOT LEFT CHICAGO YET. Luckily, he emailed me earlier to let me know it was raining pretty hard and his flight might be delayed. But this does not qualify as a delay. This is SABOTAGE. American Airlines, O'Hare, and George W. Bush have conspired to ruin my night. Every time I check the flight status page, the estimated arrival time has been pushed later. It is currently estimated for landing at 2:11 AM, and since it hasn't left yet I doubt it will be that early.  I have to get up around 7:00 tomorrow morning.  Oh, did I mention that John usually checks his luggage? Oh wait - maybe he doesn't. I can't remember. But if he does...  I am going to murder SOMEONE, as soon as I figure out who.

      It feels very strange having people over to a house other than your own. I felt like my parents were away and the whole school showed up with kegs.  &nbsp;  Except, it's Meghan and Mark, not my parents, there were no kegs, and it was just Jenn and Roxanne, who are also friends with Meghan.  &nbsp;  I haven't been in a hottub in years. My back thanks whoever invented them - I haven't felt this relaxed in for-fucking-ever. I slept like a baby. Er, a baby who sleeps very soundly. Pretty Penny was quite forgiving of me for stumbling out of bed after ten this morning and making coffee before walking her. Such a good dog. It will be very difficult to go home on Saturday and leave her.  &nbsp;  I miss my husband. Boyfriend. Fiancé. Damn it! Whatever. I can't wait for the wedding so that I'll know what to call him.  &nbsp;  Speaking of the wedding, we've sent off the information to our friend Emmy for the invitations. She has a letterpress and does truly gorgeous work. I hope the wording is not too silly - getting married in a movie theatre, we've gone whole hog with the Premiere theme. Formal-ish, but not very wedding-y. Alan, one of Will's best friends, did a line drawing of the theatre for us. I haven't seen it yet, and the anticipation is driving me insane. I know it'll be stunning, as all of his work is, but I don't know just what it will look like.  &nbsp;  On Saturday I went to get my dress fitted. Driving back, I realized that This Is It.  We're getting married!  I stopped feeling overwhelmed by planning (for about five minutes) and was just excited. Delightful feeling. Now if I could just figure out what the hell to do with my hair. (Any suggestions? I will NOT be wearing a veil, but am open to simple decorations.) It also occurs to me that I'd better learn how to put on make-up before October. I'm sure as hell not paying someone to do it for me, and besides which at my age I ought to have some clue what to do with rouge.  &nbsp;  I worry that I'm making a mistake not hiring a professional photographer. It's just that there are so many talented photographers in my family, so I feel that we'll be covered. But maybe we should have someone there for just the photos. I don't know!  &nbsp;  Can anyone tell me if the home teeth-whitening kits work (Crest White Strips and the like)?  &nbsp;  In conclusion, next time we'll just go to an Elvis Chapel in Vegas and skip all this hoopla.

      (Hee. If Vincent D'Onofrio shows up, I will be  so psyched. )  &nbsp;  Miss Penny is a delightful companion, but completely insane. For example, the computer desk is a few feet away from the bed; if she is on the bed and I sit down at the computer chair, she looks at me reproachfully till I pat my lap for her to come over. Not crazy yet, I know. But she will sit at the edge of the bed and cry until I roll the chair over close enough for her to jump. She won't get down on the floor and then jump up onto my lap! Crazy. And I know I am not helping things by giving in, but I can't help it! At least I am making her Sit before allowing her to come up on the furniture, and when it is time to put on her leash, and especially for treats (which have medicine hidden in them, but don't tell her that). She has also been trying to eat leaves and bugs - I think she might have mistaken herself for a cat.  &nbsp;  I should say that I am the perfect match for her, being batshit insane myself. This morning I was not yet awake when I walked her and forgot to bring a baggy. She pooped, and I took her back to the house where I got a bag and went back out. But could I find her poop? Let's just leave it at 'no' and be happy no one got my running commentary as I looked for it on tape.  &nbsp;  Ahhh, poo stories. I imagine that by the time I have my own babies you will have all stopped reading this in disgust.  &nbsp;  Wedding update later if I get my act together. (Speaking of...OK, totally unrelated, my apologies to the folks on my mailing list. I can't send updates because I have no idea what my notifylist password is. I am an ass.)

      Somehow, I managed to spend all day Friday thinking it was the 14th, despite having spent all day Thursday  knowing  it was the 14th. And of course, the 15th, which didn't exist in my head, was my dear evil twin's birthday. Maybe if it never happened, you are still 25, my beloved Miss Twist.

      In a little while I am heading to Meghan and Mark's place to spend the week with Miss Penny. I am very excited, if a bit uncertain about sleeping away from Will for even one night. I will be online, but I have no idea if I will be able to access my email. It's a tremendous adventure! Also, I have heard a rumor that there will be cable television. I may get addicted - they start you off for free until they hook you, you know. Then it's a million dollars a month just to have more programs that you don't feel like watching. Yikes! I hope I can resist.    All joking aside, it will be interesting to live with someone else's kitchen for the week. I am so very used to my own. I don't even know what to bring! Probably nothing right now - I can figure out what I need and pick it up later. I am so silly sometimes.    Bisy. Backson.

      I got a postcard on Tuesday from UPS telling me that they'd attempted delivery of a package three times and were now holding it downtown.  Knowing that I'd been home on all three days, I called UPS to find out what the hell was up. They gave me the times of the delivery attempts and I was positive I'd been home. They also told me that it was an  overnight air  package, which means that someone paid for express shipping and didn't get it.  Two weeks ago, the building manager requested our phone number to reprogram the intercom system. The first delivery attempt was one week ago, which is surely more than enough time to have gotten the intercom working (especially when they should have had our phone number in their files to begin with).  So I went down to the office and asked if the intercom was working. The manager wasn't in and the man sitting at the desk was a surly type and told me that if I'd given my phone number, it was working. I didn't believe him at all, and checked myself. It seemed to work, but it was hard to tell since  I wasn't home to answer.  I called UPS, fingers crossed, and asked them to re-deliver.  As of 9:15 this morning, I am the owner of John Linnel's  State Songs . Yay! This lovely gift comes from Mister Simon Ball, who I most sincerely hope did not pay extra for shipping. Thank you, Simon!  The arrival of this CD prompted me to come up with an idea for a bumper sticker:  My Other Husband is a John.  It has so many meanings! I am brilliant.

      Dear  urlLink Paula Danziger ,  Thank you for the books.  Thank you for always being so very nice to me when you came to talk at the elementary school. You told me once that I was a great reporter. I must have been , because the newspaper only lasted the one year I was the editor. Thank you for encouraging us all to write.  Thank you for making growing up easier, knowing that we had an ally, a grown-up who really got what it was like to be a kid. Thank you for being honest about your imperfections. It was easier to be pleased with what I saw in the mirror knowing that Marcy was fat and she learned to like herself, and knowing that Cassie had asthma and Rosie and Phoebe were jealous and Kendra's expectations too high, and none of them knew how to behave around boys.  Thank you for capturing the towns I grew up in so perfectly. Thank you for loving them so much. Whenever I think I hated growing up there, I can just read The Divorce Express again and see how much Phoebe's father loves Woodstock, and her mother loves New York, and she loves both, and I remember.  Thank you for loving bad jokes and purple and felt-tip markers.  I'm really sorry that you had to go.  Love, Annika

      You know my axe-murdering friend on the roof? Didn't exist.   No , I didn't make him up.  But I was right about sound being distorted at night around here - turns out there was a couple across the street, in the  complete opposite direction , who deemed 1:00 in the morning an appropriate time to unload their moving truck. Granted, they were doing so pretty quietly and I sympathized (I hate moving), but his furniture dolly scraping the concrete of the driveway was the noise I heard.  Or maybe it was a coincidence and there was an axe murderer as well. Who knows? All I'm sure of is that when Will woke up this morning and opened the porch door, he had to unlock it and remove the bolt (which we never use). Like I said - I'm not stupid.  In other news, I ought to go buy juice.

      So, my site is back up and I fixed my email account, except for one tiny detail: I am not receiving mail. That combined with the mystery person wandering around on the roof of my building at 1:00 in the morning is enough to make me retreat to the bedroom and bang my head against the wall until I lose consciousness. Wait - the bathroom. That way I won't wake Will up  and  I can lock myself in, just in case the guy on the roof is an axe murderer. (Of course, the bathroom door would be no match for an axe, so nevermind.)  There's this Tom Waits song. The refrain goes something like, "What's he  building  in there?" Come to think of it, that's probably the title of the song as well, but I can't go downstairs and check because there is a man on the roof and it sounds like he is pushing around a supermarket trolley and maybe banging it into the air conditioning vents thingies.  What's he  building  out there?  That song always made me think of "The Thing Without A Name."  I should probably be scared, or at least cautious. The phone is downstairs, and the closest thing I have to a weapon is my coffee mug, now empty from a cup of hot chocolate I brought upstairs with me. It's a pretty damn heavy mug, anyway.  But seriously, I am not worried. It is probably a cat - noises are magnified at night. But I did grab the phone. I'm not stupid.  There are times when, as a WD moderator, I would like to reach through my computer and grab certain members of the board and smash their heads together. Though my title has nothing to do with that sentiment, it is apt.  I am thirsty. And it is late. I will probably go to bed shortly.

      Email not working. Entire server down. Not informed that everything would have to be redone (except actual site) until AFTER I inquired about the fact that I couldn't log into my email. Very annoyed.  If anyone should need to reach me today, call me. I am not speaking to the internet right now (except in the obvious making-a-blog-entry way). Oh, fine, I am also checking my Watchers Diary email. I'm sure you all urgently need to be in contact with me (not).  But Will is home with a stomach bug, so I might just shut off the computer, turn on the air conditioning, and lay down.  On the other hand, I need the computer because I have to write a letter to Will's dentist explaining why exactly it is that when they  say  something is covered by his insurance, in fact  promise  that it is, and then it isn't, they are complete ASSHOLES for billing us for it and even bigger jerks if they think they can have our business anymore.  Oddly, I am in a fairly good mood. I know it doesn't show, but there you go.

      When I was a kid, I read Nancy Drew stories. It isn't my fault, I didn't know any better, and anyway they are very entertaining and not nearly as awful as the Hardy Boys.  I knew about Sherlock Holmes but never read any of the books because  Young Sherlock Holmes  had terrified me as a child and I wasn't about to give  him  any second chances.  I did not know who Nero Wolfe was until I was around 23 years old.  I was living in Chicago and one evening my roommate was either out of the house or otherwise distracted, so I snagged the remote control. We paid for cable (the only time in my life I've done so) because our apartment didn't get reception for Buffy and Angel - and may I just say, it is a sad day when you need cable to watch a Network series. So I flipped around a bit. Usually back then if I was flipping channels I'd settle on Food Network (or Style if Nigella was on) or PBS (I'm not a snob, I just like looking at pretty stuff!), but that evening I stopped at A&E. A  Nero Wolfe Mystery  was just starting, and I remembered Will telling me it was a great series. Besides, Timothy Hutton. It could have been the Worst Show Ever and I might have been persuaded to give it a shot.  The Episode was  The Doorbell Rang , which I italicize because each episode is like a movie. Fans will know that episode as the first, but I caught a repeat airing - it was in fact just prior to the start of season 2.  So I moved to Los Angeles where Will had, er, "borrowed" cable, and we watched most of season 2. Then the cable was shut off and the series was cancelled and that was that.  We've borrowed a lot of the Rex Stout novels from the library, and they are wonderful - and quick reads.  Well, both seasons are now available on DVD, and Will gave me season 1 (only $33 at  urlLink DeepDiscountDVD.com ) in the morning on my birthday this past Tuesday. Being cable, it's a fairly short season, and I've watched every episode at least once already.  Around 5:00 on Tuesday a gentleman named Mike called to say he had an orchid to deliver for me. An orchid?! How appropriate! Nero Wolfe grows orchids - they are his passion. It's a Phalaenopsis and is just lovely. I took a picture just now - it is soaking up indirect light on our porch right now.     I'm afraid you can't quite see how truly lovely this orchid is - it's late afternoon and there was backlighting in pretty much every direction that didn't involve a necessity for me to stand on my head or similar.

       urlLink Movie & TV News @ IMDb.com - WENN   (You will have to scroll down, but I quote in full.)     Hawke Marriage Meltdown Inspired 'Sunset' Script  Ethan Hawke's shock split from wife Uma Thurman inspired the bittersweet musings of his character Jesse in eagerly-anticipated sequel Before Sunset. According to director Richard Linklater, when he, Hawke and leading lady Julie Delpy got together to collaborate on the screenplay, the Training Day hunk was aiming to 'blur the line between performer and character'. And Linklater admits he found the plot, in which Jesse tells old flame Celine how he is trapped in a loveless marriage because of his children, 'scary'. Linklater explains, 'It was a little scary. Current events had caught up with us. To Ethan's credit, I think it informed the making of the film. It definitely informed some of his feelings.' Dear Dick,  Read the fucking dictionary. Its definition of "inform" does not match yours. I expect you to issue a retraction and an apology for your butchery of the English language.

      I ask because I've been meeting a lot of girls lately who, like me, are engaged and I have noticed one particular trait that their engagement rings have in common: Poor quality diamonds. Now. People may recall that I didn't even  want  a diamond at first - I asked for a ruby, but it turns out that most rubies these days are man-made and have poor color (as in, fluorescent pink). I also asked, once I'd settled on a diamond, for a quarter carat. I didn't care so much about color and clarity - I'm not perfect, why should my diamond be?  Well, I wound up with a perfect (at least to the naked eye) diamond that is just under half a carat. It sparkles just right and the setting is the loveliest I've ever seen.  Right after we became engaged, a co-worker of Will's asked his girl to marry him. He gave her a three stone ring, and the center stone must be at  least  a carat-and-a-half. The side stones are nearly as large. I saw it in "mood" lighting at a party, so I have no idea what quality the diamonds were, but I remember thinking that it was awfully garish. Another of his co-workers just got married and her husband bought her a one carat diamond. It's sort of milky white and looks...dirty. A girl in a shop I went to last week wore a nicely sized three stone ring. Again, milky, dirty diamonds.  Why size over quality? My ring cost under a thousand dollars (in fact, around one week's salary - but how vulgar of me to disclose that) and is classy.  I guess I just don't understand the need for a big diamond. It isn't a status symbol, really - is it? And if so, isn't quality  just  as important as size, if not more so?  I don't get it.

      Thanks to everyone who sent birthday wishes my way. I wish I could say it was a happy birthday, but in large part it was not. I'm still rather depressed and don't want to go into details. Since the only thing that would help is a rather large sum of money, please don't ask if you can do anything.  The good parts: Will and I had a  delicious  sushi lunch, and spent much of the evening watching my new  Nero Wolfe  DVDs. In a moment of rare second sight (unless it was coincidence) Will's parents sent me a gorgeous orchid. When I called to thank them, Will's mother assured me that even I could not kill it. We shall see. I'm doing all right in the resuscitation (again) of my fuchsia, so maybe she is right. I also received a miniature rose bush from Meghan and Mark. It is beautiful, and will most likely be the third rose bush that meets its end at my hand. I really don't know what is wrong with me - I had quite a green thumb as a child. My favorite gift by far (at least inasmuch as the giggles it produces from me every time I look at it) is the Punky Monkey t-shirt Jenn gave me. It's pink! And it has a Punky Monkey! I'll try to remember to take a picture. There were also several DVDs and some nice coffee accessories, and probably other things I am forgetting.  Speaking of forgetting, it's time to remove the countdown.  I'm going to go take some more B vitamins and try to force myself to eat now.

      The first time I ever ate an egg sandwich was somewhere in the middle of Delaware in March or April of 1997. Melanie and I were driving from her mom's house in Maryland to our house in upstate New York. The kids were asleep in their car chairs in the back seat and she pulled off the highway to stop at a little deli/convenience store/news stand type of place with a sign for egg sandwiches. The kind of store that you can only find on the east coast as far as I know.  I was dubious, as I only really liked my eggs scrambled and particularly disliked them fried. Runny yokes were my enemy. But I was hungry and Mel swore that a fried egg and cheese sandwich was the best food on earth, so I tried one. I think I only ate about half of that first one, and found it to be all right.  Fast forward to fall of 1999. Will and I have moved to New York and I'm working for Melanie again, taking care of Radha and Everett as well as her youngest, David. One day we stop at Cornucopia, a store down the street from Mel's house, for some food. They have egg sandwiches, which I admit I have thought about from time to time. Will has never had one, though I'm sure as a kid he ate a Toad-in-the-Hole or two. We each order one.  Heaven. They cook the eggs just right, in little frying pans over individual burners behind the deli counter. You can have sausage or bacon on your sandwich if you like. I'm sure Will had one or the other. They use  white  American cheese, which is awfully hard to find in the grocery store but does exist and is very good.  Melanie lived in Red Hook, but we lived about half an hour away in the absolute middle of nowhere, a town called Hillsdale. It's a long story that I might tell someday  why  we lived all the way out there, but our place was really nice. The second floor of a converted farmhouse, non-euclidean angles and creaky floorboards included free-of-charge. It was a short drive to Hudson or to Great Barrington, Massachusetts, where there was (respectively) a great camera store that we never visited due to lack of funds and a great Japanese restaurant that we infrequently visited for the same reason. The drive to Mel's took us down route 7 past many, many farms and a few cornfields and at least one apple orchard (where we went and picked a bucket of apples for $5 from which I made many delicious pies). The town nearest the orchard was a tiny place with barely anything town-like except for an old, beautiful Opera House with a 'For Sale' sign on it. Will and I dreamed of buying it and living in the shack next to it (fixed up, of course) and showing old movies for a dollar for anyone who wanted to come by. Of course, we never did that. Across the street from the theater was an old gas station that one day got fixed up into a little store that sold coffee and newspapers and egg sandwiches. It was about a third of the way from our place to Melanie's, and I started stopping there almost every morning for an egg sandwich (though I usually brought my own coffee). I didn't think it possible, but theirs were the best egg sandwiches on earth. They, too, used white American cheese, and except for the one time that the girl put ketchup on my sandwich (salt & pepper  only , please) my breakfasts were perfect.  We eventually moved away from that farmhouse and lost the easily accessible egg sandwiches. When we were living apart, my roommate Yojo and I used to make them in the afternoons to eat while playing Canasta (we called it Conniption) or double solitaire. We really made Toad-in-the-Holes, but we called them egg sandwiches. We used multi-grain bread instead of white rolls with poppy seeds, but the sandwiches were very good. Occasionally we also would just fry bread and spread cilantro chutney on it.  In the past year or so I've started making egg sandwiches for Will and myself. I use potato hamburger buns and organic eggs and usually American cheese slices (the yellow sort, unfortunately).  Today was a deceptively long day. Meghan and Mark brought Miki and Penny over last night and much beer was consumed (only a small amount of it by the dogs). Poor Will slammed his finger in the door of the trash cute and woke up at 6:00 this morning in a fair bit of pain. I awoke shortly after 9:00 and convinced him to come back to bed, where he slept until about 11:30. A few cups of coffee later, he helped me carry some laundry downstairs. Then we prepared lunch which we shared with Geoff while talking about movies. I seasoned an enormous top sirloin steak which the boys split after Will seared it on the grill. He also roasted corn on the cob, and I made mashed potatoes and a salad. After we ate we enjoyed a glass of fine bourbon that Geoff had brought over. There was a few more hours of conversation (I did finish and fetch the laundry, lest anyone worry) before Geoff left and Will and I sat around, feeling fat and trying to decide what to do with our evening. Will was amiable to the idea of writing up a new (the first in two years!) Grumpy Critic, Angry Cook review, and put in  The Last Man on Earth . I came upstairs and wrote my previous entry. When I checked on Will a short while later he'd fallen fast asleep on the couch. I covered him (there was a cool breeze) and left him be until he woke up around 8:30. I asked if he was hungry, which he was. I offered cheese and salami but he made a face, so I suggested an egg sandwich.  I used the organic Colby cheese I'd bought at Whole Foods yesterday. I put away the laundry from earlier while he ate, and he came in to tell me that it was the Best Egg Sandwich Ever. He has come upstairs twice while I wrote this entry to tell me the same thing.

      So, I have a yeast infection. It isn't that bad. I actually had one a few months ago that went away on its own, but apparently didn't go away  completely , so I'm very annoyed. I probably  should  be annoyed with myself, because I didn't do anything to get rid of it the first time, but I hate unnecessarily medicating myself.  Well, this time I am using the Normal American method of ridding oneself of a yeast infection: over-the-counter suppositories.  Eeeeeeewwwwwwwwwwwwwww.  I've never used suppositories before. This is only the second yeast infection I've ever had (third if you count the one a few months ago separately) and the first time my herbalist friend gave me natural remedies that took care of it in swift order. Unfortunately I forget what herbs she gave me and I can't find her phone number. Besides, you don't call a friend you've been out of touch with for four years and say, "Yeah, gee, Lara, I miss you so much. How do I get rid of a yeast infection?"  So, the suppositories come with an applicator, not unlike a tampon applicator. I hate applicators for tampons, so I have no idea why I thought that this would be a good idea. Maybe because the applicator was longer than my finger, so I assumed it would put the medicine in the right place better than I could myself.   WRONG.   Let's just say that after one failed attempt, I rammed it up there manually and it worked just fine, but the leakage this morning was fucking disgusting.  And I have two more nights of this. Why didn't I buy the one-day treatment? Oh yeah, this one was fifty cents cheaper.

      Wedding invitations were delivered this morning. I have yet to see them. Technically, so does Will, even though they are in his office right this second, because he decided to wait to open the box until he gets home so that we can do it together.  When buying pork for stews, it is probably advisable to have the butcher cut the roasts into stew-sized bits. Doing it yourself is very time consuming and makes your hands sore and tired.  My graphic design skills are minimal.  After naming this post, I found an MP3 of DeVotchKa covering "Venus in Furs." Coincidence? Of course not. DeVotchKa is madly in love with me and even wrote a song about me ("Queen of the Surface Streets").  I still have not managed to put my filing cabinet together.  The oven has been on for nearly an hour and I still have not managed to put the peppers in to roast.  I forgot to buy cheese.  I changed the ink cartridges in my printer this morning. I think I am almost out of ink again.  I am tired. I am weary.  I wonder if Lou Reed knew about coffee. That's how I plan to fix my problems.

      Odwalla Superfood is a pre-packaged smoothie that humans of any age can drink. I know that the way I was carrying on about it I probably made it sound dangerously alcoholic, but it really isn't.  Busy Backson is indeed in  The Tao of Pooh , though I was referencing  The House at Pooh Corner , which is where the phrase originally appears. Also, there is probably  something  I don't know about, but it probably isn't very important.  One thing I know for sure: LUNCH.

      I heard those words many times last night.  Most  of those times, it was in reference to my cards.  At our Wednesday night poker game, I was the Queen of 7 Card Stud.  You have to understand that there is a $10 buy-in and I have never left with more than $3 at the end of the night. Total.  Last night I left with almost $20. My last hand of the night was a full house, Aces over Kings.  What's funny is that I'd arrived in a lousy mood. I was exhausted, had fallen asleep after my shower and not taken well to Will waking me up when he got home (he had to - I had to let him in the building), had a monster headache and bad hair, and just didn't feel like going anywhere.  But I did, which resulted in exposure to crappy traffic. Seriously, it took me 25 minutes to get to the highway (technically 30 but I swung through the Toxic Hell drive-through) and only 6 minutes from the on ramp to Rian's street, where I found parking immediately (the first Good Thing of the evening). And of course Ralph was happy to see me, which is always nice (as long as I don't stop to consider that he was really only happy to see my Taco Bell spoils).  Cassie and Meghan have both tried to take credit as my Good Luck Charm, since neither of them has been there before on the same night as me. Mark hasn't either, but he just sat there and good-naturedly let me win his money. And of course, Will wasn't there...  Rian and I are thinking of trying Doubles Poker, which I made up to justify our usual end-of-the-night cheating (things like swapping a random card); you play like normal except that you make the best hand out of both people's cards. We are also trying to get the rules amended to allow the 4-card straight, and possibly 3 pairs. So far no one seems to like any of our ideas.

       "Mark, will you be bothered if I take off my clothes?"  "No."   Mark runs away as quickly as possible to avoid seeing my boobies.   There was nothing improper, really - Mark is Meghan's husband, and Meghan and I were changing out of our bathing suits. But it was v. funny.  Shelby was here this weekend and we had a lovely time, destroying my theory that he is not exactly my favorite house guest. Yay! I didn't much care for that theory anyway.  We watched  Once Upon A Time in Mexico  last night. It didn't make very much sense. Will thought I meant that I wasn't able to follow it, but that isn't the case. I know exactly what happened, it just didn't make very much sense. I don't  care  - it was gorgeously shot and a ton of fun. Also, my favorite part was the 10 Minute Cooking School. Robert Rodriguez cooks like I do, and gives much the same advice about it.  Which reminds me, I now have two cookbooks I need to write.  In other news, I have decided that I want to replace our crappy loveseat with a daybed. Ikea has a nice one for a hundred bucks (plus mattress), and I've had good luck with their metal bed frames in the past, so I think we're going to buy it.  urlLink Picture!  We'll obviously need to purchase a LOT of throw pillows, but I am very fond of the idea of having another sleeping space. And we can get a crappy mattress for now ($50 at Ikea) with a mattress pad or lots of blankets on it and upgrade later.  The caterer is not returning my phone calls. This is Not Good.  Note to self: go buy filing cabinet this week. You can take Jenny's truck and save yourself a massive headache on transport.  Going back to the theme of this entry (see title), Will seems to think that he needs clean clothes for something ("work") so I had better go sort.

      My copy of the out-of-print Criterion edition of  Rebecca  has just arrived in the mail. Yippee! And also Wow! That is one loaded DVD. AND it only cost me about $8. Lovely Jenn gave me an Amazon gift certificate on the occasion of my birthday, so I had only to pay the balance. I think Amazon still has a few in stock, so if anyone else does not own this movie, it can still be purchased.  My sister has someone on her LiveJournal Friends list whose username is bipolarcurious. I think this is the most clever username in the history of usernames, and I hate him/her for thinking of it before the rest of us.  Speaking of my sister, any ideas what I might be able to pawn off on her in terms of wedding prep? She is 3000 miles away and refuses to hop the next plane to Los Angeles to address invites (I do not blame her one bit and would do anything to get out of it myself - oh help they will be ready within a week or so and my hand is already cramping).  I repeat: oh help. Weddings are too much work.
