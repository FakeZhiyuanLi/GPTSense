      I haven't posted for a few days. I've had this really ugly tattoo for about 12 years. I finally went and got it fixed up. It still looks a little funny, but it looks much better. I need to get out. Other than work, I'm usually at home. I took a ride down to East Atlanta, had a beer and looked around. It's just hard to go out and have any fun. I have to stay sober in order to drive home.

      Every time I take my boat out my batteries get drained rather than charged. I go to flush my toilet (which is a marine toilet running off the twelve volt batteries) the next morning and it won't flush and I'll have no running water. As soon is I get the charger going, I'm back in business, but it's a pain in the ass.

      Took the boat out for the second time yesterday.  It went fairly smooth.  It would have gone smoother if I hadn't smoked a little wacky weed.  My engine died on me while I was docking and I haven't tried cranking her back up.  This lifestyle is fraught with alot lof little headaches but it's all part of the experience.  But I had a couple of old friends over and we did some fishing.  I didn't catch anything.  ( I fish, but not very seriously.  I don't have the patience.)  But one of my buddies caught a 9 pound carp.  Last night I rode out on somebody elses boat.  That was a nice experience-going out at night.

      I'm living out by a town called Emerson. There's a restaurant called Doug's Place. I'd heard that it was a really good place to eat. I went there for the first time today. It's your typical meat and three veggies kinda southern restaurant and it was packed. It was good. But in reality it's a bible-belt alcohol-free Hooters. Man all, the waitresses were to die for. I'm not talking cute; I'm talking Hot. These girls look like they got tired of gripping dance poles and decided to start serving pork chops, collards and cornbread. I know where I'll be eating out from now on :).

      Well, obviously I figured out how to upload pictures which will make my blog a bit more interesting, not like anyone's going to see this. Off to work the night shift at the Cartersville Quiktrip. The night clientel reminds me that I really need to rent "Deliverance." I haven't seen it in years. "Southern Comfort" would be nice to see again also. You get the drift. People with no shoes, no teeth, wearing blood-stained Hank Williams Jr. T-shirts asking me what our cheapest cigarettes are.

      I don't really know what I'm doing here, but I'm always looking for new stuff to do, so why not start a blog. Everybody else is right. I just moved onto a houseboat. My boat's named "Cool Breeze", hence the name of my Blog. I'm living out in a beautiful area and really want to rediscover some things that I haven't been into for a long time like hiking and photography, perhaps this will be a good place to post some pictures. I'm not really into country music, but I've heard a song on the radio recently where this guy's singing about the next thirty years of his life. To paraphrase, "It's time to start drinking a little less beer and a lot more lemonade." That's kind of where my life's at right now. Life is good, but I'm 36 and single and that needs to change. I'm tired of being alone. I've learned that sowing your wild oats doesn't reap a whole lot.
