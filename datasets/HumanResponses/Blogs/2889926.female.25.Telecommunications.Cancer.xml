      Things have gone well today. I've been emotional well, and happy. I've started the job working by myself today and think I managed well. 

I've been so pissed lately I haven't talked about my new kitty.. hehehehe.. We got our baby girl. She's soo damn cute. She's got yellow on her right side of her face and black on her other. So we named her Gemini. She's perfect. :)

Brian and I love her much, I guess we've mutated from BF/GF to maybe something a bit more serious. We have a furkid together. *gasp* LOL I see us going somewhere with our relationship anyway. So I don't think the kitty kicked us into "relationship" but hey i can blame it on her right? LOL

It's a beautiful day here, 60ish. Would rather be outside than in a cube but alas one must pay the bills somehow right? 

I've lost 8 lbs so far on the Atkins diet. *shakes skinnier booty* I'm getting there, Goal is 15 lbs, but as easy as it is to do this diet, I could stand to loose a few more than that. Hmmm decisions decisions. 
I'm attempting to help Pixie and Dirk do thier diets. As long as they remember some main ideas I think they will be just fine. And she's a scorpio, which means she's balls to the walls with it. :)

la la lallallalalalalalallaa little songs in my head. 

Guess I should think about an obituary to put on WG. Hmm Heather was a great lady who loved, lost and loved again. blah blah blah.. I'll have to think on it and maybe try later.

      I got hit with something hard yesterday regarding the death of my father that really struck a cord with me. I sent my mom an email asking how long she knew he had cancer before she decided to tell me, and I guess it was when we were in Indiania, visiting. Once we got back she told me. Which I am greatful she waited, but not since I said such hateful things to my gparents about my Dad. These were what I knew, as i felt at the time, now how I feel about him. I was just thinking the other day, what beautiful grandchildren he has, and I wish he could see them. I named my first born after him, well he had my dad's middle name. Bradley. The day he died, i knew I would try to honor him anyway I could and I believe i have. I just need to free myself of being a hateful child and feeling and saying the things I did. I can't forgive myself for that. It's hard. 

I guess it's because I know I can't hug him again, and tell him how I truely feel about him. How much I did love him, the things he said to me, he loved me and I loved him. I know that now. But I can't tell him for real. And that hurts. Sometimes you have to suck up and say things you should when you should and I didn't. 

So...

Dad I love you. You were a GREAT father, a great friend, and a wonderful man. I'm sorry I wasn't there for you when you died, but i felt like you ran out on me. I know now that you couldn't do anything about it, and it was your time to go. But I want you to know you have beautiful awesome grandchildren who do know who you are, do love you even though you aren't here, and will call you grandpa till they die. Although they may have never met you, they have me and I'm half of you. And a 24 yr old daughter who's crying right now cause your gone,who loves you very much no matter what I've said in the past.

      *SIGH*
Umm where do I begin??? We get notice late yesterday afternoon, our company is laying off some middle managment, BF is moving over to be a tech, and I'm going to be working the ENTIRE CLEC dept by myself. I find this a little disturbing, and kind of honored. I feel I'm qualified to do all of this, just not by myself. No raise, no compensation to any of this. WHen I came on to this company I had one job title Provisioner. Now that I've been here for two months, it's accued to provisioner, call center, back office support, billing, and  reconsiliation. Bring me more, I want more. I mean come on, there's only so much 1 person can handle by themselves. I understand their reasoning behind why the company is doing this I just find it a little unnerving. *sigh*




*SIGH*
Then BF's ex. *SIGH* what am I to do with her, besides give the woman some serious prozac and tell her to chill the fu*k out? She sent BF email last night to extend her idea's on child support. And how what he's sending isn't good enough, and she wants more, and she has to pay for a 2 bedroom apt, (she has a BF herself why doesn't he help) and that she doesnt' think it's a good idea he see the girls till they are divorced. That PISSES me OFF. Who is she to keep his kids from him, BY LAW she's required to let him see his kids regardless of child support. Plus nothing is in writing right now so, he's not required to pay shit, but he's trying to do the right thing and send what he can. I swear she makes things way worse. Telling him he'll have to deal with Alabama courts, well bitch if he files in CO, YOU will have to come here and deal with CO courts. I really want to rip her head off and what better way to do it then here right? 
He doesn't defend himself with her, which pisses me off. Say something to her, tell her to get fuc*ed. 
Bring the kids here and keep them. Neither of them have "said custody" right now. I mean if she wants to play bitch ball, bring it on. 



*SIGH*
My sister, Gods I love her, but she's another one that pisses me off. I guess I should have called this I'm pissed off huh?  BF let her use his Jeep (we had to leave it back home when we moved to CO due to engine problems) She fixed them in return to drive the car until we can come get it. I mentioned to her that we might be there to get it next month (she's had it for 3 now) and she flips out, this is my only means of transportation and if you take it away from me I'm screwed. *SIGH* She had an opportunity to buy a car, and said she didn't cause she though she would have the car idefinatly. WTF? What do you say to your sister. Sorry your screwed, we never told you you could have the damn car just use it? What part of your names not on the title don't you get? I swear being a friend to family sometimes screws you. Expecially when it's your own sister. How do I relay the messages between the two of them? Here BF you talk to sister, sister you talk to BF maybe you can get something worked out then. 

*SIGH* I need a big fat vodka and coke..

      Well the ex wrote back to tell BF that she doesn't want him dead, just me. HAHAHAHAHAH Well I don't see that happening anytime soon, so just get over it. Gods I love spite, and ex's and all that ugly junk. No really I'm kidding

BF just called and said he got pulled over for expired tags. Do you have any clue what hell it is to get tags for a car in this state? Here go pay these people to do one thing, and pay someone else to do another, then you can tag your car. They won't quote you a price over the phone so you have NO CLUE how much your tags are going to be. Which just makes me all giddy inside, can't you tell? 

On the GOOD side, BF went to get the cat. YIPPIE. He said she's beautiful, and cute and tiny and meowie.. 
I'm soo excited, he's bringing her up here cause he has to come get me. hehehehhahaah I got a little meow meow. I'm soo excited. 

And its FRIDAY!!!!

      You know when your a woman when your mood swings multiple times in a matter of 4 hours. 
*sigh* these are the days I wish I wasn't a woman. 

Yesterday evening bf's ex calls, with all these ideas about how she should have left him blah blah then turns around and says I'd rather you dead then to be w/out you. WTF do you say to someone like that? Is she crazy? She says "let me tell you I wished you would have let me leave when I wanted but I still want you?" Seems to me like she doesn't know what she wants. She says the only people who are happy out of this is me and bf. She says her kids are going to be all fu*ked up now cause they aren't together. Wouldn't they still be fu*cked up if they stayed together and they hated each other? Is that something you want to teach your child? Stay with the one you hate no matter what if you have kids together? I mean come on. It's not healthy for the kids, or the parents to stay in a unhappy relationship. She's trying hard to get him back which I can understand, they were together for 10 years, but come on. You keep changing how you feel, what you say. You contradict yourself with the things you say. She frustrates me to no end. I'm glad he tells me these things, but sometimes I wish he would quit being nice and tell her to get fu*cked. Can you tell I'm a little pissed with this? 
It's like she runs over him with the kids, they want to do this, they want to do that, you get child support does that not help pay for the things "THEY" want? She wants him to shell out extra for soccer, or softball or whatever. She gets x amount a month can that not help? I mean he pays for their internet connection. Does that not help? I just want to scream sometimes. 
Oh then for spring break she wanted him to fly there, and stay at her house, while her and her bf go stay at her moms. Yeah right. And the whole thing is she HAS a BF. You can't have your cake and eat it too lady come on. The kids are flying here to be with us at our house!
Then they are moving from AL to TX, which is great that makes the kids closer for us to get, but ex wants him to move closer to her? The bitch moved  600 miles away to begin with because she couldn't be in the same state as him or she'd stalk him she said. Now, again she's contradicting herself ,and I want to strangle her. Nothing she says makes any sense, and it's all a helpless me act to get him back. 
He's with me get over it. He's happy, he misses his kids bad, but I don't think if even we split up he'd go back to her. She's just unhappy all around. You could put her on a cruise with fine men massaging her every orifice and I can guarantee you she'd find something to bitch about. 
She's got bitter bitch syndrome, and I have the cure. Her man.

      So I started today, help me Gods. I was a week and a half late. Thus the psycho bitch mood that all of a sudden came out of no where. 
Please help me Gods to have the strength to be NICE to not bite peoples heads off, and to be thoughtful when I speak these next few days. I don't want to be ugly. 

Just remember Heather your getting a Kitty in 2 days.. Fluffy kitty, who will listen to you bitch and never say a word.

      I got this Pagan radio station and I really like it. Yeah. what a high light for me today huh? Brian is being so lovey today, all sweet and telling me I'm beautiful. Gods I love that man. He knows just the right words to make me melt. Guess that's what I get for dating a Scorpio, quite the Adonnis, but can change to Hades in a minute. ahhhhhhhhhhhh... 

I'm getting a kitty this weekend. I'm soo excited. Its our first animal together and I'm stoked. Finally found a kitty here, which everyone keeps telling me kitties aren't in season yet. Yeah well I found one, so there.. LOL

      I guess I will get my resume going, get my leads going, get some jobs going, and quit. Brian and I have already discussed paying this dude back for the moving expenses, and if that's all I have to do to rid myself of this ass hole, then I will pay money. 
 
Mental note to self, do resume, look for jobs. I will work here till I get something new and after that he's getting the middle finger from me, and he'll be screwed, I am the only one who know's how to run this department, I am the only one who can provision his lines, I am the only one who can reconsile bills. He will be screwed, and I will then be happy. 
 
I hate being so bitter, but damn. He did this to me. I was just fine till I came in this morning, to this shit. 
I knew it would happen though.

      Oh I was going and going and had a bunch of crap typed out and I lost it, apparenlty clicked cancel and lost the damn post. 
 
ARRRRRRRRRRRGGGGHHHHH!
 
I hate my job, lets try this again. I work for a egocentric, asshole, who thinks all men are gods and women are shit. Easily put, he's indian, and doesn't like the idea of women who speak in any tone to him other than that of the lips kissing his ass. I on the other hand, am a very hot headed, self centered, goddess baren woman, who doesn't like people like him, and will not bow down to his every whimper or need. So as you can see there's a bit of a conflict of interest. 
 
Well Thursday I was out with Daegan sick. I went to work got all the pertainant information to work from home, forwarded our cusotmer service line to my house, and did everything i do daily here, at home. I left the HR director a vmail letting her know I would be out and working from home etc.
 
well I got to work this morning with an email saying this Both of you kind a disappeared today and I don't appreciate this. One of you should be here to provide support for our CLEC customers.
  
Heather did not even inform me about leaving the office. This is unprofessional.
  
Sam 
 
brian is the Both this is directed at. He was sick also thursday, legitmate not faking it. As was I. Now brian no longer works in the dept I do, and why would Brian back me up when I'm the only one. 
 
So I responded "I left Theresa a message letting her know my daughter was extremely ill. I also forwarded all calls coming in for the call center to my cell phone and worked from home that day. Although I was not in the office I was working for you. 
 
I apologize for not leaving you a message. Can you verify who it is that we need to report to? I know Brian called in to Noe and Scott, he was sick.
 
Heather
 
His reply " I would like to see a doctor's note on your daughter.
  
Sam"
 
ok, behind this the fucker hasn't had insurance for us in a month, how am I supposed to take her to the dr, without insurance??
  
My reply " How am I supposed to take her to the doctor without any insurance or the money to pay for it up front? 
 
I cannot supply you with one. 
 
Heather
 
His reply " We have clearly said before that there is money for doctor's appointment and such. We just don't want to pay for major medical expense until April 1st when Kaiser kicks in.
 
my reply Yes, Sam but I would have had to pay for it up front, I don’t have the cash up front. 
 
Is the fact that I worked from home going unrecognized? 
 
I have an appt with him in 10 minutes. I hate him and want him to die. Yeah he'd pay the dr's bill, but I have to pay it first, and don't have the money to do so. Why do you think my daughter hasn't been to the dr's? I can't afford it. That's why I pay you asshole to provide healthcare for me and mine. 
Wish me luck, I may not have a job when I come back.

        Your wings are  BROKEN  and tattered. You are an angelic spirit who has fallen from grace for one reason or another - possibly, you made one tragic mistake that cost you everything. Or maybe you were blamed for a crime you didn't commit. In any case, you are faithless and joyless. You find no happiness, love, or acceptance in your love or in yourself. Most days are a burden and you wonder when the hurting will end. Sweet, beautiful and sorrowful, you paint a tragic and touching picture. You are the one that few understand. Those that do know you are likely to love you deeply and wish that they could do something to ease your pain. You are constantly living in memories of better times and a better world. You are hard on yourself and self-critical or self-loathing. Feeling rejected and unloved, you are sensitive, caring, deep, and despite your tainted nature, your soul is breathtakingly beautiful.

Now Now Now.. I know I'm weird, but damn am I that bad?? :( and I am happy and joyful and loving.
Don't read the blog man.. just stay away.. Maybe another day it will be different. But I like dark things, I like graveyards, and dark music and dark people. You'd look at me and call me a yuppy.. but damn a fallen angel. *i'm going to pout and take this over again with something fluffy and light*

      So I'm sitting at work eating cereal at 3:26 in the afternoon. LMFAO I'm starving and ate my lunch already, brought cereal to eat for breakfast cause we're broke this week, and decided hell I'm hungry now so I'm eating cereal at my desk. 
 
I love Karma.. It's great and wonderful and just friggin awesome. I got home last night and we are BROKE. Checked my mail and I got a damn $99.55 check in the mail for some promotion I signed up for months ago not thinking I'd actually get it. It came at the best time in the world and if I could hug Karma, I'd not only hug her, I'd probably hump her leg. 
 
I just love it when things like this happen. It makes me know there's something out there watching out for me, and mine. 
 
Brian was in a PISSY mood last night. I talked to Pixie about it today and she confirmed this is a Scorpio trait. LMAO. He wanted to fight, didn't care with who or what about but wanted to bicker and bitch and just all over fight. I wasn't in the mood for it. He said he was pissed at Lori, what?? Just now.. I mean come on. I think he's debating on filing bankruptcy himself but worried what it will do to her. Fuck her. Who cares.. But that's my thoughts alone. It was easy for me to file cause Bo's name wasn't on anything, the drop deak crank head didn't have a job so how could he apply for credit. She on the other hand has her name all over everything they have together, as does he. So it might be a bit different for them than it was for me. But really I don't give a shit what it does to her and her credit. I hope it bends her over with out vasaline. LMAO.. I'm a nice person, I don't wish this on her. BWWHHHAAAA yeah I do.. LOL
 
Well onto  Brian last night. I dont' know what his deal was. He said what color is the sky, I said blue, he said why I said cause it is, he said why, I said I'm not going to feed your fire, I'm going to bed. I thought you want someone to argue with call your wife. *mental note to self never say things like that to him*
. LMAO.. Looking back at it today, I think it was pretty funny. Last night prolly a different story, but today funny. 
 
So I decided to close the bedroom door, blast some meditation music and meditate myself to sleep. I had a bad day also, one of my co-workers got canned, and all shit went to hell at work. So I wanted to go home and vent to him, while doing this I guess I got his engines going and poof super bitch I created. 
 
He's just fixing to start his period, like me, but damn come on now. Funny he reaps my womanness more than I do. Right before I start he gets the moods, even gets the zits. I just get the woman stuff, and he gets all the rest. I've done this with girlfriends before but never men. Funny..

      Isn't that what the fairy godmother on Cinderella said? Prolly not spelled that way but again I can't spell and hell who cares right? 
 
Having some fairy godmother idea's going on in my head as of late, on starting up a business up in the mountains. Brian and I have discussed starting something for a while it just seems it's an idea and not a reality. I want reality. I know that both our credit's suck, and there would be no way in hell anyone would want to finance us to do this, but the idea of the dream is there, and somethig I believe with enough time and preperation can become reality, even with shitty credit. 
  
I talked to Bella a bit, we are going to talk more this weekend about what all she did. She's been in business a while and seems to have things going for her. I look up to her in the business aspect hoping she can give me some do's and don'ts of running a business. Nica is getting me her business books and info on grants, and I if I have to alone get this going I will. 
 
So I have a start. I even have thought about making a menu, but Brian want's this a plate lunch type of place like there are in Louisiania, and personally i'd rather run an actual resturant. But this is his idea and I'm going to honor the whole plate lunch idea, till we get big enough for the demand for more. 
 
I mean what person wouldn't want to eat Cajun food. Good Cajun food at that? Plus Bella says there aren't enough resturants in the area and she thinks we would do good there. Plus it's so damn beautiful up there, and I would prefer to be out of the city. But I'd be away from Pixie. :(.. 
 
But it's not that far away only like an hour and a half. Chicken food to what we are used to driving, umm 10 to 12 hours for kids, etc.. 
 
Plus I have this other idea to sell Candles. I know this great supplier in OKC who has the best damn candles. One candle can smell the whole house up and smell good too. She's not to expensive wholesale and I can turn around and double the profit *poof* quick. And they would sell. I know they would. She's got every smell from Blueberry Cheesecake to things like Mango Papaya. You almost want to eat the candle. And after the candle has burned it's life, the glass jar can be used as almost anything. Plus the wax is like parafin, so it makes your hands soft. Yeah I could go on for days about those candles. I just need to do something about it. 
 
Heather Get off your ass, quit procrastinating and do something.
 
 I think I'll make a call to the candle lady.

      So we have $23 in the bank, and don't get paid till the 1st. I am now looking at all that we spent thinking you dumb asses. 
 
Mostly it was the liquer store. starting to wonder if we are alcholics, geesh.. There should no reason why one would spend that much at the liquor store, until I re=read the blog entries I have written. LMAO. Hmmm wonder why Heather drinks so much.. Hmmm could it be the dreaded ex psycho bitch. LMAO. NOt an excuse but one I think I'll use. LOL
 
The only thing that I'm worried about his Brian's girls will be here Friday, we have no money till the 1st. Which sucks. We can't do anything that really cost's money for a little while, and just driving around could cost us $30 since gas has decided to make an all time record high. We have a change jar that we have much change in, and I think I will go change it in and stick it in the bank. That should atleast give us enough cash to get buy until we get paid. 
 
Why would we be so irresponsible?
 
although there were a few payments that were auto drafted that shouldn't have been, this is why we are where we are. Brian makes a one time payment, then all of a sudden they want to take it out every month. He's gotta stop that.

      Why I have that damn song in my head I have no idea. (could be Daegan hehehe)
Nothins gonna break me down, oh no.. I got to keep on movin.. 
Brian wanted to know if I blogged yesterday. LMFAO.. I said you don't want to read what I wrote. 
 
I'm in a great mood today, it's beautiful outside, and I got some this morning so I mean come on what could make my day go bad right?  I'm leaving early today, cause the boss is out and so is the hr director.. (weg)
 
The bitchy ex decided she wanted to take the kids to the airport. I got off early yesterday cause I signed my bankruptcy papers (big weight lifted) went home and there was an email from her. Asking how early could she drop the kids off at the airport, I replied as Brian of course, with all the information. She doesn't need to know she was speaking with the enemy does she? LMAO.. Funny how I'm the bad guy. She's just jealous cause her ass is big. ( I know be nice).

 
Speaking of asses, mine has gotten much smaller. I got on the scale today and lost 6 more lbs. Which makes that a grand total *drum roll please* of 16 lbs. Woohooo Hurrray,, the crowd gives heather a standing ovation. And you did it all without the use of illegial drugs. Go you. (can you tell i'm proud of myself)hehehe... I am now at my goalish weight of 139, started out at 155. So yeah I'm friggin extatic. 

 
Brian and I talked a bit last night about life, and being together. He (I'm gonna get sappy) is the most wonderful thing that has happened to me with the exception of giving birth to my kids. I mean he is everything I want in a man, I can have conversation with him I couldn't have with others. We discussed me being a Dianic Eclectic Witch. LMAO.. I'm a DEW. And he kept questioning my faith and why I feel the way I do. I totally LOVE that about him. The ex would just say ok, and shrug his shoulders. Why cause he hasn't a clue what the hell I'm talking about. Brian does. I mean I look at him and still get butterflies, still get all girlie and funny with him. We will be together a year on the 1st of April. (we've been together longer but couldn't remember exactly when so we just said lets make it fools day how appropriate)
I still feel the very same way about him I did when I first met him. With the ex hell it was a week and the butterfly girlie stuff was gone. I guess I just found someone that completes me, and I him. I told you I would get sappy.
 
We are going over to Pixie, and Dirks tonights, and I have to tell you I love them. They are just the greatest damn people I have ever met. 
 
Dirk calls last night to talk to Brian, and all of the sudden he hangs up the phone and I'm looking at him like how damn rude of you to do that. Then notice the bottom lip quivering and tears running down his face. He was crying.. I felt like an ass. 
 
Then Dirk calls back to tell Brian he loves him. *sappy yeah, but hell how often do you hear two grown men saying that* I sent Pixie an email telling her how greatful I was that she was in my life, and that I loved her. *yeah I'm just full of love and sappieness today aren't I) Quite different from yesterday. *chuckle*
 
Have a wonderful Friday everyone. Drink and be marry.

      You know I'm realitivly happy go lucky with life, and things in general. I'm not a mean person, or hateful, or vengeful. 
 
I don't wish people dead, just sometimes to kick their butts.
 
I was out smoking a bit ago and really thought who all might be reading my blogg. I have no problem sharing what's going on with my life right now I just don't want to offend anyone with my cussing and protesting about said ex's. 
  
I asked Mab to remove my blog from the WG list, incase I am offending someone. 
 
I hate that all of this is going on right now, but I do feel releived that I have somewhere to put all these thoughts and rants and feel better once I'm done writing. 
 
Thank Gods for Pixie. I love her to death and I went to her with the ex issue, and she helped me to somewhat understand why the ex is doing this. 
 
I just need a big diet and vodka to make it all go away, not that it would but hell I'd feel better. 
 
I'm going to sign my bankruptcy papers today, WOOOHOOO. Those damn creditors will quit calling me now. I don't have your money and never will. I just hope all goes well at the signing. Lawyers can pinch money anyway they can you know. 
 
I'm sorry for bitching so much, I am truly a happy person. LMAO..

      I am soo close to going to Alabama and beating the hell out of Brian's ex wife. 
 
She's so bitter and jealous and just shitty. We bought his girls plane tickets to come see us on their
spring break, well she all of a sudden decides she doesn't have the $ for gas to take them all the way to the airport and has to be to work by 8 and can't do it. WTF? She's doing this because she's bitter, and wants revenge of some sort, but the only people she's hurting out of this is Brian and the girls. These tickets are NON Refundable, NON transferable, I spent $700 I, ME, Heather spent this money. The fucking bitch did this on purpose. I am calling United right now to see what all needs to be done to make sure the bitch can drop the kids off 4 hours before the flight so she can get to work on time. Could she not be a little considerate and ask her boss for an hour in the morning so she can make sure she get's the girls on the plane safely? I want to make sure everything is in place so she has no excuse. 
 
I want to scream! What a bitch! A yes the C word, cunt! *sigh* Her email was sent to piss him off. At the bottom of the email she wrote, go ahead and cuss me out lol you're so predictable. I mean WTF? Why would you do this? Karma is a bitch and will be coming to get  her, if I don't first. 
 
I called Brian's mom to hopefully talk some sence into Lori. She's a good mediator for this type of thing. I have Lori's email address with an open email and I keep looking at it. What good though, does it do if she get's an email from her husbands (they aren't divorced yet) girlfriend. That's just gonna piss her off more. Which I believe is why all this happened to begin with. I went and forwarded her the flight information I sent Brian which said I was excited the girls would be coming and that was it. No I love you at the end of the email, no reason or thing that would piss her off other than I was excited. 
 
OMG! *sigh* WTF? *sigh*
 
Anyway Brian's mom is going to call and slap I mean talk some sence into Lori hopefully, and if not she said she would take off work and go get the girls and take them herself. I mean does Lori not see what this is doing to EVERYONE? No cause she's a selfish bitch, only thinking of ways to make everyone elses lives miserable cause her's is too. 
 
*sigh**sigh**sigh**sigh**sigh**sigh**sigh**sigh**sigh**sigh**sigh**sigh**sigh**sigh**sigh**sigh*
 
I didn't sleep worth shit last night, and cried most of it. It's not Brian's fault she's this way, he doesn't deserve this, he misses his girls soo damn bad, and I puked due to stress from this last night. I feel an ulcer coming from her. How can I let someone get to me this bad. I know that's her idea, but hell Heather fuck her. 
 
I swear this poor blog is my therapist. *sigh*

      Where do I begin with frustrations? 1. Work. 2 Not being able to see Brian 3. Oklahoma 4. His ex !
 

Work, my boss Sam. Great guy but sucks with communications. He was apparently on the rag today, and taking it out on everyone. 
He has no sense of decency in his words, and I would have loved to sock him between the legs. Arrogant ass hole. Funny thing is
he knows he wouldn't have his CLEC if it weren't for me. He would be up shit creek with out a paddle. And I have thought of doing this. 

 
I haven't seen Brian really in the last 3 days. 15 minutes here 15 there. Monday night he didn't get home till well over 2, I was out. This morning he came in as I was leaving for work, and it's all DUE TO WORK. I'm sitting in Sam's office discussing issues to go over with the group in OK and the email crashes. All knowing this would happen he calls Brian immediately and says come in now. We had planned on dinner, and being with eachother, ok face it I haven't had sex in 2 days with him and I'm hungry. I won't get to see him for 5 more days cause I'm leaving on a jet plane to friggin Oklahoma. Do you know that's an entire week without sex. HELLO can't a boss give me some sympathy.. of course I'm not going to bring this up to him, but I sure was pissed. I slammed out his office when I left. 

 
Oklahoma. I love to hate that state. It's full of nothing but crank addicts and I'd prefer not to intermingle with that kind ever again. 
Yes once upon a year and  half ago, I was myself a crank head, but I seemed to have grown up and out of that phase in my life and don't care to get back, near, close, around it. Unfortunately this interaction includes the ex, half the people at Seth's birthday Saturday and even my own family. Amazing isn't it. LMAO.I Have no concerns myself about doing it. I'm done with that phase in my life and I'd prefer to put it past me. For one people on crank think everyone is talking about them. LMAO The ex constantly thinks I'm talking to supposed ex friends about him. That I've even interacted with anyone he interacts with to give this information out. I feel like walking back into "these are the crack heads of your past lives" ....Funny I am.. I took my suit case to the car a bit ago, and got shivers. I have bad feelings about this trip. I'm gonna get in a fight, someone's going to get their ass kicked and it won't be me. I just hope I can be adult enough not to do it at my son's birthday party.. Maybe while I'm heading  out to the car to leave.. *weg* Although these thoughts cross my mind, there simply thoughts. Rarely actions. 

 

Her.. The ex.. Wife's.. thing that Brian has yet to divorce.. She's a hemorrhoid in my ass. *sigh* Not only are we paying for the tickets for his kids to fly here for a week, mind you it was like 700 bucks, the bitch wants gas money to take them from Alabama to new orleans.
Can I scream? Can I pull my hair out? Can you ask for anything more???? Jesus Christ.. Quit with the money pinching. Someone needs new shoes, can you spare $20 for new shoes. Someone needs a year book cause I couldn't afford pictures from school. Did she ask for money for the pictures? We would have given it to her. Is the money he sends her not enough? I mean Alabama is one of the shittiest states to live in economy wise, wouldn't you think she would move somewhere better? She makes like 8 a hour, move some where where you can make some money. That's why we didn't stay in Lafayette. We would have drowned there. Does she need to reap the benefits of where we are now, and where she could be if she got up and did something about it? I mean come on. Quit. 

 
Mind you I've had a few to drink and had time to relax a bit, but come on now.. WTF??

      I've had some rythems running in my head that I should probably put down on something before I forget them. Always seem to have the best poet's moment in the damn car with no paper, and nothing to record it too.  Isn't that the way it always is. :)
 
Sun, moon, he, she
Finding who you choose to believe
Where do you go, what do you do
Everyones telling you believe in you. 
 
Finding your power, inside and out
Living, loving doing with or without.
 
Trust your instincts, trust your heart
do what you feel will bring you together not apart
 
Spiritaul, religion, soul and self. 

 
duhhh duhhh duuhhhhh.. I hate misc ramblings like that. But I know atleast if I write the damn thing down
I have it to reference later right. 
 
I made a pal some bath oils and was trying to come up with some little spells to go with it, had it all in my head on the way home stuck in 5 o'clock traffic, but once the ligth turned green it was gone. *sigh* I guess I need to invest in a little recorder or something.

      So I go online to witchvox thinking there are some Pagan/witchy groups out here in Denver. I can tell you there are what 3 or 4, and all of them want membership dues to join their covens along with a 45 page questionaire wanting to know your life history. 
 
When did being Pagan cost money?  When did the idea of wanting to be in a coven cost money?  
They are all eclectic with some hint of Wicca, which is fine. I'm not Wiccan but can work with them in ritual I believe. There's some Goddess centered group that seems to be some kind of recruite group. I don't get it. 
 
Why can't they just have normal groups out there for normal people to chant, gather and ritual together. Why can't there be an Oklahoma coven in Denver? The Oklahoma groups were all so laxed, quaint, nice, friendly.. No fill out my 5 page questionaire, give me your money, then we will think about it.. 
 
Wonder if it's a  society difference here than there. I don't know but I don't like it. 
 
I thought about making my own coven out here, but not being a High Priestess, puts a damper on things I think. I would like to be ordained first before doing anything like that. I believe I know my stuff well enough to get something going, but I don't want it to be anything like I've seen. Maybe I haven't been in the area enough yet to be around enough Pagan/witch groups to get aquainted. But geesh come on..

      Where the wind comes sweeping down the plains.. where the waving wheat it sure smells sweet.. 

Well I'm going to oklahoma this thursday, on business. I lucked out cause it's my son's birthday this weekend and I really really really wanted to be there so I'm flying for free, on company time staying till Monday. that's soooo cool.. Business will only be 2 days, and play for two days. I'm sad though cause Brian won't be there with me, but I get to see my son, which is the only other man I will invest all my time with while I'm there. 

GOds I can't wait.. I need to go shopping for his birthday, and unfortunatly we don't get paid till Monday. But I will do what I can to make sure it's a good day for him.

There will be ex friends there, that I really don't care for, but I'm taking my bitch back up best friend who will keep me in line. It's my son's birthday and I refuse to fight at his birthday or even scour down that low to their standards. 

Dyed my hair this weekend at Pixies palace. LMAO.. She did a great job on it and it's all even. I should tip her next time. LOL

Work is slow, email is down which means not a whole lot of working going on around here. Not always a bad thing. 

Other than that..

      So I had a good weekend. 

Went to eat lunch Saturday at Olive Garden and blew my diet to hell that day. But you know I've worked my butt off for two weeks, I think I'm ok to eat one day what I want. Went shopping and had fun and we were supposed to go out Sat. night. Well the baby sitter calls at like 5:30 should be there at 7 to tell us she can't sit tonight. :( So we didn't get to go out. 

But I have the bestest BF in the whole world. I came out of the restroom to find him turning on some music, so I could dance. Since I didn't get to go out and dance he let me dance at home with him. Which I thought was soo sweet. Made me love him even more.

Then Sunday I sat around and didn't budge most of the day. Got online and saw my son. We have webcam so we can see eachother. Saw the ex. He looks fatter than he did which I hope means he's off the drugs. *sigh* probably not though. His face still looked all pitted out. Things never change wtih him i swear. He said I looked good. Yeah I know I lost 10 lbs. But he was rather pleasant and nice so I have to give him that. 

Other than that I really didn't do anything this weekend. 

Just waiting on my oils to get in so I can make some stuff.

      Since I could say that I wasn't addicted, it's been awhile since I could say I love myself as much as you.. Its been a while since I could stand on my own two feet again.. it's been awhile.. (stained)
 
The BOWIE concert was AWESOME. He's such a sexy man, damn if I die tomorrow I would have fullfilled my dreams. I am so glad I got to go with Pixie, Dirk, Bella, Brian, George and of course Brian. If I had went with Bo.. *sigh* it would have been the worst concert ever. I am so glad I am through with him and on to the begining of the rest of my life. *YIPPIE*
 
I still hate my job, and as we speak DCA the company I used to work for that did all the work for the company I now work for is here visiting to see if they can again do the work for the company I now work for. Did you get all that? If so, LAY ME OFF. I want to draw unemployment for a year, and persue other venues of my life. I don't ever want to work in telecom again. I hate this field, it's never stable and you never know if you  have a job one day to the next. I've been at MTT for 5 months now, and in that 5 months 9 people have gotten laid off by the asshole boss. I am only to know I'm next. Expecially with DCA here. What the hell else would they be here for. At least I'm aware they are here, still have friends at DCA who love me enough to break the news to me. What a fucker. The funny thing is if he moves everything back to DCA he will be paying out MORE than he currently is paying me. So LOOSE YOUR ASS OFF.. GO BANKRUPT PLEASE.. Make my life happier, better and not so damn shitty. 
 
Good thing! My mom and Seth are coming to visit on the 8th of May, staying tilll the 14th. I'm so friggin excited. And I actually get to take two days off to spend with them, the week they are here is the week of my bankruptcy hearing. Which I'm kinda glad for, cause my mom's been through it and can help me prepare. Woohoo.. 
 
I'm finally getting off my ass thanks to Bella and Brian and purchasing some candles for her to sell at her store. I'm very excited about it, and if I get laid off the goal is to sell these to make extra money. If all goes well I think it might be a good thing. Thanks to Pixie who helped me to find the legalities to all the small business crap. Geesh I didn't know there was so much. But then again why would I. LOL
 
Umm Brian and I are doing great, just trying to get his finances in check now. We will see what he decides to do. He needs to do something. Damn discover is like a friggin hound. I checked the caller id yesterday and those fuckers called 12 times. What the fuck? What part of he doesn't want to talk to you don't you understand? Oh and they call up until 9 pm.. I finally got pissed Tuesday and told them, my daughter is in bed and everytime you people call you wake her up, if this continues regardless of why you are calling I will call the FCC.. Fuckers.. And I'm the type of person to do so.. 
 
Other than that, we are getting ready for the Beltaine celebration in Bailey Saturday. Last year Brian and I were sneaking around to be together and camped out in OK with my coven. This year it's kinda nice that we can do it without concern and be together in the open. I guess this is our "sacred" time together. Rekindling what happend, and being so happy that we aren't where we were then. LOL I'm sure this is something we will celebrate the same way for years to come if we stay together, which I can so see happening. 
 
I am going through baby withdrawls. Everyone around me is pregnant, and I want another one. But due to my hard headness I can't have anymore and got my tubes tied. Hey if you were married to Bo, and knew you didn't want anymore kids from him, you'd do the same thing. LOL. I talked to Shonna about invetro, since that seems to be the easiest way to go about it. $4000 a pop, is much cheaper than getting my tubes untied ($10,000) and it not guaranteed to work. I think I'll take my chances with invetro. Plus I'm fertile mertle so it shouldn't be to hard. He wants a baby also.. Time will tell.

      Wanted to check Teri's thing about the advertisments, I don't see any on mine, just the blogger thing that tells you your writting on your blogger.
 
Herm.... I am now wearing the pair of pants that I've been trying to get my fat ass in for two years now. And I look good. (ok I'm feeling a litte sassy today, can't help it you know) They are a size 7, and I haven't worn a 7 since I was doing crank. Look at me, I can do this all by myself with out the help of illegial drugs.. 
(shakes ass).. LMAO I was in a 12-14 when I first started the diet..  Pixie and I could be poster children for the atkins diet. She got in her little pants yesterday too.. I'm so proud of us. Dirk has lost quite a bit of weight also. Brian on the other hand is gainining. LMAO.. I should look at putting him on the diet full time. I think that's why he's gaining so much is cause he eats atkinsish with me at night and whatever he wants during the day. That's alot of fat to be ingesting when your not working out, or working on a diet. None the less he's still sexy. grrrrr.. LOL
 
So Pixie emails me yesterday, and I didn't get it till this morning which really pisses me off, cause she wanted to do lunch, and it looks like I ignored her. I hate hotmail.. Really chaps my hide. I'm gonna call her today and see if she might want to do lunch, but seeing how it's snowing out she might not want to get out.. Hmmm..

      I was talking to Brian last night about this homeless guy the day before. I gave him 2 smokes while I was on my way to work. He looked at me and dropped his jaw, he said what??? I said I gave a homeless man 2 smokes yesterday on the way to work.. He said so did I.. I gave him two.. but we were at two different locations two different home less guys, at about the same time. I never do things like that but for some reaosn felt compelled to help this guy out.
 
We were discussing on WG the other day connections, and how different people connect in different ways. I think Brian and I shared a connection that day in helping a person in need. Mind you smokes aren't a great way to give, but I think it's better than giving him money and he going to the liquer store directly after you know. 
 
I just thought it was strange, and cool and neat..

      Well I'm back from LA, and had such a great time. I don't beleive I've ever felt as much love from a family as I did this weekend. I mean it was so beautiful and happy and just damn great ok. Brians mom rented a moonjump type thing that was a water slide, I had a great time on that. Daegan didn't care for it much so she played in the puddles the slide was making. (hey whatever works right?) I went and cut my hair off Thrusday about 2 hours after I got there. Gee didn't take me long. Then Brians sister renee and I went out and partied our asses off. I haven't danced like that since I can't remember when. It was so much fun. I was hung over as hell the next day. Brian wasn't mad at all that I went out. He said I trust you and I know you love me. Which makes me feel so much better. I do love him. Then Friday when Brian got in town we went and ate at Picante's, Renee sang up there, and I finally got to hear her voice. Man can she sing. Then we came home, turned right back around after leaving Daegan with Brian's mom and went out again.  Brian wanted to slow dance with me, since the only time we get to dance together lately is in the living room with the strereo on and the lights low. A nice change from the living room don't you think? 
 
Then Saturday we boiled 140 lbs of crawfish. I learned how to peal the tails, and will never suck the heads so I'm good there. :) Played on the water slide, and got sunburned. Sunday we had a great day, went and bought some food to bring back and relaxed. It was a wonderful damn vacation. 
 
Only had one issue with Brian's ex. Which she made an ass out of herself, and pissed Brian's family off. I think that's a good one actually. Brians' mom and brother were peeling the remainder of the crawfish for Brian and I to take home, well she came in and decided she wanted to eat some of it, and Brian's brother didn't like that. He said we peeled this for Brian, if you don't quit eating it I will take it away. She flipped them the finger and said this is all I have for Brian. In front of his family. How fucking rude and shitty. Then Brian's mom tried to give them gas money, and she threw it out the window. Fuck her. I'm glad she showed them her good side, it's only beneficial for us. fine. she was just pissed that she would have been there if I weren't in the picture, and they were still together. Get over it bitch. 
 
Got home and the house is a wreck, my mistery fairie should have cleaned the house, did the dishes and laundry. I'm not sure why she didn't? :) 
 
Bowie concert is Sunday, and I'm so damn excited I can't contain myself. Something I've always wanted since I was a small child drooling over him in Labryinth. He's someone I've always been attracted to even today, unlike people like Corey Haim etc.. which were childhood crushes, Bowie is a dream.. LMAO.. I'm such a shit talking about him too.. Can't beat the fact that I'll get to see him in concert though.. 
 
Brian and I are great. He asked me Friday night if I would marry him, and I told him when the time is right, and we are both divorced, it's something I would love to do. Which I would in a heart beat. He is the best thing, and his entire family thinks we belong together. They have never seen him this laid back, and happy. Even when we are together, we smile and laugh and that's something Lori and he never did, or expressed in front of his family. So I've got the up and up here, and she doesn't. 
 
We picked our Kitty up yesterday. We missed her so.. and she's gotten a little bigger from when we dropped her off. Gemini is such a sweet heart, when she's not attacking your toes, feet, legs while your walking, sitting doing nothing and come bombaring around the corner.. LOL She's a kitten, with attitude.

      What do you do when your ex has your son and he does drugs in the house and really doesn't care about the safty of his child? Yet he claims to be the allmighty father of the year.  Where do you draw the line and call DHS and don't care what it does to him, but only care about the safetly of the child? Where do you quit giving a shit about what the ex will think or do, and only care about the stability of the child? Where do you say fuck it? 
 
I got a call from a friend today, who went and did a suprise vist to the ex yesterday to drop a present of to Seth. She knocked a few times, and waited the front door was wide open. Girls in the kitchen giggling madly, the whole house smelling of meth being recently smoked, or even cooked. (unsure) To hear him yell at the front door, who the fuck is it? To walk in and ask where Seth is, to be told, uhh he's around here somewhere. He could have walked out in the street got kidnapped, ran over, fucking drowned. She looked all over the house and couldn't find him, then checked his bedroom and he was sleeping. 
 
Now what kind of fucking person am I to let him stay there? I called CPS and they told me they would take the report, call the sherriff, and go over there. If they found something they would take Seth into protective custody until I could be contacted, and then placed in my custody. Do you know how devistating that would be for my son to experience that? What that would do to him? He would flip out and be scared shitless. And for what? Heather, his safety. That's why you do it. 
 
I called my mom to tell her what I found out, she said she's going to make some surprise visits to the house, and was actually leaving as soon as she got off the phone with me to go over there. She doesn't like the idea of CPS coming in and taking him, I asked her what other options do I have mom, just to wait till something bad does happen and he's gone?? CPS will not place Seth in her custody. I will have to be the one to get him. I don't have the cash to get the plane ticket, and it's a 10 hour drive to get there. One I'm willing to drive through the night for. 
 
I'm torn with what it is I should do. Am I being to considerate for Bo? Am I being to selfish? I'm concerned with the welfare of my son. Fuck! I just don't know what to do. Plus he would so know I turned him in. Which doesn't help things much. And I know the cops wouldn't have a problem finding his shit. They could smell it walking into the house, I'm sure they will find it. 
 
So I'm just sitting here half hysterical trying to type to keep myself calm. Attempting to figure out what I should do. Waiting on my mom to call me back to hopefully give me good news, but doubtfull. 
 
My girlfriend that went over there said he was tweaking his balls off, which would validate my thoughts on him cranking. I've been getting these long over analized emails from him the last 3 days. All these big words, contradicting himself numerous times. Belittling me, and calling me stupid. Funny how things turn out. Ironically I'm not as stupid as he thinks me to be. 
 
It's hard for me to do anything this weekend since I will be in Louisiana. I am asking my mother to keep him this weekend to keep him away from that shit. Maybe I could call on him this weekend while he doesn't have Seth so CPS can't take him if he's not there right?? 
 
So many thoughts, unsure of what to do..

      That's pretty much how I feel lately. 
 
I got pulled over this morning! YIPPIE.. For running a red light. Dumb ass. But I was daydreaming about Bean and how she was doing. Things aren't going well with her, and I feel bad cause I haven't been in touch with her lately. I'm a bad friend. Nahh just busy. 
 
busy with what?? Not sure! Sorting the mind out I guess. Got to love Mercury and his communication adventures. Either your not communicating at all or you are and are so overwhelmed with what's going on in your head your dead to the rest of the world. A nice thought, and one at random. Which is primarily how this post will be. 
 
The ex sent the expected Merc retro email flipping out as I thought, but when I sat back and re-read it, he's right. Wholly shit.. He's right.. I'd never tell him that but hey I can tell myself right. He was just commenting on our past, how I was and how he knows me to be as that bitch. I replied to him letting him know he had the right to feel the way he does about me. That he and I didn't mesh well together. Some people bring out the worst in each other, and I know that's how we were. I know I'm a much better person now, even to him I am. He doesn't see that though, he just sees what he knew and can't look past much. Which I do understand. I just told him time would allow him to see who I am now, and nothing I could or would say would make it any different. I haven't received a reply from him yet, hopefully he'll look at it like I'm not demeaning or belittling him, but rather trying to let him know, yes I'm aware of the cunt I used to be, but I'm not her anymore. I'm a friggin fluffy person now. All giddy and happy. Strange I know.. I truly used to be a hateful person. Always hateful, always rude, arrogant too. Since I've met Brian it's like he equals me out. People told me after I left Bo and got with Brian that I was different. They weren't sure how but they'd let me know. A week later someone screwed something up and I went politely to them and said can you fix this. They said that's it, I said what, your not  a bitch anymore. LMAO.. Kinda sucks cause I love my bitch attitude, but it blocked me from so many things. Happiness. The one thing I thought I had and was the furthest from. Amazing. 
 
I'm glad I am who I am today. I am where I want to be in my life, drug free, not a cunt and happy with all life even the friggin nats don't bother me. I can say I'm a much better person now that I'm not with Bo. There's no way he'll ever know truly, but inside me I know and that's all that matters.

      Got that damn song in my head, off the South Park Casabonita episode, where Butters is singing in his little bomb shelter. LMAO. We got it off the net for Brian's girls to watch, cause we took them to Casabonita. 
 
Well it's been a minute since I've wrote, and thought I would let the world know what's going on with Heather at the moment. 
 
Lets start with the high points shall we???
 
I'm going to Louisiana next week, the 15th thru the 18th. I'm finally going to meet Brians sister Renee. I'm somewhat nervous, but am really excited about it. We've been together a year now, I still haven't met her. She lives in another state, so this is why. Shes my age, I think 2 or 3 years younger, so we should get along well. I've talked to her on the phone a few times, and we enjoyed eachother. I'll be in LA for 24 hours with out brian. Staying at his parents house, (which I just love them). So again I'm a littel nervous, but ok with the whole idea. 
 
Brian and I are doing great, still broke, but happy. Which makes the whole broke idea fine to deal with. I can eat crackers for a week, if I have to as long as he keeps a smile on my face. 
 
Daegan fell in the tub this week, cracked her skin under her chin open and has a nice little gash there. I turned around for 2 seconds to grab a towel and *bam* she went down. I felt so horrible, yet she didn't cry or bleed much. I think I got the worst deal out of it. LOL I took her to the dr's the next day cause I called the after hours emergency line, which told me unless she was gushing blood out her chin not to take her to the ER, they would not pay for it. SO I didn't. When I took her to the Dr.s they told me why didn't you take her to the ER to get stiches. Can I say I hate insurance. I hate stupid after hours nurses, and I hate my poor baby not getting the care she/and I pay for, for her. Enough said. 
 
Well I got a new manager at work this week, which is great cause I hate the president of the company, and apparenlty the word is he doesn't care much for me either. But he can't fire me cause I'm it. I'm the only one who knows what the hell is going on over here. He told my new boss, there are 4 things he doesn't like about me. This pisses me off so bad. 
 
1. I"M WOMAN
 
2. I'M 24
 
3. I HAVE KIDS
 
4. I HAVE A BAD ADDITUDE
 
I call that descrimination, and if I could I would sue the sand out of his ass. He has the thought process that women should speak when spoken to, etc. He's from India, if that helps. I have nothing against any race for any reason, but damn this man is under my skin. 
 
well anyway, i have a new boss, and told him I was in the process of looking for another job, that maybe he can work for the president for 7 years and be ok with it, but I could not. But did let him know I'd give "him" the decency not to just walk out, however I would love to just quit and say fuck off sam. 
I am a better person than that. This would leave everyone here baffled and not knowing what to do. I can't do that to them. To Sam you bet your sweet ass, but this really doesn't effect him, it effects those who would be picking up where I left, unknowing what i left at that. 
 
well that's heather in a nut shell. Now if Mercury would just be normal again I might be a completly happy person. HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA Yeah right..

      I had a weird dream last night, or it could have been this morning. I was back in Oklahoma, at my ex's house, getting things that I wanted out of his house. One of my old friends, Misty was there, with Bo, together. Misty is married to my ex Mike, which I thought was weird. 
 
But they were together, and she was trying to pull my hair out, while I was getting all of my stuff, telling me that it was her's now. She's as small as a toothpick so in my dream I slapped her across the face, and she flew threw the wall. I was looking through lotions (? lotions) and picking which ones I was going to take with me, along with the remainder cloths I had there, and books. She kept telling me it's all mine, your kids are mine, he's mine. You can have the ex, but the kids are mine. (this could have something to do with the idea, that Misty is there all the time in reality, and hangs out with Seth, when I was visiting him he called me MeMe which is what Misty goes by)
 
Brian was there with me also, there was a party in the living room, garage area, and he was hanging out with Bo, and all the old Mustang people (which involved drugs) and i remember walking by watching him talk to Bo, and do drugs with Bo, and it made me ill. 
 
I remember waking up saying no Brian's not going to do that, going back into my dream, and ripping him away from the event, dream, idea. 
 
It's kinda doing something weird to me today, I know it was a dream, but almost real and scary. I guess it's cause I know what would happen if we got into that lifestyle. Which will never happen. But wholy hell.

      Well I made it through the week! Without a Bo fight, or a Lori fight to the best of my knowledge. 
 
Makin bacon, waiting to hear the surprise news. Which I will not disclose. >:)
 
It's the weekend, and Ostara, I believe I'm going to enjoy it to the fullest with the family I have here. We are going to do egg devination tomorrow, boil some eggs, write our desires on it, and see what grows for the next year. I love having children around during solstice, equinox, ect.

      It means the first day of the rest of my life, leaving a fools life to live one of happiness, togetherness, and love. 
 
One year ago today, Brian and I got together, now it was earlier than that but for sakes of the ex's we will call it FOOLS day.. Get it.. huh huh huh????? 
 
I will always cherish this day, it means alot to me. Escaping from hell, releasing the demon, whatever you would like to call it. Leaving your asshole ex husband. Yeah I like that one. 
 
I really can't say much bad about Bo as of late, with the exception of this week, but I believe Mercury has something to do with it. It seems to have a revolving issue with Cancerians I have found, and Mr Mercury and I should sit down and shoot the shit someday to discuss his plans with this whole retro idea. Bo and I should be as far away from eachother now, if not further, when Mercury is retro. 
 
But that's getting off the subject. ******BRIAN ******* ahh, my dreamly love, that means the world to me. My steamy Scorpio, who know's all the right things to say, and do, at all the right times. He kisses me, I can feel him, he hugs, me feel that too, and expecially when he tells me he loves me, I doubt not. 
 
Yeah I'm a dork and mushy, but hey I'm a friggin cancer.. What do you expect. LMAO..

You're a fun loving, spontaneous person who is always up for a laugh. People however, have trouble keeping up with you.

      Its Friday the weekend before Memorial weekend, and I have the i don't wanna's. I don't wanna work, I don't wanna sit in this cube for the next 6 hours waiting for my weekend to begin. Alas I'm damned to regardless.
 
So I filed for divorce on Monday, Bo sent the papers back signed, along with a money order to pay for the divorce. So that was extreamly nice of him, along with the fact that he wants this done as much as I want this done. Always a great combination. 
 
Then we got home Monday evening to recieve a letter from Lori's lawywer that she has also filed for divorce on Monday. Woo hoo.. So we are both starting the divorce process, I wonder who will get divorced first. Doesn't really matter since it's both being done, and we will both soon be free of the ex's. WOOHOOO.. and not living in sin. LMFAO! Sin.. 
 
I did our bills this paycheck, along with next paycheck to see what kind of $ we will have, and things look good. If we can be responsible with our spending over the next month then I think we will be out of the hole with having to borrow money from the loan sharks. Which is what is killing us as of late. Along with not paying the liquor stores rent with our drinking standards latley. LOL.But I have budgeted all our misc items that we normally buy also and things really look good. Getting caught up on bills and payments for the next two checks will put us at having a few hundered extra the next month. So that's good. We have to start preparing to pay child support to lori soon too, since the divorce is coming up. Which is to be expected, just unsure of what amount to expect. 
 
I guess we will find out soon enough. 
 
Going to Pixie and Dirks this Sunday for a potluck cookout. Her GF from Ohio is coming up and she wanted to have a little get together so that's what we are planning for Sunday. Nothing else going on though. I have a Dentist appt Tuesday to get my root canal retreated. I swear I paid $1500 out of pocket to get the root canal origionally, and someone didn't do it right, so now I have to shell out another $369 (with insurance)to have it done again. Gods I love dentists. Maybe I need to go to school and be a dentist. 
 
Other than that if I'm board later I'll probably write some more about nothing. LOL

      I come back to work from taking 3 days off, to shit, everywhere. Which I expected but come on, I worked half the time I was off. Which totally sucked. But I did it cause I'm a worthy worker, yet the president of the company doesn't seem to think so. Ahh who gives a rats ass right??? Not me.
 
So the divorce papers came back yesterday from me fed-xing the papers to Bo cause it was a "hurry" to get them to him, then he took his time getting them back. I'm really not bitching about it, because he's paying for the divorce. He blames the marriage on me. Saying I pushed him into it, and he wanted to wait. As I recall he did not. And he wanted to do it just as I did. He said he did it for me. "whatever" Blame who you want it really doesn't matter. He also called it a marriage of convenience. Which really pisses me off. Does he think it was convenient for me to WORK for 4 years why he sat home and slang drugs? Does he think it was convenient for me to take care of the kids while he frolicked off and did whatever?? I know he worked a bit in there, (more slinging than anything)but I find nothing convenient about that. Putting up with each others shit for so long wasn't convenient.. Nothing about the marriage was convenient. So I don't know what he's talking about. We did have a nice conversation yesterday about the kids. I told him how Daegan is ready for potty training, and he told me about his job, one that he actually gets a real paystub from. (WOW)And how Seth was doing, they are going camping this weekend. I asked if the parenting plan was suffice for the summer and he seemed happy with it. So now alls we have to do is figure out when to exchange the kiddo's. Which should be interesting. Then I got a bill in the mail for Bo for OG&E (electric) which he told me he would pay. My bankruptcy went through on the 14th so it's not like I can go back and add it, and it's only $156, but it's not mine to pay. I was decent enough to leave the shit on, in my name for my son, and he's going to do this? I asked him to pay it, and if he's not going to pay it I need to know so I can set up some kind of arrangement with the collection company to get it paid off. *sigh*
 
My tooth is aching like fuck! We don't have any dental insurance till the 1st of June which isn't that far away, but I have to have another root canal on a tooth that's already had a root canal and is crowned. Gods that's going to be expensive. The insurance company will pay 1000 of expenses but the rest is mine, and the Dr they refferend me to doesn't' take payment plans. It's not like I have 500 to just fork out. I need someone who will let me pay them out. I don't' have a credit card just to put it on, cause of course my credit sucks. So I'm just kinda screwed right now. 
 
In my vacation time I went and got my CO license, which they will mail to me in 3-4 weeks. Which they punched a hole in my OK license and now it's invalid. Half the people I show it to, they won't take it, so I'm just kinda screwed with that too. But I'm on my way to being a coloradoian and that's kinda cool. I got my emissions and vin verification for my car,and just need to go get the expensive ass tags for the car. I already have insurance so that I'm not worried about. I also went and watched Van Helsing, it was ok, one I'd rather of rented than paid so much to go watch. But I guess you sometimes you win sometimes you loose. Other than that we sat around, I cleaned the house, did the laundry, you know normal weekend stuff. 
 
Lets see what else is going on.. Oh work sucks, but anyone who reads the blog already knows that. I'm awaiting my D date when they lay me off, so I can draw unemployment and go to school. I've already checked out the phlebotomy school here in Denver, and it's only 1295 for the class so that's relatively cheap. I'm going to take the class. It's only 10 weeks, and I'm pretty much guaranteed a job when I get out. So kiss my ass telecom world!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
 
My girlfriend got a job offer (she lives in OK) to move to Dallas, raising her pay by 12,000 and she's not sure if she wants to go.. I told her if she didn't' go, I'd grow my hair long, change my name and take her place. LMAO. I'm some what serious. She asked her BF to move with her, his response "lets talk about it when it gets closer" and the fucker asked her to marry him.. Apparenlty I guess this isn't what he wants. They really don't belong together anyway. He's 29 still lives at home with mom, (well until he moved in with her) and just had his first real job since he was 16 which he got fired from. He's a slinger like Bo was, but she wants him to grow up do this and that, and I just don't see him giving all that up for her. They fight way to much and it's really not worth either of their times to stay together, yet they do.. ??? It's like a Heather Bo story all over again. I feel sorry for her, and I tell her what she should do, but she has to figure that out on her own. When she's ready she'll let go, just like I did. People told me for years, get out, run now while you can.. and I didn't. I took me to wake up to leave. Not what anyone else said.. ME. So I love her, and listen to her, and still tell her how I feel, knowing one day she will do the right thing. 
 
I think that's a good pick up of me where I left off last.

      I had this vauge dream last night, that we were in a bad thunder storm, with tornado sirins going off, and I took a pregnancy test cause I hadn't started yet. Thinking it would come out negative because my tubes were tied, I didn't think twice about looking at it, I was in the bedroom putting on makeup, blue and white shades of eye shadow in strips???? Then Brian comes walking out the bathroom white, with the test, and says what do two pink lines mean? I dropped my stuff and said oh my gods we're pregnant. I was so excited and couldn't believe it. How could I be pregnant if my tubes were tied? I remember the room being dark only lit by candles and it glowing a nice shade of blue. 
 
I woke up this morning and told Brian about the dream, he kinda mumbled it was only a dream and went back to bed. 
 
I wish I were able to get pregnant again, maybe one day we can afford in vetro..

      I'm having one of those days where I'm not sure if I'm pissed, or happy. I'm pretty happy and have been most of the day, which under current circumstances is just fabulous.
 
The money from the evil sister came Friday, so that was a bonus. Then I made Brian go close and open a new checking account, and we got the $247 reversed, so all in all all my bitches last week, subsided Friday evening. Which was great!!!!
 
Saturday we went down to Colfax and walked the strip, went to a witchy shop and got me some new herbs, yeah! Then we went to Pixie and Dirks, HAD A BLAST!!! Ended up getting to funny to drive home and slept on their futon, (which was really comfortable). Brian talked all the way home about how bad he needed that, and was so glad we had such great friends as them. And I have to agree. :D
 
Sunday I sat on my butt and didn't do crap all day, ok well I made breakfast, and did a load of laundry, but geesh we left Pixies at the butt crack of dawn. Of course after Brian hugged the porcelain god. LMAO.. Poor Guy.. But he seemed to be giggly and happy after he threw up so that's good.. Eh?? :)He cooked me dinner last night, crawfish et something(spell check put toffee LMAO) over blackened catfish.. MMMM I ate it for lunch today, which made the pregnant girl at work sick. LOL.. 
 
I still haven't heard from the notorious ex about the divorce papers. Go figure. I've left messages, emails, etc.. Funny when he wants something done, I jumped, now that I want something done, he's a flake.. Mental note to self.. Fuck Bo... (not literally anymore ever) but don't jump to his beck and call, flip him the finger and do it when your damn good and ready.. Can't help the little mental notes to self.. 
 
umm I changed my blog as you can plainly see.. i couldn't help it this one's so much cuter. 
 
Today is a much better day than the entire last week.. I'm so glad for the first time in my life it's Monday. 
 
Brian and I decided not to go to oklahoma this weekend. 1st we can't afford it. Let me break it down, I have to get tags for my car in CO, that's umm $300, then an oil change $45 (i use synthetic oil) and a transmission flush $99. Well right there is $445, not including the gas for me alone there and back $100 then for Brian back $50 and getting his tires rotated and alligned $50, and getting him a legal tag $75.. let me add all that up.. $669 nice rounded of #'s but we aren't made of $$$ and that's just not fesible right now. So we are going to work on getting my car legal here, and we are still taking the time off and going camping. I'll have off till next wednesday, taking 1/2 day friday due to court. I'll finally be rid of my debts, (well in my mind) friday, yeee hawwwww. 
 
So I really can't bitch (gasp for the first post in how long???) things this week thus far are going great.. 
 
Cheers~~~~~!!!!!

      I'm to the point right now, with all this negative stuff going on, to hire someone to take a few people in this world out. Not that I would actually go through with it, but the thought sounds great.. and gives me the warm fuzzies inside.. 
 
My post yesterday about Bank 1 taking money out of the bank unauthorized.. yeah well Lori told them to do it. Fucking Bitch.. I just sent Brian an email telling him to get a lawyer.. Get this divorce going so the bitch can't do this again. OMFG.. That was our money not hers.. Bank 1, is not allowing Brian to hear the recorded conversation, and told him they would send him a letter advising why. So I'm calling Bank 1 to see why they can't let him hear the recorded conversation, it says its meant for the cusotmers safty as well as theirs.

      I really think I've hit a spout of bad luck here latley.. I'm not sure how much more bad luck I can handle or want for that matter. 
 
We got a cash advance yesterday for $300 to cover our expenses till we get paid again, I went and checked out account today, and Bank 1 took out $247 for something of Brians. So now we have $50ish left and still have a check coming out which leaves  $19.. *sigh* I want to cry right now but am attempting to hold it in. I want to scream at Brian, but he swears he didn't authorize it. So I'm just sitting here with a ball in my throat waiting for time to pass so I can leave and cry in my car.  
 
I'm so tired of.... being broke, getting up in the morning going to a job I hate, still being married, still dealing with Bo, still dealing with Lori (although she's been extreamly quiet which is almost concerning) dealing with my sister, and even my mom. 
 
I was just bitching to my mom about my sister the other day and how she keeps neglecting to send the car payment for the jeep. My mom is supposed to be sending  a birthday package for Daegan for 5 months now.. 5 friggin months.. Jesus mom, is the shit you bought her even going to fit? She was supposed to over night it yesterday, talked to her yesterday and she didn't do it. ( I wanted to scream at her) she said I promise I'll do it today. I would bet my left butt cheek that she doesn't. 
 
I'm so tired of every entry I put in here being negative, and shitty and all over blah. I'm not that type of person, is this my residual Karma coming back to haunt me? Are we getting hit with all this shit cause it's our time? I'm so tired of it.. I so want things to be normal, my entries to be happy and lively and the way they should. 
 
Bo's not replied to me that he's got the divorce papers, he's not answering my calls, and it is really pissing me off. I send him a 4 paragraph email and he replies to all these questions etc, with "right". If I were there I would smack the smirk I know he's wearing off his face because this is what he wants to do to me. AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
 
Please don't offer me a gun right now. The way I'm feeling I will use it. 
 
The only thing tht is going good for me right now Pixie. She came to my work yesterday, we sat and had a great girlie lunch and I so needed that. Brian is going good for me too, but she's the only one not fucking me in one way shape or form. I have family, ex's the entire state of OK, banks, etc.. all wanting me to bend over and they can form a line. 
 
So Pixie if you read this... thanks for being my one friend who isn't trying to sleep with me. :)

      *sigh* Bo is refusing to let Seth come stay the week with me, without legal documentation that he will come back. I have filled out my do it yourself divorce packet, and am going to over night it to him so he will sign it and get the peace of mind he needs to send Seth. Although I have talked shit in the past about doing something bad to him, I don't have the lack of heart to do it to either of them. First it would hurt Seth so bad that I woudn't be the good mother he has in his eyes, and second as much as I hate to say it, I can't do that to Bo either. He will eventually fall on his own, if he keeps going at the pace he's at I don't need to step in and make it any worse than it already is. 
 
Friday I got an email from Bo stating as much as he's not trying to bring his thoughts and feelings into the decision of to or not to allow seth to come, we had to come to some compromise/reassurance that he would come home. I said fine I'll go get a divorce and then the courts can decide when I get to see him. Well I guess that's the kind of reassurance he needs, which I can completley understand. I have the same thoughts going through my head when I send Daegan, will he send her back, will he try to get custody of her, what will he try to do??? So I know exactly how he feels. I just hate that it has to come to this for me to see my son. Expecially since this weekend is mothers day weekend, and until he gets those papers he isn't going to allow him to come. I asked him what are you going to tell Seth? How will Seth understand that? He won't. It's not something you can say, yes you can go to Mommy's then all of a sudden say no, and not give a relevent good explination?? I mean a 5 yr old needs answers. 
 
I asked Bo if he would help pay for the divorce, it's going to cost me $184.00 to file. Hopefully it won't cost more than that. he said he would help pay it. He said he would even file there, and have it done today. The thing is, you have to have valid dates, address's information, etc.. It's not that easy. He said send it to me, I told him I already paid for the packet, just let me do it. Plus he's seeing everything that we are filling for, I'm not trying to hide anything from him about it. 
 
On top of all this I get these shitty emails from him, such as your a cunt, but I'm not trying to belittle you. And quit provoking me to be shitty, when I reply simply and trying to stay as far away from confrontation with him as possible. He's impossible to talk to, as much as I'm sure I'm impossible to talk to him. We are like oil and water.. and I want a box of matches. 
 
I just want this done and over with. Once the divorce is final, I don't want to hear a single word about our marriage, because it no longer exists. It's null void and gone. Leave me alone unless it has something to do with the kids, as will I you. 
 
I asked him to make an effort to see Daegan, he has to try. Call me and tell me when you want her. His reply " I want her every waking hour of every day" Well no shit but realisticly, BO you need to let me know your availablitly. " I am always available for her" Jesus Christ. Then he says how about this, when you knwo she'll be free I would love to have her." That's not making an effort to see your daugther, that's being simple. You don't call to talk to her, (even if it's just to say hi is daegan there?) that's all you would have to say to me. Make a fucking effort to be in your daughters life!!!!!!!!!!! That's all I ask. When I make an effort to see my son, I get shot down with shit like this. He drives me nuts. 
 
There's little I can do right now though, if he doesn't send Seth here this weekend, he'll be lucky to see daegan. No you know what I'll let him have her.. I on the other hand have signed my papers and by that time they will be filed with the courts. Even if they weren't fuck it, I'm not a shitty, arrogant ass hole and not allow my daughter to see her father. I'm better than that shit. I don't need to play little games and use my children, and hurt them because I'm a fucker.. That's him. 
 
I want to scream, cry, yell and kick someone's ass. I want to flip Bo the finger, and have power in that finger, to blow his head off. In my dreams it will happen. IN reality I just want to be as decent to him as I can to see my son. Fucking sick that I have to kiss ass. Fucking sick that he does that to me. I want the divorce final, so the only thing I have to do is tell him to go fuck himself. I get my son when the courts (here's the paper) says I do.. And if you don't like it you can go to court.. 
 
Sigh...

      I'm having one of those days wondering where do I go from here???
 
Driving to work this morning I had a flash back of when I was 17 and graduated highschool, thinking I had everything in front of me, at 24 I now realize what is that everything, what am I put here to do? Why am I where I am now? Well I know why I'm where I am now, but is this really where I want to be? Need to be? Should be? 
 
When your 17 you think you can do anything, that life will teach you what you need to know and you will learn and grow from that. I truely still believe this. Yet I'm struggling financially, hate my job, can never stay above float and feel is this all worth it? Moving to Colorado was a great thing, I'm very glad to be here, love the area, love the view i have from my apartment, love my friends that i have made. Is this enough to keep me here? These are simple things that I like, not things that will keep me a float and help me when I retire. I don't even have a good 401K plan where I'm at now. Nor could I afford to put money into it. 
 
I'm scared. I don't want to fail, I don't want to go broke, I don't want to loose everything I've worked so hard to have. I've lost what I had once, becuase I chose to leave a life that wasn't good for me and I believe that was the best thing I could have ever done, but looking at what I have now, I don't want to loose it either. The thought of me loosing my job, not being able to pay my bills, getting another job, for less pay.. I can't do it.. We struggle now as it is, and asking for a raise is really out of the question. Yet I do 5 peoples job and get paid for 1. I need something.. I need some clarity, Heather this is where your going with your life. This is where you need to be.. This is what you need to do.. I wish I had a voice in my head that would tell me what that is.. yet nothing.. 
 
I'm so tired of failure.. I'm so tired of not living upto what I expected of myself. I'm greatful to be making the money I am, but it's not enough. When is it ever enough? It never is. Maybe this is the point. 
 
I dunno...

      Either break you or make you. 
 
Last night I was asleep, talking in my sleep, and apparently went Heather/Bo style on Brian. I swear I was dreaming about Bo, while all this happened. Although I really don't recall it, I feel really bad about it none the less. 
 
I apparenlty started talking in my sleep saying Stop, stop it Seth. Really don't remember, then woke up and asked for some water. Brian told me to sit up to take a drink, and I popped of I'm not a fucking child. (I've never said anything like this before to him, why would I now, although I've said something like this to Bo which makes me think I was half way in sleep and half way out of it) Then he said something like damn what the fuck was that about, and I said what did you say, and mumbled again about I'm not a child. Then passed out. 
 
Brian woke me up pissed as hell, (which I would be too, he said he had a Lori flash back in my shoes, which is not something I want to be). I really didn't recall it, and if I did I truly thought I was talking to Bo. Which doesn't make the situation any better, why am I dreaming of Bo?!?! Where would that come from? Don't treat me like a child? I've been known to say jacked up shit in my sleep. I once told Bo he was no better than his mother, and a piece of shit, in my sleep. Now if I "actually" said this I don't remember, and if was actually the "truth" I will never know. 
 
You know I read that Enneagram thing yesterday and was a little disturbed by it's information. The way I was when I was with Bo, is nothing like the person I am with Brian. I am totally different, and the way things went last night, it so reminded me of a Heather Bo issue. Which the personality type I am red lined the actions I was with Bo.. Not who I am with Brian. Wondering if this is what's to come with him? Is this the person I am to be for the rest of my life? Selfish, and manipulative? Controlling and wanting? I could do that with Bo.. We'd been together long enough to read eachother to do that.. It was more of a hate situation most of the time with us, where with Brian and I we laugh and talk and get along. It scares me that I will be the one to break this relationship up. I don't want it to be either of us mind you, but for stupid reasons such as "Can be manipulative and self-serving, instilling guilt by telling others how much they owe them and make them suffer. Abuse food and medication to "stuff feelings" and get sympathy. Undermine people, making belittling, disparaging remarks. Extremely self-deceptive about their motives and how aggressive and/or selfish their behavior is. / Domineering and coercive: feel entitled to get anything they want from others: the repayment of old debts, money, sexual favors. / Able to excuse and rationalize what they do since they feel abused and victimized by others and are bitterly resentful and angry. Somatization of their aggressions result in chronic health problems as they vindicate themselves by "falling apart" and burdening others. Generally corresponds to the Histrionic Personality Disorder and Factitious Disorder."
 
This is me to a T with Bo.. We were both the same way to eachother. This isn't the way I feel with Brian, nor the way I want to treat him. Where do you decide what you can and cannot control? I know this is only a stupid test but it really hit home, and struck somethings up for me. I refuse to ever be that Heather again. We went through so many ugly things, said so many shitty things, that still hurt even now.. I don't feel that would happen with Brian but the idea "it could" scares me. I love him so much and don't want to loose him over stupidity and selfishness.
 
Being who I am now is so very important to me, I don't ever want to be the person I was before.. Really I don't see that happening, there aren't drugs involved with us, there aren't things tieing us together to make us stay if we both aren't happy. I dunno.. I think maybe I'm thinking to much into this then I think maybe I'm not thinking enough into it..

      It's great here, nice and cold, 60 degree's I believe, chilli weather. I think I might cook a chilli tonight. After I go to the grocery store, which should be interesting. It's been a while since I've been to the store with both kids. LOL. I want this Mommy, I want that Mommy... LOL.. I'm really looking forward to it though. :D
 
Work sucks as usual, and still no bites from the resumes I've put out, I can't write a cover letter for the life of me. Seems talking about myself isn't a strong point. Yet I can do it with ease about my troubles. Go figure. 
 
I tried to get my tags for my car yesterday, and have been trying for the last week, everytime I go back I seem to bring the wrong damn paper. I finally cried to the lady at the agency yesterday and she gave me a paper tag so I'm not driving around super illegal. My tags were 6 months out of date. Bad Heather I know.. But they're expensive here and not something I just have the cash to go get. But regardless I have to have them. 
 
It's 4:20.. 
 
Lori sent Brian an email yesterday demanding x amount of $ for child support, and wanted it yesterday, plus this and that and day care and blah blah blah. I told him to tell her she would get half of what she wanted today, and the other half when we get paid again. As far as I know the courts are willing to work with you on when you pay all of it, as long as it all gets paid. I told Brian to quit paying for their internet, to shut it off, if she wants child support she can get her own damn internet. And they still have their insurance together, it's cheap I understand but this is a convienience for them, not a necessity, since she's getting child support she will be able to affor more expensive insurance right? Gods I'd love to smack the hell out of her. She called him a man child. While she's acting like the child. Brian does over react with her, but she knows how to push his buttons and piss him off, as I do Bo. I refrain now a days from doing that, since he's always pissed anyway about something. 
 
I'm deciding if we should stay in Colorado or move. Being closer to the kids is really important now, and we are both extreamly far away from our kids.  Plus finding a job here apparenlty is not that easy. Not that it would be easier anywhere else but, I can't take less than what I currenlty make and make it here, and everyone that I've seen adds for offers less, much less. Now if it were like 2-3 grand less, I would consider it, but it's like 8 grand less. I can't do that. So I don't know we will see. I'll submit some resumes in Dallas, and see what comes of there. It's not where I want to be, but it's where we need to be for both our kids. I refuse to move back to Oklahoma. 
 
We shall see.

      I'm sitting here on the computer, watching both my kids playing all over my bed. My nicely draped shams are now being worn by a much missed 5 year old,and his sister who missed him badly. I wish I could say Bo and I's meet up went good, but it didn't. It got ugly and I got called a cunt, and a bitch or wait was that heartless bitch.. Ahh yes that was it. Funny though when I got out of the car, looked into his, there in the driver seat plain as day was a pen encasing wrapped in foil. And since I once was a crank head myself, know how easy it is to lie to everyone telling them that they've quit and haven't, just trying to hide it, but fuck Bo you had it sitting in your damn driver seat plain as day for everyone to see. I'm not sure if that was put there as a peace offering hoping Brian wasn't with me and he could sit down and we could smoke and catch up on old times or what. Regardless if Brian was there or not, I would never touch that shit again, and would hope he'd be respectful enough not to offer. Yet again this IS Bo we are talking about and I wouldn't put that senario past him. 
 
So I went into the restaurant, Dairy Queen, got to love those "meeting" places exs go to "exchange" kids. Anyway Bo and Seth were playing on the playground, and I'm glad first off that I found them because my cell phone didn't work in New Mexico, and we were just guessing on a spot in a town to meet at. I told him stop at the first place you come to that is a restaurant, and he did, and by accident I was stopping there to call Bo and pulled up to him. Nicely done if I do say so myself. Any way back to the playground, so they are out there, Bo is hiding behind some of the playground, why I don't know, so I tell Daegan to go see Daddy. Insta-latch onto Mommy and had ABSOLUTELY nothing to do with Bo. Which really doesn't surprise me. He doesn't call, doesn't write, we have eye ball chat so we can see each other via internet, I mean come on what more would a child/parent ask for. We never use it. Really pisses me off. 
He tried to get her to come to him, she was stuck to my butt, holding on for dear life. He gets all pissed off then comes around the corner of Dairy Queen, to find what, who? Brian sitting at a bench, I think this is where I get called the cunt, and heartless bitch. Wailing in front of everyone our business, as he's walking out to his car to get me Seth's bag. Making a complete ass of himself. I can't make a kid go to their father, I didn't coax her into acting this way. "You took her away from me", I took her away from that lifestyle, and if that's taking her away from her father then yes I did. I can atleast get one of them away from him, he's a crank head, Gods love him for giving me two beautiful children, but he's gone, won't be coming back to reality, when it comes to he and I. I'm an evil bitch in his eyes which is fine, I'm just glad staying that way. >:)
 
I told him Daegan knew who her daddy was, just adjusting to him being there is hard for her. She did this last time he came to get her, why this time is any different is beyond me. (the crank he was skitzy, scary thought sending my kids back to him isn't it?) He screamed three weeks I will see you back here in three weeks, then pealed out.
 
Great time fun adventure, but really looking back it was funny. I left him a message yesterday on his voice mail letting him know we made it back ok, and the kids were happy. He sends me an email today, I thought you would have had the decency to atleast call and let me know the kids were ok, or send me an email, but no, your still the fucking cunt you always were. I replied, and your still the jack ass you always were, check your voice mail. I'll be glad when this divorce is over. I know he'll never be out of my life because we have kids, but I won't have to deal with this shit anymore. Geessh.. 
 
I have Seth and right now that's all that matters to me!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

      A little Marvin Gay for me readers today. 
 
I'm going to get Seth tomorrow. WOOOOOHOOOOOOOO. (does little happy dance) We are meeting in Clayton NM. I'm advised by Pixie she's never been to NM and to pick her up a post card. Wonder if I should send it from there too?? hehehehe.
 
I've been a busy bee this week. I got Seth and Daegan a new sitter lined up for the next three weeks, then it's Bo's deal to get them care while he has them both. Then when Daegan gets back she'll go back to the old day care again. I worked it out nicely so we will have $ for my birthday, evil little wench aren't I? Na.. 
 
Then Thursday I had oral surgery on my friggin root canal gone to shit. Gesh when will it end?! They had to cut into my gums, and it's like the 2nd to the last tooth (chomper I want to say it's 14 but not sure if anyone would understand that) and cut the root out from the top. I had a huge cyst there so I'm glad I was all doped up or I would have puked. I could see what the dr was doing from the reflection in his glasses, and it wasn't pretty. Nor did it feel pretty afterwards. I have 4 stitches in my gums, and they don't come out for a week. I went home and slept till 3. This morning I woke up resembling a chimpmunk. My boss said I look cheaky today. LOL
 
So I got my oil changed today getting ready for the journey tomorrow.Bo decided last minute he didn't want to meet in KS so for the last minute request he's driving 80 miles more than we are. It will take him 6 hours to get there, where it will take us 4. (i'm laughing). Well what does he expect a break? Cause he has to drive 50 miles down to a friends house in Weatherford? No I dont' think so. Plus he hasn't answered my calls for the last 3 days trying to figure out what was going on. I hate that about him. He does it on purpose to piss me off. But it doesn't work anymore. I just keep calling and playing nice on the voice mails I leave. If you can't kill em', kill em' with kindness. :D

      I was so worried I wouldn't be able to get Seth this summer because of finances with the current daycare, well a gf of mine has a friend who uses this lady for daycare, she's going to charge me $175 a week for both kids. I'm so friggin extatic. That I CAN afford. That I can handle. So I called Bo, worked it out with him and I'm getting Seth on the 12th of this month, thru the 3rd of July. Then he's getting Daegan from the 3rd thru the 24th. And he was fine with all of it. I'm so extatic. WOOOHOOOOOO.. I talked to seth about it today and he wanted to know if he could ride his bike there and meet me half way. LOL.. I told him he would have to wait. 
 
Man what a relief. 
 
Now working on getting Brian's kids here. Lori's giving him shit, he's giving it back and they seem to have issues agreeing on a divorce scheme that fits both thier needs. 
He asked me about consulting a lawyer, and I seem to think that might not be a bad idea right now. I don't want her to fuck him any more than she can. She started spouting shit off such as you have an education and I don't, so you make more money than I do. Shit I know people who are working at MC Donalds making more money than she is, she's in a shitty state. What does she expect? If she moved here she might make more money than he does, and i imagine if he moved there he might make less than she does. I'm not sure if that would hold up in court. If shes' trying to get alamoney or what. She left so she can't. Or can she? I hate all this legal shit.  So I do think its a good idea for him to at least talk to a lawyer, see what his rights are, what she can and can't do to him. 
That would make him and I, i'm sure feel better. What a cunt. But of course we already knew that right. 
 
I went and watched the new potter last night, and it was GREAT. I'm not going to give it away, cause i'm not like that.. But it was awesome.. All the kiddo's look so grown up. LOL

      Well all kinds of crap has happened today to me and it's only 2:42 pm. 
 
First, I was sitting at my desk this morning, with these lovely female cramps thinking, hey I should be starting any day now, and I went to the potty, and lovely I started. Now as I was thinking I should be starting any day now, it occured to me that I have no tampons here at work. Looking around at all the women I work with, they all happen to be of age where their monthly cycle doesn't come anymore. The only other lady I could turn to, is pregnant. Maybe.. just maybe she'd have a spare somewhere in her desk. Nope. She did give me a quarter to go to the bathroom and buy the card board rip your insides out tampon that the buildings so gracioucly offer, and the damn machine was broke. So here I am with nothing.. wondering how in the hell I'm going to pull this one off, when Brian calls and says I'm at the house, want me to bring you lunch.. I said yes, and Tampons.. 
To save my day a man came and delivered me tampons. Thank you Brian!!!!
 
The phone has been ringing off the wall today at work, I'm on hold right now trying to find time to type something up here. I've been wanting to blog all morning, I got in the car and had lots of things I wanted to talk about, and don't know where I'll find the time to write about it.
 
I am though going to a sneak preview of Harry Potter tonight with a friend from work Amy. Her husband couldn't go and she offered me the ticket. Brian is staying with Daegan while I go watch the movie. I'm so excited!
 
A customer asked me out today, after I jumped down his throat for not listening to me. He sounded Russian, and asked if I was having a bad day, I said yes. Asked me if I was married, I said no. (well I'm getting a divorce) then asked me if I'm dating anyone (this is all over the phone mind you) and I said yes, ahh well that's ok I can still take you out. LOL. I told Brian, he laughed. Well sorta. Said he'd throw a bottle of vodka at him. LMAO.. 
 
We went to Pixie and Dirk's Sunday for a cookout. Brian got trashed. That's a whole nother entry, as some things were said when we got home that concern me. Maybe I'll be able to find time later to write about it. 
 
I had a dream about Bo last night, that we went to meet to get Seth, and he had long braids in his hair, (which he never would wear) and facial hair that was all braided up too. He was shooting up something, because I found the needle, he wasn't quiet about it either. I asked him if he had been doing crank and he said not smoking it anymore, and I thought great, then I found the needle. I went to his house, and it was trashed, Seth looked like hell, all dirty and gritty, and I grabbed Seth and told Bo I was taking him. He said over my dead body, and I shot him. Interesting dream I do say. I haven't talked to Bo since last Tuesday, and I am a bit concerned. I know Bo just does this to be a shit, or he's got other things going on, but I really wanted to talk to Seth. I miss him so bad! Daegan has been asking for him too. I want to get him for a month this summer but I don't see how I can afford the daycare to get him. Geesh this sucks.

      I wrote this to Brian today and thought I'd stick it in here.. Makes me feel kinda fluffy inside but hey..
 
It’s not every day a blue moon comes along.. Kinda like how you fell into my life. This rite will be a celebration for me, with you.. You are my blue moon.. :D
 
I'm going up to Estes the weekend, and called Bella to see if she wanted to do ritual, and Nica too.. I figured we'd make it a friendship/love ritual because like Brian these people just don't come around like, like the blue moon, they are sacred.. so I'm being a dork and asking to do something sweet and pretty.. cause well it means something to me damnit! ;D

      I'm so glad its Friday! Everyday I come to work at this damn place I loathe it even more than the day before. Really the "Boss Man" has become more of an ass everyday that I see him. I don't know if its cause I hate him more and more everyday or if he really is being an ass. LMAO
Regardless I'm ready for this to be over. I know I'm not going to know what to do with myself once I am off, and I've sparked all these ideas in my head of ways to occupy my (and Daegans) time while I'm attemtping to be a stay at home mom for about six months. Which I will drive myself insaine, hell I couldn't handle it for 6 weeks when I was on maternity leave. LOL But the idea's that I have for when I'm home is to sit down and make infusion oils as well as soaps, I make a great carpet fresher/cleaner also. So these things I'm thinking up in my head could be sold, not sure on Ebay or what not but I've got "ideas" and need to do something with them to occupy my "off" time.
 
I have a weekend job for a little while until I move in April but am going to draw unemployment till I move in April. Which is a great thing for me and Brian both. We have wonderful friends who love us, and who I cherish deeply with all my heart, without them this move in April would not be possible. So cheers to those who shall remain unnamed till the time is right! LOL
 
Daegan was sick Wed and Thurs with a fever of 102-103. I got it to go down here and there, but I really hate when she doesn't feel good. Since she's been back she hasn't eaten much and has been a super crab. I'm sure it's readjusting to being back home again, but I really do hate that we have to do this everytime. She gives Brian the eye now.. Refuses to eat, unless its cereal (which momma ain't havin that) and all around has a crappy attitude. Got to love the time well spent with Dad. Geeshhh..
 
Brian and I are doing good, better than the beginning of the week. Where I wondered why he came back from his (manly camping trip) to be a big ass. He was super quiet for like three days and when he wasn't quiet he was snappy. Which I can understand maybe the quiet nature time allowed him room to think what all is currenlty going on in his life, rather than it being clouded with TV and computer and Heather time. Regardless he's mood has shifted and he seems to be back to somewhat normal again. Which makes me really happy. I hate when I don' t know whats going on with us, but am to afraid to ask for fear of getting my head bit off again. Which now is no longer the case. I think maybe the fear of the divorce to come for him maybe is pushing him away? He said it's going to get ugly. I sit and think and re-read my blog and wonder how on earth could it get any uglier than it already has? I've been through quite a bit already with him, why would I back down and leave now? I'm an adultering cunt whore.. Damn I like that name and would like to keep it! hehehehe.. I mean we've both put up with a lot of shit, from our ex's (my sister) over what we've done, getting slack from our kids, some family, maybe friends.. but those who know us now, and knew us then, know that we belong, and that what we had didn't belong. I feel in all my heart that this man is the one I was meant to be with. I knew the minute I laid eyes on him (and ripped him a new one at work) that something would come of us.. Something more than just friends. I don't want to loose him, or that feeling. He is my world, and I am willing to turn it upside down, side ways and back for him.

      I hate thinking up titles. LOL It cracks me up when I sit and try to think of things to put in the title, but today I think I'll just write about what's been going on. 
 
I picked up Daegan Saturday. Which wasn't the "funnest" trip of my life, but I think the idea that Brian wasn't there made it a bit easier for Bo. I was either there early or he decided to arrive late, not sure, but I sat at Dairy Queen for over an hour waiting on him. Of course we are in the middle of bum fuck and I don't get cell service, and when I tried to use the pay phone, it told me that the call wasn't able to be routed, blah blah blah. So the thoughts going through my head in the waiting time were, he's still at home, he's going to call me and laugh and say you can't have her back, maybe they had a flat tire, maybe they got in a wreck.. Finally he shows up with both kids, and a huge sigh of relief falls over me. By gods he fulfilled his end of the bargain. 
 
Daegan saw me and imediatly tried to jump out of the carseat.. Mommy.. I could see the look in Bo's eyes, he wasn't happy because she doesn't do that for him. Which is hard to explain to somene the reasons why, when he doesn't want to hear it. 
 
There were three bags of cloths he brought back for Daegan, I was excited to see what was in there. I got it home.. *LAUGH* and half the stuff was stained, (prolly from my neice) and the other half was unwearable (to small or to big right now) not including the cloths he did buy for her were all "oklahoma" weather and not "colorado" weather. So what does have tags, that wasn't bought on sale will go back tomorrow. Then the rest of the stuff that I origionally sent for her half of that didn't come back. So I tried to construct an email that wasn't rude thanking him for the cloths that were sent, but wondered if and when he would be sending the remaining cloths back? 
 
He's such a cancer, that its hard to judge which mood he's in at which time. If I say something to piss him off, hell it will be a week before he answers my calls again, and if it's not calls I'm trying to email him with questions, but never get resonses back to the questions I asked initially. 
 
Thus the reason we are getting a divorce. LMAO.. 
 
But I did Daegan's room all pretty for her and when she got home her jaw dropped to the ground, and said ewwwwweeeeee loooookkkk Moommmy.. She was so excited, and by the time we got home it was 10ish.. So she wanted to stay up and play. She slept with me Saturday night and it was soo funny she kept trying to slip out of the bed to go play in her room, and I kept having to tell her, No Daegan it will all still be there in the morning. LOL. When we woke up Sunday she said, can I go play now Mommy? LOL

      Saturday I will be leaving for the last haul to New Mexico to do the kid exchange. This time it will be a bit different. I do not have to do this again till October, but then it will be with my mother, I do not have to see Bo again for a while which I'm sure for the both of us it's a sigh of relief. 
 
I will be going alone this time without Brian, which in ways is a good thing, and in ways is a bad thing. 
 
The good:
 
Bo and I can sit down and talk face to face, rather than via email or the phone about our kids and what is to come of the courts and what we are going to do as parents with them. He won't feel so intimidated because Brian is there. (cause brian has more hair than bo) ok that wasn't nice.. Driving back with my daughter alone will be nice. I've missed her so.. 
 
The bad:
 
I am going all alone, the drive will suck. Bo might say or do something intimidating, hell or even not show, and I wouldn't think twice about tailing my ass to oklahoma and demanding my daugther. I dont think this will be an issue but really you never know. I've done my part in returning his son to him as he was so concerned I wouldn't. He should honor his word. 
 
I wanted my mom to drive with him to meet us, but that's probably not going to happen, she will flake out for sure, or Bo just really doesn't care for her much anymore. She is a user(someone who uses other people and doesn't give anything back type of user), and I'm fully aware of this, understanding that Bo doesn't have to put up with her anymore, why would he want her to go? So my back up plan of making sure he's out the door and on the road with my daughter is somewhat out the door. 
 
But her room is all done and pretty waiting for her. I went to a garage sale last weekend and bought her a little tikes kitchen that she's just going to love, from the free cycle group I got her a small tikes baby buggy that she can push her dollys around in. Also got a bed frame from Pixie which has her bed finally off the floor. So her room looks great, waiting quietly and patiently for her to come home. 
 
Saturday can't come any damn sooner!

      Ok, I'm a slacker, slacking in my blogging abilites bad!
 
Last week was pure hell for me, I assumed that if anything else could have went wrong by gods it did. Bo and I fought most of the week about the kids and parenting/custody abilities. My sister called to side with Bo about my thoughts on taking Seth, and called me a piece of shit, adultering whore, who is super selfish and doesn't give a shit about anyone but herself. Now this is coming from a cunt (yes I use that word extensivly against her damn bitch) who is a user, lives in a trailor and is wanna be poser lesbian who doesn't give a rats ass about her kids. So I told my mother don't ever expect me at family functions if she's going to be there, don't ever expect me to acknowledge her as family because she just broke the bond. Such a hypocrite. 
 
Then to top it off, I go and "look" at getting another job, but isn't for months to come, the boss finds out about it, and yesterday I got the news that i'm getting laid off. 6 weeks from August 1st is my last day. I was freaked out about this because I've never been laid off, never been without a job on my own accord, and trying to find one right now (because I have sent out resumes) is like finding a needle in the hay stack. He did offer un employment which I am graciously going to accept. After I sat down last night and calculated what I would be bringing home, minus daycare i'm still pretty much making what I was here, minus the shit that i get from the boss. I can stay home with Daegan spend much needed time with her, and await my life change in April and live easy till then. If what the payment calculater showed was true i think, or i hope it won't be too bad. 
 
This last Sunday Pixie, Dirk, Brian and I went to the Rennissance Faire. I saw men in kilts. *drool* the fae, kings, queens and little servents all over the place. It was quiet fun and had a blast. I bought a nice pair of dark faerie wings, that I tried to fly with as soon as I got them, but I only paid $25 for them, so they aren't the "flying" pair.. Damnit anyway. *giggle*
 
Then we went to the store so we could get some grub to eat, Brian and Dirk decide to go get some Starbucks Coffee (at 3 in the afternoon) when we come back the two of them from bordem waiting on the slow people at starbucks to make their java, had made pentacles. Pixie gets this idea to make some at home. Grabs the craft box, and we paint, and&nbsp; glue and create pretty little pentacles for all of us. Brian and Dirk even sat down and were crafty with us. We had a great day! One I think I will remember for years to come.

      There are a few things that are going good in my life right now, that I feel I should also post.
 
I may be poor, not able to survive from paycheck to paycheck, but when you think of the friends you have in your life, it makes money look like shit. 
 
I have some wonderful people in my life that I feel I should give credit to my sanity, or helping me keep my sanity. 
 
Last Sunday for the 4th of July Brian and I spent the day with Pixie and Dirk. I love these people, they are the best friends anyone can ask for. They are fun loving, out going, just all around wonderful people to have in your life. For my birthday, Pixie painted me a drinking cup that has a Crab on it with the 69 sign in it, with the words "don't mess with me I'm a crab" along with some great bath soaps, some regular soap a pretty purple towel all placed in this basket, that some how she knew I needed another basket. LOL
 
I've called her probably every day this week to discuss my shitty life, and she is always positve, and helpful and truthful when I need it.You can't ask for a better friend really. 
 
On top of taking me out last night for my birthday. We went to this bar, where there was supposed to be a Pagan Night Out, well there was, and let me tell you all the "weird" pagans were out. Woo that was a interesting thing all together. Then we went for cake afterwards at Denny's, and tipped the poor waiter like 60 cents, all in nickels and pennys. LOL
 
I love her she's a hoot and someone I'm very glad to call a friend!
 
Bella sent me a nice little package also. She made me a wonderful necklass/bracelet that match in moonstone, another blueish bracelet, a toe ring, a few things of soap, and a certificate to get the matching earings that she has yet to make. 
 
Gifts mean nothing to me, but the idea that they cared enough to offer something to celebrate my life means the world to me. I am so greatful to have them in my life, to have met them via the internet. LOL. 
 
I may be poor, but I'm rich in friends~!!!!

      Where should I begin? I'm so pissed right now I'm not sure if I want to cry, scream, bust out, punch something, someone, anyone??? 
 
I will start with my ex, and venture then on to Brians. 
 
BO... Sean.. Fuck stick, fuck stain, piece of shit father, crank head. Hmmm does that catagorize him for you? Yesterday was the first meeting of the courts for the divorce. I called him on his birthday to remind him that he had to be on the phone at 9 his time to discuss the case with the case manager. I call, no answer, I call again, no answer. I left 3 messages for him and no answer. Which concerns me that he was sleeping and my kids were there awake. Which is another story that I will get to shortly. So I go talk to the case manager, and we start talking about the seperation of the kids, and why we want it done that way. I told him I didn't want it done that way that I'm trying to be decent. He says Heather you don't have to be decent. Then advises me that no courts will grant split custody, they will have the children together with the parent that is the most fit. Along with the fact Heather that he doesn't have a job, who's going to give him custody? So he asked me to fill out some paperwork, to get temporary custody of Seth, and get it going now. I was all tore up about this yesterday. I don't want to be a bitch to him, I don't want to hurt him, or seth or anyone else for that matter. I want this divorce to be smooth sailing, and I know somewhere I'm living in a fantacy believing all of this. So I took off work yesterday because I couldn't stop crying, thinking of what I'm about to do. Regardless I know it's the right choice, but it still hurts to have to do this. 
 
Then I decided to get the balls to call Bo this morning to talk about what he missed yesterday, and Seth answers the phone. I'm sitting there in shock thinking Bo let Seth answer the phone, when all of a sudden Seth says "My daddy is sleeping and I can't get him to wake up." I sat there for a second and asked "where is Daegan"
"on the couch watching TV" "where is your dad seth" on the couch sleeping". I almost had a heart attack thinking either he od'd or he's past smooth out not going to wake up. I asked him to try to wake his dad up and he says "I've been trying but can't." SO I hang up with him call my mom and tell her to rush over and get the kids. Bo's passed out and not waking up. I sent him an email that says this:
 
I am not happy with Seth answering the phone this morning telling me that "MY DADDY IS SLEEPING AND DAEGAN AND I ARE TRYING TO WAKE HIM UP"
 
How is that supposed to make me feel? Secure? I think not. 
 
Not including you missed a VERY IMPORTANT CALL with the Courts yesterday, that if you had been on the call like you said you would be would have heard somethings that may disturb you. 
 
Yet I am not your wife anymore, nor am I one to tell you what to do, but your actions cause a reaction on our children. Do you even care about that? 
 
Along with the fact that yesterday was my birthday, and it would have been nice for my kids to have called and wished me a happy birthday, but you couldn't even give me that? 
 
I'm pissed at you! Not that you care! 
 
Heather
 
His reply:
 
Daegan and I had sat back down and fell asleep for maybe 45mins. this morning.  I never got a call from you yesterday checked my phones calls except when we where @ Bass Pro shops where for whatever reason I could not get signal yesterday.  I did not check my messages till this morning.  I've had a challenging time these last three weeks or so when Seth informed me about you calling this morning I wasnt really in the mood to listen anyone bitch at me.  I apologize for not having them call you on your birthday. It was not intentional.  Aside from this year you really don't have much room to bitch @ me concerning birthdays, since this is the 1st one you acted decent to me in aproximately 6years!!!!!!  I just not got my employer info late last night, Im sorry bout this but I have been trying as hard as I can while enjoying the kids and juggling everything else.  Fuck you if anybody has cared about shit the whole way its been me, you and I both know this.!  and if anyone has reason to not care about some shit it would also fall into my vacinity, thank you.  I apollogize again for whatever happened yesterday it was not intentional.  No one more than me would appreciate seperating from you as much as heavenly possible.  I've in no way acted indiganant w/ the children or at least not intentionally.  Your sister was able to see them and your mother came and got them this morning to spend time her time with them.  I was not up your ass the entire time they were with you, but I guess we will forever be bound to your double standard.  Don't go w/o knowing that there are countless thing that occur that more than deserve your interigation of such, but that battle is more-or-less a dead hoarse as far i can see.  I guess come on with the nextt distrubing news Im all but numb to it anymore. 
Apathetically interested 
 
Bo 
 
I called the courts to find out how long it will take for the temp orders to go through, and apparently I didn't fill out all the correct forms, so what I wrote down really doesn't matter. Trying to do this pro-bono is causing me more headache than I know what to do with. I wish I could find a pro-bono lawyer. To have it done now, I should have wrote emergency on the temporary orders, no one told me this, so how the hell would i know. Then they say you need to have a notice to set, which I have no clue what that is. But I got online thinking I would have access to it there, turns out there's like 50 different forms for notice to set. Noone can tell me which one is correct. I'm making myself sick over here trying to figure all this shit out. *sigh*
 
so enough about Bo, let's talk about Lori now. 
 
Brian can by law take back his last name, and she can't do anything about it. Well he tells her this, and she flips out, she wants to keep her name, cause it means something to her, so instead she decides she wants to hurt Brian, by making him pay more money. We got his divorce papers in the mail the other day, with him paying 1/2 for her lawyer, and 777 or so in child support. Now since he told her to take her maiden name back she's going to screw him even worse. SHe's requesting now that he pay for the WHOLE lawyer, plus the 777 or so in child support and 150 a week in daycare for the kids. Plus insurance. I called around last week and checked on lawyers in the Alabama area, found one somewhat cheap. He just needs to get things set up with the lawyer and see what they can do. 
 
My stomach is turning, burning, and I feel rather sick. I'm so tired of shit going wrong right now, it's not funny. I'm not sure what I did to deserve all of this, but it sucks. Karma is not my friend right now.

      I wrote this on one of the groups I'm on and thought it appropriate to post here. 
 
For the month of July Independence come to mind. That of the United
States and that of myself.
 
Tomorrow July 8th, I become a year older, a quarter of a century
old. In some eyes I'm still a baby, but being an old soul I feel
old. I was always the one who hung out with the older crowd, got
married young, had babies young.. Now here I am 25 and not 18 where
I thought I would be forever.
 +
This month I also set my court date for my divorce. I have been
married for 6 years, to a man I thought I loved, who loved drugs
more than I. We have been seperated for over a year, and I have
found a wonderful man who I would not trade for the world. I know
without going through the struggles I did in my marriage I would not
have found him, to that I am greatful. Tomorrow I go to the courts
to speak with the lawyers about my divorce and set a court date. A
wonderful birthday present to myself. This is a huge acomplishment
for me, 2 years ago I thought I would be in that rut forever.

      I'm not sure what kind of day I'm having but I know it's just a day! I started yesterday, which makes twice for me this month, but I guess I'm align with the moon now so that's kinda cool. 
 
I asked for the afternoon off today, sent my boss an email but never got a response, and its 10:51am so I'm assuming its a no. Which is fine, I just wanted to spend what time I had left with the kids. We went to Casa Bonita last night. Spent $50 on the worst mexican food ever imaginable. It wasn't about the food though, it was about the kids, and they had a blast. The arcade area sucked half the games were out of order, and there were about 600 people there, all waiting in line to play a game. Hot, sweaty, humid in there because there's the waterfall/divers that do their little bit. If you've ever seen the Casa Bonita South Park episode you will so know what this place is. And the episode is almost a spitting image of the place. So we went, and got home last night, put Daegan down and Seth and I sat up and watched Away from home or some crap with the talking animals that get seperated from their owners? Seth decided he wanted to call his dad at 10:30, I won't deny him calling his dad plus I know Bo and knew he'd be up, so I called him, got the vmail then called back again and he answered. Told him Seth wanted to talk to him and they talked for like 10 minutes then I asked to talk to him. I asked Bo that when he had Daegan that he take some updated pictures of he and her (a regular camera) so I could put them in frames for her in her bedroom. He said he sure could. He's been pretty decent latley, as have I. So I guess that's a good thing. He's looking forward to spending time with Daegan and I so understand why. 
 
Brian and I on the other hand seem to be having issues. He's stressed out about Lori, and her plans to shoot him down with the divorce. Which seem to be going well for her. I called around yesterday and checked some Alabama lawyers. Spoke to a few and got their opinions on what she was requesting and found some nice facts in favor of Brian. Lori wants him to pay $700 a month child support, PLUS $300 for daycare, PLUS 1/2 the lawyer ($2000) PLUS clothing allowance, and he's required to get the kids to and fro for visitation. Well talking with the lawyer, the daycare and clothing allowance ARE part of the child support so it seems maybe this is just her bitter bitch syndrome kicking in trying to get everything she can out of him. The lawyer also stated that he's not required to pay half her lawyer fee's, expecially if he's having to get his own lawyer. Also if in extreame circumstances that he lives x amt of miles away and has to fly etc to get the kids here (which means shelling out $800 a pop for tickets each time) they would lower the cost of the child support for a traveling allowance. So all these things look good in his favor, and the retainer fee as long as it doesn't go to court is $500. If it goes to court add another $1000. But if this shelling of cash keeps him from shelling more out than he should it will all be worth it. Yet he's got issues because I said something the other day about him letting her walk all over him. Which as you can read she's trying to do. I told him to quit being nice to her, and quit acting like they were still married. In rage one will say anything. So with all this I've got him coming back at me, where do I be nice, where do I be shitty.. I really don't know what to do or say with this, cause in all reality its not my issue, but it is, because it effects us. He's been less than happy this week and I see it all over. Short with words, short in general, snappy, pissy, yet I'm trying to be accomidating because I know how he feels and what she's doing to him, but I don't know where to stop being accomidating. Its in my nature to be, but then again its not. I don't want to get to the point where i start resenting, but I need to be able to voice my opinion. Or do I? Is it my right to say anything? Really no.. I don't know. I'm just kind of sitting here wondering what I should do and what I shouldn't do?? It's so hard. 
 
Then again I think, maybe he's annoyed with me, annoyed with my kids, annoyed with his situation?? Maybe he's thinking if he went back to her, all this would go away? I don't know. I'm unsure of what he's thinking but I know he's got alot on his mind, and I don't want to boggle him with my questions and concerns. Then again maybe I should cause if not it will contine to weigh on me and eventually becomes an issue. So I just sit here quiet, alone, and without confirmation from anyone or anything. Maybe tonight for the full moon, I'll sit and have a talk with the Goddess, maybe she has answers. Maybe Pixies tarot reading means something other than what we both thought. The fool could ultimatly be me, sitting alone, quiet, being neieve to the situations going on around me. 
 
I've got that god aweful ball in my throat when you just don't know what to do.. I hate that ball..

      When it it ever enough time allowed with your kids? 3 weeks I thought would be sufficiant enough time spent with Seth, well we are closing in on the last 2 days and every day this week I've gone to pick the kids up from daycare, I cry. 
 
I'm crying right now thinking this is the last time I'll get to see him for a long time, I'd say christmas. I'm not going to get to see him go to his first day of school. His first day of kindergarden.. I won't get to cry putting him on the bus or taking him to meet his teacher. This hurts so bad.. It makes me feel so sad. 
 
Seth commented the other day that he has a funner time with his dad cause he doesn't have to go to daycare. Which makes me feel so bad. I have to work, to support what i have, I can't just take 3 weeks off to spend with him. Although I would give anything to do that, financially I just can't. I have to play the adult parent, and reprimend him when he's bad, which is something I'm sure Bo doesn't do to the extent I do. Which also makes me feel like the worse parent, although I know in my heart I'm trying to do what's best for him and teach him some lessons. I just don't know. 
 
I'm hurting.. wondering what I am doing is right for the kids. I know in my heart it is, splitting them up is probably not the best thing, but this is what I'm working with. Making both parents happy. It sucks.

      I had the most enjoyable weekend I've had in a long time. All with friends, and family and fun!
 
That may have sounded dorky but really I don't care :D.
 
Friday night, Brian Daegan and I, went to Pixie and Dirks. Had a great dinner, that preceded to a nice small fire in her driveway, accompanied by smores and pudgy pies. (which were damn good) Pixie made one with peanut butter and some kind of unknown chocolate stuff, that was the shit. Mel and Chris came over also and we just sat around and had a wonderful time with friends and of course sugars.. LOL
 
Saturday we went to Estes. It was Bella's birthday. I worked all day with her. (for those of you who don't know my career change is working with Bella at her shop, which right now I'm doing on weekends only till I get laid off from here) Work was somewhat slow, or actually lack of buyers Saturday. I cracked myself up that day.. First someone calls and I answer the phone, they ask for Alisha Smith, or maybe they said Lisa Smith.. Well I know damn good and well Bella's name is Lisa Smith, but it just didn't click, (it was the flower shop calling to deliver flowers LMAO) so I told them no, there's no Alisha Smith here. Bella turns and looks at me and says hello Heather.. I'm lisa.. LMAO.. So she called them back and got her flowers delivered. LOL.
Not including Jo calls and asks for Lisa, in her beautiful accent, I reply in such a crap accent, yes please hold while I get lisa for you. Hand the phone to her (thinking it was someone playing games with lisa) there's a lady with an accent on the phone for you. I never even registered it would be Jo.. Then again I had never talked to her on the phone either so why would I know. LOL. So Bella got her happy birthdays from the Wolves group, and when she was done, I got to talk on the phone to. Jo has such a beautiful voice, although I could barely understand her, and I'm not sure if it was because she was excited or if she just naturally speaks that fast. It was awesome talking to her though. I also talked to BS Kate. She I could understand she spoke slowly and I don't think she was as excited as Jo.. I'm still laughing. I also got to talk to the southern Ms. Georgia. I had never heard her speak either and with her southern draw and the english accents I heard, I wondered how well conversation was going. LOL So with celebrating Bella's birthday I also got to speak to Jo, Kate and Georgia. I felt honored to be there with her.
 
Then Sunday we had the super Pagan come into the store. I say that with the utmost respect for the Pagan community, but this lady was loud, proud, and really scarrying off any of the customers that were in the store. She is just in utter amazement by Bella's store and the fact that we were both witches also. Her husband seemed "normal" compared to her, he was pagan also but wasn't loud, proud or in charge as I could tell. LOL She bought a caldrun pendant and a moon/pentacle pendant, she spent $45 so I had to atleast try to take her money right? But damn that woman was something else. I've never had so much fun working with people.
 
Bella is a wonderful woman, for anyone who reads this. She and her husband are the most kindest, caring people I've ever met. When I go to work with her on the weekends, she opens her home to Brian, Daegan and I. She offers to feed us, and shower us (which is a great thing since I have to work with the public again LOL) She's an awesome friend! A great boss..
I could go on and on.. really I could. I'm so blessed to have them in my life!!!!

      So today is Friday, yeah! Doesn't mean much for me as I am working another job on Saturday and Sunday's now, but I'm taking a little time to myself today and going to get my hair cut. Hopefully this lady knows what shes doing and will actually give me a cut I like. I'm tired of having bad cuts. But I guess that's what happens when you don't have a stylist. LOL
 
Yesterday I surfed the net most the day looking for Rennissance costumes to wear to Vegas, which I finally figured out how to search for "clothing"on ebay rather than damn dress patterns. So I have a bid on two outfits and hell if I get both groovy, I'd just like to get one. LOL
 
It's been so slow at work it's not bad, I would rather be at home though cleaning and working on the house than here, where I'm sitting serfing the net. Witchgrove is quiet more so latley cause Georgia is in the UK and all the UK'rs are hanging out with her.. Yeah I'm jealous. Eventually I'll go over there. One day.
 
Bo was pretty decent this week, he got to talk to Daegan like 3 times this week and called and let Seth talk to me whenever he wanted. He called like 5 times this week. Told me (seth) he bought me a ring, now lets see how long it takes his dad to send it. LOL
 
Other than that, hey I'm pretty normal for posts latley. LOL Nothing ugly or shitty.. Just normal life.. *now that I've jinxed myself* LOL

      First off, Yesterday!!!! Has made my day for the rest of my existence at this awful job. Two of the top sales men who bring in 90% of the business quit yesterday walking out hand in hand. In addition to taking the clients that bring the cash in for the asshole president. I smiled all day yesterday. I laughed inside and the idea that he's getting his just makes my day! Not including one tech quit last week, and 2 more are sure to follow. The sales men who left are also looking to take the tech's with them. Can I get a fuck you Sam? Woohooo.. I know it may not be right to find happiness in others demise, he did this to himself. He has no employee relationship with any of his employees and they just had enough of him.
 
Then I got a call from a recruiting company today wanting to know if I'd like a job as the Lead Telemarketing Call Center Supervisor. I would be responsible for bringing the call center up from the ground, (which isn't a problem) hiring, firing and annual evaluations. I was offered $40,000 a year, which is awesome, but they wanted me to start Monday. I have already promised the job that's laying me off that I would stay to train this lady, not including that I'm moving in December to Estes Park, I don't want to leave them hanging either with a half finished call center. And the idea of managing telemarketers just really isn't my idea of a good time. I would rather draw unemployment and wait. Is that wrong of me? What if it didn't work out there, and I quit, I wouldn't have anything to fall back on. The idea that I am secure with the unemployment made my choice easy. They found my resume on Hot Jobs.com which I never get a call from either Hot Jobs or Monster, so that made me feel good that yes people actually do look at the resumes on there. LOL
 
I made some carpet freshner and was sending it to my girlfriend as a house warming/blessing gift and one of the girls at work want to buy some from me. Which made me feel good, the shit smells good. :D Bellas going to buy some too. :D In my off time I want to be a productive little bee and get some product going for myself. I think I can do something with it and it's a great idea.

      I had a good weekend this weekend. I worked my butt off, well I tried, and learned, and sold and was the sale.. I had fun. Actually I had a blast. I think I so could see myself doing that as a life long thing, and its fun and worth it and yeah.. I just had a great time.
 
Saturday night we went to Rocky Mountain National Park and did ritual. Brian, Bella, Calab, Arron, Nica, Brian, Daegan and I. Our focus was on friendship and love and how what we all have together comes around kinda like the blue moon, RARE. Bella called the corners with her Angels, and suddenly this haze illuminated the sky. It was pretty cool. The moon was out and bright and beautiful. I felt such a connection that night with everyone that was there. It was nice to celebrate something with friends.
 
Daegan kept asking for Daddy and Seth, maybe she knew it was geared towards family but I started crying and yeah it sucked, but I told her that Daddy and Seth were in Oklahoma doing ritual together to honor with us.
 
I talked to Bo today who sent me an email yesterday wondering why I hadn't updated him on Daegan. I called atleast 10 times last week, left messages etc.. no response was made from him towards her or even for Seth. It somewhat pissed me off, so I left him a message this morning telling him that I was leaving a message not that he'd get it, and that I called numerous times last week for Daegan to talk to him and no answer. So if he would check his voice mails or emails once in a while he would know I was trying to get in touch with him for her. Go figure. We did have a good conversation today and it looks as if he's going to be moving to Missouri sometime in the next two months, which I just think is awesome for him. He needs to get away from that life and I hope this will be his big break. We shall see though.. :D
