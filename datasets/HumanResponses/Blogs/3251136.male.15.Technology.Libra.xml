       Friends   Dis is specially written for my friends...by da master...pls dun comment so much bout da language or watsoever lar..i'm not good at writing poetrys or watsoever..kay?n my eng suks too..  From the very first day, I was all alone, silently whispering to myself, without anyone ever noticing  Till the third day, you came to me, and as time passes, we became close friends  When it comes to sorrow, you didnt complain but stay, sharing the sorrow and disappointment, which not everyone will do  When it comes to joy, we had a great time, times all problems are forgotten, though it never last long  Together we spread the chain, the chain of friends, from one to four, from four to eight  It was perhaps the only, the only chain of friendship, which i really hope, it will last long  Time indeed flies like wind, throughout the short time, we had fun and joy, which will never be forgotten  However i am aware, all beginning has an end, and sooner or later, this chain will break  My thought was right, slowly one by one left, leaving this chain of friendship, never the same again  Till the very last end, the time i realise, that friendship was most important, it was already too late....  friendship is indeed very important..not one can live without frens...if u choose to let go friendship cox of sum stupid reasons...u'll regret 1 day..trust me..friends are realli realli important...thank you...

       Chain letters/mails/message   Theres sumthin i dun realli understand till now.Y ppl keep on sending chain letters or mails or messages or watsoeverv dat is related to passing on msgs to da others?Well..most of them often consists of nice poems,messages and pictures..but there is dis 1 stupid thing bout dis chain letters.  Most of those chain letters requires us to send to other ppl in a specific time in order to enjoy good luck and prevent bad luck..Wat is dis?if evry1 were to get good luk in love,life,business,frens,family,and watsoever after sending those chain letters,then wat for we work hard for it?den y dun we jux sit down n send da letters and wait for good luk to come to us?instead of working and thinking hard?Isnt dis ridiculous?  And most of the chain letters are indeed veri stupid.Some hav included examples of cases that will happen to u if u do not send it in da next 96 hours or watsoever.Most of them are bout the deaths of ppl who make dis a joke or do not send those letters.I wanna comment bout dis.I hav received many chain letters bout dis.I used to forward to sum of my frens cox i was once scared of da chain letters.  However,when i thought bout it,it was a foolish thing to do.If i were to receive 4 same chain letters which requires me to send to at least 20ppl,dat means i hav to send to 80ppl?The effect of chain letter will not finish.If u think u will die if u delete da letters..think again.If ppl were to die aftere deleting dis letters..den the number will exceeds thousand.futhermore life is god's will,ntg can determine when ur life will end.  So ppl who create chain letters,pls stop it.It is realli annoying esp to da master.N ppl who forward chain letters.PLS STOP SENDING IT TO ME COX I DUN LIKE STUPID CHAIN LETTERS.thank you.

       Ragnarok,anyone??   As i can see,the numbers of online games are increasing vastly in da past few months...most of them cant realli stay long..some indeed managed to expand wif great number of players on9..one good example is da ragnarok online game or better known as RO.  Ragnarok Online(RO) is da 1st malaysia on9 game..b4 dat it was redi inroduced in Taiwan and Korea..blah..wat m i introducing and advertising ro for?anyway,dis game is one of my favourite games to fulfill my past time esp when i got ntg to do or i m jux too bored,sitting at home during holidays.  Wat makes RO so interesting and players are so willing to pay to play dis game?hmm... i started playing dis game since last year..my fren introduced it to me...dat time it was free..so i thought its alrite to play durin weekends or watsoever..until i started playing,i guess i'm addicted to it..its actually a very fun game,though it was far away from reality..  This game offers characters of different professions wif da aim to lvl up from lvl 1 until da highest lvl 99,which is strongest among all..wif quite a wide range of professions to choose from: mage:to cast spells,swordman:to be da main attcker,acolyte:main supporter and so on....  Dis game also offers trading and buying good system using da ZENY currency,which is pure crap....so it actually teaches young players to learn to do business trough a merchant character..of cox sumtimes,stupid young inexperienced players got cheater by pro hackers and cheaters like me...heh..  Until they introduce da p2p or pay to play sytem...where players hav to start buying expensive reload cards to play dat game..it came accross sum ppl's mind to make money on9..how?ppl started sell zeny fer real $$$rm....1million zeny fer rm7...wat do u think of dis?absolutely crazy rite?real money fer false money!!anyway cant realli blame them...they're jux too stupid to think..  anyway..i m still playing ro until now...although i did stopped at da beginning of dis year, i took up da game again...so,any1 dat plays ro here can alwayz msg me...we go lvl up together n kill mvp ya?hahahaah....

       Childish   Sum ppl are just too childish in life..dis refers esp to da form 1 and 2s in my school.They act like small little boys of 5 to 10 years old n likes to play around.Well..i agree dat these boys and girls r still inmature n jux new to secondary life,but its just dat they do veri silly things and make sum stupid jokes which i realli dislike.  Eg:"U bully me i tell my mother 1 ar"."teacher!teacher!look at kelvin!he take my bottle!"."Wei..dunlar..i gonna tell teacher bout wat u did to me jux now"."U're not gonna catch me..bleahh"."donkey kelvin,stoplar..stoplar..plslar..plslar". Wat a joke.  Sum of them will jux cry over simple matters.Kids of dis age cant stand up for theirself.unlike those teenagers during my father's age.They have to work while studying n most of them at dat time redi know difficult is life.Well..nvm..lets get back to the main point.  Wat realli amuses me is dat sum of my frens still behave like da form 1 and 2s.Ok.Not to mention their name..but realli!Sumtimes i c them acting like form 1s n 2s..i will like jux close my eyes n walk away from them pretending i'm not their fren..haha..dats wat i do.But of course sumtimes i have to correct them as their master..wahahaha...wat to do..my frens will alwayz stay like dat..cant blame them also..:)  Well..but still compare to my year when i was form 1,i think we're more childish.Before da new building came up and those renovation thingy in progress,we used to play police and thief in front of da staffroom,running aorund da courtyard,the hall,bus bay also,shouting like fools..HONESTLY...when i thought bout it now..its realli realli embarrasing!!!!didnt thought dat all our actions were seen by all da teachers....n da principal..which was mr chong by dat time..now our principal is mr chew...he's strict n doesnt let ppl running n shouting round da courtyard..which i think probably da cause of y police n thief is no longer being played by da form 1s n 2s dis year?...  until i became a probate sumwhere in june in form 1 if i not mistaken..i stopped playing police n thief wif my frens...have to duty n other stuffs..thank god i actually stopped being veri childish at dat time...unlike sum of my frens who r still am until now...but thinking a few years back..my form 1 and 2 years are still da my best years..i miss playing wif my frens!!!!!!!..haha..now?form 4..u wan play?can..can...finish da whole book of exercises n papers 1st..  anyway..wat i m trying to say here is..stop being chidish..esp if u're in secondary level...cause its realli embarrasing to behave like small kids of da age of 7-12?This is written specially fer my frens which still behave like small kids....haha..u noe hu u r..heh..
