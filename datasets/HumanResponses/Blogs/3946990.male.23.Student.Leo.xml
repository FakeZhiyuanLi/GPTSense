       Most of us associate being criticised with being punished or told we're unwanted, & often it bears this implication, especially when parents criticise their children. Only by forcing ourselves to listen to criticism can we teach ourselves that it is sometimes well intended, &amp; that we won't fall to pieces no matter what other people say about us.   Be quiet while you are being criticised & make clear that you are listening.  Look directly at the person talking to you.                                                         Only in this way can you convey open reception to what he is saying. Whether you agree with it or not is an issue to be discussed later on.  Under no condition find fault in the person who has just critcised you.       If he's made a mistake in grammar, wait half an hour b4 telling him. It will probably not seem that important to you then.  DOn't criticise the other person's reaction to your behaviour; for instance, by calling him oversensitive. His reaction is not the point.  Don't caricature the complaint.  Don't change the subject.  Use your intelligence to help articulate the objection, not to obscure it.  Don't imply that your critic has some ulterior, hostile motive for making his objection.                                                                                                        If you are asking why the other person has objected to your act, you are not dealing with his objection. The question about him should come later, if ever.  Convey to the other person that you understand his objection.   Paraphrasing it is one good way of doing this. You are sayin in effect that you have recieved the message &amp; duly noted it.

      Many people elect never to complain because they mistakenly imagine that anyone who objects to behaviour is a troublemaker or a shrew. More often than not, these people have grown up under the domination of a haranguing parent, and they would now rather suffer nearly any abuse than risk resembling the parent. Still others withhold their complaints out of fear that their love is unrequited and that they are worthwhile to the other person only upon the condition that they act complaintly. They go on through life on tiptoes, suspecting that their mate is waiting for the opportune moment to tell them that ther relationship is over; these people stand ready to make immense sacrifices to maintain a harmonious atmosphere, on the theory that discord would give their mate the opportunity he's been waiting for.  Nearly all these people believe that they've already tried to voice objections plainly, & have come to the sad conclusion that they weren't listened to. In some cases, the person's expression of dissatisfaction were vague; in others he has loaded his arguments with so many irrelevant & disagreeable comments that few would have listened to him patiently.  In an intimate relationship, when someone suffers as a result of another person's behaviour, the sufferer nearly always knows better than the other person which actions are causing him difficulty. If he doesn't make his objection, he predisposes himself to think the worst, that the other person knew he was inflicting pain, wanted to inflict it, &amp; would have disregarded his pleas for better treatment if he had made such pleas. By deciding against voicing objections, we convince ourselves that other people are acting with rancor. By our silence, we imprint in our own minds the belief that objecting to the other person's behaviour would be pointless, & yet we would all be distressed if a loved one reached that conclusion about us, especially if we felt we had not been given a fair trial. It's an obligation of any friend to give us the chance to stop hurting him by telling us how we are douing so.  Complaining is an art &amp; a responsibility, & like any art, it takes practice, &amp; following new principles may feel unnatural at first. You may consider it a worthy plan to follow all the ground rules to be presented, in all your relationships. Making them hanitual may help avoid many kinds of confusion.    Complain to the person you think is harming you, and not to anyone else.  Try not to object to your mate's behaviour infront of anyone else.               To most people, being criticised feels like being personally attacked.  Don't compare the person's behaviour with that of other people.               Tell a girl that your former wife wouldn't have kept you waiting so long , & you're almost sure to start a fight. No one wants to be described as inferior to someone else. Comparisons of this kind are always irrelevant. Our standards of our own performances must not be based on what other people do, but on what we believe we can do. Also beware of implied comparisons, like those conveyed by expressing disappointment with someone. The disappointing person is being compared with his better self.  Make your complaint as soon as you can i.e as soon as you are alone with the other person &amp; can articulate it.                                                        Speaking up, like any task, becomes more difficult when you postpone it. If yozu criticise someone for what he did long ago, you will look like a brooder.  Don't repeat a point once you've made it & the other person has carefully considered it.                                                                                                  This means, don't expect a signed confession after you've spoken.  Object only to actions that the other person can change.                           You may ask a person not to shout, but if you ask him not to be angry with you, you are probably asking too much.  Make your complaints vocally, not facially.                                               Facial expressions of all kinds are outward complements of the spirit. Our expressions may be rich & various, but they cease to be when we use them as devices to convey messages we are reluctant to put into words.  Try to make only one complaint at a time.                                                      If you make more, you'll demoralize the other person, & perhaps obscure your major point. Don't quibble about the carpeting in your office when you've stormed in to ask your boss for a well-deserved promotion. If the subject changes to the price of carpets, you'll feel unsatisfied; & your boss may feel he's discharged his obligation by promising to have your carpet changed.  Don't preface your complaint.                                                                "Listen. There's something I've wanted to tell you for a long time. It may hurt you badly, but please don't feel offended by what I'm going to say... "  Don't apologize for your complaint after making it.  Avoid sarcasm.                                                                                                Among the invariable motivations of sarcasm are contempt & fear. Your contempt will predispose the other person not to heed you, &amp; because you are making a choice not to confront him directly, you are intensifying your fear of him.  DOn't ask people why they are doing something to which you object. Ask them to stop if that is the underlying idea you wish to express.                  "Why are you interrupting me?" "Why are you putting your feet on my chair?" It's obvious in each case that the speaker wants the other person to stop an activity. Probably, he doesn't feel strong enough to make the request openly, so he cloaks it as a scientific-inquiry.  Rehearse your presentation if you need to.  Don't talk about other people's motivations when objecting to an activity. Tell them simply what they are doing, & if it is relevant, why you feel they ought not to do it. Here are examples of statements that are objectionable because they conclude irrelevant speculations about the motive of the offender: "You never want me to finish what I'm saying." "Quit trying to make me angry." Each of the statements run an unneccesary risk. It gives the listener reason to disregard your essential complaint if he concludes that your speculation about his motive is wrong. Look out for the tendency to confuse consequence &amp; intention. The fact that someone is stepping on your foot doesn't logically imply that his intention was to hurt you.  Avoid words like "always" & "never"; they contain implicit references to the past.  If you never compliment the other person, don't expect him to remain open to your criticisms.                                                                                   Complaints ring loud &amp; long when they are the only sounds that are made.

      There is a kind of rehearsal with&nbsp;special value for us,&nbsp;which we may call negative rehearsal. Instead of brooding about whether someone you met will continue to like you after spending a day with you, ask yourself, How am I liable to offend that person? Be specific. If you discover a fear of embarrasing that other person by acting immaturely, ask yourself by what actions you may do this. List them. The clearer your picture of how you may do damage, the better prepared you will be against doing it. Many of us exist with the vague&nbsp;feeling that we are undesirable, but few of us ask ourselves precisely how do we make ourselves undesirable? By asking such questions, we would, in effect, be rehearsing what not to do,&nbsp;a process sometimes even more valuable than rehearsing what we want to do.

      A diffuse group of people often called ``hackers'' has been characterized as unethical, irresponsible, and a serious danger to society for actions related to breaking into computer systems. This paper attempts to construct a picture of hackers, their concerns, and the discourse in which hacking takes place. Initial findings suggest that hackers are learners and explorers who want to help rather than cause damage, and who often have very high standards of behavior. Findings also suggest that the discourse surrounding hacking belongs at the very least to the gray areas between larger conflicts that we are experiencing at every level of society and business in an information age where many are not computer literate. These conflicts are between the idea that information cannot be owned and the idea that it can, and between law enforcement and the First and Fourth Amendments. Hackers have raised serious issues about values and practices in an information society. Based on&nbsp;these&nbsp;findings, it is recommend that we work closely with hackers, and suggest several actions that might be taken.  &nbsp;Introduction The world is crisscrossed with many different networks that are used to deliver essential services and basic necessities -- electric power, water, fuel, food, goods, to name a few. These networks are all publicly accessible and hence vulnerable to attacks, and yet virtually no attacks or disruptions actually occur.  The world of computer networking seems to be an anomaly in the firmament of networks. Stories about attacks, breakins, disruptions, theft of information, modification of files, and the like appear frequently in the newspapers. A diffuse group called ``hackers'' is often the target of scorn and blame for these actions. Why are computer networks any different from other vulnerable public networks? Is the difference the result of growing pains in a young field? Or is it the reflection of deeper tensions in our emerging information society?  The word ``hacker'' has taken on many different meanings ranging from 1) ``a person who enjoys learning the details of computer systems and how to stretch their capabilities'' to 2) ``a malicious or inquisitive meddler who tries to discover information by poking around .. possibly by deceptive or illegal means ...''  ``A hacker is someone that experiments with systems... [Hacking] is playing with systems and making them do what they were never intended to do. Breaking in and making free calls is just a small part of that. Hacking is also about freedom of speech and free access to information -- being able to find out anything. There is also the David and Goliath side of it, the underdog vs. the system, and the ethic of being a folk hero, albeit a minor one.''  Stallman is a leading advocate of open systems and freedom of information, especially software. He said: ``I believe that all generally useful information should be free. By `free' I am not referring to price, but rather to the freedom to copy the information and to adapt it to one's own uses.'' By ``generally useful'' he does not include confidential information about individuals or credit card information, for example. He further writes: ``When information is generally useful, redistributing it makes humanity wealthier no matter who is distributing and no matter who is receiving.'' Stallman has argued strongly against user interface copyright, claiming that it does not serve the users or promote the evolutionary process.  &nbsp;One hacker wrote ``A hacker sees a security hole and takes advantage of it because it is there, not to destroy information or steal. I think our activities would be analogous to someone discovering methods of acquiring information in a library and becoming excited and perhaps engrossed.''  An interesting analogy between teaching computing and teaching karate is;&nbsp;in karate instruction, students are introduced to the real, adult community. They are given access to a powerful, deadly weapon, and at the same time are taught discipline and to not abuse the art. The reason that students do not misuse their power is that they know they are being trusted with something important, and they want to live up to that trust.   Thrill, Excitement, and Challenge One hacker wrote that ``Hackers understand something basic about computers, and that is that they can be enjoyed. I know none who hack for money, or hack to frighten the company, or hack for anything but fun.''  Ethics and Avoiding Damage Computer security professionals often disagree with hackers about what constitutes damage. Where the hackers' ethics differs from the standards adopted by most in the computer security community is that hackers say it is not unethical to break into many systems, use idle computer and communications resources, and download system files in order to learn. Goldstein says that hacking is not wrong: it is not the same as stealing, and uncovers design flaws and security deficiencies.  But we must not overlook that the differences in ethics also reflect a difference in philosophy about information and information handling resources; whereas hackers advocate sharing, we seem to be advocating ownership as property. The differences also represent an opportunity to examine our own ethical behavior and our practices for information sharing and protection. For example, one hacker wrote ``I will accept that it is morally wrong to copy some proprietary software, however, I think that it is morally wrong to charge $6000 for a program that is only around 25K long.'' Hence, we shall go into a few of the ethical points raised by hackers more closely. It is not a simple case of good or mature (computer security professionals) against bad or immature (hackers), or of teaching hackers a list of rules.  Many computer professionals argue the moral questions of what is good or bad by analogy. The analogies are then used to justify their judgement of a hacker's actions as unethical. Breaking into a system is compared with breaking into a house, and downloading information and using computer and telecommunications services is compared with stealing tangible goods. But, say hackers, the situations are not the same. When someone breaks into a house, the objective is to steal goods, which are often irreplaceable, and property is often damaged in the process. By contrast, when a hacker breaks into a system, the objective is to learn and avoid causing damage. Downloaded information is copied, not stolen, and still exists on the original system. Moreover, as noted earlier, information has not been traditionally regarded as property. Dibbel says that when the software industries and phone companies claim losses of billions of dollars to piracy, they are not talking about goods that disappear from the shelves and could have been sold.  We often say that breaking into a system implies a lack of caring for the system's owner and authorized users. But, one hacker says that the ease of breaking into a system reveals a lack of caring on the part of the system manager to protect user and company assets, or failure on the part of vendors to warn managers about the vulnerabilities of their systems. He estimated his success rate of getting in at 10-15%, and that is without spending more than an hour on any one target system. Another hacker says that he sees messages from vendors notifying the managers, but that the managers fail to take action.  Richard Pethia of CERT (Computer Emergency Response Team) reports that they seldom see cases of malicious damage caused by hackers, but that the break-ins are nevertheless disruptive because system users and administrators want to be sure that nothing was damaged. (CERT suggests that sites reload system software from secure backups and change all user passwords in order to protect against possible back doors and Trojan Horses that might have been planted by the hacker. Pethia also noted that prosecutors are generally called for government sites, and are being called for non-government sites with increasing frequency.) Pethia says that break-ins also generate a loss of trust in the computing environment, and may lead to adoption of new policies that are formulated in a panic or management edicts that severely restrict connectivity to outside systems. Brian Harvey says that hackers cause damage by increasing the amount of paranoia, which in turn leads to tighter security controls that diminish the quality of life for the users. Hackers respond to these points by saying they are the scapegoats for systems that are not adequately protected. They say that the paranoia is generated by ill-founded fears and media distortions (I will return to this point later), and that security need not be oppressive to keep hackers out; it is mainly making sure that passwords and system defaults are well-chosen.  Pethia says that some intruders seem to be disruptive to prove a point, such as that the systems are vulnerable, the security personnel are incompetent, or ``it's not nice to say bad things about hackers.'' In the N.Y. Times, John Markoff wrote that the hacker who claimed to have broken into Cliff Stoll's system said he was upset by Stoll's portrayal of hackers in ``The Cuckoo's Egg''. Markoff reported that the caller said: ``He [Stoll] was going on about how he hates all hackers, and he gave pretty much of a one-sided view of who hackers are.''  ``The Cuckoo's Egg'' captures much of the popular stereotypes of hackers. Criminologist Jim Thomas criticizes it for presenting a simplified view of the world, one where everything springs from the forces of light (us) or of darkness (hackers) . He claims that Stoll fails to see the similarities between his own activities (e.g., monitoring communications, ``borrowing'' monitors without authorization, shutting off network access without warning, and lying to get information he wants) and those of hackers. He points out Stoll's use of pejorative words such as ``varmint'' to describe hackers, and Stoll's quote of a colleague: ``They're technically skilled but ethically bankrupt programmers without any respect for others' work -- or privacy. They're not destroying one or two programs. They're trying to wreck the cooperation that builds our networks.''&nbsp; Thomas writes ``at an intellectual level, [Stoll] provides a persuasive, but simplistic, moral imagery of the nature of right and wrong, and provides what -- to a lay reader -- would seem a compelling justification for more statutes and severe penalties against the computer underground. This is troublesome for two reasons. First, it leads to a mentality of social control by law enforcement during a social phase when some would argue we are already over-controlled. Second, it invokes a punishment model that assumes we can stamp out behaviors to which we object if only we apprehend and convict a sufficient number of violators. ... There is little evidence that punishment will in the long run reduce any given offense, and the research of Gordon Meyer and I suggests that criminalization may, in fact, contribute to the growth of the computer underground.''  &nbsp;Public Image and Treatment Hackers express concern about their negative public image and identity. As noted earlier, hackers are often portrayed as being irresponsible and immoral. One hacker said that ``government propaganda is spreading an image of our being at best, sub-human, depraved, criminally inclined, morally corrupt, low life. We need to prove that the activities that we are accused of (crashing systems, interfering with life support equipment, robbing banks, and jamming 911 lines) are as morally abhorent to us as they are to the general public.'' The public identity of an individual or group is generated in part by the actions of the group interacting with the standards of the community observing those actions. What then accounts for the difference between the hacker's public image and what they say about themselves? One explanation may be the different standards. Outside the hacking community, the simple act of breaking into systems is regarded as unethical by many. The use of pejorative words like ``vandal'' and ``varmint'' reflect this discrepency in ethics. Even the word ``criminal'' carries with it connotations of someone evil; hackers say they are not criminal in this sense. Katie Hafner notes that Robert Morris, who was convicted of launching the Internet worm, was likened to a terrorist even though the worm did not destroy data.  Hackers say they want to help system managers make their systems more secure. They would like managers to recognize and use their knowledge about design flaws and the outsider threat problem.  Drake suggests giving hackers free access in exchange for helping with security, a suggestion that I also heard from several hackers. Drake says that the current attitude of treating hackers as enemies is not very conducive to a solution, and by belittling them, we only cause ourselves problems. I asked some of the hackers whether they'd be interested in breaking into systems if the rules of the ``game'' were changed so that instead of being threatened by prosecution, they were invited to leave a ``calling card'' giving their name, phone number, and method of breaking in. In exchange, they would get recognition and points for each vulnerability they discovered. Most were interested in playing; one hacker said he would prefer monetary reward since he was supporting himself. Any system manager interested in trying this out could post a welcome message inviting hackers to leave their cards. This approach could have the advantage of not only letting the hackers contribute to the security of the system, but of allowing the managers to quickly recognize the potentially malicious hackers, since they are unlikely to leave their cards. Perhaps if hackers are given the opportunity to make contributions outside the underground, this will dampen their desire to pursue illegal activities.  &nbsp;Conclusions Hackers say that it is our social responsibility to share information, and that it is information hoarding and disinformation that are the crimes. This ethic of resource and information sharing contrasts sharply with computer security policies that are based on authorization and ``need to know.'' This discrepancy raises an interesting question: Does the hacker ethic reflects a growing force in society that stands for greater sharing of resources and information -- a reaffirmation of basic values in our constitution and laws? It is important that we examine the differences between the standards of hackers, systems managers, users, and the public. These differences may represent breakdowns in current practices, and may present new opportunities to design better policies and mechanisms for making computer resources and information more widely available   &nbsp;Information flow and sharing is fundamental to innovation and competetiveness   T he sentiment is not&nbsp;restricted to people outside the computer security field. Our natural urge is to share information, and we are suspicious of organizations and individuals who are secretive. Information is exchanged out of ``want to know'' and mutual accommodation rather than ``need to know.'' If this is so, then some of our security policies are out of step with the way people work. Peter Denning says that information sharing will be widespread in the emerging worldwide networks of computers and that we need to focus on ``immune systems'' that protect against mistakes in our designs and recover from damage.

      &nbsp; Is it man's nature to be able to love only what he cannot fully&nbsp;posses? Some writers have said yes, that pure love, unquestioning & unfailing, depends for its sustenance on our finding our loved one imperfectly accessible to us, and is therefore impossible in marriage, where the mate is already possessed. Like many philosophical arguments, the issue is to a large extent psychological. When the philosopher finishes defining love(&amp;, undoubtedly, to do so, he must accord to the term its spectrum of diverse meanings), we are left with the fact that some people seem to love their mates forever, unquestioningly, & that others find it impossible to love or respect those who become accessible.  &nbsp; The illness has no name, though it is widely recognized. Its victims are doomed to yearn for the woman who rejected them -- as they yearn for the item they couldn't afford, while they underestimate the value of what they can afford. No matter how much they acquire, they feel unrewarded. Their experience is that whatever they most esteem & try hardest to attain declines in value from the moment they secure it.  &nbsp; Some of these people describe themselves as "loving the chase"; however, this is merely a retrospect attempt to account for their discovery. As soon as such a person becomes assured that he is wanted & needed, the interaction shifts from courtship by him to courtship&nbsp;of him by the other person. The more&nbsp;the other person assures him of devotion, the faster he falls out of love.  &nbsp; Victims of the illness&nbsp;do not always propound the philosophy described earlier. Like&nbsp;nearly all the rest of us, they assert that we ought to&nbsp;esteem people&nbsp;& things for their intrinsic value &amp; not their market value. Intrinsic value does not increase with scarcity & decrease when the object is readily available. Market value reflects scarcity; & thus the&nbsp;problem I'm talking about is that of being&nbsp;unable to love and appreciate&nbsp;people & things&nbsp;for their intrinsic value.  &nbsp; The phenomenon is observable in&nbsp;everyday contacts, where our feelings are not as intense as in love relationships. If the person afflicted with the attitude has&nbsp;known us for years&nbsp;& watched us learning our profession, or making the&nbsp;transition from childhood to adulthood, he may forever refuse to acknowledge that we have become capable. As an employer, he finds it hard to acknowledge when his underlings have, through experience, qualified themselves to handle better jobs in his organization. In some fields, it is common practice for workers to shift from one organization to another every few years, since employers&nbsp;refuse to give appropriate resposibilities&nbsp;& salaries to people who have developed their skills within the organization. The philosophy seems to be: If you're familiar&nbsp;& especially if you've needed me, then I cannot respect your skills.  &nbsp; Parents who suffer from this disease may refuse to concede their children's maturity, simply because&nbsp;they remember the days when the kids were helpless & dependent on them. It's a sad&nbsp;truth&nbsp;about many parents &nbsp;that their children would do better performing for someone elses parents.  &nbsp; How far does the prejudice against the familiar influence you? Do you regularly treat dinner guests better than the people who live with you? Are you regularly late for appointments made with intimates, & seldom late for those made with strangers? Do you fawn infront of professional men &amp; excuse them after they've kept you waiting for hours, &, in contrast, complain when someone you know keeps you waiting even a few minutes? If so, like millions, you are assuming, without considering the matter, that the time of people you don't know is more important than that of people you do, and your discriminatory treatment is renewing that assumption.  &nbsp;&nbsp; The belief that others will esteem us in proportion to our inaccessibility motivates a variety of tactics--all bad, since either they fail immediately, or they succeed but have harmful repercussions. Instilling jealousy in people is one such tactics. What the other&nbsp;person does while jealous may, as you expect, intensify his desire for you.&nbsp;However, if his&nbsp;motivation for courting you isn't affection but fear of losing you, when you put aside your tactic, it's predictable that his attentions will come to a halt. Because fear was at the heart of his trying to win you back, you can expect resentment once you have gone back. Since making people jealous is, in the end, little more than instilling fear in them, we may expect the advantages of the tactic to be short-lived.&nbsp;In addition, whenever we conciously use a tactic in a relationship, we renew our belief that the tactic is needed to keep the relationship alive; &amp; thus the use of tactics, whatever they are, robs us of intimacey with people...

      All we are in a position to appreciate when merely viewing an object is its image on our retina. Indeed, were we to place a microscope or deforming lense between an object &amp; our eyes, the object will suffer no change, but it's image cast on our retina would, of course be modified. As a result, our judgement of it's shape and size would vary. Hence when we decide unhesitatingly that a coin is round, the only inference to be drawn is that the coin's image on our retina is judged by our brain to be circular.

      Our story begins at the Olympics, specifically the wrestling event. It is narrowed down to the Russian or the American for the gold medal. Before the final match, the American wrestler's trainer comes to him and says, "Now don't forget all the research we've done on this Russian. He's never lost a match because of this "pretzel" hold he has. Whatever you do, don't let him get you in this hold! If he does, you're finished!" The wrestler nods in agreement. Now, to the match: The American and the Russian circle each other several times looking for an opening. All of a sudden the Russian lunges forward, grabbing the American and wrapping him up in the dreaded pretzel hold. A sigh of disappointment goes up from the crowd, and the trainer buries his face in his hands for he knows all is lost. He can't watch the ending. Suddenly there's a scream, a cheer from the crowd, and the trainer raises his eye just in time to see the Russian flying up in the air. The Russian's back hits the mat with a thud, and the American weakly collapses on top of him, getting the pin and winning the match. The trainer is astounded! When he finally gets the American wrestler alone, he asks, "How did you ever get out of that hold? No one has ever done it before!" The wrestler answers, "Well, I was ready to give up when he got me in that hold, but at the last moment, I opened my eyes and saw this pair of balls right in front of my face. I thought I had nothing to lose, so with my last ounce of strength I stretched out my neck and bit those babies just as hard as I could. You'd be amazed how strong you get when you bite your own balls!"

      GHOST POOPIE: The kind where you feel the poopie come out, but there's no poopie in the toilet.  CLEAN POOPIE: The kind where you poopie it out, see it in the toilet, but there is nothing on the toilet paper.  WET POOPIE: The kind where you wipe your butt 50 times and it still feels unwiped, so you have to put some toilet paper between your butt and your underwear so you won't ruin them with stains.  SECOND WAVE POOPIE: This happens when you're done poopie-ing and you've pulled your pants up to your knees, and you realize that you have to poopie some more.  POP-A VEIN-IN-YOUR-FOREHEAD POOPIE: The kind where you strain so much to get it out, you practically have a stroke.  LINCOLN LOG POOPIE: The kind of poopie that is so huge you're afraid to flush without first breaking it into little pieces with the toilet brush.  GASSY POOPIE: It's so noisy, that everyone within earshot is giggling.  DRINKER'S POOPIE: The kind of poopie you have the morning after a long night of drinking. It's most noticeable trait are the skid marks on the bottom of the toilet.  CORN POOPIE: Self explanatory.  GEE-I-WISH-I-COULD-POOPIE POOPIE: The kind where you want to poopie but all you do is sit on the toilet and fart a few times.  SPINAL TAP POOPIE: That's where it hurts so badly coming out, you'd swear it was leaving you sideways.  WET CHEEKS POOPIE (The Power Dump): The kind that comes out so fast, your butt cheeks get splashed with water.  THE DANGLING POOPIE: This poopie refuses to drop in the toilet even though you are done poopie-ing it. You just hope that a shake or two will cut it loose.  THE SURPRISE POOPIE: You're not even at the toilet because you are sure you are about to fart, but *oops* --- a poopie!

      &nbsp;1. People who point at their wrist while asking for the time.... I  know where my watch is pal, where the fuck is yours? Do I point at my  crotch when I ask where the toilet is?&nbsp; 2. People who are willing to get off their arse to search the entire  room for the tv remote because they refuse to walk to the tv and  change the channel manually.  3. When people say "Oh you just want to have your cake and eat  it too". Fucking right! What good is a cake if you can't eat it?  4. When people say "it's always the last place you look".  Of course it is. Why the fuck would you keep looking after you've  found it? Do people do this? Who and where are they  5. When people say while watching a film "did you see  that?". No tosser, I paid $8 to come to the cinema and stare at  the fucking floor.  6. People who ask "Can I ask you a question?". Didn't  really give me a choice there, did you sunshine?  7. When something is 'new and improved!'. Which is it? If it's new,  then there has never been anything before it. If it's an improvement,  then there must have been something before it.  8. When people say "life is short". What the fuck?? Life is  the longest damn thing anyone ever fucking does!! What can you do  that's longer?  9. When you are waiting for the bus and someone asks "Has the  bus come yet?".... If the bus came would I be standing here,  nobhead?&nbsp; &nbsp;

      When his 38-caliber revolver failed to fire at its intended victimduring a holdup in Long Beach, California, would be robber James Elliot didsomething that can only inspire wonder: He peered down the barrel and triedthe trigger again. This time it worked. &nbsp; A five year old and a four year old are upstairs in their bedroom. "You know what?" says the five year old, "I think it's about time we start swearing." The four year old nods his head in approval. The 5 year old continues, "When we go downstairs for breakfast I'm gonna say "hell," and you say "ass," okay?" The four year old agrees with enthusiasm. The mother walks into the kitchen and asks the five year old what he wants for breakfast. "Aw hell Mom, I guess I'll have some Cheerios."…..WHACK! He flies out of his chair, tumbles across the kitchen floor, gets up, and runs upstairs bawling. The mom looks at the four year old and asks with a stern voice, "And what do YOU want for breakfast, young man?" "I'm not sure," he says, "but you can bet your ass it won't be Cheerios &nbsp; Three Italian nuns die and go to heaven, where they are met at the Pearly Gates by St. Peter. He says "Ladies, you all led such wonderful lives, that I'm granting you six months to go back to earth and be anyone you want to be." The first nun says, "I want to be Sophia Loren;" and *poof* she's gone.The second says, "I want to be Madonna;" and *poof* she's gone. The third says, "I want to be Sara Pipalini." St. Peter looks perplexed. "Who?" he asks. "Sara Pipalini;" replies the nun. St. Peter shakes his head and says; "I'm sorry, but that name just doesn't ring a bell." The nun then takes a newspaper out of her habit and hands it to St. Peter. He reads the paper and starts laughing. He hands it back to her and says.... "No sister, this says 'Sahara Pipeline' was laid by 1,900 men in 6 months."

      I have a Dream by Martin Luther King, Jr; August 28, 1963  .  Delivered on the steps at the Lincoln Memorial in Washington D.C. on August 28, 1963  Five score years ago, a great American, in whose symbolic shadow we stand signed the Emancipation Proclamation. This momentous decree came as a great beacon light of hope to millions of Negro slaves who had been seared in the flames of withering injustice. It came as a joyous daybreak to end the long night of captivity.  But one hundred years later, we must face the tragic fact that the Negro is still not free. One hundred years later, the life of the Negro is still sadly crippled by the manacles of segregation and the chains of discrimination. One hundred years later, the Negro lives on a lonely island of poverty in the midst of a vast ocean of material prosperity. One hundred years later, the Negro is still languishing in the corners of American society and finds himself an exile in his own land. So we have come here today to dramatize an appalling condition.  In a sense we have come to our nation's capital to cash a check. When the architects of our republic wrote the magnificent words of the Constitution and the declaration of Independence, they were signing a promissory note to which every American was to fall heir. This note was a promise that all men would be guaranteed the inalienable rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.  It is obvious today that America has defaulted on this promissory note insofar as her citizens of color are concerned. Instead of honoring this sacred obligation, America has given the Negro people a bad check which has come back marked "insufficient funds." But we refuse to believe that the bank of justice is bankrupt. We refuse to believe that there are insufficient funds in the great vaults of opportunity of this nation. So we have come to cash this check -- a check that will give us upon demand the riches of freedom and the security of justice. We have also come to this hallowed spot to remind America of the fierce urgency of now. This is no time to engage in the luxury of cooling off or to take the tranquilizing drug of gradualism. Now is the time to rise from the dark and desolate valley of segregation to the sunlit path of racial justice. Now is the time to open the doors of opportunity to all of God's children. Now is the time to lift our nation from the quicksands of racial injustice to the solid rock of brotherhood.  It would be fatal for the nation to overlook the urgency of the moment and to underestimate the determination of the Negro. This sweltering summer of the Negro's legitimate discontent will not pass until there is an invigorating autumn of freedom and equality. Nineteen sixty-three is not an end, but a beginning. Those who hope that the Negro needed to blow off steam and will now be content will have a rude awakening if the nation returns to business as usual. There will be neither rest nor tranquility in America until the Negro is granted his citizenship rights. The whirlwinds of revolt will continue to shake the foundations of our nation until the bright day of justice emerges.  But there is something that I must say to my people who stand on the warm threshold which leads into the palace of justice. In the process of gaining our rightful place we must not be guilty of wrongful deeds. Let us not seek to satisfy our thirst for freedom by drinking from the cup of bitterness and hatred.  We must forever conduct our struggle on the high plane of dignity and discipline. We must not allow our creative protest to degenerate into physical violence. Again and again we must rise to the majestic heights of meeting physical force with soul force. The marvelous new militancy which has engulfed the Negro community must not lead us to distrust of all white people, for many of our white brothers, as evidenced by their presence here today, have come to realize that their destiny is tied up with our destiny and their freedom is inextricably bound to our freedom. We cannot walk alone.  And as we walk, we must make the pledge that we shall march ahead. We cannot turn back. There are those who are asking the devotees of civil rights, "When will you be satisfied?" We can never be satisfied as long as our bodies, heavy with the fatigue of travel, cannot gain lodging in the motels of the highways and the hotels of the cities. We cannot be satisfied as long as the Negro's basic mobility is from a smaller ghetto to a larger one. We can never be satisfied as long as a Negro in Mississippi cannot vote and a Negro in New York believes he has nothing for which to vote. No, no, we are not satisfied, and we will not be satisfied until justice rolls down like waters and righteousness like a mighty stream.  I am not unmindful that some of you have come here out of great trials and tribulations. Some of you have come fresh from narrow cells. Some of you have come from areas where your quest for freedom left you battered by the storms of persecution and staggered by the winds of police brutality. You have been the veterans of creative suffering. Continue to work with the faith that unearned suffering is redemptive.  Go back to Mississippi, go back to Alabama, go back to Georgia, go back to Louisiana, go back to the slums and ghettos of our northern cities, knowing that somehow this situation can and will be changed. Let us not wallow in the valley of despair.  I say to you today, my friends, that in spite of the difficulties and frustrations of the moment, I still have a dream. It is a dream deeply rooted in the American dream.  I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed: "We hold these truths to be self-evident: that all men are created equal."  I have a dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia the sons of former slaves and the sons of former slaveowners will be able to sit down together at a table of brotherhood.  I have a dream that one day even the state of Mississippi, a desert state, sweltering with the heat of injustice and oppression, will be transformed into an oasis of freedom and justice.  I have a dream that my four children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.  I have a dream today.  I have a dream that one day the state of Alabama, whose governor's lips are presently dripping with the words of interposition and nullification, will be transformed into a situation where little black boys and black girls will be able to join hands with little white boys and white girls and walk together as sisters and brothers.  I have a dream today.  I have a dream that one day every valley shall be exalted, every hill and mountain shall be made low, the rough places will be made plain, and the crooked places will be made straight, and the glory of the Lord shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see it together.  This is our hope. This is the faith with which I return to the South. With this faith we will be able to hew out of the mountain of despair a stone of hope. With this faith we will be able to transform the jangling discords of our nation into a beautiful symphony of brotherhood. With this faith we will be able to work together, to pray together, to struggle together, to go to jail together, to stand up for freedom together, knowing that we will be free one day.  This will be the day when all of God's children will be able to sing with a new meaning, "My country, 'tis of thee, sweet land of liberty, of thee I sing. Land where my fathers died, land of the pilgrim's pride, from every mountainside, let freedom ring."  And if America is to be a great nation this must become true. So let freedom ring from the prodigious hilltops of New Hampshire. Let freedom ring from the mighty mountains of New York. Let freedom ring from the heightening Alleghenies of Pennsylvania!  Let freedom ring from the snowcapped Rockies of Colorado!  Let freedom ring from the curvaceous peaks of California!  But not only that; let freedom ring from Stone Mountain of Georgia!  Let freedom ring from Lookout Mountain of Tennessee!  Let freedom ring from every hill and every molehill of Mississippi. From every mountainside, let freedom ring.  When we let freedom ring, when we let it ring from every village and every hamlet, from every state and every city, we will be able to speed up that day when all of God's children, black men and white men, Jews and Gentiles, Protestants and Catholics, will be able to join hands and sing in the words of the old Negro spiritual, "Free at last! free at last! thank God Almighty, we are free at last!"

      Our emotions, they say, guide us in facing predicaments &amp; tasks 2 important 2 leave 2 intellect alone__ danger, painful loss, persistin 2wards a goal despite frustrations, bondin with a mate, buildin a family. Each emotion offers a distinctive readiness 2 act; each points us in a direction that has worked well 2 handle the recurrin challenges of human life.As these eternal situations where repeated &amp; repeated over our evolutionary history, the survival of our emotional repetoire was attested 2 by it's becoming imprinted in our nerves, as innate automatic tendencies of our human heart. &nbsp; 4 a long &amp; crucial period in human prehistory, fear had been a very essential emotion which made the difference between survival &amp; death &amp; mattered 4 the main task of evolution. The 1st laws of ethics(the 10 commandments, etc) can b read as attempts 2 harness, subdue &amp; domesticate emotional life. &nbsp; All emotions r, in essence, impulses 2 act, the instant plans 4 handling life that evolution has instilled in us. &nbsp; In a very real sense, we have 2 minds... 1 that thinks &amp; 1 that feels &amp; these 2 interact 2 form our mental life. This is what the folks so commonly call "Head" &amp; "Heart." &nbsp; Life is a comedy 4 those who think, &amp; a tragedy 4 those who feel. &nbsp; U don't need 2 know fully what something is 2 know that it is dangerous. &nbsp; Feelings r typically insdispensable 4 rational decisions.They point us in the proper direction, where dry logic can then b of best use. While the world often confronts us with a wide array of choices(How should u invest ur retirement savings? Whom should u marry?), the emotional learning that life has given us(such as the memory of a disastrous investment, or a painful break-up) sends signals that streamline the decision by eliminating some options &amp; highlighting others @ the outset. In this way, neurologists &amp; psychoanalysts argue that the emotional brain(limbic system) is as involved in reasoning as is the thinking brain(neocortex). The emotions then matter 4 rationality. &nbsp; It is not that we want 2 do away with emotions &amp; put reasonin in it's place, but rather 2 find the intelligent balance of the 2. We need 2 harmonize head &amp; heart. &nbsp; Reframing a situation more positively is one of the most potent ways 2 put anger 2 rest. &nbsp; A universal trigger 4 anger is the sense of being endangered. Endangerment can be signalled not just by an outright physical threat, but also, as is more often the case, by a symbollic threat 2 self-esteem or dignity. &nbsp; Distraction is a highly powerful mood-altering device(mostly anger) 4 a simple reason; It's hard 2 stay angry when we r havin a good time. The trick of course is 2 get anger 2 cool 2 the point where someone can have a good time in the 1st place. &nbsp; It is the combination of reasonable talent &amp; the ability 2 keep going in the face of defeat that leads 2 success. 4 a given level of intelligence, ur actual achievement is a fxn not just of talent, but also of ur capacity 2 stand defeat.

      We always hear "the rules" from the female side. Now here are the rules from the male side. These are 'OUR' rules! Please note... these are all numbered "1" ON PURPOSE!  1. Learn to work the toilet seat. You're a big girl. If it's up, put it down. We need it up, you need it down. You don't hear us complaining about you leaving it down.  1. Sunday = sports. It's like the full moon or the changing of the tides. Let it be. 1. Shopping is NOT a sport. And no, we are never going to think of it that way. 1. Crying is blackmail.  1. Ask for what you want. Let us be clear on this one: Subtle hints do not work! Strong hints do not work! Obvious hints do not work! Just say it!  1. Yes and No are perfectly acceptable answers to almost every question.  1. Come to us with a problem only if you want help solving it. That's what we do. Sympathy is what your girlfriends are for.  1. A headache that lasts for 17 months is a problem. See a doctor.  1. Anything we said 6 months ago is inadmissible in an argument. In fact, all comments become null and void after 7 days.  1. If you won't dress like the Victoria's Secret girls, don't expect us to act like soap opera guys.  1. If you think you're fat, you probably are. Don't ask us.  1. If something we said can be interpreted two ways, and one of the ways makes you sad or angry, we meant the other one.  1. You can either ask us to do something or tell us how you want it done. Not both. If you already know best how to do it, just do it yourself.  1. Whenever possible, please say whatever you have to say during commercials. 1. Christopher Columbus did not need directions and neither do we.  1. ALL men see in only 16 colors, like Windows default settings. Peach, for example, is a fruit, not a color. Pumpkin is also a fruit. We have no idea what mauve is.  1. If it itches, it will be scratched. We do that.  1. If we ask what is wrong and you say "nothing," we will act like nothing's wrong. We know you are lying, but it is just not worth the hassle.  1. If you ask a question you don't want an answer to, expect an answer you don't want to hear.  1. When we have to go somewhere, absolutely anything you wear is fine...... Really.......  1. Don't ask us what we're thinking about unless you are prepared to discuss such topics as baseball, the shotgun formation, or monster trucks.  1. You have enough clothes.  1. You have too many shoes.  1. I am in shape.. Round is a shape. Thank you for reading this; Yes, I know, I have to sleep on the couch tonight, but did you know men really don't mind that, it's like camping.

      What truth value do you give&nbsp;to the following statement(s)... 1) This statement is false.  2) The next statement is right, the previous statement is wrong.   Great minds discuss ideas; Average minds discuss events; Small minds discuss people.   Learn from the mistakes of others,You can't live long enough to make them all yourself.   The simpleton(foolish person) didn't know the task was impossible, so he did it.  Staying in a relatively constant, organized state violates the second law of thermodynamics, which states that the degree of disorder (entropy) of all objects increases. For a living organism to maintain organization, it must take in, process and expend energy. The way humans and other animals do this is by eating&nbsp;food and extracting energy from it.

      Once upon a time, there lived a man who had a terrible passion for baked beans. He loved them, but they always had an embarrassing and somewhat lively reaction on him. One day he met a girl and fell in love. When it was apparent that they would marry, he thought to himself "She'll never go for me carrying on like that," so he made the supreme sacrifice and gave up his beloved baked beans, and shortly after, that they got married.  It was his birthday a few months later and, on the way home from work, his car broke down.  Since they lived in the country, the man called his wife and told her he would be late because he had to walk.  On his way home, he passed a small cafe and the wonderful aroma of baked beans overwhelmed him. Since he still had several miles to walk, he figured he could walk off any ill effects before he got home. So he went in and ordered, and before leaving had three extra large helpings of baked beans. All the way home he 'putt-putted'. He 'putted' down one hill and 'putt-putted' up the next.  By the time he arrived home he felt reasonably safe. His wife met him at the door and seemed somewhat excited.  She exclaimed, "Darling, I have the most wonderful surprise for you for dinner tonight!" She put a blindfold on him, and led him to his chair at the head of the table and made him promise not to peek.   At this point he was beginning to feel another one coming on. Just as she was about to remove the blindfold, the telephone rang. She again made him promise not to peek until she returned, and she went to answer the phone. While she was gone, he seized the opportunity. He shifted his weight to one leg and let go. It was not only loud, but ripe as a rotten egg. He had a hard time breathing, so he felt for his napkin and fanned the air about him. He had just started to feel better, when another urge came on. He raised his leg and 'rrriiiipppp!' It sounded like a diesel engine revving, and smelled worse. To keep from gagging, he tried fanning his arms awhile, hoping the smell would dissipate. Things had just about returned to normal when he felt another urge coming. He shifted his weight to his other leg and let go. This was a real blue-ribbon winner; the windows rattled, the dishes on the table shook and, a minute later, the flowers on the table were dead. While keeping an ear tuned in on the conversation in the hallway, and keeping his promise of staying blindfolded, he carried on like this for the next ten minutes, farting and fanning them each time with his napkin. When he heard his wife saying goodbye (indicating the end of his loneliness, and freedom) he neatly laid his napkin on his lap and folded his hands on top of it. Smiling contentedly, he was the picture of innocence when his wife walked in. Apologizing for taking so long, she asked if he had peeked at the dinner. After assuring her he had not, she removed the blindfold and yelled,  "Surprise!!"  To his shock and horror, there were twelve dinner guests seated around the table for his surprise birthday party.

      The world is divided into a number of standard time zones. Roughly speaking, there are 24 time zones spaced at intervals of 15° in longitude. (Practically, due to geographic and political factors, the boundaries of time zones are more circuitous. In addition, a few time zones are offset by an odd number of half hours from the Greenwich and U. S. time zones.) Within the confines of each time zone, the hour and minute of the day is defined to be the same. Time zones eliminate the problem that local noon (defined according to the elevation of the  urlLink Sun ) actually occurs at a different time for nearby towns at slightly different longitudes, so that each town's clocks differ by a few minutes from those of neighboring clocks. This problem was already encountered in making up timetables for long distance train travel, but became completely unmanageable with the advent of modern air travel. Defining time zones means than watches need only be adjusted in one hour steps upon crossing of a time zone boundary, as opposed to continuously along any east-west journey.  Time zones are usually specified by the number of hours they differ from  urlLink Greenwich mean time . Greenwich, England is defined as the 0 of longitude, and is the center of the Greenwich time zone, relative to which other time zones are usually referenced. For example, U. S. Eastern Standard Time (EST) is UT - 5 hours, U. S. Central Time (CST) is UT - 6 hours, U. S. Mountain Time (MST) is UT - 7 hours, and U. S. Pacific Time (PST) is UT - 8 hours.  Almost all time zones differ an integral number of hours from GMT, but there are a number, the most famous of which in North America is Newfoundland, which differ by an odd number of half-hours. Other examples are Iran, Afghanistan, India, Nepal, Myanmar, and central Australia.  Unfortunately, the system is further complicated by  urlLink daylight saving time , which is seasonally inserted in some (but not all) time zones.  urlLink Daylight saving time  is in effect during summer, and is usually one hour ahead of Standard Time.   An  urlLink hour  shift which is seasonally inserted in some (but not all)  urlLink time zones . Daylight saving time is in effect during  urlLink summer , and is usually one hour ahead of  urlLink standard time . In those portions of the United States which observe daylight saving time, it is in effect from the first Sunday in April to the last Sunday of October. Daylight savings time begins when clocks are set from 2:00 a.m. to 3:00 a.m. on the first Sunday in April and ends when clocks are set from 3:00 a.m. to 2:00 a.m. on last Sunday in October.  Europe also observes Daylight Saving Time, but the dates on which is goes into effect and ends are different than in the U. S. In particular, it shifts to daylight saving time one week earlier than the U.S. in the  urlLink spring . In the southern hemisphere, insertion and removal are inverted from in the northern hemisphere   urlLink Benjamin Franklin  was among the first Americans to discuss the idea of Daylight Saving Time. In fact, he proposed the idea while serving as U.S. minister to France as a way of conserving the cost of lighting for shops. The purpose has been to essentially utilize more of the daylight hours in  urlLink spring  and  urlLink summer  for daytime activities. Simply put, the  urlLink Sun  is up longer in the sky (rises earlier and sets later) in  urlLink summer . Clocks and common mechanical timepieces keep what's called  urlLink civil time , which roughly corresponds to the passage of a fictitious "average"  urlLink Sun  through our sky. This is necessary since the  urlLink Sun  does not  urlLink rise  and  urlLink set  on a regular basis, but changes by as much as 15 minutes through out the course of the year.

      A redneck family from the hills was visiting the city and they were in a mall for the first time in their life. The father and son were strolling around while the wife shopped. They were amazed by almost everything they saw, but especially by two shiny, silver walls that could move apart and then slide back together again.  The boy asked, "Paw, What's 'at?"  The father (never having seen an elevator) responded, "Son, I dunno. I ain't never seen anything like that in my entire life, I ain't got no idea'r what it is."  While the boy and his father were watching with amazement, a fat old lady in a wheel chair rolled up to the moving walls and pressed a button. The walls opened and the lady rolled between them into a small room. The walls closed and the boy and his father watched the small circular numbers above the walls light up sequentially. They continued to watch until it reached the last number and then the numbers began to light in the reverse order. Then the walls opened up again and a gorgeous, voluptuous 24-year-old blonde woman stepped out.  The father, not taking his eyes off the young woman, said quietly to his Son, "Boy, go git yo Momma.... "

      Police in Los Angeles had good luck with a robbery suspect who just couldn't control himself during a lineup. When detectives asked each man in the lineup to repeat the words, "Give me all your money or I'll shoot," the man shouted, "that's not what I said!"  &nbsp;     INTELLIGENCE    Two Italian construction workers were in the field on an extremely hot day working.. the one says to the other "hey how come we do all a da work and he gets all a da money?" pointing to the supervisor. The other says, "I don't know, go ask him." So Guido goes up to the supervisor and says "Hey, how come we do all a da work and you get all a da money?" The supervisor says "Intelligence". Guido says "what is this intelligence?" The supervisor puts his hand on a tree and says "Hita my hand as hard as you can!" Guido winds up and with all his might tries to hit the supervisors hand. Just as he almost does the supervisor pulls his hand away and Guido hits the tree! The supervisor says "Thats intelligence". Still smarting Guido goes back to his coworker and his coworker says "Hey what did he say?" With a sheepish look on his face Guido puts his hand on his face and says "hita my hand as hard as you can. . ."    €200 A NIGHT   A very shy guy goes into a bar and sees a beautiful woman sitting at the bar. After an hour of gathering up his courage he finally goes over to her and asks, tentatively, "Um, would you mind if I chatted with you for a while?" To which she responds by yelling, at the top of her lungs, "No, I won't sleep with you tonight!" Everyone in the bar is now staring at them. Naturally, the guy is hopelessly and completely embarrassed and he slinks back to his table. After a few minutes, the woman walks over to him and apologizes. She smiles at him and says, "I'm sorry if I embarrassed you. You see, I'm a graduate student in psychology and I'm studying how people respond to embarrassing situations." To which he responds, at the top of his lungs, "What do you mean €200 for a night?"    SIGN SEEN IN A BAR   "Those drinking to forget please pay in advance   How do you prevent diseases caused by biting insects? Don't bite any.

When she comes back she's crying. Her boyfriend asks her what happend.  "As I was leaving the bathroom, a big guy at the pool table said he wanted to kiss my breasts all night long"!  The boyfriend stood up from his stool and takes off his jacket.  "He also said he wants to screw me all night long"!! By this time the boyfriend is furious and starts walking to the pool table.  "He said he wants to drink beer from my pussy all night"!!! The boyfriend stops, turns around, sits back up on his stool and grabs his beer.  His girlfriend is stunned, and asks why he wasn't doing anything about the jerk at the pool table.  The boyfriend says "I'm sorry Honey, - but I'm not messing around with a guy that can drink that much beer"!    CONSEQUENCES OF ALCHOHOL   A professor of chemistry wanted to teach his 5th grade class a lessonabout the evils of liquor, so he produced an experiment that involved aglass of water, a glass of whiskey, and two worms.  "Now, class. Observe closely the worms," said the professor putting aworm first into the water. The worm in the water writhed about, happy asa worm in water could be.  The second worm, he put into the whiskey. It writhed painfully, andquickly sank to the bottom, dead as a doornail.  "Now, what lesson can we derive from this experiment?" the professorasked.  Johnny, who naturally sits in back, raised his hand and wiselyresponded, "Drink whiskey and you wont get worms

       WHY WOMEN TALK TOO MUCH   A husband was trying to prove to his wife that women talk more than men, so he showed her a study that said men use about 15,000 words averagely, while women use 30,000. The wife promptly told him that women use twice as many words because they have to repeat everything they say to men. Looking stunned, the husband said, "what?" Women use twice as many words because they have to repeat everything they say to men.  &nbsp;   SORE TOOTH   A new guy in town walks into a bar and reads a sign that hangs over the bar... FREE BEER! FREE BEER FOR THE PERSON WHO CAN PASS THE TEST! So the guy asks the bartender what the test is.  Bartender replies "Well, first you have to drink that whole gallon of pepper tequila( a brand of alchohol), the WHOLE thing at once and you can't make a face while doing it. Second, there's a 'gator out back with a sore tooth...you have to remove it with your bare hands. Third, there's a woman up-stairs who's never had an orgasm. You gotta make things right for her." The guy says, "Well, as much as I would love free beer, I won't do it. You have to be nuts to drink a gallon of pepper tequila and then get crazier from there.  Well, as time goes on and the man drinks a few, he asks, "Wherez zat teeqeelah?"  He grabs the gallon of tequilla with both hands, and downs it with a big slurp and tears streaming down his face. Next, he staggers out back and soon all the people inside hear the most frightening roaring and thumping, then silence. The man staggers back into the bar, his shirt ripped and big scratches all over his body.  "Now" he says "Where's that woman with the sore tooth?"   &nbsp;   ALLIGATOR TRICK   &nbsp;A man limps into a bar with a cane and alligator. The bartender stops him and says "Hold on a second here - you can't bring that animal in here, they aren't allowed!" So the man says, "But my gator here does a really cool trick..."  The bartender says "Well then, lets see!" So the man whips out his dick(private part) and shoves it in the gators mouth. He then takes his cane and starts bashing the gator in the head with it. A crowd gathers around and everyone is astonished when he pulls out his dick without a single scratch.  He looks around at the crowd and says, "Does anyone else want to try?" An old lady raises her hand and says..."Sure, but don't hit me with that stick."    MAN &amp; HIS MONKEY   A guy walks into a bar with his pet monkey. He orders a drink and while he's drinking it the monkey jumps around all over the place. The monkey grabs some olives off the bar and eats them, then grabs some sliced limes and eats them, then jumps up on the pool table, grabs the cue ball, sticks it in his mouth and swallows it whole.  The bartender screams at the guy, "Did you see what your monkey just did?" The guy says, "No, what?" "He just ate the cue ball off my pool table, whole!", says the bartender. "Yeah, that doesn't surprise me," replied the patron. He eats everything in sight, the little bastard. I'll pay for the cue ball and stuff." He finishes his drink, pays his bill, and leaves.  Two weeks later he's in the bar again, and he has his monkey with him. He orders a drink and the monkey starts running around the bar again. While the man is drinking his drink, the monkey finds a cherry on the bar. He grabs it, sticks it up his ass, pulls it out, and eats it.  The bartender is disgusted. "Did you see what your monkey did now?", he asks.  "Now what?", responds the patron.  "Well, he stuck a cherry up his ass, then pulled it out and ate it!" says the barkeeper.  "Yeah, that doesn't surprise me," replied the patron. "He still eats everything in sight, but ever since he ate that cue ball he measures everything first!"    CRAWLING HOME   A guy was sitting in a bar, drinking away. Suddenly he says to the bartender, "I have to go home or the wife will be mad".  (at this point he was loaded drunk)  He climbed down from the bar stool, and fell flat on his face. The man then said "I can't walk and I didn't have that much to drink?".  He gets up to give it another try, this time the same thing happens and he falls flat to his face. He says "I have to get home some way or the wife will kill me if I don't get home soon"!  He gets an idea of crawling home, so away he went crawling home. He crawled up to his apartment and slowely snuck into bed with his wife trying not to wake her.  The next morning he woke up &amp; saw his wife pacing in the room. She said "you were out drinking again last night weren't you!"  The man replied "NO WAY!"  And the wife said "YOU LIAR!  The bartender just called and said you left your wheelchair at the club again last night"!    FREE SEX   Two idiots drove to a gas station in a remote district for a fill-up because they heard about a contest being offered by the patrons of the station, to anybody who purchased a full tank of gas. When they went inside to pay, the man asked the attendant about the contest. The attendant said, "If you win, you're entitled to free SEX," and the man asked how can he enter the contest. The attendant explained "Well, I'm thinking of a number between 1-10, if you guess it right you win free SEX." So the idiot filled up and asked to play the contest and said " I Guess 7" "Sorry I was thinking of 8," replied the attendant. The next week, the two returned to the same gas station to get gas. When they went inside to pay, one idiot asked the attendant if the contest was still going on. "Sure," replied the attendant. I'm thinking of a number between 1-10, if you guess right, you win free sex. "2" said the idiot. "Sorry, I was thinking of 3," replied the attendant. Come back soon and try again. As the two idiots were walking back to the car, one idiot said to the other, "You know, I'm beginning to think this contest is rigged." "No way," said the other idiot, "My wife won twice last week."

      The rules for playing bedroom golf. Each player shall furnish his own equipment for play, normally one club and two balls. Play on course must be approved by the owner of the hole. Unlike outdoor golf, the object is to get the club in the hole and keep the balls out. For the most effective play, the club should have a firm shaft. Course owners are permitted to check shaft before play begins. Course owners reserve the right to restrict club length to avoid damage to the hole. The object of the game is to take as many strokes as necessary until the owner is satisfied play is complete. Failure to do so may result in being denied permission to play again. It is considered bad form to begin playing the hole immediately upon arrival. Experienced players will normally take time to admire the entire course, paying special attention to well formed mounds and bunkers. Players are cautioned not to mention other courses they have played on in the past or are currently playing on to the owner of the course being played. Upset owners have been known to damage a players equipment for this reason. Players are encouraged to have proper rain gear, just in case. Players should not assume that the course is in shape to play at all times. Players may be embarrassed if they find the course temporarily under repair. Players are advised to be extremely tactful in this situation. More advanced players will find alternate means of play when this is the case. Players should assume their match has been properly scheduled particularly when playing a new course for the 1st time. Previous players have been known to become irate if they discover someone else is playing what they considered to be a private course. The owner of the course is responsible for the pruning of any bushes, which may reduce the visibility of the hole. Players are also advised not to play on courses where there is no bush surrounding the hole. Players are strongly advised to get the owners permission before attempting to play the backside. Slow play is encouraged, however, players should be prepared to proceed at a quicker pace at the owners request. It is considered an outstanding performance, time permitting, to play the same hole several times in one match. You do not have to let other players play through. It is not advisable for two players to attempt the same hole at the same time.

      Chemistry Exam  The following is an actual question given on a University of Washington chemistry mid-term:  Question:  "Is Hell exothermic [gives off heat) or endothermic (absorbs heat)? Support your answer with a proof."  Most of the students wrote proofs of their beliefs using Boyle's Law (gas cools off when it expands and heats up when it is compressed) or some variant. One student, however, wrote the following:  Answer:First, we need to know how the mass of Hell is changing in time. So, we need to know the rate that souls are moving into Hell and the rate they are leaving. I think that we can safely assume that once a soul gets to Hell, it will not leave. Therefore, no souls are leaving. As for how many souls are entering Hell, let's look at the different religions that exist in the world today. Some of these religions state that if you are not a member of their religion, you will go to Hell. Since there are more than one of these religions and since people do not belong to more than one religion, we can project that all people and all souls go to Hell. With birth and death rates as they are, we can expect the number of souls in Hell to increase exponentially. Now, we look at the rate of change of the volume in Hell because Boyle's Law states that in order for the temperature and pressure in Hell to stay the same, the volume of Hell has to expand as souls are added. This gives two possibilities.  1) If Hell is expanding at a slower rate than the rate at which souls enter Hell, then the temperature and pressure in Hell will increase until all Hell breaks loose.  2) Of course, if Hell is expanding at a rate faster than the increase of souls in Hell, then the temperature and pressure will drop until Hell freezes over.So which is it? If we accept the postulate given to me by Ms. Therese Banyan during my Freshman year "That it will be a cold night in Hell before I sleep with you," and take into account the fact that I still have not succeeded in having sexual relations with her, then (2) cannot be true, and thus I am sure that Hell is exothermic.The student got the only A.

      &nbsp;Actually, this is not from me. Don't remember where it's from, but it highly reflects my trend of thought, so I kept it until today, when I started blogging. &nbsp; &nbsp; "No, Africa is not a country"; "Yes, we do have cars"; "Not everyone lives in mud huts"; "Yes, Charlize Theron and Dave Matthews are real Africans"…Welcome to a day in the life of an African living in the USA!Over the years, an abundance of these and many other shockingly ignorant and bewildering questions have led me to ask myself, why is Africa so grossly misrepresented in the USA?When Will Smith returned from filming Ali in 2001, he went on American TV and explained how he felt duped and misinformed when, upon arriving at Jan Smuts’s airport, he found that the Africa he had been taught in school and seen on TV was NOTHING like what he had come to experience first hand. Like Smith, many Americans who do finally set foot in Africa, fall head over heals in love with her beauty, hospitality, and splendour, and most continue to return. "A piece of your soul stays in Africa", explains Michael, an Attorney in Atlanta, Georgia.As many Africans in the USA will tell you, we often find ourselves going on the defensive, trying to speak up on behalf of a continent which, though burdened by its fair share of turmoil and strife, is by far the most beautiful and spiritual places on earth. We have found ourselves indignantly whipping out photo albums to show them our beautiful lush homes, our hypnotic Jacaranda trees, the awe-inspiring Table Mountain and the majestic Victoria Falls.Many Africans find themselves having to explain certain attributes about themselves, as if being African renders them unworthy of these qualities. A close Zimbabwean friend of mine was recently branded a pariah in his workplace after an exchange he had with one of his new African American compendres, "You’re from Africa? Wow, I am surprised you speak such good English!" the American quipped. To which my proud friend retorted, "I am surprised you speak proper English too!"Another South African acquaintance found he had to prove he is a ‘real’ African simply because he is white.Frustrated by these and many other incidents, I set out on a quest to unravel this mystery and get to the bottom of this misinformation. Surely we cannot lay all blame at the foot of the mass media machine…or can we?Over the course of a week, I took to the streets and randomly picked 10 Americans from different walks of life and asked them each 4 simple questions: 1. What 2 words spring to mind when you hear the name Africa? 2. Name 5 African countries 3. Name 2 positive things you associate with Africa 4. Would you ever visit Africa? If not, why? What I unearthed was a vacuous, narrow-minded viewpoint which left me even more baffled than I was going in.All 10 of my respondents named AIDS as the word that immediately sprung to mind when they thought of Africa. The other common words were civil war, famine, female genital mutilation, Mandela, slave trade and wild animals.When it came to naming countries, the most common were Kenya, Ethiopia, South Africa, Nigeria and Liberia, (sprinkled with a misguided Guyana here and Chile there!). Most struggled to name 10.The positive (surely something good has come out of Africa!) they thought, were; the Lion King (I’m serious!), Ancient Egypt, Mt Kilimanjaro, preservation of wildlife, and the beautiful African women. One "enlightened" African American actually said (to my face), that slavery was a positive thing because without it, he’d still be living in Africa "without running water or toilets".The majority were nonchalant about visiting Africa, with several saying that despite Africa’s strife, they consider a visit to Africa to be a pilgrimage which every black person should make at least once in their lives.Honestly, I was hurt! I felt as if they had insulted my family. I wanted to tell each one of them how sad and misguided they were…how disappointing it was that they saw the world through such short-sighted lenses. How infuriating it was that people in Africa strive to emulate the American culture and idolize American celebrities, yet they in turn could not look past a biased news report, documentary or "Save the Children" food drive, complete with fly infested, snotty nosed, malnutritioned babies. But then something dawned on me…WHOSE RESPONSIBILITY IS IT TO REPRESENT AFRICA? I realized that as long as we allow other people to tell our stories and comment on our issues, we shall forever be branded and placed into a box which best suits them. I cannot be angry at these people, it’s not their fault. Because too few of us have stepped forward and tried to tell our positive, inspiring and diverse stories we have been relegated to the notions and opinions of someone else.Once I realized that I had the power to change the negative perception of Africa, I felt positive and empowered, and hopeful that one day the world would come to view Africa, and Africans as the multi-dimensional and majestic people that they are.

      He who closes his eyes sees nothing, even in the full light of day.   If you're not living on the edge you're taking up too much space.   Given enough time &amp; resources, good security testing will ultimately penetrate the system. The role of the system designer is to make penetration cost more than the value of information that will be obtained.   The problem is not that there are problems. The problem is expecting otherwise &amp; thinkin that having problems is a problem.

But the other four balls - family, health, friends, and spirit are made of glass. If you drop one of these, they will be irrevocably scuffed, marked, nicked, damaged, or even shattered.

      Skepticism is a two edged sword, both sides sharp, as pure as blue steel and just as clean. One side does not allow us to believe everything off hand; the other does not let us necessarily dismiss anything off hand.   Ideally, before a scientist can contribute to the world of knowledge, he must first learn all that has been compiled before him; what others have observed and cross referenced, many times back thousands of years. "I stand on the shoulder of giants," said Newton.   This is the world of a priori, which means the system of cross-referencing by accumulated knowledge. When you approach a zoologist with a report of a creature that has feathers, a bill, waddles on webbed feet and goes "quack, quack" there is an a priori reason for that zoologist to say "It's a duck." He doesn't have to go and observe it himself and waste time because there is an appropriate cross reference for such a phenomenon. It's a duck!  When you approach a zoologist and say "I saw something with scales, that was pink, has 5 legs and a bill like a bird but a tail like a fish." You are not going to get a good reply because there is an a priori reason for him to say there is not such creature. There is no catalogue for such an animal as you described. "Now, go see your doctor or get off the gin."   Nothing happens contrary&nbsp;to the laws of nature, except the impossible... &amp; that never happens.   The&nbsp;President of Cameroon&nbsp; hired a barber&nbsp;to shave everybody who doesn't shave himself &amp; only them. The question is... who shaved the barber?   The unexplained points us to where we must look, not from where we must flee.  &nbsp; Understanding, as opposed to proper application, represents a function of science, not of engineering.

      Prosperity brings friends &amp; adversity tests them. &nbsp; No decision is worse than making the wrong decision. &nbsp; The fact that man eats, sleeps &amp; works does not define his personality; his personality is defined by what he eats, how he sleeps &amp; what is distinctive about his work patterns. Hence individuality &amp; uniqueness are essential&nbsp;to the definitiion. &nbsp; Is change rather than stability the normative mode of life? &nbsp; Many people take their work&nbsp;too seriously. It's good&nbsp;to be keen &amp; conscientious, but&nbsp;to be over-sensitive places a great strain upon the nervous system. If you do your best, you can't do more.&nbsp;To lie awake&nbsp;at night &amp; think about some error you made during the day is the height of folly. There is no human being who hasn't made a mistake. Try&nbsp;to get a correct sense of values. A small human error can be easily adjusted. But your nervous system &amp; your soul cannot be easily repaired, so guard it &amp; preserve it.   At times, when u look without finding, u find without looking.   He who believes that money can do everything can do everything for money.
