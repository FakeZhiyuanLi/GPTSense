      just when you thought things couldn't get any worse .. somehow word just gets around and voila ! your whole world comes crashing on you .. on 24th may 2004 .. i've heard about new shocking enough .. just today at 10 am in the morning .. i found out somehting worse alot worse then what i thought it would be .. the WHOLE entire story about jace pushing jee may away in her house in her couch was all fake .. in fact she seemed like the holy innocent  thing  and jee may was such a big bitch .. here comes true story .. when jee may argued with nish .. they both went up to jace's room .. jee may laid her face on jaces lap .. and they were flirting with each other - jace's side of HER stupid story .. jee may laid her head on jace lap .. jace push away and felt awkward .. fuck her .. chin came up on time .. then they both went out to the couch in the living room .. jee may and jace were holding hands FLIRTING with EACH OTHER again .. and jace said .. come la let's kiss .. no feelings involved .. jaces side of the story - jee may hold my hand but i let go .. then i pull her downstairs .. again .. fuck her .. then they both went driving around for god knows how long and went to jee mays house for dunnoe how long either .. oh .. and there's a continuation to this story .. something that jace TOTALLY CUT IT out from the picture .. jace fetched jee may back from college for a few days .. SHE had probably told me she's gonna fetch her nannys .. nannys huh ? .. i didn't know she was fond of frenching nannys .. and the very last time she sent jee may home .. jace parked somewhere NEAR jee mays house .. looked at her and said .. come la .. for fun .. and they frenched .. great huh ? ..sucks doesn't it .. someone whom you trusted and givin chances .. tries after tries . and believing her fake story .. she told jeemay he missed the times they were together that it was peaceful and all that .. why did we even argue then ? why were we on a break ? .. it was because of she herself .. she lied about ju nn .. i never understood why she had to do it .. what exactly have i done wrong .. what part have i not played as her girlfriend .. i feel like a total idiot .. looking at her now is exactly the same as staring at a stranger .. i never knew she could stoop so low .. everything seems to be a total waste of time .. i never thought there'd be a day i'd say this .. but i regret this relationship

      it's the 16th .. originally .. it's sposed to be the decision making day .. well .. it being made .. and i guess i'm just not strong enough to get up by myself .. i hate to say it .. but i need her .. well .. she IS all i have .. whatever it is though .. i have to now remind myself never to trust her too much and never to worry and obsess about her too much either .. because it wouldn't do me good when shits happen .. i will keep my distance .. but i won't ignore her .. the situation's a LIL bit better .. but i'm still sore about it .. and i'm not gonna rattle on about it because it's sickening to see every of my post about that * incident * .. all i can hope for know is to forgive .. but not forget .. cause i am going to keep that it mind ..  i hate mondays =( .. their so awful .. school sucks like usual .. i'm gonna sabotage the alarm tonight again =p .. yay .. no accounts tomorrow .. i've just got a job .. some shoot for some bank .. i can finally go on some crazy shopping spree .. it's been awhile since i can spend money in peace .. the hotel's booked .. yay .. i can't wait .. hopefully everyone can turn up for it .. first day of tuition today .. i miss my old teacher .. argh .. the new one's so irritatingly bitchy .. i did 80 questions in one class k .. that's like over the limits for me .. my poor brain feels so stressed ..  anyway .. it's gonna be a brand new start .. and hopefully .. things will be fine .. no more lies no more scandals no more pretense ..

      you know what .. i actually wrote this post already .. a super long one in fact .. but the whole thing just disappeared when i published it .. ARGH ! .. i'm getting mood swings again .. anyway .. i'm so not in the mood to type another long one now already so ii'm just gonna brief through what i wrote .. it's friday the 13th today .. and i really really hope that no shits gonna happen to me .. hey .. i believe in black cats k .. in addition to it i'm gonna watch * the village * tonight somemore .. so it's just gonna make matters worst .. i've been having lots of dreams recently .. adnt their ALL bad ones .. aih .. i think the worst one was about some tribal spirits plucking my toes off .. it's freaky man .. i woke up with my feet feeling so numb and cold .. this whole week has been shitty actually .. me and jace are at each other's throat ALL the time ! .. i dunno la .. i feel like one big bad bitch .. it's like now when she cries .. all i say is ok .. bye .. last time i'd call back to make things right .. i just dun see the point now .. i wanna forget it all .. but the whole things is still stuck in my head .. my mom nearly sent me to some doctor .. she claimed that i look so depressed all the time .. plus she saw the cuts on my hand .. it's healing .. but the scars are dark .. seems that i'm undergoing sign's of chronic depression .. didn't go in the end though .. she had appointment ..  to make matters worse .. jade called me .. apparently jace's mom wants to talk to me too .. probably complaining that i stress her daughter too much or something .. i dunno .. it seems like she has something against me .. probably thinks i'm hurting jace all the time .. it seems unfair .. everytime they see jace cry .. it's as if i'm the main cause of it .. and i dunno la .. jade told me to be more understanding .. give in and dun call her when she's working .. i dun even call her anymore this days .. only that once in a while to ask her some small stuff .. this is really bias .. have they seen ME cry ? .. i dun think so rite .. so how can they just go pushing it all on me telling me to give in ? do they even know the cause of this ? .. even if they do .. they'd probably feel it's no big deal on my side .. and that's seriously bias .. i dunno la .. i am being more stubborn this days i do admit .. but who made me this way ? ..  i hate things now la .. i'm like the bitch to every problems we have now .. i'm so afraid of everything .. being close to her again .. caring for her again .. to the extend of frenching her ! so many thoughts have been wandering around my mind .. the main big question still though is - WHY .. why did she have to do it .. i'm still haunted by the image of jee may telling me the whole thing in sandy park .. i can rememebr how exactly i felt then .. ugh .. that was one of the worst feeling ever .. even worst then guilt .. i'm thinking so much lately that i think i'm graying .. i just plucked two white hair out yesterday .. maybe my kiss sucks so much that she has to find somebody else .. or maybe she was getting bored of me .. or maybe i'm just plain awful to look at .. recently i feel so .. down .. totally no more self esteem .. i'm like some ugly duckling now =  dunno la .. when am i ever gonna get over this incident .. or get over her .. both seems impossible .. our arguments lately are getting more serious .. but over more silly things .. i make one comment .. and then she misunderstands and then we argue .. argh .. tonights friday night .. i bet you will argue about where to go after our movie .. she's sick today la though .. despite how i say i dun care about her .. i still do .. well .. a lil bit la .. she's sick .. and .. dragging her around to smoky and noisy places isn't exactly the best thing for her condition now .. oh .. btw .. ju nn messaged her yesterday .. her face looked paled when it was ju who messaged her .. i'm so so sure that they haven been talking .. maybe not this week .. cause ju said * didin't talk to you for such a long time * .. i think their long time is probably 1 week or something .. anyway .. i realised something .. she told me before not to type any * heheh or hahah * in her messages when she ask me to help her reply .. when i ask why .. she said - oh .. i dun type liddat wan la only to you .. yea yeaaaaaa .. in all her messages with ju nn .. there's definitely a * hahah * inside it all .. i'm not jealous .. not anymore .. last time i'd pounce on her already .. i'm fine .. infact i just wanted to point it out to her ..  aaaaaaannnddddd .. apparently on the 24th .. leo installation day .. or 17th .. doesn't matter la .. a bunch of peepz saw her around ju's housing area at 12 something 1 .. and that was the exact same time ju nn got home from her movie .. apparently .. at first .. there was a girl in the passenger seat .. then when ju nn got home ..t hey saw her car again and saw no girl in the passenger seat .. or something liddat la .. i'm not very clear myself .. hrm .. she changed huh ? .. i can't say anything .there's no solid evidence .. i dun even feel like acting smart to kan toi her like last time .. i look at myself now and last time .. damn .. i was a total jealous and control freak .. it's quite scary actually .. it feels better now .. i love her .. full stop .. i dun love her till i can go mad like last time sorta thing .. so .. things are quite slumber for me now ..BUT .. the worst part is .. i STILL listen to her .. bleh .. that makes her in total control .. and she's more free i guess .. since i dun really bother ..  i could have sworn jac would call ju nn when she went home from my house yesterday .. hahah .. nvmla .. i think this post is longer then my other one .. hope is doesn't go missing again .. i can't wait to get ready .. i'm so freaking bored i need to get out of the house now .. hopefully we'd find a place to go after the movie and not argue about it ..

      was in malacca the whole day till eight .. i ate so much i'm feeling so freaking guilty right now .. argument again today .. mebbe it was kinda my fault in a way .. i didn't try to look for trouble exactly .. but certain things she said just made me fire back .. today's some eddy and cheng may thingy that she was sposed to help out .. when we were having problems and shit then she will promise every single thing .. and then slowly la .. she'll let it go then start taking advantage .. ARGH ! .. i feel like tearing my hair out !!!!! why can't i just get over her and let this all go .. i need to get a life .. for example : last week or 2 weeks ago when our situation sucks more then our situation now .. she said - eddie ask me to help him for some cheng may surprise thing .. it's for awhile only .. i'll just help him light candles then i will leave .. but if your not okay with it then it's okay .. i wun go .. - sounds so nice right ??? .. obviously i couldn't be the bitch and say no .. after all there's no harm in that .. ooooohhhh .. then today  .. she said - i'm going to stay there for about one hour liddat okay .. he's gonna buy alchohol and food so i'm going to stay there and chill for while .. i dun mind .. really .. not a single bit .. i dun care as much anymore .. but i was kinda moody .. so i pointed out what she said the last time .. then she started getting pissed and said that was TWO weeks AGO LA .. with her that sorta irritated * slang .. then i told you JUST now already wert that i'm going to stay .. liddat also cannot meh ???? ..  ARRGGHHHHH .. actually it's just like some stupid tiny problem la .. but it's just so annoying that she won't keep her stupid promises wan la .. she'll just be " good " for that one week .. MAX - 2 weeks .. then she'll just be the same .. RAWWWWRRR .. i hate this la .. I BET EVERY SINGLE PENNY i own that in ONE months time she'd start lying about calling ju nn .. two weeks later about going out WITH ju nn or whatever la .. it can be another girl now for all i care la .. then when shit happens she'll just say the same stupid things .. grrrr .. or maybe she'd just go french some other girl in .. about .. k la .. TWO months time perhaps ? ..  i feel like strangling something now .. >=

      finally .. friday .. this week passed so slowly .. i'm even starting to miss school .. didn't go school again today .. stoned till 9 pm .. i realise that we argue over all sorts of stupid things .. incuding where to go .. went to bangsar at 9 something to have dinner at first .. even there we stoned at one spot for 45 minutes exactly arguing about going to atmosphere or stay in bangsar .. dumb huh ? .. plus she's the one saying it's alot of risk .. laura can't enter etc etc .. but she's like pushing to go .. so fine .. when we agreed .. she get's started on the laura thingy again .. then when i was patiently telling her .. ok .. since it's so much trouble .. let's just stay in bangsar .. and then she said ' what .. you dun believe me izzit ' .. then started challenging and stuff .. when the argument's over .. she started complaining that i lose my temper ..  it was fine after that .. FINALLY decided to go to Rush .. then she got irritated at me for nothing .. cause she thought i was irritated .. when all i said was that i wanted a non alchohol drink when she ordered vodka .. argh .. laura got into deep shit today i guess .. i think her mum must be pissed at me or something too .. she kan toi-d .. big time .. she passed the phone to edmund and he blurred there .. suddenly blurting out that his * krystal's father .. she stayed over that night .. she was pretty nice the whole time .. suddenly out of nowhere i mood swinged and got emo about the whole jee may thingy again .. it felt good to have her there la .. she comforted me the whole time about it ..

      didn't go to school again today .. stoning at home the whole time .. less arguments with jace today though .. she went to swensens for awhile .. dunnoe why but i dun feel a single thing .. i guess i lost more feelings then i thought .. but not enough to let it go .. it sucks hanging .. i dun feel as sad and lonely without her around .. and i dun feel as happy with her around .. if only none of this shit happened .. maybe i've been dragging it on for a lil too long .. but it's not any small simple matter to me .. i hate having to act fine infront of her .. when i just want to tell her how sucky i feel about it still .. i dun wanna sound like a brat .. even the topics getting old for her ..i guess i'm just not satisfied with the situation now .. she said it before when we were still on break .. and she promised me like everything .. that she will do her best to prove me that she's changed and to leave everything to her .. i dun see any difference now .. it's still the same .. she's just acting as if the whole thing never happened .. i dun think i expect too much ( i guess ) .. it's just that she doesn't seem to be fulfilling anything .. sometimes i wonder if she even feels bad about it .. there are just times when i soooo want to let her know how i feel .. to just break my * promise * to her that i won purposely let her feel it .. but i just can't .. and that's the stupid part of me .. i keep to my promises when she doesn't .. if i was the one to be frenching somebody else .. i bet you she  would  be acting alot worse then me ..

      every month seems to pass quickly .. even faster then the month before .. this month however .. seems to be the hardest .. longest and most painful one .. still though i'm glad to be able to come through this 5th again .. cause it's mine and her 18th month anniversary together .. despite how many tears have been cried .. how many mean words have we shouted to each other .. we actually made it through together .. many times have i wanted to break down and just given up hope ..many times have i cried in the middle of the night .. even so .. i couldn't let it go .. the most painful of it all is to keep picturing the thought of both she and jee may frenching in her car .. just two days ago i was sitting down in the classroom .. out of nowhere i heard boon lian said to chris " come la chris .. for fun " .. the whole jee may thing flashed back instantly and i felt like stabbing boon liang's eye with my mechanical pencil ..  that's how badly the whole thing affected me .. arguments were all we shared this whole months .. my feelings for her aren't as strong .. but it still hurts knowing that i'm being such a bitch to her .. i know she tried being patient with me .. not much though but i know she tried .. and what's worse is that i keep pushing my limits .. i dun want to do it .. but i can't help it .. the anger .. hate and pain is still in me .. i just don't bring it up as often .. i love her .. i just dunno her .. forgiving your enemy isn't the hardest thing to do forgiving someone you love that did something to you is even harder .. i hope that we'd pull through this month till the next 5th .. that there be'd a whole lot less argument .. and a whole lot less crying at night ..
