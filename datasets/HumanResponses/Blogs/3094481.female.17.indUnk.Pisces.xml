LOVE!!!!! i noticed quite a lot of stuff over the past few days... n i thot it's really interesting... this love i'm talking abt is the relationship kinda love :)  as u all noe my grandpa juz passed away, all along i kinda din really think my grandma loved my grandpa tt much... weird rite... but its also bcos of a lot of things... 1stly they were matchmade (chinese custom), and i saw sum of their wedding fotos... my grandma din look tt happy... and since my aunt had my older cousin terence, my grandma moved out and since then (aprox 21 yrs) they've not been living together... and since i'm only 16 how wld i noe wad it used to be like rite? and when we had like dinners and stuff my grandma wld always sit at the kids table n my gramps at the adults one or vice versa.. and i always thot older folks were a bit more *ahem* rigid... like no affections kinda thing... but u noe wad was the sweetest thing? i realised tt my grams loves my gramps alot!!!!! she tried to keep herself busy to not start crying... but everytime she stopped... she just melted... n went into tears.. so my dad kept trying to keep her busy... i love my grandma... she's a really strong woman... u noe... n frm these few days i cld really see her love 4 everyone... her late husband... her children and her grandkids... even her son and daughters-in-law...  the second love i saw was the love between all the couples... basically my aunts and uncles... and esp my parents... aw... i love them... today was a really tough time for everyone bcos of the cremation... we went in... and everyone burst into tears.. it was a horrible experience... horrid... but yet i cld see how much everyone loved my grandpa... and a few times my dad had to go to the front.. everytime he came back juz to hold my mum's hand... and everytime my mum walked too fast she wld turn arnd and look 4 my dad to hold his hand... it was lovely... all the couples were amazing...  next was the love i saw in my cousin for my grandpa... terence has been staying with grandpa for abt 5 yrs i think... since he moved to the eunos apartment... its been really bad 4 him cos he was the one who found grandpa dead... he's the closest to grandpa... its been rough... he cried the loudest today... and it was heart-wrenching.. really painful... i cld see the way he wanted to go in and juz be with grandpa... he wanted so much done... made us fold gramp's favourite cigarettes to burn at the thing... he kept going to pay respects... n stayed over practically every nite to take care of the stuff and the casket... it's amazing...  the next was with my aunt, uncles and dad... the order from the oldest is uncle, dad,aunt,uncle... my aunt is also really close to grandpa... she also burst when she saw the casket going into the "furnace"... suddenly all her brothers juz reached out to pat her to comfort her... to put an arm arnd her...  this next love is one i've been observing 4 awhile now... my uncle (the one married to my dad's sister) loves my cousins alot (3 boys terence, derek n ron btw i got to name ron... haha after ronald macs... or at least i gave the idea when i was 6 n they decided to call him ron)i mean he's their dad... he's quite a good dad... i think he doesn't really noe how to express his love... but he's always there 4 them... always concerned... and always buying them stuff... they have 2 playstations... each of them have their own tvs coms rooms etc...yeah... tts his love...  the last love is the only one that really matters... the one tt i've had all my life and the one u all have as well... THE LOVE OF GOD.... He showed me noe... i noe we have to live by faith n all tt but u noe Daddy is the sweetest... when we're feeling like crap he just sends stuff to comfort us... we're always in his arms of love... n guess wad? the rest of the loves may die out but u noe wad? GOD's LOVE NEVER FAILS

       His eyes (song)   sometimes His eyes were gentle and filled with laughter  sometimes they cry  sometimes there was a fire of holy anger  In Jesus' eyes   But the eyes that saw hope in the hopeless  that saw thru the far to the   are the same eyes that looked down from heaven  into the deepest part of you and me   Chorus  His eyes are always upon us  His eyes never close in sleep  And no matter where you go you will always be in His eyes  In His eyes   Sometimes His voice comes calling like rolling thunder   like driving rain  sometimes His voice is quiet we start to wonder   if He knows our pain   But He who spoke peace to the waters  Cares more for our hearts than the waves  And the voice that once said you're forgiven  still says your forgiven today  Today   Sometimes i look above me, the stars are shining  i feel so small  How could the God of heaven and all creation  know i'm here at all?  But then in the silence He whispers  My child i created you too  And you're my most precious creation  I even gave my son for you   Chorus  NO matter where you go you will always be in His eyes  *this song held me through the sad hours of my life... very inspiring song.

       If God gave up on me   That would be the end of my life… I’d rather die than have to spend another second on earth.  I was recently talking to a great friend of mine and he was telling me how hard it was to talk to people who didn’t respond. He’s someone who was in my group where I was the group leader. At the recent camp he himself became a group leader. His promotion was like the moment for me (some motherly thing haha)… I was so proud of him… I agree he’s still learning so am i… but it really made me think a lot… the story goes that there’s this other guy in his group who’s someone who’s more of an introvert and very shy. I noe this guy pretty well as well and he’s someone who thinks he hasn’t been getting enough attention. I talked to my friend encouraging him to go and talk to this guy and just be a friend… but instead he told me that it was difficult when you kept talking and nothing happened… I realized how true that was but the funny thing is I’ve met probably more people like that than he ever has had to deal with yet I never found it hard… When God calls us to be leaders, He gives the call and the gifts… I truly believe with all my heart that this is one of those gifts leaders really need… and sumthing that we don’t just go “oh! Why should I put up with him?” but “there’s great potential in this guy.” That’s what God did for us… each and every one of us… He didn’t give up on me… and I noe it’s a gift that God gives… called enlarged vision… I’ve been through phases where I look at my group members and think, “Lord! Why me? Why do I have to put up with this?” rarely did I ever cry for Him to enlarge my vision but one night He did and when I looked around at my group members and the people around, I didn’t see what they were but what they could become and the potential they had. And that was what brought on the power to love them… suddenly loving them seemed like the easiest and the most natural thing… oh how precious… I’ve been very blessed to have this gift truly… I noe it’s a revelation that one has to catch on his or her own…  This is what God sees in us… He didn’t give up on us… He hasn’t and He never will… If God didn’t give up on me, how can I give up on someone else? God hasn’t given up on that person yet either… We, especially called as leaders, should never limit our people from receiving their inheritance as champions… Every time we fail God gives us another chance… not one more chance but another chance… so the same when our flock fail… Daddy does the same… He loves the unlovely… I want to do the same… It’s not easy on our own but with Jesus… that’s the answer Jesus… not sumthing we have to ask for but something he gives… just take… making the difference… believing in the person… oh man… I’m very inspired now… noe that Daddy hasn’t given up on you and He never will...

       The Old vs. the Young    It’s the time of they year again where we celebrate Chinese New Year… I admit my angbao collection isn’t exactly as extravagant as the past few years because my grandpa passed away recently and there are some superstitious relatives and pple we can’t visit… plus the fact that some of my uncles and aunts don’t wanna give out angbaos because of some dumb thing again… my cousin started going orh hor… cannot wear red just because I was wearing my nice bright red top… yeah… haha… but praise God I’m not bound by such things… anyway that’s another story…  Every year we go to visit my mum’s best friend’s mother, aunty Neo. She’s a very interesting lady who is really amazing. She used to be the principal of Rosyth primary sch and I heard that she did wonders to the school. She improved it so greatly that it’s become one of those schools where parents try to send their children to. She’s really a character. So this year again we went to visit her (she’s a Christian) and this year was a different topic (every year the topics are different). This year she was talking abt her grandchildren who have started dating and stuff… not that they’re very young or my age… her grandchildren are in their 20s. So here goes the Old vs. the Young… haha… yeah… she was telling us that nowadays, young people date a few people before settling down and marrying one. Even then many couples still get annulments and divorced… oh yeah I forgot to mention that she officiates weddings… she’s gonna officiate mine for sure… haha… she was telling us that one of her friend’s son dated abt 3 girls and kept saying that the one he was dating was the serious one… but in the end he married no. 3… She said that in the past there was no such thing… if a girl started dating a guy one on one it meant that they were already thinking of getting married… meaning that they could only date one guy and this one guy was going to be the one they married… and when we started going on to talking about divorce and annulments, she made a comment that made me go hmm… she said that nowadays young couples don’t stick through thick and thin unlike last time… no wonder their marriages lasted so long and lovingly… my dad added that it’s because nowadays all our relationships with people are very short and not long term… well that got me thinking… what she said about the young people nowadays is quite true… well a couple of guys have called me old-fashioned and stuff cos I’ve never had a bf before… never dated… and because I really want to only date the guy that I ultimately marry… for the reason that I don’t wanna get emotionally attached to any other guy… in that sense I’m quite like the older generation and maybe it’s cos I’m brought up that way… my parents are rather strict about dating especially for me… I really want my future husband to have the best of me… not the leftovers I guess… but nowadays yet it seems really ok for a person to have more than 3 bf/gfs… I mean not that I find anything strange abt that… but for myself… I mean thinking abt it wad would I want for myself? This is a matter of opinion and stuff and just something for whoever reads this to think about… cheers! Haha…

        BLESSED    BLESSED... i was talking to denise a few days ago... and when i went 4 campus dcn Chin Wah asked us to repeat Deut 28 after him... our going in and coming out are blessed... it's us tts blessed not our circumstance..  it's very easy to slip into the mentality that we're blessed bcos good things come our way and stuff... i have b4... and its easy to stumble cos of it... cos when bad things come we immediately start doubting God... u noe there's this saying i always hear in my grp of frenz and its always shared wif me... that only God and change are constant... well there's one more...(bsides God's love, grace... tt comes under God) and it's how blessed we are... we're not sumtimes more blessed sumtimes less blessed... we are constantly blessed... it's just how much we receive the blessings.... once we receive Christ all the blessings and promises are ours yes and amen... blessings are like a gift given to u... its for u to take and open and see God's goodness, not to put under lock and key.. cos like God's grace, his blessings abound much... sometimes we do go thru trials and tribulations haha i think this term is so... nvm... anyway... we do... but we are still blessed in these times... whenever i go thru stuff and i see myself as blessed Daddy's girl, i seem to come out of the situation much faster, less affected, stronger, wiser, and burdens less to carry... bcos when we noe tt we are blessed we let God carry everything...it's not wad we do but it's wad Christ has done... and it is finished... all we hafta do is let go... and believe that we are blessed... believing isnt always easy esp when we can't feel or touch... hmm i'm having a moment of noeing tt i'm blessed...  How do we noe we're blessed? have u ever felt happy just for nothing? i've had this feeling alot... and my frenz think i'm just having an infactuation wif sum guy or sumthing... but i can tell the world no!! i'm not! its the feeling of noeing i'm blessed... the feeling comes after i noe i'm blessed... truly... and when we realised that we're blessed, the blessings start pouring out faster and faster... and when we go thru situations we will always noe we're blessed... noe it in ur heart... not just in ur head... :) be blessed! (no pun intended haha)

       crushes   ok.... was juz reading a frenz blog... and stumbled across a really old entry.... abt dec kinda thing... abt his crush... n tt got me thinking haha.... columnist charis at ur service... ok i think this fren will noe i'm talking abt him.. haha... cos he's the only one i think who actually reads my blog... or he's the only one who told me he does...  anyway i started thinking abt this complex thing called crushes... haha... yeah i've had millions... really... the longest was abt 6 mths... and the shortest was abt 5 mins... many of my good frenz... all my guy frenz haha noe tt i'll never call a guy or even sms unless its really impt or i had to ask sumthing... never.. haha... tt was a little diversion... one of my best gal frenz denise noes practically all the crushes i've had.. haha everytime i haf sumthing to say or gush abt i call her... the strange thing abt girls... yeah... and altho i daydream n think and gush alot i never make the 1st move.. haha... not even signal or hint... i'm a real good actress... yeah so i thot abt it... its quite funny yeah if i like a guy n spend so much time thinking abt him but won't even give the subtlest hint... haha... even i think i'm funny... k i'm back cos i realised that i hadn't completed this revelation... but within this short time i've learnt alot n i'm here to share... i've recently gotten to be the being liked, the liker and someone who's close to someone who's a liker... got it? haha oh n i've been "mediator" before (altho we noe that mediator isn't as mediator seems haha) but not really someone who's close to a likee... cos usually the guys like me... AHAHA... i'm kidding... so now i present u all the different aspects: 1)the liker: this one i dun hafta say... like i said above... it's crazy when we like someone... when the person smiles at us the world seems brighter and happier all of a sudden but when tt person doesn't smile or frowns the world comes crashing down... i've tried to be realistic about the guy that i like... like no charis it's just a crazy infactuation.. but no... infactuation's cruel... no such thing as sensible infactuation understand? haha... 2)the liked: haha this i've experienced alot too.. haha... no lar... but a few times to my knowing... other times i din noe until like alot later... haha... there have been times when the guy likes me and i like him back (dangerous... seriously been there done that if u dunno wad i'm talking abt 2 words: emotional attachment) of cos it's a ego booster and an honour to be liked... but pls be subtle... tt's the way to start at least... haha... i like the subtle in such things (in case u wanna woo me next time...)... 3)ok mediator... pple if anyone says "oh i help u call lah" pls be wise... and noe tt the person probably has a crush on tt guy too or gal k... haha... yes ive done that too... not the nicest thing ever cos pple end up getting hurt... n u just show urself to be silly and immature... but oh well i haven't done tt since sec 1? so ok... ive matured.. hehe... 4)this is the one rite that gave me perspective into all the rest... this is the more mature one... haha... in a sense... but it's a revelation u have to catch on ur own so this is just for you to think abt and catch ur revelation... don't u realise that not all childhood sweethearts grow up and get married and live happily ever after? notice that usually crushes don't last very long? infactuations u can call them... but u noe wad? i actually don't really like that word... seems very teenagerish and fickle... and sounds worse than the normal crush rite? but basically why sometimes our crushes are so short is because (at least for a few pple i noticed..) we just like qualities in the person... it may be just one or two but when it shines oh it shines haha... yeah n sometimes the qualities outshine the person... so u think u like the person but actually it's just some qualities u like... yup tts all for now... honestly i think crushes are perfectly fine (take it from me haha) but just don't be too quick to work on them n think tt tts the person ur gonna marry or wad k? cos when it's the time u'll noe...

        SIBLINGS    the pple we love and hate within the same second... haha... yep... anyway i was talking to a friend again... and we chanced upon the subject of siblings... n suddenly he said he din wanna talk abt it... which i find rather strange cos i love my brother deeply n i could talk the whole day abt him... never have i loved someone so much (after God of cos) and never have i ever gotten so mad wif anyone... seriously... n i noe the frustrations of having a younger brother or sister... cos i have one too... but i'll never noe the pain of having older siblings... cos i have the luxury of being the older sibling! haha... but really it's a blessing to have a sibling...especially if the sibling is younger... i believe as an older sibling we have such a priviledge n honour to watch our little sib grow up... i've watched mine grow up n mature into a young man... into a man of God who's so talented and charming... someone the girls love despite his taste in fashion... or lack of it... haha... he speaks wisdom and is always full of respect... his future wife is blessed... oh n he's tall dark and handsome... i love him... he used to be short n fat... and a brat... n irritating... u noe why i say being an older sibling is a blessing? we get to see them grow... and we're the ones who get the 1st class view of our sibling's growth... see God work miracles in their lives and transform them from glory to glory... all this helping us to see a more and more real God... and when they've started on this amazing journey wif Jesus, when we need a pat on the back or a shoulder to cry on, they're the closest ones around... God din make siblings to be our enemies... but as pple who we can learn frm, teach stuff to,grow up wif, do things wif when no one else is available... and to love and care for n be loved and cared for by... someone to really see ur very very ugly side... to help train us up as pple... last nite during bs pastor Prince made a very good point (always does)... we as christians are wooden boards covered wif gold... tt we shld love our spouses, siblings, and frenz and even enemies... love our siblings and Let God change them... make them into gorgeous pple... our parts just to love... not to change... so don't get fed up when ur sibling does something stupid... just LOVE... and noe tt God's gonna do the changing...

       Grace- undeserved    Today was a really blessed day… I went out with Lydia, David, Parry and Zhen to watch stuck on you… actually that’s not really my kinda show but oh well it was definitely better than wad I expected… then we met Cliff and Jeremy for a while before we all left… it was really fun… thanks guys… :)  Anyway tts another story… I wanna share sumthing that happened last nite… not the me you would normally see usually… but last nite I was being very very bratty… I was acting like a dumb ass… yeah cos wad happened was that I wanna get the samsung E700A hp… but my dad made a half-hearted promise… and I thot I wasn’t being treated as well as my brother… I mean who wouldn’t feel that way occasionally? So I threw a bit of a tantrum… n then bryan n my mum got in the way and in the end it became a family thing and I was really really mad… and of course I got scolded… the reason I’m so used to asking is because I’m used to asking God for things and I forgot that my parents aren’t exactly God… and although I feel I could get more things, I saw really how childish I was being… that was when everyone had gone to bed and (here’s the part tt’s the thing) when I opened my bible…  I flipped it open and the page fell on psalm 145… it was really God… and because I’ve read the verse before and highlighted it my eyes were automatically drawn to it… between vs 8-20, 3 times it appeared that God is rich in love ( I checked the Hebrew for this and it means unfailing love AND devotion), and that He loves all the things that He has made. Which is basically all of us! And I read twice that He satisfies/fulfills the desires of our hearts! I know that God knows that I love that fone a lot… and I believe that although I’ve got enough money to get one He’s gonna get one for me without me having to spend a single cent… and I knew… 1stly I knew I actually deserved to get scolded… and punished… but God in all His mercy and grace (oh I love this phrase)… instead of punishing me as I deserved, held me in His arms and told me that He loved me… this is the undeserved grace and favour I received… secondly Daddy also promised that He satisfies my desires… talk about the “and much more”… this is truly undeserved and I’ve never felt this grace so strongly before… and because of this, I actually felt apologetic and apologized to my parents and brother… tt’s wad God’s grace does… instead of making us feel like taking advantage, it makes us do the right thing… and I have no regrets… because I apologized, I’m on good terms with my family again… tt’s God… I love Him… this is just my testimony… I hope you’ll never have to go thru the pain of the situation I went thru yet be able to catch this revelation of His love amen? Be blessed :)

       No Confidence in the flesh    Hehe my revelation from the Smith Wigglesworth Devotional. YES! I just bought myself a copy with the 50 bucks I found in my room (I’ve found 200 b4 haha yup very very blessed financially without working for it). It is fantastic. Very simply put and easy to understand yet full of power. Yesterday I got my O level results. I got 14 not the 6 that I was confessing for… kinda disappointed but I’m starting to feel satisfied. After all it’s the 1st time I’ve done so well… haha… seriously… if u ever thot I was like top class student you’re totally wrong. I’m actually not much of the studying kind and my results have never been that great except for a few exceptions where I totally grasped whatever I was doing and suddenly by God’s grace my grades shot sky-high… well out of this I learnt a lot and I believe it’s worth sharing.   I gotta say I improved for my sciences by two grades, my eng n math constant… but it’s the humanities that is the thing I wanna share about. I’m not much of a humans person I prefer math. And obviously I don’t usually do that well for them… but this time I really expected to do well for hist/ss combined humans. Why? When I was studying the night before the two papers, I hit spot on the topics. For both history and social studies, I studied only three topics fully each and these six topics were the structured essay questions… those that I didn’t study didn’t come out. The other humans subject I do is pure geog. This has always been a horrible subject. Since sec 3 I never once did well in fact it was mostly failing and when I passed it was very minimal… but I studied anyway. REALISE I STUDIED. Didn’t have a good time but I still did. So obviously if you were me you would be banging more on hist/ss than geog rite? Yup tt’s wad happened to me. I thot there was no hope for my geog and more hope for my hist/ss but guess wad? I got a C5 for combined humans. But an A2 for geog! I wasn’t even expecting above a B4 for my geog k… Imagine my shock. I was really shocked. Even my mum was. My worst subject became one of my best. The subject I was banging on became my worst subject. Firstly I have to say again glory to God… I wouldn’t have been able to get an A2 without Him…   But the point I want to make is that I was very focused on my combined humans. I didn’t even give one thought to my geog. Because my focus in the case of my combined humans was on “sure can do well because I hit the topics self effort” thinking… I thought I was trusting God for it for the extra grace for the A1. but I was actually focused on doing well for it BECAUSE I studied the right topics. Secondly, realise God can work only when we let go. I didn’t even consider my geog yet God gave me an A2. Get it? I can’t really explain it but I hope you catch this revelation. And this doesn’t mean you don’t study UNDERSTAND? I STUDIED! I studied for geog in fact a lot. But because I put no confidence in my paper God’s grace was able to shine thru. I hope you guys never make the same mistake as me… It was rather costly.   Just wanna say that if you ever are unable to have the God-like faith to believe for good results, just know that God is faithful and can give you better than if you try on your own. And totally don’t think about the paper anymore cos worry restricts God’s blessings and secondly, when your focus is wrong you don’t get what you really want. Focus on the ONE who can give you what you want and that’s JESUS.   Be blessed!

       STAND FIRM AGAINST THE devil...    Helloo... yup i had a super revelation today something rite i believe when u read and catch ur own revelation it'll bring not only power over the evil one it'll bring peace n greater love for God... it was a revelation i caught today at the same time i read in the smith wigglesworth book jerliang bought for me. Smith wigglesworth said u noe to stand fast against the devil and just tell him to get out cos he has no right in ur body or ur mind..   k which leads me to this. today a gd bro called me and told me that a friend whom i treasure sounded suicidal on his blog. lemme give u abit of history. this friend has always had (had amen)a problem in terms of friends. He would tell me that no one wants to talk to him. and that no one wanted to be his friend. i made a huge mistake which i noe in Jesus name i won't make again. i let him wallow in his self pity and just gave him ways to start conversations. true not everyone has alot of favour and i saw that more. i saw his good and neglected the sad part. the good: nice guy, tries hard. the bad: constantly being attacked by the devil about having frenz. always entertaining thots about "i have no frenz. no one likes me". realise it's not the person who's bad but the devil who attacks. the only role u play in the bad is entertaining wad the devil tells u. WHICH ARE LIES UNDERSTAND? honestly i dun blame myself but i intend to learn from this. it really makes a whole of a difference to the person. the time he can spend wif Jesus living victorious quality life and for ourselves too. this is wad i did. i saw the good and asked him to try to make frenz cos unless u try u'll never get any frenz. faith w/o works is dead amen?   but i neglected the devil part which is the part we ought to kick out STRAIGHTAWAY. NEVER entertain his thots.. they're no good for u. they'll just make u sink deeper into depths of despair. If i get to talk to this friend (who used to be my brother but now has kind of stopped talking to me cos of the idiot devil who noes that when i do, Daddy's gonna use me to kick the devil's butt), this is what I am going to say. devil GET OUT! you have no right in this life in this body because his life has been sanctified and set apart for the Lord. The blood that Jesus bled on the cross covers this person's life. whatever way u came in you better leave IN THE NAME OF JESUS! no use playing with a trampled enemy. an enemy whose head has been crushed first by Jesus then by all of us who accept Christ as our Lord and Saviour. NEVER for one moment think the devil is a big guy. he's tiny. he's a silly fool for not realising that He's already been defeated. he's not fighting a losing battle. he's fighting a lost battle. we as sons and daughters of the MOST HIGH know that u are the Lord's. His blood covers ur bodies and minds and hearts no one esp the devil can do anything unless u open the door and say oh! come in!   when he comes just tell him to get lost. yeah... that's ur power. over satan... it's finished! we're on the winning team pple... because the battle's won we can rest. yeah? :) be blessed

       By choice    A couple of days ago, a friend asked me whether I was attached. Ok I believe most of you my frenz noe that I’m not and I’ve never been. AND I’m extremely happy being sassy, single and satisfied. Haha… anyway, it kind of brought me to this topic of By Choice. The reason why I’ve never been attached especially since sec 2 onwards was BY CHOICE (b4 that it was because of my mother’s wisdom in Christ n she forbade me to have a boyfriend which I am eternally grateful for. Sidetrack for awhile: the good thing about parents not allowing you to start dating young is that you don’t become emotionally unstable). Why in the world wouldn’t I want a bf? The thought of having a bf has been attractive before I admit. But I purposely don’t wanna have one because at a young age it causes unnecessary problems and situations we don’t have to go through. So it is BY CHOICE.   Btw if you haven’t realized this isn’t a topic about not having a bf it’s about choosing. God made us and gave us freewill therefore most of the things that we go through in life we can choose to lead to whatever outcome. There are times when we have to choose like which course you want to take. But there are certain times where the choice is a subconscious thing. True it’s God who places the desires in our hearts. But whether you want to follow your heart or do your own thing is really BY CHOICE. No one can stop you from making decisions you want to. But influence is another matter. You must come to realise that it’s you who makes the decisions (ok so last time your parents made certain decisions for you but that was when you were a child DIFFERENT). Many people succumb to peer pressure, which is under influence. It can be for anything you know. But did you ever realise that ultimately it’s YOUR CHOICE? They can influence but they can’t decide. So let’s be people who are independent and when we do things we do it by? Yes BY CHOICE.   For me, I strongly believe in having Daddy make decisions for me because I want to be Christ dependent. So this is my choice. To let Daddy take control of everything in my life. Cos you can be rest assured that He’ll make the best choices for you always. He wrote your book. God’s big sometimes you won’t only get one choice see so these are times where it’s really YOUR CHOICE. That’s our Daddy: unselfish, and letting us make our own decisions.

       Just call me princess.   Today as I was staring out the window of my new house at the construction workers in the next house, I was reminded of two occasions.  On Saturday, the furniture movers helped us shift our furniture (duh) from our old house to our new house. I have to say that there was one particular guy that was super good looking! Haha yeah and had really funky hair. K but that’s not the point. Anyway there were about 7 to 8 movers. They carried boxes into the house endlessly and my dad just stood at the door and told them where to bring them. I stood on the second floor and told them which room to put them in. At the end, they asked my dad to check the lorries to make sure that all the things were taken out so that if we were missing anything, they weren’t the ones to blame. But at the same time my dad had to write a check to pay them. With too many things to do, suddenly he turned to me and said, “Charis, you go check the lorries.” I didn’t want to. After all, all the movers were older than me. They stared at me thinking what a joke this was. But I still checked and everything was fine.  A few days before this, my mum left me at this home to keep an eye on the curtain fixer and to wait for the bed guys and laundry hanger guy to deliver the goods and sign the receipt and give them the check respectively. Suddenly, I found myself with too many things to watch out for. On the first floor, the laundry team was fixing in the thing and the contractor n his men wanting to do the garden lights. On the 2nd, the curtain maker and some guys trying to fix the floor in my brother’s room and the bed guys setting up the bed on the 3rd floor. It was no joke k being the only girl in the house and trying to make sure everything was as my parents wanted. I had to contact my parents or make the decisions on my own then pass it on to them to finish. The interesting part was not being the only girl but being the youngest person in the house and everyone else having to listen 2 MY decisions. It was fun haha.  These two things just reminded me of our relationship with God and us. I’m my daddy’s daughter and no matter what these men said or even if they didn’t like listening to a much younger girl tell them what to do, they had to do what I told them because if not they would get into trouble. The movers actually stared at me like “what the!?!”. But they still had to let me do the checking because my dad was THE boss. Our God’s also the boss. And although I love my daddy, God’s a bigger boss and all. Whatever he says gets done. His will is their command. As a child of God, whatever we say has to be done. And the movers just got tips, I get money as and when I ask for it- the difference between being the child and not. No matter how young the son of the king is, he’s still the prince rite? And even if I ran away from home and did stupid things, I know that my dad would be very hurt, but he would still love me and let me come home. If I need anything I know my dad can provide. How much more God? He’s perfect. Better than my dad in every way. I’m blessed to have an earthly daddy who loves me and knows God love and has an intimate relationship with God. But even if your father isn’t like that, you can take heart that you have another Daddy up there watching you. Even when we do really hurtful things, He’ll never stop loving us and his arms are always wide open to us. When we need anything or even want, God can definitely give me. Like perfect health, even a doctor can’t give you that but your Daddy who is Lord of the universe, king of kings, can. We are children of the KING. How we can ask for things and command things to be done (not bossing other people around cos they after all are also His children but like the devil etc). And we don’t just get tips, we get the amount we want. Even if other people stare at you thinking that you’re not smart enough or too young, you’re His child, you’re the one who can run and jump into his lap as and when you want, and if God says it, what they think doesn’t matter at all.

       The call   A few months ago, Zuming kor kor asked me to consider joining the stewards to take care of the sec 1s in teenzeal. No way! I thought.  Firstly, I have to say that in the beginning of sec 4 til about November, I didn’t really like p6s and the sec 1s (ok the girls). Those that I knew I pretty much liked but I didn’t really bother getting to know them unless they wanted to get to know me. I thought they were silly children who thought they were very mature but actually aren’t. Guys weren’t so bad because they were really still very childish. No offence to anyone k. Basically I had a problem with the younger people.  Then around camp, I didn’t realise this at that time but I started liking them. I started having patience with them especially the boys cos they are really very cute haha. But talking to the girls was still beyond me and it was hard especially if you already had this mindset against them.  So when Zuming kor kor asked me to consider, obviously I didn’t. I didn’t want to go. I knew that the people I would be working with weren’t the guys but had to be the girls because they didn’t have enough girl stewards. And I would have to leave my beloved LINK and all my good friends and have less time working with them. I’d have to start all over again. But suddenly as well, a lot of people started telling me to consider the stewards. They started seeing things I couldn’t. They saw how the younger ones “gravitated” around me. They saw how much favour I had with them. I knew I was favoured but to me it wasn’t a big deal. But one day, I decided I really had to seek God about it so I set aside one whole week completely devoted to seeking God on whether I should move to the stewards (I’m not in school because I’m waiting for the poly to start. 6 months of holiday! Woo!). The more time I spent in God’s presence, the more the desire came to join the stewards. As I was talking to Denise and Lydia, my two very good friends, on two separate occasions, I just would suddenly start sharing with them what I wanted to do in the stewards even though I wasn’t there yet. My desire was to watch these young people whom God loved so much grow up into fine men and women of God. To guide them and let them be accountable to me so that they wouldn’t make the same mistakes as I did. To lead them to Daddy and just love them. There were really a lot of things I suddenly wanted to do. So because no matter how much I tried to shrug the feeling, I knew it was my call. The giftings (favour, grace, patience and especially love) were already there. After that the desire just came. See God always makes sure if it’s your call, the giftings will come and as you delight yourself in Him, He will give you the desires of your heart. Then everything started falling into place, Laoda called me aside one day and told me that he had decided to move me to the stewards!  So on Sunday was my 1st unofficial day at the stewards. Sadly I learnt that this batch of sec 1s was graduating. I did get to know them fortunately. And I introduced myself too. Then they had some free time just to talk to each other then Charissa came back and gave me a bit of advice about these girls. The reason the girls and the guys are separated is because the guys are too childish; they won’t sit next to the girls. The girls are too “mature” they don’t want to play games. Anyway she told me to give the girls some time to warm up to me because they were more independent and weren’t so forward to trust people. After she briefed me, some of the girls just started asking me questions about me without me even asking them anything! And the one sitting next to me told me, “I’m glad you’re here. When you’re not here, it’s very boring but today was fun.” I was totally stunned. And I knew that it was surely God. They’re still abit shy but I believe soon they’ll let me learn to love them as younger sisters.  From someone who didn’t like them to someone who could love them, it was definitely the work of God. In your case it may not be working with younger youths but maybe a job or anything. If it’s your call, surely the giftings will follow and everything that touches your path will definitely fall into place. It’s really just letting God. I haven’t officially started but I’m really excited. Thank you Lord!

       Man’s disappointment, God’s appointment    The posting results just came out on Saturday. I don’t think everyone was that happy about where they got posted. This year, AC and SA were especially hard to get into and I think maybe NJC as well (it’s all those market spoilers as Shawn calls them who are pple who got 6 points and are going to these schools and making it harder for 13 and 14 pointers to get in. But I have to say well done to these “market spoilers” because I’m sure you guys worked really hard to get where you wanted). I’m going to Singapore Poly, btw, gonna do interior design which was my second choice. Anyway most of my friends didn’t get into their first two to three choices. A pal was really disappointed.   Sometimes what we want to happen doesn’t happen. In fact sometimes, the opposite happens instead. I was just sharing with a friend today. The most important thing to realise that what may be considered the best in the world may not necessarily be the best thing for you. They just bring out whatever’s in your heart. Like a million dollars could bring out the bad side or the good in a person (you don’t need me to tell you what a million dollars could be used for). Sometimes what we want to happen doesn’t match what God has planned for you. Even in the bible, Jesus said in the garden of Gethsemane, “… yet not my will, but yours be done.” (Luke 22:42). To me I believe that though Father and Son are one, their wills were different. Jesus was so stressed that He perspired blood. He even said, “if this cup could be taken away from me.” But He followed God’s will and hung on the tree for us. The result: you and I can be sin-conscious free now. Our sins are forgiven and forgotten and all we have to do is to receive Christ and heaven is our home eternally. Matthew 20 gives a really good example of what goes on between God and us. It’s about a vineyard owner who went out to hire people to work for him. The first batch of men bargained with the vineyard owner and settled on being paid a denarius for a full day’s work. A denarius is a full day’s pay basically. Then the owner went out during the 3rd, 6th, 9th and 11th hour and hired more men telling them he would pay them WHAT EVER IS RIGHT. Firstly, these men agreed to work without even knowing how much they were going to get paid. They went by faith (there isn’t another word to describe it). So the time came where all of them were going to get paid. Let’s just focus on the first and last batch. Realise: the last batch of people who were hired worked for only one hour. They were paid one denarius. So were the first batch of people who worked a full day. Again one denarius is a full day’s pay for one hour’s work! That’s our God. Maybe at times the 11th hr people thought they were going to get paid with bottles of wine or an hour’s wages (which is a pathetic $5/hr for us now haha) but in the end they got a full day’s wages. What we want in life could probably be incomparable to what God wants to give us. He’ll never give us less.   This isn’t the easiest thing to grasp. Even I’m still trying to understand this simple statement and the power it’ll bring. I also had another revelation today as I was taking the bus and pondering on this. There are times where we really get something we really don’t want right? And for the rest of the time while we are in that something, we keep harping and wishing we got what we wanted. What if we just appreciated what we had? We would really be having quality life! It’s just about enjoying what we have to the max. And having a spirit of Excellence in everything we do causes things to turn out better. I mean just think! Gets exciting right? I got excited thinking about it. Oh well haha… yeah… Be blessed

       Purity.   No it’s not someone’s name although it sounds like. Haha. I believe that all of you some way of another know what it is. None of you are THAT innocent. During the men and women’s meeting, Pastor, Laoda and their wives gave talks about the topic about sex, dating etc. On Sunday, I went to the library and saw a book in the Christianity book section called And the Bride wore White about keeping ourselves pure (actually it’s more for girls). When I picked it up, I thought hey I’m not having a problem about keeping myself chaste and I wasn’t actually going to borrow it. But God kept pulling me back to the book (I’ve finished reading it FANTASTIC). I believe there is something God’s trying to teach me. Because this morning as I was reading the newspapers, I was shocked to read that the amount of teenagers IN SINGAPORE was indulging in sexual immorality. What shocked me the most was a boy who’s now only 11 going on 12 had been in sexual relationships since he was 9! Social issues like that and even the baby thing going on now are issues that I’m really interested in. Not because I have some sick fantasy but because it makes me want to see Jesus in all this. I have a passion for people to live Godly lives and I completely hate it when people just waste away what God has given them. Especially if they say they’re Christians. No I’m not condemning you if you’re living like that, I just don’t understand why. Even now I can’t imagine why I wasted the past few years before I got serious about God, what was I doing? Anyway, I was doing my QT just an hour ago (throughout the day I was having a hard time picking up my bible so when I read what I read I KNEW that God was trying to show me something and the devil was trying to stop me), and I read the John 17 which is Jesus saying a prayer for his disciples and for future believers like you and me. I came to the part where Jesus says, “sanctify them”. My bible (hallelujah!) had a side note which says in Greek the word is “hagiazo” which means set apart for SACRED use or make holy. It was then I realized what God was trying to tell me. This may be a long entry but stick with me as I unfold this.   Firstly I have to say that it may seem weird for me to be talking about this but I believe that if Paul spoke strongly against sexual immorality in the bible, surely God despises it. I may be only 17 but this is exactly the time when most people fall into traps. Secondly, God created sex. It isn’t a dirty word. It’s a pure and holy covenant between a man and his wife and God to unite them and make them one. But He despises sexual immorality. Honestly, because I’ve never placed myself in any position where I could be tempted to doing anything physical, I’ve never had that kind of temptation. But I used to read and love reading love novels. Really, if you are, try to stop because you and I know that it isn’t good for us. I used to think wow what a nice love story and fantasize about me being the rebellious girl and my man being a rugged man who oozed charm. At first we would argue and all because he thought, no, expected girls to be submissive and all the silly girlie girls loved him because he was so charming and he could pick anyone he wanted. Then one day we would be trapped together or something and we would fall in love and elope and live happily ever after. That was my fantasy. Haha of course I’m never going to elope because I want to marry in a nice big church with family and friends but sounds cooler eh? Haha… For girls (guys too I think), it’s so fun fantasizing and all. But the negative side about reading such books was that it sparked off some kind of unhealthy desire and something not so pure if you know what I mean. Of course I’ve stopped already (being very real k just last June because of the os).   Well I want to say that God has made us humans with feelings of love etc. And they can be really special but never ever take it further than you can handle. Because before you know it, you may be doing something you actually told yourself you wouldn’t do in a million years. I believe we’ve had many talks about these kinds of things in school, in teenzeal, parents etc. You probably know all the ways to avoid these things. But as I say in my last entry, everything we do is by choice. No one can stop you from doing things if you want to. You may feel oh I’m doing this because my parents want me to. This is where I want to help you see differently. Why shouldn’t I have a boyfriend? Why should I keep myself pure? Why should I do this or do that? It really has to be a personal revelation and I hope you see this before you try anything. Let’s start thinking about our future spouse (I’m assuming some of you my guy friends are reading this haha). On your wedding day (oh man! I’m sure imagining mine believe me I’ve imagined this a lot), girls in your designer wedding dress (could be the traditional white or another pale colour. mine’s white) and guys in your smart tuxedo standing already at the altar (this is in a church although mine’s gonna be trista n ryan style with more class haha). Imagine yourself walking towards your handsome husband or standing at the altar looking at your beautiful wife walking towards you. What would you rather be feeling? Excited at spending the rest of your life together and knowing that you’ve done your best in saving yourself for this special person? Or to feel regret at knowing there was more you could do? (there is therefore now NO condemnation for those in Christ Jesus but you will feel certain things) Saving ourselves for our special persons is the most amazing gift you could give him/her.   The easiest way to prevent temptation and undesirable things from happening is to not even go near there. If you knew there was a landmine on that spot you wouldn’t purposely go stand there or even near it right? Same thing. My teacher told my friend who told me this. Amazing stuff. Things may start pure and even seem right but you never know how things may be manipulated by the devil. Having a boyfriend isn’t a bad thing. I love guys too haha. But having a boyfriend means commitment, no looking at other guys and again things may happen. So the best would be not to even go there.   I’ve had this great habit (actually it was an idea from my mum. You may find it kootie but most of the women of God who are in very loving marriages did it) where I keep a list of what I want in my future husband from personality to looks even. (Guys don’t roll your eyes. Here’s why it’s good doing it) It sets a standard for guys (or gals) you meet. If you haven’t realized not all the people you meet with you can click with all the way. The guy may be really nice and even love God everything but he may not be the kind of guy you like you know? Like let’s say for me. I like outspoken, charismatic (nothing to do with the name) and charming more than the quiet, shy kind (understand this is about future spouse not friends). So I might meet a really nice but quiet guy so he may not be the one for me. I’ve realized every time I like a guy, I look at my list and sometimes I realise that he’s really not my type. It also makes you more careful. The book I read really said something I fell in love with. How about on your wedding day, taking your list with the words “you fulfill it all” and presenting it to your husband? Cool right? That’s besides the point.  Remember that all of you are God’s precious princes and princesses. You may not feel like it but you are. A princess (I’m a girl too bad guys) behaves knowing that whatever she asks for is hers. She’s her father’s most precious in the whole kingdom. Everything He has is hers. She knows that she doesn’t have to beg, dress scantily to attract attention because all the attention of her royal subjects are hers. Dignity and class is what she carries herself with. This comes with knowing who you are. This is what you are. Take it and live it. Be blessed!

       The Passion Of the Christ review by charis :)   harlow! haven't been coming online for a few days... i heard someone read my blog n got a bit offended... yeah all i gotta say is my dear, i wasnt trying to like purposely fight u back... i wanted u to read it wif an open mind so that u urself wld be blessed n all instead of having to face trouble when it's ur turn... very real..  anyway here i am to talk abt the Passion.. haha yes i watched it... i must say for all the controversy n everything, it was abit of a let down. it's about the last 12 hrs of Christ.  the 6 hrs where Jesus hung on the cross for us.  it's very visual. but when i heard that pple were actually saying that it was too gory i was so shocked! it wasn't even the least bit... k why was i disappointed... hmm i dunno when i watched it, i had finally a visual of what happened on the cross but it wasn't that great because i knew that what Jesus suffered was much worse than what was portrayed in the movie.  when i watched, a tear or two fell but not enough to even fully use a piece of tissue.  oh i had some revelations yes but it didn't satisfy because i knew the real thing was worse. much worse. but it was a good movie i must say.  the thing about this is that if you're a non-believer, u probably won't noe wad it's about and think it's very gory and all; if you're a believer, you'd find this a good show tho not that satisfying especially when ur a believing believer... yeah... but it's a good show i say again..  today when i was reading the newspaper i read how the actor wanted to give up (when he's not done up like Jesus he's really very handsome! that smile! but my Jesus is even more handsome!).  He said that it was tough... haha i guess it would be waking at 2 am everyday. and being struck by lightning twice. and wearing nothing but a piece of loin clothe in temperatures of -1 degrees. but imagine Jesus. how much worse His suffering was. not only REALLY sweating blood. He had to REALLY bear the sins of the world.  all the wrath of God was poured upon Him so that there would be no more barrier between us and God.  see the real stress of it all.  the actor's suffering was nothing compared to the real thing but yes this shows us too that no one can ever be Jesus. no one can take His place. and because It is Finished, no one ever will have to ever. except to film such shows. haha... yes. it wasn't the show itself that made me see the wonders of the cross but all these small bits of things outside the show. i pray u see them too. :) be blessed

       what's right may be wrong   today i was hanging out with two of my bestest best gal pals... i really love them alot alot... anyway... we were talking about the leadership and everything. one of them was going thru some problems with her good frenz being unable to show her the respect she deserved as a youth leader. i've been in both positions before. as an angry youth who felt like she was being oppressed by her leaders and now i'm a youth leader myself tho i haven't had any form of hate fired at me (thank you Lord).  leaders aren't always right. tt's the first thing i wanna say.  there are times we make mistakes. but leaders are also chosen by the Lord to do things and to serve.  when i was a youth, there were some leaders i didn't like and i thought that they shouldn't even be serving but i was wrong. not because they were good leaders but because i was thinking that i was better than God. that my decisions were better than His. n i was being snobbish.  there was once when i nearly shouted at a leader because he was unreasonable.  it's not easy being a youth sometimes. never was. but just know that when ur respecting the leader God has placed b4 u, you're respecting the leaders that you love and God.  i chose not to shout at that leader because there were others that i loved alot.  even when we're right, when we don't respect our leaders we become wrong. like what tchr elizabeth said, "i'd rather be wrong yet respecting my leader, then be right and cause a rebellion." especially when you want so much a position that they hold, respecting your leader is much more worth it, trust me i know.  there have been times when i've felt like speaking my mind n telling a leader what he's doing wrong but somehow my spirit held me back and i realised why.  it's because God doesn't need me to correct the leader. God can do it Himself and much better than us.  correcting your leader is again like thinking you're greater than God, that you know what to do better than Him.  Let our leaders be taught by the Lord Himself.  I sure wanna be taught by the Lord Himself rather than be corrected by a youth myself.  now from a viewpoint of a leader, i've not been one that long but i've alrdy known what i've wanted to do in this ministry if i stayed back and that was to love the youths.  it's true that we're not always right. we're humans too. if not we might as well not be serving.  if we were perfect, we'd have nothing to share with you, nothing for you to learn from and we'd be unable to empathise with anything you were going thru.  i don't have much to say from a leader's viewpoint.  because they are rather interlinked. my last statement for the nite : Honour your leaders (realise this includes parents), and God will surely honour you much more. i've seen it in my life.  He surely will.  Be blessed!

       Daddy's girl   :) today i went for campus. its really a great min to go to. they're all very anointed. as we were getting ready for praise n worship, actually i was thinking how few frenz i've made in campus... that maybe if i was like a special someone's daughter, everyone would noe me (hey even women of God go thru stuff like that ya...). not exactly these thoughts but real close. n suddenly i heard sumthing within me say "but u are a special someone's daughter" n i realised yes i was... i'm Daddy's girl... n suddenly i had this peace. the amazing thing is that Dcn Chin also spoke on being heirs of God... children of the most high.. talk about same flow... wow... haha... yes..  sometimes we have the tendency to forget that we are Daddy's children... n we behave as if we aren't princes n princesses in our own right. it's our blood bought right. it's amazing how fast my attitude changed today. once i heard that something, i immediately had a brand new confidence.. that i wasn't afraid that i didn't know anyone anymore. afterall everyone knows that i'm Daddy's girl. even if they didn't know know me, they knew whose i was. not who i was but whose. that's more important. knowing that God dearly loves us and that we belong to Him makes a world of difference. never have to be self conscious anymore. we can be ourselves. that's really freedom. freedom from peer pressure in a sense.. yup... i guess this is a short one haha... yeah... today there's tzt!!! yay!!! haha... yup... be blessed

       what? me? unromantic?   haha... i juz took some tickle tests... for fun of cos... they really tickle u noe... haha... i was practically rolling all over when i read that i was gonna get married in less than 3 yrs in the wedding predictor! haha... i'll not even be 20 yet. but praise God it's because i'm emotionally stable n all that tt's wad they say... haha.. n the other test on how romantic u are says i'm not romantic at all... ya rite... haha... shows that these tests aren't exactly accurate but they are quite fun...  ok maybe i'm not romantic in the worldly sense where they do crazy things. some of the questions listed were like totally out of the question n i would never do. too degrading. tt's why maybe i'm not considered a romantic. but the thing is romance doesn't mean stupidity n crazy living. in fact romance is one of the most beautiful things in the world! wif Jesus especially.. but i think i'm pretty romantic. haha.. if i say so myself. because romance isn't as the world sees it. romance is loving Jesus with the full knowledge that He loves us too. romance in our own human way should be about loving our future partner and things that make the two fall in love with each other all over again daily. yet not in ways where things are done to make us less than we are (because afterall we ARE in Jesus). :) Let Him romance u... amen be blessed

       Sassy, Single n Satisfied   not being cocky or anything but this really describes me rite now! haha.. i've been listening to pastor's tapes about choosing the right life partner. when i first started, my mum got a bit freaked cos she thought that i was thinking about choosing my life partner alrdy haha. but really somehow i think this 4tape series is the thing teenage girls should be listening to. really! it made me especially happy being single. why? because it's made me set my standard higher on choosing a future partner and knowing that Jesus will provide when the time comes.  i used 2 be the kind of person who had tons of crushes. but never had a bf because i never allowed myself to have one because i insist on giving my future husband the best in me (that blessed man!). but being the romantic that i am. crushes came about naturally. i especially like guys who are suave (okok i like john stevens quite geeky but he rocks! yes lydia!.... hmm...) n do nice things for me so it was fast. even recently i've had crushes. but as i continued to grow in the Lord, things started to change. not because i was faithful in doing my QT etc but because He is faithful.  being sassy single and satisfied is coming to the place where Jesus is no. 1. where knowing that He loves us is enough. not that i've become anti male! no way! i still wanna get married but i've come to learn that Daddy will provide. no such thing as the perfect choice but there is a very good choice out there. focusing my eyes on guys won't make me anyone. focusing my eyes on Jesus makes me a success. makes me more attractive and all. afterall like what pastor said, "marriage is not two halves coming together to become one whole but two wholes joining together held by God."  i juz wanna say that this feeling of being me is lovely and extremely satisfying. it's brought alot of security and just amazing joy. i pray that all of u will come to enjoy this feeling soon. He's the man! amen! haha.. :)

       platonic friends   hmm... was watching the channel 8 show beautiful trio (actually i watch because of the cute guy and gal).. n the cute guy likes the girl but she doesn't like him back. n the sad thing was that they were good friends. so the thing is is there such a thing as platonic friends?  honestly? i'm a firm believer of platonic friendships. the only thing is that most friendships between a guy n a girl will probably turn out to have some kinda romance. could be one sided or mutual. and it usually happens. usually. but then again i have certain guy friends who are really platonic friends. and i've kinda learned the secret for it. doesn't work on everyone tho. bcos before i start, i must mention that God created man n woman to be attracted to one another. but it is possible to have platonic friendships i strongly believe. i have a couple of platonic guy friends. the simplest way to keeping them as platonic friends is to not talk too late at night. night time's the worst because it's when u feel tired and become vulnerable.  and the thing about this is that it's extremely easy to become emotionally attached. another way to prevent this is to talk less to the person. haha... the easiest thing to do is to ask for God's grace. there was a guy friend i hadn't talked to for ages and i wanted to check up on him see how he was doing. but the thing was i had a softspot for him and i didn't want to have a crush on him again. so i asked God what i shld do and i kept hearing over n over again that i shld sms him only when i got over my feelings. knowing me it's not easy. so i told God that i couldn't and praise God he saw me thru. when i felt ok now i should sms, when the guy replied i had no feeling at all except all that is within friends range. not even close to the line of softspot again.. really by God's grace. but when i told lydia she nearly slaughtered me. true it wasn't the safest thing to do but oh well! God was good anyway. He is good.  there is such thing as platonic friendships but i've realised they happen more often than not when u focus your eyes on Jesus and when you mature.  n when the time comes u'll noe. got alot of things i wanna say but i can't put them in words so maybe one day i'll edit this one again  be blessed!

       too self-righteous   tonite i was yet again watching america's next top model. and there are 4 left :shannon (woohoo! pretty), adrienne, elyse n robin... n robin got kicked out! YES!  but she's my topic for tonite. i was reading today's newspapers with an interview with adrienne n she said tt she thinks robin has a few demons on her own. haha... honestly i don't like robin. not because she's big but because she's too religious! i love my Jesus alot. robin actually makes me cringe everytime she talks about "my religion" n i actually thot once, "man, i don't wanna be a christian! then suddenly eh! i am a christian!" haha.. now i noe wad turns pple off being a christian.  but the thing is being christian and being religious are two totally different extremes. being religious is being under law. being christian is being under grace. robin gave pple a really bad impression of christians which i totally can't stand. when we say we're living for Jesus, true there are certain things we won't do for the sake of our integrity n all but it doesn't mean shoving our relationship (christianity isn't a religion it's a relationship with God) at others even if it's true that they won't be going to heaven. no one will want to receive Christ that way. there have been things that i've done that shocked everyone in my sch and it's besides the fact that i'm a prefect. i dyed my hair (after i graduated frm mg k) n this religious girl in my class was like but u cant! ur a christian! there's no where that says that in the bible. anyway, i think the way we act as christians really make a difference in the world. i've heard so much how pple don't wanna become christians yet nothing about pple not wanting to become other religion followers. obviously the devils trying to stop us. the way we behave makes a difference yet it's really the "self-righteousness" n law stuff that actually stifles pple n stops them frm wanting to be christians.  pple are going to put u on the spot like "oh but ur a christian" it's time to change their views about us! let's live the Jesus life! the abundant life! where our focus is Jesus cos tt's when everything else will be added on. let pple not "oh but ur a christian" us anymore. but when they see us they want to join us. yet don't worry about converting everyone. focus more on Jesus cos tt's when things will happen.  juz to encourage abit i had this classmate whose mum was rather against Christianity and alot of my classmates kept asking her to go to church but she would always make up some excuse.  then she became a really good friend of mine n i didn't even bother asking her to go to church. bcos her bro knows kev, so one day she was talking about us and her mum asked how did i noe kev n which church we were from. n i juz shared as and when i felt like i could.  and during the exams i told her not to worry and everything. then i didn't see her for awhile but the next time i saw her, she told me that she actually went to church with her mum! her cuz brought her. see it wasn't me. it's definitely Jesus. He used me and others along the way and finally she went. the day's gonna come when she herself has a full revelation of Christ n wants Him. so don't force. Just follow His flow ya?

       flying without winnnngsss!!   aha... sorry lame... guess wad i did this morning! i flew a simulated plane... haha... cos the Pilot's association sumthing sumthing's having this charity drive to help the children's fund aimed rather towards companies cos they wanted big sums. if u donate some amount you could go n fly a simulated plane with an instructor n all. flying simulated is actually as real as flying a real plane cos these are the things that the pilots use for like their "tests" n to practice rough weather conditions etc. and the whole simulator is built like the actual cockpit.  blessed me got to go first... woo!! my instructor this guy called Mr. Liu helped me quite alot... in fact i basically navigated the plane... yay!! n he said i was excellent! haha... ya... he wants to take me n bryan as students... so maybe i juz might go join the youth flying club... woohoo!! it was really really fun... praise God... n channelnewasia came n actually interviewed us... some of the camera pple (who are actually the pilots) were taking lotsa photos too. but i think i was really really happy when one of the people who came to ask us how we found the flying said we had nice accents. Praise God... oh well :) so so happy... tata

       a little bird, my goal n BS   oh well... three things tt have made me happy, sad n extremely happy... :) haha ya.. ok rubbish the second one. well well u noe i've kinda moved hse now n there's this little bird moved hse wif me (yes i'm talking about the kind with a beak n wings). it's green. n small i dunno wad kind of bird it is tho. anyway, at my old hse, there was one the same breed as this but i'm not sure if it's the same one. that one used 2 fly into my house through the living room daily. then after awhile it started visiting my window at about 8am every morn and chirp at the window cos i slept with the windows open to let in the real cool breeze. it's lovely waking up to the sound of nature n everything. tt's the thing i miss about my old home: sleeping without aircon and not feeling hot at all. anyway, now at my new house this little feller built it's nest outside my window... so since i'm rather attached to it i wanna name it. was thinking wigglesworth cos when it crawls into it's nest it wiggles it's tail. n after man of God wigglesworth. but then again i wanted 2 name him john. after (*ahem*) john stevens (woo!!), n since it's outside my toilet... or sumthing to do with the birds of the air verse. but oh well. gotta give it some thot. was gonna name it envy but my mum doesn't like it haha. so...  n i think i've gained weight! noo... actually it may not be cos the weighing scale's still the same. but i think the fat left where it was supposed 2 be n went to places where it shouldn't be! oh well after 4 mths of slacking around... so after last night's bs i am going to make jogging (the grossiest thing in the world) a goal. oh man... darn! ok i can't complain i've got my whole neighbourhood to jog around without being spotted if i go at the right time haha. ya my mum insists that i go cos i laze around too much. so monday i'm going. in Jesus name it'll be good amen!  LAST NITE'S BS WAS FANTASTIC!!!! this guy called Peter Daniels spoke. he's 72 and doesn't look a day older than 60! man.. he's this rich man who started poor. he had a call to become a end time financier n he came to share but the basic thing about his sharing last nite (seminar like rather) was to dare to dream big! he got 4 pple on stage n to list 3 very materialistic things that they wanted. n suddenly i realised (i'm sure everyone else did too) that listing 3 materialistic things were so difficult! to say we really want them. at first i was really shocked but after awhile it was like "yeah! wow! i really can ask God for anything!" really u noe. God needs end time people who are willing to dream  BIG  and live for him, Peter Daniels stressed. and it's so true! suddenly i'm not afraid to dream BIG n know that God will give me the ability to carry it to the natural.  suddenly abundant life is so much more than i ever expected! it's more than just divine health and all that. it's divine health to a very high level. pastor Joshua also said that when u think that ur life is going fine and u don't need restoration, it's a lie. the devil has taken away so much. GOd will restore much much more! 7 times more. so even if nothing's missing in your life just claim! take it anyway. i couldn't figure out how the two linked last nite when i got home but tonite i realise that the link is that when u begin to dream BIG and live out your dreams, the life u live will be taken to a much higher level of abundance!  another thing is that Mr. Daniels was using material stuff as an example. i've seen so many poor Christian men make it rich so i have no doubt that God will give material(sometimes when He doesn't give it may be for your good). imagine how much God will give us physical healing, health, emotional stability and spiritual acceleration! these things are far more important and He will surely give.  How much do we wanna receive? i can't say i noe everything. i'm still learning to trust God with all my heart. trust Him completely. but this has really done wonders to my walk with Jesus. i hope it does to yours too :) be blessed!

FESTIVAL OF PRAISE  did u guys feel the presense of God there? so strong! the whole night was fantastic.. i got so much time 2 catch up wif frenz and everything.. and the praise n worship! hillsongs led. one thing that really taught me something was darlene saying that all glory goes to God. so easy 4 us to just think "oh it was me" but no.. the more we know the glory goes to God the more He gives us. just look at hillsongs! the anointing was so strong that all selfconsciousness left and all i could feel was Jesus. yup. it totally rocked. oh and pastor prince dances real well... haha... he's so farny.. but i really love him bcos of wad he's allowed God to do through him for me in my life. haha... yup :)  well church camp's tmr!! yay! those who couldn't go rem there's next yr.. and God will surely restore much much more... i've missed like 4 camps already.. so i know that this year it's gonna be sooo much better in every aspect. 4(years)x7(restoration)x1000(times more)x2(double portion haha).. woo! those going rem to expect great things that's going 2 happen in ur life. amen! yup.. so i will be back in a week see ya all! :)

       day 2: com class   i got lost.. haha... looking for my class isn't easy esp when all the blocks look the same. anyway. did i say there were no cute guys in my class? ok i've got one.. haha... he's not bad... in fact he looks alot like parry.. so parry take this the way u wanna. haha... n it seems he's quite enthu about doing interior des. seriously i always had this impression tt no one took interior des seriously but seems like he does so cool. i made new frenz again. juliana, vino who can't speak chinese too.. haha.. and delphanie but she can't speak chinese otherwise our other frenz won't get it. good.. praise God! we got to use coms today n all that. the coms are like really cool and the labs are supposed 2 be the best praise God. anyway i also got 2 noe the rest of my class. timothy! ashik's in my class believe it anot! everyone's really nice.. din really talk 2 the guys cos they're like really quiet. but oh well slowly i suppose.. this is fun.. haha... obviously cos i haven't been in a mixed sch since pri 1? ya. but poly's really different. i'm still getting used 2 calling my teacher by his name. wearing my own clothes rocks but like wad cia says i gotta get more.. yes! soon.. and the timing's really weird. like yest was from 1-5 today was like 8.30-4.. got my timetable.. quite good ya noe.. fri's i end at 12! praise God.. and the rest of the days are ok as well. and there are like foodcourts all over the place (pizzahut, macs n kfc? oh yes!) n cheap too. everytime i walked pass another grp of students, i had a thrill cos no one's wearing sch u. haha.. pple here r really nice n to make a group of frenz it can take less than 20 mins. of cos really clicking n stuff takes longer but at least u've got pple to hang out wif. my classrooms are like one kind condusive. wooden floors those really cool kind and the whole lab rocks! it's really different from sch. more relaxed tho im quite sure when it comes down 2 working time everyone will like really pay attention. and praise God my lecturer, luit, says that u can basically call me an interior designer already. too bad brandon u've got to get a professional cert. but i think he's having a good time too.. got a bunch of guy frenz who look like they can be quite fun. oh well! i'll update more soon :) tata!

       School's starting!! woohoo!!   ok i noe everyone isn't exactly sharing the same sentiments as me... but i'm seriously excited 2 go to school! tomorrow is the first day of school for me after 7 n 1/2 months of slacking around.. haha.. wow.. really fast eh..? hmm... stocked up on more tshirts, jeans n jackets (essentials i think. could still do wif more of cos) really really change in clothes taste.. but well it has to be. i think i'm pretty much ready. i'm excited but of cos not w/o the nerves. trusting God for supernatural favour, good frenz, cute guys in my course (for fun n entertainment during boring classes. oh! not himbos please haha), wisdom in all that i do.   in this 7 months i've faced tons of discrimination. 1st from pple who think jc all the way. someone actually asked me if i was going to poly cos i did badly! ha! praise God. well for everyone's info i got 10 pts for poly. so tt should clear the air. from poly pple who find out i was from mgs the qs i get alot is why did u decide 2 come poly? strange isn't it? well i'm here bcos i wanna try something new. i wanna do something i like. i really want 2 wake up every morning and be excited 4 sch. (this doesn't mean if u go jc u can't enjoy urself. it varies from person to person)  i think in alot of ways poly for me is a good thing: 1) i think in a few months time i'll learn 2 be less concern wif wad i wear. imagine everyday waking up and thinking "wad should i wear?" weekends are bad enough. 2) i'll learn 2 make frenz wif different kinds of pple different from all the mgs things and from church. not that i'm racist or class-ist or anything but speaking chinese is like my handicap right now. shining Jesus as well. yeah!  i guess for all those who wanna come to poly based on wad u've been hearing in tzt or anywhere here's a good time to think about it after reading about the stuff i've been through. bcos poly isn't juz about having fun.. it's learning too and sometimes discrimination.. so now muz really think. not saying in jc u won't face anything lah. but worth considering rite? shawn u owe me (glad u've stopped going on about how everyone wants 2 go 2 poly. wadever.)  as for all the O pple.. rem the battles the Lords and the victory urs. speak 2 ur mountain (molehill more like). and study to glorify God.  whats Os? whats exam? hee.. i don't have anymore!! woo!! tata

       CAMP CAMP N CAMP   helloz... ya ok hmm... i've had like 3 camps this hol... ok so one was a day activity... still... 1st was church camp... long time ago... haha... but it was really really blessed... pillow fights all that... but the best was being constantly reminded of the Love of God... and i really received alot of personal revelations.. the fotos are juz the tip of the icebergs... for those who missed it, it's ok next yr we may be having another one... woo!! and there's always tzt camp end of this yr..  second was the pk camp... i love pk! haha... i love the kids. all so precious 2 me.. i really had supernatural favour wif them so much so my table at dinner was almost always crowded n the kids from the other groups also came 2 make frenz wif me... the farniest was when they had this hannah skit (lydia's grp) and the neighbours came 2 make fun of hannah so her husband was supposed 2 say something but this lil p5 guy forgot his lines and said, "it's ok baby" haha... ya... i miss them the way they say "teacher teacher!" the way their eyes light up when they hold something they deem precious. and the way all the voices unite to sing worthy is the lamb! and a song about dedicating their lives to Jesus... super cool... watch out folks these are the future of tzt.. these kids r coming sooooooooon! yay! praise God...   3rd was a Singapore Poly sports activity. it was really fun tho i had a bit of a tough time fitting in. it's my english thing i suppose... everyone in my group were speaking in chinese. and my chinese is the "v good in Jesus name" kind haha.. but the ppl in my group were really nice.. we were called twister. fun man... but i made frenz.. and praise God cos i asked Him for Godly frenz and the first few frenz i made were christians. He really answers prayers.. so i noe my class will have pple who speak more english and will have tons of cute guys and pple in love wif Jesus. some will be all three combined! amen.. haha.. :) oh well ya... grace grace..

       i'm in love!   helloz... still in the midst of my orientation. can i say i've had tons of favour.. seriously praise God. but really enough of me. i'm juz having such a good time. well i juz had this revelation during caregroup n since some of u actually are nice enough 2 read this here goes: the revelation of knowing that u are blessed (because u are) will make the things u want and need in life materialise. but i'm sure everyone noes tt. but it sounds really chim eh? haha.. well... as i've been typing i've juz realised how much i've been learning so far... how much God's word means to me now. How much God means to me because i mean so much 2 Him. i've fallen in love wif someone who has been in love wif me since the beginning of time. yes God. i'm not being lame. but juz as i was thinking about it He doesn't only juz love me He's IN love wif me! oh how much it makes me wanna love him back. (ok this is flowing suddenly i dunno why) pastor says we're like married 2 Mr. Jesus. haha... yeah... tts me. i'm married 2 my Jesus. it's definitely a relationship. i've been lying on my bed lately every nite (i sleep really early now so tt i have energy for sch the next day.. it's amazing how much i really love sch), and b4 i go 2 sleep, i juz talk 2 God.. as in in human language n in tongues. wadever it is He understands. there was one nite i rem i was really bogged down wif some really dumb bimbo stuff and i juz had 2 let it go.. i juz let it go 2 the Lord for like a really long time... i keep on going til i'm drained.. til i have none of me left. then He comes n fill me up wif all of Him. it's our relationship: giving and taking. i give Him my sorrows my cares my fears, He takes them and gives me His peace, wisdom n everything i need in life. and i take. how simple it's become... oh man... Jesus the love of my life. i'm definitely the love of His.. praise God... :)

        Salt in a tasteless world     &nbsp;  hmm.. they changed this font n everything i dunno how 2 use it anymore.. haha.. so this may look different. anyway, tt day i was having a mass chat session wif about 8 pple in my class. and it was pretty ok until one of the guys said, "hey wad would u do if u only had this last day to live?" i immediately replied that i'll enjoy life cos i knew where i was going the next day. another guy said "i'll stay at home". the guy who asked this qs said "i'll go look for the girl that i like and confess that i like her". then the second guy said wad about ur family? the 1st said oh they can follow me go look for the girl. then it shifted on to family and all i remember about that was that suddenly one of the girls said "please lor. my family doesn't even give a damn about my problems" i was like shocked. this is a depressing world we live in. we have alot of fun in class an everywhere but after tt nite's conversation i suddenly realised that they actually weren't that happy pple. in fact in retrospect, i realised that i'm the only one who really really enjoys myself ALL the time! b4 we say oh pathetic pple, remember that without Jesus we'd be just like them. maybe even worse. i'm really starting to see my call for this season as dcn chin was saying. i'm starting to see that wherever we are, where we've been placed is definitely divine appointment from God. even when we're not really enjoying life trust God tt we will. instead of being suprised when something good happens we should be surprised when nothing happens. like if i'm feeling like i'm lacking in favour i always say, "shouldn't i be having more favour in this area? afterall i'm Daddy's girl." and suddenly the favour starts pouring in.&nbsp; don't waste where God has placed you cos thru u He's gonna do alot.    &nbsp;  another thing i realised is that b4 Daddy uses u supernaturally (actually putting where u are is already supernatural), ur frenz have 2 learn to trust u naturally. and i believe for me tt's coming already. watch out devil. the salvation of my family and frenz is coming. and very soon.&nbsp; pple, we have something very special u noe. don't take His love for u for granted. last nite i was juz thinking about all this and another thing and i suddenly realised how undeserving i was. how small, how unworthy. w/o Jesus i'd really be nothing. how blessed we are to be the chosen and called of the Lord's and to be able to be young and used by God. yup :) we're really blessed! (not because of anything but because He loves us so much amen?)    &nbsp;  ps after that the cute guy in my course doesn't matter so much anymore... oh well...

       poly... jc... poly...  &nbsp; well again tonite... seems like suddenly i've got a couple of things i really wanna say. well i've noticed in tzt alot of the sec 4s really wanna come 2 poly. same feeling i had when i was in sec 4. i think many of u have been influenced by leaders with more in poly than jc. well that day, someone was commenting that she didn't want 2 go to jc for the "prestige" and "name". actually tt's a good thing. but if that's the reason then think about this: so ur going 2 poly for the lack of "prestige" and lack of "name"? i really wanna say that every individual is different. i don't believe everyone's coming to poly because of a course they wanna do but more for the sake that it sounds more fun. tt's nonsense. again like wad i said enjoy whatever ur doing. how many times have i had pple who come 2 me and say " i want to go to poly too.." "oh what course?" i ask and the replies have been the same "i don't know". the thing i really can't stand about this is that i think alot of u aren't really considering at all. true when i first thought of going 2 poly it was to be different. lame excuse. but when i put it down as my choice, it was because i really&nbsp;wanted&nbsp;to come to poly to do interior design. i've been interested in it since my barbie doll polly pocket days (in fact the things that attracted me to these toys were the interior architecture things).&nbsp;it's true your success doesn't depend on where you go to, but does that mean u go to a place considered not so good juz to prove your point? seriously. ok jc may be stressful but in poly we have 2 work hard as well. the difference is sch u and tt we're doing subjects that are more defined that's all. oh and u get pple who are like much older in poly. i really don't want all u guys in sec sch who are considering where 2 go 2 juz say you wanna go to poly juz because.&nbsp;(not going 2 start on not being able to make it 2 jc cos all of u can and already have.) pple in jc have alot of fun too. in fact i believe if i went there i would have lotsa fun too. it's not where i go, it's the Jesus in me.&nbsp;jc is a choice as well. why limit yourself to poly only? actually to be honest, i didn't put sp interior design as my first choice. i put sajc. although i was pretty sure i was going 2 poly 2 do what i like.&nbsp;don't limit yourself. to think of going to poly for any other reason besides wanting to do the course is not a good reason. really. but even if you can't find something you like, or you've chosen what you feel to be the wrong, the grace of God is more than sufficient for you. and He will cause all things to work to your good. in your favour. amen. &nbsp; p.s. i'm not trying to discourage u from coming to poly or anything but from the reasons i've been hearing, i think thinking about it and trusting God for yourself is a step all should take b4 juz deciding tt "oh poly is for me!" ya? we're individuals afterall. for those sec 4s thinking where to go trust God. follow the life and peace and you'll surely find the thing you're looking for, or even be surprised that the thing you were looking for was in the least expected place. :) be blessed.

       enjoy your moment!  &nbsp;  hello :) i was actually juz replying a letter to a very precious friend i have and it juz reminded me of everything pple have been saying to me. like when i say how much i've been enjoying poly life, everyone's like "i wish i were u and could enjoy life too" the funny thing is that my classmates are wondering wad i'm enjoying so much. seriously. and what i wanna say is that all of u have this secret. they don't. i'm not saying they don't have fun at all. but i have like 1000x more of what they have. if u guys saw the amount of work i have 2 put in every week at poly u'll be really surprised how much fun i'm having. even i'm surprised. let me give u a rundown of my timetable. from mondays to thurs, i start at 10 and end at 5. nearly a full work day with only one hour lunch in between. (ok 10's good). then on wed i start from 8 and i end at 5.30 cos of cca (tennis! haha). only fri's good where i start at 8 and end at 12. then i do stuff with my class. we either have lectures or tutorials (where i sit for hours drawing. not sketching. proper drawing which rocks actually if u think from my point of view haha juz really tiring) ok but after 5 i'm free and i don't really hafta do anything unless i wanna do it on my own like read up for the next day's class. i have like 3 projects on hand of which one i hafta finish this week&nbsp;and it's the 1st week of lessons. ok tell me that's not hectic? but the reason i'm having so much fun is because i really believe God created everything for my enjoyment. like food. i've stopped eating what i feel is right. i eat to enjoy. my dad showed me a quote today.    God is most glorified in us when we are most satisfied in Him. - John Piper.   very true. why wait til u can be like in my position or in another position to enjoy? enjoy the here and the now. enjoy what Daddy's doing for you now. not a few years later. even when ur going thru bad situations, enjoy, because it's always gonna turn good for those who love Him. if u look at the big picture, u'll really realise there is alot to enjoy in life especially for us who are in Christ. don't wish that u could be another person to enjoy u noe why? cos u'll never be and don't tell me tt means ur never going to enjoy life? enjoying life is leading a life of worship as well. it's a day to day thing not once in a lifetime. cherish. and ENJOY! :)

God is so good to me man... so we were like juz playing nonsense... i teamed up more wif this guy in my class called zhongyi... n we played against clement n weesoon also from my class... the other girl, serlyn,&nbsp;in tennis was like nua nua tt kind... so we juz played... it's like super fun! and we're all improving.. praise God i can actually get the ball over the net haha and praise God my frenz say i hit v nicely... the only thing is that my hand's still slightly weak so most of the time i hafta hold the racket wif both hands... but tt's ok cos God's grace is in abundance...   what i really learnt is that u really can't trust ur flesh.. like wad teacher kev said it's so scary 2 so subtly rely on your own efforts. cos i had some tennis lessons while i was living in HK so tt's more than 10 yrs ago! n when i went for this thing feeling confident tt i could do it n be good at it even. self confident. i mean afterall i learnt b4 n i play leisurely so i thought i was pretty good. but boy was i wrong! the first 10 times i ever hit the ball were failures! i was really stunned at my poor performance.. then i realised n repented... relying on God's grace is so SO important! well today actually i didn't really think about it n praise God!! i think i've improved... being the last least n definitely lost isn't so bad afterall... haha... bcos God's grace is abounding so much more... dunk me in, Jesus!! i wanna be like totally soaked in the grace of God... like being drenched... yes... ooh... i feel my arms getting toned already juz after one day... but not too toned Lord! i want nice slim arms! amen... and my nice tan plus nice figure isn't dependant on the amount of tennis i play... it's dependant on ur love for me... plus ur grace... ok... i've talked myself happy... oh yeah! i got something to tell the lydia n denise n yx! ok when i see u... anyway... going! tata! God bless!

Daddy's been extremely faithful to me... now it's not so much of me being faithless cos every believer has faith... but being unfaithful... and tts wad we are... but yet His grace is more than sufficient... i learnt my biggest problems isn't so much of how i think i don't have enough and trying to work 2 deserve (of cos sometimes lah i mean who doesn't?) but it's more than i think too highly of myself... joking about ur ego too much isn't a good thing... it suddenly becomes part of u... anyway&nbsp;there have been lotsa things i've been expecting from God n i already can sense a difference in my life... and a special glory... cos i've got a scar on my nose cos my classmate scratched me in a catfight (haha... ok i'm kidding about the catfight bit.. n my classmate... but really i have a scar which is healed already in Jesus name) ya n i've been reminding myself (cos God doesn't need any) tt the glory of God is my shield and healing is in great measure becos it's already paid for on the cross n becos i'm the last the least n the lost n therefore grace can abound much more amen! Daddy's good... even to the hopeless because He's our hope... which means constant expectation... yeah alrighty gtg! tata  praise God for : my new shoes! my new com! my new harddrive and everything! praise God...
