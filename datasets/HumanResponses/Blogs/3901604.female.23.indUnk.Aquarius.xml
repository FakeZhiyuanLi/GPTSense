      Thought:&nbsp; If we were living in a matriarchal society, would there be masculinists instead of feminists?&nbsp; How is it that some feminists can justify male-bashing, but get angry at the thought of macho, chauvinistic pigs?   Isn't it discrimination, regardless of who or what you are, if you are against someone for a trait other than what you are?   Racism is multicolored.&nbsp; So is chauvinism.&nbsp; I preach equal rights, not equal hate.

       urlLink Virginia is for Haters   How sad is this?  Whether you believe in a particular lifestyle or not, you really have to consider what this does for Civil Liberties in this country.    Whatever happened to the right to the pursuit of happiness?

      I’ll admit, I toke up occasionally.&nbsp; Not frequently, and it doesn't interrupt any of my usual day-to-day doings.&nbsp; It's a relaxation.&nbsp; Some people come home and occasionally have a beer or two; I will, on a rare occasion, pull out the pipe and partake of the green.  &nbsp;  It was in this mindset last night that I sat down to watch  The Daily Show with Jon Stewart . &nbsp;And a brief discussion on stem-cell research came up.&nbsp; I was in the middle of a book, and only half caught the discussion, but it got me to thinking.  &nbsp;  I meandered off to bed, as I was in search of an orgasm (alas, a failed mission!).&nbsp; So I lay in bed thinking about the DNA arguments, and pondering things like sheep cloning.&nbsp; (I blame VH1’S “I Love The ‘90s” for that one.)&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Thought:&nbsp; clone a gay man.&nbsp; See if his clone grows up to be gay.&nbsp; As the clone is a genetic duplicate of the original, if the clone grows up gay, it should be proof that homosexuality is an inherent trait.&nbsp; If the clone grows up to be straight, then maybe I’ll consider going back to the Christian Church.  &nbsp;  Or not.  &nbsp;  Regardless, wouldn’t it be a fabulous way to test the theory?&nbsp; My money’s on the clone being gay.&nbsp; Don’t want to clone a gay man?&nbsp; How about a lesbian?&nbsp; I’d be game for that one.&nbsp; ‘Course, I consider myself bisexual, so I guess you’d have a 50/50 chance with my clone.&nbsp; Would sure make the concept of threesomes seem more appealing.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Would having sex with your clone be considered incestuous?&nbsp; Or would it be masturbation?  &nbsp;     &nbsp;  If there is one thing I’ve learned from the Republican Party, it’s that  repetition = truth .&nbsp; For example, Bush’s speech Wednesday where he repeated 8 times that the American People are safer.&nbsp; Well, we must be… he repeated himself eight times.&nbsp; I wonder if that’d work on my poli-sci professor.     Me: I got an A on that paper.  &nbsp;  Prof: Nope. That was a C+.  &nbsp;  Me: No, I’m pretty sure it was an A.     Think he’d buy it?  &nbsp;  I don’t think so, either.

      I am an egg.  Still learning, still growing.  Never closing my mind to any idea.  I can think.    I'm not pretentious.  I don't feel particularly intelligent.  I'm just your average 23-year-old young lady:  College drop-out (twice), halfway decent dead-end job, dreaming of world travel and eventually finishing my degree.  But I pay attention.  With the United States in the condition that it's in, I have to pay attention.  I'm afraid if I block it out for just one moment, the rest of my civil rights will be stripped and Margaret Atwood's world from "The Handmaid's Tale" will be fulfilled.   I think of that and shudder.  I never wanted to be political.  I just want to live in a place where everyone is allowed to marry who they want to marry, do with their bodies as they wish, and all the skin is a creamy golden brown because no one let their color stop love.    Did I mention I'm idealistic?

       1) "Deity" exists. Refer to him/her/it however you so choose; it's there, no escaping. Give credit where credit is due, and seek out Deity in all its forms in everything. We come full circle, and we will eventually return to Deity.    2) Everything is a part of Deity, and we should show proper respect for each spirit. Thank the spirits of the food you eat, and above all harm no living thing.   3) Mother Nature is a part of Deity, and the lifeblood for our spirits. Earth should be given the care needed, and every effort should be made to prevent harm to her. This includes recycling, rejecting pollution, and picking up after myself... as well as everyone else.   4) The least among us are also the greatest, and therefore should be treated accordingly.    5) Change - whether forced or chosen - is inevitable, and should be embraced at every chance. Only by moving with the wind will we remain standing.    6) A closed mind doesn't let anything in. Approach the world with your mind open, so that knowledge can flow freely within.    7) Hard work never killed anyone. Certainly never hurt anyone. It's a great way to balance desires with obtainability. And a job well done can sometimes be its own best reward.   8) There is a virtue to selfishness. Don't be afraid to claim "my time" when needed, and above all remember that "No" is sometimes an appropriate answer.   9) Altruism and idealism are great, and should be adhered to as closely as possible, but its cold hard cash that pays the bills. Refer to # 7.   10) Be aware of the world around you. Not just environment, but the noise of the world. That white noise can supply needed information, should you remember to pay attention.   11) Your body is a temple. Exercise it, maintain it, and don't put things in it that don't belong there. Processed foods, chemicals, and preservatives don't belong there.   12) Your body isn't just a temple, it's a jungle gym, and capable of giving immense pleasure. Don't be afraid to let it go, regardless of how -you- think it looks. It's probably not as bad as you think it is, and why let inhibitions stop your fun?  I reserve the right to change, modify, ignore or observe any of the above to suit the needs of the moment.  But I promise to try to stick by 'em to the best of my abilities, 'cause everyone needs some sort of code of ethics.
