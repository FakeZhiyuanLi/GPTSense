      Ok rant time!!!  Got up this morning to go and buy a new mobile phone I want one of the 3 video phones. I went into the local shop a few weeks ago and was told that the phone was £50 if i went on the slightly higher tarrif which was fine so went away to think about it I went back today and the guy in the shop said that it was £150 unless the shop over the road had one in then the price match would be £100!!! I told him that i had a different price a few weeks ago but he just showed me the price list so i left Feeling annoyed that i had got up early to walk through the rain (i couldnt find my jacket!) i thought i would go and have a maccie dees breakfast I knew that it was almost 10:30 but thought i would have enough time I went in,stood in the queue...When i got to the front of the queue the guy said "Its after 10:30"  ME: "I have been stood in this queue for 10 minutes!!!"  Jobsworth: "Its 10:40"  ME: "But i have been waiting in the queue!!!"  Jobsworth: "Do you want to speak to the manager?"  ME: "Yes!"  So told the manager that i had been stood in the queue for ten minutes  Manager: "No you havnt"  ME: "I have!"  Manager: "Look im not being funny"  I couldnt believe it.He claimed that at 10:30 he had told the people at the tills that breakfast was over and that i wasnt in the queue  I didnt know what else to say so i just turned at left  Maybe i should start a website where people can leave their instances of bad service?  Anyway i still dont have my phone :-(

      Bloody solicitors!!!  The solicitor in our chain that has been dragging their feet (the one who said they wouldnt be able to get all the paperwork together in time for a move on the 4th) is "off sick" today....Isnt that convienent?  So this means that as long as the final bits and pieces get sorted next week then we should be moving on the 18th  Big gutted as i was hoping we move on the 4th but i knew it was a long shot  Looking forward to the bank holiday now...lets hope the weather is good!!!

      I just told B about my blog.I didnt think it was a big deal but she seemed a little wary.I hope that if she reads this that its just an overspill for my brain! (If your are reading this babe then i love you x) all the in house stuff is getting exciting now so we came to the best place to discuss it....The pub! B also got a contract extension to her job this week so thats one thing less to stress about (till christmas that is!) but all in all been a decent couple of days. I won a tenner on the fruity too! Why does it always happen when i have just been paid and not before when im broke! Ho hum

      Light at the end of the tunnel  Have two provisional dates for the move. Either the 4th or the 17th  Im thinking it will be the 17th with the way one of the solicitors is playing up.  Cant wait to get it all going as its been such a long time since it all started (as in January!!!!)

      Bloody money  Just got my payslip and i have figured out i am that im skint before the money even hits the bank!!  Im a bit confused as im not spending anything more than normal (my phone bill was a bit higher than normal but its nothing major)  Maybe its because im looking at it as a weekly figure whereas i dont normally figure it out on paper... Oh well,best get on with it!!!

      Why is it so hard to find a five/six/seven a side league where I can go and play?  When I moved to Nuneaton I stopped playing in a league that was run in Birmingham as it was a bit far for 25mins of football  I thought that finding someone else to play for would be a piece of cake! I have sent email to various companies that run leagues and they never reply or they always play on stupid times...Who plays football on a Friday night??????  its been about 10 weeks now and since the normal season has finished im pining for my footy :-(  Training is ok on a Tuesday but its not the same as a competitive game Kevin at work has said that he might know someone who needs a player so hopefully I can get some regular action  If anyone is reading this who has a team near Nuneaton (Tamworth,Coventry?) then im not that bad a player!!!! You know you cant do without me ;-)

      Maybe not but i think i might be drinking a bit too much  I have gone about a week and a half having a least one drink a night  I also had quite a bit over the weekend. Me and B went to see some from friends Saturday night.I took a four pack of Stella and a crate of 24 bottles Me and Ben worked through it during the night and had 13 bottles left at the end of the night I took eight home and polished six of them off Sunday night.I was going to drink the last two but im saving them for in the week.......Did i just say that!  Ok i know im not in the alcoholic class but im going to end up with a beer belly!!!!  I think i should step up my efforts to find a new five-a-side team!

      Wow only been a user a couple of days and im Blogging in the early hours.Is this the first sign of becoming an addict???  Probably not. Truth is me and B watched Kill Bill tonight She fell asleep (she has work tomorrow!) and I thought it was ok.Typical Tarantino..Nice action sequences!  I decided to come on here as a change to playing my xbox since im not very tired.I usually disturb B playing the Xbox while she is asleep and since she is working tomorrow (and looking so peaceful and beautiful!) I thought I would come and do something else  B thinks that she doesn't look at her best when she is asleep. I disagree with her but she wont have it!! I havnt really talked about her much on here yet (in case she finds it!! hehe) but she is the love of my life! Im really looking forward to moving into the house so we can be together without getting in anyone else's way! Once we have got all that sorted we can think about getting married! wow She also thinks im not serious about marrying her. I am though.I love her with all my heart and want to spend the rest of my life with her.I just want to wait for the right time with the house and stuff.I hope I can make her realise before she ditches me for taking my time :-p  Wow did I just type all that deep heartfelt stuff?? couldn't have been me...better get another beer and search for porn or something in case anyone thinks im losing my masculinity!   ;-)

      Ok so I have posted a couple of test messages and decided that maybe I should actually post something that makes sense?  Since TV and computer games have destroyed my imagination im struggling for inspiration  ........  My week?  What have a done in the last seven days?  12th,13th,14th  Got what feels like a bad cold so had a couple of days off work and was very bored as I didn't have my xbox or any DVD's with me :-( Found out that the music channels on sky start playing the same videos again if you leave it long enough! Went back to Nuneaton Friday night as I was missing B like mad!   Saturday 15th  Spent most of the morning in bed as I was still tired from being ill Eventually made our way over to my parents as it was the footy team do tonight! I had to go to the League presentation as well as I was lucky enough to finish the division one top goalscorer! (15 goals) I felt very proud of my achievement until they read out all the other league scorers  Div 5 - 41 Div 4 - 36 Div 3 - 31 Div 2 (I stopped listening at this point) Div 1 (ME!) Prem - 23  Left as soon as I got the trophy as I wanted to go to the team do and get pissed! LOL  Picked up another two trophy's at the team do (Top goal scorer (21) and Player's Player) which I was very pleased with and had a few beers too! Couple of the guys came in fancy dress so saw Captain Jack Sparrow,Batman and Catwoman,A monk,Alice in wonderland,some guy dressed in a kilt and a really old Scotland top, a gangster (he looked more like Mickey Pierce from Fools and Horses though!) and a fitness instructor I enjoyed myself even if we didn't have a great turnout!   Sunday 16th  Spent most of the day at my mom's packing up all my crap for when the house gets sorted (if it ever does!)   Monday 17th  Back at work.Its horrible after a few days off so went down the pub with B after work had a most enjoyable 4 pints of Stella while talking about our plans for the future   Tuesday 18th  Went to training and bored myself to death!We were winning 11-0 at one point.Decided against staying at my parents and went to see B.   Wednesday 19th  After work me and B decided that the weather was far too good to sit in the house so decided to eat out.Had great pizza (never had Cajun chicken on a pizza but it was great!) and then went down the local (which is the Anker at the moment) got back about 11:30, on a school night as well!!!!!  How boring is my life????? At least its a worthwhile "proper" post

      Weekend wasn't too bad.  We had nothing planned and since I hadn't seen my parents properly for a while we decided to go over for the weekend.I also saw my Nan too as I haven't seen her for ages (and it was her birthday last weekend)  We also went fridge shopping as its one of the last things that we will need for the house (which should all be sorted this week so fingers crossed!)  We both agreed on one pretty much straight away (which is rare.we normally both choose different stuff) so will get that ordered as soon as we have a concrete date  I also played my first game for the new team I have been training with It wasn't a serious game.There is a new team that trains in the same place as us so we marked out a pitch and had a practice game. It was decided that it would only be twenty minutes each half and we would just play it as though it was a training match (so no killer tackles)  I started up front but after about 10 mins I was shattered.It amazing how you lose your match fitness when you don't play proper games.I got my "second wind" after that and I did ok.I won some tackles and made some good lay offs The second half went better as I started to get used to the teams style of play.I made some good runs and had a header just wide.I also scored but it for some reason it wasn't allowed.The ball dropped into the box from a header and the keeper came out.I didn't think he would get there in time so I challenged for it and managed to head it goalwards.As it was going to the goal I stretched and managed to toe end it in.The defender following me slid in and cleared it.It was a good couple of yards of the line but since there was no ref and it was at their end I was the only one who could claim it. I came off a couple of minutes before the end so I think I played more than anyone else. I ended up with a nasty bang on the shin that was also cut (from the studs of a challenge) and I was cursing myself for not wearing my pads!  I don't think I did too badly.I wasn't brilliant and it took me a while to get into it. If the pitch was bigger I think I may have had more joy as the ball carried through to the keeper a lot when on a normal pitch I would have been able to get in behind the defense.The manager said that we would have a proper friendly with them once the posts are up so hopefully I should be able to finish the job then!  Im still not decided as to whether im going to join them or not. My head tells me that I should  They aren't a bad team.There are some good players and they are a good set of lads and I will see lots of them anyway as its going to be my local  My heart doesn't want me to though as I think I will miss the Hardwick a lot. This team is also a bit shaky at the back and I can understand why they are in Division 4 The training is going well though and with enough polishing I think they will be ok this season.  I have a bit of time though and I have only been twice so we'll see eh

      Its been a week since my last post. Im not entirely sure why i havnt been on here as there as been quite a lot going on  The European Championships are now well underway. England have 3 points in their group after losing (very harshly in my opinion) to France and a decent win over the Swiss  I also went for a kickabout with a team who are from what will be my local once i have moved into the house The training went well. They do "proper" training that i havnt been used to with the Hardwick It was weird doing the sort of training i havnt done since i played Saturday football It wasnt that i dont like it.Its just i have been with the Hardwick a long time Anyway i think i aquitted myself during the training and impressed with some of my finishing in the training we did. I didnt do as well in the little game that we had at the end. I got a goal but i didnt feel like i do when i play well in Hardwick training. I think it might be because i dont know anyone and as im the new boy i cant go shouting at everyone. There is a practice game setup for Sunday so i think i will just go into it as though it was the Hardwick.I have been there once so its not like im a total stranger  The big decision is still wether i should sign for them. I have played for the Hardwick since i was 16 and i will be 24 in August I have lots of friends because of it and its not just the football that im with them. But the team isnt as it was when i first joined.There is also the practical side of things as well.Im moving about 30 miles away and buying a house where money may be tight for a bit.I guess i'll see how Sunday goes first.

      Wow three visitors!!!  I actually have visitors :-p  Well not actually true. The counter that i use has lots of cool features and i can find out lots of interesting (well for a computer geek i guess interesting) information about the people who have visited.  From what i can tell the three visitors are:  B while she was at work. Someone at my parents house (probably my dad) and someone else!! I dont know who this other person and i have only given B and Dad my blog address  So hello! Leave a comment next time :-)

      Had some bad news today. Wont be moving into the house on the 18th after all They are pushing it back to the 24th Really annoyed about it as the stuff that is left to do should have been sorted weeks ago  Was feeling really pissed off so was glad to go to football to vent my frustrations and felt a lot better for it! (even if i did smash my toe up)

      Had quite a busy weekend Our friends came over Friday night and B cooked a great meal for us all. Saturday we went to watch the England game and just carried on drinking! I ended up on the karaoke with Ben which I never do!!! I was very very drunk and I think I passed out at about 3 in the morning :-S Sunday was a lot more chilled.Well it was when we found the keys that B had lost She dropped them as she got out the car and didn't realise. Someone picked them up and put them in the local shop where we managed to get them from Its nice to know that the area im moving to has some decent people :-)

      I have fiddled around a bit with the templates a bit but i still had no idea if im having any visitors  Im guessing not since no-one ever leaves comments but to make me feel better i thought i would add a counter to my page. Its right at the top in the red numbers. Its at 0 right now so here's hoping it goes up a little (1 would be nice!!!)

      Been a bit down for the last couple of days and not exactly sure why  Sure im pissed off with work,miss playing football and cant wait to move into the house out of the tiny room we are in at the moment but thats not really any different then any other day?  I guess im a bit more annoyed with work than normal. While im looking forward to the house i guess im not really looking forward to being skint all the time.  I know that everyone else is the same but im one of the lowest paid where i work but have been there longer than most. The difficult thing is that work has been really good to me.I wouldnt have my car and i certainly wouldnt be moving into the house as they helped me out with (loaning) some of the deposit.But it does mean they have a little bit of hold on me as i cant go anywhere without paying the cash back.  I would feel as though i seemed ungrateful if i went and asked for a pay rise but i feel im worth a bit more and surely they must value me in some way if they intended to "tie" me into the company for next few years (or however long it takes!!)  Maybe i have just had a crappy week and i'll feel better after the weekend. The England game is on and have a pretty busy weekend planned (even though i cant really afford it lol) which will involve hanging out with friends, getting drunk and spending some time with B  See i have cheered up already!!!    :-p

      I went to the gym with my friend last night.  We started going a couple of months ago every Wednesday night I started going as moral support as i get enough exercise through footy For some reason last night i was on a bit of a mission and worked really really hard. I was a bit tired this morning as a result!  Work is a bit slow,i guess its because of half term and people on holiday and such.  I had a quick look on the 3 website this morning and they have extended the free text message offer so i might go and get the phone after all  If anyone has any experience with 3 and the Motorola A925 i'd love to hear what you think?

      Eurgh!!!  I hate going back to work after a bank holiday so getting up this morning was a bit of a chore  Had a pretty good bank holiday though. After the farce that was my Saturday we went to a fair with our friends on the sunday and then went to the pub after :-p  Since we are moving into the same area as our friends (L+B) we decided to check out the local pubs. We went in the Royal Oak and had a very good time.They have a late license,have pool tables, run a footy team and even have an old Sega Rally machine!!!  I got chatting to the landlord and i ended up giving my number to the guy who runs the team I'll go training with them but im not sure if im ready to leave the Hardwick yet. I've played for the Hardwick for a long time now (7 years this year i think!) and its not just about the footy.I had a great time in Spain with the lads earlier in the year and if i left to play somewhere else im sure i would lose touch with most of them.  On the other side though the Hardwick is very different from when i joined.Most of the younger lot dont get involved with the social side and its always the same couple of us in the pub after training. It is also a lot of travelling   I guess i'll make the decision after i have been training with this new team. He might not even call me as i was a bit pissed and he had probably lost the number!!

      Im on a training course in London this week (well Kingston) I dont mind working away but the one thing that bothers me is how bored i am. Once the course is finished i dont know what to do with myself. There is a cinema nearby but there isnt much on at the moment and since i dont know the area i cant really go anywhere I have also left B on her own.We have only been moved into the house for a couple of weeks so i think she is a bit scared of being on her own. We have sorted some things out so that she is visting friends and stuff but its the end of the night when she is on her own I guess she will be ok.I will call her everynight and she has lived in a house on her own when she was at uni. I hope i find something to amuse myself!!
