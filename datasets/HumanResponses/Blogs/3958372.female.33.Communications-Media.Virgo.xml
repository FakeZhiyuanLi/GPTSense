      When I think about this Air Supply song, I don't know what to surmise. Have I lost in love or am I lost in love? I would like to think both. I kind of feel both today. I'm someone who likes to live for the day. Do I want love to be suffering, as someone said to me today - love is suffering! No way, I want to live every day happily in love. But is it humanely possible when you are constantly pursued by lonliness. Life is a constant fight against loneliness, despair, negativisim especially when you are living in a small country like Singapore, far away from your own country, far away from the dynamism of Mumbai city, your own folks and your friends. Out there, when your love lets you down, at least you have your family and friends to fall back on. Here there's constant despair, and an urge to escape from this island of loveless life. Today is my wedding anniversary, one of the most dull and boring days of my life, hubby just gave his courtsy call to wish me in the morning from distant America, without any display of love or emotion. He expects me to feel on top of the world with that. I'm human after all, so how do you expect me to react? It felt like the longest day of my life, I surfed the net, read the news, tried to sleep in the afternoon, couldn't sleep plagued by persistent negative thinking, popped an anti-depression pill to deaden the anxiety in my brains, slept finally, still many hours to kill, went to the gym and exercised for an hour, came back, ordered a Pizza, had a shower, and then made myself a strong drink which I had with the Pizza, still a lot of time to go. I'll probably read a book putting on my radio softly, hopefully sleep would invade my senses and make me happy and reposeful. Tomorrow is another day, hopefully it'll begin and end happily.

      Gloomy weather in Singapore. Strangely it's a feeling-less day. Don't feel towards anything strongly. Early in the morning I got a rejection letter from the newspaper that I had&nbsp;applied for a reporter's job.&nbsp;That is, after doing considerably well in the written test. Well that's my destiny I guess. We Indians are pretty&nbsp;good at passing off our failures to destiny.&nbsp;It's time to seriously rethink what I want to do with my life. Be a writer! I think I can pass off reasonably well writing erotic novels and letters. I guess am pretty good at it because I write erotic letters everyday to my sweetheart. I have no qualms or inhibitions about describing every little intimate detail of&nbsp;lovemaking, our&nbsp;fantasies, being&nbsp;far apart from each other. Every morning I log on to&nbsp; write a letter to him.&nbsp;Today it took me a while to get over the rejection letter and write him a long loving email, as if things were normal. Well&nbsp;in the midst of despair, love is our only hope I guess. You have each others love&nbsp;to fall back on. Love can be life's greatest support. No more PMS blues, life is calm and tranquil again. Time to go and exercise in the gym. Need to get rid of all the bad energies. I want to be a loving, hopeful and optimistic person and pass all the positive energies&nbsp;to my loved ones.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

      I had a terrible start to the day. No one loves me,&nbsp;life on earth is full of sufferings!! Well am on a total pms mode today.&nbsp;I see bleakness everywhere. This is my perception of life life today. Who knows, things might change tomorrow, in this world of constant mood swings. I had a bad start to the day. Hubby calls me from America to voice his discontent over an email I sent him last night- a one liner of course "Are there no phone services in America?" He hadn't&nbsp;called us for a quite a while. Well I guess&nbsp;it was enough to elicit an immediate respone - an sms and a phone call in the wee hours of the morning. Of course he expects me to write nice loving emails to him everyday but he doesn't bother to do the same for me.&nbsp; But&nbsp;what did I really gain from it??? Nothing, but pain. So from today, I've decided not to be emotionally dependent on T. I'm not going to be bothered whether he writes to me or&nbsp;phones me&nbsp;or sms' me. I'm going to build an invisible wall where no man can penetrate and hurt me. That's&nbsp;one thing. One incident sparks off the other. I had called up&nbsp;my distant sweetheart hoping to hear some kind&nbsp;reassuring words and&nbsp;hoping to feel loved and wanted but only met up with his stony silence. Never show your vulnerability to someone who is in awe of you because half the time he might wonder who you&nbsp;really are!! Alas! I'm beginning to believe in that almost hackneyed cliched saying, "when you laugh, you laugh with the world but when you cry, you cry alone." I guess that's true.&nbsp; Believe me, you are better off&nbsp;not communicating&nbsp;your grief to anyone. It's&nbsp; better&nbsp;to drown &nbsp;your&nbsp;sorrows in alcohol, a book, a nice&nbsp;movie or music. At least they wouldn't let you down. Unleash your grief and disappointments in your diary and when things start looking up, start day dreaming. What would&nbsp;I do if I have some money? First of all, buy a Sony PD 170 camera, then buy a the latest Nikon SLR Digital camera, buy the most sophisticated&nbsp;laptop with video eidting package and then weave around an enchanting world of my own, just live for myself and my little beautiful daughter. Some amount of materialism is not bad&nbsp;I guess.&nbsp;It keeps you going in life. So who says, you need a&nbsp;hubby or a lover to be happy! Happiness is within yourself, it's important to love oneself first!!&nbsp;

      I'm an incurable romantic, I can't live without love and the thrilling adventure of romance.&nbsp;I want to be in love forever because it makes life so exciting.&nbsp; Imagine life without love, it's like a desert, or rather love is like the oasis in the desert of life, the constant tribulations that you come across.&nbsp;From now onwards am going to write down my random thoughts on love and what it can do to one's life, especially my own life. I will write in all honestly all the intimate details of my experiences, my feelings and observations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

      Love is often subjected to one's terrible ego. What is love I ask? Is it pain and suffering or is it inflicting pain and suffering upon your loved ones because of one's ego? I'm terribly confused. I love my husband very much. I often feel insecure about him and in a rage I end up doing all the wrong things, in my fits of jealousy and possessiveness. I want to be the centre of his universe and want to be the most important person in his life. But when you are married for several years, things change. You are expected to mellow down and become mature, have less expectations from your partner and give him space. I haven't been doing that. I don't think it's impossible to change. Can I resurrect my marriage? I think it's worth giving it a try. It's never to late to realize one's mistake and try to mend things. I regret all my silly mistakes and seriously want to undo all of them. Is there a way out?
