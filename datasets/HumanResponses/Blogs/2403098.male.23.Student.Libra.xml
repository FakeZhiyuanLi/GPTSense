      Oh well.  Today was a boring day.  Still in Rockport, still hanging out with the family.. didn't feel so hot though.. kinda just slept off and on all day.  It was "allergies" that were getting to me.  right.  I was up a little too late last night.  Probably didn't help the feelings of ill.  I'm quite bored right now, just sitting around, listening to the radio. wow the station is called "K-BAY"  how creative is that?   Damn smooth rock, makes me feel like I'm .. i dont know in a department store or something.    The world is REALLY small.  This is what i've determined.  I guess I knew already, but it's weird how many people know each other.  (I know what I'm talking about, and what has sparked this realization, so that's all that matters).  It's just weird to think that everyone knows so many people... like ____ amount, and then each one of those people know ____ many people, and so on and so forth.  Pretty soon we're all related and we all have babies that look like monkeys!!!  Well.. some babies look like monkeys anyway, bless their hearts.  Black babies are really cute.  Don't you think?  Who am I talking to?  I dunno.  maybe i'm talking to a black baby, leave me alone.  Michael Jackson doesn't look black at all.  I wanna know what his deal is.  I'd like to just like.. go into Neverland, which.. by the way doesn't even look that great, and look at what his life is like.  FREAKISH no doubt.  I saw him covered on FoxNews today.  You know, where America goes for "Fair and Balanced" News.  ie- propoganda.  Nothing is balanced about FOXNews.  That's okay tho.  I think they kinda plant weird ideas into people's heads though.  Call it fair and balanced, that's fine.  What  a weird train of thought.  CHOO CHOO!   Choo-Choo-CHOOSE me.   bye:)

      It's the day after thanksgiving and I don't want a turkey sandwich.  What more can I say?  I think that pretty much sums it up.  I'm hungry, but NOT for more turkey.   I'm sitting here in the computer room and just heard my dad say "Ya'll need to get that blood up before it stains."  HMMMMM, what has been GOING ON out there while I was sleeping until nearly 2pm?  Probably one of our many animals ran into something.  It's a really nice day, I think I'll.. sit around.   BYE

      Okay, so I'll start this.  I know it wont last though, so I wont be surprised myself if I never write here.  ANYwho, I'm down at the coast visiting the family for Thanksgiving, feeling quite the fatass at the moment, I love to eat, I wish I didn't.  When I get back to Norman, it's definitely 'go-time' with the whole working out thing.  Note to self:  price personal trainers to see what the going rates are.  So I copied Lauren, she started an on-line journal, why shant I?  I don't know, seems fun.  Hers was nice, mentioned nice things about me, us getting back together as friends in whatever context that might evolve.  OOH thanksgiving = thankful shit.. So what am I thankful for?  I'm thankful for friends, I'm thankful for my family who is quirky, but always there for me.  I'm thankful for my dog, Boomer, because I think that he's a special little creature.  I'm thankful for all the opportunities that I've been granted, and for no good reason either.  I did nothing to deserve probably 99.79% of what I have, and for that I'm truly appreciative.  I'm thankful for the opportunity to have attended college, and the support to get a higher degree should I desire.  I'm thankful for my car, even though it sounds weird right now, I'm so glad I at least have something when so many people have to walk.  Okay, so really I don't know ANYONE who walks around or literally "RUNS" errands, but still, I'm thankful for it NONEtheless.  I'm thankful for so many things, that I'll just have to cut a lot of them short, much like a rambling acceptance speech at an awards show.  *Pointing my award up to heaven*.  Thanks to the fans, etc.    So I am glad that Lauren contacted me.  I never like discord between people, but it's so difficult sometimes to know what to do when you feel hurt in a situation.  It constantly amazes me just how powerful human emotions are, and words as well.  I could say things, and know that they are merely a compilation of words grouped into sentences, and change people's entire lives.  So strange, so scary, so... so... whatever Jesse Spano.  Aiite, I'm gonna stop this now.  I could write for probably 10 hours because I'm WIDE awake after my post-thanksgiving nap, yet my entire family is asleep.  I'm bored... not much to do out on the town in Rockport, Texas on a holiday.  Hell, if it was any given Saturday there still woudlnt be much to do.  I could go get drunk at a local dive with Vietnamese shrip-boat captains, or find myself chillin' with some locals, but I doubt that'd be more fun than sitting in my pajama pants and drinking alone.  As I always say- NEVER drink by yourself... (unless you're alone).  Peace out, God Bless the USA, and all that jazz.

      You think you've got it OH you've got it, but got it just don't get it when there's nothing at all.  Outkast rocks my world.  I want to live my life in the magical world of an Outkast video.  It would be like the Emerald City from the Wizard of Oz, except with better music.  Anyway, today I went with my parents in one of the boats to Port Aransas, about a thirty minute boat trip across the bay, for lunch.  It was fun, just to get out there and go fast, see porpoise swimming, watch the pelicans diving for fish, etc.  A bit chilly out there, but it was really fun.  Here we go:  Shake it, shake-shake-it, shake it, shake-shake-it, shake it, shake-shake-it, shake it like a Polaroid picture.  I wonder what song I'm listening to.  Now I'm just kind of relaxing around the house.  Still ready to do the whole application thing this afternoon.  I bought a new hat, that was exciting.  It smells like smoke.  Leave it to a small town to have stores where you can purchase new merchandise, that smells like old smoke.  It will be going in the dishwasher this afternoon.    What do you think about plastic surgery, mister Blog?  I wish you could respond, like an 8-ball or something.  Hmmm.   My cousin told me a hilarious story Christmas Eve. about her boyfriend getting her a birthday present.  I don't know what made me just remember this, but it was great.  He went out and bought her a Nintendo NES gaming system (you know the ORIGINAL Nintendo from like.. I don't know, '87 or something), complete with games and all.  When she was first telling me this, my first thought was "AWESOME!!" then I was like "wait, for your GIRLFRIEND'S birthday?!"  I guess, granted it's vintage, it's not exactly what a 22 year old female would want as a romantic gift from her boyfriend.  Oh lord I laughed at that one.  She was highly amused as well.  Hmm, what am I going to do tonight?  My brother has departed the compound to go kill things on some friends' ranch somewhere.  My parents and I will eat dinner together and then I'm sure they will turn in at around 11, and I'll be wired until 3 or 4am as usual.  I might take myself to a local bar and just have a drink and watch the locals.  I love the bars down here, they get you f*ed up super fast with their strong drinks, and the people are fun.  When we were out boating today, I was taking pictures with my parents digital camera.  I took some pictures of George Strait's vacation home down here.  I felt like I was paparazi!  For a split second I got sorta excited, and then I remembered Princess Diana, and had to have a moment of silence.  Poor Princess DIE... er.. Di.  Why so cynical?  WHY?  I dunno, it's fun.    Is it strange that nearly EVERY night as I drift off to sleep, I take an imagination-guided walk-through of my future home, and exactly how I want it?  I kind of think that's weird.  I picture everything.  It's not even some fantasy-huge place.  Just a really cool condo in some big city, in a big building.  How whack is that though?  I never really thought about it, but I guess it's odd.  I did it last night as I was falling asleep again.  I focused on my bedroom and bathroom a lot last night, and like clockwork, I was asleep in an instant.  I just start walking around (in my mind) from room to room, picturing how I want everything, where I want everything, what it will look like.  It's a DAMN good layout and design too, if I do say so myself.  You should come visit sometime.  Let me know if you want directions to my mind, and I'll draw you a map.  I'm a freak.

      Oh the hook.  I need the hook.  I need to portray myself to be able bodied, to be confident, to be capable and intelligent.  I need to portray that my abilities are a result of my diligent work and a process of maturing and growth though trials, tribulations, and circumstances overcome.   The personal statement is almost done, and as it comes to a close I realize that the world cares mostly how you portray yourself, and that no matter how much you accomplish at this point in your life (23), the most important part is what you are perceived to be capable of.  I am no more competent to be a law student than the next guy, but I must somehow hook an entire committee with the bait of my words in order to make them see that I'm worth the while of granting acceptance into their institution.  It is very scary for me, but it's ALMOST done!  Woo.  Even in the years of my Marketing major, I realize that getting by, getting in, getting through is half (or more) of the process of success.  Not simply turning out grades through memorization.  I'm not saying I am lying in my personal statement at all, because I feel it is all accurate truth.  I just sometimes am struck with the realization that being who you are is not enough.  Being who you NEED to be in the eyes of those whose opinions determine your fate is what matters most.  Highlighting that which needs to have light shown on it, and making sure that you sell yourself for all you are worth and driving home your talents and abilities.  I'm a WHORE I am WHORING MY ABILITIES OUT TO LAW SCHOOLS.  I don't think that's wrong, it's just a funny concept.  Because really when we apply for jobs, when we apply to schools, etc. We get all dressed up.  Be it figuratively or literally, we make ourselves look as attractive as possible: on paper, in person, in interviews, in transcripts and resumes.  They have what we want, and we want to make sure they know that we are what THEY want.  Whoring is probably a bad example, but it's fun to think about.  We're literally trying to get them to accept us so that we can get paid!  I can only hope that when those law schools drive their car past my corner, they will roll the window down and ask me to get in.  Ask me to join them on a 3 year journey and pay me well with their education.    Now all I have to do is find a pimp.  I think my pimp has been so many people who have helped me get to where I am.  I'm just so excited to be about to apply, but still scared at the same time because I don't want to let go of my documents, and then suddenly realize there was a typo, an error, a missed comma, a line about how I was on Apollo 13, when really it was Apollo 12 (a much less exciting mission).  Anyway, thanks to all my pimps.  Please wish me well, as I put on my whorin' clothes and send these applications out.

      Well, another Christmas has come and gone.  I haven't posted since arriving in Texas for the holidays I don't believe.  Oh well, it was a good holiday.  Had the traditional Christmas Eve. Wherein my family members in San Antonio join us for dinner.  It's only one set of members.. An Aunt and Uncle, and two cousins.  Fun times none the less.    This Christmas eve. was especially cool though because I learned so much about my family.  I think it is very sad that our generation doesn't really have much to be proud of when it comes to family because we aren't versed in our family history like generations of the past were.  All I basically am told is what I know first-hand through living members of my family.  Anyhow I got to learn a lot just in conversation, as my uncle and my father talked about their side of the family.  I had no idea that Mr. "Huebner" was my great great great grandfather.  Hmmmm, weird.  Huebner means nothing to anyone who is reading this, but it's been a name I've known ALL my life, and never knew it was my family.  There is Huebner Road in San Antonio, the Huebner House, Huebner Oaks shopping center, etc etc.  Just because Huebner is a very major street, like a "Broadway" in most towns... that goes through the entire city.  WHO KNEW?!    Who knew that my Dad's uncle was Tom Braniff's personal Co-pilot when Tom started Braniff Airways and flew as a pilot for the airline he started.  Who knew that my great grandfather was orphaned at age 8 and never attended a day of school, not even first grade?  On the other side of extremity, who knew that my OTHER great grandfather (dad's mom's side, rather than dad's dad's) sent EVERY one of his children (but the one who wanted to fly, and became a pilot instead) to school AND graduate school, 90 years ago, including his three daughters.  Not too common to receive a grad degree even today.  I think the heritage of THOSE smarts passed right by me and I'm a lil' more like the guy who never went to a day of school in his life though, cause I haven't seen ANY of that will-power spoken of!  So many interesting things can be learned by sitting down and hearing stories that will never be passed on in history books, but are part of your own personal heritage.  Like the table that sits in our formal living room from the 1800's, my grandfathers uncle was shot and killed through a window at that table in the 1800's.  Kinda morbid, but historical anyway.  What if no one ever told me these things?  Grand feats and endeavors are not simply recorded in history books, but I think sometimes in the history of our own lives and those of our personal ancestors.  Makes you start to feel like you have done nothing monumental for your family to talk about years from now.  Makes me feel that way anyhow.  My dad's uncle wanted to be a pilot so bad that he had his friend take his entry test to get into flight school, because he knew he would not pass due to being color blind.  Fraudulent as that might be, when have I followed a dream at all costs?   My grandfather's father would intercept him and his brothers as they walked to the "school house" and instead take them to cotton fields and make them work for the farm owner the entire day, and then keep the money for himself.  When have I ever been deprived from an education and forced to work for nothing?  My grandfather is the only person who sat with his father as he died of brain cancer, as he had treated everyone in his life so horribly that no one was there at his bedside.  WJ went and sat by his father anyway, because no matter what, he was still his father.  When have I ever shown such character and principle?  Probably never.  I think maybe one time I let someone use my cell phone when their car broke down.  Jk, but still, different times can be concluded as many of the reasons things are different today.  I do still believe, however, that men and women of great character are few and far between compared to the times past.  Anyway, it was all kinds of fun, and somewhat sentimental.  I wasn't going to share the letter I wrote to my dad (see entry from Dec. 18th), but since I was caught up in the moment, I decided I would.  I read it to him, but of course I got choked up for some reason.  He did too though, and my mom cried, so I guess it's fine.  If I gave it to him I was going to frame the sucker.  I assumed that would be a bit presumptuous though, to frame something I wrote as if it was priceless.  He said he wants to frame it though before I mentioned I was going to, so I will still do that for him.  Oh Dad, u're fun.  Now I'm down in Rockport, per tradition.  We always open presents and do the family stuff on Christmas eve. and then head down to the beach on Christmas day for relaxation through new year's.  At the present time, I'm drinking a mimosa with fresh squeezed orange juice and some quite tasty champange.  Life couldn't be much more relaxing, save for that cloud hanging over my head with law school.  SO, on that note, I'm going to make those last few revisions and begin the application process.  It's so hard for me to start applying, because I"m afraid that the second I send in an application electronically, I will realize I misspelled a word on my personal statement.  Or I will notice that I did not include something vital on my resume.  OR I will realize that I could have done something better and had someone else revise it just ONE more time.  Guess what Mason, you gotta just let go.  Ohh, i talked to myself, that was cool.   Life at home is fun.  I never want to live here again, but I do love it.  I forget the things that make it so very special and unique until I return.  It is at that point that I realize that no where will compare ever.  Not because it is the best place on earth, but because it is unique.  Because the experiences are special and the area is enchanting.  It's definitely not the worst place on Earth either, and I'm constantly realizing that I apparently was wrong in thinking that it was when I was in High School.  Then again, at that point in time I lived with my parents and couldn't take a shit without being asked where I was for the last 27 seconds.  It really is a special place, very pretty, and unlike anywhere I've been in the country.  I hope I will always be able to call this area my origins and somewhat of my "home" no matter how far I go away from it.  Merry Christmas

      It's 65 degrees.  Yep, just not too creative with a title, but what nice weather.  I'd rather have a driving snow in December than this, but I MUST admit it's very nice outside.    Last night was such a good night.  I took one of my good friends to dinner as a graduation present.  Before I went to dinner I talked to my aunt who said she'd talk to me today (sat) and go over my law school personal statement with me and help me revise it over the phone.  SO, since I had that lined up for today, I decided I could go out after dinner and get sh*tty.  Oh drinks are fun.  Why does my liver strike though?  He (the liver) somehow got his hands on a pack of markers and a make-shift picket sign came into play as well.  He's marchin' around in there like he OWNS the place DEMANDING better treatment (and wages, which is what I DONT understand about the whole situation, because to my knowledge he's never been on payroll).  Anyway, we're (we being me) are SCREWED if like Captain Heart and Mr. & Mrs. Lung get involved in the strike.  Damn.  I'll keep you posted, later today I plan on having a sit down talk with Liver to tell him why I do what I do, and that I really do appreciate what he does for me.. all the filtering and stuff.  This has gone too far, I personify too much.. moving on.  Back to today.  First of all, I can't begin to be thankful enough for all the people in my life who help me so much with so many things.  Lately it's been very noticeable because so many have been helping me with one thing, this law school stuff.  I have such a hard time putting a fire under my ass to get all these tasks done to approach the daunting task of applying.  Everyone from my parents, to my former professor/friend, to LOLA (hi!!) has been helping me.  Each in their own very unique and special way, and I am eternally grateful for all of them and all of their help.  I know that wherever I get to someday, I will not have done it alone.  I'm thankful for that, because I am usually one to not want help, as I feel I can do it on my own.  I always feel like if I ask for help, that I'm not doing it "myself" and am therefore some what of a fraud.  This has been a good learning experience in that respect, realizing that I don't HAVE to do it myself when others are willing to help and are excellent sources of assistance.    Back to today (again), my aunt helped me in such a great way.  My personal statement has been revised so many times, but today my wonderful aunt helped me put the icing on the cake, so to speak (mmm cake).  I am getting very excited to be seeing the light at the end of the tunnel with this application process.    Today's plans also entail going to the Christmas Party at my apartment complex. HA!  They said there will be PRIZES and FOOD.  Shit, all that is missing is a pinata and possibly roller skating and I'd be at an 8 year olds birthday party.  I'm excited though, to spend some time with l.e.e. (cause she's going with me).  YAY.  This will be fun times.  Ouch, Liver just POKED me in the ribs with his picket sign.  I'm gonna close now.  BEFORE I do, I'd like to say that I just do not understand the Lord of the Rings fiasco.  I wish I did, I just don't. I haven't seen any of them and I really don't want to.  Between that and Harry Potter, a cult is being formed somewhere in the world, I just KNOW it.  They turn these movies out faster than I can produce a web-blog on here.  How are they doing it?  Don't sequels to movies usually come out like, 2 years later?  There have been like 9 Lord of the Rings movies in the past 6 months it seems!  OK, I'm done.  :)

      Dear Dad,  You will never read this, and not just because no one ever does, but because it's an on-line journal that you don't even know exists.  I was thinking about you today, however, and wanted to tell you that I appreciate your presence in my life.  Not that I don't think of you or speak to you often, but today I was thinking back on my life and the things that matter to me most.  You have always been there for me in so many ways that are above and beyond the "call of duty" so to speak.  In ways that are more important than simply standing nearby.  I feel that some of the most precious memories in our lives are not those of great grandeur, but rather those of grandeur disguised by simplicity.    I was thinking recently about my love of aviation as a child, and even to this day.  You actually were interested in aviation yourself, having had your pilots license and a plane of your own in the past.  I, on the other hand, somehow developed the intense interest in aviation at an early age.  I could name any jet that flew over my head simply by looking at the pattern of the lights, wing shape, etc.  Each weekend on a Saturday or Sunday you would take me to the airport and sit with me on that one bench at the private jet terminal of the San Antonio International Airport; just so that I could watch the planes pass by.  After about an hour, you would always say "you ready buddy?" and we would return home.  Though I have many memories with you, this particular past-time we shared together struck me as symbolic and especially important.   As lame as it sounds, I never outgrew the love of watching the planes go by at the airport.  I remember actually looking forward to turning 16 so that I could drive myself to the airport and not have to ask you to take me there.  In fact, I actually did start taking myself to watch the planes fly over my head.  It was a form of relaxation and escape for me.  Some might get away from the world by going on a drive, some might have quiet time in their room or sitting alone with nature.  I, on the other hand, always knew I could go to my "spot" and sit and think in peace if I wanted to, enjoying watching the planes fly by.  I would sit wondering where people were going, naming the aircraft in my head as they passed, enthralled in the idea of flight which had always fascinated me.  As I am older now, I realize that spending an hour on a Saturday sitting on a bench while I stared down a runway was probably not the time of your life.  I'm starting to understand though, that memories such as that are what make my childhood special.    Progress long overtook our old bench at the airport, and God knows that they would never allow people to be roaming freely on airport grounds in today's tightly secure transportation environment.  That bench and time we spent there, is much like life though.  You've always given me a "ride" or opportunity to go to the places I wanted to go or had interest in being; whether it was to the airport, or even college and soon law school.  Your support of my interests and endeavors is priceless to me.  Never once did you even give the inkling of an impression that our weekly airport trip was something of a bother.  To this day you give to me in a completely unselfish way, in a way that I often wonder if I would be able to mimic if roles were reversed.  Thank you for always sitting next to me on the bench.  Thank you for always giving me a ride to the places I wanted to go in that selfless manner you always have possessed.  Thank you for pushing me towards being even half the great person that I think you are.  Thank you for always knowing when it's time to move on with a gentle "you ready buddy?"  Thank you for caring for me as a son, and thank you for loving me as a person.    How foolish of me to ever have wanted to be "old enough" to be able to sit on that bench alone.  No matter how old I am, I hope I will always have you to sit next to.  Thank you for supporting me in a way that lets me know that I   will   never have to be alone in life.  I pray that I will always be able to sit next to you and share even an hour of time together, no matter if the surroundings are of interest to either of us.     I love you Dad, Mason

      Maybe I'll start doing this from time to time.  Today's lyrics.. here they are:  It's the luck of the draw How you wound up with me You don't know how at all But i beg you to stay Crawl around on this earth While the world's still small  Honey don't think About it too long now Honey don't think You're liable to figure me out  Something wrong in my stars Could you look at my chart Help me healing these scars Could you learn to read minds In the case of mine Do you read in the dark  Honey don't think About it too long now Honey don't think You're liable to figure me out You don't wanna figure me out You don't wanna figure me out Don't wanna lose  Honey don't think About it too long now Honey don't think You're liable to figure me out  Honey don't think About it too long now (about it too long now) Honey don't think You're liable to figure me out  Honey don't think About it too long  -Grant Lee Buffalo, "Honey Don't Think"

      First and foremost, all apologies to my faithful reader(s) for not posting sooner (boomer sooner) but as you know I have been very busy.  As you also know, I am lying and have no true excuse.  Last night was a magical night.  A night that only happens once every... once every week actually.  It was Monday.  "Monday?  Monday Night Football?" you're thinking.  No, you are thinking wrong.  You see, Monday night brings with it the promise of a special dining experience at the Boomerang Restaurant here in Norman, Oklahoma.  Every Monday night between the hours of 5pm and 10pm, Boomerang serves up their wonderful Chicken Strip platter as usual, but it is ALL YOU CAN EAT STRIPS for this one night of the week.  Oh the pure joy of it all.  "Where is this story going?" You ask yourself.  I PROMISE to tell you if you stop THINKING in the middle of my Blog post for the love of God.  What was so wonderful is that lauren and I decided that in order to ensure we were receiving our money's worth, we should DEFINITELY have all the chicken strips we could eat.  So we DID eat all the chicken strips we could eat.  The kicker is, we took some plastic containers so that we could shovel some under the table here and there in order to have all we could eat LATER too.  Gosh, how is Boomerang even in BUSINESS anymore.  Oh wait, probably because not everyone tries to scam 6 extra chicken strips out of an all-you-can-eat experience there.  F* 'em.. I'd do it again.  note:  The strips I did take in my plastic baggy were eaten before I went to bed that night.  I believe the grand total was at least 13 strips in one evening if you add those to the total at the restaurant.  BBLLAAARRGG

      Hey, check out the new link.  Anomalie (er something).  What a great word huh?  The website is wicked interesting, or at least I thought it was.  It's everything from clever hate mail responses to high profile conspiracys.  For the record:  I do not buy into half the conspiracy stuff, but DID find myself lost within the depths of that website's "Ghost pictures" and "Denver Ineternational Airport" section for a good hour today.  It was not until a car engine started outside my window in the parking lot that I was jolted back into reality.  Scared the f*ck out of me actually because I was in the process of reading about ghosts!  Anyway, check it out, have fun.

      So it's official, laundry has taken over my apartment.  I no longer even bother putting it away.  The process is as follows:  1. Take clothes off my body 2. Put clothes on the floor 3. Put clothes in the washer 4. Put clothes in the dryer 5. ONLY take those clothes out of the dryer when steps 1,2, & 3 have been done with a NEW set of clothes, thus forcing the clothes in the dryer to move to the couch so as to make room for the clothes needing to be put in the dryer.  *WHEW* and I'm SPENT.  so step 6 basically is me watching the pile on the couch grow to the point of distasteful living.  The rest of my apartment, well, it looks pretty damn clean.  Then there's that God-awful mountain of whites and colors and cotton-blended, JCrew, Banana Republic, GAP, T-shirt, 2(x)ist Underwear, sock and jean.  This colorful mountain that always tempts me to lay in it.  Something about a huge pile of clothes is, to me, much like a pile of leaves to a 8 year old. I just want to DIVE into it and possibly take a nap.  My dog would, why can't I?  Don't be fooled, however, because there IS indeed a system here.  I don't simply live like trash.  It works quite well actually.  It's almost like the pile and I live via survival of the fittest (somehow that makes sense coupled with the explanation to follow, not sure why).  You see, as steps 1 - 6 get accomplished, the pile doesn't exactly grow exponentially because at one point or another, I need underwear.  SO, I go to the couch after rolling out of bed, and I dig through until I find some underwear.  Same goes with socks, a shirt, and so on.  Basically the couch is my closet right now.  Though the system "works" I'm still embarrassed by it.  I refuse to let anyone inside my door.  The UPS man was probably even surprised this morning when he woke me up pounding on the door and caught a glimpse of the "pile" over my shoulder.  (I throw the term "morning" around freely as it was in all actuality 1:15pm when I rose to greet the world & the UPS man).  Now is the point where I set forth the goals.  The goal is to get this mountain of clothing into its proper place and once again fill my empty hangers and empty drawers.  The goal is to do that by tomorrow or at least find someone who will.  The goal is... oops, the dryer just beeped that it's done, gotta go (see step 5)

      and I HATE the dentist.  How many things can possibly f*ck up in one day?  Twenty-nine.  The answer is twenty-nine.  I won't list all the annoyance of my day, but holy shit I hated them, I hated them one, I hated them all.  From cell phone cut-outs in the middle of important conversations, to law school application set-backs.  From car rental bills, to vehicular disturbances not being repaired after 5 days of work and hundreds of moneys spent.  Much more to the list, but I'll spare myself the mental anguish of reliving the hell that was December whateverthedateis.  Technically this all happened "yesterday" as it is now WEDNESDAY!!!!  WOOO, "hump" day.  Maybe I'll go hump something.  What a horrible term.. "hump day."  Are you kidding me?  Stupid stupid stupid.  People who make shit like that up should shampoo my crotch.  Next.  It was cold today.    Next.  Christmas, I don't know what I want either lauren.  I read your post and realized that I don't really have any big wishes for the Christ's birthday either.    Hey what ever happened to LFO?  I think it's fly when girls stop by for the summer, for the summer also.  Don't we need a little more of LFO in our lives?  I mean what other people do you know can transition topics better than them (save for maybe the anchors on the evening news who have clever lil' transition such as "speaking of homicide, i'm about to KILL someone it's so hot, Phil- tell us about the weekend forecast").   Example given: (a line from "summer girls abercrombie something rather song." by LFO..  here it is:  "I feel better when you're near.. there was a good man named Paul Revere."  If that's not lyrical GENIUS, you better frickin' believe I want a comment letting me know WHAT IS.  So the last time I posted, I mentioned Shakira, and forgot to leave out that she has a genius status IQ.  Thank you for bringing that to my attention, faithful readers.  You know who I think DOESN'T have a genius status IQ?  Tiffany.  The artist formerly known as, anyway.  She probably goes by Dr. Tiffany now or something more "adult" sounding, like her friend Debbie (aka Deborah) Gibson.  I met Ms. Tiffany at one point in time when she was on campus.  How desperate must an artist be in order to perform a free concert to college kids who simply go so that they can say they heard "I think We're Alone Now" live?  Hell I was shittin' my diapers when that song was popular.    Speaking of musical artists:  Seal.  What is it?  Is it acne scars?  Is it a burn?  Did someone cut you?  I WANT TO KNOW Seal, what's on your face?  Did you get kissed by a rose (hence you song) but the thorn parts got'cha instead of the petal parts?    Cheers.

      As requested: Shakira.  She's hot, she's latin, she's got the voice of an angel (who had a night of heavy drinking and smoking).  I love the woman, and as soon as I can figure out how to post a g'damned picture on here, I will put one on here of me and her.  We're pretty close.  Rumor has it, there's a Mason Mebarak Jr. running around out there.  I just saw a preview for the movie staring Matt Dammon and Greg Kinnear called "Stuck on You" about brothers joined at the .. side or something.  What?  Weren't both of those actors kinda good, or at least credited with winning a couple awards here and there?  What I'm trying to say is, shoudlnt Joey Lawernce be in that movie instead of actual credible actors.  Granted, I DID see an episode of Joey.. ahem, sorry.. "Joseph" Lawernce's sitcom on the WB.  Kinda pathetic.  You know those email surveys that you always get from friends that tell you to fill it all out as it pertains to you, and then send it back to your friend and then to all your other friends.  One of the questions is always about who you'd like to have lunch with, dead or alive.  I think I want to meet the creators of the Simpsons, they're just damn funny.  It's clear I have nothing to talk about.  Back to Shakira.  I wonder what she's doing RIGHT now.  She's pretty big on her homeland of Columbia, but I doubt she hangs out there very often now, what do YOU think?  I'm sure the tempting neon lights of Miami Beach just proved to be too tempting.  I need to stop this insanity, I promise I'll be more entertaining at a later date.  Everyone:  remember your earthquake precautions and keep rations nearby.. never know when the next quake will strike the heart of the heartland.  let us NEVER forget the quake of '03.. and the lives it touched.

      I want my blogspot to become know world famous as "Mason1017."  Am I special enough to have a number after my name like Andre3000 (of Outkast).  You know, when I found out his name was Andre3000, my first thought was that he made it 3000 so that it woudlnt go out of date until the year 3000.

      Yesterday, I posted nothing.  Not a damn thing.  Sorry to disappoint all my fans (you know exactly who I'm talking about, there's one of you).  Ha.  But seriously, it was just one of those days where I had nothing to write.  I actually sat here and tried for a few seconds before I got bored and ate crackers instead.  I had nothing to contribute yesterday, nothing to even bring to the table, kinda one of those days in general.  So it wasn't even something blogger should take personally, as it was true for my life as well.   I am gonna promise myself that one day, I'll pick a topic, and I'll write about it.  That might be cool, because as it is apparent, I kinda ramble.  You know what though, that pretty much seems therapeutic in it's own right.  I just kinda float from one thing to the other, sounding like I'm mad at everything.  LIFE is SATIRE though, it's fun, it's obnoxious, and anyone who can see it through the same vantage points as I.. is in with me.  You see, I had to come to this conclusion because I start to feel bad sometimes.. thinking about how I get so negative in tone.  In all actuality, I'm quite positive in my mind, but shit!  It's like how the funniest comedians make fun of the simplest things that allows people to say in their head "I KNOW, I hate that too!!"  or "I know, it's so true, I always feel that way on an escalator too!"  Whatever that feeling might be.. who knows.  Scared, excited, aroused, whatever.  I personally have no feelings towards escalator.. only that if they're broken, I REFUSE to go up them.  I will NOT participate in using a broken escalator.  Are you joking me?  It's like I'm letting that f*er win.  Right, I'm gonna just let you sit there broken and still do all the work.  NO!  Do your damn job, or get OUT of the mall.  Back to me.  So my conclusion is, I over-negativize (made it up, go with it) things, cause that's how I can make mundane tasks, people, situations, etc, funny in my own mind and hopefully touch lives at the same time.  NOT through my blogspot (God, give me some credit, I'm not claiming people read this and it touches people) but rather.. just in general.  If one person hears the comments I make under my breath in class when that stupid whore at the front of the class asks stupid questions, and they are touched by it.. then so be it.  If not, I've made my day more pleasurable, and hell I'll touch MYSELF for it.  Hmmm, so I've wasted this much time explaining to myself, basically, why I love to make fun of everything.  So lets stop the time wasting and make fun of something.  What topic to choose.  OH who knows, maybe I have nothing important to say today.. or ever.  Lets face it, I'm not the most creative person, I'm not the most witty, and not even the most smartest!  "Most smartest?  MOST smartest?  That's real nice Loretta, real nice."  Gotta love Loretta.  What am I talking about?  Shit- I'm talking about a nap.  This was the worst entry into any journal (electronic, or otherwise) EVER.  I'm gonna just lay here and watch The Price is Right.  Class was boring (AND early) so a nap will come soon.  One final note:  BLOGGER should incorporate the words BLOGSPOT and BLOGGER into it's spell checking system, so that it doesn't have "no suggestions" for those two VERY relevant words.

      I think John Mayer sucks.  I know he doesn't literally suck as he IS talented and all, but I don't want to hear anything else about his body.  I dont care if it's a wonderland, or if he's bigger than it gives him credit for, or if it makes him contort when he sings to the point that he looks as if he's taking a dump in his pants.  The latter is probably the only thing he hasn't actually written lyrics about, but have you seen the guy sing?  C'mon John, you're not good enough to be pulling off the weird facial expressions and look pained by your music as you sing about running through the halls of your HIGH SCHOOL.  Not bitter.  Next subject, no cable.  I haven't had cable for like 7 months now.  I think I need it back.  I'm missing so much, it's like I need to somehow acquire a TIVO that lets me view everything I've missed in the last several months.  Guy Ritche and Madonna apparently don't watch TV in order to avoid hearing negative things about themselves.. maybe I'm like that.  Except no one talks about me on TV.. at least not often.  Hey Lauren remember at number nyne how that one person was a recurrent caller and was paranoid and thought that the TV was talking to him/her/it?  I mean i never received that caller, but hell, no one received calls there.    For everyone else- Number Nyne is a crisis hotline we 'volunteered' at for a few whiles.  No one calls.  If I were getting ass raped by a gorilla in an alley, i wouldn't call a student-run hotline number, would you?  911 is entirely a lot easier to dyle than __ __ __ - NYNE.  (did u like how i spelled "dial" as "dyle"  just to prove that it's an annoying spelling.  Kinda like people who have business that are labeled things like "Kids Korner"  or "Krazy Kat's Kennel"  or ... yeah, you get the idea.    I said this looks like a job for me, so everybody just follow me..   sorry just singing.  AOL radio rocks my world, it's just nice to be able to flip around from 80's to soundtracks to.. hell... Kwanza Holiday Tunes if you want.. why not.  I should study, test in Retailing Management in abour an hour.  Retailing Management?  Are you serious?  Why is this class offered in the marketing department.  Everyone knows that the managers of retail outlets don't need college degrees.. just gotta work urself up from "sales associate" and that takes like, 30 min.  K, now i've offended anyone who's a manager with a degree from Columbia who might be reading this (what are the odds of that... i mean someone reading this that is).  Ciao

      well, back in Norman.  I came back Monday instead of Sunday because it was 100 dollars cheaper to fly on Monday rather than the busiest travel day of the year.  That 100 dollar savings almost cost me my life... at least I want to think it did.  I'll explain, don't worry.  So is my life worth that 100 dollars?  I kinda thing so, at least 99, and hell lets round up here folks.  my net worth has GOT to be at least 99 dollars.  So I get on the plane in Corpus Christi to change planes in Houston (we'll call it H-Town for the ease of understanding of Destiny's Child fans and african americans alike).  Wow.  The flight to Houston was fine, I got on my next flight to OKC which was somehow located in the international wing amongst fligths to Managua, Mexico City, and Merida... among other random destinations of international flare.  All of the check-in lines were packed too.. somehow I didn't understand why.  I guess people in Managua have to fly too at times.  I love seeing lines full of people about to pack onto planes to halfway around (or at least 1/4 the way around) the world.  It's crazy... like almost time travel.  We put all these people in a close space, transport them real fast, and suddenly they're really far away.   OHHH back to death.  So nothing was probably really life-threatening at all, but I get on the plane to OKC.  I buckle up next to the man from Guam sitting next to me and the girl with a pierced lip and torn fishnets.  We no more than push back 10 feet from the gate, and all the power goes off in the plane.  WHAT IF THAT HAD HAPPENED UP IN THE AIR?!  actually i think it woudlnt, it's just that the power never actually started after  they unhooked the ground power.  But still, it was kinda annoying to be sitting in a dark plane, with no lights, no air, etc.. next to 150 strangers (and by stranger, I mean they were STRANGER than normal).    Needless to say, they 'fixed' the power problem, and with fingers crossed the whole way, i flew safely back to OKC.  So really nothing cost me my life, or even close, but it was a fun lil' fantasy drama.  My car still sounds like i'm dragging chains behind it.  Gonna have to get that fixed along with the check-engine-light, front headlight, etc. this thursday.  Fuck spell check- i'm not doing it on this thing, cause i dont want to waste my time with things u'll figure out JUST fine anyway.  Like when it reminds me that sometimes i capitalize my "i's" and sometimes "I" don't.  and SOMETIMES i dont even put the right punctuation on DONT, now DO i?   hehe  Lets see.. final thought.. what will it be.  I had a group project today and made copies and bound the huge thing we created at King Kopy, you know the establishment right by Subway (for all 1 person who reads this, hi lauren).  Well we went to go eat before class at subway but the line was too long, good thing O'Connels Irish Pub is next door..  we managed to get a lil' buzzed before class.  Sure made those dumbass presentations we had to listen to more... wait no, they weren't more thrilling.  NOT EVEN A LITTLE BIT.  In fact if i hear one more marketing presenation where greek life is referenced as "a really big consumer market" (granted it is in a college town)  or "cause u know like a lot of people live in houses and like see others and are influcned by like, like, how like, like.. how kappa kappa, like kappa, like what was i talking about?  I dunno it's like retailing strategy and stuff because like even my big and my lil' and my grand'lil'big'gran'sis'big'lil'step'sis'godchild'bastard'lil is like... um... go sooners"  G'night folks!

      Spread the word (to the losers still buying/wearing them)  Someone at Old Navy is still thinking it is a good idea to market and/or sell the beloved "Painter Pants" or "Carpenter Jeans," and apparently for a good, yet BAFFLING reason.  The reason this was a profitable decision on the part of the Old Navy executives is:  PEOPLE ARE BUYING THEM!  I KNOW!?  that's what I said.  As my mind wandered in my three hour capstone class this past evening, I was drawn to notice the smaller details of my surrounding (this happens after text messaging, making a "to-do list," signing you name 20 times on a blank piece of paper, and counting the ceiling tiles gets old).  My eyes meandered over to the foreign gentleman sitting next to me when he raised his hand to answer a question, and I couldn't help but notice he was wearing painter pants.  Old Navy- you suckered 'em in, you got the foreign kids.  I started to notice that these handy jeans, complete with a strap to carry your hammer, are typically worn by the immigrant or complete douche.  Sometimes by the complete douche immigrant.  "Aren't all immigrants complete douche's Mason?"  You might be asking.  NO, they aren't, and that's very rude of you to say or assume, and for the record YOU said it not me.  Anyway, back to the point, I just don't get it, they aren't needed in our society anymore.  I am sure that somewhere out there, I might offend someone *gasp*- as if that hasn't happened everytime I have opened my mouth in the past 11 years,  but it just has to be addressed.  Painter pants and carpenter jeans, from now on, need to be reserved for painters and carpenters.  Not for the foreign kid who didn't know any better, and the douche's from small towns who only possess taste in their mouth, even though it's not their fault.  This brings me to my next point, maybe they don't know any better, maybe they are just accepting that what's in stores must be okay to wear.  So I now must go back to the executives at Old Navy, "The Suits" if you will.  We went after Big tobacco for marketing cigarettes to people for years, and not telling us they were bad!  I say it's time to go after Big Old Navy.  As if people didn't know that inhaling black smoke into your mouth wasn't gonna kill you.  If we can sue over that, I say we hit up stores who market pure shit-style to innocent consumers who take it as acceptable and then in turn, clutter my surroundings with horrid visuals.  Enough is enough.  On a lighter, yet related note: Fran Drescher, spokesperson for Old Navy, is still the most irritating person on Earth.  (Ms. Drescher was not able to be reached for comment)

      MMMMM MMMM Sick.  I am trying to eat like my trainer said for me to eat.  Lots of protien and less carbohydrates.  Really?  Why don't you just tell me to take less breaths of air and work on sleeping only 2 hours a week.  Carbohydrates are my friend, and I want them to be in my life (and stomach) forever.  So my chicken is in the background right now, cooking itself to go into my carb-starved tummy.  I wonder if when I meet with him next (tomorrow) he'll somehow be able to tell by looking at me that I shoved half of a cheese pizza in my mouth last night, followed by a bag of chocolate covered raisins at a movie.  All of this happening well past 7pm (which is when I have to have. my last carbohydrate eaten for the day.  Yeah, snacking on "protiens" after7pm isn't fun.  I'm sure it's perfectly socially acceptable to wander into a movie and eat a t-bone or a chicken breast instead of popcorn.  Why not?  Mmm actually that whole-wheat-tortilla-fajita wasn't that bad.  Reminds me of the time I ate dirt on accident with a lil' salsa on the side.  My home phone is ringing but I don't answer it anymore.  I've decided that I will only use my cell phone.  I removed all features such as caller ID, call waiting, and so on from my home line.  I kind of like hearing it ring, knowing someone is trying to get ahold of me and can't.  Call the cell, jackasses.  Did you know that Stacy's Mom Has Got It Going On?  Apparently her milkshake brings all the boys to the yard and they're like "it's better than yours."  It's weird, I know.  I don't really understand why she's got milkshakes in the yard.  I picture them melting pretty fast, afterall it has to be hot outside to want to drink a milkshake.  It's crazy to think that there are people out there with real talent, and then crap makes it onto the radio.  Oh, and then there's Creed.  Yep, Creed.  I'll go there, I'll bring it up.  I'm sure they're talented, more talented than the milkshake bitch, but c'mon.  Watching Creed (that's what I call the lead singer because I don't care to remember his name) fall off cliffs in leather pants is getting old.  Speaking of cliffs, that's one thing I would not do.  Well on purpose anyway, you know the whole bungy thing.  I don't even think I spelled it right, THAT'S how much I don't want to do it.. I can't even bring myself to spell it right.  Do people even bungy jump off of cliffs?  Well regardless, I don't think I'll be trying that anytime soon.  I'm scared of everything.

      The kid's name is BLANKET!!!  Seriously, Michael J., naming your child "Blanket" is about as bad as naming him "Towlie" off of South Park.  Who does things like this?  Blanket Jackson.  That's bound to screw this child up more than just having Michael Jackson as a father will anyway.  Of course, I picture "Blanket" as completely animated.  Naturally he's a blanket with arms and legs, you fill in the blanks.  Speaking of Blankets, ever thought about what a sperm with a lazy eye, wearing a ski hat would look like?  I have!  Only because lauren put that in my mind last night on the phone.  We decided last night that STD sperm look different than regular sperm.  Maybe they swim sideways, kinda.  They probably are all wearing backpacks, but the STD one has got a ski hat on, and a lazy eye.  If that visual doesn't make you wear a rubber, I don't know what will.  Speaking of wearing a rubber, I think that's how the whole STD sperm conversation came from.  We were discussing being seniors '99, and that damn "Wear Sunscreen" song that was kind of scary.  Good, but scary.  His MAIN advice was at the end, above everything in life, was "wear sunscreen."  REALLY?  (me to lauren): "wouldn't better advice be.. 'wear a rubber.'  It's true, think about it, sunburn, or a baby?  Which would you rather have?  At least a sunburn only lasts a few days.  Babies, on the other hand, last until the adoption papers get finalized.  I'll take a sunburn, THANK you.  Ladies and Gentlemen of the class of 2004?  WEAR A RUBBER.

      CHOO CHOO  Oops, I have none.  School starts (for me) tomorrow for this last semester at OU (again, for me) and I already have no motivation.  I can't even make myself go into the living room and figure out if I have a pen in my backpack to take to class tomorrow.  I'm having a difficult time even thinking about making it to my first class, which is at NOON.    *sigh* Just thinking about all of that made me feel tired.  Maybe I'll swing into the "routine" after a few days, but chances are NO.  After "a few days" it will already be my weekend because I only have 3 days of class (and three classes for that matter) this semester.  I assume that right around the time my peers are getting back into the groove of things for the semester, I'll be sleeping until 2pm again because it's MY saturday, even though it's normal people's Friday.  This is gonna rock.  I think I will skip my first day of one of my classes, and let me tell you why, let me just tell you.  This prof. does all of his classes the same.  It would  literally  be a waste of my time to go, get the syllabus (same one he gives out for all the other classes he teaches that I have been a student in), introduce myself, tell people where I'm from, and then go home.  I'll just run along to day #2 of class instead for that one.  OFF TO A GOOD START ALREADY MASON.  Speaking of telling the class where I'm from, I HATE that game.  I hate that in some 'faculty lounge' in some stupid university in some stupid town in America, professors got together and decided that a good thing to do on the first day of school would be to get to know one another.  Guess what, profy, I don't give a sh*t about who is sitting next to me.  Chances are, if they're sitting next to me, I already know them and that's why I chose that seat.  OR I didn't know anyone so I had to sit next to some loser that I DON'T want to know anything about.  So ZIP IT, cholo, I don't want to know that you're from Little Rock and that an interesting fact about you is that you play the flute with your eye.  Prof's LOVE to make you tell an "interesting fact" about yourself.  I enjoy this first-day-of-class game so little that I decided last semester I would just make shit up.  I went ahead and introduced myself, told the class I was from Seattle, and that my interesting fact was that I was born in Buenos Aires, Argentina until my family moved to the United States.  Take THAT.  Gave people who know that I'm not even remotely foreign, a good laugh though.  I can't BELIEVE he had the nerve to give me a "C" later that semester, c'mon I'm not even FROM here, can you blame me for not performing as well as these well acclimated American students?   What will tomorrow's lie be when I'm asked to tell such 'interesting facts' by a professor.  I think a good lie would be "I'm happy to be here" but my disgusted face might give away that fib.  Nah, I probably wont be mendacious at all, and just tell them the norm, that I play a flute with my eye, and that I learned back in Arkansas.. and YES, I DO know the family that Paris Hilton stayed with for the show on Fox.  So back to motivation, I really hope I can get into the routine again and get some stuff accomplished.  The year is already almost half a month OLD!  I better get a move on.  Time to make my to-do list!

      But the soda kind, not the snort kind  Well, I never did the snort kind.  But I did stop drinking cokes a few days ago.  EVEN the diet ones.  I know, it's not like I have been off of it for weeks or anything, but at least it's a start.  Even the diet ones, as I've been told forever and refused to believe, pack on the poundage.  Four days of like zero to maybe 1 diet coke, and I loose five pounds, maybe it's not a coincidence.  Speaking of coke, a Texas-ism, or Texism, or taxidermy, er somethin is to call every soda a "coke."  So pardon me when I say "I stopped drinking cokes," and I really mean "I stopped drinking anything carbonated and caffeinated.  DO YOU KNOW how big of a deal that is for me though?  I LIVE in a coke (again, that's soda) can practically.  What do I do when I'm planning on even driving across town?  Stop at the gas station for a coke.    Oh good, now onto gas stations, and by the way thanks for joining me on this ride around and around and around in circles that is my mind.  The other day I went into the gas station here by my parents house, and paid for my gas, and that of my brother's on the same card.  The lady behind the counter looks out the window and goes "that your brother..?"  (in a very half mexican/half chinese accent, I'm not sure WHAT this woman was).  I was like "yes.." she goes "oh, he break my friend heart."  I'm like "he break your friend heart?  Who your friend."  Anyway, she goes "oh I don't know her name, but he break her heart, they supposed to get marry."  For those of you who don't know,  my brother was engaged to a psycho-bitch for about, oh, 6 months or so.  I hope she stumbles her sorry ass upon this blog-post, SOMEHOW, and reads this.  If you do stumbled upon this, Jessica, make sure to introduce yourself to your "friend" the China-mexican at the Diamond Shamrock on Austin Highway, cool? cause that bitch doesn't know your name, yet claims ya'll be friends.    Anyway, so it was quite funny that the lady at the gas station knew all kinds of information but NOT really.  Apparently her "friend" who will be my brother's ex, and my brother came into this particular gas station all the time.  Apparently that made her friends with the girl, yet she doesn't know her name.  I should drop her a lil' memo, that her 'friend' heart get break because her 'friend' be psycho.  Don't take it personally, gas station lady, but they came in there because the station was convenient to their homes, not cause ya'll were tight.  Shit, I've been in there twice since I've been here in Texas, do you think I am now her friend?  She might be rooting me on to law school by now, letting every lotto ticket purchaser know that her friend is on his way to Oklahoma tomorrow.  HELL, maybe by now she's got kids with my name.  Wait she doesn't know names.  In other news, Whoopi does a slim fast commercial now, and the clever phrase is when she says "if I can be a big loser, than so can you."  WAIT WAIT, Whoop, does that mean that I can literally be as big of a loser as you?  Do I get to have a 'one-hit-wonder' style movie career and a rocky road into the sitcom world with flopping one-liner TV programs?  HELL YEAH I'm gonna buy slimfast.  (note to self:  phone the CEO of Slim Fast and advise him against hiring worthless spokespeople)

      And I'm going to church...  I'm going back to Norman tomorrow, which is a nice thing, because I'm ready to have my own space, things, timing, etc.  I like to be able to do what I want, when I want, oh and have my own car.  Speaking of Norman, I just saw a MORMON commercial.  (they rhymed).  Somehow it always comes back to the mormons.  The advertisement was for the bible, it's a best seller u know, but anyway.  They mentioned NOTHING of the "book of Mormon" which tells me that once u call the number and get the free bible, as if you can't get one in EVERY nightstand across America (thank you Guidions).  That's beside the point, however, back to the commercial.  They mentioned nothing of the Book of Mormon, doesn't that seem odd to you?  It does to me, because you know that some poor sucker is going to get a package in the mail and AH HA!  Low and behold, there's an extra book.  An addendum, if you will, to the written and spoken word of God.  A memo to man, about a giant lake of salt, and something related to Utah.  Gosh, they'd be hard pressed to get me to read that book, seeing as how I can't get myself to read ANY book.  "Marketing Management" was the last book I read, and NOT by choice.  Thanks Professor Hobbs.  I'm watching Family feud on the Game Show Network, which is quite possibly one of the greatest game shows ever.  ENTIRE families of people get together for one cause, to guess survey answers and win some cash and prizes.  My family has a hard time uniting on a decision for dinner, let alone "What is the most common New Years Resolution."  By the way that WAS a question just now, and this jackass just said "Save money?"  SERIOUSLY dude, everyone knows that it is "loose weight."  P.S.- the number one answer WAS loose weight, thank you very much.  Where was I when the Wezigowitz family from Topeka, KS needed me?  Oh, I was in the womb, cause this show was filmed in 1980.  I can't believe it's already been three weeks of being back home.  I'm quite ready to get back to my own routine, but not exactly thrilled about the scholastic endeavors I will be participating in.  I will comfort myself in knowing that I only have THREE classes left to take in college, ever.  Somehow that doesn't help the stinging reality that I will more than likely be in school three more years for law.  Still, though, it's exciting to be almost finished.    Oh look, one hour and counting until I have to leave to go to Church on a Saturday night.  WEEE!  Trust me, I could be a LOT more bitter.  I literally just deleted my previous entry, as it was too bitter for posting.  KICKASS, another episode of the FAMILY FEUD.  How irritating- it's not the original, or the most recent, it's some very strange 1989 version.  There are LOTS of shoulder pads present, and bad haircuts.  Most importantly, though, is of course that there is LOTS of cheesy expressions.  When you introduce your family on this show, you apparently have to have an adjective in front of their name.  "Next to me is my LOVELY sister Sheila.  Then my great brother John, and my fatty wife Brenda.."  Well none of them said fatty, but wouldn't that be more fun?  I think so.  On a final note, 8 of the schools I applied to, have now requested my file from LSDAS.  They all will request it eventually, but it's just scary to think that all of this is in the works, and they're getting my information and files processed.  SCURRY.

      Who, in their right mind, posts comments in Portuguese?    This post will be officially dedicated to Lauren.  Not just because she prods me to continue this blogging, which I do appreciate because sometimes I feel so un-funny (like un-pretty of TLC almost), but also because funny shit just happens when we talk!  Shit that needs to be discussed, personified, evaluated, laughed about, and most of all mocked.  So someone got on her blog-posting-extravaganza (and for anyone who is reading this and wants to get more insight into just how funny things are in "lola's" mind, take a look at www.ellekinzy.blogspot.com).  Anyway, fragments galore here, but someone got on her blogspot and posted a comment in Portuguese.  We deciphered, after much altavista.com translation work, that it was something related to voting for governments that are corrupt or something.  What the hell?  I don't know how they do things down there in Rio, but we do the ENGLISH up here.  Hence our posting are IN English.  Another funny thing, everyone I know seems to be dealing with credit card fraud lately.  Okay, so everyone means two people, but one of them is lauren.  I think it's really ballsy of someone to take a credit card from someone and then use it at places.  This is 2004 people, this can be traced.  I'm scared of so many things that are so much less serious than credit card fraud that I can't even imagine running into a store and racking up a bill, knowing that it's OBVIOUSLY going to show up on someone's statement, and then the bank will  be after me!  I like, however, to envision her credit card as taking a vacation.  I loved the visuals that were invoked after reading her post (again, www.ellekinzy.blogspot.com), of her card taking it's own lil' trip to Texas.  Somehow the card has arms and legs (the arms and legs are a dark blue) with lil' 4 fingered (not five) puffy gloves and white booties on its feet.  Very Mickey Mouse, circa 1929, but IN FULL color, not that Steamboat Willie bull-shit, horn-tooting, African-American looking Mickey.  (That's not racial, he was on a paddle boat going down the MISSISSIPPI, and he was black, so shut up).  Anyway, so the card that says "ARVEST" across is, would probably be driving a convertible or some sort.  Something rented, and something definitely red.  Probably not like, loaded or anything, but a convertible nonetheless.  You have to keep in mind, this card has never had freedom of its own, so it heads SOUTH.  100% like the movies, on its way to the border.  It's NO surprise that lauren said the charges came from gas stations (hello, remember, the card IS in a convertible afterall).  I bet that mother f*er is on its way to Guadalajara.  HEY!  I'm between Oklahoma and Mexico RIGHT now while I'm in San Antonio!  Lauren, do you want me to hang out on the side of I35 for a while and see if I spot a miniature red (i'm assuming here) convertible cruising by?  I'll get that lil' bastard and have his car repo-ed FAST.  In fact, I saw a Jaguar getting towed off today (I'm assuming it was being repo-ed) while at lunch today as a matter of fact.  DO YOU THINK it was him?  There's no way he could reach the pedals though, so I'm gonna stick with the fact that it was a LITTLE car.  Very Stuart Little of him.  Next thing you know he'll be making friends with a cat, flying around in a remote control plane, etc and so on.  Speaking of flying around in a plane, my dad just called and needs a ride home from the airport, so I'm off to get him.  I'll ask if he saw anything suspicious out the window of the plane while flying back from Dallas.  Possibly a red bi-plane of peculiar size.    Updates to follow.  I'm gonna go smoke a little more crack-cocaine apparently.

      Yeah, we're losing pretty bad in the national championship.  *sigh*  What else is there, let's see.  My day was ridiculous.  I did nothing all day, but I enjoyed every bit of it.  It is so weird that every single semester is a different 'theme' of sorts.  I have noticed that this trend has been present since day ONE of my college education.  Without fail, I loose a friend, or gain a new friend, or have a different path of life each semester.  I have a large life issue, obstacle to overcome, or big exciting event each 6 months almost like clockwork.  The whole environment changes for me each semester.  Things will even be going along just as they were the previous semester, but without fail, it will change by the 3rd week of the new semester, if not much sooner.  ODD really, odd.  I wonder what this semester's theme will be.  Hopefully closure as I leave the state, and a lot of good times.   I really want to strive for meaningfulness in my life.  I'm not sure why, but lately I just have really desired to have meaningful times, people, and events in my life from here on out.  I think it's possibly because I am entering my last semester at Oklahoma, and I want to make it count.  Not so much in the ways I always want to "make it count" with grades, etc.  Of course I always want to and have wanted to have meaningfulness in my life, but this is something different.  As I grow older, I find it harder and harder to want to entertain anything else besides true, honest, caring, sound friendships.  I also want to give of myself more in my surroundings, to people I care about.  I want to be able to open myself a bit more to those that I care about, and feel secure with those individuals.  I want to take advantage of my surroundings, do things that I want to do, etc.  I want to better myself.   Oh, I don't even know what I'm trying to say.  I need organization. I want to pay off each debt I have, streamline bills, reorganize my life, establish relationships with the people I want to take with me when I leave OU.  I can't physically take them with me, so I want to make sure that they are an important part of my future.  Yay, new beginnings are fun.  Who knows what the theme to this semester will be, but I am hoping that it is one of substance and fun.

      Well, it does.  I'm watching Feris Bueller's Day Off on.. shoot, I don't know, probably TNT.  TNT loves movies like this.  I do too.  I love TNT.  TNT loves me.  I love them for lovin' me and they love me for lovin' them, and we LOVE each other.  Oh good, a comercial for Aaron Neville's gospel album is on.  Mr. Neville should be a muppet.  Why can't I EVER think of him without thinking of Linda Ronstadt?  I don't know.  In fact, as the tune went.. I don't know much, but I know I love... TNT!  Seriously though, my back.. hurtin' real bad.  I'm not too sure why, but I've tried everything.  Hot bath, hot shower, laying on the floor, laying on my stomach, drinking acid.  NOTHING seems to work.    Good, FB's Day Off is back on.  I'm so glad.  It just makes me want to move to Chicago THAT much more.  Not because FB's Day Off shows me a side of Chicago I just really want to see, or that I think I'll steal my dad's car and parade around Chicago all day while skipping sophmore-year english, but just because it's IN Chicago.  I guess it just reminds me, once again, that I love it there.  Oh SH*T!!!  Cameron just found out that his dad's car has a BUNCH extra miles on it.  DAMNIT!  He is SOOO screwed.  okay okay okay, I wont give anything else away, you'll just have to go see this movie for YOURSELF.  I think it's still in theaters, who knows.  I ran into this girl from high school when I was at dinner with my parents.  It is somewhat odd to see people that I went to school with forever, and hear about how they are in 'careers' now.  CRAZY to me, because I still see them in, like, a yearbook photo or something.  I guess I also forget, because I am still in school myself.  DAMN losing credits for transfering schools, DAMN taking my sweet time! haha.  Oh well, I refused to bust my arse in order to graduate in December, just to sit around for 7-8 months before I could start law school anyway.  So actually it worked out better to just have 3 classes ahead of me this coming semester.  WOO.  I WISH they were easy easy easy classes though.  OOOOH!!  Cameron just killed the car.  DAMN, sorry I will stop that.  Go see the movie for yourself.  *THIS JUST IN*  Britney Spears got married.  This report is unconfirmed, but you heard it here first.  That hooker got married in Vegas.  Talk about a decision that will not be a lasting one.  I don't even know who the guy is as of yet (I'm not FoxNews here people) and I STILL can tell you that miss B.S. (wow her initials spell out what I think of her career) isn't going to be a lasting wifey-wife-wife with her own reality show a-la Jessica Simpson/Nick Lache.  How retarded.  HA I love it.  I am SO bored.  No one I know is in town anymore, my brother no longer lives at home, my parents are asleep, I have nothing to do and no where to go.  I don't even have a car.  Speaking of cars (i'm all over the place), my mom ran her's off the road today and into a curb. It's weird to see a car drive straight, but be pointed a few degrees to the left.  That's what her's does now.  I should take the loaner car out for a spin right now.  That'd be fun.  However, I can just see what would happen.  I'd be off the road, and into a curb myself in NO time.  Murphy's damn law.  Who IS that Murphy character, and why is he always causing us so much grief.    I really have nothing else to say so I'm closing. I'm not even performing a spell-check on this piece of shit entry.

      yes, happy new of the year to one and all.    The year came in with a bang, and thankfully none of that included an arab doing anything with a plane.  Just the bang of fireworks, and blows to the head *mine to be specific*  Oh, these things happen.  Toothless, I may be, but resolutions I do have, they are as follows:  1)  get into law school (kinda out of my hands at this point, as I already applied to them all) 2)  get into shape (how cliche can we all be here, but I'm SERIOUS) 3)  hang onto all my teeth 4)  try to better myself through orginization and discipline 5)  have meaningful and rewarding relationships with those I encounter and/or already know 6)  enjoy my last 5 months in Oklahoma  I'm very tired.  Goodnight.

      These lyrics reminded me of you during your hard times that I was never able to be there for, and remind me of me during the times you have, by default, signed up to be there for.  I know you've been allocated a friendship that has required you to now be signed up for things you never signed on for originally.  I am, however, realizing that friendships are just that.  If a friend isn't going to be there for me through the ups and downs of the cards we're all dealt in life, I don't want any part of said friendship.  Likewise, with your cards.. I'll always be there to help u with that hand of life's poker.  "There's nothing I could say to make you try to feel okay, and nothing you could do to stop me feeling the way I do.  And if the chance should happen that I never see you again, just remember that I'll always love you.  I'd be a better person on the other side, I'm sure.  You'd find a way to help yourself and find another door, to shrug off minor incidents, make us both feel proud, I just wish I could be there to see you through. "  "You always were the one to make a stand out in a crowd, though every once upon a while your head was in a cloud.  There's nothing you could ever do to make me feel let down, and remember that I'll always love you."  The good news is, I plan on being there to see you through.  Thank you for understanding stuff, thank you for being patient, thank you for not thinking differently of me through my faults, truths, and short comings.  Thank you for knowing that I trust you, and thank you for being trustworthy.  You are a blessing to my life.  Never forget it.  Never lose sight of the fact that I would not let you see the hand of cards I was dealt and want so much to be a part of your poker game as well, if I did not love you dearly.

      This letter was written in class, by me, in a fit of pure boredom.  Numbering six pages, the letter was written in sloppy blue ink on college ruled paper.  Please keep in mind, references to my handwriting are not edited out.  I have nothing else to post, so I might as well post something that I did in fact write.  Here we go.  Dearest Lola-  I'm writing you a letter, very 7th grade style, from class.  I've been in here, oh, 5 minutes and i'm already so bored that it hurts.  I also have a test in here tonight.  I guess I could be studying for it right now, but whatever.  It's okay, I had pizza for lunch.  how annoying would it be if the ONLY way to keep in touch over distances was through written mail?  I'd lose touch with everyone.  There is NO way that my instant gratification mind would be able to handle the world of Pony Express.  I can barely handle Federal Express.  "Express" my ass, waiting until TOMORROW to get something sucks.  I got rejected from one of my "long-shot" schools today.  That felt cool.  I knew I probably wouldn't get in, but it still was like "awwh, awwh" and then I had to pee.  This professor has cleverly decided (there are lots of d's in the word decided) to make the exam/rape happen @ the end of this 3 hour hell.  Clever man!!!  Now no one can slip out after the exam and be spared the flaming hot hades that is "Business strategy and Policy."  I'm really sorry I never found you a cool postcard in Colorad-ho.  They are obviously NOT a creative bunch.  A ton of stupid postcards with mountains on them.  BOO!  We get that there are mountains, now show us the snow-bunnies!  So I've decided I might MAKE you a postcard. That would be funner and more personal all at once.  We'll see if I follow through with that by the end of this letter.  (ps- by "make" I mean draw, not construct out of purchased materials from Michaels).  I like shoes.  I really do.  Some people in here have some kickin' kicks.  We get a participation grad in this class.  I think I already forfeit those points.  Eh, give them to someone else, someone who gave a damn, somebody more like myself, and theseeee foolish gamessss are tearing me apart.. oh wait, sorry.  Jewel took over my body for a min.  Like Whoopi in "Ghost."  When Jewel took over my body, my tooth was fucked up and I think I flashed the professor and maybe made out with some random people.  Everyone enjoyed.  I feel like Meg and Hamilton Swan listening to Harlan Pepper right now as this boring class drones on.  Seriously where at ethe cameras?  Where's the candid fuckin camera?  Cause this is a JOKE, and it's been only like 15 minutes.  I want to throw something at someone.  Preferably at someone wearing a date-party shirt, OR someone wearing carpenter pants.  OR that kid (take your pick) that I hate for no reason.  There are some Kappas in here, and 7/8 of them suck REAL bad.    Aren't you excited that I have cable?  I'm kinda disappointed, honestly, because there is nothing on ever.  I guess since I used to have it ALL for free, now it seems like I Have zero channels.  Good news:  Where The Heart Is will surely be on soon.  I thought of you last night because Comedy Central was having a MadTV marathon.  After that much generic Mac&Cheese, anyone would be sick.  Want to go get trashed soon?  Like, take-a-cab-home-trashed?  I do!  I want to have a night of drunken, dubious, crazed, drinking that requires a safe ride (and not a DUI).  The professor just mentioned L.L. Bean.  It comes full circle to Hamilton Swan.  Thank GOD for catalogs.  By the by, sorry about the handwriting.  I dont' know how you're even reading this.  I dont care either, this is therapeutic to me.    I need to run, bike, or something. I'm getting hefty even with a trainer.  I'm basically treading water it seems.  Granted I've been to the gym like a total of 5 times.  God I'm too instant-oriented.    There is a sign (very make-shift looking) at the front of the room that reads:  "Maximum Occupancy: 48."  Is this fuckin' Applebees??  DO you think someone will bring me nachos?  I doubt it too.  What if I ordered a pizza to be delivered to my class?  I wonder how that would be received by Captain Bore (professor).  When the cable man came today, I was stone-cold sleeping.  I bet that was fun for him to have my weird looking self, half naked, answer the door all confused.  There's a weird door @ the front of the room and I want to know where it goes.  It's like one of those swinging doors seen in many restaurant kitchens across our great nation.  I kind of want something odd to pop out of there, like a band of marching clowns, have them march around the room, and then go right back through the door as if nothing.  Stranger things have happened.. not sure what though.  The girl in front of me just totally fucked up her pony tail.  Should I tell her?  It's irritating me.  It's all ratty and shit now.  I'm now playing the "who would i trade with" game.  There's only one guy I think I'd trade with in here.  I'm still gonna say I'm way more better, but he's got me on the arms and dark hair.  Otherwise, yep, i'm better than the others in here.  Hang on, I"m gonna play for you too.  K, yeah, you win in here too, trust me.  Okay new pen, new class, new day.  It's Tuesday now.  I feel like butt hole today.  Totally congested and just what.  I'm in Marketing Channels now, hoping I dont get called on for anything.  This pen SUCKS as much as this day does.  What a cool coincidence.  It's funny that I've written you a novel.  Maybe I should just keep going for years like a journal dedicated to you.  Like Anne Frank wrote to "Kitty" but you're REAL.  Maybe Kitty was real too.  But then again, who names their kid "Kitty."  (A Jew apparently).  Wasn't there something all risque about Anne Frank?  Like didn't she talk about being a lesbian or something?  I swear I heard that somewhere.  I'm pissed at this pen!  It was free, I can totally see why now too.  Whenever I have my own corporation, I"m going to give away GOOD pens.  Mont Blanc pens made of pure gold that spell check things as you write somehow.  I'll remember this when I'm in a cubicle somewhere.  Oh Lola, only 30 more minutes of pure hell.  Aren't you glad you're not in school anymore and can you believe that I still am??  Well on that note, I will close.  I will probably never follow-through on mailing this.  Love, Mason

      (oh, and the open container)  SO, last night was a ton of fun, and definitely a learning experience.  Everything went as planned.  Dinner was good, movie was great, company was enjoyable as expected.  The wine, and OH the wine.  It was good.  Lola falls asleep on the couch, so I decide that I would drive her home, after having consumed at least 6 glasses of wine.  A feat that had been successfully accomplished countless times throughout my life.  We gathered her things (including the remaining wine left her in bottle) and headed out.  Things I learned last night:  1.)  Apparently when you turn a corner, it needs to be at a RIGHT angle (since that's possible)  2.)  If you do not make said right angle, you will be pulled over by a Norman Police Officer, even though you're already in the apartment complex of your final destination's parking lot.  3.)  When a cop sees a bottle of wine in the passenger seat, he will automatically make you "step out of the vehicle"  4.)  When said officer makes you follow a pen with your eyes and not with you head, try not to soil yourself and also try to concentrate HARD!  5.)  If a cop asks you if you have an open container in the vehicle, say yes, because chances are he already saw it when he first came to the window (I said no), and he will then go search the car for it to see if you were lying.  6.)  Even if your trusty friend covers the bottle with a jacket, the bastard cop will still find it.  6.)  Being over the limit and "arrestable" doesn't necessarily mean you will be arrested.  7.)  I am a lucky son of a bitch because I now have a ticket/warning for transporting and open container, rather than a night in jail and a police record.  8.)  And least importantly, when you have an open container and they find it: THEY TAKE YOUR BOTTLE OF WINE!  Rat Bastards!  So, summary and wrap-up:  Mister cop was actually nice in the end and used scare tactics.  No breathalizer = he only assumed I was "over the limit,"  but wanted to make sure we knew we were naughty for driving.  Thankfully I was giving someone a ride home, which looks good, and not like I was hot-rodin' around town.  I could have been arrested, but somehow, somewhere, someone was smiling down on us, and I'm a free man.  Thank you mister Norman cop, enjoy your wine, and I'll enjoy my freedom, and we'll call it even.  All in all, we are very lucky.  What an experience!  I had a blast lauren!  "I fought the law and the law.. well, we tied"

        how is it that it's slushy outside    If it's going to snow, snow.  If it's going to rain, rain.  Don't do this rain/snow/sleet mixture that just makes it look like a 7-11 slush when all the flavor is sucked out of it.    The good news is, tonight I get to watch Chicago (one of my favorite movies) with Lauren (one of my favorite peoples) and drink wine (one of my favorite beverages) and sit next to a fire (one of my favorite natural disasters).   The goal of the day, however, is to make this apartment not look like a laundry basket.  In order to allow someone else to cross the threshold of my door, I need to definitely clean up a tad (hamilton).  Speaking of Tad Hamilton, thanks for bringing it up.  I did see that movie with my grandmother.  She thought it was cute, and that the main character makes "comments like mason makes."  Which was funny.  I think she's amused by my sarcasm, that I don't even mask when I'm around family.  I want to be old and amused by everything.  Wait just kidding, I don't.  I'm young and ammused by everything, that's better.  I have NOTHING to write about.  NOT A THING.  I'm going to go to the gym now, and buy some fire wood for the extravaganza that will be my evening of wine and movie!  Ciao bellos.

       I'm GOIN' TO LAW SCHOOL!!   Pardon, to all my fans by the way, for not posting sooner (boomer sooner).  I have been out of town, and just plain lazy.  I got home tonight from visiting family in Denver, fun fun.  I went to check my mail (snail mail) and got my first reply back from one of the law school's I applied to.  I GOT IN!  WOO!  I'm ecstatic.  Somehow I feel like the work and effort was not in vain now.    I'm definitely not naive enough to think that all the letters I get will be acceptance letters, but WOW what a great feeling to know that if I want to,  I can go to law school!  I tend to have a that lingering fear that no matter what, everyone else is more qualified, I have no business applying to law school, I'll never get in, admissions committees will laugh at me, etc.  This was a huge boost.  My first reply.. and it's an acceptance.  It isn't my TOP choice in school/location, but it's a thrilling feeling to get my first reply and have it be an acceptance.  *sigh* I feel very relieved to know that I can go to law school now.  (thanks for sharing in my joy and allowing me to have that moment, I'm very much smiling still at this present time).   On a different note (yet still related to academics):  I'm skipping school tomorrow.  It's official, I've already decided.  I will not be going to class tomorrow because fankly, Scarlet, I hate International Marketing anyway.   So have you heard about the chicken flu?  Yeah, apparently there's chickens and they have the flu, and they're Asian, and they're gonna spread it to humans if we're not careful and it could be worse than the Plague and Joan River's plastic surgery COMBINED!  Yes, that bad.  I don't so much feel like being killed off by a CHICKEN flu would be my idea of a credible way to die for anyone.  How do these things come about anyhow?  One day a chicken goes outside without his rain booties on, his webbed feet get cold, and he develops a cough?  *BAM* Next thing you know, 50 million people are sneezing because one guy in Taiwan let his pet chicken sneeze on him.  I hate that guy.  First he spread SARS, now he's letting his chicken give everyone the flu.  I think it's high time we come up with a flu to send over to that side of the world.  Maybe like.. hamster flu or something.  They're always developing something in the throws of their dirty society, ridin' around on their rickshaws, wearing surgical masks, stuffing themselves into subways, and boarding planes to LAX while carrying viruses with them.  I say.. lets give them Hamster-Pox.    Why did the chicken cross the road?  To get away from the hamster-pox virus... k, I'm worthless for writing anything that makes sense, it's late.  NITE!

      For one, I hate Iraqis.  Sorry to all my Iraqi fans, but I hate you.  I didn't USED to hate you, but then you started being a dirty race in my eyes.  I used to be SO "live and let live" in my outlook.  I guess I just never realized that you people actually hate ME for no reason.. so now it's MY turn, only I actually have a reason, unlike your "reason" which is hating my views of "freedom" (for the record, I PERSONALLY would never have harmed you, pressed my opinions on you or hated you for not agreeing with my freedom-oriented views, because afterall, I didn't want you over in my country anyway, we're all full up here.  STAY in your country and make oil for me, and rape women, I don't care).  BUT NOW, now I have a reason, and it's been building for a couple years *ahem, 9/11* and I'm tired of it.  I  Just read a story in the news about an ambush in Fallujah, Iraq that killed NON-military Americans, and the townspeople dragged the American's bodies through the streets, mangled them, hung their corpses from a bridge, and rejoiced proclaiming that Falluja is the cemetery of Americans.  Come on down to Oklahoma you piece of shit, I'll show you a cemetery.  I'll show it to you slowly, and I'll show it to you with my bare hands.  I think I could find a bridge to hang you from, the Highway 9 bridge is just a short walk from my door.  Anyhow, I hope everyone is pissed now, it was my goal.  :)  You see, I am a caring person, I don't wish harm on anyone, but provoke me, hate my 'people' for no reason, kill my countrymen, wish harm on me without knowing me, and hate me for beliefs I would never wish for you to share, and it's war.  Keep it up Iraq, and burn in hell when you're done.  I only hope the leaders of MY country assist in getting you to said hell a tiny bit faster.  Have a good day!:)  ***Disclaimer:  I know that "me hating an entire race, based on one news story, is as bad as people who hate all Americans (even those innocent) based on certain beliefs."  I am not seriously hating an entire race, but this blog expresses my views, beliefs, and feelings at the time of posting them.  I am pissed, I do have feelings, and I have very real emtions just as any human being would.  Much love to my friendly Iraqi friends.  I have plenty of love for all kind and decent human beings.  My views have simply been hardened towards others, whereas before I had love for anyone in the world until they proved themselves not worthy.  I now feel as though I am hated for things I can not personally even control, such as how the country I was born into intereacts in world affairs.  With that said, don't get your panties in a wad.***

      ..... Not the song  But chances ARE that if you read my posts, you read  urlLink lauren's blog too .  If not, then you're stupid.  Anyway, back to the heart of the story.. I'm taking a study break and just discovered that LOLA posted some fantastic-fun pictures from the other night that we spent together.  I posted about that night (see post from Sat, March 20th) and so I think I will share the link to her picture page she created.  It is devoted solely to that evening, and a few tidbits of information related to how we became Friends Forever Graduation Song by Vitamin C, etc and so on.  If you know what I'm referring to, you are laughing.  If you don't, you're stupid AND confused.  Anyhow, here is the link.   urlLink TAKE A LOOK .  Such a nice job Lola!  Enjoy the pictures, leave a comment for me, and get off my blog.  :)

      K.  Things are going to be okay.  Life is full of minor set-backs and it seems that my life is no exception to this bastard-rule.  Thankfully, the problem is easily (through effort) solved.  For a split second (and by split second I mean throwing up last night until 6am because I was so anxious) I thought I wasn't going to graduate!  HAHAHAHA.. whew.  Glad that's not the case.  Now it's time for a little siesta.  Then it will be time to start the living hell that will be the next two months of my life.  Pure, living, academic hell.  Care to join me in my white-hot-tormented end of the semester?  I'll save you a seat.

      :)  I had so much fun.  From the get-go, it's always a blast to go have drinks on a beautiful night and sit outside.  The company was good and the weather was amazing.    Somehow, I ended up having one of those nights where the drunkenness hits you like a ton of bricks, ALL at once.  There we are, closing the bar down, feeling nice, and everything is right in the world.  Suddenly, LOLA can't walk.  I'm thinking in my head "whew, poor thing, I'm glad I'm here to take her home."  I drive her, get her settled, but while she is using the restroom, MY ton of bricks hits.  I find myself in her bed, fully clothed, passing out.  Next thing I know, we're spooning in bed.  Ahhhh, so relaxing.  That is until the flat spins hit.  "uh oh, be right back" i mumbled as I headed to the facilities.  You know the rest of the story.  The only real reason I got up to leave after that, was because I remembered there was leftover pizza in my fridge at home that i simply HAD to consume.  What a great night anyway though.  As SOON as I get around to it, I will post some pictures form the fun night.  Zac, me, lauren, the randoms at the table next to us who joined in on our conversation.  It was fun.  I don't remember who those people were or what their names were, but I do recall that they were from Pauls Valley, Oklahoma and somehow knew lauren and zac's step mother.  Small world.  Small state.  SMALL hangover.  Goals for the day:  Don't shrink my fantastic new Paper Denim jeans that are in the dryer right now.  Do take a shower.  Don't forget to study for my capstone test Monday.  Do go look at new cars in about 30 min.  Don't drink anything alcoholic today.  Do return the 7 (i'm not lying) phone calls I have received in the last hour.  Don't return the other 2 of people I didn't want to talk to anyway.  Do wrap this entry up because it's boring.

      How would we all feel about a little "about me" type section?  You know, a link to a page that contains some pictures, maybe updated at times, some fun stuff posted about myself, etc?  Yes? No? None of the above?  I might work on that. I might also not work on it and allow it to be like folding laundry: something I say I am going to do in my spare time but never seem to get around to caring about.

      La Luna.  I loved sitting on their patio last night having Mexican food under the trees and strung (randomly) lights.  The weather here in tornado alley is BEAUTIFUL lately and spring is slowly setting up camp.  Cool, breezy evenings after delightfully warm sunny days are making me smile.  I'm not quite ready for the heat of summer, but this will be a fantabulicious spring-time, I can tell already.  I'm excited to clean off my balcony one last time while I live here, so that I can sit and enjoy the monster thunderstorms as they roll in across the plains.  That gave you the visual that my balcony overlooks fields of amber grains, didn't it?  It looks over grassy yard, the parking lot, other apartment buildings in my complex, etc.  STILL, though, it's a wonderful thing to sit outside with a blanket, good company, and more than likely a lil' alcohol during a raging Oklahoma thunderstorm.  I will truly miss the weather here during spring when I move.  Windows open, cool breezes blowing inside, curtains waving, Gary England (meterorologist) cutting into local programming to let me know that Cleveland county is again under a Tornado warning.  I love the rumble in the distance and the smell of the breeze when suddenly a tinge of cool graces the air and you can feel the dampness of an approaching downpour.   I can't wait for the storms to come!  Plus, the calm afterwards is always a freshly cleansed day.  God bless cool weather.  It's definitely nap-time for me.  I had a long long long long night last night.  6:30am comes pretty quick when you're having a good time.  ("For a good time call mason" kinda good time, of course).  Jk.  or am i?  But anyhow, then I woke up at 10am with a throbbing sore mouth from my recent bout with the dentist, and was flat out of Motrin IB.  Off to my medicine cabinet I went, digging through my old shaving kit to find some Hydrocodone leftover from oral surgery last May.  PERFECT!  I popped one of those suckers and went back into a coma.  30 minutes later the phone rings, and Kimberly wanted me to go run errands and go to lunch.  I am SO glad that I did.  Driving with the windows down, listening to the radio was fantastic today.  The weather was "good to be alive" weather, and lunch was perfection.  I'm excited to have finally stopped into the Grapevine cafe.  May I dine there again for that scrumptious sandwich AGAIN and AGAIN and AGAIN!  I was a bit stoned the whole time, considering I had taken some pretty heavy meds and slept about 4.5 hours, but still, I'd do it all over again.  Can't beat a great lunch, Hobby Lobby, Albertson's Grocery Store and a large Diet Cherry Coke from Classic 50's, now can you?  I dare you.. try to beat it, you cocky bastard.  Speaking of bastards, I need to go to bed.  Before I go, however, I would like to share that recently (today actually) someone reached this very weblog by searching the following phrase in Google.com: "Zoloft ecstasy MadTV."  ROCK ON for that.  I just kinda wonder what they were really looking for.  I love the tracking software.  It's nice to know how someone got to you weblog in the first place.  I wish, whoever that was, had left a comment for me.  Next time you stop by, randoms, say hi.  Ya'll come back now, hear?

      Oh my poor drugged friend.    45 min after he goes into the dental office, he comes out confused and not able to walk, mumbling something about how I am golden and he owes me one.  I'm like "dude, no need, afterall I didn't take your wisdom teeth out, Dr. Whatshisface did."  But I like being owed shit anyway, so more power to that.  (jk, u owe me nothing good buddy).  WEED EATING- it's what I've been doing with my life.  I've been pulling up, ripping out, and discarding the weeds that don't need to be around.  Be them people (*ahem* former "friends" who I now realize were not worth my time if 5 min. after I'm out of their sight they have no balls to continue contact with me - not to mention their asinine behavior and attitudes, but that's a whole different story.) or situations, schedules, etc that aren't healthy for me.  I like doing this yard work of life.  It's rewarding to me.  In the last couple of months I have seen things in my "yard" flourish because of it.  When the things that drag you down are gone, suddenly new things can take their place that are rewarding and fulfilling.  The meaning of friendship has really been shown to me lately and I am so thankful for it.  I realize who the people are in my life that MATTER to me, and care about me 100%, and I know that I care about them the same way.  I love that.  Some friends (back to the *ahem* friends) that were in my past were simply good-time friends it seems.  When things are rough, they disappear.  Selfishly claiming no fault because, afterall, I can just as well stay in contact with them.  I never want to have people like that in my life again.  When I'm hurting over something, I want to know my friends will be there for me just as I would be there for them, no questions asked.    In the past several weeks alone, I have realized the rewards of being there for people I care about and the bond that it forms.  Not because it makes me feel so good to have been there, but rather because I go out on a limb for certain people because I KNOW that they would and will do the same for me.  In thinking back on these mentioned friendships of convenience and selfishness, I am just as guilty I assume for sticking around.  I am so glad to not be in that place anymore.  No one is perfect but bonds of friendship and trust are important to me, and I am happy to understand those things now, to be proud of the relationships I have built and am building and most importantly surround myself with the people that are going to have the balls to call me on a bad day.  Be in contact with individuals who are as concerned with my well being as I am with theirs.    *sigh* so much is changing and so much is great inside of those changes that I can't stop smiling about it.  Life is exciting right now and a little scary too.  Scary like when you ride a rollercoaster, it's just going to be fast, fun, and will leave me pissing myself with excitement.  I hope when I get off this ride I look back and say "I wanna go again!"  Spring break is almost over, and I seem to be packed with plans.  I seem to have something going on everyday followed by EVERY night.  SO much for studying over the break.  I don't mean to neglect you baby, by the way, you know I love you.  I'm glad we're having plans on Friday!  :)  Can you believe I just called you baby?  Reminds me of former roommate.  Mmmmm Mullets.  Speaking of plans on Friday, I'm pumped.  I know that they might not work out, in case you need to spend time with the brother, but if they do, I'm thrilled.  I want to hang out with him too!  Why don't I just write you a personal e-mail because this is what this has turned into.  Sorry,all you others.  If you'd start leaving me some damn comments I'd respond to them and maybe YOU TOO could get included in the festivities of my posting.  Shout out to Elise ("shout out?"  K, Mason, thanks for the TRL moment) for reading my blog and commenting from time to time.  You rock for that.  I know we have only shared one beer together in our lives, but it's nice to know you're around and following the days of my life.    This is seriously going no where.  I need to rest up before I go to my trainer.  Let the pain begin.  Ciao

      Just couldn't care any less @ this point.  I just couldn't.  It's not a bad thing, necessarily, in my opinion either.  I'm just tired of caring about the things that don't matter or get in the way of a nice, normal, healthy situation.  Selfish as it may be, get the f*ck out of my face if you're causing me UN-needed stress.  (The key word here is UN-needed.  Bring it the f*ck on if it's productive or relevant, we'll knock it out, deal with it, solve it, etc.  Otherwise, shut your face, and back away).  *whew*  Now that I have that off of my chest, we can move on.  I saw a bearded lady today.  It was great, I was getting my tires changed in my car (because apparently if I'm going to sell the car in the next couple of weeks, the tires need to have tread, or some shit) and this HUGE lady in the tire shop had a BEARD.  This was no 5 o'clock shadow either.  She had FULL stubble.  How does such a thing happen?  I am sad that she was somehow cursed with a man-gene that caused her to grow more of a beard than I can.  *sigh* I'm sorry bearded lady, please don't be sad.  Hang in there.  Tomorrow, I take a friend to have his wisdom teeth pulled.  Poor friend.  I don't like that idea, because I know how horrible it was when I had my SIX wisdom teeth pulled.  Yes, six.  Why would anyone have six wisdom teeth?  Mason did for some odd reason and they were all up in his sinus cavities and embedded in the bones of his jaw.  I wonder why I am speaking of myself in third person.  Anyway, what a shitty week that was.  Hell, I can't complain, at least I'm not a bearded lady.  Well, it's time for me to go to bed now.  It has been a long day filled with new and exciting adventures, new people, and bearded women.  WomAn really, not womEn, seeing as how there was only one of them (I hope).    6 weeks until I graduate! WOO.  Moving to follow, so so so so so excited.  G'night ya'll.

      Things just seem to be going that way.  I can't really explain it, but they (things) just seem to be GOING good.  I like what's happening, I like what's been happening, and I like where it's going.  I almost feel like I should be continuously knocking on wood, crossing my fingers, or possibly not verbalizing that things are going good, just in case.  I hate that feeling, but sometimes it's weird when things seem to be going great.. it's like "wait, what bad stuff is about to happen."  I like the sound of certain people's voices.  Some people's voices make me smile.  Some people can talk and just soothe your entire soul.    Acid reflux SUX.  Is that another word for heartburn?  I think it is, so I hope I'm not using it wrong, but anyway heartburn/acid reflux is a bitch and I'm having it right now.  Tomorrow is going to be a FANTASTIC day, I've already decided.  My plans for tomorrow are going to rock, and end with me getting trashed by 4pm.    Cheers lads.

      Oh it's spring break and I'm glad.  I'm glad that I don't have to do anything, and I can just sit here and watch WGN Chicago News at noon, and just enjoy myself.  THREE DATES in TWO weeks.  that's all I gotta say.  It's dreeaaaaaaaary today, and I'm enjoying it.  I'd love to just crawl back into my bed and take a niceeeee long nap.  I don't think I will though, because I've got things to do.  ARG  I just got up from my comfy spot on the love seat in order to take out some laundry that beeped at me, and my dog stole my spot.  I don't have the heart to move him so now I'm sitting on the floor.  My apartment is so obsessively clean right now that I'm just thrilled.  I spaz, from time to time, and clean the hell out of this place.  So much so that it's spotless now.  I just keep looking around thinking "why don't I keep it like this all the time, it actually looks GOOD."    That commercial is on for Zoloft right now.  You know the one where the lil' white blob gets sad and it starts raining on his little blob-self.  Then, all of a sudden a butterfly, or some shit, comes and coaxes the blob into following him to meet up with other blobs who do not suffer from blob-depression.  My dog barked when the commercial came on, I'm thinking he's trying to tell me something.  Either he doesn't like blobs or he is suffering from blob-depression and wants some Zoloft.  He's gone back to sleep now (the dog) which is actually a SIGN of depression, maybe I should worry.    Can I have a career yet?  Okay, just checking, yeah I'll finish my undergrad degree first.  Anyhow, take care.

      Yep, been a while.  I've been not much in the posting mood, but on top of that I've been too busy.  SO much going with school and then life gets in the way sometimes too.  SO much life, so much real life that it starts to kind of sting.  That and the gym.  The gym stings sometimes because it feels like my knee-caps are going to fly OFF of my legs and hit someone across the room when Shawn decides that it's necessary for me to lift that much squat weight.    Between the sting of life and the sting of my legs (not to mention my arms, abs, etc.. which are all starting to look awesome if I do say so myself) I've been tied up.  That and being out of town for the last two weekends in a row.  Life REALLY does act funny sometimes.  I almost get irritated when it sneaks up and shows itself to be so real.  It's almost TOO cliche to be sitting there, feeling "older" than you ever have in your life simply due to the circumstances you're in.  You know, that feeling of "wow, this is what OLDER people talk about" when they say stuff like "it feels like just yesterday that.."  The truth is, it DOES seem like just yesterday that I got here, and now I'm leaving.  SO ready, but still seems fast.  It DOES seem like just yesterday that I met one of my best friends.  It DOES seem like just yesterday that me and that friend spent so many memories together that it would seem that separation would be impossible.  And it does seem like just last weekend, because it was, that this friend was watched, by me, walk down an aisle into marriage and away from my life.  I wonder if 12 years from now, the same amount of time (as of posting) that I have known this friend, if being greeted at the wedding reception like just another guest, will feel like "just yesterday."  I consider it the day I said goodbye.  Not that we wont talk again, but that a new chapter has started.  It's a funny position to be in when you're happy for someone, jealous, and sad all at the same time.  After not seeing someone that close in my life for a year, we would normally run, hug forever, and for all intents and purposes freak out for a while about how excited we were to see one another.  This of course can't happen when one of you is in a wedding dress.  (I don't wear dresses, so we're talking about her now).  It's just always weird to look into the eyes of someone you know better than possibly even the person she's marrying, and hear the words "I'm so glad you could come, it's so good to see you" as if you are an old high school friend, not "the man in my life" for the past several years.  I miss you so much, that it hurts, even though it's the best thing that could ever happen to you.  That is what covers up sadness that you'll never be my best friend, in the same way, again.  I miss you.  It's all so crazy.  In the darkest of dark moments last night, sitting staring at you (we're on a different "you" now, not the blushing bride anymore) on the floor last night, hearing you say that they all walk away.   Hearing you say that, in some such phrase, your parents don't support for long or for real sometimes and only do so with a condescending nature, made me express to you but more to myself that at this point in our lives "it's not about them anymore, we have to take care of ourselves."  I almost don't want to hear it.  I almost don't want to, myself, hear that it's me now.  At the same time, I do want to hear it, it's everything I have dreamed about since I was 7 years old.  Being an "adult" was what I wanted from the time I could fit into a suit and tie and follow my dad to his office to at least pretend I was one.  I am so excited about life, but cautious of her right now too.  You're fire that I'm excited to have keeping me warm and promising to do so in the future, but that includes the warning that when things get too real, burns may occur (oh and that I should "keep out of reach of children.. ")  Thanks for the promised warmth, life.    I am so thrilled to be starting my own life.  I want to, when I move, HAVE my own life.  I don't necessarily want to leave things and people behind, but I am ready to start a life for me.  I have never lived for myself in my life.  Please, don't take that away from me, life.  YOU either circumstance, I'm talking to you too.  I can't handle the idea of NOT having that satisfaction at 23.  I've waited so long to walk with you, life, and see what you feel like as a friend and foe.    "Living for me" never means that I am being selfish, or means to imply that I am such a selfLESS person that all my life I've just been some remarkable giver.  I do the best to be the best friend and person I can be, but I'm only human.  When it comes down to it, however, I don't necessarily put myself first in my happiness world, and that is not appropriate anymore.  I'm getting out of this post now, it feels claustrophobic.  I believe I will begin posting somewhere else soon.  A link that wont be given out, and will be BRUTALLY true and honest.  Wow, another something I would be doing for ME.

      Hi friend  It has been a long time since I have posted.  Why?  Cause I just don't care sometimes.    I think that I haven't posted in so long because so much has been going on.  I realize, even as I write this, that each of my posts really can't start out with why I haven't posted in so long.  So lets get right down to it.  Last week was busy because school is that way, and because I left town on secret mission number 2 to Chicago.  What a wonderful land.  I use the term "secret mission" because I am not  allowed  to do things like travel, have my own life, breath, etc when it comes to my overbearing mother who would flip a lid if she knew I was doing anything on my own.  Sometimes it's better to just not say anything, rather than deal with the burden of countless unnecessary explanations and round-trip guilt trips.  That is an entirely different story all together, and would not only bore you, but make you feel bad for me and I have enough self pity to not need any of yours, thanks.  Basically I'm treated like my shoe size (9) and not my age (23).  PS, my dick isn't tiny just because my feet are, it's a wives tale.  I'll show you sometime, just remind me.  It's nice, it's normal, you'll be happy and so will I.  Indeed, I'm cynical, and mostly joking though.  I couldn't love the woman more, and she couldn't annoy me even more than that, all at the same, manipulative twisted time.  Long story made longer- I went to Chicago with a good friend because, well because Chicago was there, we both love it, and the price was right.  "Right" in this story will mean dirt cheap.  The time was great, and yet again the city begged me to stay.  In September when I was there, visiting a law school, I fell in love with the city as an adult.  Before, I had always been a child when I was in Chicago, but it was in September when I visited that I realized I needed to be there.  I knew I had to put that city back on my map as a goal to reach as far as a living location goes.  This time, however, I was emotionally distraught to leave.  I knew that if I did not get into said law school that I visited in September, that none of THIS would be mine.  None of the people, none of the scenery, none of the intoxicating dynamic that is my dream location.  Illinois can suck my ass, by the way, I think that state sucks, but Chicago... rock on.  If I have to live in Illinois to have Chicago, I will live there with "Land of Lincoln" written ALL OVER my license plate.  So anyway, tag-team-back-again, I'm partying on party people here in Oklahoma and very sad to have returned from a land of wonderful food, people, shopping, and feelings of ecstasy.  The good news is, I'm settling back in to my life and looking forward to the future.  There will be plenty of things I will miss when I leave here.  I check my mail daily though, borderline diarrhea the whole time, hoping that I have a letter from the law school allowing me to enter their world of hell in a city of bliss.    Well to top it off, I come home to a tooth breaking in the back of my mouth and a 2 hour dental appointment this morning in order to fix it, along with other problems in my ever-complicated mouth.  lauren and I had a quick lunch together today, which really brought some joy to my depressed state right now.  Made me forget all about my half-numbed, painful mouth and about how I left my heart somewhere on Michigan Avenue outside of the 4 story Crate & barrel.  We had a great chat about everything from the condom-looking things on the legs of the chairs at Panera, to dry humping a pastors daughter.  Pregnancy came into play, as she usually does, and reared her dirty lil' head into our conversation.  Running around us, pregnancy laughed, and we talked about how much we hated her.  I'm just glad I'll never have to physically birth anything.  I barely like taking a shit.  I did confess to lauren, however, that if I DID have a child of my own that I would of COURSE love it and cherish it for all its glory.  Lauren simply looked at me with a disgusted look and replied "eh, if I had an ulcer I would take care of it" as if to imply that the child would be cared for, so as only to avoid the pain of jail time.    After a long winded, laugh filled conversation we parted and I join you now in the world of blog.  I'm going to take some Advil in order to relieve the throbbing in my mouth, and enjoy this thunderstorm from the comfort of my couch.  Ta-ta fair friend.

      WOO  I just got off the phone with my realtor in Chicago again, and for some reason I think it just hit home.  I'm not just whisltin' dixie here folks, I'm actually GOING!  I am MOVING, and it's actually a reality!  I think it hit me when I was going over the criteria on the phone with the realtor... and looking at a map of the RedLine train in Chicago and listing the stops I want to be close to.  Suddenly I was like "holy SHIT, I'm moving there..."  I can't tell you how excited I am!  I think it's just weird to think that things you want can actually be achieved, go figure?!  There have been far too many coincidences with Chicago and me for a while and speaking of the realtor, I think I will share the story of how I came across good ole' Kent V.  One day a few months back I got on several different real estate websites to search for condos in various places I was applying to law school.  Naturally one of the places I wanted to compare costs of living in was Chicago.  As with many websites of that nature, my contact information was required before I was able to hit the search page.  I was somewhat annoyed, but I wanted to see the listings, so I put in my real e-mail address (which is odd, because usually I just put in some fake address like "mason@mason.net").  For my phone number I think I put in (405)555-1234 or something equally clever.  Anyhow, long story longer, I get an e-mail from this Kent fellow a couple of days later telling me he was happy to help if I needed any assistance with real estate, etc.  Seeing as how someone took the time to write me and not send the typical automated form e-mail back, I felt it appropriate to write back and let him know I was no where close to being in the market for making a condo purchase, but to thank him for his time.  I explained to him that I was just simply comparing prices in different cities that I might be moving to in the coming 6 months.  He wrote back telling me that he recognized the 405 area code on the information section I filled out and that he was a Univ. Of Oklahoma graduate (hey... like ME soon), also that when he graduated from OU his desire was to move to Chicago at any cost and just up and did it during the "dot-com" craze.  I wrote back because I was obviously impressed by the coincidence.  I told him I was currently a student at OU (something I hadn't explained originally), and that I, too, wanted to live in Chicago so badly.  He has since been in contact off and on to see how my law school search is going and what information I have found out.  He even is setting up a search for me (as I think I explained a couple posts back) in order to make my search easy once I go to find a place to live, and to give me an idea of what I can get, in what areas, and for what price.  Maybe the coincidence isn't weird to anyone else, but to me it's strange.  Of all webpages I browsed, I get in contact with someone who graduated from OU, applied to grad schools but specifically wanted to live in Chicago, etc.  Thanks KENT!  You're being so helpful.  I'm feeling 100 times better today, and the sickness is finally subsiding.  Talk about RALLY, I've been rallying all day.  I hit up the dentist, got the tooth all checked out that has been bugging me, went to the bank to get a money order to put a deposit in to hold a seat @ law school for the fall, got myself a cherry coke and headed home.  These are all menial tasks, yes, but considering I haven't left the house in days due to my minor illness, it was huge.  My mom was talking to me today about some sort of program she saw on the bible code, and how there are all kinds of codes written within the text of the original bible translation.  There was even some jumble about "twin towers" and "airplanes" and "flames" or some shit.  OKAY code people.. why don't you go ahead and find this shit out BEFORE hand, hmm?  I posed this question to her, and she said that they did touch on the issue during the program.  Stating that something was being found now about a meteor or some sort destroying Earth.  I was like "oh great" and she said "but then there was something..." and before she could finish I said "about Ben Aflek and Bruce Willis flying up on a rocket and breaking it apart first??"  She didn't think I was very funny because I wasn't taking her story seriously.  I was amused though.  Weren't you?  Apparently there is some code listing thing about how it could possibly be broken up before it hits Earth.  What is this, a Choose Your Own Adventure book?  I like the bible and believe it's teachings, but I'm kind of confused about the between the lines stuff and codings and what gets lost in translation from Hebrew to English to Spanish to German and then to Pig Latin and back to English.  I think I will try not to get too far into thinking about that, and instead try to just go on living the best I can with the best moral standards I know how:)  She also was describing to me one part of the program that had a rabbi and a Priest and a Minister or something and I said "and they all went into a bar.. and??"  She didn't like that either.  It was fun!   I'm going to class now, well soon I am.  First I'm getting me a PHAT grilled cheese at Classic 50's.  Watch out for the Meteor guys.. and if it hits us and we all go down in a bible code sorta way.. Don't say that ALL the signs weren't there!  C'mon.

      *Ahem* say goodnight Cool... that goes for you too "gang"  If I NEVER hear another song by Cool And The Gang, I will more than likely be a happier person.  They don't infringe on my life too much, but I'm just about tired of hearing the careless, good-time ditty by this 1-hit-wonder sensation of a band.  This group of individuals has been riding around on the edge of success for 20 some years now, and I think it's time to say goodbye.  I was in the shower today listening to my shower radio, as I always do when I shower, and "Celebrate Good Times" came on.  It sent me into a fit of RAGE for some reason.  I know you're picturing me freaking out now, throwing Panteen Pro-V shampoo bottles around and ripping the white tiles off the wall, but it really wasn't that bad.  In fact, I wasn't even standing up.  Being that I have been sick, I was laying down (as I often do when I am sick or hungover) on the shower floor, and letting the water fall on me.  It's more relaxing that way, and besides I had no energy.  I think that is what made me so mad.  I was a prisoner to the song "Celebrate Good Times..C'MON!"  I had to sit there, weak from this cold, laying on the bottom of my shower floor and endure the 3 minutes of that song because I wasn't able to reach the shower radio to change the station.  Back when the song first hit the charts, I'm sure it was a feel-good, fun time for all to be had every time it would come on the air.  I don't blame you people who were alive @ the time.  I don't think I was alive, but I could be wrong.  (Keep in mind, i wasn't listening to anything but songs by, oh, say.. the muppets from 1980 through around 1985... okay through 1997, whatever, get off my back).  Back to my point.  The song sucks guys.  I was laying there in the shower picturing just how clever it was when it was played at the first basketball game.  Then it was on at the first New Years Eve party.. and that was so fun and everyone was all drunk and dancing and celebrating good times c'mon.  Then I'm sure it was cool at the first inauguration Ball when all the candidates broke loose with the big election victory under their belts, and danced around like they weren't 65.  And then the basketball game again.. it was fun that year too.  OKAY, jump to 20 years later.  ITS OVER.  I dont' want to hear the song anymore than I want to hear another novelty song such as Achey Breaky Heart.  Please stop.  I get sick to my stomach when I see Cool and his gang on some talk show as a guest band.  What, WHAT, are they going to play some new hit?  NO, they're going to play "Celebrate Good Times" over and over again until we just can't stop celebrating such good times, c'mon.  I say we need to start BOYCOTTING this shit.  I am almost irritated knowing that there are still royalties being paid to Cool and his whole gang (how many people are in this gang, I do not know) for this song each time it is played.  God, I wonder why this got under my skin so much.  Actually it didn't, but it was something fun to post about.  No one reads this shit anyway.  Next time someone has a Barmitsfa (spelling?? sorry i'm not Jewish), or a wedding, or a DJ at a Jr. High dance, PLEASE don't give in and let anyone play "Celebrate Good Times" I beg of you.  This will just keep the song alive, and folks lets let the thing die already.  Pull the plug on the old bastard and bury it.  "I heard my mamma cry, I heard her pray the night Chicago died."  I wonder what this song is about.  Sorry, brain lapse, I'm listening to "1-hit-wonders" station on AOL Radio.  I know, i'm ASKING for it, because out of NO where they're sure to play "Celebrate Good Times" sooner or later.  I better change the station in a hurry!

      There was a big storm last night and I guess it blew in some cold weather, because it is FREEZING outside.  I know there was a big storm because I was up, and couldn't fall back into sleepland because my throat was SO sore that I couldn't even sleep.  What's it been now, like 8 years of this little illness?    So now my feet are freezing because I went to check my mail outside with flip flops on.  I'm sure that will help my cold a great deal.  Wet cold feet.    It's getting interesting around here with things being put into motion about moving.  I always think that being proactive is important in almost any situation.  I am trying to be proactive as well in this moving endeavor.  I spoke to my realtor in Chicago yesterday on the phone, and he's going to be working on getting my search set up for places to live.  This will take a lot of stress out of the process to have someone helping me out on that front.  This way, when I fly out to look at places, I will have appointments set up for me already, and not have to trek around town with the classifieds.  He's even going to be sending me weekly updates with all listings that match my criteria in the areas of town I want to live in.  Afterall, I will not have much time to find a place because I will more than likely be in town for only a weekend when I go to look at apartments and condos.  I was starting to get worried about the daunting task of having only a couple of afternoons worth of time to find a place to reside, but I feel better knowing I've got someone taking some of the stress out of the process for me.  I just got finished watching MTV's "I Want A Famous Face."  That's quite pathetic.  Some of these people don't need a FAMOUS face, per say, but rather a more human-looking face.  I guess shoot for the moon and if you miss at least you're among the stars huh?  Because you, my friend, do NOT look like Kate Winslett, you still look like a fat redhead to me.  Then again, so is Kate Winslett. I don't know how to spell her name and don't care to learn.  It's been a long time since I saw the credits rolling on TITANIC, so don't' be too hard on me.  What have you done for me LATELY Kate?  Oh well, you got some air time today on MTV, because some douche in Florida apparently wanted to look like you.  Oh GOOD, the Osbourne's are on now.  Freakshow.    I think I'll turn it to MadTV instead, because I assume it's about time to throw up all this phlem that's making me sick, and what better way to do it than by inducing hurls with bad television:)  I'm very excited that this coming week is going to be very easy-going.  I have very few responsibilities to take care of for the next week or so, therefore I can be relaxed, get to feeling better, and just handle my shit.    Take care friends, have a good weekend and don't drink and drive!

      :)  That sums up my day.  I went to bed last night at the ripe hour of around midnight, because my throat was super dooper scratchy, and I wanted to make sure I felt better by today.  As it turns out, it was solid this morning.  You know, when you can't even swallow because it's just solid, nasty, whatever-that-stuff-is in your throat?  I hate that.    I'm feeling a lot better today, and it was a PERFECT day to sleep in and listen to the rain.  I got some good rest, went to the city to help a friend retrieve their vehicle from the dealership and have a good meal.  OF COURSE I had to come home in time to see the season premiere of ABC's "The Bachelor."  No, not because I'm a huge fan of the ridiculous show, but because there's a tiny connection that brings it close to home.  My brother's EX - fiance' is on the show as one of the 25 contestants and has successfully made it to the next round.  WAY TO GO JESSICA, and DOUBLE way to go to my brother for not ending up in THAT relationship.  Goodness.  Anywho, you'll have to keep your eyes out for "Jessica" the attorney from San Antonio, Texas.  God love her, she's a nice girl.  I wont pretend to know the details of their engagement getting broken off and I especially wont pretend to care.  All I care about is my brother's happiness and the happiness I am now receiving from watching someone I vaguely know make a fool of herself on television.  He, apparently, broke the engagement off, and now a good few months later she's on the Bachelor flaunting her silliness.  Actually she's a very intelligent individual by the books.  An attorney, graduated at the top of her class, etc.  SOMEHOW though, in everyday life, she's a tard.  TUNE IN- you'll see, you WILL see.  What else what else what else.  I'm not sure.  I'm very much hoping that I can get some good sleep tonight.  I slept so sound last night.  I didn't even awake to the phone calls I received at 12:30am, 1:15am, 2:34am, 5:30am, and 11:30am respectively.  Sorry folks, I was stone-cold-snoozin'.  It was an interesting awakening to get the vast array of messages I received last night.  Not really even sure to do with some of the information other than make a confused face and go "hmmmm, okay."    Well, it's off to relaxation-land for me again.  Laying in bed, watching some TV, and allowing myself to drift off into sleepville.  Before I go, lauren wanted me to write this quote down so I wouldn't forget it.  It will mean nothing to any of the people reading this but her, but at least it will be on record.  So here is the snippet of the phone conversation between lauren and I earlier this evening on our cell phones:  lauren: "I can't hear well, do you ever have trouble hearing on your cell phone?" mason:  "with you... no"  LOLA talks loud, which is why it was somehow so funny at the time- and she LOVED that I said that.  it was totally a joke and not meaning to mock, but it was true.  I never have a problem hearing LOLA.  I think I hear her now, actually... and she's across town.  love you lola.  g'night and bring me some Vitamin C.

      They should just (and by "they" i mean those people that take care of things like this) meld this day and St. Patrick's day into one big annoying day where you pinch people that aren't wearing green, and then you run off screaming "'April Patricks Saint Fools Day!!!!"  That would just be great, and we could kill two annoying birds with one obnoxious stone.  I did decide to pull one fun stunt, and e-mail my father to tell him the bad news that I'm not going to be able to graduate due to a little mixup.  I told him in the e-mail that I wasn't able to get ahold of him at the office, so I just was e-mailing him to ask what he thought I should do about my lease at my apartment.  Renew?  Move somewhere cheaper?  But long story short, I was having to graduate in the coming December graduation, I was super bummed about it, and ended the e-mail with "Do I still get a new car?  Just let me know.  Love, Mason"  You see, the deal is, I graduate this May, so I get a new car this May.  That'll make him really mad to think I would be so selfish as to blow off school and still ask for a little reward.  I'm excited for him to read that.  For a split second he will think he raised a complete shit.  Well he did raise a complete shit, but we'll blame that on mom, not him.  I just got finished watching "VH1's Fabulous Life of:  Hip Hop Stars 2004."  Really?  Okay, cause their lives aren't fabulous they are ridiculous x 10.  One guy, who I had never heard of but am assuming he's some sort of recording producer, had a toilet made of marble and gold.  I guess we all say "well if I had that much money I'd..."  But seriously, I don't think I'd go as far as some of these people.  I think I would probably work on that whole St. Patty's day/April Fool's day combination thing.    I'm so comfortable sitting on the couch.  I was debating on whether or not I should go to my trainer today, because I have been SO good about going for two months, and I only received four hours of sleep last night.  The deal-breaker was when I was too tired to get off the couch to go get the phone number to the gym off my keychain (4 feet in front of me).  I figured that probably meant that I wouldn't be worth much at the gym either, if I can't make myself stand up.  Me so tired.  Me want fried rice.  Well, I think that's about all you get for now.  You'll be back though, you always are.  I watch you come in here, read my shit, and leave.  You don't think I know you're doing it, but I see it.  I see where you're reading it from, I see how many times you're reading it and I see what time of day it is each time.   Just kidding, I don't.  Or do I?  Muaaahahaha.  Moral of the story:  see you soon.  Same place, probably a different time, and more than likely sporadic in nature.

      Yeah, so I figured out how to post pictures on the blog now.  Not that it was too hard, since Blogger.com has basically made it idiot-proof.  I figured, hey, I'm an idiot, lets see if it really is idiot-proof, so I gave it a shot.  Below you will see just how much of a tourist I am when I'm out of town.    Seriously though, I posted some pictures of my last day in Chicago when I wandered around with a camera all over the city.  Nothing too thrilling, just various images of things in my future home and my hotel.  I'm a total nerd with things like that, I thought the hotel was cool so I was "that guy" taking pictures of the lobby.  I tried to do it in a hurry before anyone noticed me and before a loser-alarm went off.  The hotel was really cool.  It was the W hotel on Lakeshore overlooking Lake Michigan.  If you've never been to Chicago, Lake Michigan is not just a simple lake.  It is endless and is basically an ocean.  Full yachts, beaches, no other shore visible with the human eye.  The hotel itself was really cool.  It was very modern and retro at the same time.  The lobby had club music playing 24 hours a day, and at night it was a very club atmosphere.  The room itself was awesome as well.  I tried to get some pictures of that so that I could share.  If you click on the pictures, you get them in a new, bigger window, and you can see them with more detail!  I hope you enjoy.  I miss Chicago already.  Sorry there aren't any pictures of me standing in front of landmarks.. it's hard to take pictures of yourself.

      There's nothing more depressing than leaving somewhere you WANT to be, and coming back to somewhere you do NOT want to be.  As my flight descended upon the middle-class mecca that is Oklahoma City this afternoon, I couldn't help but be a little sad.  There is nothing wrong with anything being 'middle-class' because God knows I have about 20 dollars to my name, but leaving my favorite city on Earth that just happens to be extrememly world class in nature only to return here makes me sad.  I miss Chicago already.  I felt almost clausterphobic while I watched out the window at the landscape below that had the words "YOU DONT BELONG HERE, MASON!" written all over it.  No, seriously, there were mobile homes lined up together in the shape of the various different letters in that phrase - spelling out "YOU DONT BELONG HERE MASON!"  I know, I thought it was weird too.  That's a lot of coordination just to send me a message, I figured they could have just passed me a note or something at the airport.  ANYfuck, no more Okie bashing, it's my home for now and a good place to live.  I'm not trying to contradict my previous "I love OU" post at all.  I just had a wonderful time, and now I'm even more antsy to move to Chicago.  I loved looking for places to live and found some great living arrangments.  Still a little too early to sign a lease though, but it was a great start to seeing what was out there.    The weather was fantastic!  A little cool at night, but just perfect overall.  I think I walked more on this trip than I have walked in my whole life, but it was great.  The neighborhoods are so beautiful near downtown with tree lined streets, brownstones laden with ivy, and people walking their dogs.  My favorite place I looked at was a beautiful little apartment on the 14th floor of an older building on Cedar street.  This place will be gone for sure by the time I get to Chicago, as it was priced quite nicely.  Really nice closet space, hardwood floors, overlooking a tree-lined street, vintage buildings, and just a couple blocks from Lakeshore Drive, and a couple blocks in the other direction from Rush street, which is a great area for hip little restaurants and corner bakeries.  Another perk is that it was walking distance from probably the 2nd or 3rd best shopping area in the US: Michigan Avenue.  I wanted to sneak into the bathroom and lock myself in to see if maybe the realtor would just forget I was there.  I'm sure when they did eventually rent the place out the new tenant wouldn't be happy to find out that the place came standard with a Mason.  When you looked out the windows to the left.. there was the massive ocean-like Lake Michigan.  Ahhh, I miss Chicago already.  No worries Mason, just tie up loose ends here, and be on your way.    Misson of my trip to Chicago:  To confirm it was where I wanted to live Mission Accomplished.

      That's right, I'm watching VH1's "50 Most Awesomely Bad Songs...Ever" and Meatloaf sure did make number twenty-nine with his "I Would Do Anything For Love."  This show, coupled with "I Love the 70's/80's," is the reason I love VH1.  They went from playing Phil Collins a lot, to actually having quite the sense of humor.  These fun shows mixed with the fact that they run lots of advertisements for condoms and STD awareness makes me think that "Video Hits 1" (a name that makes no sense) is appealing to a younger demographic now.  Either that or they're appealing to a humor-friendly Zimbabwean population (STD reference.. apparently there's lots there)  I knew today was going to be a better day than the last few days when my professor made the following comment in my 2-week-summer-class:  "Is it hot in here?" the class responded "yes" and he continued "Good, I sometimes don't know if it's hot or if I'm just fat."  pissing yourself in class is embarrassing, so I tried really hard to hold the urine in after that statement.    Hey HEY, I just was instant messaging with a friend and wanted to describe how I was in a difficult position, and accidentally came up with a new way of typing it.  Wanna see?  I thought so.. okay here goes:  "Rock-Mason-Hardplace"  Do you like it?  I did.  I was like "hey!! Look, Mason between a rock and a hard place."  Okay, lauren was right when she said the other day that I have the attention span of MAYBE a hamster (if even) or something, but I somehow come full circle when I write.  I would agree.  I go all over the place when I write.  She was referring to various letters/cards I have written her over the course of our friendship.  I would have to say it's true with my blog, with my thought process, and with my life in general.  I get distracted, go off on some tangent, but it all seems to come back and make sense.  At least that's what I'd like to believe.  So I was in line at McDonalds today, to get a salad, and I ended up with a quarter pounder with cheese somehow.  Oh well, whatever.  I swear my intentions were good going in.  Anyway, while in line I was laughing on the phone with lauren (I should title my blog "stuff about lauren and I it seems.  I should also stop using parenthetical references mid-sentence) and the lady behind the counter goes "you have SUCH a nice smile."  I thought that was pretty nice, but then it turned into a conversation between the employees behind the counter.  "DOESN'T he have a NICE smile?"  I promptly checked the mirror in the car when I got back out to the parking lot.  Yeah, coke-stained teeth dude, real nice.  In some worlds, I'm a fuckin' male super model!  That world.. is McDonalds at the lunch-time rush.  I'll take it anyway.  Which way to wardrobe?  Just past the indoor playground?  cool.  "Dancing on the Ceiling" just made number 22 on the list of worst songs, by the way.  A panelist on the show just made a wonderful comment about the Lionell Richie song "Dancing on the Ceiling."  "Sadly" he said "the money that Lionell Richie made on this horrible song, has twenty-years later allowed Nicole Richie to go on TV and annoy an entire new generation of people."  Rock on.  I'm seriously laughing so much at the cynasism of this show.  I think I want it on DVD or something.  Well, I guess I better go now.  I have several phone calls to return, loose ends to tie up, and at least 45 minutes of cardiovascular excercise to accomplish at the gym.  I was so frustrated with my past few days that I "accidentally" did an entire hour on the elliptical machine Monday night.  Anyone who knows me well, knows that cardio is my least favorite part of my workout regime.  Therefore, the idea of an hour of non-stop cardio was strange.  I guess I had lots of energy to release.  The machine told me I also released 750 calories, so that works for me.  RRAAAWWWWWRRRR!!   CAPTAIN CARDIO!

      Tonight I studied in the library, I have a final exam tomorrow.  After parking my car I took a short-cut to the library through Adams Hall, the Business Administration building in which I have had the majority of all of my classes in college.  I walked out of Adams hall, on my way to the Great Reading Room of the library, and as I walked through the garden's of OU's beautiful campus and the cool night breeze chilled my feet, barely covered with my 4 year old JCrew flip-flops, I noticed how empty campus felt.  I reminded myself that tomorrow was the last day of final exams and that it was likely that most people had already finished up and were off campus until next fall.. and then it hit me:  I will take my final exam tomorrow and I will be off campus for the rest of my life.  I stopped dead in my tracks, in the middle of a flower garden and stared up at the gigantic and gothic looking Library that loomed over my head.  I was completely alone, and for a moment in time I could do nothing but sit down on a bench and reminisce.  I tried to remember each and every class I have taken, each building I have had a class in, and each semester's general and most poignant memories.  Each memory was yesterday and a million years ago all at the same time.  I was paralyzed for a good twenty minutes, just sitting and thinking, all the while staring at the 100-something year old building in front of me, with its collegiate appearance.    I attempted to study for about an hour, but my mind wandered a great deal.  Every 5 minutes or so, I would recall a class I had taken, or a person I will miss, a moment I had forgotten in time over the past four years.  I gathered my things, and left the Reading Room, headed back to my car.  I wanted to traverse through the hallways of Adams Hall one more time.  The computer labs were closed, every classroom was locked, and to my knowledge I was the only living soul in the building.  I strolled slowly down the long main hallway, taking note of the emptiness that the midnight hour left for Adams to enjoy.  As of tomorrow, I will be done with you, Adams Hall, for all intents and purposes.  I have wanted to get you out of my life for a while now, but why was letting the door close behind me so fucking hard tonight?  The empty study tables, laden with scrap paper and left-behind study materials, seemed so lonely with no one filling their heavy wooden chairs.  How many times had I met at "the tables" for a group project meeting?  I could hear my own breathing patterns as I headed for the door, footsteps on the hard floor echoing off the stone walls of a building that seemed to scream academia.  I couldn't help but turn around and watch it close as I left Adams Hall for one of the last times, half wanting to run back inside, metaphorically and physically.  I did turn around (again), once I reached the bottom of the stone steps.  I looked up at the building to see the words "BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION" carved in stone above a doorway that I have passed through on nearly a daily basis for I don't know how long.  The same words will be written on a piece of paper soon with the words "bachelor of" typed in front of them, and I almost can't believe it's just hitting me that it's over.    As if my life was passing before my eyes just before death, my experiences passed before my mind's eye (sorry lauren I had to use that phrase) as I walked to my car.  My life at the University of Oklahoma is ending, and my first instinct was to cling to the cornerstones of each building on campus, and plead with them to embrace me for a short while longer.  Please let me stay in the comfort of a protected and fun world.  Please keep me with my peers forever, don't let the people I see everyday disappear from my life after tomorrow, it's too soon.  If I close my eyes.. when I open them will I be headed back to one of my favorite classes, with some of my favorite people on campus?   I wont be letting the door to Adams close behind me leaving me in the real world, and being done will be a dream.. right?  "I'm so ready" but at the same time, I will miss you so much.  I don't even know who "you" are in this situation.  "You" are this campus, and "you" are not having any obligations at 2pm on a Tuesday afternoon.  "You" are a life where friendly faces can be found all over town, and life comfortable.  "You" are good times, challenging growth, uncomfortable new experiences, and a fantastic journey through the last of my youth.  "YOU" are the people that I see everyday in class, and enjoy being around, but will realistically never see again after tomorrow.  I'm glad I met "you" and I'm glad I was here.    A new generation of individuals will call this place home and make these experiences their own starting in a few short months.  No trace of me will remain, no serious donation has been made in order to name a building or classroom after me, and therefore the only record of my existence at this place and during this time resides in my mind & in some file cabinet somewhere.    I have at times thought of all the places I could have gone to school.  I think "maybe if I had gone to X school or the Univ. of X that such and such would have been different."  I wouldn't have to answer questions such as "why did you choose OKLAHOMA?!" from people back home in Texas.  I might have been at a university with a completely different environment and had a largely different college  experience.  I am so thankful I was here, and it is with complete pride and a bittersweet smile, I will depart this place.  The answer to my choice in attending the University of Oklahoma:  Because I have had an amazing time at a remarkable University filled with incredible people.  I'm so happy to have been able to call you home, OU, and I will miss you.  I could not have ever known at the onset of the people and moments I would come in contact with and the way my life would be shaped throughout my college years, but luck would have it that I ended up at the perfect place for me.    Almost 1/4 of my entire life has been lived in Oklahoma.  I'm leaving soon, and will have very little reason to come back, as I have no family here.  Rationally it could be assumed that I might never step foot in this state again after graduation.  When asked where I'm from, however, the answer will always be "San Antonio originally, but I moved here from Oklahoma."  Boomer Sooner, OU, you've been a great friend and a happy home and I thank you for both.

      The title of my blog has changed.  It all started with a joke between lauren and I while we were both talking on the phone an hour ago and watching a Full House re-run.  I have no recolection (memory of a goldfish tonight for some reason) what the joke was, but it had something to do with us both wishing that "Aunt Becky" off Full House had a website called "BeckyAgainstTheWorld.com"  Lauren dared me to just go ahead and change my blogspot title to "Becky Against the World" so there it is.  I might just leave it forever.  On another happy note, I did update my "about me" page, just with some worthless crap.  enjoy!

      I came all the way up here to check my grade on a presentation, and it's NOT posted.  SHAME on you Dr. Min for not posting the grades already.  You see, the grades are posted on Excel, and for some reason my computers at home do not possess this marvelous program.  I did end up going to sleep last night, in case anyone was concerned, I believe I drifted off around 7:30 or so.  I felt great all day today as well.  Had an awesome workout with Shawn, drank a Pepsi, ate some fish for dinner, it was a good day.  Today trainer-Shawn decided he would once again "up my weights" so as to kill me in the arm-region of my body.  Thanks Shawn.  I'm looking at some fat chick's computer screen right now and she's in the process of viewing handbags on E-bay.  I kinda feel like telling her that she should check into discounts on Trimspa instead, because a pink handbag isn't gonna do much in the fashion world if it's being carried by a blarg-party-hat.  (for the definition of blarg, party-hat, and a general understanding of these words' meanings please visit www.fatchicksinpartyhats.com).  I have so many negative things to share!  I think I'll go up to the Great Reading Room of the library and see if my friend is studying there like he always is.  I like to harass people.  2nd post in like 20 days, did you really expect much?

      Good morning world  and GOOD NIGHT mason.  I have yet to go to sleep.  I have yet to post, as a matter of fact.  I, for some reason, am not able to sleep lately.  I guess it's because I've gotten myself into way too much of a night-owl schedule again.  Graduation!  I graduate soon!  I'm pretty damn excited about that.  "Ladies and Gentlemen of the class of 99.. wear sunscreen."    I think I will go to a tanning bed instead, but thanks Baz Luhrman.  I seriously have no idea why I bother typing this right now.  If I had a reader or two, by chance, they have surely given up on the hope that I was even alive anymore after the nearly MONTH absence.  I've just been busy.  Too many people to do and too many things to see.. er, something vice-versa.  If I could kill two people, I think I would kill the two bastards on the Sonic commercials.  They irritate me.  Don't drive up to the drive-through of other restaurants and tell them how Sonic does things differently.  Just drive to fucking Sonic if you want Sonic Texas-Toast and Breakfast Burritos you cunts.  Wouldn't that be sad if I could wish two people dead, and the people I wished it upon were actors in a commercial that mildly annoys me for the 30 seconds that it airs?  I couldn't really wish that on anyone anyway, but you'd hope I would use my power to rid the world of some evil dictator not some douche-bag 32 year old Sonic commercial guys.  For those of you who don't know or don't live in this part of the country (hell), Sonic is a drive-in fast food chain.  At this point I'm convinced that the only patrons of my weblog will be people who accidental stumble in, because anyone who once read this shit has since passed by to more interesting (and updated regularly) things.  I just referenced this part of the country as hell, but that's a lie.  I'm gonna miss so many things about this place when I move soon.  I'll miss my bank with its 8am - 8pm lobby hours.  I'm going to miss... yeah, I'll miss my bank.  I'll miss other stuff too, but I'm tired and can't think of them.    Sleepy-time.

      I just walked the dog, and realized when I got back upstairs that my pants were unbuttoned.  Oh well, it's 3:30am, no one was around to notice.  I bathed my dog tonight, speaking of him, and all I had to shampoo him with was my Bed Head shampoo.  Boomer now smells like "Moisture Maniac" and I must say it's quite an improvement from "I just rolled around in a dead bird carcass.. Maniac."  I have some new neighbors that live below me.  I've never actually met them, but I hate them.  I smiled once, they didn't seem receptive to my gesture, and plus they made a HELL of a lot of noise moving in one morning while I was sleeping.  They have an infant.  They drive a Ford Explorer and a Ford F150, which both are the same color and both have the same front hood visors on them.  I guess that's the Oklahoma version of having matching Mercedes or something.  They have a doormat that says "We love our vacuum, we found God, and we gave at the office."  If these are not reasons enough to hate someone... well then I don't know what! haha.  Oh, and it's a one bedroom apartment, which for some reason makes my skin crawl to think that there are technically 3 people (counting infant) crowding the floorplan below me with a crib in the corner and baby shit everywhere.  I bet the sink has baby bottles that are not "dishwasher safe" laying in it.  Oh how the identical floor plan below me is an entirely different world!  Lets talk about their doormat though, if we might.  Obviously this is an attempt at humor designed to say "tee-hee.. Go Away" in a clever little way.  It's the type of thing you see at Spencer's Gifts in the mall, laugh at (on the inside, as it is truly not deserving of actual energy), but never something you'd actually PURCHASE AND PUT TO USE.  It does seem a bit forward even.  Maybe they're NOT kidding.  Maybe they really DO want to say "dude, don't come knocking because whatever you're peddling, we don't want it."  Then again, that would be assuming a lot.  It would be assuming that everyone who has a "honk if you.." bumper sticker really wants you to honk if you do indeed ______.  That doormat is kinda eating at me more and more every time I pass by it to walk the dog.  I'm starting to think I should steal it just to  end my annoyance.  Not that I really would, but it might go nicely with my "Pool Closed" sign.  Regardless, the whole thing just kind of makes me want to knock on their door and try to sell them a vacuum, just to see if they would point to the mat and close the door.

      I went to the eye doctor yesterday because my vision capabilities seem to have decreased, yet again, in my right eye.  I find myself wearing my glasses more and more everyday.  I used to wear them simply to read, go to a movie, or if say.. I knew I'd be driving at night.  Lately, however, I feel I   need them more often.  I asked the eye doctor, after he adjusted my prescription for the third time in 5 months, why my vision was changing so rapidly.  His response was that basically he didn't know, but "we'll keep an EYE on it" No pun intended.  It's funny because it's basically just my right eye that is getting worse.  I have always had a stronger left eye.  My MIND'S eye is fuckin 20/20.. but that's another story.  He did remark that if it was diabetes, that it would be both eyes rapidly deteriorating.  On the other hand, if my vision was getting BETTER rapidly, it would mean a brain tumor could be growing behind my eyes.  YUM.  Kind of freaky to think that a brain tumor makes your eyes get better and better.  I was speaking to my mom last night about the general events of the day and the happenings in my world.  When I told her about my eye doctor appointment, I of course relayed the interesting tumor facts.  Her comments, and I quote:  "Man, talk about the good news and the bad news.  'Well sir, the good news is your vision is getting better and better.  The bad news.. you're going to die'"  Leave it to mom to be clever out of no where.    Lately, Norman has become BugFest 2004.  I don't know when ballots were out for where BugFest would be held this year, but Norman happened to win somehow.  I think we beat out Raleigh, North Carolina ONLY due to our centrally located position in the United States.  In case you're wondering there really isn't a BugFest, per say, but there might as well be because there are a HELL OF A LOT OF BUGS around for some reason.  Last night alone, there were 3 slaughters in my apartment.  They're coming in, and I don't know why.  I walk my dog and there are Junebugs EVERYWHERE.  Fluttering around at my ankles, whizzin' across the grass, dancing in the moonlight, and so on and so forth.  Spiders have joined the party too.  They're crawling on the walls of my apartment and every once in a while making their way inside.  I think they get lost.  I  had to kill a "Daddy Long Legs" the other day, and felt pretty bad.  There he was, traversing my ceiling, minding his own business, and probably just trying to get home to Mommy Long Legs, when suddenly *SMASH* dead.  I apologized to him as I flushed him down the toilet.  Another bug rode into my apartment on lauren's shoulder last night.  He just jumped on board and cruised in like he owned the place.  Death to him too.  Again.. with apologies.  I'm sorry though, I pay rent, and unless these guys wanna chip in a bit, I'm living alone as originally intended.  One particularly interesting thing about me is that I constantly personify everything.  I call it interesting, you might call it annoying, but then I might call you a piece of shit.. so whatever, we all have our opinions.  To each his own.  Anyhow, personification.  As I mentioned the convention seems to be in town and the Junebugs are out in FULL force.  One such Junebug was walking through my apartment the other day, just browsing around my carpet.  I was trying to tell lauren this (for SOME reason) and the story escalated to the point of insanity.  You know, the type of conversation you only could hope that the government is tapping into and thinking they've finally pegged some terrorist using code language about junebugs to plan some attack.  So here's this Junebug, coasting along, and I had no heart to kill him.  I've killed before and it would seem I would be able to kill again, easily, but no.  So I got a paper towel and placed him out on the balcony to once again be out in his own element.  In telling the story to lauren, however, the Junebug somehow became a mayor.  With a closer look, I imagined the reason I spared his life was because he was dressed so dapper.  He was wearing a BIG mayor hat, carrying a septor of sorts, and kinda marching along.. not really walking.  I imagine that he will take the paper towel I removed him with back to his people as proof that he did indeed travel to foreign lands.  Much like the Wizard going back to Kansas, he will tell his people of his travels and the great things he saw on my carpet.  They will admire him, re-elect him, consider him their hero, and then build a house for him out of that very paper towel.  One day I will be walking Boomer and I will pass that house, and see Mayor Junebug of June-Bug City giving me a thumbs up.  We'll both smile, laugh a bit, and wink at each other.

      have you ever had one of those days that was so bad that your bones literally ache by the time the day is done?  have you ever wanted to cry, just to experience a physical release from the tension, frustration, and utter exhaustion at life that you experience, but you're far too numbed to expel tears?  have you ever wanted to throw the towel in, or at least throw yourself face down at the mercy of anyone who would possibly alleviate the excruciating pressure you're experiencing?  have you ever tried so hard at something, and still found it wasn't a good enough effort.. over.. and over... and over again?  have you ever been at the breaking point, where if one more thing in such a short period of time goes wrong, that you might just indeed 'go postal?'  at that same moment, did you realize that you don't even possess the energy to write the word 'postal' or even 'go' on a piece of paper because everything that has lead you to the breaking point has also sucked the life out of your very being?  have you ever been me?  that's what it's like lately.  stay away from me, i'm not pleasant.    don't try to talk to me, i wont be entertaining at all.  don't come around me, my moods might rub off on you, or at least rub you the wrong way.

      Showers are typically a place where people go to clean themselves.  I have a shower radio in my shower. I also have a mirror in my shower for shaving, because I have to shave IN the hot steam or I will razor burn the fuck out of my face.  (Blonde hair, fair skin, blah blah, skin like paper, rashes occur from the simplest of things as do sunburns, etc.)  I'm getting off-track.  So, shower, shower radio, mirror in shower.    Confession:          Showers = Karaoke-Time; Mason Style.  While I shave, while I wash, while I scrub-a-dub, I sing so loudly to ANYTHING that is on the radio that the neighbors surely hear me.  I don't have an awesome voice.    Here's where the mirror comes in:  I look in the mirror while I'm singing sometimes and make extreme faces at it.  You know, the kind of faces someone would make when they were singing so loud and hard that it looks like they're in pain.  The mirror is my audience and sometimes... yeah, sometimes the shaving gel canister is my microphone.  There, I said it.  I had to get it off my chest.  I sometimes wonder about the things "we" as people do in private when no one is around.  Like, what if there was a camera on you and someone saw the weird stuff you do alone?  Not that singing in the shower is that odd, but just funny.  Like the times I talk to myself when I go in a room and forget why I'm in there and say "what did I come in here for" outloud.  Or when I have entire one-sided conversations with my dog about things like the weather and how much I hate school?    Anyway, I came out of the bathroom just now after my shower, opened the bathroom door, and Boomer was staring at me, like he was concerned about what might have been causing the commotion inside the bathroom while I showered.  It was then that I knew I had a problem.

      I need to post more, I do, but no one fucking reads this shit anyway.  I had a great evening last night.  Lauren decided that a good idea would be to come say hi to me, which WAS a good idea.  She was just in town for the evening on her way down to her Dad's place.  I was excited about the break from studying.  SHE was excited about the wine on my kitchen counter.  I was excited about it too.  Lauren suggested she have a glass.  The nerd in me told her no.  The cool kid finally got drug out, and before we knew it we were at my apartment complex's pool, feet hanging in the water, downing a bottle of wine and talking way too loudly about swatsticas (does anyone know how to spell that?  can't find it in the dictionary.  Anyway, just think "Nazi") and moving to foreign lands (Chicago and Minneapolis).  Don't ask where the Nazi symbolism comes in because it would be too hard to explain, and you wouldn't care anyway.    SO many laughs were had before I was told we were going to a bar next.  I didn't mind, because drinking is fun and after sharing a bottle of wine, no one says "no."  I'm not saying I got raped or anything, I just agreed to go to a bar.  More alcohol was consumed at The Library (bar and grill.. not book place).  Lauren got to steal another glass from there to complete her set of four, and I stole two glasses to complete my set of SIX.  They're great, they say "The Library Bar and Grill Norman Oklahoma"  I'm glad that I'll have those great glasses for whenever I move.  I will drink from them and say "ahhh, Norman, I used to live there."    It was a night of steals actually.  There's a wooden "Pool Closed" sign hanging in my laundry room right not actually.  You see, the pool was apparently closed when we went to drink our wine by it.  So, naturally, we jumped the fence, drank our wine by the pool anyway, and then took the damn "Pool Closed" sign on our way out.  I'd have taken a lawn chair, but they were heavy.  ANYwhoo.. the evening spilled over into today.  We downloaded some annoying music on the computer, sang along, etc.  Watched some TV for a while.  I got my haircut while Lauren wandered around Campus Corner going in and out of shops and mysteriously walking by the windows of the hair-cutting-place I was in.. eyeing me suspiciously and making me laugh.  OH OH, we ate pizza too.  FANTASTIC pizza at Hideaway.  After a couple of hours in the Campus Corner area, we came back to to my apartment to visit for a bit.  I began to inform Lauren of the things I'm learning in my Consumer Behavior book about sub-cultures and whatnot.  You know, Jews are rich apparently, gays can't get married and therefore financial services related to couples are important to them, whites like picnics and credit cards, and only half of the Arabs in the United States are muslim.  Who'da'thunk it?  All very useful.  Someday someone will ask me SOMETHING about this shit in a game of Trivial Pursuit.  "I KNOW I KNOW- ARABS!" I'll yell, and then receive a piece of the plastic pie.  You know, come to think of it, lauren came over yesterday to give me a magnet she purchased for me in Minneapolis.  She just left, after about 22 hours, and I still never got my magnet.  Oh well.  HOPEFULLY that means there will be another excuse to spend such a good time together in the future.  The code for "lets spend a good time together" will be: "hey, why don't you.. bring over that magnet."    Well, back to studying.  I took a 15 minute break so that I could write a little somethin-somethin.

      When I woke up today, I could not help but be jealous of the dog.  Has this ever happened to you?    My alarm went off, and in between snooze 1, 2, 3 and 4, I could hear the rumble of thunder outside.  The lack of bright light coming through the curtains alluded to the fact that there was probably not much sunlight outside, confirming the thunder's weather forecast.  I LOVE rainy days.  I wandered into the living room, Boomer (dog) following me along.  I think I even verbally (okay I know I did) said "Boomer you're lucky you get to stay home today."  He just wanted to eat and pee though.  I hope this gentle rain continues throughout the entire day.  That would make me happy.  I think rain all the time would be kind of depressing, so it's not like I'm going to race off to Seattle to live.  Days like this, however, are a welcome change to me.  They actually make me feel more productive, like I'm able to get things accomplished in the safety of the indoors and I'm not missing a damn thing outside.  Besides, it's like a nice, soothing soundtrack to my day.  As if, however, if it were sunny I'd be biking around town or something though, but whatever.  Toodle-doo.. cruisin' around on my bike, maybe with a basket on the front of it, whatever, you don't know.  I don't own a bike.  If I did it wouldn't have a basket on it.  I wish I did own a bike though, and I think it's something that I will purchase whenever I move to Chicago.  As long as the area I live in is conducive to bike riding, consider it done.. basket and all.  Okay, no basket but I will toodle-doo around town.  well no toodle-doo, but I WILL ride it.. maybe.

      Shrek 2 - A movie I WANT to see for the first time Where The Heart Is - a movie i DON'T want to see for the 78th time.  I'm just minding my own business.  It's been a long day.  I want to relax on the couch before I go to the gym and just watch some TV.  I was fooled into thinking this would be a good idea by the two episodes of the Simpson's that I visually consumed.  Suddenly, out of NO where, the viewing options have DISAPPEARED as if David Copperfield (total douchebag by the way) performed some sort of magic trick on my TV wherein everything interesting VANISHED.  There is now a selection of shit to watch.  They seriously are playing Where The Heart Is, AGAIN, on TV. First time around, sure, it was feel-good and tolerable.  Lauren HATES this movie so much that it's almost funny and I must admit I'm not that far behind at this point.  They play the damn thing on TV probably once every 20 minutes.  Natalie Portman's horrible accent coupled with the plot that involves more peril than is even believable, give lauren and I PLENTY of laughs.  I think we actually had an entire phone conversation the other night dedicated to just how horrible the movie really is.  The bad accents, the unrealistic tornado scene, a character named "Forney" (*ahem* cation?), etc.  Ripping the movie apart and laughing about it with lauren turned a movie that was completely benign in my mind into an evil enemy that I now hate.  And by hate I mean LOVE to hate.  and by love i mean GET IT AWAY from me, I hate it, but let me make fun of it.  Natalie Portman's character would have surely killed herself after all the peril present in that plot.  Shrek 2, I REALLY wanna see.  That movie looks great.  I can watch Where The Heart Is or a music video channel based in Canada called FUSE that is dedicating the next hour entirely to music by Incubus (sorry guys, just not a huge fan), or frickin TRL on MTV.  None of these options appeal to me.   One thing that they do like to show a lot of on MTV are the "Truth" commercials about smoking.  Light me and smoke me if I'm wrong, but aren't these commercial irritating?  I think they are.  I don't smoke and I personally don't even care to have smoking in public places either.  I do, however, despise the Truth commercials.  I want to punch people in the back that lay mannequins all over the streets of NYC in order to prove a point related to how many people die from cigarette smoke every year.  I guess it sends a good message to youth, but don't tell me how your grandma is a martyr because she chose to smoke.  Deaths due to smoking = sad.  Marketing to children by "Big tobacco" = bad too.  Claiming you didn't know any better by inhaling smoke into your lungs and then blaming it on someone else = annoying.  Shave your head in public to protest cigarettes if you want, but the bitch couldn't have thought smoking was healthy.  SORRY.  These chics don't even know the name of my band.. but they're all on me like they wanna hold hands... oops where was I...  I'm so happy it's Friday:)  OH OH OH 3 minutes until Where The Heart Is comes on!  "You hear that?  That lil' bomp bomp bomp.. that's where the heart is."  Shut up Natalie, just SHUT UP! I wish you had fallen through the hole in your boyfriends' car instead of your flip flops.  That would have made for a better plot.  HA!

      Why the shampoo/crotch reference?  Because people who leave away messages on their instant messaging programs that literally spell out what they are doing.. should shampoo my crotch.  period.  Leave something humorous, yes.  Leave the standard "I am away from my computer right now." fine.  Select "I am on the telephone." okay.  But don't tell me what you're doing, who you are doing it with, and leave us all stereotyped as people who give a flying fuck about how you are consuming the moments of your day.  Bring something to the table worth while, like a joke.  Make me laugh with something witty.  "Went to the post office with Suzy, then to the bank, and finally some relaxation time in front of the TV with my pals," on the other hand, is NOT acceptable.  A former friend of mine used to post an away message daily.  I swear he was never actually available online, but simply switched from one away message to the next depending on the changes in events of the day.  It got to the point that it was so irritatingly funny, that I would update another friend through e-mail of the best away message of the day.  Each day I would e-mail my friend with the one-liner that appeared in the other friend's away message.  I guess it sounds pretty stupid, but the messages were just so ridiculously detailed that it drove me crazy.  "Gone to the grocery store, then cooking dinner for the gang" or something as obnoxiously youth-groupish.  Next:  My trainer is @ DisneyWorld with his family.  Shawn, come back.  Not only am I slacking on my workout without the motivation of paying you, I miss our reality-TV chats each week.  It's hilarious to go to the male version of a beauty parlor (the gym) three times a week and banter with Shawn for an hour.  We started discussing ABC's "The Bachelor" each week because one of the "Bachelorettes" was an OU student my age, who also worked out at the gym.  Trainer-Shawn and I would laugh it up each week "did you SEE how she was all.."  Not to mention my brothers' ex-fiance was one of the contestants too, though short-lived on the show, we had plenty of material to work with.  It's amazing the things you learn.  I love hearing all the scoop on everyone else that works out there.  Makes me kind of skeptical to open up too much, who knows what material I'm giving Shawn for the next trainee.  "Oh that Mason character.."  nah, who am I kidding.  What's he gonna tell someone else about me, that I don't do my cardio like I should.  JUICY SHIT!   So many quasi-celebrities out of just one simple workout facility as well.  The runner-up on "The Bachelor," for one.  Then there's that guy who got beheaded in Iraq (or wherever).  He apparently worked out at the gym and lived here a few years back.  Even a famous pornstar from Norman that used to work out there when he lived in Oklahoma still.  Shawn knew the pornstar guy's family well and apparently I resemble him so much that Shawn used to call me by the pornstar's first name a lot (his real name, not his "porn name").  I finally was like "who is Dan (or whatever his name was, I forget) and why do you keep calling me that?  He explained.  NATURALLY I did a Google image search, and I have to disagree that I look like him.  Besides, I'm not as built.  I'll take it as a compliment though regardless.  Shawn said I should take it as such, as the guy was "quite a stud."  What else, what else.  Oh I guess I'll just stop talking about the gym and GO there to do my cardio.  That's what I was supposed to be doing 30 minutes ago anyway, then I decided to post.  Maybe that is why the majority of this post was about the damn gym.    Off I go, but before I do, I'm going to post my away message on AOL Instant messenger.  I think the appropriate message should be: "Lather, rinse, repeat motha fucka."

      One of my last Norman, Oklahoma friends departed yesterday and it was sad to see you go.  I guess it's all very sad.  All this change, all the goodbye's, that whole.. thing.  Norman is a dead-ass place now.  lauren and I were able to cause some last minute havok though, before she shoved off.  Havok wasn't really much more than drinking beer on my balcony and then falling asleep, but it was a fun time.  Can't help but be sad to see you go.  Can't help but be sad to see fun times go too.  Just a few acquaintances basically still remain in this town that seems so unfamiliar these days.  I drive around and stop in places that seem so memorable, only to recognize no one and feel older than everyone.  It's like that whole "alone in a crowded room" feeling.  Everything looks familiar, but nothing seems to feel the same.  Time is pushing me out of here.  So, needless to say, it's boring around here and I'm anxious to get the next few months over with and be done with this place too.  It's not that I'm hating it a ton or anything, but there's just nothing left.  It's just a place now.  Like staying in an empty apartment, the walls of this town seem bare and filled with holes where memories once hung, and the rooms seem too big and empty.  The streets almost echo when I walk down them.  I don't walk down the street very often, but I imagine these things, you see.  Everything changes, and it is so weird how the timing seems right.  Running off from this place in the middle of things being the same would feel sad.  Six months ago I would be leaving things behind.  Departing knowing that I'm leaving nothing behind fits better.  Back to that empty apartment example though: it sure is bland around here.  I went to Wal-Mart tonight to get ONE thing, and wound up with 50 bucks worth, of course.  I hate how that happens.  I also hate how it was so crowded.  I let a guy go ahead of me because he was buying 3 things.  Nice deed of the day.. DONE!  I squeezed it in just before midnight.  Just kidding, I have no "nice deed quota" each day.  More like one each month.  Kidding again.  Year.  K, again.. with the kidding.  I'm off to bed now.  Goodnight.

      Hi friends.&nbsp; I am currently on assignment for lauren.&nbsp; Not really, but I guest-posted for her tonight.&nbsp; She's been having a hard time getting around to&nbsp; posting lately, so I figured what better way to motivate her to post than to take over her blog and appaul some people.&nbsp; She will quickly realize that&nbsp;I have defaced her personal niche of the web and be back to posting in NO time.&nbsp; You may go there, if you like, and check out my post because I have nothing for you here today.&nbsp; I'm all out of things to say after posting for someone else.&nbsp; Besides, she's a good read anyway, so check her stuff out.&nbsp; urlLink  Here's the link .&nbsp;

      Oh hi again.&nbsp;   Might I begin, firstly, by saying that I looked at my site meter tonight, as i often do, to see how people were finding my blog.&nbsp; The usual things were there.&nbsp; People linked in from lauren's fantastic  urlLink http://ellekinzy.blogspot.com .&nbsp; Some had gotten there just by typing the address in.&nbsp; There was the person who searched yahoo.com for "Pimps Across The World" and ended up on my site for some reason.&nbsp; But more exciting than even Pimps Across The World (I'm going to start assuming I'm one of them that is representing the mid-states and central Oklahoma region) was that I was linked from a blog that I have not heard of.&nbsp; "wha...?" I said to myself, and went to check said blog out.&nbsp; Someone has linked me on their site under the heading "Favorite Blogs," and better yet:&nbsp; there are only three listed.&nbsp; I am flattered.&nbsp; I'm&nbsp;sure that if he ever sees this, he will quickly delete the link because I have now appeared to feel a little too special about the whole ordeal.&nbsp; Seriously though, what a flattery that someone has somehow stumbled onto my weblog and decided it was one of their "Favorite" blogs to read!&nbsp; Of course, I read every entry on his.&nbsp; I enjoyed it quite a lot, and in case you ARE reading this- you've got a new fan too!&nbsp; Thank you mystery person who lives in Chicago of all places (see ya there).&nbsp;   Anyhow.&nbsp; Back to the title of my blog.&nbsp; *Ahem* where was I.&nbsp; OH, I was tired, that's where I was.&nbsp; Last night I got out of the shower and had a message on my cell phone from lauren who said "if you're still up give me a call" (or something to that effect, strewn with racial slurs and curse words though probably).&nbsp; Just kidding, no, but if I was up lauren wanted to talk and so we did.. for.. over.. EIGHT.. hours.&nbsp; SIX and a half of those hours were consecutive.&nbsp; It has been a long time since we have been able to do that, it was like old times.&nbsp; Like old summers that lauren worked the internship at the news channel in Oklahoma City and we would stay up all night bull shitting until finally I would hear something in the background and say "what was that?"&nbsp; She would say "well, that's my alarm&nbsp;clock going off&nbsp;and it's time to 'get up' to go to work."&nbsp; We'd laugh, she'd go to work and I'd take myself a nap.&nbsp; Today, however, roles were reversed and I was sitting on the edge of my bed at 7am when I said "okay, just so you know, I'm going to go ahead and get dressed for class."&nbsp; It didn't stop there.&nbsp; We talked until I was literally walking into the door of my classroom at 8:40am.&nbsp;   On MY watch it felt like it was about 4am, and I had been up all night and was just&nbsp;winding down and getting sleepy for night-night-time.&nbsp;&nbsp; On everyone else's watch it truly&nbsp;was in or around the hour of&nbsp;8am and they were not happy to&nbsp;be out of their beds. &nbsp;It was really weird to see everyone looking depressingly tired, making mouth-love to Styrofoam cups of coffee from 7-11, appearing disgusted to be alive.&nbsp; I, on the other hand, looked better than I've looked for class all summer.&nbsp; I didn't just roll out of bed (didn't get in it at all), so I actually had time to not just throw-on-a-hat-and-go.&nbsp; I felt kind of drunk, to tell you the truth, from lack of sleep.&nbsp; We discussed our case-studies on EuroDisney's failure and subsequent revitalization, and I offered my my insights with full force (much like an intoxicated student would, which I have been intoxicated in class before so I would know, I'll save that for another post).&nbsp; I was on my A-game.&nbsp; I started thinking "shit, I should NOT sleep more often."&nbsp; I had the class laughing at my remarks and I was starting to wonder why I hadn't been so entertaining all summer.&nbsp; When Dr. Gross asked me where I thought the next Disney Endeavor should take place while taking into consideration the mistakes made at EuroDisney, and my reply was "Tulsa."&nbsp; I wasn't serious.&nbsp; Somehow it was funny to sleepy seniors though.   I came home and fell asleep around noon for close to 5 hours.&nbsp; Waking, as if nothing, and "staring" the rest of my day.  Speaking of class, I am finished with class after my exam tomorrow.&nbsp; I will be done with college forever, and I'm having a very hard time letting that information sink in.&nbsp; I was supposed to be done in May, but OOPS road block - I was diverted to summer school.&nbsp; No big deal (psssh, I say that now), and I am finished as of tomorrow at about 9am.&nbsp; Raise your glasses in a toast to me, the new college graduate.&nbsp;   I am getting sad about the things I can't take with me when I move.&nbsp; Of course I&nbsp;will miss the&nbsp;really important things like friends and&nbsp;Sonic Drive-in, but I mean the things I don't think about on a daily basis:&nbsp; My washer and dryer, my cheap rent (compared to Chicago anyway), my fire place, my balcony, my plants.&nbsp; I'm actually quite sad about my plants on my balcony.&nbsp; I will feel bad just, like, throwing them away.&nbsp; How DOES one dispose of a plant?&nbsp; I feel like i'm about to abort the poor living things.&nbsp; Shouldn't there be some protocol for doing away with balcony palm trees like there is with disposing of the U.S. flag?&nbsp; I guess I'll burn them or something.&nbsp; Just kidding.&nbsp; The plant in my kitchen though, it WILL go with me.&nbsp; I will take it in my car if I have to.&nbsp; That thing has survived since my freshman dorm room in Tulsa.&nbsp; I will be taking her (i should name her) with me.&nbsp; Just me, Betty (just named her) and the open road.   Goodnight.

      Anyone who knows me knows that I'm not a "reader."&nbsp;   Therefore, it is a BIG deal in Masonland that I've not only read a book on my own accord this summer, but I'm finishing novel number two in my spare time, and.. and.. (drumroll please) no more than 10 minutes ago I finished reading a 600 page textbook.&nbsp;   For the first time in my entire life, I read the ENTIRE&nbsp;text, cover to cover, exhibits, figures, side-notes and all.&nbsp; I can officially say I read the first page through the last, and I feel quite accomplished.&nbsp; Sure, I've skimmed textbooks before, I think we all have.&nbsp; But it was quite&nbsp;refreshing to actually read the last line of the textbook and know that I had completed 600 pages of information in a matter of a few weeks.&nbsp; Might I take a minute to pat myself on the back?&nbsp; I think I will.&nbsp; :)&nbsp; I feel good.&nbsp; I&nbsp;feel real good.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

      I just got off the phone with poison control.&nbsp; my mouth was hurting really bad and so I took my demorol for the evening and put myself to bed.&nbsp; About 40 min later I woke up to my mouth still throbbing in pain.&nbsp; Without thinking, I popped an 800mg prescription ibuprofen tablet.&nbsp; Then was like "oops, is that too much.."&nbsp;   I'm dizzy now, but apparently Joe Poisoncontrol said I'm in no real harm other than some really nice sleep I'll be experiencing soon.   I'll be damned though.. the pain disappeared.   Goodnight.

      I once had&nbsp;a&nbsp;close&nbsp;family member tell me&nbsp;that if it were not for the way it would affect  me , they would probably decide to&nbsp;and possibly would already have taken their own life.&nbsp;&nbsp;These words were said to me in the midst of the most difficult thing this person would ever go through, and consequently the most difficult time in my life, to date.&nbsp; I remember where I was standing and I remember how it made me feel.&nbsp; I remember feeling stunned and partly angered that I was burdened with being the only one someone felt the need to stay alive for.&nbsp; I remember being scared, because it wasn't said in hindsight, but rather in the throws of a tormenting time that was far from&nbsp;over, and therefore the option&nbsp;to check-out of life was still on the table at any given time.&nbsp; I was angry that I had to worry about it everytime I left the house.&nbsp; To know that someone I cared for has contemplated, in their darkest hour, removing themselves from the bonds of human existence, only stopping the train of thought&nbsp;after&nbsp;imagining how it would impact&nbsp;  me  &nbsp;was too much to hear at age fifteen.&nbsp; Possibly at any age.  &nbsp;  It was eerie every morning, getting up and walking down the hallway of my parents house on my way out the door to school, and passing the gun closet.&nbsp; The door&nbsp;had&nbsp;always&nbsp;been&nbsp;closed, but I&nbsp;noticed one morning that&nbsp;someone (presumably my father)&nbsp;had taken the time to install a deadbolt lock and remove the key.&nbsp;&nbsp;It&nbsp;made me feel uncomfortable and reminded me that it was no secret what was going on.&nbsp; It was like the idea of "The Club" on&nbsp;the steering wheel of a car.&nbsp; It didn't mean it wasn't possible to commit the crime if you really wanted to, but hopefully it&nbsp;just made it that much&nbsp;harder for the person&nbsp;to follow through with the act&nbsp;when no one was around.&nbsp; I would imagine what it would be like to be the first one home to a suicide, and wondered if a deadbolt on an entire room full of firearms would really "deter" a person from getting inside.&nbsp;&nbsp;Would they just&nbsp;find another means to do it, or would it really&nbsp;buy some time, much like the club on the steering wheel, until attention was drawn to the situation and the crime could be stopped by the parking lot patrol.  &nbsp;  Each morning as I passed the closet, I would&nbsp;turn the handle&nbsp;to make sure it was locked before I left the house.&nbsp; It was as&nbsp;if a reminder note was left for me every morning on my way to the ninth grade:&nbsp; "Don't forget, things still suck."&nbsp; Even if somehow I had forgotten in my sleep, there was my reminder in the form of a doorknob.&nbsp; There was no way out of my house other than&nbsp;walking down the hall past the gun closet.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  I regret to this day that my response to my loved one's declaration that I was a reason for staying alive was: "You should have just&nbsp;killed yourself" as tears ran down my face.&nbsp; I&nbsp;was just hurt at the idea of someone I loved talking about leaving me.&nbsp; I didn't mean it.&nbsp; Of course I didn't mean it.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Sometimes at night, before I fall asleep, I have a half-awake nightmare that my advice was taken and this person was gone from my life.&nbsp; I lay there and&nbsp;wonder how it would make me feel.&nbsp; I wonder if I would have felt guilty,&nbsp;and&nbsp;if I would&nbsp;have told anyone about the conversation.&nbsp; And then I pray for my family, I pray for those I love, and I&nbsp;pray for sleep to come.  &nbsp;  Goodnight.

      tired?&nbsp; no.  &nbsp;  Lonely, as the Matchbox 20 song implies?&nbsp; nah.  &nbsp;  Drunk?&nbsp; I wish.  &nbsp;  No, actually I went to Barnes&amp;Noble this evening for about 2 hours and did my marketing readings.&nbsp; Joy.&nbsp; Then I came home, ate dinner,&nbsp;threw on some PJ pants and an old T-shirt and pretended to paint.&nbsp; I think this sucker will actually go on the wall.&nbsp; I'm not very good at painting, but it's fun to do it and think.&nbsp;&nbsp;Then more&nbsp;often than not I&nbsp;throw the canvas away and count my losses.&nbsp; 1, 2, 3, 4... LOSS.  &nbsp;  Here is how lazy I am:  &nbsp;  I went to Wal-Mart tonight (no, that's not the reason I'm so lazy, shit, YOU'RE lazy for not wanting to sit through the story.. stay with me).&nbsp; At Wal-Mart I decided to treat myself to a Pepsi, since I have been so good about not drinking&nbsp;any sodas.&nbsp; I was&nbsp;excited to learn that there was a BILLION DOLLAR twist-off-cap-contest-thing.&nbsp; Then I realized you have to enter the code from the cap into a website.&nbsp; I got home, figured it was worth a shot, and half way through, I got bored with the 6 questions it asked, and closed the internet browser.&nbsp; A BILLION dollars, and I was too lazy to finish filling out "Name:____, Phone:_____, Blood Type:______, Penis Size:_____" etc.&nbsp; I just didn't care.&nbsp; Keep your damn Billion dollars, Pepsi.&nbsp; How are they giving away a BILLION dollars anyway?&nbsp; I don't buy it, not even for a billion dollars I don't buy it.  &nbsp;  I shall have a hard time getting to sleep tonight.&nbsp; I coasted into my apartment about about 4:Something AM last night from drinking and was about ready to hit the sheets when I realized there were no sheets to hit.&nbsp; "Fuckin' A" I half-heartedly exclaimed, as I made my way to the washing machine which housed my wet, ready-to-be-dried sheets.&nbsp; I had to put those dirty bastards (well, clean bastards really) in the dryer and sit around cross-eyed for a good 40 minutes until I could make my bed.&nbsp; Needless to say it was around sunrise when I drifted off into dreams.&nbsp; I managed to make it past the hour of 2pm before getting out of bed.&nbsp; Good morning world, lets eat!  &nbsp;  Now, I sit in my dining room, apartment lit up like a 90 year old's birthday cake, beer sitting next to me, empty pepsi bottle (possibly containing the winning BILLION DOLLAR CODE) sitting next to that, and AOL Radio playing "That's The Night That The Lights Went Out In Georgia" (God that's a long song title).  &nbsp;  Well, I can't promise it will be soon, but I will say goodnight and let the lights go out in Norman, or at least in my apartment.&nbsp; At 4:11am (the present time) I'm pretty sure the lights have been out in Norman for some time now.  &nbsp;  Goodnight.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;

      I'm going to get so many search engine hits for posting a blog with the title "Demorol" I just know it.&nbsp; I should throw in some other keywords people will probably search for related to demorol, just to get more google hits.&nbsp; Canada, Free, XXX, no prescription, opiate, Rx, yadda yadda.&nbsp; Some poor sap is gonna be desperate for Demorol and end up here.&nbsp; Sorry, got nothing for you.  &nbsp;  I do have some demorol though, but you can't have it.&nbsp; I just took one, I'm hoping it makes me go to sleep.&nbsp; It was prescribed to me after my FIVE hour dentist appointment two days ago.&nbsp; Thankfully, I barely remember any of it.&nbsp; I haven't mentioned this dental extravaganza&nbsp;on the ole' blogger, because A) no one cares and B) I just haven't... but I'm having lots of dental work done this summer, so there, it's mentioned.&nbsp; My ever-troublesome teeth are being completely fixed up for good this summer, and all in several very long appointments.&nbsp; 5 apointments to be exact.&nbsp;&nbsp;Ever seen an episode of extreme make-over?&nbsp; Well the parts where they do the cosmetic dentistry.. that's my summer vacation (insert "woo").&nbsp; Some go to Paris, some go to the lake, I go to the dentist.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  I hate the dentist, well actually I LOVE my new dentist, but I hate the idea of "going" to the dentist.&nbsp; I always have hated it, hence I have neglected the health and stability of my mouth by avoiding dental exams at all costs.&nbsp; Though they are aesthetically fine, and seemingly normal in appearance, my teeth&nbsp;possess many small problems that will all be corrected over the course of the next few months.&nbsp; Hell, over the past few years&nbsp;my teeth have&nbsp;practically been breaking out of my mouth, sometimes with the help of drunken&nbsp;asses knocking them out.. (I should send you the bill).&nbsp;&nbsp; Am I excited about all the dental appointments?&nbsp; Not really.&nbsp; Do like the fact that they knock me out each time I go in there and when I wake up I have new and exciting things in my mouth?&nbsp; Yeah.&nbsp; I am trying to look at the bright side.&nbsp; Maybe I'll throw up some "before and after" shit after it's all finished.&nbsp; They've only taken about 25 pictures of my mouth so far.&nbsp; And one of me with my pants down when they thought I was knocked out in the dental chair.. but I CAUGHT them.&nbsp; Silly bastards.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  jk.  &nbsp;  I haven't been too talkative lately and especially not too write-a-tive, as you can tell from my lack of postings.&nbsp; I have had kind of a lot on my plate and it constantly seems like one thing after another when you're stressed.&nbsp; Sometimes when life gets so busy, I don't have the energy to be there for everyone else, and I just need some time for me.&nbsp; I hate that, because I like to be the ear for friends, and the fun times for people I enjoy being around, but sometimes you just have to step back and handle your own shit.&nbsp; The GOOD news, however, is that things are looking so up.&nbsp; In fact things are turning into perfection.&nbsp; I have been in a really downer type mood for the past few months due to some annoying circumstances on the homefront, possible graduation&nbsp;hindrances, etc..&nbsp;but everything is coming up roses now.&nbsp; I appreciate all the support of people who care about me during the stresses of life (all of them, not just these).&nbsp; I kept saying that the rest of my life, especially the rest of this calendar year, better be fantastic because it's been a hell of a year so far.&nbsp; Thankfully, it appears that life will exceed my greatest expectations in the coming months and years.&nbsp; I plan on it.  &nbsp;  I got a speeding ticket today.&nbsp; That was funny.&nbsp; Officer Scott was so nice though.&nbsp; He was all: "Have you had a ticket lately?"&nbsp; and I thought for a moment, remembering that crazy night when I got an open container violation for transporting both lauren and an open bottle of wine back to her apartment.&nbsp; Thankfully that doesn't show on my record, as the officer that evening (name uknown) was equally&nbsp;generous.&nbsp; "No  don't think so, sir." I replied.&nbsp; My fourth "excessive speed" violation in the past 3 years was handed to me and I was free to go.&nbsp;&nbsp;It may sound like a&nbsp;bad offense, but basically it just means that I was "going over the speed limit," I get slapped on the hand, pay a 50 - 75 dollar fine, and go about my way with a clean record.&nbsp; I don't really have&nbsp;75 smackers laying around, but shit, I'll find it just&nbsp;to not have to take some defensive driving course.&nbsp; I said&nbsp; a little thank-you prayer as I continued on my way to the gym (at a reduced speed of 40 mph instead of the 58 mph I was clocked at).&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Geeze, what a bust it would have been to get a "real" ticket just for going to the gym.&nbsp; It would have probably made me stop working out forever.&nbsp; "didn't you used to go to the gym, like, ALL the time Mason?"&nbsp; "yeah, but then I got a speeding ticket.. and I just said.. fuck it, this is not worth that kind of shit"

      Sometimes I'm too anxious for the next chapter.  It's so hard to remind myself to enjoy what is "now" and not anticipate too heavily what is next.  Things seem so hectic and stressful lately that it is difficult to enjoy this "now" crap.  My back is in knots with stress.  I will sing a song to myself now, and I will remember the words until I'm past "now" and safely settled into my new life.  I tend to forget, at times, that my future doesn't have a specific start time.  I neglect to remember that the rest of my life will start soon, things will fall into place, and I don't need to push so hard.    "Slow down you crazy child You're so ambitious for a juvenile But then if you're so smart tell me why You are still so afraid?   Where's the fire, what's the hurry about? You better cool it off before you burn it out You got so much to do and only So many hours in a day   But you know that when the truth is told That you can get what you want Or you can just get old You're gonna kick off before you even get halfway through When will you realize Chicago waits for you   Slow down you're doing fine You can't be everything you want to be Before your time Although it's so romantic on the borderline tonight Too bad; but it's the life you lead You're so ahead of yourself That you forgot what you need Though you can see when you're wrong You know you can't always see when you're right  You got your passion you got your pride But don't you know only fools are satisfied? Dream on, but don't imagine they'll all come true When will you realize Chicago waits for you   Slow down you crazy child Take the phone off the hook And disappeaar for a while It's alright you can afford to lose a day or two When will you realize Chicago waits for you."
