       Weather: Cool, Clear - Night   Mood: Chillaxed   Music: Christina Milian - Dip It Low      Have you ever realized that the time that you have to think about yourself and your well-being is becoming more and more limited?  I certainly did today.       Today, more specifically this evening, I took some time away from my usual distractions - senseless arrands, instant messenger and the internet in general to reflect on things I do in everyday life that I may take for granted or want to work on changing.      For me, fitness has somewhat always been a challenge...not being able to properly manage the time I have in the day has detered me in the past and continues to do so today.  I've bought some health/fitness books in the past and always thought about doing one of those trend diets/fitness regimes, regimes like Body For Life, Atkins, South Beach...and so on.  Today I pulled out my copy of Body for Life and took a quick look over it again now recognizing I want to do this and make it work.      The motivation was kind of odd...for some reason I had come up with this idea that everyone can diet and workout with ease but after reviewing some of the additional materials found on bodyforlife.com I came to realize that I'm not the only one that struggles with this.  The diet is not my struggle, more so the working out part.        Just to clairify diet is used in the sense of a balanced diet, not in the sense or with the intentions to reduce body weight.      Anyway, I found motivation from this particpant in the body for life program who had provided their successes with the program.  Reading further into the persons comments on the program he said he did it as a support tool for a friend who was on the program as well.  For some reason this got me thinking...seeing the results that can be had, having people recognize my results would help me to support their quest in attaining what someone I was motivated by had done and what I will do.      I've further thought out the process for success in the program.  There is a food component which requires some planning and i've taken it upon myself to come up with a meal plan one week ahead of the start week where I will outline my meal plans.      I think that this blog is going to be a great thing for my motivation, hopefully with time more people will come across my blog and chart my success and use me as their motivation.      What will I include on my daily blog starting 30AUG04?      - Meals for the day   - Personal Tips   - Work out   - General Observations and Suggestions      Well, bed calls...its been quite the day!      Till tomorrow... Matt
