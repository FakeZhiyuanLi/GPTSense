      Just as there are multiple stages in the mourning process, there are multiple stages that the newly unemployed pass through. As with mourning, there is the initial shock and sadness, followed by rage and then (hopefully not) quiet resignation. I haven't hit the quiet resignation state yet--I'm still rage, rage, raging against the dying of the paycheck--but a sense of mild anxiety has crept into my hunt for full employment with full benefits including death and dismemberment.   When I walk through the center of town these days, my eye is drawn to the corner window of the shops I pass in hopes that there might be a HELP WANTED sign. I no longer blithely stride past Payless Shoes or Tony's Bakery or even Pet Express. Now I check to see if there are any openings.   Last week, I even sat in the chilly back room of a nearby Trader Joe's to fill out their mammoth application. It felt odd listing the address of the grammar school I attended nearly 20 years ago but hey, that's what Joe wants, that's what Linda writes. Who am I to complain?   Sidebar whine: These flimsy applications never give you enough line space to give a proper brag about your extraordinary accomplishments and skills (i.e., type 40 wpm, can properly apply White Out, keep the office fridge free of mold colonies from the ancient leftovers and yogurts left behind by careless coworkers). And why the heck do I need to list the address and degree I received from my elementary school?! Does anyone actually go and check such things?   The last part of this intrusive application was a math test. As a lifelong math phobe, a chill ran through my breast. Could I do it? But once I saw the problems to be solved--simple arithmetic, carrying, borrowing, some long division, one word problem--I immediately unclenched. This is a breeze. Readers, I should say that I am not COMPLETELY, 100 percent unemployed. I do teach a part-time ESL/ABE literacy class a couple of nights a week. Part of the class involves teaching numeric literacy and after doing this for a few years, I have come to sort of like math.   Anyway, I finished the application and felt confident that I really kicked butt on the math test so I went to hand in my application. So I brought it over to a clerk who was stocking cruelty-free honey-oatmeal soap. "Let me find a manager," she said and proceeded to clang a very loud ship's bell. Every face in the store turned in shock at the tolling of this bell.   Trader Joe's is famous for its novel, quirky little touches -- all of the employees wear these kicky, retro Hawaiian shirts for example, and shoppers always get to sample something tasty like tofu Swedish meatballs or organic lox on spelt bagels. And the employees just seem so darned happy. Genuinely happy--not fake, "I'm only smiling because my job is on the line" kind of smiles one encounters in this miserably recessed economy. I wanted to work there because it looked like fun and the company provides health insurance for its employees if you work over a certain amount of hours. This is the type of part-time job that I could do without shame or embarrassment. It's actually hip and cool, plus I'd get a nifty discount on stuff. What more could a wage slave ask for?  But alas, it wasn't to be. The manager, a humorless troll, came over, gave me the once over, and took the application from my hands, promising to give me a call. Yeah, sure, I thought. I waited a week to call. I didn't want to seem too pushy but I know that in a rotten, molasses-type job market like this, such jobs are earned by tenacity and a certain sense of sticktuitiveness. Part of me knew that the troll had probably filed my application with its impressive calculations in the professional equivalent of a composte heap on her paper-strewn desk. But I wasn't about to give up without a fight. My sums were correct and besides, I look good in Hawaiian shirts and desperately want to get a 20 percent discount on cashew butter and Kashi. On the availability section, I had left myself wide open--seven days a week, any time, any shift.  I asked for the troll when I called and after about ten minutes of being on hold--no funky music to listen to, not even Billy Ocean's Caribbean Queen!--Her Royal Trollness answered in a haughty, "this better be important" voice. In my best ass-kissing, boot-licking, penant voice, I inquired if she had had a chance to look over my application and if there were any openings. I tried to sound sunny and hopeful and very, very humble. The power dynamic was so disgustingly obvious. I felt like a hapless prole (trying to get) caught in the wheel of the Corporate Machine. Just so I can get by. Now I know why my ancestors, just off the boat from the Old Country, were so fired up about unions and carried the tenets of socialism in their hearts even if they did outwardly subscribe to capitalism.  Well, I hated myself at that moment, the groveling I'd been reduced to and for what? A shitty, minimum wage job at a stupid novelty food store where I would get varicose veins from standing all day and a 10-minute break to wolf down stale oatmeal-raisin cookies and read yesterday's paper in the windowless and drafty backroom.   "Your schedule doesn't fit with what we're looking for at the moment," she lied. I was so perplexed and put off by such blatant mendacity that I practically hung up on her.   Disappointed and disillusioned, I logged on to the Idealist.com to look for some juicy, low-paying jobs in the non-profit sector. As much as I like the site, I have yet to ever get a response--even a postcard of acknowledgment--from any of the places I've applied to there. I think the bulk of the employers who post jobs at this site hope to lure in some fresh and hungry recent graduate (ideallly, from an Ivy League school) who will work for peanuts.   Are there any full time jobs out there these days? A recent Globe article described the now-common phenomenon of workers staying in the temp loop, going from one long-term temp job to another, with no hopes of getting a full-time, benefitted gig with outrageous perks like--gasp--health insurance! The temp to perm thing is now a myth, an anachronism. We have outsourced ourselves and all that is left for today's Stateside worker are mean little crumbs and futureless, deadend temp jobs that further ensure that today's youthful tempy is tomorrow's unretired, senior citizen bagger at Stop & Shop.

      The ecstasy (and uncertainty) of getting fired from a job you hate  On the afternoon of my 90-day evaluation, I walked the carpeted plank to my supervisor’s office with a mix of resignation, indifference, dread and curiosity. It was no secret that my supervisor—let’s call her Pat—was not thrilled with my ‘performance.’ Pat, a notoriously difficult person – I was her third assistant in less than a year – had not communicated her displeasure directly to me, as communication was not her forte, but through a series of interlopers and managerial go-betweens, one of whom claimed to be able to read Pat’s mind (she told me this with a solemn face and not a trace of irony so I knew she was serious.) Indeed, I felt like the seventh wife of Bluebeard going to meet the corporate equivalent of a murder.  The past few weeks, Pat had avoided me, rushing by my cube with her eyes plastered to the ground as if a glance in my direction might turn her into the proverbial pillar of salt. If I chanced to see her on one of her many runs to the coffee machine, she’d utter a terse ‘hi’ and march—never walk—away.  I walked into her windowless office with its dusty shelves of books and pics of her beloved dog and took a seat. Pat’s back was to me and she was engrossed in composing one of her eternal memos. When I greeted her, she started as if pricked by a needle and mumbled that she needed another minute. As I sat in the chair, I thought about my three possible fates in the next five minutes:   1) Pat would dispatch me with glee and efficiency and later congratulate herself on not only completing the memo but canning an employee in the same session – the pinnacle of multi-tasking! 2) I would be given a grave warning about my performance and put on probation. 3) I would summon up my confidence and tell Pat that I simply was not happy at this job and that I would be leaving—something I’d been wanting to do since the second day I walked into this corporate plantation masquerading as a non-profit.  Earlier that morning, when I first logged onto my computer, I skimmed a column directed at managers on the etiquette of firing an employee. The author, an expert on management, claimed that the most humane time to do it is Monday morning. This must be common knowledge among managers, I thought. Maybe my neck would be spared. It was Friday, after all.   But then, maybe fate #1 would be the best thing. Deep in the honest guts of my soul, I knew this was not the right job for me, with its niggling details, tedious and unrelenting little tasks that had to be done just so, the numbing routine, the eternal multi-tasking and Pat—all the while standing in the foreground, anxious and critical, ready with an exasperated sigh and cold stare of disapproval should I fail to dot an I or cross a T.   Thinking back over my three months at this organization a poem of Theodore Roethke’s came to mind. I read it as a freshman, before I’d ever worked in an office or any corporation, when all I knew of work had been the thrice weekly 3-7 pm shift at Dunkin Donuts. The poem—a mournful look at the desolation of office life—aptly called ‘Dolor’—hadn’t struck a chord when I first read it but now I knew what Roethke meant when he lamented “the inexorable sadness of pencils,” “the misery of manilla folders”  and “the duplicate grey standard faces.”  But it was a job – a full-time job with generous benefits like health insurance, a 401-K plan, even death and dismemberment. I had passwords, IDs embedded with chips that opened doors and elevators. Who could ask for anything more? In my ten years of working as an adjunct English instructor at a number of local colleges I had never experienced such a wealth of benefits—in fact, I had never had such benefits, period. It was nice to be able to go to the dentist and get one’s teeth cleaned or to sit with a nutritionist and talk about why microwaved popcorn (even low-fat popcorn) and coffee are not sound lunch choices.   Sure, I missed teaching and the autonomy of one’s own classroom, the rich and fascinating interaction with students but it was time to make some serious life choices and that involved compromise (right?) Taking this job was a compromise I thought I could live with. Thought.   If only I’d followed my mentors, Lloyd Dobbler (the sweet and steadfast protagonist of Say Anything and Gordon Comstock, antihero of George Orwell’s last great novel “Keep the Aspidistra Flying” a poet who takes a vow of penury to avoid serving the “money-god.”)  In retrospect, I realize that it was a mistake. This dream of melting into the corporate world was an impossible one, akin to a round peg trying to fit into a square. What was I thinking? I didn’t belong here—please fire me, Pat. Put me out of my misery!  With a final pound at the keyboard, Pat wrapped up her memo and abruptly swivelled her chair in my direction. Her neck was flushed and her nose was red—not a good sign, as I knew from my brief tenure working under her. The simple equation: neck rash = anxiety, excitability, irritation=the axe.   “Listen,” she began, with falling intonation as if she were trying to reason with the unreasonable. “I don’t know how to sugarcoat this in any way,” she began.   Sugarcoat? I thought to myself. When have you ever sugarcoated anything?!   “So I’m just going to say it. This job requires a strong attention to detail and you’ve made some small but important mistakes. I just don’t think it’s a good fit,” she said, waving her stubby fingers spasmodically, a look of euphoria spreading across her broad, pasty face.   Not a good fit? As in square pegs and round holes? You said it, Pat! My mind raced back to a month earlier, sitting in the company cafeteria where she had taken me to celebrate my birthday. “We’re so happy having you here,” she said, clasping these same stubby, spasmodic hands. “It’s really a great fit,” she said, digging into her caesar salad. My new colleagues had even presented me with a birthday card, hastily purchased at the neighboring Walgreens and signed by all. Pat had written, “You’re a wonderful addition to the Division!”  As I stood up to leave, Pat suddenly exclaimed, “Do you need any of these?” she said holding up some Filene’s Basement shopping bags emblazoned with the slogan, ‘I just got a bargain at Filene’s Basement!’ No thanks, I reassured her and headed out the door to my forlorn soon-to-be-vacant cubicle to pack up my personal affects.   Other than the initial adrenaline-fueled shock of getting canned, I felt fine, strangely unaffected. In fact, I felt…relief!  I wasn’t thinking about the tiresome chore of job-hunting that lay ahead, the resume revising and coverletter etiquette, the student loans and mortgage waiting anxiously in the wings.  It was nearly 4 p.m. on a brilliant Friday afternoon as I rode the elevator down one last time, my bag brimming with the knicknacks I’d festooned my cube with in an effort to lighten the dreary upholestered walls: a colorful wall hanging, a Year of the Monkey calendar from a Chinese restaurant and a blue glass disk which is supposed to ward off the evil eye. For a moment, I thought about jettisoning this mojo—a lot of good you did me, I thought—into the garbage can outside the elevator. Then it dawned on me that it had done its job and I was the luckiest person in the building.

      Greetings, Readers!  I am a new recruit to the ever-burgeoning army of the unemployed.   As much as I would like to, I can't pin this one on Dubya, either. It's my own fault and I blithely accept full responsibility for being jettisoned from the ole corporate plantation. Two of my favorite writers--Eric Blair (aka George Orwell) and Henry Miller--also made extraordinary contributions to the canon of unemployment literature (see Down and Out in Paris and London and Tropic of Capricorn). But I will neither attempt to follow their bold and inimitable paths in action or word -- nor could I even if I wanted to.  My blog will be more of a pedestrian and (I hope) amusing and thoughtful journey down the road of the professionally untethered. For your pleasure, I will recount my finest hour and catalog such experiences as:  * What it feels like to pack up the nicknacks that you festooned your cube with and march out of the building sans ID one last time,   * That first tentative call to the Department of Employment and Training(DET) to claim your unemployment benefits,  * The acute fear of the newly-unemployed which triggers a mad rush to fill out application forms at any and all businesses. Please hire me before I am whisked off to the workhouse!  * The interviews for jobs you don't really want and how you'll say anything and shamelessly embellish your "skills" to get a toe in the door.  * The waiting. The phone calls that send you sprinting to the phone. Registering with temp agencies and the whole subculture of the temp.  And more...  Welcome to blog, please stay tuned and live long and prosper!
