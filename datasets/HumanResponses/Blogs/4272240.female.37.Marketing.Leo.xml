      Well, I'm back but I only have a few minutes... It's friday and Preston is here with me this weekend :) ! We are getting ready to go visit some friends and play pee wee golf. Since May 28th the day I left my (x) husband we have been sharing custody. I have Preston 50% of the time. I really missed Preston a lot this week. Custody changed slightly in that we used to alternate m/t & every other weekend and now I have him "every" W/Thu and Every other Weekend. That means Jeff has him 5 days in a row :( That means more un-interrupted time for him to mess with Prestons head. Which he has been doing a lot already. Our hearing for support and custody was on the 9th. Yesterday I finally got the first "temporary" order for custody and support!!! We will be going back to re-argue but... Good news!, for the most part I WON. The custody will remain the same 50/50 but Prestons "primary" legal residence is with me!!! Jeff and I both have to attend Co-parenting classes/therapy and Preston will be attending private childrens therapy. I am really glad because he is so confused and Jeff's mental abuse has shifted from me to Preston. Besides that he is using Preston as a weapon against me and making poor Preston his crutch. We share holidays &amp; every other year we switch. I do have to pay the alimony but it is less the the $1400+ they were asking for. For now I have to pay him a sick $820 a month! That just makes me sooo sick. But you know what they say, what comes around goes around ... carma will catch him. Today I got a text message from Glenn his car was tampered with last night. Someone attempted to break in to it and the alarm system locked him out so he was unable to start the engine this morning.  He had to have his car towed to the shop. We both think it was Jeff since he has been making threats and as a matter of fact there are several interesting coincidences. 1. I got the Court Order in the mail yesterday. (which means he probably did too) 2. Preston told me last night that daddy is still gonna kill your friends mommy! He told me that he is. 3. Jeff dropped off my Van Key yesterday ( I have been asking for it for 3 months)  This whole thing is a mess but I am so much happier with my life. I have to say that my friends have been a tremendous support. Especially, My SISTER Mary, My Brother Tye, Glenn, Shauna,Peggy, Jen, Rachelle, Ken and my Daddy. If not for these people I would be a total wreck! I can't begin to thank them enough for all the LOVE, and Compassion, patience and understanding, guidance and confidence, encouragement and faith. You guys are the best!!! I hope I can return the favor or better yet just be someone you can count on no matter what. I love you guys!!!  Gotta go now we need to get going!!! Be back soon.....

      Hi, Yep, this is my first blog. Im just getting the feel for the whole idea of posting some of my most private thoughts. I like the idea that I can gain insight to some of my closest friends by reading what they have shared. I have to admit I am a little bit nervous about it. I notice though that I can choose which blogs are public and which are private so I guess I will give it a whirl.  The past two and a half years have been very trying and very rewarding. I have done some major sole searching, gone through some serious life changes, lost my mother to lung cancer, watched my sister suffer through brain surgery after discovering a tumor the size of an apple, re-connected with long lost friends and left my abusive husband of almost 10 years, sold my dream home as a result of the separation, I am a renter again (temporarily) and now I am re-discovering me! I am in a much better place thanks to GOD and a few other motivational factors in my life. I have learned so much about myself in this last two years, I think I have grown more (emotionally and spiritually) than in the last 15~years combined. I am a very fortunate person to have a loving family and many loving supportive friends, god has blessed me with my health, two beautiful boys Ricky 17 and Preston 5, a great career and many opportunities in life. I have always done well in my professional life but as of now have not made very good choices in my personal life.   I believe I was given something very special and two and a half years ago I made a choice     to finally stop being affraid.   I decided to get therapy (after several attempts in the past which were abruptly discontinued because of threats from my soon to be X). to help me to grow stronger and become my own person.  I decided it was time to stop waiting for permission to live my life. It has been a long process but I am learning to break some of my old patterns so that I can prevent myself from making the same mistakes I have made in the past. It amazes me how someone like me can become so comfortable in such pain, comfortable in abusive situations, always setteling for less than I deserve. I don't know how I became that way, it's not like I was abused as a child (not that I can remember). I am however 1 of 7 children. I have 5 brothers and just the one sister that I mentioned. *She,(Mary) by the way could use your prayers and well wishes. She came through the brain surgery 1 year ago April only to find more cancer in her lung, lymph glands, spine, kidney and now 2 more tumors have come back in her head. She amazes me every day! She is Strong, seemingly healthy (not sickly at all), in great spirits (I feel so guilty sometimes I find her cheering me up, like I have anything to cry about)! I love my sister so much!!! I hate to think I may loose her soon. I pray everyday that god will provide a miracle she is such a wonderful sole and I don't want to give her up yet. Mary is 10 years older than I am , she was married when I was seven, so I grew up in a house full of boys. I figure since there were so many of them and only one of me they always came first (sports,Jr. Achievments,Cub Scouts you name it) so I grew up learning to put their needs ahead of my own. Then when I began to date I just kept on giving and never getting (I guess I just wanted to feel loved and accepted by men), always thinking they were more worthy than I.  Not anymore. I am on a mission to give myself the time and energy I have always devoted to the men in my life!  WOW as you can see I am a talker..... hmmmm I will be back soon.  Thanks for sharing!
