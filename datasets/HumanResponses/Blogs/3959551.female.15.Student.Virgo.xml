       The 4400 is THE best show this summer. The only bad thing about it is having to wait an entire week for the new episode and another look at that gorgeous guy theyve got playing one of the characters. Yep, His name is&nbsp;Patrick Flueger and he is Oh So Nice! Yeah so they fired Nick and Sarah off of CSI. Apparently for "breach of contract violation" which i think is Grade A bullsh*t. They didnt show up for the first day of filming the new season because they had asked for more money, as if they weren't making enough as it was, but thats beside the point! Those were two of the best characters on that show and now theyre gonna have to bring in&nbsp;new people and the CSI fans are gonna be pissed which means a drop in ratings and then maybe they'll realize how retarded they were to do that. Meh. I'll get over it eventually. This house selling gig isnt working out as it should. We have to sell our house in about the next 90 days if that and we've had people look at our house but the two couples that wanted it have to sell their own houses first. So, if we dont get a contract on ours before our new house is ready for the drywalling to be done then we lose the new house, and $1500 that my parents put in for contingency. If that happens we have to find a new house and begin all over with that one. But, my parents told me that I might have to start school at Azle again and then move to Keller in the middle of the year. Switching schools in the middle of my Junior year isnt my idea of a great school experience. I guess I'll have to deal though. I hate being made to do something that i dont want to do. Grrr.    &nbsp;

        T - 3 weeks until school. It feels like summer just started. Ugh, stupid state&nbsp;making me attend public schools. Ive been hanging out with my boyfriend Billy the entire summer and its been great. But, he starts college in like 2 weeks and then i wont get to see him hardly at all. Between his job and his classes its gonna be all i can do to talk to him every once in a while. Sucks yes? Yep, sure does.Yeah my parents decided that they needed to be closer to their job so we're moving like 45 minutes away and that'll help my scheduling problems. It'll do wonders.   Verdammt!   I'm sure I'll be okay but we've been together for almost 8 months now and this is gonna brake us up i bet. I hate to say it but its inevitable. Of course my darling mother is trying to force me to get a job...not gonna happen. My parents are insane. I hate it when they think they can make you do what they want so they just annoy the crap out of you until you do it just to make them leave you alone. Heh. They think they are smart but little do they know. Oh well. I should be asleep but I think im an insomniac. Hmm...what exaclty is the occult? The only thing i know about it is that Tool has one of their songs named Faaip De Oiad, which means "Word&nbsp;of God" in Enochian which is an occult language. I guess it was just like a group of people or a belief or something.&nbsp;I dunno sounds creepy though. Yeah so The 4400 show that comes on Sunday is really good! Plus that guy they have playing one of the abductees is really friggin hot so that makes it better than anything else on a sunday night that i know of. Meh. Bedtime.
