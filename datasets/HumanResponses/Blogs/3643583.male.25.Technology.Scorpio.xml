      I got burnt to like so many others by the AOL phenomenon. Just moved to another city and since the Internet addiction is strong with me, and the DSL was comming only in about a week, I decided to go back to dialup for those remaining days. Since everybody in America has at least 2 AOL cd's in their house, I just took one, installed it and started using the service. Everything was fine and dandy. After I got hooked up with high speed I started researching how to stop my AOL account. One of the ways is to send them a letter with your account information and the other one is to call them. I called. This indian lady answered. I don't think that they were tought the word Cancel when they learned english. I tried other things like Terminate, Stop, Discontinue ... nothing worked. At one point I was wandering if I am talking to a person or to an Artificial Intelligence machine. Because The AI not being so evolved, sometimes does not understand exactly what we mean. Finally I hang up the phone because I was not getting anywhere. I get an e-mail saying that they gave me another 2 or 3 months free or whatever for their broadband service. Whatever. I decide that I don't use that shit anyway and also I decide what I already knew that their browser sucks, so I send the letter with the cancelation request and my info on it. Then I uninstall Aol and life happily ever after. That was at the end of november 2003. I begin to hear at work all sorts of legends about people that have been in the army or on 2-3 months business trips, cancelled their account before leaving and when they came back they realized that they were still charged. When talking to customer service, insted of giving them a refound they were offered AOL service for another 4-5 month so they can be repayed. *&^% that. I want my *&^%$#@ money back. We are sorry. You have not provided us with enough information on your cancelation request so it did not go through. I looked finally at my credit card report that I did not use for a while. I was shocked. I have been charged for the last 5 months with $8 something a month without me even having installed on my system AOL. Who's the looser now? I guess me, because on my phone conversation with the customer rep. everything was the same like the people in the legends I heard. My account was finally cancelled (I hope -I'll see that next month) adn I became a legend. When I asked for the money back I was offered 5 month for free. How convenient .... I hope they rot is Hell. I'll pray for that for me and all the people they scammed. And no I don't have money to sue them. That's what they count on I guess. They said they send me en e-mail saying that I did not give them enough information about my adress and shit. How the @#$% was I suppose to get that e-mail if I uninstalled Aol because I cancelled? I feel better now that I got it out, but I guess I will not be the last one robbed and I guess we can have a new phrase for the rest of the world that's saying ....   "At every ten minutes or so in America a new AOL legend is born"  Those Bastards ....
