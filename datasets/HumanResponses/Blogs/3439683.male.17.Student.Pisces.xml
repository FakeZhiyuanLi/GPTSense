      A pain so old, an unspeakable cold. What can this be? An anger fire in me? Desire so strong, but this is wrong. I shouldn’t hate, accept my fate I still can’t resign. Why can it be mine? I want what they have  Flames of jealousy, Raging inside of me. Am I any worse than them?  Why instead of me to him? But he’s my friend, will be there to the end,  So I won’t hate, but I can’t stop this debate I shiver at the thought of what society’s wrought, wrought in me  But that’s not it. Now complete the fit.  It throbs and stings to lack abstract things To be left wanting, to have nothing while they have it all.  Oh, what gall I want to cry, too afraid to try, but I confess the hurt  Jealousy and anger, The root the hurt. Threefold wheel, so very real, Two strong to break, only one uptake;  I’m entrapped, my strength is sapped I’m quietly screaming, but I have no meaning.  I’m the plague, Society-made, So just stay away.  written 5/2/04

      You’ve beaten me down Bound me up A great chain around my neck You’re pulling me hard Not willing to let me go I pull, you yank I choke and stumble back You just sit and laugh My struggle is weak Your grip is strong This I will concede You’ve got a good hold on me I’m tired, weary I feel like giving up  But if you think you’ve won this fight, I gotta tell ya, you’re wrong  I’m not yours Not past, not present, not future, NOT EVER I belong to God I belong in the light You are the oppressive darkness You haunt my steps You fill my head with lies But I don’t have to listen Because I’m not yours  You’ve taken my friends Dragged them to the dark You’ve got them in your snares They don’t even know it And those you couldn’t trap You placed beyond my reach They cannot end my plight Nor break the chains in sight You want me alone Away from freeing hands Want me to feel abandoned Down falls my spirit But I hear God’s voice calling Gently it says to me, “Do not give up, my child.” And I know, I am His  Exalted God, empower me Break loose the chains, the slave run free Flees to where You are, in the light The chains are strong, and I’ve waited long, But you, O God, can set me free  written 4/21/04

      Late that night, I hear them talk What they have done, what they will do I shake my head, begin to walk Don’t want to hear it, nothing new They say they want to talk to me, But I don’t think they really care What has true value, they can’t see Words will fall on deaf ears, it ain’t fair  What a world I live in Shallowness is a given They value what they see None of it given to me From it, I want to flee God, please set me free  I’m caught between pity and self Fight the lost cause, bring them to right? Or put thoughts of them on a shelf? Neither can do, give up the fight Never, never will they listen Set in their ways, ‘tis they that rule What is real gold does not glisten Their wealth is false; they are the fools  What a world I live in Shallowness is a given They value what they see None of it given to me From it, I want to flee God, please set me free  I’m here alone Day by day, just drags away  Tired of this roundabout road, On and on, forever it goes No end in grasp, no Freedom’s Path Can’t get out, I’m giving up Fight shadow and steel Can’t see it, but it’s all real Justice being served This existence I deserve I turned away, but I give up Trust I must once again  written 2/15/04

      (v. 1) Last night I had a dream  A calm voice speaks, and my heart hears  As a ray of hope, a light beam,  “My child, the time nears.”  My heart soars in joy  With bated breath, I ask, “When?  My Lord, I am still a boy.”  “My child, you will see her then.”   (chorus) Oh, God, it’s so far away.  “I am timeless. I give you peace.”  Lord, I don’t know if I can last that long.  “I am strong. I give you strength.”  Will she be all I hope for?  “My plan is perfect. Trust Me in all.”   (v. 2) I must admit, I’m scared  To see her there, the one I’ll love more  To make my heart, my feelings bared.  “This is who you’ve waited for.”  But what I fear more than this  That when I see her, even so,  I will not see her, who she is.  “My child, you will know.”   This was an actual dream I had. A vision of the future? a promise from God? I don't know.  Written 12/18/03

      Just another day in the boring life of a wallflower  I walk the halls, and I’m there, but I’m not really there  Most they ignore me; oh, if they only knew  That what they do in ignorance injures my heart   (chorus) God, I hate this limbo I’m in.  Why do I feel this way?  I am stumbling in the dark, Lord.  You say You have a plan, oh God  I lean on that promise, my Lord,  But it’s harder as time goes on.   But what do I know? Maybe my tears have no point.  Maybe it’s my fault, brought on me by myself.  I don’t deserve it, this thing I ask for.  I should not hope at all for it, futile it is.   (bridge) Sad story unread, thoughts filling my head  Alone in this world, never given a thought  Few of them care, their happy eyes are blind  They torment my heart, but for my hope, I still live   Written 12/11/03

      It is all for naught this emotion I feel. Tarried too long, I did. Never can it be with the one I love. How do I know what I cannot? The eyes, the voice, they tell me: It is all for naught this emotion you feel.  I hear the things that no one hears, I see the things that no one sees. ‘Tis that voice, ‘tis the eyes That pull me into the dark of despair.  The eyes refused to meet my gaze. It is an omen, but of what? Is it a sign of pity, of regret? Of this, I am almost certain.  The voice came as a death knell, The final sign that destroyed all hope. In it, I heard said what I saw in the eyes, It was there, in the hesitance, The reluctance in that once steady voice, That I knew…  This one was written in late September.

      This one was written 9/11/03  Who can stop me from falling?  Who can pull me out of the depths?  Who can give my life more meaning,  And make all my suffering worth it?   Up to my neck in water,  But I’m dry as a rock.  Apart from this world in so many ways,  I crave the water of fellowship, of belonging,  But still I go unquenched.   I know God is there, that He can help me,  But why isn’t that enough?  Is it that I seek the tangible?  Someone to love and confide in?  The deepest friendship one could have,  And maybe even more?   I that what I seek is what I have said,  But also understanding…  Can they comprehend me?  &nbsp;If I open myself up to them, will they scorn me still,  And drive me away as before?  Or upon understanding me, will they finally show me compassion and draw me in?  ‘Tis the uncertainty everyone faces, so why does it seem harder for me?

      Fire, water, earth and air Timeless called the ancients there Older still my sufferings be No beginning and still they see…  The pain I face, some may know Why to the end can’t I go? Long ahead the road still lies No light to greet my tear-filled eyes…  (Chorus) Love I seek, yet not have found Can it ever be? Anyone for me? Can it ever be? My heart cries within the ground.  I want it to be, I for you Only works if you love me too How I long, for my heart to give That for each other, we may live.  Never has anyone loved me I hurt so bad, can’t you see? My love I could truly show,  But still they turn and they tell me no.  (Bridge) My heart is in agony I can’t see through my tears Why won’t they reach out to me? Do they not care?  This one's old, written a few months shy of a year ago.

      another new thing about me.....got contacts. Doesn't sound like a big deal, but it is to me. Means I've finally graduated from nerdhood. I've had glasses for ten years, was dependent on them. Now, I'm not. Don't get me wrong, not all people with glasses are nerds....I was, though. So...after a haircut, loosing twenty-five pounds, and getting contacts, I look completely different. I suppose those are the improvements I was talking about....there all on the outside. Funny thing about all this though (and this is for all you philosophers to chew on), is that the closer I get to what society dictates as "cool", the more depressed I get. Maybe I used to be a nerd, but at least I was a happy nerd, completely oblivious to what others thought about me. Now, I seem to be more sensitive to that as I try to improve myself. It's not that "peer pressure" is getting to me and will make me do stupid stuff, I just want to be accepted by people. My freshman year in high school, "reject" was an appropriate term for me. I was completely alone. Now, going into my senior year, I'm no longer an outcast, I have friends, and no body dislikes me because they found that beneath my eccentricities and rather unattractive exterior, I'm a pretty nice guy. But I'm still rejected, mostly by the ladies. yeah, I'm sure some of you are laughing now. But some of you understand. I no longer get those looks of disgust, they'll talk to me and stuff (like I said, no one dislikes me now), but it goes no farther than that. You know, they say that girls aren't as superficial as guys are, and sometimes that's true. not in my case apparently. It's not my personality that stops them....it's what they see on the outside. That's the rejection that hurts the worst.  Wow, i feel really stupid for having written all that. Some of you are laughing at me, I don't care. Some of you are in my exact situation, and can sympathize. Some of you might feel sorry for me, and tell me that things will come out okay in the end, but I've heard all that before, and I don't believe it. I'm a cynical skeptic, and a hopeless romantic all in the same sandwich. I wanna see it happen in my life. I want it in my life. I just don't see it happening for a long time, if ever. Oi, I just need to shut up now.

      I was just looking through some profiles, found this girl with a bunch of similar interests, and she had her AIM sn posted, so I thought I'd give it a try. It worked! I'm talking to her right now. okay, now that I finished giving her the Flood tabs, I can continue...kinda...oi, I think I'm gonna give up till tomorrow, I'm talking to three people, and I can't write...aiee...

      yeah, it's late, and I'm tired, but I'm doin this. Went to this place with Jennifer, a bunch of people playing bluegrass music. it was pretty cool, this one guy told me to bring my guitar next time, said he'd show me how to play some stuff. Then other guy, he smashed a stink bomb right next to me, it was only the size of a pill, but DUDE.....that was putrid. Jen nearly puked. We left right after that. She dropped me off here, and I showed her that new song that I wrote. Noticed how beautiful she is, depressed me a little. I mean, she's just a friend, a really good one at that, but I couldn't help envying Chris M. a little. oh well. I'm over it now. I'm lucky to have her as a friend, and I need to keep my outlook on life positive, I realize that. That outlook says that there is someone out there for me that is better for me than anyone else, and that it won't be too much longer before I find her. I really don't have the energy to say any thing else tonight, I'm tired, so I'm outta here.

      One of the girls I liked, she was so pretty...reminded me of Melanie, you know, my book character. Just the way she was, kind of fit the profile. She said she is good at golf, like, shoots par average. I'd pay fifty bucks to see her and Joe play each other. That would be so cool...

      why'd I name my Utopia province that? yeah, I started that up again. Hope I'm in a good kingdom. I seem to be, but I'll reserve judgement until I see how they respond to a newcomer.  Aside from that, I'm sure you're anxious to hear about the forensic science camp. I really enjoyed it, the people were cool, it was pretty fun. It was actually challenging (imagine that...something actually stretched my brain). I only wore my wallflower suit for the first hour or two, but I was right about the depression. I got very depressed. See, that has to do with the fact that there were two girls that I liked...I'm sure you can fill in the blanks. I won't mention any names anyway because I know that one of them is probably going to read this. Found out that one of the girls there liked me, she told me last night on AIM. Found it flattering, but I'm just not interested. I mean, she'll probably end up as one of my friends, but no more than that. why is it that the girls I like are never interested in me? Lol. Well, check that...there is, or maybe was, an exception....Sarah...yeah, she liked me, I liked her, but she lives too far away. I still like her, don't know how she thinks anymore. Oh well. I'm feeling pretty good tonight, actually. hey, there's this annoying...damnit, stop! this stupid popup...that's the fifth time in a few seconds. It appears to be gone now, I suppose I continue. Based on Chrisanne's premonition and Stephani's agreement, I'm gonna try again with Sarah A. (different person from aforementioned Sarah). maybe she'll say yes this time. hey, whaddaya know, lost my train of thought...hey, found it floatin' around me 'ead... I wish i could talk to Jessica....she's probably pretty upset right now, lost a friend to AIDS. I'm tired, I'm getting off.

      I've got zero time right now....I don't even feel like ranting about what I was going to rant about...mostly politics (which I hate). I've got a ton to do, we're leaving for Boone today, I've got to: take the trash to the dump, wash my mom's truck by hand (she insists on that even though most car washes are brushless now), take my dog to the vet to board him for the weekend, go to Walmart for a few things, get a haircut, sign papers for the camp, vaccuum out the truck (dog hair), and pack. Have to be done with all of that by the time I have to get my haircut, which is at 1pm. I have two hours to do all that. aiee, it will never get done....

      Yeah, you know, one of those days where I don't have much time. I gotta leave in twenty minutes, wish I hadn't wasted so much time earlier. I have this idea for another story or novel (i get lots of these, a lot of them don't go anywhere), but the problem is, I don't have time to type it up right now, and I'm busy all day tomorrow. Guess I'm going to have to hand write it while I'm at that camp this weekend. Wonder how THAT'S gonna be. Quite frankly, sounds like the perfect opportunity to put on my wallflower suit. You know how I am around people I don't know. Or at least, Brian and my counselor do. According to them, I stay in the background, pretty quite, until I warm up to people, then I'll talk to them. In other words, I don't seek out conversation, I let it come to me. And, if and when it does, I'll try to be sociable. Hopefully, I can bring my guitar...or maybe not. don't want someone to mess with it when I'm not looking. Honestly, I dread the social-ness of this thing, I'll probably end up withdrawing and getting depressed. But that's the worst case scenario. I always predict the worst so that it can't get worse than what I expect, it can only get better. ack, got things to do, must....leave...now....

      You know, sometimes when I think about killing myself, I'd do it just to see what happens. I mean, it's a cure for my doubts. If I'm wrong about God, and I kill myself, I'll never know, because there's no afterlife. If I'm right, I'm going to heaven, and that doesn't sound like such a bad place. Beats being here.

      Okay, maybe I'm exaggerating a bit. I still feel like crap though. Had a joint counselling session with Brian. That was pretty interesting, and our counselor wants to do that more often. Then we went to see "Chronicles of Riddick", it was pretty good. Went out to dinner. Brian egged me on to ask out this waitress there, so I asked her if she had a boyfriend. She said yes. Later on as we were driving home, he said that he's gonna make me ask out a lot of girls, says that's the only way I'm going to get one. I told him the last thing I wanted to do was to end up like him. Out of the several girlfriends he's had, all but one ended in bad breakups. I don't want that. I don't want to waste my time on girls that aren't going to work out for me. I'd rather study a girl for a couple of months, just get to know her a bit, get a good judgement for what she's like, before I ask her out, so that I know what I'm going into, and I'll know the chances of it becoming a successful relationship. I mean, I don't deny that I enjoy the novelty of asking out a girl who I've never met before, like I did tonight; I might even do it again. But I don't want to fire blindly in the dark like Brian seems to do, hoping that I'll score one, kind of like buying lots of lotto tickets in hopes of winning with one. No, I prefer to pick my shots, to know what I'm aiming for, before I shoot. It's kinda like knowing what numbers to look for, just not knowing the order, and picking out those specific tickets with those numbers. Drat, I just got caught up in a conversation and forgot where I was going. Anyway, a quick addendum to the other night's thoughts on cynicism: when I'm cynical, I hate myself for feeling the other kind of depressed. I feel like I'm getting exactly what I deserve, that I really don't deserve anyone, or anything, from God. And I don't, really. For all my research, for all my ability to make a case for God, I still doubt. I still dirty myself, knowing it's wrong, yet not able to stop. Seems (to quote an old cliche) that my prayers bounce off the ceiling. Sometimes I think I hear God talking to me in my mind, like, thoughts just pop in my head, but I just think that is just my imagination. Once I thought I had a dream from God, an answer to prayer, since I had prayed for that very dream. But maybe it was just spawned from wishful thinking, and right now, I don't know what to think. Well, let me write down what I do know. There is a God. His Word to mankind is the Bible. I'm a Christian. That much I know, and am fairly certain and resolute in belief. What I don't know is the limits of God's patience with me. I don't deserve a single thing I ask for. I don't deserve to be loved. I DO deserve to be black-balled from society. After what I've done, I deserve a hell of a lot worse than I'm getting, and I can't help but wonder if that's going to happen, just not right now. It is beyond my realm of possibilities that God will answer my prayers. I don't deserve it, and to those who say that God is gracious, and doesn't give us what we deserve, you're only right part of the time. God has dealt out justice in the past, and I'm afraid He will do that to me. On a slightly more positive note, my mom told me that my counselor said that I should probably see a psychiatrist (that has to be the wrong spelling....) because I might have depression. And my mom's gonna let me go. Guess I was wrong. Glad I was wrong.

      You know, one of the reasons why I like "The Black Fleet Crisis" is because the author makes several observations on the machinery of politics and human behavior. One observation on humans is the fact that we are contradictory beings. In detail, the observation described how a character's different personality types, which were evidenced in his choices in decoration, would not be able to stand each other. How very true for all of us. I also confess to being such a creature. Even when I'm depressed, I contradict myself. Sometimes I'm the self-pitying type of depressed, others, I have a cynical depression, where I hate other people for their selfish self-absorbtion, their inherent shallowness. Though, I often wonder whether or not this cyniscism is not just a denial of pain that I really am feeling inside. Pain from being alone, from wanting to be accepted, understood, and yes, even loved, by those same people who I accuse of being shallow. An interesting thought. Your comments, please, if anyone reads this. Off of the ponderings front, I'm trying to decide if I want to start playing Utopia again....leaning for it at this moment. New age starts tomorrow, but I'll have to wait until next week because I'm leaving for the weekend for that forensics camp at Appalachian State.  Hope I can get with Jordan this week....maybe Wednesday after I see my counselor. Gotta show him that new song. Lunch time, gonna watch ROTK....again.

      hey, I use those little dots alot....anyway....(lol)....I went and saw Day After Tomorrow with my mom today. Acting is average, but the storyline and concept are excellent. Scary thing is, that could actually happen. Read a PopSci article on it. Found it rather depressing to have to go to the movies with my mom. Found myself wanting some actual companionship, and there was none to be had.  I'm determined not to rant and rave tonight about what I don't have. I did decide what I can use this for though. Gonna give it out to people that I want to know the real me, that I trust them with that knowledge...so, Luke, if you see this, you know why I gave  you the address. Let's see....Karlie, Courtney, Jessica, maybe Ashley....those are the only other people I can think of right now who I'm going to give this to. Gotta go e-mail a couple of those people right now, so I'm outta here.

      Internet's being crazy again. took me awhile to get to this site. I'm gonna eat lunch....get dressed first, then eat....de ja vu? anyway....it's really weird how I only get depressed at night....I've noticed that. I'm usually okay during the day, but at night, I'm just really bad off. Makes me wonder if I do have a medically treatable problem. Of course, there's no getting help with that anyway. My mom would want to know why I think there's something wrong with me, and then she would proceed to deny that there's anything wrong, that I'm making a big deal out of nothing. Of course, who am I to listen to what she says? she's in a constant state of denial about everything, because she's got her own problems. Which, of course, she won't acknowledge. My counselor doesn't know everything yet, may take him awhile to get the whole picture, you know how counselors are. When he does, not really sure if he'll acknowledge a problem or not, it's really hard for me to communicate everything I'm feeling. He might just blow it off, but I don't know. I gotta go eat, that's one thing I do know.

      We just got back from Branson...again. Saw the Cirque there. It was better than I was expecting. Of course, I've seen Cirque du Soleil, so it will never be "awesome". The only thing they did better than CDS's "Quidam" (the only one I've seen) is their German Wheel act, and their parallel of Aerial Hoops. I found their costumes and decoration and everything to be to bright, complicated, and overall, distracting. In the realm of music, they're nowhere close to Quidam. In Quidam, I was as much engaged by the music as the show itself. And let's not forget that girl that sang in Quidam. I doubt I will ever hear a singer that good ever again. Such a beautiful, clear voice. And she was only in her early teens, it appeared. Well, how I held up this time. I've cried myself to sleep the past two nights. I'm so pathetic, I know that's what you're thinking. What 17 yr old guy would cry? Well, I do. That's just me. I don't cry much, but when I'm feeling suicidal, I do, because I know that I'm too much of a coward to kill myself by any other means than by a gun, which I don't have. So I realize that there's nothing I can do to end my suffering, and that brings on such emotional suffering that you can't even begin to imagine if you haven't experienced it yourself. I just need to be around some people my age that'll talk to me. This trip has been hell on me because I've had no one to talk to. I'm going home tomorrow though, going bowling with my youth group on Sunday night, maybe that'll help. That's only a temporary salve though.....I need a permanent solution to my loneliness....just don't know if I'll ever find one.

      Shew.....Well, I've been here for four days. Vandalia, that is. We went to Branson on Saturday, visited Nancy on Sunday, came back yesterday, went to Springfield today so that Ross could have his operation. Everything went fine, we're all back here, just finished dinner. Me and my mom are going back to Branson tomorrow, and we're going to do some stuff with David and Esther. Of course, you're probably wondering how my mental state is holding up against this onslaught. Not so good. Less than 24 hours with this crew, and I was desperately wanting to add some good scars to my shoulder. I had gone from good to deep in a dark, depressed hole in a fairly short amount of time. The first night we were in Branson, we went and saw the Presley's Country Jubilee. Good show even though I don't like country music, because the comedians were awesome, and they had some of the younger kids of the family perform. They also had this 16 year old local girl sing (her name was Ambrus Leigh...odd name, don't ya think?), she was downright beautiful, and it's been a while since I heard someone sing that good. And, as you can guess, that didn't help my depression any. Found myself envying her talent. Got her autograph after the show, told her how awesomely talented she was, didn't tell her though that my complements are few and far between when it comes to music since I've heard some of the best singers in the world. My impression of her though is that it hasn't gone to her head, she seemed pretty genuine and humble. You know, the funny thing is, what I said to her are the only words I've spoken to someone that's even remotely close to my age. Seriously, I've had no social life here, no one to talk to besides the older folks. Makes me feel so terribly alone. I have no outlet for my depression save through music and writing, which I have been doing in earnest, but it's not enough. ooh, look, mom's back from Dairy Queen. Pardon me while I go stuff my face.

      Well, that's what I feel. nothing. I don't have much time, like, ten minutes before I have to leave. There are some days where I want to be depressed, because I see nothing to be happy about. I hate having neutral feelings. Today's just one of those days. I want to be....something, want to feel something, but I feel just empty. Visiting my grandparents in Illinois isn't going to help, but that's where we're going for a week and a half. True, I'm going to get to play golf in Branson, MO while I'm over there, but....there is NO ONE even close to my age that I'm going to see. For a week and a half, I'm stuck with people that are at the very least, 30yrs older than me. I went to the beach with them a few months ago, just one day was enough to get me really depressed. At least I won't be feelin nothing....aieeee, I've got to go already.

      Been a while, I know. My med's don't work, one thing I know for sure. a recap of what I've been doing? Went to the beach with the Szigedi's, got burned. Went to my dad's, drove there myself. Gotta work all weekend. Sucks. Hey, I made a poetry blog because I got sick of Poetry.com. Check it out. Well, more later, I promise. but for now, lunch.

      Decided not to ask her. yeah, I know some people are gonna be disappointed with me, but I realized that I shouldn't be doing what they want, in this case, it's about what I want. In other words, I should be doing it for me, not for them. She's not my type, end of discussion. It was remarkable how much easier it was to breathe once I made that decision. I can just move on. So what is my type, if not the girl I've liked for well over a year? Take note of something. The best relationships that I've seen, dating or marital, is where the couple are people who could just be friends with each other, even if there never was a relationship. Or, it could be said, that they relate like the best of friends, talk like the best of friends, but that there is something deeper between them: love. Let's go even further back. How does one describe a friendship? Well, I could say for you to look at me and any one of my good friends, but considering that the majority of you who read this don't even know me in person, much less have met my friends, that's not good enough. So, friends......friends are people with whom you are extremely comfortable. They are people for whom you do not have to put on a front, because they know you intimately, know most, if not all, of your secrets, your feelings, etc. They know your likes and dislikes. There's a lot more that I could say here. But I really don't need to. Do you remember how you met your best friend? Didn't it just sort of click between you two? That's a good sign in telling if someone might be your type.  So, it might follow logically like this: If I were to find a girl, we got along really well, and I liked her, that's a really good combination, and it suggests that that might be a good time to see if the interest is mutual. I mean, I'm not going to flat out ask that question, but at that point I'd ask her out. But that first part's the real trick: finding both in the same person. Because, if I think hard about that, there are few people who fit that bill....actually, none. Or, rather, there are some, but I don't have ask them to know that they won't go out with me. And it really has nothing to do with me. Either they're already hooked up with someone else, or they're just not interested in going out with anyone, period. A frustrating reality. But, new school year's coming, that means new people. so, we'll just have to see what these new people are like. you never know, this could be a good year for me..... Oh, yeah, before I forget, never try to sleep around overly sociable large dogs. Doesn't work, trust me.

      yeah, but it's almost five, and even though I'm not hungry now, I gotta eat once my mom gets back with dinner, then off to work....at least Ashley's back, that'll make things interesting.....wonder who's doing floors tonight, me or that new guy? hope tomorrow goes okay....funny thing is, I'm not sure I wanna go out with Sarah.....I mean, I'll still ask her out, but the more I think about it, the more she doesn't seem my type, you know? Course, I don't know her all that well in the first place but....

      yeah, I didn't make them all yesterday. I HATE talking on the phone....only exceptions are people who I know REALLY well, like Brian or my dad. Gotta go to school today....yeah, in July, I know. Have to take this Spanish test so that I can take the college spanish class this coming school year. Then I gotta get some CD-R's, and buy this book, "Cry, the Beloved Country"....never heard of it, but English teachers have a way of making us read the most boring books....with a couple exceptions, being, "Born Again" by Chuck Colson, and we didn't get to read this last one, it was the freshmen that had to read it, "This Present Darkness"...I just read that, AWESOME book. *sigh* gotta get dressed, eat lunch (de ja vu?), call John about being our drummer, call that woman about getting recorded, call Zack and Paige, see if they want to join in the fun on saturday....and pick up that program from Alex.....

      Funny thing about that is, I have to call people this week. Don't like calling people, particularly people I don't know. Anything else that's going on? hmm....so much to say. Gonna have that get-together on Saturday, need some more people to come, though. But that's nothing. Big thing that's going on? My mom found this site, read my blog. To make it short, my counselor is sending me to see a psychiatrist. what for? you guess. Thing is though, I don't want pills, a medically induced happiness, that's how I see it. Call me ignorant if you want to. Don't really care. I'd rather my problems be solved the way I want them to be solved. You know what I'm talking about. If I have to wait for it, well, damn, I'll just wait for it. Even if it never comes. But I don't want to take pills. Happiness isn't found in a bottle.

      Quote from the first Spiderman movie. Emphasis on the first three words, because that's how I've been feeling. Yesterday, I spent the whole day at Carowinds with my youth group. Puttered around there for a while, then the concert was at six. Thousand Foot Krutch, Relient K, Day of Fire (new band, they're not bad), and Audio Adrenaline. We left after that, got home around 1:30am. I cried on the bus coming back. No one noticed, not even the girl sitting next to me. I cried driving home. I cried sitting in my driveway. I cried when I went to bed. I was hurting so bad inside. I still feel that pain now. Now, can you read between the lines here? If not, I'll read it for you. Being in such a public place, watching all those people, that would be enough to get me depressed by itself. That was aggravated by the fact that the vast majority of the girls there were wearing bikini tops, I mean, heck, it's part water park, why wouldn't they be? And most guys would be thrilled to be there, for that very reason. So why not me? Haven't you noticed that I have rather ambiguous feelings when it comes to this subject? Okay, yeah, I admit that as a guy, I do like seeing these hot girls running around like they are. But, it is extremely depressing at the same time. The whole "you can look, but don't touch" and if you look you're still considered a perv. Correct me if I'm wrong, but girls don't like anyone but hot guys checkin' them out. And yet, as I understand, girls WANT their boyfriends to notice how beautiful they are, that's one of the reasons they spend a lot of time trying to look good. Oh, what a line that separates the two situations. An uncrossable line, for me, it seems. Seems to me, there will never be a girl that wants ME to give her that kind of attention.  *sigh* It's not like I'm asking for the Statue of Liberty to be put in my front yard. Lots of people have what I want....is it too much to want something like what they have? Is it really all that much? Or am I breaking the status quo, rising above my place in society? Am I not supposed to get what I want, this one thing, just because certain elements of society say I'm not good enough? Brittany told me to just stop caring about it, said when she stopped caring about guys, that's when they started asking her out. Sorry to say that I can't. Honestly and truly, that's the face I put on in public, that I have no problems, that I'm not concerned about that. All of what I post on this site, that's private. I only share this with people I trust. I am who I am. I don't want to put on a front, pretend to be someone I'm not. I don't respect people who do that, and so I wouldn't be able to respect myself. So depression's one of my quirks. I'm not always depressed. Most of the time, I'm not. I'm a very humorous person, most of the time. And it's not hard to get me out of a depressed mood. I'm not going to change myself. This is who I am. Accept that. There are people out there who could love someone like me, it's just a question of whether or not I will ever find them, and if I could love them. oh, wow. it's the song that made me cry so hard. the lyrics are so powerful, so true. I'm listening to it right now. "A Shadow On Me" by Project 86. The chorus goes something like this: "Can you see a shadow on me, calling me to leave? Find in me a trace of you in all this tragedy." The last part, they sing something else: "Can you see the shadow lifting, drifting home again?" I wish so bad that someone could chase away the shadow covering me. The darkness in my life is so thick, I'm scared that no light could ever get through. I know of one that can, but I despair of finding it. Do you know? Love.

      I'm talking to Audrey again. learning more and more. She agrees with me, with what I said last time. talking about trust this time, I will not forget to save it. she said she trust me. One of the few people outside her family. I'm glad she does. If anyone reads this, please, pray for her. I want her to be able to live life without having to hide her heart behind an armor shell. I want her to know what being loved, and loving, is like, to know what it's like to be surrounded by friends that you trust completely. I was once like her, before Sept. 2003. Now, I know what all that is like, and I would NEVER go back. I want her to be able to see what life is like beyond the armor. I think I know now why she's not interested in getting into any relationships with guys....probably doesn't trust them, because her dad has broken so many promises. I hope she gets past that, and learns what it's like to have that love. heck, I wanna know what that love is like. DAMN!!!!! forgot to save it! it's a conspiracy! I guess my posts on here will have to serve as my notes on the conversations. I need to get Jen in on this....she's our only close mutual female friend. gotta get that perspective. You know, when I'm helping people, I feel better. I don't have to focus on my own problems. It was that way at the forensics camp. I was talking to Stephani about her probs with her boyfriend (now ex), and that was one of the few times when I was completely free of my depression. I'm going bowling tomorrow, hope I did as good as I did last week. 176, 189, 182, that's last week's scores. then I'm going pawnshopping with Jordan. Hopefully there's some good deals out there.

      Had to work Friday, Saturday, and Sunday nights. Busy. Particularly last night, being the Fourth. Heck, I'm doin okay right now. Reading "This Present Darkness" by Frank Peretti, really good book. Aiee, gotta get dressed, eat lunch, I just spent fifteen minutes on hold on the phone trying to get a hold of Jessica to see if she could work for me, but she can't so I'm gonna have to take Shannon up on his offer, wish I didn't have to, he's only a trainee, but he said he would if I couldn't find anyone else, and since three other people are out of town this week, it was only him and Jessica that could possibly cover for me. Food time, I'm shutting up now.

      I know I shouldn't be on this late, but I'm worried about Audrey. she's going through alot, she opened up and talked to me. She talked about how she always worries about her dad, stays up half the night wondering if he's alive. Then she says that she's heartless, doesn't care about people, says they can all go to hell for all she cares, save for a few family exceptions. It seems she doesn't want to be that way though. That's why she wants to be a nun. She thinks that's the only way she'll be able to learn to care about others. I feel so bad for her. I know from experience that learning to care cannot be gained through any sort of career or anything external, really. It is an internal choice. I told her that, I hope she does think about it. I'll try to talk to her more. however (damn it), I forgot to save the conversation on MSN. oh well. she makes sense to me now, at least. I understand why she is the way she is. she doesn't appear to have an emotional side because she buries it. Not a good thing. I pray to God that I'll be able to help her like Josh I. helped me. He's the one who taught me to give people a chance, to talk to them, to CARE about others. he may not realize it, but he did.  I gotta go to bed, it's so late...almost 1am.  Oh, and on a side note, that pic was taken where we were staying near Branson.

      can't come up with a more creative title. med's aren't doing too good today. it's just the need for that kind of companionship, you know? As creative a writer I am, there is no satisfactory description I could write that would express that pain, that empty loneliness. oh, hey, it's that song again.....and the shadow is still here. I cannot forsee it lifting, ever. My whole life has been, apparently, about preserving the status quo. Something I picked up from my mom, no doubt. Well, let me say emphatically, the status quo SUCKS. I've made a lot of changes in my life this past year, but it's apparently not enough. Despite my efforts, I'm still alone, still ignored. funny that Jordan feels the same way. And he's got a lot more going for him than I do. He's extremely intelligent, talented athlete, a lot of girls like him, just not the right ones. Makes me feel like my whole life has been one huge experiment in futility. I know some would say it's not, that I do have a purpose, but you know humans: a lot of hindsight, practically no foresight. man, I'm hungry....be right back. k, got that taken care of. you know what I really need? a blind date, seriously. someone needs to set me up. maybe jennifer would.....I know brian's been looking for a while, but no luck. I know it doesn't have very good odds to back it up, but.....hey, it'll be an experience either way. I got nothin left to say, I'm outta here.

      yeah, this was the first day of school. Our principal's house got TP'd last night, they caught it on film. Got back from that camp this weekend. it wasn't bad, scenery was nice. my butt still hurts from the Hummer ride. Landed on Jordan's knee. We were going downhill, hit a three-foot mogul, I went up and he slid under me, and when I came down, well, you get the idea. The increased med's are giving me mood swings. Seriously, Saturday night, in less than ten seconds I went from laughing, joking around to crying. It was like that the whole weekend. Also, it's making me hyper, I can't stand that. if it gets worse when he increases the dosage, I'm gonna stop taking it. it's just not worth it if it's gonna make me like that. I cashed my change bag, I had about $80 in there. I needed the money, trust me. I wrote a new song, it's on my poetry blog. Check it out. oh, yeah, and in a couple of more paychecks, I should be able to afford an electric guitar, maybe even an amp.

      yes, it does, and in more ways than one. I've got four hours max before i have to leave to get to my church on time for that camp thing we're going to, back-to-school retreat or whatever. Not sure what to expect. it's somewhere in the SC mountains, and i'll be gone all weekend. I still have to pack and go to Walmart to get a couple of notebooks for school, which starts Monday. Oi. Really depressing night last night. Can't say too much, my mom will probably read this. that sucks, I'm no longer free to write anything I want. damn. that REALLY sucks. Anyway, still got some stuff to do, gotta go.

      As in, last week before school starts. really bites. I went and registered yesterday. finally have a top locker. But what's really weird is my schedule. Listen to this. Before 1st period, I have band. 1st period is the college math class, then I have the college spanish class, then AP Calculus, then Honors English, then Bible, then the college english class, then chorus. So, two math classes and two english classes. I don't mind the math so much as I do the english. My psychiatrist increased my meds. The way he was talking, it sounded like he knew that what he had me on wasn't going to be enough, that it was just a trial run to test for side effects. Wish he'd have told me that instead of acting like I really didn't have a problem. Hey, I'm sitting here peeling skin off my shoulder. As if I didn't have anything better to do. Which I do. I have to write up a flyer for the spaghetti dinner fundraiser for my mission trip. Then, I have to go distribute these. what fun. I hate talking to strangers. Especially because it's awkward to go into a place of business, and tell them you're not looking to buy anything, but to sell them something. then there's the problem of collecting the money. Since I'm doing this by flyer, it will be a little trickier. I'll just have to manage.
