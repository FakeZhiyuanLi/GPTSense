         Wut's up people, I'm writin for my second entry. Nicole called but she is sick so I'm sad. But at least she called me to let me know. I'm really feelin her and I miss talkin to her. I'm hopin she's not ugly. Okay, this is the deal--I saw her but it was in the dark and I was up close to her but i didnt look at her directly but I really don't think she is ugly..well I'm hopin. And I know it's not all about looks but I just hope she has some looks cuz I'm gonna have to look at her. But neway, my fried Marie came over today and we chilled. She is one of my best friends. We always have stuff to talk about. We walked to this dude named Demetrius' house. He lives in the neighborhood beside mine. He is my other best friend (and also has something going on with Marie:)uh-oh). So we walk down there and come back in the dark. We got back and talked to Demetrius on the phone and watched tv. OH!! While me and Marie were walkin, Nicole (that girl i met@ the club)--her friend called and said she wouldnt be able to talk cuz she was still sick, so I called Nicole later and expressed to her that I was sorry we wouldnt be able to talk and that I hoped she would get better soon. She had lost her voice about 2 nights ago and it was still gone. So I'm hopin for the best. We are going to mail each other pictures of ourselves. She thought of it first (another reason I dont think she's ugly). But she's too good to be true.... So now I have to go take some pictures and make sure I'm lookin nice in them. Huh, Demetrius will not sing for nething. We're best friends!! I dont know why he wont just sing. He doesnt sound bad. I wish he would stop bein a punk and stop bein so nervous. He shouldnt feel nervous or scared around me. But whatever, I guess it comes with time. He'll start to feel more comfortable around me sooner or later. I have to go to my camps in 3 more days. I hope I have good roomates. Hugh...please Lord let me have good roomates. Well I know this wasn't as interesting as before but you'll be alright.  Keep the peace, LaRon

       Man, I never thought I would be so bored that I would start a "blog". I've heard about it but then I went to my friends profile and decided to make one of my own. Let me see here...today I woke up and watched "Judging Amy" on ch.23.  I did some more boring stuff and then I called this girl that I am talking to. She's real cool. I met her at Banana Joes (club opened for teens on teen night) on Sunday and called her on Monday at like 11 somethin. We talked till about 2 o'clock in the morning. We had a lot to talk about. Her personality is on point and she has her head on her shoulders. Dang, it's nice to find somebody like that. But neway, I called her today and she had lost her voice. We talked then she said she would call me back cuz her godmother was on the other line. Havent heard from her yet but hopefullly i will. Oh, let me tell you the story about my club experience at BJ's! Okay so me and that girl (I'll call her...Nicole); so me and Nicole are dancin and we had been dancin for the longest time, it was goin on 30min. So we're dancin and this dude comes up beside me and puts his hand on her back WHILE WE'RE DANCIN! so you know, i thought he was just tryin to get by so i didnt say nething, but why is his hand still there 45 seconds later. So i tried to kinda hint to him to move his hand so i put my elbow up to move his hand. Nicole was lettin me know she didnt wanna dance with him cuz she was grabbin on to my arms and stuff. So okay after i did the elbow thing, HIS HAND IS STILL THERE so i was like "eh man, we aint gone be finished no time soon" (bad grammar-i know). He asked me if that was my girl and I told him yeah, which was a lie but that was the only way i would get him to leave us alone. So we were dancin and dancin and everybody was crowded around us. Dudes kept askin if that was my girl and I kept tellin them yeah. We danced for a straight HOUR.We sweated so much. We were drippin in sweat. I cant wait till the next time i go. It'll have to wait 3 more weeks cuz I'm goin to some camps, Carolina Journalism Institue and I'm going to a camp at Clemson for the SATs. The Clemson camp is for 2wks but we get to chill out and have fun over the weekend so I'll be alright. But um..I have to go pee and I've already written so much so I will just write again tomorrow.  Keep the peace, LaRon
