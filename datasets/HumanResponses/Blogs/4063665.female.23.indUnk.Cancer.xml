       So before I head off for a weekend of doing who knows what, I feel compelled to write a post on relationships and break-ups and the strange things that can ensue.      Tonight is my friend's birthday party but I happened to meet her through my ex boyfriend. I want to go but I don't want to be surrounded by his friends and chance him being there because as of late, he has been mean to me and constantly insists that I am a skank because I'm dating someone else. It hurts me because while I like to tell myself I'm over him, I'm not and having him be mean to me is hard. I just want to wish my friend a happy birthday and be done with the matter.        He most likely won't come but if he should come, I don't know what I will do. And, if he should come and bring his old hag of a girlfriend (she's 30), I don't want to be around him. I've tried to be nice but he just continues to be mean. And, I always end up feeling sad afterwards because he's not my boyfriend anymore : ( On the e-vite thing he's indicated that he is not coming. Can I trust in this? Can his decline on an e-vite be rock-solid truth that he's not going to come? I just don't know... Sigh.      All of this is just stupid and lame.  On a happy note, I would at least get to dress up!

       My friend Shaina has joined the peace corps and is leaving soonish for two whole years :( I tried linking her travel journal... don't know if it worked or not.      Favorite memories with Shaina:   - Playing Mario Kart with random outbursts of obscenities   - Getting busted by public safety   - Having a "magical" day at the beach after getting lost in Golden Gate park when the "magic" started taking effect   - Deuces and frustration   - "Fuck this Bureacracy Bullshit!"   - Watching scary movies (The Shining, The Others, The Exorcist, The Changeling... lots of "the" movies)   - Kurt and Zack's "Keg" party where she insisted that she wasn't drunk, tried to break up a fight, tried puking into a cup, then passed out in my bed   - Putting glitter all over our eyelids... oh wait, that was me   - 420, any time, all the time      the list goes on. I can't wait until she comes back! But i'll probably be old and bent by then :(

       TGIF! That being said, the focus of my post this morning is today's morning commute. For me, commuting really bites. There's the traffic and crazy driving to get to the BART station, then there's the rush to get onto the train and nab a seat that's not too dirty, then the scuffle to get off the train and up the stairs into the freezing San Francisco morning air. Once I emerge topside, I have a 10 block walk from Market Street to Pacific where I have to weave inbetween fellow walkers, homless people, bike messengers and all those other people that walk but tote around one of those big wheely bags to carry all their junk. Needless to say my commute often puts me in a rather crappy mood when the day has only just begun.    &nbsp;  Today, however, it was actually funny. Why you ask? Because after the annoying drive, I got onto the BART train and sat down by myself only to be joined by a woman with a head full of&nbsp;Jerry Curl. Yes, folks, that's right, Jerry Curl. I tried not to laugh because it's rude to laugh at strangers but she looked like she belonged in some bad 80's movie because not only did she have a greasy, Jerry Curled head, she was wearing one of those crinkly track suits that were all the rage in the 80's. Oh it was hilarious. Then, as if things couldn't be any more amusing, she told me (a complete stranger) that&nbsp;she had heart burn and proceeded to drink Mylanta straight from the bottle. Yes, she chugged Mylanta from the sea green bottle. Then, when&nbsp;I thought&nbsp;my interaction with Ms. Jerry Curl couldn't get any funnier, the BART train operator accidentally announced that our train was a "Daly City Train" when it was in fact a "Dublin Pleasonton Train". At this small mistake the&nbsp;Jerry Curl lady had to announce to the train car "Uh-uh, this is a&nbsp;Dublin Pleaston train. He don't know what he&nbsp;be talkin" (yes, she actually said that). Most people kept to their papers. I coughed so as to not laugh in her face.&nbsp;Alas, the BART train arrived at Montogomery and I got off, leaving the Jerry Curl lady and her Mylanta to their own devices.    &nbsp;  The fun doesn't end there though. I came up the stairs from the platform, went through the little gate when I was accosted by some teenage looking girl in a blue shirt with strange letters on it. She handed me a yellow flyer that said "Have a good day" on the front. I took it, thinking that it would at least be an amusing read. Oh, I had no idea just how funny it would turn out to be. It was a pamphlet for the "Jews for Jesus" organization complete with Yiddish sayings and little drawings. It&nbsp;filled me in on all the nice things that Jesus wants for me&nbsp;and that I can have a nicer day because&nbsp;Jesus cares about me. I was touched. I thought, wow, all I need to know in life is that I can have a nicer day because Jesus&nbsp;cares. Good thing he does because so far my day has been hilarious! &nbsp;

       In the words of the Dead Kennedy's, "Take this job and shove it! I ain't workin' here no more!".     &nbsp;  I had planned on having a nice productive day, not hectic but not slow, to get all my things done. I was even thinking that I would even have free time to send my resume out on company time (and get paid to look for another job!) but no. No no no. I get to work and everyone needs me to help them with their client work and they all insist that their client work takes priority to other client work and my own work. Never mind the fact that as a result, there will be no groceries next week, never mind the fact that the new hires' business cards will be delayed, that billing and invoicing will be held up. Oh no, it's SO IMPORTANT that the stupid client database be updated when the dumb girl creating it in the first place put the same person in our database multiple times.      &nbsp;  As a result of my frustration and what will inevitably be a few more gray hairs, I think i'm going to order lunch and expense it. Not only will I work through lunch and make over time, I'm going to get a free lunch too!    &nbsp;  In other news, my romance life is&nbsp;depressing because I've gotten myself boxed into a situation where action in either direction makes me unhappy. So I like this guy but I had to be an idiot and tell him that I wasn't looking for anything serious and that there was no pressure. Now I want&nbsp;to&nbsp;be his girlfriend, I want him to call me more but I can't ask him that because I said that I wouldn't.&nbsp;Will anything ever turn out good? I hope so&nbsp;

       So I have been sitting here for about five minutes trying to decide what to actually write on this darn thing. I was thinking that I should have a theme to tie my writings all together but I couldn't decide what theme to go with. I used to keep a few "articles" that I wrote titled "Working Girl; My Disillusionment With The Workplace" and I even had a few really good postings about how the crappiness of my&nbsp; job entitled me to take all the office supplies that I wanted. However, I can't find the disk where I saved the really good writings so I gave up on that idea. Next I thought I would visit some sites of other bloggers to see what they wrote about.&nbsp;A few were centered around politics or technology and the others just weren't in English so I really don't know what they were writing about. So in the end I've decided to just espouse my opinions on random things in hopes that you (my readers) find them as funny as I do. That being said, the subject of today's posting is on how much I love my sister (yes, pathetic and sappy I know).    &nbsp;  I didn't always love my sister, in fact, as a child I made her eat my ear wax. But, as we got older we got much closer and there is no one in the world like her. We relate on a whole other plane where we don't even need to speak in logical sentences. For example, last night I was sitting in the family room watching a movie and I decided to text my sister to tell her to come watch the movie with me.    She wrote back, "Shut up please, i'm very busy and important!"    I replied "You take delight in vexing me! You have no compassion on my poor nerves!"   This instigated a response of "No lace! I beg of you madam, no lace!"    This all seems very nonsensical but it actually made perfect sense to me. We can have conversations without really having conversations which, is why I love my sister. Plus, I like that I can call her "poo poo platter" and tease her about the time she was little and how the ear pearcing lady said, "Oh how cute! You're going to pierce HIS ears!"    I'm tired of writing about this because she's on AIM and I'd rather trade witty banter with her in person.

         In the beginning there was a kitty in her 20's trying to figure out what the heck she was going to do with her life. She had just graduated college and couldn't find a job. Somehow she ended up in the corporate working world even though her whole kitty life, she wanted to be a writer. Then one day she learned about these things called "blogs" (yes, this kitty was a bit behind the times, she still has a turntable and if you have a working 8-track, she'd be interested in buying it). She decided to start a blog and "publish" her thoughts and such a-la Carrie Bradshaw from Sex in the City. So there you have it.    One of my professors in college told me that I was a great writer because you could "hear my voice" in my writing. I always disagreed. We'll see. Please feel free to post comments on anything and let me know what you think of my writing.   Upcoming Attractions: A column actually about something! Oh the suspense!

       So all attempts at literary greatness are out the window right now. I'm hung over and I feel like shit and yet, I feel compelled to post so this is what you get. Last night I went to see my favorite bands, Stars and Bars and Trainwreck Riders. Both bands played really well and I had a good time. Either I was really drunk or they were really drunk but I feel like Trainwreck played especially well and the whole time I was dancing with my friends. I had brought my little sister with me and my friends were sisters and we discovered that we were standing next to another set of three sisters. It was rather strange because there were another set of sisters milling about and it just seemed like there were so many people who were related at this show. It was fun though because I guess we sisters up in front dancing were drunk enough to get a big kick out of our "sisterly discovery". Out of all the sets of sisters, my little sister was probably the oldest seeming though she was definitely the youngest. She was responsible and got me home safe while I blathered about and drunkenly sashayed around the bar. Good thing for little sisters.      Today I have a headache and I'm grumpy. I didn't sleep enough. Tonight I am meeting friends from college for dinner. I wanted to drink with them as well but I think it's best if I leave alcohol out of my life for a while.

       So I don't have anything to write about but I wanted to post something anyway because I am at work and I'm bored beyond rescue. So, I looked up some lyrics from a favorite of mine and got the song stuck in my head so I'm just going to post them here:      Andre Nickatina - Classified    When I met you baby, you was for sale   I just stepped out of the county jail   For a punk ass misdemeanor   My P.O. dont like Nickatina   And an old man was lettin' ya go   And I could see I was what you was looking for    He said bring me a G, then next week a G   I said "Check this out pops I'm back tomorrow at 3"   Dont worry how I got that GJust worry I was right back there at 3   Started you up, and it was legit   I never thought I'd fall in love so quick   Filled you up with gasoline   Took you to the wash spot and got ya clean   Cleaned the dash, rubbed that ass   And everything was slow, I didnt do it fast   Man it took about an hours time   But you looked so fine from the waxy shine   And on my mind I thought about the Alpines   So I loaded your behind with some 6 x 9's   So when you sing people hear you sang   I'm a nigga so baby I'm a do these thangs   Pioneers blastin' out Aretha Franklin   Sometimes I'm wonderin' what you thankin'      My ride (my ride), my ride (my ride)   You dont fake, steal, cheat, or lie   My ride (my ride), my ride (my ride)   And our relationship is classified      I'm going to stop there... I wish I had a fancy, fun car like a 71 Chevelle (red with white racing stripes!) to cruise around in, bumping this song... of course I'd need me some 6 x 9's too...

       I was just perusing my blog and I realized that I seem to keep writing longer and longer posts without any literary merit to them. I'm just a big, pink bag of wind : ( So, without further ado, I fully intend to post a succinct post with more philosophical meaning... I just have yet to pick a topic. And, I promise that this upcoming post will be well written, laden with expressive discourse and the Pink Kitty's literary voice ; )      p.s. I feel like Bridget Jones (You must see "Bridget Jones' Diary to understand!) because I feel as if my "whole life's' future happiness now depends on this one night".... I plan to "circulate, oozing intelligence" and I plan to "introduce people with thoughtful details" but I am so worried that I am placing too much importance on this one night when I know that I will very most likely be let down.  I thought angst was something only teenagers have, not twenty-something young women ...

       Well it would appear that I am at a point of major decision in my life. I am trying to decide a course of action that will affect my life dramatically because I must choose between completing my MBA or moving out of the house. My parent's will not help me with both, I must choose one or the other and this decision will affect the rest of my life. Here are my thoughts on both subjects, with the one I am leaning towards coming first:    - Moving out: I have been living at home since March and I have not saved any money as I intended to do. I attribute this flaw in my plan to the fact that I spend a large amount of money on commuting to and from work. And, I have to dole out $115 every month for a storage unit that mostly houses my mattress because my step dad has commandeered the storage available at our house. Also, living at home has affected a sort of lazy demeanor in my person so that I don't help out around the house anymore, I don't make my lunch and I don't plan my day's accordingly. I've gotten used to being taken care of and I think it's a negative for my character. I went and saw a place last night and I got a really great vive from the house. It seems like a nice place to live and the people that I met seem friendly and genuine and real. Plus, my kitty would be kindly welcomed into the home. However, the room that I would be renting is expensive for me ($610/month) and it's rather on the small side. The house has lots of extra storage and a pool table in the basement but I still don't like the idea of such a small room for the price requested (even though the closet is EXCELLENT!). I'm looking for other rooms for rent but my OCD when it comes to cleanliness hinders my ability to live with just anyone as does my deep attachment with my kitty. I loathe to part with her and therefore, I must find a place that will house us both and as I search, I'm finding that the price range is about the same and the rooms and closets are smaller than the current house that I have found. Alas, the hardest part of making this decision is that it will be very tough financially and I will not be attending school which, I don't care about but I feel like a failure for not going.      -MBA: the other option is to stay at home, have no life at all and just work and go to school and save money. This seems like the smartest choice because my parents would be willing to pay for me to go to school and for books but I would have to forgo any enjoyment and any outings because I'd be stuck at home, saving money. I have no friends in my current town and no one from the city would ever journey south to visit me because I live with my tyrannical parents. I know that if I were of tougher moral fiber I could just suffer and sacrifice so that I can go to a school that I hate to get my MBA and be done with the matter. Unfortunately my displeasure with the place that I go to school and my attitude towards school at the moment is so severe that I really don't want to go anymore. I've made myself physically sick because I hate going that much. I'm drastically younger than most of my classmates and even the younger ones were smart enough to take a year off after graduating college. I did not and I went straight to school so I find that I'm just burnt out. Lastly, I really do want to get my MBA and I honestly feel that if I were to take a year off, or even just a semester off, I would be happier and more positive towards the thought of going to school so that I would go to class more regularly and I would do better in class.       The main thing that is holding me back in making my choice is that I know that something could happen and I might not get my chance to get my MBA later. Also, I'm afraid that I would be constantly living paycheck to paycheck if I move out. And lastly, I'm worried that in today's recovering economy, the only thing making me stand out amongst all the other folks who need jobs is the fact that I'm working on my MBA and that I'm still a student seeking something more than a BS because it's become apparent that going to college just isn't enough anymore. I think the biggest underlying emotions that I can't seem to overcome are that I am scared to take this step (in either direction) and I feel that if I do not choose school, my parents and my peers (as well as myself) will see me as a failure and take my choice to be synonomous with failing. Also, I know that while my mother has not said it, she will liken me to my father who "gives up on everything" and "acts for instant gratification". I don't ever want to be like my dad because I have no respect for him and I need to believe that I am a better person.     What should I do?

       Whilst reading back on my posting history I realized that I forgot to mention a very important development in my life. On Friday, I saw my ex at the bar where the bands were playing (see my post from Monday). It was strange and at one point, I dissolved into tears and just let the music and my sadness take me. After the music stopped, he and I went and sat down and talked for a while. I cried a little bit but in the course of our conversation, I realized just how OVER HIM I am! This is a fabulous realization! I honestly feel like I have cried my final tears for him! I don't know what it was that changed but I just felt that he would no longer be able to affect my life! I think it was mainly the things he said, for example, that he tells his new girlfriend that he loves her when he does not in fact love her and instead, loves me. I thought to myself, do I really want to ever be with someone who would do that? And, not to mention the alacrity with which he found himself a new strumpet to profess love too! I can't deny that I'm sure somewhere in the future he will be entirely capable of making me cry again because he is a jerk but I'm happy to know that I feel over him and can now love him as a friend would. I sincerely do wish him the very best of luck in his life and I hope he finds what it is that he's looking for.      And, another important update is the fact that the new guy I was dating seems to have been abducted by aliens. He should have returned from his "12th Annual Big Science Thing" (thank you Simpsons!) by now and he still has yet to call me or e-mail me or something. I feel that his lack of contact with me over the past 11 days clearly demonstrates to me that I am not a pertinent part of his life and therefore, do not deserve any such attention or condescension (lol, I sound like Lady Catherine de Bourgh!). Quite frankly I don't give a rat's ass about him now. His lack of communication with yours truly has driven me beyond the point of annoyance. A girl needs to know she is special and he failed miserably at making me feel special. He was doing alright before this journey into reticence but now I am far too vexed to move forward with this.      Lastly, something happened this past weekend (in addition to finally really getting over my ex) that has got me feeling so happy. I am literally floating on cloud 9 and have been since the night that it happened. I can't say anymore because due to the event's clandestine nature but I am so happy!       I get my hair done on Thursday which also has me feeling excessively happy and jubilant!

       I went to the bank today to apply for a loan for school and to move out. Unfortunately I was turned down because of these three following factors: 1) Not enough lines of credit 2) Opening a recent credit line 3) too much owed. It kind of pisses me off because the only thing that's really my fault is #3.      1) Not enough lines of credit: I have been warned of having credit cards at my age and as I know first hand, the temptation to spend is beyond control at some points. Therefore, I have always restricted myself to my debit card because I only spent the money that I actually had. And, to prove my tendency for trouble, when I recieved my AMEX through work, I spent too much and had to fix that problem. As it is now, I only use it for things that I can later on expense and pay off. I hate AMEX...      2) I didn't open a recent line of credit, Target just "upgraded me" to a Target Visa at no request of my own. When I called the # for customer service they told me that I had just activated my card and that my old Target card was no longer active. While I appreciate Targets' faith in me that I am responsible and mature enough person to have a Target Visa card, I did not want this and now I'm stuck. Lucky for me I don't use it.      3) Of course I owe too much. On my credit report I owe 17,000 in Student Loans. However, I guess what the credit report fails to report is that they are deferred until the completion of my schooling. Perhaps I can maintain full-time student status for the rest of my life and never pay them back? At any rate, it looks like I owe a ton of money but it's really student loans that I will inevitably be paying for, for the rest of my life so why not just add to my life-long debt?      I'm upset because now I have to bring my parents into getting me money for school. What also upsetting about having to do this is that I will have to reveal that while I badgered my sister to fill out a FAFSA, I failed to do so for myself and am therefore inelligble for stafford loans etc. Which means, I will probably have to convince my poor mother to take out a loan against the house for me which not only makes me feel bad but makes my mother my creditor and that's just annoying. Hopefully all will work out in the end... maybe I should start playing lotto!

       I had one of those weekends that were entirely too short in duration because it was full of fun stuff and good times. Friday night my friends' bands' (yes, there are five people that I came to see making up two different bands) were playing at Edinburgh Castle. I showed up just in time to catch Stars and Bars. They were great and they played really well. I love watching their drummer because he makes the most hilarious face while drumming. Next some other band played, I didn't know who they were so I didn't stay. After they finished, Trainwreck Riders played and I just absolutely adore them. I wish that I could take them everywhere with me and when whim strikes me say "play me a song!" and they would start playing. They were great and people were dancing. After they finished, the 2 G's came on and played really well too. Then I went home drunk and part deaf. Good times      Saturday was more relaxing, I had a hang over and didn't feel like doing much anyway. I went to my friend's house and BBQ'ed with my sister and her sister. We also sat by the pool and relaxed. It was nice out in the east bay.      Sunday I went swimming in the AM, cleaned the house after I got back. Then my mom, my sister and I went shopping for a few last minute items for our impending trip to Kaua'i. After shopping, I made myself some dinner. I then got all dolled up and went out to a bar for the night with some friends. it was excellent conversation and a great time! I had a fabulous night and even though I'm hung over and grouchy and feel gross, I'm still happy! Hooray!

       I have completed my book,  Youth in Revolt . I voraciously devoured that book. I laughed, I cried (well not really), I cringed and I sighed. I loved the events that transpired for Nick Twisp. I think anyone who reads my pathetic literary endeavor on this blog should go and pick up this book (you could borrow my copy) and read it (however, do not compare my feeble attempts at great prose with those of author C.D. Payne. I fear I am of no literary talent). I am almost certain that you will find it as wonderful as I do.      I have just found out that tonight three of my favorite bands are playing at Edinburgh Castle on.. well I'm not quite sure what street it's on but I do know that around the corner there is a scary half-way house with transient youths meandering about. At any rate, I'm so excited to see them! What a week, a baseball game, a house party that got busted up by the cops, free lunch and drinks after work and now, seeing my favorites again! Life is good. I'm guessing that the only flaw in my otherwise perfect, ebullient night is that my ex will be there. Of course I plan to look alluring and sensuous in hopes that he feels angry with himself for setting me free. And of course, just in case his 30-something girlfriend is there, I hope she will pale in comparison to my lovely self. Why go through the trouble? Because unfortunately for my poor heart, I still love him. By making myself feel more desirable to him and to his friends and other men, I hope that he wants me back and that the aforementioned friends notify him that he was crazy to have let me go (emotional problems aside, they, in my perfect world, are basing their thoughts on pure physical attraction). Some have already told me that I am "way cuter" than the aforementioned 30-something girlfriend and another has told me that I shouldn't worry about my ex as I am a "beautiful young woman" (said he, slightly intoxicated and attempting to peer down my shirt. guys are funny). Well, thus ends my post. I fear that my attempt to integrate "big words" into my daily postings have made my writing sound pretentious and I feel that I have lost most of "my voice". Should I side with my strong literary voice or impressive diction?   Please leave a comment as to which you prefer, scholarly posts with philosophical undertones or my insipid whining, thick with the pink kitty's literary voice?

       urlLink  http://www.summitpacificinc.com/hanalei_bay_resort.html       If my mum is to be believed, that is where I am vacationing  starting next weekend. I leave on Saturday and return the following Sunday. I can't wait! My goals for my vacation are:    - spend a day on the beach doing nothing but swimming and relaxing   - hike this trail I read about in the Kaua'i visitors website. it takes you into this canyon where there is a little lake you can swim in.   - learn to surf   - visit waterfalls   - learn to surf    - meet locals at the bars at night in hopes of getting free drinks and maybe even some Hawaiian Pakalolo! (spelling?) (I'm devising strategies for smuggling a quarter over the pacific to my vacation residence)   - snorkel   - suntan   - read   and so there you have it. (and yes, I know learning to surf is on there twice. It's because I really really want to learn to surf!)      Also, moving forward I've decided that I'm going to make a real literary effort on my posts so that they are more intellectual and engaging. Instead of reading my insipid whining regarding my work, my ex-boyfriend, my new guy that I'm dating or my stupidity, you will now find posts on deep, philosophical matters. And, I'm going to try and be more dilligent in using the large words in my vocabulary instead of everday vernacular. Of course, this effort has been spurned on by my book, "Youth in Revolt". For a 14 year old boy, Nick Twisp posses quite a mastery over the english language and I can only hope to be like him and his beloved Sheeni in my language abilities. ; )

       A friend just asked me what my taste in men was like. Here is my response (and this is in addition to the usual range of qualities like a sense of humor, a good laugh, kind, trustworthy, honest etc. I also like a dash of nerdiness/geekiness in guys but thats just me... but I digress, on with the hunks!):      Orlando Bloom - Can I be his sassy pirate lass?  urlLink http://www.theorlandobloomfiles.com/pictures/movie/pirates/pressdvd20.jpg    Johnny Depp - I would gladly have him as my Captain.   Russel Crowe: burly and manly like.... need I say more?   George Clooney: sexy, gray haired manly man (and Dr. Ross!)   David Duchovny: Why don't you love me? I love him in  Dont Tell Mom the Babysitter's Dead .. he plays a great sleaze   Orlando Bloom: He's just so damn hot he has to be on here twice      and in terms of normal guys, here's a hottie for ya:  urlLink http://www.allbetsoff.org/flicks/flicks14.jpg     ; ) (

       Last night was a very fun night of sports, drinking, music and drinking. It all began with tickets to the Giants game. I rushed out of work early (yessss! I got to leave early) so that I could catch BART to my car, drive home and get the tickets and then drive back. When I got home I nabbed the tickets, threw on some jeans and gathered some warm clothes and then I hit the road again. Life was good, there wasn't very much traffic and the sun was (well, at least until I got to Daly City). I met my friend Ryan at his house and we piled into my car (Since his wouldn't start) and drove over to the bank and then to SBC Park. We parked in some sketch lot because it was free parking, walked a few blocks to the game, bought some peanuts and we went to enter the gate. Ryan had tried to sneak 6 beers in but when the lady relentlessly searched his bag she found them and confiscated them. I guess you have to give us credit. We then purchased two beers from some grossly over-priced beer vendor and weaved through the crowd to our seats (Which reminds me, Ryan still has my beer cup!). We watched quite a few innings and then, somewhere in the middle of the excitement, the Giants hit 4 home runs in one inning! It was awesome! There's more to say about the game but I won't bore you with specifics. It was a fun game and I bought a disgustingly over-priced beanie so show my SF pride (and to keep my stupid head warm since in my rush, I failed to grab one of my lovely, home made hats).       After the game we went and saw my friends' band play ( urlLink www.geocities.com/trainwreckriders ). They are wonderful and while we only got to hear three or four songs, I had a good time. I had bought some High Life at the Safeway before they went on and when I got back, I gave one to Steve because for some reason, I like being a part of Steve getting really f***ed up. I gave the other to Chris because if it weren't Chris, I would have never tasted High Life and realized that it's a beer that I like and a beer that I can drink a whole lot of. Unfortunately, during my fun times my friend Ryan was getting unbearably drunk and I had to take him home. When I drove him home he was just being obnoxious and while I love the guy to death, so help me god I wanted to leave him stranded on the side of the freeway. I often wonder if Ryan knew how annoying he was when he drank too much if it would help him curtail his drinking problem. Probably not.      In other news, my ex apparently started smoking cigarettes. During the course of our 2.5 year relationship I was subject to criticism and ostracism because I occasionally smoked. I started smoking more after he broke up with me the first time and then I quit. When he broke up with me the second time, I started up again and then quit. Then I started smoking again when I found out he had a new girlfriend and I haven't been able to quit yet. We're on better terms these days but I was surprised to find that he was smoking because of all the hell that I had to endure because of my occasional ciggie. I should quit and then give him a hard time just to be a brat ; )   However, should he ever try to kiss me again, I would not object on the grounds of smelling and tasting like a ciggie. I'd just be happy that he wants to kiss me again ; P

       I  left my office today during lunch to get a sandwich and after the purchase of said sandwich (from Safeway, my next one is free!), I went and sat out in the nearby park to eat my lunch and read my new book. Well folks, have I got news for you. I LOVE MY NEW BOOK! At my friend Shaina's advice (Shaina of:   urlLink  http://www.sixq.net/shaina/   ) I purchased  Youth in Revolt  by C.D. Payne. I am sure it will become another book that I devour because it reads so well and it is damn funny. What others have to say about it:   urlLink  http://www.nicktwisp.com/reviews.html        Yet my happy thoughts about this book were interuppted when I Googled the book upon my return only to find that once again, Hollywood might ruin a perfectly good book by turning it into a movie. It's set for release in 2005 but I'm upset because the "plot outline of the movie" states: "While his trailer trash parents teeter on the edge of divorce, 14-year-old Nick sets his sights on dream girl Sheeni Saunders, hoping that she'll be the one to take away his virginity." ( urlLink http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0403702/ ). While I am only in the first 50 pages (yes, I read 50 pages at lunch!) I can assure you, dear audience, that Nick's parent's are not Trailer Trash, they are in fact Yuppies as he so duly notes on page 6: "Not very compassionate, but what do you expect from the spoiled offspring of two would-be yuppies?". Futher, his parents ARE ALREADY divorced and you know this by page 4 when Nick's father fails to pick him up at the arranged time for the weekly father visiting time (much like my own father...). So given that bit of direct information from the book, how could Hollywood contort that to mean that Nick is at a trailer park with his trailer trash parents? Perhaps because Hollywood execs know that the average American does not read and instead, waits for the movie version to come out. It's such a shame too because so far this book has me hooked. I'd rather read right now than work. I'm trying to sneak a few pages in here and there as I go but I keep getting too hooked. What a shame... I hate you Hollywood and your stupid sign that I can never see because LA is always too damn smoggy : (      (However, the plot outline has at least one thing right and that is that Nick has met Sheeni Saunders at a trailer park (a Christian trailer park mind you) and is very much so hoping that she is the one to take his virginity away)

       urlLink  http://www.kron.com/Global/story.asp?S=2120931&amp;nav=5D7lPR5h    urlLink  http://www.kron.com/Global/story.asp?S=2121219&amp;nav=5D7lPRCi     I was watching the news this morning and I saw brief snippets of both stories posted (and hopefully linked!) above. It made me wonder what changes in a marriage to make one partner want to kill the other? Is it money? Is it revenge? Do they just drive each other crazy? And why is it more often it seems that the man kills his pregnant wife? Is pregnancy to blame? All these questions! I need answers.    I believe in marriage, very strongly in fact which is probably due to the fact that my parents went through a messy divorce when I was 18. I often feel like I would have been less scarred by this incident had I not spent 18 years of my life knowing my family as a family unit. It was messy and they stuck us in the middle a lot and suffice it to say, I never want to go through with a divorce so when I say "I do" to "till death do us part", I'm going to mean it. I wonder if the people who are "suspected" of killing their wives felt the same way and perhaps, that's why they killed their ladies rather than go through a divorce. I suspect the world may never know their "true motives" and will instead create many theories and such on why Scott Peterson and Mark Hacking killed their wives (well, I guess I should wait for the verdicts in either case but I believe that they are guilty as can be). Maybe this is something that psychologists should study. "Why Spouses Kill One Another" would be of great scientific value because it could help us understand more how two people go from loving each other enough to get married, to killing one another for either money, personal gain, to get out of marriage etc. Perhaps I'm just talking too much about something I know nothing about because I've never been married. Oh well...      In other news, it looks like it could be another bad day. I had to do the dishes this morning and I feel troubled by the fact that an office full of intelligent, industrious adults fail to do their dishes. I think it stems from laziness and the fact that they are used to the notion that if they leave them there, I will inevitably wash the dishes. I wonder what would happen if I went on dish washing strike? Would people wash their own dish as I was taught as a child? I think not.

       Oh wait, I'm still here. I saw a heart today on my walk during lunch. It made me think about how in some ways, I have left my heart in SF because it belongs to someone who lives here that is not with me  . He's got it and I hope that I get my heart and him back all at once. I probably never will  . If love is such a wonderful thing, why does it hurt so bad so often? Does anyone have an answer? Hopefully I'm over this tomorrow...      P.S. Ooo! would you look at the time!

       It's Monday morning...enough said about that. Today is one of those days where you just want to stay in bed and sleep and snuggle with a kitty (or another person) and just watch movies or bad daytime TV. Definitely not a day for going to work. :(       This weekend was nothing but laziness and haziness. I didn't make my friends party because I ate bad Mexican food and that was just bad. Then Saturday I went to the beach with my friend and her sister. Then I went home before I got too tired. Sunday I woke up and went to the same friends' house to sit by the pool and relax. Our other friend came out from Berkeley and we all just chilled. Good ol' stoney times. Then I went to the city to go to a girls' night but I got too tired and my tummy hurt. I was going to sleep over but it's a good thing that I didn't because I could be in jeans right now and then I would be in trouble!      This post sucks because my mood sucks. Forget this crap....+
