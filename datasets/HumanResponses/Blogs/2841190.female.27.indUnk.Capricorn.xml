      Monte, what the hell is this!  Just kidding.  I will post some of them as I get them.  Although from the look of it is gonna take me a long ass time!  Thanks for the challange.  It should help me pass the time over break.  By the way I am onlyhome for a week so we had better do something!    Chops do you have anything planned for break.  I just know I will be home for a couple of days and just wanna come back here.  I plan on seeing Sarah, Monte, and Jaime.  I am going to and see a couple of movies.  The Passion of Christ and Hildalgo for sure.  Not sure what else.  Gonna attempt to kick Jaimes ass at ps2.  Maybe go bowling.  Mostly just hang and chill!  That is what I really want to do.  Just hang out and chill.  I think I will do another piece of artwork while I am home.  Something to shut my brain off!  That's all I have for right now.  I am out!

      This test does not measure your intelligence, your fluency with words, and certainly not your mathematic ability. It will, however, give you some gauge of your mental flexibility and creativity. In the years since we first developed the test, we have found few people who could solve more than half the problems on their first try. Many, however, reported getting answers long after the test had been set aside, particularly at unexpected moments when their minds were relaxed, and some reported solving all the problems over a period of several days. Take this as your personal challenge.  Instructions: Each question below contains all the initials of words that will make it correct. Find the missing words. For example: 16 O. in a P. means 16 ounces in a pound.  Note: this test does have a distinct USA flavor, that might be why you do not understand a given question.  1)   26 L. of the A._____________-41)  29 D. in F. in a L. Y. 2)  7 W. of the A. W.___________-42)  3 P. for a F. G. in F. 3)  1,001 A. N.________________-43)  1,000 W. that a P. is W. 4)  12 S. of the Z._____________-44)  56 S. of the D. of I. 5)  54 C. in a D.

       Nothing But Thoughts   Thinking Wondering Wanting Dying This is all I have. Nothing but thoughts Wishing Screaming Calling And no answer. This is all I have Nothing but thoughts Why can’t you be mine? Why do you not see us? Best friends we say, Denial I think. Love is what I feel Compassion. I am the most patient person you know. Do you realize that? Can’t you see? It was supposed to be me. Instead she is there In my place As you say  “I wish she was more like you” Fool.   Why have a substitute When you could have the real thing. Can you be that blind? Open your eyes and see me You say  I am the most important thing in your life Why do I feel like the least. You spend time with me and things are great Easy I guess this is what happens  When you love your best friend I don’t want you as a friend I just want you Yet I can’t walk away Run is what I should do Fast and far My heart is racing Speeding  You are in my sights I can’t breath. I have to contain myself Pretend that it is not here Hi Just friends Nothing else No biggie Just hang Things are good with us together Girlfriend is like an STD to me She just won’t go away Wants to be my friend Not a chance Friends Yuck Time to go Shut the brain off Let things run off Can’t stop  Soon another year down Still dreaming Loving Thinking Wondering Wanting Dying This is all I have. Nothing but thoughts Wishing Screaming Calling And no answer. This is all I have. Nothing but thoughts Time to let go Gone

       Hello!  Thank-You Laura.  You are so right.  I know that but, I am still having a hard time.  I think it is mostly because I have lost a lot of my self esteem.  I also have to start over and it seems a little overwhelming.  Anyway, enough about that.  I feel like I am whining.  How is everybody?  Somebody tell me something exciting.  I am bored.  Laura, I hope to see you over spring break.  Monte should have off work.  I am gonna start to fill out financial aid so I can go back to school.  I can't wait.  I need my life to move on.  Well, I don't have anything to say.  Next time I will be more exciting.  Hopefully!

      So this is gonna be a "normal" post.  I promise!  Thanks for putting up with my last couple of posts, they were honest but kinda strange, I know.  Well, this week was so busy.  Today my lack of sleep has hit me hard.  I am wiped out.  Totally beat and I just know that I will be up until some inane hour.  Which is ok since I don't have any classes tomorrow.    Spring Break is right around the corner but it feels like forever away.  Tonight is gonna be a relaxing night of TV and just hanging out chillin'.    BTW, Sarah, I know things are hard right now but they WILL get better.  I know that I can say that until I am blue in the face but, I promise you things will get better.  You just have to trust that you are a strong person who can overcome any odds.  You have already proven that.  Look at all you have gone through already, and you are still standing.  Even Muhammad Ali's knees got week from time to time but he kept standing.  Believe in yourself, I do.  I know you will make it to the end of all of this and look back on it and know that you were able to walk away with pride, dignity, respect, and honor.  That has to mean something!  Monte, damn it!      Compassion comes from us, From within. It is not given or bought, Rather it is taught through humility. Unfortunately it us a hard lesson to learn for most. For those who have already acquired it, It must be held strong. For those who have yet to find it, They must strive forward. With it we can succeed in all facets of our lives. Compassion is one of the keys.  By: me  I know it is not the only key so don't someone go and be smart.  I am out...

       Hello all!  Mike, Thank-You for the nice words.  I am trying to be strong.  Laura, I am sorry you were having such a bad day.  And you are very special and do make people feel better.  I am all messed up today, too.  I have just been real confused lately.  I can't even really pinpoint what is wrong.  I feel regret, sadness, anger, vulnerability, and I feel I don't know where to go from here.  It seems overwhelming.  Some days I am real positive about life and finding love again.  Today, I feel there will be no man I can ever trust in a relationship.  Why are we all crazy?  Oh well!

      I am not sure how to say what I want to say without it sounding conceited.  I love it here at school.  I love it because most everyone on the floor comes to me with problems and they leave feeling better.  That makes me feel great.  It makes me feel good knowing that I made someone else feel better.  I know that my friends and family have always told me that I was important but for some reason it is different here.  I know that most people like me as a person but here I really feel like people like me.  That I really do make a difference.  People here tell me that they like me and that they are glad that I am their friend.  For some reason it has actually hit me today.  People really DO like me.  I don't mean that to be bragging.  It's more of a revelation.  I would not change the experience I am getting here for anything in the world.  None of this will be going to my head but, I just feel really good right now.  It is nice to have people respect you for your honesty and to have the let you know that you really do make a difference.  I know I keep talking in circles so I am gonna let this go now.  I want to let all of you know that you mean so much to me.  Jaime, Monte, and Sarah for always being there for me when I needed you.  I don't know if I would be here if it wasn't for you guys.  Thank you for sticking with me when I was so down that I couldn't even see the light.  Thank you for not letting me leave this earth when I wanted to and for showing me the reasons to live.  Angie, thank you for taking a chance on a stranger!  Shane, I love you little brother.  I am so proud of you and all you do!!!  Chops you have an amazing soul.  Our friendship is new and I look forward to watching it grow.  K, gonna go now cuz I am totally insane!!!  DUH....

      Not sure what is up with me today. I mean I know but I don't know what triggered it. I was perfectly fine, happy even. Having fun hanging with everyone and goofing around and then everything took a sharp turn in the opposite direction. I am angry, sad, frustrated. I basically feel like shit and I am not in the mood to put up with even the slightest tone in someones "hello". I think I know what was the final trigger (cuz it was starting before this but this was the straw). I was doing my laundry, which I am very good at making sure I am down there within a few minutes of it being done so that other people don't have to wait to use the washers. Anyway, one of the girls on the floor had her friends (who got kicked out of her parents house for fucking off) using out laundry facilities. I go downstairs and my clothes have been moved from the washer to the table. WHat the fuck!!! I have lived here for a year and no ones ever taken my clothes out of the washer or the dryer. EVER!!! I mean this girl doesn't even go to the damn school much less live in my fucking dorm! And when I said something to her she responded to me like, how dare I ask her anything. That girl should be lucky I didn't kick the shit out of her when she came up to the floor later. I know that is extreme and I wouldn't have actually done that but, I am in that kinda mood. I hate when I get this way. I feel like I am out of control. I can't keep my emotions in check and everything sets me off. I ...damn-it! I feel so alone! I wish I could curl up in a ball and stay in my room for a week. Cry. Scream! It feel like breaking something. I wish I could break something! Just throw something. Get it out! Shut off my brain and stop thinking all this crap that is running through it. I just wish I could hug someone and cry until I fell asleep. I wanna go home. I don't really wanna go home but...hell I don't know. I need to stop writing on here or you guys will have real confirmation that I am crazy. I mean you already do now but, no need to give you anymore. HEHE   Night all. Sorry about this and thanks for listening.

      OMG  as you can see by the time of my post it is 11:45 am and I am sitting in my room.  No biggie, right?  Wrong. I am supposed to be in class right now.  SHIT  I slept until now.  SHIT  I didn't think I was this tired.  SHIT  So heck if I know how my day has gone since I am apparently sleeping it away!!!    Chops I would tell them that this is crap and get the paperwork now before it is all messed up and they come to youto fix it.  However, I am sure that you guys work on a system to elect who does what and that is fine.  But, the system has gone arey.  Bonkers from the sounds of it.  So I am sorry you live in the crazy house.  I meant no disrespect, just as a joke.  But, Tanner 13 is always waiting for you to come home!!!!   MONTE  start writing you goof.  You said you were gonna so hhmmpphh.....  I am out for now.  Love and miss you guys.

      so yeah, funny story. as VP of finances I handle all the money. it makes sense. we decided early on that I would also handle money for all the other events. well, our vp of programming has decided that his committee will be collecting money for the formal cause they have all the paperwork (granted the guy with the paperwork lives all of 100 feet from me. This is very annoying, cause I know this shit is gonna end up with me eventually, and i am gonna have to decipher the stuff he started. This is very annoying.

       Hello people!  Well, I am officially divorced.  I have so many feelings swirling around in me right now.  I am so happy this is all over.  I want a better, happier life.  I became so used to the emotional abuse that it seemed "normal".  I would even stick up for Jim's horrible behavior; which I still catch myself doing once in awhile.  I know I am still working on getting my whole self back.  I should be jumping for joy, but there is part of me that does miss the good times.  Too bad those were few.  I do feel free.  This will be a start to a spectacular life without all that pain.  I could not have gotten here without the loving support of my friends.  Laura you have been an amazing friend and very supportive.  The same with you Monte.  You two are so special to me.  I will still probably need you to talk to and vent.  Just tell me when to shut up!  Anyway, "I WILL SURVIVE"!  Okay, I am done being sappy and cheesy.  On to my next endeavor!

      Well, I finally finished my two huge projects for Graphic Design 2 and Computer Graphic Arts and now I am on to the next ones. Does the madness ever end??!!  Other than that things are ok here.   My friend Jaime, who I talked about before, is trying to fix things with "her". I wish I could just kick him in the ass! I love him but, this subject upsets me. I know that sounds stupid on my part but when I see my best friend getting screwed (and I don't mean that literally because if that was the case I would have to be on the side lines with pom poms and a noise maker cheering him on) all I can think of is how to fix it for them and if I can't how I can be there for them. With this situation all I can do is watch and then help him pick up the pieces. And I am afraid there will be tons of pieces. Damn, I just wanna kick him in the ass ( I think I already said that).  Well, it is Monday and that means that it is a day of freedom for Sarah!!!  This is a good thing!  I am glad that the marriage is over because it was such a bad situation to begin with and now she will have the opportunity to be happy!  She deserves that!  I will have to check out Kill Bill.  I highly recommend that everyone see Big Fish!!!  Amazing movie, great story!  Right now I am looking forward to seeing The Passion of Christ.  I think I will wait until break for that.  Well, I am outta here for now.  I plan on enjoying the night since I actually don't have to rush to do some work!

      Well, I made it through another week! I took my test today and I got at least a B, possibly and A. So far I am pulling an A in GCOM, a B in Art 314 and I have no grades so far in my other classes. I will have some grades in my Art 315 as of next week.   That basically sums up my week and the semester so far. My brother is leaving tomorrow to go out to sea for some test run things before his ship leaves in late May-early June for 7 months. I am gonna miss him but that is what email and letters are for.  Jaime and his girlfriend are trying to fix things between them.  I don't know if I think it is a good idea.  She is so insecure and untrusting.  She can't just decide that she trusts him now that things are a mess in order to fix things.  I don't know what to say to him about it.  I really don't think the two of them are a good idea.  And I don't think that way because I care about him.  I really hate they way he seems to feel alot of the time about her.  He is angry sometimes and it really bothers me.  I am tired of them arguing about our friendship.  It makes me feel bad.  I am glad that Jaime has stuck up for the friendship because it makes me realize how important it is to him.  He has made it very clear to me that he won't give up our friendship for anything.  In the beginning I understood why Melissa (his girlfriend) was nervous but they have been together for a year now and enough is enough.  They are on a "break" right now because she accused him of cheating on her with me.  He says he cares about her but he doesn't know what to do because it is clear she has trust issues.  I just wanna tell him to run real fast but as a friend all I can do is support him in his decision.  Although, I do hope he decides that he deserves better.  I think he needs to find someone who is as strong a person as he is and who is really ready for a relationship.  I just don't think that Melissa is ready for that yet in her life.  I don't fault her for that I just hope that they both do what is best for them individually.    Holy cow, I should stop writting now.  If Jaime does happen to read this I hope he knows I meant no disrespect.  Just trying to get things off my chest.  Well, I will let you guys go and I hope everyone is doing great.  TTYL

      HOLY COW!  So like Chops said woo-hoo to the whole Maddux thing!  Go Cubbies!  I finally have my test tomorrow for GCOM.  The one I was supposed to have on Tuesday.  My teacher gave us the wrong date and all he had to say about it was that we should all be really prepared.  BITE ME!!  My brother is leaving on Friday to go out on a training run for his upcoming Naval cruise.  He will be gone for at least a month this time and he then leaves in May-June for 7 months.  Kinda sucks and I will miss him but I know he will be fine.  He better write while he is gone this time.  I am gonna give him tons of stamps and address labels so he can send postcards.    Other than that things have been kinda slow here.  Just did some work today and hung here.  This weekend is gonna be pretty busy since I have a huge project due on Monday and I have to do the whole thing in InDesign.    Well, I hope everyone is doing great and i look forward to hearing from you.  Oh my, Sarah, only 5 or 6 more days and you will be a single woman!!!!  I think I have to say I am sorry this has happened and yet I feel the need to congratulate you.  Things will be cool!  Ok, I am outta here for tonight!  Love ya guys!  P.S. Chops remember: no worries!

      All of ye who care about sports will be interested in the latest news about the Cubs. All who don't care will have to deal with me for a second.   The Cubs signed Greg Maddux to a 3 year 24 million dollar deal.....This gives the 37-year old Maddux the oppurtunity to win the 300th game of his career in Chicago where it all started. This also gives the edge back to the Cubs in the arms race in the NL Central...   YES!!!!!!  GO CUBS GO!! GO CUBS GO!!  Hey Chicago whaddya say? The cubs are gonna win today!!!   GOD BLESS MOMMY, DADDY, AND THE CHICAGO CUBS....   IM OUT   (if i seem a little out of it, just refer back to when this is being posted.)

          Hello, all!  Laura, love the poems.  Poetry is great.  Seven days!  Seven days till I am divorced!  I will be very happy to be rid of the marriage and the hell that I lived.  I also feel bad because I do believe in love and marriage.  I hate the fact that I married the wrong man and I was so stupidly blind to his crap.  I feel like I wasted so much time.  I am excited, though.  To have a fresh start and I can have a happy life without all the pain.  I really can't wait till I get all of my shit together; like going back to school.  Yeah!!!  Alright, I am going to go read.  Bye.

      The following poems are just two of my collection.  If you guys don't mind every once in awhile I would like to put them up here for all to see.  These two have been published which made my day!  Hope you enjoy.   Flow   In the booth beside me it seems just fun at the start. Then there was the relaxation time. Things felt so right, as I glowed. Happy. Slowly came the fear. So toxic and entrapping. So familiar, so normal. Suddenly, the pain. Like a flood drowning a small town. Pain that consumed and took my life. As I saw the water flow over my eyes,the air was gone. Then the anger. So destructive, so strong. Only to me. Then nothing. Simply nothing. Now I sit in the comfort. The comfort of self and surrounding. Comfort of past and present. Next - Another step toward happiness.  Laura Tiffany  Copyright ©2002 Laura Tiffany     Breathe   The smell is still in my nose. Tingling every membrane and edge of skin. Causing every memory to shift in my brain. The scent is in my clothes and on my hair. On my sheets and in my soul. It is like smooth silk on my skin. Like rich chocolate on my tongue. Like strong hands pulling on my hair,and The feel of a soft hand on my cheek. I close my eyes. I see the shimmering colors of stars. Bold but soft. It hits me with an intoxicating blow. As I inhale, it is as if you are right there. Leaning in towards me to kiss my neck. I can smell you. It is strong, harsh, soft, and sweet. As I smile in ecstasy I reach for you. I open my eyes to see you and I am, Alone  Laura Rosemarie Tiffany  Copyright ©2002 Laura Tiffany

      Chops...what is wrong.  Is someone punishing you?  Do I need to come over there and kick some butt?  I will, I swear I will!  Not sure what was up but if you are bummed just know that I love you.  Remember that whatever beats you down, pushes you around or talks to you like you are dirt, that as long as you get back up you have won.  And that because of that you are now a stronger and more compassionate person.  So smile silly, you are loved!  Oh, you can also just call when you need to talk (anytime) 7495

      Hey everyone.  I just got home and it is late.  4:00 am to be exact.  I had a great night and did some crazy stuff but overall I had fun.  I got to hang out with Jaime and when I got home I got to talk to Sarah.  I breifly got to talk to Monte today and it seems that everyone is coping ok with the day.    I am gonna go and crash but I just wanted to say thank you to Jaime for making me feel better about eveything (you have been a lifesaver).  Thanks to Sarah and Monte for helping me through things and thanks to Chops for listening to me ramble and supporting me.  All of you mean alot to me and I just wanted to make sure you knew it.  Off to bed now, talk to you later.  Love you guys!

      I don't know what the heck I am doing awake right now.  it is 7:30 am on Saturday.  I think I am gonna go back to bed.  I just thought you should all know this!    I firmly agree with Chops concerning National Single Awareness Day.  Being single does have a certian freedom about it.  Ii like that, sometimes and today I am gonna truly enjoy it!   Back to be and until later!

      Crazy... I was crazy once... they locked me up in around room and told me to sit in the corner... corner... i couldnt find the corner... that bugs me.. bugs I hate bugs.. they drive me crazy...Crazy... I was crazy once....  ive been somewhat frustrated lately, and this came to mind.    National Singles Awareness Day is upon us. Celebrate it. If you are single enjoy your freedom or just go out and have a good time. Don't think about the fact that you are single. Just enjoy the moment.    If you are in a relationship. Don't worry about what might happen, dont worry about what has happened. Just enjoy the moment.   Now I just gotta get myself to follow that and everything will be good.

      Hey guys!  Things are looking up on this end.  I went and got my hair done and it looks pretty much like shit.  But since it looks like I am gonna live I guess it will at least grow out!  and it does look like shit!  So I went to m y many doctor visits today.  The doctor that I have been dealing with these past weeks says that my skin cell test came back and that there was not enough tissue to test.  However, she feels that I am getting better and as long as I continue to improve and heal up all the way than I should be fine.  So I am gonna take all of that as good news and be thankful!  No cancer for now!!!!!!  I have to go back in a month and see her to have some more tests done but for now I am okie dokie!  Woo hoooooooooo!!!!!!!!!!  The other doctor that I had to see today says that I am still crazy and she upped my meds/  Oh well so I am a bit "out of whack"  what else is new!  Shocking huh!  Other than that I am hibernating in my house due to my awful haircut.  I have a poodle on my head.  It will grow out and look fine in a few weeks so I just gotta get through the next few weeks!  I think I can manage a bad cut.  At least I know it won't drive me crazy since I am already there!  hehe  Hope all of you are doing great.  I was right, I knew Sarah would fill out the survey!  I hope you enjoyed your day off Chops!  Later

      Monte, what can I say?  You are crazy!  So, I am home again :()  I am hoping this will be the last trip home until spring break!  Which I am whole-heartedly looking forward to!  A week of hanging in my pj's and not having to skip class to do it!   The doctor does not have any of my test results back yet.  I go see her on Friday.  Yippie!  Woo hoo!  I don't have to much to say right now.  I am home and I am bored. Not bored enough to...nevermind!  I am looking forward to tomorrow.  I have nothing to do except get my haircut and hang out with Jaime!  I am looking forward to that. Then sometime over this weekend I will be hanging out with Sarah and Monte.  That will be exciting too!!!  K that is all I have for now.  I think I will go and try to find some silly quiz or something. Later!

      So I had this test this morning of which I did not study nearly enough for.  I had the option of going to take it now and possible walking out with a D or worse or I could wait and take a make-up exam at the end of the semester.  The make up would be an essay test.  My specialty!  I thought about it and I decided to take the make-up.  I figured that if I was gonna go in today and screw it up then I would be stuck with that grade.  If I take the make-up at least I have plenty of time to study and catch up on my reading.  Therefore ensuring myself a better grade.  If I catch up and then keep up with my reading I don't think that it will be a problem for me to at least pull a C on the make-up.  Last time I checked a C would be better than a D! So that was my rational for blowing off my exam .  I think it makes sense!  Maybe.    So, the rest of my day was great!  Busy but wonderful.  Tonight I get to work some more on my project for GD2 which is due tomorrow.  I think I may have said it once before but in case you missed it:  I DETEST PHOTOSHOP!!!!  Off to do some homework!  I hope all of you had a great day!  Keep posting and know I think of you  guys often!  Monte, post you butt-muncher.  I love ya!

      I have been busy all day and will be this way all week. I really hope that I can get all my work done while avoding insanity. I also really hope that the weather is halfway decent. I am really tempted to do some running outside if it gets a little warmer. I really don't have much to say cause not much has happened lately.... hopefully I'll have something interesting to talk about eventually.   Laura - Everything will be fine.

      Well one more day down the drain.  I went to class today and I am sure my project sucked compared to everyone else's.  So I am gonna work on it more tomorrow cuz tonight I have huge test to study for.  I hate photoshop.  I don't know how to use it and I have no idea what the hell I am doing in it.  I have all these ideas and uugggg........damn.  Frustrating!  I have not heard from the doctor yet so maybe tomorrow.  Kinda nervous about it cuz I don't know what is going on with me and whatever it is, it's not getting better.  I am not usually the most optimistic person (can you tell?)  but, I am trying to be with this whole thing cuz the worst case scenario is really bad!!!  SO, I THINK THAT EVERYTHING IS GONNA BE GREAT!  THIS IS NOTHING AND IT WILL PASS AND BECOME SOMETHING SMALL AND SILLY THAT I ALLOWED TO CONSUME MY TIME.  SILLY ME!!!!  :)  It was quite nice outside today.  I think it got up to 35 or so and the sun was out!  Not to bad for February.  The snow is melting so it kinda looks icky but I look forward to seeing grass again!  Tempatures in the 70's and 80's.  Oh yes, great weather!  Soon, Mr. Groundhog, soon!  hehe  I hope everyone is doing good and I look forward to hearing from all of you.  Hugs and Kisses and have a great day!  BTW...we have the best sunsets here at school!!!!!  They are so beautiful :)

       Hello!  Thanks for the nice words Laura, I really appreciate it.  Monte has off this weekend and we want to know if you still want to hang out.  He stopped by tonight on his way home.    I thought I would say a few basics about myself just like Mike. I am 27 years old and don't like it. (Too Old!)  I just moved to Lake Geneva, WI from Woodstock, Il because I am going through a divorce.  I basically have to start everything over.  I will be going back to school soon.  Although, I can't make a decision on what I want to do.  I have a beautiful beagle named Heineken(I know) who is my baby.  That's it for now, I don't want to bore anyone.  Bye!

        Your wings are  BROKEN  and tattered. You are an angelic spirit who has fallen from grace for one reason or another - possibly, you made one tragic mistake that cost you everything. Or maybe you were blamed for a crime you didn't commit. In any case, you are faithless and joyless. You find no happiness, love, or acceptance in your love or in yourself. Most days are a burden and you wonder when the hurting will end. Sweet, beautiful and sorrowful, you paint a tragic and touching picture. You are the one that few understand.

I am very tired and am defnitely looking forward to spring break.  I am looking forward to being out of here for awhile and relaxing. More importantly, however, I am looking forward to getting back home and trying to get something set up so that I have a job this summer. Prefferibly something that has something to do with my major. Anyways, I realize that many of you do not know me, one of these days I will explain myself but for now I will just give ya the basics. I am a 20 year old Computer Science major from Mt. Prospect, IL. I know Laura cause I lived on Tanner 13 last semester, but have moved into my fraternity house since then.    Thats all for now.

      Howdy, y'all.  So things are pretty quiet here on Tanner 13!  The girls have done their partying and are finally resting up for another week of classes!  We are all looking forward to having Thursday off (thank you President Lincoln and Happy Birthday to you!).  I think I have finally finished my project for GD2 (graphic design 2) and now I can start thinking about my book cover I have to design.  Hmmm...I think I will make a new cover for Dead Babies by Martin Amis.  I am kind of looking forward to this project.  I get to really do what I want!  Sarah, I know you are not that depressing!!!  Thank goodness.  Although things have been tough for you recently you have still managed to hold your head up high.  That idiot you are almost finally rid of will one day see his error.  However, you will  continue to shine and move on.  Like I have told you before, it is like a new start.  So kudos to you!    Chops, gym shoes huh.  Well, I think it fits you. You are comfy and laid back and easy to hang with.  Thanks again for letting me borrow the DVD.  I am gonna watch the second disc when I am done here.  Well, I am out for now.  Gonna go watch this DVD and hang until it is time for the Grammy's.  Hmmm...who will win?

      Hello, all!  I am Laura's friend Sarah.  I think this is really cool and will love to hear what everybody has to say.  I do have to warn you about our friend Monte.  If he ever writes anything on here, you will know why I warned you.  Monte if you are reading this, I am talking about another Monte!  Anyway!  Laura I took that wings quiz and my results were kinda pathetic.  So, I am not sure if I will share with you all.  Maybe tomorrow.

        Your wings are  BROKEN  and tattered. You are an angelic spirit who has fallen from grace for one reason or another - possibly, you made one tragic mistake that cost you everything. Or maybe you were blamed for a crime you didn't commit. In any case, you are faithless and joyless. You find no happiness, love, or acceptance in your love or in yourself. Most days are a burden and you wonder when the hurting will end. Sweet, beautiful and sorrowful, you paint a tragic and touching picture. You are the one that few understand. Those that do know you are likely to love you deeply and wish that they could do something to ease your pain. You are constantly living in memories of better times and a better world. You are hard on yourself and self-critical or self-loathing. Feeling rejected and unloved, you are sensitive, caring, deep, and despite your tainted nature, your soul is breathtakingly beautiful.    urlLink   *~*~*Claim Your Wings - Pics and Long Answers*~*~*     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla

      Wow.  So Chops has now got me hooked on Sports Night.  It is a TV series and I just finished watching half of the first season.  I wasn't really sure how I felt about it after the first episode but now I am hooked and I feel like I am invested in the characters.  So, thanks so much Chops!  I am loving it!   Oh yeah, for those of you who don't know Chops his name is Mike.  We call him Chops here at school.  Kinda confusing but after awhile you will just get it.  So any posting done by Mike is Chops.  If that made sense.

      Ok this is the last quiz for the day!  I promise.  I couldn't help it though, I just thought the results were kinda cool.  Mine really fits and it does sound like me.  So check it out and let us know how you did!     You are a  PHOENIX  in your soul and your wings make a statement. Huge and born of flame, they burn with light and power and rebirth. Ashes fall from your wingtips. You are an amazingly strong person. You survive, even flourish in adversity and hardship. A firm believer in the phrase, 'Whatever doesn't kill you only makes you stronger,' you rarely fear failure. You know that any mistake you make will teach you more about yourself and allow you to 'rise from the ashes' as a still greater being. Because of this, you rarely make the same mistake twice, and are not among the most forgiving people. You're extremely powerful and wise, and are capable of fierce pride, passion, and anger. Perhaps you're this way because you were forced to survive a rough childhood. Or maybe you just have a strong grasp on reality and know that life is tough and the world is cruel, and it takes strength and independence to survive it. And independence is your strongest point - you may care for others, and even depend on them...but when it comes right down to it, the only one you need is yourself. Thus you trust your own intuition, and rely on a mind almost as brilliant as the fire of your wings to guide you.You are eternal and because you have a strong sense of who and what you are, no one can control your heart or mind, or even really influence your thinking. A symbol of rebirth and renewal, you tend to be a very spiritual person with a serious mind - never acting immature and harboring a superior disgust of those who do. Likewise, humanity's stupidity and tendency to want others to solve their problems for them frustrates you endlessly. Though you can be stubborn, outspoken, and haughty, I admire you greatly.    urlLink   *~*~*Claim Your Wings - Pics and Long Answers*~*~*     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla

This driving back and forth every weekend is killing me.  4 hours there, 4 hours back.  Just a pain in my ass!  Well now I have to get working on my graphic design 2 homework and study my history test (guess I should have kept up on the reading).  First I think I will chill and watch some TV.  Ok so I am just being lazy.  What else is new!!!!  :)  Oh and Ang, just email me your new address!!!!  Thanks and I am so excited for you and your new place!  Just think the wedding is just around the corner!

      Well, first off I'd like to thank Laura for inviting me to write on her blogger. I just got back from Tanner 13, (always interesting) and am going to be soon. Just thought I'd check it out.  I really hope that a lot people write on this, cause bloggers can be a lot of fun and they can be a great way to keep in contact with people you dont see all the time.   Anyways, I'm out.   Good fight.   Good night.

      Hey there everyone!!!  I am glad to see you came to check things out.  If you are here you already know what kinda things have been going on with me.  Things have been kinda rough lately.  To be honest I am pretty freaked out about the whole thing.  Even the idea that I may have breast cancer makes me cry.  Crying, I have been doing alot of that lately.  Mostly because I have just been scared and some because even though I have my friends and family I feel kinda alone with this one.  Everyone who knows about this has been so great!  So THANK YOU!!!  Today I went to the doctor again and she took a scraping of tissue from my breast and then I had an ultrasound done.  She wanted me to have a mammogram done but because of my age they said it may be a problem.  So they said I should have the ultrasound done first.  The doctor in radiology said that there is a thickening of the tissue and that if the rash I have doesn't go away completely then I should be concerned.  He said that it would lead him to suspect cancer.  So now I just wait and see what the skin cells say.  I should know something by the middle of next week.    On to much lighter things.  School is going good.  I am still so glad I switched my major.  I love doing this graphic design stuff.  I am not to big on the drawing part but I love the computer aspect.  If it was up to me I would just sit down and do it all on the computer but they say I still have to draw things out.  So I gotta do what they say.    Well, I guess I will go for now.  I have tons to say but I have to save some for later.  I hope you like this whole idea.  Come back and read and write anytime you want! Laura

      Well, it has been awhile since I have posted.  Lots has happened but most of you know most of it already so I will be breif.   My brother is getting married and he wants to have his wedding in the Carribean.  Which is amazing but the expense it just as amazing.  After talking to my mom about it we figure it is going to cost me about $1600.00.  Which is alot, especially since I am on and income of only $9600.00 a year.  I am still working out the kinks and so far it is not looking like it is going to work.  I only hope that if I am unable to attend that he will be understanding.  If that is the case then I will be going to spend a week with him sometime after he gets back.  His wedding is going to be March of 2005 so I would be going to see him in May 2005.  Well, I could use anyones advise as far as how ti handle this situation.  He is planning this around my Spring break so that I would be able to go.  I had already started planning a trip to the Bahamas with some of the girls here but we decided that if I go to my brothers wedding then we would go on that trip in January before coming back to school.  So that part will work out no matter what.  I am just concerned about hurting my brothers feelings and having him be angry with me.  I don't want that to happen!  Also, I got a phone call this morning from my dad and apparently my mom fell on her way out to the garage this morning and broke her ankle in two places.  At this point she has already had surgery and is will be spending the night at least in the hospital.  They had to put 7 screws and a metal plate on each side of her ankle.  She is going to have a long recovery ahead of her.  Not to mention that this is the same foot she just had surgery on 6 months ago.  So she just finished healing fromthat and now she gets to do it all over again.  Lucky her.  At least I know where I got my clutziness from.  My ankle is slowwwwwwwllllllyyyyy getting better.  Can't walk without the brace or it will give out.  Other than that things are ok here.  Most of my classes are going fine but I am having real trouble with one and it looks like I am going to be retaking it next year!  What can ya do...  Well, I  hope that everyone is doing great.  I miss all of you.  I can't wait for summer.   I am out for now...

      DAMN!!!!  So, I spent a few hours at the local er today because I can't walk.  Stepped off a curb and onto a damn rock.  Apparently I have a severe sprain and the doctor informed me that a sprain can sometimes hurt more than a break so that is why it hurts so much.  So now I get to use crutches for the next week or so.  How lucky can I be!!!!   How is everyone doing.  Sorry you are so busy Chops cuz I miss our talks!

      I am glad to be back but I am  not  happy to be sick! For those of you who don't know I have strep throat. I know you are all jealous but I think I am gonna keep this one for myself. No sharing! I am usually all about sharing but, I feel like this one is all mine and for some reason I am pretty sure none of you are gonna mind my selfishness on this one!  So that is all I have to report today since I didn't do anything. Hope all of you are feeling well and enjoying your Monday!  Miss you guys!  Oh yeah I should say Congratulations to my bro.  He is engaged and happy about it so it is a good thing!  love you!!!!!  I hope I feel better soon.  I haven't felt this bad in a long time.  Freaking strep!!!!!!!!!!  :(   I am out......

      Yup, the activity here is moving at a slow crawl!!!!  It is almost Sunday and as strange as it sounds I am looking forward to getting back to WIU.  Even though (as Chops said) I will be up to my neck in work!  Simply because I am a slacker that is.  I work better under pressure!  Or so I have myself convinced...  Either way being home was good and I am looking forward to the summer.  A week is not really enough to do anything.  You see first there is the rest we have to catch up on, then the doing nothing, then friends, family...just not enough time.  Summer will fix that, I am sure!!!  I just wanna say that Monte we will hang soon, sorry we missed each other this time!  Love ya! Sarah, I am so glad we went out.  We got to talk and that was really the best part for me!  I am looking forward to more hangin'!  I love you and don't ever forget it! Jaime, you are a shit, but what can i do...you mean the world to me.  Thank you so much for everything!  Until next time...xoxo...love always, your SBW Chops, thanks for being my sanity.  It meant much more than you think!  Shane, if you read this I am thinking about you.  I love and miss you little brother!!!!!  That's it. Listen to me gettin all mushy, I haven't left yet!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   Later

       I am  urlLink Disco Stu ! Which  urlLink Simpsons Character  are YOU?   So I went to see Passion with Sarah today.  I am not sure what I think.  It was an amazing movie.  I left feeling angry and sad.  I didn't cry during the movie.  I probably should have but I was so angry while watching it, and so appalled that I think my mind just froze up.  I did leave with alot of things running through my head, thoughts that even disgusted me (and they were my own thoughts!).  I need to sit on this for awhile before I go and decide what I think or how I feel. So, I will get back to you on this.  My parents are leaving in the morning to head of to Arkansas to be with my Aunt.  I hate when I am here alone for so long.  I like it at first but then I just get lonely and depressed.  So, I will have to find things to do when that kicks in!  Thanks to everyone who has been supportive with me during this stuff with my Uncle.  I know I am not the best with this stuff but it does mean alot to me.  So thanks.

      It is only 2 o'clock pm and today already sucks!  My Uncle Jim, who has been very ill with cancer, is not doing well.  He has gotten worse and they are saying it will be a few days at the most if not hours until he passes.  I can't believe this.  I know that most of you know how many deaths we have had in the past few years.  I guess this is what happens when we get older.  Since that is the case I want to be 10 again!  Everyone here is really upset.  Even though we knew it was coming (since they gave him six months on the out end about 1.5 months ago), it doesn't make it any easier.  I spoke with my Aunt and she doesn't want me to come down.  She and my Uncle had discussed it and they will not be having a formal funeral.  She knows my parents will be there but she does not see any need for me to come.  So I won't be going because I fell like I need to respect her wishes right now.  Even though I feel like I should be there.  I was unable to attend my Aunt Gayles funeral last year because it was during finals.  She (Aunt Gayle) would have been pissed at me if I had gone and missed a test!  I guess I am just babbling right now because I don't know how I am feeling or what to say.  Anyway, I just need to vent a bit.  I am gonna go for now.  I am sure I will be back later...Thanks everyone.

      Laura - had a good time hanging out with susan. Interesting twist, brother timmy is friends with susan's sister gail. because of that, timmy came over with me and the older and younger siblings all hung out. wasn't what I expected, but it was fun. also probably kept me from saying something stupid.  but yeah... good times   (I am the king of LOTR trivial pursuit (3-0))

      welcome to mt. prospect where the playas play....ok not really, its quiet here but its all good. Saw a movie with my brother and a friend tonight. I didnt realize how much I had really missed the kid till tonight. We used to fight a lot when we were younger, but one he got a little older we started getting along. He's the one that actually talked me into growing the hair out, and im the one that backs him whenever mom gets on his case about getting ready for college. We played candy land tonight and acted like total goofs. It was a blast. I hope I can get him to come down to macomb and open up like this, cause he usually shy around strangers. he is an absolutely hillarious kid and definitely the better of the two Kowols brothers (no joke)

      Oh it is so good to be home.  I only wish I had nothing to do while I was here, but I have about 7 chapters to read for my art history class.  This is what happens when you are a slacker like me.  So don't be a slacker!!!  Either way I am going to enjoy my break.  Just chill out, do a whole lot of nothing (besides some reading), and hang with friends when I get a chance.  I am pretty sure I am not going to do very much but it is nice to have change of scenery.  Well off to do ...  Nothing......

      All I gotta say about the girl from Average Joe, What a stupid girl.  The Boston guy was awesome and beat me to the punch (replace Fenway with Wrigley) anyways....I am working on studying for tests. Hopefully I do well.

      So, just a few days until SB!!!!!! :) I can't wait. Things have been good for me so far this week.  I don't really have to much to talk about right now. Although, I can say that I am never gonna watch Average Joe again. That stupid bitch. I can't believe that she picked the guy she did. I mean he was hot but he had no heart. At least not like the Boston guy! Ok, enough about my ranting!  I think she should have picked the other guy but, you can't dictate what your heart desires!  I still think the Boston guy was way better!!!  I am out for now. More to come later!!!!!!  Oh yeah and Monte, it only takes me approximately 5 minutes to pee.  That includes time to walk to and from the bathroom.  But then I need time to wash my hands.  ThenI need time to get comfy in my room and then there is the time to dial th phone.  ThenI have to wait for you to answer.  Things take time, silly.

      I'm gonna break the silence....  Life in Macomb...... There's not much to do down here.  That's why we drink as much as we do.    I really don't have much to say, it just seemed as though the last message threw everyone off a bit...

      this weekend was awesome..... our alumni rock the house. I met a lot of really cool guys that have came through here in the past and heard some amazing stories. I even met a Hersey alum from the early 90's. Friday night we had a meet and greet at this place in the square and then went over to the Pace. We had probably at least 20 guys there, and possibly as many as 30. It was awesome. Saturday we had a luncheon at the house, watched the NFL draft and the cubs game and hung out.  that night we had a dinner and then went out to the bars, we started at the pace and ended up at two dogs. we had a good sized group there. I got dragged out onto the dance floor and ended up dancing with a bunch of different girls who were friends of the house and just had a good time. After the bar closed we went back to the house and sat around and shot the shit for awhile. I ended up crawling into bed at about 6:30.  there is even more to it than that but I could talk about the weekend for pages. ask me in person if you want more details    to sum it all up:     This was my best weekend as a DU and I am more proud now than ever of the letters.

      Well I am pretty sure school is starting to completely suck ass!  Yup, I am starting to hate it.  I just want it to be over.  For shit to end and for it to be summer.  I just need some kind of a break.  Something, anything, just a damn break.  A break that I cannot afford right now either.  Damn this sucks!    I am hoping that Jaime has finally put an end to things with the pyscho from hell.  I think the damn girl is stalking me.  Having her friends pretend to know me and talk to me online trying to get information about who knows what.  Crazy girl!  He says he has taken care of things.  So hopefully I won't have to deal with this shit anymore cuz frankly I can't handle it.  I completely lost it the other night and started to cry with him on the phone.  I just can't take her shit anymore and try to still be civil.  So he got pissed off at her and took care of it.  He has finally decided that he does not need her nor want her is his life anymore.  So they are no longer friends and I don't have to deal with her anymore.  AND I dont' have to be nice either and I don't plan to.  So hopefully she willjust leave me alone cuz I will not be restraining myself any longer.  That is all I have right now.  Sorry it is not so positive but that will change in a few weeks.

      I second Chops.  I want it to end as well.  I am starting to really feel the stress.  These art projects are taking alot out of me.  I can't believe how much work is going into my master final again.  Loving it yet hating it.  Things have been pretty quiet on the floor since it is coming to the end of the year we are all real busy.  I do have some good news.  I got into allof my classes (had to call at teacher to get into one but I got it) and I got a job for the next semester.  I will be working at the front desk here in Tanner.  So it will be a bit extra money for me during the semester.  Other than that things are ok.  I gotta run.  Hope you guys are all doing well.  I don't really see any of you so I do miss ya.  I am out...

      Hello All,    Mike, I am sorry to hear of the drama you went through the other night.  You handled it very well.  If I was drunk I probably would have just made things worse.  That's why when I am drinking now I don't get drunk.  Maybe when I am not an emotional basketcase I will be able to handle it.  Anyway, I applaud you.      Laura, thank-you for your encouraging words.  It really does mean a lot to me.  I really admire how you are dealing with everything that has been thrown at you lately.  I am trying to remain strong and sane.  I just have to remember how blessed I am with my family and great friends.    Talk to you all later!

      Is there some kinda stronghold on everyone that we can't post anymore?  Ok, so I suck too but lets keep it up!  I think we are lacking surveys!  Yup we need some surveys.  So lets try to find some huge ass surveys and post them on here.    I can't wait to go home and hang with my mom.  I am leaving in the morning.  I would also like for you all to say a little prayer for Jaimes ex.  NOT!!!  Cuz I am gonna knock her clear out of the ball park!  Not to mention knocking some sense into that silly boy himself.  Why must things be so damn confusing and why do I feel this way?  THE FRIEND ZONE SUCKS HUGE HAIRY ASS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1  Sarah, smile cuz you are amazing and you are gonna do amazing things with your life.  You have to opportunity to do whatever you want so take it!  Realize that you have come along way and you just have to keep on driving!  Chops, you are one of the kindest, sweetest, most intelligent, sensitive men I know.  I think all of that is good.  I hope you realize that and know that you are wonderfully sexy.

       "I didn't know how many of them it would take to whip my ass, but I knew how many they were gonna use."   So, yesterday was far more interersting than I ever thought it would be. I went to a final four party at my friends house.  My friend Frank and I probably had about 9 beers there and then went to a local establishment known as the Change of Pace.  Four SoCo's and Coke later and I'm talking to some girl named Jackie,  talking about baseball and having a good time. Well, we decided to leave after awhile, cause we were all pretty tattered and broke. So we are walking out, and we were walking the girls to their car.  These two guys walk over towards us, and were giving the girls a hard time. My friend and I stepped and asked them to leave. We told them there was no reason for anything to happen and that they should walk away. Well, this one guy decided I looked like I needed to get my ass kicked, so he started pushing me. At this point Frank stepped in the middle because me and this guy were exchanging words. I had been saying to this guy "Who the fuck do you think you are? Why do you think you need to fight? It's been a good night. No reason for anything to happen, just walk away." Well, I started walking off with thr\e girls and these guys are shouting profanities at me, basically calling me a pussy for not fighting and all sorts of shit like that. Well, while frank was talking to them (there were 3) one of them went around frank and caught up to me and the girls and started pushing me again and calling me a pussy. What these guys didn't know was that frank had given me his phone, he had called the house and the girls had called the cops. We couldn't get a hold of the house, but the cops showed up really damn quick and split the thing up. The two guys out of the 3 that had been looking for a fight ran and their buddy was left their to explain stuff to the cops. The girls were impressed with the way me and frank had handled (the fact that we didn't throw any punches) the one girl was sober enough to drive so she gave us a ride home.    The moral of the story is to expect the unexpected. I had no desire to go the bars, and in the end I ended up meeting a really cool girl  and I almost got into a fight....anyways I'm gonna watch some LOTR  hugs and handpounds.....

The bunny was awesome. all the girls were getting their picture taken with the bunny and dancing with him and shit. it was pretty sweet. one of our advisors came over, and was pissed off about the jello shots. O well. we will just have to deal with the consequences. anyways, I will show pics as soon as I can track some down.

      I think I am gonna just give up on the idea that things are gonna get better.  Yup this is just gonna be another shit-hole year.   My mom is doing crappy.  They still don't have her pain under control.  They are working on it but it seems to be taking along time.  I saw her x-rays and her ankle is screwed.  Her other ankle is sprained and huge as well.  She may be coming home tomorrow so we can get her settled.  It is going to be a very long recovery.  To top things off I got to the hospital and my dad made me sit in a chair and told me that my Grandma died.  They waited to tell me until I got here cuz they didn't want to tell me and then have me drive all the way home.  I don't get this.  Everyone keeps dying and I just can't seem to figure out Gods stupid plan.  I mean what the fuck.  Why now?  I have all this crap running through my head right now.  I can't keep my thoughts straight.  I am trying to be strong for my dad.  My mom can't take care of things right now so he only has us to lean on.  My dad is a "toughie" but he can only take so much.  I just don't know what to say because I can't even figure shit out for myself!  I just don't get it anymore.  Oh to hell with it all...  Thanks for listening to me vent.  This really as sent me for a spin.  I am not dealling very well with this at all.  I just can't stop crying.  I am ok one minute and the next I am a mess.  We can't get a hold of my brother either.  We have been calling all day and night and he is still not in and is not anwsering our messeges.    Anyway, I am out for now...

      So, I was reading the blog that I started that consists of my friends from highschool. It turns out Susan is back from Costa Rica. For those of you keeping score at home, Susan is the girl I was talking about in my rant the other day. In the time that she was in Costa Rica, I realized even more so that I really enjoy spending time with her and that I really do like her. I also decided that it's best not to do anything with that as of now. Actually I don't see myself doing anything with that anytime in the near future, because I am convinced that it  would end badly for me, and I really don't wanna deal with that. This summer will be for rest and relaxation and earning money to keep me drinking. I will worry about that other stuff some other time.

      Well, I just want you to know that I will still be posting even if it is kinda messed up posts. Those of you whom have had the pleasure of experiencing an evening with me while I am on my medication know what I can be like.  Those of you who have not, well all I can say is you are in for some strange posts and thoughts and I am sorry in advance!!!  So anyway, I have not yet taken my meds for the night but I am off to do so and hopefully I will just go to bed this time like I should.  See, ideally I take them and they knock me out and I sleep through the night.  Although, every once in awhile that is not the case.  They don't put me to sleep, instead they make me loopy.  Not to mention I have alomost no recollection of my actions or what I have said.  That is why I have apologized in advance.  I feel mostly sorry for Jaime because I tend to call him in the middle of the night and he can't understand a damn thing I am saying.  Thank god he loves me or I would be screwed.  Ok, well, I love all of you and I do hope all of your summers are going great.  Just 5 more days and I am off to enjoy my B-day.  Everyone have a great Memorial Day!!!!!!!!!!!!

      Self destruction No compassion Murder Hate Disgust Speaks silently to me Flows through my ear Into my brain Thoughts consuming me Everyone can see What they think Not the truth I am fading fast No longer here I've become a shell  Empty Roaming in search of my insides Anything Emotions Can't run forever Am I ready To face my fear The one and only fear I call MYSELF by: Me  I think we all feel that way from time to time.  Mike I know how you feel and I am sorry.  But you do have to believe in order to get through because you are the only one who can get you through.  We as friends can support and love you (as we do) but you have to make the ultimate decision yourself.  We can give advice but it is up to you.  I have faith in you.  I know you are strong inside otherwise you wouldn't have gotten here.  Maybe you are meant to be single or maybe you have spent so much time convincing yourselfef of that so it has become a part of you.  I can relate to that as well.  Chops you are never alone.    Fear does rule us all in one sense or another.  The fear of being alone.  The fear of being rejected.  The fear of losing everything we have worked so hard for.  The fear of going outside.  The fear of letting people in.  The fear of being yourself.  The fear of what others think.  The fear of being loved.  The fear of not being loved.  Through all of this you are not alone.  Remember that, please!  I believe it may not be not your time yet.  I believe in fate, karma.  Maybe you are so precious that you are being held on the side for the one who really needs YOU.  Maybe you need to be found by someone who needs to be loved unconditionally.  Maybe you are the one who will save them from years of heartache, loneliness,and disappointment.  Maybe you are their ticket to joy, love and happiness.  I guess sometime you have to try to look at it from a different side.  This is what I see and I hope you can see it as well.  I hope this makes you feel better.  I love you Chops.

       Hey!  Laura, you are such a goof(green bean butts)!!!  Mike, I really enjoyed reading your last post.  It was very real and I can relate to some of the feelings.  You must really care for Susan.  I agree that one decision or event can change your whole world.  I think that is why I have a hard time making certain decisions.  Also, I do agree that some sort of fear rules each one of us.  I always felt that it was just me, but over time I have really seen that everyone has their own fear.  I wish I was better at believing in myself.  I tend to let others determine how I feel about myself and I hate that more than anything.  I am trying to work on that.  Who knows if it will work?

      I warned Laura that I may do this one of these days, so I will now start a rambling. Hopefully it makes sense. (BTW when I do these things I enjoy writing in the 2nd person and sometimes I don't do it well, especially when I dont proofread as I did with this.)  It is amazing how the smallest event can change everything. The smallest decisions have made a huge impact on your life. Like when you decided to join orchestra.   You were fortunate enough to meet her. Susan. You know what you want to say. What you need to say. The question is: Will you be able to say it? Regardless of what we'd like to believe, fear rules us all. You are afraid of what she will say. Afraid that you will lose something that has become very important to you. You just have to decide if the risk is worth the reward.   Everything happens for a reason. Everything. Perhaps there is a reason why you have been single for all this time. Perhaps it is so that when you find that someone you will enjoy it that much more. That's what you would like to believe, but we know the truth. Deep down inside you believe that the reason you have been single is because you are meant to be single. Not everyone finds someone and you know that. Of course your fear is different. Now, now only are you afraid that the girl would show no interest, but you are also afraid that she would show interest cause you believe that you have no idea what to do.   Believe. You toss that word around a lot. Ever since the Cubs became a team worthy of national attention. JUST BELIEVE...like a mantra. You believe in the Cubs. You believe in your friends, and your family. Hell you even believe in yourself from time to time. As long as it is school or athletics. So why don't you believe in yourself when it comes to that other stuff? The fact of the matter is after years of hearing how great of a guy you are, it just doesn't mean as much, especially when those years have been spent with nothing but dissapointment.... All you can do is believe. Believe in yourself as you do others and remain hopeful, because without hope what do you have?

He had a sexy green bean butt.  What the hell is that about, I think I should go to sleep.  I am out

      Hey all. So just when we thought she was gone the psycho bitch from hell has made another attack. Now as to the validity of her statements I can't say. Today Jaime calls me asks me to come over, says he really needs me to get there cuz he needs to talk. I get there to find the stupid ass slut bag has sent him a card in the mail. The card is congratulating him on becoming a new father to be. What the fuck!!! Now I know that sometimes a pg test can be false. However, I have a difficult time beliveing that 4 of them could be. She says she has gone to the docotr and that she is pg. That she wants to know what he is gonna do and wants him to call her. He and I talked about it and I told him that when he calls he needs to find out how far along she is, who her doctor is and to ask for something stating this information on the doctors letterhead. I have told you guys about her messeges to us about how we were gonna get what we deserve. Well her messeges now have been saying that we are getting what is coming to us. I swear to God that if she is not pg and she is doing this to try to get back at him I will beat the shit out of her. I am so tired of her and her anticts. She is messing with the wrong people. I don't have much more self control left when it comes to her. She thinks I am gonna get what is coming to me? She is in for the wakening of her life! I mean if she is then she is and of course I would do what I need to do to support my Jaime. If she is not then the gloves are off and it is on. I am sure all of you are protctive of your closest friends like me. How would you feel?   Thanks for letting me vent. What is your take on this deal? Advice? I don't want any of you to think that I would do anything like this to her if she really is pg. I am not that stupid or cold. I just feel so angry right now.

Maybe getting someone elses opinion (Mike) will also help you to see that you are not a bad person.  Just wanted you to know you can feel safe to post here if you want.  No pressure.

There is nothing really to say that will make you feel better.  I think I have lost my ability to give any good advice.  So, basically this "post" is completely useless.  LOL!

      Hello, all!  Wow!  Laura, I have a lot of the same feelings that you do.  Maybe we just need to send more troops over there and just clean the place out.  Are we being too timid about the whole thing?  Don't get me wrong, I don't want unnecessary death.  I just think maybe we are letting the resistance get away with too much.  I could be wrong.  I am not there and I know nothing about what the military knows.  I really feel for the citizens that have to live through an unbearable life everyday and experience all of that death.  All of that pain.  Could you imagine a war on our soil?  It just seems incomprehensible.  Sometimes I just can't believe the world we live in.  We are all so messed up.    I am a basketcase who can't seem to get anything right.  I feel like I am wandering around in a fog.  Anyway, nobody wants to hear about that.  I am going to go to bed so I don't think anymore.

      This is a bit late but since I actually had someone mail me this disgusting video clip I felt it was time I commented on it.  I tried to be syphathetic to those who feel that the United States is the enemy and I have tried to look at it from both points even though I have also supported most of this war in Iraq and on terror.  But my understanding has drawn a line.  I don't feel compassion nor sorrow anymore.  Simply anger and disgust.  I felt it before I saw the video and I feel it even more now.  To think that we are trying to give these friggin people a chance at a life with freedom and the will to choose and some of them just can't get there heads out of the god damn asses for one fucking second.  It really pisses me off.  At this point, maybe we should just turn the damn country into a wasteland.  Put them out of their misery!!!  They don't support what has been done instead they hide behind their masks because they can't feel pride to show themselves when they commit these acts.  Makes sense to not feel pride about cutting some inocent mans head off.  Anyones for that matter.  I know in the back of my head that there are people in that counry who want us there and want and welcome our help but they need to take a stand as well.  If they can't by now then maybe we shouldn't bother either.  These people are fucked up.  It is like a cold blooded killer, you can only do so much to rehabilitate them.  We accept that they are screwed and leave their sorry asses in jail.  But since we obviously cannot jail all of Iraq maybe we should just wipe em out.  I know I don't really want to wipe em all out cuz there has to be good in order to bad there but I am so sick of this shit.  As far as using restraint in Iraq, to hell with that.  I also do not agree with what happened to those prisioners either.I am so disgusted right now.  My brother is leaving for the gulf on June 7th and I am scared and Iam angry.  I have grown cold to the situation and if someone came to me now and told me that the fate of Iraq is in my hands I would have to say drop the bomb.  end all of it.  Nothing wrong with a fresh start.  I know not all of you feel this way and that is ok, I can respect that.  I am just very angry right now so I am venting.  Kinda talking out loud.  My thoughts are coming faster than I can type so I don't even know what is all here.  i am gonna stop now though before I alienate all of you.  I hope you understand that this is mostly based on anger and fear.

      I know the extent of the stupid girl comment.  So I can sympathize with you, as far as men are concerned.  I don't know, each time I hang out with Jaime I realize more and more that we are not on the same page.  Maybe not in the same book.  Then nights like tonight happen and throw me for a whirl.  You know why I love him so much?  Cuz we can hang out, chill, do nothing, and still laugh about it.  I love that.  I am actually ok with being the friend zone.  Then again, I am not drunk either.  Lets see how I feel about it on my birthday.  June 4th.  Can't wait, gonna go up to Lake Geneva, rent a cottage for the night maybe the weekend, hang out with Sarah, Jaime, and whom ever else comes with.  Friday we are gonna hit the bars and then the strip club.  That should be good entertainment for the evening.  A drunk, straight girl hanging in a strip club.  I think it will be good!  Hell, yeah, I can party better than most.  I think pictures will be in order!!!!!  K, well I am babbling now,  I am out....

      So I was supposed to go out to dinner with this girl that I like and that I am really good friends with. I was really excited about it cause I don't get to see this girl much. I was also excited cause we were gonna go to dinner and then see a movie. It would be the closest thing to a real date that I had been on in awhile and it was gonna be a lot of fun. Well, she had told me that she would call me when she got out of school. When I didn't hear from her I got a little worried and called her to see what was going on. I couldn't get a hold of her, so I just said to hell with it and was gonna drive over and see what happened. Well, just as I was about to head out I get an IM from her saying that she felt bad but she had forgotten that she had already made plans and was going to have to cancel.   As mad as I was about the fact that she cancelled, I was equally mad about the fact that it took her so long to get a hold of me. If I hadn't double checked to make sure I knew where her house was I would have been over at her house.  so that's that.   I'm going camping this weekend. hopefully the weather doesn't suck the whole time.

      Cool new look for the blog!  I am liking it.  Mike, glad to know someone has already seen Van Helsing.  I think I am gonna go and see it with Sarah this week.  I am really looking forward to seeing it!  I am glad to be home but I am kinda missing Macomb.  Not the town itself but the people.  I hope that this summer will be much better than Christmas break cuz then I couldn't wait to get back.  Simply because  you get used to having people around you all the time and when I am home on break it just isn't the same.  If that made any kinda sense.    Did anyonw see the game today.  GO CUBS!!!!  WOO HOO Corey Patterson.  I am not real good with all the names and who did or does what but I did watch it from the 7th inning and was truly glued to the game from then on!  Survivor rocked.  Now the audiance (us) gets to vote for someone to win a million.  I really hope that Rupert gets it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Not to much more to say except I am still unpacking.  I hate moving!!!!

I also have met this guy online and we have been talking on the computer and the phone.  I know it is crazy but, what can you expect from me?>  I am nuts!  I am hoping on meeting him sometime in July.  Sarah and Monte are going to be good enough to go with me.  So that it will be safe as well as fun.  Maybe we will go to Dave and Busters or something like that.  Either way, I will keep you posted.  Is it Wednesday YET????

It was cute.  Thanks again Laura for burning those CD's for me.      So, I need to find a job.  I need money and something to do.  Looking for a job totally sucks ass!  Oh well!      My obsession with Vin Diesel and the Riddick character is not getting any better.  I think I have major problems with this.  I can't get enough of him.  I keep watching Pitch Black.  I need "Vin Diesel Lover's Anonymous".      I will stop blabbing now.  Later!

      If anyone wants to check out the band lineup here is the site.  Maybe you guys could come up here next summer cuz Summerfest is ALWAYS this good!   http://www.summerfest.com/home.php    So tonight totally kicked ass!!!!!!   I was sitting around and was pretty bored but felt like going out.  Summerfest in Milwaukee started today (Thursday) so I looked to see who was gonna be there tonight.  Seether was playing so I called Sarah and asked her if she wanted to go.  So we go and the place was packed.  Summerfest is like Taste of Chicago but instead of lots of good food there is lots of great bands!  We paid 12 to get into the park (pretty cheap).  Saw a few other bands who pretty much kicked butt too.  Then it came time for Seether to play.  For those of you who are unsure of who Seether is, they sing a song called "Broken" with the lead vocalist from Evanescence Amy Lee.  It is played alot on the radio.  Anyway, they rocked the stage.  They played for an hour and a half and left the stage.  They played stuff we have heard on the radio, off their current album and stuff that is off their upcoming album.  I knew they were gonna come back cuz they hadn't sung Broken (which also for those of you who don't know was originally released by just Seether singing the whole song).  So no one leaves, and I mean no one.  They finally come back out after relentless chanting from the crowd.  They sing a song and then say "Ok now this is the last song of the night.  It is a song we call Broken"  Then they start to rock.  They get through the first verse and, no shit, AMY LEE from EVANESCENCE comes out!!!!!  I almost fell over.  I looked at Sarah and was like "OMG, there she is, it's Amy Lee!!!"  They kicked ass!!!!  I couldn't believe it.  I was stunned but rocking away!  Damn, and to think I was gonna stay in tonight!   I can't wait until Wed.  when we go see Nickelback and Three Doors Down.!!!  We are talking about going to see Shinedown on July 3.  We are sure you we are gonna go see Three Days Grace on July 4th.  This next week or so is gonna kick ass!!!!!!!!

      Well, I went and hung out with Jaime tonight.  He is going through something and we talked about it a bit but I don't really know whets' up.  Then again, neither does he.  It was so good to see him though.  I forgot how much I missed him.  Things had felt so tense between us lately for various different reasons but tonight it was clear that things are fine.  It was just very reassuring to have us both reassuring each other about each other, if that made any sense.   I have not been feeling well myself.  I don't know what is up with me.  Tonight I almost didn't make it out of my house, I had to force myself to go.  I have been feeling like I did when I first came home 4 years ago.  I don't want to leave my house unless I have to.  I don't feel safe.  I know I have everyone around me but I have been feeling very vulnerable and a bit alone.  I am sure it is just a phase.  It will pass.  I am kinda nervous about it though.  I know my cycle of depression and it is about time for it to start creeping up.  It seems to be about every 5 years of so I get really depressed.  The problem in the past was that I didn't know it.  Since I know it now, I am trying to prevent it.  I don't know how well I am doing but I am trying.  I have been trying to convince myself that everything is fine and that I am fine but, I have not been doing too good a job with it.  I will fine eventually though be just not today.  So, sorry to dump all this in here.  Chops, it sure sounds like you are having a great time at the camp!  I bet you are great with the kids.  I know how you are and I am sure you are making things so much fun for them.  Glad your summer is really shaping up!  Sarah, I cannot wait until next Wednesday!!!!!!  I am so excited!  The concert is gonna kick ass!  I am looking forward to it and I just can tell you how much I am. BTW, Thanks for listening to me lately.  I know you have alot of your own stuff going on.  I know you will always be there for me as I will for you but I just wanted to say thanks anyway.   Well I am out.

      Hello, all!  How is everyone?  I am feeling pretty damn good today and for no specific reason.  Next week is the Nickelback concert with Laura.  It will be loads of fun.  And Monte will be coming home.  That silly guy.  Anyway, I don't really have anything important to say.  Later!

      Finally got an email from my brother today.  Not to much in it but he is doing ok and it was just good to know that he is alive and well.  He said they should be in the Gulf soon but he can't tell us exactly when for security reasons.  Well, that was all I had for now.  Just excited about that.  Later

      This is my rant for today.  Just kinda pissed off at todays events so here ya go.    What a bunch of f*cking cowards. Those Al Qaida bastards.  At least our men and women are not ashamed of what they are doing and are willing enough to show there faces and stand up for what they believe.  These people stand on tv all covered up.  So we can barely even see there eyes.  Give me a break.  I am so glad that I don't have the opportunity to ring there necks cuz I think I would make it slow and very painful.  VERY SLOW!!!!  I cannot only believe the disregard they have for Paul M. Johnson Jr., but also for his family who had to sit here and wait for today know he was going to die.  Those, damn it.  More and more each day I wonder what it is gonna take for people over there to wake the hell up and start doing something for themselves.  Don't they realize that they need to help us put a stop to this.  If they don't this is the shit they will eventually have running there countries.  If that is what they want then f'em I say.  I don't care anymore.  I am cold to their pain and need.  Anyone in, sympathetic, associated with or concerned for Al Quida should me shot, destroyed, abolished, killed, decimated and buried very deep!!!

      Sarah I know you love me and I love you too.  I think we just got our message's crossed and like we said earlier, I logged off to fast.  Kinda silly on my part.  I am glad to hear that you like spending so much time with me.  I just want to make sure you have time to yourself for you to grow and know you can make it on your own.  So that is what I meant by smothering you.  Wanting to make sure you still have your own space for yourself.  I, as well, will always be here for you.  I am just trying to make up for lost time in the past and for time we may lose when I head back to school.  Cuz that is gonna suck.  Chops, I am so glad to hear you are having such a blast! It really seems to suit you.  I can almost picture you with the little boy and the hat!!  You two must be so cute!

      Laura, I hope you realize if I knew you were upset I would have said something.  I did ask.  Also, I would have talked to you on the phone, I just won't call you after 10 at night.  You are not smothering me and you don't have to worry about any of that.  I am having a great time with you and want you to be happy, too.  If you ever need to talk just let me know.  You can call in the middle of the night or in the morning when I am asleep.  Just let me know you need to talk and I will wake up. Remember you are loved and I always want to help you if you need it.

      I have been in camp for two days and I am having a good time. I like my group, and I especially like the little kids that I work with in aftercamp. My little buddies from last year are back wanting to play ball, and it is amazing watching them improve. It's great because these two little kids just love playing ball. They seemed soo happy that I was willing to pitch to them this afternoon. The two little boys are named andrew and tommy. andrew is a huge cubs fan and he is the one that summer asked me if we could watch sportscenter cause he wanted to see the cubs highlights. yesterday he was wearing a brewers hat and I joked around with him about it. Today he walked by me at one point, and with a big grin on his face pointed towards the red C on his Cubs hat. I couldn't help but laugh. He is by far my favorite camper.

      No one wanted to talk and I was feeling like shit last night (although Sarah did ask me if I was ok and I told her yes only because I figured, well I don't know what the hell I was thinking).  Don't know why I was feeling so crummy cuz the day was great with Sarah.  Jaime didn't want to talk either, I actually asked him if we could talk and he was like "its' late, I don't want to, good night" and logged off.  Selfish ass.  Which made me feel even more like shit.  I know all of this was because I had taken to much of my medication and still couldn't sleep so I stayed up.  So instead of sitting here wailing about how no one loves me , yadda, yadda, yadda, (which I know is not true) I cracked out my art supplies and made this amazing piece.  I finally finished it around 5:00 am this morning.  Now I have to go and get some fixative at the art store.  All I have is the workable kind and I need to get the kind that freezes it so to speak.  I think I need to give my friends some room to breath right now.  I have been on the phone with Sarah once sometimes twice a day maybe even three times.  When I came home I felt like I needed to make up for not being here when all the things happened with Jim.  So I think it was kinda ok then.  Now I think she is getting stronger (and I am so proud of her) and I know she still needs me just not so...in her face.  I feel like I am smoothing her and maybe we need space so we don't grow apart from being so close.  If that makes any sense.  Jaime I don't know if he is just being an asshole or how I should perceive his actions.  When he was going through this whole thing with Melissa (I am referring to when she was saying she was pregnant and she really wasn't and when she was threatening both of us) he need me to be there for him all the time. I was the only one who knew what was going on, the only one he trusted with the truth.  Ever since we found out that she was really lying he has been distant and frankly cranky with me.   I have not seen him since then.  I didn't call him for a few days last week and it was like he panicked so he had to call and find out what I was doing and where I had been, like alot in detail.  It was just a weird conversation.  Then it was back to the crabby Jaime.  I don't know if he thinks I will put up with this or what.  I don't know if I am supposed to as a friend.  I just don't think it is right for him to be like this with me.  I was supposed to go over there last night to watch WWE with him.  He was gonna call me on his way home from work.  He totally blew me off.  So maybe he needs space too.  I don't think I am gonna call anyone for a few days unless something happens.  Everyone knows my number.  I just wanna give them the space that I think they might need cuz I love them so much.  I will still be posting on here so I will check and see how everyone is.    Chops, I am sorry to hear about your cell phone mishaps.  That kinda sucks.  I hope they get it straightend out soon.  By the way, when do you start that camp thing?  And if you started it already how is it going?  I know you will be in the DU house in the fall but I wish you were still on Tanner 13.  Just thought I would let you know that.  BTW in case I forgot to mention...Sarah and I saw Vin in Riddick!!!!  Good flick not to mention HOT!!  Yum, yum!  I am out for now...

        You belong in the land of darkness, otherwise known as one of the worlds in which I dwell. All here is beauty inspired by tragedy and great sorrow. Write or go through other creative outlets to express the anguish you may be feeling, and never let anyone tell you that you are just being 'weepy' or full of 'teenage angst'(if you're a teenager.If not, then they really should be punished for calling you one. They probably are trying to insult your maturity...fools.)and always remain yourself, dark and amazing. Never change.    urlLink   Where do you belong?(ANIME IMAGES)     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    Alright, that is just crazy.  I swear I am not full of sorrow and there are no tragedies to speak of.  Geez!  I answered a few questions about liking the color black and nighttime, all of a sudden I am tragic.  So silly!

        You belong in the world of leaves and trees, where the wilderness can claim your soul. Somewhere like a jungle or a thick wooded forest would be your world.

      So starting on Wed of next week I will be volunteering at a non-profit no kill animal shelter.  I think it will be a good experience and it will be for a good cause.  Not to mention it will look good on a resume (and no that is NOT why I am doing it).  I am excited about it.  The lady who runs it seems just as excited as I am.  She said she really needs people.  Things have been piling up in the office and she has had trouble keeping up with all the incoming pets.  Two of her other volunteers left on short notice due to problems with kids and school things so she is running low on people who want to help.  "Most people want money and we just can't pay".  I just want something to do with my time that I like.  Not to mention that since my mom won't let me get a pet at least I can play with them there! LOL  Well, hope everyone s good.  Talk more later...

        PASSIONATE LOVER. You love to love, always looking for a relationship. You cannot live without it. Your lover must be passionate  and you want that you and your partner melt into each other. He/She should not try to take the domination . You dont want a relationship without passion, and the sexuality plays a big part. The first moment you meet him/her is one of the most important. There has to be something between you , you cannot explain. From the first moment on everything must fix. But when this passion disappears you disappear to. For you it is better to leave than to see your love restrained.

      The camp sounds cool Chops!  I bet you will be good at it cuz it sounds right up your alley!  Today I dropped my summer class.  I am just not cut out for American government and Politics.  To much legal jargon for me.  Heck, I was gonna have to right a paper on Campaign Finance vs. Democracy in the United States Government.  Outlining the corruption of the whole thing. Showing the loop holes of the McCain bill of 2002.  Beats me.  Just not for me.  It's cool though.  I called today and may volunteer for a no kill animal shelter or Habitat for Humanity.  Either way it will be for a good cause, give me something to do, and give me a bit of exercise.    Well other than that things are cool here.  My brother left on Monday for the Gulf which pretty much sucks.  I have written him emails but I am sure he has been busy.  He will write back when he can.  I got the tickets for the concert to Nickelbck today which totally excited me!  I am out for now.  Hope all is well with you!

        LOVING ONE. You need  safety in your relationship. You want to  be sure in his/her arms, knowing that he will protect you and you can be totally devoted to your other. At this point you are very vulnerable. You open yourself and dont even think that he/she could cheat you. You totally trust your partner in every single way. SO if you find out that she/he lied to you or played a game this trust is broken. You may try to forgive your other but this will be very difficult.He/She has to be friendly and trustworthy.

        You're chocolate.  You're the old soul type, people feel that they have known you their entire life.  Many often open up to you for they view you as thoughtful and trustworthy.  Although people trust you, you have a hard time trusting them.  You prefer to keep your feelings bottled up inside, or display them very quietly.  It is alright to open up every once in a while.    urlLink   Which kind of candy are you?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla

      So I have to say thanks to all of you called, sent mail, text and instant messeges to me for my birthday! They meant a whole lot more than I can express here!!! I had an amazing time. Turned out to be Sarah, Jaime, and myself. I rented a cottage for the night in Lake Geneva, WI. We went up there and hung out a bit before going out to the bar.  Sarah and Jaime bothe got me these amazing charms for my braclet, so I can think of them both each time I wear it!  Sarah also got me the little Calorie book which is amazing!  Here parents were so cool as well by tossing in a cake we were to crazy to not eat (but it sounds like they are enjoying it know). The bars up there were kinda cool. We went to Champs, which is a sports bar but I really liked it. They have a whole other bar outside. It was nice to be outside. Kinda reminded me of having a drink on the back porch. Then we went to Thumbs Up. That place was kinda cool too. The music was cool, then not, then cool. Overall I liked it. We tried Hogs and Kisses but they were to packed so we headed back to Champs and had a few more before hitting the store for some crash food. Went back to the cottage had a pizza and talked for awhile then crashed. I really had a great time!  I was so happy to spend time with them!  I cannot forget to thenk Monte for all he did.  He wasn't able to come out with us that night but he did make it able for me to get the tickets to the Nickelback concert!  So to all of you, I love you very much and my life would not be the same without you.  Thanks for being so good to me!

      So yup, I did it!  Sarah and I went and got my tattoo today.  I love it and surprisingly it didn't hurt like hell.  Maybe because I have already experienced that kinda pain.  Although there were some spots where I thought the artist may have fallen into my skin with a huge piercing knife.  However, she did not.  Nancy from Black Dragon (where I usually go to)  did this one and she did a great job!  I am loving it.  I gotta stop getting things on my back though cuz I can't see it!  Well, my neck is crying for some lotion so I am off!   I hope everyone is having as good a summer as I am.  Not sure if I told ya but we got the tickets to Nickelback/Three Doors Down on June 30.  Sarah and I are gonna go.  They are playing at Summerfest in Milwaukee.  I think it is gonna be tons of fun!

      Hello, everyone!  My ex husband is a major loser and asshole.  It is now June and he still owes me a payment for May.  I can't even imagine when I will receive the June payment.  Even with all the heartache, everyday I realize a little more that I am so glad I am not with him.  Most times were a nightmare.    So, I am counting down to Friday.  I think it is some kind of special day, but I can't remember why.(LOL!)  Just kidding!  We are going to have a great night for Laura's birthday.  Well, gotta go. My sister just got here.  Later!

         Hello, all!&nbsp; Mike, I know what you mean.&nbsp; My father grew up in the city and is a die hard Cubs fan.&nbsp; I think it is an obsession.&nbsp; He is 65 years old and has been waiting all his life for the Cubs to win the World Series.&nbsp; He raised me and my 5 siblings to be Cubs fans.&nbsp; But with 6 kids you will get at least one who wants to be difficult.&nbsp; I have one&nbsp;brother who likes to argue with my dad that&nbsp;he prefers the Sox.&nbsp; It is more of just a fun little battle between the two of them.&nbsp; I am not a huge baseball junkie, but I was taught well and&nbsp;always support the Cubs.

       As I watched the Cubs lose their second straight to the Cardinals today and their 3rd in a row overall a thought crossed my mind...Why in god's name is my father still a Cubs fan? He is 47 years old, and in his life time the Cubs have never been to the World Series. Come to think of it, sweet home Chicago hasn't been to a world series since he was a wee lad at the age of 3. Anyways, I looked at the Cubs history. Since my father was born, they have finished an average of 19.5 games out of first place and have only finished above .500 13 times, with quite a few of those being those Cubs teams of the late '60's and early '70's. It does explain why he doesn't get as crazy as me and Timmy. He doesn't hit the high's or lows, but maintains a happy medium. All these years of cheering for the Cubs has left the man emotionally dead. Furthermore, he has raised me and Timmy as Cubs fans and has assured us a similiar life unless someday they finally win the damn thing.    Anyways....Cubs are 10 games out of 1st in the NL Central and 3 back in the wild card race if San Francisco wins tonight.....if you are religious now would be a good time to start praying, otherwise it may be Wait Till Next Year really soon.

      I suppose I should probably finally say what I thought of the  Director's Cut. It was certainly a different way of ending the movie. I  liked the director's cut. I really enjoyed the scenes that they put  into the movie and I felt the ending was well done. The big thing with  the ending is that it fits the tone of the movie better. The movie is  very depressing, and the original ending seemed too perfect. I also  like the way that the new ending suggests that those two other  stillborn babies were perhaps others who came to the same conclusion as  evan. as i said, a very sad ending, but neccesary.

      Chops, I did finally see the extended directors cut of the movie and I thought the extra stuff in the movie was cool but I thought the new ending sucked!  I preferred the original theatrical version better.  If it had been up to me I would have taken all the extra stuff that was added into the movie for the directors cut, except the baby in the womb thing, left the ending the way it was and made that the movie.  BUT...that is just my opinion.  I got to hang out with Sarah and Monte last night and that was nice.  It was good to see him since I hadn't seen him since he left for Oklahoma.  He brought us back these amazing postcards from there.  I love em, but then again I have this thing with collecting postcards.  Either way, it was really good to see him since I missed him while he was gone.  It was weird to go from talking to him everyday to barely talking to him while he was away so I am glad he is back.  So things here are good.  I am doing good.  Life is good.  No real dire complaints.  The world is not coming to an end or anything.  I am looking forward to August since there will be tons going on.  I am hoping that the first weekend in August - Sarah, Monte, and I can go out for his birthday.  I think it will be nice and fun since he doesn't really do much of that kinda stuff.  Then the next weekend Rachana and I are going to Sheila's wedding in Jacksonville (yup all the way down by WIU).  We will get back from that on Sunday the 15th and I will leave on Thursday the 19th for WIU move in crew.  Then on the 23 it back to the grind with classes.

      Hello!  So, Laura and I went to see Spiderman 2 today with my niece & nephew.  It was really good.  Laura then left, but the rest of us played lots of video games in the arcade for awhile.  It was a day of careless fun.  I want to be Spiderwoman with the cool web thing.  Oh, well that is pretty much it.  Bye!

      Anyone got any good questionaires or quizes?  We could use some!  Chops, what a day!  Sounds crazy but fun at the same time.  I am sure you still had a blast, rain and all.  I do think that thing with the daughter is kinda bazar.    Well, my weekend turned out pretty boring.  The weather was not working for us on Saturday so we decided to just hang in.  Then by the time Sunday came around I was not feeling good at all.  I am still not up to par.  Maybe the flu, who knows.  All I know is I felt like crap.  I am feeling better today just not 100% yet.  Not to much more to say at this point other than I know the blog has been acting up.  I reposted the whole thing and it didn't fix it but at least it posted everything that was out there!  Later taters!!!

      July 3rd  Here's my story: I had gone down to Wrigley with a group of people to see the Cubs - Sox game. We got down there at about 9 for a 12:20 start and got in line to get standing room only. By the time that we got there, the line was pretty long but  we remained optimistic. After a half-hour we finally got to the front of the line. I happily slapped my money down on the counter to get my ticket. At this point the lady checked her computer and said, "We are sold out." I was absolutely shocked. They had like 6 lines going to get tickets, and some of my friends who had been sent to other lines shortly before me got tickets. The way it worked out was: 3 people got tickets and 2 didn't. Part of the problem was that they sold fewer standing room only tickets. Anyways, the most frustrating part of all off this is that while we were waiting in line, a guy offered us 4 bleacher seats at face value. We had a group of 5. IF we had only had 4 people we would have been able to purchase those tickets and enjoy our first game from the bleachers. After my brother and his two friends got tickets, my friend and I walked around the neighborhood trying to get something to work but were unable to. (Tickets were going for anywhere from 50 - 400 dollars a piece) After awhile, my brother and his friends went into Wrigley and me and my friend sat out on Waveland hoping to catch a homerun ball. Well, in the bottom of the first a Moises Alou HR ball went out onto Waveland and this guy about 15 feet away from us caught it on a fly. Had there been a bounce I may have had a chance.    Now, sitting out on Waveland you meet some interesting people....There was this one guy running around with a homemade shirt that said GO CUBS on the front and SOX SUCK on the back. He was missing a few teeth and the ones that he did have were crooked. We also met these two brothers from Oak Lawn, they were kinda cool, but I gave the one guy my number, cause he wanted to be able to meet up at another cubs game this summer, and he called me like 5 times last night. Because of the rain delays we ran down to the fire station and hung out with the fire department guys for a little bit. Some really good people down there. I was very thankful for the hospitality during those rain delays.   The strangest part of the day came in about the second inning. Now there was a family by us. You had the dad, the mom, and the daughter. The daughter was pretty cute. She was wearing this little Cubs jersey and was looking pretty good. She also had a happy birthday sign for Moises Alou (apparently she had met him) Well, this guy walks past from the bar. He says he has just won 2 tickets to the game and wants someone to go with him and will give the ticket for free. Now keep in mind that the girl is about 18 (she had told me that she was gonna be a freshman at Indiana-Bloomington) and this guy was probably in his late 20's. This girl is jumping all over the place with the biggest grin on her face. Well, the parents let her go in.... I ask you this: If you were those parents would you have made that decision? Seemed rather odd to me.   Anyways...that was my day. I woke up early and waited for tickets. Didn't get tickets. Got soaked in the rain. Met good people. Most importantly though, the Cubs won    GO CUBS!!!!

      Hello, all!  How is everyone doing?  Good, I hope.    So, it is July 3rd and I just got June's payment from my ex.  They are supposed to come by the 1st of each month.  I probably won't get July's payment until August.  He is so small and selfish.  And I can't figure out if he is a loser or just plain mean.  Maybe he is both.  Yes!  Anyway, enough of that.  Laura and I didn't get to go to Summerfest today like we planned because of the weather.  Hopefully, we won't miss tomorrow.  Couldn't the rain just hold off until Monday or Tuesday.  Of course, by Monday it is forecasted to be sunny.  We will see.   Later!

      Chops,  I can't wait to go see the movie!  I have heard that it is really good and now that you have given it your stamp of approval it must be worth it.  I HATE when people talk during movies.  Those runts behind you would have been kicked out cuz I would have bitched until they shut up.  People who go to a movie and talk during it?  I just don't get it.  But anyone who knows me knows that is one of my huge pet peeves.  BTW - The Butterfly Effect comes out on DVD and Video next Tuesday (July 6th)!!!!  I guess that added a new ending and lost of new stuff to the DVD (like they always do).  I am looking forward to that too.  So, next Tuesday I will be sitting here watching it!!!!!!

      Just got home from the Nickelback/Three Doors Down concert and may I say IT KICKED ASS!!!!!!  It turned out to be totally sold out!  Both bands rocked.  I would see either one again.  Thornley opened for them and I really liked them to so I think I am gonna go pick up there album.  I just don't know what to say other than I have totally lost my voice, I had an awesome time, the concert rocked, and I now I can't wait until Saturday to go see Soil and Shinedown.  Then Sunday to see Three Days Grace!!!!  Well, I am off to bed, I am sore and pooped.  Later...

I yelled at them at one point but they were still annoying after that. needless to say they got out of the theater pretty quick after the credits started.

      FOOTBALL, FOOTBALL, FOOTBALL: I am such a meathead. Redskins 20 - Broncos 17  Ain't preseason great. Good game too. Tied 17-17 in the last 3 seconds and then they barely (looked like by about an inch, maybe) made a field goal to get the win.  All I know is that I am looking forward to some great Monday night games and we know Sundays are always good!!!! So what if I yell obscenities at my television, it's ok during football season, right? hehe  Talk to ya'll later...

      I apologize for not socializing on the board as much this summer. Truth be told, I really haven't been that social in general. I lead a dull life and have nothing of real interest to put on here.  My Uncle did have is wedding last weekend.  That was very fun. I was an usher and got to wear a tux (I LOVE WEARING TUXES) There were no women my age at the reception so I just sat back and had a few drinks. It was a good time.  Tommorrow I am going to the Cubs game with a friend of mine who has never been inside Wrigley. I can't wait to see the look on her face when she sees the beauty of Wrigley. Anyways...hope you guys are enjoying your summer.  TTYL

      So I just got a new computer. Loving it now that everything is set up and working the right way. How come shit has to be such a pain in the ass. And I know that I shouldn't have worded that the way I did because Shit is always a Pain in the Ass but you know what I mean...  Only a week and a half until I am off to WIU. Woo-Hoo!!! I miss school but I know I am gonna miss my friends here once I leave. I am trying not to think about that now though. So I guess they can expect lots of phone calls once I get settled in.  Sarah, I am so proud of you for going back to school. I know that this is going to change things for you and I think it will be all for the good. You will succeed because you want to and because you deserve to. I have the utmost faith in you and I will be here for you along the way. I will support you with EVERY decision you make for yourself and your future (interjecting my concerns of course, duh), whether it be about school, love, or life. The best for you is yet to come...  Chops, where the hell are you? How the heck are you? What are you doing? Are you looking forward to getting back to the DU house? When are you heading back? We miss you here!!!!  Well, I am out for now. More later. Later Taters

         Hello, all! I am very proud of you Laura. You stuck up for yourself and are not letting Chris mess with you. You should never let anyone try to change you. You are special and great the way you are. You should love yourself for who you are because I do. He is no one to judge or criticize anyone. People like that must really have a problem with themselves to be so negative and judgmental. You do not need that crap. Thanks for the encouraging words. I really appreciate it. It does mean a lot to me. You are definitely an inspiration to me. You have done so great with school. I hope to do as well.

       I deleted the solar system thingy cuz i was messing up all the posts after it.   I have never had anything mess it up like that but no biggie.  I did like it though.  Sorry, hope I am forgiven!!!   So, I finally start dating again and I have come to the conclusion that the first one is a dud! I should be happy though because he "showed me his real cards" early in the game. Although he hide things in what he says thinking that I must be stupid and won't pick up on them or something. DUH, NOT!!! Here's an example:  We were talking about things that may have seemed a bit off between us and if we felt they were things we could work on. He says to me that my hair isn't long enough, but I can grow it. That he really likes me and feels safe a good with me. That he really feels this is gonna work out. Then tells me that he knows I am already working on my weight so that will be changing. Then says that once that is all done things should be good.  Good, WTF. So let me get this straight the way I am now is "ok" but not really what he wants. The way I will be once I am done losing the weight and grow my hair long will be perferct because that is what he is looking for. No offense but I know what I am gonna look like and it will be what alot of guys will be looking for. Jackass. He also takes the time to make a few insulting comments to me about my friends (which lets me know that he may not really like them). He was not all that pleased with my response concerning that. HE doesn't feel he needs to improve on his life. He is renting a house with 2 other guys and is hoping his dad may help him out to buy it. HE IS 36 for crying out loud. When I ask him if he wants to go back to school he says no, that he doesn't like school and therefore doesn't see the need for it, especially since he has a good job now. I suppose it maybe a good job, it probably is. However, it is not enough to pay the bills or much less support him on his own. He tells me that it is not important to support himself because when he finds someone there will be 2 incomes. Yeah, I suppose but one of them will not be mine.  See, at first I thought all of these things were bothering me because I was scared to be in a relationship, to get back out there and date again. It had been so long for me. Now that I have talked to my friends about it, it is clear that these things should bother me. I don't want to end up in a shithole relationship again. Not to mention that I don't ever want to date someone who doesn't want me hanging out with or at my friends. I am not gonna drop my friends for any guy again and while Chris didn't ask me to do this he made it clear that my time should be with him and not them. So in the words of my friend Shane, "I think it is time to toss this fish back!"  So that has been my saga as of late. Still not sure how to do this or why I feel bad about it. I suppose that will pass in time.   SARAH , I want to make sure I keep telling you how proud I am of you! You are gonna go back to college! You are doing something for yourself not for anyone else so make sure to enjoy it. It will be work but I know you are strong and you will succeed. You deserve this chance and I know you will excel!!!!! CONGRATULATIONS you fellow college goer.   CHOPS,  Just think only 2 weeks left. I sometimes feel like it couldn't come soon enough! I am really looking forward to getting back to WIU. I know we keep missing each other on here but I want you to know you are in my thoughts on a regular basis and I miss you tons! I can't wait for us to get to hang out and catch up!!!!  Well thats all for now. TTYL
