          !Hola!  This is for all you U of A Students that know Lauren.  What?, Did you not belive that I exist?  Are you crazy?  Yes, I know Lauren is, but that was not the Question.  The pictures are real, I promise she did not cut them out of magazens.  Well, I can't promise you about all the pictures of "friends" she has, but the ones of her and myself are La-Jit.  (Oh and if they look to real, she probably hired them.) Come back to me my love, they don't deserve you!   Not to worry, you will be back in a few months.  So what is happining in the desert these days? Getting a nice tan?  Dont forget that that pretty color leads to ugly rinckles at an early age.  I know not everyone can have a beautyful natural color like me.  =)   Any one see the Rob Zombie movie (House of 1000 Corpses)?  My brother has been trying to drag me to go see that.  It's not that I don't want to, it's just that I have to work during the week, AT MY NEW JOB!!! (thanks to Lauren and her mom).  Yay!  So he will just have to wait till the weekend.  So Lauren told me to check out her new blog thing, so i did, and then I thought, since we can't talk all the time, maybe i can talk to her through this. Oh, and all you other strange people too.  Welp.... Later!

       Well, my brother has been in Basic for about FIVE weeks.  I miss him so much.  This is not fun, living at home, with mom and dad, and no Matt!  Well, this is life.  Lauren is coming home!!!!  I can't believe it.  It has been a long year.  This weekend is Memorial Day Weekend.  I REALLY want to get out of town.  Drive away and camp out.  Go to the beach.  Play in the sand. SOMETHING!!!  We'll see.  Let the sun kiss my skin.  I really dont like being inside all day long, I'm so not used to it.  But, don't get me wrong, I love my job.  I'm GOING to do something, even if I have to take drastic measures.

       "This is the story" as my nephew would say.   Why are people so stupid??? I guess that is the ultimate question.  The world may never know. We pull into the Starbucks parking lot; I know you all know it.  I got out of the car and there it was, the blue “Trail Blazer” with two kids (that I could see) sitting in the car, with keys in and the motor running.  I look over to Mathew and Lauren, “lets get in and move it, maybe that will teach them a lesson.”  Ok…I did not move it but as I looked inside the shop I noticed that nether of the women turned, at all, not even once.  So I start to get more and more angry. “WTF?”  “No no, tell me this is not happening.”  So as we walk in and there they are. My heart is racing SO fast I ask Matthew to feel my chest to see how fast it is.  “Wow” Matthew says.  As Steph runs to the bathroom (missing half of the show) I ask if that “blazer” belongs to anyone. Lady…no I can’t even call them that, does not even fit in the category…Witch #1: Yea that is my “Trail Blazer”. What about it?  Me: Oh I just wanted to know which one of you was the ignorant one. As she got this horrible look on her face, which probably was not to hard for her to do, she starts going off on me saying how “It is none of my business; I should keep my nose out of things I know nothing about; how she saw me pull up; how there was a thirteen year old in there; blah blah blah.”  Sorry!!!! No excuse B****!  Thinking that only, I told her how it was my business and if some man decides to jump in the car and abduct her children in the car that she would then call the cops and cry and want everyone to help her because of her stupidity. No thirteen-year old is going to jump someone who has just stolen their mother’s car, with them in it. So sorry lady, bad back up. Then her friend jumps in (Witch #2) and tries “tries” to help her friend out by telling me off too. At this time Lauren is trying to calm me down and Matthew is explaining the same things I’m saying to them. Mature…really mature. Man, I want to grow up, so I can be a mature adult just like them!!! Woooo hoooo!  So as they grab their skank drinks and head back out to there “Trail Blazer”. #1 mumbles something under her breath. OH NO SHE DID NOT!!!! “Why don’t you say what you have to say to my face!”? Still mumbling under her breath to me she walks to the car and as she get there starts to yell back at me as Witch #2 is still standing there with the door open telling me to come out there.  Stupid stupid people.  I cant remember much of what was said, but I know it was a lot, adrenalin was pumping and I still had no clue what was going on around me. The as they both go to the car I grab some paper and with hands shaking I write down the license plate #. All I remember is Matthew telling me that is not worth it and Lauren holding me back.  Scary, just scary. As they are getting in the car Matthew is calling the cops and gives them the license number.  They say they are sending an officer over. Cop comes over and we tell him what went down.  “Oh I just wish they were still here, I love it when I can chat with people like that and tear them a new one.” “Sorry I cant do much about it now, but it will be on her record” “ You did a great thing” Sweet, I think I love cops again. “tear them a new one”  I will have to use that more often.  Steph heads out before the cop gets there and I tell her what happened later. So off we go, another wonderful night in Fayettenam. Take Lauren home and hugs all around.  So what did I get out of it you ask?? WELL, Matthew calls me about 30 minutes later and tells me “You will not believe this” “The Officer just called me back  (had his number from the 911 call) and they just got pulled over for speeding on 92 on there way to Griffin”  “HA HA HA!!!” I say. He also says “As the cop hears this on the radio, he puts in a call to do a full car search on them” Even Better!!  Well, I guess Karma does work.  What goes around comes around.  So what is the moral of the story??? Don’t leave your children (or pets) in the car, especially when Sarah is in town.  Man, what a night. I think she will remember this night too. But I really don’t think she learned a lesson.  Oh well, she has a record. Teehee. Oh and “The Day After Tomorrow” was a good movie, I guess I liked it so much because it could really happen.  Hrm…maybe everyone should think about that. Remember! Sarah is watching…you bes recycle.  Man, I crack myself up. I love my Friends...thanks for sticking by me.

       No electricity from 6pm last night to about 3am this morning… everything in the fridge is ruined.  So unless my dad really wanted to clean it, that is what I will be up to this weekend, cleaning the fridge out.  Man that is a lot of food; I hate to throw it all away.  Kind of makes me sick, knowing no one can ever eat that stuff, and there are so many hungry people out there. When I went to bed I left the window open and the bush I have outside my window is in bloom so I had the best smells to fall asleep to.  It would have been nice if I, at least, had a fan.  It was a little warm.  I did not really mind having no AC. Most likely it was the waterline workers that cut the power, but the retarded people that they are stayed out in front of my house, playing with the power box.  Not only with the diesel truck running with the lights on and digging up something, they also had to have the strobe light on.  What, is it “Disco Night” and I did not get the memo? Needless to say I did not get much sleep.  Got up about 7 something and then Ashley called, good thing she did, I may have fallen back to la la land. So Matthew went to San Diego yesterday and he said the weather is wonderful.  Ha ha, of course!  I called my Grandmother and cousin Andrew and let them both know that I gave him both their numbers.  He went over to my grandparent’s house and had dinner and checked out all my grandma’s plants (what a plant nerd).  I won’t say too much because I can’t remember everything he told me, but most likely he will put it all in his journal.  Man, I miss him.  Lauren is heading back to Arizona this weekend and my mom and dad have a class to go to. I still have not figured out what I’m going to do.  Oh yea, clean the fridge…yay! Amber is listening to Margaret Cho.  She is the bomb. (Oh, can I not say bomb? BOMB, BOMB, BOMB, BOMB, BOMB, BOMB, BOMB, BOMB, BOMB!) Sorry, I like Ben Stiller.  If you have never listened to her you should check out her stand up.  I remember the first time I ever saw her was middle school, some friends of mine told me about her and that they had recorded her.  So I checked it out. Oh and then the show was ok, I think I saw ever episode…I’m such a dork.

       So, I have been sick. Yes, yes, this is true.  So I guess I need to catch everyone up on last weekend.  I went to North Carolina with Matthew and his family (they are a crazy bunch, and the only way I would know that, is that my family is just the same). Man it was great. I needed to get away. And there was no DRAMA!!! Can you believe it?  I did not get into a confrontation with anyone or get the cops involved. Ha ha ha!  Drove up there on the 17th and caught the ferry Friday morning.  Slept through the 2 plus hour ferry ride. Got to Ocracoke and went to the beach, did not think I was going to be out long, and I got a little burnt.  Stupid Sarah, but they are all better now, just a funny tan line on my shoulders. I enjoyed great food and great weather even the thunderstorm was great.  Rained a little but it was not enough to ruin my vacation.  Got to watch crazy drunk people which is always fun. And of course I have to say I enjoyed hanging out with Miss Hailey, she is so smart for a 5 year old.  Matthew built this wood rack for the kayaks for his truck. And at first I had doubts, but it came out great and it was the best 30 dollars anyone has ever spent on a rack (as apposed to dishing out $400). I will have to find a picture. Boys are smarter than I thought. Who’d a thunk it?  Just kidding I love you!!!!!! =) That Sunday his family caught the ferry around noon and ours was not until 4, so to save time, we thought it would be fun to instead drive up the islands and check out all the lighthouses It was a lot better than waiting till 4 and then 2plus hours for the ferry. A little bit more driving but we made it back earlier than if we waited. I was totally worth it. And I still go to enjoy a ferry ride; we had to take a short one from one island to another. That is the story for now. Check out the pictures!

       I got to see Ashley last night.  Man it has been too long, and she does not even live far. The only thing I can’t deal with is the traffic (oh and my lesbian car sucks).  So I hung out at the Baena's last night.  Fish sticks and tomatoes for dinner.  It was fun and I got to give her the glass thing I got her from NC. It is a pretty glass disk that you can hang in the window, and it has a Celtic symbol on it. Very pretty. She showed me all the pictures that she has had from the past couple weeks and a great one with her hair. So I thought I should put that one in.  Teehee.  She liked it so it is ok that I show it, and even if it was not ok, I probably still would. Ha ha ha ha! We talked about tattoos and what the heck we are doing this weekend.  No plans still to this moment.  My Uncle Ben’s Birthday is coming up. Number 29. He is still a baby. Teehee. Joey tries to joke about it but he is already 30, so it is not that funny.  He is and always will be the old man, he he. I love you uncle Joey!! They are having a get-together on the 17th at their new house.  I’m excited. And yes I told Joey that Lauren was going to be in town. “Hey you...of course you can bring Lauren along.  We like her lots ;-)” So his words.  Going to Braves vs Marlins game tonight with Matthew.  Hot date to-night! Oooowww!  It is supposed to rain. Who cares!!!!  That may make it more fun. Ha! Oh and Michael just came by and said that I had to come meet his friend because “people say he is hot”. I guess Michael can’t say it himself.  BOYS!!! They are so weird.  Oh yea, I know you all are waiting with antici…………………………………..pation ….he was cute =) Had to throw that Rocky Horror quote for you guys out there. Back to work I go!!!

       The game was fun last night. The rain stopped just after we got to the stadium and they "played ball". The Bravos totally kicked butt in the first inning. Already with six runs there was not much of a game after that. But a great time was had by…me.  I know I know, it is not the Padres, or in Matthews case, the Cubbies.  But we had fun.  There was this kid who sat next to me, he was a cut. “Boooooooo boooooooo, Marlins suck” and he was only like 7. Ha ha!  Of course you know me I can’t help but talk to kids. So there were three odd girls sitting in front of us and were dancing (if you want to call it that) to every song that came on.  I looked over at the kid and asked him what they were doing, “idiot stuff” he replied. Man, I was rolling, he cracked me up so much.  He said it so as “a matter of fact”. There was also a group of people, all with babies, I guess it was a maternity class that all kept in touch and hung out. Bunch of babies, but well behaved might I add.  On the way home both driving in out designated vehicles, a man came up to my hind bumper on GA 85 heading to Senoia.  As he rode upon me, which I don’t prefer people to do, I taped my break. Ha ha, you should not be driving like that, especially at night.  They decided that they wanted to flash me with there brights and continued to ride my tail. What a Jerk!  So when I knew we would be coming up to a passing lane I did not speed up like most people do, I just called Matthew and told him what was going on.  So he let them get in front of him too (Matthew rides in front of me at night so I don’t hit deer), and there go Matthew’s bright lights.  Well, it was not me!! What? What? As we came up to GA 16 he turned into the Chevron and proceeded to walk into the gas station. Matthew followed.  Afraid that something would go down I also walked in (he is known to freely speak his mind, Iike a certain other I know. Hrm, who might that be?). As the guy walked out and drove off, I continued to ask Matthew what he said to him, and this is his story…the dude walked in and went towards the beer and grabbed the handle and they were locked, oh darn, looked over at the lady at the register (the whole time trying to avoid Matt’s glair) “You stop selling beer at 12?” “11:45 every night”.  Matthew said that he walked right out and that was enough punishment for him. That is what you get for riding someone’s ass in the middle of the night to get beer. =P Poo poo head.  Thank goodness for no confrontations.

       "A Damn Good Actor". Remember Marlon Brando. What a life that man had. And remember he was like us. Not just an actor, a life in which a lot of us don’t quite understand, but a person who lived for things he believed in. Yea, he had the money.   "Hollywood is ruled by fear and love of money,” "But it can't rule me because I'm not afraid of anything and I don't love money."  I‘d have to say that my most favorite was "Guys and Dolls". To see this tough man get up there and sing his heart out, man oh man. Every time I think of Luck, I will think of that song. "luck if you’ve ever been a lady to begin with, luck be a lady with me." Ok I got off the topic.  A life of ups and downs.  I can’t say I know him on a personal level or agree with everything he believes, but I find his strength and willing to stick to his guns admirable.   urlLink    RIP&nbsp; urlLink     Peace Brando
