Ok, now to the Daily Buzz....today, I started moving things out of my room b/c my new carpet is comming on Monday! yeah! How exciting!! LOL&nbsp;Then I had to do chores, and then I sat around for a while, went on Yahoo, talked to a few people, and then did nothing for a while. But at like 3:30, I had to paint one of our window panes on the house! :( boring!!! That is gonna take me about 2 1/2 hours (lol...im not done yet, im having a break right now...inbetween the first and second coat!)! Then at 7:00 im gonna watch North Shore! yippeee!!! Well, i hope your day was more exciting than mine!! have a lovely rest of the day! hehe

        So, yesterday was Jordan Schlicks birthday and she had a bday party. She invited Ashley Swenson, Sam Peterson, Maggie Jasper, Anna Rhuland, and Amanda Hagen. Haley had me come over because she didn't want to be with all Jordan's friends by herself. We all hung out and at supper and at 6:00 we went to the pool. We had fun there and saw a few people we knew. When we got home we played "hide-and-seek", but it wasn't your ordinary hide-and-seek. 1 person would hide, and then the rest of us would wait 2-4 min, and then we would all go out and try and find her. When ever u found the person that was hiding, you had to sit next to her and wait for the others to find her too. The last person to sit down had the hide! I wasn't very good at this game...i was the last person to find the hider twice. sad sad sad....oh well! Haley hid for me one time! But i was good at hiding! Actually i was very good! lol! After we finished that, we watched the movie Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen, I guess it was pretty good. Oh yeah, earlier, we watched Bubble Boy! Man, that movie is FUNNY!!! So after we did that, Haley and I went to bed and the other girlies stayed up till around 1:30 or so. I guess that over night, Haley said that i started laughing, and then around 8:30, I was like hugging her! She figured i was having a dream about Zach...I dunno, i might have been but i don't remember! hahaha...good times, good times! Oh yeah, yesterday was my half-birthday! HAPPY 13 1/2 BIRTHDAY TO ME!!!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;OK, I don't know about u, but i can't wait till school starts! Not the learning part or anything, but just to c my friends!!!! ok well i gtg ttyl bye     &nbsp;    &nbsp;    &nbsp;    &nbsp;    &nbsp;

       Hey everyone! I found out about this thing from my cuz in Minn. It looked like a cool way to keep in touch with everyone rather than waiting for them to get on Yahoo so u could ask them how their day went, if u really cared! lol! I don't know about u, but it gets kind of sickning having to tell every single person on Yahoo what u did that day, so I hope that this will be a lot easier. Plus, when ur really mad or sad or happy, u can tell everyone why on here, rather than on ur stat, or whatever other way u do it. So every day, or any time u wanna, u can write what u did today, something u found out, some gossip!, what ever u wanna do! I hope everyone will use this cuz its really cool! oh yeah, u can write comments about other peoples blogs, and i think, I THINK, u can have like&nbsp;a whole group thing or something, but i havn't gotten that far yet, so i will check it out, and tell everyone l8r! ttyl!!! bye!!!!!
