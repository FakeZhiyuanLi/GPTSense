      We all can breathe a sigh of relief by tomorrow. Final papers are due and its over!  Its been a very stressful, strenuous, taxing and challenging year for everyone on the BVC. This has been the most challenging course I’ve undertaken and I’m quite happy its finally over.  However, having said that, it was also one of the most enjoyable course I’ve taken. (aside from French)  I’ve been pushed to do things and not slack throughout the year. Its true what the lecturers told us in the beginning, that this is going to take over our lives for the next 9 months.  I’ve had little time for anything else; friends, social life, etc. I found myself coming home from classes and studying or starting on the next subject’s homework. I’ve literally turned into a Nerd! And you know what? Its not that difficult to put a little more effort into what we have to do. After all, what is 9 months compared to your whole life?  I must admit, its never been smooth sailing the whole way. I may look ok on the outside, but inside, I am a wreck! I’ve had a few nervous breakdowns this year alone!  Maybe it was tougher this year coz I’ve always been ‘spoon fed’ all my life and now I have to do it all on my own. Don’t ask me how I got my law degree, coz I have no idea what I was doing… Ok, this is not gonna be too good on my CV!  Some people say that I must be smart to come all this way in something I don’t like. But I think its ‘guilt’ that really drives me. I feel I owe my parents something for spending so much money on my education and I should be grateful, for not everyone is as lucky as I am. They want me to be successful and live comfortably in the future and I don’t see anything wrong with that.  Studies aside, what I really enjoyed this year is meeting friends that I’ve made throughout the year. I feel very lucky to have these people as my friends, just as I thought I’d never find good friends that easily. I know this is very cliché, but I really thank God I’ve found them. And I am so grateful to those who have been by my side when I needed them most.  Its not been an easy year for me, emotionally. But I always could talk to someone about my problems and whatever happens, I know they’ll always be there for me and never let me feel alone.  I am really going to miss them all when I leave.  Some of my friends have left already and although I don’t feel it yet, but its gonna hit me in a few weeks. But I’ve always been optimistic about life, and I know somehow, someday I’ll see them again.  We might not grow old together, but I’ll always know there’s someone out there I can count on, and they on me.  I am really looking forward to going home to Penang. I miss the lifestyle and food, But it will be very difficult to fit in again. I’ve lost contact with a lot of my friends back home, but I know that I will be fine.  I never really believed people who tell me that University life is the best. But now, I CONCUR!  I’m just feeling all melancholie now. I want to go back, but I don’t want to leave my friends. I realise that I don’t have to have 1000 friends, just a handful that really matter to me.  I just want to give a shoutout to my dear friends that I’ve met here and will miss a lot when we all part.  Madelene Tan(I’ll c u back home, right?) Jenny Liau Irwin Lo Lee Shih (seeing u guys in Aug-Sept!) Serene Tang Thomas Teh Tai Yong (gonna hire me as ur PA when u’re rich and famous, rite?) Charmaine Goh Alexandra Houssaye Alexandre Martellozzo Helene Guibert Tia Po Yew Helene (Fishponds) Miriam  Raphael Cadoux (my hsemate) Derek Fox (my hsemate) Louise Howard Karina James  I love you guys, and hopefully we’ll keep in touch! Ciao!

      Have you LOVED before?  If to love means to be selfless, then I have not loved before, For I have always been selfish.  And why shouldn’t I?  Maybe I have never loved anyone then. Maybe I want to be loved and when this is not given to me, I feel the need to somehow extract love from the people I think I love. But I realise that I have not loved, but need to be loved.  Affection. I have given so much and still have so much to give. One never exhausts affection. I find it so hard to withhold affection to the ones I care for.  Maybe that’s why I love to shower my loved ones with gifts. Not just the various partners I have had, but even my close friends. Whenever I see something that I think they might like, I feel like getting it for them. No matter the cost, for I am satisfied if they are happy.  But is it really necessary to give gifts?  Maybe I’m too materialistic. Tell me that to my face. I have no qualms. For I know it is true. Material things do make me happy. But Love?  My heart has been broken too many times to know what LOVE is anymore.  WHAT IS LOVE? Is it an emotion of giving but not expecting anything in return? Is it a warm feeling for another person? Is it a feeling of security? Or is it just plain physical?  Relationships puzzle me. Why would a guy want to spend time with a girl? And for that matter, what does a girl want from a guy? Other than to procreate, I don’t really understand what couples really need from each other. Attention, care, affection, emotional support? Any human being is capable of providing that. Maybe more females than males. Maybe that’s why more females turn to their own kind.  I’m not saying that I am homosexual. I just don’t really understand a heterosexual relationship anymore.  Attraction And why is it that I’m always attracted by guys who break my heart? Maybe its because I pick the ‘wrong’ kind of guys. I’ve always been attracted to the rebellious ones, the bad boy look, etc. I never seem to be attracted to the nice ‘right’ ones.  The ones that would listen to me, talk to me and hold me like I want to be held.  Maybe they do. Maybe I just expect too much in a relationship. Does that mean I’ll never be happy? Should I lower my expectations? Will I be happy then? I doubt it. I need too much. Would anyone ever understand?  Am I overly sensitive? I think I feel emotions more than a lot of people. I used to be aloft and blissfully unaware of other people’s feelings when I was younger. But now, everything I do seems to reflect how I think people will feel. I’m not impulsive anymore and take an awful lot of care before I open my mouth.  Have you ever felt, when watching a movie, that you wanna shake a character to just say what they have inside? For example, a girl/guy who wants to confess their love/emotions for another and is holding back for various reasons? I’ve always wanted to just shout “Just say it!” But now, I find myself holding back. Biting my tongue, suffering in silence.  A friend once said “He who sighs never gets what he wants”. It could be true. It so frustrating!  You want to let them know how you feel, but you think about the consequences. Is it worth it? What’s gonna change? And then there’s regret.  I used to say “I don’t have any regrets yet!” I used to think that everything I’ve done made me who I am today. But who am I today, really? Do I have regrets? Definitely!  Of course we’ve all made mistakes in life. What would life be without mistakes? What would we learn without them? But it doesn’t prevent us from regretting, being sad, being hurt.  C’est La Vie!  I just want someone to love me as much as I love him. Is that too much to ask?

      Last night we (BVC STUDENTS) had a BVC dinner at the Royal West of England Academy and it was pretty boring. Maybe coz it was too bright in the dining hall, or maybe it was coz we had to sit and talk to people we dont normally have conversations with. I was also having a headache, so that didnt help...  Was separated from my friends and so was pretty lonely...  Took LOTS and LOTS of pics with all my dear friends, and cant wait to develop them...i have another roll, with the Birthday BBQ pics to develop as well! oh man, looks like i'm gonna be eating grass soon!  After the dinner, we all headed to Fuschia for a party and was admitted into the VIP room, which we didnt even spend much time in anyway! But thanks to T(hiru) who organised it, we had fun! at least i did! I was given a Tequila shot to down and i DID! but 1/2 hr later i was totally out of it...dunno if i was drunk or what, but i had a massive headache and it felt so heavy...and my vision was turning black! maybe i was gonna pass out and had to sit down every few steps! but once i got outside, i felt loads better...got home safely, thanks to Jenny, Maddy and Ian and plonked into bed, after taking everything off!  Woke up at about 12.30pm, so no going to class for me! hehe it started at 11am! but had to come in to pick up my International Trade brief anyway... should have brought my IT notes, so i could do my work here..coz i dont have internet so i always have to come into Uni to do my online research. sheesh! what a hassle.  well, better stop talking and start cracking on.  I cant wait till the 18th! then i'll be FREE!!!

      As u probably know, since not many ppl read my blog anyway... i'll be leaving Bristol, UK soon. Heading for Paris, then my lovely Penang in August.  I'll also be called to the BAR at Gray's Inn on the 22nd July.  Shipped like 4 boxes home to Penang and had to wait like forever for that fella to come pick it up..from 7pm-1am!! and he finally came at 10am the next day!! stupid shit!!  Ok, so now my room looks like it was hit by a tornardo..and being me, i.e. lazy as hell, i am not bothered to clean it up.. and no one can make me...HAH!  anyway...i booked like my barrister's gown and bands and still dont know what shirt i am suppose to wear with the bands...  booked my coach to london, hotel and hopefully everything goes smoothly.  If i knew i had to ship my things by last friday, then i would have gotten the eurostar back to Paris with Julz from London on 25th!! sheesh...talk about bad planning...but how was i to know that the shippers were so unflexible? can only pick up on friday and no other day for Bristol!! sheesh...what kind of business is this? who's the client here?  so now i have to come back to bristol on 25th and leave for Paris via London on the 28th!  but luckily the flight is not that expensive... only £27.99 with easyjet. eurostar was £50!  But its good that i can come back to have a farewell dinner with my friends before i leave UK, for good (maybe).  will certainly miss my friends, but never the weather!! HAH! i cannot understand how ppl can still live here! and dont get me started on the lifestyle! *rolling eyes!*  ok lah, better go now, coz i am very very hungry and shih's blog about malaysian food does not really help hungry ppl in UK!! :P  ciao!
