        Mr. Bush is a man  (or so its claimed) who came to power via legal...but undemocratic means and later said that he prefered having a dictatorship to any other form of government (like another famous world leader that comes to mind), has pandered to the wealthiest citizens at the expence of the rest of us.   Mirroring the policies  of former President Herbert Hoover ( Another Republican), the wealth of the few is more important than the needs of the many, or the blood of any. Oil is King in the Bush administration, just as it was in Hoovers.   Is it any wonder  that, like Hoover, Bush is incapable of creating a single new job ? No, you can't claim that he's created a few hundred thousand jobs after he's lost millions. You have to REPLACE those lost jobs before you can start adding. Five Minus Four and then adding one doesn't mean you have created a new job. You are still down by three. Any questions?  Buy a Calculator.  Take tylenol for any headaches ...Midol for any cramps.  I would also like to say a word or two about this idea that flipping burgers is a manufacturing job. Does that mean that high school kids should be paying union dues to the Service Employees Union ? Come to think of it, teaching these kids about the history of unions might not be such a bad idea.  I would agree that Bush is on to something if he were serious enough about what constitutes a manufacturing job to support their unions.    Unfortunately , after trashing the Federal Workers Union on the grounds that it causes a threat to national security if secretary's get together for a chat after work... well, I for one not only have trouble taking him seriously about his support of the 6 million people who he has forced to work without overtime pay...but I seriously doubt that he himself believes that flipping burgers is a job that should be represented by a manufacturing union.  As for his "support" of the Constitution that he swore to " preserve, protect and defend ", Mr. Bush has violated that oath so often that one is tempted to go back to look at the video of his acceptance speach to see if he was smiling or laughing before after taking that oath. Was he?  If actions speak much louder than words, then his oath clearly doesn't pass the laugh test in light of what he has done since then.   Its lucky for him that his party doesn't believe in the law anymore.  Otherwise they would have long since impeached and thrown behind bars this entire administration for everything from violating their oaths of office to war crimes that have long been accepted as being deserving of far more serious punishment than merely prison for the rest of ones natural.   The fact that he's lied about multiple issues (beginning with his claim that Clinton trashed the white house...and moving through more lies than I care to cite at the moment) it seems that the only way you can tell when Mr. Bush is telling the truth is when he's asleep, the cameras are off, and he's wearing the duct tape that Laura has slapped over his mouth so that SHE can sleep.  I used to look at her eyes on television and wonder why they had that same glazed look that other republican women have. Now I know. Its not drugs...its lack of sleep from staying up all night hearing "I've got it, Dick...Bus in some mexicans and give em the vote. Sign an X... you fill in the rest.....Speak English ? Who cares ?" (mumble mumble).  If Mr. Bush achieves an election for the first time in his life...despite the fact that he has alienated the bulk of our citizens via his actions... We can look forward to achieving what even Hoover was unable to achieve... a Nation bent on world domination using the blood of those who weren't smart enough to be born into a family of wealth and power.  Meanwhile...regardless of what happens...we can count on the price of oil going up...which will make Bush and his buddies in the Oil business richer than in their dreams of avarice.   Best of all, the railroad and roadshow of the media... that fourth estate that was once a bastion of unbiased truth, journalistic integrity, objectivity and which was unflinching unbiased...now supports, promotes, aggrandises and helps bring to power people just like Bush and his buddies.   The more things change, the more they will stay the same...for the media railroad and road show will continue to roll on whilst big oil and mega corporations are permitted to pump out propaganda and call it news.  After all, the only ones who have freedom of the press are those who own one, and the constitution doesn't require that they care about anybody outside of the 5-6 corporations that control the press.  It only requires that they say whatever they like at the expence of anything and anybody that gets in the way of the bottom line.  Freedom of Speach, fortunately, still exists for those who say what these corporations and their puppet politicians approve on.  In a nation where justice is for sale to the highest bidder... civil and human rights are nonexistant.  Hoover would be Proud.

         I should like to say a word or two to those who feel that Mr. Bush is getting a raw deal...and that somehow his message of his vision for America is not being permitted equal time with Sen. Kerry's.

      After the latest in the long line of threats ... er ... warnings ... or whatever they call the color coordinated scare system that Bush hopes will help him hang onto the office he was appointed to, I respectfully yawned and went to the movies...where I saw a commercial for the remake of the manchurian candidate.  The thought occured to me that one way Bush would be a shoe in in this election year would be for another airplane attack ... but this time held about a week or so prior to the election during a Kerry/Edwards stump speach ...preferably whilst both were both at ground zero.  With all of the major competition out of the way, and no time left for the democrats to come up with enough money or publicity on a new candidate ... Bush could simply stand up and say " The election must go on...and when I am elected, I will track down whatever terrorists did this.  America is a nation of laws and we will find these murderers no matter where they hide."  Never mind that Bush and his family, who have been doing business with Osama Bin Ladin for the past 25 years, somehow seem to have lost interest in finding out where he is. Never mind that, instead of asking Osama's family where he is, they were given the red carpet treatment and flown out of this country without the FBI even bothering to ask them the time of day.  Never mind that, for the first two years immediately following 9/11, the Bush family and Bin laden's continued to have cordial business relationships.  Since the day of his appointment, Bush and his buddies have been telling us that they should be believed no matter what, and that if its proven they are a bunch of liars ( which has happened more times than I can count over the past few years ) then it doesn't matter because without them, the boogey man would get us ... so shut up and support der glorious bush...regardless of how much dirt is under that shrub.  Bush said that "it would be easier if this were a dictatorship." Is murder above a would be dictator ? It wasn't above Hitler. Does that mean that Mr. Bush feels murder is an acceptable means of dealing with political and/or personal problems?  Wait a minute.  This is going too far.  Bush is no hitler.  Unlike Hitler, Bush didn't have the media eating out of his hand ... well, Except for Fox, CNN etc. etc. etc. Unlike Hitler, Bush didn't declare War on anybody who hadn't been proven to have attacked his government first....well, except for Iraq. Unlike Hitler, Bush didn't cater to the rich...except for Halliburton, Enron, etc. etc. etc. ad nauseum.  Wait  a sec... I got it !  Unlike Hitler, Bush doesn't have a mustache !  BIG difference !  Don't worry, be happy !  Still, since he is human (or such is the claim) we must face the fact that he is of a species that is the deadliest on the planet. After all, no other species kills for the petty reasons humans do. Would Bush kill for money, power and the love of his greedy friends?  Frankly, at this point, I wouldn't put anything past him or his buddies. After all...look how many people have been killed just so that he could gain control of IRAQ's oil business.  Of course, thats  just my opinion... I could be wrong
