        Wish I could be the one The one who could give you love The kind of love you really need Wish I could say to you That I'll always stay with you But baby that's not me You need someone willing to give their heart and soul to you Promise you forever, baby that's something I can't do Oh I could say that I'll be all you need But that would be a lie I know I'd only hurt you I know I'd only make you cry I'm not the one you're needing I love you, goodbye  I hope someday you can  Find some way to understand I'm only doing this for you I don't really wanna go But deep in my heart I know this is the kindest thing to do You'll find someone who'll be the one that I could never be Who'll give you something better Than the love you'll find with me Oh I could say that I'll be all you need But that would be a crime I know I'd only hurt you I know I'd only make you cry I'm not the one you're needing I love you, goodbye  Leaving someone when you love someone Is the hardest thing to do When you love someone as much as I love you  Oh I don't wanna leave you Baby it tears me up inside But I'll never be the one you're needing I love you, goodbye  Baby, its never ganna work out I love you, goodbye    ***Sniff, sniff,sniff...What a song!!! Sadness enfolds in every letters of each words. Pain, affliction, its the art of letting go.  Letting GO of someone you've LOVED ALL YOUR LIFE...whew! For me is the bravest thing one could ever do. I have loved a man with all my life, now that I am bracing myself for the worst kind of pain just to give freedom to the man to whom I thought will bring me and walk with me in the aisle. Destiny never brought us together. I love him so much...The FATHER knows that! But he needs more, more than the love that I have for him...now I'm sacrificing...I’m giving him up to the one who can give him the love, affection and the burning desire he needs. As the first part of the song goes "Wish I could be the one", well, if I could only wish far beyond the star and make my wish come true, then I’ll do. Still, hope embraces me, that someday, somehow inevitable fate will give us a chance and bring us together, and with these in mind, one promise has made -  I'LL BE WAITING FOR HIM UNTIL HE FINDS HE WAY BACK TO ME...EVEN IF IT TAKES FOREVER ...because my love for him is for all eternity...LYAF

        Itsumo kokoro we hoshi itstuka  Dare katu mata koi nei utchitimu  Itsumo kokoro nei eiro itsumo  Anata dake no basho ga aru kara      ***Huh? - Wandering what are these words and what does it means??? Well, actually these are Japanese words that were grouped in harmony and turns out to be a song. This is basically the solo section on the main melody of a popular song and played by a member of the group of Dice and K9, ITSUMO which means  ALWAYS . They are from Cebu and the one who's singing the chorus part are Japanese exchange students. At the very first time I have heard of this song, I can already tell that this will go through the hit chart. I had first heard them from Campus Radio when Master T interviewed them.      I have tried to look for the meaning of these Japanese words by surfing the net and by searching for the meaning of each words, thus giving me an idea and this denotes as;   ALWAYS, one heart will be cured from emptiness someday through Love and Tender Passion. To live with you ALWAYS, only in a place that filled with love and desire.      Sounds good though, but Im really not sure if this is the meaning of the chorus part. I just love singing it. It blends and it creates a harmonious effect to me. The sounds so made. Hope ya'll like it too. Happy listening! :-)
