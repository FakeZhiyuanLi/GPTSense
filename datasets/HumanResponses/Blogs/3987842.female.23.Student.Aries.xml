       (Recently, my boy, Rkid inspired me to take my own stock of the people who are there for me as of this very moment. They should know how important they are and how much they are appreciated. He entitled his tribute: The Ones I Walk With. During my days, out of my kindness, I have "walked with" some people in vain who pretended to be walking alongside me, when in reality, they were illusions. This blog is positive AND real. That's why mine is appropriately titled:    *#!*  the Ones I've Walked with   This is For the Ones Who Actually   Walked with ME...:)    To My FLESH-  Fam & SOUL-  Fam:    Mom, Dad, Uncle Frank, Aunt Helen, Aunt Thelma, Cousin Phyllis, Cousin Sunny, Cousin Roy, Cousin Lauren, Mama Fannie, Mama Shirley, Gram Naoma (RIP-Gram Faye &amp; my 2 gramps I never met) Soul-mom Suzy, Soulbro Justice, Soulbro Robert, Souluncle Jeffy, Souluncle Mark J. etc.   "You have all been relentlessly loyal. And I have a great memory-LOL. Thank you for your consistent honesty, encouragement, and support. Your love has been the bank account from which I constantly draw my wealth."    To My Closest Friends (MY SOLIDS):  Kasey, Jennifer, Ali, Sonya, Tara, Toria, Eryka, Loren, Badger, Ryan, Marc B., Fred, Carver, Dustin, KC etc.      "Everybody needs people they can be utterly comfortably themselves with- in times of triumph, vulnerability, embarrassment etc. You guys serve as the spectrum for me-the package-filling in the gaps from serious confidante when it's time to goofy rolldog when it's time. I love you for having my back when it hasn't been popular and believing in me when I would have convinced you to do otherwise. You are rocks. Let's continue not to let each other down."        REG-         "IN HIS OWN CATEGORY...I now have dedicated you your own wing in my blogger mansion where you will not be bothered except by the adoring, speaking mirrors that will surround you on all surfaces LOL...You were quick to inform me that no friend description of mine in my 1st blog applied well to our friendship...After giving a bit of thought to it, you do appear to be correct...Our bond is no longer rocky enough for you to be considered a rocky-roader, but is not yet secure enough for you to be deemed solid just yet...With a little more time of the good will and attentiveness you've been showing me lately, you will have no trouble morphing into a solid of mine again in the near future (not that it's your life's ambition...LOL)...But, I am truly happy we are moving forward in this positive direction. Fondly, Heidekens:)"        To My Roller-Coaster Rascals (  MY ROCKY-ROADERS)  :    Arra, Eric, etc.      "We've been in each other's lives this long for a reason. (That or we just can't seem to get rid of each other-ha) No, the reason I've fought so hard to keep you guys around (despite our many disputes...LOL...) is because I love you. In time, our love is stronger than our fears or egos or stubbornness. So, I'd rather put up with some hard-headed battles with you guys than lose your presence in my world. I am happy that we are learning to communicate better so that our disagreements over whatever can last minutes instead of months. And so, in this rebuilding, we are having the same fun we always had, but we are forging a new trust that we never really solidified before. This, we should be proud of. This time around, may we treat each other with the same respect and care that we would want for ourselves. Old friends. Old bonds. New Slate. New Day."     To My Not Often Enough Buddies   Kathy, Galit, Gabby, Sabrina, Lauren, Sherm, Candace, Remi, Ottman, Shuman, Kenny, Sethy, Seth B., Meika, Patty, Chinya, Kwaisi, James. D, Alex D., Micah, Tara Col, Jeremy, Ryan L., Marke, Martha, Curtis, Pollak, Sam, Liz, Farrah, Alene, Ria, Asia, Ny, Rochelline, Shakeya, Gretchen, KT, Dre etc.        "You Have made your mark through memories. The laughter, the soap operas- all good- all lesson learning. You are in my thoughts and wishes despite any time or distance we have between us. Let's cross paths more often. Blessings..."     To My Newer Pals (MY INSTANT-COFFEE GOOD VIBERS):   Tran, Windy, Brianna, Marilyn, Kynara, Dawn, James M., Gary Q., Zora, Greg, Jacque, Stan, P Trick, Ed, Lonzo       "I feel so privileged to have met you all. I admire and enjoy you for what you each uniquely bring out in the moment. Thanks for the bright auras and energy. Looking forward to getting to know you better:)"      To My Mentors, Teachers, Doctors(LOL)  :   Mr. McNulty, Ms. Hunter, Ms. Struss, Ms. Abouhana, Mr. Kirby, Mr. Brock, Ms. Frisby, Ms. Redline, Mr. Meister, Mr. Forbes, Ms. Rose, Ms. Hunter, Ms. Jackson, Ms. Artavia, Ms. Eason, Ms. Jimenez, Mr. Hawkins, Ms. Randrup, Ms. Sutton,    Ms. Goetch, Ms. Barrett, Ms. Forbes, Ms. Fern, Brando's Grams, Congressman Cummings, Ms. Corsey, David Mills, Carl Hancock Rux, Ms. Forbes, Ms. Goldgeier, Asua &amp; Asi Ofosu, Lenora, Susan Tegeler, Ms. Gleason, Ms. Hamden, Ms. Krich, Ms. Columbat, Ms. Hanson, Ms. Bryant, Ms. Brune, Corky, Uta Larkey, Ms. Crosby, Brian Patrick, Dr. McKim, Dr. Shualy, Dr. Hadley, Dr. Shopbell, Dr. Aygun, Mary Rafael, Rafia Foster, Risa   Garon, Saul Williams, Norm Bradford, Mr. Lieske,   etc.       "From Roland Park to Eugene Lang to Goucher to work places to internships to events to the most unusual of places, we found each other. You all inspired/challenged me to tap into my gifts and transfrom my reckless, random knowledge into realistic, future-minded wisdom. You were my parents when they didn't understand. You were my friends when they didn't care or had abandoned. You gave lost kids like myself the hope to persevere, build our confidence back up, and follow our creative instincts. Please don't underestimate your impact, and thank you for extending your warmth and guidance to me."      To My Family Friends:   The Piven’s, The Borris’s , The Silverman’s, The Allen’s, Garnie, Dana, Sally, Charlene, Beth, Linda, Chris, Cheryl, Marcia, etc.  “As you may be aware, we have a unique family…LOL. And you have stood by us regardless. Thank you, and let us do the same for you. With love…”               To My Co-Workers:   Mark, Brine, CJ,     Ted,   Maurice, Amisha, Miya, Itza, Billy, Tim, Clyde, Damon, Jamal, Big Mike, Jazz, Brrr, Erin, Janeen, etc.        "You're all personable, competent multitaskers, and I more than appreciate you holding me down in the jungle of nightlife...LOL. It makes me feel good that you guys   genuinely act happy to see me whenever I walk through the door. The feeling i  s   mutual.   I am also glad that some of   our professional ties are forming into friendships. I'm here for ya. Holla at yr girl:)"       To My SoulMate:  ???        "Like God, I don't know who/what you are, but I know that you exist. You may be a stranger I have yet to meet, a friend I havn't yet pegged for the romantic role or a friend who hasn't yet pegged ME for the romantic role. I do have a message for you though.     I am no longer in a rush to find and win you over. I am establishing a foundation for my own individual life of family, friendships, pasttimes and career path- and I hope you are doing the same and enjoying yourself. In time, when the ground is solid beneath my feet and we are both independent, we will gradually come together as two already complete adults and share a fruitful life. Sometimes, it pains me and I miss the void of you when there are already aspects of my life that I'm only inclined to share with that one someone special. I sometimes long for your feedback, your touch, to know what you look like. However, I catch myself because I know that I am nowhere near ready for you now, and you are probably not ready for me. So until then, blessings on your travels. Love, Your Heids"       That's all for now folks. My bad if I overlooked anyone, but I couldn't include everything. Things change, but this is who matters to me today and  hopefully, I matter to them, too. -HKid
