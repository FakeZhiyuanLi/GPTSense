      I am far too impulsive, I went to a music store the other day with a friend and this weekend I bought a guitar.&nbsp; I just need to stay in the house and never leave.

      A while back Electronic Arts tried to launch a game that would be completely interactive in your daily life.&nbsp; Not just at the computer but using your phone, fax, and any other medium handily available.&nbsp; You were supposed to get breathless calls that would freak you out making you constantly wonder if you were in the game or not.&nbsp; That was the theory anyway.&nbsp; An interesting premise to be sure unfortunately it launched right before 9/11/01 and so it got cancelled very quickly after a few embarrassing incidents (at least that's what I read).&nbsp; What does this have to do with anything?&nbsp; My friend Sean linked to this site in his blog( urlLink http://www.bloglines.com/blog/SCLiddle ) today:  urlLink http://ilovebees.com &nbsp; Being the curious monkey I am I dug into it a little bit and very quickly stumbled upon this site:&nbsp;  urlLink http://www.argn.com   What the heck could this be about?&nbsp; Well how about the dictionary definition:  urlLink http://www.unfiction.com/glossary/#arg &nbsp;  Alternate Reality Gaming.&nbsp; Wow.&nbsp; Its nice to see people evolving the form of interactive storytelling.&nbsp; Although if ilovebees.com is just a marketing ploy for Halo 2 it'll be quite disappointing.

      The Internet will never cease to be amusing because there will always be people around to make stuff like this and make us all go: WTF?   urlLink Independent Woman - played by kittens - Joel Veitch rathergood.com, music by Elbow

      The week of .NET training is finally over.&nbsp; Even though I'd already done a hard core .NET training course before I still managed to learn some new stuff.&nbsp; Plus its always good to meet people who are really experts in their field.&nbsp; Ian Griffiths knows his stuff, here's a link to his blog:  urlLink http://www.interact-sw.co.uk/iangblog/    If we don't start a project using this stuff soon I think I'm going to have to do something drastic.

      Today is day 3 of a 5 day training course on the wonders of .NET programming.&nbsp; Since I've basically already learned it all its pretty much review for me.&nbsp; The highlight of course is that our instructor is British so now I'm thinking in a British accent.&nbsp; This'll probably last until next week or whenever I decide to fry my brain watching Red Dwarf for 4 hours at a time.

      So I'm a bit to the left of center on most issues and have been known to get quite heated in my defense of my (not always rational) beliefs.&nbsp;&nbsp;Rather than rant directly (I'll get to that eventually) I'll just post a couple links to places that have some decent reporting on the political climate in the US. &nbsp;  urlLink http://www.slate.com &nbsp; - A good (mostly fair usually balanced) news site.&nbsp; The daily newspaper roundup is worth its weight in gold. &nbsp;  urlLink http://www.wonkette.com  - Warning not always work safe, politics with a bit of raunch. &nbsp; See I (unlike certain other people) can be fair and balanced...  urlLink http://www.johnkerry.com   urlLink http://www.georgewbush.com   urlLink http://factcheck.org/ &nbsp;- The headlines on this page when I linked to it look decent and balanced, not endorsing either side. &nbsp; Now the blatantly liberal stuff that shows my true colors.&nbsp; I will say that I don't necessarily subscribe to all of the ideas put forth by the sites I am linking to here and I freely admit that the left can be just as underhanded and misleading as the right at times. &nbsp;  urlLink http://www.bushorchimp.com/ &nbsp;- Okay this is a cheap shot but we have to laugh right?&nbsp; Its that or cry. &nbsp;  urlLink http://www.johnkerryisadouchebagbutimvotingforhimanyway.com/ &nbsp;- A more glowing endorsement I have never seen. &nbsp;  urlLink http://www.moveon.org &nbsp;- If you think "Liberal Media" this group should come to mind.&nbsp; Warning this site kind of caters to people (like myself) who lean to the left and sometimes like to get fired up about the issues. &nbsp; I saw Molly Ivins on CNN the other day and I thought she was very astute.&nbsp;   urlLink http://www.creators.com/opinion_show.cfm?ColumnsName=miv  &nbsp; In the end just vote, I really don't care who for, but inform yourself.&nbsp; Know the issues, know the candidates and vote for who you think best represents the future you want for America.  urlLink http://www.declareyourself.com/   urlLink http://www.rockthevote.com/  &nbsp;

      So yesterday I created a blog.  I've been meaning to for awhile and a friend sent me a link to his own so I thought I'd start one.  Here I am today creating another just to try a different service.  Lets hope I can keep up with this one for more than 24 hours.

      Finally a truly balanced and non-biased look at politics.  Everyone should go check out  urlLink www.spinsanity.org   These guys are doing what the mainstream media should be; questioning the talking points and relentless spin being offered by our government.  Their new book is great and I highly reccommend it, although from my experience most conservatives label anything that might suggest that the President is anything other than perfect as "liberal media."  So if you're liberal or just open minded give the book a read it really opens your eyes to what to watch for on the nightly news coverage of the election coming up.  Buy the book here:   urlLink http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0743262514/spinsanity-20/

      This morning I lost an hour and a half of my life that I can never get back sitting in the most pointless "communications" meeting ever.  Did I learn anything useful?  Only that you can tell our software group in India the same answer to the same question asked 5 times and they STILL don't understand "we don't know yet".  I am rattling the bars of my cage now.  I can't take being cooped up and not given anything useful to do.  I can see now why many engineers who become managers seem to hate it so much.  Just give me a task to do and let me go do it.  Don't waste my time with bullshit meetings and blatherings from people who have no business getting to call themselves "engineers".  When an agenda item says "status update" it does not mean that the people at the meeting want a detailed analysis of your project's architecture.  GAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH.
