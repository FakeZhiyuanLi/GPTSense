      just a touch about me  2 months ago i started this blog but someone from school found it and i was forced to remove it(for reputation purposes(Oooo big words)) but i'm back and posting yay! for me   anyways  i'm way busy at school at the moment with doing my final year and all.  i hate school more than i hate anything else in the world well apart from the people at school  but thats another story.  anyways i better go cause i have maths due on monday and i'm not even half finished and its cubics and quartics and really boring stuff like that.  although on that subject when in all hell am going to use long devision of polynomials answer me that.  i really better go now so bye byes

      a couple of posts ago i said that i originaly had to remove this for the survival of my rep.   well the reason behind that was i slept with a guy from school-i'm sharing this cause i've given up caring and my reputation's already in tatters-anyway this guy wasn't just any run of the mill guy he's the one known as the sexiest guy at school, you know the one really smart, really hot, plays football,'the school god',   the reason this is so totaly amazing that i slept with him is that i'm somewhere down near the bottom of the social heriarchy at my school. it sucks big time. anyways this lovely male speciman turned 18 on thursday and guess what we did again on thursday night, that's right we screwed.(i've been promised a birthday present too hehehe) it was better than the first time but still it's beyond me how i could be so freaking stupid as to screw him again.   anyways he had his party last night and guess what i heard him calling me, a slut, he called me a fucking slut, soooooo not happy. i suppose it's fair though cause in a way i probably am one, honestly all i'm doing with him is having sex we don't even get along on a normal day to day basis. we fight its actually kinda funny but hey.   writting this down is making me feel so much better. i woke up this morning in tears in disbilife that i could be so stupid. but i don't feel qite so bad anymore.  the thing that was worse about yesterday was the fact that he spent half the night with this blonde girl who looks like an absolute skank, midrift top, way too low jeans that are painted on oh and she was really really drunk   would someone please tell me why guys follow girls like that around like little loast puppies it sickening.  let me just retrack my claws so i can type  okay now where was i? oh yeah this girl, i know i have no right to be jealous its not like i have any claim on him all we're doing is having sex but my god that girl she was at lest a 4-beer-screw(4 beers before the goggels kick in enough) and i've been told i'm a no-beer-screw and we've already accertained that i put out so why in hell was he trying to get with that...that thing (shudders)  shit the claws are out again  i should really stop now i have to go and do my history and maths homework anyway so bye byes

      ok bout what i said in my last entry. its not true i dont honestly feel like that. ben is really mature and im(still i guess) really hurt by the rejection. and he can't be a boy cause he's actually really mature nad boys arent but vengefull lara reered her ugly head(yeah its uglier than mine) and its not that i want a 'man' in reality i just want a guy to.. well not love me but like me alot alot. i want to feel like someone needs me and that im wanted and thats not something ive felt in a long long time and the moment i feel replaseable like it wouldnt matter wether i was here or not and it probably doesnt matter but i need to feel like it does so that i will still be here tomorrow.  anyway thats my i hatemyself rant for today. afternoon all

      so so sooooo much has happened since i last posted like i know have a bf *does little happy dance* he's probley reading this but hey actually he is reading this cause he's the one making me update.  okay what was i going to type damn i've forgotten i had it all planned out on the train ergh i hate this  neh i'll just tel you all somethig else instead of what ben wanted me to type. heheh  lets start with ben, cute, really really funny, playful, a really really really really(okay i think you get the pic) kisser and he's a natural with his hands (bad lara i need punishing)  he's a blonde blue eye stompie whopmie surfer boy (some really old song) but he is he's blonde, has these really cool eyes that change colour all the time and he surfs.  and for the first time since i was 13 im happy  ahh thats what i was going to say yay! im not so dumb after all  okay, i tell people that my lucky number is 13 which probly sounds really stupid and posery but it is, but number 13 has more meaning than that for me it was the last time in my life i remember being truely happy(till now thanks ben *hugs*) and i've realised that i was happy becuase i was still naive. about 2 weeks after my 14th birthday i was going out with this guy called andrew, who i thought was really sweet and i thought actually liked me hah was i wrong so off i go to the movies with this guy(the dish at crown) the afternoon ended with me... shit i dont know how to put this... okay he forced me to have sex with him. i was raped in a movie cinema and the only thing i learned was that movie cinema floor are itchy. okay i've said it, happy now? (i think this probly means i win the bet doesn't it ben?)  and so begins of a downward spiral for lara of self destruction. within the next 9 months of this i failed my school subjects, got arrested for theft, smoke and drank and had another guy spike my drink (not that it needed spiking i was serverly wasted) to the same ends as my 'date' with andrew. i have now being raped twice in 3 months pretty good record hey. this spiral ended with me being kicked out of school.      and since then i have being serverly depressed. there have being some good times like ross my first love(dont take that the wrong way thats what he was my first love) whom i was with for 11 and a half months, and the restoration of a friendship that i destroyed during my crash.  the funny thing about being depressed for so long is that it evolved over time for so long i was just angry and hated my self, i loathed myself and tried to kill myself numorous times but obviously i failed at even that. theres a sucidal teens thoguht for you  when we try and kill ourselves and fail  it actually makes us feel like bigger failures because we couldnt even succed at a simple thing like that  my depression changed this year though, for basicaly my entire school carer i've have being teased and i've always had a really thin skin when it came to things like being told i was ugly or a loser or whatever the people at school were saying at different times, but this year i went back to school and i just didnt care, i wasnt angry or hurt or sad or hapy i was numb i just plain didnt care about anything. things that i loved no longer held any joy and things i hated no longer caused whatever it was that they once caused be it anger or sadness or whatever, being numb is the stragest feeling because you know what you should be feeling and you dont  i've became very adept at faking emotions over the last few months but the funny thing is i dont need to anymore and i know this probly puts a hell of  alot of pressure on ben but its done. the reason i no longer have to fake what im feeling is for the first time in months because i can actually feel again and its not self lothing and sadness and anger as it has being since i was 13 but happieness im actually truely happy and it feels so good, i can smile and mean it and i cant stop smiling and the best part is i havent had one bad though about myself since i met ben   you make me happy and feel wanted and pretty and samrt and all the things i havent felt in soooo long.  there ive posted now i have to go and pack because im going to tasmainia tomorrow for my sisters 21st birthday.   so TTFN to one and all and to all a goodnight   p.s. for those that dont kow TTFN is what tigger in Winnie the Pooh says it means ta-ta for now

      okay till admit i probhably should have done my homework months ago but i didn't cause i as lazy as shit  but anyways  i think god has something against me for saying  don't believe cause everything that can possible can wrong has  first i dont do the required work(stuff that i don't hand in i fail one of my yr 12 subjects)then i finaly do get around to doing it i cant do it when my sisters home so what happens she doesnt work for two days then she goes to work and my computer dies   computer fixed so at like 1 in the morning im there typing away every night for like the last week  then i almost get it done it taking soooo long and then i find out the printers out of ink and its not like iv got $50 to go out and buy a new cartridge so i figure thats ok i'll jus use Gary's(my big sis's bf, he's soooo nice)and thats all cool  the program suddenly starts randumly underlining things and making other bold and the spell check stops working and as you may have nothiced my spelling skills aren't great. but anyways so i figure thats okay i'll just go and spell checkit at his place too and he's all cool with that cause he's been helping em get around my sister knowing   then its nearly done and i realise that its like 3:20pm school shuts at four so im all like thats cool i just wont write a conclusion lose a few marks it'll stil get handed in   as i go to put the floopy in Gary says 'oh you'll have to burn itmy a drives shit itself" ive just whilted cause guess what yeah thats write the fucking burner died last week  and then its just like calm down i'll go to school and beg the usage of one of their computers for like 10 mins   so we fully floor it over to the school we get there at like 3:50 + and i very politely ask an office lady "do you know if there's a computer anywhere in the school that i can use to spell check and print this and guess just guess what she says no theres not the servers not turned on so no computer can be used  its just like shitfuckdamn could my get any worse  so im figuring i'll just type a conclusion and then sneak in bright and early monday and hide it in his pidgeon hole   so what do reakon good idea?   i hope to fucking hell this works cause if it doesn't my world ends any hope of getting into my course next year at uni just driffts away on the breaze  but anyways i have to go to work now - im doing a close(5:30 to 1am) good money  so bye byes

      woiuld someone please tell what diease i have that makes guys break up with me so quickly?  im so tired of being used and treated like im a door mat that gives free sex.  and theres probhably someone saying thats all i am  but because of my history im cynical and uncaring when it comes to sex it doesnt mean as much to me as it obviously means to all of you.  i'v had my heart broken too many times and i just cant continue to have it ripped up into little pieces in front of me.  oh if you hadn't relised i got dumped last night at 11:30 over the phone.  we spend too much time together and im not layed back enough but im still and beautiful, smart, funny girl and shouln't have any trouble finding a new bf someone to love me.  what absolute bullshit  all i want is for someone to love me or i even to settle for someone to like me lots and lots but no one does. i cant handle another rejection.  but anyways looks like im avalible for free sex again  hey, funny thing is im less broken up bout this than i was with the thing with bena dn this lasted like 4 times as long(7 weeks to the day)  scary huh  but anyways i have a shit load of homework to do as usual so im going to try and do it   have a good day all
