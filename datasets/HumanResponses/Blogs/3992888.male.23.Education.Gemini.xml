       We got cell phones. That was our smallest purchase of the weekend at 1 yen (with a year long contract). Needless to say, they are pretty neat and will serve their purposes in case anything happens to us on the road in a foreign country where we don't know what to say in the middle of nowhere. (It's really not that scary.) By the way, moshi moshi means hello (I think only when you answer cell phones).  Friday after work, Cristina came over and picked me up. I drove in her car under her supervision to make sure that I would know how to drive manual on a mountain with curvy roads. It turns out I do, so I am not as frightened as I was beforehand. That night we went to Kanoya city, the nearby not so city-like or very pretty place, but it is more urban which is kinda nice. We went out with some other JET participants. It was about 8 of us in total. We found that many places were full because this weekend is Obon, a holiday when people go back home to visit their families and remember their ancestors. Finally we found a place and ate. It was all you can eat and drink but I wasnt really that hungry or in the mood to drink (especially after Tokyo -- haven't told you guys about that one). After we ate, we went to a Karaoke Bar. It was not the karaoke booths type of place.  It was actually like a lounge and you told the bar tender the song number and then when your song comes up you get passed a portable microphone.  I did not feel like singing too much although I did do backup vocals to I forget which song.  There were probably about 50 people there, and we probably monopolized the mics most of the night.  The bathroom there was very odd.  At first you open the door and you are in a dark closet that is wallpapered in a dark pattern.  If it weren't for the door knob to the actual bathroom you would think you were in this dark little closet.  Then when you go into the toilet room, there was this apparently famous poster of obscene and lude acts that 1 or 2 people can do in a bathroom stall.  We were at this bar till about 4 a.m. and proceeded to go home.  Two of our friends that were drinking were going to get this special kind of cab that comes with 2 drivers -- one drives the cab and the other drives your car.  (Isnt that neat, they should have this in the States.)  However, since Cristina and I were not drinking we just did it instead.  I felt really comfortable driving the manual car again.  We dropped them off in Kushira and continued to Cristina's house in Higashi-Kushira.  We woke up the next morning and I told Cristina that I felt as if I were hung over.  Because of all the smoke, lack of sleep and dehydration, I felt like I was run over by a truck.  In any case, we went to try to get a cell phone but I forgot my passport (I did not think I needed it, after I yelled at Cristina why did she bring hers, yada yada yada . . . . I'm sure she would enjoy if I went into further detail.)  We the proceeded to go to a cafe with Kaz and her boyfriend Alex who lives in Kagoshima City.  The cafe reminded me of any independent cafe back home -- kind of Top-ish or Satchel-ish (but with blue instead of Green or Yellow) for you Gainesville folk.  Then we went to the 100 yen store (aka dollar store) which is amazing!  Mom, you would go crazy.  They had so many things that we wanted to buy, things that you never even knew you wanted.   These arent like your dollar store back home.  Cristina went a little crazy and spent about 25 dollars, but it was stuff that really helped her place out.  I spent about 5 dollars on a change purse because you get so many coins in change; 1 cent through 5 dollars are coins.  It's not really a change purse but like a U shaped thing that you open and your change slides out.  You see a lot of these in Italy (not for 1 dollar).  I also bought some cool handkerchiefs and some rugs.  Later that night we went over to the Kato house for a big dinner.  It was so much food again and so much fun.   We went back to Cristina's and spent Sunday fixing up her house.  It looks really nice.  We rearranged the furniture and everything really makes sense and feels like it's hers.  Then, we went back to Kanoya and bought cell phones.  Last night Cristina drove me home but since it was kind of late she stayed over and drove to Higashi-Kushira this morning (the sun rises here at about 5 a.m.).  Tomorrow, we leave to Kagoshima City, the capital, to go to our orientation for 3 days.  I pick up Cristina tomorrow morning and head off to the port about 30 mins from Cristina's house to cross the bay to the other peninsula where the Capital is.  (Make sure to see a map of Kagoshima to understand, our prefecture are two side by sude peninsulas that are separated by a bay with a big active volcano in the middle.)  Then, its a short walk from the ferry terminal to our hotels.  The trip is a busuness trip so my passage and stay is paid for.  I even get a daily allowance for food.  I forget what the official word is for this.  Mom, or anyone, if you could remind me it would be great.  Well I believe that is it for now.  Do not be alarmed if I dont write for a few more days.  Oh, and Friday is my welcome party... WOOO HOOO.

       So boys and girls, I caught another one.  Minnie Mouse is gone but Speedy Gonzalez is still on the loose.  I went to the rice chest yesterday and placed the glue trap right beneath the drawer before I opened it but Speedy ran and managed not to touch the trap.  Therefore, when I did it again (Minnie was still in the rice chest) I placed the trap more carefully and I caught her by the corner of the trap when she tried to sun out.  I'll save you the gruesome details.  Luckily, today is the day to throw out your paper and other burnables like food and I think that the mouse and trap fell in that category.  I only hope that they don't return it. (I'll explain now.)  Garbage (or gomi) is all recycled or burned here; therefore, it could be somewhat difficult for a foreigner to get in the rhythm of throwing out certain trash on certain days not knowing what gets thrown out with what, when and where.  (It's even more difficult than it sounds, at least in the beginning.)  They have clear bags that are used for paper and other burnables like leftovers and dead mice.  They have green bags for clean plastic; this does not include plastic bottles, those are cleaned and put in a separate bag.  There is a red bag for cans and aluminum (they also must be cleaned before thrown away).  There is also trash bags for clean glass bottles, a day for throwing out furniture and appliances, and a day for throwing out wrapped newspapers and folded up milk and juice cartons.  All the days are rotated and color coded on a big 1 year poster calendar that goes in your kitchen (at least in mine) with a big matching poster index to classify different trash.  Apparently my predecessor had a lot of trouble with this and they would often return her trash for improper splitting methods.  How they were able to tell it was her trash neither I nor her know.  Cristina's predecessor often went to the grocery store and thought that something looked tasty but refused to buy it because he did not know where he would throw away the packaging.  I actually have one bag full of trash that my predecessor left that I do not know what I am going to do with.  Some other things I wanted to share with you.  During lunch time I walk around the port, beach and river to read and eat or just relax.  What I find amazing is that the river here is (now) very shallow and has what we call in the states koi swimming around.  So essentially it looks like a huge water garden.  For those of you who dont know what koi are, they are basically giant brightly colored goldfish.  You can see them feed from the sidewalk and bridge about 15 feet up.  Something funny that happens to me after I come back from lunch is that certain people always ask me what I ate with great curiosity.  They think it's so interesting to see what I do and don't eat.  Side note:  The japanese products that have english on them are so funny.  Yesterday I bought a pack of these chocolate dipped long very thin pretzels.  My predecessor had left me a box of them so I went to buy another box I liked it so much.  Well this time I got the same pack but it was green instead of red and the brand "Pocky Chocolate" was modified by "Men's". . . so it read "Men's Pocky Chocolate".  I found this so funny that I had to take a picture of it.  The only difference was that this was dark chocolate versus milk chocolate (I think . . . I hope).  Last night Cristina was invited to go with this Japanese woman and her two daughters that are Cristina's age.  They went to the "art festival" that was at a strip mall type thing but it did not have any art and it had "popular Japanese food" like cotton candy.  This was in Koyama, the town between us.  She also saw a fireworks display and enjoyed it very much.  For more details you will have to ask her because I wasn't there.  This afternoon, Cristina is picking me up and we are going to drive to her house together so I can practice.  Tonight we are going to Kanoya, a nearby city.  Well, I'll talk to you later.  I may not have computer access this weekend unless I go to Cristina's so don't be alarmed if I don't write for a few days.

       They're back.  Apparently Mickey had some friends.  I like to call them Donald and Minnie who are now together now that Mickey is out of the picture.  Last night as I was waiting to see Back to the Future Part II, I heard the scratching noise I had heard earlier when I thought it was Mickey.  Well, I went to take a look in this cabinet that had a built in rice dispenser thingy (I dont keep any rice in it) and the mice were in there.  I couldnt catch them yesterday so I simply put a fire extinguisher in the way so they cannot get out.  Hopefully I can have someone else try to catch them.  I just couldnt bare setting up the mouse trap and hearing them squeal in the middle of the night.  Guess what I just noticed . . . . somebody left a Mickey Mouse pencil on my desk.  That's pretty funny.  Anyway, didn't do anything too interesting yesterday.  I think I finally mastered hiragana and katakana (the two japanese alphabets).  Also, something weird was happening at work yesterday.  Everyone was very stressed out and frantically talking on the phone.  Then everyone was out for about half the day.  Cristina dined at her boss's house last night and said that she had a great time.  She said she ate some yummy tempura stuff and some great sushi.  Then she had some dessert, gold kiwi (which she liked so much that they gave her some to take home) and a wheat tea that was also very good.  Someone then called her at about 10 p.m. to invite her to Kaz's town of Koyama for the Matsuri and fireworks they are having their tonight.  I don't think I am going because I still don't feel comfortable driving without a cell phone.  This weekend Kaz invited us to meet her in the nearby city of Kanoya (one hour or less away) for some conveyor belt sushi.  For those of you who don't know what this is, it's when you sit at a bar and small plates of sushi come around on a conveyor belt.  Depending on the color of the plate is the price of the sushi.  Then at the end they just look at your number and color of plates and they add it all up.  Then on Saturday we may go to the beach or a coastal drive.  Hopefully Cristina will have her alien registration card by then so we can get cell phones.  Next week we are going to Kagoshima City (state capital) for prefectural orientation Tuesday thru Thursday (all expenses paid except food), but I'll save that story for tomorrow.  CK, you're comment cracked me up.  I miss you so much.  Everytime someone says  Su Goi  (and they say it a lot) I think of you and smile.  As a matter of fact, at the fireworks festival several young people kept saying  su ge  and I told everyone at my office that I thought it was so funny, so they started teaching me all these other slang words and Kagoshima-ben and Uchinoura-ben.  Keep the comments coming.  Email me too.  What's going on in Gainesville?

       Happy Birthday Mom and Raulito!  I wish you the best and wish I could be there.  No more Mickey.  He has left us.  Last night, Kaz, the ALT who lives in Koyama the town in between Cristina and I, met us in my house.  We spoke for a couple of hours and had a great time.  However, when she was about to leave I saw Mickey as I do every night out of the corner of my eye and we tracked him down to behind a small bookcase I have.  I kept an eye on him while Cristina and Kaz handed me the glue traps so that I could put one on either side.  Within seconds the mouse ran and foound itself glued to the trap.  They told me to close it after I caught it so I did but the mouse was still alive (we could hear it squeaking).  So Cristina hit it (understatment) while we made loud noises so she wouldn't hear the mouse.  It gets better because garbage is difficult to understand if you do not know japanese.  Apparently there are 5 different classifications of recyclables that go out on certain days.  Since I still dont know the system, Kaz volunteered to take it to a convenience store where garbage is only classified into burnables and non-burnables.  (We voted burnables.)  Some other interesting happenings yesterday . . . at 10 a.m. I had to introduce myself to town officials in Japanese.  It was fun.  For lunch I had a Gatorade, a fried sweet potato/pumpkin thingy and some fried dumplings.  I know I gorged myself, and the best part is that it was only 3 bucks.  I also got the opportunity of sending for my absentee ballot.   I urge you all to register to vote at this time if you have not already.   I also received my alien registration card which looks just like a driver's license with a goofy picture of me on it.  And, I opened up my bank account in the post office.  Yes, the post office.  I already have the equivalent of 10 cents in it.  As to answer some of Ashley's questions from her comment as I am sure that several of you (if anybody else is reading this) have the same questions. . . . my "fast as an ostrich" comment was alluding to Cristina's ridiculous comment (ostrich is the fastest animal on Eartth).  No I did not know how to drive stick shift before Cristina's dad taught me.  I have never had a reason to.  (So you got me on that, but I know how to drive it now.)  As for the car being different . . . it is.  Think of a mini coop or a civic hatch back half the size.  You drive on the opposite side of the road with the wheel on the opposite side AND everytime I get in the car my knees hit the steering wheel.  Add to that the fact that we are driving in the mountains, with ditches that work for gutters so that there are no land slides everytime it rains (the car can get stuck in these, they are deep) and the fact that the roads are narrow with sharp turns.  So it is a bit scary at times.   As for not catching the mouse . . . too late.  I actually thought the same thing, but I cant think that way anymore.  And I pray that there are not any mousey babies around.   I have not seen anybody  eat  anything crazy but I have seen crazy things at the grocery store.  Lots of weird seafood and bags of fish flakes.  The raddishes here are huge.  I also saw some green bread with some brown stuff on it that I want to try but havenet.  Oh actually, the other day with tea I had some omiyage someone brought from Osaka that everyone was skeptical about because it was a sweet made from octopus.  I was good though.  It looked like a ball of dough.  And NO, no one has died from a pucker fish yet as far as I'm aware.  Something neat that I forgot to tell you guys about . . . Yesterday after Cristina went home, Kaz went to go visit the Katos and they called me up.  Apparently they had a makeshift party outside their house.  They were hosting several people from Kanagawa (near South Tokyo) who were here working in the Space Center.  They were cooking outside and made some YakuSoba or SobaYaku, I cant remember.  It's grilled noodles with vegetables meat and seafood.  In my plate during one of my many servings (IT WAS SOOOOO GOOD), I was served this half of an Octopus (that would be 4 tentacles) which I could not bring myself to eat.  Maybe next time.  Well thats it for now.  Jane.

       Yesterday I was at work just surfing the net all day. Nothing too exciting. My boss gave me a couple of glue traps so that I can catch Mickey (the mouse that also calls my house home). He seems to be too smart for the traps because he still runs ramapant. Actually, come to think of it a couple of somewhat exciting things happened to me yesterday. For one, I got a copy of the Kagoshima (the name of my state) english newsletter which has the listings of things happening around the state and (drum roll please) a listing of english language movies on TV. Yesterday was Poltergeist but I refused to watch it since I go to sleep with the TV on. I am paranoid enough as it is. My second piece of exciting news is that after work I went with a couple of guys from work to see a 7 meter rocket launched from the space center. It was pretty neat.  As for lunch yesterday, it was somewhat of a dud. It was 2 dollars. I had a teryaki burger. It was better than a chicken pattie but still a little odd, and I also had a bottled soy latte to drink. I did not really like these in Starbucks so I cant imagine why I tried it. I guess curiosity.  An interesting side note about living in rural Japan... at certain times of the day there chimes a song indicating certain times of the day. For example, at 10 a.m. it's Edelweiss from Sound of Music. There others that play at 8 a.m., and 3 and 5 p.m. but I forget what they are now.  As for stickshift . . . luckily I received a very good lesson from the very pacient Ramon (Cristina's father) so I have been able to survive. I am happy to report that this morning I did not stall at all and I even managed to slow down, brake and all that good stuff without thinking about it too much. I look forward to driving to Cristina's soon since all I have been doing now is driving to work and it takes only 5 minutes.  Oh and in special news, I am awarding Ashley with the "You are the best friend a person could wish for since you are the oly one to actually comment on my web site" award. I highly encourage for all of you to email me and write comments.   I would like to find out what is going on in Gainesville!   Remember keep in touch. I miss everyone back home alot.

       Well I had a good weekend. On Saturday I got up, took a shower, killed a giant spider, then went into the town to see what the paredu (japanese word for parade) was all about. It was really neat. There were people going around the town in groups of 20 or so holding up small gold shrines. They woould either run around in circles or throw it up in the air while going down the streets. People would be spraying water at them with a hose (I guess because it was so hot). Everybody seems to be amazed I dont think its incredibly hot, but it honsetly feels like any summer day in Florida. At one point, one of the leaders of the groups (it was a youndg group) holding up a shrine had them stop and introduce themselves. Some seemed excited, some too shy. I spent a few hours out and about and then returned home to wrap my omiyage (gifts for the office). I spent the rest of the day at home cleaning and fixing up things. Later on, some friendly people stopped by -- the Katos. It was Yu Kato and her sister Kokoro. They were both so nice. Apparently they always adopt the ALT in the town because they are not shy around foreigners and know a little bit of English. The were going to take me to get a cell phone but I still dont have my alien registration card.  Sunday I woke up and watched the news in World News Hour.  It is a program that shows 10-15 min news clips from about 10 different countries.  So I was able to understand the U.S., UK and Italian news.  Cristina then was able to come to my town.  The drive is really not that bad, only 30 minutes and it is very beautiful.  I showed her around Uchinoura and we went to the grocery store to get some sushi and milk tea.  I did not like the milk tea, but I loved the sushi.  Then we drove to Higashi-kushira so I can see where she lived.  The drive back was not that easy because of lack of signs for Cristinas town.  We took a couple of wrong turns and it took about 1 hour to get there.  But we made it.  I didnt like Cristinas town as much as mine (but I still havent seen its shore).  However, I loved her house.  It is small but modern yet traditional.  Everything is new and very accomodating.  She has beautiful horizontal wood paneling all over the entrance of her house.  You first walk in and there is a hallway shaped like a short letter T.  To the right is the toilet room, shower room and utility room (all which are tiled or have wood floors.  To the left is the kitchen with like new appliances.  Then opposite the kitchen you go into the 2 tatami rooms.  Each room is painted green with wood beams.  She has a huge tv and VCR with movies.  Her bedroom has a (drum roll please) a bed.  The only down fall is the fact that her only view is of the rice fields she lives right next to and the mountains in the distance (my town).  After spending some time there, she took me home.  Once home, she dropped me off at the Katos house where I got to roll my own sushi.  They also had me try a meat and potatoes dish and a soy bean paste they call natto.  I also had misu soup.  After that it was off to the rocket matsuri (they are launching a rocket from my towns space center Monday night).  Everyone was gathered at the town square with booths with food, snow cones (i had one), goldfish, masks, etc.  Many women were dressed in kimonos.  There was also a big stage with performances and karaoke.  I was introduced to several people (many of which already knew my name.  At 9 p.m. we went to the port where I saw the most spectacular fire works display.  I guess because they probably dont have many regulations on this stuff and they probably get it really cheap.  It lasted about 40 minutes and the fireworks were bigger than Disneys.  They had ones that exploded different colors and left streaks (like in the states), but they also had some that spinned out of control in mid air or kept on explodiing.  TRULY AMAZING!  Well I gotta go now.  I will speak to you some more soon. Matte ne.

       Well, right now I am sitting in my office that overlooks Uchinoura. Hopefully I will be able to post some pictures soon. Well I am sure that most of you are already wondering how life has been so far. Well luckily my predecessor has been here (until a few minutes ago when they took her to the airport). Therefore, life with translations has not been that difficult. Everyone has been really nice and been bowing to me all day long. As a matter of fact some guy on a bike that passed me this morning as I was walking to work gave me a free canned caffe latte (it was surprisingly similar to an iced lightly sweetened latte back home)...think Double Shot but MUCH better.  My house...well, I have a big yard but the outside of the house is a little run down, although I do have a traditional Japanese style roof. As soon as you come in you have a genkan where you take off your shoes to step up to the wooden floor. When you first enter there is a hallway. The first room is a large room with a hard wood floor. It is about 15 feet by 12 feet and is an office type room with a hand sink, lots of windows and a separate entrance... I think its kind of like an efficiancy. This is where I brush my teeth and shave (I will tell you why in a second.) Down the hallway there is my toilet room that is maybe 3.5 feet deep and 2 feet wide. It is really nice but only houses my toilet and a sink the size of a softball that only turn on for 2 seconds (literally) when you pull out the knob. My shower room looks like a utility room and it houses my washer. I had a slug come up the side of my tub on the first day. I was freaking out. My predecessor said she never saw one before in there. My kitchen has very nice light colored hard wood floors and has just about everything I need. The next 3 rooms are in an L shape and all have traditional tatami floors with paper wall and lots of sliding doors. I have two large but short coffee tables with some floor chairs, a tv, built in dresser and armoire, a small wooden dresser with mirror and a wall with floor to ceiling windows. One of the tatami rooms serves as a dining room with a normal 2 person dining set and a small book case. This is the room that the mouse lives in that I see every night and the spider that looks like a tarantula (that big too) but is fast like an ostrich. I am thinking of perhaps gardening because everyone here does it but I guess since my house was always for the foreigner that the foreigner never gardened.  Speaking about my town, almost everyones house is traditional (think Last Samurai) with incredible gardens of vegetables, flowers and bonsai. The town is surrounded by these beatiful lush green mountains which meet the sky (I still have not seen their peaks). The town hall where I work si pretty impressive for the size of the town at four stories high (it looks like something out of EPCOT). A little ways down they are building a town center that is the size of the ODome in Gainesville or the Miami Arena which is also impressive. The water in the beaches are blue and crystal clear from what I have seen as I drive next to them (I still have not gone).  A quick comment about the food (SO GOOD!). Today I had sushi 6 pieces and two rice pastry balls (not sure what that is) for about 2.50 american. I bought it at the grocery store ACOOP. They also have fresh sashimi there for about 6-9 dollars. At work they make fresh green tea and coffee at least twice sometimes 3 times a day. I also had ramen yesterday at a small shop that is not like your ramen back home. It was made with fat wheat noodles soaked in this delicious broth of green onions, garlic and (real fatty) pork.  Well thats it for now. Ive been sending out some emails but have not received any replys. I think that my aol may not be receiving new emails. So therefore try to post comments on this web site until I can get a new email. Talk to you probably next Monday because I still dont have Internet at home. (The school computer guy fell off a cliff while fishing, I am not sure what is going on with that). Oh, and this weekend there is a town festival that they keep on inviting me too. My boss asked me to sing kareoke there (I dont know about that... he said YOU SING AMERICAN SONG KAREOKE). Who knows maybe, what do I have to lose.  Oh and I speak with Cristina every night. I still havent seen her because she had her welcome party yesterday and still doesnt have access to her car but perhaps soon. I speak to her every day though.
