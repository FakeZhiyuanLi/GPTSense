       17th   Another day passed by, I spend my whole day reading and reading and eating as well. YEAH..!!! this I call relax … Tomorrow need to start my working day, emmm….so lazy when I think about it. No point thinking of it, since I still need to go for work. One thing I need to do is bring back my passion about teaching my student, so I don’t feel like “forcing” to work.  Other then work, I got a list thing to accomplish. First of all , that will be my friends. I will spend some quality time with my friends, there been  century since we last meet. Later on, will be my interest, i want to master up my skill.  I love the feeling of being praise, the successful while completing the project assigned. Although it really time consuming and stress out, but I still think that is worth it. Shop for some  book that for self development and increase self-esteem, I believe a person with high self-esteem sure can succeed on their life compare those low self-esteem, because without any confident, that is hard to bring other to your direction.  What else I need to do, emm… cant think about anything rite now, hehehehe….. what I thinking is about party party party!!!!!...... YEAH…     27th   Wauh…. Look at the date, already been 1 week I didn’t write my journal, that really lazy am I, actually for the passed 1 week, I have been so busy dating with my friends and I love it. I meet a lot of my old pals , yap, that kind a u know , like almost 2 years although we staying in the same island but we never meet coincidently. They look great!! Spending night with them really feel like back to our college life, when I first come over to Penang. They are my very first mates I know; they still the same, friendly, hospitality and social able.  God. The night is so short; I hate the feeling of separation. I do hope everyday we can hang out and meet as often as possible. Anyhow, I think this is the best part of gathering, u know once in awhile, we gather, exchange our life experience and share the same passed college life, laugh together, I feel good and yet so close with them again. I give them a big hug and kiss, they are too nice and I think this is the best way to show my feeling how well I miss them for the passed 2 years. Everyone seems to be busy with their works and something else.  Friends come and go, we learn to adapt what new and change for the better future. I always confuse and keep asking myself, from the very first day I came to Penang until now, do I change?  Do I improve myself for better future? What else I need to change? What else I miss out in my life? Of cause I change, I do change, but still go lot more to improve. I really want to thanks her. Yes, she is pushy, she is bosses, she is control freak, but she has her own perspective, judgement and view. Which sometime acceptable but sometime seem to be too stubborn. I learn a lot from her, she teach me how to handle my life, whereby my nature is likely to blame myself when ever goes wrong, then no action taken to improve the situation. She, she is the one who show me action speak louder then words. Ya, I still learning and still overwhelm with fear, I know one day I manage to get rid of the fear. I will! Right now i will wait for the right moment and show out my courage, with no fear inside me, ahhaha….. As they said, everything sure have first time, when u get used to it, u will laughing on your silly. When the time came, u knows u manage to do it!!   Go go go… Remember, next time I need to show out your courage, don’t be arrogant. All I need to do is my first step, step out my first step!

       Yeee….Piiiii…..!!! finally I finish my exam!! YEAH… Honestly, I don’t feel any excitement after I finish my exam, I getting more worry about the result.  I feel terrible during this semester, everything seem to go wrong, my friends, my study, my work… Right now what I can do is pay more attention on my work and further develop my interest, that all I can do this very moment.  Although I feel miserable and stress out during my exam period, but I do have great time with my friend. All this while, something keeps bothering me so much, which I couldn’t forgive her. After this few days spending my time with her, I only realise that this is because we having different point of view about relationship, which for her just part of flirt, for me because of my conservative thinking, which totally unacceptable for me. I though I already move on, actually the answer is “NO”, I didn’t. I am to scare to step out the first step, to take the risk of love. She right, she just pinpoint out what I have been afraid off, there is still someone nice out there, not all are bustard. The point is I don’t dare to give it a try, that’s all; I give up all the changes others offering me, without think twice. In the end, I keep on blaming why all guy just the same. Which is not truth of cause, the matter is I don’t give myself a chance and so do others. That is really unfair and Holly Cow, I myself screw up things!!  I see “changes” are the key where I need to adapt and apply in my life. Changes is not that bad, it really open up another opportunity, another destine. Why I still remaining at the same spot, same old spot. Damn it!!!! I should explore and prepare myself for what ever risk I might encounter instead of avoiding. I refuse to face it when people so willingly want to share part of their life with me, I run away , I pretending nothing happen. Frankly speaking, I do love the feeling of being pamper, care , love but I refuse to take the risk and face the fact. I been so selfish will came to relationship. I should take up whatever possible risk , as long I wouldn’t get hurt at the end , what is the harmful it will cause me anyway?  If u don’t dare to take the risk, then don’t blame the others, this is what u choose to be. Dare to make changes will bring something new, unpredictable experience to our life! Wish me luck, because I prepare for the changes!! and thks my dear, u really make me realise how important it is.

       8th June  Sad, right now my mind and my soul been occupied by this word “sad”. Today only I receive my research report grade, I failed. I put in all my time and effort then I failed at the end. My research lacking of information they required. That is the part I cant gain marks. Another thing is I lose 5 marks because of my careless, which I didn’t meet the minimum words setting by coordinator. Haih……….. I am so sad until I hardly focus on my study right now. Again, I don’t know what should I do, I feel like calling my friend, but I scare that they might be busy. So I wrote journal, hope I can feel much more better in this way.   This is my first time I fail my research, I feel like shit, this is the worst semester I had. I cant concentrate on my study, and I don’t know what is the hell bothering my mind. Exam is around the corner, my preparation still half way to go, my mind cant focus after I get this news. Oh man, I still waiting for another assignment. I feel very shame of myself, I already 24, but I cant even manage to handle my time properly, I cant even achieve goal that I set. Such a simple task, I fail……….  I aiming distinction this semester for both of the papers, end up the assign mark really turn off my plan!!! Gosh, not much hope for me right now, all I can do is get merit; this really still got a distance to score during exam.   GAMBATEH!!! Don’t give up until the every last minutes!!!   9th June  Why I study? To gain more knowledge or just because of certificate? If someone asks me, sure I will say because of my future, that’s all. I learn one thing from my passed ” what u desire for, put effort then only u will get it!! “As simple as that, don’t ever put your hope on somebody, that not going to work out and wasting time. I really very tired of my study and work right now, although I don’t have any burden and pressure with it, just mentally tired. I really need a break, a short break as I preferable…………..

       First of all, I like to get this opportunity to thank someone who suggested this web site for me to write down my journal. Hahaha…….. It seems to be a little bit late to say “thanks”. Really sorry need to wait until you remind me, very cute fellow…hahha. Hope you don’t mind and sure you will get your credit, my dear.  ;-p   Emm, now a day, I have few missions to accomplish. Every morning, I need to hypnosis myself that I look” pretty”, and then only will start my day. That sound weird, right. According to same survey, that is part of how you can increase your self-esteem. Will, why not, sure I will give it a try, such an easy mission!   I try to analysis and understand type of people surrounding me. Right now, I still can’t get any clue. Why human like to share their relationship with their friend’s? Its that consider as sharing happiness with their friend? Is that normal to share to relationship stuff with other? Anyway, the more I heard the more I get to know, each relationship need a lot of effort and tolerance then only can blossom. No quarrel will be impossible! Am I right?

       When thinking of writing journal, my mind when jamming, clogging, I got no idea what I going to write and express. Keep on staring at the screen, haih………nothing to write.   Sometime I do day dream one whole day, staring at the ceiling, my mind swing. I am so free until I can spend my day just staring at the ceiling. Can you imagine that? Don’t know whether others got do this kind of crazy thing or not.   Journal, why I need to write journal? So next time I can read it back, what happen from the passed? I don’t look back about my passed, I looking forward my future. A passed is history; it already happen, is a passed tense. We learn a lesson, or just laughing at how stupidity we are! I really hoping to have better tomorrow, I never appreciate today, which always wrong. On the other hand, I need to appreciate each day, the moment we have, then only we can create some miracle. I know what should I do to make my day, somehow, every people know about the life philosophy, but the point is how many of us really taking action to create miracle? You want something happen, and then u needs to take action, right. If everything as simple as that, then I already taking action at the first place, who care what will happen later! Of course not, when I thinking of the conclusion which not worth to take the risk and it make thing became worse, I flick out! Am I coward? Or I am in the right track? Can you please tell me? It that the correct way to handle things? (to all kind of matters )

       A4th June 	  Nothing much to say and nothing much happen in this few days either. Is that a good sign? Or shall I say this is lazy people lifestyle?  Sometime it good to have peaceful life, but it really bored and it tend to give me much more space to think nonsense. I am a dreamer; always love to spoil myself with day dream, which is wasting of time. Other people complain that they have not enough time, then me? What should I consider as? Person that got nothing better to do, always chatting and reading some no related magazine? I always wondering, all my friends already graduated and working, then me? I still study, and I can’t event manage to effort myself to attend my brother graduation, I got zero in my life. I don’t know what I want and what I lacking as well. Day by day, what on earth am I doing in my life? What I contribute to this society? What I learn? Why I born in this world? Bunch of question where I don’t get the answer, always keep bothering me.  Ya, no point of thinking something that you can’t solve, might as well concentrate on what you can do. This am what I advice other.   I love the feeling coming home, the place that I spend my childhood, and the place where I was born. Feel so secure, warm and full of nostalgic memories. Whenever I sad, “HOME” will be the first place thinking of.  I know my parents will be there for me when I am sad, when I faced difficulties, they always so supportive and caring. There are more then my parents.  Honestly, I don’t have any friend that really understand and care about me , but I know I have my parents , they are the only human I can count on no matter when, where , what happen.  I know I should treat my parents well and be polite to them. I don’t know why sometime I can lose my temper when talking to my mum, I lose my patient, I raise my voice towards her. She just keeps quite, so many times this kind of situation happen. At the end, I feel so regret and guilty, I keep on reminding myself, don’t ever repeat this bad attitude, but I still lose control, I am so emotional. I can’t control my feeling and temper at all!  I really don’t know how I going to social with other people if I cant handle myself that well. What should I do? I so admiring how successful others can handle their life so well, they manage to lead other accept what they thinking, so powerful and persuasive.  A fall in the pit, a gain in your wit. I believe that’s why our life became so obstacles,  always full of excitement and unpredictable future!

       Today is the sadness day in my life. I don’t know what I done? Why this always happen on me? Is that I take it too serious or I am so naïve?   I feel the gap in between me and my best friend begin became wider. She going back to her own birth place, she might not come back over here. I know this day will come, but I don’t want it to became like this, this kind a of ending. I don’t get to know her boyfriend, what I know is through photo and from her. I don’t know what the hell she doing right now, all I know is about something connection with her religion. I feel I am so far away from her, even like today we suppose to meet up but she didn’t reply my invitation until the last 30 min from the time we suppose to meet up then only call me up. I been waiting for her reply for 2 days until today itself I even message her to remind her.   What she thinking?? Is that I am some kind of backup? I am someone not worth for her to spend her time? She leaving soon, very soon, I don’t get to see her, message her, and phone her. I feel I really been abandon.   She been so busy, she doesn’t even plan to have another meet up with me. I am the person that keeps on inviting her; I am a silly and foolish person.

       Almost been awhile I stop writing my journal, of cause I do remember I going to write journal all the time, at the end of the day, I didn’t. …. The point is when I thinking of writing journal and review what happens from the very moment I wake up until I go to bed again, that’s nothing really special to write.   During this holiday ,I really hang out a lot , a lot really when I mean a lot which is like compare to last year, this year I really hyperactive. Somehow, I enjoy the return. Sure there is the limit over here, so I will keep on hanging out until my holiday is over. I feel great during this holiday although I need to work as usual plus another part-time job, but I really into it. My parent kinda worry about it, especially my dad, worry about my study. I feel sorry if I flung one of my papers this semester. Yea….there stills another hope to overcome it but it will be sad when I deliver the news for them, sure they will upset, so am i. I promise myself I wouldn’t repeat this ever and never!     Last weekend, I really get myself a totally unusual me!! That really doesn’t like I used to be. I really give all my friend a hang even stranger, all I thinking is I need a hug. And I do it without thinking twice. Normally I don’t have the gut to do it, that’s me, or shall I said that the inner of me, which I refuse to reveal?? I feel like I really need someone and u know, someone to care for me, love me, someone so tender, loving, caring. I know that is someone I can work out right now, this very moment, and then I refuse to think about it, I mean even never think about it. He is nice person, everybody seems to be so supportive about both of us getting along, but I totally don’t have any feel toward him, that’s really hard for me to accept. I so confuse , what if there is nobody outside there whereby I keep on hoping there is somebody outside there waiting for me. What if my judgement is false, which means I going to lose this Mr.right?? Am I going to regret?? Or I just accept him then only see whether we compatible or not.

       I giving up already, I really disappointed on myself.  I not good on studying, I have a very normal appearance, figure. When I see myself, nothing was outstanding on me. I am so fucking normal. Dull person, dull life and not much friend around me. I am damn boring, and overwhelming with loneliness. I want to stay with my parents. At least they will company me and share with me on each of my unhappiness. Who should I share and trust? When I having problem? I need to get more optimistic people, I need this kind of people to motivate and cultivate, and I want my life be different, in want to became someone under the limelight, be notice, not because of something weird, and is because of something proud to share among the others. Not because I am blurring as a topic to share around, is because I am smart and well done. Sometime I really wish I can reborn, with new life, new ability …….  Right now want I see and get from my friend is , they always neglected me, what I did and done seem to be wrong, unperfected, I want to be one of them , but they are so far away from me , there all so cruel sometime, they so bossy. They so confident and yet arrogant. I am so low self-esteem. I want to improve myself to become better and better, the only way I can is study and mastering my skill, but what skill I have? Artistic?? Creativity? Innovative? I can’t discover what capability I have, how I going to proceed my life?   I don’t want normal life; if got to choose, no body willing to have normal life. My target is - I own my own house, double storey house, condominium, car, luxury import car. I can spend and always get news outfit, latest outfit. All this sound so materialistic, so I should categories myself as material girl!  But a life without someone care and love, I really don’t know what else I will care about? I so admire does always can get what they want, so easily, me?? People hardly can notice my existence and pay attention on me, the only impression they had on me I am their entertainer, person to joke on.  I HATE THAT!!!

       Yesterday I did something so stupidity and I really can’t imagine what had happen to me?? What on earth I thinking and in mine mind? Hell …… what was I thinking? I really so hopeless and throw myself it to the trap. I look so idiot and really damn idiot. What the heck happen on me?? I am loser and I really like every time hang out, sure I end up no one approaching me. Then my friend they all always so busy and always exchange phone number with others. I like kitten that been forgotten, sit one side, which out anyone noticing my existence. The nite before is really enjoyable and I really like it a lot. My friends they are so nice and I so touching indeed. I cant forget what I did and right now I feel so miserable and really stress out. Again, this never ever will happen , I swear to myself, I wouldn’t allow this kind of situation happen again , ever!!!! Else I wouldn’t forgive myself. !!!!! REMEMBER!!!!!
