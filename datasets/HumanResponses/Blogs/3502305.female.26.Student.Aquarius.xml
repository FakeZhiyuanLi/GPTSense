      Trying out the different camera functions.  I tried out the action and zoom functions.  I was able to capture this squirrel (spermophilus beecheyi) running.  Not bad for a zoom!&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink

      spring semester is over, and now i can relax.  i totally need a break from this place, everything and everyone familar.  i need to get away and be somewhere unfamilar.  so, i've decided to actually go on "vacation".  i've never gone away during school break.  and after all these years, i think i deserve one (i'm on the verge of cracking).  it's probably not a good time to take off from work, but i really need it.  if i'm not at school, then i'm at work; and if i'm not at work, then i'm at school.  so i've really never taken a "break", which my soul really needs.    the idea to go away really came as a last minute decision.  i signed up for this trip just last week, which was during finals.  in the midst of papers, labs, and other assignments, i was feeling confused and insecure where my future is leading.  and i wanted to hide from everyone, including my friends.  too much was going around me at school and at work, and in my head.  and when the trip was announced, i quickly reacted and signed up.  i didnt bother reading the itinerary or what would be involved.  all i knew is that its a whole week in a different state and with different people.    normally, i'd be a worry-wort over this long trip, since it involves camping with many strangers.  what i went through this stupid semester, i know i can handle this trip.  i've been all over the internet reading up on the places we'll be visiting and distances between them.  and each night we'll be camping at a different spot.  i think my only worry is not bringing enough water and food.

      okay.  i'm really dropping out of the program and i'm not going to tell any of my friends, or they'll talk me out of it like they've been doing the past 3 years.  well, i should have really just listened to myself.  friends can say such positive things and sound reasonable.  but i've had it!  i'm just gonna go do it and let them know afterward.  this way, whatever they say to me cannot affect my actions.  ha-ha!

      woke up this morning feeling creeped out.  i dreamt i was on a field trip,  one that's 2-3 day long.  it was the second evening of the trip, and we (the class) were standing in a large hut.  bamboo sticks were walled all around, poled in the ground, and the roof cover were from big leaves.  the room must have been 18 by 30 feet long, and more rounded than square.  anyways, in the center of the room, a man dressed in animal skins, with a large headware was sitting on the floor.  beside him, lay this long stick.  his friends stood around him, leaving a gap directly in front of him.    after their ceremony, the people in animal skins moved about, but the long wooden stick and the man sitting on the floor stayed in place.  in the dream, i had approached and walked between him on the long stick.  and this greatly offended the man and his friends.  my class was no longer welcomed, and we left in a hurry.  outside in the dark, we were packing the suvs...... and then i woke up.  it was like there was something in the dark going to get us.  i dont know what this all means.  but i think i've offended someone, or am going to offend someone today.  maybe i'm going to offend myself.

      okay, 3 years later and i'm right back where i started.  i've been running in circles, telling myself not to quit.  but, i should have let go that first year.  i knew it was reasonable.  i knew it made sense to leave the program.  i knew that it was not my heart.  i have this problem distinguishing between working on meaningful work verses non-meaningful work.  in my perspective, i see them both as challenging work, yet, one can be completed, while the other cannot be completed.  i kept pushing myself to work on the project, thinking "if i just put in more effort, i'm going to accomplish this."  yet, it's been endless.  and now i feel like a fool.  i thought if i quit that i'd be a loser.  but now, i'm a loser for not quiting.  well, i've learned my lesson.  i know that its okay to quit on projects, esp those that cannot be done. and i'm going to make a really big decision to drop out of the program.  i've been wanting to do this for a very long time, and i'm ready to accept and make that decision.  sometime this week, i will go to the office and fill out the paperwork.  and from there, i'm not sure.  what i do know is that i dont want to be in the program anymore.

      i've been wanting to blog all week, but between the move and catching up at work -- i just didnt have any energy left over.  so the move out was pretty easy, though my parents made me feel like a ninny.  anyways, so i'm back on home for the summer.  back at home, my room is a huge mess.  i can barely walk in and get to bookself or cloest and my bed.  when i moved back in, i realized how small my room was and how much crap i have.  too many clothing and too many books!  i got fed up with it and went down to lowes and bought some shelves to organize my closet.  i cleaned out my shelves, gonna donate some books later today.    my thesis isnt going anywhere. i want to just quit.  i'm really sick of hunting and doing research.  the reading material is difficult, therefore boring.  its the kind of reading that one finds in contracts, things written as disclaimers.  and i hate this kind of reading.  its irritating.  i think i need to hire a lawyer to interpret this sh!t for me.    so in trying to develop my thesis, i'm getting really discouraged.  currently, i have no advisor on this topic.  oh, i have yet to tell my current advisor that i am changing topics and will be finding a new advisor.  anywhow, so i started thinking and thought maybe of changing fields.  so this week i spent alot of time checking out other departments and other universities.  long story short, it makes sense to either stick with what i'm doing or drop out entirely.  do i really need an m.a?  is it worth it?  is it worth driving myself crazy and being stressed every hour?  when i woke up this morning, it was the first thing on my mind.  and wanted to get more sleep, but my mind wouldnt let me rest.  its like i gotta have a decision made now, or else i ....... i gotta have direction in my life.  at this point i'm standing in the aisle trying to decide if i should buy the cookies or the chips.  which one?

      one of the challenges on this trip for me was to not say any bad words.  a few weeks ago, i attended my cousin's first communion.  and after the ceremony (mass), we gathered at the parish hall to have cake and drinks.  well, i had my camera in one hand, and in the other the drink and cake.  my cake fell on the floor, and without thinking said "sh#t!!".  i didnt mean to say that, and had a few adults eyeing me.  luckly none of the nuns or priests had heard me.  i'm very upset with myself about this and have decided to stop the habit.    so on my canyon trip, there were so so many many times i wanted to curse out.  but held it in.  i may have mouthed the word "f#ck" twice, but never sounding it out.  nope.  however, when i got back home, i think i was cursing left and right for a bit.  shame on me.  i really need to break the habit.

      well, i went back to work yesterday.  it was hard getting back into that mode.  i didnt get much done, i was busy trying to keep myself from falling asleep.  i asked my co-worker if she'd get me a pack of m&m's on her way to lunch.  i needed some chocolate to get me stimulated, no coffee.  i hate the taste of coffee, except for coffee icecream.  anyways, my co-worker is so cool-she got me my chocolate.    i've been eating like a pig lately.  having eaten the same stuff for the past week; such as oatmeal, crackers, water, pb&j sandwiches, cliff bars=i was getting tired.  when we went into the mini-grocery store, i'd get depressed b/c i knew there would be no way of cooking that on camping stove.  but now that i'm back, chinese takeouts and cheesecakes so far.  i'm in the mood for some pizza today, with all the toppings possible.

      I'm back from my trip!  And so happy to be home.  Got back last night, and it was so strange stepping into my apartment.  The colors looked different, everything looked different.  I thought I'd sleep in this morning, but couldnt.  I got up at around 8a today, and started checking email and catching up on other stuff.    I think the trip was just what I needed to get away from my life, even if just a short time.  Though I didnt get much sleep the whole week, I do have a better attitude and appreciate life more.  (However, I imagined myself hanging on a noose every now and then)  I was hating the trip on the 4 and 5 days.  I was disgusted with the restrooms at the campsites and irritated with some of the ppl.  I conversed with half the group, while the other half had problems with socializing.  So it got really weird at times.    The canyons we visited were all very impressive, esp. the Grand Canyon.  REALLY SPECTACULAR!  We didnt hike down in the canyon, instead we walked around the rim,  I would walk along the edge of the cliff to get the most of the canon view.  I took photos with almost everystep.  I felt like I was on a different planet, like on Mars.  There would be birds flying around the canyon.  I saw a few lizards.    By the six day, everyone, including I, were all happy to be going back home.  But as we approached our destination home, I was feeling kinda sad that it was ending.  I was getting used to the ppl, the camping lifestyle, the views of mountains and talks of formation.  I'd like to do another trip like this again sometime in the future.   For now, I've got alot of catch up to do in this urban environment.

      i didnt get much sleep last night.  but got up at 3am.  i've eaten breakfast and showered.  looked over my packed bags.  i think i've got everything.  but like all trips, there's probably something missing.  well, i hate to worry.  and the more i look over them, the more i get insecure.  its like a research paper; proofreading it many times and never feeling its complete, all i wanna do is turn the damn thing in!  anyways, i'm really excited about going on this trip.  i just hope i dont get lost getting to the meeting site.

      i'm bored, yet i know i have tons of shit to make up.  i've got this thesis to develop.  i've got to sort out my undies drawer.  i've got this field guide due next week.  my car desperately needs a wash.  i probably should start on my bills.  i'm lazy.  i'm nothing but a lazy bum.  there's just no motivation for any of this.

      yes, ouch!  i reconsidered hiking up this steep hill, but i had already gone to the trouble of crossing the stream so why not.  the trail was about 200 or 250 ft long and  a foot and half wide.  the view from the top was pretty, but not really worth it because were other places to see the landscape.  but i wanted to climb it, for the adventure.  anyways, it was going down that was really scary.  i was halfway down, when i slipped on some loose gravel and fell on my ass.  good thing i was wearing pants or i'd probably gotten some rocks up my ass.  well, i bruised the backside of my upper thigh.  when i sit, the huge lump gets in the way.  i thought it was only my hands that got bruised and torn.  &nbsp; urlLink     urlLink

      well, not much has changed.  reading through past journal entries, i keep telling myself to drop out of the program.  even during the first semester of my program (3 years ago), 2 and half months into it, i wanted to drop out.  the hell.     there's only one thing in my way from dropping out and that's my boss.  i have a topic, but dont know how to turn it into a thesis.  i think i've gotten really lazy or maybe my brain knows that its not worth my time so it doesnt allow me to put in the effort.  argh!  i'm very frustrated.  and because of this my face is breaking out.  i've never had more than 2 blemishes all through high school and college.  and now, now in my mid-20s am i going through puberty.    its weird having to look at all the acne/pimple cream/cleanser stuff. i didnt know where to start.  i think experimenting with several stuff only aggravated my skin's condition.  does any of this stuff really work? they seem to just temporary heal.  i guess that's how these companies make their money.  their product does it thing and the pimple is gone for a week.  but then it returns and it returns twice the size.  i dont know what the shit is going on.  i need to stop stressing and return to those care-free days.  driving is stressful and making me paranoid.  so i was finally getting over fear from driving, from last year's auto accident.  i was driving pretty comfortable and using the busy crazy, yet shorter, routes again.  well, i've gotten in another accident.  and this time, of all the situations, i'm pretty much a parked car which is supposedly the safest situation.  so i'm sitting there waiting for the light to turn green, and a car just hit me from behind.  the hell.  so now, i've got a new thing to be paranoid about.  i start freaking out waiting for the light to turn green.  i follow all the fucking driving rules: i give right of way; i drive defensive; i'm cautious; i make sure myself and others are positioned safely.  i do the best i can to prevent myself in situations where an accident could occur.  but it's just not enough.  and its hard to be confident and let go fear.  i have no control over the car around me and that's scary.  putting trust in stangers who are putting mascara on; eating and drinking; reading a big foldout map; playing with their gps unit; dialing numbers on their cell phone.  omg!  i dont know how ppl deal with this stupid world.
