      In case you needed further proof that the Human Race is doomed through stupidity, here are some actual label instructions on consumer products:  1. On a blanket from Taiwan -  NOT TO BE USED AS PROTECTION FROM A TORNADO .  2. On a helmet mounted mirror used by US cyclists -  REMEMBER, OBJECTS IN THE MIRROR ARE ACTUALLY BEHIND YOU.   3. On a Taiwanese shampoo -  USE REPEATEDLY FOR SEVERE DAMAGE.   4. On the bottle-top of a (UK) flavoured milk drink -  AFTER OPENING, KEEP UPRIGHT.   5. On a New Zealand insect spray -  THIS PRODUCT NOT TESTED ON ANIMALS.   6. In a US guide to setting up a new computer -  TO AVOID CONDENSATION FORMING, ALLOW THE BOXES TO WARM UP TO ROOM TEMPERATURE BEFORE OPENING.  (Sensible, but the instruction was INSIDE the box.)  7. On a Japanese product used to relieve painful hemorrhoids -  LIE DOWN ON BED AND INSERT POSCOOL SLOWLY UP TO THE PROJECTED PORTION LIKE A SWORD-GUARD INTO ANAL DUCT. WHILE INSERTING POSCOOL FOR APPROXIMATELY  5 MINUTES, KEEP QUIET.   8. In some countries, on the bottom of Coke bottles -  OPEN OTHER END.   9. On a packet of Sunmaid raisins - WHY NOT TRY TOSSING OVER YOUR FAVOURITE BREAKFAST CEREAL?   10. On a Sears hairdryer -  DO NOT USE WHILE SLEEPING.   11. On a bag of Fritos -  YOU COULD BE A WINNER! NO PURCHASE NECESSARY. DETAILS INSIDE.  (The shoplifter special!)  12. On a bar of Dial soap -  DIRECTIONS - USE LIKE REGULAR SOAP.  (And that would be how?)  13. On Tesco's Tiramisu dessert (printed on bottom of the box) -  DO NOT TURN UPSIDE DOWN.  (Too late! You lose!)  14. On Marks & Spencer Bread Pudding -  PRODUCT WILL BE HOT AFTER HEATING.  (Are you sure? Let's experiment.)  15. On a Korean kitchen knife -  WARNING: KEEP OUT OF CHILDREN. (Dammit! Who are they to tell me what to do with my kids?)  16. On a string of Chinese-made Christmas lights -  FOR INDOOR OR OUTDOOR USE ONLY.  (As opposed to use in outer space?)  17. On a Japanese food processor -  NOT TO BE USED FOR THE OTHER USE.  (Now I'm curious.)  18. On Sainsbury's peanuts -  WARNING - CONTAINS NUTS.  (Really? Peanuts contain nuts?)  19. On an American Airlines packet of nuts -  INSTRUCTIONS - OPEN PACKET, EAT NUTS.  (I'm glad they cleared that up.)  20. On a Swedish chainsaw -  DO NOT ATTEMPT TO STOP CHAIN WITH YOUR HANDS OR GENITALS.  (What kind of consumer phone-call led to this warning?)  21. On a child's superman costume -  WEARING OF THIS GARMENT DOES NOT ENABLE YOU TO FLY.  (That's right, destroy a universal childhood fantasy!)  22. On some frozen dinners:  SERVING SUGGESTION: DEFROST.   23. On a hotel provided shower cap in a box:  FITS ONE HEAD.   24. On packaging for a Rowenta iron:  DO NOT IRON CLOTHES ON BODY.   25. On Boot's "Children's" cough medicine:  DO NOT DRIVE CAR OR OPERATE MACHINERY.   26. On Nightly sleep aid:  WARNING: MAY CAUSE DROWSINESS.  (Duh!)
