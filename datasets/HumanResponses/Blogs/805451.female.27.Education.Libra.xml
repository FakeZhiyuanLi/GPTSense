						   Yesterday I was about to throw in the towel for parenting and then I woke up this morning and realized that this is my last "official" day of being a stay at home mom. It's been a wild journey, but well worth it. Yesterday I couldn't wait to go to work tomorrow, but now today I'm all weepy. So I plan on making the day worthwhile, after I get a few things done this morning. Maybe a trip to the park, or a bike ride with the 3 of us. MIL should be here around 5 or so and then I'm off to my 1st ever PTA meeting tonight where I'm actually a "P" instead of a "T" LOL.  B came home last night in a grumpy mood until he saw that I fixed him his favorite dinner (Chicken/Broccoli/Alfredo pizza).  We talked about earlier in the afternoon and such. He agreed that it was just as much his fault as mine and just chalked it up to a miscommunication and things were fine.   I am staging a boycott of News Networks. Now, I'm not talking about my local channels, or even the CBS, NBC, or ABC National News, but mainly the 24 hour news networks. I can't even watch them for a minute anymore without getting so irritated because of the blatant bias in their stories.

						   It was 4:27pm, we had just dropped off Em's playdate friend. The house was a mess and I needed to get some things down. I put all the chairs on top of the table, countertop and couch to vacuum. The phone rang and it was B screaming at me about a car repair bill from back in May that he told me to pay....the day before we moved (I was in a manic stage of packing and cleaning, etc). I remember him telling me now, but I didn't until he said something about the time I could get a word in from his screaming I heard a crash. Nan had gotten up on the table from the couch and then climbed on the table and up on the chair on top and the chair adn Nan came crashing to the floor, I was trying to soothe her and make sure she was all right all the while B was interrogating me about this bill. He found out about it as he had to have some more car repairs (to the tune of $150, which he told me last night he could fix it himself for $20). I was trying to explain to him that I must have forgotten during the craziness of everything and the fact that I never got a bill or he never said a thing about it again, when Emalee started screaming that throwing a tantrum that she was hungry, Nan is still screaming and when I finally got everything calmed down I hear from the other end of the phone, "Well if you can't give me a straight answer about it go f*ck yourself". Nice real nice. I tried to call him back twice to tell him what was going on and how I was preoccupied and he kept answering the phone and then hanging up on me so I said, "Screw it". I fought back the angry tears and turned on the vacuum to which it exploded  dust and quit 2 minutes into the cleaning. I'm not sure why I was more upset, the dust everywhere or the fact that it quit yesterday and he said he fixed it.  I just went into my room and sobbed.  I feel as though I should be feeling happy to be spending these two last days with the girls before I go to work, but I can't get out of the house fast enough. I suppose one of the reasons that I'm typing this out is so I can see it later when I'm upset that I"m not home very much. LOL.  I just feel that I'm becoming less and less tolerant. Oh well, finish dusting.

						   I've been neglecting my blog big time recently and I have to apologize. I didn't get all my links set up or the fact that I'm just behind....period. I have a lot on my plate as I'm preparing for MIL's 9 day visit to come and help take care of the girls when I start working, my aunt,uncle, cousins, grandmother and great-aunt are on a Southern Carribean cruise and I'm stuck taking care of all the plants, mail, newspapers, and animals. That in itself is a full time job recently. I go back to work after a 27 month hiatus on Wednesday.  B has started 2 a day football practices lately and leaves the house at 6:00am and doesn't come home until 9:00pm, plus there are work clothes to be ironed, and shoes to be polished. I'm not even going to start cleaning up the house until tomorrow because right now I have 2 Jack Russel Terriers (Eddie and Lady) running around my house during the day. They are my aunt and uncle's dogs. One good thing is that Em and Nan are having a blast with them around and Nan hasn't had ANY sort of reaction thus far.  Me, I'm just hanging on and trying to get used to a new schedule.  I PROMISE that there will be more in a little while, I'm just popping on for a second so that I can get a few things done (paying bills), but I"ll be online later when Nan takes a nap.

						   I changed the template for the blog and lost EVERYTHING. Sorry for the inconvience, I'm sure it was just the cosmos telling me that I need to quit bitching and whining and think about doing something more constructive.
