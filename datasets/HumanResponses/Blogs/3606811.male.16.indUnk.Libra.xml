      Another week has gone by, and I am back to my black space in the infinitive mass that is the internet. It is wonderful how something that is so intangible has gained such an emphasis in our lives. In that way, God and the Internet are similar in approach: both largely invisible forces that carry meaning and sometime translate into tangible “miracles”. Somehow, I cannot perceive a computer memory to have a physical presence, just as human memory has still not been given physical form.   Kada is this swirling mixture of a number of herbs, the most important being this twig of Jasthimadhu (Yashtimadhu). When I was younger, this piping hot drink with a lingering sweet after taste was horror for me. I hated the entire concept of medicines. I used to fall ill every fortnight, and while Kada was the least of the necessary evils, it was still something I sought, and later, fought to avoid. However, now, Kada is the high point of my usual monsoon cold. It has a most significant reddish tint to it, and when captured within the smooth, glossy walls of my barrage of stainless steel glasses, it gets a new kind of soul. This wonderful liquid, surprisingly enough, gains substance only in the stainless steel glasses. It is interesting to note, therefore, how liquid brilliance often needs solid sustenance as a counterfoil. If it fails in gaining the latter, whether in ones own self or through the support of others, the liquid brilliance condemns itself to a shapelessness.  However, this very shapelessness has become an important part of all our lives. Often enough, special art, the kind which attains success in drawing-hall conversations, is this very shapelessness. These random profusions into many thought streams at the same time. What began as simple relevant flirtations for people like Plath and Poe, has now become a religion of sorts. The more indistinct the piece, the better people seem to like it. Perhaps it has something to do with that primal being, the pseudopodal amoeba. Biology, in its infinite wisdom declares the amoeba immortal. However, the important aspect here is its tendency to send out fingers of liquid in seemingly random directions. The beauty of the aforementioned greats was simply that, like the amoeba, they were pursuing details that were probably too small for the naked eye. These new creatures, however, seem to take pleasure in a random flailing of the arms. I myself have been guilty of it on a number of occasions of course.  I will close for the night. The minutes are beginning to draw themselves out. Anxiety, however unjustified, is always rubbing its solitary fingertip across the centre of my being.  S’long! partho

      Hello.   A subtle mix of excitement and apprehension have kept me   away from my blog for the past few days. Now, work meets   pleasure in Malhar, and while I doodle during breaks in lectures   or as the moon kisses the rim of my diamond-grilled window, I   realize how I cannot devote this time to the online machinations   that tick away in a million homes the world over. There is very   little left for me here, apart from work. However, I guess   blogging will allow me to keep in touch with my prose, which   faces long periods of forced sanyas.   The monsoon has achieved an enormous new significance since   last year: Malhar. I hope this excitement and industriousness last   for another three years, though if my parents were to have their   way, my path would lead away from the dusky corridors and   high archways that define my present temple of learning. At   Malhar, the written word assumes maximum significance with   me, and I am part of the Intellectual front (as is Q) under LA and   Raga, the newspaper(my dept). Therefore, much of my present work is dedicated to that front, and my blog is rendered richer for the absence of my nonsense.   Poetry, as I realized, I don’t intend to place on something like the   Blog. As the days go by, I realize once more my joy alone, on   how there is no disagreement as to the type of music to be   played, and no issues on what to read or what to watch on   television. In a moment of a prayer of strength, to what force I   know not, I wrote “May I see potential in emptiness/ And adorn   solitude by the fitting”. Of course, the first line is rather clichéd,   you will find it in any quote book on optimism (which is what   makes it a rarity in my writing) but the second to me is important.   For solitude, when adorned by the fitting, becomes this   extremely precious commodity. It is like prayer, like limitless   dedication that leaves one fulfilled. “He built his own world   around him” is how certain individuals are described. I would be   proud to earn that upadhi some time.   There were a number of concepts I wanted to bring up, in time.   Perhaps they are best left to sordid and half-wasted evenings   among the like minded, who will tear my thought process apart   far more effectively than a benumbed target audience   bombarded by lit-up pixels. For now, I have to struggle to take   my poetry away from myself into more general streams. Let us   see how well I succeed. I am hoping that this Malhar, as last year,   will loosen my word pothi and allow a new cascade to descend   from the frail end of my pen pencil tip.    Oh, if any of you are interesting in sharing poetry on a personal   basis, my e-mail address remains dropdedman@hotmail.com. I’d   love to read up all your stuff, and provide feedback as well as I   can. Of course, I will beg you to return the favour. Please put in   something of consequence in your subject (sharing poems… or   such like ) else I will ignore your message.  S’long

      Jahaan nahin chaina... Wahaan nahin rehna  Still, often enough, on moody evenings like this, this melody returns to me. The haunting picture is complete. Amitabh Bacchan, with a glass of whisky or stronger, looking out of a window straight into darkness. There are other things about these two lines though. They teach me, again, that walking away and escapism are two different things.  When I hear the song, I don't hear the frightened squeal of an escapist, but the troubled pain of a person arriving at a painful decision. It is not a sentiment I can echo, because there is nowhere for me to run to. After all, wherever I go, I follow.  However, little disappointments showed me their potency today. They cling onto your heart, and slowly weigh you down. However, they are also easily dispelled. A few minutes of conversation with a friend. It reaffirms my faith in little things. Like there was a time when I spoke to a friend for hours, and all we discussed was football or really immaterial and general things; and I was frustrated because nothing important or deep had been shared or discussed. It wasn't one conversation, but a year's worth. But then...when I have the blues, their voice alone is enough to make me happy again.  I read today the opening lines of Tagore's The Gardener. It is something that I have been waiting for, a deliverance into what I consider the true Tagore: the same verses still in a real and practicable world, unmixed with the religious fervour carried over from Tolstoy, or maybe a late realization...I'll never know. As of now, The Gardener is more satisfying than Geetanjali.  Watched Hum Tum. A simple movie, and kept very fundamental and very real...the bursts into song notwishstanding. It portrays a brand of real people, even though they trapeze around half of europe. Cinema will be brought back to the masses in explorations of the truer conflicts that afflict everyday lives...but portraying the truth is a step in the right direction, even though it is a fancied and exclusive truth. By the end of the movie, if you limit out the exotic locales, which in fact have got no other function except being eye candy: the places could well have been different indian villages for that matter, you can connect with the story very well. Of course, there will be the usual clamour of "MUSHY!!!" and "FILMY!!!" and "IT NEVER WORKS THAT WAY" ... that is not the point. The point remains that a film is not about portraying the futility of life and situations, but to show you how you can lead one to a conclusion. Call it cliche, or call it atmosphere desensitization...I can see that cliche is often enough a very necessary part of most things.   Rosalyn, every time i go through your blog i feel so desperately inadequate. By the end of it, her blog has got all the usual hallmarks: go through each post, and you have to struggle to not find a mark of brilliance somewhere along the way. And then I turn to my stuff, and only once in a literal blue moon do i get hold of anything that can remotely aspire to that everyday level.  More later. Ideas are beginning to form in my head again. My conversation is coming alive in brief spurts. The rains are here, and they are leading another renaissance, another rebirth. I wish they would stay for the rest of the year...  s'long

      Hidden behind an incessant stream of double harmonics and distortion. The truth is invisible, and yet the only thing that stands through.  Things have never been so swell/ And I have never felt this well  With two lines the song is captured, centred and turned all the way around. I love this mix of desperation and raw rebellion, when you know you are on the losing side, but you are right there giving it all the fuck back. Going down fighting, going down my way.   I will move away from here/ You won’t be afraid of fear  I am broken, defeated, for I have failed a friend. I have tried, and probably done the best I could, but there seems to no getting away from some simple truths. Except when Dave is drumming up a frenzy. Except when Kurt is a single, unending scream…  Pain…  It did not take long to realize where I was headed. Life has become this series of compartments. Instinct is driven by experience. Raw emotion, always unchanged at the centre of all thought, rushes through. Turn it all against the only enemy I’ve ever known.   Down that other lane, the other track, where there is a hideous salvation. Where there is nothing but me, the music, and pain!  Head down your own dark alleyways, I will always be there behind you.  As of now, the same applies for the both of us…  You know you’re right.

      somehow, my pan- and global- views are getting heavily distorted. there is very little space, because excellence itself has failed to become a currency, and if so, how will mediocrity survive? is focus really enough? has the clarity of the past month been but an idealistic dream?  it is not for me to reason why. every facet that you reveal is but another field to respect and conquer. time is still in my hands, and i still fend off the upstarts, while continuing to be one myself. bless me, ye great ones! that i may outdo you yet!  s'long

      It's been another night. Of long counted minutes, of swaying disappointments, of half formed opinions cementing themselves, then breaking away under the confluence of new light:  Even as i speak, the birds take wing, and the sky becomes the glow of my computer screen. This is a strange curse, this inability to see the darkness. Many would call it a blessing, but it is a rule: every mind finds peace in darkness, and not in light; in switching off and away from existence, in silenced breathing alone.  And over in the next building, my comrades converge to the balcony. From time to time I have glanced out and seen their heads, bent over their own objects and their own musings. I have found the peace of company in distant minds, bent to some oblivion which will matter nought to anybody else, and very little to themselves: but i can hear their ticking, their insolent beatings on oft beaten tracks, their forcing new colour on the same old canvas...  To them, this new light holds new meaning. It signals the end of another wait, the end of another space in time which was nothing but darkness. So they all converge, this daily congregation, a band of the faithful, the faithful with dark circles, dishevelled hair, terror in their hearts and unrest in their minds: but smiles on their faces. It is the privilege of the suffering to find joy in little things. I can see their joy, and in some ways i can feel it-  In similar silences they all vanish back, to start their other lives. The lives that extend beyond the four walls that was their darkness, but the lives that will forever be bound by timetables and practicalities.   Physical discomfort overtakes me. My eyes force themselves shut, to stop their calm combustion for a brief moment, but even as the darkness emerges, a crow sings his morning glory.  There will come a time to dull the world away. For now, it is to another time, another day, and another life.  s'long

      Some things will never change.  Thoughts flit in and out of windows, caught in the meshes of soft linen curtains. They rise with the moon, but ebb with its tide:  Stars and all that is allegorical about them. Whether it is their twinkling through the tresses in your palm, or whether it is about the nebulae in those eyes. Whether they are the beacons of hope, or the semblances of passing, or just an excuse. Just an excuse to make moments with, on lonely beaches in great company...  And the thin red line, growing, swallowing the menial sections of existence, as it incinerates its path across that which has become most important. But then what are human efforts, but a scratch on the surface? Where have we led ourselves to be? As decades pass, superficiality assumes excellent new depths. Perhaps that is not what I am here to discuss. The mind is a strange trap. It avoids, and assumes both idealism and general good to escape it's own fate. Somehow, this is not the stage for anything startling. The mind is right in its inhibitions.  Sleeping behind me, i hope his dreams are as inclined to joy as mine can be. I hope the next thing you see is so beautiful to you that it becomes a life spring, something that fills you with both purpose and consequence, energizes you and lightens your heart while making it profoundly satiated...  Badol baul bajae bajae bajae re Bajae re ektara...  even tears sparkle with their own light:  s'long

      hello.  behind are the random ejaculations of all my male friends. they are ejaculating over a single, rather big ball, and with all of twenty three individuals being focused on from time to time, it is a rather large orgy. the best part remains that this is being watched live by tens of thousands of people, and on television by millions worldwide...  hell, i gave it away four lines ago.   my team just lost, fuck you all.  bye

      My father went over to Mantralaya today. It was some sort of freak party, the kind minsters throw from time to time to celebrate long spells of inactivity. After all, one does get tired of doing nothing after a while.  The point is not that. The point is, on his way back, he visited Rhythm House, and my dad, unlike most dads, picked up a couple of vcds. Then of course, like most dads, he picked up two black and white bimal roy flicks. Do Bigha Zameen and Madhumati.  I've seen the first, not yet the other, and i am a firm convert. when was the last time you saw a film in which there was no spontaneous dance in technicolour for no reason at all? when was the last time you saw a film which had songs that made sense, and played a major symbolic role in the film? when was the last time you saw a film which had CHARACTERS and not heroes?  i am really sorry am not more eloquent, but i have a head cold and my neck feels like it's dragging a couple of dumb belles, which it has never had occasion to do. all these women are so bloody ismarat! but then i am a regular dehaat for a while now.  will come in with more on this  s'long
