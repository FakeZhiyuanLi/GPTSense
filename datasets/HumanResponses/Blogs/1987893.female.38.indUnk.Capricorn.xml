      First attempt at blogging, not sure if this will ever see the light of day. I am hoping to join the world of knitting blogs and keep records of my knitting projects, plus occasional other topics. Can't wait to start uploading pictures of my work!  Here's a photo(and link to full size photo) of the Mexicali Baby Ole sweater I knit in July (from Knitters 71)    urlLink

      work actively  in progress:   - Socks for him in Wildfoote "Desert Grass".  1.75 socks completed! - Cotton/Wool chennille vest - needs zipper basted then sewn in.  Had the most frustrating time this weekend with "Better Mousetrap" socks for him.  I had started a pair, oh, a year ago.  Thanks to the strip construction and poor gauge calculation, the first one came out 2 inches too long in the toe.   So I started again.. about a year ago.  And that sock was coming out too small in width.  So I gave up for a while.  This past weekend I picked up the 2nd attempt socks (khaki with grape stripes), added an extra row to the width, sewed them up and..  it's 1 inch too long.  OK, fine.  I think I remember adding some extra stitches to make sock long enough for his big feet.. so that was a mistake.  So I went back to the pattern & made a reverse sock (grape with khaki stripes) sticking exactly to the pattern.  Only I didn't check gauge and I was using the wrong size needles - 5's when I should have used 4's - and the damn thing came out EVEN LONGER than the first one and was already too wide when it was 3/4ths finished.  I'm furious with the socks and myself for not measuring.  Luckily they are small and I can rip them out & start again if I want to, but I'm more thinking what functional hats this Plymouth Encore wool/nylon blend would make.     So that's the end of mousetrap socks for me.  Such a shame, because the first two pairs I made came out beautifully.  I've worn holes in my own pair 3 times already (note to self - straight merino makes soft socks but they won't last!) and the pair I gave away was also quite successful.  It's just socks for him that are CURSED.  For a corrective emotional experience, I decided to go back to regular old socks.  So I picked up another set of not-quite-finished socks for him and got back to work.  It's been a while since I made socks for grown ups.  It's so fun to try the sock on in progress with all the needles poking everywhere.  I'm pretty sure I'll finish these socks today or tomorrow, woo hoo!  Maybe this will lift the curse.

      Huzzah!  Granny's shawl is off the needles.  Started on September 17th, finished October 22nd.  Unblocked, it measures 22" x 54".  I finished late last night and then wove in ends today.   And promptly wore it to the theater to see Sondheim's "A Little Night Music."  It's going to be a little tough to part with this lovely object.  We took some photos tonight that I'll post in the AM.     Update 12-May-2004:  ... here is the photo, finally!   urlLink      Needing something quick with no thinking involved for the rest of the day, I picked up an unfinished Better Mousetrap sock from last year and worked on adding 1 more ridge to each side to make sure it will wrap around his feet.  The Plymouth Encore worsted weight yarn feels enourmous and rough in my hands after 5 weeks of luscious Kid Silk Haze.  That mohair/silk is so airy and soft.  I'm even having trouble getting used the feel Heaven, which is mohair without the silk.   Notes from the past - Sat Oct 20   I was swatching Heaven over the weekend (again, picture tomorrow) and I am pretty unhappy with the color choice I made.  It was a last minute purchase - saw a sample shawl, needed to knit it, grabbed a color I thought was mostly purples, and didn't discover until this weekend that it is really a lot more pink than I thought.  Both pale pink and very bright fuscia pink.  Plus turquoise highlights.    Update 12-May-2004: Here's a photo of the swatch of nasty pink Heaven    urlLink      I know there will turn out to be someone in the universe who wants this color, but it isn't me.  And I'm pretty sure it isn't Mom, who was going to get the completed shawl.  And the pisser of it - this is a $60 oops.   And it's already been through the ball winder, so I can't really take it back.    Since I'm stuck with it... I did a swatch to test the colors using the shawl pattern from the Purl book from Sally Melville.  I like the stitch - 4 rows garter with small needles, then 2 rows stockinette with larger needles- easy to make and interesting to look at.  I started using 10's & 6's, like she suggestes, but switched to 8's and 4's and finally to 7's and 3's.  The 3's really felt right for the yarn, so that's probably what I'll stick with for the next swatch.  I'm not totally keen on the way it looks with this variegated yarn - I think the runs of each color are too long for stockinette, even when it's just 2 rows at a time.  I'm going to give it one more shot in a garter stitch - the free pattern inside the ball band - and if that doesn't make me like the color, I'll have to find someone who likes these colors somehow.  Maybe a shop would let me post a "take this yarn off my hands" note.

      Pewter Lace Shawl from Interweave Knits is coming off the needles tonight - I've cast off half of one short edge & have around 650 stitches left to cast off.  Then it's done.  So tonight's task is planning.  What next, what next?  Time for inventory.  Half-finished stuff - red & white Dale of Norway baby sweater needs a hem and (ack) cut armholes (2 - 3 hrs) - pink basketweave baby sweater needs buttons & a mailing label for South Africa (30 min.) - chenille vest needs zipper basted, then sewn in. (3 hrs, if you count time for messing up & ripping out) - Ragg "Birkensocks" need 1 foot completed (7 hrs) - Wildefoote desert socks need heel turned & foot completed (7 hrs?) - Better mousetrap socks need 1 more row each side and seams (2 hrs)  Projects planned/yarn bough in the last 2 months - Charlotte's Web shawl in 5 colors of Koigu (for me) - Seed stitch T-shirt in Colinette Giotto (for me) - Blue socks with pink stripes (for Siobhan) - Mexicali Baby Ole sweater in Fortissima Colori (for MM's baby) - 1 giant skein Heaven lace yarn, was supposed to be a shawl for Mom.  Hate the color! - Hat in Noro's Kureyon (for who knows) - Baby jacket in Noro's Kureyon (for who knows)  Languishing projects - not started. - Rowan Denim aran sweater (for him) - Celtic knot hat (for sister-in-law)  I bet there are more at home.  I'll have to update this list later.  For now it's enough to have an overview of the things I might start.  I'm definitely feeling like I owe some of those half-done pieces some attention, especially the Dale baby sweater & the socks for him

      I figure the back plus the left front means I am half done with Swan.  Photos:    urlLink     urlLink     The front is now off the needles & I've done 5 rows of the right front.  I'm sort of dreading the sleeves, since my row gauge on this project is way off. I ended up knitting 22 rows for the armhole on the front.. so when it comes to sleeves, I'll probably have some calculating to do to figure out how wide the sleeves need to be.  Progress on whales: nil.  I knit the 4 rows of little peaky waves and a few rows beyond that.. but then figured out that I should have had 5 rows of waves and had made a couple other mistakes.  So I tinked back all the way to the end of the blue.  I'm hoping to finish Swan this weekend & get back to whales.  Today's humor: I was up at 12:15 am last night, watching Aqua Teen Hunger Force.  This ad comes on:  "Do you hit the snooze alarm in the morning?  Feel like you're dragging by mid-afternoon?  Need a second cup of coffee to get going?  Well..." and I'm thinking... GO TO BED, YOU IDIOT.  "... you need this fancy pants matress.".  Talk about hitting your target audience.  Yep, they're exhausted all right.  Yep, they're too dumb to go to bed.  They might just buy your matress!  In a rare moment of strength, I used the power of laughter to tear myself away from the shiny pictures.  I shut the TV off & went to bed.

      In my aspect as Easily Distracted Woman, I've dropped all other projects and have been working exclusively on the Myosotis cardigan for Julie B.  Cast on Sunday and finished the blue bit with the whales in yesterday morning.  I showed my progress photo to a couple friends and they actually recognized the grey blobs as whales!  Huzzah!  Photos:   urlLink     urlLink     I found a web site which describes the colors associated with French color names for  urlLink silk embroidery thread  and discovered that Myosotis (which means forget-me-not) is used a color name French.  It's apparently a "pale dusty blue".  And in the magazine, that's the color they used.  I've chosen a slightly darker blue, so the pattern name is now completely divorced from the actual object.  Oh well!  Wednesday night I stopped by  urlLink Knitting Arts  to pick up an interesting yarn to make string ties for the Florella baby set and get some advice on my 2 stalled Colinette projects.  I picked Tweedy Cotton Classic from Tahki in rasperry/pale pink/chartreuse/cream/lilac tweed.  I hope it will add just the right amount of jazz to the solid color sweater set.  All the ends are woven in and we're planning to be at home tonight, so maybe it will finally get washed - a week after coming off the needles.  Baby Jocelyn was due early this week, so I'd better get a move on!  On a side note... I'm becoming rather nervous about my punctuation.  I've read about half of " urlLink Eats, Shoots, & Leaves " -  a surprisingly fun book about the history & foibles of punctuation.  Trouble is, some of her negative examples, like "No dogs please," did not even phase me a bit.  (Punctuated like this, it's a statement.  And patently false, as many dogs DO please.  It's what they do best!)    Trouble is, it makes me think about each comma, dash, & my favorite, the elipsis.  I'm sure it will wear off in a few months, but it's interesting to become aware of something you were totally taking for granted.  Like buying a new car & discovering that there are HUNDREDS of your car on the road.  I now see punctuation everywhere!

      Look, titles!  I've been doing some remedial blog reading to get the lay of the land.  Looked a bit at Rob's blackdog blog, where his enthusiausm for yarn & projects must doing wonders for his sales, and Wendyknits and Bonne Marie.  Rob & Matt's Charlotte's Web color combinations made me want to haul my own Charlotte's Web colors out of the closet & get knitting.. but I've got to work on Swan, Myosotis & Bill's sweater for a while.  The knitting blogs were inspiring and a bit daunting at the same time.  Queer Joe's knitting blog particularly made me ask myself, am I adding anything to the craft here?  And my kntting group at work is sort of falling apart... bleah.  Discovered yesterday that my row gauge on the Swan is waaaay off - like, I should have 16 or so inches at this point, and I've got 9.  I could just keep knitting straight, but that would change the line of th garment from a nice neat trapezoid to a trapezoid with a box on top... so that will have to be ripped out entirely (I could save the last 4 rows..but why bother?) and started over.  It was only 2 days of work.  :-((  We're off on a birding adventure today, so I'll have plenty of time in the car for unknitting & reknitting.  And I'd better get going if I want to see them birdies!

      Hazy but beautiful day today.  No knitting this morning, but I am working on the seam of the lilac bootie for Wendy.  Still fussing about whether to have ribbon ties or crochet chain ties for the ensemble.   Tagliatelli Swan  Got started on the "bed jacket" project last night.  Knit about 10 rows, ripped back 6 and re-did them with the decreases which make the a-line styling for the body.  I started using just one ball of Tagliatelli, but I was reading the yarn label last night with its stern warnings to use 2 balls at once to smooth out the variations in hand-dyed skeins.  Will add the 2nd one tonight.  Here's my progress so far:   urlLink     As I was knitting last night, we watched the end of Angela's Ashes and all of Miyazaki's Castle in the Sky.  Sent them both back to Netflix this morning, but I'm feeling a little bad about having knit thru the beautiful animation of Castle in the Sky.  May have to make a new rule not to knit during anime.

      I'm starting again with my not-yet-fascinating knitting blog.  New plan: start simple.  I read about 9 months of Jerry-the-old-fart's blog,  urlLink When Knitting was a Manly Art , and was totally fascinated.  So I'm back on the horse.  I'm not yet whether I have the stamina to sustain a blog, but I really want a record of my knitting life, so here goes.   Knitting  With the last stitches done this afternoon, I am almost finished with a layette called  urlLink Florella  for Wendy's impending baby.  Found the pattern online with some other  urlLink antique knitting patterns .  Apparently it's from a 1943 pattern book.  I've done the whole set in light lilac Dale Baby Ull.  Remaining work is the seam along the bottom & back of one bootie and finding/making strings for 2 booties, 1 hat and the sacque.  Wendy's baby is due sometime this week or next.  Update 13-May-2004:  Here's yesterday's photo of the mostly finished layette.    urlLink     This pattern was very annoyingly written, with lots of K7, K2, K3tog... without much explaination of what was going on.  I had to make a lot of adjustments for a gauge of 7 sts/inch instead of 8, so I spent a long while with a calculator figuring out how to adjust the decreases & pattern motifs.  It was a combination of math and winging it, heavy on the winging it.  Overall, I'm satisfied with the results.  There are no finished measurements given in the original pattern, but if my math is right, my version is actually the same size as the 7 sts/inch version would have been.  It's supposed to fit a 6 month size.  Remains to be seen if it will fit Wendy's baby.   Plans  I've, um, been to the yarn shop rather a lot lately. But mostly with very concrete plans in mind.  Here's what's in the hopper - without counting unfinished objects:  - For Kelli, a cheer-up bed jacket while on bed rest.  Bought some Tagliatelli yarn in  urlLink Morocco  and a pattern for a short-sleeved cardigan called  urlLink Swan .  This is the first in line because I think she needs it now.  Mom says I have to modify the neckline because it's too droopy.  I think a little crochet will firm it up.  - For Julie, a baby outfit (hat and cardigan) by August.  Picked design #2 called  urlLink Myosotis , from Anny Blatt's "Layette", Hors-serie No. 8,  with grey whales in a blue background.  The name is weird, because as far as I can tell, Myosotis means forget-me-not.  - For Bill, a Rowan Denim gansey in the darker blue  urlLink Nashville .  This project has been simmering in the idea stage for about 6 years and he's getting antsy  - For me, Fog Chaser jacket from The Knitter's Stash with 4 different yarns from Mountain Colors, mostly color  urlLink Wilderness

      Last night we saw Tom Stoppard's  Arcadia  at  urlLink theatreworks  in Mountain View.  It's deep & multilayered, like all the Stoppard I've seen so far, but also beautiful and emotional.  I was just weeping at the end.  Boo hoo.  Great, great text and very well performed.  ... which explains why my knitting progress is minimal.  I've done scattered work in the last few days to clean up the many, many WIP/doomed projects:     Charlotte  is still lying fallow until I decide if I'm going to knit another repeat of the pattern.  I sewed the one finished sleeve onto the  Swan  cardigan to check the fit on random models at work.  I've got 6" of 18 on the 2nd sleeve.  Finished the  turtleneck  of Wendy's sweater, just seams left  Crocheted 4 string ties for the  Florella  baby set.   I'm itching to get Swan, the turtleneck & Florella finished, washed & shipped.  I need to reduce the doomed objects quotient (DOQ) so I can feel OK about moving on to the ASA socks.  :-)  Who thinks I can have them all done by Sunday night?

      Charlotte's web : cast off last night, but the finished length (unstretched) is only 22".  I am supposed to have 24. I am thinking of un-casting-off and knitting a few more rows, maybe even another repeat of the pattern.  While I am stewing over this decision...  I have been looking into "A Step Above" (ASA) entrelac socks from Knitter's 75.  So.  In a fit of "must have them", I bought yarn for these socks on Sunday.  But the yarn I bought is not showing the pattern well.  I am knittng a test triangle and it's just not looking good.  I think the best yarn for these socks would have color run lengths of about 6 inches at a time.  I have a bunch of yarns at 20-30-50 inch run lengths and this new cotton yarn which alternates 6" of purple with 1" of red.  The color is also muddied by the use of a white thread to make this a tweed yarn.  So I'm thinking about a quick run to the yarn shop... though of course Charlotte & the unfinished bedjacket, baby sweater and other baby sweater are calling.  And so we come to discipline.  I will knit with what I have tonight.  Tomorrow maybe I'll go to the yarn shop.  Today my friend Frank sent me a copy of the "Person Paper on Purity in Language" by William Satire - a satirical essay written by Douglas Hofstadter and first published in 1983.  Read it & let me know what you think:  urlLink http://angelfire.lycos.com/rebellion/personpaper

      On Sunday,  urlLink Janice  had a copy of the Summer 2004 Knitters #75 at S-n-B.  I really liked the patterns for using self-striping sock yarn in entrelac, especially the  urlLink Step Above  socks!  I have some glaring bright yellow & red Lorna's Laces sock yarn.  I've never done (or much cared for) entrelac, but this is quite a cool design.  Also yesterday I bought a copy of  urlLink INKnitters , which I haven't even cracked yet, because of a latent desire to do shadow knitting.  I've been looking for motifs other than the alien head in the Stitch-n-Bitch book.  I'd never even heard of this magazine until yesterday.  Weird.  Progress on Charlotte was essentially negative yesterday.  Knit 2 rows in the evening, figured out I'd repeated a row too often and had to un-knit everything I'd done.  Boring!  But I'm back to where I started now, so onward & upwards.

      10 knitters showed up last night to what we think was the first  urlLink knitting meetup  in Santa Clara County.  Several of the SJSU SNB'ers were there and some new folks as well:  Laura, Christina, Janice, Jenn, Mackenzie, Ivy, Jerri, Jessica, Liz & me.  I remembered to grab nametags before the event, so we all got a fair shot at learning the other knitters' names.  The Barefoot Coffee Roasters was a very comfortable place and the manager was very accommodating to the meet up group, including printing a table tent for us and finding us a more comfortable location.  Unfortunately, Wednesday is Open Mike Night and the music was a hair too loud for pleasant conversation.  We're investigating other venues for the next meetup.  Most everyone said they would come again.  Next chance:  July 21.  And I made some progress on Charlotte.  Just 30 rows left!  The last color is integrated - a subtle purple/lavendar/brown/ruby combination barely visible at the point of the triangle:    urlLink     Wendy told me last night she thought the "color development" was perfect, so maybe I'll get brave enough to cut the yarns & stop thinking about ripping it out.  In thanks for her kind comments, I worked on the turtleneck of her long-overdue Christmas present.  I did 2.5 inches last night, so half an inch more and that sucker is off the needles.  I'd love to finish it this week and wash it when I'm washing Charlotte.  And the baby Florella set.  And Rebecca stopped by last night with yarn she bought for her first project - a Beach Beanie hat from Knitters 74. She had a yummy Anny Blatt angora in orange/turquoise/raspberry/brown shades.  I think it will make a great hat.  She did the cast on and most of the first row before turning into a pumpkin.  I am *sooo* happy that she is plunging into knitting.  It's great to have something that draws us together regularly, hurray!  I found the blog of one of the SJSU stitch-n-bitch participants, Janice.  I totally admire her dedication, she's able to write daily!  Some day I'll be that cool.  Here's here stuff:  http://knitflix.blogspot.com/  She also posted an interested link to the SJSU SNB group today -  urlLink How to become an expert knitter , an online book.  I've read the intro & chapter 1, so far all great advice on how to select, knit & finish a great-looking garment.  Video report: Last night we watched 3 episodes of Magic Shopping Arcade Abenobashi.  It reminds me strongly of FLCL, which we loved.  Moving the action from one version of the shopping center to another allows them to make fun of something new each episode.  So far, we've mocked D&D-based video games and Giant Robot Anime.  Next episode looks to be set in China... poking fun at kung-fu movies?

      Wow, this has been a fun two weeks!  I taught a friend to knit on June 2nd and she's totally taking off - got a knitting book and taught herself a few stitch patterns based on having learned knit, purl and knit to together from me. So encouraging after the week of doomed projects.  The yahoo  urlLink Knitalong  group is doing shawls, so I pulled my 5 skeins of Koigu KPPPM and the Charlotte's Web pattern out of the stash and started on Friday.  I knit on our way to Half Moon Bay Friday night, in the car Saturday and at the  urlLink SJSU Stitch-n-Bitch  on Sunday.  This is a good antitidote to the doomed projects, since gauge doesn't matter as much and it moves very quickly in the beginning.  Progress photo:   urlLink     I met Emily, Laura, Janice and Jenny at the SNB group in Campbell on Sunday. It was really awesome to finally meet some other knitters?  some very pretty projects in progress.  Now I have to quit writing & pay attention to My Neighbor Totoro, which is new to me and looks gorgeous.  More soon, as Charlotte progreses.

      Existential crisis day.  Swan: I thought I was knitting with size 15 needles, but now I'm not sure.  They might be 13's.  And the sleeves are coming out at a very different gauge than the body (should be 7 sts/4 in - now coming out 8.5 sts/4 in).  So the sleeves are narrow and are taking much more yarn than called for in the pattern.  Also, the gal I was making it for delivered her baby on Sunday and is no longer on bed-rest.  I've got the body plus one sleeve finished.  I think I have enough yarn to finish the 2nd sleeve.  So.. should I keep going?  Myosotis: The whales are still stuck at the water line.  Some of the intarsia on the first bit looks wobbly.  Should I keep going?  Wendy's mohair T-neck in Tahki might not be doomed, just stalled.  Needs another 3.5 inches of neck and seams to be finished.  Maybe that's what I'll take on the road Thursday when we drive to Ashland for the weekend.  Knitting class at work today: just me and Angel, the newest knitter.  10 other knitters did not show up.  I think I made a huge mistake by not having projects & yarn picked out for them at the beginning of the classes.  I'm not sure how to get the energy back.  Should I keep going?  Bleah.  Movies this week:  American Splendor. Underworld.  Men with Guns.

      This news actually belongs to Saturday, but I was not entirely cogent then.  I have recieved the nicest thank you note from a recipient of a knitted object and I just have to share.   I finally managed to box up Florella and get it ready to send right before the Uni High reunion, but didn't mail it until Monday, July 19th.  Already on Saturday, in my mailbox was the thank you note from Wendy, which I am transcribing here:  "Dear Mary, We just love the beautiful outfit that you have created.  The pearly buttons were such a nice touch.  The color and multicolor tie goes great to gether.  Thank you so much.  Jocelyn is so lucky!  Best, Wendy"  And what makes this the winning entry in the "Best gift recipient ever" contest? - Speed!  Gift sent 7/19, thank in hand 7/24 - Encloses a photo of adorable baby wearing outfit - Noticed the buttons! - Noticed the ties (any idea how long I agonized over tie color? how many yarn shops visited?) - Includes birth announcement card with full baby details  In general, no one ever *asks* for the baby things I send them and who the heck knows if they like them.  But this is the first time I've ever gotten a thank you like this.  And the first time in like 10 years that I've received a photo of a baby wearing the knitted object.   Having this show up in the mail Saturday was a big boost to my spirits.  Wendy, you totally rock!

      Last night I finished reknitting the sleeves of the February toddler cardigan & wove in all the ends again. When I am finally able to leave the house, I can deliver a finished object right away!  (Photo soon.  I think all will agree the new sleeves look much more normal.)  It was good to have a small, easy-to-complete project to knock off.  My little stack of 'things I did while I was recovering' is growing.  I finished "24 Hours" by Margaret Mahy yesterday morning and added it to the stack.  Also watched Donnie Darko on Tuesday night and again Wednesday with the commentary.  Into the pile with it!  Next up on the video parade is Man on the Moon, which arrived from Netflix in like early June.  Everything must go!  More thank you's to people who have helped out while I'm recovering:  Mika, for my Wednesday morning visit and lunch. Rebecca, Cecelia, and Wendy for company last night.  Pat and Bill for great music to recover by.  And Adam (**ADAM!**), king of the kitchen, for dinner and cleanup last night.  Kevina and the gang for a lovely lunch today and all the well-wishes.  Thank you all!

      Had a great  urlLink meet-up  last Wednesday night at Blue Rock Shoot in Saratoga.. gave me a chance to pick up yarn for the next baby sweater which I don't yet yave a name for.  Watching Janice at the meet up I got a better handle on using the circularness of the 2 circulars to keep the yarn from tangling & understand the progress of the socks better.    Surgery Thursday morning went pretty well, overnight stay in the hospital was fine by me and I came home Friday.  Since then I've been lumping on the sofa -- something I'll probably be doing for another 2 weeks.  I've knit approximately 4 rounds today and that's pretty good, considering how spacey I am.  I've totally appreciated the support of my pit crew for the last 5 days.  People have brought dinner, come over to babysit me when Bill is out, sent flowers, called on the phone and just been great.  Thanks to Bill (you're the best), Mom, Mom & Dad W., John & Susan, Pat & Wendy, Jennifer and Pastor Richard.  I'm feeling much better!

      With lots of tips and encouragement from  urlLink Janice  from the Campbell Stitch-n-Bitch group, I am making great progress on 2 socks, 2 circulars.  Using Ingrid's  urlLink Double Trouble  sock pattern, I cast on both socks last Friday in Champaign then spent the rest of my visit and the plane ride home working on the feet.   	 Saturday:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Monday night   urlLink   &nbsp  urlLink      By Monday evening, I had turned 1 heel and Tuesday I turned the 2nd.  I've knit a few rows even now and am ready to start the ribbing.  Project: Double Trouble 2 socks, 2 circs Yarn: Regia 6-fadig Crazy Colors in color  urlLink Dschungel   Needles: Size 1 circulars (Addi turbo and Susan Bates) Start Date: July 16, 2004 Notes:  The yarn was a gift from Mom about 2 years ago.  The color did *not* grab me, so I thought it was OK to sacrifice it to experimental socks.  I dig it much more now that I can see the striping in the sock  Things I learned from Janice for this project: - Use the provisional cast on to start the toes - Short row toe and heel - Use size 1 needles (or 1 size less than normally used with the yarn) to get a firmer fabric - 3X1 rib looks great - 2 socks, 2 circs is easier than it sounds

      I just found out Jeanette and Jen are  urlLink selling  the fruits of their knitting as "Fuzzy Flops".  Their knit-decorated flip-flops are made with fun yarns that really jazz up your standard flop, plus good-luck charms for your feet.  I love seeing all the ways knitters make use of their talents to decorate the world. I hope they make a mint selling their work!

      I did it, I did it!  The following objects are ready for wash today:     Wendy's Reverse Turtleneck   Swan cardigan/bedjacket for Kelli ( urlLink photo )   Baby Molly's doll blanket/Feather &amp; Fan Washcloth   Baby Nolan's Early Arrivals preemie sweater  ( urlLink photo )   Sample illusion knitting versions of the NC State logo for Stacie   Phew!  I started Turtle in stinkin' January!  And Swan has been completely done & ready for seams since end of June.  I'm so pleased to have these things all finished up & read to go.  I'll post a photo after I've done the actual washing.  I love to see all the knitted objects drying together.  Double Trouble socks are *not* finished, sadly.  Talking with  urlLink Janice  on Tuesday, I decided I should use a different turnaround for the cuffs.  I tried a purl turning row.. that didn't turn outward, it wanted to turn inward.  R-r-r-rip.  So I tried a knit turning row.  That made purl bumps right on top of the cuff.  Not cute.  So I stalled out a while until Janice came up with an idea from something she'd knit before... change from k3p1 to p3k1 rip about half an inch or so before you want the turn down to start.  No turning row.  Just turn the cuff down after establishing the inverse of the rib parttern.  The change from rib A to rib B is hidden under the cuff.  So this morning I am going to r-r-r-rip the socks back about 25 rows and implement the new plan.  So exciting to be finishing things, working thru the stuck places.  I'm feeling ready to tackle a couple new things or maybe even finish up some evil old things.  Here are a few items I would like to tackle next:   Things already started     Anny Blatt Myosotis cardigan, started in May 2004.  Half the  urlLink back  is done & baby is due this week - eek!   Colinette Giotto tunic for me... a doomed object having been started twice already.  I'm worried I've scrunched the yarn & it won't be pretty anymore, so I've been putting off making this.. but I kind of want to wear it Saturday so it's either put up or shut up time for this project   Rowan Denim OXO gansey for my dearest ( urlLink swatch ).  40 cm of  urlLink boring stockinette  finished, now it's time for the patterns   Pursification of the Devine Mitred Squares     Things calling my name      Oat Couture  urlLink Crocus Cardigan  for Baby Clara (due Oct 16)   urlLink  Tilt , from knitty in Noro Silk Garden, the tuquoise, pink, purple color   Doggie sweater.  Been meaning to make one for about a year and the  urlLink Knitalong  Yahoo group is currently considering companion animal knits.  Brought hom Judith L. Schwartz's  urlLink Dogs in Knits  from the library and I think I have enough leftover Jaimeson's Soft Shetland to make an Icelandic yoked doggie sweater without a trip to the store    urlLink Entrelac Socks  from the Summer 2004 Knitters.  I've got the  urlLink yarn  balled up & ready to go.    And so the debate begins..  what to knit, what to knit!  It's so freeing to have finished those lingering sweaters, I feel like I could start a million new projects!  Bwahahahaha!

      I'm trying to clear out some nearly-finished projects before I go back to work.  First, Baby Nolan's preemie cardigan "Early Arrivals".  It is the replacement for the little green cardigan which came out to be doll-sized.  On Thursday I finished the seams and buttons on the cardigan.  I am not totally happy with the join at the upper right neck where the knitted-in button band was carried around the neck and grafted.  But since this truly is a temporary sweater for 3-5 lbs, I'm moving on.  Photo:    urlLink      Next, the Double Trouble socks.  Friday I knit, unknit and reknit the DTs, thinking I could have them done by Sunday.  But my dreamed-of turned down cuffs were causing trouble.  So they are still on the needles.  At Sunday's  urlLink SnB , I watched  urlLink Jeni  doing tubular cast off to finish her Double Troubles - a lovely cotton in pinks & orang.  I was a little jealous & thought about giving up, but i'm gonna stick with it a little longer and see if I can make the cuffs I dream of.  Finally, 2 sweaters whose time has come - the Reverse Stockinette Turtleneck and the Swan "bed jacket" cardigan.  Each has been finished for months... except the seams.  Saturday I worked on Swan, but had to take out one of the sleeves I'd already sewn in (grr!) and Swan had to got to a safe house for a while so I wouldn't murder it.  Better luck on Sunday with the Turtle - from one inset sleeve and no underarm seams to completed object in an afternoon and evening.  I think it is now safe to return to Swan and try again.  If I finish those seams, tomororw is wash day for Swan, Turtleneck, Early Arrival, Feather and Fan washcloth/baby doll blankie, and my illusion knitting samples.  Wish me luck!  It seems I am reluctant to let these finished objects really be finished and go on to their new homes.

      OK, so maybe it wasn't so sensible, but Saturday as my first outing post-surgery, I took a class with Valentina Devine through  urlLink Knitting Arts .   Wendy was aslo taking the class (not Wendy mom-of-jocelyn, Wendy wednesday-jazz-salon pal)   We started bright and early at 9 am Saturday.  By noon, I was very floppy and worn out - forgot to take the pain meds in the morning! - but a little lunch perked me up and I stuck with it.  The knitting classroom space is just gorgeous, overlooking the trees of Saratoga's Wildwood Park.  Crows, chickadees, acorn woodpeckers, Stellar's jay's and juncos were heard all day while we knit.  Ms Devine presented Creative Knitting - knitting garter stitch in random or semi-random color selections, changing directions counter-clockwise around the square as the mood strikes you, and finishing the piece with surface embelishment.  My square used only "leftover" yarn  (Valentina says "Not leftovers! These are your palette of colors.  No artist calls the tubes of paint not in use "leftovers.") in worsted weights.    I felt a little drab, since most of the students used novelty yarns and much brighter color choices than my Jaimeson's worsted.  I nearly left the square unfinished, but thought I'd better try out the surface embellishments before I forgot everything I'd learned.  I like it better with the decorations on.  Here it is: 		  urlLink
