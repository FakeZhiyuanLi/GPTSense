      Last night I decided to go over to my friend Eric's to hang out with him and my lil' bro DJ.  When I got there crappy rap was playing and a bunch of wanker gangsters in thier first year of being able to drink legally were chillin on the porch.  Not my scene at all.  If there had been some good rap playing, I think I could have handled it a little better.  In protest I went downstairs and played Turbo Negro's Apocalypse Dudes.    "From the ashes of this golden age of confusion, the denim recruits came to be known as the apocalypse dudes.  So you think you had an Opera So you think you had a Napoli So you think you had a decent pizza Well not like this  You got nothing to lose at Pamparius  So you think you had a calzone So you thought you could make your own So you thought you could take it home Well not like this  You got nothing to lose at Pamparius gonna wear them happy shoes tonight You got nothing to lose at Pamparius Gonna bake a motherfucking pizza tonight Apocalypse dudes got nothing to lose Gonna stomp some teenage ass tonight Apocalypse dudes got nothing to lose Gonna bake some motherfucking magic tonight"  Songs don't get much better than that.  Well no sooner than that song ended everyone started saying they were gonna go to another party. In Green of all places.  Didn't want to drive but did anyways because I didn't want Eric & Squeege (DJ) riding with the other guys.  My buddy Prido was there but then he jetted with his girl.  We show up at the party and its about 10 wasted 18 year olds and suddenly my 12 pack was gone.  So I was pissed, got over it and just hung out.  Watching all these kids made me feel old.  Not that getting old is a bad thing, I just thought that when I was that age I was alot more civilised, cultured and cooler.  Seeing that these kids were idiots showed there was definately an age gap.  These kids weren't cool like David or Sam from SBB or even like DJ who hangs out with the Green crowd.  When does the light click on?  Why do I feel I need to get wasted all the time?  When will the power comeback on?  Still no calls from Yoshimi P-wee or Naomi Watts. Day 2  Naomi did email me in the form of Matt "Sweet Pants" Stanz though posing as Naomi Warts.  I'd be his lesbian lover in Muholland Drive.  I'm thinking about emailing the Thurston Moore from Friendster to see if I can get ahold of Yoshimi.  That would be crazyness.

      So Matt has gotten me into a lot of things over the years.  Some were bad situations but almost all the others were completely amazing.  I cherish having a brother like him.  Which brings me to the task at hand.  Jokingly, I told him I would "guesthost" his blog for awhile.  But instead here I am.    When NPR starts talking about something in pop culture you know it's not hip(Yeah Yeah Yeah's comes to mind).  But of course if it's on This American Life then it doesn't even need to be considered in that context.  After hearing about the word Blog on I think it was Ira's show I've always wanted somewhere to right down my perception of the world, so I guess this is it...  Right now I just ate a chicken sandwich and feel sick from it.  Beer drinking commenses at 8:00pm tonight!  Ahh the smell of summer...  So now one of the guys at work is telling me that the "storm of the century" or at least this week is about to hit us.  It's 3:59 and I've still got at least another hour of work.  Storms are awesome but scare me a little bit. I jokingly just told Blake (sits in my office) that his basement walls were going to collapse tonight.  Like most things in life I hope I'm wrong.  It's kinda like during my drunken AKINISM rants where I repeat "hope you make it through the night" to everyone I see. This usually only happens when I'm in a bad mood, surrounded by cake boys and have been drinking whiskey for a couple hours. So please don't stop inviting me to parties. I say things because they sound funny and I can get a rise out of them, but I really don't want it to happen...well in most cases I don't.  Speaking of Akinism, what do you do when you find yourself doing a David Yow at a party?  I'm sure that will eventually happen to me someday so I want to be prepared. I'm a freak like that.    Still no calls from Yoshimi P-wee or Naomi Watts. Day 1

      From out of Cambodia we emerge.  Check the photos: http://matti.zimoblog.com/  You put nickles on the road.  You find yourself in the middle of the street.  Wild horses is playing and you wish yourself alive.  Instead you fall asleep because the soldiers aren't there.  You want to see souls in those fields.  Then you wake up late for work again.  You don't have enough time to pour all the coffee you just made.  You realize you forgot to turn it off.  You check your accounts and your nickles are in the road.  You try to figure out your next scheme so you don't bounce.  It's probably best to just stay at home.  Drop your guard i get to know you simon says it's time to move god only knows i think about you cuz its never time to show and prove it's never time to show and prove hiding all the time destroys me i never know what's right to do i only needed to feel a balance i just want to do right by you sitting safe beside the truth beside you watch out for my bullshit everybody's got it careful as a soldier we're so strong begging my new teacher thought you'd never reach her she's standing there in front of you it's twice as hard to fool us it's twice as hard to fool us careful as a soldier we're so strong  careful as a soldier we're so strong                      - "Careful" - Seabadoh  Still no calls from Yoshimi P-wee or Naomi Watts.

      oh shit run! oh shit run! oh shit run thru the ghetto  they will hear you  mornin bell tolls at home. rings loud back where I come from. calls me back  often times i would hope and pray. then faith came my way  oh shit run! oh...................  it's what appears to me  it's what appears to me oh shit run! oh...................  it's what appears to me  it's what appears to me ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh..........  -MMJ   Had a pretty easy night last night.  Sat at home after work with Mike & Matti before Tight Whips practice.  The clouds above the horizon, above the tree line, formed what looked like Mount Everest.  So we got out our rock climbing gear (soccer flags, a hammer, rope, spatula, rakes, tomahawk) and took some pictures.  Terra Incognito!!  Hopefully they come out.  Our pictures from Cambodia should be making their way to the press shortly.  TW practice was short and sweet and muggy like the Mississippi bayou.  Nothing like being soaked in your own sweat in the name of rock n' roll.  Gotta remember my earplugs for now on though, everything I swear is getting louder at practice.  Hopefully today we're going to do an interview for Utter Trash zine. If they post it, I'll put it on here for everyone to check out.  Watched some Iron Chef and Emeril when I got home and wouldn't you know, they were cooking up some bass on both shows.  I can't stand Emeril but he was cooking up some awesome sweet potatoes with sea bass garnished with thyme, garlic, mustard and worstechire sauce.  Yeah, its 11:00am and I'm starving.  So I got to thinking... am I letting blogs replace normal conversation with my friends?  I haven't called my best friend in awhile because it's almost like I know whats going on with him and he knows whats up with me. And since I physically freak out on the phone after 7:34 minutes I guess it works out well.  Does anyone else have a physical handicap towards the phone?  My ex-girlfriend said she understood, but I don't really think she did.  I should call her since she's an awesome girl, but my handicap is a deterrent.    I kinda think that has been the biggest problem with any relationship I've had.  I feel the need to change direction in the conversation because I know that I can end the phone call sooner.  Or I'll just end up saying "you want to get something to eat?"  Looking back, I think that's what alot of my parents relationship was based on in its last couple years.  They went out to dinner, just to stay together until I moved out.  Weird.  Still no calls from Yoshimi P-wee or Naomi Watts. Day 7

      One word...  Totally slayed.  OK so I'm not good at counting, but I do know that My Morning Jacket completely rocked last night.  The Odeon sound wasn't that great, but they still almost made me cry.  I caught myself before it got ugly though.  I want a parrot like Jim James.  Though I don't have a bird wrapped in plastic, I gotz a set list, Joanne gotz a pick and I gave her a poster.  It felt at times like a cocaine binge in the 70's and at other times like Captain Morgan's ship of lost souls.  Our fearless leaders at the helm.   Which reminds me of my recent fascination with all things mariner like. Check the spelling on that.  Lately I've been reading the Caine Mutiny (though I think I lost the book a couple days ago, Akins is gonna kill me).  Stans & Matti got me thinking about the ocean alot, and most of my favorite albums deal in some way with either the ocean, sailors, pirates, or boats in general.  I'm starting to wonder if that was a past life or something.  I'll have to talk to Jacob about it.  Yesterday when Matti popped some DLT into the CD player on the way to the show it really hit me.  I mean when your on tour, it's a lot like your going from port to port if you really think about it.  Bringing goods and tellin tales.    Great Nautical Albums or albums with Sailor Songs: Mike Watt - Contemplating the Engine Room Ween - The Mollusk Murder City Devils - In Name & Blood/Thelema My Morning Jacket - It Still Moves Clutch - Clutch  I think I'll go on a boat this weekend if I can find someone to go with me.  Maybe I'll try to talk my mom into it.  But she'll probably dis me like she has almost every time we make plans recently. I miss her.  Still no calls from Yoshimi P-wee or Naomi Watts.

      I just had to post these lyrics in hopes that 3wk will play it today...  You've got a nerve to be asking a favor, you've got a nerve to be calling my number, I know, we've been through this before Can't you hear me, I'm calling out your name Can't you see me, I'm pounding on your door   You've got a nerve to be asking a favor, you've got a nerve to be calling my number Can't you hear me, I'm beating on the wall Can't you see me, I'm pounding on your door Can't you hear me when I'm calling out your name   When I used to go out I would know everyone that I saw, now I go out alone if I go out at all  (That last line is probably one of the most reflective of my current days, makes me miss everyone I know, check this band out if you haven't already).

      Sweetness, tonight I'm heading up to Cleveland to see My Morning Jacket.  My rock brothers from the great land of Kentucky.  Kentucky is so far one of my favorite areas of the country.  I'm not exactly sure why, maybe it's the bourbon, maybe it's the people.  I think this show will signify that my summer has formally begun.  Matti, Mike and I have spent a bunch of spring days out on the porch listening to MMJ, but I have a feeling its gonna be in full swing from here on out.  Interfuse is working on some new songs.  We've got three that we'll hopefully get to play at the Lime Spider for the Akron All Star Playoffs with Don Austin and CD Truth.  One is a straight up Motorhead meets Sebadoh rant about the lovely city of Louisville, Kentucky, where I was so wasted I supposedly watched some girl pee (but I doubt I would have done that since it grosses me out so bad sober).  The other one Lisa is writing lyrics for and it has a New York vibe to it, very busy, but rocking at the same time.  The slower and longer of the three is gonna be interesting.  It has a couple off kilter breaks and is pretty intense.  Mostly lyrically about being 17yrs old, still living at home and sneaking out of the house in the middle of the night to do bad things and seeing ghosts.  And I mean bad things.  "Who do you Know?"  I want them to be better than most of what we've ever done lyrically and with the vocal delivery, but that's never been our strong point.

      I'm sick of storms.  It's as simple as that.  Friday night, no power and VanBot took a beating, but no one seemed to care.  Then the power went out last night, so I woke up about an hour late for work today.  I woke up scared to death in the middle of the night when the wind kicked up and blew some posters off my bedroom wall.  It felt like a near death experience when lightning struck as soon as I touched my window to close it.  Scary scary.  It wasn't so much because of the lightning and thunder that I stayed up for the next hour.  I had another crazy dream.  In this one a member of my family passed away because of something I did, but I couldn't figure out who it was or what I did thru out the whole dream.  Maybe it has to do with somethings I've been doing lately and feeling guilty about.  I'm sick of storms.  I thought I found our cat Taco in the axel of my truck on Saturday.  But it was only a pigeon.  It was really disgusting and bloody, so it must have been fresh. Still I felt real sad and recited Om Mani Perdme Om.    I stayed up late last night watching MTV2 and was lucky enough to catch the video for Blonde Redhead's "Equis".  Disturbing and anxiety filled.  The video has the lead singer portrayed as part manican, part robot in a hospital room.  All the while horses cross through the room and the background in an almost ghostly way.  It's weird because it's such a perfect video for such a tragic accident.  "I I I luv you, let let let me show you"  Matti got home last night, which is totally awesome.  I have the coolest roommate in the world.  He brought back some bloody fish and a blood red sunburn.  Tomorrow is My Morning Jacket.  Can't wait! Wish I wasn't broke.  Still no calls from Yoshimi P-wee or Naomi Watts. Day 4

      Alliance.  Hmm what can I say about Alliance?  The dirty lil' gummo town rocked.  Charlie & I made the hour drive to the town in the middle of country fields and it ruled.  After some great barbecue at Jacob from Disengage's mom's house we ended up at Mangos.  Go ahead say it like SNL.  It was in a mall for gods sake.  Bad dance music playing on one side and Disengage on the other.  New lingo as follows  SAP (Swampy Amish Pootang).   Shish ka bar.  I suggest adding them to your vocabulary.  Disengage threw down pretty hard, half the room was as sweaty as they were. Jacob's mom, his awesome girlfriend Chris, his cousins and I then proceeded to take over the dancefloor in the other room. We pretty much cut the rug into a nano rug.    Alliance wasn't ready for my interpretive dance yet.  I can still see the fear on that girls face.  Definately a fun night.    Spent the rest of the night with Charlie and his roommate Adam discussing stoner rock and the relevance of music.  Got home around 5am and had some crazy dreams about dogs.    Lets see, so far this week I've had dreams about snakes, my future wife (she's beautiful by the way), dogs, and naked men and women in bathtubs.  What the heck does it mean?  Still no calls from Yoshimi P-wee or Naomi Watts. Day 3

      I saw I wrote this in an email the other day and thought it was a pretty funny description of who I think I am when broken down.  "...sorry, not a chameleon in the least bit.  I'm a "well I'm going to go see that sweet band *#($%%_)%$ and @#$@* is going with me, and well @#)@#( going too, so I don't want to make anyone mad and leave them in a locked house, so I'll leave them in the van, and then call to announce this, but of course I am a Libra, which according to the zodiac, which (@(*$)& will highly dispute, question the relevance and then say its crap) I can change my decision on a whim.  Whichever looks like the best case scenario is always my rule.  Rationality doesn't come into play much" kinda guy..."   Stanz asked where I've been hiding, so I guess I'll say "virtual India".  It's all code, html, code, more html, and then FTP in my world.  But it's gonna look sweet.  I was on a bender (as Dave Davies calls it) last weekend.  Not really sure why, but Matti and Mike unfortunately had to wake me up from the floor a couple of nights.  Guess it's all that anxiety I've got towards everything.  I quit drinking pop which has helped, but I'm still having little anxiety attacks every few days.  You know, your chest feels heavy, you're sweaty, feel kind of nauseaus, can't really think straight.  Hope this doesn't lead up to another nervous breakdown like in 11th grade or when I was twenty.  That one sucked.  I was stuck in a drive-thru line with curbs on both sides and three cars behind me for 20 minutes.  By the time I got up to the window I drove right past it and down the street to Wes & Mouses where I cried like a freaking beat down child for about 30 minutes.  The whole time Mouse was looking at me like I was a ghost.  My mom and I hung out Monday.  We went to the Metro Park and hung out and then went to my Grandma and sister's graves.  My grandpa still hasn't put a headstone on my grandma's grave which is pretty upsetting for my Mom, so we put a little plastic cross where my grandma's grave is.  I miss "mi ma-ma" as they said in Pecker.  Full of grace! Full of Grease!  Holy Holy God God! Grandma Darlene would have loved that movie, she was totally down with me calling her mi ma-ma.  It's funny that I thought she was a liberal the whole time I knew her.  No wonder she would defend Bush.  I miss Baka too.  Anyways on a happier tone, tonight Tight Whips are traveling down to Athens (OHio University) to play at the Union with my buddy Ben's band.  It's gonna be an awesome shin dig since those guys are such rad dudes.  Check em out www.archvillains.com.    Tonights a full moon though, so I gotta keep my head on my shoulders.  Bet my mom cuts her dogs hair.   For some of us it’s a long way From the Cradle to the Grave, ow When you got no lovin’ When you got no love It’s hard to pull yourself up When you’re down this Low down Low down For some of us it’s a long way from the cradle to the To the grave To the grave, ow  When you got no lovin’ When you got no love Its hard to pull yourself up When your down this low When your down this Low down Low down For some of us it’s a long way from the cradle to the To the grave To the grave Ah-oooooo…. ahhh-oww  When you’re sleeping in the truck stop When you’re living in the parking lots It’s hard to pull It’s hard to pull yourself up I said its hard It’s hard to pull yourself up When you’re down this…  LOW! When you’re down this Low down Low… down But the murder But the murder But the murder city But the murder city devils I said the devils The devils know The devils know When you’re out on the road When you’re down in the shit holes In the shit holes  And out on the stashe streets You know… its hard Its hard to pull It’s hard… to pull… yourself up When you’re down Ah-oooooooo When you’re down this Low When you’re down this Low down When you’re down this… LOW AH-OOOOOOOOO  Still no calls from Yoshimi P-wee or Naomi Watts.

      So I gotz a Grade 1 concussion and Cervical Strain.  How sweet is that.    I ran two miles yesterday too, so add to that a sore back and messed up legs. I'm a wreck.  Dude Ranch Nurse is so far one of the creepiest songs I've heard in awhile.  "You be patient, and I'll attend".  Kim Gordon's singing and lyrics completely confuse me and turn me on at the same time.  Has anybody else listened to Sonic Nurse yet?  I wish there were more Lee songs.  Oh and Carrie Brownstein is my friend!  So I think I'll post some S.K. lyrics:  "Combat Rock"  They tell us there are only two sides to be on If you are on our side you're right if not you're wrong But are we innocent, paragons of good? Is our guilt erased by the pain that we've endured? Hey look it's time to pledge allegiance Oh god I love my dirty Uncle Sam Our country's marching to the beat now And we must learn to step in time Where is the questioning where is the protest song? Since when is skepticism un-American? Dissent's not treason but they talk like it's the same Those who disagree are afraid to show their face Let's break out our old machines now It sure is good to see them run again Oh gentlemen start your engines And we know where we get the oil from Are you feeling alright now Paint myself all red white blue Are you singing let's fight now Innocent people die, uh oh There are reasons to unite Is this why we unite? If you hate this time Remember we are the time! Show you love your country go out and spend some cash Red white blue hot pants doing it for Uncle Sam Flex our muscles show them we're stronger than the rest Raise your hands up baby are you sure that we're the best? We'll come out with our fists raised The good old boys are back on top again And if we let them lead us blindly The past becomes the future once again  I think everyone should post this somewhere.  Still no calls from Yoshimi P-wee or Naomi Watts. Day 20

      I emailed Thurston Moore yesterday in hopes of meeting Yoshimi somehow and to also tell him how I'm digging the new Sonic Youth record.  It comes out today so go buy it and the DVD.  So hopefully the guy posing as Thurston will know how to get ahold of someone posing as Yoshimi.  Speaking of Asian girls I saw one from my past last night.  Broke my heart again.  Especially since she looked at me like I was literally a ghost from her past that she didn't want to acknowledge.  I was something scary that she didn't even have the nerve to say hi to, instead cast an evil glare my way.  I didn't think I ever did anything wrong between us, but I guess I did. I'm telling ya I'm a ghost. Plain and simple.  Instead of Sonic Nurse, I should be listening to NYC Ghosts & Flowers.  Trans Am rocked so awesome last night.  Lisa & I were dancing up a storm, I haven't felt that worked up about a show since, well, not that long ago, but it was intense none the less. They were supersuper tight.  They're playing down in Brooklyn on Friday Matt, you should go see them.  Vocoders are sweet.  So I think I might have given myself a concussion when I was rocking out to the Walkmen on Saturday.  Gonna go to the doctor tomorrow to find out for sure.  Gotta love self online diagnosis.  I've made myself think I've had everything from HIV, to Cancer, to emphysema, to diabetes, to a brain tumor, all because I feel the need to self diagnose.  Everytime it ends up being nothing, just my hyprocondriac self I discovered in high school psychology class.  "Can't you hearing me beating on your door?"  Jacob said I was able to sync up Fantasia and a CD even when I was blacked out.  I am a media genius.  Physical therapy tonight, Interfuse practice, Cigarettes and Sleep, wish I could ride a bike or go fishing.  Still no calls from Yoshimi P-wee or Naomi Watts. Day 2784

      Ghosts & Bourbon just do not mix.  So I've seen three Civil War soldiers in my back yard before and decided on Saturday night to go "ghost huntin" mostly because Jacob was with me.  Well, me and him stood there trying to talk to them, Matti taking pictures.  Next thing I remember, I blackout and I'm at the bottom of a ravine.  Matti & Mike said it was like I was there one second and then gone.  I don't remember much after that, I came too later that night when I was beating my head on the floor and trying to convince Mike Oravec that he could levitate.  Crazyness.  I'm guessing it was because I drank too much that I blacked out right then. But I saw shadows in my bed room last night.  Maybe that was because my body was still recovering.  "Everyone that once pretended to like me is gone..."  That's what I say to all my "friends" who didn't show up at the party.  I'm tired of so called "friends" who say they'll call you back but either don't or instead tell you they're tired or not allowed to do anything.  We aren't middle aged and we don't have families.  We're still young and vibrant.  I still hang out even though my body feels like I'm 57 years old every morning.  I'll go out of my way sometimes to hang out with my friends.  I wear myself thin but I still do my best.  I know people change, but when you at least make the attempt to stay close, you can remain brothers for life.  But also if you burn me once, most likely you'll never be able to find your way back into my heart.  I burn twice as long.  Otherwise song lyrics start to come true.  I've gotta get past that though and realize that I'm 25 years old and I need to quit trying to make friends.  The friends I have are the ones who I don't have to question their friendship to me.    I don't know, maybe I'm a ghost.  http://theshadowlands.net/ghost/sleep.htm

      As posted on www.WOXY.com  Kind fate has sent us two dedicated listeners with the vision and courage to step up as partners to fund the continued broadcast of 97X The Future of Rock and Roll over the Internet.  These magnanimous folks want to remain anonymous, but they feel passionately about "doing the right thing" and "doing good work," and we are the lucky recipients of their generous spirit.  Like Phoenix rising from the ashes, 97X - just as we have always loved it - will be returning soon. It will take us a few weeks to get set up for the future, but be assured that Mike and Barb and Shiv and Bryan Jay are already hard at work to bring it all back.   Keep checking woxy.com for updates ... we'll announce an air date just as soon as we know it.  Give a little shout of thanks to our "angels" - and stay tuned   RADDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD!!!!!!!

      Mars Volta Day 2  I've also been listening to Sonic Nurse yet again and Clutch's new one Blast Tyrant.  So lets see, I've got some latin, noise, prog, roots, big rock sounds in my head with Getty Lee singing.    I hate FTP and I hate web servers and the technicians who you can only "email" when you need help.  My boss is gonna love the news I give him when he gets back tomorrow.  Now onto the lovely world of SQL.  No press is good press?  Yeah, even after Lisa's hard work, nothing showed up in any of the papers.  Looks like the Rubber City Rebels stole our thunder yet again.    Tarulli got back from Bonnaroo yesterday.  He's all tan and stuff and kinda sick.  I hate hot practices with the Whips because I become the annoying one who wants to just blow through the set and talk shit about a song being flat just because I'm sweaty and want to go home.  The music doesn't deserve that.  Since my Gibson SG guitar has been gone I've been playing my old school broke down one pick up Fender Strat at Interfuse practice and borrowing Mike's Gibson every other practice.  Once again if anyone sees my SG, please tell it to come home.  I just found out it's gonna cost me like 50 bucks to fix the little nut on my little 100 dollar epiphone.  Luckily Mike Stangelo aka: Jake Coxx is cool enough to offer me his Tele without me even asking.  He's a rad bro.  I have a problem with attention, I'm having trouble maintaining it.  Last night I was able to sleep in my bed.  But only after taking two Tylenol PM's and two tall Jack & Sprites (I know I'm a sissy boy).  Fell asleep on the couch watching the Pavement DVD and then woke up around 2:30 and went to my own bed in a dream/stupor.  Luckily I think my mind was shutdown because the next thing I know I was waking up at 7:00am to the sound of Shellac.  I bet IBC Black Cherry would taste real good with Jack.  I'm addicted to IBC's cherry and their cream soda right now so if anyone wants to send some my way, I'll love you for life.  Actually, I think I'll love anyone for life right now, or at least make them think that for a night.  Then claim it was all a part of a past life in the morning.  Since I kinda believe in it, here's the ones I've figured out:  In a past life I think I was...  a Civil War Soldier Fighting on the side of the South, Sailor in the South Pacific, Soldier in Vietnam Special Forces, black woman from the Bayou.  What about you?  Still no calls from Yoshimi P-wee or Naomi Watts. Day 27

      I've been listening to Mars Volta non-stop yet again since last night.  I couldn't find my Failure CD, I think its somewhere in my truck, but not sure in which case.  My ex-girlfriend bought me a sweet case to keep all my CD's in, but I've overloaded it and now also have another CD case and my buddy Joel's case too.  Way to much music.  Mars Volta blows my mind, I hated it when I first heard it though.  It sounded like a bunch of noise with Getty Lee singing over it.  "what about the voice of Getty Lee, How did it get so high? I wonder if he speaks like an ordinary guy"...  I accomplished alot yesterday.  Washed the Interfuse van, ate some spinach, went to Interfuse practice.  It was our last practice before Friday's show and it's looking like we're going to get to play all three new ones.  Unfortunately with the way Interfuse works, we probably won't.  I wish it was different, that we weren't worried about things always being perfect, making it almost sterile at times, but I guess a tight band rocks a lot harder than a mess.  Punk rock songs still give me chills when their loud, no matter what's being played.  We've been trying to get alot ("we" meaning mostly Lisa, much props to her) of press and cool things done for this show so hopefully that all falls in line and people come out to the show.  It's been awhile since we played out and I'm looking to destroy the Spider and get some asses shakin.    The biggest thing to hit Akron in the past, probably 5 years, is also going on Friday.  None other than Mr. Ian Mackaye is playing at Square Records with his new band the Even's.  I hope its an early show and I can get down there to see them before we play.  That's so weird to be like..."yeah I'm gonna run down to the record store and go see Ian, then I'll be back to get with the people and play some rock n' roll".  Rumor has it that he might stop by the Spider, which would be awesome, especially since Donnie is having a benefit upstairs.  I slept with the light on again last night...  To all who are trying to call, I'm too broke to pay my cell phone right now, so call the homestead if you need to get ahold of me.  Um, well I think that's all I've got today, Tight Whips are gonna have a full practice tonight for the first time since Athens.  We play Sunday @ the Spider if anyone wants to come out.  "I'm a loner Dottie...You don't want to get mixed up with a guy like me."  P-wee's Big Adventure + Fugazi's Red Medicine = Amazing  Still no calls from Yoshimi P-wee or Naomi Watts.

      So yeah, I just read my first Ginsburg piece.  It was strange, I felt myself almost screaming some of the lines without even knowing them.  I read Hunter S. back when I was in High School, as I think most every other outcast/partier/questioner/rock n' roller did back then.  I read my first one on a plane to Arizona when I was 16, I don't think I really comprehended what I was reading though.  But maybe that's why I was so excited about the Belmont Stakes race a couple weeks ago.   Have you ever missed someone or something so much it's getting to the point where your about to be like, fuck it, I'm broke, I have no vacation, I have responsibilities, why not drive 7 1/2 hours, kidnap someone, and then travel to the Black Mountains, or Wyoming or Montana or Nevada, Utah, or Rhode Island?  I'm about there.  I want to live off the land, I want to be someone not bound by anything.  I want to be able to say to myself...today I will stand naked in the forest (well I kind of already do that), but I digress, I need adventure again.  I need to feel hot sand under my feet, I need to feel pine needles between my toes, I need to feel the glow of an orange tree on a San Diego side street, I need to hear the sound of jet planes over traffic, I need to feel the rush of a 6 Train, I need to feel the pressure of being at the bottom of the deep end with an deflated innertube, I need to feel like myself.  Like no one else.  Like everyone else.  Like no one else.  Homeward Bound.  Still no calls from Yoshimi P-wee or Naomi Watts. Day 25  25 such an ugly number

      And so I walked upstairs, and spit in my notebook, the ghosts are still here, this is what I wanted, this is what I never want, if this is what I’m given, this is what I’ll never give, I’ll keep from thinking, I keep it buried inside, I’ve told my secrets, they’ve come back again, and my girlfriend is calling me with a long winded cry, saying I’m doing something I’ve never really tried, and I’m just a teenager, I’m a basement headcase and my parents are sleeping, my parents are sleeping.  I remember being by the stereo last, talking to my self not making sense, and I’m watching TV, then standing outside, naked in the winter air, in a kind of Promised Land, and I’m sneaking out, when my parents are sleeping, my parents are sleeping.  Who do you know?  But it will all fade, when I craw down the hill, pushed by something, under my own will.  Who do you know?  My parents were sleeping.  Who do you know?  They keep on asking.  Who do you know?  I keep from yelling.  So who do you know? They keep on crying.  Where did you go?  I am the ghost.  I still see your ghost.  I still see your ghost.  Just take the picture.  I still feel your ghost.  Just take my picture.  Repeat as necessary.

      I went to Detroit on Friday to meet with potential customers.  It was a good trip but a long drive.  It rained the whole way to Detroit and the whole way home.  I got a few laughs out of my boss when he asked me what I thought about this year’s upcoming election.  Luckily, like me, he's an NPR junkie.  Or at least I think he is.  I think he might listen to it only as background music to keep himself sane.  Which anymore is probably why I listen too.  I quit listening to Art Belle and George Noorey on Coast to Coast as of last Thursday because I was getting way too freaked out.    After work on Friday, I fell asleep on the couch for a couple hours before Interfuse practice.  I wish I had just stayed awake though.  I don't know if it was because I had been up since 4AM, the drive to Detroit or what, but the old hag came to visit.  This time it was really weird though.  I fell asleep on the futon, but swore I could see myself over on the couch.  I wouldn't call it an out of body experience or anything, since it seemed like I was totally awake.  I tried to move, but couldn't, I tried to wake myself up but couldn't even raise my head.  Then, Friday night I saw shadows on my bedroom wall, three of course, and proceeded to scare myself enough to get out of bed and go sleep on the couch.  I tried to pull my covers up over my head, and make sure my feet were pulled far enough under the blankets so nothing could get me.  Unfortunately I kept having the sense that something was hovering over me.   Finally, last night I went to bed around 1:15 trying to make myself self-super tired so I would fall asleep.  The lightning was turning my walls into a scene straight from Poltergeist, so I just closed my eyes.  I kept thinking about spirits even though I didn't want to.  When I silently told my self I was just imagining it, my bedroom door slammed shut. ughh. It was probably the wind, but it happened right when I was doubting there was any such spirit there.  Of course my mind was racing even more and I kept saying the same thing I've been saying ever since I was by myself on the bike path last Wednesday.  "God is with me, God is great, God is by my side". Repeat. What the hell that all means I have no idea.  I don't normally pray and if I do, they aren't that cheesy. The prayer doesn't make things stop, but it at least gives me time to get out of my room or in the case of the bike path, to my truck.  Reasons I'm probably seeing and feeling all this stuff: -I've been eating chocolate mocha almond ice cream before bed -Everyone goes to bed before me now so I'm by myself -Stress -I'm going crazy because I'm at the same point in my life Stanz told me about when he moved out of our place in Kent and I thought he was just being a jerk. -Stress -Concussion -I haven't listened to the Carpenters in awhile and left my guardian angel photo of Karen on our bar counter in the basement.  If it is the last thing, that sucks, because as of right now I'm too scared to even go down to the basement.   I'll post lyrics from the newest Interfuse song here soon.  It's probably one of my best since First Words.  I think I captured a moment, but it's just adding to how freaked out I am about my mental state.    Speaking of bar-twacked, this movie is a great example...I watched it over at Wes's Saturday.  Oh and Suran Song in Stag are an awesome band, check em out.  http://www.kfccinema.com/reviews/comedy/katakuris/katakuris.html   Still no calls from Yoshimi P-wee or Naomi Watts.

      As I told Matt, I'm seeing ghost cats now as well.  It probably didn't helpt that I watched Interview with the Vampire last night. I started thinking to myself... what if I'm a vampire?  Maybe that's why I'm so tired in the morning and I've been wearing sunglasses a lot more.  Just like Mike in the Lost Boys.  I've always wanted to be Corey Haim or Kiefer Sutherland though.  I used to play Lost Boys on the playground in elementary school.  I was always David, always.  I chased all the girls around and then my fellow blood suckers would return to our "cave" (a wood jungle gym) and hang upside down until one Jennifer McDonald would walk by.  She was my Jaimie Gertz.  Taller than me, with long brown hair, and anymore, any face I want her to have.  Then I would go home and play Nightmare on Elm Street with my best friend Jason (Stage name: Suzan).  We'd chase his sisters around and then go down in his basement, play G.I. Joe and listen to Janet Jackson, Salt n' Pepa, and Madonna.  Yeah, try explaining that when your trying to sort yourself out when your mind is all fucked up because of puberty.  No wonder my mom found all the beer bottles I hid in my speakers and drums.  I tried to drink that out of my system... please tell me I didn't like Janet Jackson, I'm Punk Rock.  I still love Madonna, Salt n' Pepa's first tape rox, but Janet, I'm sorry she bores me now.  Michael Moore, Michael Moore, Michael Moore Marsha, Marsha, Marsha  Yeah, I'm gonna be part of the masses going to see his movie.  At this moment I would like to quote L7:  The Masses Are Asses. I'm still a skeptic when I watch his movies, but I appreciate what he does.  Unfortunately I think there will be too many people who watch this movie and then turn around and let it think for them.  It go two ways in that respect.    Here's my anology:  The jock that liked Rage Against Machine, they were so in to the testosterone chaos and power of RATM that they never actually listened to the lyrics.  They were the same guys that beat down a ten year old at my first Nirvana concert. They'll be the same ones that hail the movie as "the coolest" thing ever, and then still vote for Bush, because you know, faggots aren't cool.    Then there's the other side:  The kid who gets so rapped up in reciting RATM lyrics that they start acting them out.  But instead of taking the lyrics and looking at them objectively, they start becoming a RATM satire.  A walking De La Rocha puppet. No independent thoughts, just a robot, the one that Zack warned about.  So I hope the masses are smart enough to listen and digest before they regurgitate.  Ed Killed Our Virus!!  I aint afraid of no ghost.  "The fascination with Canada is normal for Americans if only because if you lived next door to a freak you’d want to peak through his window every now and then." - Steve Albini  We oughta name this song after you: call it "Canada". Imagine a country so blue, backwards it's adanac. I'm at a loss for words explaining the sentiments. prized substance - you invented it.  Imagine there was a time your cigar was ironic. You've been at it so long, it's chronic.  We oughta name this song after you: call it "Canada". Imagine a country so blue, backwards it's adanac. - Shellac from Terraform  Still no calls from Yoshimi P-wee or Naomi Watts. Day 35 (It's a good think I can still count).

      I love Donita Sparks, Jennifer Finch however, can take her band and "Shove" it.  I was a sad sad boy last night.  I was all excited at first, Nick's birthday, Jennifer playing at the Spider! Then I get down there and they moved her show to Peabody's.  Cleveland wins again.  I did have fun though, I proved that I am the hardest hitting air-drummer in Akron, though Lisa only gave me a 6.5.  I missed one of my triplets on QOTSA "Six Barrel".  And though I caught a bunch of slack for it, I had alot of fun talking to Matt from Totally Awesome and Malcolm.  I was able to hold my own in a downright full on musical argument. The argument was "what bands have been around for 15 years and consistently put out good albums?".  It's not as easy as it seems because the Rolling Stones for example don't make it. The bands can't put out crap at all, even after 15 years.  My favorite addition was Mike Watt and Steve Albini (solo artists could be included)and of course the Boredoms.  Malcolm beat me to the Melvins though.  You name em, we probably had them on the list.  I'm a little hungover today, but that's nothing a good nap won't fix.    Wow it's only 9:37.    Still no calls from Yoshimi P-wee or Naomi Watts. Day 284

      So its Sunday and I'm at work listening to Turbo Negro.  We were supposed to go eat at 5:00 for Father's Day, but my Dad strangely backed out.  No reason, just said today was a bad day.  Don't know what to really say.  I'm a jerk for a son in all actuality.  I see my dad maybe once a month.  Mostly because I can't really deal with how emotional he is when I see him.  Unfortunately I think he thinks that every time we're together, it's the last time he's going to see me, and that he'll die the next day.  The shots he gets for his treatment make him that way my mom says.  Still its hard and I don't really know how to handle it.  I just want to hang out with him, as a friend, and not have him tell me "to be careful" or for him to ask me if I'm feeling alright.  If I'm sick, I let people know, when I feel good I don't want to even think about questioning it.  Maybe it's that he wants me to ask him the same thing, which I'll never do, because I get a prepared answer..."I'm hanging in there".  As for our show on Friday.  I had fun, I had a whole lot of fun.  We played sloppy and I don't care.  Interfuse has begun a new chapter.  We actually played things in songs that weren't there originally (aka jammed) and it worked.  The new songs went well, the still untitled one totally fucked with my mental state, especially since Jacob, my spiritual advisor of sorts, was right there in front.  Dan the man came up and sang the chorus to one of the new ones...YOUNGBLOODS!! and Jacob played guitar on our impromptu version of The Chicken Song.  Last thing I remember is being shocked by the mic about 5 times and ending up with my head next to my amp and grinding it into the floor screaming something, I can't remember what it was but it felt good.  Joanne looked real scared when I came out into the crowd and jumped on the bar, Larry flicked me off, and I think another guy thought I was flirting with either his girlfriend or him, well maybe both, but I had a rock show to put on so I was flirting with the whole crowd.  Hoping someone would "take me home".  God I love rock n' roll.    I spent the night at home last night drinking a bunch of beers and listening to L7, got the strobe lights out and pretended I was Donita Sparks.  Is that considered doing drag?  I wasn't dressed up or anything, but I did wish I had her gold teeth.  Oooh, Jennifer Finch is playing at the Lime Spider on Tuesday, I'm so there.  I asked them to put it in the contract that she has to stay at my house, in my bed.  And that she's supposed to "have her way with me".  That would be supa sweet.  Tight Whips tonight, neu songs!    Still no calls from Yoshimi P-wee or Naomi Watts. Day twenty something

      I wish I was a fishing fiend.  Some say it's a mental game.  I'm superstitious.  Some say its in the technique.  I'm casting at the moon.  I've always been afraid I'll be the lost soul on midnight covered lake waters.  That every sunrise, my ghost will be there. Forever casting for the one that got away. O' Fortuna.  Let's play Ink & Dagger.  You'll see my shadow wavering like fumes.  Cast one, cast two, there's been a cast of hundreds but still no one to play my part.  Casting call.  Open casting call.  This is my Ashok Farewell I tell myself.  Something new when everything is old.  If I can sleep for fifteen more minutes will I still feel the same?  Anymore my friends are the waters edge.  I leave and then return, like clock work. Never really getting to know them anymore.  They've all become strangers.  When I need them most I'm washing them away.  To the ones that are there, I'm just looking for a bite, one chance to just be myself again.  Myself, not an iron clad, a stately ship of seasons to risk.  The constantine.  The shipwrecked. I'm circling around because I won't speak. Engulfed in barnacles in the stream of consciousness.

      Yes it's true.  I've decided not to live with scar tissue on my spine.  I talked to a bunch of people and read up on the possible outcomes.  It doesn't look good.  I think I figured out a cure.  Probably won't be able to run for the rest of my life though.   I discovered today that I could have a full conversation with someone by just quoting lyrics from songs.  How sad is that?  I can't even think on my own anymore.  Music has totally wormed its way into my brain waves.  So much so that i've been having debates with myself about the perfect album and right now Botch - We Are The Romans comes to mind.  I can't even drive without jerking my neck back into the seat because of the albums power.    Tonights gonna be a blast, if the house of cards doesn't fall down.

      I'm even kinda bored with that paper, so I'm probably not gonna publish the rest.  Email me though if you want to read it and I'll send it your way.    Do I slice & dice? That's the big question giving my ulcer a work out right now.  Back surgery or no back surgery?  Pain or no pain?  I much rather enjoy being able to sleep the night through then dealing with waking up every two hours because of the pain.  And I hate having to drink just to fall asleep.  Has anybody ever had the micro-disectomy surgery?  Actually I think I'm too broke to be able to take the time off work. This sucks.  How's your day?  Naomi & Yoshimi dont care

      Each frequency has its own distinct demographic however.  For instance, if a political party felt that its candidate needed to appeal to the agricultural sector of the population, the choice of media would seem much easier than it actually is.  FM country stations may seem like the most logical choice, due to the large amount of listeners, however FM country stations have a very broad demographic of listeners who are most likely not connected to rural life.  To reach a much more targeted agricultural voter, the buyer would really want to look at the AM frequency.  The ratings for AM stations have shown that the listeners are usually loyal listeners and are in all likelihood more interested in the agricultural issues affecting them than their urban counterparts.  Many of the listeners live in rural areas and may be farmers or connected to the farming community.  Farmers who drive pickup trucks most likely have older trucks where there is only one frequency choice on their radio.  This frequency is more times than not the AM frequency.  The narrowcasted demographic combined with the benefits brought by being loyal listeners would provide the best outlet for the candidate’s message (Steinberg 142).  This choice needs to be highlighted in the radio marketing process because according to Tony Schwartz, a much respected radio ad creator and president of Schwartz Media Project, radio is often labeled as broadcasting, but should really be thought of as narrowcasting (Schwartz). Once the station selection has been made, the actual promotion decision needs to be made by the party’s marketing team and it also involves the principle of price.  There are two ways for a candidate to get their message over the airwaves, a spot can either be bought or work may be done to get the message through free of any money exchange.  The latter, is accomplished through a coordinated effort to receive free coverage on radio news programs.  This advertising is considered to be any form of mass communication that a campaign can use without offering direct support from campaign funds to the broadcasting station or media representative (Newman).  This may be accomplished through public relations or other tactics.  However, this type of message is rarely controllable.  Still, if the means to secure free coverage is used correctly, it can be a cost saving way to present a candidate’s message to many more listeners than a party’s funding could supply alone.  Once a message goes through the pathway of free media, it is hard to control.  The difficulty arises from variations that appear each time a different station picks up the political message.  The message needs to be reinforced by the candidate each time they speak.  Along the campaign trail candidates can lose sight of this and allow for their message to be distorted or watered down by the time it reaches the target audience.  The distortion may come from a reporter or a misheard statement by the radio listeners.  In the same manner, listener may hear a story about the candidate on the way to work in the morning and decide one way of voting, but if there is another story that same day during the afternoon drive time, the voter may change their mind.  Political parties see radio campaigns as a voting cue for prospective voters, so the cue must be able to show a difference between the candidates.  This point not only applies to radio, but moreover applies to the full media spectrum, so a candidate needs to beat their message in to the ground.  One way that parties can remove the variation is by having their own studios in which they can create their own spots or commentary, which is then passed onto radio stations’ news departments for use in a news segment.  The political party’s production studios will often create sound bites that can be later broadcast in news segments.  These sound bites can effectively describe the candidate’s views in eight to ten seconds (Newman 147).

      August 11, 2003  From talk shows to news reports to special interest programming, radio encompasses many realms of the relationship between political parties and the voting public.  Radio waves are everywhere around us.  So it is understandable that radio is often a utilized resource for political parties in their electoral campaigns.  Today, political parties use radio as a key factor in their campaign marketing strategies for the advertising medium.  Likewise, radio is increasingly becoming a major priority for legislative decisions in political campaign spending.  Still, the effectiveness of radio is only as measurable as the quality of surveys and the individual listener’s willingness to accurately report their listening behavior.  Marketing and Political Radio Advertisements Radio has always been an important part of a political party’s marketing team and the media plan they use to win office for an individual candidate.  In political campaigns, radio can help to reach a narrower demographic of voters at an inexpensive price through a variety of techniques.  The efficiency and targeted audience that radio brings can provide beneficial results from the choices made by political media buyers.  Radio works well with the marketing principles of placement, price and promotion. One element of radio as a marketing tool, the marketing principle of placement is especially crucial for campaign consultants and political media buyers.  Their decisions regarding the best stations and path where a political ad will be heard have a direct link to the campaign’s success.  As an example, the talk radio stations alone offer a wide range of specific demographics that a buyer can choose from.  Today’s talk radio formats are programmed for Republicans, Democrats, radical liberals, fundamentalist Christians, national news, local news, social issues and sports.  These stations can be found on the FM side of the broadcasting frequency or on the AM side.

      I wish I was C-Lo Green. He's a sweet rapping machine.   I went out last night with Nick, Lisa, Mike, Charlie, Adam and the boys from some LA Band who you've probably heard on the radio. We hit all the Akron spots, first Northside. The place was dead. So I did my best Iggy Pop imitations while the cover band was playing the stones. Next we went to Thursday's, aka Slursdays. Probably the most fun I've had there since Stansberry lived down the street. I got my groove on to the Faint and then The Breeders "Last Splash" right afterwards. My dance partners throughout the night included Lisa and Stephanie the old bar tender from the Spider, Old School Diana, and none other than Mr. Brad of D.T. fame. I couldn't dance real hard because of my back, but I broke it down. And somehow managed to mess up my foot. Awesome.&nbsp; It's all swollen and throbbing today. Bet it's broken.   Next we went to the Touch of Class strip club. There was a beautiful girl behind the bar that was all smiles and then a total bitch at the same time, just the kind of girl I love. She had that Pocahantas complexion with a southern European face.&nbsp; Charlie jokingly told her that Mike &amp; I were lovers, I thought she would get the joke, but I was wrong and that ruined my chances of being able to spit game. We went back to Nick &amp; Lisa's where I ate veggie burgers and hotdogs and cried about having to go to work this morning. They're all on vacation. And Lisa got her Masters. Master puddin.    Bizarro, I love you. Let me help, let me help, I'm helping, I'm helping

      Last nights show went great.&nbsp; We played hard, rocked out, and turned Annabelle's into a full on house party.&nbsp; At least that's what it felt like to me.&nbsp; Everyone stood about 15 feet back of course, but it was still crazy.&nbsp; I fell (beer throwing makes for wet floors) and it felt great.&nbsp; Until I had to get back up.&nbsp; It was pretty intense.&nbsp; I was enjoying a rock n' roll high.  Then the phone call came.&nbsp;   Akins called me to let me know that Amanda was down at Akron General in ICU.&nbsp; I guess she was on the back of a 4-wheeler and got thrown when the kid she was riding with hit a sign.&nbsp; Hundog and I are hopefully going to get to go down there later this afternoon, they're taking her out of ICU which is some good news.&nbsp; She'll make it, but it's gonna be a long rough road ahead.  It's strange how our lives are interweaved (cousins, weddings, funerals, friends) and this was something that broke my heart.&nbsp; I totally felt and still do feel helpless.&nbsp; Especially last night.&nbsp; There's a dent in the van from a foot to the wheel well.&nbsp; And a bunch of tears in Annabelle's parking lot.&nbsp; I care about her a whole lot even though we don't talk as much as I'm sure we both mean to and&nbsp;she'll always be a part of my soul in so many ways.&nbsp;&nbsp; And I vow from here on out, to be there for her along the way if she ever needs me.&nbsp; She's tough.&nbsp;

      Tonight we're playing at Annabelle's.&nbsp; The first time in about 3 years I think.&nbsp; It should be a good time.&nbsp; As Ricky told Lisa, "we'll just see what happens".&nbsp; I'm gonna have a good time, most likely no matter how we play.&nbsp; It's about having fun, and that's why I play.&nbsp;   Lets see, this week I've dealt with a bunch of computer viruses, seeing what I thought was a ghost hand next to me at Kevin O'brians pub (I'm pretty sure it was a good ghost), slept with my lights on again, cleaned our company parking lot (obsessive compulsive), talked to my mom and dad, got to hang out with my best friend again and it was cool this time, saw some great videos on Vh1 classic (ie: prince, world party, sly fox,&nbsp;concrete blonde, ministry), watched the Assistant and fell in love with it (I still hate reality shows though), bounced a check, got a cash loan, um, rocked out with Chris from Sofa King Killer and the Tight Whips, washed my hair with mint J. Crew conditionere I found in the back of the bathroom closet, discovered I have a drinking problem (yet again), smoked too many cigarettes, and rooted for Lance Armstrong.&nbsp;   What else should I be doing?  Oh yeah, working.&nbsp; Bawk Bawk.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;

      Beer & Blogs don't mix, thus my last post.&nbsp; That's some pathetic stuff.&nbsp; I was so topsy, I was trying to tell some girl that I was a centauri from alpha quazar something or other and that I could see that she had a good soul.&nbsp; I guess it worked, cuz I got her number, ha.

      Now I find myself here at this hour.&nbsp; I think to myself as my supposed bestfriend speaks, at length about stickging together, but the drinks come into play, is this why I care about people, is this why I try to have and nurture my connections with people.&nbsp; I have a soul.&nbsp; Yeah its jaded, but still it connects.&nbsp; It's my downfall, its my reason for questioning.&nbsp; My self degradation for needing a hair cut is nothing more than an inner struggle for righting what I've deemed myself to believe is wrong.  The computer beeps.&nbsp; The computer isn't fast enough for the engulfing wave of self disguise.&nbsp; Maybe if I lived in California, I could fake the way I feel.&nbsp; I could believe the jadedness is all a city of hills,winding roads and, well I don't know.&nbsp;&nbsp; I'll never feel at home there.&nbsp; I'll never feel at home anywhere.&nbsp; Because, you know what.&nbsp; I'll never feel at home with myself.

      Tonight we're going camping down in Mohican.&nbsp; Stangelo is riding either with me or driving his truck cuz it's a sweet old chevy.&nbsp; I'm gonna get my mom's kayak (yeah my mom's) and her air mattress and make my way down there.&nbsp; I'm such a weirdo that I picked out clothes that are army green.&nbsp; I'm hoping to find some camoflage paint for under my eyes , a big knife, and flares.&nbsp; I should be in movies, or maybe porn, because I&nbsp;have this thing about&nbsp;dressing up.&nbsp; Be it a cowboy, soldier,&nbsp;soccer player, German beer drinker, business man, junior high school coach complete with Rawlings coach shorts that are too tight, etc.&nbsp; It's weird I tell you.&nbsp; I probably need to seek help.&nbsp; Stanz will be there in spirit, maybe I'll catch some guppies in his honor.   I'm hoping I'll just be able to relax but we'll see what happens.&nbsp; My jaw is still killing me and the medicine I was taking makes me feel really wasted, so I quit taking it today.&nbsp; Then it started raining and every bone in my body that I've broken is killing me.&nbsp; Blah blah whine whine whine.  Doctor said to quit smoking and quit drinking.&nbsp; I guess he knows something I don't, but wouldn't tell me.&nbsp;   Sing along with me this weekend...   Get off my ass you wee bitty fuck  If I pull out the claymore you’re shit outta luck  Who’s that girl, that pretty young thing  After I fuck her she’ll get up and sing   Aye aye aye -- sharpen your boot, and bludgeon your eye  Aye aye aye -- the blarney stone brings a tear to me eye   Down to the pub for a two shilling ale  The bread on the counter is going stale  If I don’t get some fresh bread soon  Gonna punch you in your face and bark at the moon   Aye aye aye -- sharpen your boot, and bludgeon your eye  Aye aye aye -- the blarney stone brings a tear to me eye   Ain’t got no girl ’cuz I haven’t the time  Got too many other things on me mind  Patty was nice she was pale and cute  But I threw her away like an old piece of fruit   Aye aye aye -- sharpen your boot, and bludgeon your eye  Aye aye aye -- the blarney stone brings a tear to me eye   Got ooze in my pores my feet are all wet  Got mold in my ears but I ain’t dead yet  Got stones in me bladder got a crack in me head  When patty starts cryin’ this is what I said   Aye aye aye -- sharpen your boot, and bludgeon your eye  Aye aye aye -- the blarney stone brings a tear to me eye   ...not really a camping song but you get the idea.&nbsp; Peace and chicken grease.&nbsp; I love you all if the woods swallow me like in this video (I swear this video will be my life in someways) :    urlLink http://www.bjork.com/videogallery/    Check out "Bachelorette"   &nbsp;

      The economy still sucks, and I had to threaten someone in to going camping.&nbsp; Well not exactly threaten, but convince them that... as they said in The Shining..."You're money is no good here doc".&nbsp; I always loved that line, and that scene was so creepy.  Sometimes when I'm downstairs at our lil' bar, I imagine that movie and that there are all these guests in our basement and we're&nbsp; having a party.&nbsp; Sam Cooke or maybe even Ethel James on the stereo and everyone dressed in 1920's clothing with&nbsp;free booze flowin from a fountain where the furnace used to be,&nbsp;wild swinging sex&nbsp;happenin on the pool table and by the TV, casino games and screaming from everywhere and all my friends being like, damn, this is a good party.&nbsp; Girls dressed in white dresses running past me up the steps&nbsp;and then out the&nbsp;tornado shelter doors and into our side yard.&nbsp;&nbsp;The white horse from across the street, gallops and then floats over to the ladies, they all stop and stare at me with confused but fulfilled eyes.&nbsp; Someone else compliments me on my style and the&nbsp;airs with which I gaze&nbsp;over my creation.&nbsp; I smoke my cigarette with just enough of a drag to make the end light up the corner of the room&nbsp;where I am&nbsp;standing, as I simply say...I know, I know.&nbsp;&nbsp;   My tribute to the Great Gatsby.  Jaw pain is the worse and insurance companies take the cake.&nbsp; Why is it that I had to spend two hours on the phone today, just to get an appointment to get my jaw looked at.&nbsp; It's probably broken.&nbsp; I had to call this company, then that company, this doctor than that doctor, our HR person who was like "well you're in the system I know we put you in the system" and then was like "you know I guess we didn't choose you're provider already", but it's not her fault because I was supposed to have done that when I signed up, smooth Sean, smooth... so then I had to call this person and then that doctor, have them fax this and call so and so and I'm still waiting for an appointment time.&nbsp; At Sears Dental of all places.&nbsp; Give me my brown cordaroys and a bowl haircut and a yellow shirt.&nbsp; For some reason when I think of Sears, I always think 70's and I always think of brown clothes.&nbsp; I should by a pair of tight jeans while I'm there.&nbsp; You know, make my junk look good.  4:37 PM Just got a call that the dental insurance company skrewed up and I probably won't see the dentist until September 1st.&nbsp; Fuck that.&nbsp; I'm in pain man.&nbsp; I started taking my "chronic pain" meds again and now I'm seeing double and feeling dizzy and my jaw still hurts (TMJ is a bitch).&nbsp; At least my back is feeling good today.&nbsp;   Amanda's doing good, surgery went awesome from what I hear and she's regained full motion in her hands which is great news.&nbsp; I haven't heard many details so, when I find out more I'll let everyone know.&nbsp; I'm going down to see her tommorrow.  &nbsp;

      This morning I spilled blood on Franklin Ave.  Thanks to a cat I felt bad for.  Actually it was more like an in-betweener. In between a Kitten and a Cat. As anyone who has lived in Kent knows, there are cats all over the freaking place. I was driving to work this morning, down Franklin by Mugs and the Pufferbelly and saw something in the road. No other cars were stopping, but when I looked down as I drove past, I saw the saddest eyes in the world staring up at me. So of course I stopped to see what I could do. The little guy was hurt for sure, so I decided I'd drive him to the hospital. When I reached for him, he was so scared he didn't know what to do but defend himself. Just like that, my hand was pretty much gushing blood from my thumb. The little bugger had latched on to it with his teeth and wouldn't let go. I put him back down as fast as I could, just as another car drove past me, everyone staring like I was some kind of idiot.  Well I was, as seen by my $20.00 doctor's bill for a t-shot.  Om Mani Perdme Om Mr. Kitty.  Camping, well, awesome definitely comes to mind.  I'm pretty sure I was the most annoying drunk for pretty much the whole trip, but I got some shit off my chest and some air in my lungs.  Lets see... Friday night, after about 20 beers and a bottle of wine and some really good whiskey (Matti's the man), I decided I wanted to see everyone naked, so around 2:30am I figured we should jump in the fast moving rained out Mohican river.  Sounded like a good idea to me.  I'm not so sure if it was actually my idea, but that's sounds like something I would do.  My drunk ass almost drowned and it felt like that scene from Poltergeist where she's in the pool and all of the skeletons and stuff.  I was a muddy mess running around in my underwear, because you know, I'm sweet like that.  Then I tried to talk Matti into letting me "float away" down the stream, but he didn't.  I owe him big time.  I guess I passed out, outside of our tent still in my underwear, yelling for Jamin who I thought was still in the river.  He was in his tent.  Saturday, we went canoeing, PBR to the head, yelling things I shouldn't mention (something about Science teachers, salads, and things getting tossed) on the bus ride back to the car.  Joanne and Grover were giggling like little girls so of course that kept me going.  Then a real life little 6 year old girl told me to shut-up.  Or as she said...SHUT-UP!!.  Of course I didn't.  Saturday night it rained some more, I drank some more, went swimming again, bawk bawk, hid in the river waiting for canoers to pass by, and found a perfectly square stepping stone like every good suburban house would have in its walkway.  Jacob & Chris showed up.  Chris told me to leave the stone down in the river since it was probably a tombstone, remembering Friday night I agreed.  They hung out for a while then left.  I don't remember much after they left, but I could have sworn I saw everything in the campground on fire and people running around on fire.  It was some scary shit.  I started hyperventilating and stuff as usual, because I was so freaked out.  Matti, Jamin and Jason calmed me down and explained that I was pretty much too wasted for my own good.  I put in some Mike Watt and chilled out with Matti & Jason Whip.  We listened to some Coast to Coast for a while.   It's good to have people like Matti and everyone else there around you, especially for putting up with my drunken bullshit.  Sunday, got home and puked.

      Last night was probably the 2nd best Sonic Youth show, next to the Pontiac show a few years ago.  And I got to go with a great group of friends too and be around an awesome amount of screamers and fellow rock n' rollers.  Cheers Cheers.  And to prove I'm a geek, here is what I listened to today during my 8 hours at work.  In order:  Sonic Youth - Made in USA Sonic Youth - Sister Sonic Youth - Hold That Tiger Sonic Youth - Goo Sonic Youth - Dirty Sonic Youth - Washing Machine Sonic Youth - New York City Ghosts and Flowers  And as NYC Ghosts finishes up, I'm a happy boy, but know I'm gonna go through withdraw.  Gotta listen to Jet Set Trash and No Star Tonight, I learned something awesome linking it to Sister.  If it works I'll let you know.

      I've just witnessed the subversive powers at work in the Blogging Network. I stumbled onto a nondescript blog that purported to be written by a 26 year old woman who was unhappy about the prospect of spending Valentines Day with her girlfriends.The only working links on the site directed me to scarily generic e-mail addresses, e.g. e-mail@e-mail.com and mail@mail.com. Are this phisher addresses designed to hook unsuspecting hornballs onto spam lists? The data collected from sympathetic male bloggers would be priceless to people marketing noodie pix.  Somewhat related: My magazine Today's Facility Manager would like to start a blog. Being the technology columnist, I've been asked to research the feasibility of producing a daily staff written journal that can be commented on by our readers. It's a great idea and I think Fast Company is already doing something like that.

      Altruism is an illusion. We are all consumers, operating in our own self-interests and the interests of those like us. Without the constructs of "good" and "evil" we will have a better perspective to interpret the media's representation of our world. I am not willing to give up the luxuries and conveniences that we Americans consider unalienable rights more than anyone else. What I consume defines who I am. You are your Master Card statement. You are your subscription to The New Yorker. You are your European backpacking vacation. You are your $10 bottle of Shiraz. Are you willing to give up cheap prices at Wal-Mart for someone to have a factory job in Cleveland? We are privileged participants in a finite period of concentrated wealth. So now what?  Nihilism isn’t a lot of fun, unless you’re face down in a pile of blow, surrounded by strippers, and waiting to die. And even then it’s not much fun in the morning. So what should we do to rationalize our existence? Create something that will last beyond personal survival. Try to find some sort of truth. Invent reasons to live. Observe the entropy and reorganization of life. Negative Capacity is the ability to hold contradictory, opposing views in the same mind without the protest of logic or reason; a gift often attributed to William Shakespeare and Walt Whitman. Everyone who has ever doubted existence after death has applied Negative Capacity to get out of bed in the morning. So I might know that I’m just polishing a turd, but I’m going to make that fucker shine.  This is the lens through which I examine the world I see.  I’m fixated on George Bush. Watching him in action is like watching an eighteen wheeler drive off an overpass into traffic. It’s horrible, you feel helpless, and you can’t look away. Americans are angry about the war in Iraq for the wrong reasons. The DNC wants us to assume that President’s primary objective for invading was to secure Iraqi oil production and defense contracts for Halliburton. The Bush administration wants us to believe that we invaded Iraq to depose an "evil" dictator and disarm the threat he posed to America. The problem is that neither of these motives make any sense and that the real underlying incentives aren’t being debated or considered.  George W. Bush assumes that he is making decisions in our country’s best interests. I have no doubt about that. But the lack of information makes it impossible to judge whether this man is actually operating in my best interests.   We’ve spent hundreds of billions of dollars on "Operation Iraqi Freedom". Oil has proven cheaper to buy than it is to steal. Halliburton is one of the only companies in the world that could mobilize and handle the type of reconstruction that is necessary. Should it be a surprise that they were tapped to undertake the project?  Conversely, there were no weapons of mass destruction. The government was in chaos and Saddam Hussein posed no threat to U.S. interests. They had him contained. And if you believe George Bush cares about the Iraqi people you are out of your mind. There are totalitarian regimes all over the world, many of which would more likely justify invasion for humanitarian or security reasons. Iran and North Korea are both nuclear capable and could possibly reach U.S. interests with a bomb, and yet they have been ignored. It’s a shell game.  So why are we in Iraq? That is the question. What is the real reason we are there? The administration assumes that the American people aren’t intelligent enough to know the truth. Are we positioning ourselves to control access to the Persian Gulf to prevent China from becoming the next world superpower? Is the reason to maintain a presence in the Middle East to improve intelligence, using U.S. troops as terrorist bait? Is it something more subtle? I do know that I don’t want George W. Bush to be making decisions for me, based on information I don’t have. I declare this administration a national emergency.

      I've added a couple new things to the site in the last couple days. Please feel free to tag the tagboard. Also, I've created a separate site, specifically for transcripts, recommendations, and reviews of the things I've read in the past week, just click on "Matt's Recommended Reading" to your left. Also, please take the time to answer the poll question I've posted. The E.U. conducted this same survey with controversial results. If there is a country that's not included, put them on the tagboard and I'll update the poll. I'm still ananlyzing the data from my "Isolationist America" survey that I've been performing manually, so be looking for that soon.

      The Akron Scene:  So I'm at this bar in Akron called Thursdays with Mike Carlton, way too late in the night. We're living up old times since we used to live together down the street in a house that should've been condemned. Thursdays is the kind of bar where you can find club drugs, S&M chicks, and really bitter people who think they're "East Village" but deep down realize that they'll always be West Akron. The DJ plays The Smiths, Duran Duran, and the Cure all night. The dance floor lights up and kind of looks like a Rubik's Cube.  So I'm feeling good, I'm wearing my 80 cent sport jacket. I feel urbane, like a man of the world. I edit a magazine. I get paid to write. I'm going to Amsterdam on business. I've got a meeting in New York on Wednesday. I'm dating a gorgeous European woman. I live on the East Coast. I'm cool right? I'm in Akron, Ohio for God's sake. Wrong. Not cool.  Brad Thorla from the band Dolly Trauma is there. He's a beautiful man, balding gracefully. The guy looks great bald. "Do you see that girl over there in the green shirt," he says. When I get too drunk, my attention span gets really short. I kind of nod or whatever, but I don't even look over. "Her name is Zoe. Will you take her this and tell her its from me?" "Sure," I say. I take this beer and stagger onto the dance floor, where a girl in a green shirt is swaying around in a tight circle.  "Are you Zoe?" She says no and doesn't even look up at me. And now I'm standing on this Rubik's Cube with two beers in my hand, wondering if this was actually the girl or not. She probably thinks I'm hitting on her and she definitely thinks I'm an asshole. "Well ok," I say and push the beer at her. "This is from Brad Thorla." She takes it without even looking at me once. I think her name was Zoe. I rock.

      Yesterday, I bought a vintage sport coat and a slick shirt from the 70s at a thrift store. They fit great. In NYC, they would have cost over $100, even at a second hand store. The Ohio price? I paid $1.80. This morning I bought two coffees at a gas station for less than $2. It would have cost twice as much in the city. Cigarettes are $8 a pack in Manhattan, twice what they are in Akron. Theoretically, someone could make killing selling black market cigs. So if I lived in an old farmhouse in the middle of Pennsylvania, down by the Susquehanna, what would my cost of living be like? The ROI on purchasing home office and telecommunications equipment would come through in a month or less.

      So... I don't have much to comment on today. But I would like to redirect all of you readers to my other site: Matt's Recommended Reading. Please click the link to the left and you will find a story I wrote for Weird N.J. Magazine. I think it's worth it.  Also, those of you who have been amusing yourselves with my "End of the World" link, Katie Pontius (PR Superstar at Greystone Partners) recommends reading "On The Beach", a nihilistic novel which explores the same themes as that site. Here's a review:  "In his novel, Shute focuses on a group of ordinary people who wait for the inevitable radioactive fall-out of a devastating nuclear war to arrive in Melbourne, Australia Many critics hailed the book as an insightful and humane cautionary fable. On the Beach continues to sell well for a forty-year-old novel, which suggests that the moral of the story remains relevant today."

      Well "Isolationist America" the results are in from my survey. 30% of those surveyed could not name three foreign world leaders. No suprises there. Winning the name recognition award by a landslide was the U.K.'s Prime Minister Tony Blair. Coming in a distant second was Frances Prime Minister Jacques Chirac. Also noted, most of the people who mentioned Mr. Chirac could not, or would not (out of fear of sounding Frenchy) pronounce his name. The field really falls apart at third place. We have a rogues gallery, 4-way tie: Russian President Vladmir Putin (Who ousted his cabinet and prime minister today and is conducting his own war on terror in Chechnya), President of the Palestinian National Authority Yasser Arafat (Who shared the Nobel Peace prize with the late Iraeli prime minister Yitzhak Rabin in 1994, while he funneled millions of dollars in Palestinian foreign assistance funding to his wife in Paris),  Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon (Who is building a security fence deep inside the West Bank, cutting off Palestinian farmers from their lands and families, and effectively sabotaging the "Road Map To Peace"), and Lybia's Colonel Muammar Al Qadhafi (Who bombed a U.S. Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland; yet now this "Mad Dog of the Middle East" is going for an international makeover as he feels the need to modernize his country). One of our "also rans" could have been a contender if people could have remembered his name: North Korea's hard partying Kim Jong-Il. Nearly everyone described the Stalinist despot as "the guy who looked like E.T. dressed like Elvis from North Korea." Yep. Castro got one vote and so did "that guy from Canada", but it just goes to show you... most of us don't know shit.

      John Currin's exhibit at the Whitney closed yesterday. After having images from this exhibit on my desktop for the last month, I finally made my appearance at the museum on Saturday. After being deemed the conversation piece of the year by The New Yorker, I had high hopes for the exhibit. But the Whitney disappointed me at first. Small, crowded, and full of banal modern art that seems to mock lay people too ignorant to appreciate it, I was unimpressed. That is until I arrived on the second floor. The exhibit as crowded as I would have expected with two days left, but I could still manage to look at each painting.  I'm not an art critic, but I would recommend Currin to anyone interested in modern painting. He focuses on the human figure, with influences ranging from renaissance painters to Revlon ads. Sometimes his figures seem cartoonish, sometimes flawless, but his realism is a choice and it is supposed to be conveying a feeling. He works with cliched or tired themes, but twists them into something strange and slightly disturbing.  More on this later, I've got to help BF's Editor in Cheif pick up his recliners.

      Ok, the new poll is probably in poor taste. But so is Attorney General John Ashcroft's statement that doctor-patient privacy is not threatened by a government attempt to subpoena medical records in a lawsuit over the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act. Ashcroft was admitted to intensive care today, suffering from a severe case of gallstone pancreatitis. Dick Cheney had a defibrillator implanted in his chest back in 2001 in what his doctors called a "precautionary measure" given his history of heart disease and occasional irregular heartbeat.   Let's face it folks. Voting isn't for old people, but being a Republican is. If we can outlive the Rupert Murdochs of the world, maybe we'll be ok. Or maybe that's why they're trying to get us all killed first. Geriatric Bastards!  I'd like to dedicate this poll to the bosslady, who inspired its creation. And I'll cast my first hopeful vote on the Republican Death Ticker for Ashcroft's pancreas to explode. That donation to Planned Parenthood I just made last month was probably the best $20 I could have spent. I hope he chokes.   If you don't see any posts for a while after this, send the Freedom Fighters. Condoleeza Rice has me in a bunker under the White House, burning me with melting wax and putting out cigarettes on my tongue. She's wearing Stilettos and a fetish mask. While drugged Osama waits in the next room to be used as an election prop in the coming months.

      Ok. Not much to say here, but you should check out the selection I have up on the RECOMMENDED READING site. I found a blog by a young guy from Oklahoma who's working in Hollywood and enrolled in a creative writing program at CalArts. The link is posted down there somewhere. "Creepy Bald Men Are Following Me" or something like that. It's a cool perspective on what that might be like, for any of you readers out there who have considered the whole "Mid-West to Hollywood" thing. I haven't, and I have no desire to be anywhere near L.A., but it's interesting. I'm still toying with the idea of putting together a pitch to publish a book of the best blog excerpts. Any feedback on that? Let me know.

      So I stopped watching TV when I was about 20. Not for any pretentious reasons. I was a drunk. While people were watching TV, I was at the bar, playing in a band and hanging out with other drunks. That shitty band was my springboard into the cultural elitism I enjoy today.  Five years later, I'm less of a drunk (because I can't afford to live on the East Coast and I don't have a band anymore). But I still don't watch TV. When you come home from the bar and turn on Comedy Central before passing out, I'm reading the same sentence over and over again in The New Yorker. I read Don Dellilo's novel "White Noise" three times when I was about 21, because I could never remember where I stopped.  But I know about TV because I read about it in magazines. Which is where I found myself this evening, reading about reality TV in Harpers. Nobody can scare me like Harpers (read "The Oil We Eat" from last month, you might just kill yourself or pray for a giant meteor). I was cooking the ling I caught today (an ocean fish, kind of like a cod that only comes inshore in the winter) and going to work on some white wine that was donated to me by my gracious landlord, when I came upon the article. It illustrated a link between the republican dominated government and the production of Survivor, The Date-My-Mom-Show, Marry-A-Migdet... whatever.   The gist of the article was that people are being conditioned to accept social darwinism, that for "you" to win everyone else has to lose (which basically sums up our foreign policy, but who's watching?). If you are not beatiful, in shape, pragmatic, and ruthless, you will lose. Think of all the kids growing up watching that pompous fuck from American Idol berating people. That's the show's selling point, Kelly Clarkson be damned, criticism, cruelty, and failure. Ok. But we've already established that altruism doesn't exist anyway. No big deal. Lose the gut, buy the ribbed v-neck, and fight your way into a niche or you will die alone, covered in open sores. And then you earn the right to die in the company of someone you resent, covered in open sores. Congratulations. (see what Harpers does to me?) But the slippery slope the article wants you to see coming, is that reality TV isn't the reality we assume it is. It's staged, marketed, and insidious. And how far away are we from having our news marketed to our tastes? It's 1984 people, and George W. Orwell is wathcing you and hoping you're too busy tuning in to "The Simple Life" to notice. Think Farenheit 451 next time you turn up the headphones in your ears at the gym on the treadmill in front of the TV. You'll look great and you won't even miss any programming!  Here's the problem that I see with reality TV: It's making us dumber than we already are. I know brilliant people who are hooked on Survivor, American Idol, and "Five-Fun-Gay-Guys-Make-Straights-Buy-Stuff" (AKA. Queer Eye). Do we really need to promote consumerism and xenophobia? We're already the most self absorbed country in the world, why should we flaunt it? Nobody born in America speaks a foreign language fluently, except people who get paid to do it. We know nothing about other cultures and ideals. How can we justify burying ourselves in stereotypes that we can see everyday at the mall?  Anyway, I'm in full-on rant mode. Withdrawal from female companionship is brutal (i.e. the Trans-Atlantic romance took a nose dive; goddamned millionares and Italian male strippers ruin everything. Don't ask). I promise the next entry will be more uplifting. Really.

      Real quick post for all you joyful readers. I am tight lipped right now. My buddy Neil is proposing that we take to publishing a real e-magazine for twentysomethings. He wants to call it "Quarter Life Crisis" but I am sure about a million people beat us to the punch on that phrase. But I like his ideas, and he likes mine, so... nothing will probably happen. He is counting on me for the content (AND I HAVE A THOUSAND IDEAS). I really want to do a funny article on internet dating here's some of the thoughts I'm working through:  -Personal ads are innately desperate, no matter how appealing they seem. But I keep imagining myself sleeping alone in a tiny apartment full of dying plants in the New York for the rest of my life.  -I would like to think that the women online work in offices where everyone is married, live in new towns, or hate the bars, but that is just not true. There really is something wrong with most of these people.  -People tell stories about meeting their spouses in chat rooms. One of the most beautiful girls I know married a guy named Zippy that she met on AOL.  If anyone out there has any internet dating stories they would like to share with me, or if you are willing to be interviewed or willing to let me spy on you while you go out on a blind date with some Web nerd (or nerdette) ... let me know.  Neil, I think we have got a winner here pal. Other ideas? I am going to follow my pal Karim around and test his theory that the stupider he dresses, the better he does with the ladies. I cannot wait for that one. I am taking suggestions.

      One more reason to hate reality TV:  I'm starving last night around 8, so I head down to my local bar in Long Branch for a grease burger. It's the kind of place that at 8, I'm probably still ok to be there by myself. But after 10, I'm "that guy" in the collared shirt staring at the college girls in the corner. But they've got Credence Clearwater Revival on the jukebox and I've got a beer in front of me, so I'm ok. Until I look up.   It's Fear Factor, and my burger hasn't come yet. I'm watching a cute woman in a sports bra fill her mouth with scorpions and worms, and then spit them out into a meat grinder off to the side. While she's digging for another big mouthful, she starts to crank the handle on the meat grinder, sending a motor oil colored stream of bug shit into the waiting mouth of what has to be her twin sister, who is lying on the ground. It spatters the woman all over her face, her teeth, her eyes... and my food is coming. As it turns out, these people are doing it for free, because they lose by a tenth of an ounce or something.   And here comes my burger, medium and still bleeding on the bun. Yum. Reality TV isn't just making us stupid, it's making me sick. Thanks NBC, you should be proud of yourself you network shitbags. Thanks for ruining my fucking burger.

      Greetings from the Netherlands. I'm still alive, haven't been married off, and have managed to avoid getting mugged. I need to buy a sweater because I'm freezing today. Hopefully I'll get to the Van Gogh museum. This city is dangerous, even on a Saturday morning. Especially on a Saturday morning. I guess the pushers get out on weekends to hit the tourist crowd. I talked to a few of them for a while, but I had to get shitty with a couple guys. I'll give you a Euro if you tell me where you're from, where I can find a sweater for under $20, and what you think about you're life as a junkie. But if you come up to me, assuming that I want the gram of crushed up aspirin you're trying to sell as coke, I'm going to get pissed if you don't leave me alone.  I've been too drained to really get any great stories for all of you, but maybe tonight. I'm going to take my tape recorder to the red light district and see if I can interview a few of the people on both sides of the glass. Maybe something interesting will happen, maybe I'll get my ass kicked. I've been too tired to risk the need of defending myself, but I feel good today.  I haven't made up my mind about this city yet. Culturally and architecturally interesting, sure; I like the canals and the buildings. But the people attracted to Amsterdam don't really care about that. It's just got a really shady atmosphere and I don't think there's anything really great underneath that, like NYC.  I'm sad to say that Kevin from Energy User News and his wife have gone home. For those of you who don't know, technically Kevin is my magazine's competitor. The guy is great, damn funny, and he kind of reminds me of Nicholas Cage. There's about a thousand funny stories about this guy, but we've been too drunk to be able to retell most of them. He's been nervous about this blog all week.  This will be my last post from across the pond. Thanks everybody for keeping tabs. I miss everybody. I forget when my flight arrives in Newark, but I'll call when I get in Sunday...  Next Week: VEGAS

      Ok, back again.  D: Once again, your cultural references blow right over my 25 year old midwestern head. Heidi & John: Wish you were here... haaa ha ha.  Nate: Steelhead are like bigfoot. People have seen them but no one can prove they exist. Mom: Why can't I move to Europe? Think of the vacations for you and dad. Jim: That's why I'm the brains of this operation. Sean: The third planet is sure that they're being watched by an eye in the sky...  There is a 40 foot Ronald McDonald in Hannover. I'm disturbed. Anyway, I wrote a relly great post last time and lost it so I'm a little bitter. This keyboard sucks and I have to chicken peck. And the APC girls are giving me dirty looks because I can't explain that I'm allowed to use this. "Du hast wondershoen augen" isn't working.

      Ok, I just wrote a freaking novel of a post, but lost it when this damn thing logged off. So know that I'm having fun, want to move to Europe, and need a laptop. (Hint to Group C, all the other editors have their own; Buildings, BOM, Energy User News).  My German is coming in handy "Du hast wondershoen augen"/"You have beautiful eyes" and "Ich weis was du willst"/"I know what you want." Dating Catharina turned out to be good for something.  Ok, I love you all but this thing is gonna go down again. I'll update again soon. -Matt

      Alright, I'm here alive and generally well. My plan backfired at the airport entirely. First of all, my itinerary had changed and no one had told me, meaning I sat in terminal B at Newark for 4 hours. My plan had been to catch a little buzz and sleep it off on the way here. But instead of sleeping I spent 7 hours trying to keep my weight off my damn tailbone. I was bloated from the beer, hungover, and  thirsty as hell by 6am local time, no sleep.  I didn't let that stop me though. I navigated the airport, got my Eurail validated, and made it to Central Station in Amsterdam. The hotel is sweet, not what I'd expected. I've got a gym and my own iron. It's the little things sometimes.   I would add that I'm a little embarrassed to be an American. I stick out, and I'm actually trying to be aware of that. Sean, you're right. I should pretend to be Canadian. It's not working. If nothing else, Europeans are more graceful than we are. Not knowing the language is embarrassing and humbling. Everyone is very nice about it, and most people speak English as well as Dutch, but I hate not knowing anything about the native tongue.  I've managed to get the taboos out of the way, the 2 things Amsterdam is famous for, and I'm unimpressed. First of all, the fabled "Red Light District"... everything anyone has ever told you about it is true, except for the fact that all of the women are old enough to be my grandmother. In all accounts I've heard, this little detail was left out. Imagine walking down the street, looking around and feeling generally sheepish, and some 60 year old Asian woman that's built like a love seat is making some sort of lewd gesture at you through a giant window. HOT.  The hash bars are kind of like being at home. Everyone is an American and they're all acting like it. I had to see it for myself. But it's like hanging out at some stoner guy's house. There's bad music; American Neo-hippies braying and yelling over each other; kids on vacation with their parents buying hashish candy bars to get them through the tour of Anne Frank's house their parents are making them take. Tourists are spilling their coffees and laughing in each other's faces. I expected something more opulent, more Cheech & Chong. Instead, think Half Baked.  Other than that I'm tired, sober, and generally thrilled to be here. I'm trying to write about it a little.   Heidi: I didn't do the voice mail before I left. Could you ask Connie or Janet to set up an "Out of Office" message for me? I don't think my e-mail needs that though. I wish I had that pin (I'm Embarrassed of my President). I'm thinking about taking up a bad British accent to throw people off.  Mom: I'm doing fine. Don't sweat. Tell everyone helloooooo.  Sean: you would have loved it. I'm sitting in this cafe having lunch, and of course I pick the only place in this whole city that's all Dutch, no subtitles. So I kind of point at what I think I want to eat, and this beautiful waitress comes up to me to take my plate and she says "Likker". And I shake my head, I have no idea what in the hell she's saying. "Likker?" again. And I'm saying "Sorry... I don't speak..." And then she says, "DO YOU WANT ANY LIQUOR?" in perfect English. "Oh liquor! I thought... I mean... Likker? Lick Her? I barely know her! ...uh ..." So cool.  Downsides: For some reason, the APC company card isn't working, so my hotel is beeing billed to me for now. I'm taking care of it tonight at dinner. I guess the other APC guests had the same problem. The other shitty thing is that instead of going to the restaurant on the itinerary, I think we're eating in the hotel. Which is always a big suck in my book. I like getting off the compound. I'll add more later and thanks for checking in.

      OK kids, listen up. I'm on my way to Amsterdam today so I will be incommunicado for the rest of the week (no phone, no e-mail, no sobriety). Therefore, I will be performing a BLOG experiment. According to reliable sources, I will have access to PCs and the internet in the press room. If this is the case, I will be able to communicate through my little cheesey tagboard. Also, I may be recording my events in Europe for posterity, and to let my boss know I'm alive and still planning on coming back to the U.S. to continue editing her wonderful magazine.  So lets try the tagboard everybody! Keep it short and keep it clean. My mom reads this thing.

      Details are blurring together... chemical compounds in my brain are breaking down... synapses burning out like ratty filaments... snippets of Eagles songs playing over and over in my ears....  A poet that I've never met wants to move to Jersey and live with me. After none of my friends, family, or girlfriends would. Not that I asked anyone to move. But I didn't have to ask this guy either. "It'll be like free grad school," he said. "Except we won't get a degree!" I love the idea. He's written quite a bit on rice pudding. I may have to include some of it in the next post. But my favorite thing I've seen from him is "Satan Carries a Breifcase". Check it out at The Harrow, an online poetry/fiction journal. The link is below left.  Here's a quick, male perspective on The Boy From Oz. Unless you or your significant other has a thing for Hugh Jackman, skip it. It's 3 hours long, and all Hugh. He's fascinating to watch, because you keep thinking about Wolverine (The Canadian mutant loner from the comic book X-men with the Adantium claws and skeletal structure). But the novelty of a singing, dancing, gay comic book hero wears off after the first hour. The story of Peter Allen is interesting, but I don't think it warranted a full blown musical. And the story was so broad (covering from the time he was 6 until his death), that a lot of the more dramatic scenes were glossed over. A whole musical could have been written about his marriage, or about meeting Judy Garland in Hong Kong, or losing the people he cared about to AIDS. But whoever wrote it obviously wasn't interested in conflict. It's a feel-good, watch the man-candy dance, kind of thing. A little focus would have gone a long way.

      All right everybody, I'm back in Jersey and it looks like someone filled up my calendar until July, trashed my apartment, and set a bomb off in my cubicle. To whomever is responsible for this...YOU WILL PAY. I can't see over the pile of shit on my desk, I'm on deadline, and I'm supposed to go to Manhattan twice for visiting friends this week. Followed by my friend's wedding in Baltimore, followed by my trip to Vegas, followed immediately by my trip to Ohio, followed immediately by my trip to Dallas, followed by my trip to Chicago. And then I turn 26. Send hard drugs and midget porn videos, you know what I like.  My suit smells like I feel, so I had to get it dry cleaned. What I really need is a blood transfusion, a week straight at the gym, and sleep. But instead I will be watching Hugh Jackman dance around wearing more sequins than any man really should. Yes, I'm seeing The Boy From Oz with my old boss, his wife, and the lovely Katie Pontius. I'll give you the uncultured-testosterone/"This guy was Wolverine?" Review tomorrow. Thanks again for checking in. I'd like to thank Regina, Kevin, and Mike for making the trip fun. They probably won't read this, but if they do... "What happens in Europe..." Ha ha ha. No. I'm serious.

      Well folks, I came out ahead in the big scheme of things. I learned a lot about Vegas. First of all, the odds are pretty much even if you play the way you're supposed to. So you're wins and losses run in cycles. The reason Vegas makes money is because people quit when they're down, and keep playing when they're up. If you had an unlimited bank roll, you could probably stay even for a while.  Secondly, there is good food in Vegas. The Bosslady is right. Food by the pound  is a bad idea anywhere. I ate at two of the most expensive restaurants I've ever seen this week, and didn't pay a cent. Del Friscos is off the strip, a dark wood-paneled gentlemen's club type place. We had ten appetizers, a god awful amount of red wine, and huge steaks. They might have been the best steak's I'd ever seen. Unfortunately, no one could have eaten more than half of their meals. People were actually complaining, quietly of course, about the kids in India.  Commanders Palace is a Louisiana style restaurant where they serve turtle soup, pork belly, and really great veal chops. I'm not sure what the bill was on that one, but it wasn't pretty. There's one in New Orleans as well. I bought a couple rounds of drinks at the bar and it put me back $75.

      VIVA LAS VEGAS!!! VIVA LAS VEGAS!!! I'm up about $100. I know when to hold them, call me Matt "Double-Down" Stansberry. A couple things to note: The food SUCKS. And what's worse is that there is always a ton of it. It's like the rest of this damn city, they think that if they make something big enough people won't care how bad it is. A $2.95 prime rib, obviously tastes like a $2.95 prime rib. I have eaten some of the worst damn "luxury" food ever. Last night I had the Seafood Fantasy buffet, and WOW. Lobster claws, steamed last October, and then flash frozen to be thawed and served months later. Yum. How in the hell are you supposed to get fresh seafood in the desert anyway?  As I walked this morning from my hotel, I saw half a dozen news crews set up in front of the Mirage. Workers were about to take down the MAMMOTH Sigfried & Roy sign. Six news crews folks. Six. I love the idea of magicians getting mauled as much as the next guy, but six news crews just for a sign coming down seems like overkill.  Ok, Dan "The Man" Burke is giving me the look, and so are all of the other people in the press room. They want on the computer, they want me to stop singing (VIVA LAS VEGAS!!!). I'll hook up again later.

      Ok, I didn't sign in from Baltimore and I'm sorry. There wasn't much to say. I was at Eric Fuller's wedding in a 5-star hotel, downtown Baltimore. Ok, maybe there was a lot to say, but most of it will remain unsaid. I will be posting from Vegas tomorrow, so be sure to check in. This month will be the grand tour of business travel. Thanks for checking in, and I'll write something longer for you on the plane tomorrow.

      I went back to the Ohio and the Muzak filled the air from Seneca to Cuyahoga Falls. Chrissy Hines of The Pretenders is an Ohio native. And if nothing else, that band alone validates our state's cultural contribution. In addition to the poet Hart Crane and America's Nobel Laureate Toni Morrison. The great rock band The James Gang was named after the MAC championship Kent State Football team, and Joe Walsh dropped out of my high school. Allen Ginsberg taught at my college for two years. So I'm sick of all you East Coasters mocking us.   Went fishing with my dad and my brother this morning off the railroad tracks at Wingfoot Lake, 2 minutes from my parents old house that I lived in for 18 years. We caught a ton of little fish, saw an old neighbor, and got sunburnt. I used to work maintenance at the park across the lake.   Out on the tracks I was thinking about the person I was before I left for NJ. Most of the clothes I owned were secondhand. I rode my bike all over my old college town, to the bars, the independent book shop, the poetry readings. We had the Cuyahoga River, full of white bass all spring, and a trail running alongside. Towner's Woods was the biggest piece of public forest in Portage county, and home to one of the biggest Hopewell Indian burial mounds in all of Ohio. I used candles instead of lightbulbs, kept screened windows open, cooked bluegills, drove through fields, had bonfires, drank Black Labe beer in the can on front porches. I spent afternoons writing a bad novel, days off at the library.   I'm not sure what I'm trying to say, since I love ocean fishing and my job. But I do miss some of this. My phone rings nonstop here and nobody looks at my ID funny.

      The Bar Scene:  Tuesday nights are for karaoke. It seems to be the only way to draw a crowd on this miserable weeknight. So Khan and I attended the local version of this at a Monmouth University bar by his house. We've developed a theory in that the more we dress like goons, the more women want to talk to us. So we lose the work clothes, put on ratty T-shirts, stumble down to Jacks, and try not to look like we're almost 30.  And then we sit there, talking to each other about what girls we would talk to if we had any balls, and drinking beer. Instead of approaching interesting people, we bloat ourselves with shitty american lagers and pretend not to stare. It's like being at the zoo.  Usually by around 11 (when I should be going home) the bar gets packed and Dynamic Dave steps up to the mic. I hate Dynamic Dave, even though I shouldn't. He's my people. He wears sweat pants and a flannel shirt with huge sunglasses and a WWF championship belt. All of the times I've been there (about 4) he's sung I Did It My Way and We Are The Champions, annoying songs to begin with. He doesn't try to sing, but sort of warbles and makes up the words. And it might be funny once, but everybody in the bar comes every week or so, and I'm assuming that Dynamic Dave does this all the time. He probably sings 3-4 songs a night. Last night I wanted to drop kick him right across the airbrushed "Dynamic Dave" bandana he wears over his forehead. In retrospect, it might have salvaged the night.  At some point the bar gets so crowded that Karim and I are forced to talk to other people and we're drunk enough to think that we're pretty sweet, so we break out the witty banter. "HI!" Karim yells over a Garth Brooks song. "DO YOU HAVE AN EXTRA CIGARETTE?" He doesn't really smoke and they never really want to give you one. But obviously we're social retards.  And then I start singing Build Me Up Buttercup. Some girl thinks its funny so she starts dancing around and talking to us, and asks why the hell I know the words to this song. "Oh because last year I taught this English class and the kids in my journalism program had to learn this song as one of the singing Valentines that they sold to raise money and..." Too long. She gives me 5 seconds to say something interesting and I blow it.   Karim is pretty observant and he notices that the 3 girls standing by us are all wearing the same necklace. "I SEE YOU'RE ALL WEARING THE SAME NECKLACE! YOUR NECKLACE! YOU'RE ALL WEARING THE SAME NECKLACE!" They agree, yes they are wearing the same necklace. They tell us that they're prayer lockets. Their best friend is in a coma and they keep their prayers for her in these lockets around their necks. What's the follow up to that? "That's great... uh. Do you want a drink?" Probably not. Instead we sneak out the door and walk home.  But Karim says that this is like pool, we're just setting up our shots.

      First of all, everyone reading this needs to hook up with FRIENDSTER right now. It's E-crack. Ok, so I've got all these friends from all these different places, and they've all got friends from all these different places, and... ad nauseum. So you can build up this huge network of people who sort of know each other, and you can know stuff about them, and and... ok. It doesn't sound that cool, but try it. People see their pictures up on the Web and they'll stare for hours. If you want me to invite you onto FRIENDSTER (I think that's how it works), then put it up on the tagboard. If you've got time to read this, you've got time for FRIENDSTER.  I just bought "What's Up Matador", an album that Dead Low Tide always seemed to have with him, about five years ago. So I'm listening to that a lot now. Two CDs for $10 featuring great old tracks from Cat Power, Yo La Tango, and Spoon. WHAT A DEAL! Dig my shit. That crazy Judah Bauer shit.  I'm not sure how I feel about Air America, the AM liberal radio network. Do we really need a liberal media outlet? The right complains of the liberal media, but the point is that liberals want balanced media. That's the difference between us and them. We want to see things the way they are (good or bad), while conservatives only have room for their own ideologies. NPR isn't a liberal media outlet. Just because they care about the arts, speak in reasonable tones, and appeal to the Volvo/Organic crowd doesn't brand them the mouthpiece of the DNC. I can't use my subscription to The Nation. It's too skewed to be trusted. (If anyone wants the last 10 issues, let me know. I'll mail them) Even one of my favorite magazines has started down a slippery slope. Harpers prints some of the best journalism being written today. But in the last two issues or so, their editorial has gotten more and more shrill in condemning the GOP. For me to take a media outlet seriously, there needs to be at least the appearance of objectivity. Everyone could take a lesson from The New Yorker. Sure Republicans suck, but lets keep the discussion reasonable.

      No sleep till.... Brooklyn.   Last night, Karim and I braved the West side of Brooklyn to see one of the greatest rock shows ever. I fully endorse on these here pages THE RYE COALITION. I'm putting the link up today. I've never seen a band play that well. Imagine David Lee Roth singing for Iron Maiden about girls and beer. That's a lot of rock. The guys in the band were from Jersey City, aka "The Dirty Jers", and had been together for over 10 years. Herb the guitarist was very cool. Stevel Albini produced their first two albums, and the next one will be on Interscope and is being produced by Dave Grohl. That guy is just too damn busy, but everything he touches turns to gold. Herb told Karim and I that he would tie us down to the pool table if we were too drunk to drive. That's a band that cares.  The next act was The Minibosses from Arizona. Wired magazine ran a full feature article on them back in November because they play old Nintendo soundtracks. Karim knew their drummer from elementary school, a cool guy named Matt who was very happy to see Karim at the show. Honestly, I was nervous for them. The Rye Coalition would be a tough act for any band to follow. But when I saw them just wailing out the theme of Mega Man, the crowd was going nuts. They finished the set with a two-for-one, Castlevania 1 & 2. Awesome.  So the headliners, The Eagles of Death Metal, featured Josh Homme (former frontman of one of my favorite bands Queens of the Stone Age). Unfortunately he was drumming and they put this cheeseball with a mustache out front. They were supposed to be some sort of southern blues outfit. None of it worked. The guitars sounded bluesy, but they were too distorted. They didn't have a bass player. And the southern fried joke got old really fast. The biggest mistake they could have made was putting Josh Homme in the back. He's a good drummer and he's fun to watch, but he hits like an 8 year old girl. They were making a bad attempt to rip off the Reverend Horton Heat, without a really good bass player. Oh well Josh. You shouldn't have quit the day job.

      I'd like to take time out of my busy day to mention... I NEED A FUCKING PRIVATE OFFICE! I would yell this in my current office, but no one would hear me over the din of people asking for meetings about ideas that won't effect anything for a month, assinine questions about misplaced product categories, and loud goddamn people. I'm going to light everything on my desk on fire. I'm having a testosterone day.  On a more relaxed note, I will be checking in from upstate New York this weekend. Bye.

      Greetings. I'm looking for someone to tell me how to embed links and photos onto a blog. Anybody here have any idea how to do what I'm talking about? There's some sweet sites out there and I want Manipulated Media to be one of them. Anybody with any suggestions, please hit me up ASAP. I tried to do something on Xanga and it's a pain in the ass. So if anybody knows how to run that, let me know. At least they let me store pictures on Xanga, but my free premium is going to run out. So if you're familiar with how to do the stuff I want to do, help. Please.

      So much for Texas. I almost made it to Dallas tonight, but unfortunately weather and air traffic conspired against my trip. I read most of a novel (Nobody's Fool by Richard Russo if you're keeping tabs) and ate the worst food ever. The lettuce on my club sandwich from TGIFridays was so rotten I had to WIPE it off my nasty meats. I couldn't pick it off. It was that far gone. Once more proving valid my long time stance against A) Chain Restaurants and B) Airport food in general. Combining the two proved too horrible for consumption. I will boycott Fridays on principle for the rest of my days. If I would have waited longer at the gate I could have flown to Atlanta, gotten drunk there, and flown home in the morning, but the merits of such a trip would be neglible compared to the amount of explaining and make up work that would result.   I think my estrogen level is up. Men have estrogen levels you know. Just like women have testosterone. It's just in smaller amounts. I've been having a "fat" day all day. I ordered a soup & 1/2 turkey club for dinner. And I didn't even drink any beer at the airport bar. I was pleasant to airport employees and made small talk with old ladies. I called people who might want to hear from me. Do you see the equation? Being a reasonable, responsible person=High Estrogen Levels. I'm not saying women are smarter than men. They just make better decisions. If I would have ordered a burger, 10 Sam Adams, and bitched the whole way to Georgia, where would I be now? Probably in a bar, alone, singing Karaoke to the 45 year old bartender who's hints to get me to leave aren't working. That's where I'd be, an enchanted evening for sure. Instead I decided that my purse was too heavy to go drinking in the deep south on a school night. That estrogen doesn't give you any sense of adventure. Hunter S. Thompson would not be proud.

      Ladies and Gentlemen, I'm in a good mood despite all evidence and reasoning to the contrary. I'm on my way to Dallas tomorrow, "home of big hair and big ladies" according to KP. So things are lookin up! I'll be doing the toe-touch thing that the NYTimes got in all that trouble for, just landing in town to get the out of state dateline. That's me, cub reporter. It's not really that glamourous, and nobody cares how long I'm in Dallas, except the bosslady cause I'm never in the office and I'm still supposed to be writing articles.  I added a bunch of band links, since I saw a lot of great people when I was home. This was one of the first trips where I really wanted to stay longer instead of making everyone move out here. Akron is getting cooler or something. Dead Low Tide and DW will save me, two people to put faith in. Watch those two.  On topic (THE MEDIA and how much it generally sucks), did anybody see Lou Dobbs tonight? He had a special report on CNN about how inner city kids get the worst teachers. It's how he phrased it. But the report is flawed. Ok, so inner city schools get teachers that are just out of college, or from liberal educations with no certification. But whose to say that young, creative, inexperienced people are any less suited to teach than the old bags that have been rattling around your high school for the last thirty years, giving the same stupid dittoes and quizzes without thinking about them since the beginning of time? I think that this shit works, and messing around with it will be about as successful as "No Child Left Behind".

      Dateline: Chicago  I'd like to take this chance to commend Johnny Parkinson. I hereby bestow the Purple Liver, an award for putting that vital organ in danger under extreme conditions. Nice job JP.   I just finished listening to a presentation by Mac Anderson, founder and president of Successories. The company that brought you sweet sayings like "Life's A Cinch, Inch by Inch!" No more loafing for me.  I ran at 7:30 this morning on the shores of Lake Michigan and it was blue and very serene. I could live here a couple months a year for sure. Maybe just for the month of May.  As for restaurant reviews, I don't recommend Chicago Chophouse. Despite its glowing reputation, steaks are huge and tasteless, the lobster is frozen and microwaved, and the salads... don't get me started.  Attendees are piling in and I've got booth duty, but I'd like to end this entry by mentioning my new pal Jeremy. The guy lived in Iraq and worked for Haliburton and man does he have some stories. I hope to get him out to NJ and NYC for a weekend to interview him over a bunch of hard booze for my own Iraq story.  Later

      Chicago, the city that never pukes on its shoes. Something like that. Anyway I'm here and alive after a grueling opening day of The TFM Show. Things that happened that I can talk about:  -I gave out lots of drink tickets to facility managers at the welcome reception. Now I'm Mr. Cool. -I begged KP to fly out here, changed my flight to Sunday night, and now we're staying the weekend.(Jim, if you're reading this, that means we're probably not fishing on Sunday) -I made fun of John for not using his inside voice at dinner. -I let non-core columnists see my tattoos and took off my dress shirt in a classy restaurant (at my managing editor's prodding, I should mention). -I drank all of the Jaeger in Chicago. -I danced on the couches at a bar I could never find again. People were wondering who gave whitey the crack rock. -I beat a Marine for drinks, more than once, at this punching bag game that measures a hit's velocity in pounds. It was more a game of skill than strength, but the armed forces have never been big on finesse. -I bonded with a Paki cab driver. -And I still got up at 7am to be a bad ass at the sessions, dragging John with me to beat both the Bosslady and the Uber bosslady to the show.  -I cauterized the wounds to my internal organs with something called the Eduardo Burrito at 9am. Lots of Chorizo. And pulled it off without urping, that's right, urping all over my magazine's publisher.  And that's the cat's ass. Just imagine the shit I can't talk about.

      All right, time to address some important issues. First of all, I want everyone to know that I've gotten most of my friends onto my Friendster stuff. Rock out. Now I'm friends with Aquaman and Bigfoot and other sweet ass people. So if you really don't have anything else to do, you can make up some bogus personality and put it up. It's hilarious. You can take pictures from anywhere and set up a profile. I think it's spreading like wild fire as more and more people see that the rules do not apply. Anything goes. They're probably going to crack down on it soon though, since it seems to be getting out of hand.  DW: Thought you should know that I'm now Friendsters with Mindless Self Indulgence and they will be playing a show on April 28 in Tribeca and they're offering their friendsters early ticks. I might go. And you said Friendster was dumb.  I spent the weekend in Millbrook, NY with KP and it was a hell of a place. Very quaint. I'd recommend the Taconic Parkway to anyone, especially in the fall. Mountains, trees, rivers, the works.  Went to Manhattan on Saturday to see Frizzle (I love that kid. DW, tell him how to get in touch. Give him my e-mail). Also, KP and I tried to eat at the mega-hyped gastropub in the west village, Spotted Pig. After a marathon death march from Chinatown, we found a overcrowded, yet quaint place with a reported 2 hour wait and no one taking names. Awesome.  For those of you waiting for me to send fiction, or to read yours, I will be taking care of that in the next couple days. I've printed out the fiction I am supposed to read and I'm taking it with me to Chicago. I've looked at a couple recent stories to send out, but I'm not happy enough with them to give to anyone. Give me a couple days to polish them.  Ok That's all for today kids. Chicago tomorrow morning! I love that town. Oh, and thanks for hitting the site. The counter says we're over 1,000 hits. Bad ass.

      Heading back to Ohio today. Another plane ride. I'm going to drop the Israel thing soon and get back to stupid things. I promise. But I'm standing by my criticism of Sharon's policies and the general hypocrisy of the U.S. stance. Change my mind. Write me an e-mail.  Last night, Karim and I got after it with Frank "the tank" Trocino. Watch out for that guy. I could tell you all about it, but I probably shouldn't. It's just too stupid. I'm getting on a train now.

      The Modern History of Israel as I understand it:  Through the late 19th century up to WWII, Jews were being persecuted in Russia and Eastern Europe. To avoid persecution, many refugees returned to the "Holy Land", which was populated by Arabs. The indigenous Palestinians didn't approve of this migration and reacted accordingly. The U.N. stepped in and proposed two states, Jews agreed and the Arabs didn't. With Syrian and Egyptian troops lined up at the border, preparing to wipe out the fledgling nation, Israel pre-emptively struck, wiping out both armies in 6 days, expanding their territory. Israel eventually gave up territory (Sinai Penninsula) after international pressure. The Palestinians were forced into the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, where they are encroached upon by Israeli settlers. Peace talks, Infantadas, assassinations... and now what?  The assassination of Yitzhak Rabin on Nov. 4, 1995 by a nationalist, Jewish zealot brought down the best hope for peace that region had seen in decades. Arafat can't be trusted. Ariel Sharon is a maniac. All the while, 14 year old kids are strapping bombs to their chests and blowing themselves up on buses. If anyone would like to correct any of this or add an insight, e-mail me and I'll post it.  Non Sequitir: The first day of bass fishing  I hit the beach at 6:15 this morning. Sixty degrees, blue sky, Dunkin' Donuts, and calm seas. I drowned a couple clams. The guy next to me got a bump. Still better than sleeping.

      As reported on the BBC this morning (paraphrased):  The head of the United Nations nuclear watchdog, Mohamed ElBaradei, is to visit Israel later this year. Israel has never confirmed or denied it has nuclear weapons, although it is widely believed to possess them. Although Israel is a member of the IAEA (Internationl Atomic Energy Agency), it has never signed the NPT (Non Proliferation Treaty), designed to prevent the global spread of nuclear weapons. As a result, Israel is not subject to inspections and the threat of sanctions by the IAEA.   Some experts believe it to be the world's sixth largest nuclear power. Its Arab neighbours have frequently accused the international community of double standards - for requiring them to be free of nuclear weapons while doing little, in their eyes, about Israel. In December, Mr. ElBaradei said the belief that Israel would be safer because it possessed such weapons was false, as other Middle Eastern countries felt threatened by their presence.   In Related News:  A major conference on anti-Semitism has opened in Berlin with calls for renewed efforts to fight the problem. The conference was called in response to an apparent rise in anti-Jewish incidents in Europe. Some speakers said criticism of Israel was often merely anti-Semitism disguised, while others warned that this should not be used to prevent legitimate opposition to Israeli policy.   So in response, let me say... I'M SICK OF ISRAEL. Drop dead, you hypocrital, sanctimonius, imperialist lunatics. You live in a dust bowl in the most dangerous part of the world. What in the fuck are you fighting about? Let the Arabs have it. Who fucking cares? You should be deserting your settlements immediately, and on the way out kiss the orphaned children your military has left behind and beg for forgiveness.  Everybody is real sad about the holocaust. We are. But just because a bunch of  Krauts made the biggest mistake of the 20th century does not give you a free pass to be assholes fifty years later. You do not have the market cornered on Democide (murder by government). From 1929-1931, Stalin killed over 7% of the Russian population. Shit happens. The world is unfair. Luckily for the US and our allies the world is usually unfair in our favor.   In conclusion: Love Jews, Hate Israeli Policy. World Peace? Everybody Just Say Fuck It.  -In other news: My buddy G.W., the single most dangerous president in U.S. history, the man who unsigned the Kyoto Protocol, has sank $110 million into research to recover Carbon Dioxide, or carbon sequestration. The idea is, instead of curbing greenhouse gases (which don't really exist, right George?), we're going to suck them up and put them somewhere, like under the saline resevoir under the Ohio River; a pit of waterlogged sandstone that runs from West Virginia to Wisconsin. The problem is, that a leak would kill wildlife, waste millions, and kill people. See, because a giant bubble of CO2 escaped in Cameroon 18 years ago and asphyxiated 1700 people. So, shit happens.   Does this sound like a good long term plan? Anybody? Lets just put all the gas under the ground and hope it doesn't blow up. Brilliant. If you are reading this and you are not registered to vote... I will come to your house and kill you for wasting space. On a lighter note, please feel free to play Presidential Punch Out. The link is to the left. It's very gratifying.  Lots o' vitriol today folks.

      So if you've noticed, I haven't paid a lot of attention to media criticism the past couple days (months... whatever). That's because I've been too busy to read the news over the last few weeks. I can't get my head out of my ass long enough to get fresh air. So I won't be commenting on the mainstream media tonight.  I want to comment on the practice of infantilism, or becoming a man-baby. While walking through the Chicago Institute of Art, my mind wandered to babies. People had babies in their arms, babies in strollers, all over the museum. And I wondered, what would be the museum goers' reaction to me being pushed around in an oversized stroller in a diaper. I asked KP if she would grant me this fetish. I think I saw it on Oprah when I was little. Unbelievably, KP said that she would not take me anywhere in a stroller. But I couldn't drop it. I imagined myself on the streets of Paris, at a tiny outdoor cafe on the Seine, in a stroller. I would kick and pout, throw my bottle, while my "nanny" would smile at the older couples, smoking cigarettes from a long cigarette holder and sipping absinthe. Nothing sexual, just the public humiliation. Everybody's got a dirty fantasy. I just found mine.   KP says she would never do this. She thinks that I have a general contempt for humanity, that I don't care what people think because I think I'm better than everyone else. But KP misreads the behavior. It's a cry for help. Not for me, but for all the world to realize that nothing matters. If you want to wear depends, drink white russians out of an Evenflo bottle, and wear pastel cotton diapers... fuck it. I'm feeling crass tonight. I apologize.  On a more relevant and serendipitous note, I picked up a number of "independent" weeklies in Chicago over the last week. The city has more free local news sources than any other city I've been to. The Chicago Reader gets a big thumbs up. A regular feature of the Chicago Reader is Savage Love, by Dan Savage. And Dan happened to be covering my personal topic of the moment, Infantilism. So there is some sort of sick order in the universe.

      Well I'm back in the Dirty Jerz for a few days, and glad to be here. Special thanks to KP for flying out to Chicago for the weekend and nursing me back to health, sort of. Weekend highlights? A play called "Mexican Wrestling Macbeth" featuring the three weird sisters in drag, Mexican Luchadors (aka. wrestlers in colorful gimp masks), a midget Macbeth, women with ridiculous armpit hair, and voice-over acting. Insane. Two thumbs up.  Laurie Hogin's exhibit at the Peter Miller gallery was also worth a couple thumbs. I'm going to look for a link to some of her stuff. It's mostly paintings of disturbed furry animals on social anxiety disorder medications, staring off into the distance while grinding their fangs. Now that's art. And it was free. And it's right around the corner from a remodeled airstream trailer that serves some of the best Mexican food in town. 118 N. Peoria St.  I'm drowning in my own mucous. Wore down the ol immune system this week. My head almost exploded on the plane. I'll update more as it comes to me. See you in Cleveland on Friday. No rest for the weary.

      Ok, good news bad news. I took down the shitty tagboard that never seemed to work. The good news? I have a new way to comment under each posting, so go to town. Let me know if you like it better or not. Sorry to the Bosslady and anybody else that had some good stuff up there over the last couple days. I tried to salvage it and put it in a post, but the tagboard was so blown out that I couldn't even retrieve the messages.  Now we can rant again about the Prez, Rumsfeld, Sharon, media outlets, wars, sexuality, and other complex issues that couldn't possibly be addressed adequately through blog entries. Especially by me. But what the hell, why not try?  The Republican National Convention is in NYC this year. As a good "liberal" journalist, I feel responsible to protest this event, but there are major problems with this idea. First, NYC's city officials aren't granting a permit for the protest. They're dragging their feet on the process and blaming the lack of a permit on worries for the Great Lawn in Central Park. Load of shit. The other problem is that the RNC is a huge target. If the bombings in Madrid have taught the world anything, it's that terrorism works. I know there's going to be more security in NYC than  we could imagine, but it's not going to be foolproof. I'm not sure if I want to get blown up with a protest sign in my hand.   Politics are great, but they're kind of like a "Thinking Person's" substitute for the pro sports thing. In the end, these people are just symbols. People need something to cheer for.  I don't give a fuck about the Indians or the Bosox or any of these stupid teams. Who cares? They're overpaid, larger than life figures that really shouldn't have that much influence on people's day to day lives. Much like politicians. But they do. I don't want to die waving a "democrat" pennant.

      Ok, I'm back in business. No air travel on my hands for the next month! My projects at home are backing up real bad. Current to do list: -Get Skies Bleed Black a show on May 22 or 29 -Record some guitar tracks for DW and Sean for a new Mail-a-tape band project -Pay Bills I haven't looked at in months -Call my fishing captain buddy that I've been ignoring since I screwed up the article we were supposed to have this winter (I've got a new magazine for him now, and it's fishing season again) -Start freelancing again (Haliburton story, Economist essay, Shad Festival next weekend) -Index the last 4 issues of TFM (sorry Bosslady!) -Read everybody else's stuff they've sent me -Lose my gut (whatever) -Clean my cube -Clean my room, which looks like the Tazmanian Devil tore through it on a cocaine binge. Drywall dust on everything... Can't inhale... landlady is putting in a new bathroom the size of a broom closet. Speaking of closets, I'm cleaning out mine. If you think you might want some of the shit I'm throwing out... come visit.  I know this list isn't very exciting, but it's more for me than for you. So piss off.  It's Cinco de Mayo and I had no idea. I'm a horrible Mexican.  Lastly, I'd just like to add something to the discussion on torture of Iraqi prisoners by American soldiers. According to a friend who served in Iraq, it was standard practice to chain naked Iraqis to a wall with duct tape over their eyes in a room with an angry dog, chained just shy of being able to reach them. According to this friend, Iraqis are extremely afraid of large dogs. Who the fuck likes big, mean dogs? Anyway, the photos released last week are not illustrating isolated incidents. Torture was our policy.  What do we need to do to win the hearts and minds of the Iraqi people? Maybe we should give them reality TV or their own Wal-marts. Let's discuss next post.

      Call For Papers!  There is an essay contest advertised in the May 3 issue of The New Yorker. Shell Oil and The Economist are sponsoring the writing prize. The theme is "Import Workers Or Export Jobs?" For more on the theme, I put up details on the Recommened Reading site.   The essay should be no more than 2000 words. 1st prize wins $20,000, two 2nd prizes win $10,000 each, and five 3rd prizes win $5,000 each. The winning essay will be published in the November annual wrap up. Last year's contest received 6,000 entries.   Why am I posting this? Why should anyone care? Because I think I know some intelligent people, who may know other intelligent people, who may be willing to offer opinions and aid in putting an essay together. So I'm asking anyone who has an opinion on outsourcing and the global economy, or knows someone who could have a decent opinion, to write me an e-mail. I'd love to research it and enter with a team of people.  Worst case scenario, we don't win and I shop it out to another magazine as a freelance piece, or tweak it to fit TFM's ongoing debate on the topic of outsourcing.

      Last night I watched the decapitation video of Nick Berg. There's something suspect about the way he sits throughout the speech. He doesn't move at all. And then, after the manifesto, there is this screaming. But it doesn't sound like an American voice screaming. And then they kind of knock him over and the camera bounces around. When they cut off his head with the knife, its practically bloodless. Which leads me to believe that he was dead already. Still sick, still very sad. Disturbing how easily his head came off. But I don't think he was alive when it happened. I'm not sure if I should have watched it. Anybody else see it? Is anybody concerned about the attention this is getting compared to the other people who are dying every day in Iraq?  Check the fishing report. It's amazing.

      Two things I forgot to mention. 1.) Karim and I went to get ice cream after dinner yesterday and it was probably the creepiest I've ever felt in public. Getting ice cream is definitely a couples activity. Single males should go alone and leave immediately. Do not hand around. DO NOT GO TOGETHER. You will look like a couple of pedophile gang rapists. 2.) Check out the surf fishing journal. I caught a lot of fish today. The link is to the bottom left.

      This week is really busy, so I'm going to be selling this site short for a few days. The only thing I would note is that NPR is on their spring fund drive. Normally I just sit through it, since I'd rather hear these people beg for money than listed to Linkin Park. But this morning I turned on Howard Stern for the first time in about a year. He was live from Las Vegas at the Hard Rock, hosting a Butter Face contest. A "Butter Face" (for the ladies who may not be familiar with the term) is a woman with a great body and an ugly face. As in, "I liked everything but her face." Who the hell would sign up to be in this contest is beyond me. But it was entertaining. As was karaoke from hell, where Stern and others sang. Artie was too drunk to even do the show. I feel stupid...er.

      Ok, I'm getting hammered at work right now so I'll keep this breif. I've revamped Recommended Reading to be exactly that. Quick lists of what I'm reading and whether or not I like it. To be updated more frequently. Also, I've started a new site dedicated to fishing. It's linked at the bottom left. I'll be working on these when I have more time and leaving this site clear for more culture oriented ranting. More later.

      ON THE BEACH The stripers are biting. School sized fish are coming into shore. I fished Jim Semple's high/low rig with salted clams. I think I would have done better with sandworms, but hindsight...   ON THE MEDIA Read the May 10th New Yorker. It's one of the best issues I've come across. I can't vouch for the fiction, but there is an article on the Abu Ghraib scandal, a wonderfully balanced article on John Kerry's career as a lawyer and a real human (as opposed to the reformed coke head bible beater with no original thought in his fucking head that is currently the leader of the free world), and a great review of Bob Woodward's new book Plan of Attack (For those of you who don't know, Woodward is one of the most important journalists of the last 50 years and one of the last truly objective voices). According to the review, the writing isn't great but the facts are laid bare for interpretation. Both candidates are recommending people to read it. Some of the quotes are scary. Read the article. Colin Powell is one unhappy man.  ON MY CRAIGSLIST POST FOR FISHING PALS I got one hit already from a guy who is a journalist for the Dow Jones. He wants to go fishing up at Liberty State Park, across from the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Isle. We might write something about it. He doesn't seem like he fishes much, in fact I'm supplying the rods. We'll see what happens.  OTHER PEOPLE'S WORK I've finally read the writings I've been meaning to. Mark Mandell's short "Newton's Apple" gave a real sense of what it must be like to be least insane person in an asylum. The idea of struggling for something so intrinsic in our day to day lives is very cool. And the lure to let it go... Some things I'd change, but Mark has a book and I don't.  DW has sent me ten pages of something. There is more emotion in some of these sentences than I've been able feel about anything in the past year. There's no third person distance. You have your face pressed into these words. Always something trivial to clean up, some focus narrowed, but this guy is doing something worthwhile. I promise.  If anyone wants to read anything from these two, let me know and I'll ask them if I can send anything.

      Craigs List, Friendster, and Upcoming.org  Online communities, free of charge. What do you think? They look great and there are some really cool things you can do with them. But the problem lies in having friends who will use it. What good is an online community of strangers? So, check out the sites and let me know your impressions. In two unrelated situations, friends of mine had used Craigslist this weekend. Coincidence? Nope. You can post almost anything on this site. People can sell or barter junk, announce yard sales, find kinky sex, find roomates, fishing partners, jobs, whatever. It seems really great. The limitation is that it only works well for people living in a metro area. Being outside of the city that is listed makes it hard to deliver goods, meet people, and whatnot. But other things are worthwhile. I posted today in a search for fishing partners. I'll tell you how it goes.  Upcoming.org is a site that lists events. People can post almost anything that the general public would enjoy. From what I understand you can search it by geography or by your list of friends. Now this might be helpful for people with friends all over the country. You could use it to keep people posted on your schedule to help people decide who to visit and when. What concerts are coming up, what vacation plans you have, what business travel you're planning. It would definitely work for me. So if you want to try this to keep our travel coordinated, let me know. Let's sign up and start a friends category.  I've already ranted enough about Friendster. It's e-crack. Don't touch it.  Thanks to DW for linking me up to the Skies Bleed Black site. Now all I have to do is get Dead Low Tide to put me on the Interfuse site and I will completely dominate Google. Also, Adam needs to update his site. He's been promising to do it all week. If you know Adam, or even if you don't, go to his Web site, sign his guestbook, and tell him he's an ass. The site is listed on the left as Adam Saylor Rules.

      Hey kids,  Since this appears to be the place where just about anything can (and does) happen, I thought I'd share one of my favorite, yet obscure guilty pleasures. It's a radio program broadcast on WNYC (93.9 FM) on Saturday afternoons. Hosted by Steve Post (certifiable nutcase...seriously; that's what today's "program" was all about), it's called "The 'No" Show."  I have been listening to this guy for years, but then he disappeared. (From the sound of today's show, he may have taken personal time to get help in some kind of institution.) He used to host the pre-9/11 9am classical radio program on WNYC, and he would have these stream of consciousness rambling sessions between classical tidbits. Then, as I said before, he disappeared. After 9/11, the station changed its format, so there was no more classical music in the mornings. I thought I had lost Steve Post forever.  One day about two years ago, I was driving back from Wegman's in Manalapan (joy!) and heard a familiar voice. It was Steve Post! He no longer bothered with much music, unless it related directly to whatever inner dialog he decided to share over the airwaves. There's something about talk radio...I dunno...it gives me mixed feelings. As a child, I was forced to listen to the right wing Washington, DC propaganda imposed on me by my conservative, overbearing father. More pleasant memories are those of scratchy AM radio broadcasts of baseball games--usually the Phillies against whoever--as we trekked between home (DC) and extended family (Philly). Baseball always comforted me, but now I'm finally at a point where other talk radio programs don't grate on my nerves anymore. In fact, I've been listening to Randi Rhodes on Air America on my way home from work lately. Now that the NYC pledge drive is over, I may go back to ATC...  Geez. Does anybody really care?

      So I missed  This American Life  for the third weekend in a row.  I'm so so so amazed by that show.  It has made me laugh hysterically, amazed me with insight, and even made me cry.  Not that it takes alot to make me cry though.  As anyone that knows me has seen or heard, I've cried most recently during the following movies, concerts and radio shows:  Sleater Kinney at the Beachland Ballroom Sonic Youth in Central Park Everynight on tour with Disengage  Big Fish 21 Grams  Pankration at the Lime Spider Dead Low Tide at the Grog Shop The episode of  This American Life  where the kid tried to kill himself by taking a gasoline bath and then lighting it.  Bowling for Columbine  In my back yard, when I saw three soldiers from the Civil War  I don't know if they're tears of joy or what really.  I think musically it's that I want to be able to move someone the way those bands moved me and sometimes feel I'll never be able to. The other times I'm just a big baby who is confused about and can't contain his own emotions.  Mediums limit. Sometimes Mediums see ghosts.  Wow, did I just tell you all about my psychosis like you cared?

      Well folks it's a whole new look for Manipulated Media. The template lost a few good comments, but all in all I think the site is more streamlined with the new features. Also, I've got two people signed up to blog with me so far. If anyone else is up for it, go ahead. I'll check in later this weekend.

      I haven't posted in a few days, so I feel like I should. Despite the fact that I don't have anything to say. I'm really thinking about giving other people the capability to make actual posts on this site. There's a way to do it. If anybody wants me to to allow them to post, let me know. What's the vote on the new commenting system by the way? Does everybody like it?   Newsworthy: I shaved off the beard. Sorry folks, made some mistakes last night with the razor and one thing lead to another. The reason I don't have anything to say is because I've given myself over to the fish gods. It's all I do and think about outside of work. A special thanks to the crew that's coming out here this weekend. NATE MATTI AND GRAMPS! Look out. Booze ahead. And I'm advertising for Skies Bleed Black. Come to Jersey for vacation during the week of July 19-23. They're playing the Brighton Bar in Long Branch, Wednesday, July 21. Wish I had something better for you.

      I'm sick of Abu Ghraib. Seriously. It's just grating now. There is nothing insightful left to say about it. So shut up. I'm also sick of the 9/11 hearings. You guys can shut the hell up too. Planes crashed into fucking buildings. There is going to be some confusion. Shut up. And I'm sick of the NPR fund drive. There's 3 causes I should donate to: the Kerry Campaign, the ACLU, and NPR. Quit reminding me that I'm too broke to donate. All I really want to hear about right now is my beard. I'm growing a beard.

      I was in Point Pleasant, NJ for the first time yesterday. That area illustrates the definitive Jersey culture. It's far enough away from NYC's trendster grip to be cheezy and 15 years behind the times without irony. Very cool.   While I was there, I saw something that really made me think. It was one of those letter stickers, like the ones that say OBX (stands for Outer Banks) or LBI (Long Beach Island) etc. This one said GHB, a black circle, black letters, and a white background and underneath the web site www.gohomebennies.com. A Benny, for those of you outside of NJ is a beach tourist from Bayonne, Elizabeth, Newark, or New York. Each first letter of each town spells out Benny. The rotten bastards take all the parking spots, wear gold chains, get driven around in stretch hummers. Think, Sopranos.  Anyway, I didn't stop and thiink about the Bennies as much as I thought about the idea of the sticker. That's a great idea, something everybody thinks about. Why couldn't anybody come up with something that easy and market the hell out of it? So I got to thinking, maybe I need to come up with something to make and sell. If you think of something for me to have made and sell, let me know.

      There's a not so new rumor circulating about the return of Andy Kaufman. Why is this noteworthy, you might ask? Well, the rumor (and all evidence) has been blogged into the mainstream.

Where the fuck does he come up with these numbers? Who the hell is measuring this shit? Three out of five cell members have made it to the U.S. but only one of them has access to an airport, divided by the number of fake I.D.s. If I carry the two...

      I'm still getting used to this. I even had to upgrade my Internet Explorer browser (now the new and improved 5.1 for Macintosh), which always frightens me. Ah, the good old days, when every time you upgraded a piece of software, you lost everything. Sounds like the comments section of this Blog, doesn't it? I guess I'm not the only one getting used to this thing.  Glad to be back blogging, and I hope Sean doesn't drift away permanently. I enjoy his insights on those rare instances when I can understand them.

      Looks like I've completely lost control of this thing. Great.   Since the talk of the town has been public radio, I'll mention that I heard something today on AM 820 (WNYC) that made me extremely happy. It was a piece of the best short fiction I've ever experienced, being read by a great voice actor. The story was David Schickler's "The Smoker", which appeared in the New Yorker. It was read by Robert Sean Leonard of Dead Poet's Society fame. And I swear to the pagan gods of radio that I will donate to WNYC. Next time.  Other news to note: my guests are gone. Pops, Nate, and Matti have hit the hard road back to the midwest. We drank. We fished. We drank. We fished. We drank... All of us spent our rent money on big fish and finnicky women. Or maybe we spent our money on big women and finnicky fish. Who's gonna tell? Gramps is a babe magnet. Bottom line. (If you want the real story on the fish and the eventual pictures, go to the surf fishing journal.)  Yesterday we made our weary way into Brooklyn, to discover what the sixth largest city in the nation if you pulled it out of NYC had to offer. The drive over the Goethals and Verrazano Bridges is awe inspiring. It's not like the feeling you get when you crawl out from under Madison Square Garden. When you look up at the buildings crowding the sky in Manhattan, you get the impression that this is all so immutable, that the city had been there forever and would never change. But leapfrogging onto the lush swamp that Staten Island really is, and then descending into the Belt in Brooklyn, one might understand why this place became the cultural soul of Western civilization. I can imagine how amazing this place must have been 300 years ago: humid islands, rivers brimming with schools of fish, the ocean tides running through reedy marshes. We really fucked the Native Americans.  While in Brooklyn, we took my landlady's advice and drove north on Flatbush Avenue. She said we might get "a good cross section of what Brooklyn is like." We sure did. The Flatbush Avenue gauntlet should only be attempted by experienced stunt drivers. There are more open markets, Caribbean bakeries, and hair accessory shops than any whitebread midwesterners have ever seen. You're looking at all of these signs and in these windows, just taking it all in, because you've never seen these things before (in a xenophobic world where everyone sees the same things all of the time, the experience can be jarring). And on top of that, pedestrians don't seem to care that cars outweigh them exponentially, and pose a hazard to their general well being. Finally, everyone drives like an ass. Somehow I managed to take Pop's new Honda Accord from Sheepshead Bay to Park Slope without incident. Unfortunately, not everyone on the road that day was so lucky. We watched a minivan clip a pickup truck in the lane across from us. The collision sent both cars over curbs and the pickup smashed through an abandoned storefront. Could have been us.

      Radio is amazing as the bosslady says.  The business however sucks.  At least on the corporate side.  Having worked for the evil empire/media giant we all love to hate for 2 years, I saw the ruthlessness and lack of compassion it's known for.  I saw great people who worked there canned, because they were going to go to automation.  I saw a great man, an integral part to the marketing promotions department "let go" because they wanted to cut costs.  I saw a program director who loved programming but was forced to succumb to a daily running sheet of what was "hot".  He played only what was handed down by a gentleman named Pig Vomit and this list from Pig Vomit was from someone working in an office in San Antonio seeing dollar signs as they looked at their "star" calendars.  It's all who your in bed with I guess.  And then last week, WOXY 97X goes off the air.  The only true alternative in my mind.  Independently owned and superbly amazing. Sold to a Texas conglomerate.  Go figure. R.I.P. Captain Murphy and WOXY 97X

      Even bad movies/books/plays etc. have the ability to make one think, as evidenced this weekend by sitting through Troy and finally finishing "Skinny Legs And All" by Tom Robbins (for a full account of that ordeal, go to Recommended Reading). Both stories heavy-handedly addressed the issue of motivation. Why do we do the things we do?  Both Skinny Legs and Troy beat the dead horse of faith and messianic hopes with the bluntest possible objects. Faith is DUM. Whatever. But neither really explored the more interesting aspects of that behavior, such as why intelligent, otherwise rational people would put their fate in the hands of Apollo, the 2nd coming, or Zionistic lunacy. Why would people do that? That is interesting. What's not is the cookie cutter role of the zealot. What is it that allows these people to ignore reality, and what is the reality that they percieve?   Brad Pitt's character (who seems to have taken the Keanu Quaalude Cocktail; What the fuck happened to Fight Club? 12 Monkeys?) Achilles operates solely for the glory of his own name. Which might be interesting if you could get him to quit pouting, spouting cliches, and showing you the side of his naked ass long enough to care.  The only interesting character in Troy is Paris, whose purpose is the valiant pursuit of tail. I love the bravado, the cowering, the opportunistic killing of a "hero". That is the true face of humanity. It's the opportunity, the luck that lets a lesser man (and we're all lesser men) make the name for himself. We want to be brave, to fight an impossible fight, but no one wants to die. And faced with the option to save your life, you or I would cower at our savior's feet. And that is fucking interesting.

      We have a Death Pool in our office and the rich get richer. The back of the office picks a bunch of dying celebrities and throws the numbers in a hat, and people draw names. I don't get in it because I don't have the $5-$10 to spare ($$$=DRINKS!). Last week a sales guy won with Ronnie. Why am I commenting about this? Because I would be pissed off if somebody would have thought to put Ray Charles in. Have fun with the Gipper, but you don't fuck with the father of soul.  All in all it's been a good day for the U.S. at the G-8 summit. The new president of the Iraqi interim government, President (Ghazi) al-Yawer actually thanked America for sacrificing lives for the "freedom" of Iraq. Which is a nice step, considering that this isn't a man that GW hand picked. No kingmaking here. Not only that, but Bush seemed to chum up with Jacques Chirac and Gerhard Schröder. Which is really good for the rest of the world, really. We're not enemies. So if you can put politics aside (which is damn impossible for all of us Bush haters), today might be a good day for foreign policy.

      As most of you know, I love the New Yorker. I never have a bad thing to say. But this issue sucks (June 14 & 21). The Summer Fiction Issue. My problem with this issue isn't the content (even though it has 3 stories from Alice Munro, who I just don't get, but that's my problem), it's the ads. This new style of ads is interspersed about every ten pages throughout the giant issue. There's an interactive iPod ad, New Yorker Festival ad, Target ad, AIG, Mini Cooper, etc. All of them have this interactive aspect, they're made out of hard cardboard, and make the issue almost impossible to read because they're so stiff. Shame. How can you take the moral/humanist high ground on every topic imaginable when you're compromising yourself and your readership with ridiculously intrusive ads?

      So Putin is going to sign the Kyoto climate change treaty, which would mean we would have to comply despite Bush's refusal to sign. For the agreement to be ratified, it needs the support of the developed nations responsible for 55% of carbon dioxide emissions. Russia would put it over the edge. Therefore, U.S. companies would have to exchange carbon credits for HFCs. Which would completely fuck the HVAC industry initially. Why is Russia doing this? Because the EU wants them to sign and they will support Russia's membership into the WTO. Will it happen? Putin says it will. It'll be a nice swift kick in Bush's balls for seeking to break the the Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty.   And for all you raving anti-Reagan maniacs, I hope Ronnie ends up on the ten dollar bill. Who the hell was Alexander Hamilton anyway?  PREDICTION! The Corporation for Public Broadcasting will be a Neo-conservative megaphone by 2007 if Bush steals the election again.

      Is it bad that when we stopped at Sheetz last night after the trans am show, I saw the cover of the Beacon and laughed?  Regan's funeral, Nancy crying on the casket and I laughed.   Maybe that's because of my concussion.    When this kind of fire starts, it is very hard to put out. The tender boughs of innocence burn first, and the wind rises, and then all goodness is in jeopardy.  D'ya think that if you were falling in space... that you'd slow down after a while, or go faster and faster?   Faster and faster... until after a while you wouldn't FEEL anything; and then your body would just burst into FIRE. And the angel's wouldn't help you, 'cause they've all gone away...

      Ronald Reagan died and we're all supposed to be mourning the loss of a great American. My memories aren't that fond, but those that I have leave a bad taste in my mouth...sort of like the morning breath you get after a night of heavy drinking. Sure, the U.S. was prosperous during Reagan's administration, but it was one of the greediest, most selfish eras that I can remember. In fact, it's my opinion that Reagan's reign can take some of the "credit" for the current state of affairs (a la George W.).  To make matters worse, I think Ronnie has been gone for a while, but they've been saving this announcement for a time when Georgie's policies and physical presence are being protested throughout Europe (even the Pope doesn't like him). It warms my heart to see the French and Italians protesting against George and his policies, not all Americans. Thank goodness they're not as narrowminded as we are.  How many people think Osama's capture will be announced the next time Georgie's popularity ratings drop to another all time low?

      Today's my ex-girlfriend's birthday. And I'm not going to do anything about it. No pathetic overtures for her affection, no bitter rants, no calendar burning. Yes, it's the first day of my adult life. I can feel my testosterone dropping, my gut sagging. You can almost hear the hairs falling out of my scalp and hitting my keyboard. In accordance with my new status as an adult, I am starting to work ahead on the August issue of my magazine since I will be on vacation throughout July. Planning ahead has never been a strong suit. But I've never been paid to go on vacation either. Maybe I'll go to a happy hour tonight, hit a few golf balls, and get my oil changed. $20 bucks says I won't even make an ass of myself at John's wedding tomorrow. Does anyone know anything about 401Ks? The end of an era.

      In keeping with Brother Whip's recently reported manifestations of spectral disturbance, I'd like to mention that Adam "Breathlikebutt" Saylor has moved into the House of the Dead. Rumors abound, yet no one knows the real story. Facts: previous occupant committed suicide by putting her head in the oven, certain parts of the floor smell like BBQ, Adam is getting a killer deal on the place. Speculations: Haunted as balls, creeping dread, flying objects, flickering lights, creepy handprints, stains, and burnt pajamas might be from previous occupant. Questions: Did she die in the kitchen or in the hospital/ambulance? Does it matter either way? Had she ever heard of a gun? Sleeping pills? It should be noted, that it will take more than a spook to keep Adam away from a good deal. Hopefully Breathlikebutt will keep us all informed of any updates.  Top stories to watch:   The 9/11 commission found that Iraq had nothing to do with the plot on the WTC/Pentagon. But a guest on the Brian Lehrer show today discussed a meeting where Al Qaeda planners met with a colonel of the Iraqi regime. Iraq and probably half the world was cheering for us to be knocked down a notch. But was there some involvement, politics aside? Does anybody know about this meeting and why it was deemed irrelevant?  Nonprofit Hospitals Said to Overcharge Uninsured (look at the link/NYTIMES article). Never thought I'd be excited about someone suing a nonprofit hospital, but I hope they stick it to these fuckers. Any words?  Lastly, the NRA has started its own radio station to get around campaign finance laws. I'm a gun carrying American (...from my cold, dead hands) and I hate the NRA. They'll probably get shut down, but damn. YOU MANIACS!

      Conversations with Neil about altruism, the arbitrariness of life, and Nietzche:  Cause of 'altruism'.-- Men have on the whole spoken of love with such emphasis and so idolized it because they have had little of it and have never been allowed to eat their fill of this food: thus it became for them 'food of the gods'. Let a poet depict a utopia in which there obtains universal love, he will certainly have to describe a painful and ludicrous state of affairs the like of which the earth has never yet seen - everyone worshipped, encumbered and desired, not by one lover, as happens now, but by thousands, indeed by everyone else, as the result of an uncontrollable drive which would then be as greatly execrated and cursed as selfishness had been in former times; and the poets in that state of things - provided that they were left alone long enough to write - would dream of nothing but the happy, loveless past, of divine selfishness, of how it was once possible to be alone, undisturbed, unloved, hated, despised on earth, and whatever else may characterize the utter baseness of the dear animal world in which we live.  from Nietzsche's Daybreak,s. 147, R.J. Hollingdale transl  Me: Put this in plain English for me. I want to post it on my site.  Neil: Can't do that its Nietzsche... he's saying that if we had too much love and affection we would yearn to be lonely and dissatisfied in the same way that we yearn to be loved today.  Me: I yearn to drink Draino.  Neil: ahh my boy, but you don't see, you love the life you have created for yourself.. its more fun to step sideways while others walk a straight line - gives me a certain zest for life that i would not have otherwise...  Me: Doesn't the arbitrariness that Nietzsche is talking about make you want to dive off a building?  Neil: No, i work in a cubicle for a multi billion dollar mega banking conglomerate.. but our lives are only as arbitrary as the meaning that we assign to them.. sometimes arbitrary isn't so bad... so what if life has no meaning.. it frees us up to paint our own picture instead of having an agenda placed upon us.. clean slate.. fuck it lets roll.  we can do anything now.   Me: The boundless possibility and despair of existentialism. Helpful.

      So lately I've become obsessed with the Beats. I'm putting together notes for an article on Allen Ginsberg that I'm writing. But what is it about these people that attracts me? Kesey wrote my favorite novel, On The Road almost changed my life, and "A Supermarket In California" is probably in my top 3 poems of all time.  The ego of the beat poet is sloppy, singular, phallic. Writing journal entries and deeming them canon. How is my overeducated underworked generation of writers going to compare?  Ginsberg was young and arrogant, confident in his abilities. He was so fallible that greatness seemed attainable to other people. That's what is exciting. And the biography. These men lived differently than writers today. Kesey was an Oregon state wrestling champion. Burroughs traveled some of the darkest gutters of Tunisia, Europe, the Louisiana bayou in a heroin stupor. Ginsberg had to authorize his mother's lobotomy.   In business news, I'm back from Chicago. There are so many bums here. Not like NYC, where they've been beaten down. A joke gets me. Guy sees me running on Sunday and yells "slow down, the liquor store don't close till eleven." I had to give him a dollar. That night I gave a guy named Daryl a dollar. He asked me to buy him a room for the night. Yesterday I watched a guy dig through the ashtray in front of the hotel for unfinished cigarette butts. I told him I wish I could help. You could if you wanted to, he said.   After NeoCon, my impression of the furniture business is poor. All of these people get together to spend time and money and all that they can accomplish is this? Selling each other more furniture?

      Under attack! The Internet is under attack! Man the battlestations, hide your credit cards, shut off the web cams. The hackers are coming to terrorize your data files. Damn you! DAMN YOU!   Oh wait, I've got a Mac. Ha ha ha ha ha....  so here's my social security number: 987 989 3948; my Visa debit card nuber with exp date: 9384 9384 5 9384 5/05; and my blood type O+. Go nuts guys. Drinks is on the house!   I just wanted to get in on the paranoia, something to blame my shitty credit record on. Do you really think it's hackers? Or is it Ashcroft trying to watch you through your monitor, look at him behind the glass, there he IS!

      I actually went to Howard Stern's Web page this morning to see what his censorship was all about, and I stumbled on the following link: http://www.toostupidtobepresident.com  Visit and see!

      Listening to Howard Stern this morning (it happens sometimes when I forget to turn back to NPR at night), and it was a little sad. Stern is going off the air. He's a fixture and a lot of people loved him in the Midwest. I just loved the fact that he was there. But within the next few weeks, Stern will start playing records to fulfill his contract, effectively ending the show. The Bush Administration and Mike Powell (Colin's son the FCC Chairman) may have won this little battle, but they probably underestimate Stern's audience. He's been bashing Bush steady for a while, telling his listeners to vote him out of office.   When people talk about the Kennedy assassination, they always ask "Where were you when you heard?" I'm sure it's going to be the same way for 9/11. Where were you when you heard? I was listening to Stern and it came through before anyone even knew what was happening. I'll never forget going to the gym afterward, and no one believed me.

      Why I hate live music in Jersey:  "Last thing I remember is being shocked by the mic about 5 times and ending up with my head next to my amp and grinding it into the floor screaming something, I can't remember what it was but it felt good. Joanne looked real scared when I came out into the crowd and jumped on the bar, Larry flicked me off, and I think another guy thought I was flirting with either his girlfriend or him, well maybe both, but I had a rock show to put on so I was flirting with the whole crowd. Hoping someone would "take me home". God I love rock n' roll. "  That is from Brother Whip's show last Friday that I would've given anything to have attended. Instead, I watched bands play at the Brighton Bar (our equivalent to the Spider/Ron's Crossroads). It makes me sick. I watch semi-talented bands playing halfway decent music, but nobody cared one bit about it. Not the crowd, not the people playing, and especially not the singers. I've never seen anything like the people from home. Granted I've been spoiled, with my role models and idols coming from the likes of Brother Whip himself, David from Skies Bleed Black, Jeff Fahl from Hate Theory, Josh from Dolly Trauma, and life changing experiences with the Murder City Devils and At The Drive In. But I just assume that that is how music is meant to be expressed, through gut wrenching connection between people. Connect, flirt, expose your soul. Perform. What the hell else are you supposed to be doing up there?   All drunk, I grabbed the booking agent/co-owner/bouncer and drug him outside to tell him (during the headlining band's set) that Skies Bleed Black would bury this place and he would never see anything like it again, and that he needed to come to Ohio to see how real music was played, and that no one here cared about it, that they had to sell me the music, but they couldn't.   Luckily, he was all drunk the next night and saw me walking past his bar. He drug me in and made me watch his band. The guy is maybe 50 and looks like my buddy Stone with a beard down to his navel. He screamed like a maniac and dumped Miller High Life all over his bald head while kicking over his own mic stand. He was redeemed.

      Two of my favorite past times (Books and Bush-bashing) have combined in a horrible and unforseen way. Ray Bradbury is offended and pissed off about Michael Moore using the title of his classic novel for his movie Farenheit 9/11. And rightly so. Bradbury had contacted Moore's people six months ago, but no one had called the 80-something year old genius back. So fuck Moore. I agree with Ray, change the name. That's all that he wants, no litigation, just to "settle it like gentlemen," according to Bradbury. Moore needs to get his head out of his huge ass every once in a while to ask peoples' permission. I'm annoyed because I liked the name, loved the novel, and was really excited about the movie. Once again I'm forced to separate the art from the artist.

      Been thinking a lot about the stupid things that isolate people from each other. Could there be a more superficial way to judge whomever you or I associate with on the basis of a person's purchasing habits? We do it all the time. We tend to align ourselves with people who read, watch, eat, wear, drive, and/or/etc. listen to the same things we do. It may be an offshoot of a larger issue, the self-defining ritual known as shopping. We buy our personas. Which I can deal with. What I can't deal with is disliking people on the basis of elitist or ignorant preferences.   Example: I think pro sports are the biggest waste of fucking time in the world. I'm an elitist prick. Should I judge and dislike the hotdog munching morons? Nope. I like quite a few people that can rattle off MLB stats. Should they dislike me because I've never seen an episode of Friends? Because I don't own any Yankee paraphenalia? Nope. This seems self explanatory, but it's not. I'm too sunburnt to make sense of this right now. I hope you get the basic point. Buy your Rod Stewart albums you tasteless fucks! We'll hang out anyway.  I've noticed that the number of commentors has gone down. But I know you're out there, still reading.

      I'm leaving on a jet plane... I don't know when I'll be back again. Actually, I do. I'll be back July 13. Here are some things to think about while I'm gone:  "The U.S. Army and the DuPont Company were planning to dispose of 1,200 tons of VX nerve gas by mixing it with sodium hydroxide and hot water and then dumping it into the Delaware River in New Jersey" -Harpers  "There has been much tut-tutting by pundits who complain that the movie, though it has yet to be caught in any major factual errors, uses association and innuendo to create false impressions. Many of these same pundits consider it bad form to make a big fuss about the Bush administration's use of association and innuendo to link the Iraq war to 9/11. Why hold a self-proclaimed polemicist to a higher standard than you hold the president of the United States?  And for all its flaws, "Fahrenheit 9/11" performs an essential service. It would be a better movie if it didn't promote a few unproven conspiracy theories, but those theories aren't the reason why millions of people who aren't die-hard Bush-haters are flocking to see it. These people see the film to learn true stories they should have heard elsewhere, but didn't. Mr. Moore may not be considered respectable, but his film is a hit because the respectable media haven't been doing their job.   For example, audiences are shocked by the now-famous seven minutes, when George Bush knew the nation was under attack but continued reading "My Pet Goat" with a group of children. Nobody had told them that the tales of Mr. Bush's decisiveness and bravery on that day were pure fiction." -NY Times OP-ED July 2, 2004 Paul Krugman  Try not to gag July 4th. Rah rah rah...

      The countdown begins... the curse of Canada is inevitable. Every year something horrible happens at home while I'm in Canada for the annual Lake Esnagi pilgramage. It has to, in a karmic sense, balance out. And it is a religious excursion, no doubt. In fact, fishing with my dad and brother is probably the closest I will ever be to zen, rapture, etc. At one with the universe, spending 14 hours on a boat each day in the middle of Ontario with no phone, no blog, not a goddamn extraneous thing beyond food, beer, and the wilds of Lake Esnagi. Moose, bear, loons wailing at sundown, the howling openess of lonely water with no one around but the men you've grown up with. The lake is so familiar after all of these years that it is the closest thing to a home I have. It never changes, while everything else around me seems to have the permenance of a fart in the wind.

      I'm back in the USA for a couple days (heading to Canada again Saturday mornin'). I haven't been fishing in days, there's a ridiculous pile of shit on my desk, and I'm planning to finish most of my galleys for the August issue before I leave for vacation on Friday. None of this bodes well for my well being. Also, today is my one year anniversary in the Dirty Jerz. June 30th last year was my 1st day at TFM. And none of my editorial commrades are here to celebrate it. Where's my cake? It's a sad day, no Bosslady (will we ever see each other again?) and no JP (honeymooning forever). I'm a sad little man in a lonely cube farm.  I'm sending out a request for someone to help me find the song Wayfaring Stranger. Supposedly Jack White covered it on the Cold Mountain soundtrack, but I can't seem to find any audio versions online. If you can find a link to the song or burn me a CD, I'll owe you my constant blog allegiance.

      All right! Lot's of shit going on down there. I hope anonymous puts up a blog or keeps posting on this one. The problem with the white liberal left is that we're satisfied people who don't like conflicting opinions any more than the Neoconservative maniacs. I think that Clinton and Bush both failed on intelligence. But I think G.W. Bush gained more than he would have imagined (financially, politically, etc.) from 9/11. I think he's a moron and dangerous, but probably a very accurate caricature of the face of the American public. Just look around you, look at the military overseas, look at what we do to each other. People don't even care about their own families, let alone people from other cultures on the other side of the world that may or may not pose a threat to our current luxury lifestyles. I can't believe we haven't mowed over the Middle East already. But enough of this crap. I say, be out for number one or be a secular humanist; move to Africa and get killed by a 12 year old kid with a machete while you pass out bags of grain. Don't pretend to do things for global interests, world peace, and the goodwill of man when they're all self serving actions. Let's at least be honest with ourselves.  More importantly though, last night I saw the greatest rock and roll show ever. You must see The Fever (dark, dance, synth, screeching telecaster). Their singer is up there in the Texas Tuxedo, switching vocals between something like Michael Jackson on Peyote and the Jesus Lizard. Then came Death From Above. And nothing will prepare you for a live show with these two men. One guy plays bass, the other drums and sings. And I've never been happier in my life than I was on their opening song. You can't imagine it. Just go see them and make yourself happy.   Heading home today. Business travel, business casual, bite me. Thanks.

      After being turned away for the 9:20 pm show Friday night, I got in to see "Farenheit 9/11" with Joe last night. No big surprises, but it was all still like experiencing a bad dream. Everyone should see it. Some things were over the top in the typical Michael Moore fashion, but others spoke for themselves. I only hope this country wakes up in time.

      Greetings from Maple Leaf Land, I'm in Toronto getting ready to expatriate. Everyone here is very accommodating, very sweet. I've never seen anything like this. The waitresses, the bar flies, the hotel people are ridiculously helpful. I've noticed that the streets are cleaner than any other city I've been in, but the stench coming from underground is nearly unbearable.  So I need to rethink my take on country music. Last night we went to a memorial tribute to the late, great, Ray Condo (I've never heard of him either), Canadian rockabilly legend and front man of the Hardrock Goners. Everyone in the alt-country scene came out to this very cool club called the Horseshoe tavern and paid respect to this man that died recently at the tender age of 53. Different musicians came up and played all night with a steel guitar/fiddle band that could play with anything the rotating musicians came up with. By far the greatest song of the night was a sad ballad called The Wayfaring Stranger. I have to look up who has a recording of this. I think I need to find it or die. It made me shudder, like geese walking on your grave baby. Another nice touch was this song that's been recorded by Johnny Cash and was on a commercial recently, "I've been every where man, I've been everywhere..." Etc. Rocked.  Other happenings include, finishing The Master and Margarita. Damn near finishing Junky by W.S. Burroughs. Saw Fahrenheit 9/11 and thought it was well done, but not going to change anyone's mind about anything, except perhaps the empty quality of one's own life. Finished season 1 of The Office (BBC), interesting ideas in the last episode, great show really. A little hypocritical to be promoting a TV show, but as Whitman says, "I contradict myself..."

      My Fruit20 seems to have reappeared, magically. I'm guessing that it's mine, or else someone inadvertently drank mine and snuck a replacement back into the fridge. I apologize to my co-workers for slandering them. They are all very decent people.  I do wish I could write angst filled, poetic musings like Matt and Sean, but I'm just not an angry young man. (Angry old broad who's not all that angry just doesn't inspire.) I can rant with the best of them, but rants are rarely poetic. I know; I'll go immerse myself in work. That's what I'm supposed to be doing anyway.

      Unfortunately I can't use the comment button right now, but this works just as well I guess.  First of all, Bosslady, the fact that you spent the 4th of July watching Ken Burns' Civil War series tells me that you really are cool, so you gotta believe that.  I was lucky enough to have a senior high school class devoted entirely to that series.  Which, by the way Celsius, is probably why I'm anti-war or a conspiracy theorist.  I don't always love the USA, but let me clarify, when I say that, I mean I don't love the administration and way our government works, and I'm not gonna fake it, just to seem patriotic.  As Sleater Kinney says... Since when is skepticism unAmerican?  I've been to other countries so it's not like I'm saying that from a close minded point of view.  Likewise, all of my family has been in the military, all my cousins, uncles and Father.  One uncle, was in the Army for 25 years.  He would probably say the same thing as you, with a beer in one hand and his poor Mississippi born children crying in the other.  But he didn't know any difference, he joined when he was 16.  Our history? General Custer died with shit in his pants.  Edwards and Kerry? I'm seeing a tough fight for the GOP.

      That's right baby, I'm taking my blog back!!! 3 posts in one day.   So the GOP hit up Mike Ditka to run for senate in IL against a popular young Dem named Obama (see New Yorker article, below right). He refused. Thank God, since I really liked the Bears when I was a little kid in the Midwest. But shouldn't somebody be blasting those pigs (sorry guys, not partisan usually but you got that maniac GW elected) in the Rep. party for currying favor with voters by using celebrity over substance? Remember when the idea of Arnold running for governor was funny? You were like, "Hey! I'd vote for that guy!" And guess what, people did. And Arnold probably isn't doing a bad job, but lefties are missing a good chance to hit those republican chodes where it hurts; their blessed "credibility".

      Finally returning to the high seas tonight, so there will be something new on the NJ surf fishing journal tomorrow. Also plan on rambling about the Kesey book I've been reading on the Reading site. Baltimore manana, if things work out with the family Jeepster. She's not happy about the trip, but tough titty said the kitty when the milk went dry. Talked to Murdock, and man does that guy have a story to tell. I need to dial into that guy's brain soon. Maybe fly to Charlotte next month. Other than that, it's work work work, coffee coffee coffee. Till I'm about to chuck. I'm so hyped on caffeine, you don't even know! I typed this in like ten seconds. Super juiced. Proper.

      Ramblings from the plane/train rides home:  -Are we Whitman's fabled damned? A question that's haunted me lately. Or will this self-correcting, healing, organic world endure us? How long have we been here? Just a blip. So maybe we won't be a part of evolution's the next draft for life on this planet. An abberant, extinct species. Revision.  -What is the size of an idea? A belief? A universal TRUTH? Democracy? The Body of Christ? Cheap faith in constants and day to day infinities. I just pissed in a toilet flying 30,000 feet over the world with nonchalance. I do this every week. It is constant and real to expect this experience. We are gods. Irrational, jealous, brilliant gods. Benevolent, servile gods. Pitiful, merciful, impotent worms. We create a world around us, richer, newer, and more real than the "realness" accepted en masse. And it's hard to wrap my mind around that.  -It's a desperate, raining night in Newark and I feel like a new man. Even the fluorescent lights, steel girders seem poetic, industrial, and hopelessly lonely. It's good to be home. There's a constant humming, strange people passing me crying, sameness and otherness. We're isolated here. Waiting for a train, watching the minutes tick off a screen while disappointed people check to see how close they came to getting home an hour earlier. I missed my train by seconds.  -I want to work on a fishing boat, to hone in on physical discomfort, the body's struggle against the elements and the limits of fatigue. I want coffee to taste better, sex to be sweeter and more urgent, and people happy to see me every time I set foot on land.  Anyhow, it's good to be back. I'm off to Baltimore this weekend to make Breathlikebutt admit his condo is haunted. Other than that, I'm laying low and trying to keep the promises I make to myself every year in Canada. Sending a big hello out to the Brothers Poulsen, who should be checking in soon. In case you're all interested, my photos from the trip are up, the link is at the bottom right of the links list, Esnagi Lake 2004.

I'm actually ahead of the game, thanks to some help from those who found it in their hearts to have mercy on me.  Good thing I'm leaving the country in a few days. I don't know if I'll come back.

      Well, the tour is over. But the fun is just beginning. Hellfest all weekend. The boys scared everyone out of the bar last night. Opening act was a lame ass band from Trenton that sounded like Staind. They played for about 3 people. Then the second band (The Green Room) played a really great set. But they need to either get a new singer or have him drop the act. The shaking, face painted, robe wearing guy did an ok job of singing, but the rest of the band makes the show worthwhile if you can ignore him. DW and Co. literally cleared the bar, first song. The sound was OK, but they still do this thing I hate (which Hate Theory did up until about the last year they were together), which is set their guitar sound at this scooped out frequency, all low end and treble hiss. It doesn't come through though. You get hiss and a general sense of what's going on, but you miss how well they're playing. All right, I'm going back to indexing old issues.

      Update: Met the boys after work yesterday and made everyone go to the beach. We swam in jellyfish spawn, thick as noodles, but had a good time since the ocean is 74 degrees right now. Big waves yesterday too. Bonus. We cooked 10lbs of hotdogs, drank a billion cokes, and ate a watermelon. Then I got lucky and finally got through to the local college station (WMCX RULES), who told us to come down to the studio. The eight of us stormed the place and they played both of the Skies Bleed Black songs and interviewed DW and Nick Squizzle. After that we went to this record store and made friends with the cashiers, gave them a CD and put up a flier. I had the brilliant idea of doing more promotions, so we then went down to the boardwalk at Point Pleasant and passed out fliers to babes and people that looked like they would actually come to a concert. Uncle Frank (nicest guy ever) almost beat up a 14 year old, but that's Dirty Jerz. White Fucking Trash. I figured I'd tired them out enough to be quiet for Eileen, and it kind of worked. Praise Jehova. So in my room, I've got air conditioning, which makes it sweet. But there's a lot of man meat in my two little rooms, and it's only going to get worse as the weekend progresses (The Falling Stars Burn Bright crew is supposed to show up today and KP, my brother, and his pals have expressed interest in coming this way). Luckily for my landlady, this shit is only going on for another week, since she's renting out my guest room come Aug 1st. Took everybody to Red Bank at lunch, so hopefully Jay & Silent Bob's Secret Stash and the other shit will keep them occupied till I get out of here. I'm already in trouble with the landlady's neighbors. Big show tonight. Everybody come. I might even sing.

      Well, you bunch of uberwimps, I have been here since 8:30 am, and there's no one here to greet me or eat their delicious Belgian chockies or drink their fantastic Belgian beer (yes Matt, save one for Sean. I promised it to him and you have four of your own).  I still feel like I'm on a plane right now, and I almost forgot to pick up my son from camp last night. When I did get him (at about 5:59pm--one minute before they call DYFS), I was greeted by his counsellor who happened to be holding a purple "report."  Apparently, my little "angel" hit a girl yesterday. They were scuffling over a water balloon (excuse me, but why are 13-14 year old kids having a water balloon fight? Doesn't that seem like a dumb idea to anyone but non-violent me?), and this girl stole and burst the aforementioned balloon in question. This just pushed my boy over the edge, and he punched her in the stomach. Gee it's good to be back home...  Our driver retrieved us from JFK, and took a "shortcut" through Manhattan. It was my first trip past the site of the WTC, ironically in the news today on two accounts: first, Liebskind and Silverstein are intangled in a lawsuit over payment of fees, and second, the 9/11 commission releases its report to the public at 11:30 am Eastern Daylight Time.  Rambling here, I don't know up from down today, but I am pleased to know I was missed by someone other than my kid and my cat. I tried to post from Brussels, but the Internet cafe I visited had a European keyboard. Sounds minor, but all of the keys and punctuation were in different places, making it nearly impossible to type anything more than two simple sentences. What's my excuse now?

      And so begins my leg of the Skies Bleed Black Tour. DW & Co. will be descending on my pad around lunch time today, and will be staying throughout the weekend. I'm sure my landlady will find the experience INTENSE. It will be something new for her, a woman who raised 2 daughters, to host 10 (estimated) teenage guys in her home. I'll try to keep everyone out of each other's way. Come see the show tomorrow night at the Brighton Bar in Long Branch.  Cranking out the issue and missing the Bosslady. Will she ever come home?  Does anybody out there want to get married and move to Alaska with me? Just checking. Or maybe start a business importing unattractive, single women into Anchorage for all those lonely, crusty, mountain men?   E-mail is spotty at best, and the Tank is more frustrated than an Alaskan trapper on a Viagra bender.

      The e-mail is still down... going dark now... I can't feel my legs. People are getting hysterical. Life and death hang in the balance, sort of. IT-guy Frank is calm, Zen like, as if he were a condemned man. He is doomed to this course, like the orbit of a planet. Some of us here are braver than others. We're going to get through this thing together. Someone just lit their cube on fire. I've gotta go...

      My e-mail is down until further notice, so if you've got something to say, say it here. Frank the Tank is on it, but the machines have us by the short and curlies here at the office. I'm going to give it till 3:30 before pandemonium breaks out and the sales people string Tank up by his toes.

      Nothing to say... nothing to say... nothing.   Hey you in your big ass car with your NJ plates, racing through the merge. I want you to explode into a fire ball. I want your jewlery to fuse to your steering wheel. I want your dentist to have to identify your body. Get off my highways.  Breathlikebutt's condo wasn't haunted, to my disappointment. All of my info on the situation came to me via "telephone game" style communications, therefore all paranormal activities had been overblown. Nonetheless, I spent the weekend in Breathlikebutt's bed. Which was kind of horrific in its own right. Probably the strangest occurance all weekend was waking up with Breathlikebutt's hands groping my skull. Now, I was on his girlfriend's side of the bed and I could understand if I woke up with his arm draped across my waist, or maybe on my ass or something. But what is he doing to her head at night? Strange indeed.  Other than that, Baltimore was relatively uneventful. Highlights included watching a band called Slipdisk (the white, suburban beltway version of Prince and the New Power Generation) rock out in Ellicot City and playing a PS2 game called Red Dead Revolver. Don't buy this game unless you've got no ambition to do anything else.

      Learned to play tennis last night. I suck, but I'm going to buy a really old, cheap racket and some short-shorts and a white polo shirt, headband, wristbands, and just go all out. I've always wanted to be able to say "Tennis anyone?"  Watched TV at Karim's last night, checking out the DNC. And the Kerry girls are cute and classy. But I thought about those Bush girls,a couple of partiers. I'm into that. That's one for GW.  We switched back and forth from the convention to Xtreme Makeover. The "reveals" are so emotional, based on something totally superficial. You've got to figure that these people are going to get laid the night they come back, and when they have mediocre sex with their old spouse or whatever (that loved their ugly ass before this fucking spectacle came into their lives) what do they feel? Are you happier, now that you're more "attractive" to the world at large for the next 2-3 months? Because you're going to let yourself go and start looking like shit again soon. I've said it once, I'll say it again. These people are not the same species as me. Don't deny cultural elitism. Embrace it people. We are NOT them.  Chris Matthews=Asshole. And who the hell let Chris Farley introduce John Kerry? Morbidly obese Green Beret? Does that make any sense. Watching Kerry come out on live TV makes me a little nervous though. There is something about him, something about live TV that makes me think about assassination. Too many movies? Maybe it's his constant association with JFK. But it feels like waiting for something horrible to happen. Anybody else? But he did look great watching the people in the convention center, honestly overwhelmed and honored, not arrogant or entitled. It had to feel great, getting something you've wanted your whole life.   Edwards looked stunned the whole night. And why did Heinz keep standing up next to him and not his wife? It looked weird, the way they stood up together while Edwards' wife sat off to the side. And they kept looking at each other, meaningfully gazing into each others' eyes...

      Things I've been thinking about:  -The responsibility of the Press-I should have been a journalism major -The article I'm writing for the NJ Angler about striped bass -Why I can read the New Yorker and retain almost none of it -The Darknet: What is it? And how can I write about it in my tech column? (sounds cool doesn't it?) -Going to Boston -Killing Antelope in Wyoming in a few months -The sweet sustainable design piece I'm writing for October -People I know doing online dating, and why I should write something about it -I love Wired Magazine -Mom is coming to visit.  Humans are the only species not indifferent to the indifference of the universe. Where is Big Brother? Why do Marine Biologists need PR people? What if the Iraqis get free elections and they vote for Saddam?

      So I was listening to NPR just now and they had a professor from Columbia talking about how journalists need to start covering stories from the bottom-up. His statement was that today's journalism is formatted from the top-down, meaning that all of the news is focused on policy makers and celebrity, while the effects of these policies on normal people are never fully explored. So writers should be out finding stories about normal people. Which sounds great, and would be an amazing way to fuck the PR-newsfeeding system. But who would read it, listen to it, watch it? There could be an appeal for "Reality Journalism" but you'd have to market it. I think people care to much about celebrity to have it work. Thoughts?  Also, GQ ran this weird article about Bush's missing year of service in the armed forces. It's a joke article, with very damaging/doctored pictures, bogus quotes, etc. But it never says that the article is fake. In fact, for the first two days I had the issue, I was looking in the news for the shit to hit the fan. I'm not saying I'm a genius, but I think the average reader on a cursory glance would take it for a real story. And I think that's pretty damn irresponsible. Here I am, bashing GQ and defending GW. What the hell is going on? I'm going to write my first letter to an editor.

      So bloggers are covering the DNC this year. I think I can cover it from the couch just as well. Let's start with the dancing. Nothing about watching a lot of dorky white people being forced to dance makes me want to vote. They ought to cut that out. I know the directors want it to seem exciting, like the delegates are having a really good time, young people hooking up with each other, old folks just cutting loose, but its lame. Real lame.  The headlines are quoting Carter's speech, all of the negative things (sensationalist pricks). But they missed the best line of the speech, the nuance and positive message. It went something like, "Whether you're for us or against us, don't underestimate America." Which means, we won't always be as stupid as we are now, and this can't last long. The man wrote a novel recently and won the Nobel Peace prize. Can somebody remind me about why he was considered such a bad president? This isn't a rhetorical question. I don't really know anything about it.   Hillary scares the hell out of me. When I listened to her on NPR again this morning, I  thought to myself "she's not so bad." But watching her is scary. She'd better not run for pres. I don't want to have to vote for Arnold in 2012. Is she a robot? Anybody? Jesse Jackson is a robot too.  Bill is a rockstar. He is so damn articulate, self-depreciating but confident. "The world is interdependent. You can't kill or occupy all of your potential adversaries."  What do you think GW will be like as an elder statesman? You know if Bush slept with an intern, he'd have her entire family erased.  Patti LaBelle sang at the end. She's a brick house. I think I'm in love. Is she single? Into short, white, younger guys? The voice, the blue eye shadow, the dress. Damn. Democrats rock.  Lastly, the benediction. Sucked. Everybody that was still there looked like they wanted to die. But I know why they had to do it, because we live in a Christian fundamentalist theocracy and we're on the edge of a new "Dark Age".

      BUCK AS FUCK! It was the best of times... the worst of times... etc. So the boys are gone and I'm going to be sad. Almost cried. Can't wait to get DWs special care package, sketch books stuff and mixed cds, fliers from home, short stories. I wish I would have gone to see Dillinger Escape Plan with them, but I didn't  have the money to spend and more people were coming to visit. My brother's friend (my pal by association) is here looking for a place to live in the NYC area. Hopefully he's enjoying himself. I only see him at night. Trying to tie up some loose ends, clean my place, write the fishing story that's due in a few days to NJ Angler, and catch up on my New Yorker issues. Mom will be here Friday, look out.

      Please come to Boston for the springtime... I'm headed out folks. For the duration of the week I will be blogging from Beantown. That is, if the Jeepster is willing. Bosslady just told me that she and Brother Whip plan to skewer me all weekend while I'm gone. Little do they know, I will be monitoring their activity from a bunker in the great New England region. I could say a lot of things about yesterday, but I don't have the mental capacity. I'm too hungover to breathe, let alone think.

      So today is an all-time low for my conduct at the office. I'm here an hour late. Erik can smell the booze on me from yesterday. I'm in the same shirt, which now has fish stuff all over it. There is no excuse and I'm sorry for everyone. If I didn't have a phone interview about hydrogen fuel cells at noon, I'd be hurrying home to clean up. But I'm making the best of it.   I ran into Catharina last night. That was fun.

Duke University is giving away iPods to all incoming freshmen this year. These facts courtesy of the sickly Meerkat, Erik. There's disco blaring in my office. That's really all I need to say. I linked bosslady's photoblog. Hook it up and leave comments. As for the logo, Professor Whip has provided something wonderous. Also, Frank 'da Tank is hard at work on a second prototype. I'll need a few, so if you're hard at work, don't stop. Send something in. Doodles, fonts, whatever. I'll post stuff when I know how to put them up.

      The Internet is a strange place. I've been Googling random things, looking to make sure some of the articles that have been submitted to us haven't been used elsewhere, looking for new technology to cover, checking our site's ranking in the Google (We're 1st page, 4rd entry when you type "Manipulated Media"), randomly Googling the words "my balls" or "Kikkoman" stuff like that. So far I've found: paranoid anti-semitic sites claiming to have information on the Zionist takeover of America; conspiracy theory promoters discussing Neo-Nazi/Masonic deathcult propaganda at the Denver Airport (good looking out Bosslady!); and the grand watchful eye of Echelon, a worldwide network that is spying on your e-mail. I haven't linked all of this shit, since I don't want to get onto any more watch lists than I'm already on. But please submit all weirdness. The truth is out there. And so is Kikkoman. Check the link. FIGHT!!!

      Ok, some quick suggestions and observations (Can't spend my life on this thing)... Go see Avenue Q. You'll love it. If you like Turkish food and you're in the city, try Sip Sak, but don't order the Lamb & Okra. Get a salad or something grilled. What was I thinking? Okra? Gap clothes fit better than Banana Rep and Express this fall, for all you metros out there. Esquire magazine is amazing. Chuck Klosterman's in it this month, Akron boy done good. August 2nd New Yorker is worth checking out, discussions of important issues (offshoring, Islamist terror evolution, and an exploration of altruism). New terror alert a little unnerving. Islamist extremists want Bush to win election. His idiocy and aggression stir moderate people into action. Ok. No more rant.

      SO let's try to recap. Drove out Thursday night to Beantown. Not a bad drive, aside from horrible traffic on the Cross Bronx Expressway. The family Jeepster hung tough. Found KPs place without incident. The next day I saw Little Italy, Boston Common, Harvard Square, etc. Lots of statues. We walked the Liberty Trail. Regrettably, all of the cool old buildings are hidden by big nondescript buildings, so you have to be up on them to see them. Boston has more used book stores than any city I've ever been to. Luckily, I'd recently won $100 worth of free books from Powells, so I didn't spend any money. Saturday we walked around down through Chinatown, saw the Fungwah Bus services, and then made our way to the Barking Crab for chowda. That night, Modest Mouse played at a bar across from Fenway called Avalon. Awesome show. They mostly played stuff from the new album. They kept things really subdued too, which was probably good since there were so many meatballs in the audience. They sold the place out, KP got us tickets on Craigslist. The city closes up early though. Modest Mouse was done by 10pm. The bars are mostly done at 1am. The next day we drove to Cape Anne and the city of Gloucester (pronounced GLOUSTER; supposedly locals make fun of you if you pronounce the middle syllable). The place is famous from the movie Perfect Storm, and it's supposed to be one of the last working fishing villages on the East Coast. We walked around the artist colony on Throck's Neck and had early dinner (5pm was like a AARP convention). I've got a ton of pictures that I'll link today. Look for it at the bottom right.

      Does anybody have any idea what in the hell AM 820 (WNYC NEW YORK) is playing at 11pm on a Sunday night? Weirdness. I heard stream of consciousness fiction being read over a violin soundtrack. But you almost couldn't hear the words, because the violins were so loud. And then, after maybe 20 mins, the story ended and all out insanity ensued. "Love, love love..." some strange woman making an inane statement about love, about receiving... whatever. And then it was ten people talking at once, and then someone screaming in Spanish and then morphing to English. Somebody with more research skills (i.e. time) than me should look into this. A lot happened in Boston and I'll talk about it tomorrow when I have a fresh brain.
