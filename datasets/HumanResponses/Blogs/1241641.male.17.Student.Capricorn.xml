      So I was driving on the Federal Interstate Highway System during the air show last weekend when a thought struck my mind.  How do non-local motorists react to a giant B-17 flying no more than 300 yards overhead?  Or when they see seven planes flying in formation overhead?  Or even when they see planes dropping explosives in a nearby field?  Now I'm sure your average motorists will employ deductive reasoning and come to the conclusion that there must be some sort of aviation show going on at a nearby airport.  But what about the not-so-intelligent members of a distant community who are passing through on Interstate-80?  In late September 2001, the northern lights could be seen as far south as Texas.  Some people thought it was some sort of terrorist attack.  What about those people?  What would they think if they saw a plane dropping bombs right by an airport?

      As you may recall from my post entitled "So can we rule out Bush, Cheney, Ashcroft, and Rumsfeld as the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse..." I wrote about my concerns with Bush starting a war and citing God.  It turns out I'm not the only one.  Ron Reagan also had this to say on Larry King Live:  "Well, you know, there was that answer he gave to the question about, did you talk to your father about going into Iraq? No, I talked to a higher father, you know, the almighty. When you hear somebody justifying a war by citing the almighty, God, I get a little worried, frankly. The other guys do that a lot. Osama bin Laden's always talking about Allah, what Allah wants, that he's on his side. I think that's uncomfortable."  But he didn't stop his criticisms there...  KING: Do you have thoughts on the war? REAGAN: Sure, I have thoughts on the war. KING: And what do you think? REAGAN: And I think we lied our way into the war. KING: You think it's a mistake? REAGAN: Absolutely, a terrible mistake. Terrible foreign policy error. We didn't have to do it. It was optional. And we were lied to. The American public was lied to about WMD, the connection between Osama bin Laden and Saddam, which is virtually nonexistent except for fleeting contacts. But they're still trying to pull that one off now, Cheney and all are out there flogging that. KING: Can I gather from that, that you will not support this president? REAGAN: No, I won't. KING: Will you support his opponent? REAGAN: I will vote for whoever the viable candidate is who can defeat George W. Bush, yes.   urlLink Read the full transcript here.

      Recently, a group called Citizens United aired a TV spot on CBS (who claims to not run adverse ads).  The ad put heat on president Clinton for not fighting terrorists, even after the first bombing of the World Trade Center and the attack on the USS Cole.  Thirty-eight days after Clinton took office the World Trade Center was attacked (and did anyone blame Bush?).  President Clinton captured, tried, convicted, and imprisoned those responsible.  So thankfully, we did not see any attacks on the Pope, twelve jetliners in the U.S., UN headquarters, the FBI building, the Israeli embassy in the U.S., the U.S. embassy in Albania, the LA airport, the Boston airport, the Lincoln tunnel, the Holland tunnel, and the George Washington Bridge.  Clinton tripled the FBI budget for counterterrorism and doubled funding for fighting terrorism overall.  He created a top-level national security post to coordinate all federal counterterrorism activity.  Clinton struck targets in Sudan and Afghanistan in retaliation for attacks against U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.  Newt Gingrich said the president "did exactly the right thing."  Clinton also launched a presidential directive authorizing the assassination of Osama bin Laden.  After the attacks on the USS Cole, president Clinton directed Richard Clarke, the first national antiterrorism coordinator, to create a plan to take out Al Qaeda.  The plan would break up Al Qaeda cells and arrest those involved, attack the financial support for the group, and would increase actions in Afghanistan to destroy terrorist training camps and capture or kill Osama bin Laden.  The plan was finished right before Bush took office.  So instead of handing Bush a war, they decided to let him implement the plan himself.  But he didn't.  So that is where Clinton stands.  The plan sat around in the Bush administration until finally, eleven months after Clinton told Clarke to create it, Bush was advised to phase it in.  This was in early September, 2001.  And speaking of Clinton, it appears that it isn't just the democrats that have no values.  Yes, our culture of moral decadence has spread on to family value conservatives such as Illinois republican Jack Ryan, currently seeking a seat in the U.S. Senate.  For those of you not covering the news, his ex-wife, actress Jeri Ryan, claimed he pressured her to have sex with him at swingers clubs in front of other people.  To Ryan's credit, at least it was his lawfully wedded wife.  Kudos!

      Well friends, it has been a rather uneventful summer so far.  I apologize for the lack of posts.  I did add a site tracker to The Schism and was surprised when I noticed that the most popular time to visit this site is between 12am-2am CST.  Roughly one third of my hits are in that time bracket.  So either my site helps people sleep, or reading about my antics and tomfoolery always makes it to the bottom of your to-do list.  Either way, thanks for visiting.  Clinton!  Clinton!  Clinton!  Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah!  Well, former president Bill Clinton has released his memoirs.  Perhaps someday I'll get around to reading it, but with all the media hype surrounding it I think I already have.  Of course this media blitz is angering conservatives who seem to hate the budget balancing, welfare reforming forty-second president of the United States.  Sean Hannity, of Fox's Hannity and Colmes, recently expressed his desire for Clinton to just go away.  He talked about how he was sick and tired of the media frenzy surrounding the book.  Despite this, the Clinton memoir was the top story of his show and received much attention.  My advice to Mr. Hannity is if he wants the Clinton hype to be over with, don't join in.  Love him or hate him, do not fret, because he will eventually go away.  Much like Bush soon will.  But then he will release him memoirs and the story will top the Hannity and Colmes show.  Then maybe Alan Colmes will be upset.  Emphasis on maybe.  The Nick Colwell and John Kerry Similarity of the Day: We both played bass guitar in a high school rock band.  Today I'll leave you with the text from a sign seen over a U.S. freeway: "Ignoring the U.N. to invade Iraq for ignoring the U.N.  Pathetic."

      Last night at the Quad City Brew & View, Skeleton Key took to the area beneath the screen and lifted the bar for the Quad Cities.  At first glance, the band appeared as though they had just clocked in at the plant.  They grabbed their tools and went to work creating a unique sound that combines the working class with an elequent touch.  The impromptu set list, for lack of better words, was wicked hardcore.  In plain english, the show rocked.  Not to mention these guys are some of the nicest rockers you'll ever meet.  I got my picture taken with them and spoke with all of them after the show.  I even exchanged sweat with some of them.  A Perfect Circle, Tool, They Might Be Giants, those were all great shows.  But there is something awesome about a small venue with all your friends (or at least all your friends who bothered to show up).

      Amidst all the speculation and guessing games, I feel it is my responsibility to publicly set some rumors straight.  Although I would gladly accept the vice presidential bid from Democratic Senator John Kerry, I am forced to decline such an invitation.  Laws previously established by our government legally and constitutionally prohibit me from being sworn in as vice president of The United States of America.  Perhaps in 2024, but not 2004.  And as long as we are setting rumors straight, I do NOT have a tattoo of the Iranian flag on my left buttock.  It is of the French flag.  USA!  USA!  USA!  And now, to honor Ronald Reagan, a riddle:  Quick!  Name the five U.S. Presidents not buried in the United States!   urlLink Answer   Let's cure Alzheimer's.  More stem cell research!

      I think we can agree that all war is a great defeat for humanity.  I don't think anyone really "likes war."  I believe that in the eyes of God there is no good war.  Granted, sometimes we are put in a situation where we are forced to fight in a war (and sometimes we are in a situation where we do not have to), but I believe that, as brothers and sisters in Christ, the only war we are called to fight together is the war on war itself.  Pope Paul VI:  "No more war! Never again war! If you wish to be brothers, drop your weapons."  "No more war, war never again!  Peace, it is  peace which must guide the destinies of people and of all mankind."

      Well friends, it seems the end of days may be sooner than we think.  If I were you I would call upon the Lord right about now.  But wait, it seems the God of Abraham has been playing a few tricks on us people of faith lately.  As you may recall from your notes, Al Qaeda wants to kill us in the name of God.  It seems like we are in bad shape if the terrorists have The Big Guy on their side.  But hold on!  President Bush says God is with him!  Now we have a conundrum.  Does God just like messing with us and having hideous atrocities carried out in the name of God?  Does the "do not kill rule" only apply if the crime is not carried out in God's name?  You would think that loop-hole would be included on the tablet.  "Thou shall not kill in any name other than Mine"  So who will be victorious?  God or God?  Which one is acceptable:  Death to America in the name of God, or Death to Al Qaeda in the name of God?  Perhaps one side is misinterpreting something, then again, maybe both are.  Why is the "thou shall not kill" commandment so flaky?  Jesus gave it to us again in "love thy neighbor," but neighbor must not apply to everyone.  Why is the Almighty Deity's code so hard to crack?  In the end, who will be tossed in the Lake of Fire?  Now that Good and Evil have some gray areas, how do we know how to behave?  When will God step in and shout, "For the love of Me, you people are nuts!"  Now don't get me wrong, I support defense.  I don't want terrorists killing me and my friends for being a citizen of the United States.  Go troops!  But, I don't like how this has become God vs. God.  Can't we leave it at I'm Going to Kill You vs. Please Don't Kill Me?  Thank you, and may God bless America.

      Hello friends!  I decided to continue using Blogger for my journal.  One new neato thing is the ability for you, the viewer, to post your very own comment to my posts.  You do not have to register or anything, you can post without logging in by clicking on the post anonymously link.  However, I suppose if you do register and start a blog you can have people commenting on your posts!  How delightful would that be?  Please support the crappy online teen blog community or it might not survive!

      Hello friends!  I thought it was about time I debuted my new journal today, seeing at it has been a few weeks since the new launch.  I hope you all enjoy the new look of The Schism and the new Adventures in Dissent journal.  A lot has happened since The Schism was first launched in November 2003.  Perhaps you remember my first post about the Panera sandwich line, and how I loathed it so.  They figured out that I could not make a sandwich to save my life so they put me back out in the dining room where I thrived at making coffee, filling condiment and ice stations, and cleaning tables.  Once a new crop of Panera associates, or Panerites, came in they decided to get me trained in the bakery.  So there I was, slightly more competent, when suddenly, things took a turn.  Yes, I was back on the line for a night.  Luckily, I was in good company.  It was the Flathenator and I rocking the Bravos and the Black Beans.  And, to my luck, an overly observant manager witnessed my newfound sandwich construction abilities.  Suddenly I was a sandwich artist, so to speak.  So now you are expecting me to whine about it?  I'll have you know things are so much better this time around.  But so help me God, they better get me trained elsewhere.  My good friend and partner in crime, Colin, and I are embarking on a new musical journey this summer.  For this project we will be in broadcasting.  After some wheeling and dealings with the people who pull the strings at KALA, we were able to get a weekly radio shift for the summer.  You all can tune in around the Quad City area at 88.5MHz on Mondays from 2pm-5pm.  Well that's it for me.  Cross your fingers that this summer I find some stuff to write about in my journal.  Adios.

      Once again this is Nick Colwell reporting from Eagan, MN, right outside of the twin cities.  Before I get to my amusing anecdotes I'd like to extend a hearty welcome to Nomar Garciaparra.  Welcome to Wrigley, Chief!  Alright, so today I stared death in the eye...and it walked away.  I was at the Minnesota Zoo looking for an adventure to write about, and a beast to wrestle.  I decided I could kill two birds with one stone and find myself a tiger.  After many attempts to enter the enclosure, I had to settle on an eye-to-eye encounter, literally.  We had half of an inch between us.  Granted, that was the glass, but still, I scared him away.  Nick, 1.  Tiger, 0.  Now onto my attempts to pick-up a pop star...  She was a lost soul looking for love in a lonely city.  I was a young stallion looking to treat a lady right, and a way to boost my own pop career.  I figured if anyone knew anything about playing off other peoples' success, it was her, Ashlee Simpson.  It was a match made in heaven my friends.  But today, the gods were not on my side.  Lost in the hustle at the Mall of America, she could not throw herself into the arms of her calling white knight.  We missed our first opportunity, but destiny has a funny way of finding its doves.  If music be the food of love, sing on Ashlee!

      Now that was a convention my friends.  Quite exciting to say the least.  I hope you all tuned in to get informed on where the Dems stand on the issues and such.  That's what any intelligent voter would do, right?  One thing that is always fun at convention time is the 'ol campaign tunes.  Kerry's aren't too exciting, but then again who can possibly top Clinton's Fleetwood Mac.  But this got me thinking about why my tune would be.  I don't think Maynard screaming for the end of the world would be a good choice.  Well I am actually typing this from a hotel room in St. Paul.  It's about, or as the locals say "aboot," time for me to head out.  So enjoy your weekend friends!  73's de KC0SVT

      Well kids it appears I have been misled.  We didn't exactly broadcast from the Bix Street Fest.  We manned the booth.  Oh well, gotta represent.  Speaking of radio transmissions, today I became a technician class amateur radio operator.  Yeah, you may laugh now, but we'll see who is laughing when I am dispatching ambulance services during the early stages of the apocalypse.  Everyone I know is going to get brain cancer from the cell phones, so I, feeling left out, thought I need to do some catching up in the brain damage department.  I'll still have an edge though, because I don't drink.  So the record still stands, I get hurt more at Panera than at a non-sissy job (maintenance at SAU).  So does this make Panera a non-sissy job?  Yes.  Yes it does.  Does it make SAU maintenance a sissy job?  Not on your life my Hindu friend (ah, The Simpsons).  What is with the letter X and technology?  My example today will be operating system names.  Both Windows and Macintosh have the letter X in their current OS name.  For those of you who are not Roman, Apple's use of the X represents the number ten.  I'm not sure about Microsoft's use of the X in XP.  But either way they both have it.  And so do a lot of computer related devices.  If this X reminds us of something that is cutting edge and futuristic, then what will represent the next generation of toys?  Y?  Z?  Some sort of new, cutting edge, futuristic letter?  Maybe once the aliens take over we will have a new alphabet to work with.  But then again we will just be their pawns building a ray gun to destroy some distant planet we have not even heard of.  Which brings me back to:  Everything can be related to a Simpsons moment.  Don't blame me, I voted for Kodos.  Speaking of voting and elections and such...  Here is today's RNC Campaign Tactic of the Day:  Request Catholic parish directories to contact those "who are likely to be supportive of President Bush's compassionate conservative agenda" (Martin J. Gillespie, director of Catholic Outreach at the RNC).  This post brought to you by Awesome Transitions.

      Hello again friends.  Sorry it has been a while since I rapped at ya'll; I've been terribly busy this week.  Not only am I working at Panera but I am also helping miscellaneous St. Ambrose offices move into the new university center.  Not only am I helping miscellaneous St. Ambrose offices move into the new university center but I am also studying for my amateur radio operator's license.  But I found some time to give you the scoop, Betty Boop.  I'd like to announce to my friends in radio land that Colin and I will be broadcasting live from Bix Fest 2004 on Saturday, July 24, from 5pm-8pm.  Come on down and see us!  I think we'll be giving away some KALA trinkets and such if you need a bribe.  By the way, my nose cut is just a bruise now.  There is really nothing to say...

      So I'm at work yesterday and the manager sends me into the freezer to bring out some soup.  Our soup is put in plastic bags and frozen into a brick shape.  These bricks are stacked five high in cardboard boxes and put in the walk-in freezer.  So there I am, sealed in a zero degree fahrenheit vault looking for soup.  Of course the soup I need is on the top shelf.  I grab the cardboard box and start pulling it off the shelf; then everything goes white.  As it turns out, there was a soup brick on top of the cardboard box.  Smashed my nose; smashed my nose right open.  I spent the next seven hours at work with a headache, stomachache, and a giant bandage on my nose.  Luckily it didn't rip my cheek open, otherwise I'd have to pull a Nelly.  Anyone who knows me knows I would rather bleed.  *Nelly is a rapper that always has a bandage on his cheek.  Some say it is a shout-out or statement or something, but I still think he cuts himself shaving...everyday...in the same spot.*  Other than that I have nothing to tell or sell you at the moment.

      Well, I think I am going to keep politics to a minimum here at Adventures in Dissent.  This post is going to be similar to the good old days when my posts were about me and my keen observations.  Hopefully the site won't lose popularity now (we came in at about 100 visitors last week alone).  So the old man just went on a good old fashioned buying rampage and brought home a new printer.  The Canon i9900 with 4800 x 2400 dpi, borderless printing, and eight, count 'em eight ink tanks.  It shakes the table when it prints.  I remember our first color printer shook when it printed too, but it had a ribbon instead of ink cartridges.  Oh, technology!  I bow to your splendor!  Onward...  I hope you are all gearing up for the Summer Olympics.  Here is my thing with the Olympics, I only like the sports with real winners.  Sports where any old Joe can say, "He won."  None of this gymnastics crap with "points."  Don't get me wrong, I have lots of respect for gymnasts and they really are athletes.  However, I like a sport where the "judge" holds a stopwatch, ruler, or makes sure the guy's foot didn't touch the bar.  Remember that scandal with the Canadian judge at the Winter Olympics?  Where she gave some really bad figure skaters high marks?  That garbage would never happen if I had my way.  Olympic sports should be objective.  You know what else should be objective?  Journalism.  Today's news sources seem to be blurring the line between journalism and commentary.  I think we can all agree on that.  Some more than others, but at some point we all have to ask ourselves, "Am I watching news, or opinion?"  And that question needs to be asked objectively as well.  When it comes time for you to vote, whether it be this election or one in the future, please, please, please, get informed.

      Well kids, I think I have established myself in this blog as a young man with an interest in politics and a progressive mind.  I think this means I practically have to mention John Kerry's choice of running mate.  Once Kerry clinched the nomination with Edwards coming up in second, I played with the idea of a Kerry-Edwards ticket; I liked it.  Edwards' energy, charisma, and message all compliment Sen. Kerry very well.  His "two Americas" message (one for the people doing very well, the other for those struggling to make ends meet) bites hard at the agenda of the Bush-Cheney administration.  This dynamic duo will surely give the Bush-Cheney campaign a run for their money and their jobs.  Of course the Bush-Cheney campaign has launched a counterattack.  The call Sen. John McCain Kerry's "first choice" and then play some slightly out of context audio clips of McCain talking about Bush (his mounds of criticisms of the war in Iraq are edited out).  And let's remember no one offered McCain a seat on the ticket.  I have talked plenty about Bush and Kerry, but what about Nader?  Now he is accusing the Democratic party of dirty tricks in Arizona.  The Democrats challenged the validity of hundreds of signatures to get Nader on the ticket.  Invalid signatures sounds more like a dirty trick than making sure election laws are followed.  And to make matters worse, the company that is making the electronic ballot machines (which create no physical record of every single vote in the event of a recount) have promised a Bush victory.  If that does not scare anyone, I don't know what would.  Insist on a paper ballot. Insist on UN election inspections.

      Well kids, the United States of America is one year older.  I did not celebrate her birthday with John Kerry in Cedar Rapids; I went to a wholesome gathering of friends and blew up some Chinese made fireworks like all other good patriots.  As much as I am tempted, I will not bring politics into this post.  But let it be said that I don't hate America, I love America.  I think we can all agree that fireworks are damn cool.  What isn't cool is when you are dog sitting the most timid dog in the world on Fourth of July weekend.  People are lighting off noisy explosives at 2PM, 2AM, and every time in between.  This dog has not relieved itself in days.  I will set her down in the middle of my yard where she will stand for a moment at high alert.  At the first sound of a firecracker she bolts to the backdoor.  So I try keeping her in the yard via leash.  Still nothing.  I challenge the scientific community to develop doggie ear plugs effective against all booms!  I also challenge the scientific community to make better booms.  Bigger, louder, brighter booms!  Nuclear booms!  Booms that could destroy orbiting satellites!  So back to this dog.  She is small and does not require much exercise.  Regardless of this, I still decided to take her on a walk.  I came to the conclusion that she has not been on many walks before.  She couldn't quite grasp the concept of a sidewalk or straight path, or even follow my lead!  She insisted on turning onto any path to the right.  She turned right (direction) into driveways, steps, and roads, all while I indicated no sign of turning.  Now sure, my pooches are walk veterans, but this really was ridiculous.  A few times she decided to run into oncoming traffic.  Now Otto will chase after cars, but he believes he could win the fight.  I don't think this little, firecracker fearing lap dog thinks she can beat a car in a battle.  Then again, who knows?  Dogs are crazy.  They'll bite your head if you're wearing steak on it.

      Well comrades, yesterday both candidates for the 2004 presidential election rolled through this one horse town.  Both candidates showed strong support for bank robbery and suspicious diaper bags.  Politics aside, this was the most exciting thing to happen to Davenport since Mayor Yerington appeared on the Today Show with exposed chest hair.  The Bush Policy/Statement/Comment/Remark I Agree With of the Week: Davenport needs to fix the pothole problem.  Now it is time to address a concern that many of my devout readers may have.  In some recent posts I have used some mysterious code talk.  For example I recently said, "73's de KCØSVT."  I'm sure this confused an average reader.  But an above average reader would know that I am just using some amateur radio lingo.  You see folks, I just received my amateur radio technician class operator's license.  In short, that means I can use a really long range walkie talkie.  Us "hams" have all sorts of fun codes that makes yammering on a little easier (especially in CW, or Morse Code), and more nerdish.  "73's" means "best regards."  "De" means "this is."  And finally, KCØSVT is my call sign.  You ever wonder why the van I drive has a funny license plate?  N9CI is my old man's call sign.  Now, KCØSVT is no good so in a few weeks I will probably be WØNJC (NJC being my initials of course).  So just try and ignore the hand growing out of my skull, that's just a little effect of some RF radiation.
