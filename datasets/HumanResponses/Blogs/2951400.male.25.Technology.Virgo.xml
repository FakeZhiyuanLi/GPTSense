      There I was pouring my feelings out up to her on her porch. She had heard most of it before, I cared for her and she told me she had feelings for me but I wasn't sure what those were as she didn't explain much only hinting at the surface of something, leaving me to wonder how deep those feelings were if existent at all. This time I told her that before when she spoke of these feelings that I got hurt waiting for her to act on those feelings. Also I had written her a e-mail explaining if she was going to talk of these feelings she needed to make a decision and let me know if she wanted to be just friends or take things a step farther.   As the words left my lips I looked up and could barely see her face, it was a moonless night and I wish I could see if there was a change of expression as I felt like I was talking to myself. I shifted my leather jacket from one arm to the other, a sign of my uneasyness I felt very alone at that moment and very exposed. I finished hurried as I knew my words were not being heard as I would have liked, I could feel no effect they dropped to the ground lifeless, dead and worthless. The last word hung in the air and my heart sunk I felt small, very small and wanted to hide as much as I wanted to get my words and feelings out I knew that there was a chance that she would not be able to share them and would tell me so yet again. She looked at me for a moment I could feel her eyes looking at me maybe looking through me. As she spoke it was very few words and it was quick cutting deeply and I would spend the rest of the night hearing them over and over in my head. Even now they ring as a reminder of something that I wished for and was denied.  "I don't know what to say..." ; Was all she said.  With that she turned and went into her house and closed the door. With nothing to say maybe in her mind there was no reason to continue to look at me. For the longest time I felt rejection but with this girl and my past experiences I should be used to it by now. By my own accord I keep giving myself to someone that will not accept it, it would feel different if she were taking but not giving back and I had felt that in the past, used. Tonight that changed and I felt like my offering of myself to her was left on her doorstep and as I walked away that night, like dust, it was taken by the wind and giving to the heavens where all the other feelings and good intentions go that someone did not accept. They say that a "nice guy" will be walked over and used and will one day become jaded, I never want to be that guy, I know in my heart someone will take me for me and treat me as the treasure they have been looking for their whole life.

      She wrinkled her nose as she had smelled something odd in the air... something forgotten. A chirp and she was into her car, a passer by heard a sigh but was not sure if was the seat or the woman. He noticed she was very pretty, something out of a childhood dream, she was magical he murmured to him self; he swore he had just seen a fairy driving a Jetta. He shook his head;  "No fairies before 8pm... I'm on my way to the bar now..."  He checked his watch again;  "Jesus it's only 4:20pm...."   With that she took another left and was gone from his view. The stress of the day had built up in her shoulders and neck but nothing a hot bath and a glass of wine couldn't cure. She glanced at her cell phone before deciding that it would be better to just go to his house and get it over with. Less than 24 hours ago the familiar beep of a message woke her from a nice dream. It was unusual for him to be texting her so late, she swore and reached for the sound above her head. Quieting the low beep and squinting to see the name it was apparent that she was correct and her boyfriend had been a busy boy, this was going to be a bit of a read. The surprise was the lack of any attention from him of late. She had called him a few days ago only to leave a voice mail and receive a text that he was sorry and was busy that he would call her this weekend for sure. Busy was never a concept she had ever put into he same sentence with him. He was something of a home body, enjoying the "Blockbuster night" almost every night it was one of the things that made her wonder if they were to be together for much longer. Her heart had always lived in the moment, frequent trips to Santa Cruz alone and her love of music drew her out into the night where she loved to dance and act as if she had no care in the world. She only wished her should share that with him, as he had to be coxed and often dragged out of the house. She smiled and held in a giggle at the thought.   "That bastard broke up with me on a text message and for his ex no less."   When he drank he always seemed down and she suspected he was missing her. The message had come of no surprise and she was happy he had down the breaking up as she didn't want to have to make such an effort to pin him down for the 5 minutes she would have needed. The last thing was to pick up her belongings from his house. Just a few CDs, her PJs and the extra toothbrush she left at his house the pink one she used for whenever she was away from home. This should be quick and painless, she doubted he and his ex would be able to find happiness but that was of no business of hers and she was happy to keep her thoughts to herself. No, she was far from bitter, if not she was quite proud of herself on how well she had been doing these last few months. Living independently was something she had to get used to as her pervious relationship had been lavish as she was always taken care of, never to lift a finger as he had given her anything she wished for. This one she had babied and felt as she was taking care of him and that was something she decided not to continue for much longer but the situation had taken care of it's self, now to the matter at hand.   The city had thinned out behind her leaving only an old dirt road that grumbled as she drove along. Some scattered houses left a feeling of farm land but nothing ever seemed to be growing. She always felt fields of corn were always so beautiful, or wheat a golden sea of heaven. Maybe the value of the land as farm land did not seem so high to the current owners of the lands around her, the sons of daughters of farmers past may want to save there backs. Past the large oak tree and a sharp left brought into her view of the newest looking house she had seen out here. She drove around to the back of the house as the driveway had been poured to allow parking in the rear. Throwing her things in the back seat she slipped off her work shoes and put on a pair of sneakers she kept as she was very fond of her Nine West heels. Out of the car now she glanced around at the fact that she seemed to be the only one home. His father and mother worked later than her and that explained there cars being gone but he asked her to come after work to pick up her stuff she only assumed that he would be here. As she did a full circle her eyes fell upon a black garbage bag on the back porch.  She knew he would never leave her things out in the open in a garbage bag but as she neared the door she saw there was a note attached. Her nose wrinkled again and she began to read;  Julie,   	Sorry I wasnt here to say goodbye but I think a clean split would be healthier for us both. I have everything here that reminded me of you. I didnt want to throw it out but I cant have reminders of you around as I will be starting my new life with Sandi. I wish you the best in all you do.   Thank you,  Jason  What the fuck?  That was the only thing that registered in her head. She was not that surprised anymore at his lack of backbone anymore. She opened the bag to find several cards and a candle she had given him only weeks before. She looked it over to find that it had been lit so it wasnt even presentable anymore. What in the world would she do with it? As ser was asking herself this she carried the bag over to the near by trash and started to take items out that had lost there sentimental value. As she pulled out each card she read them over and smiled. She loved cards and personalizing each one so that her feelings could be expressed perfectly. She always took great care in the gifts she picked out even the candle she bought was of his favorite scent. She knew he had it by his bed side and would light it as he got ready for bed, she wanted him to think of her and not forget that she wished she could be there with him but those feelings were gone now and she dropped the candle, cards and some dried flowers in the trash. Replacing the lid she clicked open her trunk and gently laid the bag in the cargo net so it would not roll and damage anything. She was hurt if any by his return of the things she gave him. Any gift she took the time to pick out and wrap and send to someone with a ribbon included a bit of her heart. She wanted someone to cherish that and be willing to accept her gifts as something scared. She also wanted the same in return. It wasnt what was given that mattered to her it was the love and time, pieces of there heart that were wrapped in such gifts. She saw the sun setting and did not want to be here when his parents arrived. Speeding down the driveway she heard a sound that made her happy, the crickets crawling out of there homes had come to play there songs for the creatures of the night. She was one of those creatures, there was someone for her out there and she would be ready when he came bearing his heart open and she would be willing to share hers as she knew that love would be wonderful.  Until then she would be herself, the only person she knew she could be. Her world was a fairy tale and she was no longer helpless within it, maybe in the days to come she would do some good on her own.

      As I blew smoke into the air I was intrupted by a gust of wind. Not that I could ever blow a smoke ring or some nifty trick... but I enjoied watching my grey cloud trail into nothingness. The sudden breeze wiped the air clean like a chalk board.  With no audence I think the effect of a internal sigh was the best I could muster. I was 21 now. Just lost my job, my girl, most of my friends, currently broke, had to give up my apartment. Living mostly on the couch I would pass out sometime during the 4th or 5th movie I would bring home. A watered down Sloe gin and coke my loyal friend watching over me as I slept. My father allowing me to move back home and regain whatever sense of self I could find. Scraping up pieces of who I used to be a daily chore each morning. I was as the very smoke that disappeared in the air, wiped clean, the medication and hospital stay clenzing me of all my sins, memories, values and hope. There job to wash the insanity from my soul and letting me start anew, reborn with in white walls I was now free to do as I pleased, even if I didn't know what that was.  I was glad that morning as I was the only one at the store. I gathered our selection of music videos and began my morning routine or checking in the evening drop offs, cleaning spilled drinks and other liquids that found there way into our box. I humed along to a woman's voiceI, liked this tune, it was up beat and today I could imagine I was a up beat guy.   I glanced up as the cute girl from the pizza shop down the street pulled up in her bug. I would trade her a one of our Wild Cherry Pepsi's for one of her grape sodas. She was under the impression that I enoyed the purple liquid, though I hadn't in the past I didn't think today would be any different but I did enjoy the time with her as we chatted about our lifes. She was still in high school I found out, boy friend, job, band and a taste for Wild Cherry flavored soda. With her drink finished it was time for her to start her shift she walked away and I droped my soda in the trash.

      I smiled as I thought of all the mornings she spent working and delivering bagels, "Blockbuster night" had become a time for her to nap and me to cuddle with her, not that I was complaining mind you. I had noticed her sleepy eyes when I first met her and wondered if she was working herself to death only to find her true passion was to have her very own creative haven and working a second job was worth the sleepless nights.   I pulled up to her building in the heart of Monterey, grabbing my jacket I flipped the button releasing the trunk with the familiar pop I headed to retrieve part of my surprise for the evening. I glanced at my wine choice for the night and wiped away some of the sweat that had beaded over the name "Sutter Home." This was a sweet wine, occasionally found at Safeway on sale for $3.50 a bottle it suited my budget and my tastes for a relaxing drink I could have anytime. I had left her completely alone for a week, she still worked both jobs and now I knew she was giving up the little sleep she was getting to begin some of the projects she was so excited to start. She hadn't called nor come over; I could only imagine she slept here or at her apartment a few blocks down the road. I understood she didn't have the time for me right now and I was glad that I was ok with that as it felt right to not try to take time away from her dreams. I lay awake some nights dreaming that I could feel the warmth of her body next to me. Within the first few days I think I inhaled all the smell from her pillow mixed with the scent of her hair and the light perfume that she wore, the scent that I swore made me pounce and seduce her before she had a chance to shower.   I checked the building index next to the main entrance, I noticed her attempt to cover the previous tenant's name with a piece of paper, scrawled with her favorite blood red ink, her name and the fact that it was a Art Studio. I had to smile at the Caligerfy styled writing, even in the smallest details she was art minded. Into the elevator and with a press of the button for the 3rd floor I was on my way. The building it's self seemed in good order, I noticed that the elevator was due for an inspection but I honestly had never seen a permit that was not expired. I shifted my weight as I was not a big fan of enclosed spaces or elevators that I was not used to and wondered if taking the steps might have been a better idea. To my relief the doors opened with a small chime I stepped into the hall and glanced down both hallways. It was after hours and the main lights had been turned off but secondary smaller lights within the fixtures gave off an orange glow that allow for movement. Seeing the number decreasing to the left I heading right and looked for 305. I could tell that the offices made a "C" shape not counting the space used by the elevator shaft. Coming around a bend I found my destination a heavy looking wooden door with a "Handicap Friendly" door knob that was found more in these buildings. I enjoyed opening these types of doors myself as I could rub my rear and push the handle down allowing for a arm full of equipment as I was used to in my field while entering a building.

      It was well into the afternoon by the time I wondered if I had spoken a single word today. I thought back to waking up, I was startled out of a dream by my cat pawing at my neck for food. It was 3am and I didn't care she was hungry and I gladly would get out of bed to take care of her as she was always there for me she had never left me least... not yet. I shook my head to clear my image and reached again. I never went back to bed my favorite past time that early in the morning was to look at all the inventions that were playing on the T.V. Knifes to cut food, that would be nice if I had food to cut, ladders that had a hundred and one uses, I would loved to by one just to play with it but the ceilings in my apt were a little less then 6 feet, but I still was amazing by how much great stuff there was. Who needed "Leave it to Beaver" reruns when you had Ronco himself showing you how to "set it, and forget it." As I lazily walked along my foot failed to rasie high enough a uneven crack in the pavment and I was jolted from my fanasty and back to my question. I remembered walking into work and as I pasted the breakroom someone had said good morning and I flung my hand back and waved but I did not say anything. All day I loaded the trucks, one would pull in hand me his papers which I would sign then point to a small stool where I took my lunches and loaded the nessary pallets into the dark holes these men drove around while they talked about this or that. Women they picked up or how many days they could go without sleep, then never showered always smelled of cheap weed and liqure.I neverminded much though it was like the news to me they as I could tell went out into a world and were wise to the road that and making hikers paying for there rides. Didn't matter much to them if they were Men, Women, girls or boys.. they all paid the same in the end. So what do you say to that? I personally smile and nod, like you know what they are taking about, you could make them think you understood and weren't judging them. Yes sir, I am a sick fuck just like you mister and with a pat on the back they were gone but no I can't say I talked to anyone today at work. I felt my mouth at that moment and found my lips didn't part to easy, they were dry and chapped, I could feel them crack apart and knew I tasted a hint of blood on my lips I knew then that if I had spoken today my lips sure didn't remember it they would hopefully forgive me as I would use the last of my vasoline on them tonight which ment that I would be chafing the little man downstairs raw. Good thing it was Friday because the last time this happened I wasn't able to walk for a couple days after wacking off dry. Yes sir... this was going to be a beautiful Forth of July.
