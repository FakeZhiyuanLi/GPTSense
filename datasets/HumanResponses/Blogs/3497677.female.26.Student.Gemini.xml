      Don't get me wrong, I'm not exactly 'pro-ana' or 'pro-ed'.  Although it's often hard to convince ppl of that.  Let me tell you about myself.  I am a 26 year old woman who has 2 kids, one adopted & one I gave birth to just over a year ago.  I am happily married to a man who gives me everything & supports me in ways even he doesn't understand.  From the outside, my life looks amazing.    Inside, I am always thinking about my weight.    At my highest, I was 290 lbs!  Hard to believe. Today I am 181.  Hoping to be in the 170's zone this week.  By Tues. I hope.    It was Christmas 2000 when I was at my highest.  And today May 30, 2004--  ppl tell me how amazingly beautiful I am.  Ppl tell me I look like a goddess.  All the while I am thinking, don't you see how fat I am?   I get complimetns & hit on everyday of my life.  It's a nice ego boost.  Keeps me going.  Cuz I remember a time when ppl looked the other way and pretended not to see me.    But today I will eat only 100-400 cal.  and I'd prefer to stay at that 100.   Which I have already eaten.  But I am a waitress, and it is often dificult to be around the food.  I will get through today.  While I eat very little, I do take a multi vitamins [I use a kids chewable].  I also take Calcium, chromium, b150 & biotin.  I also drink a lot of black coffe.  My hair is thick and luxurious, so I'm not just some annorexic who is whithering off to die.  I have been working hard for 3 + years now and have lost over a hundred pounds.  Most of which came off in large sections during my 'good days' cycles.  And had several "bad days' cycles where I might have gained back 20 before losing it again.  I did have a major set back when I found out I was pregnant in 2002, I weighed 220 then, & rose to 271 day of delivery.  I was 240 when I left the hospital.  So, in retrospect, I have lost 60 lbs in the last year. And still going well.    My problem has always been a food addiction.  Sugars & fats.  So I figure I must sign myself up to live more on supplements, & less on food.  Just like the heroine addict, I must give up my addiction to get better.  So I try to only eat the things I must to survive.  I am also bulimic, I guess.  Since I throw up my food often.  Whenever I am in a situation where I have to eat, or have a 'bad day' cycle, I vomit.  This is not recomended.  I fight to break this cycle, just as a smoker fights to not light up.  Don't start this as means of weight loss pls!  I often have swollen throat, ears, & pressure headaches from this behavior.  Don't do it.  Better to just not eat.  Well that's me.  That's a lot to start huh?  I don't know, this is new to me.  But I'm honest.    I am going to go explore a bit around this blog and see what I can do with it.  Hopefully I can meet a few cool ppl around here & we can support each other in lowering our body fat %   & make some friends.  Take care all, post again tomorrow.

      On the 10th of this month I had a hysterectomy.   Freaked out a week later in depression, so I decided to go ahead and live with horemone replacement therapy. One can't go around crying all the time...  But I'm doing well.  Still recovering, it hasn't even been 2 weeks yet, and I'm off work... and most every thing else for 6 weeks.    I am still 181.  Haven't gained.  Haven't seen so much as 179 yet.  But we can work on that soon I guess.  Against my dr.'s order I began some rehab excersizes already.  My body feels fine.   It feels like its helping, so I'll make my choices myself.  But the bandages are all off now so, I can get walking.  Couldn't exactly go gettin all sweaty in the bandages.  Even though they told me to get walking.  Ya know??  This is lower alabama, it's like 90-100 here every day right now.. geesh.  Anyway.  That's all for today.  I had a crappy day today.  I threw up once, really not a good idea so soon after surgery...  grr.  But tomorrow I promise myself will be better.
