      This particular blod is for any of my artistic endeavors, be they drawings, stories, or poems.  There's a good chance it won't be updated too horribly often.

      Oh my fucking god!  I'm insane!  We're insane!  AND IT IS SO MUCH FUN!  Okay.  So.  Last night, some friends sleep over.  It's all good.  Then we're talking to another friend of ours on MSN, and he tells us to go over to his place, at 1am.  So, we get ready to go, and leave, just after 1.  Get there at 2ish, since we walked.  Then we decide to go skinny dipping.  We hop the fence to the public pool, strip down to our underwear, and get in the water, it's all good.  Then the cops come.  We leap out of the pool, grab our stuff, and hop over two fences.  Amy gets stuck at the second fence, but of course, the rest of us morons keep going.  I follow Hilary barefoot down a long, gravel path, over some cement, then down another path and across the school field.  Then down yet anoher gravel path.  My feet hate me.  As I'm coming down the last path, I see Hilary crouching behind a truck.  Then the cops pull up.  She leaves her clothes and bolts up the hill, and I follow.  Straight into the blackberry bushes at the edge of the ravine.  There, we meet up with a mostly-naked Derek.  They crouch a little ways down the pathlet from me, and I attempt to put my jeans on before the cops come.  Of course, they snoop around for a while, so I have to crouch really quickly, with one leg in my pants.  We all stay crouching, and absolutely silent, for at least 15 minutes, then Derek takes off his boxers, about to get dressed, when we hear something.  We freeze, Derek standing naked over Hilary, and me crouching in the bushes with just my top and my thong on.  All of us are standing barefoot on blackberry vines.  Eventually, Derek gets his clothes on and says he's going up to see if the cops're gone.  If he doesn't come back, meet him at his house.  So I pull on my clothes and put on my shoes, and we wait.  A minute later, he comes down and tells us it's alright.  He gives Hilary a piggy back ride out of the bushes, since she didn't have shoes, and we go out.  She runs down to get her clothes, then comes back up, putting them on as she goes.  We go up the steps back to the pool, and there's Amy and the cops, just talking and laughing.  They let us off, just saying they wanted to tell us we weren't suppoesd to be in the pool after hours, and such.  Apparently, we were a hilarious sight, running away and leaping fences in our thongs, bras, and (in Derek's case) boxers.  They joke with us, asking how the water is and such, and we all laugh at how stupid we are.  At this point, I notice that my thigh is really starting to sting.  We walk back up to Derek's house and sneak in through his window, then I check out why my thigh was hurting.  I have a 6" long gash from a blackberry thorn going from my bikini line down my inner thigh.  It hurts like hell.  We play video games for a little while, then Derek calls a cab for us to get back to my place.  The cab driver is a moron.  Eventually, we get back, and sneak back in.  My mom's not sitting on my bed waiting for us.  It's amazing.  Then, of course, I call my friend Joel, at 4:30am, to tell him about it.  We talk to him for a while, then he goes to bed, and we talk a little while longer and fall asleep.  So yeah.  We're insane.  And my muscles're killing me.  And my cut's killing me.  But I'll live.  It was so much fun, and it's great 'cause we can laugh at ourselves, too, so it's hilarious.  Today wasn't too great... just hung out and stuff.  I'm going to stay with my aunt this weekend, no computer, but my friend's coming, so it's not gonna be too bad.  Whee!  And now, I must flee.

      Portugal vs. Greece.  Portuguese are way outplaying the Greeks... GO PORTUGAL!!  Aaaaand damn, the Greeks scored. *shakes fist*  Goddamn Greeks...  Soccer's the only game I pay attention to most of the time, and random Olympic sports.  But anyway, life is life.  Nothing's going on.  I still miss Gabe, but I should get to see him tomorrow.  Hopefully.  *shakes fist at schdules*  But in the meanwhile, I've gotta clean out this damn room.  It is MINE until it's clean!  Bwahahahaha! *falls over*  But anyway, I'd better get to work, this is a huge project. >.<

      Yay, I have sandwich!  Good sandwich!  Lettuce, three kinds of meat, cheese, mustard and mayo.  Yummy.  It's definitely been a while since I had a good sandwich.  Speaking of food, I had the best dinner the other day.  Went to Moxie's on Robson with some friends, had calamari and canelloni... so good.  Best damn canelloni I've had, and that's sayin' something, since I'm Italian.  Best calamari, too, but that's not too hard to do.  Don't get good calamari too often... *giggle*  Ooo, last night my friend Meg slept over, it was so much fun!  We talked to random people online and ate Timbits and made huge friggin' sandwiches in the middle of the night.  Also plotted horrible things... like putting makeup on Gabriel.  Too bad if he dun' like it, Meg'll do it and it'll look GOOD, damnit!  MY BOYFRIEND WILL BE MADE UP!!  Hmm... Gabriel... that's a pretty name, for a guy.  It kinda suits him, given he's really cute.  I have this thing for names... Gabriel, Amadeus, Vincent, Tristian, Angie, Collin, Joel, Ashley, Kelly, Calan... there's so many guy names I absolutely adore, can't list them all.  There's some nice girl names, too.  Meagan, Anastasia, Lara, Kristina, Amy, Carrie... *bounce*  I like some names for guys you'd usually think would be for girls... Angie, Ashley and Kelly, offhand.  There's a couple others, but I can't remember them right now.  Not so many the other way 'round, though.  I dunno, girls with guy names rather annoy me someimtes, it's just like, if you're gonna have a good guy name, be a goddamn guy!  Bah!  Bah I say!  But yeah, names aside, eyes... oh my god, eyes.  Gimme someone with beautiful eyes, and I melt.  Just friggin' melt.  You can tell so much about a person by their eyes, it's incredible.  Gabe's got beautiful eyes... I love the color, and everything... amazing lashes, too.  It's not fair, guys get the nicest lashes all the time, and 99% of them don't give a shit.  Mine're okay, at any rate, so oh well.  Arg.  Monday cannot come fast enough.  I wanna see Gabe! *throws pointy things at time as incentive to hurry the fuck up*  Hmm, the crows outside are leering at me... it's kinda scary.  They did it the other day, too... I was just sitting here, and suddenly, "*leer* CAW!"  Six friggin' crows sat on the railing and glared in at me.  Not so fun, sometimes.  But anyway, I should go attempt to clean my room.  It's a hopeless battle, though, since I'm just gonna get it messy again in two weeks anyway.  But oh well, this'll please mom, or something. *shrug*  So I'm off!

      Okay, so I've got a blog.  Again.  Good luck to me actually keeping the bugger!  Now, what should I say... I really don't know.  There's absolutely nothing going on today, I'm stuck at home, and it sucks.  Wanna at least drag my boyfriend over, but he's off somewhere.  Fuck.  I haven't seen him in a few days, I miss him.  I've just been hanging out with hot gay guys, which is fun.  Because they're hot. :p  But yeah... I'm tired and pissed off that no one's around who wants to do anything.  And I really want my boyfriend to stop being fucking OUT all the time... I miss him... *gripe*  'Sides, he has my yearbook still.  Gotta get that back.  Stupid Gabriel.  Oh well, I guess I'll live.  Should probably go have a shower now, but I can't be arsed.  Meh.  I just said I can't be arsed... *giggle*  Well, I'm off for a bit.
