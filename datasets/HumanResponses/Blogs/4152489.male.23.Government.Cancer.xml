      Dear friends, brothers and sisters, welcome to my website.   Finally, I have my so-call own website... In this website, you will be able to understand me better. A short brief introduction of me, just in case you dont know me. I am a simple, boy next door, type of guy. I am easy going, friendly and unpredictable... I was born in the 80s and I am 20 plus now (quite old). Currently I am still single, any takers?! Now I am serving the national service as a Combat Engineer. I was in Kebun Baru Primary School (1987-1993) then Braddell Secondary School (1994-1999) then I studied E-Commerce at ITE West Clementi (2000-2002)... And my story goes...   Today 6th August 2004("_)'  Finally my days are over, oh I mean my work is over. Now I am sitting in the office typing out my thoughts of the day. Yes, the 39th National Day is coming closer and closer, how should I celebrate this year? Going for a National Day dinner? Gathering? Or all alone sitting somewhere along Singapore river to view the beautiful fireworks display? I have never been to a "live" National Day parade since the day I was born. I have always wanted to enjoy this very special day will all others (regardless of race, language or religen), but it seems I dont have the chance to do so, even this year although my elder brother have the preview tickets, I was unable to make it. Maybe someday I WILL make time to enjoy myself.  ~MY LIFE IN THE ARMY~ This morning I had run 4km. Maybe to some this may be easy for them but for me, I am still trying my best to finish the run without stopping. Yes, I admit I am not very fit type of guy. I am always lazy to do exercise. But then sometimes I will still go for a swim, jog, or even a ball game like basketball, tennis, bowling... is that consider a sport?  As usual, I was always being bullied by my so-call buddy. He always take things for granted. Maybe I was too good to him? Or maybe he thinks I am good to "eat"? Anyway I only need to serve two years, then I can get the hell out of there, but then there is still reservice... Hai... :_( Just pray that everything will turn out fine for me.   A little history about my army days... (",) I was enlisted on 2003 back in tekong. I was in Echo company platoon 2. During the 4 months training, I lost about 15kg. Wow, better then the slimming centers outside, they even pay you to slim down. Heehee... After my recuit days I found myself in 30SCE (a tough place to be) after all physical training, luckily, I was posted to SOCE. Hmm... still have about 1 more year to go... ORD!!!
