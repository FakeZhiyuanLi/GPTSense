       Well children Im back from Nice. More tired, more tanned and larger around the waistline (damn good food in Nice) than when I left Leeds Bradford Airport nine days ago.     It was an excellent trip. Nice was fabulous as were the day trips to Cannes, Monaco and Limone (Just over the border in Italy).    I would write more but to pe perfectley honest Im too tired and cant be bothered anymore today :p.    Over the next week Ill mainly be chilling so you could well see me on MSN a lot.  From Tuesday till Friday some mates from across the Uk will be joining meh and meh bro for some Halo carnage. My guests are named: Seifer (a.k.a. The brummie whore.), Beast (a.k.a. The Zen master of Halo PC) and Jimbo (a.ka. The guy who lives out in the sticks).    Thats all Ive got time for except my weekly round up of cool stuff.      Trax: Anything by Snow Partol or Keane  Movie: The Pldege starring Jack Nickleson. It liked serious balls.  Munch: Hmmm cocunut cake. The last meal I ate was some home cooked Shephards Pie. (*Licks lips*)  Linx: Nothing of intrest that Ive particullarly found but I suggest you visit  urlLink bbc.co.uk  Find out about anything and it has a search engine second only to the mighty Google herself. It also has loadsa great info about all kinds of stuff. It even has some fun games. Cool huh?  Well Peace out Readers,  l8rs, Luke.

       Blogged for the very first time.  Yes indeed this is my very first blog.  Two short notes on my blog: 1. If I criticise ya DEAL WITH IT. 2. Enjoy my blog, learn from it or whatever. It just a place for me to vent my frustrations online. At the end of each blog I will do this:  This will be my favourite album/song at time of writing>>> Trax:  This will be the last movie I watched>>> Movie: This will be the last piece of food I ate>>> Munch: This will be wher I place any links to websites or news articles I found interesting.  Peace Out Readers, l8rs! Luke
