      We have taken it alot easier today. We turned up at rehearsals last night only to find that nothing was ready yet. Us Koori's we have our 'Korri Time' well the Greeks here they have Greek time, ie the Olympics arenas not finished yet with like two weeks til the games atcually start. So anyway, Emma and Allan didn't get to have their sound check last night, we waited for ages, but the Greeks were working on their own time, things were supposed to be ready at 5:30pm and when 7:30pm came around and nothing was finished ie the stage, lighting, sound, we all decided to go back to the hotel and have dinner.   Our cab ride back from the museum was something we would not forget. The taxi driver was playing dumb, and trying to take us around the whole world, acting like he never knew where he was going, anyway, we came up to a street and he couldn't get through, there was police and army people everywhere. The taxi driver ordered us out, and said that their was a demonstration on and that we had to walk now. We barely knew where we were, and then all of a sudden we hear these loud screams and chanting going on. We started walking up the street, there was so many police everywhere, Emma was freaking out, we held each others hands, as we watched hundreds of people match the street, angry their voices. We didn't understand a word what was going on, and we were too scared to ask anyone. Today at our hotel we found out the march was a protest to the US embassy in regards to the war in Iraq.   The night ended quietly, I had sore feet by the time we got back to the hotel, it was again another early night.  Today we decided to take it easy. We had a quiet breakfast, and I watched Al iron all my clothes, pretty impressive he works good, ha ha, I train him good, jokes. And after that we headed down to the markets again for some more shopping. Wait til you see all the jewellery Al bought me. We walked around and then met up with the rest of the crew for lunch with Jennifer Bott who works for the Australia Arts Council. Lunch was great, we went to a great restaurant near the Plaka.   This afternoon Al and Emma are just practicing at the hotel,  the exhibition starts at 8:30pm. I am just about to go and ready, dressing up for the night. Jennifer told us that channel nine and channel seven are here from Australia, and that Cathie Freeman is sending a video message, and their is going to be lots of Australian Press, so I have to be looking the goods for the media, ha ha.   We are off on a cruise tomorrow to visit the islands of Agena, Poros and Hydra, they are fairly close to Athens, we would have loved to travel to Myconos, or Santorini, but time won't allow us, I think it is 6 hours ferry to Myconos. I am just excited to head to the beach and have a swim.

      It is around 3:20pm on Tuesday afternoon. I am feeling extremely drained, we have had the biggest day. But I will start off with last night. Emma, Allan and the crew finally arrived at 7:30pm last night. They looked completely stuffed, and Emma's bag was lost, she got it back this morning (bloody QANTAS) ha ha. Anyway I waited for them to shower and we headed down town to find some dinner. We stopped off at a busy little taverna in one of the narrow streets not far from our hotel. The food was absolutley devine. I had the house speciality which consisted of lamb souvalaki, and garlic sauce on pita bread with salsa type stuff on top. I don't know the greek name but it was so yummy. Al and Emma had mixed Giros, and we all left the table holding our bellies. As they were all so tired, we retreated back to our rooms for an early night.  I was up as usual at 6am. Breakfast at the hotel, and then we headed for the markets. We passed lots of flash shops, but we looked mostly at the flea markets for little gifts. We walked all the way to the Ancient Agora. The road was really dusty, and bumpy with lots of rocks etc. We wandered along the paths to the top of the mountain to the Acropolis. We saw the Theatre of Dionysos, temple of Olympian Zeus and the Odeum of Herodes. The view from the top was magnificent. As this is my second trip to Athens I was surprised how the scenary still was able to captivate me. Allan was enjoying himself, camera happy taking pictures everywhere. Once I get back I will post some on this site (I still have to invest in a digital). Al missed a perfect photo opportunity as I fell over on the steps walking down from the Acropolis, nothing hurt though, just embarassment as it happened in front of plenty of tourists, ha ha.   After a few hours of touring around the lankmarks, we headed back to the city for some lunch. We ate at a great little cafe outside the gates of the Agora City. I love Mousakka, and I stuffed myself on this. We did a bit more shopping on the way back to the hotel.   Allan and Emma are getting their stuff ready as they have rehersals at 5:30pm over at the Benaki Contempory Museum where they will perform tomorrow night. It is getting exciting.

      I arrived in Athens at 6:30am this morning, Greece time, but I think it was around 1:30pm Sydney time. The trip felt like it was never going to end, I guess it felt even longer as I was and still am by myself. Allan and the band are arriving tonight, their flight gets in at 5:30pm. I really feel for them, as they left before me yesterday, but cause their flight went via London it is taking them longer to get here. My flight wasn't that bad, I have been a great observer and had a few chuckles along the way. It was so funny last night, I was stopped over in Singapore for 2 1/2 hours, and I couldn't get over all these little old greek couples, they seemed to be bickering amongst themselves, and it all seemed to do with who was first, and going first. I had the same impression when I arrived at Athens airport. I was practically left for dead, trampled on as they all ran for passport lines, and then the baggage collection. I almost felt invisible as they pushed past me. But I had to laugh about it.  With the Olympics within weeks, I definately thought the airport security would have been fairly tight, but not all. After I finally made it the window to the customs/immirigration line, I was shocked that the guy didn't even say BOO to me. He took my passport looked at it, and stamped it, and pointed past him, not even a hello. My bags were not checked, scanned or x-rayed, I could have hid anything in it, but never mind, really it made getting out the place quicker.  My ride in the taxi to Plaka, where I am staying at the Electra Hotel was funny as. The taxi driver attempted to check how cluely I was, first acting like he didn't speak english, and then questioning me, I had a few phrases, and greetings written down in Greek, so I tried my foriegn tongue out, not bad I thought, and must have impressed him, as he didn't rip me off, and actually gave me a discount fair, well atleast I thought it was, it cost me $25 Euro, which is almost $50 Aus.  So I am now contemplating which way I will go, I think it is just after 10am here, after 5pm Sydney time, I just tried a Greek Mac, at Maccas, I was starving and it was the easiest thing to order, it tasted good, on a wrap bread with a yoghurt style sauce intsead of our mac's. I think I am going to wander around the streets until Allan and the rest of the crew arrive.

      What a fabulous gift. This is my first entry of many, and I am sure I will have a few stories to tell, and if you know me, I am sure you are nodding your head right now. I closed another chapter today, my last day working at UTS in the Faculty of Education Student Services City Campus. My stomach bloated (from my fabulous good bye luncheon at Cafe Otto )as I contemplate how to find the words to describe the wonderful people I have been working with since September. The memories are many, the laughs and tears I have shared. I hope I have definately left something with all of you guys. I know I haven't been much of an office worker, but I hope I have been someone who's spirit, you will always remember. Well I think I have a voice you will never forget, hey Shalini, or should I say Shazza Mazza!!! Well I love writing, but this is something new for me, collecting my thoughts and typing them into a computer. So bare with me, and my entries as I begin to learn how to use this site, and hopefully add some lovely pics! I will take you on my little adventures, and the dramas of just being me. First stop Athens, Greece. So I will sign off for now, but don't worry I will post a new entry very soon.

      Well I just got off a 10 hour flight, and now I am waiting in Singapore airport, it is just after 6 in the morning over here, it is two hours behind Sydney. I am getting ready for my connecting flight to home sweet home. I am planed out, and airport outed, I mean I just want to go home and find my bed. I am sick of getting pushed around in the airport, and waiting in queues for everything.  Right now I really can't wait to be home, I am really tired, I couldn't sleep much on the flight, I watched so many movies and did some boring crosswords.   Well I will see you all in Sydney then.

      Well my time in Athens Greece has been fantasic, I mean I really could find lots of words to describe the time I have had, but my taxi is picking me up in 15mins to take me to the airport, so I really have to get a move on.  The Greeks, they love to smoke (and smoke everywhere in taxi's, restaurants, while riding scooters and just about anytime), they love to eat (the best Gyros, souvalki and moussaka) and they love bright clothes and shoes (women in heels at the Acropolis, bright reds, oranges and yellow clothes, and lots of shoe shops.  I love the weather and the people have been so friendly and helpful with everything.  I will arrive back in Sydney tomorrow night, see you very soon, I don't really want to come home yet.

      We cruised three islands yesterday on our ship the Anna Maru. At 7:30am we were picked up at the hotel and transfered to the marina to board the vessel. There were lots of tourists from Italy, France and even some other Aussies on board. We headed to the top deck to soak up the sun, which was absolutely gorgeous, there was light breeze that made it even more enjoyable as it was nice and refreshing.  First port of call was the island of Poros, time was limtied here, so Al and I just wandered the tiny little streets and looked in the shops. Our next island was Hydra. It was magnificent. Just like the postcards and paintings, all the buildings were white with little blue shutters on them. The locals were so friendly as they called you into their shops, one guy told us that the rpice of livign is extremely expensive their, and that the locals relied on the thousands of tourists for income. We walked around the port and up a hill to find a little swimming spot. It was beautiful. Imagine, walking a quaint little path and steps, to find the shore, sparkling crystal blue water, just waiting for you to dive in. Aroundthe shore line, was a cave that you could swim into. There were many little kids running and jumping form the top, their laughter was inviting, and Al and I joined them jumping into the cool water. The bottom seemed to go on forever, we both couldn't get over the clearness of the water.  Our final stop was the Island of Agena. Here we hired a little scooter. We had wanted to get one for ages, as we thought it would be fun. It cost us $15 Euro for an hour, which is close to $30 Aus dollars, but it was well worth it. While others were walking round, we flew past them on the scooter. Al riding, and me holding on for my life on the back. He was doing 60 and it was only 30 permited, but I don't think they have speed cameras, jokes. Ha ha. We rode to the other side of the island and found our own quiet little spot by the shore and went for a swim. I was starting to feel the sun then, my arms, neck and face are really browner, I got a tan , ha ha ha.   Our cruised ended back at Pieurus and we were transfered by coach back to our hotel. We were so stuffed, we finally hit the shower at 9pm, and were too lazy to go and get dinner so we ordered room service.

      Today was my first day on the University of Hawaii Manoa Campus. I left with the other Norwegian girls at 8am and caught the bus. It kind of scary as we were not too sure where to go. I had a map and remembered some instructions Kerri-Ann had given me, so that was a start. We walked for what seemed for ages. The sun burning our skin as we treked along the road. Almost there we stopped at the University Health Services. We knew we had to get a check up there so we decided to get over and done with before getting to Rosemary's office. I was really unsure about the testing because of the baby. The nurse reassured me it was safe. They gave me a test in the skin for Tuberculous and they also gave me a blood test for the measles. After the blood test, I was faint, I collapsed on the floor out cold. I didn't remember how it happened, I just opened my eyes and I felt myself breathing so heavily. I was felt hot and was sweating. I had two nurses near me, one raising my legs and the other holding my hand and checking my pulse. I couldn't move, they eventually got me up into a wheelchair and took me to a bed to lie down and check me. I fell side ways, so the baby was okay. They checked me over, my blood pressure before letting me go. I didn't feel the best after that. I have a bruise on my arm from the blood test. I thought to myself later, if I can't handle a blood test, how am I going to handle labour, it makes me laugh. But the nurse said it is not uncommon for pregnant women to feel faint, especially seen as though I have just arrived and am adjusting in here to the climate etc.  After we left the health service we went to meet our International Exchange Officer Rosemary. She was so lovely, she gave me a warm hug when she saw me. She later told me that Sam and I would be the first Aboriginal Students from Australia to study here, and it made me feel important and special. It is a huge opportunity for people like us from our backgrounds. Rosie gave us a check list of things we needed to complete for enrolment. We set off in different directions, I was alone as I had different majors than the rest of the group.  My emotions were mixed all day. I think the fall had put me off, and I was less confident. I struggled to get a dollar bill into a vending machine to get a drink. I guy who appeared to be helpful offered to exchange coins with me for my note. What I realised after he walked away, that he duped me. He gave me 2 quarter dollars and 2 five cent pieces instead of 4 quarters. I was so thirsty and it really annoyed me, I think it was intentional you know. I forgot about it and walked towards the International Student Services to complete some paper work over there. Again I got frustrated as I didn't have everything yet, I needed this, and I couldn't do that until I got this, etc etc, and I started to get upset as I felt like I didn't know what I was doing. I walked away, and thought I will try and get some money so I can atleast get organised for my health plan. The bank was a joke, they wouldn't cash all my travellers cheques, and then they wanted to charge me for this etc and that etc, so I just got my money and left.  I walked outside across the park, and I felt helpless. What had I achieved, it was after 1pm and I had been at the uni since 8:8am and had got nothing finished. I decided to pay Kerri-Ann a visit. I needed to see her about subjects and registering, but more than anything, I just needed a familiar face. As I entered her office, she stood up and reached out for me. It was just what I needed, a big hug. I held her as I felt tears well in my eyes. I fought them back, and I didn't want to show her I was too sad. I explained what I needed to do, and she agreed to help me. But first things first, she took me to one of her favourite restaurants. It was great, and immediately I started to feel better. We ate at California Pizza at Ala Moana. We sat and talked, and it was the first time I really got to open up to Kerri-Ann about myself. I needed to talk to her, and she was such an attentive listener. I felt so drawn to her. When I listen to her talk, I hear the passion in her voice, the sincerity and the emotion. It moves me. I want to be just like her. Her voice has more power than I think she realises. I have always looked at Joe Fraser my old lecturer and Leanne King my lecturer and year coordinator for strength. Although the age gaps, they all inspire me. I look at them and I feel like I can do it. I want that PhD and I want to be able to write, write the truth and tell the real stories of Aboriginal people like them and me.  Coming to Hawaii was about learning more about myself, and another culture and people. I have always believed you learn to look more inside yourself when you step outside your usual surroundings.  After lunch Kerri-Ann and I settled my subject choices. We couldn't register them so I will have to return to her tomorrow to check on it. I came back to the hotel and have felt exhausted. I had a little nap, and talked to Hege about her day. It is good to offload to someone else, as well as hear about how her experience is for her as well.  Tomorrow will be day 2 of getting enrolled. Lets see how that goes.

      Well we meet again, this time I am in Oahu, a beautiful island part of the state of Hawaii USA. I arrived last night at 11:20pm Hawaii time. The flight wasn't too bad, around 10 hours duration. I am staying at the Ocean Resort Hotel Waikiki. It is great, close to everything. I am sharing a studio unit with a girl called Hege from Norway. She is here studying on exchange just like me. I didn't get up to much last night, Kerri-Ann my wonderful Hawaiian contact picked me up from the airport. It was great to see a familiar face, she presented me with gifts of a necklace, a flowers lei and a candy lei. It was lovely.  I got to the hotel and was famished, I had to walk 5 blocks to find a convience store to get something to eat, phoned home and then forced myself to lay and rest to help the time difference. It is 20 hours behind Sydney over here.  The weather today has been beautiful. I went shopping to Ala Maona. It is a big mall on the other side of town. Over here they only know two directions, the mountains is one way, and the ocean is the other. Kerri-Ann said I should never get too lost, cause all you have to do is just look around and walk the other way.  My experiences with American/Hawaiian culture have already cracked me up. The money is the worst, I have to make sure I look at the notes properly as the money all looks the same. The coins are a pain as well. I had to ask someone how much a dime was, I have since found out it is 10 cents, see my nan was right, you learn something new everyday. Getting the bus to the shops was funny as well, I went to pay the driver and he laughed, and instructed me to put the money in this little machine, and I said to him, do I get a ticket, and he giggled again and said well do you want one, and I felt a little silly.  Everyone has been really friendly, there seems to be a lot of tourists and visiting people here, so much that it almost seems hard to pick out who are locals and who are not.  The view from my room is breath taking. On one side you see mountains, and the other side is the ocean, blue and sparkling. Around the city it is very green, lots of trees and plants, it is a really clean and beautiful place. I will post some photos as I have a new digital camera now, but I will have to wait til I go to uni tomorrow so I can do it. I am using the hotel computers and it costs alot of money.
