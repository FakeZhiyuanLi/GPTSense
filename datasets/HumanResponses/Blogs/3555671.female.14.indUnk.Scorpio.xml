      I was going to dedicate the title of this entry to my mother, but she isn't worthy enough. Somehow she convinced my brother she was "just seeing the dog." So yeah, my dog is gone. My brother is only nine, I suppose I can't expect anything else. He doesn't know any better than to fucking love her still.  So yeah, I just called her on the phone and harassed her. "What are you talking about ..?" I hang up.  In English today I found out that my current average for this semester is a 31. :) Wohoo. So yeah, I have a lot of work to do tonight, and I'll probably get my average up to about a 50, at a minimum. So I won't fail for the year .. woohoo.

      Today after school I had to go to the orthodontist, where they just reminded me of everything I already fucking know about my teeth. I'll probably  never  get my braces off.  Around 8 PM I fell asleep. Of course, no one fucking woke me up, so I just woke up on my own about 10 minutes ago. I tried setting an alarm to wake me up after an hour, I guess that didn't work.  Doesn't look like I'll do finishing my essay or project ... I'm too exhausted to care anymore.  This weekend I need to get new shoes.

      Wow. I'm such a loser. I know I'm going to end up writing in this again later today. Woo. I'm in Multimedia ... aka, computers. Talk about boredom. :/  This site is probably going to end up blocked, just like all the other journal sites. I like this better than that livejournal shit. It's easier to customize this, because I have a better understanding of HTML.  I'm exhausted.

      Uh huh. It's about 4:30. I'm bored.  I still haven't finished my essay for English or started that other stupid project I have to do. I'm such a procrastinator. Ugh..  I wish I had more to write about, but eh. Nothing really happens when your life is so pathetic and you're such a boring, dull person.  I might be moving. :/ I just moved back into this house with my dad, now he's saying my mother wants to sell it and he's probably going to agree because there's so many memories. She took all her shit yesterday. Good. The house is a little empty but I don't care.  I don't think I'm gonna go to sleep anytime soon, and I have school in 2 hours. Five more days, five more fucking days. Ugh..    Spend all your time waiting for that second chance  For the break that will make it ok There's always some reason to feel “not good enough”  And it's hard at the end of the day  I need some distraction, oh beautiful release  Memories seep from my veins  They may be empty and weightless, and maybe  I'll find some peace tonight

      Mhm. Boring day. Because I stayed up last night till about 4:30, I ended up sleeping all day. I woke up around 2:45, hearing my father speaking with two elderly women from social services. They were here to see the house, and all. To make sure it's fit for us to live in .. and whatever. I walked downstairs, went on the computer, bored. My father then ordered a pizza, I just ate two slices. It was good.  Just watching movies on comedy central now. It's Sunday ... I hate Sundays. :(  This week is the last five days of school, and then I have finals/regents exams. I really hope I don't fail, really. I don't want to go to summer school. :/

      I've been signing up with these online journal sites often lately. I write one or two entries and end up bored with it. Maybe that'll change for this.  Today I met with an old friend. I haven't seen her for about 2-3 years now. It was a bit awkward, because well, she's so different from me. She's so "preppy", let's say, and I'm basically the complete opposite. I'm not "goth" or anything of that nature, but she was telling me how she "hooked up with this guy", and blah blah blah. She asked me what was new with me ... and I wasn't really sure what to respond with. Nothing's new. Nothing. My life has gotten worse in the past few years. Her and her fucking naive life of going to "clubs" and being a fucking cheerleader. Wow. Isn't that great? I think I want to be just like her. She didn't like hanging out with me after a while, I could tell. "You're so different ... you're not as ... hyper, and talkative."  Dumb people never cease to amuse me. Really.  So then I went to her aunt's house, because her aunt is one of my dad's friends ... that's how I met her. I ate tacos and then we left. I hugged her goodbye, to be polite, and  she told me to IM her sometime on AIM or whatever. Yeah, right.  See how I bicker on about worthless shit?
