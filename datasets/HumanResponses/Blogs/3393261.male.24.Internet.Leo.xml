       So just a minute ago I had on the "Power Rock" channel on  urlLink MusicChoice  and a song came on which I immediately "felt" was by the 80s butt-rock band  urlLink Winger . Several seconds later the song/artist info showed up confirming my intuition. I am ashamed that I knew this. I'm gonna go hang myself now...

       Woohoo. Goin to see  urlLink Iced Earth  at  urlLink The World  in  urlLink Pittsburgh  on June 12th, with supporting acts  urlLink Beyond The Embrace  and  urlLink Trivium .  I have been a big fan of Iced Earth for several years now, ever since the release of their " urlLink Something Wicked... " album. (And have since picked up their entire catalog.)  I just recently discovered Trivium and Beyond The Embrace and they friggen rock. They definately have the potential to be big (as far as metal goes anyways.) I actually discovered both bands while listening to  urlLink Music Choice .  All three bands have absolutely sick guitar riffage, so this concert is gauranteed to kick ass. I haven't gotten to a good concert in a few years now so I'm excited about this one. As a bonus, my buddy Aaron used his connections to land us a sweet deal on a room at the  urlLink Renaissance  so we don't have to drive back to  urlLink Erie  deaf, sweaty and beaten.

       The other night, Sharon and I watched  urlLink The Boondock Saints . She mentioned it was one of her favorite movies, and by her description, it sounded cool, so I decided to give it a spin. Basic plot summary (lifted from  urlLink IMDB ):  Irish brothers Connor & Murphy McManus live and work in Boston. Feeling that God's will to rid Earth from all human Evil was given to them as a mission, they set out to do their divine deed. A public outcry is never heard, and even FBI agent Paul Smecker, who follows their trace of bloodshed, admits that the boys are doing exactly what he secretly always has wished to happen. Risking their lives for their beliefs of Veritas (truth) and Aequitas (justice), the Boondock Saints are hyped by the public, for they are doing good, which only few dare to admit.  Sounds cool, yes? Well it is. This movie was damn cool. Lots of gun fights, interesting cinematography, lots of swearing, lots of great one liners and amusing dialog...  Rocco: Fucking... What the fuck. Who the fuck fucked this fucking... How did you two fucking fucks... FUCK.  Connor: Well, that certainly illustrates the diversity of the word.   Fuckin' right.

       The past few weeks I've gone ape-shit with the book buying; In no particular order...      urlLink Coder to Developer: Tools and Strategies for Delivering Your Software  by Mike Gunderloy   urlLink UML Distilled: A Brief Guide to the Standard Object Modeling Language, Third Edition  by Martin Fowler   urlLink Agile and Iterative Development: A Manager's Guide  by Craig Larman   urlLink Agile Project Management with Scrum  by Ken Schwaber   urlLink Test-Driven Development in Microsoft .NET  by James W. Newkirk, Alexei A. Vorontsov   urlLink Design Patterns C#  by Steven John Metsker   urlLink Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture  by Martin Fowler   urlLink Writing Effective Use Cases  by Alistair Cockburn    I'm at a point in my career where I'm trying to transform from "Code Monkey" to fully-functional killing  urlLink machine  sent from the future to bring about the apocolypse by infiltrating Skynet and executing the future leader of the resistance against the machines, one John Connor. Errr, noooo, wait. I mean to become a better developer, focusing on lead/architect/manager type responsibilities. Yah that's what I meant. I'll post reviews of these books when warranting....

       Today I went hunting around in vain to all the video stores in the area that might have the new  urlLink four disc edition  of  urlLink Saving Private Ryan . Alas, none of them had it; but all of them told me they could "order it." Fuck that. I can order it too. I have a credit card and internet access. So if you're not willing to settle for the measly two disc, non-DTS version of Saving Private Ryan, save yourself the gas and just order it from  urlLink Amazon .

       Just heard about this new WWII shooter coming out around Winter 2004 called  urlLink Brothers In Arms ...   "Created by Texas-based  urlLink Gearbox Software , Brothers in Arms is the most realistic and authentic WWII shooter ever. While other WWII games have sugarcoated the war experience, Brothers in Arms is based on a true story and will immerse gamers into the gritty, uncensored and emotionally-charged side of war. The game puts you in the shoes of Sgt. Matt Baker, a D-Day paratrooper squad leader, and asks you to lead the squad as you balance their lives with the success of the mission. The true stories and historical events you experience on your perilous journey take you through real battlefields meticulously recreated from aerial reconnaissance images,  urlLink US Army  Signal Corps photos and eye-witness accounts of war-torn Normandy. Players of all skill levels can battle their way through this intense experience because of Brothers in Arms innovative and accessible command and control system. "    My god this sounds awesome. Between this and the various additions to the  urlLink Call of Duty  fanchise that are schedule for later this year and early next year, the WWII shooter genre is gonna just keep getting better. I know *my* nipples are hard.  On a related note, a new  urlLink D-Day 60th Anniversary Commemorative Edition  of  urlLink Saving Private Ryan  is coming out on DVD this coming Tuesday. And there is an  urlLink expanded box set version  that includes two other WWII documentaries. This version is also the  urlLink DTS  version which is a must for this awesome home theater movie.

       So the other night I'm going on this date with this chick right? No seriously. True story. So when I get to the  urlLink coffee shop , my date is standing outside in the rain talking to this hobo who is rambling on and on. (Apparently she was earlier than I.) Finally we go inside... and the hobo follows us in! We get our drinks and sit down and the hobo sits down next to us. He is babbling on and on about Vietnam and Iraq and Mafia movies and how he just got out of jail and all this crap. Ok, his stories were amusing but he was running a total  COCK BLOCK . I hadn't had the chance to say more than like three sentences to my date when this hobo mentions something about how he needs to get over to the homeless shelter but he doesnt want to walk cuz the rain is making his arthritis flare up. Ok. I offer to take him over there. I stand up and grab my jacket and he stands and keeps rambling but I keep motioning towards the door.  I leave my date there while I take this old coot over to the place and on the whole ride over he's talking about how he's trying to stay clean and "off the crack." And then he goes into this long spiel about how to tell the good crack from the back crack by how it burns differently depending on whether it was made with rat poison or embalming fluid. Fascinating shit let me tell ya. Meanwhile I'm thinking "I just hope this hobo doen't try to knife me or molest me or molest me with a knife. I hope my car isn't gonna reak of hobo stink." Finally I drop him off and he's telling me how if I ever need a favor that I can find him at such and such a place. I'm thinking "great, if I'm ever in a bind, at least I know I can count on a homeless crack addict to back me up!" So about 15 minutes later I get back to the coffee shop and proceed to have a great time with a great chick. But that's a story for another day...

       Woohoo. New credit card arrived today. $1000 credit line, bringing my total credit limit across 4 cards to $2600. Pretty good considering 3 months ago I had a total limit of $300. Plus earlier this week I got my federal tax return of $4000 (I refiled for past years) so right now I am so friggen close to buying my  urlLink plasma tv  I can almost taste it.

        Album Review: Beyond The Embrace: Insect Song [2004]   After hearing the track "Fleshengine Breakdown" by  urlLink Beyond The Embrace  some time last week or the last on the digital music channel that my  urlLink shitty cable company  provides for me, I was immediately on a holy quest to hear more from this band. I was immediately hooked. Tuesday I picked up their two albums "Against The Elements" [2002] and "Insect Song" [2004], after driving all over  urlLink town  to find a store with a copy....   Insect Song has to be one of the best CDs I've heard in a long time.  This band just friggen rocks. If I had to compare them to other bands... Musically they are a blend of  urlLink Metallica  and  urlLink In Flames . THREE FUCKING GUITARISTS! HELL YES! Being a big fan of intricate guitar arrangements, this album is like sex in Heaven. True story. Lots of melody and harmony and crunching thrash riffs. AND LEADS! The vocals are also pretty kickass. Again best compared to In Flames, mostly the Jester Race and Whoracle albums. Sometimes reminds me of James Hetfield (of Metallica) especially James on live recordings when it doesn't sound quite as produced or perfected. Jimmy like. The lyrics are equally cool. Thematically reminds me of  urlLink Sentenced  and In Flames (again Whoracle), an always enjoyable mix of "Humanity is on a Downward Spiral" and "I'm on a Downward Spiral." Rock. \m/   Strengths:  Pretty much everything. Best "guitarage" of 2004 (I made that shit up. Copyright 2004 Me.) Vocals. Lyrics. The artwork/packaging. The production/mixing. All solid.   Weaknesses:  Not much. With three guitarists, its hard to hear the bass guitar. There are stronger tracks and weaker tracks, but even the weaker tracks are better than pretty much everything to come out this year so far. The accoustic instrumental in the middle of the CD is cool but is in the way when you're rockin' out. (My first spin of the disc was while in my car, so this track wasn't appropriate for aggressive driving.) Hmmm. Its only about 45 minutes. I like longer albums. But better a short album of good tracks than a long album of filler.   The Rundown:  Release on May 18th, 2004, comprising 10 Tracks at just over 43 minutes of top notch "melodic death metal." Buy it. Download it. Steal it. But get it now.   Bonus:  BTE is gonna be in Pittsburgh, PA on June 12th with  urlLink Trivium  in support of  urlLink ICED EARTH ! This concert is gonna be awesome. I am in desparate need of somebody to go to this concert with me. (*cough*Aaron*cough*)  \m/

       hmmm. the notorious "first post". hell if i don't know what to write as a proper introduction....     "i like computers. i like shiny things. i like loud music. i like girls. i like funny things.  urlLink ok danny bubye! "     well that was precious. hmmm what to expect from my blog. mostly pointless bitching about stuff that sucks and pointless gushing about stuff that's cool. occasionally i might have something useful to say (if you happen to be a  urlLink .NET  developer) or something interesting to say (if you're one of my personal friends) but probably your time is better spent reading  urlLink slashdot  and  urlLink downloading mp3s .

       Last week, I laughed my ass off at  urlLink Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story .  If you like crass, vulgar, slapstick humor, definately check this one out. And be sure to sit through the credits because there is a "hidden scene" at the end. Its dead sexy.  Also, does anyone remember the  urlLink NES  game  urlLink Super Dodgeball ? Holy crap did that game rock. Since  urlLink Nintendo  has been  urlLink re-releasing  a bunch of old NES games for the  urlLink Gameboy Advance , hopefully this classic will once again see the light of day.

       Yesterday,  urlLink Yahoo  decided to upgrade their  urlLink Messenger  service to blockout 3rd party clients, such as  urlLink Trillian . A day later, Trillian developers released a patch and we're back in business.  urlLink Trillian Pro  is one of the best pieces of software I've ever actually paid for. :)

       Recently I haven't posted anything. The reason? I've been so engrossed in experience my new  urlLink Hitachi UltraVision 51" Widescreen HDTV . Holy crap. Watching movies and playing video games is like an all new experience. I think its better than going to a  urlLink movie theater  now. And video games are freakin sweet now. The only downside is that its made apparent how superior the  urlLink Xbox  is to the  urlLink GameCube . As much as I love  urlLink Nintendo , the Hi-def capabilities of  urlLink Microsoft 's monster make the cube's games utterly unwatchable. Granted the cube is still going through s-video while the xbox is running component, but I'm unsure how much of a difference this will make. I need to do some research into this matter if upgrading the cube to the component cables will make a significant difference. Even so, I've run out of component jacks on my receiver. Wow I've outgrown it already. DOH!

       As I mentioned in  urlLink my previous post , Saturday I saw  urlLink Iced Earth ,  urlLink Trivium , and  urlLink Beyond The Embrace  put on a fucking incredible show.  BTE opened with a killer set, playing my favorite songs off their two cds. I was very impressed. They sounded great and they all were really into int, long hair flailing everywhere. The vocalist Shawn was really fucking cool, I was chatting with him at the merch stand after their set. He was really chill and polite as we chatted about random shit for a few minuites. Their bassist was wearing a  urlLink Masters of the Universe  t-shirt so they earned bonus points for that. Overall I think BTE was my favorite set of the night.  Next up was Trivium. Their set consisted of almost entirely new material from their upcoming cd. It sounded great although I was disappointed because I was really excited to hear them perform some of the songs on their Ember To Inferno cd. The vocalist/guitarist Matt has the most intense stage presence. When he's performing he looks like he's about to explode with rage. And he worked the crowd pretty damn good. "I WANNA SEE YOU FUCKERS IN THAT FUCKIN PIT RIGHT THE FUCK NOW!!!!" Hell yes. Afterwards, Aaron and I got to talk to these guys as they were coming off set and they were really cool. I had a Trivium shirt on and they were happy to see that. They were surprised that we had actually heard of them before hand. It hadn't occurred to me that most people that go to shows don't pay much interest to the supporting acts. Personally I always look at who is touring with my favorite bands as a means to discover new music to check out. It was cool to chat with them for a few minutes and Aaron got a signed drumstick.  By the time Iced Earth hit the stage, the venue was about twice as full as before the first act. Iced Earth put on an amazing show, performing for nearly two hours. Unfortunately when you have as many albums as these guys, you can't fit all of your best songs into one show, so many of the songs I had hoped to hear went unplayed. The crowd was really into the show; more people in the pit, stage diving, crowd surfing and all that shit. I get a feeling that the band doesn't care for that stuff though, and I don't blame them. I came to see Iced Earth perform, not some sweaty scrawny punk kid who has fallen onto the floor repeated slam into me with a running head star when I'm not looking. Fuck you kid. Overall the set was great. The encore was awesome, consisting of the Gettysburg trilogy and finally Iced Earth (the song). Unfortunately I didn't get to meet the band, but they did reaffirm their claim to one of my favorite bands of all time.

       wow, the irony of the title of  urlLink my last post ...  last night,  urlLink Sharon  and i had our fourth (and final) "date". yesterday morning when we were planning, it all seemed cool, and she said she was planning to bring a change of clothes so she could stay over and then go to work in the morning (9 - 3 shift). sweet, everything sounded great. the plan was for her to give me a call when she got out of work after 9 to let me know when she was on her way into town. i would then meet her at  urlLink Sherlocks  to see some band at 10 PM.  ten'o'clock rolls around and still no call. i call her house; no answer. i leave a message and head to the bar... i get there about 10:30 and she's there with her friend Staci. ok, weird. i wasn't expecting a third wheel. (turns out i was to be the thrid wheel). i apologize for being late but mention i was waiting for her call. she says she was just about to call me. hmmmmm. were at the bar having a drink and the two of them are chattin it up and i'm kinda on the outside trying to jump in. not an easy task to an introvert at a noisy bar. thankfully i run into two of my buddies from  urlLink highschool  and i shoot the shit with them. this was the only good thing that happened last night.  about quarter after eleven, sharon says that Staci wants to go home and that her car is at Staci's so she has to leave with her. (in hindsight, if she was planning to stay over my place, driving separately would've been the obvious choice) i offer to drive her to her car and then go back to my place as "planned" but she says Staci would be mad. I'm thinking maybe she's the jealous type or something so whatever. I ask her when/where she wants to meet up after she gets her car. i suggest meeting at my place at midnight. she "agrees" and we say goodbye. i bullshit with my highschool buddies for a while longer before heading home.  i get home about ten til midnight and starting watching for her car. midnight passes... 12:15... 12:30... 12:45... by this time i'm concerned. i start analyzing the situation, figuring out reasons why she might not be here yet. finally about 1:30 i go to bed and try to fall asleep. impossible. half of me was pissed off for getting stood up, and the other half was still expected her to show up any minute now. any time i'd hear a car door i'd run to the window and look like some pathetic puppy dog. at some point i finally manage to fall asleep.  i wake up early the next day (9:30), with a killer headache from lack of sleep and  urlLink loud music . (wasn't a hangover) i was hoping for an IM or email or something from her, with some absolving reason why she never made it (or at least called) but no. (even though  urlLink Trillian  logged that she had signed on at 3 AM)  finally a little bit ago she signed on and I messaged her. the convo was as follows...    Jim: hey Sharon: hi  Jim: whats up? Sharon: I'm not interested in seeing you anymore jim Jim: why? Sharon: Because I sense that you want a commitment and I don't Jim: ok... you couldn't have told me this yesterday before i was expecting you over? i was worried something had happened Sharon: ok Jim: i never asked you to commit to anything Jim: it seemed like we were having a good time together Sharon: we were... Jim: but? Sharon: But,  Jim: honestly, why aren't you interested? Jim: is it something i said/did? Sharon: no...it's not anything you said or did Jim: at least tell me for my own god Sharon: you are a good guy Sharon: I think we're on different levels... Sharon: I'm still a bit up and down/moody Sharon: You are all chill  Jim: c'mon please don't give me these vague excuses. just be honest with me, ok? Sharon: Bc jimbo...I don't think I can connect with you anymore than I haver Sharon: have Sharon: I think this is as good as it gets with you Jim: how so? Sharon: there are other men whom I have made stronger connections with Jim: fine. that's all i needed to hear Jim: can i ask one thing though? Sharon: what's that Jim: were you intimate with this guy before/during our encounters?
