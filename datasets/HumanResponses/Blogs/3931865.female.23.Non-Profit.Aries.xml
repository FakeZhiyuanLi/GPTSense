      Okay i admit it, i didnt find out about this place all by myself, it took some networking, and finally ive found a place where i can write everything that comes to mind, bullshit and non!  I owe my new blogspot to a internet pal, MizzDanya, i believe her blog is called DanyaDamnit, so ya'll check it out...damnit!Anyway she's only 19 and so strangely intelligent, fo real ya'll her mindset got me thinking about some things, even had me considering firing my current friends and trying to make some new ones..will provide ya'll with aplications further down, or just email me and request one!Anyway got some friends down here who i told to check out her page and girlfriend is surrrrious..lol she had us all rrrolling with her experiences worldwide, from South Africa to Heathrow, so make sure when ya'll have time..(you betta make time) check out ma homegirl Danya, and be in for a rude awakening.. Now about moi, im a Zimbabwean who has been lost in Toronto for about 6 years now.Seriously im lost, im guessing that i will need about 3 million dollars to tavel the world and find a place where i can get in where i fit in, it just doesnt seem right.Life of monotony, bills and same ol bullshit different day, why do they make it seem so easy on all those travelling shows, especially with that Brit guy , Ian who has a hella good time wherever he Globe trots???  I need me a damn job like that, pssshhttt half of those jack asses cant even pronounce the places they visit..so ive set out to do a 360 on my life,firing friends i should have got rid of a long time ago, re-establishing contact with those i should have kept in contact with, doing some physical changes here and there, damn i cant dump my boyfrend?? I guess he can stay, but i will be keeping an eye out on his ass... hopefully ya'll will follow my blog and see how things turn out, till than my question still remains, can i borrow a dollar or maybe 3 million??
