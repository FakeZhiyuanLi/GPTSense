      Seriously, you have got to go and look at this.

Its one of the oddest, and strangely addictive things on the interent. If anyone can work out quite how it works, please tell me.

      There is no one of earth alive to day that has ever commited an action completely devoid of greed. We are all greedy.

Stuff love and hate, the most important human emotion is greed, or personal want. This drives every thing. Every other emotion we expreience stems from this: Love - want of someone, Hate - want of something negative to happen to someone or something, jealousy - want of someone elses things.

Each action we make on a day to day basis is decided by what we, at that time, as a human being, want to do to make us feel right. No one has ever done ANYTHING solely for someone else. There is always a payoff, even if it is only feeling good about ourselves, that we factor into the equation of deciding what to do. The result of the event might be more negative than the result of another choice we could have made, but no one has ever made a descision based entirely on someone elses want. How coudl they, as part of doing that is to want to do something for someone else, therefore making you feel better.

No matter how charitable you are, there is no choice you make, no action you take, that has not taken into account, in however small part, your own feelings and wants.

Thus, each and every single one of us is greedy, its just a matter of degree.

      Well, its Wednesday. As I speak, there is about 2/3 of my year sittting in an exam hall, doing their French listening, and tomorrow its my turn, with my German listening. Then, after that, I've got my IT exam, and then we really enter into the fray, with English language, and loads of others in quick succession. 

I always thought that when it came to this time, I'd pull my act together. For two years, I have staved off all my worries about how little work I was doing with the soothing knowledge, that come exam time, I'd buck my ideas up, and do some serious fucking work. Unfortunatly, this has entirely failed to happen. I'm screwed, and I know it. I can see the end of tunnel, and the only light is one with 'YOU'VE FAILED' emblazoned on it. Fuck Fuck Fuck.

All the way through my school career, GCSEs have seemed so far off. The seemingly ulitmate milestone that we all have to pass, but you never think you will. They have always seemed so far away, a distant goal to strive for, but one that'll never happen. However, they are happening. They are round the corner. In my veiw, after these, childhood is lost. That sounds so fucking pretentious, but thats what it feels like. I mean, for 11 years, I have been at school, and in sight, just, all this time have been these exams, but they've always been so far away that any progress towards them is unoticable. However, we're there. All at once, they go from just something you think about every so often to RIGHT HERE RIGHT NOW. And I don't like it... Mummy, I wanna be little again.....

      It is strange how, once you have got an idea in your head that you want to be true, an ideal that you want the world to fit to, your mind can twist almost any piece of infomation, even direct evidence to the contary, so that to you, it appears that ideal is on its way to being achievied. Its a mental survival trait, in my opinon. If this ability was removed, the entire human race would begin to slowly turn into manic depressives. Its affects would not be apparent immeadiatly, but as more and more people realised that the driving force behind thier life, the one thing that made their worth living was in fact a great big pile of huge fucking dog shite, human soceity would begin to turn in on itself. If everyone had reasonable, sensible goals, then life couldn't work on a day to day basis.

      There we sat, the four of us - my mum, my dad, my aunt and me. Munching on a curry in a lovely indian restaurant, chatting nicely about my grandma. About how she would love the restaurant, and how nice her garden is looking. Completely ignoring the fact that as we spoke, about 150 miles away, she was in a hospice, slowly dying of cancer. Carefully skirting round the subject, tiptoeing round any mention of how she actually was, of the fact she had days to live.

Well, shes dead now, and the funeral has taken place, and it was awful, and derpessing, but its done with, and I'll never forget her. However, it still gets to me. The way soceity's taboos and opinions stop any discussion of serious issues, things that need to be talked about, in any other situation apart form the extremes of emotions. We were sat there, casually disscussing my grannie's fuschia bushes, all of us knowing she'd be dead in days, and that it really didn't matter, and all of us with these feelings we needed to talk about, but couldn't, so we focussed on the parts of her life which weren't to hot to touch. 

Ah well. Rest in Peace, Jean and Richard Pendle

      Well, here I am. Hopefully at the the start of a great thing, prehaps a great adventure. Or prehaps I'll get bored of this in a few weeks, like I normally do, and neglect this, until it dies, alone and tired, like a hobo whose reached the end of his miserable existance.

Well, its a Sunday afternoon, and I've managed, again, to spend far too long on the PC. An unproductive week, followed by an equally unrpoductive weekend, with a worrying lack of work. Ah well

      Right, almost there. Its weird to think they're actually over.

Ah well, soon the summer will be here, along with seemingly endless summer evenings, the sun, the heat and more fun than you can shake a medium sized stick at.

Have just finished my History paper, and its interesting. For some reason, I have suddenly become interested in the things I was writing about. For instance, before the exam, I couldn't give a toss about how Hungary left the Soviet Union in 1956, but now, after having written tw opages on it for my GCSE, I feel this strange urge to go back and find out what really happened....

      I met the happiest person in the world yesterday.

Yesterday, the window cleaner came over. It was a bit annoying to have so many people in the house, with three window cleaners traipsing through the house, so I went out into the garden for a smoke.  

While I was out there, the head window cleaner came over and asked for a light. We sat on the bench of the garden for a bit, and chatted.  

The guys fucking wicked. He comes over once every eight weeks or so, and has done for years, but I've never spoken to him properly before, just noticed he was a cheerful fellow. Now I've actually talked to him, I've come to the conclusion that he is in fact the embodiment of happiness.   

We were talking about window cleaning, and how fucking hard it must be to do some of the complex windows in our house, like the roof of the conservatory, and the windows above it. From here, we got chatting about his life. The guy actually has no worries at all. He's got a job he enjoys. He doesn't earn very much for it, but enough to haev his own house, nad hes got a family. He works when he wants to, he goes out when he wants. Hes the kind of person who just reminds you of sunny days, for some reason. I reckon it would be impossible to be even mildly depressed around him. Its weird. Hes got this kind of happiness that doesn't grate, or get on your nerves, or piss you off at all. He just kinda.... radiates. Unworried by anything.  

Nice bloke  

Thats about it, really

      Ok, for five years I have been learning biology. I have had two teachers, one of whom was nice, and friendly, and liked me, and one of whom to which I think the best comparison that can be drawn is Satan. With a Northern  accent.    

Mrs Lunter, the Birmingham/Bath Satan was evil. Pure and simple. She also had, seemingly, powers gifted to her by some unknown, unnatural force.    

With her, an hour lesson would turn into five hours. In other hour long science lessons we might look at and write about a quarter of what we do in biology. Not a lesson to be drowsy for, or even mildly not with it.    


Added to this, she hated me. There were only three people in her class who she'd taught from year eight, and all three of us were not, as you might call it, perfect students. We were all capable, as she kept reminding us, in a voice you'd more expect to be saying something along the lines of 'Feeling lucky, Punk', but we had 'application difficulties'. This was the result of one major problem with our timetabling, which meant we had to hand in biology homework on a day we didn't have a lesson, a complex process for me even know, with my sieve-like memory, but for the year eight dave, with his lack of developed excuse ability, it was hell. I couldn't do it for the life of me, and could never find a reason I couldn't, except that I couldn't quite get my head around the concept, which apparently wasn't good enough. But yeah, she hated me then, and still does. I often, in the past two years, had to seek safety behind my rugby-playing friend Matt to avoid being asked every single question she could think of. Anytime I got one right, a grunt was heard. Anytime I got one wrong, I got a lecture on how intelligent I could be, if only I'd APPLY myself.   


And so, after five years of biology, and four years of heart attacks, stressed mornings spent working out what I was going to say, and lectures, and evil glances at parents evenings, I've finished with biology. Thats it. Five years of teaching, condensed into one hour and a half of exam. And at that, an hour and a half of a suprisingly easy paper. Up yours Mrs Lunter. In some ways I want to get an A* to prove I can apply myself, but in other ways, I don't, just to prove you wrong. Still, thanks for the Penguin Bar on my birthday, and the rare times we had when you weren't threatening me. I shall never forget you, nor you cruel jokes at me, and the amount of times I have described you as harshly as possibly, only to find you standing behind me. You, cruel, cold-hearted, yet oddly  effective  teacher. I know more biology off by heart than any other subject, yet you have caused me mor epain than any other teacher I ahve ever had. Except Mr Medhurst. But at least he has comic relief built in, in the form of his near overwhelming bulk.

      Now, today, as I sat down to my regular breakfast, at 1pm (isn't study leave bloody marvellous?) I came across something interesting in the Guardian.

Apparently, female infiedelity is genetic. This sounds so wrong at first, but in fact, scientific studies on twins and on non-related women have discovered that certain women carry a gene that encourages the lady in question to remain less faithful to their supposed life partner than others.

This raises an odd point. Does this mean the masculine urge to be unfaithful is just with all of us penis-bearing ones from birth? Are we genetical coded to be unfaithful, whoever we are? Surely this gives us a fair excuse? I mean, we cannot be blamed if its in our genes, surely? Its only logic that if our body tells us to, then our mind has no control? I think that if ever a man gets caught with a bit on the side in the future that this should hold as a strong defense. It would be like divorcing someone for farting.

However, another point it raises is the question of how far our birth state influences our behaviour in the rest of our life. If there is a gene that does this, then whose to say there isn't a gene that makes someone act more polite than another, or anything like that. Since our actions are based on our emotions, and the emotions we are feeling are based at least in part to the chemical state of our brain at the time, then surely it makes logical sense to assume that certain personality traits could have been hard coded from birth. The problem is with this is that if it were true, then how much can you blame someone for their actions? Is it right to punish something they are wired to do? We punish pyschopaths, yes, and they are proven to be... 'different'. Yet we almost do this not for the fact this person has behaved morally wrong, but to keep ourselves safe by encouraging a different set of behaviours. Surely, if someone is genetically inclined to steal things, and has no control over whether they do it, it is wrong on our part to cause them pain, emotional or physical, for doing so?

      I tried to avoid making this yet another 'today I did this, today I did that' blog, but this just has to be said:

If you ever, ever, ever get the chance, never, ever, ever mix beer with vodka.

I know this would seem to be obvious, but its a serious point.

No matter how drunk I get in the future, I will never do this again

Urgh
