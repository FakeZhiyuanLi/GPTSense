       So apparently I'm officially ready to go to Africa.&nbsp; I just have to sit and wait for my assignment.&nbsp; However, knowing that I will probably be leaving in like a little over a month has created a wave of skepticism by some people closest to me.&nbsp; This is doing me no good.&nbsp; "Yes I know it will be relatively hotter there and there is no air conditioning" and "Yes, there probably will be large bugs."&nbsp; But I am aware of these changes.&nbsp; It is much harder to rough it when you don't have too.&nbsp; When you are placed in the situation you deal with it.&nbsp; It is really that simple.&nbsp; I'm not saying it will be easy or fun all the time but I am prepared to deal with it then, not now.&nbsp; Now I will like to stay in my air conditioned house and eat lots of rocket pops.&nbsp; In other news, 6th graders suck!&nbsp; I substitute taught for a bad group of sixth graders that immediately placed me in the category of dumb surfer girl and I had to have the librarian down the hall come in to yell at them.&nbsp; I had absolutely no control.&nbsp; I was a very sad girl and wil be turning down all middle school substitute positions in the future.

        I can't find my passport.&nbsp; I had to pack up all my stuff when I left San Diego and I have no clue where I put my passport.&nbsp; It is so frustrating to know that I am going to have to go get another passport rushed so I have it before I leave the country in September. &nbsp; Like 4 years ago I lost my Social Security card so I had to go get a new one...I found it when I was moving along with a Drivers License I thought I had lost too.&nbsp; I'm a mess!&nbsp; I wish I had some sort of organizational skills.

      After 15 weeks of waiting to hear from the Peace Corps (they said it normally takes 4-6 weeks....um, yah, whatever) they finally fedex'ed me a letter yesterday that stated I need to give them more information about my medical health.  For the record, I have never had any medical problems except for a knee surgery and appendicitis.  However, is it really necessary to have an ultrasound done on my thyroid glands? I tend to think no on this.  So off I will trot to the doctor's office to have him write on a sheet of paper, "Amber's thyroid is normal."  This sheet of paper will get me my medical clearance.  Please doctor...tell me my thyroid is normal!

      I love fairy tales.  I love that in the end everyone is happy, things are amazing and the girl always gets the cute guy.  Very unrealistic yet so believable in my dreams.  However, it is already known I do not, nor will not, ever live in a fairy tale.   All I want is some sort of idea as to what I'm really doing with my life.  Even though I'm going to the Peace Corps, it is only for 2 years.  What happens after that?  I change my mind more than I change outfits in the morning trying to decide what the best fit is for me.  I don't fit in to just one thing, I need lots of options and I don't even know where to begin.  Expectations are high for the future and I don't think I want it.  I just want to chill and be happy.  That's all.

      So I recently entered another dimension of reality.  Sometimes I think I do things just so I can tell great stories later.  Substitute teaching has not been working for me lately so I thought, "I'll just work at the restaurant I used to work at six years ago"....It was a good idea until I remember how much I hate to work with the general public when they're hungry.  People are vicious carnivores, just another reason to want to be a vegetarian....between meat and tomatoes, people are mean.  Anyone who knows me knows I cannot stand tomatoes for the fact that they make people angry.  So anyways, being as I wasn't digging the restaurant job and I live in a farm community, the next best option was working at a tomato packing company.  So now I am working in a laboratory testing tomatoes for quality purposes.  And I have to wear jeans, yet another thing I am not partial to doing.  I don't wear jeans, ever....I am so out of my element that I don't really know where I am.  Yes, that art degree is really paying off!
