      grabe, ang lungkot-lungkot talaga ng feeling ko ngayon.  di na ito dala ng weather ngayon dahil masarap ang simoy ng hangin ngayon.  it's me talaga.  ang liit talaga ng tingin ko sa sarili ko.  feel ko talaga nobody loves me.  or rather everybody takes me for granted.  alam mo yun, it is as if you didn't matter.  whether you live or die, it doesn't matter.  sure madaling sabihin na i would live my life so that it matters; so that when i die everyone around me is crying.  but living it is something else.  it's easy when things go your way.  it's so damn hard when you're in the gutter, struggling to get out.  and the worse part is that there is no one to help you out.  ikaw lang ang hihila sa sarili mo paakyat.  if you can't, then there's the cutter on the table ready to be used.  grabe, ang lungkot-lungkot talaga ng feeling ko.  i feel so alone.  the people i go to for help don't seem to realize that i'm here drowning already.  my head's barely above the water.  my feet are stuck.  and i'm slowly sinking.  siguro isa rin yan sa mga wrong reasons why people go out and just hook up with somebody who shows the slightest sign of care.  naiintindihan ko ang mga tao na yun dahil i've been that person many times in my life.  i can empathize with him/her.  putang-ina, ang hirap talaga.  so sa mga kaibigan kong pineste ko sa frequent text o pagkamusta o pangungulit, pagpasensyahan nyo na ako.  gusto ko lang naman ipakita na mahalaga kayo sa buhay ko.  at sana'y bigyan nyo rin sana ako ng senyas na kahit papaano, may konting halaga rin ako sa buhay nyo.  yun lang naman po.

      there are some days that are just too wierd, even for me.  kaninang umaga, i felt as if i was on top of things - handle ko ang lahat ng bagay, alam ko ang nangyayari.  i felt that i was ready to take on anything.  but then the afternoon came and all that energy just faded away.  feeling ko para akong na-drain intellectually, emotionally, psychologically, and all -ally things that there are.    i feel so fucked up, di ko feel magtrabaho.  feel kong ibato na lang ang lahat and just go home.  putang-ina, talk about being fucked up with work.  di na ito dala ng weather this time.  probably, dala ito ng mga people around me that i meet.  wala akong maasahan sa kanila.  or then again, it could just be me.

         today is the last time i would get to see a co-worker of mine.  and for that occassion, i did a good deed for her - i brought her out of school, during school hours, despite my meeting-packed hectic schedule today, without asking permission or approval from any authority, just so that she can go to the briefing that she would need for tomorrow.  bukas na kasi ang lipad nya eh.  she's bound for Katar and she plans to work there for two years.  so in effect, today would be the last time i get to see her.  ewan ko ba what came over me to do such a stupid act.  it's something like texting someone the whole lyrics of a song just because she needed to sing it.  sigh. the stupid things i do just because i care.  minsan nga feeling ko na nililigawan ko na ang babae without intending to dahil masyadong caring ang dating ko.  but then again, this was THE LAST.  just like another co-worker that abruptly left recently.       even though medyo di kami on good terms (syempre sasabihin ko fault nya yun), i had to find the guts to make-up with her and to get across that i care for her.    medyo mushy nga ang dating para sa akin eh pero she didn't find it so.  i guess i'm not really that used to showing my feelings kaya any miniscule ooey-gooey feeling that i show i already consider to be mushy.  ewan ko ba.  i'm trying to uncover all of my hang-ups pa eh.  and trying to learn in the process.

         have you ever had the feeling of wanting to know a person, yet unable to do so? when something in you knows that there is potential in having a relationship with the other person deeper than the superficial.  and i'm not even talking about a relationship in the romantic sense.   wala lang. friends lang.  ever had that feeling? bad trip ano? yung tipong nasasayangan ka dahil there is no situation that presents itself; no situation where you can get to know the other person more. feels like you're caught in the middle, unable to go either way.  madalas mangyari sa akin ito. ewan ko ba. minamalas lang siguro ako. or then again the excuse i give myself is that ganyan lang talaga ang buhay - mapaglaro.  no wonder madalas angsty ako.

      I was supposed to go to the wake of a friend today. Her Dad died and i feel for her.  But then, it rained. And you know how I am when the weather's a bit cloudy.  Di na lang ako pumunta. It would've been pointless kasi, I think. You go to a wake to comfort somebody, not to find someone who will give you comfort.  I'm now feeling moody and a bit crazy. Medyo buong araw ko na rin kasi nilalanghap ang singaw ng pintura sa aming kwarto eh.  We painted our office today.  Kinda rad since no else followed suit.  Fuck them if they just go baaa with the herd.  The bad thing lang nga is that I've been in this stinking room for the whole day.  These fumes, it does things to a man's brain. It's 6:30 PM and we're supposed to be off by 3:30.  Medyo nagsi-sing along na lang ako ngayon sa YM Radio.  Hope I don't distract the priests from their holy prayers.  Moody and crazy...not a good combination...make a note...

      The last two nights have been the craziest. Sobrang bilis ng mga pangyayari di ko na alam; di ko na siguro alam kung nasasaan na ako. I feel as if I was swept by the hurricane of events.  I have been going out with a female colleague of mine for some few weeks now. We've been eating out, watching movies together, taking walks, bumming for hours, and yes Unitmates, we've also been going to masses together.Ãœ  Medyo reserved ang relationship and treatment namin towards each other. Nothing sweet. Fun and tripping friends lang ang usual treatment namin sa isa't-isa. She'd text, I'd text, we'd have fun, trippings lang. And I was ok with that.  But in the last two nights, nagbago ang relationship namin. Maihahambing ko sya sa isang pumutok na bote ng Coke, na matagal nang iniyuyugyog. Everything seemed to change in the last two nights. And we've been doing stupid and crazy things because of that. Hehe, naki-extra pa nga ang ilang mga baranggay tanod eh...  Ewan ko ba kung sino nagpasimulang bumago. I would say that she started it, but of course I cannot say na wala akong sala dahil I'm positive that though not meant, I sent signals which leaned towards that direction. It's the third day since this all began and I still don't know where to place myself.  Di ko nga alam kung ano ang iisipin ko sa sarili ko eh. Am I just a really friendly person na under sa mga babae kaya madalas nagagamit? Or am I just an insensitive guy who uses people for my own satisfaction?  I'm starting to doubt myself and my principles.    NOTE: Just to answer a comment that was posted by an annonymous person, I'd like to clarify that despite what you think, I do not post pictures of women close to me to serve as 'trophies'. I post them because this blog is one of the few venues where I will open myself and admit to the people who have touched my life and have made a difference in it. And I just hope that when/if they see this blog, they would realize that they have made a difference in the life of my person.

      It's really amazing how the relationship between two people could blossom so fast in one night.  Teka, I don't think 'amazing' is the right adjective to describe what happened last night.&nbsp; 'Precipitous' would be a more apt description.&nbsp; Cuz last night, the relationship between me and a close female friend of mine went beyond the common 'friend' level.  It wasn't planned, it wasn't choreographed.&nbsp; It wasn't manufactured.  It just happened.  As to WHAT exactly happened, I'll just keep it to myself.&nbsp; That information involves something more than me so I'm not free to post that here.&nbsp; Syempre kung ako lang yun, it would be a different matter.  Let me just say that it started with me inviting her out to dinner and ended with us bumming in my car by a road near Xavier.&nbsp; Yun na yun.  Grabe nga eh.&nbsp; Until now 8 hours and a sleep after, I'm still in a shell-shocked mode.&nbsp; May mass kami ngayon pero nothing registers.&nbsp; Di naman dahil that is the first time I've went out with a girl (fyi: it's not).&nbsp; But I really can't believe that happened to us.  Lagi na lang sumusulpot sa vocabulary ko ngayon the words:&nbsp; 'an unlikely pair'.  But I know that I have to stop it from progressing.&nbsp; Hindi kasi mangyayari na maging Kami eh.&nbsp; I don't want to drag her into an emotional rollercoaster just for my sake.&nbsp; Ayaw ko syang masaktan.&nbsp; I care about her that much.  Pasensya na rin pag walang photo.&nbsp; Promise I'll post it here someday (if I can get one that is).

       pucha! leche talaga ang araw na ito!   i really HATE MY JOB!!!   i hate dealing with people who don't give you the time of day!   i hate dealing with people who are so full of themselves that you have to repeat things for them, things that  THEY NEED , at their own convenience!   i hate being asked to prepare for something for someone else and then they leave you hanging once you are not needed anymore!    PUTANG-INA!!&nbsp; I REALLY HATE ASSHOLES LIKE THAT!!!      siguro this must be the reason why i find it hard to depend on others -- di maaasahan ang ibang tao.&nbsp; wala pa akong naka-trabahong tao na maaasahan ko ng lubusan.   kakatapos lang ng freshmen welcoming event Welcome Xiao Di namin which is something like the ORSEM of ADMU.&nbsp; it was a whole day event that involves a lot of logistical and political bullshit.&nbsp; NAAASAR AKO SA RED TAPE!!&nbsp; too many people feel that their approval is desperately needed to forward an event that doesn't involve them&nbsp;the slightest.   tang-ina talaga.&nbsp; sobrang pissed off talaga ako today.&nbsp; i had to walk and do tai-chi sa open air and grassy football field namin.&nbsp; it didn't matter if somebody saw me.&nbsp;   fuck them.&nbsp; i don't give a shit about them.

      i was supposed to join my family in a gathering yesterday.  something we've always done since time immemorial.  but instead of going to another senseless family gathering where all i can expect is to be criticised by my various relatives, i spent the time trying to understand a friend - a new friend yet again...  we spent most of the day together - had a healthy jog (actually it was more of a walk pero di ko na sya hiritan Ãœ) at UP in the morning, watched a new flick at Centerpoint ( WARNING: WATCH A MOVIE AT CENTERPOINT ONLY IF YOU HAVE A STRONG STOMACH.) , and went to Intramuros to watch the night sky.  interesting nga eh this day.  it wasn't as good as i thought it could be, but it wasn't a disaster either.  this day, i was able to see more of my friend, know more of her, understand her better.  of course i won't say that all went well.  in fact, there is still that vocabulary incompatibility that constantly got in the way.  yung tipong it really takes an effort to get things across.  ewan ko ba.  i'm just glad that there is an effort from both our ends to try to find a solution to it.  unlike a previous sad experience of mine before...  we had a meaningful time yesterday.  a day worth living.

      You know, I've just discovered something about myself I'm not really proud of. Di ko kayang pumasok sa isang BF-GF relationship.  Ewan ko ba kung ano ang dahilan kung bakit ako ganito.  Am I afraid of what it entails? Am I ashamed to admit to the world that I am in a relationship like that? Am I too perfectionist that I believe that my first will be my last? Or that there is that ONE AND ONLY person that is RIGHT for me? Don't I love the other person enough?  But last night, while I was talking with a close female colleague from GS, I was suddenly faced with the option to take our relationship to the next level.  And being the chicken-hearted asshole that I am, I didn't take it.  I've hurt her in the process.  I've hurt us both in the process.  Last night was a really sad night for me. Until now, di pa rin ako makatawa.  Have I really fallen for this girl? Or am I just falling because she has already fallen? Di rin naman yata tama yun kung ganun.  Is there something there? Or is it merely something physical and coincidental?   tangina talaga...
