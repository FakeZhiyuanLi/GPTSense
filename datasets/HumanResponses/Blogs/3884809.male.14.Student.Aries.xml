      i joined a site where you get to role-play as a a student of Hogwarts. You get top attend classes with all the other ppl on the site, and by ur participation you advance through the years and meet more and more ppl and learn more and more things. well i registered and began to make my character when i had to go. so i went back on the next day and it was down. so i treid again the next day, it was down, so i tried again today, and it had an announcement. turns out the hosting server took the creators money and ran off. so now there is a crisis. the database may be lost along with everyones characters. this can be a good thing and a bad thing. the good is i will have a chance to gow and advance with EVERYONE. the bad thing is many ppl were about to graduate and had over 1000 posts. but we'll see what happens

      Breathe in for luck, breathe in so deep This air is blessed, you share with me This night is wild, so calm and dull These hearts they race from self-control Your legs are smooth as they graze mine We're doing fine, we're doing nothing at all.  My hopes are so high that your kiss might kill me So won't you kill me, so I die happy My heart is yours, to fill or burst to break or bury, or wear as jewelry Whichever you prefer  The words are hushed, let's not get busted, Just lay entwined here undiscovered. Safe in here from all the stupid questions.. "hey did you get some?" Man, that is so dumb. Stay quiet, stay near, stay close they can't hear, so we can get some.  My hopes are so high that your kiss might kill me So won't you kill me, so I die happy My heart is yours, to fill or burst To break or bury, or wear as jewelry Whichever you prefer  Hands down, this is the best day I can ever remember I'll always remember the sound of the stereo,  The dim of the soft lights, the scent of your hair That you twirled in your fingers And the time on the clock when we realized it's so late And this walk that we shared together The streets were wet and the gate was locked So I jumped it, and let you in And you stood at your door with your hands on my waist And you kissed me like you meant it And I knew that you meant it That you meant it, that you meant it And I knew that you meant it, that you meant it.   ~"Hands Down" by Dashboard Confessional

       If only you knew what i felt when i am w/o you. if only you knew what i feel when i see you, when you smile, and when you laugh. if you knew then there'd be no point in writing this. but only one word can express this feeling i get upon seeing you, just seeing you. and that word is Wholeness. yes the emptyness in my heart would again be filled and the rip would be healed. the wounds patched and the broken repaired. it would weigh less and i could again mean it when i smile or laugh. you potray such an aura that i am just astounded by it. you truly are awesome.
