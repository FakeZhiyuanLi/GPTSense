      55.5kg-Damn weight due to fat enriched food, no of dreams-8, no of whines from G-3, no of "huh"s from Van, ally in 1609-3      Last night was very funny. I spoke to G and finally i got to talk to Emmy(i'm a big fan of her work). :) I made deals with Emmy and talked sum more to G n Van, who  were very suspicious of the sly looks Emmy gave them. Not telling what i said. :) They'll find out soon enuf. If u hear shrill screams or loud moans, its them. Hehehe. All the way from KL. Van n G need a new bucket. Lol. I didnt know that the girls in KL were so 'active'. Wish they had an active webcam so that i could watch their antics. Whee!     Well, i am in a dilemma. Should i go to a. Vancouver, canada b.Melbourne,OZ or Dunedin,NZ. I dont wanna go to KL. Seriously, i had this nightmare about my parents who wanted to send me to MRSM or was it MARA? I need to go str8 after SPM. No break 4 me lor. :( Beats lolling n worrying 4 results tho. Well, theres the option of going to Taylors, where the 'Charmed' ones are, but i bet their season there will end when i arrive. So sad hor?     Anyway, i read Tangs blog. Didnt know he had a bro. God rest his soul. Including the ones who died in the heli crash. Joyce, our prayers r with u guys. When i went to PBK on thursday, the fat malay woman(Marcus n I call her Cik Lemak) belched a lot during class. So gross. Can smell a smorgasbord of Malay dishes from her mouth all the way from my seat. Bleks. She tried to constrain it, but it came out anyway. Well, i might consider myself lucky. Imagine if the gas came out from down under. *vomit*     I just found out Mdm. Lyes christian name. It rhymes with her chinese name. Can anyone guess it? Its quite unexpected. Its from the new testament, she says. Hmm. I wonder what other name i can dig out from ppl. "fabian" Toh Shengwei is unexpected. He doesnt look like a fabian to me. Hahaha. Theodore toh. Teddy bear. :P     My cough is almost over *Thank GOd*. Sad also la. My patogens arent strong enuf to make ppl sick (except kenneth, and i'm not sure if i gave mine to him).

      55kg-Brilliant, cough count-56(hurrah!), farts smelt in school-5, variations in fart aroma-0      Well, today was a very interesting day. We had history today. Perhaps the flu affected my thinking skills, as the teacher looked at me rather dubiously as i searched for a seemingly non-existant answer which was staring me right in the face. Perhaps weight lost was brain. Hmm. Must gain weight.     Bm was the usual:Nothing. Asked teacher for a clear definition of bribery and she took 5 minutes "er....emmm....mungkin....." Hahaha. Anyway, i chatted to aloy again about where to go. I wanna go Vancouver. :)     Chem was okla. Copy answers for exams again. So bloody long. Argh. Goh wore her zebra outfit today. Lol. Voon came sashaying in her 'Royal Funeral' outfit, a blood red 2 piece dress with may flowers. Not bad for sum1 who just gave birth.  11.30am-English. We waited for Teresa Mok 11.35am-Still waiting, smiling, thinking that she must be late. Expect her to come waltzing in soon 11.40am-Still not here. Oh shit. Pn Fatimah is looking at our class. Quickly hush the class up (Gerald! Shut up!) 11.50am-Searching for teresa mok with marcus. We find her in the reasource room. She give this look of real dread when the door opened. "why must you haunt me?" The publisher of the mag looked on rather suspiciously at us, as if we were police people in for a raid. 12.00-Trying to open language room door. Without success. Pn. Nora gave us her keys (she was in the next class) and it was so easy. One click n we were in. Bloody,bloody,bloody. Imagine if we couldnt open the door:1st denial.Imagine of teresa mok was in class:2nd denial. Imagine if the key broke:The ultimate denial! We played some variation of scrabble marcus taught us. It was very fun. I lost terribly as ppl kept stealing my words. I am nice so i dun really steal. Mother teresa comes in. "Whats this?" she says, eyes wide open, expecting a game of obscene scrabble. 1pm:Mother teresa talks to me bout her shoes-the poiny brown ones. Hmm. If the had those elf shoes+a red beret+a red suit=Santas helper. I suggested this idea, and she nearly choked on her coffee. :)  9sumthing pm Brendan chin told me that they found the missing heli with 5 bodies. So sad. 2 are missing. Maybe they were looking 4 help. Hopefully they'll be found alive sumwhere,weak but safe. Dards worried. Dont blame him.

Total shock 0623:Out of shower 0633:Dressed 0645:Packed n ready to go after chowing down breakfast of a hot dog (yes....unusual)  Decided that 30 mins between waking up and getting dressed is simply too long. Must do smth bout it tomorrow.  0710: Singing school rally. Highly unusual, this being tuesday, and we usually sing our bloody long state anthem. I led prayers, welcoming back our soldiers(prefects) from the long fight against terror(students), congratulating them over their new janatorial jobs in class, upon their retirement.  0835: Doing bl;oody moral test now. I bet i'll get 35! Yay. Haha. Coughed and sneezed with Kenneth, exchanging friendly patogens.  0950:Left TYL in class, sleeping  Nothing nice happened today. Sigh. So bo-ring. I chatted with aloy, exchanging news on the simple life. :) I went had this lard smeared lunch at the school canteen. it was halal lard aka very fatty frying oil. Bleks.We had est in the very hot 5d classroom. So torturous....erkkkkkk........ Why us? I went home and met Pris there. She asked me to burn cds 4 her. Hahaha. Biasa....she waddled back to the car, the jeans so tight, she couldnt really walk properly with the h/p inside. Was very nice la. Catwalk. :)  I talked to kenneth and he said that he might have sars.

      54.5kg(Miracle-fat tablets under skin since saturday burned off already),No of panadols taken-4, no of lozenges consumed-8, No of hours in silence-5, hallucinations-uncountable      Okay....i didnt update my blog yesterday. Was too sick to type. :) Anyway, i woke up at 2.30am ,3.30am ,4.30am and 5.30 am(marvellous aye?). I had all sorts of weird dreams, including a donkey talking, flying to the moon, walking on the yellow brick road and this particularly funny one based on the sound of music, with my english teacher being fraulein teresa(lol) and mr james as captain. So funny seeing mdm mok dancing around a hill. I was pretty high, having taken an overdose of my sore throat medicine (i think?). I woke up at 0603, contemplating my attendance at school (to come or not to come....hmmmm?) then decided to spread the good word bout my virus. *wink* Anyway, i took a piss and was shocked at the colour. Bright yellow! I've never seen anything that yellow b4! And i had finished like.. a litre of water during my frequent wakes. Did my morning rituals n went to school by foot (dad went to brunei), taking my sweet time. I croaked a few words to naza and gerald, before deciding that silence was golden (everytime i tried to talk, i coughed). I then made a bet with gerald, trying to keep silent all day aka Lip leong. It was pretty good. I zombied thru bio and went to the clinic during physics. i sat cross-legged in a zen-like manner, trying to heal myself from within (didnt help much) but was pretty good (daydreamt/hallucinated sum more), listening to the 12 girls band in my head, keeping the zen presence. FYI, theyre pretty good (12 girls band). I'm listening to them right now on media player.  Try Liu San Jie (what does it mean? Anyone??), so relaxing, thats what i listened to in the clinic. I then went 4 math, which was bo-ring. Tomorrow, the prefects retire. The wave of green blazers will be gone. *sigh* And so will all the spare time. Well, the Vatican welcomes back our brave soldiers we sent on the fight against terror! I keep on dreaming abt smth. I hope its prophetic (wont tell anyone, afarid to jinx it)! Well, am ok now la. Stopped coughing (zen healing at home worked-slept too), thank God! Excuse the occasional cough la. M still half deaf from flu. Uneven ear pressure. Well, its been 14 days since the heli was lost. Well, lets all pray to the Lord for his compassion, that he may guide those lost ppl, including Joyce's dad. Go to Dards homepage 4 the prayer. :)  Quote of the day: "Heaven is an American salary, a Chinese cook, an English house, and a Japanese wife.

      56kg-HOW??????(Thank you Darald....) no of calories consumed 3000, no of calories used 500, no of panadols swallowed-5, sick scale-4       Okay...today will just be a simple post. Lol. Not feeling up 2 it. Anyway, woke up at 0750 today specially 4 marcus, to support our KSN team. Departed to school by fot and we left 4 Grand con at 0900 today. Stupid bus driver took the wrong route so we took 2ce as long to get there. No air-cond sum more *whew*. Chatted with aloy n plyed a few games on the fon while waiting 4 it to start. Dard unexpectantly called, saying that he finished his quiz and wanted to come. So i was left bruised after the 2 hr thingy, after several punches, bone-crushers and pokes at the ribs. Lol. Anyway, we won. Sam tsan n gang were quite enthusiastic to say the least, sumtimes ringing the buzzer b4 we were allowed 2. Not good. Not allowed to answer after that. But anyway, we won. Yay. Pn Jo came today, the image of post-baby freshness, clad in the green punjab dress, complete with green bindi (dot on forehead). Shes not indian or married to one, to popular belief however. Anyway, Dard n i left 15 mins early i think (skipped the meal at the hotel) to go to coffeebean. 4got to bring my card. *damn* Clad in school u, it must have looked pretty weird. I had a white choc dream and chicken pasta. Cost me 24 bucks. Lol. But was worth it la. Gained 500g becoz of that (HOW????). Darald predicted it. So, here's ur wish granted big bro! I'm fat! Was schoekd to discover nat service was compulsory my year *sob*. I felt like going off with aloy to canada and giving up my citizenship (still goin beyond expectations tho). So sad hor? Lunch was pretty good, soothing. Dard drove me back (love my generous big bro - one of 2), saving me the walk back home (what brother? he threatened me!) :P I swallowed more panadol when i arrived home. I then did sum work n went for mass. i liked one of the songs. So heres the chorus:  In the calm, of you presence, I am lis-te-ning looooorrrddd..., I am still...I am qui-et..., I am yours....  New addition to on-board mp3s (aka brain music). Have so many vids n music. Wanna delete some.  :P I added links to this page, all listed right. Visit them when u can. My granda and aunt are watching AF. I see no point in watching after my love, Edlin was kicked out *ouch*. So tired. Logging off!

      55.5kg-reasonable, no of sore throat lozenges consumed-6, no of Hail Marys said-50, alchohol units-1      I spoke to G last night. G being Gerardine Tan from st3 last yr whom i met on a business trip earlier this yr. I like her name. Geri Tan. It has a hidden meaning too. Say it fast n you'll get a word in bm. Apparently, theres this girl in g's apartment who molests girls. I got very excited(nearly dropped the phone)when G mentioned that Emmy(the toucher) would grab and apparently fondle(?) G and Vanessa ting. Vannessa, however, is the more popular victim due to her priceless reaction. Vanessa would then grab ass or a boob back, much to Emmey's chagrin. Interesting aye? Now G gets some 'fun' too. :) I suggested airing it on the webcam 4 me to c. L8er, G sms-ed me, telling me that emmy would love to do it, on account that i add her to my fwenster list and write a testi(whats so vulgar??) :P Van is the unwilling victim(shhhhh). Hahaha    I had a bit of a sore throat. I woke up at 3.30 and slept again. Then i had the most bizarre yet interesting dream i had this year. it was one of those action-comedy dreams i had, without doubt inspired by 'so close' which i watched earlier. It goes like this: I was at school with CLL, Marcus, and Aloy. We chased these 2 fat businessmen around the school and ended up at the kimia lab which looked like a cross between the chem lab and the toilet. Hmmm. Anyway, we had some GREAT CGI fights, sumthing i havent done in months. Very realistic, in manner of matrix. We floated, kicked and punched in front of Michelle Goh who complained "Not so loud!". We then had those 2 ppl hostage. It turns out it was Mr pan and some other chinese guy. We heard prefects coming and we pushed those flimsy chem carts in front of the door to 'block' it la. Stupid eh? I then took a broom and jammed the door (smart) while marcus pushed this cart full of yellow chemicals (i think its urine- i needed to piss at dreamtime, too lz to get up) and michelle goh said...."Cannot, cannot. Later the glass break afterward" in her slight accent. Marcus reluctantly pused PEKA files in front of it. Prefects were banging on the door. A hand broke through. We panicked and suddenly our hostages died (no idea how) so we ran out of the next door opposite, hoping that the prefects were dumb (they were!) and we ran outside and jumped into a lift which was just about to close, giggling away. Suddenly, we appeared in the Saberkas bus terminal (WHY?) and snuck back to this church cum cemetery. Alvin Yap (Where did he come from?) said he knew the place very well, it was just renovated. So we snuck in and we took a piss in the toilet (my body pisses in sleep apparently as a reminder) and i felt relieved (no, i didnt wet the bed). We went out and saw Mrs Pan and Kenny and a few huge prefects. We went down to the cemetery, which was next to a road. Theres this gate seperating the church from the graves. In total panic, we climbed over. It was a lil high and i didnt want to jump directly down. So i sat over the edge and dropped gracefully. :) CLL was very scared. I had to pull his porky lil legs down. We were on this road, barefoot, walking down. We tried asking for a lift to the airport. It faild. Suddenly, i saw my neighbours house (the one where the neighbours old dad died) and i went in. It was 'open air', no idea why. I went in and Darald was there baking brownies. He offered me one. And we all ate brownines. Its so weird. I said we were in a hurry, we killed the principal. He gave this understanding look and said "I know how u feel....Mr Lee died too". Eh? What was that? So he gacve us a ride to the airport and we bought air tickets (aloy n i bought MAS, the rest AirAsia. hahaha. Must b that R&R plan we had. And we flew off and i woke up. Who said i cant get away with murder? :)      At school, my sore throat was quite bad. I croaked the "Se-la-mat...."but was surprised at the smoothness of my voice. Hahaha. Found out that i cpuld sing slightly higher. So  i made full use of it, singing till i couldnt take the pain. We had LOM today and Bro gave more scapulars(i'm wearing mine right now). Ivy Beh looks less pleased with our class, she looks so...dead now la. Must have been dispirited after tuesday. Too bad la. Shes quite nice. Kenneth has a thing for her 36DD mammaries. :P I went home today and found my lozenges and took 3 in an hour. i then read...(  Quote of the day: Gerald..SHHHH!-Me on Geralds possessed spirit

      55.5 kg good, no of bells ringing in head- 1000 v.bad, no of punches marcus gave to shoulder- 7, Number of threats - 100, posters i love- all        I woke up at 4.40 am today (no idea why) and went back to sleep, slightly comforted by the fact that my alarm clock in my fon would wake me up at 0603. I had a very bizarre dream. Sadly, i cant remember. I woke up, all comfy, wondering why my alarm didnt wake me up. Egad! It was 0610! It failed me! I completed my morning rituals very fast. Blow-drying my hair, i discovered that the blow dryer's pins didnt fit into the plug so well. So i shoved it in. It was ok for a few mins, until i smelt the tell-tale smell of burning plastic. Panic-stricken, i looked down and saw small blue electrical sparks. *erk* I shoved too hard and the plastic cord around the pin was melting! Argh! Note to self: Get new 3 pin plug.     Breakfast today was pastry. Left for school slightly late at 0710. Mr James was slightly pissed off with the class for not praying together with me. :P Not surprising. He gave dark looks at Yik Lung & gang, scarily similar to marcus. Report cards and my indemnity form for my trip to support marcus n team for KSN are due tomorrow. Then we had english with mother teresa. We were given this passage which seem oh-so-familiar. I then remembered i did it in tuition in f3. Wow.Bio was uneventful.      Then, after break, we headed off to the dewan kuliah for a kursus. This was during math *yay*. Mr wong wasnt too happy, however at losing another 2 periods this week "They steal my students", he says. It was majorly fun. We did some matchmaking thingys....similar to that thing they advertise on astro, numerology readings. Sam Tsans compatibility with Britney spears:38% *hahahaha*. TSW and..Yin Yong:55%. Me and someone:70%! *bangga*. I then did my MAS ad with aloy with marcus as a model(very dangerous-should have brought armour).It went like this:      "Why is there a tiny lil frown on this tiny lil face?" I sad, looking at marcus' suspicious face which gave out a very loud.."EHEM!"      "Is it too bright?PErhaps i shopuld turn off the lights"-which i did in class.      "Perhaps he wants his platypus"I looked wildly for the stuffed animal i gave marcus, forgetting it was in storage. "Enough..enough", he wailed, hands waving wildly. "SHHHHHHHH!", he adds, when i try to speak. Reminds me of a ovie.       -Before you die....you see the prefect(marcus)- After u hear my ad, a very scary voice goes "Shhhhh". Eeee. I love my posters, so i have to quit. :) I seem to have forgot how dangerous marcus can be. Lol.       Add maths was good. I went home and took a nap today. I had a marvellous dream. i was on board....and suddenly i saw CLL,Yap and Sam tsan in a plane bound for china or smth. I was serving salad.... It was St Joseph Airways *wow-our flagship carrier* owned and managed by PUM la konon. They smirked and i had an urge to give them vegetarian meals, which i did. They didnt smirk anymore :) I went a few rows back and i was serving choc cake with icing. Weird eh? Darald complained (where did he come from?) that his mocha cake didnt have enough mocha. So i added coffee powder on top. And he was very happy. hahaha. Proceeded a few rows back and completed my duties. Then i had to collect the trays. There was turbulence and the plane shook slightly. I,am terrified my turbulence while standing. I have this dumb notion that the plane would drop 300 metres and my head would hit the ceiling. I gripped the seat while collecting. Then, i decided it didnt look pro so i buka kaki sikit la. CLL and gang gave back the salad bowls, saying it was very good. I waled all the way back, balancing 3 trays of half-eaten cakes. I put all the leftovers in a bowl when dudden turbulence shook and it dropped, leaving a mess on the floor. I cleaned it up with a foot towel. Bizarre eh? And looked for hand wash in the galley where my korean (why korean???) co-workers were working. It was very nice. I loved the dreeam. Ah..... I woke up once we landed.       My neighbours are chanting again! Argh. Going to go nuts. *ding* Why do they have to pray for hours? *ding* Lets see what tomorrow holds. :P  Quote of the day - "SHHHHHHHHHHH"-Marcus Lee on my ads.

      55.5 kg (yay) alchohol units 1 (disgrace-urine of satan but v. nutritious, mixed with apple juice) Periods spent in class 4, periods listening to teachers 3, total pokes at Gerald- uncountable        Today was an interesting day. Hmmm. Seem to be turning nocturnal thse days, sleeping at midnight n waking up at 5 plus in the morning (no idea), tossing and turning before waking up at 0603. I had noodles again 4 breakfast. :P Walked to school slowly today, trying to enjoy the 'scenic' view (used the police hq way), saving energy and sweat. First period today was history, a very interesting lesson about our constitution, to me, very stupid. Then, Kenneth,marcus, alvin n I went to our secret lounge for bm. *guilty* Its so good. Air-cond, scrabble....my dream room. Mother teresa came knocking on the door, giving a look of utmost shock, looking at the scabble board with a dreaded look, thinking that it might be another game of obscene scrabble. Lol. But it wasnt.       I suck at scrabble. havent played it since i was 5. Then, for english, mother teresa gave us permission to go to the Golden Lounge again. Work konon la we all. kenneth and marcus did work for a good...20 mins? Alvin and i chatted and rested in comfort, with light and easy blaring restful sounds to lull us to sleep. Anyway, i walked home again after that. :( It was ok la. So hot. hate kuching weather. Wished it was more windy. So i came home, shocked to see a entire fleet of cars around my area. Turns out that my neighbours dad died. Apparently the old chap passed away on the way to the hospital. They have been chanting for almost 3 hours now, complete with lil gongs *ting*..oo-na...wa..wee...no...ma..nee...ko..naaaa....*ting* Repeat thousand times till ur head rings. Apparently very few ppl have visited my page, but all have very nice comments. Dard (big bro) tot it was interesting, yap loved it (yay). Hmmmmm. My second cousin came to my house today. Was interesting, she brought my nephew (i'm so old!) and left me to babysit him while she ran a few errands next door (bayar cukai tanah) It all seemed fine. the baby was asleep. The second she left, the baby began to scream blue murder, writhing and crying when i tried to pick him up, like violent deportees. Janice, the slightly older sister looked up gravely from the playhouse disney programme shed been watching removed her bottle filled with OJ from her mouth. "he wants a bottle", she said. "they're in there"      Humiliated at being out-baby-sitted by someone who was not nearly 4, sure enough i found the bottle in the bag, handed it over and justin stopped crying immediately and sat there sucking, looking at me with suspicious looks, as if i was someone very nasty from school. Hmmm. Hmm... i dont think i wants kids anymore. Nuff said.    Quote of the day - "Why bite the hand that feeds you?"- Nuriya Mayot on voting

      56kg(total fat groove), calories 2100 (canteen food), calories used 500, postitive thoughts about Mr chong 0, total minutes spent daydreaming 30       Okay....alvin yap suggested that i create a blog, to release pent up anger and stress. Hmmm. Perhaps. Woke up at 0557 by my h/p but stayed lolled in bed for another 6 minutes before getting up. Had noodles for breakfast, high carb, low fat as can burn energy off. Today was very dramatic. Marcus quarreled with Mr Chong, giving him poisonous glares, very similar to Ju On. The whole class was silent as Marcus angrily clicked his pen, face so dark as though storm was brewing inside. Hmmm... i wonder if we'll get more drama next time. Mother Teresa didnt like my free essay. She gave this huge sigh and gave me this long suffering look, although deep inside, i knew that she was enjoying every moment. :D Spent some time today scanning pics for ad astra. Well worth it as got honoured in the penghargaan part. Yay. Without donating money! Anyway, turns out i have to go attend marcus' KSN thingy at GC, KCh. Y not hilton i ask??? Grand continental has nth nice nearby, unless you're hindu, then u can go pray at the nearby temple. Hmmm...hmmm. Maybe should start new holy order in manner of St Francis. the whole world is helping the poor these days. No one helps the rich. Hmmm....hmm...perhaps can start this revolutionary order with priests and brothers helping the rich find their soul. I did, in fact convert the evil gerrald to my path of light. Hmmm.... More tomorrow.

      57kg-Damn Haagen Daz!, days left to trial exams 28, days left to live-28, things to study-Plenty        Yay. I have control of the comp again. My sister just left this morn and after near monopoly of the comp, i am back. *cheer* Well, theres a lot to write, but i'll squash it in. :P First of all, Mdm Lye's christian name. Anyone guessed it? Its Marianne. Marianne Lye. Hmmm. WHo would have thought. I like the name. Very Maria Von Trap-ish. can picture her singing n the fields in manner of Julie Andrews.      I finally have Emmy's number. *Grin* Loads of fun to be planned with her. I found out all sorts of interesting things like 36A, C, purple from G. It was a lot of fun and i slept well after hearing that. We had day of prayer this week. Mr TOh blasted us for not keeping quiet. We were singing for God's sake. Well, if the YCS ppl had planned properly for the P&W session, it wouldnt have happened. They werent too familiar with the tune of the song. Oh,well. This was my final DOP and i led the rosary again with the rest of the team for the last time. I read too fast, according to Marcus. I went back, red faced and was amused to hear Aloy praying even faster. "hailMaryFullofgracethelordiswithyou" I stifled a giggle. Geralds one was even funnier. He mispronounced most of the words. Gerard's one was ok. Except for the part of "with". It didnt come out that clear. Then Marcus read. Slowly. Not too slow. It was a lil soft. He had a slight problem with being a bit far from the mike. Pn Stella was delighted at hearing my voice on the mike again. She fondly remembers our former practice days where i would sing hymns during my presentation. :P      Hmmm. I love Haagen Daz. Although it made me fat. But its real good. *Yum* Pure choc ice cream. Too bad it costs RM27 a tub. :(  Quote of the day:"Whenever I watch TV and see those poor starving kids all over the world, I can't help but cry.
