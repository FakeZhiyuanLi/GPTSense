       The Muller Theory of Teenage Female Classification: A Basic Summary  By Davy Muller  NOTE FROM THE AUTHOR: This theory is inherently gender-biased and subjective. I realize all of this. My classification of females is not meant to imply any notions of gender supremacy, because teenage males are just as bad. When I come up with a male classification system, you'll all be the first to know. Thanks goes out to the several psychologists / theorists who have helped develop parts of the theory, all of which was customized for my own purposes.  ALPHA GIRLS: - Unabashingly pro-society, usually regardless of context     - To that end, support "fads", peer pressure, etc. - However, they will almost always be the friendly ones who will care about people. - Often strongly competitive, sometimes called "queen bees" - Examples: Most cheerleaders, "activities people" or Claire from "The Breakfast Club"  BETA GIRLS: - Unabashingly anti-society, usually regardless of context     - It could be argued that so many people have turned to this group that it is, in effect, a new society unto itself. I will refer to it as the "Hot Topic" society. - However, they will take things with "a grain of salt", remain opinionated and smart - Hyperjudgmental of those who support society - Examples: "Goths", the occasional outspoken high school "poets",  or Allison from "The Breakfast Club"  GAMMA GIRLS: - Make very little known about themselves, possibly passive agressive - However,  they are the least likely to be upsetting and are usually very deep once you get to meet them. - Definately the smallest group - Examples: The "quiet ones"  Obviously, it is best to be somewhere in the middle of all of these classifications. This theory will be a constant reference point, due to my incessant need to label people.

      For the two or three sane people who have yet to see "The Breakfast Club", you really should. That being said, "Hughesian Observations" and "CarlTheJanitor" are both very easy references to make from that movie, and I realize it, but hopefully,  it gives you an idea where precisely I'm coming from. My name is Davy.  But not really. I created a pen name, a new town name, new names for those involved, the whole bit to protect the innocent.  If only because most of the time, they really aren't. If you're reading this, either you happened upon it, or I deemed you harmless enough to be able to view its contents without castrating me. The real fun starts here pretty soon when I return to school and hijinks/antics/what the fuck moments insue. I'll be posting some lovely material before that so you understand how I alternate between being cynical and idealistic at the same time.  In the mean time, I hope you return and experience the bloody pain that is an American high school.   You guys think I'm just some untouchable peasant? Peon? Huh? Maybe so, but following a broom around after shitheads like you for the past eight years I've learned a couple of things...I look through your letters, I look through your lockers...I listen to your conversations, you don't know thatbut I do...I am the eyes and ears of this institution my friends.
