      Just a warning.   A mixture of the following products in a bathing/grooming situation culminates in an (apparently) unpleasant result:  Zest "Spring Blast" soap, Suave Naturals "Ocean Breeze" shampoo, Colgate "Aloe" shaving cream, AXE "Phoenix" deodorant, and Curve cologne.  I originally went with option #4 last night, but boredom and an itch to get out of the house led to option #3.    At the bar, before the place got packed and wild, I made friends (due to my basket of fries) with an "older woman" (maybe late 20s) named Jackie.  We made small talk until her friend returned from the bathroom.  Her friend sat down behind me, and without even a "hello," proceeded to wrinkle her nose and tell me, "you smell like  weed , boy."  WTF??  (I do hereby solemnly swear that I've never engaged in illegal drug use of any kind.  I don't even take whole doses of over-the-counter or prescription medication.)

      From the Junk E-Mail file... 7-30-04    FROM:  Wowoffers     SUBJECT:  Eliminate your bills the Christian way     MESSAGE:  Eliminate up to 70% of your debt the at   urlLink  ChirstianDebtRemovers.org   , debt elimination based on Christian principles.   I've prayed and prayed for a lottery score or computer error that would aid me in the polishing of my abysmal credit report, but He hasn't blessed me with those just yet. What exactly  is  the   Christian way of getting out of debt? Stapling gospel tracts to my payment checks?  I had to click. I had to know.  The Christian way is apparently not much different than "the worldly" way. This group's philosophy (paraphrased): join our service (for free), and we'll help you arrange payments and save a little cash in the process. We just recommend that you pray, etc. to help control your spending and make your payments on time. And we're a non-profit organization because charity is Christian, right?  Haha.   "A majority of churches in the U.S. are struggling financially because their members are struggling financially. Titheing (giving the church 10% of your income each week or month) is done by approximately only 20% of a church's members."  Pretty slick... get us out of debt so we can get  them  out of debt... To them I quote themselves:   "Learn to Trust God - God knows what you need, and the things you want, before you ask. Begin to trust Him for the things you need but can’t afford - He will provide. Understand that God will always give you what you need if you believe in Him. Make all financial decisions based on the principles of God’s Word, not the "wisdom" of the world."   And while you're at it, pray for the proofreaders of your spam. WWJD if He saw that typo? John 11:35!!

      Friday afternoon, and once again I have no plans for the evening.  At the beginning of the week, I had high aspirations. Two new movies out this weekend that I really want to see ( The Village  and  Harold and Kumar Go To White Castle )... plans with my cohorts to go out and do charity work (support single moms/donate to young women's college funds) at a burlesque establishment... work on population control with brain cells...  The cohorts have bailed on me, one by one, which is getting to be an inevitable sort of occurrence. We go from all-charged-up and primal in our impending quest for titties and beer at mid-week, to unpassionate and all responsible-like just hours before departure on the weekend.  Well ,  never  we  as a whole, just enough  we  to cancel/postpone the outing and leave the one or two still-motivated in a disappointed funk. And then by some odd biorhythm, this week's disappointed parties always become the following week's wishy-washy contingent, and the vicious cycle continues to turn.  My options for tonight:   --Go through with the revised plan, which consists of fast food/movie with the guys.  PROS: Movie I want to see, dinner I don't have to cook, both of which are relatively cheap. It's with the guys, and we have fun. CONS: Lacks titties and beer. No heavy petting option with guys in theater (which, even if offered, would suck really bad). Compromising enables/encourages future wishy-washiness.   --Go through with original plan, sans the guys  PROS: Titties and beer. A good sense of self-worth through charity work. CONS: Loser-factor of by-myself at hooter bar is off the charts. Will spend inordinate amounts of money I shouldn't be spending in the first place (even though it  is  for a good cause). Most of the fun is in the (absent) company.   --Go to a regular weekend hangout, sans the guys   PROS: Beer. Always see people I know that I can attach myself to. Female interaction is possible. Worked in the past. Would not have to babysit sloppy-drunk cohorts. CONS: People I can attach myself to are not guaranteed. Loser-factor of by-myself at a regular bar is still fairly high. Female interaction, while possible, is not probable. Driving home without judicial-branch-connected cohort may prove disastrous (even though my intoxication would be below the legal limit, it still makes me antsy). Most of the fun is in the (absent) sloppy-drunk company.  -- Go nowhere; sit on ass at home  PROS: Do this every other damn night of the week, what's one more? Laundry to do. School-year preparation to begin. Won't spend any money. Won't do things I shouldn't (titties and beer). CONS: See PROS.  Conclusion: I need a girlfriend.

      My mother is a reality television addict and proud of it.&nbsp; Every night.&nbsp; No sitcoms, no dramas, no movies-of-the-week.&nbsp; It's  The Bachelor, For Love or Money ,  The Amazing Race ,  Fear Factor ,  American Idol ,  Nashville Star ,  Average Joe ,  Temptation Island.&nbsp;  She even&nbsp;watched (and enjoyed)  The Swan .&nbsp; I will confess to my own love for  Survivor .&nbsp; The rest, I could do without.   Regardless of my distaste, I end up catching bits and pieces of the various programs when I venture upstairs from the dungeon for my evening feeding.&nbsp; Tonight, while waiting for my pizza rolls to bake,  Big Brother 5  was my entertainment.&nbsp;  BB5  was also on the other night&nbsp;while my fish sticks were in the oven.&nbsp;&nbsp;   I've never seen much of any of the  Big Brother  seasons.&nbsp; I still don't quite grasp how the game works.&nbsp; Seems like "don't vote me out of the cushy house," as opposed to "don't vote me off the island."&nbsp; Whatever.&nbsp; Could care less.   What has floored me in the parts of the two episodes I've seen&nbsp;from this season is a "house guest"/contestant named  urlLink Scott .&nbsp; Scott's a sales representative from Pittsburgh, PA.&nbsp; Scott&nbsp;personifies what is wrong with America.   Scott&nbsp;is male.&nbsp; Scott is&nbsp;young.&nbsp; Scott is tan.&nbsp; Scott&nbsp;is well-muscled.&nbsp; Scott&nbsp;has spiky&nbsp;hair always tied in a colorful bandanna.&nbsp; Scott has a tribal tattoo on his arm.&nbsp; Scott wears Abercrombie.   On Saturday night, the house guests had to find letters in a pool of tomato soup and use them to spell the names of food items.&nbsp; They would then receive the spelled food items for their weekly rations (or something like that).&nbsp; Scott apparently had a craving for C-H-E-E-S-S-E.&nbsp; Mmmm... cheesse.   Tonight, the house guests played an "am I bluffing or not" game.&nbsp; Each person would read a question, then give an answer to that question.&nbsp; The other players had to decide if the speaker was giving a truthful answer (that matched an interview from before the game), or if the speaker was giving a false answer.&nbsp; One guy's question: "Who is the one person that I've always been able to confide in?"&nbsp; His answer: my stepfather.&nbsp; Scott was pissed at the question: "I had no idea.&nbsp; I didn't even know what 'confide' means!"   Scott is a RETARD.   Scott is on national television&nbsp;competing for $500,000.&nbsp; Scott probably gets laid quite a bit back home.   I am bitter.   &nbsp;   &nbsp;

      My local newspaper is a joke.&nbsp; The North Koreans or bin Laden's crew or whoever could have just leveled half of D.C. with a "dirty" ICBM, but the top story in the   urlLink Cumberland Times-News   the next morning would be the city garbage man that just retired after fifty years of faithful trash slingin' ("Capitol Cremated" see page 7A).   From the Monday, July 26, 2004 edition, front page...    Top Story :&nbsp;  Woman finds new life after stroke   Article talks about an elderly lady who has devoted her life to quilt-making and chairs a variety of area craft shows.&nbsp; Quote from the stroked: "I'm a recovering stroke patient; I had a massive stroke in 1986."&nbsp; There's a nice picture (above the fold, four columns wide) of the lady mid-quilt.&nbsp; Article is continued on page 9A.   Hooray for the survivors!&nbsp; I'm sure glad she's happy and busy, and well, alive, but do I really care to read about her renewed exploits... 18 years after the fact?&nbsp; Oh, and on page 9A, five column inches above the remaining few thousands words of&nbsp;a quilter's odyssey : Flood waters threaten capital in Bangladesh.&nbsp; &nbsp;     Top story (below the fold): &nbsp;  GRASS ATTACK: Lawnmowing ongoing summer process   Article opens with a quote from F. Scott Fitzgerald about nothing being more soothing than the&nbsp; quiet whir of a mower on a summer afternoon, then the lead provides an encyclopedic discourse on the mechanics and operation of a reel lawnmower.&nbsp; "Reel mowers are still available.&nbsp; Lowe's Home Improvement Center has two models, 16-inch and 18-inch, that run less than $100."&nbsp; The narrative progresses to gas-powered mowers and interviews with local owner-operators.&nbsp; One lady gushes over her mower: "I use it because it cuts better and it will cut anything.&nbsp; I've mowed rocks, roots, tree stumps and snakes."&nbsp; Article continues: "She said that she's done in at least two snakes with the mower."&nbsp; The article ends with a dissertation on today's "high-tech" mowers and how they "put the homeowner on a seat above the yard and they ride as the mower cuts the grass and bags it or mulches it, depending on your preference."   I don't think there's anything to say about that, now, is there?&nbsp; The snake mower better watch out, though.&nbsp; Last week's big&nbsp;area news was about PETA accusing the local poultry plant of chicken abuse.&nbsp;   I really hope we never actually have a slow news day around here...

      Nothing bad happened today.&nbsp; Well, nothing catastrophic.  I should never have children.&nbsp; People contemplating the children-having should first cohabitate with a sibling at least 15-20 years their junior.&nbsp; Education comes from experience, not from instruction.  When BrotherWatch is in effect, I don't parent.&nbsp; I cope.&nbsp; I survive.   Parental Decree #1:&nbsp; Little brother must sleep on the couch in&nbsp;the basement rec room (adjacent to big brother's&nbsp;living quarters)&nbsp;the night previous to a watch day.&nbsp;&nbsp;Parents fear that if little brother wakes in his&nbsp;own bed upstairs, and cannot find parents (who are both at work), little brother will panic and run outside and search the neighborhood in his jammies, resulting in&nbsp;guaranteed&nbsp;milk carton picture placement. &nbsp;   Survival Strategy #1:&nbsp; When in my downstairs domain, the normal bedtime rules no longer apply.&nbsp; The longer the child&nbsp;stays up, the longer&nbsp;the child&nbsp;sleeps in.&nbsp; Thus, the longer  I  sleep in.  Last night the turd was&nbsp;fascinated by ice cream manufacture on  Unwrapped  until the wee hours.&nbsp; Must be a genetic thing.&nbsp; To my credit, I made him shut it off when Emeril came on.&nbsp; He&nbsp;slept until 9:47am.&nbsp; I played dead when he came in and managed to&nbsp;get another hour from him when he crawled into bed beside me.   Parental Decree #2:&nbsp; Make sure little brother gets breakfast that's breakfast appropriate, lunch around noon, and dinner if we're not home by&nbsp;five. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   Survival Strategy #2:&nbsp; If strategy number one is properly executed, breakfast is unnecessary.&nbsp; We rouse at lunch.&nbsp; For lunch, "blue" is your friend.&nbsp; For dinner, stall.  The turd wanted pancakes for breakfast.&nbsp; I reminded him of the time I tried to be parental and attempted making pancakes.&nbsp; "Last time you said my pancakes were the awfullest thing you ever ate.&nbsp; And besides, it's time for lunch, not breakfast!"&nbsp;   Code blue was then in effect.&nbsp; Two choices:&nbsp; the blue box, or the blue can.&nbsp; Blue box is for when I'm motivated and craving cheese, myself.&nbsp; I  am  the Macaroni  Master .&nbsp;&nbsp;Two   years&nbsp;on my own made me a pro.&nbsp; Blue can is even better, if one can stomach the stench: Vienna Sausages (I loved 'em when I was his age... but now they make me retch).&nbsp; Today I was unmotivated, so I popped the top, drained the&nbsp;formaldehyde or whatever it is they're soaking in, and cringed in horror for the next twenty minutes while he devoured&nbsp;the whole can.&nbsp; It's not so bad&nbsp;as long as you're downwind... but&nbsp;the turd&nbsp;likes to&nbsp;suck on them and twirl them in his mouth, and that's just wrong.  The appointed dinnertime (five) rolled around, and I still wasn't particularly inspired to get culinary.&nbsp; I just kept my mouth shut and hoped for the best, but sure enough, the time was noted and I was summoned: "it's 5:16 and  you  are supposed to make somethin' to eat.&nbsp;  Mom  said."&nbsp; I ask the turd what he craves.&nbsp; "Fried b'whoa-ney sam'mich (fried bologna sandwich)."&nbsp; I reply that I have no idea&nbsp;how to&nbsp;make that.&nbsp; And remind him of the last time he wanted me to make something I didn't know how to make.&nbsp; Those awfullest pancakes ever.&nbsp;&nbsp;The&nbsp;turd is&nbsp;not phased:&nbsp; " Two  slices of b'whoa-ney, fried in the scrambled-eggs pan.&nbsp; Five minutes on.&nbsp; Each.&nbsp; Side.&nbsp; Put the bread in the toaster, the cheese on the bread, the b'whoa-ney on the cheese, and mustard.&nbsp; See?"&nbsp; I&nbsp;continue to plead&nbsp;ignorance.&nbsp; I try to paint a&nbsp;mental picture of the awfullest b'whoa-ney he's ever tasted.&nbsp; It's 5:29.&nbsp;&nbsp;I bust out the stall.&nbsp; If he would only wait just a few more minutes... Mommy would be home... and Mommy makes the  bestest  b'whoa-ney.&nbsp;&nbsp;Mommy makes her grand entrance at&nbsp;6:14.&nbsp; She's not motivated, either.&nbsp; The turd&nbsp;eats Spaghetti-O's for dinner.   &nbsp;  Parental decree #3:&nbsp;&nbsp;Keep the little&nbsp;brother entertained.&nbsp; He&nbsp;can't be left alone and unattended upstairs.&nbsp; Find something that the both of&nbsp;you can do.   Survival Strategy #3:&nbsp; Video games.&nbsp; You can never be too young.  I prepared in advance for this day.&nbsp; I rented games involving motorcycles.&nbsp; The&nbsp;turd is a motorcycle fanatic (as&nbsp;is his father and man-whore brother).&nbsp; After forcing&nbsp;him to wash his hands with soap  twice  after the&nbsp;vienna-munching&nbsp;display, we both absorbed ourselves in  Freekstyle  motocross/freestyle on the Gamecube for five straight hours.&nbsp;   BrotherWatch 7-26-04: mission accomplished.&nbsp; I survived.&nbsp;&nbsp;The turd survived.  My children (if ever I take  that  plunge) will not survive that on a daily basis.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;  &nbsp;

      Today&nbsp;is my assigned day of the week for BrotherWatch.&nbsp; Not the New Orleans man-whore younger brother, but the we-weren't-ready-for-an-empty-nest-just-yet kindergarten class of '04  way  younger brother.&nbsp;   Little background, first.  Dad's always been the breadwinner of the fam... and Mom just sort of bounces from job to job.&nbsp; After son #1 (me) and son #2 (man-whore) got old enough to "home alone" it, she went back to school and got the degree, joined the workforce, etc.&nbsp; Then the sons got old enough to "home alone" it elsewhere, so the 'rents ditched Mom's plastic clamshell of "for my health" pills (God, I&nbsp;fell for that explanation for  way&nbsp; too many years), then dropped the bombshell of "you guys are gonna be brothers again," and nine months later everyone that knew us secretly shook their heads and thought " damn , that cute little baby  had  to be a mistake."  But, the little dude wasn't a mistake, except that maybe he came out a dude instead of dudette.&nbsp; And he is now&nbsp;five and hell on wheels.&nbsp; And when he graduates from high school, I will be 36.&nbsp; And that makes me sad.&nbsp;   Mom quit her job when&nbsp;son #3&nbsp;came along, back to full-time mother/housewife mode.&nbsp; But then she got bored without work, so she&nbsp;got a part-time job.&nbsp; But then she missed her baby, so she quit.&nbsp; But then she missed her extra paycheck, so she got a job... and you get the picture.  Currently, she's employed again.&nbsp; Full-time this time.&nbsp; The turd is in school now, so working while he's being educated and tended to is justified in her mind.&nbsp;   Now, however, summer vacation is upon us.&nbsp; Normally this would equate to a letter of resignation.&nbsp; Not so.&nbsp; Luckily, loser son #1 (me) moved back in last fall because he couldn't afford his apartment.&nbsp; Luckier still, son #1 is a teacher and also has a summer vacation.&nbsp; Part of my unspoken new living arrangement agreement entails occasional charity babysitting.&nbsp; I get him at least one day each week... usually only from the waking hours until a little after noon, when Dad returns from shiftwork.&nbsp; A few hours at most.  Today, BrotherWatch will last from the waking hours until at least 6pm.  And I must mention that my little brother, while being brilliant and having the most amazing vocabulary (in a good way) that I've ever witnessed in a kid his age, should be the poster child for Ritalin?&nbsp; Of course, I've yet to convince my parents that a tranquilizer here&nbsp;and there would be in his (and our) best interest...   So... with that in mind...  something bad will most likely happen today.

       Been talking to my brother on AIM about the fling he had in New Orleans last weekend... the fling he had while I sat by the hotel room door in the hallway at 4am waiting for him to zip up or roll off or whatever else had to be accomplished...    We've been mulling the object of the conquest's proper nomenclature.&nbsp; The standard, "is she a slut, or just a chick that likes to bang (nothing wrong with that)?" debate.   Tangential epiphany I had-- where does this word "slut" originate?&nbsp; Looks like a blend word, right?   Slit = slit + rut.   Consider yourselves enlightened.

      Never fails.&nbsp; Doing late-night laps&nbsp;with the remote, and yet again,&nbsp;I stop&nbsp;to be mesmerized&nbsp;by&nbsp;conveyor belts on channel 40--&nbsp;The&nbsp;Food Network's  Unwrapped .&nbsp; Tonight, Marc Summers is educating me on how old-time kettle chips are making a (hardy-har) "cracklin' comeback."&nbsp;  I'm guessing that&nbsp;the trance-like state induced by this show is a subconscious nostalgia craving.&nbsp;&nbsp;Mister Fred Rogers was a&nbsp;boyhood hero of mine.&nbsp; I tuned in daily,&nbsp;not for&nbsp;want of "speedy deliveries" or&nbsp;trolley rides to&nbsp;poorly-voiced&nbsp;make-believe land-- but for the feeding of the fish.&nbsp; I&nbsp;had a passion for watching him feed his fish.&nbsp; Maybe because I never fed my own fish.&nbsp;   I was also a  huuuge  fan of&nbsp;Mister Rogers'&nbsp;wallmounted flatscreen television.&nbsp; He was the first, folks.&nbsp;&nbsp;It even had a screensaver, remember?&nbsp; It's a&nbsp;crappy painting&nbsp;one moment... then a swirl later, presto!&nbsp; We're&nbsp;following Fred through the Crayola factory and our&nbsp;five year-old minds are being floored by the whole process.  Age 11-- and my afterschool&nbsp;TV guilty pleasure&nbsp;is the Marc Summers' hosted  Double Dare .&nbsp; Game show... families... trivia... "physical challenges"... obstacle course!&nbsp; Moms and dads digging through giant, green-slime-filled nostrils for red flags and fabulous prizes!&nbsp;&nbsp;Loved it.  Now... if only Marc would waltz into that diner at the beginning of every show and "unwrap" his wardrobe.&nbsp;&nbsp;  And change into a hoodie and loafers.&nbsp;&nbsp;  Pervert.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;

      Two months gone already, and my total summer accomplishments equal: bupkus.  What happened to, "I wanted a job in education not only to  educate , but to use those three months of freedom each year to launch a successful (and immensely profitable) writing career?"&nbsp; Granted,&nbsp;in the past eight weeks I've logged a few thousand words on MSN messenger and&nbsp;more still on&nbsp;various retoolings of a still-fruitless Match.com profile... but that wasn't what I had in mind on career day.&nbsp;   My screen name is Krypto, and this is how I'm wasting my summer vacation.&nbsp; Or rather, this is an attempt to write things, which is not a waste, about how I waste time when I'm not writing.&nbsp; About the wasting.&nbsp; Of time.

      Approximately one year ago, I was unceremoniously dumped by my girlfriend of ten months.  The relationship was ten months old-- not the girlfriend (just because I'm friends with the Russian doesn't mean I share his tastes).  She was 19.   The circumstances of the breakup were quite odd.  She came to me after work on a Thursday night with that dreaded "I think we should date other people" line.  This was a hit-by-a-semi kind of shock.  We  always  got along great, and just two days previous, she had dragged  me  into a jewelry store to look at diamond engagement rings.  Her supposed reasons for the separation (besides wet panties over her bagger-boy coworker) at the time:  --I was too much of a "father figure" to her-- I tried to take care of her too much, and she needed to learn that responsibility on her own. --She wanted to be independent in her youth and "find herself" at college; wasn't ready for our level of commitment. --I was too introverted and sedentary; when I would rather sit around the house, she would rather be out partying and dancing. --After the breakup, she referred to me as "Father Time" to her friends, presumably because I'm five years her senior (age difference was apparently a problem for her).  Let's fast forward to the present.  In the past twelve months, Miss Heartbreaker's exploits:  --Immediately entered three-month relationship with aforementioned bagger-boy.  When I say "immediately," I mean, "the day after the breakup when I returned her stuff he was at her house."  He lived with his pothead brother, taught her how to smoke, and cheated on her with his ex-girlfriend (for the whole three months). --Dropped out of college after one half of one semester.  So much for learning responsibility. So much for learning much of anything, really. --Tattooed her ankle.  Pierced her nose.   Those are the relatively tame newsbites.  Then there's the doozie I heard last week.  --Just moved in with her new boyfriend. Her new boyfriend's name is Rick. Rick is her supervisor at work. Rick is 35 years old. Rick is a paraplegic.  Let me preface the following comments by saying "good for her."  I'm over it.  We didn't work out.  I no longer carry a torch.  If she approached me in the future and wanted to rekindle the romance, I would respectfully (and swiftly) decline.  I do, however, retain a right to think of her as "the brown-haired skag who stole Uncle Krypto's life" and to take perverse pleasure in the hardships of her life minus yours truly.  Those are the rights of man whose heart has been stomped upon.  Every bit of news pertaining to her has been volunteered; I didn't ask for any of it.  Commencing bitter diatribe...  Uhh... not ready for commitment?  She's known him for three months and she's shacked up with him!   I'm  Father Time and a father figure??  He's 16 years older and her boss!  He  could  be her father!   I  live a sedentary lifestyle and don't dance???  He sits in a chair all day and the only rug he's ever cut was the one that got caught in his spokes.  But ol' Rick's still got something on me-- even though he can't feel it, he's still gettin' more ass than I am.  And that is very wrong.

      From  urlLink Reuters  today:   SEATTLE (Reuters) - A black bear was found passed out at a campground in Washington state recently after guzzling down three dozen cans of a local beer, a campground worker said on Wednesday.    "We noticed a bear sleeping on the common lawn and wondered what was going on until we discovered that there were a lot of beer cans lying around," said Lisa Broxson, a worker at the Baker Lake Resort, 80 miles northeast of Seattle.       The hard-drinking bear, estimated to be about two years old, broke into campers' coolers and, using his claws and teeth to open the cans, swilled down the suds.      We must, of course, factor in spillage.  The bear probably only chugged two-thirds (at most) of every can.  So... two cases would be a better estimate.  Cokemaster guzzled the equivalent of nearly 18 cans on his last outing.  Sounds like a helluva match to me.  But-- please note-- there was no mention of this beast losing his cookies.  Or pissing his fur.  Or dancing with fat bear bitches.

       Warning-- this post is gonna be long, drawn-out, and possibly tedious to read... but you may be fascinated by this tale of how fucked up the behind-the-scenes of public eduction really is.     The latest snafu in a long, long line of education profession-related snafus was (cross-my-fingers-knock-on-wood) resolved yesterday afternoon.  With just three days to spare before the start of the 2004-05 school year, I am once again certified to teach English in a West Virginia secondary school, albeit once again temporarily.  I majored in English and completed a MAP (Maryland-approved) education program at Frostburg State University; I graduated in May 2002-- with B.S. English and a MD Teaching Certification (English, secondary schools).  I was told by various professors in the teacher education program that my MD Teaching Cert was reciprocal in 40+ states (meaning having my cert was the same as having their own cert).   Nick Janowitz at  urlLink CollegeHumor  posted a gem of an article on August 10th entitled "Why I Can't Get Girls" that included this excerpt that I strongly relate to:   " Having a good major : The only aspect of college that could possibly translate to the real world is that of having a good major. In college, having a good major (read: anything not English. Or that ‘health and society’ shit, whatever that is) means that you’ll have a good job, which means that you’ll live comfortably, which means that your girl will have six trillion pairs of shoes. Engineering majors get hired to retire. Pre-med majors get hired into ninety years of education and training before they earn their mansion and trophy wife. English majors just don’t get hired. I didn’t have a good major in college and I don’t have a good job now and if there’s any word to describe my dating prospects, it’s certainly not . . . good."    After graduation, my job prospects were slim to none in this area.  In Western Maryland, you are in one of three states of employment:  unemployed (and not making shit), soon-to-be unemployed, or employed (but still not making shit).  Because of the poverty-stricken nature of the area, all of the teachers who should have retired ten years ago are hanging on to their jobs for the paycheck (which is peanuts, but more peanuts than the pathetic pension they'll collect).  I got on as a substitute and barely made ends meet.  My first attempt at securing a fulltime teaching position came midway through that school year.  The opening was in Pennsylvania, and resulted from a teacher who had to suddenly retire due to medical reasons (the real truth-- he had a mental breakdown and declared himself psychological unable to continue).  Was my MD Certification good in PA?  Nope.  I had passed the required Praxis I and II tests (teacher ed tests required for cert in every state), but PA did not accept scores received on computer-based versions of the Praxis I tests (which were the versions that I had aced, of course).  I was granted an "Emergency" PA Certification and filled the position as a longterm sub, but was not retained permanently (for the cert reason and a myriad of other bullshit factors-- politics, etc).  I was prepared to endure yet another year as a substitute when a position opened up in a nearby West Virginia county just two weeks before last school year began.  Was my MD Certification good in WV?  Nope.  WV Cert required one additional Praxis II test that MD did not require.  However-- I was the only applicant for the position... and the county needed a teacher immediately, so I was granted a Provisional WV Certification and hired for the position.  This position was permanent, but I needed to pass that additional Praxis II test before the beginning of the 2004-05 school year.  Then my Provisional (which would by then would have expired) would be replaced by a standard WV Certification.   Extra test, piece of cake, no problem.  I procrastinated, knowing that I'd pass it with little trouble.  Fooling around was a good thing this time, though, because in April I received a letter from the WVDE (West Virginia Department of Education) informing me that new legislation had been passed.  This new law basically decreed that effectively immediately, any out-of-state teaching certification had reciprocity in WV.  Congratulations, I thought-- I just saved $150 on a test I didn't want to take anyway.  Towards the end of the school year, the personnel director from the county board of education came a'callin' about my new certification.  He needed my extra Praxis II score.  I told him about the letter I received and that I didn't have to take the test.  All I needed to give him was my MD Certification information.  He said he'd call me about it over the summer.  I forgot about the whole thing.  First week of summer vacation, I get a phone call from Personnel.  He needs my MD Cert stuff.  I call FSU's education department, assuming they've got what I need on file.  Nope.  I passed the program... but I don't have a cert number.  I have to formally apply with MSDE (Maryland State Department of Education) for that.  So I call MSDE.  I have to send them all my college information and copies of my Praxis scores.  Then they'll take anywhere from 30-90 (!) days to review the materials.  If I qualify, then they'll send me an application form, which I must fill out and staple a $10 check to and send back to them... then they'll send me my MD Cert that I thought I had all along.  30-90 days = oh shit.  I call county personnel back and tell him that my MD Cert is "on its way, should be here any day now" and that I'd call him as soon as I had the thing in-hand.  Doubt and worry begins.  Could the MSDE people possibly take 90 days to check four papers?  Two weeks later, county personnel calls me up and wants to know how I was getting my MD Certification through the mail.  Another prospective hire needed to apply for hers and didn't know the process.  County personnel was under the impression that a MD Certification needed for WV reciprocity could not be obtained in the manner that I was obtaining it.   This impression of his worries me.  I've always had this sense that personnel has been just looking for an excuse to get rid of me, being that I was only a last-minute consolation hire.  A lack of WV certification would be the perfect out for them.  I log on to MSDE's cert website and start to read the fine print.  The fine print states that I was to receive what was called a MD Certificate of Eligibility.  This "CE" was given to applicants that graduated from a MAP program and passed all required Praxis exams.  I also notice something called a MD Standard (I) Certification.  This had the same requirements as the CE, but also included one more-- applicant signed a contract with a MD school system.  This worries me a little more.  I call WVDE and tell them I've got a MD CE and am just making sure that that works for the new reciprocity law.  I am told that a CE is not the same as a certification, and will not suffice.  Oh.  Fuck.  I call county personnel with the website address listing MSDE's certification instructions for his prospective hire.  I omit my findings about the MD CE.  What he doesn't know won't hurt me.  If I tell him of my problems now, he can get pink slip me immediately and have most of the summer to find a replacement.  "I am the Shit," I remind myself, and I will figure out a fix.  I check the Praxis signup webpage.  The next test date is in September.  Sonnavabitch.  So I call MSDE and whine and beg for a MD Standard (I) Certification, claiming that if they don't give me one I'll join the ranks of the thousands of unemployed in Western Maryland.  The heartless bitch with whom I was speaking was not impressed, however, and basically told me "tough titty."      Then I called WVDE back and whined and begged for them to take a MD CE anyway, and they reiterated "tough titty."     Panic grips me for a moment-- but I remember ("I'm the SHIT") and come up with a genius idea (that only a smart bastard like me could).  Just because WV won't take a MD CE doesn't mean that another state won't... and surely one of the other 47 states will reciprocate my CE with a cert that WV would then in turn reciprocate.  So I start researching other states' certification processes online.  Virginia is my first candidate.  I read the fine print twice.  The fine print clearly states that a MD CE, my Praxis scores, and a $60 check will give me a VA Standard Certification.  Hot damn.  As long as my MD CE doesn't take 90 days to get here, and then the VA cert another 90 days, and WV will take a VA cert... I'm in like Flint.  I call WVDE again.  A different person answers this time.  I ask if the VA cert will reciprocate into a WV cert, and then just for kicks I explain my whole situation from the top.  This guy then tells me "hang on-- I don't think you have to go through all of that."  He goes off to verify some info or something, then comes back and tells me that WVDE is currently in talks with MSDE about the MD CE and reciprocity, so just go ahead and sent that CE in and "we'll get you taken care of."  Damn skippy.  I leave for my July-spanning Florida vacation muchly relieved, hoping that MSDE will move their asses on the CE.  I return at the end of the month-- no CE in the mailbox.  County Personnel calls the first week of August.  I'm about to start stalling and bullshitting about getting the MD Cert info "anytime now," when he tells me that he just talked to WVDE and they will  not  accept a MD CE (contrary to what I had been told the last time)  The powers-that-be, in their infinite wisdom, say that the MD CE is definitely not equal to a MD Standard (I) Cert, because of the "contract" line.  If a person has signed a contract with a school system, then that means that he/she had to have passed an FBI background check (which approved him/her for working with minors).   WTF??  Never mind the fact that I already passed an FBI background check to substitute teach in MD, a second FBI background check to substitute teach in PA, and a third FBI background check to teach for the  past year  in WV!!         Personnel then goes on to tell me that a person can only receive one WV Provisional Cert in his/her lifetime and that a Provisional is non-renewable.  I brace myself for the "tough titty" comment at the local level (hell, I'd already gotten it from several different states) and a "I'm sorry, but we're gonna have to let you go," but miraculously he instead informs me that the superintendent is going to sign a special waiver so that I can continue teaching-- as long as I take and pass the extra Praxis II as soon as possible.  Back to square one.  What did I learn from this mess?  Procrastination is bad-- if I would have just taken the test, none of the WV Cert mess would have ever happened.  But, then again... procrastination is good-- I fooled around and didn't tell Personnel about the MD CE impotence in June... so he didn't find out until August when he called WVDE about it himself... which left him just three days to find a replacement if he fired me... so he was forced to find a way to keep me (even though I still think he'd love to boot me).  What else did I learn?  No wonder there's a teacher shortage in most of the country.  In addition to being grossly underpaid, teachers must suffer an administration infrastructure that apparently rode the short bus back in the day.   And then there's the insipid process of earning the CE or cert or whatever in the first place.  I might chronicle that waste-of-my-time ordeal one of these days.   And then there are the students... but I'm not even going there.  Yet.  There'll be plenty of bitching to do about them starting next Thursday.   (I honestly do like my job, though... I swear)

      In Athens, site of the in-progress 2004 Summer Olympic games, the time is 1:09am tomorrow.  All of the Tuesday night events are in the books, the winners' anthems have played, the medals distributed, and I've already read about all of it online.  And that sucks.   I'm admittedly not a huge Olympics fan, but certain events are must-see TV.  Ladies' figure skating.  Women's swimming.  Women's volleyball.  Women's gymnastics.  Nubile young athletes in skintight uniforms bending and twisting and sweating for the glory of their country.  God Bless America.  This year's women's gymnastics team final is to be broadcast on tonight's  NBC primetime coverage.  I was looking muchly forward to it.  Then I read online this afternoon (Yahoo! headline) that the USA gals got the silver.  Granted, watching the bending and twisting and sweating will still be a treat, but I didn't want to know who wins, dammit!  There's no wonder the ratings are way down this year.  Watching a sporting event after you've learned its outcome is practically pointless.  No drama, no excitement, big whup.   My favorite Olympic moments, unspoiled by the internet when I witnessed them :  --the "Magnificent Seven" USA women's gymnastics team from Atlanta 1996.  Shannon Miller was gorgeous.  Dominique Moceanu was cute as hell.  Kerri Strug-- her vault with a busted leg that catapulted the team to oh-so-dramatic gold medal victory-- it kicked ass.  I had crushes on those gals for months afterwards (and was allowed to, as I was only 16 at the time).  --the individual USA ladies figure skaters from Salt Lake City 2002:  Michelle Kwan, Sasha Cohen, and Sarah Hughes... again, all lookers, and Hughes' upset gold medal win was as exciting as the games get.   I've continued to follow Miss Cohen's career, as she is one of my future wives.  Look upon her talent and beauty  urlLink here .  Sasha, Natalie Portman, Kirsten Dunst, and I will live a happy polygamorous life in Utah together after we can all clear a day on our schedules for the wedding.

      From  urlLink Reuters  Saturday:  "Two British policemen have been suspended from duty after a newspaper reported they had been filmed enjoying the attentions of porn stars while they were supposed to be on patrol.  The News of the World reported Sunday that the two policemen, aged 30 and 34, had been called to calm down a crowd who spotted a pornographic movie being filmed in a street in London's Soho district.    But the officers talked their way into the film crew's van and allowed the two female stars to perform a sex act on them, while the crew secretly rolled the cameras, the paper said."   Abuse of power at its finest.   Cokemaster and the Russian's across-the-pond doppelgangers.   In other news (also reported by Reuters):  "A wheelchair-bound woman with no limbs sued Air France for discrimination on Friday, alleging she was kept off a flight by a gate agent who told her a 'torso cannot possibly fly on its own.'"   The article fails to include the transcript from the rest of the gate agent/torso confrontation.  The "torso," a Ms. Adele Price, retorted:   "Oh, I see.  Running away, eh?  You yellow bastard.  Come back here and take what's coming to you.  I'll bite your legs off!"

      Leading an uneventful life is nice for its drama-free-ness, but it sucks for blog inspiration.  Last few days in summary, as I need to post something:   Saturday  was a sleep all-day, out all-night situation.   Cokemaster's still gun-shy from our last outing, so for the second week in a row, he stayed at home (was a  pussy ).  The White Russian (aka my judicial branch-connected cohort) went in his stead.   This was something of a rarity, as WR is more interested in charity outings than the typical bar adventures and hates to be up past his geriatric bedtime of 9pm.  We ran The Gauntlet, which usually consists of first visiting the bar with the $15 all-you-can-drink of whatever-you-want open bar special until 1am, then hopping over the West Virginia line to the hole in the ground that stays open a bit later and has awesome wings... and then to Sheetz (of course) and then home, all while trying to avoid the fuzz.  This Gauntlet Run was relatively tame.  The first bar was host to a bachelorette party.  Had one of us been wearing tighty-whiteys, we could have participated.  Left for bar #2 at 12:30 and got the kickass wings.  The Russian-- who by the way is in no way Russian... he just drinks the White ones with a passion and is going bald faster than me, which makes my own rapid hair loss a bit less traumatic.  Anyway, the Russian recognized a gal he used to work near (a gal he should have hooked up with way back).  The Russian was being extremely shy (was being a  pussy ), so the writer had make the reintroductions happen.  And I took one for the team watching her purse while the two danced the one of the slow songs that always end the night's music.  Because I am selfless like that.  Sidenote:  if the Russian does not make an effort to contact this chick again, his ass will be kicked.   Sunday  was a waste.  I interrupted sleep with a trip to church in the morning, then returned to bed immediately upon my return and stayed there until it was dark outside.   Today  was BrotherWatch.  I unsuccessfully attempted to enhance the little turd's limited soccer skills.   I have three days remaining in my summer vacation.  Something exciting needs to happen before Friday.

      Friday the 13th at-the-bar observations:  --The three "house" specialty drinks are named the  Mongolian Motherfucker , the  Dirty Jamaican , and the  Jamaican Monkey .  Welcome to West Virginia.  Prejudiced, much?  --My best friend and I were sent to the principal's office (first time ever) in the fourth grade for picking on a fat and ugly classmate on the schoolbus.  She was at the bar celebrating her 24th birthday.  She is still fat and ugly.  --One crazy lookin' dude was sporting a ratty-ass striped sweater-- alternating wide red/olive green stripes.  Freddy Krueger-chic.  That was creepy enough... but imagine my surprise when I enter the bathroom later, and there he is taking a piss at the urinal-- bracing himself against the wall with a blade-gloved hand (plastic prop, but still).  I guess his hockey mask was in the wash.

      Cokemaster and I saw  AVP  ( Alien vs Predator ) this afternoon. Not going to get into a major-league critique, but suffice it to say that the flick is a fanboy wet dream, incorporating all of the signature elements of both franchises. We both loved it. Good mindless action entertainment. 8 out of 10.  What bothered me... and I mean  seriously  bothered me about my theater experience today (besides the  six  commercials before the trailers)... were the four audience members sitting in front of us. Our fellow moviegoers included a dad (presumably), and his three children.  Little  children. Like 6,7, and 8 year children. A son (the oldest) and two tiny little daughters. Geez, Dad!  I understand the warped thinking that comes into play when the flick that you've been obsessing over for months finally comes out. I'm the guy who forced his girlfriend to stand in line for eight hours to see  Episode I -- on her nineteenth birthday. But this... geez!  Take your lil' ones to see  Princess Diaries 2--  not to see scary, drooling, sharp-fanged monsters ripping the guts out of one another and human bystanders (who are screaming "die, you motherfuckers!! all the while). Don't tell your little girl to be quiet when she's start whimpering "Daddy, I don't  liiiiike  this."   Superman III  gave me nightmares for weeks. I was older than your kids when I saw it! And crazy-old-woman-sucked-into-supercomputer was Malibu Barbie compared to the horrors they just endured. Geez!  And while I'm on this rant, movie theater should schedule one special screening of each movie each week... for "special" customers only. Moms and dads with newborn babies-- this is your show. Herds of punk-ass teenagers who must commentate on and ridicule everything on screen-- this is your show. Bellowing and spazzed-out retards-- this is your show.  Excuse me while I call the proper authorities.

      Black Entertainment Television's (BET) afternoon music video program,  The Center , offers advice daily on a variety of topics.  A week or two ago I was schooled on the art of proper gift-giving.  Today's pointers focused on back-to-school...  Tip #2: Establish relationships with teachers.  "Ex-tablish relationships wit cho teachers.  Raise yo hand.  Axe queshuns.  Sit up frun.  Talk at them affer class.  Make sho they know yo name.  Being teacher's pet doan hurt no body.  Brown nosin' s'OK, too."   Better advice has never been uttered. The uttering itself could have been better, though.

      Litigation gone wild...   urlLink Newsarama  is reporting that  urlLink Marvel Comics  is suing the  urlLink WWE  (World Wrestling Entertainment) and Terry Bollea $100,000, claiming trademark infringement.  Terry Bollea's ring moniker-- Hulk Hogan, allegedly violates Marvel's trademarked name "The Incredible Hulk."  The lawsuit is apparently a renewal of one that started in 1985, when the WWE (then known as the WWF) was rising to popularity with Hogan as their biggest star.  At that point, the still-low-profit WWF did not want to engage in an expensive, drawn-out legal battle with the publisher, so a royalties agreement was hastily thrown together.  Marvel was to receive .9 of 1% of every dollar made by the WWE on Hogan-related projects, $100 for each match that Hogan participated in, and 10% of all the money the WWE received from Terry Bollea when he appeared outside of wrestling as Hogan.  The WWE also agreed to "image" demands ("incredible" could never be used in reference to Hogan, and the word "Hulk" could never be printed larger than "Hogan" in logos).  This agreement was to last 20 years... and the twenty year period ran out on this year's July 6th.  The WWE is now releasing years of archival wrestling programming on DVD, though... which means lots of Hogan (arguably the biggest star the "sport" has ever seen)... and lots of $$$ that Marvel would love to see in royalties.  Read the full article (which includes an in-depth history of the lawsuit)  urlLink here .  Bullshit, I say!  Stan Lee and Steve Ditko may have named an irradiated Bruce Banner "the Hulk"... but they did it because ol' green genes was a behemoth... "one that is bulky" if we want to drag the dictionary out again today!  Stan didn't invent the word.  Look at Terry Bollea-- 24-inch Pythons!!!  The Hulkster's a beast-- a "hulk," too!  And he ain't green!  Vince McMahon shouldn't have pansied out in '85...

       Minor spoilers ahead   Saw  Collateral  last night, the new Michael (Heat, Manhunter) Mann flick.  Plot:  "Max," a stuck-in-a-rut L.A. cab driver (Jamie Foxx) basically agrees to drive "Vincent" (a gray-haired Tom Cruise) around all night so Vincent can complete five stops required in sealing a real estate deal.  The truth is soon revealed, however, when Vincent's first "client" falls out of a window after being shot, and lands on the roof of Max's cab.  Vincent's really a hitman with five targets to eliminate before dawn, and now Max is an unwilling accomplice/chaffeur for the whole ordeal.  My take:  Eh.  Great acting-- Cruise is a badass, and Foxx has more than just comedic chops after all.  Amazing how far he's come since horsey-mouthed LaWanda and snapmaster T-Dawg on  In Living Color .  Several great "how are they gonna get out of that mess?" moments and a few good laughs along the way (loved Vincent telling off Max's dispatcher over the CB).  However, too many neat coincidences for my taste-- the whole plot revolves around two doozies at the beginning... and the ending was extremely predictable and plain.  6 out of 10.   Major spoilers ahead   Cokemaster saw it with me (he said his hangover lasted nearly three days, by the way, and he's never going out again), and on the way home we had the standard post-movie dissection/discussion.  CM was pissed about Vincent's demise at the end of the picture-- "He was just doing his job, man... makin' an honest livin,' killing people.  It sucked that he died.  I hate movies that end like that."   Good to know... The next time CM pukes in my car, I can pay someone to put two in his chest and one in his head, and he'll be cool with it.  'Cause being a hired gun is a  respectable  profession.  The only thing still bugging me about the movie is its title.  I don't get it.  When I think collateral, I think something you put up as security for a loan, or collateral damage.  Neither definition fits properly for the movie.  Other definitions for "collateral" (that I had to look up):  -- situated or running side by side; parallel  Nope.  Vincent sat in the back of the cab.  -- having an ancestor in common but descended from a different line  Nope.  Definitely no relation here.  -- serving to support or corroborate  Marginal.  Max helped out occasionally, but I don't think "supporting" is something one does with a gun to his/her head.  -- coinciding in tendency or effect; concomitant or accompanying  This one works.  Barely.  Max  did  accompany Vincent.  Hollywood, take note-- when an dude with a degree in English must research vocabulary to decipher your movie's title, pick another damn title.  Like  Driving Miss Daisy's Sociopathic Great-Grandson.

      Sean Fahey, norse god/comic reviewer over at  urlLink Chud.com 's  Thor's Comics Column  posted an  urlLink great article  last week:   "I think of it this way. In any given  month , the  number one  selling comic sells at most  250,000 units. In its opening  weekend ,  Catwoman  sold approximately 1,670,000 tickets.  Six times  as many people saw  Catwoman , a film panned by critics garnering overwhelmingly negative publicity, in its opening weekend than read the first issue of  Identity Crisis , heralded as the year’s largest comic book event and June’s number one selling book. Six fuckin’ times as many. More tickets to  Catwoman  were sold in one weekend than issues of the  top five  selling comic books in the entire month of June  combined ."   That's a shame, folks.  These books just aren't for the geek set!  True, the spandex and superpowers world of heroes makes up a huge percentage of the comic books published, but there are many, many more that you're missing out on!  The article continues:   "How does this happen?  In short, I believe it’s because most people just aren’t aware that the material is available.  I won’t believe for one second that at least a third of the people willing to pay ten dollars for a ticket to  Catwoman  would not have rather paid that ten dollars for the first trade paperback of  The Walking Dead  or  100 Bullets .  I won’t believe for one second that a fan of  Law & Order  would not be willing to pick up the first trade of  Gotham Central .  I won’t believe for one second that at least one person in ten that saw the  Lord of Rings  films would not pick up  Conan .  I won’t believe for one second that anyone who enjoyed the  A-Team  would not enjoy  The Losers .  I won’t believe for one second that the overwhelming majority of George Romero fans would not be willing to pick up the first trade of  The Walking Dead , and I won’t believe for one second that the overwhelming majority of  Evil Dead  fans would not be willing to check out  The Goon .  I won’t believe for one second that at least ten percent of the people that read Tom Clancy and Robert Ludlum would not pick up a trade of  Queen & Country  or  Sleeper …          …if they were aware of these books."   Please read the rest of the article!  (link above)   My current non-superhero faves are both penned by Brian K Vaughan--  Y:The Last Man  (about a future in which a plague has wiped out every male of every species except one man and his pet monkey), and  Ex Machina  (a book that is strongly reminiscent of TV's  The West Wing  and follows the the world's first superhero, now retired, and his struggles as the new mayor of New York City).  The wonky superhero stuff kicks major ass, too, though.  From last week's issue number 2 of Joe Kelly and Doug Mahnke's  Justice League Elite , published by  urlLink DC Comics  :    Major Disaster says: (after magician Manitou Raven summons a giant mystical flying ferret to transport the team to battle) " Join the JLE.  Fight terrorists.  Good pay, benefits.  See the world by giant fuckin' rat.  Sheesh!  (Shotgun.) "     Try 'em!  You'll like 'em!

      aka "Cook prep instructions,  urlLink Escher-style "  My lunch today was the new "Lasagna with Meat Sauce" entree from the masters of the frozen dinner--  urlLink Boston Market . The people that write the packaging lit these days have their asses covered to the tenth power.   Microwave Oven:   The following cook preparation was developed using a 1000 watt microwave oven. Due to variations in all ovens, adjustment to cooking time may be required.   1. Remove tray from outer carton; pull back corner of film to vent.   2. Cook on HIGH for 6 minutes.   3. Let stand in microwave for 1-2 minutes. Enjoy.     Imagine the phone calls...  Disgruntled customer: "Hello? Customer service? I am very disappointed with your new Boston Market lasagna meal." Customer service: "Did you follow the instructions carefully?" DC: "Uh... yeah." CS: "Are you sure?" DC: "Positive. The lasagna sucked balls." CS: "Sir, step three clearly states that you are to 'enjoy.' If I am correctly assuming that "sucking balls" means that you did not, in fact, 'enjoy' your dining experience, then you have failed to follow the preparation instructions carefully." DC: "So... If I'm understanding you here... it's my own damn fault that your lasagna sucks balls." CS: "Precisely. Thank you and have a nice day." DC: "Fuck!"

      Today's a BrotherWatch day, and I've already been shocked and awed by the little turd.  The conversation (no kidding) that just ensued:  LT: "Are you gonna vote for a new president or the President that's already there?"  Me: "The same guy."  LT: "Yeah, he is the best. But I would be better. Would you vote for me if I was President? When I'm old enough? Would you vote for me for another year?"  Me: "Maybe."  LT: "If I had 250 chances, would you vote for me 250 times? I think you would. I'm gonna vote for the same guy. George W. Bush. Did you know his name?"  Me: (laughing) "Yeah."  LT: "Because I just told you, right?" Then the topic shifted abruptly from elections present and future to science.  LT: "I know what electricity looks like. When it lights sump'in up, it makes it red." Ladies and gentlemen, your 2048 Republican presidential candidate. Vote early and often.

      Frequenting the same bars every weekend (that I decide to venture out) is my modus operandi, for better or worse.  One must admit that it's kinda cool the first time the bouncer at the door smiles with recognition at your arrival, claps you on the back with a "how the hell'er you?", and waves you on in without the mandatory ID check, proclaiming "this guy's cool, I know him."  You grab your table.  You say hi to your waitress, the one that knows your name and knows what to bring you without you having to ask for it.  You are a  regular .  Then you realize that your repeated patronage at such an establishment is pathetic.  Do you have nothing better to do with yourself?  Pathetic or no, being a regular means you get to see the other regulars on a well,  regular  basis. I'm not regular enough yet to know that diverse cast of characters on a first-name basis. I'd rather sit back, relax, and enjoy the show. Talking to regulars and finding out the truth is rarely as fun as devising fictional biographies for them.  I have my own little nicknames for every regular, based on what I've observed from afar and the tiny facts I occasionally pick up from waitresses and friends.  One such named regular is "Disco Dan." I see DD every weekend. He's in his late 40s. Wears Wal-mart striped polos and jeans.  White hi-tops, also from the Wal-mart shoe department.  Salt and pepper slicked back hair, mustache.  He's already there when we arrive. Probably been there for hours.  Always carrying a glass of beer (the only guy I've ever seen drink draft in there).  A regular Casanova-- it's surreal to watch him flit from one table of women to the next. He never succeeds, but kudos to anyone that can shrug off rejection like that and not get one whit discouraged.  Being absolutely shitfaced probably helps, though.   When the booze really kicks in, DD’s the first to hit the dance floor, and it’s his mad skillz there that earned him the nickname.  He carries his glass o’ draft with him, and shakes the booty like it’s 1979.  He’s got a helluva prance/gallop thing going with his feet, and he flaps his arms like he’s directing a choir.  Total riot.  When the ladies get out there, they make faces and avoid him like the plague when he starts to drift in their direction.  I “officially” met Disco Dan this Friday night.  I was there before Moffman and the group arrived (Cokemaster mysteriously wasn’t in the mood for Miller Time this weekend), enjoying the calm before the post-midnight rush, when DD wandered near my table and began spewing random obscenities.   The target of his rage seemed to be the HerpegonnosyphilAIDS table.  There is a group of three women (regulars all) that we have been told (by bartenders/waitresses) to avoid at all costs.  Rumor (based on strong evidence) has it that one or more of that crew is afflicted with at least one strain of the genital plague.  No one’s sure specifically what they’re carrying, thus the all-encompassing nature of the name—HerpegonnosyphilAIDS (HGSA).   Anyway… Disco was apparently pissed at the diseased.  I was the closest to him at that moment, so I became the sympathetic ear-- bitching’s no fun unless you have someone to bitch  to .  He slurred something about “that bastard over there thinks he’s hot shit prison guard showing off for them bitches.  Asshole!”  A new guy was sitting with the HGSA crowd and chatting up the gals.  DD hovers around the HGSAs every week looking for a piece (to no avail), and this added competition had him steamed.   I just smiled and nodded at his predicament, pondering whether or not I should warn him of the dangers that lurked in the panties next door, when he introduced himself as “Bob.”  Nickname is now void forever, though I must say that “Bob” is dippy-enough to suit the old man well.   I decided to pry a little more, so I asked my new friend Bob how he knew that the guy was a prison guard.  Did he work with him at the prison?  “ No ,” Bob grunts.  “I was  in there .”  Damn, my bad.  But at least now I know where he learned how to dance.

      Because I'm sedentary and have no life, I've been spending my Friday reading comic book reviews online and watching shitty afternoon television.  I've seen the same frickin' commercial about 20 times in the past two hours.  No matter what channel I'm browsing, there it is.  Scabby-looking 20-something that's supposedly a (former) high-school student walks into an Asian-run(?) leather store, shopping for a new wallet.  Counter-lady asks him if it's for a graduation, and he stutters "no, I dropped out."  She calls her associate over for help and the two proceed to babble in a foreign tongue, stopping occasionally to look at the guy and giggle.  Then the salesguy brings out a tiny little wallet for the dropout, who replies, "gee, it's kinda small!"  Screen blackout occurs, and this startling fact appears onscreen:  "High school dropouts earn 42% less than graduates."  Sad, but untrue.  I am a high school salutatorian and college graduate.  Now I teach high school, and sadly, that wallet's a bit too large for me.  Midway through the last school year, one of my students dropped out.  I ran into him at a convenience store a few weeks later, and he asked me if I thought what he did was stupid.  I gave him my views on the subject, which pretty much mirrored the message of the aforementioned commercial.  His response was to pull out his wallet. A very large wallet, which was bloated and heavy with cash. "I do alright," he laughed. 'Course, he'll be in the slam before long for possession, distribution, or worse... but I guarantee that he's making a hell of a lot more than me.  The only truly-accurate portrayal in that ad?  Badmouthing the customers in an indecipherable language!  We all know that you're saying bad things about us while we wait on out General Tso's!

      It's been a day of firsts at the ol' homestead.  The little brother endured/is currently enduring:   - his first ever soccer practice  Mom reports that soccer ain't his bag.  My fat little buddy kicks like a sissy and can't run sprints (he gets tired  real  quick).   -his first ever loose tooth  Looks like the first to fall out will be one of the front bottom four.  Big brother took great delight in telling the horrified little turd that each and every one of his teeth is going to fall out (I failed to mention that he'd be getting a replacement set).   -his first ever bout of constipation  Sunday afternoon was the poor guy's last successful sitdown.  Early today he proudly proclaimed, "I haven't stinkied in three days!"  But...  labor pains kicked in this evening, so he's been on the can trying his damnedest all night.  I tried to inspire him with the story of my own childhood jamup adventure... which culminated in a Macguyver-esque enema (turkey baster full of soapy water) injected up my dumper by dear-old Dad.  It wasn't enough, though, as he was still grunting and bawling in agony when Dad got home from work at 10.  Dad entered the bathroom and cheerled to little avail, then proceeded to further hype the up-the-butt final solution.   And yet another reason why I love my little brother: after having been warned (the umpteenth time) of the impending anal invasion if he can't lay some pipe by tomorrow, my brother turned to a higher power.  He asked us "how long will it take if I pray?"   I pray for millions... he prays for a painless poop.  Gotta love it.

      TV on DVD just got a little sweeter today...  Universal has just released the first season of  Knight Rider  on DVD.   I am so there.  There was just something about super-powered vehicles that got me all charged up as a kid.  I watched  Dukes  for the General Lee, and  Knight  because the car had missiles and a jet booster.   So tomorrow I'm gonna plunk down $50 and buy it, then watch two episodes and probably realize that Hasselhoff's not as cool as I remember him, the effects are laughable, and the plotlines are bad cheese.  And revel in the nostalgia anyway.  When's  Airwolf  coming out, dammit?

      Finale.  After the Cokemaster slimed the table/floor/purse/Moffman (and worst of all, my own half-full Corona), I made the executive decision to get the hell out of there.  With the cleaned-up Moffman in tow, whose DD would have been DWI, the two of us struggled to get a bobbing and weaving Cokemaster back to my car.  Hefting a 100 pounds heavier-than-you guy (whose talent for walking is comparable to a ten month-old kid) ain't no picnic.  Most of the drive was fairly uneventful.  CM just bounced around the backseat like the happiest drunk fool you ever saw, screaming and "woo!"ing out the rolled-down windows.  At the freeway exit for Moff's house, the trouble began.  "Dood.  I don' fel suh good," warns the Cokemaster.  "Oh shit," thinks I.  I immediately pull over, bail out of the car, and quickly open the back door.  CM stumbles out, then proceeds to wander around the road, then into the grass on the shoulder, then under a road sign, then back towards the car.  Then he begins to unzip his fly.  "Not towards the car!!" I scream.  The Cokemaster obeys and pivots just in time, slamming his rear against the rear passenger door.  He giggles as he is relieved (as am I, that he didn't piss on my car).   As the Cokemaster zips up and turns around, I am not as relieved.  The crotch and right pantleg of his shorts are soaked.  Leaning back against the vehicle apparently did not create an ideal trajectory, which resulted a pissed-down leg.  Yay for my upholstery.  But it was still pretty damn hilarious.  Next stop was Moff's house.  The Cokemaster's continued cries of unfettered joy alerted the neighborhood of our arrival.  There was a bit of drama during Moff's hurried goodbye when CM decided he wanted the newly-vacated shotgun.  Upon getting out of the car, he wandered off down the street.  Moff rounded him up, got him into the front seat, and away we went.  Two minutes later, salvation!  My new copilot passed out.  A good one, too:  head lolled, tongue-out, drool a-flowing.  All was peachy until I got to Sheetz-- convenience store Mecca.  A night out is not complete without a visit to MTO-land.  We usually order a bunch of food and gorge in the parking lot before finally heading home, but tonight I just wanted some water.  The poor bastard had to work all day the next day (haha!) and I knew he was headed for the ultimate hangover.  A big-ass bottle of water was his only hope.  The speed bump at the entrance to the parking lot jolted the Cokemaster from his stupor, and also must have jolted something in his stomach, because he started heaving his guts up two seconds after his eyes opened.  The first gout was a minor one that ran down his chin and onto his shirt.  The second gout was major, and it splashed right on the bottom of the window frame-- that perfect spot where puke ran down the outside of the door, puke ran down the inside of the door, and puke ran down into that little crack that the window comes out of.   While CM was doing his best  Exorcist  improv, I was simultaneously attempting to steer the rest of the way into a space (left knee), push his head out the window (right hand), and open his door while avoiding the spray (left hand).  I succeeded.  When the door opened, I gave him a friendly shove halfway out of his seat, then killed the engine and stormed into the store.  I didn't stay for the show.  I bought two liters of water and a roll of paper towels.  The next 45 minutes were spent on dragging the Cokemaster's excrement-covered self out of my car and onto the curb, marveling at the sight of the tremendous puddle of vomit on the pavement (did he really drink/eat  that  much?), retching at the smell of the aforementioned puddle, and scrubbing the interior/exterior/window-crack/window of my car door.  I called the state's attorney-connected buddy on my cell to bitch.  He didn't answer, so I bitched to his voicemail.  Cokemaster never did offer to help.  He remained mostly unconscious on his back in the grass.  I heard an occasional errant grunt or spit from his direction, but that was the extent of his participation.  When the door was as clean to my satisfaction, I lined the passenger seat with the remaining five paper towels and transferred a delirious Cokemaster from the ground to the car for the fourth (and final) time of the evening.  He passed out again.  Drooled some more.   We pulled into my parents' driveway at around 4:30am.  I could have left him at the bar.  I could have left him pissing on the side of exit 35.  I could have left him wandering around Moff's neighborhood.  I could left him at Sheetz.  I could have herded him into his own vehicle to sleep.  I could have kicked his drunk ass.  Instead, I risked eviction by hauling him inside and upstairs to the shower.  He woke up my dad (you've read this part of the tale already).  I got him clean drawers.  He slept on my couch in the basement.  I washed his clothes.   'Cause that's what you do for your boys.  I woke up the Cokemaster a few hours later so he could get to work on time.  I told him of our adventure, and he laughed.  He apologized profusely and thanked me for taking care of him.  The final surprise:  I called him that evening and thanked him for a wet couch cushion.  He had pissed himself in his sleep.

      OK... as promised.  Night From Hell, Part 2: Splat Out of Hell .  First: the binge of epic proportions. We arrived at 11:30pm. Got beer. The Cokemaster drained his first bucket o' ponies in slightly less than 30 minutes. Everything was very mellow and nice at this point.  At midnight, the count was six ponies = 42 ounces of beer = 3.5 standard beers. Let's run some figures. 3.5 beers in 30 minutes would be equivalent to 7 beers per hour (bph). The  urlLink blood alcohol content chart  I have only runs to 240 pound guys. CM is bit bigger, I think. So... with adjustments made, 7 bph for a guy his size would theoretically result in a .12 on the breathalyzer. The survey says:   "BAC .10%-.12%: At this level, you feel euphoric, but you lack coordination and balance. Your motor skills are markedly impaired, as are your judgment and memory. You probably don't remember how many drinks you've had. Your emotions are exaggerated, and some people become loud, aggressive, or belligerent. If you're a guy, you may have trouble getting an erection when your BAC is this high."   Roundabouts 12:30am... Euphoric? Check. Loud? Oh, yeah. Belligerent? Getting there. Erectile Dysfunction? Didn't ask. We ordered a few baskets of fries at this point. Nothing like a plate of grease and salt to inspire further drinking. After finishing the fries (and they were damn good), CM began to shift into overdrive and challenged all takers to chugging competitions. He amazed a small gathered audience with his prowess, besting the three other guys at our table with ease. I did not participate, for I knew that that was I battle that I could not win (or place, or show).  The Cokemaster, however, was not content with his initial victories. He wanted to defend his title as quickly (and as often) as possible. One defeated party from a previous contest demanded a rematch. In his excitement at being challenged, coupled with his "markedly impaired judgment," CM failed to notice that the challenger was competing with a recapped  empty  bottle. The rest of the audience  did  notice, of course, and everyone howled with delight at the Cokemaster's shocked outburst at being annihilated this time around.  The stunt was just as funny the second time.  And the third time.  Midway through the chugfest, at about 1am, a cap-count confirmed that the new total was at/around 20 ponies. So, figures for the 12am-1am period: 13 ponies = 91 ounces of beer = 7.6 standard beers. 7.6 beers in 60 minutes = nearly 8 bph. 8 bph = .13 on the breathalyzer. And the survey says:   "BAC .13%-.17%: Your euphoric feelings may give way to unpleasant feelings. You have difficulty talking, walking, or even standing. Your judgment and perception are severely impaired. You may become more aggressive, and there is an increased risk of accidentally injuring yourself or others. This is the point when you may experience a blackout."   I'd say it was about then that the Cokemaster entered the time portal. I guess at 8 bph, his flux capacitor kicks him in the ass. In a conversation today, he says the last thing he remembered was starting to chug beers against people. The next thing he remembered was how scalding hot the water was in my shower.  Anyhow, at around 1:20am, I was summoned to the dance floor by a hot blonde friend of mine, and proceeded to get some grind on for about 15 minutes. Then my blonde partner was interrupted by her friend. Blondie turned to me, distraught, and informed me that her purse now smelled horrible because "some dude puked all over the table."  I knew who the "dude" was without having to ask, but out of some desperate hope for the contrary, I asked anyway.  Confirmation: "Yeah, that big guy you're with."  I then looked toward the table, and standing beside it was the Moffman (a guy I graduated with that was sitting with us). Moffman gave the point and beckon.  Further confirmation: "Your friend just puked all over me, man! He was like, 'Sup?' then 'BLEARGHHH!!"  Table, floor, Blondie's purse, and the Moffman-- all direct hits. Miller Lite + Coors Light + fries/ketchup = viscous pink slime that reeked like spoiled nacho cheese.  Estimated tally for 1:00am-1:30am period (based on known cap-count and eyewitness accounts): 10 ponies = 70 ounces of beer = 5.83 standard beers. 5.83 beers in 30 minutes = almost 12 bph. 12 bph = .20 on the breathalyzer. Survey says:   BAC .20%: You feel confused, dazed, or otherwise disoriented. You need help to stand up or walk. If you hurt yourself at this point, you probably won't realize it because you won't feel pain. If you are aware you've injured yourself, chances are you won't do anything about it. At this point you may experience nausea and/or start vomiting (keep in mind that for some people, a lower blood alcohol level than .20% may cause vomiting). Your gag reflex is impaired, so you could choke if you do throw up. Since blackouts are likely at this level, you may not remember any of this.   Vomiting? That's a big 10-4.  Tomorrow, the conclusion:  Night From Hell, Part 3: Hell On Wheels .

      Back with the promised blow-by-blow of the night from hell a little later.  The expected fireworks were minimal.  Until then...  Ever see that new Chef Boyardee commercial?  The one with the cute little girl and her mom shopping at the supermarket?   Mom asks her daughter, "What do you want for dinner tonight?"  Daughter grabs a can of Chef Boyardee Ravioli from the shelf, but Mom vetoes the choice, explaining "you've had Chef every night this week."  Daughter whines a little, lays down a helluva pout, but obediently puts the can back on the shelf.  Then, of course, things get odd and the can rolls off the shelf, out the market door, through the parking lot, down the road, up the street, and into the little girl's house, coming to rest against her foot (much to her delight).  Sentient pasta = creepy.  What's more disturbing, though, is Mom's reason for the "no."  Someone call social services!  What kind of parent feeds his/her kid Chef Boyardee for dinner  every night??     Nevermind.   I  would probably feed my kids the stuff every night.

      I miss my old apartment.  Here I sit, in my basement lair in my parent's house, at a quarter after five in the morning, recently returned from what was supposed to be a tame few hours at a bar.  Here I sit, wondering if I still will be dwelling here at the same time tomorrow.  I really didn't have plans to go out this evening.  I went out last night, sans cohorts, but had a nice time.  My craving for outings this week was satiated for the most part.  But...   plans once again changed.  I was getting bored again as the night progressed, so I gave last night's chief  bailer a call to see if he was more motivated a day later.  Turns out he was, so we departed for an abbreviated night out at around 11pm.  Got to the bar at about 11:30.  Drink of choice was the "bucket o' ponies" special... six iced-down "baby beers" for $5.50.  My buddy, whom I shall refer to hereafter on the blog as "The Cokemaster" (dubbed such because of his affinity for Coke-mixed drinks on weekend outings: Captain and Coke, Crown and Coke, Jack and Coke, etc) finished his first bucket before the stroke of midnight.  What was supposed to be a "chill" and relaxed night soon turned into a binge of epic proportions for The Cokemaster-- a binge that has led to him currently sleeping on the couch in a pair of my drawers.  Because he pissed in and puked on his own.   My Good Samaritude involved his cleanup.  Laundering of his clothes and directions to the shower.  Unfortunately, the shower is upstairs, where the homeowners sleep, and the poor Cokemaster's equilibrium was fucked, to say the least.  Getting him to the bathroom, and his subsequent attempts at getting situated under the water (which I thankfully did not witness) created enough noise to wake the father-figure.  Dad is a cranky bastard at 5am, as many disturbed sleepers tend to be in the wee hours, and I was accosted in the hall as I listened for the water to shut off.  Liability issues were heatedly discussed-- "what if he slips and breaks his neck in the shower???" and ultimatums were laid down-- "this is the  last  time... this the  last  time."  Unreasonable commands were given-- "when he gets done, you will drive him home immediately and sleep in his vehicle until the morning, then he can drive you home.  He will  not  be staying here" and defining statements were made-- "this  isn't  the recovery house."   To all of which I responded, "go back to bed... go back to bed... go back to bed... I've got it all under control."   I'm going to bed now.  I'm going to go enjoy the calm before the inevitable storm.  More about this later.  Plenty of embarrassing gory details to divulge.  If I'm not homeless by then.
