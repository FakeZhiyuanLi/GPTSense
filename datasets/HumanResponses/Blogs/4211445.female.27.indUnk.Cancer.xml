       inquired yesterday for my hair relax...it's P935! but it's ok coz until aug 31, hair treatments are less 50%...opening promo! i'm so excited...it's the first for my hair to get any treatment...yup...my hair doesn't even know how hot oil feels! i think joan will go with me...she'll have a foot spa naman.      well, so much for my kakikayan...minsan lang naman eh!

       wala lang...house...office...work...house...it's a bit jammed in the mrt but the line in the fx terminal was tolerable. im considering having my hair relaxed...but much thought has to be put into this decision...my hair might get offended coz it's already staight & yet i still want it to be relaxed...when can i move in kaya to my "boarding house"? where? secret! basta it's definitely nearer that where i live now...and i have my parents (or my mom's at least) blessings!

       in fairness, my wish came true last night...mrt wasn't jammed & the que in the fx terminal wasn't a drag. we (w/ joan) got out of the office at around 8pm, ate at sm foodcourt, bought a new mag &amp; read it a little before we went home.       now, it's a rainy morning. it's really no wonder my colds don't go away, coz when i left home awhile ago, mr. sun was up...& when i got to shaw it rained! tsk...tsk...tsk...&amp; now as i look outside, the clouds are very dark but the sun is shining! major wierdness!      well, it's almost 9...gotto work na...      free lunch nga pala kme later, lol!
