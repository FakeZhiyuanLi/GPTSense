      Well this is the first chance all day I have had to sit down and write.  My day started out waiting for the pest control people to come and when they didn't show up I called the apartment complex office to ask about it. I was told that they made a mistake on the dates and it was going to be tomorrow.  So I waited around for nothing and now have to do the whole thing over again tomorrow.  Some days like today I feel so lost. I mean I go about the day with normal things but it just seems like something is missing. Only I can't put my finger on it. I guess adult life if like that.  I did complete several candle orders today and shipped the ones from yesterday so I was very happy about that. Even though the orders keep coming in everyday it seems like there is no end. I would rather stay caught up though.  It is such an awful feeling to be losing the race.    urlLink link of the day

         I woke up this morning and had the most awesome sunflower! Grown from my very own hand from just a seed. At the same time I woke up to my laptop acting very strange! I have allot of work to do and today is my husbands birthday. I can't even give him a hug or anything else for that matter!! I still have so much to do before he gets home to prepare for the move but I really miss him. I hope he is having a good birthday even if he is so far from home. Chances are he is so busy with work that he simple doesn't have much time to think about it. The boys are so funny they woke me up so early to go outside this morning and now they are asleep again. But of course I can't go back sleep! I shouldn't anyway...I need to workout and get that outta the way and then I need to get busy making candles!      More later....        So much for the sun! It is pouring rain and it looks like another GA thunderstorm. I'm so borded with this weather. I saw the new people downstairs that are moving in and they were kind of stuck in the rain. They weren't moving in yet just looking around. As soon as they arrived the rain started!! Hope that isn't a sign...we already have enough grumpy people around here.    I'm almost done with all of the orders I currently have! I'm so happy about that. It would be nice to be caught up for a day or two. Not that I mind the work or the money...just need a small break I think.       urlLink    sunflower     urlLink link of the day

       I thought I would just start with posting a pic but now that it is here I'm wondering why I ever did that? Anyway..I'm counting down the days until dh returns. I know the time is going so slowly because I am so excited about the move. Since I grew up on the east coast I'm more than ready to see what is like on the west coast. All of the places I have visited I have loved so why should Washington be any different? Yeah..so it rains allot but there aren't as many bugs!! Seems like an even trade to me.   urlLink     urlLink link of the day

       Well...I'm still counting the days. They really seem to be creeping by. At moments I feel like time is standing still. Michelle and I went to the mall today. So many stores so little time! I have to say I did over shop a little. I became very excited about some of the sales the stores I love were having. It is also a proven fact that shopping makes you feel better and I needed that. Well...at least until you go to pay hahah well it doesn't matter I love everything that I bought.The weather is awful today...and it is so hot here. I can't wait to move...only 91 days to go and here we come Washington! The vacation time is going to be awesome. We have lots of time to spend with family in CA before and during Christmas. The hard part will be finding a place to live in WA. I refuse to rent something before seeing it no matter how nice it look on the net. I know that many people who are transferring do that but I'm just not willing to take that chance.    urlLink link of the day
