      I had a fellow employee ask me the other day what kind of books I like to read since I was reading  urlLink Robert Silverberg's Roma Eterna .  While I think Robert Silverberg is my favoriate author of all time, science fiction is not the only thing I read.  If I had to list my top 10 books or series of books, they would be (In no particular order):    urlLink The Chronicles of Narnia by C. S. Lewis    urlLink The Man in the Maze by Robert Silverberg    urlLink Great Expectations by Charles Dickens    urlLink The Winter King, Excaliber and Enemy of God by Bernard Cornwell    urlLink Lightning by Dean Koontz    urlLink Sphere by Micheal Crichton    urlLink Daughter of the Empire, Servant of the Empire and Mistress of the Empire by Raymond Feist and Janny Wurts    urlLink Cry, The Beloved Country by Alan Paton    urlLink Zoo Doings by Jack Prelutsky    urlLink The House with a Clock in it's Walls by John Bellairs

      A visit to the dentist yesterday brought back a whole world of memories for me. I took my daughter to the same dentist I had when I was a kid.  urlLink Dr. Kearns  is a great childrens and adolescent dentist. As I watched my daughter go through the whole cleaning, examine and florid process I was reminded of my own time in that little purple chair holding the little water game.  This was my daughters first visit and it was considerably better than my first visit. She had no cavities or problems. This is very different from my experiences as a child. I have weak teeth and I think my first visit yielded a cavity or two.  urlLink Dr. Kearns  was always gentle but firm and I think if I had had any other dentist, I would have quit going permanently. My daughter had the best first dental cleaning ever. No cavities, she received a goody bad (toothbrush, toothpaste, floss, stickers and a pencil) and had strawberry fluoride.  I would recommend  urlLink Dr. Kearns and Ashby  to anyone with children and hopefully the words of my daughter to the dentist "I'm never going to have ANY cavities!" will ring true.

      I have a business trip planned to begin 8/29/2004.  This trip involves flying to  urlLink Detroit ,  urlLink Michigan  and driving an hour to our hotel and crashing.  In the morning we will check out, drive 5 minutes to our clients site and spend the whole day there.  At the end of the day we will be driving almost 3 hours across the state to  urlLink Grand Rapids  and our 2nd hotel.  The next day, we will drive 10 minutes to a client site to train all day.  At the end of the day, it's back to the hotel where we will sleep, wake up the next day and drive 10 minutes to the airport and fly home.  This all sounds exhausting but I'm actually looking forward to the trip.  A fellow trainer will be going with me which will cut down on the boredom.  I will be to a new state I have never visited which is always exciting for me.  I will also be meeting people I have only dealt with on the phone up to this point which is also kind of exciting.  It's nice to put a face to a name and voice.  I will be updating my blog while on this trip since every trip I take happens to be filled with comedic problems and circumstances.  I'll have to tell you about the raccoon sometime.

      Being a fan of the original Aliens movies and, yes, I enjoyed the Predator movies, I decided to take the plunge and see Alien Vs. Predator (AVP).  I was actually expecting either a really cheesy movie or an extremely bad movie.  What I got was pure Hollywood mush, even though I was entertained.   Lets start with the problems:   The entire Alien mythology is more or less abandoned in this film.  The Predators brought them to Earth to hunt with using humans as "cattle" so they could host the eggs, what was that.  Bishop from Weyland Corp. Financing the expedition (they even had a brief moment of reference to the knife scene in Aliens) which I guess explains why the Nostromos was ordered to stop and investigate in Alien.  An Alien queen in chains, who came up with that idea?  This movie would have been more believable in terms of the mythology if they had been on some other planet and not in the present.  The Predators, it seems, are supposed to hunt Earth when it's hot according to the 2 movies.  Now all of a sudden they have some kind of special coming of age ritual in the Antarctic?  For being superior hunters, 2 of them sure got killed of real quick.  There was never any real explanation given for this temple they are in that is out in Antarctica.  We can't read the writers minds.   The good points -    The special effects were excellent even though a few more chest bursters would have been nice.  I loved the fact that the hero is a woman.  I wasn't actually expecting that. The story was at least coherent enough to follow even with some of the plot holes and mythology busting threads.  There was also just enough humor present and no silly sidekick.  I could go on but then I would spoil the movies for those of you who plan on watching it.  Out of 10 I would give this maybe a 5.

      Not too long ago a read a blog of one of my friends which was a rant on those annoying office people who you don't know but insist on making conversation with you.  He explained how they would say the usual, "Too bad it's Monday" and "Thank goodness it's Friday!" lines.  You all know what I'm talking about.  Well, today was slightly different becasue now all those superstitious people out there keep saying "It's Friday the 13th!".  What an annoying line to hear 40 times in one day.  It's not like Jason Vorhees is going to break through the security at your office and start hacking away at people.  You probably didn't wake up with an extra limb or without an existing one.  Your day has probably been the same typical rat race as always only with the phrases involving Friday the 13th thrown in every 5 minutes reminding you that you should have woken up to nothing but bad luck.  Well, Happy Friday the 13th!!!

      I seem to forget frequently about many a things I take for granted. For instance the stars. My sister in law was married last Friday and some of her new husbands relatives came over to my in-laws to stay a few nights after the wedding. The night they came up, I met them at the local grocery store so I could escort them through Purgatory (which is the name of the road out to my in-laws). Since this is country, getting lost is easier than preparing a 4 course meal.  So I lead these people to the in-laws (who by-the-way are almost completely surrounded by fields). When they got out of their cars everyone looked up. It was a picture perfect crystal clear starry night. They were all in awe at the number of stars they could see and stood around gawking for about 10 minutes. These people are all from Long Island, New Jersey and other locals in and near New York City.  After witnessing this little spectacle, I have made a point to notice all those things which I took for granted before. I may be far away from the luxuries most people take for granted, but I think I'm closer to those things others never notice. Reading Isaac Asimov/Robert Silverberg's  "Nightfall" , made this feeling even more apparent.

      Yesterday I had to take the day off since my kids daycare was closed.  Well, I can work at home, provided there are no kids to feed, change, discipline, coddle, read too, talk too, switch TV channels for and mediate arguments for.  I think I answered 2 emails yesterday for work.  Enter, Today!  I have 79 emails to answer (not counting the ones I could delete without reading) and still counting.  I have to give credit to those people who 1) work at home or 2) own their own business.  I can't imagine the stress level these people must feel.   I usually do extra work at home every night, but only after the kids are in bed, my wife's in bed and my TV shows are over (being that it is summer time this is not a big deal).

      Well, this is going to be my first attempt at this. The more and more I read blogs, the more I want to join the little community. It almost reminds me of the movie "Pump up the Volume", except any one can listen, err, read...
