      After viewing several others' pages and experiencing the hype of following a blog, I am interested to see how all this works. Who knows where this blog will go. Or if it will even continue to exist. We'll find out I guess.  Cheers.

      I managed to waste 1.5 hours tonight trying to tune a snare drum.  Me and a friend were supposed to practice for a while, but upon arriving at the kit, found that the tuning was way off on the snare. We tried for a while by ourselves before calling my brother, who happens to know how to tune. He gave us some advice that we thought would work. But a few minutes later, we had him back on the phone. More info was given... more stuff was tried... more time was wasted. Finally I got in touch with a drummer friend in town who said he could swing by and help us out. So we practiced for a bit with blown out tuning until he arrived.  He showed up about 20 minutes later, and after spending under 10 minutes with the drum, got it tuned. Not only was I jealous, I was also peeved and annoyed at myself for wasting all that time. I really dislike letting time go to waste. Oh well. At least it's tuned.  My Take?  A genuine waste of time. "If you can't do something, get someone who can." A quote I could've used about 6 PM...

      After thorough contemplation, I have decided upon a direction for this site. The content will be little stories from work, home, things I see in public, etc., as well as stuff about movies, music, etc. Basically I'll write something out and then tell you what I think ("My Take") of the thing written about. "My Take" could be a few sentences of how I stand on a certain issue, or it may be a rating of sorts. This could turn out to be a flop, but it's an appealing idea in theory, so I'm going to go for it.

      Well, I haven't been updating as much as I would like. I've got movies, music, and a trip to review. Since there's a lot of stuff to cover, let's get right down to it.   MOVIES   Matchstick Men  A great movie. I thoroughly enjoyed it. The only that I can remember that I didn't like was the ending. Starting with him in the carpet store. I can't really say what I didn't like about it. There was just a different feel to it. Sorry I can't elaborate.   Peter Pan  Wow. I had heard wonderful things about this movie, and they were true. I liked the fact that there wasn't any big actors. Just a bunch of unknowns. It was kinda cool. As far as I remember, it wasn't cheesy at all. Even the special effects were well done. I also liked the use of color throughout the movie. Go see it.   Van Helsing  I wasn't super keen on seeing this, but my dad was, so we went. Actually, it wasn't that bad. Of course, if you're not into the out-there fiction, you wouldn't like it. I didn't mind it, though. There wasn't really that much cheesy stuff that bothered me. One thing that there was a lot of was the I-know-it's-coming-but-I-don't-know-when scenes. Like when it's really quiet and he's walking down a hall, and you know something's coming, but it still gets you. There was at least 9 of these. It kept me on my toes, though, so it wasn't horrible. I probably wouldn't see it again any time soon, but overall it was a halfway decent film.   Shawshank Redemption  I know I'm way behind the times on this one, but as I can't watch R rated movies, I haven't seen it until tonight when it was on the telly. I really liked it. I loved the emotion that was intertwined throught it. I really grew to hate Mr. Warden, and really hoped that Dufresne would get the justice due him. I haven't done much filming, so I can't comment on the cinematography, but I liked the feel the movie had. There were several extra cool shots. The whole movie reminded me of "Escape from Alcatraz" and "The Great Escape", both of which I loved. There were some great scenes where the music was just right. The ending was wonderful. This is another go-see.   MUSIC  Some bands and songs that have found themselves being played quite often on my iTunes...   Air       Surfing on a Rocket      Mike Mills  Snow Patrol       Chocolate      Run  The Trash Can Sinatras       How Can I Apply  Ben Folds       Annie Waits      Zak and Sara  Electric Light Orchestra       Evil Woman      Shine a Little Love      Telephone Line      Don't Bring Me Down      Showdown  Grandaddy       Now It's On      Lost on Yer Merry Way  Jet       Look What You've Done  The Jayhawks       Blue  Keane       Everybody's Changing      Bend & Break      Snowed Under  The Postal Service       This Place is a Prison  Sondre Lerche       Days That Are Over  The Stills       Gender Bombs  The Strokes       The End Has No End      I Can't Win   TRIP  I had an orthodontist appointment on Tuesday, so me and my dad headed to Milwaukee. Our first stop was at the Milwaukee Museum to view the IMAX documentary of Everest. Little did we know, until we entered the theater, that it was a dome IMAX. The screen was all over.   Being as how the movie was going to have high-altitude shots, we were both a bit worried. The way the seats are set up, there's no heads of the people in front of you in the way. So it's just you and that giant screen. We decided to tough it out. But then the previews started... Wow. I didn't think I would make it. Not all heights bother me, but there was a load of shots that made me feel like I was going to fall out of my seat. It's a very realistic experience. There was a bit of eye-closing going on for those first few minutes.  Once the movie got started and the camera was moving slower, it wasn't too bad. Once you get used to it, it's not really that huge of a deal. It was a pretty interesting documentary.   After that we headed to a place called Real Chili. We had seen it on the Food Channel several months back in a list of the Top 10 Dives in the U.S. It was a trip...  The room is set up so that everything is open and everyone looks at each other. There's no booths or anything. It's a big square U-shaped counter facing inward, where the food is located. You can have your chili plain, or with spaghetti noodles. Feeling daring, we both took the noodles. It wasn't bad. Nothing all that outstanding, but nothing wrong with it either.   Our waitress was another story. She was freaky. She looked weird and just had a different mannerism about her.   It was definitely an experience. We both agreed that we probably wouldn't go back. Besides being eerie, it was actually quite expensive. It's worth going once I guess, but doesn't warrant a return trip by any means.   I'll try to be better from now on with updating...

      I need to correct my comment about the color palette in the Hives' video. There's also a dark green in there, which I may have thought was black. Sometimes it looks like their pants/drums/shirts are black, and other times they're green. So I don't actually know what or when it is. If anyone's figured out this mystery, do us all a favor and post a comment. Thanks...  In case you hadn't heard, Badly Drawn Boy's new album, One Plus One Is One is coming out on 27 July. You can stream previews of the songs  urlLink here.  I haven't listened to it much so I don't have an opinion. But check it out anyways. It may prove promising.  Good day.

      The Hives just released a new music video for their latest song, Walk Idiot Walk, yesterday. I watched it on iTunes tonight a couple times and think it's cool.  I don't know alot about the Hives, and can only say that "Hate to Say..." is the only other song I know by them. But I like "Hate to Say..." and the video wasn't all that bad. I like this one much better though.  The first thing I liked about this vid was the color used. Going with a color palette consisting of white, black, and red looks great. I very much like those colors together anyway, so it didn't take much for me to like them here.  Second thing I liked was the guitarist on the right's movements. He was like this in the "Hate to Say..." vid and I just found it to be amusing. It was a bit different in this vid, but was still fun to watch.  Third thing was the lead singer walking on the wall. Now maybe some of you are saying that's what you DIDN'T like in the video, but I thought it was cool and very well-done. I especially liked it when he came down and was singing to the drummer, who was listening intently. That was amusing as well.  That's all the observations I have for now. There may be something else that I'm missing, but that's okay. All in all, this is a pretty cool song with a more-than-pretty cool video.   Oh yeah, and if you want to watch this for yourself, I'm sure it's on the web somewhere, or if you have iTunes, you can just click  urlLink here.

      I've got 2 things for you to read. First order of business?...   urlLink Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone  As this is a 2001 film, no doubt you know the basic plot, or maybe you've even seen it. So I'll spare you the details and cut to the chase with my take.  First off, I'd just like to say that I enjoyed watching this very much. It was cool because the whole plot came across as being serious, but because of the targeted audience, was presented in a semi-children's movie sort of way. Maybe it was just my attitude towards it, but I liked the fact that the suspense wasn't edge-of-the-seaty. I more had a good time following the characters and their humor, than concerning myself with the trials they faced. Most movies seem to end up how you would expect them to, i.e., the good guy wins. But even though you "know" the outcome sometimes, there is a way in which the director can convince you otherwise, or just make the "already known" journey a bit more unknown or suspenseful. With this one, I didn't feel that and just relaxed. Now it's quite possible that I'm reading into this too much, but, hey, this is my take, and if you have a prob, Bob, post a comment. (I hope I'm not coming off like "Them are fightin' words"...)  My only real pet peeve about the movie was the graphics. They were cheesy in several places. Now, I know, this was made in 2001, and the movie is more geared towards kids, but I still hold my ground.  Whew! All this writing is tiring me out... Oh yeah, where was I? Potter. Right.  In conclusion, I really liked this film and am eagerly awaiting the return of the DVD of #2 to Family Video.   Now, for post #2...   Red Light Runner  During my vacation, I was able to catch up on reading the July edition of Macworld. I'm not exactly sure why I started to get these, but they keep coming in the mail, so I just keep reading them. I think it's because of my .mac account. Either way, I've really enjoyed reading them the past few months. There's always some good tips, tricks, and reviews. I'm drifting off again, aren't I. Focus, mate.  Anyhow, I came across an advertisement for a certain Red Light Runner. They sell vintage Apple items. I checked them out and found out that they've actually got some rather cool stuff. The coolest was a set of posters they did for a "Think Different" campaign of theirs. Man, they're awesome. I picked out 6 that'd I'd love to make a wall decoration of. Unfortunately, they're butt expensive, so unless I come into some massive cash, I'll just have to be content with staring at them on my computer. Here they are in all their brilliance...   urlLink Albert Einstein    urlLink Alfred Hitchcock    urlLink Pablo Picasso    urlLink Thomas A. Edison    urlLink Old Blue Eyes    urlLink Ansel Adams   If anyone wants to make donation, I'm going to need about $1200 or so to make this dream a reality. No takers? Dang.

      After viewing this film this afternoon, I'm not quite sure what to think of it. My initial reaction (and probably what I would feel if I watched it again) is that I really enjoyed it. But I'm a bit undecided. I really would have to see it again to make any concrete conclusions.  I watched the trailer not too long ago, and it looked okay, but didn't seem like something that would be super fantastic or anything. So I wasn't expecting too much. I can say one thing for sure, Tom Hanks did a superb acting job. The accent wasn't bad, and the mannerism that you would expect from such a foreigner was right on. And the humor I thought to be excellent as well. I smiled/laughed quite a few times.  As I watched the movie, I found myself liking the little side journeys of the other characters. Such as the lunch man and the admissions officer, or whatever you want to call her. Seeing as how it's a 2 hour and 10 minute movie, I was glad for the things that diverted attention from Tom Hanks' dilemma. I think focusing just on that for an extended period of time may get boring.   I enjoyed watching the relationship between Victor and the janitor unfold. The janitor comes across as a very stay-away-from-me kind of person at the beginning and is very skeptical of Victor, but as the movies continues, they both learn to understand each other a bit better I think. The turnaround of the head security guard's attitude towards Victor was cool to see as well.  As for Catherine Zeta-Jones' character, again I'm a bit torn. Shane Spicer over at  urlLink The Big Crit   (they "Review Life", and are extremely knowledgeable and entertaining about it) brings up a good point about Victor's association with her.   Maybe it's just me and I'm way off my nut, but did Catherine ZJ remind anyone else of Meg Ryan? I thought that to myself several times.   So those are my thoughts after the first viewing. Maybe when it comes to DVD in a few months, I'll watch it again and review it. Go see it and if you feel like it, write a comment for this post about your thoughts.

      I'll keep this short and sweet. I just got done watching this film and felt like writing about it. I've seen it before, but it's been a long time. I had forgotten just how funny it was. I won't go into describing the plot or anything, but if you want to see a hilarious movie, well, this one may be for you. It is for me.

      While at Silver Dollar City, I picked up a set of Mystix. A set consists of 2 "control sticks" and a baton. The control sticks are about 16" long and the baton is about 17" or 18" long, with decorative tassels on the end. All the sticks are made out of a rubber-type material. The object is basically to throw the baton between the 2 control sticks. But that "throw between" is just the start. Once you get good at manipulating the baton, you can start to flip it around in creative ways. The guys at SDC had some awesome moves. They'll do these really huge flips and twirls, behind the back, between the legs, you name it. The key to mastering these is balance and hand-eye coordination, and these guys had them down pat. It's a very fluid sport (if that's what you call it).  They were only $30 so I picked them up and have grown almost addicted to them. It's great fun. I've toyed with the idea of shooting some video clips and posting them. We'll see what tomorrow brings...  I'm off to see The Terminal, and I've got some more to write about the trip, so there'll be some more to read, sooner or later (said like David Brent of The Office).

      This theme park was our main reason for the trip. It's been a family tradition for the past 20 years. My bro and sis-in-law made the trip up from Tulsa to join us, so we had almost the whole family together.   In case you're not familiar with Silver Dollar City, I found a great description of it on their website. Here it is...  "Silver Dollar City, located in Branson, Missouri, combines the wholesome family fun of a major theme park with the timeless appeal of crafts and a dedication to preserving 1880s Ozarks culture. Nearly 100 craftsmen are on park demonstrating glass blowing, basket weaving, blacksmithing, pottery, candy making, candle making, and many other disciplines. Packed with 17 rides and attractions, 60 unique shops and restaurants, and 50 dazzling shows a day Silver Dollar City truly appeals to all ages. It also hosts four major festivals per year and was named one of the Top Theme Parks in The World by the International Association of Amusement Parks and Attractions."  On top of the roller-coasters and other attractions, there's also a very unique attraction, Marvel Cave. You get to take an underground tour of it and everything. It's pretty cool. Another cool thing of the park is pretty much everything is old-fashioned looking. The craftsmen all have long beards (unless they're women...) that they've been growing for who knows how many decades, their clothes are straight out of the 19th century, and the rides are all geared towards that feel also. It's very family-oriented and the majority of the employees truly seem to love their jobs and make your experience there an amazing one. You just feel good being in the environment.   So if you're ever in Branson and have a day or two to kick around, check out Silver Dollar City. I think you'll have a great time.

      We stayed at the Branson Towers hotel during our trip. It's been the location of our stays for the past few times. It's a fine establishment, and has a great location. And with a decent, free continental breakfast, and great rates, it's hard to go wrong.  My only quarrel is that they aren't quite up to par with their technology. I'm a techno freak to some people and such things as high-speed wireless internet are standard for me. Not wanting to be too disappointed, I even set my expectations lower and decided I would settle for high-speed, wired access. Unfortunately, they had neither. Their alternative was dial-up. Give me a break. I actually attempted to use it, but it was a bit of hassle and was going to be expensive, so I canned it. I don't think I could have stood the frustration of a 30-50k connection either. I just don't quite have the patience for that.  To end on a positive note, the arcade, or rather the pinball they had, was pretty rad. The pinball was Big Hurt. It's baseball-themed and was extremely addicting and fun for me and my fam. Lots of quarters went into that game, and lots of free games were won in return. I think it's the second closest experience I've had to gambling (not something I plan on ever doing).   I'm sure we'll stay there again as we're creatures of habit, so my hope for the Branson Towers is that they get with it and install high-speed internet. That'll just make the already-good experience better.

      Last night I returned home from a family trip to the grand city of Branson, Missouri. We were there from Monday to Friday, so quite a bit happened in between. As such, I've got a few items to write about. Rather than put it all into a huge blog like last time, I figured I'd just break it up into separate posts. With that being said, let the reading begin!

      Tonight was interesting. It was raining out, but it was super, super light. No thunder, no lightning. Nothing. All of a sudden the power goes out. It was weird seeing as how the storm wasn't even a storm to speak of.  The funny thing was how we reacted. We all slipped up and did something like flip a lightswitch or try to get on the computer to adjust our calendars or something. It's amazing how much our lives are centered around electricity isn't it? I mean, it was like, now what do we do!   Actually, it was kinda cool because most all the stuff we had to do required electricity. So we just sat around. Generally speaking, all responsibilities were put on hold. That's a cool feeling when you're constantly doing stuff.   Unfortunately (funny how our perspectives change with time), the power came back after about 15 or 20 minutes. And then it was back to the regular ho-hum.  In the end, I was glad for the obligated relaxation time as it was much needed. I think I need to start scheduling time like that into my iCal. Who's with me?

      Here's some songs that have been rocking me lately. They're not in order of most fave to least fave or anything. They're just all good. The list is in order of artist, song, and then album.     1.  Blue States | The Last Blast | The Soundings   I can't remember exactly how I found this band. It was either through the New Music Tuesdays email from iTunes, or under the Listeners Also Bought column on another band's page. Either way, I've got 5 songs from the album pegged for listening on my Wish List, two of which I've bought. This one has a great chord progression, great instrumentation, and has just really clicked with me.    2.  Josh Rouse | Comeback (Light Therapy) | 1972   This one was found via iTunes Music Video section. The bass line is way rad. I like the laid back feel that the song has, especially on the first part of the verses. The guitar that comes in at 0:41 is killer.    3.  Rachael Yamagata | Worn Me Down | EP   Whit George led me to this song through one of his blog posts. I've thoroughly enjoyed listening to it.     4.  Pink Floyd | Another Brick in the Wall, Pt. 2 | The Wall   What can you say about a classic like this? The groove on this song just rocks. I can't help but start bobbing my head, or entire body for that matter, when I hear this song. Man it's cool.    5.  Magnet | Where Happiness Lives | On Your Side   Amazing guitar parts and ambience on this one. It's a very emotional song, especially the chorus. This one has to be cranked to get the full effect.     6.  Travis | Mid-Life Krysis | 12 Memories   Now, just as a disclaimer, I'm not endorsing this album by any means. Overall, I don't really like 12 Mems, but there's a couple like this one that are alright. BUT, I don't think it sounds very much like Travis, and being a very big fan of old stuff, I just can't get into the new stuff like I can the old.   About the song though, I had heard it before when I spun the album, and it popped into my head this week, and when I played it again, I got into it. I like the loud siren-like thing on the chorus.     7.  The King of France | The Beast | Untitled   Once again, this is an iTunes find. Thank you Steve Jobs and Apple for the incredible program you've created. This band was on Edward Norton's Celebrity playlist and I've only got this song, but I've liked it quite a bit. I think the thing I like most about it is the intro. It's a killer. There's some great licks and a solid groove as well.    8.  The Flaming Lips | A Change at Christmas Time (Say It Isn't So) | Ego Tripping... EP   The Lips are one of my all-time favorite bands and they hit the mark as far as I'm concerned with this tune. I think the thing that drew me at first to this song was the lyrics. It's well-thought and I would hope, heartfelt.     9.  Sixpence None the Richer | Don't Dream It's Over | Divine Discontent    I'm not sure I knew this was a remake till just recently. We play Christian music videos via satellite for Oneighty and I saw this one and just fell in love with the feel it has. Cool groove, great chord progression, and an excellent cover by Sixpence. I heard the original the other day and it didn't even compare to this.    10.  Nada Surf | Hi-Speed Soul | Let Go   The first time I spun this album, I didn't find many musical treasures, but I gave it another try when Whit blogged about this tune and another. I have no idea how I missed this one. Whatever the case was, I am a huge fan of it now. Thanks for letting me know about this winner-of-a-song, Whit.    So, that's that. The comment board is wide open, so lemme know what you think of these, whether you've heard them before or not.

       Background  The Kohler Co. deposits my paycheck into my account rather than sending me an actual check, which is halfway nice I guess. It was supposed to be a “time-saving experience”, cos you don’t have to go to the bank to cash your check, but since I’m a picky person who needs EXACT numbers of bills, it’s not as time-saving as it’s supposed to be. I also deal with cash more than my checking account. You may be saying, Why don’t you just go to the ATM instead of the bank? Because the ATM only dishes out 20s. That doesn’t work.  Because I need exact bills, I have started writing out the exact denominations I need. Like ten 5s, three 10s, four 20s, etc. That way the teller doesn’t give me 50s and 100s which don’t work for me.   Story  So being in need of some greenbacks, I Post-It noted the total amount, the denominations, and my account number and headed to the bank. Once I got there, I sent my Post-It note and account card to the teller.   Now, for being Kohler owned, I don’t think this bank does all that great of a job. I don’t know if 5 diamond banks exist, but I think that basic things like name usage should be exercised anywhere. The only people that use my name on a consistent basis are “Teller 12” (I don’t know her name) and 2 other ladies.   Anyways, this time I didn’t even get a greeting. I was a bit surprised, but just went with it. When the slip-to-sign came out, I signed and sent it back. I promptly got my money sent back, and as I was unloading the plastic tube, I thought, “Wow, they haven’t even talked to me!” Usually they’ll tell me to sign and whatnot.  I figured I’d at least get a farewell, but nooo, I didn’t even get that. I couldn’t believe it. No communication whatsoever during the entire transaction. I came home and thought about how blown out it was.   I just thought it was very weird and my question is, where the heck is the personal touch to our daily transactions going? Who knows. But I hope it’s not going far, cos that would just suck.
