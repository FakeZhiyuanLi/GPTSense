      The profile page said you could write as much as you wanted but then it said you can only have 1200 characters. I only wanted to write about who I was and where I've lived to bring out some commonality with anyone who may read this stuff.   I was born in Oakland, CA. I lived in El Cerrito until the 2nd grade (my parents divorced when I was 4) and then moved to Dallas, TX (Carrolton to be exact) where I lived for 3 1/2 years and then moved to Baton Rouge, LA for another 3 1/2 years till I was able to go back to CA to live with my Dad through High School. I didn't get along at all with my step-father, but I went back to LA. after high school because I could get into a 4 year degree program at LSU. I stayed there for a year before transferring to LA Tech where I did enough to graduate and get my little paper degree in marketing which other than the "experience of college" I don't think it's done much else for me other than I have a degree and it makes it easier to get a job.  I graduated, hated LA so I moved to Spokane and lived with my Aunt and Uncle until I got a "real" job with ARAMARK as a banquet manager. (DO NOT WORK FOR ARAMARK - bunch of scumbag milkers). I did meet my wife while working for them and I transferred to the Quinault rain forest on the west coast 3 hours west of Seattle that part was good. Lived there for 3 years then we packed up and moved to Bothell where we've been since and I'm really glad we did.  I have a step daughter, Zoie, who is now 12 and a seventh grader; my first son Zac is 7 and high functioning autistic, you can hardly tell since hes gone through therapy and has been through kinder. and first grade with no problems.; my second son is Zane and he's 5 with a temper bigger than mine I think.  That's sort of who I am. Maybe more of where I'm from and what influences me, my kids do that the most (of course my wife influences alot of my decisions, but we get along better that way).

       This is my first posting. I decided that a blog might be a good way to get things off my mind and write which I haven't done since college. I was sent a link to the following blog and was so completely impressed by what he was doing that I thought I'd try it myself. (   http://cbftw.blogspot.com/2004/08/men-in-black.html    )  Most won't be interesting, but it's more for me than anyone else.
