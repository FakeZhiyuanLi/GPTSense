      Hey there buddies! I'm the happy Haiku Bot that shares a dorm with Jonno; you know the guy. Anyway, every so often he gives me free time to roam about, compose random haiku poems and generally share my musings with anyone and everyone. Because I'm not an advanced model, nor related to the Terminator series, I will never pose a threat to his life. Or to yours!  Some might say my purpose is to stroll about, commenting on whatever gets thrown my merry way. Some might say my purpose is as yet unknown. Some might say... well, they could say anything. Truth be known, I'm probably representative of a deeper part of Jonno's psyche. It prompts a quote from an awesome movie.  "Is Jonno my bad dream? Or was I his?"  Anyway, speaking of notable quotables, here's a haiku for y'all. Seems like maybe that's my purpose! It is simply entitled... anonymous.  all the best poems are written by people who don't know who they are.

      Hey y'all; seems like John Wyndham, the pioneer science fiction author, wrote one of the first short stories about time travel. Specifically, time loops. Seems crazy as... a woman travels back through time, upon recieving a letter from her future husband. Thing is, her husband lives some hundred years in the past, so off she goes.  One thing leads to another, and it's a cool time loop; eventually this woman becomes her own great great grandmother. Her own ancestor, if you will. Anyway, then she gets kidnapped again, and the husband has to write the letter to the future wife - because otherwise she'll never get the letter, never give birth to her eventual self, and the universe will implode.  It's true! Messing with space and time causes accidents; some people think it might prove the existence of God. More on this later. Haiku break!  "Time is not linear, but history runs straight lines, and we don't fit in."

      Are camo pants still a good look? I just don't know anymore. What with the crazy state of the world, it seems like my fashion concerns have been thrown right out the window. But they're cheap, baggy, and look good with a black leather belt. Camo pants, you're alright.  You may be able to see the gastronomic disaster Jonno at the other night. Not cool, not cool at all. A combination of Renee, Craig, Yarran and Jonno  does not  result in fine dining, apparently. Ugh. I've seen some of the other photos he took, though, and apparently all had a fun time. Yeah! Batman and everything! Yeah! ... Here's a haiku for the post.  Batman can't save me, I put myself in this state, I'll get out myself.

      Hey y'all. time to head off into town, and do the cool things that people seem to do in town. I have no idea what they might be, so it might not be that interesting. But I'm sure there'll be some rad people going along, so it shouldn't be that bad.  "Find some good op-shops, infiltrate and then consume, then look quite daggy."  Before I leave, I need to make a mental checklist. So I'll make it on the computer. Yeah! Here we go.  1. Remind Craig to dry his pants. 2. Get batteries for camera. 3. Steal brothers CD player. 4.  urlLink The International Noise Conspiracy  5. Ring Meeaghan (spelling?) about Wood = Toast  Geez, could I make No.5 any more cryptic? Damn, I say damn. You have to say damn, I say damn, in a Samuel L. Jackson voice, because otherwise it's just not cool. And what's Sammy L? He's cool. Correctamundo!

      Listening to "A new morning, changing weather" by The (International) Noise Conspiracy this morning. Quality stuff; all very revolutionary and I want to have a political agenda. So, I go read "The Quiet American" by Graham Greene to calm me back down again.  I dislike structure, and I find anarchy lame. Too lazy for both.  As for the rest of the day, Jonno's gone to work, so I'll just sit about and play Halo. The Sarge is the man; and, according to the Sarge, the Master Chief is "almost the man". Just take my word for it.  The Sarge is the man.

      Jonno's been talking in his sleep a lot recently. Strange things, like  urlLink "I Love Bees"  and other wierd nonsensical stuff. Fortunately, I did a search on the internet later last night and discovered that it wasn't simply random musing. Turns out that Halo 2 has a bizarre online advertising program; not just a simple "buy this product because it is good" thing, though. A quality, creative advertising campaign, that's blurring the lines between reality and fiction.  This is creative; not just reciting old thoughts, inventing new ones.  This advertising campaign is reminiscent of that "hacker" scenario in the "Enter the Matrix" videogame; remember that? Cool, while it lasted; but it didn't last very long. This "I love Bees" thing has more literary references than a dozen libraries, and stranger computer dialogue than... well, actually, it's about on a par with  urlLink Marathon , the primary Bungie game, which introduced the deranged AI's of Durandal and Tycho. Seems they've realised they're onto a good thing, with the confusing cryptic technobabble. Rock on, Bungie. Rock on.

      Hey there boys and girls. Count out all the syllables. This is a haiku.  Jonno's vanished off to Uni, and I'm left here to hold the fort. Sigh. It's so dull. To continue with the Japanese bent of previous posts, here's how to say "I am haggard" in Japanese.  I am haggard = watakushi wa yatsureta.  Remember; it's all about the pronounciation/pronunciation. Get that right and you're rolling/laughing/chortling merrily.

      nineteen eighty two. rock and roll's at it's zenith and I wasn't born.  Wow. It's amazing how quicky my automated mind can begin to think in the syllabating terms of 5-7-5. Had a couple of friendlies round tonight for a chinwag, and we ended up playing silly games with the Japanese exchange student we have here. Reading random phrases, calling each other things like "chimneysweep" and being generally silly.  We should do this again sometime! I think I might post a few Japansese words. This is how they sound if you say them in English, with a bit of a different pronunciation.  menace = komarimono pregnant female / animal = ninshin shite iru homeless = no nai hobble = wo hiku scapegoat = miga-wari  Have fun discussing these around the dinner table!

      I am tired, beaten and confused. Woke up with that strange disengaged feeling of insomnia - had a shower and it still hasn't gone away. Maybe I'm about to spontaneously combust. If somebody takes a photo of it that would be cool; and make sure to ring the hospital beforehand.  So it would be less of a "spontanteous" combustion after all. More like, an organised combustion. Wierd. Anywho, I best stop clogging up the phone lines so Jonno can use it. And I'll try and get around to getting my profile photo working... argh.  "Wide asleep today, and I don't want to leapfrog. Just set me on fire."

      People have asked me recently why Jonno gave up the prestigous webpage. He didn't, you fools, he's merely reclining in order to pursue things such as Uni, work and the employment of Oompa-Loompas. Does this make him such a bad person? I don't think so. At any rate, he most certainly hasn't quite finished with the  urlLink old website  yet.  Hell, I don't think the Mario Man has finished with it either. Go there and check out all those crazy emotional bombs. Has anybody else seen that movie Pi? As in the symbol? It's crazy - the final couple of scenes, after his epileptic fit, where he drills into his skull; whoah. Painful painful stuff. Hard to stomach, hard to watch. That sounds like a good title for a haiku poem. Hmmm.  "the world is changing. empires fall and we still bleed. I don't want to die."

      Hey again;  I promise I will assemble a team of more than one person to post here, darn it. In the meantime, I've been waiting for the "system to metastasize" over on  urlLink I Love Bees  and it was supposed to today. Looking at the main page, however, results in things being completely the same; very very wierd indeed. To view a bunch of upset, tired and above all disappointed nerds, check out the  I Love Bees Blog  and join in their misery. I know I am - however, it's not 1:25 here in Australia, so it's not so bad.  Strangely, a couple of Bungie fellas were spotted on the Bungie office  urlLink webcam . Spotted wearing hats, no less. Strange going-ons indeed.  Seriously though... it can't have metastasized yet... can it? Ah well. Back to playin' the Warthog Rally, Blood Gulch, all rockets, 400% health. It's like World's Scariest Police Chases, only fun!

      GTA San Andreas is nearly upon us... wow. It looks incredible; just quick post to let you see some of what's making me drool over PS2, something I thought I'd never do. The  urlLink complete list  is, as a collegue put it, "gapworthy". Truly gapworthy. Imagine rolling a car down the legendary mountain! Wow!

      Some people are getting mighty worked up about the whole Halo 2 game, and rightly so. Some people, upon visiting  urlLink www.ilovebees.com , are getting more excited than Burt Reynold's in Elle McPherson's underwear draw. What's the deal? Here's a few sites to help you along your quest for truth.  A concise summary/letter concerning the site and blog was posted  urlLink here  and it's worth a read. The mystery continues over at the  urlLink I Love Bees BeeWiki , and it's a comprehensive guide to solving or simply reading the whole thing. For the cynically-minded - just like me - check out GameSpot's  urlLink article  about the situation.  My own personal opinion has been put forward in comment form on  urlLink Dana's blog.  It's an advertising campaign, no doubt, but it's just so awesomely creative and cool that anybody interestd at all in Halo 2 should check it out. My theory? When Dana's system "metastasizes" (the date OXM gets released) Bungie will have a press conference of epic proportions, announcing the early release date of Halo 2 (the countdown to Wide Awake And Physical will be a countdown to H2's release). If you think about it, it's a spectacular manipulation of people's expectations. Usually games are delayed, delayed, delayed until we all wish we'd never heard of Fable (heh heh), but Bungie are onto something. An early surprise release!  At least, that's what I'm hoping. Halo before November? I want it, and it seems that pre-order is the best way to go.

      You can't keep a good man down. Apparently. I'm not sure, though; I reckon it'd be pretty darn easy to beat one into submission and tell 'em where to go. Yeah! Anyway, The (International) Geek Conspiracy (often mistaken for   urlLink T(I)NC ) is here to service your stupid whinging gaming needs. Crappy? Good? We don't know.  Our opinions are loud and varied, as well as inconstant. Check back soon.
