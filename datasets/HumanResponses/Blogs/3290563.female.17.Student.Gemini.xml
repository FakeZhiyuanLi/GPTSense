      Meh I've been sick ever since Thursday. I hate being sick and I find it weird because I haven't been sick at all this past winter. But trust me to catch a cold at the start of summer. Today hasn't really been eventful to say the least. Nothing much happened. My family and I did go out to the movies to see Shrek 2. I'm sure it was hilarious, but for some reason, no parts made me laugh. I faked a laugh here and there, but other than that...no. Maybe it's because I'm sick? I dunno. I found it to be strange. I usually laugh at the smallest things. *cough* If anyone replies to that with a smartass comment...  I'm becoming really emotional and I don't know why. I think I do...but then I don't because I have 10 more days to go til...that time. Ladies know all about it. I love saying that word lol. Ladies. I think it's really cute. Carly has exams Tuesday and everytime she's on she's studying, and I hope she passes all of them. I know she will because she's one smart cookie and I love her to death!  Today was the first day in like....four days I think that I talked to Laura. I guess we're both just really busy. Lol. Right. I hardly get on MSN anymore and that's because of work, and because I've been sick. Meh I dunno. I hope that we talk more though. I have a feeling tomorrow will be another day where we don't talk because I have to drop my brother off at the airport in Richmond and that's about an hour's drive there, and an hour's drive back, and then I have to go to work at 3. I wish I could get someone to cover for me again, but I need the money.  I want to be 18 so badly. Which reminds me...happy birthday Brandon! lol. But yea. I seriously need to get away from here. Nothing bad has happened...but it's just time to go some place new. Some place better than where I'm at now. I wonder how Chris, Crys, and Meli are doing. I haven't talked to them in about a month and a half which really makes me sad.  The ex keeps visiting me. I don't answer the door though and I think it's starting to piss him off because he'll just stay there for like an hour or two and just knock. But he only does it when no one else is home. He must have great timing. It amuses me, yet at the same time, scares me. He could easily come in if he wanted to but I guess the thought of two big dogs guarding the house scares him a little. *sigh* But there's only so much knocking one can take before you feel like you just want to fucking scream and kill someone. I'm gonna answer the door. I can't begin to imagine what he must want.  Much love

      Something I wrote today in school for the hell of it...It's really stupid:  As I watch the colors of the sunset play with the shadows of the coming night, I can't help but think about my life and how much I've changed; How much the people around me have changed. Things have happened that made me realize I  am  strong, I  am  weak, and I  can  pull through.  Sometimes it's hard to open up to the one person who means everything to me, and shutting her out is my only choice. But that one person knows how to crack open my shell and crawl into my mind and soul within a matter of minutes, something that comes easily to her, but is quite a challenge for others.  I've changed. No. Not on the outside. And I guess that's why my friends have never known what I'm really capable of. I've changed on the inside. A revolution, a turning point for my thoughts, emotions and most importantly, my soul. And that's another thing. My friends have never really seen  me , who I really am. They can't look into my eyes and see my core, unlike the popular saying. That immortal part of who I am, is off limits, a barrier built up over time to shield me from the fire that I know will kill me. That I know will haunt me.  I've learned that no matter how high those walls are, someone always has a way of making it tumble to the ground, leaving me with nothing more but a heap of heartache, pain and sorrow. But I've also learned a way to deal with that crumbled wall that left me exposed and seemingly helpless. And this results in the inevitable question...why? To be honest, there is no answer that will ever satisfy the human being. All I have to say, to give, is advice. Once you start trying to kill the thing on the inside, by hurting yourself on the outside, there is  no  going back.  Never has the gentle wind caressed my face, nor has the sun shone brightly on me, leading me to my rightful place. Instead, I'm left to be consumed by this inalienable darkness, this restricting force that forbids me to breathe and dream freely. I know I've got an old soul. I also know how purely my aura glows. It's the only light that reminds me of how brave I've been these sixteen years, and how much pain I've gone through.  As I watch droplets of stardust rain down upon the slumbering city, I can't help but smile as the moon engulfs us all into her warm pools of serenity. It's times like these when I know I'm going to be alright.

      It was just my luck that at the end of the day while I was walking down the stairs in school, going to the Junior parking lot, Brian was right in front of me. His arm was hanging around this girls neck and she had her arm wrapped around his waist. It made me want to cry and scream, all at the same time. I think I'm just jealous. I dunno. Maybe. It's all just really confusing. All I know is that I didn't want her putting her hands on him...weird eh?  So Avril's new CD has finally come out today in North America! I thought I would have time to get it before work, but I'll have to wait til after. That's all I could mainly think about the whole day lmao. How sad is that? But I really want it and I hate waiting! Grrr! Even though I've heard all the songs, and seen the pics that are going to be in the booklet, I haven't read the lyrics, or read the thank-yous. That'll be the best part! *sigh* Whoa. I just realized something...I don't think they ever released her single over here! Omg...somebody...please tell me I'm wrong lmfao. I've been wanting to get it for so long now. I'll have to check FYE this weekend I guess.  It's super hot in my room and blah...I have my hair all up in a messy style lmfao. It's hideous. Anyways...I'm going to go now. I have to pee and wait for my uniform to finish washing so I can put it in the dryer. Fucking work. I damn it to hell. Don't forget, Avril's on TRL today! I'm going to have my sister tape it for me...she's really my only hope. Sad ain't it? Lmfao. Oh well, at least I know I'll be able to see it when I get home. No wait, scratch that. I don't think I'm going to watch it when I get home. It'll be almost 11pm. I'll be way too tired and I've got a shitload of homework to do. I guess I'll have to skip the eating on my break and just work. Oh darn.../sarcasm. Come to think of it, I never did eat dinner last night either. And omg you know what? I despise eating lunch. I really do, but Christa makes me!   Bri's home! I gotta show her how to record. God help me teach her this.  Much love

      Shit happened at work tonight. To make a long story short, my friend Melissa joked me in front of five guys and they laughed and talked about it for at least five minutes. I don't hate her. She just doesn't have my trust anymore, which makes me think if I can trust anyone else ever again.

      Well, I've done two great things in two days! Last night, Brianna was being bitchy to my dad. I felt sorry for him because he had just got home from work and was stressing out about that. So I went in my room as he went into his to get on his laptop. Keep in mind that my room is right next to his.  So I get on the computer, put in my Yellowcard CD and switch it to a song called Life Of A Salesman. Here it is:  What's a dad for dad? Tell me why I'm here dad Whisper in my ear that I'm growing up to be a better man, dad Everything is fine dad Proud that you are mine dad Cause I know I'm growing up to be a better man  Father I will always be That same boy that stood by the sea And watched you tower over me Now I'm older I wanna be the same as you  What's a dad for dad? Taught me how to stand, dad Took me by the hand and you showed me how to be a bigger man, dad Listen when you talk, dad Follow where you walk, dad And you know that I will always do the best I can I can  Father I will always be (always be) That same boy that stood by the sea And watched you tower over me (over me) Now I'm older I wanna be the same as you The same as you  Father I will always be That same boy that stood by the sea And watched you tower over me Now I'm older I wanna be the same as you  (When I am a dad, dad I'm gonna be a good dad Do the best you could, dad Always understood, dad Tell me I was right, dad Opened up my eyes, dad Glad to call you my, dad Thank you for my dad)  Usually bands sing about how their father's ditched them and shit. My brother Eric played this for my dad a couple months ago and it made him cry. How sweet is that? Anyways, I played that song while he was in his room. About an hour later, he knocks on my door, and was like "Did you play that song for me?" And I nodded my head and smiled. He was like "Thank you." And he gave me a huge hug. Aw man I'm about to cry thinking about it lmao. It really made him happy.  I'm in Behind The Wheel as you know, where you drive around with another student and instructor. Well, Josh usually drives to where ever we're going and I drive back. On the way back, I'm like, can we please go see my mom? I wanna give her a hug. Since we're already going to go by where she works I figured it'd be a nice surprise for her. So he's like yea I guess, just make it fast. So I park the car and walk into Minnieland.{It's a child daycare center} And I walk in and I'm like is Patti here? And the women are like are you her daughter? And I'm like yea and I told them my name and one lady was like, just a moment let me go get her.  About three minutes past and my mom came out laughing and smiling and walking fast towards me with her arms open and I gave her the best hug ever. She was smiling so wide it was great. And then she came out to meet my driving instructor and before I left, I gave her another big hug.  When I got home from school a couple minutes ago, I was like, so I guess you liked the surprise? And she's like, that was one of the best hugs I've ever gotten from you, and I'd like another if that's okay. I was like yes! So I hugged her again. All in all, it's been a fucking great day. I have to go to work at 4 though but that's okay. Nothing's going to ruin my great mood!  MUCH much love!

      Ok this fucking sucks major fucking ass. My internet isn't working on my computer. I'm on the downstairs one, and I hate it because my dad hounds me about how long I'm on down here. Fuck him man. I dunno what happened to my computer, but it ain't workin. I only have a short time to update this, then I'm going to do some homework. Whoa, yea, I'm going to do homework lmao.   Today was alright I guess. Nothing special happened.I had to work today and that went good. It stormed though. I love it when it storms while I'm at work! I have nothing to say really so I guess I'll end it right here.  Much love

      Today was okay I suppose. Last night was hell though, but whatever, it's done and over with and I can't go back and change what I did. I got up today around 1:30 and went driving on the highway for the first time. It wasn't as scary as everyone made it out to be and I did quite well I think!  I have my algebra exam tomorrow and I just know I'm going to fucking fail it. There's no way I'll pass it. I hate math I hate it soooo much! I don't really know what else to say because nothign big happened. I'm feeling more tired lately and I don't know why that is. And now I'm hungry. *sigh* and I have to pee.   After I finish updating this I might just go and take a shower. Next weekend I want to go to the movies with Melissa and see 13 Going On 30. It looks like a really cute movie and I wouldn't mind seeing it! Lots of things are happening in people's lives nowadays and I realize that I'm not the only one who feels this way. But that doesn't make the pain go away.  I listened to Freak Out, Together, Fall To Pieces, and I Always Get What I Want. That song is so fucked up it's not even funny lmfao. I feel sorry for Avril and no wonder it's only a bonus track over in Japan. It sucked major ass. I love Together. It's so cute. Freak Out is my absolute favorite though. I dunno when the Don't Tell Me single is supposed to be out over here. I hope soon cuz I really wanna buy it.  I noticed that I jump around on topics in this and I hope it doesn't confuse you lmfao. If it does, get over it. I don't wanna go to school tomorrow. I just want to sleep for the rest of my life if that's alright. I work tomorrow. 4:30-closing. I hope they don't have me washing the dishes. I hate doing that. It's so boring and hectic and they complain that I don't wash fast enough.  Ricky is doing just fine. He's the cutist little thing ever. I love him so much lol. He's so small too and he likes to attack my feet. It tickles, but then again it just annoys the hell outta me because I can't take my eyes off him for one second. I'm so very tired. Have I said that already? meh whatever. I'm done updating this thing for right now. Maybe more later tonight. If not, then tomorrow after work, or before work.  Much love

      How do you like the new look? Very *chic* eh? Lol I love that word. It took me almost an hour and a half to get it looking like this, and I'm not even finished. I still have to add a background, and make it so that it scrolls! I want my blog to be pretty, and I hope it's just that right now. Anyways, I'm dead tired. I am, so I think I'm going to head off to bed. Ok, I lied, I'm tired, but I don't want to go to sleep at the moment, I'm just done messing around with this thing for right now.  Much love

      *Sigh* I went to work today around 10am and didn't get home til about 5. It was a long and busy day and now I'm just really tired. Have you ever had those days where someone says or does something to make your heart literally hurt and your stomach drop? I hate it how my ex can make me feel like that whenever he's around me. I thought, that maybe, when I was finally able to get away from him, things would get better, but they're just steadily getting worse with each passing day. There's only so much verbal abuse you can take, before it finally starts sinking into your head, your body...your soul. It's like you're a sponge, soaking up all the anger that he spills. But what happens when you can't soak up any more?   That scar on my stomach is almost gone now, and I'm glad too. It was embarrassing. I didn't wear a bikini last year during summer because of it. I'm just...I have that feeling in my stomach again when I think about it. Meh, this is a shitty update, but I don't really give a fuck.  Much love

Can you tell I really don't have anything to say? Lol. I love my blog. All I gotta do now is learn HTML lmfao and make it better. *sigh* That'll take a while. All this FTP crap is annoying.  11 days til Avril's new CD!!!!!

      Today was super busy at work. I didn't end up leaving there til around 10:30pm.  I took my World History SOL. I hope I passed it. That's the one I'm real worried about. I have my Algebra SOL Monday. I'm really nervous about that one too. I know I passed my Biology SOL. Lol. Everytime I say I know I passed something, I end up failing it. Oh well. What can ya do? Nothing. Ha. Anyways, I'm gonna get my second hole tomorrow.(ear piercing for the not so bright ones lol) Then I'm gonna get a third hole in one ear. Cute eh?   I'm in Behind The Wheel now. Where you drive a car around with an instructor. Yea. I have to take it for three weeks! And today, I wanted to slit his throat. I'm not very good at parallel parking, because I don't do it that often, and he's fucking picky about it. Just cuz it wasn't perfectly straight, he had me do it over and over again and he kept pointing out all my mistakes. I'm determined to prove to this asshole that I can parallel park better then his grandma can chew on raw carrots. Oooh he makes me so angry.  I'm having a rough time. It's that time of the month, and I swear I'll forever hate it. It makes me feel so blah. Like today, I was all pissy at my parents, and I got mad and yelled at my mom while she was taking me to work. I wanted to break down and cry because I was so sorry that I had done that to her. I love her so much. I seriously really do and I hate when I get like this. I started to cry, but she didn't notice. And then she asked me how my day went, and all I could say, was "It was blah." I'm such a fucking lame ass daughter. I swear I am. I'm getting upset now just thinking about what I said to her.  "I thought we were just hangin out|So why'd you kiss me on the mouth?"  Much love

      It hasn't really been a good day...I miss Laura. I don't know what the hell is going on with her anymore and...grrr.   Family's visiting today and it's pissing me the fuck off. I like being alone..or having my own space. Melody and Aunt Carol have gotten into a fight and it just....gah! I don't know damnit. I just don't know who to go to...Brian first popped into head...like I automatically started walking out of my house to go to his...but I stopped and just went back inside. I don't want to make the same mistake twice. It wouldn't be worth it. I'm deadly tired too. I keep getting dizzy every few minutes and I don't know why.  And Melody keeps talking to me. I feel like going to bed lmfao...it's that torturing.  Hey Brandon...wanna play frottage with me?  Roflmfao oh God that was great. I was laughing. I love saying that now. It's almost like Laurne and wanting to talk about sex.  Much love

      So yes. According to the title of this update...I was finally able to watch Thirteen!!! OMFG IT'S THE BEST MOVIE I LOVED EVERY PART! I'm pissed off that Evie would stab Tracy in the back by saying everything she did was learned from her. That's total bullshit. Oh and then I started crying. The end was great but made me cry. When Tracey's mom pulled back the arm of her shirt to show her scars. Wow. I'm gonna hafta watch it again soon.  So yea...leaving messages on Laurne and Kayla's phones are great. I love it lmfao. Laurne's laugh is fucking adorable, and the way Kayla talkes is adorable. Awwww. The powdered toast man is coming to get me and I'm hiding from eem! Teehee!  Was finally able to submit my thing for the AS yearbook! Woot!  Something's wrong with Laura and she won't tell me. I've been kinda holding back from her for some reason. I think I'm just totally distracted with mIRC and shit like that lmao. Being oblivious to things when I shouldn't be. Gotta make a mental note to see what's going on with her.  I was going to post a poem but it won't post on here for some reason.  Much love

      Today was eventful.   I went in early to school because my sister had to go in early. I spent morning exam in Mrs. Dowd's room with Anna, Justin, Dylan, and Nicole. Poor Justin slammed his head into the steel staircase and thought Anna had thrown a chair at him. It was great. I'm laughing just typing it out.  After that I had my French exam. I think I passed it. It wasn't as hard as I thought it was going to be and I did great on the speaking part. So then I came home lol. We're moving into the house next door towards the end of July. Funny isn't it? lol. But it's bigger and I'll be getting the basement.  Work was....not cool. Not cool at all. I don't like birthday kisses when it's from someone I don't like. Eh. It doesn't matter.  Erfy's poetry blows me away. It seriously does. I'm hooked on it. I've printed out all the ones she's posted. I like to reread them. That's for you Erfy and don't you dare argue!  Ok so now I'm 17. Well..not officially. I will be officially 17 at 11:56am. That's when I was born. Anyways..have a look at what I wrote after my exam. I had some time left.  The Truth Within A Sentence  I can get over you. Get over you; Can I?  I am fine without you. Am I fine without you?  I didn't care for you anyways. Anyways, didn't I care for you?  You're not hurting me, you're only hurting yourself. You're hurting only me, you're not hurting yourself.  Forget you! I don't miss you. And you don't forget, I miss you.  Lmfao It's so....ehhy. But yea lol. Short little thing from me.  Much love  THERE ERFY! I UPDATED!

      Writing poetry again  Blood Stained Memories  It's todays tears, that will feed tomorrow's dreams. Yeah, it's yesterday's pain, that makes us stronger once again.  It's morning sunshine, that reminds us of the flames. Yeah, those same flames, that leave our dreams in dust.  You were the blood in my veins, but when you pulled out my heart, like a river you flowed out of me, and left me stained in my lifes water.  When you give your heart, the only way you get it back is in pieces. When you fall in love you have everything to lose. You shattered my soul and left it's jagged edges to cut my insides. All I'm left with now are blood stained memories.  *  Crimson Sky, Never Goodbye  I don't want to follow in your footsteps. I don't need to breathe the air you breathe. I don't want to stare the color from your iris, to fall into the dark endless void of your eyes.  I don't want to walk in your shadow, and I don't need to live in your light. I don't want to be born in your dreams, to live inside your nightmares, and die in your mind.  Maybe I'm just an insignificant life form, just a meager, incomplete little girl... bounded by your hypnotizing stare, imprisoned by your counterfeit charm.  Prayers of love, laced with poison. Lips of deceit, my pseudo goodnight kiss from you. Promises of faith, drowned in paraffin. Words of allure, my only salvation from the flames. Crimson Sky, never goodbye.

      My Stage  This stage is warped. Stained with experience... worn and broken. Too many tragic acts played out. It once was grand; Innocence hiding cracks, it never seemed to wear. But the cracks were always there. Actors playing their parts, worthy of awards. Their costumes hiding the reality of lies which filled their words. But I played my role as well... In search of great reviews until the day my mask was removed. Now forced to face this hell with reality at my feet. The pain is all I feel. The actors weren't acting. The stories were all real. This stage  is  damaged. The actors...not so great. They lie, hurt and cheat. Guess they were acting just like me.

      Wow. I've written a lot of poems lately! lol Dunno why. I have to work today...4:30-closing. Hrmph. Laurne is going to Kansas. I'm gonna miss that smartass but luckily she's coming back Sunday! yay!!! Lol At 2 I'm going to work to pick up my check and cash it. Today's my dad's birthday. He's getting old! Lmao. We're going to celebrate it tomorrow night since I've got work today and tomorrow 11:30am-4:30 *sigh*  Between This City Skyline  Your eyes followed me out the door, and your voice rang out on the edge of town. Between this city skyline I watched the sun die, swallowed up in the traffic. I left to die with the sun, to be forgotten. To fade away into the evening dew, into the shadows, and into the wind.  ^It's not much, but sometimes little things like that just need to be written down.  Like Burnt Paper  My world crumbled today like burnt paper. It had looked so solid-- frail, but like it could survive. And then I watched as, at my touch, it lost its shape and form and crumbled into cinders. And I just stared, as my charred world fell to ashes.  Lying on my bed of burnt laughter and dream-cinders, my face as ashen as my surroundings, I took a deep breath, (the air was all smokey) shakily stood up, and dusted myself off.  I whispered to the condemning silence, "I'll be okay. I can deal. I can cope."  I begun to walk away on unsteady feet with bitten lip and shadowed eye murmering again, "I can cope."  And, do you know, it was the oddest thing-- There wasn't a person in sight yet I heard a soft voice say, "No, you can't."  Startled, I replied through a mouthful of bitter ash, "Yes, I can! I can always cope!"  The only response was a quiet laugh and a hiss of, "No."  Angry now, I cried,  "I can cope!"   ...but the only reply was a laugh, almost kind.  With a sigh, I combed the ash of a cremated world out of my hair, and rinsed the ash out of my mouth and wiped the ash off of my face.  The silence continued to condemn.  And as I rubbed the last cinder off, I whispered hoarsely, "Do you know, I'm starting to get just a little bit tired of pretending that I can still cope."  I'm not sure what exactly made me write that, but I did and it's finished which is all that really matters, even if it sucks lol.  Much love

Stay With Me  Once again yoru eyes make it hard to say goodbye so I'll just keep driving. Where do you wanna go? It doesn't really matter as long as you are here with me. with me with me  Whoa, there's something in the air tonight something that makes me feel alive and I say Whoa, what were the words that you said to me that made me feel so special now  Once again your eyes make it hard to ask you why so I sit here knuckles tight hands against the wheel your head against the glass and you mean so much to me to me to me  Whoa, there's something in the air tonight something that makes me feel alive and I say Whoa, what were the words that you said to me that made me feel so special now  whoa(stay with me) whoa(stay with me) whoa(stay with me) whoa(stay) stay with me Cigarettes and open air, hand in hand I said stay with me cuz every star that I see is brighter than the last so stay with me  Much love
