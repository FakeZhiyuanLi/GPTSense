      Over the last few months, all my officemates have been asking why I am still single. To them it’s really strange why I don’t seem worried at all spending a lot of time on my own. I just tell them that I chose to be single because a boyfriend does not fit in my plans right now. It’s partly true because I have no idea yet where I want to settle down for at least 5 years. Since I am definitely leaving Singapore in late 2005, then it would just complicate matters if I got involved with anyone here. However, the real reason I choose to be single is that I am waiting for the right person to come along.   I’ve had a number of failed relationships, disastrous dates and really weird pseudo-boyfriends. I’ve practically met all the possible freaks of nature. You name your worst nightmare, I’ve probably gone out with him. I might have had 2 gay ex- boyfriends (I say might because I am still in denial about the other one.), an affair with a low-life two-timing scumbag, a long painful quasi-arrangement with a pseudo-date (don’t ask me to explain that one), and many other disasters too insignificant to mention.  Now if I didn’t learn anything from my experiences, then none of these would have been worth it. But in a way, everything I’ve been through has helped both me and my friends.  I am able to give good advice because most of it is based on first-hand experience. At the same time, it has helped me define clearly what I really want in a man.  So here is my long, complicated wish list of what I am looking for in a guy:  1)	Smart but has a life- I want a guy who can talk to me about anything under the sun and be able to contribute significantly to the conversation. But I don’t want someone who will be hunched over his computer or a book all the time. He still should know how to have fun and not take himself too seriously.  2)	Confident but not arrogant- I want someone who can get out there and talk to anyone. However, he should not be the sort of guy who would look down on others just because they don’t have the same background.  3)	Cute and good skin- It doesn’t matter if he has dark or fair skin but CLEAR skin is a must. I don’t want someone who is too tall or too fat or too muscular. I want someone who I can easily hug anytime without having to tiptoe.  4)	Streetsmart but not ruthless- I’ve had enough of ruthless men! I want someone who won’t easily be pushed around, but I need someone with a clear set of moral principles.  5)	Sensitive but strong- I don’t mind a guy who cries once in a while. I don’t even mind having the stronger personality in a relationship, but I need somebody who won’t be dependent on me for his well-being. At the same time, I need someone who can be my anchor when I am down.  6)	Flexible, well-rounded, and spontaneous- I need someone who won’t mind being impulsive sometimes. I need someone who can adjust to changes in plans and won’t make such a big useless fuss out of it. He should also be able to mix with different types of people.  7)	Great with kids and pets- I could never go out with someone who could be cruel to cats or any other kind of pet. It also says a lot about a guy’s character when he knows how to deal with kids. He would probably be able to deal with me since I can be one spoiled kid on a bad day.  8)	Independent and Open-minded- I could never go out with a homophobic man since most of my friends are gay. I could never go out with a man who thinks women should just stay at home and have babies because I would probably just beat the crap out of him. I would never go out with a guy who believes in censorship because I am strong believer in freedom of speech. I would never go out with a guy who follows all the teachings of the Catholic church to the letter because we would probably just fight all the time. Mama’s boys are out of the question for obvious reasons.  9)	Intelligent sense of humor- I want a guy who can make me laugh, but he should be able to appreciate funny movies and TV series that require you to use your brain. A million plus points if he has memorized the dialogue from the sketches and movies of Monty Python.  10)	Can cook his own dinner and clean the house- I have no intention of spending the rest of my life doing all the cooking and cleaning. Sometimes I have to go out and stay out late, I don’t want someone who will tell me that he would just go home to his mother in case I failed to cook dinner.  11)	Can sing or dance or play a guitar- I don’t want to hang out with a bore. When I go out with my friends, I want to bring someone along whom I can drag to the dance floor or sing in a videoke.  12)	Always looks clean- I want someone who looks like he just stepped out the shower all the time. Nothing turns me off more than body odor.  13)	 Someone who can give me FREEDOM- I don’t want someone who will hold me back from achieving my dreams, spending time with my friends and having fun with my life in general. I don’t ever want to go out with a typical macho guy who believes it is his God-given duty to protect me. No thank you, I can take care of myself.  So with my extremely long list, it’s no longer a wonder why I am still single.:)

      Uhhh...this is a really strange result....But hey, it's only once in a while that someone says I'm perfect. Hahahahaha!    -Perfect- You're the perfect girlfriend. Which means you're rare or that you cheated :P You're the kind of chick that can hang out with your boyfriend's friends and be silly. You don't care about presents or about going to fancy placed. Hell, just hang out. You're just happy being around your boyfriend.    urlLink   What Kind of Girlfriend Are You?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla

      I don't exatly find him that attractive. Here are my top 3 choices for famous people I would marry except they are married already:  1) Conan O' Brien- for his sense of humour and brain. I'm definitely not after the looks. 2) Eric Bana- for that sensitive-boy look 3) Karl Urban- because he has such an interesting face.    You are going to marry Ashton Kutcher. He is kind and sweet, but pulls a lot of pranks (and probably quite a few on you too!!)and can always make you laugh. Congrats!!    urlLink   Which male celebrity are you going to marry?

      When I was about 8 years old, I told myself I wanted to become a lawyer. When I was 14 years old, I told myself, I wanted to become a doctor. When I was 16, I wanted to become an archaeologist, which is why I wanted to take up History in college. Then as we all know, by a twist of fate, I ended up taking Philosophy in the university I used to hate back when I was in High School. I hated that place because I always had an impression that people who went to that school were stuck up snobs and my experience there for 4 years would prove me both right and wrong at the same time. Yes, there were the typical horrible rich kids who would look down on you just because you were not dressed up in the latest fashion. At the same time though, I also met the kindest and smartest people who were going to be part of my life for a long time even after the diplomas were handed out.  I always knew that I was going to have to take a course related to the Arts and not the Sciences. If I forced myself to take Management, I knew that I would have flunked out in less than a year. So I had to choose between Literature and Philosophy. Since there was already one Literature major in the family, I opted for the latter.   Even though I chose to take Philosophy because I wanted to, I struggled through most of my Philosophy classes. At 18, I really knew nothing about life, so what could I say about being, death, loss, love and truth? Whatever I knew about these things, more than likely I just read from books so I was stuck on a purely conceptual level. Whenever I would be asked to answer that final question in my oral exams that would guarantee me an A, I would be stumped. I had absolutely no idea how to carry further the lessons that I learned in the classroom.  Despite all the near flunking experiences I had, I never regretted a single moment that I was in Philosophy. It was the happiest time of my life. Yes, I had the usual angst like most teenagers, but I was into something that I was really in love with. It was definitely something I could be passionate about.  In my last year of college, I found myself really lost. I had absolutely no idea what to do with the rest of my life. At least Management majors could join corporations and become managers. Scientists could either teach or become researchers. As for Philosophers, people expected us to go to law school or become teachers. It was at that point that I decided I wanted to prove people wrong. I wanted to say that Philosophers could have normal jobs like the rest of the population. Besides, I didn’t want to take any of the 2 options at that point.  I actually wanted to join the Jesuit Volunteers of the Philippines program. Unfortunately, at that time, I had a boyfriend who cried every single time I told him I wanted to be assigned in a faraway province and help people. Later on, he would use the same method when he wanted me to give up other things I loved doing. I allowed myself to be manipulated like that for a little over a year. Luckily, I came to my senses and got out eventually. There was also another reason why I could not go for this dream, I had responsibilities to my family at that time, especially since my Mom became ill. So I ended up taking the corporate path.   Over the next few years, I found myself trying to pretend that I was a normal person. At first, I tried to be myself, but I ended up being so misunderstood that I quit my first job after 4 months. I tried to dress like everyone else. At one point, I even tried wearing make-up just to fit in. I tried to be interested in the same topics that everyone liked to discuss in the office. However, the more I tried to conform, the clearer it became to me that I was different. So I ended up leading a double life. In the office, I would pretend to be interested only in making more money and getting the next promotion. Outside, I would hang out with my friends, do a lot of crazy things and I was not afraid to speak out my mind freely.   Leading a double life though will catch up with you eventually. It already did with me. I got to the point where I became so miserable because my corporate persona was taking over the REAL me. I was not happy with the person I had become. Instead of getting better, things got worse. I felt like I was condemned to live this life forever, but I was lucky that somehow just at the right moment, I got my answer.  I’m still in the corporate world at the moment. However, the difference is I now know what I want and how to get there. I already have clear plan how much I need to save in order to leave all of this behind. After that, I plan on pursuing my dream of going to graduate school. This time, I am pretty sure that I am going to take Philosophy. I have made a stand and I am not going to take my M.B.A. just because that is what is expected of me. I do not know yet when or where, but this is the dream that gives me the energy to wake up every morning and go to work. The moment I decided that this is what I really wanted to do with my life, everything made more sense. It won’t be that long. I just need to do this for another 13 months. Then one day I will wake up and I will be once more living out another of my dreams.

      On local TV, “The Apprentice” is followed by a regular series called “The OC”. I never really liked any of the teen-oriented TV shows. I prefer watching crime stories like “CSI” and “Law and Order”. However, when you are really, really bored, you learn to be content with whatever is available on TV.  Over the last few weeks, I have been watching “The OC” and I have to admit it’s growing on me. Maybe I like the show because there is nothing better on at that time. Not unless I wanted to watch some sappy Hong Kong drama. It could be that I enjoy watching it because I think one of the lead characters is really cute. In the end, I will have to admit it’s the love stories that keep me glued to my seat. There’s the misunderstood kid who is in love with the most popular figure in school. Then you have the smart girl who falls in love with her best friend, while he pines away for the sexier but dumber classmate. I thought it was really silly that I was watching a show about teenagers until later on I realized that most of the things they talk about are the same issues we face as adults. Maybe we may live under more complex situations, but if you think about it, I don’t think our problems with relationships change much as we grow older.  I have been talking to my friends in the last few days and mostly the conversation has been about past loves, past heartbreaks, issues with current boyfriends or worries about not having a boyfriend in the first place. One thing that I observed is that a lot of people seem to be dissatisfied with the current state of their love lives. I’m not immune to that feeling. Sometimes, I wonder how come I have not been lucky enough to meet a nice normal guy whom I can hang out with. But then, when I hear the stories of my married friends who have to ask permission from their husbands or wives before being able to go out with their friends or even before going on a business trip, it completely turns me off from the idea of ever ending up with someone for good.  It’s essentially a Catch-22 situation for me. I don’t like the feeling of being trapped in a relationship, but at the same time, I know I would never be able to handle the concept of having a fling.  So I go on and watch shows like “The OC” or watch the sappy romantic comedies that star Hugh Grant or Adam Sandler. It’s nice to daydream that one day I could finally be swept off my feet. But then I think the sort of guy I want to have doesn’t really exist.

      Like most working people, I spend a lot of my time at home in front of a television screen. I could be watching TV while having dinner, ironing clothes, or while obsessing over my hobbies like cross-stitching and solving jigsaw puzzles. It’s a comfort to have something droning on in the background especially if you live on your own.  I admit that like most people I watch Reality TV shows. There’s a perverse fascination to watching ordinary people plucked off the street make fools of themselves all for the sake of getting their 15 minutes of fame. Some are a little smarter than others (Survivor, The Apprentice, The Amazing Race). Other shows provide genuine entertainment (American Idol and all the other lesser-known rip-offs). However, sad to say there are a growing number of shows that sink to the lowest depths of stupidity and feature the desperate attempts of people for ANY kind of attention (A Simple Life, Joe Millionaire, The Bachelor/ Bachelorette).   Last night I watched the first episode of The Apprentice. A lot of you have probably seen it already, so you’re probably thinking that I am so behind the times. But there is nothing I can do since I have no cable TV here in Singapore. (YES. There is life without cable.) I already know who won, but I am still planning to catch the rest of the series because it does make for good television viewing. It’s interesting to see how complete strangers attempt to kill each other while trying to finish their business assignments as a team. The editing is very tight so there are no dull moments onscreen. Plus, it’s highly unlikely that we will see any people falling in love with each other. (I’m sorry but I found the Rob-Amber team in Survivor: All Stars pretty distressing.)   Maybe the reason why we watch a lot of Reality TV is that Real Life can be boring, messy and painful. Reality TV can have all of the same things except that it’s not us who are experiencing it. But then, a life without pain, passion, doubt, despair or happiness is not a life at all. I’m getting up from the couch and taking a walk. On second thought, maybe not, I need to find out who will get eliminated this week.

      I’m really, really sleepy right now since I had a really wild time last night watching the Linkin Park Concert. Finally after days of waiting, I finally got to watch the group whose music I have been listening to for the last 3 years. I know it’s either you hate them or you love them so don’t read this entry if you are one of those people who don’t like them.  I left my office at 6:15 and got to the venue at around 6:30. The concert was supposed to start at 8:00, but there was already an extremely long line snaking around the venue. As luck would have it, I was just walking towards one of the entrances, when they suddenly opened an extra gate so I just ran there and got in earlier than a lot of other people. I know it was so bad of me to do, but hey I have to grab every opportunity right?   I managed to get a good spot near the barrier of the SGD 85 section. That meant I would have a good view of the stage. This being an open field venue with no chairs meant a lot to someone like me, especially since I decided to go by myself to the concert.   The real down side to this concert is all the waiting we had to do. Since I got there early, I had to wait for 2 hours. Then at 8:30, the front-act started playing after being introduced by 2 dorky DJ’s from some local radio station. Unfortunately, it was a Korean band that vaguely sounded like Linkin Park if they singing in Korean. Just use your imagination. After that, we had to wait for another hour before Linkin Park finally came out to play. It was already 9:30 and I was there at 6:30. Of course, once they started playing, pandemonium just broke out.   I purposely went on my own so I could go crazy if I wanted to without worrying about any of the other people around me. I was jumping and screaming out all their songs during the whole performance. Since I was in the area full of high school kids, we were a pretty rowdy section. Luckily, I was wearing my heavy hiking boots so I was not easily pushed around. With all the jumping around though, it got really, really warm in our area and it became hard to breathe. The organizers had to start distributing water or throwing water at the audience. Still, it was no surprise that some people actually fainted and had to be carried away.  Although I had a lot of fun, I found that a small part of me was unimpressed by the concert. I was looking for that feeling of being in awe since I was watching one of my favorite bands live. Maybe my expectations were too high. They look so ordinary in person. Growing up listening to all sorts of rock groups, I’m used to lead singers who look strange and have a really strong presence on stage. Chester Bennington and Mike Shinoda looked like regular guys who I would not notice if I passed them on the street. Prior to the concert, I was listening to my CD of “Linkin Park: Live In Texas” and it was almost the same play list they used for last night. But still, I felt there was something missing when I was watching last night.  I’m really glad I watched the concert of Linkin Park. It’s something I wanted to do since last year, when I almost went to Malaysia just to catch their concert in KL. However, it’s something I would only do once. I’d just stick to listening to my CDs where they will always sound like the perfect band to me.

      Here I am again alone on a Saturday night. I just finished watching “The Next Joe Millionaire” and “A Simple Life”. So now I am listening to my Linkin Park albums while reading “A Cook’s Tour” by Anthony Bourdain. Am I depressed? No. Strangely enough, I’m quite content at the moment.  Technically I have been officially single for almost 4 years now. I don’t want to consider my last pseudo-boyfriend as a real relationship because that situation was way too complicated. I don’t want to go into details because that story is so dead and done with on both our sides that we don’t even talk to each other anymore.  I have to say I’m manic-depressive about my status. Sometimes I feel proud and happy for being a strong and independent woman. On other days, I can feel really shitty about having to do stuff alone all the time. I have dinner alone. I watch movies alone. I go shopping alone. Hell, I’m even watching the Linkin Park concert this Tuesday alone. This being Singapore, I doubt it if there will be any riots during the concert. I don’t feel bad about it because it is my choice. I actually enjoy doing stuff on my own because it means, I have all the space I want and I can do whatever I please.  I guess my being a loner stems from my childhood. I was never allowed to play with the other neighborhood kids because I was too sickly so I just stayed at home reading my schoolbooks or any other thing I could get from the library. At the same time, having an overprotective family makes me crave for space all the time now that I am finally away from them.   But sometimes I do feel sad about being single. Whenever I watch movies, the ticket seller always has to ask me twice if I am getting only ONE TICKET. I have to repeat my answer most of the time and I am used to getting weird stares from them in the process. Sometimes I walk in the mall and I do admit feeling a tinge of envy when I see people being really affectionate with each other.   In the end however I realize I am so used to being alone that I doubt it if I could handle a real commitment. I don’t like the idea of someone calling me up at 2 AM asking me where I am while I am out with my friends. I don’t enjoy the thought of someone asking me to behave in a certain manner. I would hate it if someone told me to stop drinking or stop smoking because it’s bad for my health. Outside of my work, I like to do things when I feel like it and not because someone expects me to.  Yes I have gone out with people over the last few years, but they tend to bore me after a while. I like them at first and then later on, I find out their major flaw and I just leave. Someone told me that if I can find someone with half of the items on my list of “must-haves” then I should be content and happy. I just don’t feel right about it. If ever I were to end up with someone, I don’t want to settle for what’s there. I want to be sure that the person is everything I’ve always looked for. Even if my heart has become as cold as stone, I still believe that one day I’ll find that one person who will make me believe in happy endings again. Until then, I’ll be quite happy watching movies on my own.

      There is no way in hell I am going to be objective about this movie. Plus, I am not going to waste your time dissecting it like it was a groundbreaking film that would change the landscape of cinema in the years to come.    5 Reasons Why I Liked This Movie:   1)	The visuals are awesome. I am really attracted to the architecture of the Necromonger civilization. 2)	Karl Urban who plays Necromonger general Lord Vaako is a hottie! In case you don’t remember, he played Eomer in the Lord of the Rings Trilogy. I can’t explain how he can look cute with the weird hair but he really does have an interesting face. 3)	The story is not bad although it does borrow some of the famous themes from other works of science fiction like Dune and Star Trek. 4)	It’s loud but entertaining brainless fun. 5)	It has an interesting cast: Dame Judi Dench as an “Elemental” and Linus Roche as “The Purifier”, who both end up sharing screen time with Vin Diesel.

      I was trying to write a journal entry in straight Filipino to explain all the emotions running through my brain right now. After an hour of trying to put words together, I gave up. It's not that I am not good in speaking the language, it's just that I think faster in English.  I do not regret a single moment that I have walked the corporate path. I did this to find out for myself what it's like to be in the "real" world. Although my course in college has absolutely nothing to do with my work right now, I have managed to survive because I have no choice. I have bills to pay, responsibilities to fulfill and a life to build.   However, when I think about it, I realize I do not have a single friend who would be considered "normal". My real friends are artists, NGO types, self-employed, drifters, or people with strong creative impulses who just like me, forego their dreams in order to be responsible adults. I cannot stand the thought of hanging out with typical yuppies who work in P&G, Unilever, Citibank or some other big-name corporation. I have nothing against these people. It's just that I never belonged with that crowd.   I do not want to get my MBA by the age of 30. I am not interested in becoming the CEO of some big organization. I know what I want to do and it's to go back to school and pursue my greatest passion which is Philosophy. I want to join a volunteer program and serve people in a more direct way without counting what I would get in return. I want to see people for who they are and not for what they can do for my career. I do not want to compromise my principles anymore just to fit in. I do not want to get things done no matter who I step on along the way. I am sick and tired of having to play mind games with people and watch my back all the time.  I want to be a kid again. I want to be myself. I want to be kind-hearted. I want to be open. I want to be vulnerable. I want to wear jeans and shirts everyday instead of stuffy business suits.  But then, there are bills I need to pay next month...

      Got into a mini-argument again with my boss. Clash of personalities talaga. It's one of those days when I ask myself, "Dear Lord, why did you make so ambitious, that I actually took this job?"  When people found out I was going to work for this guy, they were all amazed at my courage. It could also be that they thought I was that stupid to get out of my comfort zone and risk everything for someone who has a really bad reputation. Anyway, despite all the warnings I got, I went ahead with this decision.   I have absolutely nothing in common with this guy. He's a hard-core sales man who thinks only in terms of numbers while I am a practical person who has interests outside of my job. I read books, watch movies, appreciate art, etc. This guy claims he is a Buddhist, but he can't even read about the teachings of Buddha unless it's in comic book format! So when we have conference calls or see each other, we just discuss work. Other than that, there is nothing else to talk about.  God knows how much I have changed for my job. I have turned a blind eye to a lot of things that go against my principles. I have learned how to be creative about the truth, gone to a not-so-wholesome KTV, completely turned away from whatever Philosophy taught me about how to treat fellow human beings and given up a normal life with my immediate family. Still, it is not enough. That is what I hate about my life right now. True, I have never been more financially stable, but there is much more to life than money.  I'm going to start saving every single cent I can, so I can get out of this shitty hellhole sooner.  On the bright side, since I have no business trip for next week, then this means I can actually watch Linkin Park here in Singapore. It's confirmed.:) Buying my ticket tonight.

           “Would I erase my painful memories of someone I loved just to move on with my life?” I found myself asking this question as I watched the movie “Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind”. Since the movie was written by Charlie Kaufman (who also wrote 2 other innovative films, “Being John Malkovich” and “Adaptation”), I expected to be blown away with a story that questions the very nature of truth and how we perceive the world. In the end, I wasn’t jolted with any great realizations about life. Nevertheless, I enjoyed the movie and related with it on a more emotional level as compared to his previous films.       “Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind” is a nice, quiet film focused on real people and is a good break from all these noisy, empty Hollywood blockbusters. It begins simply enough when a guy named Joel gets out of bed one day feeling that a huge chunk of his life is missing. He decides to skip work altogether and take a random out-of-town trip. He doesn’t know what draws him to that place but he suddenly finds himself attracted to a strange lady with blue hair. The lady with blue hair, whose name is Clementine, takes a fancy to him too and pursues him on the train ride back. Later on in the film we find out the reason these 2 seemingly different people get along is that they already met a long time ago. It just so happened that they erased their memories of each other. Clementine did it out of impulsiveness, while Joel followed out of revenge.       As explained to Joel, his memories will be erased while he sleeps to remove the possibility of any potential trauma. In the middle of the process, Joel realizes he has made a very big mistake. He was too focused on the bad memories that he forgot he and Clementine shared so many good moments together. He panics and begins to hide her in the deepest darkest recesses of his brain going as far as his childhood. Seeing the interplay of his childhood and his adult memories is funny in a creepy kind of way.       One of my favorite scenes in the movie is the part when they were about to delete the memory of when they first met. In the original version, Joel just walked out on Clementine because he could not really understand her behavior at that time. He didn’t know her well enough to see that part of her nature is to shock people and to go against any norms. To provide a certain level of comfort for this great loss, the Clementine in Joel’s head and the real Joel, agreed to change the ending by saying a proper goodbye to each other. I felt that this scene captured in simple terms all the emotions we feel when we are about to lose something or someone, and yet are helpless to do anything about it.       80% of the film takes place inside Joel’s head. We go on a journey with him and question the nature of our memories. In this film, memory is treated as a mere object and not as an integral part of who we are. Therefore, it can be erased to suit our purposes. Many other significant events happen outside of Joel’s mind while the erasure process is going on. People make decisions that have far-reaching effects for the other characters. Everything and everyone is accounted for. More importantly, people get what is due them.       The entire cast deliver solid performances. Jim Carey is subdued in this film, which is a refreshing change from his roles of late where he tends to try too hard to get the laughs. Kate Winslet shows us the different shades of Clementine from the bright unconventional version to her dark insecure side. Elijah Wood makes me forget he played Frodo Baggins, which bodes well for the rest of his career. Mark Ruffalo, Kirstin Dunst and Tom Wilkinson are not onscreen much, but they all manage to reflect in their performances the changes their characters go through. However, the greatest strength of this movie is its ability to raise interesting questions in our heads: “Why do we torment ourselves by falling for people who are obviously wrong for us?”, “If we already knew a relationship is going to fail, would we even bother to try?”, “By erasing our memories, are we not denying ourselves the privilege of learning from our mistakes? Would we not condemn ourselves to a life where we do things over and over again?” You’ll be surprised to realize later on that you probably asked one or two of the same questions in your own lives. Safe to say, after watching this movie, you will come out of the theater not really changed, but hopefully a little wiser.

      Last April, I finally decided to join a gym. But I wasn't going to start lifting weights again. I was more interested in trying out the different classes. So I decided to sign up for yoga classes 2x a week- Tuesdays and Saturdays. I've lost count of how many classes I've gone to, but I have to say it really works! My body doesn't feel so tight anymore and I can breathe easier. Plus, it is a good stress reliever! I'm still not so flexible but I'm getting there.

      I know I have finally somehow managed to settle in this place because I actually go out on Friday nights now! It used to be I would spend all my Friday nights watching reality TV shows at home. Gosh! I can remember how just 2 months ago I was always updated with "Survivor", "American Idol", "America's Next Top Model", "Paradise Hotel", "Joe Millionaire", "For Love or Money" etc. I could never bring myself though to watch "The Bachelor" or "The Bachelorette" though. I think toying with relationships is taking the reality TV show genre too far.  Anyway, last Friday I was invited by some colleagues. I almost didn't go because I really just wanted to go shopping by myself. But then, I saw how my officemate reacted when I said "No." He had that "There you go again avoiding us," look so I said I would go but only stay for dinner.  I joined them for dinner after buying 1 dress at Tang's Mall and 5 books from Borders. Then, I wound up joining them for drinks on Mohammed Sultan Road. So much for saying I would only stay a short while!  We ended up at this bar called Double 00 because Siam Supper Club was full. They were having their anniversary celebration. One thing about Singapore, I've never really liked any of the bars I've been to so far. They all remind me of Greenbelt 2/3. People really dress up and check each other out. Nobody really has fun because they are all too concerned with being hip. I didn't care though because it was a Friday and it is the only day of the week that I can wear casual clothes!   Another thing that I hate about Singapore bars is that men keep trying to pick me up. For others, this would be a good thing except that I am not into meeting strangers in bars. They can also be quite aggressive with it. I'm okay with being nice to people whom other friends introduce to me, but I would never strike up a conversation with someone who just happened to be sitting there before I arrived. It's really not my thing. I just want to be left alone.  Everyone knows I have a reputation for drinking. However, since I wasn't with people I could really trust to take care of me in case I got really drunk, I just had 1 beer and 3 tequilla sunrises. At 2 a.m., I thought we were going home. Instead, people were hungry so we ended up going to Newton Hawker Center and having raw clams, chicken wings, hor fun and carrot cake. Weird combination, but most of it tasted nice.  I stil prefer the nightlife in Manila. People really know how to have fun. They dance, sing and don't just stand around checking out other people. But then, for now this will have to do. As long as I am clear about my limits, then I'll be fine.

      Hmmm....you know how sometimes things just happen when they are supposed to happen? I was reading a comment my friend Neva made on my last blog entry about life in Singapore. I was telling her about this other blog I had a year ago, which only one other person knew about. I told her I never really felt like sharing it with the world like this one because all it contained was stuff about my Mom when she died. I was telling her that I preferred to start over instead of building from that one. Then I suddenly remembered, tomorrow will be my Mom's 1st death anniversary which I almost forgot. Suddenly made me feel a little sad to realize she isn't around anymore, but wherever she is I know she is happy. I think she is happy too that I got a chance to start my life all over again in a different country. I left Manila about 2 1/2 months after she died but I already made my decision to leave less than a week after her cremation. So I guess this blog is a way for me to say that I have recovered and somehow moved on with my life.     Letter to My Mom    I love you Mommy. Don't worry about me because I'm okay. I think you taught me enough which is why I am able to survive on my own. Sorry I still haven't had enough luck to find myself a decent guy to hang out with. Although, I think you should still be happy for me because I am living my life almost exactly the way I want to. Imagine if I ended up with that guy you liked, I would probably be 200 pounds now, with no career and with 2-3 ugly children running around the house. I always thank God for giving me a mother who always encouraged me to find value in my own achievements and to live my life acccording to my principles. Just keep having fun wherever you are, you deserve it.

      As of today, I have been based in Singapore for 9 months and 7 days. It hasn’t been that long but it still feels a little slow sometimes because my life isn’t as exciting here as compared to when I was in Manila. My friends are all there so I don’t have any reason to stay out late on Friday or Saturday nights and get into all sorts of misadventures.  Anyway, what is life like for me here in Singapore? Monday to Friday, I go to work 9:00- 6:00. That’s the official time, but more often than not, I have to stay a little later to get some urgent stuff done. I once stayed in the office until 6:00 A.M. the next day but that’s the exception rather than the rule. After some time it got really boring to have that routine so I signed up for gym classes. So now, I have Yoga on Tuesdays/Saturdays and Aerobics on Thursday nights. I refuse to step into a gym and lift weights because I am one of those women who develop muscles easily and I am not interested in bulking up anymore.  On Wednesdays, I study Basic Mandarin just so my boss will get off my case for not studying any Chinese dialect.  Weekends? I wake up really late on Saturdays and Sundays. I want to make up for the sleep I don’t get on weekdays. Saturday is really my leisure day so I go shopping, watch movies, and basically bum around when I can. Sunday is chores day. That means I have to do my laundry, ironing, cleaning my room, and cooking all my meals for that week. After doing that for the last few months, I realized why I refused to get married years ago. I can barely manage a household for myself. How would I be able manage for 3 other people? You can’t exactly hire a maid here in Singapore because it is expensive and impractical.  When people ask me how I can survive in Singapore when it is such a boring place as compared to Manila, I just always say, “I’m in rehab.” Now that I am here in Singapore, I don’t drink, I don’t smoke, I rarely stay out late. I spend my free time at home reading books, watching TV, listening to music, cross-stitching, cooking- stuff I really like doing. Anytime I feel like it, I go to the malls and watch movies. Recently, I even started a new hobby, solving 1000 pieces jigsaw puzzles.   I live in suburban Singapore, particularly in the Simei area. Rent is cheaper. There is much more space to walk around. Plus, it’s really convenient because there are 3 malls I can easily get to. It may be a 25-minute ride to the main business district, but I don’t really mind the travel time because it’s a very relaxing place to live in. Once convenient thing about my place though is that it only takes 15 minutes for me in a cab to get to the airport.  I guess that should be enough for now. I’m thinking of what else to write about next….

      I believe all blogs to be an exercise in self-indulgence. Where else can you talk about yourself 24/7? Even your best friend in the world won’t do that for you. That’s why in viewing this blog, don’t expect to see any profound thoughts. It’s just me living my life. So if I come off as frivolous then that’s me. Love it or hate it, it’s your choice to read it.

             I already submitted my resignation letter last Friday night. The last time I did this was about 5 years ago so you can imagine how hard it was for me to do again. I had to check the Internet for the proper format and find&nbsp;ideas for how to put painful truths in a more diplomatic manner.&nbsp; I also asked my friends to edit it for me just to make sure I got everything right. The important thing is that it's done.     &nbsp;  After sending my resignation letter via email, I went out to meet some of my friends. It was raining, but this time I was no longer afraid of the rain. For the first time in 3 years, I walked in it. It was like I suddenly felt alive again. I felt like I had finally freed myself from what was holding me back from becoming who I truly am meant to be.     &nbsp;  I finally had THE CONVERSATION with my boss this afternoon. He was suddenly so nice to me today. He was even trying to get my sympathy by saying he fell down the stairs during the weekend so his back is not in good shape at the moment. He was even telling me how people have been giving such good feedback about me, so how could I think of leaving. It's just that people don't change overnight. He could be nice to me today, but who's to say he won't scream at me again 2 months from now at 2 AM in the morning.     &nbsp;  Gosh, I guess it's really human nature that people will appreciate only what they had in the first place when they are about to lose it. He told me to think about my decision. We're supposed to have another talk tomorrow. However, the preparations for my return have already started back home, it will be highly unlikely that I will change my mind.    &nbsp;  Once&nbsp;I file my resignation officially with our HR,&nbsp;I'm still his employee until August 31, 2004. So actually, this Friday I suddenly need to go to Malaysia again for another business trip. It kind of makes me feel sad that I shall be leaving this lifestyle soon, but then we all need to choose the path that makes us happy. I don't think people should spend their lives crying about their jobs.    &nbsp;   &nbsp;

           Last night I had a nervous breakdown.&nbsp; My colleague called me at half past midnight because she said my boss was really mad at me. I had no idea what I had done wrong again so I panicked and called him. It turns out he was really mad at me because of the proposal that I sent out that afternoon. He started ranting at me and telling me that I was unprofessional and my proposal was sooo bad that it was crap (words to that effect).   I just lost it after that. I puit my heart into the proposal and people&nbsp;just come over and trample all over it.&nbsp;I started crying from 12:30 AM until 2 AM. When I couldn't take it anymore, I called my sister and 2 of my friends who I knew were awake at that time. They spoke to me and were all quite happy for me that I decided to go home. They all told me that what I was going through wasn't worth it even if I am earning 4 times more than what I used to earn in Manila. In fact, my sister told me that if I go home, I should take a long vacation.  Funny, I woke up this morning dreading to go to work. Then I checked what my boss was screaming about...it was just a typographical error. I had placed Taiwan instead of Malaysia under one of the clauses for the proposal. The thing is, they were rushing me to make revisions even until 4:30 PM&nbsp;knowing that I had to send this out by 5 PM&nbsp;to the courier. Of course there is a huge chance for human error. I was already done with the proposal last Monday and I can't understand why they had to wait until the last minute to make changes. I am not sloppy with my work if you give me enough time to review it. I actually spoke to the client and we were laughing about the whole thing. Life doesn't end with 1 mistake. It was a huge mystery to me how people can blow it out of proportion.  I'm writing my email to my boss tonight and sending it tomorrow so we can both&nbsp;think about things over the weekend. Hopefully, if things go as planned,&nbsp;I'll be out of here by the end of August. I don't see the point in suffering unnecessarily for my job when I know I have a shot a good life. Although of course there will have to be a lifestyle change. It doesn't really matter to me because I've experienced at least&nbsp;twice in my life what it is like to lose everything. It's not so bad, I'[ve always survived.&nbsp; Plus, this is nothing compared to what I have had to go through in my life. Why am I going to let a fat&nbsp;b-----d and a&nbsp;scheming conniving b---h&nbsp;ruin my happiness?   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;  &nbsp;

           Over the last few days since I’ve had to keep sane while finishing a proposal, I’ve been listening to the official soundtrack of&nbsp; “Spiderman 2”. Not all of the songs were played on the movie but there are some that I really like playing over and over again. Almost all of the songs are about loving people you can only love from a distance, living a life that was forced upon you and also about finding yourself. It’s really about stuff a lot of us are undergoing right now. We don’t have superpowers, but who hasn’t known what’s it’s like to be really frustrated because you can never have the one you love? Who doesn’t occasionally feel like just chucking their responsibilities in the wind and just going for the sort of life they really want? If you are going to get the album, I just need to tell you that there are no sappy love songs in there for the fans of sentimental slow songs.&nbsp; It’s really a compilation from the popular rock bands of today.  &nbsp;  I spoke to my friend  urlLink Cecil  last night and I promised I would post here the lyrics to one of my favorite songs from the album, so here it is:    &nbsp;   Hold On  by JET

           Last week I was sooooo busy, I really had no time to post anything here. Since I finally finished the proposal I was writing yesterday, then I can breathe for today. Before anything else, please congratulate me for finishing my Level 1 of Conversational Mandarin Chinese. That doesn’t mean I can already speak Chinese, but I can understand some of the words already. Plus, I can already count and sing “Happy Birthday!” in Chinese.  &nbsp;  Last, last weekend, I ended up camping out at my friend’s house and watching movies the whole time. I started my movie marathon on Friday night, by watching “Mean Girls” with a couple of people. Then on Saturday, I watched “American Wedding” and “40 Days and 40 Nights”. On Sunday I decided to watch “Sense and Sensibility” for the nth time. I didn’t mind because it is one of my all time favorite films.  &nbsp;  I thought “Mean Girls” was going to be the typical teenage film where silly girls chase after dorky guys. I was surprised when I actually enjoyed watching the film. It was funny, smart and actually had something to say how bad teenage girls can be to each other. Actually in real life, this also applies to how grown-up women behave especially if they are working in corporations. Hahahahaha!  &nbsp;  An interesting point the movie raises is how smart women have to pretend that they are helpless in order to get a guy interested in them. I never really got that about men. They always need to feel like they are in control of the situation or know more than others. Oooppss….I think we better change the topic before I start complaining about guys again.  &nbsp;  After watching the movie, my friend invited me to camp over at her place. So the next day, since we were both really tired, we just decided to stay at her place and watch DVDs. I ended up watching “American Wedding” and “40 Days and 40 Nights”. I needed to watch movies that didn’t really require me to think. I wasn’t able to catch them in Manila because at the time they were showing, I was too busy preparing for my relocation to Singapore.  &nbsp;  I never really liked the “American Pie” series. I guess I’ve never really been comfortable with typical “guy humor”. I don’t think you need to make jokes about sex all the time just to get some laughs from your audience.&nbsp; I ended up watching the first 2 movies because people were always dragging me to watch with them. By the third film, the jokes have become too stale and lame so I was bored within the first 30 minutes. Plus the story was really muddled up. The writers had no idea if they really wanted to go for the shock factor again or if they wanted a wholesome family film. The audience ends up just as confused as them. Even if I didn’t really find the film funny, I watched it because I just wanted to see how the whole series ended. Honestly, I thought the way they closed it was just too sentimental for me. I guess I just can’t relate with the idea of settling down for good with someone since marriage is definitely out of the question for me at the moment.  &nbsp;  “40 Days and 40 Nights” was another movie about men, but it had a different premise. The lead character played by Josh Hartnett decides to become completely celibate for 40 days as his sacrifice for the Lenten season. Of course, he had to be Catholic because Catholics seem to have the most guilt about sex as compared to most other religions. It wasn’t such a bad film. I’ve just never been a fan of Josh Hartnett because I think he’s handsome but boring. Also I just didn’t see the big deal about not having sex at all for 40 days. Some people can go for years without it. Well, I guess I also would not be able to understand his situation since I’m not a guy.  &nbsp;  The last movie I watched from my friend’s DVD stack was “Sense and Sensibility”.&nbsp; It’s still one of my all –time favorite romantic films, so there’s really no point in my writing about it. I loved the way Emma Thompson adapted Jane Austen’s book for the big screen. I could totally relate with Kate Winslet’s character. It was actually after watching that film that I decided she would play me if my life were made into a movie. Then there’s Hugh Grant, who will always be the perfect guy for romantic comedies because you can make him do ridiculous things, but he’ll still always be very charming.  &nbsp;  So that’s how I bummed around for one whole weekend.

      5 Signs You've Stayed Far Too Long In Your Job:  1. You strat feeling depressed for no reason. 2. You start getting sick - headaches, ulcers, colds, etc. 3. You hate at least 75% of the people you work with. 4. You avidly wait for the weekend. 5. You start BLOGGING during your work hours.  This is one of those days when I wish I could just go home and sleep. I had a really LONG day yesterday (imagine going on 1 day- overseas trip!) and I was thinking of going on leave. As if I could do that! I think my presentation yesterday worked because the prospect is already requesting for a proposal from us. The problem is, the deadline is next week. Oh well, what can I do? You can't really demand from the client that they change their time frame and wait for us right? So I only have today and tomorrow to do the information gathering, requirements analysis and writing the usual marketing shit I include in proposals. I think I'm already getting an ulcer.   Gosh, this work is killing me. If only I had enough money, I would pack my bags and leave tomorrow. But what I have saved isn't enough. I still need to bear with this for 13 months more. Actually, if I had not been practical for the last 3 years of my life, I should have left this company a long time ago. I just always had a reason to stay like, "I need to wait for my bonus." or "Ooopss...they offered me a better job." But every additional year I spent here, made me feel like my life was being sucked out of me.   I think I'm hitting rock bottom right now. I feel like an empty shell, a being without a soul, simply floating across this desert called lfe. I just need more time to fix my financial status. Unlike some people who can depend on family memebers to help them out, I am completely on my own. So if I quit, I need to make sure I can support myself for at least 6 months of bumming around.

      My sister went to our suking manghuhula (fortune teller) yesterday. I know there are some conservative Catholics who disapprove of people going to fortune-tellers, astrologers and psychics. To me though, I see nothing wrong with that. A good fortune teller will help clarify for you possible consequences your decisions may have. They could warn you of any dangers that may come your way. However, a true fortune teller, psychic or astrologer will always acknowledege that everything boils down to the choices we make and that we always have the power to change our destiny. So in a way, my readings are a form of therapy for me and not really a way of finding out what will happen in the future.  Anyway, I asked her about certain decisions in my life that I have made recently and she says I am on the right track. I think I don't need a fortune teller to tell me that. As it has always been in my life, once I have set my heart on something, nothing ever stops me from achieving that goal. I also wanted to ask her about certain people in the office and the big question, "Who can I trust?". I got some pretty interesting replies.  Anyway, it's the start of my favorite time of the week....the weekend!!!! Leaving the office now to watch a movie with one of my friends. Done with all my reports so I am free already!

      Last night was the first episode for the new season of the Amazing Race, one of my favorite reality TV programs. I watched the 90-minute premiere so I could find out who the contestants are and I wasn’t disappointed with the show! It’s still one of the coolest concepts they ever developed for reality TV. Imagine running around all over the world on an adventure with the one person whom you consider to be your closest friend/closest relative. The potential for genuine human drama is always there. Plus, they really open to the viewers all the possibilities of world travel. I like how given the fast-pace of the program and the short time they have, the producers still manage to show the local flavor of each country they visit.  I haven’t decided yet which team I am going to root for. No character has caught my attention yet. I do know though who I won’t be cheering for: Brandon and Nicole, the models who keep on trumpeting that they are Christians. Maybe I’ve always been uncomfortable with people who keep saying they will put all their trust in the Lord to win the race. It’s not that I am an atheist. There’s just a difference in the way I perceive my relationship with my faith.  At heart, I'll forever be a "Lonely Planet" traveller type. I don't see myself going on a guided tour or a luxury cruise. I'd rather go to a place for at least a week, stay in a cheap (but decent) hotel, search for good bargains and absorb the local culture.

      In about 13 months time, I will hopefully be finally free! What do I plan to do with that time?  1) Go on a VACATION for at least 3-6 months. Probably bum around in the mall. God, I miss the days when I had the luxury of time to just walk around aimlessly in  Megamall.  2) Go to Boracay finally. I've never been a beach person but I know my friends would like to go, so maybe I'll give it a shot.  3) Sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep.  4) Chase my cats around the house all day. They hate being hugged, but I don't care! I miss them so much every single day.  5) Find myself a date.  6) If I had the extra cash, I'd probably go to Venice. I was supposed to go this April but my boss didn't approve my leave. (What's new?)  7) Climb a mountain again.  8) Go on a retreat for a week.  9) Watch all the art film DVD's we have in Manila that I haven't seen.  10) Do some spring cleaning.

      Since I published my post called "My Definition of a Dream Guy", the verdict seems to be unanimous- I am asking for the impossible. It's either he exists, but is probably gay or probably married. Or maybe he doesn't exist at all.  After my friend  urlLink Cecil  pointed out that my dream guy is defintely gay, I decided to test out her theory. You know how Blogger can link you up with people with the same interests as you? So I clicked on one of my favorite films and found a list of people who also had that same film on their own lists. I clicked on one of the profiles and voila, of course the person turns out to be a gay man who absolutely enjoys baking.   Everytime I tell my sister that I am interested in someone she automatically tells me, "I bet he's gay!" My boss here in the office is afraid to be seen hanging out with me because he's afraid of being mistaken for a gay man. That's because he just assumes that every single guy I hang out with is probably gay. I also have a reputation even in the Singapore office that I don't really know any straight men.  I don't care about what other people think about me. What is important is my friends know who I really am. I really just don't discriminate against people. If they are friendly, good and smart, it doesn't matter who they are or where they came from.  I'm still hoping to find my dream guy one day. If I never do, it's okay. Being alone isn't so bad. I believe the greater tragedy in life is choosing someone only because he was available and convenient. I don't want to spend the rest of life with a guy wondering if there was someone better out there for me. If I am to love someone again, I have to love him unconditionally, but hopefully not blindly anymore.

      My close friend here in Singapore gave me a CD compiling all the pop rock hits between  2000- 2002. I was listening to it over and over again the whole day. It made me realize that music plays a big role in helping us remember important people and events in our lives. It has the power to bring us back to the time when life was simpler. Having the benefit of hindsight, when I hear certain songs I can now laugh at the times I was a psycho ex-girlfriend, an alcoholic and dating the worst ever losers on this planet. I can also become wistful about the time when all I had to worry about was where next weekend's night out was going to be. I'm over that phase now in my life. Everything is pretty much in order and I have more grown up things to worry about now. I'm pretty much sober 90% of the time. Just don't let me stay more than 2 weeks in Manila.:)  Since I am in a reminiscing sort of mood today, I have compiled the Top 10 Songs that would be stored on my laptop if I had enough space. If you know me well enough, you can actually play a guessing game of which big event or who I am reminded of everytime I hear these songs. I will not apologize for my terrible taste in music. This is just me.:)  The Songs: (in no particular order)  1) Someday We'll Know (the original New Radicals version and not Mandy Moore) 2) Everything You Want (Vertical Horizon) 3) I'll Be(Edwin McCain) 4) Barely Breathing (Duncan Sheik) 5) If Your'e Gone (Matchbox 20) 6) Iris (Goo Goo Dolls) 7) My Immortal (Evanescence) 8) Your Song (Elton John) 9) This I Promise You (N'Sync)- only because this is going to be played at my wedding if by some miracle I actually marry anyone. 10) I Think God Can Explain (Splender)  I'll come up with a second list maybe a few weeks from now.

      I spent my entire Saturday working in the office. Mercifully at 8:30 PM, I was done with the reports I had to finish, so I had enough time to run to the mall and catch Spiderman 2.  I wasn't really expecting much when I bought my ticket. I was just glad that a new movie was opening this week. With Singapore being the most boring place on earth, the only things I have to look forward to every weekend are the new movies. I mean, I enjoyed the first film, but I didn't feel like I would like to watch it over and over again.  I found myself pleasantly surprised that within the first 10 minutes of the film, I already felt a lump in my throat and I struggled to hold back the tears in my eyes. I actually cared about this character- Spiderman! Normally, when we watch films based on super hero characters, we feel no sympathy for them whatsoever because we know they have powers that give them advantages over the rest of humanity. However, Tobey Maguire manages to portray the vulnerability and internal conflict of Spiderman without having to resort to cheap acting tricks lesser actors would use. He shows us that super heroes DON'T have it all.   After the Green Goblin in the first movie, we all ask how much worse could the next villain be? In comes Doc Ock, who is brilliantly portrayed by Alfred Molina. He's more powerful, more brillant and even smarter than Green Goblin. His experiment has even greater potential for destruction. One of the best things I have always appreciated about this series is that the villains are not one-dimensional caricatures of what it means to be evil. They fully explore the possibilities of this one statement, "There is a thin line that separates genuis from madness."   I love this movie because unlike most action films, this one finds its heart in the story and does not rely too much on the improved special effects. Everything in the script is tied so neatly together that there are no loose ends we have to figure out. You know why one character is there and you know the future roles they will play in the sequel if you are familiar with the original Spiderman comic books.  Although this movie has many sentimental moments, it manages not to become melodramatic. They don't extend the emotional scenes beyond the point that would make it cheesy instead of effective. You really see how the characters have grown from the first film. More importantly, the movie emphasizes the importance of choice and responsibility. Too often we blame our situation on fate and destiny forgetting that we are the ones who make the choices that shape our lives for better or for worse.  I'm definitely looking forward to Spiderman 3 now! If it still has the same cast and the same director and the same scriptwriters, I'm sure it can only get better.

      This is why I never maintained a journal in my entire life. I find it too hard to sustain my enthusiasm for writing down all my experiences and thoughts on a daily basis. I am brimming with ideas for stuff to write but there is just so little time.   I was supposed to have a meeting in Malaysia this Friday, but the prospect decided to move it to Wednesday next week. Flying in on the 8:30 AM flight and leaving on the 6:50 PM flight.  Anyway, maybe tonight since I need to stay in the office late, I will have time to add entries to my journal.

      I had my job interview at lunch today.:) It was for an Asset Management firm here in Singapore. They need someone to be a System Administrator for their Investment Management software. Something I'm very familiar with since I spent the last 4 years working on the same type of product. Anyway, I was so shocked because the hiring manager is the nicest guy I've met in Singapore so far. He's the Head of the IT Division, but he is very unassuming, modest and very soft-spoken. It's like a culture shock for me coming from a very dog-eat-dog environment in my current company.  Anyway, I just have to live with the fact that I will be getting less pay but I still get the full benefits like medical and insurance coverage, plus I have proper leaves. It will only be 14 days, but 14 days I CAN ACTUALLY USE! Unlike now, I have 24 days, but I have only used 5 days so far in the entire year. Plus, no one is going to call me at 12:30 AM in the morning screaming at me on the phone.  Oh some things I forgot to mention, if I work for this guy, I don't have to go to not-so-wholesome KTV's and have to accompany him as he hires GRO's to entertain him. Nor will I ever have to sing for 4 hours ever again just to relieve me of my boredom! I don't have to go home at 4 AM in the morning dead drunk from finishing half a bottle of Bombay Sapphire. I don't have to inhale second hand smoke. I don't have to buy his medicine when he's sick. Plus, I don't have to fetch him from his hotel just to bring him to an event.  So there's a 50/50 chance of me staying in Singapore. If I get it, then well and good. If not, I take it as a sign from God that I really do have to go home to Manila. Either which way it goes, I'm still a winner.:)  Note for the superstitious: I had my interview on Friday the 13th at the 13th floor of my current building. It was so funny how I kept trying to find ways to escape from the office without anyone seeing me leaving on the 13th floor.

      Eversince I was a kid, I always knew I was a rebel....  When my mother put me in Nursery class, I refused to listen to my teacher most of the time. When she would ask everyone to stand up and sing, I would sit down in defiance. Even when she threatened to report me to the guard, I would just look at her. Once, I even had the audacity to turn my back on her when she was talking to me. I mean, why did I have to do what everyone else was doing anyway? Out of sheer embarassment, my mother pulled me out of class.  My mother thought she would be able to raise me to become a proper little lady. So she got this crazy idea of enrolling me in ballet class. I ended up being the little terror who pushed all the kids around while they were balancing on one leg. I think she would have had more luck placing me in a martial arts class then.  When I was a little older, my Mom sent me to a summer class in some finishing school where girls were taught how to walk properly and behave properly. In one of the classes I had to take, my teacher didn't believe in the theory of evolution. So at 12 years old, I was already debating against a guy who was probably 20 years older than me about why Creationism simply cannot be scientificaly proven.  In High School, I remember we also had another debate in class regarding artificial contraception. Out of 45 people in my class, I remember being 1 of the 5 people who stood up and said that it is not evil. Everyone else still believed in Catholic teachings.  In college, I took a course everyone else thought was useless and joined a sport very few girls dared to.  Don't even talk to me about my Dad. I don't think I ever followed anything he said. My Mom knew that I was very hard to control, so she just resigned herself to the fact that I would always do things the way I wanted to. She just hoped for the best that I wouldn't get myself into too much trouble.  Today, somebody told me that I am wasting my opportunities by leaving Singapore. Duh?!!! The only reason why I got here is that I seized every opportunity that came my way. A lot of people stay in jobs they hate because they never have enough guts to get out and take the risk. The reason why I am getting out anyway is that I believe there are other opportunities out there and other adventures to be taken.  80% of people I know are deceived into thinking that security means having a big, fat bank account, a stable job, a nice house in the suburbs and a conventional family setup. Sometimes I wish I could be like everyone else, but I really don't think that's for me at this point in my life. Most of the time, I don't think it ever will be.  I don't know, I wish it were easier to explain why I am doing what I am doing. All I know is, I just have to.

      20 days to go....  First time in 4 years I am going to be unemployed...  First time in a year where I can actually just laze around and have coffee in the mall...  You really can't have it all... Life is always about trade-offs...  I had money but I had no life.... Now, I am about to get my life back, but then I have to accept that I won't be able to go on weekly shopping sprees anymore like before.  Life is also about choices... I made a choice 4 years ago to pursue the ultimate corporate values of money, power and prestige. Now, I'm making a choice to walk away from the chance of having it all for reasons I alone will understand.  If growing up in this industry means becoming cynical and jaded about life, no thank you. They can keep the money.  If becoming sucessful means having to step on others and clawing my way to the top of the pile of shit everyone leaves behind, no thank you. I'd rather spend my life being an average person with peace in my heart.  I've made my choice. For better or for worse, I am going to live with it.  Besides, happiness, perfection and success is not only found in making your first million before you're 30.  Some of us find it in helping others.  Some of us find it in being good at a craft.  Some of us find it in having the time to appreciate the beauty of life.  If people think I am crazy so be it... I tried and I have no regrets taking this path.  Lest I get misunderstood, I don't think corporations are evil. I don't look down on regular 8-5 jobs. I am just turning away from a career path that was taking my time away from everything I hold dear and changing me into a person I was not.  Everything changes on Sept. 1, 2004.

      I just checked out the new teaser trailer and production photos for the upcoming Batman movie starring Christian Bale. I swear he is one of the most handsome actors in Hollywood right now! I like his clean cut look and his pefect bone structure. Plus, he is well-educated because unlike most child actors, he took time out to lead a normal life and get a proper education.  The new Batman movie is directed by Christopher Nolan. He became well-known for his work Memento, a movie that told the story backwards, and questioned the very nature of memory.  I can't wait for July 2005!

      Last Sunday, I found time to watch the preview screening of "Collateral" directed by Michael Mann. I've never been a big fan of Tom Cruise, but I liked the director's other works, so I knew it was something worth seeing. Plus, the premise was pretty interesting. A hired killer hires a cab driver to take him to 5 stops. The hired killer gets to finish his assignments in one night and the cab driver earns twice what he makes on an average night.  "Collateral" really isn't your typical action film. It's more of a psychological drama involving 4 major characters. The sharp, witty dialogue though keeps you engaged with the movie and you really get to know the characters pretty well. You see how whether one is good or evil, there are common threads of experiences that run across every human being. There are the insecurties, unfulfilled dreams, doubts, hopes, fears, and all the other things that make up our life. The only difference is how we face up to those challenges. Are we going to be the best that we can be or are we going to spend the rest of our life drifting through existence while paying the bills?  The hired killer played by Tom Cruise believes he is seizing the day and living his life fully by his work. However, the cab driver played by Jamie Foxx has been lulled into a false sense of security despite the fact that he is a really good driver. He's been dreaming of putting up a limousine company for the last 12 years, but hasn't really had the guts to take that leap. In one night, they learn things about themselves and they do things they never thought they would. The cold-blooded killer saves the cab driver from robbers, policemen, and other characters intent on killing him. The cab driver, who has never given anyone trouble in his entire life, gains access to the depths of the underworld.  I guess my only complaint about the film would be Tom Cruise. This guy works really hard, but he wasn't really born with natural acting talent. The supporting cast pretty much overshadows his performance. He's just damn lucky that he was given a really good script to work with.  I'd recommend you all go watch it! However, if you are the typical brainless guy looking for mind-numbing violence onscreen, don't waste your time. I doubt it that you would like it.

       Sigh! Just when I thought everything was so certain already, another complication came up.  An Asset Management firm has a vacancy here in Singapore. The Head of IT used to work for my current company. He found out I was going to leave, so he asked me to submit my resume to him ASAP. Nothing's final at this point, but he's very interested in acquiring my services. Now I am confused because I don't know whether to go home to the Philippines or if I should just stick it out here in SG. We might start initial discussions soon if he likes my resume well enough.  Pros: It's contractual work for only 1-2 years. Plus, I get exposed to the client's environment. For the last 4 years, I've always been exposed to this world from the vendor side.  Cons: Do I really want to stay in the Investment industry?      Sigh! I was really looking forward to going home.

       Eversince I arrived in Singapore, I developed an interest in science fiction novels. I've always tried to find time to read different works from different authors. I guess the interest also got carried over to movies. That's why last week, I was really looking forward to watching "I, Robot" starring Will Smith.    "I, Robot" presents a vision of the future where robots are a part of everyday life. They become the new servants so that human beings have more time to pursue their more meaningful interests. The robots operate under 3 unbreakable laws making it impossible for them to harm their human masters. Only 1 person has an innate distrust of them and that is Will Smith's character, a policeman with a strong prejudice against robots.  One day, Will Smith is called in to investigate what looks like a suicide by the inventor of advanced robotics. The scientist leaves him a simple program which contains a clue as to what caused him to commit suicide. In the process of his investigation, he discovers the existence of one robot who has the uncanny ability to think for himself and have his own identity. Will Smith's character believes that this robot murdered the scientist. No one agrees with him though and everyone thinks he's crazy. He begins to question the 3 Laws and wonders if it is possible to break them. Many things happen to him that seem to prove his theory. All of which lead to the inevitable confrontation between man and machine.  The movie is very interesting because it tries to raise questions about what it means to have consciousness, how important it is to dream and ultimately, what does it mean to be human? The action is paced pretty well so you never feel bored. Plus, the director doesn't rely too much on special effects and noise because he has a good story to back him up. Will Smith himself proves once again that he really has the charisma to carry a film. He never looks like he's trying too hard. Overall, I had a lot of fun watching this film and would definitely recommend this to my friends to see for themselves.

      We had our summer outing for the office last weekend at a resort in Johor Bahru, Malaysia. It was really initiated by the Social Committee in our office to be a team-building session. Most of us though saw it as a chance to have a break from the usual 9-6 routine.  I almost didn't make it in time because I woke up at 7 AM and that was our meeting time. I ended up getting dressed in 5 minutes and rushing to the Tanah Merah Ferry Terminal. I was just so lucky that my house is very near the exit points of Singapore, like the airport or the ferry terminal. The whole thing was understandable though considering I just got back from Kuala Lampur at 11 PM the night before.  The whole event was held at Sebana Cove in Desaru. It's a self-contained community so once you get in, your'e pretty much trapped for the rest of your stay. In fact, they even have their own Immigration Center to have your passport stamped. I guess the whole situation was there to force us to develop bonds with different people in the office especially since no family members were allowed.  Since it was a team-building session, we had some group activities like Treasure Hunt and Raft-Building. For the Treasure Hunt, I was lucky to have the Managing Director on our team because he could really run around the resort and get the clues. So for that game, we came in first. Then in the afternoon, we had another activity for Raft Building. Since I really can't swim, I was freaking out the first few minutes I was on the raft. It took me a few minutes to calm down. For that one, we came in last.  Overall, the event was quite fun. During the night, I got a little drunk again, but I remembered everything I did. It was pretty weird though, because back home, I would never be considered the life of the party. But here, I was the one who would pull people to the dance floor and teach them how to dance. At first the band was playing really sentimental love songs, but after their first set, I went up to them and requested for more upbeat songs. As expected, it was a Filipino band so we had no problems communicating with each other.  At around 1AM, most of the people were pretty spaced out. So we all decided to head out to the pool for a midnight swim. When we got there, some of my colleagues decided to strip down to their underwear. Even though I was tipsy, I was still very shy so I went into the pool with all my clothes on- in my jeans and t-shirt! I really just didn't want to give people any more reason to gossip about me. Strange though, considering that at this point, I really don't care anymore since I only have 29 days left before leaving.  The next day, we actually had some free time so I decided to go canoeing. I mean if I was able to survive the raft, why wouldn't I be able to survive the a properly built canoe? Besides, the whole time I was rowing, a rescue boat was always on standby. Then at lunch, we had a chance to get out of the resort and we ate at a seafood restaurant in Kota Tinggi. Lots of prawns, lobsters, fish, crabs and so many other things.We were all so full afterwards.  At 4 PM, it was time to check out. On our way back, the waters were pretty choppy because it was raining. But the view of the sea was wonderful though. Too bad I wasn't able to go mountain climbing this time around. Hmmm....maybe when I get back to the Philippines in September, I will try to climb another mountain again.

       This is the eulogy for my dead laptop.....      I was doing a detailed product presentation for a prospect in Kuala Lampur last Friday when my laptop suddely died. I really didn't know what to do at that point whether to throw it to the wall, cry or walk out of the client's office and jump off  from the top of the building. I guess you can all visualize what it would have felt like for me. We tried various things to make it restart, but nothing worked. We even called various people from the Singapore office to get suggestions. Well, no one could help us. In the end, I asked the prospect if we could borrow his PC and access the system online via Microsoft Live Meeting. The connection was really slow, but we just tried to make the best out of the situstion. In the end I survived and that's a good thing.    Life is full of so many unexpected twists. Of all the things that could happen to me at a client site the worst thing really is my laptop crashing. My laptop could also be just a reflection of my own condition right now. Physically and emotionally, I just crashed. However, just as in life, you fall, you get up and you move on.      I really don't know what's going to happen to it now. I'm already on my way out and there is no point in my getting a new one. Currently I am using one of the spare units in the office. I will miss it because I have brought it with me to different places and it has a lot of important files for me. Anyway, when I get back to Manila, I'll probably inherit my sister's other laptop. I'm trying to see it as proof that when you lose something, it means that there's another thing better out there for you.
