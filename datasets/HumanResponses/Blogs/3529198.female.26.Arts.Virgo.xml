      So, for the first time at my new job, I ended up eating lunch alone today.  I wasn't depressed about it, it was a good excuse to try the Chinese Gourmet place across the street.  Sad that I would need an excuse, but I work with a bunch of anorexic privileged marketing divas and Chinese Gourmet (read NOT really gourmet - buffet) has never been an option.  "Gross."  It seemed yummy to me.  I had to try.  Cheap, yummy...  What could possibly go wrong?  I pulled up to the buffet, my eyes feasting on the possiblities.  Two item combo?  Rice or noodles?  Tofu Eggplant or Kung Pao Chicken?  Endless possibilities.  I settled on Orange Chicken and Chow Mein noodles.  MMMMM.  I even decided, what the hay, I'll eat here!  By myself!  Screw the skinny bitches!  Let them see me, right here by the window, all by myself, feasting on Chinese food.  And it was good.  Fried.  Salty.  I was getting full, when a very nice gentleman with a clipboard walked up to me and asked if he could use my chair.  Puzzled and polite, I obliged.  He opened his clipboard and pulled out a sign.  Stood up on the chair, towering above the laminated table... and removed the Grade A sign.  As I watched in completely internal horror, he replaced it with this written notice, smiled at me and gave me my chair back.  I sat down.  Got up.  Walked out side, and looked.  "CLOSED due to vermin harboring and infestation."  Yummy.

      So last night was a blast.  I went to a wrap party for Wildboyz.  Not exactly the best show in the universe, but I have always had a soft spot for Steve-O.  Not that I would have been able to talk to him, I couldn't even muster up a sentence for Wee-Man.  It is amazing to me that I get all tongue tied around mediocre celebrities!!  Why is that?  I know I'm a fun person but I end up sounding like an idiot.   I wonder at the psychology of it all.  Is it that I've seen into their brains and they have not mine?  Ah well, I digress.  I had to leave pretty early, the party was just starting to buzz, but I really had a blast.  It's better to leave early anyway before I have a chance to make an ass of myself.  Funny statement considering the fact that I had already danced on the pole before 1 am.  But it was all in good fun.  The best story of the evening was when, early on and watching the small swarm of hot girls canoodle in the center of the dance floor, I decided to make my way out.  Grooving and nodding to the others, trying to make my way into the circle... they all left.  Split.  I CLEARED the dance floor in like 2 mins.  It was hilarious and embarrassing and proved that girls can be such catty bitches sometimes!!!  But all in all it was a clean fun night with funfun people.  I'm lovin it.

      Tonight I saw a man completely broken down in the corner seat of a bar.  Sobbing.  Trying to hold it back.  Being someone who has recently sobbed, I felt immediate empathy with him, and consequently, fear.  I wanted to hold him and tell him, I swear, if you can get through this one time -- well, you'll keep living, I guess.  I can't really say it will get better, but you'll learn to forget.  The only way to make the pain go away.  But the idea of randomly comforting this average joe in crisis sends me into crisis.  He won't take it well, he'll get attached to me, and I'll just fuck him up even worse.  God did I feel his pain.  I watched him hold back his tears, then the pain would roll over him like a wave and he would struggle again.  I so get it.  He would, on every denial side of the wave like battle, push his glass 1/4 inch further away from himself.  This I understand as well.  Arrange the objects around you, put order to the chaos, until it envelops you again.  I watched him from the corner of my eyes until I left and went home.

      Ok, I'm feeling more confident now.  Saucy and fun.  I can do this!  So I'm driving home yesterday on my completely ridiculous commute, wasting my life away, literally.  I am driving behind a medium sized nondescript white truck.  "Sabotage" comes on the blessed radio, and as soon as I crank it up,  swear to God, the truck in front of me starts bumping up and down like I'm in a rap video.  I don't understand the logistics of this, but I am digging it.  I look over to the right and there's a Mexican worker in a truck, nodding along, and on my left is a tinted Mercedes.  Ahhhh, the 405.  "Listen All Y'all."  I was absolutely in a music video.  It is magic moments like these that keep me going.

      Ok, I'm a little nervous.  This is all moving a bit fast for me...  I might need to slow down for the moment, gather my thoughts, and get back to you.  You're really great and all, I'm just not ready...
