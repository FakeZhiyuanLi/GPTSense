         (For my princess whose love I shall forever chase)        &nbsp;  I long to see who you really are    &nbsp;  I have always cinched myself in the confines of your past   Wallowing in the puddle of memories long forgotten   I built myself a wall what denied any specter of the future,   And the present as well   Only the murky past that continues to envelope my being   Eating what's left of the devotion we sowed with seeds of love.    &nbsp;  I know the time shall come   When I have to rise from this abysmal pit of mud   (Before I drown in it completely)   To face the ghost that I myself had created,   Conquer it finally   And like the Berlin, my wall shall come down in shambles   Revealing a path to a promising tomorrow to be spent with you.    &nbsp;  It is then that I can see your entirety.   I only wish you'd still be there.    &nbsp;    The very first poem my fiance has ever written for me. We were still dating then. After 3 days, I said yes!! :)

       I have to go to the bookstore this weekend. For the longest time, I have been searching for the perfect journal. The same kind my bestfriend, Janet, gave me 3 years ago. I could still remember how I cried when I received that. The note inside read:    Farah girl, To remember all the good times we shared and all the bad times we've gone through. With the way you're coping up, you're making me proud more than ever!!!   Then at the upper right corner of that page, she posted one of our funny pics together (taken in one of those neoprint booths in sm city). I just hope I get to find one this weekend.       Also, I have been longing to go to Divisoria and Quiapo to get some beads. But just thinking of how far these places are, stops me. Besides, my dear dear hubby won't let me. (KJ as ever!). I want to make do with the little time I have alone. I want to be a tad domesticated. Harharhar!!! Maybe, next time...

             It’s funny when you see yourself in someone else’s eyes. More so when you see yourself in someone else. Oftentimes before, I would wonder if it's possible to have someone act, think, feel exactly like you do. I never really believed in soulmates until I met Arthuz.      The moment I met him, I knew for a fact that I have already found my true north. My world suddenly turned upside down. There was peace and total bliss. And happiness and contentment.      I have been involved with a few men before, and unlike all of them, Arthuz never promised me the stars. He was a poet but I did not fall for his words. All these years, and until this very moment, he still proves his worth to me. Yes, he never promised me the stars but he wrought a garland of stars and placed it on my neck.       He kisses me good morning and hugs me to sleep. He brings me water when I get thirsty in the middle of the night. He makes sure I take my vitamins on time. He hurts when I hurt and he smiles when I smile. He gets mad when I start bitching but kisses my tears away the moment I cry. And I know that for as long as I would hold onto his hand, I will never fall. He is my guiding light. My wall. My home. He is my partner and my friend. My twilight. He is family to me.      My fate is intertwined with his. I am chained to my promise, to the vow that I will be making, before God and man, that I will be with him whatever happens. Come hell or high waters, I will stay with him. And we will see life through together. Because I know that our souls are linked by an unseen rope, pulling me wherever he goes.       He used to take my breath away. Now, he breathes life into me.   When I look into his eyes and I see my reflection, I couldn't help but sigh and say:  "I'm just so glad I came crashing into you".     * * * * * * * * * *    Wow!! I never thought I could still write an article. Well, this just goes to show that I don't need to be in pain to be able to write something. Maybe, I just need to try a little harder. I've never really had the chance to sit down and scribble down my thoughts. It has been a while since the last time I wrote something in my journal. I'm happy about this article. I hope you'll like it. The sun is up, I have to sleep!!!

       If I just do my thing and you so yours   We stand in danger of losing each other   And ourselves       I am not in this world to live up to your expectations     But I am in this world to confirm you     As a unique human being     And to be confirmed by you        We are fully ourselves only in relation to each other     The "I" detached from "Thou"     Disintegrates        I DO NOT FIND YOU BY CHANCE;     I FIND YOU BY AN ACTIVE LIFE     OF REACHING OUT       Rather than passively letting things happen to me   I can act intentionally to make them happy       I must begin with myself, true        But I must not end with myself        The truth begins with two        * * * * * * * * * *      One of Arthuz's many poems given to me as a gift. Written 18August02.

         "Be, we hav faced more difficult situations dan dis. We will nvr let go of d only gud thng we hav ryt nw.  I love u my Beatrice. Mor dan Dante evr luvd his.   Gudnyt!"        this was the text message i got from him one night after we fought big time. after reading this, my heart smiled.           having someone as loving and as understanding as the person i have now makes my life beautiful. and i just can't ask for more. *sigh*

I know I could very well pass as her mom. :)         Cara in one of her more recent pictures.. This was taken in Baguio City. With Tito Arthuz. She's grown to be mischievous but still very sweet, smart, funny and loving.           Still in Baguio City, this time with her Nanin (with me). I call this photo-op "me and my mini-me"..          _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _      friends, i'd like you to meet cara.. my angel. she's my brother's daughter. i love her like hell. she's so adorable. she can be pesky and many times, i have given up on her.. but at the end of the day, i'd realize she's a child and she deserves to act like one. and i'd remember my role in her life.. i miss her so much and i can't wait to see her next month. i know you still can't read darling though you have fooled me a few times that you know how to read already (smart kid!).. i love you, kulit. be a good girl to mom and dad and nice to kuya and tammie.

          We were in Xaymaca last night. It was nostalgic for me to be there. It has been close to 4 months now since we last visited the place. After our good friends,   Indio I   disbanded last Summer, we were never impelled to go back. What for?      But because we've got nowhere to go and we didn't want to spend another weekend at Seventy7 in New Manila (our almost-ultimate tambayan), we decided to give Xaymace another try. We watched BMR play. There were still a handful of familiar faces there. Plus the fact that the warmth of the staff has never changed. Francis, the bar discjock was beside us throughout the show. A few friends dropped by our table to say hi. It was a reunion of sorts.       I still miss Inkee and the rest of the gang. But things have to go on. Vic has decided to form a new band. Ian, I guess, decided to work full time in a recording company. All the rest are uber-busy rehearsing. Last we heard, they have found a vocalist to replace Vic. I'm not really sure but I'm still hoping things will be sunny again for Indio I.      We still text and call each other from time to time. But it ends there. After the group disbanded, our Saturdays have never been the same again. And will never be.      I so miss   Indio I.            SONG:  Let's Stay Together by Al Green... "  never leave you baby, whether times are good or bad happy or sad.. "    BOOK: I'm finishing up " In the presence of my enemies" by Gracia Burnham.
