      Today after breakfast, a boy from the PACES (behavior issues) program lost control!  He threw rocks at the windows of the pool building, breaking several of them.  Now the pool needs to be drained to remove all the glass from the pool!  After he did that, he went into the Quad 1 garden and broke the bird bath.  He ripped out the sign that my students took so long to make and threw it across the grass.  He is responsible to pay for all the damages.  His parents are going to be paying BIG bucks!

      You will not believe this.  I have this one student named Brian.  He is "medically fragile" meaning half his face is deformed so it is more than obvious something is wrong with him.  Today the govenor came and gave a speech to donate money to the school.  Last night Brian made a card with a picture of the govenor saying GOOD JOB!  WOW!  Oh, Brian also wears a suit and tie everyday, so when we were in the assembly and both Brian and the govenor are wearing the same things.   So, the govenor walks in and Brian jumps up as he is walking in and gives the govenor the paper. I am shocked the secret service didnt do anything!!    The govenor starts his speech by thanking Brian.  Brian runs up on stage and shakes his hand.  Then, he throws his camera at the headmaster, Dr. Corson to take a picture of the both of them.  THEN, he gives the headmaster attitude about not knowing how to use the camera!!!  Everybody was roaring laughing!!  The govenor invited Brian to sit on stage during his speech.   As the govenor was leaving, he made his rounds to shake everybodys hand...dont worry, right behind him is Brian,...everybody there needs to shake the hand of the govenor, and Brian!   Thats my Quad 1 student!  I can't wait to see the news tonight!!!

      June 18th is my last day at ASD.  Tomorrow is Lauren's last day.  Because I will soon lose my car buddy, I decided to go buy gift certificates to the Outback last night as a thank you for the staff I am working with rather than wait and take the drive alone.  Don't worry, MapQuest screwed me again.  We got so lost.  I mean, lost to the point where I called Shane and said, where are we and how the hell do we get where we need to go??  I told him we were going to the Outback, which was weird, because the reason we were going was to buy him a gift certificate!  Good thing he doesn't know Lauren, he would know something was up when a vegetarian wanted to go to the Outback!  Yea, so the Outback is really like 15 minutes away, but we got lost going both to and fro.  Damn Meridon!  We ended up there before we called Shane, he said "you are almost at my house!"  So, we went to buy the certificates and ate dinner at Ruby Tuesdays.  Don't worry, because on the way back, we got lost again.  ALl of a sudden we see CVS, the same one that we had seen 20 minutes ago!  We arrived back at ASD around 6:30.  We were suppossed to meet Michael at 6:00 to help interpret phone calls for him.  (Micheal signs, I interpret to English, Lauren interprets to French)  But, since we were lost, and late, there was not enough time to call, so we will call tonight.  After arriving home from Meridon (damn Meridon!!) we decided to go to the mall and buy cards.  After that we went back to the A-Wing and secided for every minute we spend there days are taken off our lives.  So we went to Friendly's.  I am going to miss Lauren when she goes.  I am really enjoying my time here at ASD.  Even if I am overtired, overworked, and will I ever see a paycheck??!!  :)

      My weekend was not so good.  My Friday began with Shane in the classroom with me chanting that I can't teach, I am a loser, and I have no friends. Normally I wouldn't respond, I only respond when him and I are the only hearing people in the room.  When other hearing people are around I prefer to make it look like he is being a jerk and I am being polite.  Although, when we were alone and he told me "You suck", I informed him of what he could suck. He was surprised because usually I dont reply to his sillyness.  Although everybody knows Shane sits in the back of the classroom making comments to me just to be annoying, today he bothered me.  I hate Mondays and Fridays.  On these two days the entire group is together and there are no plans.  Basically the teachers take turns thinking of things on the spot to do with the students.  I am not that good.  Besides the fact that I am nervous teaching the whole group (not the students, the other teachers and aides) because my sign sucks, I can never think of anything to do.  So on Friday when Shane said, you suck, you cant teach, I started to believe him. And when he said, you have no friends, I believed him...I don't really have any friends in Hartford...It bothered me and I dont know why.  Shane grew up here, thats why he knows people....he never left his hometown...thats pathetic...of course he can sign...his older brother is Deaf...Shane learned sign the same time he learned to talk...so why am I comparing myself to him and getting   depressed that he is so much better than me?  Grr  On Friday, my students were all "off."  The Prom is coming up, so I thought it would be cute to practice dancing.  We all stood in a circle and went around going in the circle and dancing.  Since I can't dance, I grabbed Shane and him and I slow danced in the middle.  I looked over at Brad and he had a weird look on his face, so I said, "what? you jealous?"  Shane cracked up and Brad replied that "payback is a virtue."  hehe  I Love gay guys.  Then, out of nowhere, Jeff whacks K in the face.  K is new from India and is sickly thin.  She also has Cerebral Palsy.  Ya know in cartoons how people get hit and their bones turn to a pile of dust on the ground...I thought that would happen when Jeff hit her.  I don't know where Shane was, beacuse Brad was the one who took Jeff, sat him down and tried to calm him down.  Shane reappeared and Jeff stood up and yelled while signing, "I'm Mad!"  Time for an emergency out.  When Jeff goes off it is not safe for people to be around...Jeff started walking towards me because I was near the door, and Shane tackled him to the ground.  When Jeff is "off" he is not to be close to any indivdiual except for Shane who is his aide.  But, I got all the other students safely into the other room.    A few minutes later, another student starts banging the table and screaming.  Time for another emergency out.  This kid is not dangerous like the other one is though.  He is autistic and cant express himself.  But, I got all the students to another room.  It was quite a day.  Friday night I drove down to Bill's and the three of us (me, Bill, Jen) took a train into Grand Central.  Peggy was having a party because Kevin Henderson was in town, Chuck's 30th birthday, a welcome back from Europe for Noreen and to make her announcement that this year, to honor her 50th birthday, she is retiring.  She is retired as of Monday.  Quickly into the party I became very withdrawn.  I told everybody I was really tired and worn from my challanging life, but the truth was, I was very depressed and was trying to fight back tears.  In social situations such as that one, I cannot hold a conversation.  With background music and many people talking, I cannot hear the other person speaking.  Now, this wasn't like a crowded bar with loud music and everybody screaming into each others ears.  It was more like a coffee shop.  But, when sitting across the room on a couch, while everybody else could hear what was being said, I could not.  From now on I need to avoid parties like that.  It is very uncomfortable for me to pretend to be following a conversation when I can't hear what is being said.  Saturday was Chuck's 30th birthday poker party.  The tournament cost $30, a dollar for every year Chuck has lived.  I came home with -$25.  Meaning I won back $5.  It was fun.  I want to do the same thing with my friends.  Maybe I can grab some people in Rochester to play with me.  I can't wait to go back to Rochester.  I have friends there and my own apartment.  Lately all I want to do is be alone.  I met Paige's husband.  I am not really a big fan of him.  I mean, he is a nice guy and ok to talk to, but I think my Little Paige can do better.  I have met Kevin before, but this was the first time I actually sat down and talked to him.  Maybe I will like him more when I get to know him better.  A few more weeks until Laura's baby is born.  Crazy stuff.  Life is changing so drastically lately, but I am staying the same.

      Last night was so bizzarre.  It started as Lauren and I were discussing how extremely hot it was in the ASD dorms.  I was really thirsty because I was so hot.  Due to the fact that I didnt want to change out of my pajamas, we figured it would be smart to go to McDonald's drive through and buy some drinks.  We arrive at McDonald's and I start ordering for Lauren.  My mind was in a blur (surprise surprise!) so I started reading the board...a new item...but, I ended up ordering things I didnt want because I read it outloud.  So I ordered these apple slices in a bag.  From McDonalds?  Eww!  On the way back we saw this VW Bug.  It was white and Black and in big bold letters on the side it said "Geek Squad."  Lauren and I laughed so hard.  Lauren tried to look at the driver, but he noticed we were trying to see who would drive such a car, and used his arm to block his face.  When we got back we did some research.  http://www.geeksquad.com  The Geek Squad is a computer company and every "agent" has his own number (I think we met Agent 36 last night), identical cars, and identical black rectangle rim glasses.  Wow, it is really funny.  I want to have a squad.  I can be agent P.  So, we get back to ASD, laughing hard.  I realized that I left my wallet in the car so I went to grab it.  As Lauren closed the door, my drink went crashing down to the floor.  We spent 1/2 hour getting a drink, and I didnt have 1 sip!!!  Sad News!  So, we got back into the car and went to the local gas station.  What a bizzare night!!

      Wow, I have been slacking on this thing.  Where to start!    Well, I have a new sign name.  My first one was 2 "P" hands lifting my boobs.  This was assigned to me because when I was drunk at a party with some Deaf friends, I grabbed my boobs, moving them up, unlike my peers who just grabbed them.  That was a fun party.  My second sign name was 1 "P" hand brushing the shoulder to show attitude, because my friend Matt is scared of my in your face attitude.  That sign name was modified when I entered ASD to the "P" hand signing the word "CRAZY"  Last week I went out and got TRASHED with Quad 1 teachers and staff.  Apparently I was laughing like Scooby Doo.  So now, Brad and Shane sit in the back of the classroom and say "SCOOBY DOO!" or "SHaaggy!"  My new sign name, therefore, is two "P" hands in front of the chest looking like paws and the tongue out...looking like a dog begging!  Time to teach!  I have a whole lot more to add later!
