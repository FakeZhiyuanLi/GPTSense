      I just read this thoughtful post made by a fan on rec.music.phish about Mike Gordon and why this person believes that Mike was the only band member to be dismayed by the break up. It was fairly eloquent, and while I can see what he was arguing, I wasn't totally convinced by his theory. Anyway...  After reading that I was reminded of one of the most inspirational, intoxicating, and blissful moments I have ever experienced in my life, and accordingly it happened while listening to a Phish jam.  I guess it was probably about a few years ago when it happened. One night I decided to lift a little pot from my brother, get stoned (which I rarely did then), and listen to the new Phish cds I had just bought. Specifically I was planning on listening to the second set from Fukuoka Japan 6/14/00, also known as Live Phish Vol. 4. I went to my room and smoked about half a bowl of my brother's super good weed, turned off the lights, plugged in and put on some headphones, and laid back across my bed. The opening song "Get Back On The Train" was really funky, bouncy, jammed out and enjoyable. It was like listening to all the instruments melt together and bubble up thickly into buoyant happiness. I could see Trey's wrist flick with each tight little chord being played, and hear Mike's thick bass strings emanating their lush velvety tone. It was very nice.  What happened next, however, is something that turned beautiful music into beautiful images within my mind. As the song settled to an end awash in cymbals and a guitar textured cyclone of noise, the band began the next song, "Twist." Opening oddly enough with the vocal intro that is present on the album version of the song (and usually not sung when played live), "Twist" quickly worked through the main body of the song before opening itself up to the vast possibilities of improvisation. I remember lying back with my eyes closed, engaging in the music they were making with undivided intensity and passion, the likes of which I wish I could experience in all music. It was probably the pot, but man, when the jam in "Twist" mellowed out and melted into the ambient, clock-work textures of loops and soundscapes, I had the most visionary experience I have ever had with music. As this multi-textured improvisation took over my mind, I could see behind closed eyes a half spherical, bioluminescent gelatinous entity floating in an infinite blackness of space. It was highlighted by soft electric purples, blues and pinks, wavering and softly reflecting through the clear jellied mass. It looked like a piece of liquid crystal bathed in soft hues, still in the black of midnight. I could see the music, I could see the creation of it, what the sounds were painting, what the sonic textures were expressing, and all congealed into this perfect bioluminescent mass of pure bliss. As Page laid out deeply rich notes on his synthesizer, thick electric blue drops rained ever so slowly down onto the entity, and each soft pelt caused and explosion of ecstatic pastel colors that vibrated orgasmically within my own ears. It was quite simply the greatest musical experience of my life, and the image I have in my mind of this music is something that I hope I never lose.

      I got too wasted last night. Drank a six pack of Elephant beer and it kicked my ass. Didn't realize it was 7.2%. Didn't throw up though, as much as it would have made me feel better, I'm sure.  I'm excited about this upcoming semester. Though my creative flow feels dry as a broken leaf in Winter, I'm taking a creative writing class with the intention of getting published in our school's literary annual,  Penumbra . Hopefully I'll be able to actually work out, polish up, and be satisfied with a poem I write, or at least not write another bad one.  Anyway, I just wanted to post something.

      I learned a valuable lesson tonight...  the ideology of love is dead.

      I took two Hawaiian Baby Woodrose seeds last night. I wasn't expecting much in the way of a trip, but I definitely got a head change none the less. Lots of introspective meanderings concerning the make up of my own life, aspects of my existence, and how they all play into each other through my own experience. As far as trippiness goes, very in-the-head type of experience, though visually things did appear slightly different, not as much as they did with five seeds, but still different.  I'm not sure if taking this LSA is doing anything to me mentally, if I'm taking anything useful away from the experiences or gaining some sort of unique perspective on my own existence, but it is always interesting, regardless of whether things go generally well or generally bad. Last night leaned more towards bad than good. Last time before last night was almost exquisitely blissful.  I lined up a couple good Phish trades with some folks I met on etree.org. I think I have more shows than I can possibly listen to. Time to step back and give my ears something to do rather than my cd burner.  I'm a little bored right now. I should have picked up some beer earlier while I was out, gotten a little toasted before work just to make things more fun. There is one thing I'm a little apprehensive about at work tonight, but I'll do what I feel is right in the moment.
