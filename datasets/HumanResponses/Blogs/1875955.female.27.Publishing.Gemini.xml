      1. I bought a caramel slice from the bakers. A caramel slice is about the size of the palm of your hand. It is a layer of soft shortbread, a layer of thick caramel and a layer of chocolate. We used to have them when we were little - but they always had to be cut into three and shared between us. Now I am grown up, if I want a whole caramel slice, I can have one.  2. When I made a martini just before dinner, I loved the way the ice rattled in the shaker. And I loved the way the martini tried to crawl up the glass.  3. The fliers for our latest book at work came in. I thought up the idea for them, which was a labyrinth, and the suggestion that our book can help you find your way through. I thought of it because I've been doodling mazes for months now. According to a graphologist I met, this is a sign of feeling lost in your life. So I've taken my quarter-life crisis and made it into an advertising campaign. Take that, angst.

      1. The weather broke with a proper thunderstorm. The office window looked straight into the clouds as they rolled in. We watched the sky turn brassy, and then slate blue and finally an underwater green.  2. The smell of rain on dry ground.  3. Wolfy put a penny and a pound coin under a pint glass. He jerked the glass sideways and the penny vanished. For a moment, I believed.

      1. Passing the Compasses pub and seeing straight through it because both the front and back doors were open.  2. A friend telling me I'd been very contemplative lately, and that he hoped the old "chatty Clare" would be back soon. That made me realise I missed her too, so I tried my best to be talky, and sure enough, she sidled over and slipped into the conversation.  3. Street light shining through an ash tree in full May leaf.

      1. The sky was that smoggy and smoky blue - we need some rain, but I love that colour.  2. Saw a fat lady dressed all in brown apart from her shoes which were the colour of almost ripe tomatoes. They had kitten heels and tiny silver bows. Madam, click your heels together three times!  3. This year I have noticed how vulnerable normally thuggish plants like holly and laurel and Christmas trees look with their soft new leaves. They are like people falling in love.

      1. The weather has just turned towards summer, and as I walked to work this morning the colour of the sky made me feel as if I was on holiday.  2. Chris went to get his pastie out of the fridge in our second floor office kitchen. He  tripped and it flew out of the window. Happily it  urlLink survived the fall , and made Ed and me giggle occasionally for the rest of the morning.   3. Spotted three tiny deep purple pansies with bright yellow centres growing where the pavement meets a white garden wall on a sunny street corner.

      1. A bumble bee noseying round the Christmas tree outside our office window.  2. Swallows messing around overhead.  3. Seeing a man carrying a sleeping child up the street and kissing it when he thought no-one was looking.

      1. For the last few days, I have been smelling something heavenly on my way to work. It was sweet and heavy, a little hayfevery and drowsey. I couldn't place it, and then I realised that it was  urlLink philadelphus . When I was little, I had a swing next to a philadelphus bush. As I swung, I would kick its clusters of golf-ball-sized white flowers, and the  urlLink scent  would follow me back down to earth.  2. I showed a writer friend how to send attachments with emails and she rewarded me with a chat over a gin and tonic made with her secret stash of  urlLink Bombay Sapphire .  3. Buttercups growing in the shade.

       urlLink     &nbsp; urlLink    1. Coming home and finding my mother had filled the fridge with food, including a huge bunch of fresh herbs from her garden. There was also a little sea bass, some chicken, some mince, a bag of cereal, a jar of homemade marmalade, a piece of holey cheese, some fruit and a packet of digestive biscuits. I feel like the very hungry caterpillar!   2. The sound of a cricket ball on a cricket bat.  3. The feathers on jackdaws' backs and the silly squeaking noises they made while fighting over a crust of bread.

      1. The heat of the sun on my back as I lay on the common at lunchtime.  2. Getting an email from the one of the writers, proving that the newsletters arrived the day after I posted them second class.  3. My bathroom light is not working and today one of Big John's friends came round to inspect it. He couldn't work out what was wrong, so it is actually broken and I'm not just being girly.

      1. Finally got the writers' newsletter safely into the post after a hot, dusty day of racing backwards and forwards to get it copied, to buy stamps and to pick up leaflets for an event I'd left out. Felt smug and satisfied as I poked the last one into the letter box.  2. Safeways Thai chicken and coconut soup.  3. Fell asleep over The Fortean Times at 8pm and woke just before 9pm feeling bright, refreshed and ready to do my last thing at night tasks.

      1. The smell of strawberries.  2. Towards evening, the wind got up and made it too cool to sit outside. We walked down to the lake to warm up and found that the hill kept the wind off. The air was almost still.  3. Katie's dog Milly is one big grin. Most retrievers are, I think. She ran round and round the lake, in and out of the water, up and down the bank as if it was the most exciting game in the world.

      1. I have inherited some grown-up things from my grandmother. It includes a slightly battered gilt mirror - decorated with dancing girls and a smug-looking shepherd lounging on a couch playing the flute. It arrived in my flat yesterday and is now standing on the mantlepiece. My neighbour Fenella came round to inspect it and didn't quite know what to say. 'It's very... it looks like something out of the palace of Louis 14th.' We agreed that it didn't quite go with the rest of the flat... but how can I not love it? The rest of the flat will change - it'll have to if I'm to use another of the grown-up things: the 14-man dinner service.  2. A French market came to the Pantiles for the weekend. I went round with my aunt, Janey. We bought sausages and admired oilcloths and breathed in caramel from the sweet stall. Then we bought chicken and potatoes provencal and ate them on a sunny step.  3. My grandmother's garden has run wild for the last few months. It has put out paeonies of astonishing vulgarity. They are an intense, luminous maroon - the sort that you see in pigeon's feathers.

       urlLink     urlLink    1. Disappearing into a book so that hours passed and I didn't notice. It was  urlLink  The Benefits of Passion    by Catherine Fox. It's about a woman who finds love despite being a sexually repressed trainee vicar. She's writing an erotic novel about seducing trainee vicars.   2. My new favourite drink - a variation on Moscow Mule. Put a finger of ginger cordial in a highball glass. Add rather more than a finger of vodka. Chuck in ice and a bit of lemon. Top up with water. It's very refreshing in sticky, still weather.  3. Surprises in my record collection. On rainy days I buy them ten at a time from charity shops, getting all excited about discovering tracks that I really want. Then it takes  ages  to get round to listening to them. Because of this, I hardly know what I've got, so every time I go through the pile, I get the thrills all over again.

      1. The smell of stinging nettles.  2. Ice cream and chocolate sauce.  3. Waking up ravenous at midnight and lying there thinking I had no food in the house; then I remembered a packet of noodles in the back of the cupboard. So I cooked and ate them. It was one of those moments that make me glad to be single.

      1. Wandering into a bookshop I picked up a Tintin book. It made me remember looking at a copy of  The Calculus Affair  before I could read - trying to pick out the story from the pictures, and loving the brightness of the colours.  2. Randomly running into a friend who has just come back from university - this time for good. We agreed to meet for lunch the next day.  3. Passing a house covered in painted flowers.

      1. It rained nearly all day. It wasn't the violent stormy tipping-it-down rain we've been having. More a gentle drizzle that I imagined must be doing the world good. It is the sort of rain that we love to describe as 'miserable weather' but secretly take pleasure in.  2. Katie and Paul V came round to dinner, which I enjoyed cooking and eating. We had stir fry made with prawns, peppers, baby sweetcorn, snap peas, noodles, onions, spring onions, ginger, lemon and garlic. Afterwards, we sat around gossiping and giggling.  3. Warm golden syrup cake with vanilla ice cream eaten off my grandmother's desert plates.

      1. Finding a sweet spot in the park that was just far enough away from the play area that the kids' voices and the squeak-crash of the see-saw did not distract me, but made a good background.  2. Horse chestnut leaves against a mid-day sky at the end of May. There is nothing so green and blue.  3. There was a mysterious rainbow disc in a high cloud over the park. I've only ever seen one before from an aeroplane.

      1. I have been putting off cleaning out my fridge. I finally did it and afterwards felt good - it looks whiter inside; and it smells better; and opening the icebox doesn't cause an avalanche any more.  2. Jay trying patiently to teach me  urlLink The Butcher's Boy   on his penny whistle.  3. It was Tally's first birthday. His mother Laura read a poem that his father Andy had written when Tally was a few weeks old. It made her cry, and me too.

      1. Hot chocolate made with real squares of chocolate in a thick mug.  2. Johanna aged 8 months wriggling with excitement in her mother's arms at something that none of us could appreciate.  3. Paul V taking a moment out of his busy schedule to sit in my flat reading the papers and catching up.

      1. I was woken after midnight by music. 'Bloody Dav's' (the 'nightclub' two doors down from me.' But it was drumming and a sax, which isn't like Dav's at all. So I looked out of the window, and there in the street were two people - one drumming and one playing the sax. As I watch, a Dav's bouncer comes out and tells them to bugger off. This is where it gets strange. They rode off up the High Street - I *swear* I wasn't dreaming - on a musical bicycle. It was a tandem with a cart arrangement at the back for a drum, and a special device on the handlebars to hold a sax.  2. Silk knickers. They look good, they feel good and I'm wearing them for no-one but myself.  3. Going to work without a jumper or a jacket - it's warm enough and the sun is not so bright that I need to cover up.

      1. Walking back across the park at 8pm and seeing fathers playing with their kids on the swings.  2. Not sitting down to a proper supper. I ate cold new potatoes in olive oil and salt and pepper while my tiny lamb chop grilled. Then I gnawed on the chop, dipping it in tomato sauce on a side plate.   3. My name's Clare, and I can't stop playing stupid games on Fenella's boyfriend's Nintendo 64. I've been working on   urlLink Zelda: Ocarina of Time   for about six weeks now, and I'm still only halfway through. It's vast and and it's beautiful. It's just difficult enough to be challenging, but easy enough that I don't get stuck and cross. The environment is incredibly detailed - it's a pleasure just to wander round Hyrule enjoying the scenery. I was very distressed when I woke from seven years' sleep in the Temple of Time to discover that the evil Ganondorf had trashed the place.

      1. Two different friends called to invite me out for a drink. I had to say no because I was having dinner with a third.  2. A pint of bitter in pub garden on a warm evening after work.  3. Vanilla pods burnt as incense making my flat smell safe and homey - as if I've been baking.

      1. Getting a sweet email from James in Australia. He has moved out there to get married, and I'm saving up all my days off so I can go down to the wedding. He hopes that my disasterous lovelife will clear 'all obstacles for marriage to an aussie heartthrob with no physical flaws, allowing for your stay in aus to extend into the unknown future and keep me company.'  2. The wind turning the leaves on the lime trees so they flickered glossy dark green and chalky pale green.  3. The hall where my writer's circle meets is a place that makes you feel very small and unloved. We rattle around rather, and the severe acoustics are hard on any attempts at merriment. This week, however, one of the other groups that uses it had left three vases of flowers. One contained an unbelievable blowsey peony - shocking pink with egg-yolk-yellow stamens. We put them out on the tables and for an evening, the hall seemed more welcoming. Perhaps next time we'll bring our own flowers.

      1. Bright blue  urlLink speedwell  growing in rank grass.  2. Strolling through the woods on The Common when it's hot.  3. Coming off the blindingly hot street into the windowless hall of my block. It's got a sort of dry, cellarish coolness.

      1. A friend texted asking how I was. 'Hungover'. He replied that he quite liked being hungover at times. Which made me think of all the reasons why  I  like being hungover. An excuse to stay in bed and avoid painting the bathroom. An excuse to lie in the park and let the sun warm my aching hangover bones.  2. Seeing tiny conker bobbles on horse chestnut trees.  3. Paul V, who doesn't do books, spending ages in my bathroom because he found a book of Mervyn Peake's sketches and poetry. Paul V is a bit addicted to Gormenghast, which is a bit of a puzzle as it can seem impenetrable. I think it's best just to shut up and read, and I am thrilled that Paul has caught this. It's so exciting when people love the same books as me.

(Preface,   urlLink Something to Declare  )  2. A fairy cake with thick icing the colour of early sunset clouds and a pink and yellow dolly mixture on top. It was yummy.  3. Feeling a bit mopish and then getting a text asking if I felt like going round to Caroline's to christen her new flat with wine and chinese.

      1. Two more parcels: one smells of flowery bath things and came from Aunty Biddy and co.   2. The other was a bit of a mystery. In the end, I tore off the cardboard, assuming there would be a parcel inside. There wasn't - but what was in there was nearly as nice. It was a disc with a submission for the next writers' newsletter - which means I don't have to write it all myself - and a book. Raymond Nickford has been reading his intensly spooky psychological novel   urlLink Mister Kreasey's Demon   at the writers' group I go to. Reading out loud to other writers helps the editing process in nit-picky ways. But now his book is published - how exciting is that? There was also a kind note in which he described my writing as 'bubbly' and 'Wodehousian'.  3. Bright yellow ragwort growing on the edge of the common.

      1. I finally bought myself a new handbag. The old one is lovely - it's black with a picture of Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman about to kiss - but I've been fretting for a few weeks that it's a bit wintery, plus it's one you carry in your hand, and I don't think it's doing much for my posture. So this new satchel, which is made of soft sandy corduroy and stiff red-brown leather, is thrice welcomed. I can carry it on my shoulder. It lovely to touch. And it's always pleasing to take everything out of any old handbag and put them into a new one.  2. Two parcels - one from Rosey and one mystery one from Amazon. I don't think I ordered anything, though it's not impossible. But anyway, I'm waiting for my birthday before I open it.  3. I've been a little lazy about food recently, living off packets of noodles and bread and cheese. I went shopping properly, even planning my meals for the next few days, and filled the fridge with fresh food.

It's sitting on a plate on someone's dining room table.  2. A thrush - they're the ones with the speckly breasts - hopping around on the grass with a beakful of something wriggly.   3. Putting my trousers back on after having my legs waxed.

      1. Sitting in the park on a warm evening after work enjoying a bit of quality time with my notebook.  2. Getting an exciting birthday present parcel from my American friend Rich.  3. My notebook - it has a  urlLink Jordi Labanda  illustration on the front. It's spiral bound so I can fold it back on itself, and the paper is punched so if I felt like it, I could tear pages out and file them. It also has a cunning tear strip down the side so you can rip off the scruffy spiral binding holes.

      1. Spending the morning working on Rob and Lou's allotment. Rob and I weeded a row of carrots and cleared a new area of what's going to be the herb garden. I'd forgotten how much I love grovelling around in the mud.  2. The sky was blue, the sun was hot and the air was clear. But we've had so many fine days that I didn't even think to comment on it and spent most of the day asleep. I love the idea that we have had so many perfect days that I feel able to squander them.  3. Lying on your back and looking up into the branches of an oak tree.

      1. I walked into work a different way so I could pick up some breakfast. It meant I could walk in the sunshine, and I noticed another sunflower relief - this time high up on Hooper's, the department store at the top of the high street.  2. The Rose and Crown is an old man's pub. They do a special lunch for £3.95(!) Mine included what was described as 'mash' and turned out to be new potatoes slightly crushed and still in their skins with spring onions and olive oil. I didn't want the plate to end.  3. Estelle explained how she deals with aggressive drivers. She blows kisses at them. It helps that she's got a bit of a Marilyn Munroe thing going...

      1. I noticed a brickwork relief of sunflowers on the first floor of a furniture shop down the road. I pass it almost every day but I'd never spotted it before.  2. A skyful of fluffy white clouds. I wonder why it's such a satisfying sight?  3. Joyce and her daughter Amy dropped by for a cup of tea at half past eight. I love living in a flat that people are always 'just passing'.

      1. The yellow lilies in my bouquet are starting to open. There are still some closed, so I expect they will keep appearing for days.  2. Learning a yoga stretch that makes my spine click much more efficiently than the one I've been doing.  3. Gossiping with Paul V about his Glastonbury plans. I am almost as excited as he is - and I don't have to worry about the rain and the mud.

      1. My mother brought round a few roses from the garden yesterday. They are 'Gertrude Jekyll' - soft but solid pink and very full of petals. Their smell was the first thing I noticed when I woke up.  2. Work gave me an enormous bunch of yellow flowers - a proper bouquet wrapped in tissue and cellophane and ribbons. I don't think I've ever had one before! And Ed made me a special card for everyone to sign.  3. There was half a bottle of champagne left after Sunday, so I had a glass when I got in from work.

      1. We walked through the woods to lunch at The High Rocks. As we arrived, the first few drops of rain fell. It quickly turned into a proper downpour, which lasted until they brought our coffee. After lunch, we walked back to town through sparkly clean woods.  2. Over lunch I complained that I had never seen a toad in my life. As we walked back through the woods, a big, fat warty one in mackingtosh fawn and chocolate brown spots crawled across our path.  3. Jay drove a gang of us down to Cuckmere Haven for a night's camping. Jon, who organised it all, is one of the worst backseat drivers I have ever met - mainly, I think, because he was in a seriously destructive accident several years ago. Jay, who passed his test not long ago, was superhumanly patient with Jon's commentary.  4. As it was my birthday, you get a bonus beautiful thing - the rainbow that followed us out of town.

      1. I cleaned my kitchen floor. It is a different colour and there are no longer fluffs the size of your fist under the computer.  2. The accountant at the Duke of York who whipped out his hem-hem to show off the 16 piercings to three slack-jawed friends.  3. Learning the words to the last two verses of  Seven Drunken Nights .

      1. Peeping through an iron railing gate into a grand garden on my way to work. It has two weeping pussy willows in circular beds on either side of a neat path. I felt like Alice and her door that was too small to get through.  2. The coffee man stamped my loyalty card twice by accident. I did think of mentioning it, but then thought it best not to: it would fluster him and hold up the queue.  3. Tomato and cucumber salad made with properly red tomatoes.

      1. Escaping from a stressy office into bright sun and dancing shadows.  2. Not feeling embarrassed to demarcate my writing time by telling people I'm not up for chatting.  3. My new trousers, which are almost too long and made of slightly crispy linen in thin blonde, sandy and camel-coloured stripes.

      1. Glaucous berries on a  urlLink berberis  bush. And the opportunity to use the word 'glaucous'.  2. When tasks you've been dreading are easier than expected.  3. 'I'm gonna wash that man right outa my hair', 'Happy Talk' and 'Honey Bun' from  South Pacific

      1. Coming out into cool evening air from a flat full of cooking  2. The orange fur on the back of a rabbit's neck.  3. The smell of lime trees in bloom. The scent appears and disappears from pace to pace. At first, I thought I must have imagined it.

      Owing to popular demand, I would like to make special mention of the new picture in Fenella's hallway. A gift from her gentleman friend, Andrew, it shows four strawberries tastefully arranged in the form of affectionate dogs.

      1. At 9.30am I got a call from Fenella inquiring about lunch. At 10.30am I got a call from Rob wondering if I wanted breakfast at the cafe in Calverley Rec. At 1pm I got a call from Caroline asking about tea in the park. And when I finally got a moment to myself at 8pm, Cat called from Germany wanting to know if now was a good time to chat. I did them all, and didn't feel in the slightest bit guilty about not spending the day writing.  2. Long, warm afternoons lying on a rug in the Grove with a bottle of wine.  3. Getting into bed on Sunday night. I look around the flat, which is tidy and as clean as it ever is and feel ready to face the week ahead.

      1. Reading   urlLink A Hatful of Sky   by Terry Pratchett and enjoying it hugely. It's about a young girl learning to be a witch. He is quite hard on the occult jewellery brigade. I have been reading his books since I was 13, and I love the way he has improved. I reckon one or two of his books will turn out to be classics.   2. I walked to Linda's along Pembury Road. This is one of the main roads out of Tunbridge Wells and normally when I travel it, I'm being driven. Because I was walking, I noticed all sorts of things - a house called 'The Walled Garden' and a couple of artists' houses with 'open studio' signs. I decided that I would investigate these as soon as possible.  3. Andy made me a staff. The storms this week blew down half a white maple in his front garden, and he said that one of the branches was just my size. It's very plain - marked with a sign for fire, and OGMA and BRIDGET written in ogham script. The pale wood seems to glow at dusk. Andy said that he worked on in the rain and under the moon. He thought that when I got stuck with writing, I could take it for a walk. I don't normally do accoutrements, but I was so touched by this gift - and by the other presents he, Laura and Tally gave me. There was a diary by  urlLink Shakti Gawain  that will help me improve my intuition, and a portable incense kit - a tiny burner and some short incense sticks.

      1. Bacon sandwhiches made on malted brown bread.  2. Waking up from a kip and realising that I have three minutes to dress for a party; and then getting a call from Paul V to say that he is running late.  3. My Wonderbra.

      1. Being puzzled because the hayfevery, sickly, loo-cleanerish smell of privet flowers makes me feel vaguely happy, then remembering the reason why.  2.  urlLink The BBC pips .  3. The taste of butter when you haven't had it for ages and ages.

      1. We had been promised dirty weather by teatime. There was something unreal about the sky all day - grey clouds piled up in rolled waves.  2. We drew faces on balloons and let them out of the office window. The wind snatched mine and it flew away over the hospital.  3. I've been struggling for *weeks* with a specially tricky dungeon boss on  Zelda: Ocarina of Time . I finally trounced him and his master sent him between dimensions as a punishment.

      1. A woman with thick grey hair enjoying the sun on the bit of grass between the road and common. She had her elegant doberman pinscher lying down beside her with its head up like a sphinx. Its coat was glossy black black black and its nose and bum were the colour of brandy with the sun shining through it.  2. A patch of rough grass run to seed, all different species, with low late afternoon sun shining through it.  3. Walking down a quiet street of houses and seeing cats hiding in front gardens.

      1. Rain is falling straight down and the world is still, apart from when a drop lands on a leaf and shakes the branch.  2. Cinnabar moth caterpillars eating ragwort. They are dirty orange and look as if they are strung with black rubber tyres.  3. Home-made gooseberry jam.

      1. There is a spotted flycatchers' nest just above the door of my parents' shed. It's cunningly hidden behind a rambling rector rose. Daddy says it's a absolute textbook nest - 'A scruffy nest of moss on a ledge on a building behind creepers,' according to the book. Mr Flycatcher sits on the fence tutting if you approach. 'I've never seen him do anything constructive.'  2. A blackbird swallowing wild cherries.  3. Red currants. Their skins are translucent and glossy, so they seem to shine like jewels. They squish easily though, so picking them stains your hands.

      1. Flower stalls at stations. &nbsp; 2. I got a bus from Brighton station to Cat's parents' house. The moment on that journey when I first&nbsp;glimpsed the sea. &nbsp; 3. Cat, who will always be small for her age, appearing from behind the enormous front door. She's on a flying visit from Germany, and I haven't seen her since before Christmas.

      1. A skater fell off his board and landed in a nettle patch. I was far enough away that I could smirk in safety. &nbsp; 2.  urlLink Green and Black's  cherry chocolate. &nbsp; 3. My apron. Katie made it from curtain material off-cuts. When I wash up last thing it stops me soaking my night dress. It also gives me somewhere to wipe my hands and it has a useful pocket in which to lose the corkscrew.

      1. The smell of tar used for repairing roads.  2. Seeing my little brother for the first time since Easter.  3. Hearing Radio 4 coming faintly from a parked car. Even though I can't hear the actual words, I know it is Radio 4 and couldn't be anything else. I think it reminds me of being picked up by my father after Saturday school.

      1. The seedheads of hawksbit (Hieracium). They look like thuggish dandylions.  2. The tunnel between Eridge Road and the Pantiles. One moment it's hot, bright, noisy roadside, and the next it's the quiet, shady and cool Pantiles.  3. Cherry tomatoes. They taste like tomatoes but as small enough to eat in one go so I don't end up with pips and pulp all down my front.

      1. A boy of about eight with hair growing straight from the top of his head. It lay flat like a helmet - apart from a little tuft at on the crown. He also had a face full of freckles and front teeth a bit too big for his mouth.  2. Flour Power chocolate brownies. They are huge, sticky and very chocolatey.  3. Watching the High Street in a hail storm. The traffic slowed right down. There was no noise but the rush of hail. Everyone - even people with umbrellas - sheltered in doorways and under shop awnings. The flag on the estate agents went limp. Shopkeepers stopped work and stood in their doorways looking on. When it was over, everyone hurried on with what they were doing pretending that nothing had happened.

      1. Putting my paycheck in the bank after what seems like a 40-day month.  2. The smell inside the old slam-door trains. I think it reminds me of my parents coming home from work.  3.

      1.  urlLink Len Shelley's  frankly peculiar art. He&nbsp;beachcombs bits of dead fish, bird skulls and driftwood and  urlLink arranges them in a box . Bizarre google-eyed creatures are frozen in the snippets of overheard conversation that title each box:  They Brought Children for him to Touch  and&nbsp; In Summer there are Wasps  and  He bought a harpy from a petshop in Japan . There is an exhibition on now in Tunbridge Wells library. Don't forget to read the guestbook - 'Twaddle - like a first-year art student' and 'disgusting' and 'the poor horse' and 'as a vegetarian I was very offended'.   2. Malteasers. One sweet, so many dimensions. They're chocolate. They crunch. You can suck them and they melt. Yum.   3. Finding a book with instructions for an origami pig.&nbsp;A chap at uni made&nbsp;one for me once, and I could never work out how he did it. I think this must be the same book he had, because he told me about a ring of 12 cranes made from one sheet of paper. I didn't believe him, but it's there in the book!  Step-by-step Origami  by Steve and Megumi Biddle.

      1. Being driven out to a pub in the country at lunchtime.  &nbsp; 2. Supper in the park with mozzarella, tomatoes, cheese and bread.  &nbsp; 3. Vanilla sugar - put vanilla pods in a jar. Pour caster sugar over them. After a few weeks, you too can make everyone think you are a domestic goddess. It's good on strawberries, or in cakes. It also burns as incense and makes the whole flat smell of baking. It's a very homey, comforting smell. Apparently it's good for seducing men, too.

We sat in the sun under the house on the rock and he ate an e-nor-mous salad bowl from Safeway. I had a salmon and cucumber sandwich and an apple.  3.  Northern Exposure . When my friends first started driving, we used to gather at Glen's house on a Sunday evening to watch this quirky and slightly magical show about Cicely, Alaska. It's a place where a 20-year-old girl can get together with a man old enough to be her grandfather and it doesn't seem weird. It featured the lovely, lovely  urlLink John Corbett  as layabout DJ artist Chris 'in the morning' Stephens. Sigh.

Saki's short stories, in particular  urlLink  Excepting Mrs. Pentherby   and  urlLink  Shock Tactics  .  3. Going to the theatre outside. It combines a celebration of summer evenings with a special kind of optimism about the weather. We saw  Garden , which is half of an  urlLink Alan Ayckbourn  play titled  urlLink  House and Garden  .  House  was being performed simultaneously inside the theatre.

      1. The way the sun shines into my flat. It's like being woken up by someone who is all excited about whatever it is we're about to spend the day doing.  2.  urlLink House of Leaves  - a labyrinth in book form. A photojournalist gets lost in his own house and makes a film about it. A blind man writes about the film and then dies. His editor, a troubled trainee tattoo artist, is discovering that drugs and random sex are no substitute for a firm grip on reality. The text twists around the page and footnotes lead you astray.  3. Christopher sent me a draft of a short story which made me laugh out loud.

      1. Heading back to work after a satisfying lunchtime shopping foray and realising I still have 20 minutes left.  2. The security of knowing my new spider plant (courtesy of Jason) is absorbing harmful radiation from my screen.  3. Laura suggested I might get the shine back in my hair by applying almond oil and leaving it for two hours before washing it out. I spent the early evening looking like a chav and wondering what I would do if it wouldn't wash out. But it shampooed out beautifully and my hair felt softer than it has in ages. So that was all right.

      1. Going to pay for a set of silk undies the colour of an African sunset and discovering they were £5 cheaper than it said on the label.  2. A parcel from Katie containing two pink hair bobbles. Each has two plastic spheres the size of the large kind of marble full of water and sparkly bits.  3. Being woken by a fight below my window. It involved three belligerent girls, a fat bouncer and the police. There was proper swearing 'Look what he's done to her!' and 'I'm gonna take you to court!' and 'Just go home now!' and 'If you don't move on I'll nick you.' I could even hear the policeman on the radio describing what she saw on CCTV. If only I'd had some popcorn.

Talking novels with Peter, a writer my own age.

      1. Early in the morning while walking Sprite on the on the scrubby almost-park at the back of the house I saw a boy and a girl from the council estate over the valley. They walked hand in hand along the top of the bank, and then the girl said: 'There it is!' She slid down the bank on her bum and picked something up out of the grass.  2. Explaining the train announcement ticker to two nervous Japanese tourists and feeling oddly proud. The trains may be late, but at least we know by how many minutes, damn it.  3. Sandy dust under bare feet.

      1. Rowan berries. Mountain ash trees are a-flame here. The berries are bright, bright scarlet and the leaves are a dusty jade. I love them because they are so bold and so intensely colourful at a time of year when so many things look a bit faded and and crispy and mildewy. They are also rather sad because they mean autumn is on the way.  2. Falling asleep in the shade over a book.  3. The squeaky noises that guinea pigs make.

      1. Dried mango - sweet and chewy and free from fresh mango's dribbliness.  2. Walking home with black clouds piling up in the sky behind me.  3. Origami  urlLink mouse . This is one of the first models I learnt. This traditional design is simple but it has something essentially mousish about it. I prefer the traditional designs because of this. And being simple, it's easy to do a good job of them. This one is particularly good with thickish paper.

      1. Spanish oj - it tastes properly of oranges - sourness, bitterness and all - which Florida juice does not. Florida juice tastes as if it has been sugared and watered down. The supermarket I use has recently changed hands and now offers both. Plus Spanish juice means fewer food miles. Hurrah.  2. Opening a packet of thick and beautifully patterned origami paper and using it to make a couple of models involving pleasing moves.  3. Washing your hair after a sticky day.

      1. Feeling ill at work, going home, having a couple of hours' kip with a hot water bottle. I woke up feeling fine and was able to scoot back for an afternoon's work. I really, really like living so close to the office.  2. As juicy a piece of steak as I've ever had the pleasure of putting on my plate.  3.   urlLink The Remains of the Day   by  urlLink Kazuo Ishiguro  which I read in one sitting and enjoyed hugely. I was intrigued all the way through by the love story and fascinated by the manservant-gentleman relationship. The story-telling technique was masterly, too - Stevens is writing as his journey unfolds, so we really have no idea what is going to happen next in the outer story.

      1. Walking a 20ft maze drawn in the sand.  2. Swimming in the sea on a hot day.  3. Mr Men ice lollies - small, cheap, tasty and free from artificial colourings, they are as welcome today as they were when I was at school.

      1. Janet Ellis standing in on  Excess Baggage . Her chinchillaish voice vortexes me back to teatime television like  Jigsaw  and  Blue Peter .  2. A man sitting in the window of a cafe. Sunlight reflected off his cup of coffee rippled on his face.  3. Finding the perfect pair of shoes on the morning of the day I need them. They match my new undies.
