       My friend Marc sent me this  urlLink link ... you know, some people get exactly what they deserve.  I'm leaving for Florida tonight to spend Thanksgiving with the family.  Will be nice to get out of the city for a few days and spend time with them, but it just doesn't seem right for it to be 80 degrees at the end of November...

       While buying lunch, the guy ahead of me paid his $6.30 in quarters... and the retard kept losing count and having to start over... what a douche.  If only my knife hadn't been made out of plastic... and if only I had the guts to back up statements like that...

       Oh boy, lots to complain about today...  Once again, the subways are the bane of my existence... trying to get to Brooklyn on Saturday night, need to take the L to Bedford, but of course the L isn't running over the weekend.  Signs say that a shuttle bus will make all L stops.  Wait for a shuttle bus, finally get one, it takes forever to make its way east, then drops everyone off at the brown JMZ line.  People complain that the bus is supposed to be making L stops in Brooklyn, but the driver just keeps repeating "Take train to Brooklyn."  Get on a J, even though I've never ridden that line before and have no idea where it drops me.  Through some stroke of luck I run into a friend on his way to the same party right after I get off the train, and am good to go.  After almost a 2-hour trip, that is.  On the way home, I take the J again, and get somewhat excited that I can take it to Broadway-Fulton and transfer to a 2 or 3 to take me uptown.  Wrong again, as for some reason the J stops at Chambers.  "End of the line."  Only train to transfer to is the 4, which goes up the east side.  I consider taking it to Grand Central to take the shuttle across to Times Square and then grabbing a 2/3, but then remember that of course the shuttle doesn't run late at night.  So I take the 4 up to 77th and then have to cab it through the park.  Another hour and a half worth of travel.  Fucking MTA...  I should have probably done this already, but I think I'm officially done with  ER .  (Spoiler alert!!!) They  urlLink killed off Dr. Romano .  A helicopter fell on him.  Reread that last sentence.  A HELICOPTER FELL ON HIM!!!  This is the same character who lost his arm in a helicopter accident only 14 months ago!  Even Wile E. Coyote isn't that unlucky.  Romano's insults were the saving grace on the show for the past few years.  What a great character.  What will they do to fill the void?  I won't be watching to find out.  Went to scout talent at a comedy show at Above Kleptomania on Friday night.  That would be the comedy club sitting atop a peep show on 8th Ave.  Sketchy to begin with, so I had my doubts about the quality of the show.  First act, a sketch comedy group called Skeeger.  Not very good, but one or two good moments.  Second group was  urlLink The Josh & Tamra Show , which was the reason we went.  Improv puppet show.  Actually very funny.  Good enough to merit a link to their site.  Third group, Undercover Burnout.  So bad that for the last 20 minutes (of about a 22-minute show) I just kept thinking that I should take the gum I was chewing at stick it in the hair of the girl sitting next to me, since that would be so much more entertaining than what was happening onstage.  Then, as we were leaving, the 3 girls I'm with want to check out a peep show, so we wander in, they being totally oblivious to the fact that the rooms hold one person and clueless as to what's going on behind the closed doors.  I managed to herd them out without removing my hands from my jacket pockets.    I'll close with one more subway story... on my way out to Brooklyn, I see a mother with a little girl in a stroller.  The girl is flipping through an issue of BuenHogar magazine (all my years of high-school Spanish lead me to believe that the title translates to "Good Fireplace," but that can't be right).  I can't translate a lot of what's on the cover, but I do see the word "SEXO."  Now this girl may not be able to read yet, but should she really be looking at magazines like that?  Whatever happened to  urlLink Highlights ?  And why do parents think that their parental responsibilities don't exist on the subway?  A couple weeks ago I stared as a mother watched her 6-year-old daughter licking a pole on the subway!  Does she want her child to get polio?  This city never ceases to amaze me...

       Earlier this week, the  urlLink 8 finalists  for the World Trade Center Site Memorial Competition were announced.  I'm not wild about any of them, but if I had to choose a favorite, I'd go with Lower Waters.  Still, am I the only person who thinks that such a memorial is unnecessary?  Yes, we should have  something  that commemorates the lives of those who died in the September 11 attacks.  But these designs are gratuitously ornate.  The city, which is in the midst of a  huge  budget deficit, should not be spending millions and millions of dollars constructing such elaborate sites, when the money could be used for much greater good.  I would guess that families of the victims would, if asked, prefer that we spend money to help the homeless, boost education, or pay for more police and sanitation, instead of on 2,982 spotlights in a garden (as suggested by Garden of Lights).  The WTC attack was a tragedy, and we should never forget those we have lost.  But I don't think that we need this type of memorial to preserve their memory, especially when we can put that money to much more important use.

       In this  urlLink interview , Blink 182 claim that they almost named their newest album "Our Pet Sounds," but ultimately common sense took over and they rejected it.  This story does make me happy, though, in that a modern band like Blink has appreciation for the Beach Boys classic, which has been losing its luster in the music community for years.  As opposed to the consistent popularity of the Beatles, the Beach Boys legacy has been tarnished by the buffoonery of Mike Love and lawsuits among the different touring groups claiming the Beach Boys name.  Although it used to fight tooth and nail with "Sgt. Pepper" over the title of greatest album of all time, it's status has taken a beating.  VH1's countdown in 2001 of the  urlLink Top 100 Albums  had "Pet Sounds" at #3, behind "Revolver" and "Nevermind" (!).  Too many people now write the Beach Boys off as fluff, and aside from "Pet Sounds," the rest of their catalog is virtually ignored.  Fortunately, there have been some encouraging signs of late.  Rolling Stone's new issue on the  urlLink 500 Greatest Albums  has "Pet Sounds" at #2 (behind "Sgt. Pepper"), and many artists, including Scott Weiland, Sean Lennon, and Paul McCartney (perhaps the biggest "Pet Sounds" advocate there is) continue to praise the album in interviews.  Also, Brian Wilson has been touring and playing the album in its entirety, to rave reviews.  While I don't think that average Blink fans would go out and buy "Pet Sounds" after reading that interview, I can hope that they do.  Not just for the sake of the legacy, but for the listener.  " urlLink Pet Sounds " is beautiful music.  Everyone should listen to it.    * Note - in my mind, "Sgt. Pepper" isn't the best Beatles album.  Although it's terrific, no album with "When I'm Sixty-Four" and "Good Morning, Good Morning" could be considered the best anything.  "Abbey Road," "The Beatles" (aka "The White Album"), and "Revolver" are all superior.

       So a warrant is out for  urlLink Michael Jackson .  Another  urlLink alleged child molestation charge .  And here were are, on the 10th anniversary of his first one.  This is a very poor way of drumming up interest for his upcoming album, at least in my opinion.  Or maybe the 70+ police officers just wanted an excuse to spend a day at Neverland Ranch.  I can picture them riding the Ferris Wheel, ramming each other with bumper cars, eating cotton candy, all while “searching for clues.”  What a sham.  Anyway, should be interesting to see how this plays out, especially since he has had some financial difficulties over the past few years and may not be able to afford another $20 million settlement.   On the subject of music (and inappropriateness), I watched  Pumping Iron  for the first time over the weekend.  Has there ever been a worse mismatch in terms of a film’s themesong?  If you haven’t heard this classic folk ditty by Michael Small, give it a  urlLink listen .  You don’t have to see the movie to know that it just doesn’t fit.  What were they thinking?  One final musical note (no pun intended)… what has happened to regular albums?  It seems like everything released these days is a greatest hits or compilation.  Off the top of my head, I can think of No Doubt, Michael Jackson, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Stone Temple Pilots, J-Lo (by the way, the words “J-Lo” and “greatest hits” don’t deserve to be anywhere near each other… even separately, “J-Lo” with “greatest” or “hits” should be banned), REM, Madonna, Sheryl Crow, Pearl Jam, David Bowie, and Bruce Springsteen all putting these out recently.  At least these artists have enough material to merit such collections… remember when Fine Young Cannibals put out “ urlLink Finest ” after only 2 albums and 4 top-40 singles?  Yeah, didn’t think so… Regardless, this online music debacle sure has ruined the concept of albums.  Now people only care about singles.  Think we’ll ever get another “Dark Side of the Moon,” “Tommy,” or “Pet Sounds”?  The only band that comes to mind in terms of cohesive albums is Radiohead, and I haven’t been able to listen to their last three releases.  Not that there’s anything wrong with a lifetime of  urlLink VH1 Classic  and  urlLink Q104.3 ...

       I’ve been holding off on ranting about the downfall of  The Simpsons  for quite some time now.  But after watching this Sunday’s episode (and some prodding by my friend Gabe), I can’t bite my tongue anymore.  What the hell has happened to my favorite show?  It’s brutal!  Having an entire episode parody  Evita  is so out-of-touch with its audience, I don’t even know where to begin.  The writers spent so much time incorporating the Simpson universe into the story of Eva Peron that they forgot to write any jokes.  In the 3 episodes so far this season, I have laughed ONE TIME… during the final “Treehouse of Horror” segment, when Homer is trying to eat the donuts that keep disappearing.  That’s one laugh over three episodes.   A Minute with Stan Hooper  has a better track record than that!   Over the past few seasons, I have noticed many things wrong with  The Simpsons .  Here are some suggestions on how to fix them.  (Note - for more info on episodes that I reference, please check the best and most comprehensive website ever,  urlLink The Simpsons Archive ) 1) Eliminate shows in which each segment is its own storyline.  This includes the annual Halloween episodes and inserting the Simpsons into old stories (see “Tales from the Public Domain” and “Simpsons Tall Tales”).  Parodies should fit naturally into original storylines; if the writers do this too often, it means they are out of ideas. 2) As an offshoot of this, keep the Simpsons in Springfield.  Except for the New York episode, it is murder when they leave their environment.(see “Simpson Safari” and “Blame It On Lisa”). 3) Yet another offshoot of this is to keep the Simpsons grounded in reality.  Yes, it’s a cartoon, and this allows the show to do things that other sitcoms cannot.  But recently the show has taken storylines to ridiculous levels (see “The Computer Wore Menace Shoes” and “The Frying Game”). 4) There is no need for celebrity voices in every episode.  Also, celebrity voices usually work better when they do not play themselves (exceptions do occur, particularly when celebrities present awards, and often musicians can override this, but not always).  Danny DeVito as Herb… great.  David Byrne as himself (“Dude, Where’s My Ranch?”)… not great.  Donald Sutherland as Hollis Hurlbut (“Lisa the Iconoclast”)… great.  Butch Patrick as himself (“Eight Misbehavin’”)… not great.  And Michael Moore on this week’s episode was so completely pointless as to not even merit a comment. 5) Stop solidifying scenarios that have been hinted at for year.  For example, the relationship between Lenny and Karl.  It was somewhat funny and bizarre that they spent so much time together.  Now they seem to me making it a full-blown homosexual relationship.  Mind you, I have no problem with homosexual relationships.  But it was better left unsaid.  Oh, and naming them Karl Karlson and Lenny Leonard is just plain dumb. 6) Ease up on the jokes about genitals.   7) Ease up on injuring Homer. 8) Basically, simplify!  Get back to basics! Regardless of my problems with the show, I will continue to watch  The Simpsons  every week.  Their years of incredible episodes have earned my loyalty.  To commemorate the 300th episode,  urlLink this website  gave 300 reasons to love  The Simpsons  (note that almost every one is from the first 10 seasons).  I could easily make it 3,000.  I recently watched Season 3 on DVD, and every episode is terrific, even though the show had not yet reached its pinnacle.  But I no longer consider it the best show on tv… that would be  The Office .  Nor is it the best animated show on tv… that would be  South Park  (for comparison’s sake, watch  South Park’s  parody of  The Simpsons  in “The Simpsons Already Did It” vs.  The Simpson’s  parody of  South Park  in “The Bart of War” – that alone should convince you).   I fear that the image of  The Simpsons  has been permanently damaged.  I hope they can turn it around before the end.

       What is up with  urlLink Roger Ebert  lately?  He has given a "thumbs up" the last 13 films he's reviewed (meaning at least 3 stars on a 4-star scale).  I have not seen all 13 of these films, so I cannot judge all of them.  But I have seen  Elf ,  The Singing Detective , and  Matrix Revolutions , all of which he gave 3 stars.   Elf  was okay; I wouldn't have given 3, but I'll give Ebert the benefit of the doubt.   The Singing Detective  was a garbled mess, redeemed only be good performances by Robert Downey Jr. and Mel Gibson.  And if you scroll down a few days, you'll see my thoughts on the worst movie of the new millenium,  Matrix Revolutions .  If you read his review, he says that he didn't even really like or understand the movie.  I think that maybe Ebert's body may have reached its saturation point for fat, which is now making its way to his brain and causing a short-circuit (much like in the episode of  The Simpsons  where  urlLink Apu gets fired  and lives with the Simpson family... and after Homer compliments Apu's cooking of vegetables, which supposedly clear the cholesterol out his heart, we see the cholesterol travel from his heart to his brain, causing Homer to remark "Uh, Apu me friend good.").  Maybe I should try another reviewer... but they're all so damn  urlLink ugly ...   AL MVP award is announced today, and if it's not A-rod, Frank Thomas, or Carlos Delgado because none of their teams made the playoffs, expect some fireworks from me in my next post...

       Last night I went to the Lion's Den for a  urlLink Decent Xposure  show.  Decent Xposure attempts to, well, give exposure to unsigned bands.  The show overall was pretty good, but I since I have this page, I may as well give props to my favorite band of the night,  urlLink The Low Life .  Check out their site for info and sound clips...

       Wow, another sad day.  Drummer Tony Thompson, only 48, has  urlLink passed away .  I can say that I wasn't a very big fan of Chic (or disco music in general), although it's hard to dislike "Good Times" (at the very least because it led to "Rapper's Delight" and "Another One Bites the Dust").  But I was a fan (in a very guilty pleasure sort of way) of Power Station, at least of their 80's album, which I still have on vinyl.  And I couldn't deny his talent.  And now I'm scared, because half of the supergroup has died in less than two months (Robert Palmer, who from what I've read and heard was one of the nicest, most genuine people in the industry, died on September 26).  That leaves the two Taylors, who are in the midst of a surprisingly powerful  urlLink Duran Duran  reunion.  This curse must end here.  I know that bad things happen in threes.  Let's hope that this case is an exception.  And Tony Thompson, you will be missed (as will Robert Palmer... I would have given you your proper due had my blog existed back in September).  Went to a  urlLink Troma  party at Planet Hollywood last night.  Well, it wasn't really a "Troma party," but it was a party that Troma helped sponsor, and featured a Toxie, a Sgt. Kabukiman NYPD, and Tromettes.  And lots of booze.  And Lloyd Kaufman filming DVD intros.  All the basic ingredients of a Troma party.  I worked at Troma for almost a year.  When I first got the job, I couldn't have been more thrilled to be a part of the company responsible for  Killer Condom  and  Chopper Chicks in Zombietown .  But the shine rubs off very quickly, especially when as the biggest person in the office you are forced to wear the Toxic Avenger outfit, featuring heavy latex mask with one eyehole that doesn't line up with your eye and no nose or mouth holes.  At least naked women were always willing to frolic with Toxie.  And I must give Lloyd credit.  For all of the shit, he still manages to crank out lots of product, with various degrees of success, through incredible guerilla tactics.  It was quite remarkable watching him recruit the hottest women at the party to jump and jiggle for the camera.  Troma has been going strong for 30 years.  It's the cockroach of the movie industry, and will probably be around long after the other studios have been decimated.  More power to them.  I just will never work there again.

       One more thing... Today at 5:30pm, author  urlLink Nick Hornby  will be at the  urlLink Wall Street Borders  to read from "Songbook," his collection of essays about his favorite music.  Anyone who's ever read any Hornby (or seen either  High Fidelity  or  About a Boy ) should be keenly aware that this guy KNOWS his music.  My friend Tommy gave me this book as a birthday present, and it's incredible.  Even if you aren't familiar with some of the songs, his passion about them is infectious and extremely entertaining, and I'm sure that the passion will only intensify in person.  Should be a great talk.  I wish I could go.  P.S.  Tommy also KNOWS his music, and often writes about it in  urlLink his blog .  Check it out, won't you?

       Very windy NYC morning... the MTV building is swaying and creaking non-stop... more than a little creepy.  Supposed to get cold today... and those 40 mph winds sure won't help.  Doesn't bother me, though.  Everyone thinks I'm crazy when I tell them I like the cold, seeing as how I'm from Florida.  But after growing up with 18 years of heat and non-seasons, the cold is a welcome change.  Mother Earth, bring it on, biyatch!  Is it illegal to shoot pigeons with an air rifle?  Animal cruelty?  I really need to look into this, because I'm reaching my breaking point.  Normally I have no problem with pigeons, but I have a major problem with the ones that sit on the ledge outside my bedroom window and coo every morning at like 7am.  Every freakin' morning.  And I either have to try to ignore them (impossible) or drag myself out of bed and rattle the window to get them to scatter, which ruins my comfort zone and only works temporarily.  Man, how sweet it would be to be able to pick them off one by one... or maybe I can hire  urlLink Randy Johnson  to eliminate the birds...  Finally today, a quick Simpsons-related link... of all the "inventions" from the show,  urlLink this  is the one that's been emulated?  Why not the baby translator?  The electric hammer?  Even the hamburger ear-muffs or the Everything's Okay alarm?

       Just read this  urlLink great article  about Matsui being robbed of the Rookie of the Year award.  There are also several articles in newspapers across the country in which Steinbrenner makes a similar argument.  Why do I mention this?  Well, because I made this very point in my post yesterday morning, long before anyone else did.  Of course Mike Greenberg's column is better written, more thought-out, more articulate than my post... I'm just saying, is all...

       Really sad news about  urlLink Art Carney .  A few years ago my dad made me start watching reruns of "The Honeymooners" on TV Land, and as Norton he really was so talented and funny.  Between his death and John Ritter's, the world of television will soon be left with very few good physical comics (I think the best right now is Ricky Gervais of the British show " urlLink The Office "), and we'll be stuck watching talentless actors delivering lame one-liners.  "Friends" is a perfect example of the downward spiral of sitcoms... the show used to utilize the physical talents of Matthew Perry, Matt LeBlanc, and even Jennifer Aniston.  Now they force us to sit through jokes about Ross not being able to stand up until his erection dies down.  ("Friends" also may be the worst offender at adding unnecessary beats to jokes, as if to explain that what we just heard really was a joke... example from a recent episode, where Ross says "Ask him if it would be faster if we cut the baby's face off the penis so we could put it on the bunny... That is a weird sentence" - do we really need the second line?  What's the point?  If the audience didn't realize that it's a weird sentence, then it's not a good joke).  Sexual jokes are not necessarily as funny as writers think they are, and writers have become way too reliant on them ("The Simpsons" is as guilty of this as any show... stop going for cheap laughs and outrageous situations and get back to social commentary and youthful observations, PLEASE!!!).  If you readers think I'm crazy, please watch an episode or two (or all of them, as I'm sure there will be a marathon soon) of "The Honeymooners," and you'll see what I'm talking about.  While I'm in a ranting mood (shocker), let's discuss UPS.  UPS sucks.  They make every effort to ensure that customers will NOT be at their apartments for delivery.  Last Tuesday I got a notice that I missed delivery of a package, and that they'd attempt another delivery tomorrow between 10:30am and 2:30pm.  Now I, like a large percentage of normal people, work during the day.  And thanks to the laws of physics, I cannot be in two different places at the same time (time travel movies may argue differently, but time travel leads to all sorts of trouble - please refer to  Timecop  for more details).  I call UPS to ask them to set the delivery for the "Before 10:30am" slot.  They tell me that they can't change the delivery time.  So basically they have me over a barrel.  I get a second notice Wednesday, obviously.  So even though the box saying "sign to authorize delivery in your absence" isn't checked, I check it myself, sign the back of the notice, and leave it for Mr. UPS Delivery Guy.  Get home from work on Thursday to another notice that they couldn't open the door.  Of course you couldn't, jackass, I'm not home.  That's why I signed the note to leave it.  But they didn't leave it.  Friday I get another notice saying they attempted a final delivery.  I call UPS and they say that the package will be at the pick-up center in the middle of Buttfuck for the next 5 business days and I need to go get it myself.  Can I get it tomorrow (Saturday)?  Nope, they're closed on weekends.  How late are they open on weekdays?  5pm.  Thanks, that's very helpful to the working man.  I finally convince them to please deliver it to my office on Monday, as there is a mailroom and it can definitely be delivered.  The woman, although pleasant, has to take my information 3 times (!), claiming that for some reason the computer keeps deleting it.  Hmm, if I had to guess whether the mistakes originated from the computer or from Ms. Minimum-Wage UPS Customer Service Worker, I think you can guess which one I'd choose.  So when she finally tells me I'm set for delivery for Monday, I think I'm good to go.  I should've known better.  Monday rolls around, and no package.  I call at the end of the day, and get another Ms. MWUCSW, who tells me she has no record of the redelivery.  So I have to give all my information AGAIN, for redelivery now scheduled on Tuesday.  Miracle of miracles, I finally do get my package yesterday, although now I have to lug it home from the office myself.  Moral of this story?  UPS SUCKS!!!  Is it really that difficult to have delivery times after work?  In the long run, it would probably be beneficial to them, as they wouldn't have to send drivers out multiple times to leave notices.    But that would be a wise decision, and UPS's corporate policy doesn't allow wise decisions...

       Lots to talk about today, so let's get things started...  1) Happy Veteran's Day.  To all the soldiers fighting in the Middle East (and the rest of the world), I hope you come home safely.  2) Saw the Paris Hilton tape yesterday.  At least 3 minutes of it.  It's shot nightvision-style, so it's all green and their eyes glow devilishly.  It's pretty hardcore.  And her parents' claim that Paris is so whacked out of her mind that she doesn't know what's going on is absolutely not true.  She's completely lucid, talking to the camera and even stopping the romp for a bit to answer her ringing cell phone.  Overall, fairly entertaining.  Watch it if you can find it.  I hope I don't get sued for showing it to all my co-workers.  3) I wish I could similarly recommend  urlLink The Matrix Revolutions , which I saw on an IMAX screen last night (the link shows that only 1/3 of critics have given it a positive review, although the number should be much much lower than that... more like ZERO).  I think it is probably the worst movie I've seen since the turn of the century.  It is excruciatingly boring... the action is tedious... the ending is a major cop-out... nothing in this one is remotely as good as the second film, which I didn't even like very much.  People laughed at the dialogue and actually booed when the end credits rolled.  I usually complain that the public at large is full of idiots (not you readers, of course), and that mob mentality sucks, but in this case they were right on.  4) So why did voters deny Matsui the  urlLink AL Rookie of the Year  award, claiming his previous experience in Japan, when they willingly gave the award to Ichiro and ignored the same mitigating factors?  It's because Matsui is a Yankee.  And that sucks.  Matsui and Berroa both hit .287, and Berroa had 17 HR compared to Matsui's 16.  But Matsui hit 50% more RBIs, struck out 14 fewer times in almost 60 more at-bats, and walked more than twice as often, given him a much higher OBP.  People say that Berroa had 21 SB vs. Matsui's 2, but that only translated into 10 more runs for Berroa... and really, what good is a stolen base if it doesn't translate into a run?  I'm sick of this constant Yankee hatred from most of the nation.  Based on the definition of a rookie and the criteria for the award, Matsui deserved it, and he got robbed.  I've got more, but I'll save it for another post.

       Well, Brandon Webb just got screwed out of the  urlLink NL Rookie of the Year  by jackasses who are more into hype and image than quality.  Yes, Dontrelle Willis had a better record, but Webb had a better ERA (6th best in all of baseball), WHIP, and more strikeouts per inning, and kept Arizona alive when Johnson and Schilling were MIA.  Willis also had more run support, which led to more wins... not to mention an atrocious second-half colapse (5-5, 4.60 ERA) that relegated him to the bullpen in the playoffs.  But why should people care about an entire season?    Also, it seems that  urlLink Kylie Minogue  now makes clothes out of her used shower curtains.  Oh, and she has ugly shower curtains.

       Apparently   urlLink Joe Schmo   himself has spun his idiocy into a development deal.  Great for him.  Sad for television in general.  Matt Kennedy Gould (yes, pathetic that I know his real name) is no tv personality.  Except for his incredible talent of having his eyes practically bulge out of their sockets, I have no reason to watch him.  He's boring.  BORING.  Remember that woman who was on  Ripley's Believe It Or Not  who really could have her eyes pop out of their sockets?  I think she was also in a pizza commercial or something... she was cool.  She should have a development deal.  Not MKG.  Shame on Spike TV.  On the subject of  Joe Schmo , I loved the show.  Thought it was great.  Until they totally pussied out in the final episode.  Why the sugarcoating?  Why let him off so easily?  They undermined the entire point of the show... make a total jackass out of an unsuspecting moron.  But no... they felt bad for him.  The "fake" prizes became real and all went ot him.  The cast all apologized.  Some of them cried.  He didn't even seem that upset... just confused (lots of eye-bulging).  The show would have been infinitely better had they said "We're all actors... nothing is real... no prizes for you... see ya, putz."  Spike TV is a network for men.  Men want to see carnage.  This was no carnage.  Shame on Spike TV.  One more thing... tough weekend for Florida football teams.  UM and FSU both lost Saturday; since they are both out of the national title hunt with two losses, I'm officially done with college football for the year, at least with I-A... as for I-AA, Penn wrapped up at least a share of the Ivy League title... can they finish the season undefeated and crack the I-AA Top 10?  Am I the only person on earth who cares?  Then Fins and Bucs both lost on Sunday.  The Dolphins loss was particularly embarrassing.  I miss Shula, Marino, the Marks brothers, and Jim Jensen.  At least in the late 80s, they had an exciting air attack but no defense and running game to give us hope.  How can they be so bad this year with Ricky Williams and a solid D?  Shame on Spike TV... er, the Dolphins...

       Ads for the  Dumb and Dumberer  DVD have been running seemingly non-stop on tv lately.  In it, one of the characters says "I like it a lot," a reference to  Forrest Gump .  Now  Forrest Gump  came out in 1994.  So did  Dumb and Dumber .  And  Dumb and Dumberer  is a prequel, supposedly taking place several years before the original.  Which leads me to my question... why does this bother me enough to write a post about it?

       About 10 minutes ago MTV ran a promo for TRL with guest Kelly Clarkson, who said "actually" 4 times in 1 sentence.  Actually, Kelly, your music sucks, and actually, from what I could tell from the ads for your movie, your acting actually sucks too.  And it's about time you removed the nuts you've been storing in your cheeks for winter... it's not a good look.

       Time for Fun With Links... just a couple of good sites I've discovered over the past few days...  1) This  urlLink Yatta  video is so random and hilarious, it just has to be seen by everyone.  Makes me wish I lived in Japan. It's almost better without any explaination, but in case you really need one, check  urlLink here .  2) I blatently stole  urlLink this  from USA Today's Hip Clicks, but really, who cares.  These album covers seem straight out of a Christopher Guest mockumentary.  While we're on the subject of music, yes, "Last Stop: This Town" is the title of an Eels song from their album Electro-Shock Blues.  A friend from Scotland put it on my most recent birthday mix CD, a great (and cheap) gift tradition that more people should start doing.  I'm not really a big Eels fan, and E-SB is the only album of theirs I own, but it's a good song and a good album, and I wasn't prepared when the site suddenly asked me for a title for this blog.  I'm sure lots of other songs would've worked better.  Maybe even "Novocaine for the Soul," another Eels song.  I'll probably change it at some point... but then I'll have to change or delete this post... so I guess it'll just have to stay the same.  Who knows.  Who cares.  Whatever.  One more Eels note... they are playing at Warsaw in Brooklyn tomorrow.  Great venue... I saw Joan Jett there recently.  And I hear they put on an incredible live show.  Sadly I can't go, or I'd review it on Monday.  I'm sure you're all crushed.  P.S.  It's fun addressing readers that I'm sure don't exist...

       The MTA sucks.  I know that actually it doesn't suck, and that without subways I'd be even more bitter than I am now, but really... is there anything more frustrating than waiting for hours for a subway to come, and when one finally picks you up, it slows down or stops between stations even though you know that there can't be a train for miles ahead?  What's the deal, MTA?  Just the waiting for trains is usually bad enough.  I'll probably take some heat from Brooklynites, and I know I'm a Manhattan snob, but getting from Brooklyn to Manhattan late at night is one of the worst experiences in the entire city.  Last night I went into the NRW station at Prospect Ave. at around 1:30am to head back to Manhattan.  Was the only person in the station.  Put Def Leppard " urlLink Vault " (Greatest Hits, for the ignorant) on the iPod to keep me occupied.  Rocked out to "Pour Some Sugar on Me" - no train.  "Photograph" - no train.  "Love Bites" - no train.  "Let's Get Rocked" - no train.  "Two Steps Behind" - no train.  "Animal" - no train.  Finally, a train pulled up during "Foolin'."  Now come on, how can they justify such infrequent service?  Do they only run 1 of each train at night?  I'm just glad I had Def Leppard with me... if anyone can honestly listen to Def Leppard and not like them, even just as a guilty pleasure, they don't deserve ears to listen to music.  Or a tongue to spew their idiotic opinions.  Or even a life, cause they're just wasting food and air and everything else that should be used by Def Leppard fans.  I don't know how this turned from an anti-MTA post to a pro-Def Leppard post.  But get used to reading about Lep, readers... you'll be seeing a lot of them, along with The Simpsons, which is probably the only show that could get away with dissing Def Leppard not once, but twice (DL memorabilia as crappy prizes for Skee-ball and Ring Toss).

       Time to talk about porn.  Specifically, Mary Carey (of Porn Star for Governor fame).  Seems she will be co-hosting a  urlLink new reality show , "Can YOU Be a Pornstar?"  First of all, I went to high school with Mary Carey.  She rode my bus.  She was no porn star back then.  In fact, the total opposite.  She was very innocent and sweet.  Totally annoying, but sweet.  Big doe eyes.  Huge smile.  Stick figure.  I nicknamed her Fievel because she reminded me of the mouse from "An American Tail."  Took ballet.    These days, her big doe eyes are no match for her big doughey boobs.  Her huge smile reveals the pleasure of having the biggest dildo I've ever seen rammed into every orifice.  And the ballet thing is now funny thanks to a yearbook photo of her doing a standing split, holding one foot high over her head, with the caption "Mary demonstrates vertical lineage (and her trademark smile) as ____ observes carefully."  By the way, I don't know the _____ standing next to her, but she looks even more innocent than Mary did... I wonder if she's in therapy these days.  Or doing films with Mary.  I wouldn't know, since I don't watch them... cough cough...  My high school has produced a few fairly famous people.  Billionaire former owner of Blockbuster Video and the Florida Marlins Wayne Huizenga, Emmy winner and former addict Kelsey Grammer, Tony winner Jayne Atkinson, the kid who played Weasel (the replacement Screech) on "Saved By the Bell: The New Class" until he got booted off after one season so that original Screech could return, and, of course, yours truly... cough cough... but now Mary Carey has exceeded them all.  And how has this well-established, respected private school responded?  Basically,  urlLink it disowned her .  For shame, I say.  Embrace Mary Carey.  If given the opportunity, I sure would.

       Okay, people are now  urlLink living their lives  by ripping off   urlLink The Simpsons  ... and I thought I was obsessed...  I finally got through all of the  I Love the 80s Strikes Back  I had saved on my DVR... they really dropped the ball on a lot of things.  They failed to mention:  My Two Dads  - The debut of Giovanni Ribisi, the appearance of The Monkees' Davy Jones (singing the awful song "Oh Nicole"), and the stellar acting of former football player Dick Butkus.  Charles in Charge  - The original family the Pembrokes. Bo Jackson - His unstoppable character on Nintendo's Techmo Super Bowl.  Growing Pains  - The appearances of before-they-were-stars Leonardo DiCaprio, Matthew Perry, and Brad Pitt (who made 2 non-consecutive appearances as different characters). Sloppy, to say the least.  Hope everyone enjoys their New Year festivities... I'll be back in 2004!

       Back at work after a nice 5-day layoff... hope everyone enjoyed the holidays.   "There was doo doo - feces - thrown all over the walls, the floor, the ceiling." Michael Jackson, describing the men's room he says police locked him in  I didn't actually watch the  60 Minutes   urlLink interview  last night, but this quote kills me.  How old is he?  Like 45?  And he still says "doo doo?"  If he ever wants to plead insanity, all his lawyers would have to do is show this clip from the interview, and he'd be off the hook.  Speaking of doo doo, have you heard the novelty song "I Farted on Santa's Lap?"  One of the worst novelty Christmas songs ever.  Makes me long for the days of "Jingle Bells" by the barking dogs.  Oh, and am I the only one who's depressed that it'll be at least 11 months until I hear "Do They Know It's Christmas" on the radio again?  So freakin' catchy...  Saw  Big Fish  and  Cold Mountain  and ate at Ollie's for Jewish Christmas... all 3 were good but somewhat of a disappointment.  My expectations are always too high.  And Ollie's has the strangest system for their waiting list.  They give out numbers, but they distribute them all out of order.  My friend and I were 100... before me was 58, then 76, 81, 27... to ensure that this system works, they must be much smarter than me, or much much dumber.

       Made a mix for my friend Tommy... the following is a track list, with selected liner notes:  1) “Happy Together” – The Turtles: Tommy and I have had conversations about the greatest pop song.  He says it’s “California Dreamin’,” I say it’s this.  Such a simple concept, simple structure, simple lyrics, but the chorus explodes, and I catch deeper layers of instrumentation with each listen.  Plus, it just makes me smile. 2) “You Don’t Have To Mean It” – The Rolling Stones: I may be crazy, since my favorite Stones song is from the 90s and sung by Keith Richards.  This also sounds nothing like typical Stones.  But I love the calypso feel of it, and Keith’s voice sounds surprisingly sweet; Mick couldn’t pull off a song like this. 3) “Down the Road” – Mickey Hart 4) “Life on Mars” – David Bowie 5) “Tears in the Morning – The Beach Boys 6) “Eli’s Coming” – Three Dog Night 7) “Can’t Cry These Tears” – Garbage 8) “Something About You” – Level 42 9) “At My Most Beautiful” – REM: Another dulcet love song with great harmonies and orchestration.  It’s like Michael Stipe’s best attempt to mirror the music of Pet Sounds.  And he came close. 10) “Father & Son” – Cat Stevens: This song constantly sits in the shadow of “Cat’s in the Cradle,” but I think it’s far superior.  The last verse is heartbreaking, with the son singing about leaving as the father cries out “Stay” in the background. 11) “Impossible” – Charlatans UK 12) “Please Please Let Me Get What I Want (Instrumental)” – Dream Academy: For the longest time, I didn’t know this song had lyrics.  Then I didn’t know it was a cover.  Having learned all of this, I still think this is the best version.  It manages to convey all the necessary emotion without words.  Or maybe I just keep picturing Cameron in the Art Institute of Chicago.  Either way… 13) “Time” – Pink Floyd: Am I too young for these words to have such a strong effect on me?  Probably… damn this Peter Pan syndrome! 14) “Don’t Change Your Plans” – Ben Folds Five 15) “Wonderful” – Stone Temple Pilots: Although they started out as rockers, STP was great at writing ballads.  I love the line “You’re the wonder in everything that’s wonderful.”   16) “Obsession” – Animotion 17) “Labour of Love” – Frente 18) “My Way” – Elvis Presley: Beyond the pelvis, the acting, the army, the “fat vs. thin” argument… Elvis simply had the best male voice in rock history.  This cover proves it. 19) “Money” – Zebrahead: Zebrahead is not a great band by any stretch of the imagination, but they write catchy songs with clever lyrics and don’t take themselves too seriously.  Additional points for the GnR reference at the end.

       Last night I watched the DVD of Roger Waters performing "The Wall" live in Berlin in 1990, 8 months after the fall of the Berlin Wall.  The sheer size and spectacle of the show boggles the mind.  I think it was 400,000 people in the audience, a cast of hundreds, a symphony conducted by  urlLink Michael Kamen  (who also led for Metallica's "S&M" shows), and guest appearances by Cyndi Lauper ("Another Brick in the Wall, Part 2"), Bryan Adams ("Young Lust"), Joni Mitchell ("Goodbye Blue Sky"), Paul Carrack ("Hey You"), Van Morrison ("Comfortably Numb"), Sinead O'Conner ("Mother"), and appearances by The Band, The Scorpions, Albert Finney, Jerry Hall, Thomas Dolby, Marianne Faithful, Tim Curry, and some others I'm sure I'm forgetting.  The show included the construction of a wall that I think they said was 35x100 meters, although the staging was somewhat bizarre... almost half an hour of the concert took place behind the fully-constructed wall, and though cameras were behind it to show the band on the DVD, I'm sure it pissed the hell out of the live audience.  The documentary was amusing too, as Roger and company talked about how the power cut out twice during "Mother," causing Sinead to panic (I noticed that while watching the show... she looks totally uncomfortable when she's singing), and they rip on her for her lack of professionalism.  Check it out if you're a big Floyd fan, although it certainly doesn't compare to listening to the original CD.

       I've done it!  One of the greatest upsets in the history of fantasy football!  My mediocre 9-5 Brian GrieseMonkeys ripped the heart out of the mighty 12-2 Charlie Batchelors to win the Super Bowl in my fantasy football league.  The game was a blowout of epic proportions.  This not only makes up for his regular-season sweep against me, but also eases the pain of his cruising through my fantasy baseball league earlier this year.  His evil reign of terror is over!  Happy Hanukkah indeed!  I spent yesterday evening at a sports bar with the Batchelors coach and another guy from our league.  I was the first to get there, and arrived just in time to hear the cheers erupting from inside in response to the Saints' improbably triple-lateral TD with time expired.  A crazier play, I've never seen.  And yet as John Carney, one of the most dependable kickers of my generation, shanked the extra point, I couldn't help but smile.  I love seeing emotions turn on a dime like that.  Which is probably why I'll be going to Hell.  I'm sure Carney will be there waiting for me... he's a dead man if he ever sets foot in New Orleans again.  Steve Barman who?  (Oh, and anyone who would  urlLink pay $106,000  for that ball is insane... INSANE!)

       From IMDB.com today:   Jessica Simpson & Nick Lachey Plan Duets Album  Celebrity couple Jessica Simpson and Nick Lachey are planning to record a duets album next year. But Irresistible singer Jessica - who stars alongside her husband in TV hit Newlyweds: Nick And Jessica - is keen to avoid a "cheesy" album. She says, "We're talking about remaking great seventies, eighties hits. Definitely a romantic album. We wouldn't want it to be cheesy. So we'd have to spend a while and pick the right material. We're not going to do 'I Got You Babe,' because that's what people's 'clever ideas' are. 'Oh, you should do Sonny And Cher.' We're just like, 'No, if we're going to do something together, it has to be clever.' We want to remake some stuff and also do original stuff."  In related news, with 12 days left in 2003, "Last Stop: This Town" boldly names Nick & Jessica's classic CD of duets the Worst Album of 2004.

       My time at my job is running short... only 4 more working days.  I should make a list of all the things I will miss about it.  But instead, I think I'll list all the things that bother me about it... so here goes... 1) Working in Times Square.  Tourists coming to Manhattan (and especially into Times Square) should be tutored on how to walk.  Simple rules such as: walk quickly; at crosswalks, all signals mean "go;" if in a group, walk single file instead of side-by-side so you don't take up the entire sidewalk; stay the hell out of my way. 2) The girls in my pit.  You have to be here to understand. 3) That Gamecube commercial with the guy dressed as Link from "Zelda" standing on the sidewalk and screaming.  It's awful the first time... when MTV plays it during EVERY COMMERCIAL BREAK, I feel like starting a conversation with my pitmates just to distract me from it. 4) The fact that I can't wear my  urlLink Skidz  to work without being the subject of ridicule. 5) The crappy music.  People may complain that MTV never shows videos anymore, but those people don't hear Clay Aiken's "Invisible" 8 times before noon.  Personally, I'd rather he be mute than invisible. I'm gonna miss this place... sigh...  The Olsen twins are  urlLink going to NYU ... let my stalking begin...

       I'll start off with my thoughts on the  urlLink 2004 Golden Globe nominations .  I haven't seen a bunch of major movies yet ( Cold Mountain , the new  Lord of the Rings ,  Big Fish ,  Last Samurai ), so I can't give completely educated responses.  However... -  21 Grams  should've been nominated for Best Drama, and Benicio Del Toro, who is sooooooooo good in it, should've gotten a Supporting Actor nod. - Jeff Bridges was more deserving of a nomination in  Seabiscuit  than William H. Macy. - I'm fairly sure  City of God  is eligible in all categories other than Best Foreign Film (I know it is for the Oscars), so it should've gotten a nom for Best Picture. - Maria Bello was okay in  The Cooler , but certainly not as good as Alison Lohman in  Matchstick Men .  Impossible to believe that she's actually 24 years old! - On that note, why do the women only get 5 Supporting Actress in a Film nominations while the men get 6?  With the extra slot, Lohman could've gotten in, or Catherine O'Hara from  A Mighty Wind .  Eugene Levy should've gotten one for that movie too. - Hurray for Best TV Comedy nominations for  The Office  and  Arrested Development !  I'll be so excited if either of them win, but I'm rooting for  The Office .   - What is everyone's continuing obsession with Megan Mullally and (particularly) Sean Hayes from Will  & Grace ?  They are two of the most annoying characters on tv! I'll give better predictions / opinions on the eve of the awards.  Looking for a diet that's sure to work?  Check out  urlLink this site ... you may never eat fast food again!  Finally, I'm really pissed I didn't go to David Bowie's concert at MSG Monday night.  The Times, Post, Daily News, and Daily Variety all raved about it.  At least I can say I didn't provide any money to Macy "No Talent Crack-Fiend" Gray.  Regardless, I'm glad Bowie is still doing so well, and hopefully I'll catch him the next time he comes around.

        Update : Believe it or not, UPS still sucks.  My package was not delivered to my office yesterday.  Nor was it delivered to my apartment.  I tracked the shipment this morning, and it said a delivery attempt was made yesterday.  Odd, since our mailroom is open all day.  So I check the delivery address to make sure they changed it.  Not only is my work address not there, but now they have my incorrect home address!  I have just called them to again give my work address.  New delivery date: Thursday (tomorrow).  Will it be here tomorrow?  I'd be tempted to put more money on  urlLink  From Justin To Kelly   sweeping the Oscars.  Well, maybe not.  Speaking of bad movies, I saw a doozy last night.  A sneak preview of  The Prince and Me , starring Julia Stiles.  In this unique tale, a prince travels to the "heartland of America" to experience real life and meets a girl who doesn't know he's a prince.  They fall in love, but when she finds out the truth... there's trouble!  Oh man, does this movie blow.  Blow blow blow!  They should've made it  The Artist Formerly Known as Prince and Me , about a midget named Prince who dresses in purple.  He goes to the "heartland of America" but changes his name to a symbol so people don't know who he is.  He falls in love with a girl, but when she finds out the truth... there's trouble!  Now that's a movie.

       Time once again for our favorite game: Why UPS Sucks My Ass (And Not In a Good Way).  I received an Info Notice yesterday.  Having learned a thing or two from the past incident (or so I thought), I called to immediately change the delivery address, since I will be at work each time UPS tries to deliver the package.  An automated message says that you can do that online rather than hold for an operator.  Trusting UPS, I go to their website and enter the tracking number... and get an error message stating they have no info on that package.  So I call UPS back, enter my info number, and wait for an operator, only to have him tell me he has no info on that tracking number.  We attempt to search using an alternate approach.  By last name, I'm sure you're thinking.  Nope, they can't search by last name... they search by address.  Fair enough.  I give them my address... no info.  The operator says that he will leave a message telling the deliveryman to change the address to my office.  Where exactly he will leave this message, since apparently my package is a ghost in the system, I do not know.  But I can almost guarantee another Info Notice waiting for me when I go home tonight.  I finally started watching all of the  urlLink  I Love the 80s Strikes Back   that have been sitting in my  urlLink DVR  (one of the greatest inventions of my lifetime).  This series is not nearly as good as the original, with the exception of Henry Rollins.  VH1 (or some other channel) should give him his own series in which they just let him talk about stuff.  He's hilarious!  On Gloworms: "I don't care about them unless they dispense $100 bills."  On the song "Don't Worry, Be Happy": "Don't you tell me what to do... I'll punch you in the fucking face!"   urlLink Tommy  actually e-mails with him.  If I had access to Henry Rollins, I would talk to him non-stop.  He rules.

       Another Sunday night, another terrible episode of The Simpsons.  Parody of the  urlLink California Raisins ?  What year is this?  If yesterday were 1988, that may have been funny... but I doubt it.  My obligation to keep watching this crap is shrinking every episode...  Saw  The Two Towers: Extended Edition  at Loews 42nd St. on Friday night.  It is long.  Very long.  But good.  And long.  Michael Moore sat 6 seats down from me.  I purposely stepped on his foot on my way out.  Take that, ya fat fuck!  (Amazingly, I liked  Bowling for Columbine , and bought a "Stupid White Men" boxed calendar... after almost a year of his daily blabbering, I can't stand the man... funny how my mind works)

       Another fascinating  urlLink music link .  I'd love to get my hands on the Joe Pesci song.  And the 49ers singing "Winter Wonderland."  I remember enjoying "The Superbowl Shuffle" song and video when they first came out.  Having seen the video recently, I can now say that it is one of the worst things ever created by man.  Watching the Bears dance is painful.  The steps were as follows: 1) Lean on left foot 2) Clap 3) Lean on right foot 4) Clap 5) Repeat And they couldn't get that right.  Also, apparently Walter Payton and Jim McMahon were too high and mighty to appear with their teammates, as their scenes were done in front of the worst blue-screen since the scene with the Firey puppets in  Labyrinth .  Although it did lead to one of the funniest skits in  Saturday Night Live  history: the foreign NFL players singing "We Are Kickers" ("we are kickers, we kick ball, we play with ball, we kick the ball").  MTV holiday party tonight.  Hopefully I'll have some good gossip to spill tomorrow.

       Does  urlLink this  make me laugh or make me sick?  I can't tell yet.  But it does make me yearn for "Chinese Democracy."  I really shouldn't be a GnR fan anymore, given the  urlLink shit they put me through  when I went to see them in Philly just over a year ago.  But I can't stay mad at Axl, as long as he can still do the snake dance.  (by the way, does anyone else think he sounds uncannily like Janis Joplin at the end of "My Michelle"?)   Big Fish  opens in NY today.  I have such high expectations for it, but  urlLink reviews  have been mixed so far.  Tim Burton was once my favorite director of all time...  Pee-Wee's Big Adventure ,  Beetlejuice ,  Batman ,  Edward Scissorhands ,  Batman Returns ... what an incredible string of films.  I have seen  Beetlejuice  more than any other film; I remember one Christmas break during elementary school when I watched it every day for 2 weeks straight.  I have chilled a bit on his more recent output, such as  Mars Attacks ,  Planet of the Apes , and  Sleepy Hollow , but I hope that he returns to form now.  So many buzzworthy films have disappointed me lately; it'd be nice to actually enjoy  Big Fish  as much as I'm expecting to.

       So people in Jersey are  urlLink hunting bears ?  Personally, I'm with the protestors on this one... leave the bears alone.  There's no need to shoot them.  Maybe they could just create a Bear Patrol... or at least watch that episode of  The Simpsons  this great exchange:          [A full-force Bear Patrol is on watch.  Homer watches proudly]  Homer : Not a bear in sight.  The Bear Patrol must be working like a charm.  Lisa : That's specious reasoning, Dad.  Homer : Thank you, dear.  Lisa : By your logic I could claim that this rock keeps tigers away.  Homer : How does it work?  Lisa : It doesn't work.  Homer : Uh-huh.  Lisa : It's just a stupid rock.  Homer : Uh-huh.  Lisa : But I don't see any tigers around, do you?         [Homer thinks of this, then pulls out some money]  Homer : Lisa, I want to buy your rock.         [Lisa refuses at first, then takes the exchange]         [The mail arrives]  Homer : Woo-hoo!  A perfect day.  Zero bears and one big fat hairy paycheck.         [opens it up]  Homer : Hey!  How come my pay is so low? ... Bear patrol tax!  This is an outrage!  It's the biggest tax increase in history!  Lisa : Actually, Dad, it's the smallest tax increase in history.  Homer : Let the bears pay the bear tax.  I pay the Homer tax.  Lisa : That's home-owner tax.  Homer : Well, anyway, I'm still outraged.  Classic!

       Apparently today would have been Jim Morrison's 60th birthday.  I'm not that big a fan of the Doors, but they have grown on me over the years.  And I love the fact that Mr. Mojo Risin' is an anagram for Jim Morrison.  That's genius.  It's also hilarious to listen to Ray Manzarek give an interview.  He mentions Jim Morrison about every 7 or 8 words.  I noticed this when he was on  urlLink Rockline  last April, and it cracks me up.  (Note - this is not an endorsement of Rockline... in fact, quite the opposite.  Bob Coburn may be the most pretentious suck-ass to ever have a nationally syndicated radio show.  He's like the radio equivalent to James Lipton.  What a dick.)  My favorite show currently on tv (now that  The Office  is out of new episodes) is  urlLink Arrested Development .  If you are not watching this show, WATCH IT OR I WILL HUNT YOU DOWN!  The writing, pacing, and acting are all so sharp.  It hasn't been doing very well ratings-wise, but Fox renewed it for a full season anyway based on the critical acclaim.  Fortunately, the ratings have been slowly creeping up, so I hope that means it's starting to catch on.  Otherwise it'll turn into another great show cancelled before its time (see  Freaks and Geeks ,  Undeclared ,  The Job , and  Andy Richter Controls the Universe ).

       Went to see  urlLink Simon and Garfunkel  at the Garden last night.  The show had gotten almost universally good reviews until the Times  urlLink panned Tuesday's show , so I wasn't sure what to expect.  Thankfully, they must have stepped it up a notch for their last NYC show, because they sounded great.  Especially Garfunkel; his voice is outstanding and still easily reaches the high notes.  It's a good thing that God gave him such a voice, because otherwise he is one of the gawkiest men to ever exist.  He wore his trademark blue jeans, blue denim shirt, and black vest, which I believe he has been donning for at least 20 years.  But it works, because the vest mirrors his hairstyle: lots in the back, some on the sides, nothing up front (I wonder what he even says to his barber when he goes for a haircut... what could he possibly say to lead to that  urlLink style ?).  The chemistry wasn't great... Simon almost never looked in Garfunkel's direction, and at times you could almost see the loathing emanate from him.  But luckily it didn't affect the sound.  And the brief 4-song appearance by the Everly Brothers was fantastic too, but I wish they had played "Cathy's Clown," especially since S&G had their own Kathy for a muse.  Before the show I made the mistake of going to Popeyes for dinner.  Popeyes must be a magnet for retards (excluding myself, of course).  The woman in front of me ordered the 2-piece meal.  She asks for a breast & thigh.  The cashier explains that one can only get a breast & wing or thigh and leg.  Customer says, "Oh, okay, then I'll have it with a breast & thigh."  Cashier once again explains that she cannot have that particular combination.  A second cashier comes over and says it can only be either all white meat or all dark meat.  The customer says, "Yeah, so gimme a breast and a thigh."  JESUS CHRIST!  Also of note, Popeyes' paper placemats have a description of their rice which reads "Of course Popeyes serves this!  It's also known as 'dirty rice.'"  For a restaurant chain whose sanitary conditions are poor at best, they should not be bragging about the fact that one of their side dishes is known as "dirty."  As for the  urlLink Yankees acquiring Vacquez  from the Expos, I'm excited to add him to the pitching staff, but am greatly disappointed that they cut the chord on Nick Johnson.  I could see him moving up the chain to become a franchise Yankee, much like Jeter or Bernie, but the Yankees have no patience for player maturity anymore.  And who will back up Gimpy Giambi at first when his knees flair up?  I would have rather traded Giambi to the Dodgers for Kevin Brown, or putting Soriano in the Vazquez deal.  At least I think that Johnson will produce bigtime in the middle of the Expos line-up.  I hope he does.  Let's end on a positive note... this  urlLink link  is really funny... and borderline racist, which makes it that much better...

       Freakin' cold outside today...  There's this new website,  urlLink WantedList , that is an online adult DVD rental company.  It plans to model itself after  urlLink Netflix , which I have been a proud member of for over 2 years.  Netflix has been hugely successful, and I figure that WantedList will be, too.  You make a list of porno movies you'd like to rent, pay like $15 a month, they send you 2 movies on your list, you watch them, and when you're done with one, send it back in the prepaid envelope, and they will send you another movie.  (there is an additional step that takes place during the "watch" portion for the WantedList films, but I have excluded it)  I'm sure that the biggest hindrance in the porn rental industry is the embarrassment factor.  Take that away by making it anonymous, and WantedList should follow Netflix all the way to the bank.  It may even be more profitable, given the money it'll save without the need for adhesive on the envelopes...

       I'm feeling very old today... went to see  urlLink Zebrahead  at the Knitting Factory last night, and was almost definitely the oldest person in the crowd (so many 17-year-old hoochies).  Plus my left ear hasn't popped yet from my flight on Sunday night, so there is a constant ringing in it.  I guess life does go downhill after 23...  As for the Zebrahead concert, I feel bad that, even though they never really reached a point they could call "success," they seem to be losing fans instead of gaining them.  I first saw them 4 years ago, and they played to at least 1,000 people.  Last night there were around 150, maybe 200.  Definitely more people showed up to hear Lucky Boys Confusion, the opening act.  Zebrahead isn't a polished band of quality musicians, but they write catchy songs with clever lyrics and have fun onstage.  I hope they do manage to break through at some point.  If Good Charlotte, Simple Plan, New Found Glory, etc. all can make it, then Zebrahead certainly should too, since they put those other bands to shame.  Since I'm on the topic of music, I should post my reaction to the full Rolling Stone Top 500 Albums issue... I know I touched on this briefly, but there is much more to be said.  Too much to deal with right now, in fact.  But I'll get to it in the next few days...

       Back in action after a few days in Florida for Thanksgiving.  To catch up, I've decided to steal a page out of TV Guide and do a Cheers & Jeers section.  Here goes...   Jeers  to airline travel.  Tuesday night I get to LaGuardia for a 7:45pm flight on American down to Ft. Lauderdale.  But apparently the plane coming in from Nashville had to circle because of "air traffic" and ran out of gas, causing it to land at Kennedy to refuel.  It then couldn't take off because of more "air traffic," and when it finally did, it couldn't land because another flight had taken over our gate.  We ended up being 2 1/2 hours late.  "Air traffic" is the biggest crock of shit.  Flights are scheduled so that each one has a specific slot.  How ATC can suddenly be overwhelmed with traffic is beyond comprehension.  And the fact that the plane from Nashville was given just enough fuel to cover the short trip to New York (and none extra) is not too comforting.  Way to start my vacation off poorly.   Cheers  to my grandmother for telling a story and using the phrase "shot his wad," then realizing the inappropriateness of it and trying to correct herself by saying "shot his load," as if that's any better.  Sometimes my grandma can make me laugh harder than anyone.  That was one of those times.   Jeers  to my grandmother for freaking out when a waitress brought her a refill on her Diet Coke without asking first.  "What's this?  I didn't order this!" she shrieked.  Why do senior citizens become so ornery?     Cheers  to two of my friends who freaked out that they are now too old to attend a live taping of  urlLink TRL .  At 25 and 26, they are just past the 18-24 cutoff.  But I'm glad that they enjoy MTV so much as to care.  Plus it lets me make fun of them for being old.   Jeers  to the Red Sox for  urlLink landing Curt Schilling .  And to the Diamondbacks for asking for two of the Yankees' best young players (Johnson and Soriano) and taking scrubs from the Sox (Fossum and Lyon).  Schilling now joins my list of "Do Not Draft" players for next year's fantasy league.  I still don't think the Sox will win the Series anytime in the near future, though.   Cheers  to Schilling's quote - "I guess I hate the Yankees now."  That's some strong, energetic emotion he's got going.  Way to motivate yourself.   Jeers  to Song airline.  This is the second time I've flown them, and the second time I've been disappointed.  They're never on-time, their seats are ugly (lime green leather?), and although they've been operating for months, they have yet to install the music players into their planes from which they got the name "Song."  Oh, and it was great having the stewardess give the following speech to me and my fellow exit-row passengers: "Since y'all are in an exit row, I need to go over something with you.  I need to make sure you follow procedure correctly.  We did have an emergency recently, and someone in charge of the door simply jumped out the window.  Please make sure you follow the correct procedure."  (At this point, somebody starts laughing)  "You think it's funny, but it's not.  What y'all need to do is... ah, whatever."  (She walks away without detailing the correct procedure)  I don't know which is worse... the fact that she didn't tell us what to do, or the fact that Song has had an emergency that utilized the emergency exits recently.  Way to end my vacation poorly.  All in all, it was good to get out of Manhattan for a few days and spend time with the family.  And I can't believe it's already December.  Where has this year gone?

       Why are these conversations so typical? Chinese Restaurant: Hello? Me: I’d like to place an order for delivery. CR: Phone number? Me: 496-8640. CR: 496… Me: 8640. CR: 946… Me: No, 496… CR: 212-496… Me: 8640. CR: … Me: 496-8640. CR: 212-496… Me: 8640. CR: 8640. Me: Right. CR: (sounding annoyed) What you want?

       I watched the  Bands Reunited  episode featuring Klymaxx... damn, those girls got big!  They should rename the band Thigh-Maxx! (ba dum dum)  Tommy and I have agreed to make mix CDs for each other, only using songs that are Track 5's (studio album and original soundtracks only; no greatest hits or compilations).  There's a lot of pressure.  Tommy's CD collection is probably 5 times bigger than mine, at least, and I'm pretty sure that he owns 90% of what I do, which means that songs that I put on his either will also be on the one that he gives me or will be songs that he rejected.  I've had to eliminate some classic track 5's just because they are too obvious ("Pour Some Sugar On Me," "Mr. Brownstone," "Misty Mountain Hop"), but I hope that my search for randomness doesn't sink the entire project.  I am looking forward to getting his, however...  Brian's Super Bowl pick: Carolina 17, New England 13.   MVP: Stephen Davis

       Well, the readers (er, reader) have spoken, and they want the blog to stay.  Who am I to disappoint my fans (er, fan)?  After thinking I would hate it, I admit that I like the show  urlLink Bands Reunited .  My favorite part, by far, is when the former stars discuss their current jobs.  They all have TERRIBLE jobs!  Stuff like Illustrator for Aviation Safety Handbooks.  You can tell they are embarrassed by it, because they try to boost their image by making their title longer than a Fiona Apple album title: "Yes, I'm in charge of quality control of plastics and plastic-type substances for use in importing and exporting circumstances."  The best is when VH1 totally busts them on it... the person will say "I'm the Manager of Loss & Theft Prevention," and at the bottom of the screen the chyron (sorry for the technical term) will read "Security Guard."  On rare occasions they'll cut people some slack, usually when they talk about how they still play random gigs and the chyron will say "Freelance Musician" instead of the more obvious "Unemployed."  But for the most part, their cover is blown.  The show itself is good, although I wish Aamer was less of an egomaniac in taking credit for everything (he's fine conducting interviews, however), and the performances are wildly inconsistent, if they happen at all (what the hell, Holly from Frankie Goes to Hollywood?), but that's part of the fun.  If you haven't checked it out yet, give it a shot.

       I will officially never get any work done ever again because of  urlLink this ...  So the snow hit... doesn't really seem like such a big deal.  I actually love snow: the city looks so cool covered in white; you can use it as an excuse to come to work late or blow people off completely; it keeps the pigeons away from my window... plus my roommate HATES snow (and cold weather in general), so I get to annoy him with my snow chant: Snow rules Yeah snow I love snow Yeah! I never would've thought that 8 simple words could get him worked up, but they do, and I love it.  Lindsay(ism) wants me to post on how much I miss having her around, and since it's a slow news day, I'll appease her: "Lindsay(ism), I miss you!  Life is soooooooooooooooo boring without you here... I've resorted to playing penguin baseball for hours on end!  I'm spiraling out of control... help me before I sink any lower!  Only your presence in the writers' pit will cheer me up.  Please come back!" How's that?  Out of curiosity, I just clicked on a random blog listed under the Most Recently Published section of Blogger and came upon  urlLink this ... and now I think I might have to officially take my blog down.  No, not because I can't compete (although Marion's blog contains the line "I Am Funny," while mine makes no such claim... if you were a blog browser, which one would you read?), but because I hope my blog doesn't come off like this to people who don't know me.  There is probably a reason why people have minds for internal thoughts and the ability to filter out what people want to hear before you say stuff.  Has this blog destroyed my filter?  I'm gonna have to think about this... Oh, and that Helen girl sounds like a tool.

        urlLink Oscar nominations  out today, and for the most part, I think they did a damn fine job...  City of God  for Best Director (and 3 others) is HUGE... gotta like  Cold Mountain  getting snubbed... Benicio and Naomi got bids for  21 Grams ... "A Kiss at the End of the Rainbow" for Best Song... Johnny Depp and Bill Murray both got in... I wouldn't disagree with anything, except maybe for the snub of Jennifer Connelly (girl from Whale  Rider ?  Really?), and it would've been cool for Tim Burton to get nominated, but that's a tough category... so I won't complain.  Also note my Dec. 18 post when the Globe noms came out to see how on the ball I was... not to toot my own horn...  At the other end of the spectrum, nominations for the  urlLink Razzies  came out yesterday, and I think they're way off.   Charlie's Angels 2  was bad, but worse than  Boat Trip ?  Or  Kangaroo Jack ?  Please.  No wonder nobody ever goes to the ceremony.  I don't even know where to begin with Aaron Boone's  urlLink injury .  But it's not good.  Although maybe the Yanks can go after A-rod now... I did like the NY Times report describing Yankee contracts, which ban players from playing billiards, bowling, shuffleboard, and anything else you can imagine.  Perhaps if all that extranious crap hadn't been in there, Boone would've paid closer attention to the basketball ban.

       I've stolen a page from  urlLink Bill Simmons  and wrote a Golden Globes diary... here goes:  8:00 – Starting off the show with a Golden Globes version of “Hey Ya.”  Does anybody like these things?  And what happens if somebody in the lyrics is a no-show?  It’d be cool to see random stock footage of Jennifer Aniston pre-nose job. 8:01 – Nicole is wearing a dress similar to J-Lo’s infamous green Oscar dress with the plunging neckline… except that Nicole’s has fabric over her torso.  Is she hiding chest acne?  Come on Nicole, grow some balls! 8:02 – Tom Cruise has been on camera twice, and both times he’s done that Tom Cruise full-teeth laugh.  Can he do anything else?   8:04 – Tim Robbins wins Supporting Actor… already I’m 0-for-1 in predictions.  I’m sure everyone is nervous his speech will be political.  He likes the fact that he won so that he can start drinking, but the way he’s slurring his words it sounds like he started, oh, maybe Friday morning?  He sure has come a long way from  Howard the Duck . 8:07 – Anthony LaPaglia just thanked Jerry Bruckheimer.  Nobody should be allowed to thank him for anything… unless it’s to thank him for traveling back in time a-la  Butterfly Effect  and eliminating his entire cinematic output since 1997 (except for  Black Hawk Down ). 8:09 – Looks like the  6 Feet Under  table got stuck 6 miles from the stage.  Way for the networks to stick it to HBO. 8:12 – Renee Zellweger is crying.  This is her third victory here, and it’s a Golden Globe.  Get a grip.  Maybe she’s crying because she got punched in the face… oh no, wait, that’s just how she looks.  Is it good or bad when a winner says she doesn’t want to forget anyone, takes out a list, then reads your name?  Should you be happy she mentioned you or pissed off that she basically did forget you?   8:18 – Dick Clark is sitting at the  Will & Grace  table looking flustered and asks “Who am I talking to?”  Methinks it’s time for him to retire. 8:21 – Lily Costner is young and hot… I guess Kevin is now spawning his future girlfriends. 8:24 – Time for Best TV Show, Comedy.  If  The Office  loses, I’m screaming. 8:25 – Yeah  Office !  Who’s the guy in the wheelchair?  They’re gonna have to do something about that microphone if he wants to talk.  I’m making a bold prediction: “We used to run the world before you” is the best line of the night. 8:32 –  Angels in America  just won two awards.  Should they even bother with these categories?  I can’t imagine it will lose to anything.  8:40 – There hasn’t been a single joke in any introduction or nomination list.  This patter sucks.  Who writes these things?  (Yes, I know this is bold to say coming from someone who’s job it is to write “Your #7 request today is_____”)   8:41 – I guess Cate Blanchett got the short straw in “Who has to announce the President of the Hollywood Foreign Press.” 8:43 – Reba?  An acting nomination?  Where the hell am I? 8:48 – “The star and producer of  Butterly Effect , Ashton Kutcher.”  Jesus. 8:50 – Although I’m glad he won, Jeffrey Wright just whipped out “I’ll share this award with you but keep it at my house.”  That and “I don’t have anything prepared because I didn’t think I’d win” should be banned from all award shows.   8:58 – Diane Keaton’s acceptance speech is the worst stage reading since Quentin Tarantino performed on Broadway. 9:00 – Diane says “Shit,” followed by a second of audio dropout.  Bravo, NBC censors. 9:01 – Bill Murray wins in a hugely competitive category, and gives an awesome acceptance speech.  No surprise there. 9:10 – As Molly Sims walks out, cut to Jim Belushi nodding his head in approval.  Yeah, I’m sure the feeling is mutual. 9:13 – Ricky Gervais wins!  An  Office  sweep!  This makes me so happy, until they now fast-track the American version and drive it into the ground like they did to Coupling. 9:21 – Gwen Stefani looks like a blonde Bride of Frankenstein. 9:32 – J-Lo is onstage.  I wonder if the terms of the separation gave her the Golden Globes and Ben the Oscars.  If so, she got hosed. 9:34 – Sofia Coppola isn’t much of a speaker.  She should’ve written her acceptance speech and had Bill Murray read it.  Can’t get enough of that guy. 9:37 – Yes, I (and every straight man in the world) thank Mary Louise Parker’s son too. 9:48 – Clint’s expression when Sharon Stone walked onstage looks like he just popped his first boner in 3 decades. 9:59 – Michael Douglas’s Lifetime Achievement Award took a lifetime to present and accept. 10:08 – Why does Elijah Wood constantly look constipated?  He tries to smile but can’t quite loosen up.  Someone get him a bran muffin. 10:09 – They let Brittany Murphy present? Didn’t anyone watch last year’s Independent Spirit Awards?   10:12 – She can’t pronounce “complex.”  Told you so. 10:22 – What is the Dutchess of Pork doing here?  Must be tough, the life of a Dutchess. 10:24 – Nicole to Clint: “You’re not Sean!”  Thanks for pointing that out.  Clint probably knew he would lose and Sean would win and gave one of Sean’s kids poisoned milk so he could give an acceptance speech anyway. 10:34 – Afghanistan won Best Foreign Film, marking the country’s greatest achievement since they resisted Alexander the Great in 326 BC.  They could melt down the statue and use the gold to feed the entire population for weeks. 10:37 – Charlize wins!  And they’re playing Journey as she heads to the stage!  She’s so hot… my dad and I have been on her bandwagon since we saw  2 Days in the Valley  in theaters in 1996.   10:45 – Wow, Jim Carrey bombed.  And I can think of several better punchlines than Elf… Boat Trip?  Kangaroo Jack? 10:52 – Nice, Leo is presenting.  I’ll have sweet dreams tonight.  Overall the show was pretty tedious and poorly produced... but I actually got 5 out of 10 in my predictions, which much better than usual.  Oscar nominations tomorrow morning...

       Aw yeah,  Freaks & Geeks  is finally  urlLink coming to DVD !    Quick thoughts on who I want to win the major Golden Globes (I'm only doing movies, as I don't watch enough television to be adequately opinionated, except to say that I can't imagine any show should beat  The Office ): Picture, Drama -  Mystic River  Picture, Comedy -  Lost in Translation  Actor, Drama - Sean Penn Actress, Drama - Charlize Theron (where's the nomination for Jennifer Connelly?) Actor, Comedy - Bill Murray (I would love to give it to Johnny Depp, but I just didn't like that movie at all except for him) Actress, Comedy - Scarlett Johansson (albeit that's the only nominee I've seen in this category, but she was damn good) Supporting Actor - Alec Baldwin (toughest category... could easily have given to Ken Watanabe) Supporting Actress - Holly Hunter Director - Peter Weir Screenplay -  Lost in Translation  Usually nothing I want to win ever wins, so hopefully I didn't just jinx everyone...

       Hurray!  The super finally fixed my shower... the hot water has returned!  It only took 5 days for him to come during a stretch where the temperature in the city never rose about freezing.  I was listening to Letters to Cleo last night, and after a decade of frustration and confusion, I finally gave in and looked up the lyrics to "Here and Now."  The chorus sounds like: "The comfort of a knowledge of the wealth above the stars But they'll never simi-nimi-nama timi-nama-nimi-nama  Here and now." Turns out that she actually sings: "The comfort of a knowledge of a rise above the sky above could  never parallel the challenge of an acquisition in the  here and now." You learn something new everyday.

       The pseudo- West Side Story  video for Toto's "Rosanna" was on VH1 Classic earlier today.  I have to wonder, who would win in the battle for Ugliest Band of All-Time: Toto or REO Speedwagon?  Tough call... both so hideous... although neither can hold a candle to  urlLink Debora Iyall  of Romeo Void, who looks like a cross between Roseanne and the World's Fattest Baby (as featured several years ago in  Weekly World News )... the song "Never Say Never" (and life in general) was better before I saw her image singing "I might like you better if we slept together."

       I'm sharing a room with Lindsay Robertson (of  urlLink Lindsayism.com ) for the day.  Talk about pressure.  Will she blog about me?  Do I want her to?  Do I have to be funny all the time in case she does?  And if she doesn't, does that reflect badly on me?  Am I not worthy of Lindsayism?  Oh, the pressure... At least if she does write something mean, I can fire back with an embarrassing Paula Abdul story (is there any other kind of Paula Abdul story?) from Lindsay's past...  Within 10 minutes of her arrival, the four writers in our pit launched into a "You're from Florida?"  "What high school did you go to?"  "You went to Pine Crest?"  "My friend went to St. Andrews!"  "Hey, I went to St. Andrews!" conversation.  Why are these talks so fascinating?  I didn't actually know any of the names mentioned.  Are people realy so insecure and in need of human contact?  Apparently so... I guess that's why Friendster is so popular (and why I have 95 Friendsters but only like 5 actual friends).

       My roommate Dave celebrated a belated Christmas with his dad, stepmom, and stepsister last night.  It had been delayed due to each party's assorted travels during December, then again from its original slot last Sunday night due to a flood in the family's apartment (somehow a sink collapsed... however that happens).  Dave trekked off with presents in tow around 7:30pm.  When he returned at midnight, I asked him what he got.  He told me that his stepsister's gift is "still in the kiln," his mom got him a CD of Tibetan monk chanting (which he assumes she bought for herself and decided she wouldn't like), and his dad "hasn't gotten anything yet."  Can you say WORST CHRISTMAS EVER?!?  The hot water in our shower hasn't been working since Friday.  I've resorted to showering at the gym, which I hate.  There's no comfort zone, and I have to wear flip-flops (after a sarcastic conversation with my roommate in which I tell him that EVERYONE has peed in a public shower at some point actually convinced myself that it is true).  The super still hasn't come to fix it, and my roommate got so desperate that he managed to unscrew the knob and cause the hot water to turn on and not shut off.  Eventually we turned off the entire hot water supply to the apartment, and now desperately need our super to come ASAP.  Supers work on Martin Luther King Jr. Day, right?    Because I sure as hell do... that's the one bad thing about my new job at TRL... no holidays (except for the big ones).  The building is deserted, I had to sign in, the entrance closer to my subway station is locked... bah.  Finally, Panthers vs. Patriots?  Could the Super Bowl be any more boring?  At least nobody could've possibly predicted this at the start of the season.

       According to  urlLink this site , a Canadian newspaper listed the top ten bands that should reunite in this order: 1. Police 2. Spice Girls 3. The Kinks 4. ABBA 5. Van Halen 6. the Cure 7. the Smiths 8. GN'R 9. Cream 10. Talking Heads Spice Girls #2?  Don't think so. The Cure hasn't been broken up long enough to merit such a high ranking.  GnR should be MUCH higher (who in their right mind wouldn't want to see the original line-up back together).  Led Zepplin has been omitted.  Van Halen would be good as long as it was with Diamond Dave (not the recently-rumored Hagar version).  But most distressing is the omission of Pink Floyd.  Neither Roger Waters or David Gilmour has done the group justice since parting.  This is just another reason why Canada sucks.  Apparently Christina Applegate is  urlLink set  to be on the Robert Blake jury.  She's trying to get out of it, saying that her career will suffer from being stuck on the jury for five months.  Correct me if I'm wrong, but this would be her most consistent gig since  Married... with Children  was cancelled.   urlLink This story  is great.  I'm sure the restaurant could've avoided all the trouble by saying, "She asked for the soup without cream." (ba dum dum)   urlLink This one  is good too... besides learning to read, he'll get naptime and a refresher course on potty-training. (ba dum dum)

       The commercial for upcoming DVD / video release  Bring It On Again  includes the following VO line: " Bring It On  is one of the coolest movies ever." ???   I guess if the standard for being one of the coolest movies is to have a direct-to-video sequel, then we should also give props to  The Prophecy ,  Casper , and  Leprechaun IV: In Space .

       Went to DC over the weekend to visit some old friends from high school and had a blast... although I haven't had so much to drink (and so little sleep) in a long time.  Need another weekend to recover.  But I must say, the response by women down there when I tell them I write for  TRL  (at least after the initial disbelief) is excellent... I almost wish I lived down there, although I'd have to give up the  TRL  gig... damn catch-22...  Watched the DVD's of   urlLink The Ben Stiller Show  ... and for all of the critical praise it received, and the incredible cast and writers it had, it is surprisingly uneven (although maybe it's just slightly dated).  It does have some great moments, including most of episode 5 (the Melrose Heights 90210 sketch with Bob Odenkirk as the gay guy who everyone shuns because they think he's a robot is GENIUS), and the single funniest sketch is the parody of the Head & Shoulders' annoying "you've got dandruff" ads.  But a lot of skits ran way too long... I can understand why it only ran 13 episodes.  At least it was a starting point for a lot of great talent, especially David Cross & Judd Apatow.  Dino's "I Like It" just played on VH1 Classic... jeez.

       Quick random thoughts about the San Diego cast of  urlLink Real World :  1)  Cheers : to see that  urlLink Urkel  managed to get another tv gig... 2)  Cheers : to MTV for another first in reality television... a  urlLink cross-eyed person . 3)  Jeers : why do they even call it Real World anymore?  They should just call it Sex World... the first quotes out of every single cast member had to do with wanting to get some.

       Happy New Year, everyone.  Hope you all enjoyed the long weekends and celebrations.  Best of luck in 2004.  I’m starting a new job today at  TRL , and very awkwardly, too… the girl I’m replacing apparently hasn’t been told she has been let go… she is still sitting at my desk, plugging away in her sea of ignorance.  Can’t wait to see how this turns out.  New Year’s Eve… I’m talking to this girl, and after a quick exchange of backgrounds, she starts on the name game, which is successful approximately 1.3% of the time.  Except that she nails it, 2 for 2: first name is a guy with whom I went to summer camp, second name is possibly my best girl friend (as opposed to girlfriend) from college.  That never happens.  Insane.  Watching the Packers beat the Seahawks yesterday, I was probably the only person not living in (or born in) Seattle who became even less of a Favre fan.  I’ve never been crazy about him.  Yes, he can put some zip on the ball and fire off some beauties once in a while.  But he is also way too reliant on simply tossing the ball into the air and having his receivers reach for a jump ball.  His stats are insanely bloated by this, thanks to his constantly being surrounded by incredible receivers.  Kurt Warner also benefited from this, to the extent that he was ridiculously named MVP of Super Bowl XXXIV when his 80-yard TD pass that put the Rams up could just have easily been picked off and run back for a Titans touchdown.  The announcers on Sunday did a decent job of pointing out Favre's habit of chucking, but I still think he gets way too much credit.  I called my grandmother to wish her a happy New Year, and she referred to  Queer Eye for the Straight Guy  as “Five Queers and a Man.”  Gotta love her.  Finally, does it bother anybody else that, statistically speaking, all of the following musicians will be dead by the year 2025: Brian Wilson Paul McCartney Mick Jagger Keith Richards Paul Simon Aretha Franklin Roger Waters Pete Townsend Roger Daltrey Robert Plant Jimmy Page Neil Young James Brown Bob Dylan (* David Bowie could technically also be on this list, but for some reason I have a feeling that he will pull a Katherine Hepburn and be the coolest 98-year-old to ever exist) I don’t want people coming back at me arguing “they could all be dead tomorrow.”  Of course they could.  So could I.  I’m going strictly by age.  Anyway, 2025 will be a sad year if none of those people are around.

       I'm visiting my parents in Florida this weekend, which always leads to many memorable quotes... here are some favorites: 1) "Raise your hand if you want to go to Florida!  (after 2 people raise their hands) If you don't raise your hand, you can just stay in New York... (2 more people raise their hand)" - Song Airline attendant. 2) "We board our passengers by zone, so check your seat assignment; your zone will be listed directly beneath your seat number.  You ticket should say Zone 1-6.  If it says 'end zone' or 'twilight zone,' you're on the wrong flight." - same Song attendant. 3) "Don't open the window... you'll freeze to death!" - my mother, to my sister during the car ride to dinner our first night; according to the car thermometer, the outside temperature was 78 degrees. 4) "Why do they itch?" - my mother, asking me about the members of G-Unit's affinity for grabbing their balls in their videos. 5) "Do you want to eat at my place?  The last week of each month they serve the worst lunches... there's nothing there you would eat." - my grandmother, referring to the dining room at her assisted living complex when my sister and I asked her if she'd like to have lunch the following day. 6) "They don't know their ear from their A." - my grandmother, referring to the waiters at aforementioned dining room. 7) "What?  His name is Chet Whosin?" - my mother, after I informed her that the subject of a photo in her Annie Leibovitz book was Trent Reznor. 8) "You know what you are?  A pisser... when you go, do you make sure you get rid of it all?  Do you know how to do it right?  Do you need someone to teach you?" - my grandmother, grilling my sister on the proper urination methods due to my sister's habit of peeing approximately every 80 minutes. Good times...

       Some interesting stuff in the new issue of Rolling Stone: 1) After Ryan Adams fell offstage and broke his wrist, "the injury may take up to two months to heal, and he could lose twenty percent mobility in the wrist.  But the singer is in good spirits... 'Maybe I can learn to play guitar with my feet.'"  Yeah, or maybe you should give up performing altogether... that's obviously what God had in mind when he caused you to take a nosedive... 2) Avril Levigne, when asked what is her favorite board game: "I like Scrabble.  I'm actually pretty good at it, I think, because when I'm writing, I'm thinking of words."  There is no joke I could possibly make that is a better punchline that her quote on its own... 3) Quote from Beyonce Knowles: "I work really hard.  I'm a perfectionist.  If my video is wrong, I'm-a-fix it."  Guess that perfectionism doesn't carry over into her grammar...

       Last year I signed up to be part of the Compact Disc Minimum Advertised Price Antitrust Litigation.  Yesterday I finally got my settlement check in the amount of  $13.86 .  So basically, after years of having CD companies rip me off, I've been awarded enough money to almost go to a store and buy a new album.  Maybe if I put the money into a high-yield bond, I'll be able to afford  Smile  when it comes out in the fall...

       I was on the subway yesterday and ran into KFC Homeless Man again (see Feb. 14)... still had a bag full of KFC, although his supply seemed to have dwindled a bit.

       Happy Half-Birthday to me...  In commercials for  urlLink Gatorade , why does the ad read  Is  It  In You?  when the voice-over specifically says  Is It  In  You?   Doesn't make sense...  The press conference introducing A-rod as a Yankee was very exciting, but they're always too diplomatic.  When asked if he had anything to say to the Red Sox, why couldn't he say, "Screw you, Boston... you're going down"?  You know that's what he was thinking...

       Of all I have read so far regarding the A-rod trade (and it's been a lot), this is by far the best item:  The Rangers will wind up paying $140 million for three seasons with Rodriguez, an average of $46.7 million annually for three last-place finishes in the AL West. The Yankees will owe him $112 million over seven years.  Awesome!

       1:45am, Friday night / Saturday morning, Times Square subway station, uptown 1/2/3/9 platform.  A homeless man is digging eagerly into a garbage can, presumably in search of food.  A couple minutes later, a second homeless man wanders by, carrying a large Adidas sports bag with several stuffed animals protruding.  He puts the bag down and unzips it, revealing that the majority of the bag is filled with KFC: boxes of chicken, sealed side items, the works.  Noticing the garbage scavenger, he takes out two individual sides (both mashed potatoes and gravy, if I'm not mistaken) and says "Hey man, don't be digging through no garbage.  Take this."  The first man refuses to even acknowledge the second man, let alone accept the offering.  The second man puts the food back in the bag, then wanders around the platform screaming, "Crazy man don't want no KFC!  Crazy man don't want no KFC!" As the Post's Liz Smith says, " Only in New York, kids, only in New York ."

       I noticed a couple of bizarre moments in this week's  RW/RR Challenge: The Inferno  that I'm sure most people didn't pick up on: 1) After Leah says that she thinks Darrell is the sexiest guy there, it cuts to him talking to Julie, who is stroking his arm.  No offense to Darrell, but I'm sure that such pre-marriage fornication with an African-American is exactly the type of non-Mormon behavior that caused BYU to give Julie the boot. 2) In the club after Trischelle pisses everyone off, Jeremy comes up and attempts to calm her down... although it seems to me that he's actually trying to hit on her... and this happens while he's got Katie clinging to him... and Katie is so drunk that when he steps away from her, she basically topples over.  I think the general consensus already was that Jeremy is a tool, but the fact that he's trying to take advantage of two completely hammered girls nails this point home.  And while I have no respect for Katie, she certainly can do better than Jeremy, even in a state of complete obliteration. Nevertheless, an entertaining episode.

       I wish I was rich enough to own the MTV building... if I did, I would wire the elevators so that if anyone ever pressed a button that was already lit, they'd get a shock.  It doesn't make the elevator go any faster... get a clue.  While I'm at it, I would also add shock capabilities to subway doors so that people who block them would get zapped... or maybe some form of retractable blades would do the trick, things that shot out like Wolverine's claws... if somebody's arm is wedged between the doors, the blades would slice it right off, and the train could go on its merry way.

       My friend pointed this out to me last night, and it's pretty damn cool... Billy Zabka, the King of 80s movies ( Karate Kid ,  Just One of the Guys ,  Back to School ), is nominated for an Oscar this year!  It's true... Best Short Film (Live Action) for a movie called  Most (The Bridge) .   urlLink Check it out : A quick check at his  urlLink IMDB page   shows that it is in fact the same William (Billy) Zabka. Can you imagine the reaction if he wins?  The presenter announces his name, the audience applauds politely, but once he strides up to the stage and begins his acceptance speech, people slowly gasp as they realize, "Hey, that can't be Johnny Lawrence, can it?"  Would he thank Cobra Kai?  Would someone call out "Sweep the leg!"?  The possibilities are endless!   We have to start a campaign to get Zabka the Oscar.  Anyone have any ideas?  Who's with me?

       Here are the liner notes for the Referential Mix I made for Tommy:  1. Running Down a Dream - Tom Petty: What better way to kick off a mix than with a great guitar lick?  The ultimate driving song about listening to a driving song (Del Shannon’s “Runaway”) 2. Maybe Angels - Sheryl Crow: Elvis, Kurt Cobain, John Lennon, and Jesus (arguably the world’s first rock star). 3. Surrender - Cheap Trick: Makes me think of Damone from Fast Times more than it makes me think about Kiss, but a good song nonetheless.  Cheap Trick is actually going on tour with Aerosmith this summer… and Aerosmith just finished touring with Kiss… what a tangled web. 4. Born in the 50s - The Police: Would a song called “Born in the 80s” have any impact at all?  Instead of “screaming for the Beatles,” they’d be screaming for New Kids on the Block?  That’s an odd thing to think about. 5. The Seeker - The Who: I was all set to put “You Better, You Bet” on here, but changed at the last minute because 1) I had another song referencing T. Rex and 2) this is a better song.  Good thing too, because you put “You Better, You Bet” on yours.  Do you think anyone else has ever called Bob Dylan “Bobby”? 6. Blinded By the Light - Bruce Springsteen: I may have cheated a bit using a classical reference, but the lyrics of this song are incredible and come off much better than the poppier, more-famous version by Manfred Mann. 7. All the Young Dudes - Mott the Hoople: A better T. Rex-referential song that the Who’s. 8. Life Is Real – Queen: Subtitled “Song for Lennon.”   9. Make Me Lose Control - Eric Carmen: Odd that this is from an album released in 1977 but became a hit in 1988.  I remember hearing this song for the first time on a bus from the airport to summer camp (my first time going to camp without my sister) and being calm.  And I think that almost everyone knows the words to “Stand By Me” by heart. 10. Come On Eileen - Dexy's Midnight Runners: I came very close to not including this song, because I thought you’d hate it.  But the reference to Johnnie Ray was too good to pass up. 11. Beethoven (I Love to Listen to) – Eurythmics 12. Rocket - Def Leppard: I got the cassette of Hysteria when I was 8, and I’m sure that in my lifetime I’ve listened to that album more than any other.  Of course, when I was 8, I couldn’t identify any of the long list of references (except for “Benny & the Jets”). 13. The New Style - Beastie Boys: Could anyone think of a better rhyme for Jimmy Page than “the girlies I like are underage”? 14. When We Was Fab - George Harrison: Obviously there are covert references to the Beatles, but he also mentions songs by Dylan and Gayle McCormick.  I used to think this was one of the coolest videos ever made, but watching it now, it’s just cheesy – Ringo is the biggest ham in showbiz. 15. When Smokey Sings – ABC: When Smokey sings, I think of this song. 16. Life in a Northern Town - Dream Academy: I wouldn’t have put this on if you didn’t once mention that you liked Dream Academy, which took me by surprise.  Sadly, this is the 6th song on this mix that references the Beatles (or one of its members). 17. Fight the Power - Public Enemy  You can find Tommy's track list / liner notes  urlLink here .  He turned his into a double-CD; however, he doubled (and even tripled) up on many artists.  Selectivity is the hardest part of this type of project, which is why I'm penalizing him.  But I still have to give him credit for an excellent compilation and for introducing me to some fantastic music. *Note - after no duplicates in our first swap, we have 3 duplicates on this one, and 4 others that potentially could've been (I almost put in "You Better You Bet," "Dio," and "Do You Remember Rock & Roll Radio," he almost put in "Come On Eileen").  Fascinating similarities.

       I watched about 5 minutes of the Grammy's last night (saw the Foo Fighters perform, then turned it off when Coldplay won), but from the Post's  urlLink review  of it, it sounded great, especially:  The most cringe-inducing moment was when Sting, Vince Gill, Dave Matthews and Pharrell Williams paid homage to the Beatles on the 40th anniversary of the Fab Four's American conquest.  "American Idol" villain critic Simon Cowell always warns all of the amateur contenders, "Don't forget the words."  Yet when the quartet attempted "I Saw Her Standing There," Matthews Sang, "I saw her dancing there."  Sting glided along the chorus until he derailed on the Paul McCartney high note, and the harmonies sounded like somebody was hurting a dog.  The boys had nobody to blame but themselves, but poor Celine Dion who performed Luther Vandross' "Dance With My Father" was mired in technical difficulties.  While the camera focused in tightly on Dion, all you could hear was a now-unemployed sound guy repeatedly asking, "Should I take it up, should I take it up."  He finally took it up to the point that Dion busted a few eardrums when her upper register collided with a wall of feedback.  Ha and double-ha to Matthews and Dion... I hate you both.  Speaking of Foo Fighters, who would've thought ten years ago that by 2004 a spin-off band by Nirvana's drummer would have three times as many Grammys as Nirvana?  One last Grammy note...  urlLink Tommy  has the greatest line I think I've ever read in one of these event diary-type things:  8:45 Justin Trousersnake says "It's an honor" just to be in the company of the other nominees. If by "honor," you mean "travesty," bulls-eye, JT!  Tommy has helped me a lot with my writing, but it's moments like this where I realize I'll just never get to his level.

       You'll have to take my word for it, but believe me, if you go to Circuit City to pick up a stereo you ordered and after 30 minutes of waiting they still haven't brought it up from the downstairs warehouse, the only thing that keeps you from going insane is watching a 7-year-old boy singing and doing the Robot while "Barbie Girl" plays overhead as his dad gives him a look that pleads "please don't turn out gay"...

       It's been several days now since the Super Bowl, and I'm tired of hearing how great Tom Brady is... how he's the next coming of Joe Montana... how he's now a certain Hall-of-Famer.  Give me a break.  Although it's swapping sports, the best comparison for Brady is to Orlando Hernandez.  In his tenure with the Yankees, El Duque pitched ably (but certainly not spectacularly) for several seasons... yet he thrived during the postseason.  Will El Duque make the Hall?  Of course not.  If Brady keeps up his pace, should he?  Of course not.  Playing well (and let's not forget that Brady twice nearly cost the Pats wins this posteason with his late game in-the-endzone interceptions) for a few games a season is not enough to earn such respect. So drop the charade, okay?

I can't stop looking at this  urlLink two-headed baby ... although the second head looks like it belongs to the monkey from  Outbreak .    All 7  Police Academy  movies are coming out on DVD in April.  The only thing funnier than those movies?  This  urlLink press release .  "Law enfarcement" - that's gold!  And if there's anyone out there who thinks that the Police Academy Giftset (featuring all 7 films) will provide"hard-core laughter," I'd love to meet him / her.  The NFL has  urlLink bounced JC Chasez  from performing at the Pro-Bowl.

       Yesterday Tommy and I exchanged our Track 5 mixes... and, as expected, his was far superior to mine.  Mine was 18 tracks, his 21.  High points of mine:  - Tom Petty, "It's Good To Be King" (from Wildflowers) - Pearl Jam, "Wash" (from Lost Dogs)  - Eels, "3 Speed" (from Electro-Shock Blues) - STP, "Still Remains" (from Purple) - Glen Phillips, "My Own Town" (from Abulum) - Cyndi Lauper, "She-Bop" (from She's So Unusual) High points of his:  - Pulp, "Disco 2000" (from Different Class) - Buzzcocks, "Ever Fallen in Love" (from Singles Going Steady) - Replacements, "Waitress in the Sky" (from Tim) - Tom Waits, "The Piano Has Been Drinking (Not Me)" - Stevie Wonder, "Sir Duke" (from Songs in the Key of Life) - Pink Floyd, "The Gunner's Dream" (from The Final Cut).  How could I have left off "Sir Duke"???  Tommy claims that he likes mine, but he knows he won this battle.  The war has yet to be decided, however... next week will be another mix... topic is Songs That Reference Other Songs / Musicians.  Stay tuned...

       So it looks like my predictions for the Super Bowl were WAY off.  It was a surprisingly good game, although I would’ve liked a different outcome.  And it should’ve been a different outcome… the Panthers lost the game more than the Patriots won it.  So many mistakes in the 4th quarter: 1) Going for 2 points with 12 minutes to play. 2) Going for 2 points again. 3) Calling a time-out when they got down to the 15 yard line with 1:07 left. 4) Not calling a running play to eat up some time. 5) Booting the kickoff out of bounds. If they had simply kicked extra points every time, they would’ve been up 31-28 (NE would not have tried a 2-pointer either), so the field goal would’ve sent the game into overtime instead of sending the Panthers home as runner-ups.  And how could they possibly give the Pats so much time?  Did they learn nothing from Super Bowl XXXVI?  Very frustrating. Other notes from watching the game: - Who didn't know that Vinatieri would miss the first field goal when they showed the graphic saying that his only 2 misses indoors took place at Reliant Stadium? - The commercials were AWFUL.  Truth had 2 of my favorite ads… how sad is that? - I didn’t know that Unfrozen Caveman Lawyer played for the Panthers (#86, Kris Mangum) - How pretentious of Pepsi to try to take credit for Hendrix’s career.  What’s next, a commercial where Christopher Columbus asks for permission to find a faster passage to India for better access to Pepsi?  (Interesting to note that had Hendrix picked the accordion, he would most likely still be alive today… although would anybody know who he is?  Makes you think…) - The Halftime show was also AWFUL.  I told my friend Matt that if the stage had blown up, it would’ve eliminated 3 of my top-10 Least-Favorite People Alive (P. Diddy, Kid Rock, Justin Timberlake).  And my ass they didn’t plan to have Janet’s boob hanging out.   - As the second half was beginning, Phil Simms made this genius comment: “Don’t forget that historically, lots of stuff happens in the 2nd half.” (approximate quote)  I don’t know that I’d say a lot… more like half the stuff happens in the 2nd half.  Thanks for that brilliant analysis. It’ll be a long 7 months until the start of next season.  I saw  Monster  over the weekend and liked it a lot.  Charlize Theron really does give an incredible performance, although I think it had been built up a bit too much.  One thing I found odd was that it seems that in South Florida in the 1980s, every car on every street was not actually driving anywhere, but was in fact trolling for hookers.  I grew up in South Florida in the 80s and never noticed this phenomenon... and it makes me wonder my dad actually was going out to "go bowling with the guys" on Wednesday nights... It's also interesting how prostitute movies have evolved over the past 15 years.   Monster  and  Pretty Woman  would be much different films if you swapped the lead characters.   Monster  would make more sense if Christina Ricci's character kept telling Julia Roberts' Vivian how pretty her face was... although having Aileen Wuornos in  Pretty Woman  would have had a hilarious effect on one scene in particular: (walks up to snooty saleswoman) "Hi... remember me? I was in here yesterday and you wouldn't wait on me. " (pulls out gun) "Big mistake." (shoots saleswoman in the stomach) "Huge!" (fires several more bullets into saleswoman's chest, the calmly walks away)

Need to get buff. -I've never heard anyone say they need to get buff for Vegas.  What you doing there? -Dude, what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas.  All I can say is there's a pole with my name on it.  Bunch of assholes.

There are 8 disks, as opposed to 7 in the regular edition... the 8th contains additional deleted scenes, table reads, audition footage, etc.  Can't wait to start watching!  I hope this sells well so that they can do the same thing for  Undeclared .  Go out and buy it... NOW!

       British magazine  urlLink Q  is having a contest where people submit questions to ask Slash during an upcoming interview... if your question is picked, you win 25 quid (about $45).  Here are the questions I submitted: -When's the last time you went out in public without your sunglasses and hat? -Is your name a noun or a verb? -How big is your snake? -You played at the Michael Jackson anniversary show where they blurred out his face.  What were they covering up? -When's the last time you went to the beach?  And is your bathing suit made out of leather like the rest of your wardrobe? -Have you ever made out with Axl? -What's the one guitar riff you wish you'd written? -With the success of musicals featuring music by Queen, Abba, Billy Joel, etc., there's now talk of a Wham! musical.  What are your thoughts about that?  Any chance of a GnR musical? -You appeared in the cartoon  Kid Notorious .  What are some of your favorite cartoons besides that one? I hope at least one of those is worth money.

       Saturday night (Sunday morning) on the subway, a homeless woman comes through the train asking people for food and/or money.  I'm listening to my iPod, so I can't hear exactly what is said, but she angrily turns to a group of people and says "Who said that?  You don't know me.  Don't talk shit about someone you don't know.  I'm no different from the rest of you."  Well, yeah, except that you're the only one asking people for food and/or money. You make think I have a bad attitude towards the homeless, but excuse me if they've made me jaded... case in point, I transfer to another subway to find a homeless man asking for food and/or money.  Everyone turns him down except for one couple... the man opens his wallet and apparently only finds big bills, so the girl opens her purse and gives the guy 3 singles.  The homeless man adds it to his stack of 1 single, counts it, then asks if they have another couple bucks so he can buy (something unintelligible).  The couple says that's all they can give, sorry, and the homeless man starts cursing them out, saying "That's bullshit!  I know you got more money!"  No good deed goes unpunished... and I only give money to really good subway performers.

       "Off the Hook" update: I don't know what's going on... today La La described yesterday's Usher performance as "bananas"... she's obviously lost her mind.  Thus ends the "Off the Hook" counter. Vanessa, on the other hand, called herself "retarded" on the air for the second time in three days.  She keeps getting yelled at, but it's probably... retarded people don't watch  TRL  anyway, and if they do, they can't operate the remote if they get pissed off and want to change the channel.

       As a former employee at  urlLink Troma , I couldn't be more pleased with this excerpt from Friday's New York Times review of  Dawn of the Dead :  ... Mr. Snyder's blood feast is strictly by the numbers; this second-rater could be the world's most expensive Troma film.  That makes sense: the screenwriter for the remake, James Gunn, also banged out  Tromeo and Juliet , that no-budget B-movie-studio's seminal film (that is, if the word seminal can be appended to Troma).  Still, this is the first studio picture to exhibit the tacky Troma influence, which means - something, like the end of shame in Western civilization, perhaps.  Hear, hear.

       Was at an apartment party on Saturday night where a few of my friends took Ecstasy, which is no big deal (although that particular party seemed an odd environment to take it), but for some reason it made me think of the episode of  Beverly Hills, 90210  where the gang goes to a club and Brandon's crazy girlfriend Emily slipped E in his drink and he started acting all freaky and he pissed off the rest of his friends and his car got trashed when he left it at the club and the whole time Steve and Andrea are going to different convenience stores trying to "exchange an egg" to get the address of the club and the next day everyone has learned a lesson about drugs... I haven't seen that episode since it aired, which is at least 10 years ago, and I can remember it so clearly... now that's a sign of good television. What isn't good television was last night's episode of  The Simpsons , which for the second week in a row featured a parody that would've been fresh and appropriate last millennium.  And while the  Star Wars  parody had its moments, the other 18 or so minutes were awful.  My roommate has given up on the show... I may do so as well.  For shame, Simpsons, for shame.

       Saw a preview screening of   urlLink The Anchorman   last night... I'm not a fan of Will Farrell, especially in large doses, but the movie did have a few quality laughs, particularly from Steve Carell of "The Daily Show."  It's also loaded with guest stars and cameos: Vince Vaughn, Ben Stiller, Jack Black.  This group, along with Owen Wilson, has become the equivalent of the crop of comedians who appeared in some combination in basically every comedy from the early 80's: Bill Murray, John Candy, Dan Aykroyd, Chevy Chase, Harold Ramis.  Compare their talents and the films they were in ( Ghostbusters ,  Stripes ,  Caddyshack ,  Vacation ,  Little Shop of Horrors , even  The Great Outdoors ) to the work of the current guys and there is no comparison.  The newbies have their moments (Owen Wilson and Jack Black especially), but will any of their movies be considered classic comedies?  Makes me long for the good old days.

       Saw Neil Young & Crazy Horse perform   urlLink Greendale   (and a selection of hits) at Radio City last night.  Excellent concert.   Greendale  is terrific music; the staging is bizarre.  It's like watching a really early 80's music video where the singer acts out every single lyric.  Pretty cheesy, actually.  I think it would've been better had he simply played the music without the actors onstage.  I'm sure the movie is even worse than the staging.  But I highly recommend the album, and Neil can still rock with the best of them (the show lasted almost 3 hours).  He also hasn't lost his edge... at one point a heckler kept yelling out "Cinnamon Girl" during one of Neil's expository monologues, and Neil finally shouted back "Shut up, asshole!" much to the delight of the crowd.  Why people feel there cannot be a single moment of silence during a rock concert without somebody whistling, cheering, or yelling things out escapes me.  This is why I hate people.   On a related concert note, a former co-worker had e-mailed me yesterday to tell me about Courtney Love's surprise gig at the Kitten Klub last night.  I was planning on going after Neil Young, but once again inertia got the best of me.  Then, of course,  urlLink this  happened.  I always miss the good stuff.

       I love the fact that I, a 24-year-old nobody, wrote words that Donald Trump had to say on national television... and that he'd come into the control room and be instructed to point to a monitor, and he'd do it.  He was $3 billion worth of putty in my hands.

       Donald Trump is on the show today, and we're doing a parody of  The Apprentice .  Should be an interesting show... I have a feeling Trump is gonna look like a deer in headlights in this environment.   I went to college with his son Donnie, and was on the same flight as him coming down to Florida for Thanksgiving one year... I sat across the aisle from him and was able to hear his conversation with the man sitting next to him... the guy was talking to Donnie about Wharton, business life, etc., and while Donnie never said he was Trump's son, he would drop hints such as saying his dad is in real estate, he's going to his golf resort, etc.  At the end of the flight the guy gave Donnie a business card and offered to help him get a job.  I wanted so badly to pull the guy aside and say "Do you realize you've been talking to Donald Trump's son?" just to see his reaction.

       I recently watched  Shocked  on Trio, which was about Shockwave's ill-fated partnership with Trey Parker and Matt Stone.  In 1999 Shockwave paid them $2 million to create short cartoons for their website, giving them full creative control.  Matt & Trey came up with Princess, a cartoon about a cute puppy who witnesses lots of digusting things (like a husband whose wife gives him such a good blow-job his cum shoots her head right off).  Shockwave never posted the episodes.   Shocked  gave clips of them... I've now discovered full versions of the first 2 episodes.  They're sick... and hilarious.  I love it!  urlLink Episode 1   urlLink Episode 2

       On today's  TRL , Dr. Science (a.k.a. Vanessa Minnillo) gave the following fact:  "You know, snow turns into ice, which is water."  MTV now qualifies as educational television.

       Did anybody else notice on  The Simpsons  last night that they basically showed where Springfield is in the couch gag?  During the  2001  parody, the camera zoomed out from a map of the US and came up from either Michigan or Illinois.  Dunno if that was intentional or not, but I'm sure  Simpsons  geeks around the globe are up in arms (and yes, I'm one of them). I also have to express my disappointment last night's episode.  A  Blair Witch Project  parody?  Come on... they should've avoided that altogether, since it's so overdone, but to do it 6 years after it came out?  Please...

       Went to Siberia last night for  urlLink Lindsayism's  birthday party.  I usually hate situations where I go somewhere and only know 1 person, especially when that person happens to be the host, but it wasn't too bad... I just wish that she had more than 2 friends who weren't male hipsters (and I'd love for her to atttempt to deny that fact... I now totally agree with the  urlLink Daily News , which referred to her as a "bona fide Gen-X Williamsburg hipster").  But I'm glad I went, and Happy Birthday to you, Lindsay!

       I was deciding whether or not to get tickets to see Courtney Love at  urlLink Bowery Ballroom  on the 18th... not because I'm a fan of hers, but because I want to be able to tell people "Yeah, I saw her last concert ever when she went totally insane and then killed herself / went to jail"... the likelihood of that happening is huge.  But ultimately I passed, and tickets sold out within minutes.  Hope I didn't make the same mistake I made when I passed up a chance to see INXS 2 weeks before Michael Hutchence killed himself.

       Did anyone read the  Entertainment Weekly  article about Justin Guarini?  If you looked up  douchebag  in the dictionary, you would find his picture.  First of all, why on earth does he deserve a 4-page article?  And where does he get the balls to say something like this?  "I'm here to entertain, to bring joy to people, to bring light to dark places of the world."  Justin, if you truly believe that, you can start by never opening your mouth again.      On a more positive note, Steve Martin's  urlLink article  in  New Yorker  titled "Studio Script Notes on 'The Passion'" is one of the funniest things I've ever read.  Love the exchange between the 2 spectators as to why Jesus doesn't use his superpowers to save himself.  I was wondering that, too.  Steve Martin is a genius.  Bring him back to host the Oscars next year.

       Does anyone else think that  The Passion of the Christ  would have been VASTLY improved if, at the end when Jesus is revealed in profile at the tomb, he had turned to the camera and winked?  Maybe even said something like, "I told you I'd be back!"... that would've been AWESOME!!!

       Saw a screening of  Jersey Girl  over the weekend... trust me, you do NOT want to see this movie.  But if you feel the need to, here are some pointers... 1) When the movie starts, you may think that you've stumbled into the middle of the 300,000th TNT showing of  Kindergarten Cop .  The similarity is so great, you may be certain.  But trust me, it is not  Kindergarten Cop ... although in a few minutes, you may wish it was. 2) Ben Affleck is a terrible, TERRIBLE actor... note the scene when he arrives at the hospital. 3) For some reason, the video store Ben and his daughter frequent is the only video store in the world that stocks multiple copies of  Children of the Corn 666 .  In fact, approximately 44% of all the movies there are  666 ,  Scream , or  Copland .  Bizarre. 4) Ben and his daughter must be immune to a disease that has wiped out the entire population of Manhattan, because they are the only 2 people walking through Central Park on a gorgeous afternoon and the only 2 people (except for the driver) when they take a horse-drawn carriage ride through the city on a beautiful night. There's more, but I'd rather not waste space here.  How Kevin Smith could possibly think this is his best movie boggles the mind...

       There are certain stories that, although great to read, definitely cry out for video.   urlLink This  is one of them.  The best part of the story is that one of the guys involved in the fight lives in the same nursing home as his mother.  That's so much worse than having to move back into your parents' house.  I didn't think the concept of nursing homes could be more painful, but that would do it.

       Got myself a copy of the full Paris Hilton tape yesterday... had to trade a   urlLink Bubba Ho-Tep   bedpan for it (that may have been a once-in-a-lifetime find, but really, what's the point of having a bedpan if you're not gonna use it?).  That Paris is one very dirty girl.  The "trailer" doesn't do justice to the amount of sex these two have.  And, in typical porn-star fashion, Paris looks bored and miserable throughout the entire thing, except at the very end when Rick explodes all over her chest and she rubs it on like sunscreen.  He also gets away with spanking her and calling her "bitch" and jokes about her being underage.  Quite a pair, these two. Is the footage worthy of all the press it's gotten?  No.  Would I pay $50 for it?  No.  Is it worth more than that bedpan?  That remains to be seen... but now that I have the Paris video, I'll have to find something else in which to collect my fluids...

       I'm on an elevator heading up to the 23rd floor.  Doors open at 21 so somebody can exit.  Girl walks on.  Buttons for 22, 23, and 30 are already lit.  She presses 7.  Other people in the car give her a weird look.  Elevator goes up to 22.  Doors open, someone gets out.  The light for 7 turns off.  Girl presses it again.  Doors close, elevator goes up to 23.  Girl has to realize at this point that the elevator is going in the wrong direction.  I get out, expecting girl to follow and switch elevators rather than go all the way up to 30.  She stays.  Probably presses 7 again. Why is my building full of morons?

       The mix project continues... today's theme was Cover Songs.  Here is the tracklist and liner notes for the mix I made for Tommy:  1.  Hazy Shade of Winter – The Bangles (Simon & Garfunkel):  As always, I like to start these mixes off with solid guitar riffs, which this song has.  Sounds great on a good stereo (or headphones), where the riff bounces between the left and right speakers. 2.  Rock & Roll - Jane's Addiction (Velvet Underground):  I’m not a big fan of either Jane’s Addiction or Velvet Underground, but for some reason I really like how JA sounds doing this song. 3.  Wild Horses - The Sundays (Rolling Stones):  Hard to believe one of my favorite Stones songs could be improved upon, especially in a version prominently used by a WB TV show, but this version is haunting… it’s more of a stalker song than a love song here. 4.  The Ocean - Melissa Quade (Led Zepplin):  I wish I could cut out the end, because it almost ruins the song, but I think she’s a great singer and does a terrific job stripping down this song. 5.  Try Some, Buy Some - David Bowie (George Harrison):  It’s sad that the best song on Bowie’s new album is a cover, but not really since this is really great. 6.  Working in a Coal Mine - Devo (Lee Dorsey):  Devo makes it seem like it could be a whole lotta fun to work in a coal mine. 7.  Mona (I Need You Baby) - Rolling Stones (Bo Diddley):  Yeah, so much of the early Stones material is covers, and those songs don’t show off the band’s skills, but out of all their early stuff I think this is there best cover. 8.  The Passenger - Siouxsie & the Banshees (Iggy Pop):  This song is probably the most faithful to the source material, but Siouxsie sounds great singing this. 9.  Always Something There to Remind Me - Naked Eyes (Lou Johnson):  As far as improving upon source material, I don’t think you can do much better than this. 10.  White Lines - Duran Duran (Grandmaster Flash):  DD started the encore with this song during their Webster Hall show and almost blew the roof off the place.  Sure, it’s borderline laughable when Grandmaster Flash trades rhymes with Simon LeBon, but it’s a song I could crank all they way up while driving. 11.  Girl U Want - Soundgarden (Devo):  Simple song that Soundgarden didn’t alter too much; they simply made it their own, and it works.   12.  Ben - Crispin Glover (Michael Jackson):  Michael Jackson singing about a rat = creepy.  Crispin Glover singing about a rat = creepier.  Although Crispin Glover makes just about anything creepier. 13.  Thirteen - Garbage (Big Star):  I wish some girl had made these offers to me when I was thirteen.  Shirley Manson’s voice is just too damn sexy.  This is probably my favorite song on the mix. 14.  Handbags & Gladrags - Stereophonics (Michael D'abo):  Being such a huge fan of “The Office,” I tried to find the version that plays in the credits.  It’s never been released, but this version is almost identical.  It’s also the only Stereophonics song I can stomach. 15.  Save It For Later - Harvey Danger (English Beat):  “Flagpole Sitta” is such an annoying song, it’s a marvel I even gave this a chance… but I’m glad I did, because I think they did a great job with it. 16.  Ball of Confusion - Love & Rockets (The Temptations):  Not only a cover, but also a lyrical update. 17.  Rent - Carter the Unstoppable Sex Machine (Pet Shop Boys):  When I was in Scotland, I had a friend who loved Pop Will Eat Itself, Carter the USM, and Pet Shop Boys’ “Rent.”  Every conversation concerning music would eventually lead to one (or more) of these three topics.  This song nails 2 of the 3.  I don’t particularly like Carter, which is an opinion shared by most people (that is, of people who know of him, which in this country is virtually nobody), and I’m not wild about this version of the song, so more than anything I put it on here in honor of my friend, Laurie. 18.  Rock & Roll All Nite - Toad the Wet Sprocket (Kiss):  One of the things that most attracts me to a cover is when they alter the mood of the song.  This one does that in spades.  I just wish I could’ve found a version that cuts out the lame intro. 19.  The Girl Is Mine – Penn-6 (Michael Jackson / Paul McCartney):  If the a-capella groups at Penn were organized like the Greek system, Pennsylvania 6-5000 would be the Animal House: lots of drinking, drugs, crazy parties, date-rape, etc.  At performances, they’d get so trashed they could barely sing.  So it boggles the mind that they could arrange and sing songs that sound as good as this. 20.  Timeless Melody - Pearl Jam (The La's):  PJ has so many covers to choose from… I tried to pick one I was pretty sure you’ve never heard.  The original of this is great, and it’s a shame the La’s broke up so early in their career, although I hear a reunion is in the works.  This is just a great little pop song; nothing more, nothing less.

       Tommy  urlLink Sticking Point  took the very creative step of commenting on my Oscar diary instead of writing his own, and he did a bang-up job.  Not to turn this into a never-ending cycle, but here's a few comments I have on his notes:  8:51  Brian writes : Tim Robbins ... seems to have found a surefire way to avoid the orchestra cue: discuss sexual abuse. Future winners, take note.  Tommy's Second Opinion : But to make it more interesting, name names. Start with "Michael Jackson."  Brian's Third Opinion : Name names, but make shit up... maybe use a director who rejected you for a part.  Hey, you just won an Oscar... see how far you can push things before your career instantly implodes.  9:24  Brian writes : Tom Hanks’ entire face is sagging… it’s as if a bowling ball is dangling from his chin.  TSO : Man, I have had it with this guy. How many GREAT movies has he made? Two? IMDB's got 37 films to his credit. That's a really crappy ratio.  BTO : Yes, but he's hosted SNL like three thousand times... that should count for something, methinks.  10:05  Brian writes : I loved The Days of Wine & Ro and Victor / Victo; long live ake Edwards!  TSO : akes me wish I had a widescreen TV. What a load of shi  BTO : Damn, Tommy just nailed the punchline that I totally fucked up.  That's why he makes the big bucks.  11:03  Brian writes : Jamie Lee Curtis’ breasts have varicose veins. Nasty.  TSO : ...and they go all the way down to her penis. Gross.  BTO : That JLC-was-born-a-man is one of the most bizarre Hollywood urban legends of all time.  Although it would explain how she and Christopher Guest are a couple.  Thank you for cleaning up my spills, Tommy.  I should also note that I came in second place in my Oscar pool, losing by 1.  Damn LOTR sweep...

       The Oscars finally ended about half an hour ago, and damn, were they boring!  Regardless, here's my show diary...  8:00: Apparently the pre-show starts now, not the actual show… already this fucks up my Oscar pool, since our tiebreaker question is “What time will the show end?”  I put 11:28… I should’ve put 11:58.  Thankfully it’s the 76th annual show, which isn’t a multiple of 5, so we won’t have to put up with stupid retrospectives… or will we?  8:29: I’ve watched about 5 minutes of pre-show, and this Billy guy inside the auditorium has made the following people terribly uncomfortable: Alec Baldwin, Sandra Bullock, Ben Kingsley, Renee Zellweger, Nicole Kidman, Johnny Depp,and Keisha Castle-Hughes.  Where did they find this chump?  The Ryan Seacrest Reject Factory?  8:30: Sean Connery opens the show saying “for more than 100 years, people have been fascinated by movies.”  And for 40 years, people have been fascinated by his eyebrows… they move seemingly without purpose!  8:36: The Magic of Movie montage – decent; Billy’s impression of Jack – awful.  8:39: That joke about the differences from 13 years ago was fresh about 13 comedians ago.  8:46: Is Peter Weir married to Cheryl Hines?  8:47: Cut to Marc Shaiman blowing kisses to the camera.  Wait, he’s gay?  8:51: Tim Robbins wins; I’m 1-for-1 in my pool.  And he seems to have found a surefire way to avoid the orchestra cue: discuss sexual abuse.  Future winners, take note.  8:53: 23 minutes in, only 1 award.  At this rate I should’ve guessed 5:18am.  9:01:  LOTR  wins its first, Art Direction… gonna be a long night for them.  And is the gray-haired guy Peter Jackson in disguise?  Calm down, I’m sure you’ll be up there later in the night.  9:02: Peter Jackson is so fat, he can’t button the top button of his shirt or tighten his tie.  Kinda sad.  9:05: Robin Williams playfully butchers the names of the Best Animated Film nominees by using a playful lisp.  Way to destroy their one moment of glory.  9:06:  Triplets  was robbed.  Take that, France… that’s for not sending troops to the Middle East!    9:07: Sounds of Oscar = Instant Replay.  Who are they trying to kid?  9:11: It’s official: I’m evil… all I can think right now is “Please, Renee, trip and fall down the stairs.”  9:19: Aghdashloo looks just like Catherine Zeta-Jones.  Eerie resemblance.   9:21: Renee wins, and it looks like she’s still looking for a place to store those nuts for winter.  Better get a move on… it’s March already.    9:24: Tom Hanks’ entire face is sagging… it’s as if a bowling ball is dangling from his chin.  9:25: Why are they playing the  Forrest Gump  theme for the Bob Hope tribute?  Are they implying he was a retard?  9:33: Damn, Billy Zabka didn’t win… they didn’t even show his face.  Guess there will be no “Sweep the leg” jokes tonight.  9:35: The other winner looks PISSED he didn’t get to talk.  That’s it… their friendship is over.  9:37: Random Baldwin (non-Alec) sighting.  Was it Billy or Daniel?  Does anyone really care?  9:38: Liv Tyler is going with the Lisa Loeb look, and she pulled it off BIG TIME.  9:44: The back-up singers for “Scarlet Tide” look like they could be Senators.  9:56: Yawn.  This isn’t my first yawn, but it’s the first one I’ve written down.  This may be the most boring Oscar ceremony I’ve ever seen.  10:01: Jennifer Garner deserves an Oscar for acting interested throughout the entire tech awards.  10:02: Crap, Jim Carrey has leukemia again.  10:05: I loved  The Days of Wine & Ro  and  Victor / Victo ; long live ake Edwards!  10:15: It’s official: Bill Murray has the best line of the night for “We were refused.”  10:20: Was the first make-up winner in the poster for   urlLink Meet the Deedles  ?  10:21: Sandra Bullock says “You were early.”  Good one.  10:28: Sean Penn is not amused by Julia Roberts.  But then again, is he ever?  10:33: The guy who played the crazy vet who works at Peterman in an episode of  Seinfeld  is a seatfiller… he’s sitting next to Zeta-Jones.  I swear (thanks to DVR for rewind & pause so I could verify that).  Well, that’s one way to go to the Oscars.  10:37: Oprah: “I love a great movie.”  You know, for years I’ve been telling people just how much alike Oprah and I are… then she has to go and ruin it with a crazy statement like that.  10:45: Billy Crystal just gave a great follow-up with his “tax audit” joke.  He does still have some life left in him.  10:47: The President of the Academy just said “Attixus,” then said “Attixus” again.  Do all Presidents have problems talking?  10:50: Holy shit, Stan Brakhage died!  Oh wait, I have no idea who that is.  Nevermind.  11:00: I’m glad Julianne Moore was amused by Pierce Brosnan’s editing joke… she was the only one.  11:01: How did  LOTR  win Best Editing?  It never ended!  Damn bandwagoners…  11:03: Jamie Lee Curtis’ breasts have varicose veins.  Nasty.  11:16: Jack Black’s jump-and-land-in-a-kneel would’ve been much cooler had he been wearing a cape.  I’m just saying…  11:18: Would a song like “Flashdance” ever get a nomination these days, let alone win?  11:22: Canada wins Best Foreign Language Film.  They should’ve named the movie  The Barbarian Inv-eh-sion .  Get it?  (There you have it, my worst joke of the night)  11:31:  LOTR  won Adapted Screenplay?  That’s it, it’s gonna be a clean sweep.  Has that ever happened before?  11:33: Tim Robbins and Susan Sarandon: Academy Award-winning couple.  That’s awesome.  11:42: Time for Best Director.  Please let  City of God  win something…  11:43: Crap.  11:44: The woman who escorts the winners offstage is HOT!  And she towers over Tom Cruise.  11:46: Can we safely admit that Adrian Brody’s career is over already?  And he has a weird walk… it’s like the way a Ken doll would move.  11:48: Yeah Charlize… my dad and I have been expecting this since October 1996, when we saw  2 Days in the Valley .  11:59: Best Actor this year is the TOUGHEST CATEGORY EVER!!!  12:01: Wow, Penn got a HUGE ovation.  Then he says it’s pretentious to write a speech.  Way to slap any winner who has ever done that.  He’ll never win again.  12:05:  LOTR  officially sweeps everything.  Yawn.  That’s the end of the most boring Oscar ceremony ever (and the most boring Oscar diary ever).

       The new issue of  Time Out New York  (with the 2004 Eat Out Awards) has an article about how the salary  urlLink demands  by the cast members of  The Simpsons  may be a good thing, because it could put the show out of its misery.  I couldn't agree more.  This article matches my opinion of the show so perfectly, it could've been written by me.  The quality of the show has sunk to levels I never imagined possible.  The classic episodes still handle the test of time, but the overall legacy of the show has been badly tarnished by the past 5 or so years.  It's definitely time to pack it in.   Sadly, TONY's  urlLink website  is too cheap to post the article, but it's on page 169, so go out and buy a copy (or go to one of those newsstands and read it without buying it... not that I condone such behavior).

        (Beware spoilers in this post!)  I'm pretty bummed at  24 .  Obviously a show like that has to take certain liberties with what's realistic.  But last night's episode had perhaps the biggest cop-out in the show's history.  Michelle, the CTU agent stuck inside the hotel where the virus had been released, tested negative.  The virus infects almost 100% of the population, yet this major character avoids it.  And why?  So that 20 minutes later she can be kidnapped by the terrorist so that he can make an escape and have the show leave us with another cliffhanger.  Probably the worst non-Kim-related moment in the show's 3 years (the overall worst moment is Kim getting caught in the cougar trap, but that's a whole 'nother story...).

       Sad  urlLink news  about the death of  urlLink Hubert Selby Jr .  He was an excellent author, writing books including  Requiem for a Dream , which was adapted into one of my Top 10 Favorite Movies of All Time (I'll have to do a post on that at some point).  He will be missed.

       On the subway yesterday coming home from work, I had the pleasure of sharing a train with the "Subterranean Comedian."  And what a pleasure it was!  He treated my fellow riders and me to such gems as:  "I told my wife to take the 2 train... so she took the 1 train twice!" (ba dum dum) "My wife went to a movie, and the sign said 'Under 17 not admitted.'  So she rounded up 16 strangers to go with her!" (ba dum dum) "Now please donate to the cause... 'cause I need the money!" (ba dum dum)  Shockingly, nobody gave him any money.

       Went to an  urlLink Einstuzende Neubauten  concert at Irving Plaza with Tommy  urlLink Sticking Point  on Saturday night... I'd never heard of, let alone heard, them before... but Tommy said they were a cool German band from the 80s, so I figured they'd be like Kraftwerk and I'd enjoy it.  I should've been clued in that in fact they are not like Kraftwerk when I arrived to a sea of pseudo-Goth-punk NYU students waiting to get in.  I also expected them to dress like Falco (dunno why... he's not even German), but they all came out dressed in trendy, head-to-toe black outfits.  The lead singer looked like  urlLink Steve Buscemi  with longer hair, the bass player like  urlLink Tom Savini  (the before photo) in a halter top, the drummer like a black-haired cross between the drummer from  urlLink Crowded House  and the lead singer of  urlLink Flock of Seagulls , the random percussionist like the love child of  urlLink Clint Howard  and  urlLink Robert Benigni , and fairly normal-looking guitarist and keyboardist.  One of the interesting aspects of their music is that they utilize power tools, metal objects, and construction materials in their percussion and rhythm sections... kind of like  urlLink Blue Man Group , but not really.  I really liked the first 8 or so songs, but then the concert really started dragging.  There is definitely a threshold for how much of that you can listen to at once, especially for a first-timer, and they exceeded it by almost an hour.  It didn't help that there was a lot of time spent between songs badmouthing Clear Channel (which isn't such a bad thing, but spread the show too thin).  I'm not sure I'll ever buy one of their CD's, and I doubt I would see one of their concerts again, but I thank Tommy for expanding my musical horizons. P.S.  If the blonde-haired, pink-shirted girl from the show who kept following me around is reading, please leave me alone... you were kinda creeping me out!

Try that, he'll hit 50 points off that a—— of yours."   Yeah, now I can see why LeBron was so pissed off about winning this year's Rookie of the Year award... oh wait...

       Comedy Central keeps showing commercials for these  urlLink Chaser  anti-hangover pills.  I'm very curious to try one.

       So in last night's episode of  24 , wunder-idiot Kim was given a field-op assignment, much to Jack's chagrin.  He tried his best to talk his superior out of letting her do it (to protect her, not because he didn't think she could do it), but he was overruled.  If I were Jack, I would have simply said, "You want to put the security of our country in the hands of my daughter, who a couple years ago got caught in a cougar trap?!?"... I think that would've done the trick.

       Some thoughts on last night's  Apprentice  finale... - Did anyone else notice that during one of Heidi's confessionals (it looked like it took place in a gazebo), there was a couple frolicking on the grass behind her?  Fucking hilarious. - Best moment: Jessica Simpson giving Kwame advice about staying calm under pressure, that things will always work out.  Sure they will Jessica, when you have people doing them for you... but you can't even operate a vacuum, so keep your thoughts about business management to yourself. - It was cool when they pulled away the walls of the boardroom to reveal the audience, but the rest of the live portion was so awkward.  Bill has one of the goofiest smiles I've ever seen... Trump can't read off a prompter... the question and answer with the former contestants was bizarre, especially when he asked Tammy a question about her pregnancy and then didn't let her answer... Sam unsuccessfully trying to bribe Trump to offer him a job (nice that Sam is able to fill a briefcase with $250,000 in cash... I could never do that... does that make Sam cooler than me?)...  - Ereka and Omarosa were forced to sit next to each other, and Trump even brought up the fact that Omarosa accused Ereka of calling her the "N" word, but the worst that happened was that Ereka called Omarosa a liar... where was the catfight?

       The news about the death of "Weird Al" Yankovic's parents is sad, and this  urlLink press release  he wrote is even sadder.  But that won't stop me from relaying some great jokes Tommy " urlLink Sticking Point " e-mailed me about the incident...  "Weird Al" Yankovic’s elderly parents were found dead in their home last weekend, apparently victims of carbon monoxide poisoning. An understandably distraught Yankovic told reporters, “There’s no song I could change the words to to relate the sadness I feel.”  "Weird Al" Yankovic’s elderly parents were found dead in their home last weekend, apparently victims of carbon monoxide poisoning. A distraught Yankovic is expected to respond with a hilarious new version of the Police’s “Every Breath You Take” later this month.  "Weird Al" Yankovic’s elderly parents were found dead in their home last weekend, apparently victims of carbon monoxide poisoning. An understandably distraught Yankovic told reporters, “This is horrible. The only thing that rhymes with ‘monoxide’ is ‘peroxide’. What’s that?! I got nothing.”  The last one is my favorite, but they're all gold.

       I saw  Ladykillers  over the weekend.  I've been a big Coen brothers fan for years (and still think  Fargo  got robbed of Best Picture...  English Patient ?  Come on...), but given the mixed reviews the film has received, I didn't go in with very high expectations.  And it's alright... some funny moments, good performance by Tom Hanks, nothing too memorable.  What I do appreciate is the fact that the Coens still attempt to make such unique movies in the age of formulas.  One of the trailers before  Ladykillers  was for  urlLink  White Chicks  , an updated and reversed   urlLink Soul Man   in which 2 Wayans brothers (not Damon and not Keenan) dress up as missing white female socialites and none of their socialites' friends notice that they are black men in drag except for occasional comments such as "Don't they seem a little different?"... the trailer didn't get a single laugh and looks horribly offensive and cliched.  With movies like this being made, I'll watch a moderately disappointing  Ladykillers  anyday.

       Well well well, it seems Mr. Raskin, whose book I so highly praised, is a  urlLink fan  of my blog.  The proper grammer and lack of insults in the comment leads to believe one of my friends is playing a joke.  If so, bravo... I laughed my ass off.  If it's true, I'll be on the lookout for him outside the building... he should be easy to spot, since the photo on the book jacket looks just like  urlLink Gerardo  of "Rico Suave" fame.   P.S.

       Couple tidbits I picked up today: - Jessica Simpson said her seventh-grade teacher asked about continents and she answered: "A, E, I, O, U." She's since learned they're not continents. Not even consonants. - The student newspaper at the University of Nebraska at Omaha apologized Friday for its April Fools’ section, which school officials said demeaned African-Americans. The paper, the Gateway, had a wraparound edition titled the Ghettoway, with headlines pen names for writers like Mindjo Bidness and Ono Udidn.

       For some reason a few months ago, tons of copies of the book "Little New York Bastard" by M. Dylan Raskin ("MDR" to friends) showed up scattered around the MTV building.  I took a copy home and promptly forgot about it.  Over the weekend I finally cracked it open, and I must say that it is the WORST book I have ever read.  It escapes me how this book was ever published.  It's nothing but a collection of cliches, whining, and pretentiousness (kind of like this blog).  Here's a sample: "I was looking at her like she was completely out of her head.  She used the words  like  and  whatever  as if they were going out of style..." (pg. 20) Original, huh?  The whole book is like that (at least until the middle of chapter 3, which is where I gave up).  I'm calling for a boycott of this book.  Do not... I repeat, DO NOT buy / read / recommend this book!

       Today was the due date for the latest installment of the mix project with Tommy  urlLink Sticking Point ... topic: Songs with Animals in Their Titles.  Here's my track list, with assorted liner notes:  1.  Hungry Like the Wolf – Duran Duran : Let’s get the most obvious selection out of the way first... 2.  Diamond Dogs - Beck : Not as good as the remake, but I can’t put Bowie on every one of these mixes… or can I? 3.  Mockingbird Girl – Scott Weiland  4.  The Eagle Will Rise Again – Alan Parsons Project  5.  Dog & Butterfly (acoustic) - Heart : I was gonna put “Barracuda” on here, then remembered this song and decided to go less mainstream. 6.  Cows with Guns - Dana Lyons :  urlLink Buzz 103.1  (West Palm Beach’s alternative station) used to play this on the Morning Buzz when I was a junior in high school.  I have no idea why, and I’ve never heard it played anywhere else since, but I downloaded it from Napster when I was in college and held onto it.  It comes in handy here.  The lyrics are really cheesy but kinda clever. 7.  Danger Bird – Neil Young : He played this at the concert I went to a couple weeks ago and inspired me to put it on the mix. 8.  Fever Dog - Stillwater : A fictional song from a fictional band in a fictional movie (based on true events), yet I bet if you played this for someone who had no idea, they would believe it was a real 70’s song.  I have no idea who actually sings it. 9.  Buffalo Stance – Neneh Cherry : My sister was obsessed with this song when we were kids, and I was obsessed with the video, a precursor to the more-famous “Groove is in the Heart.” 10.  Insects – The Kids of Widney High : Yes, I’m a bastard for liking this music because it cracks me up.  But I can’t help it.  Just listen to the lyrics and to the singer’s passion during the bridge. 11.  Froggie – Presidents of the United States of Ame rica: Shortly after this album was released, there was an article in the Sun Sentinel (my local paper) talking about artists’ sophomore slumps and how this album had only sold a fraction of the first one.  I remember getting upset that the article failed to mention that the album had been out only one week.  It ended up not selling much more, and PUSA faded into obscurity.  Thanks,  urlLink Sun Sentinel . 12.  Howard the Duck – The Bangles : The movie was awful.  The theme song includes the line “Hickory, dickory, duck.”  How could I not put it on here? 13.  Surfin’ Bird – The Trashmen : My mom had a Dr. Demento tape with this song and used to play it to amuse me in the car when I was younger.  I guess it worked. 14.  Dark Horse – George Harrison  15.  Sheep Go to Heaven - Cake : Another example of a band that I generally think is awful that puts out one good song (see also Counting Crows, Harvey Danger). 16.  Atomic Dog – George Clinton : This song made Snoop Dogg’s career. 17.  Brass Monkey – Beastie Boys : Supposedly they refuse to sing this one in concert now because it degrades women.  I still like the Beastie Boys, but they used to be much more fun. 18.  Of Wolf and Man – Metallica (w/ San Francisco Orchestra)

       GnR's  Greatest Hits   urlLink entered  the Billboard chart at #3 this week.  Congrats to them.  The success of that album, coupled with the  urlLink press release  Axl issued after cancelling their Rock in Rio appearance, leads me to believe that maybe, just maybe,  Chinese Democracy  will be released.  Interesting that the 2 most famous unreleased albums of all time (that and  Smile ) will probably both be released this year.  Which one will come out first?  My money is on  Smile .  Come on, Brian and Axl, don't let me down.

        Things I learned from Velvet Revolver's concert at Roseland last night:   1) Heroin makes you cut.   Both Scott Weiland and Duff are in such incredible shape... washboard abs, no body fat... maybe I should start shooting up to get me a six-pack.  2) Fuel's popularity was probably imaginary.   I seemed to be the only person who recognized the lead singer, Brett Scallions, standing in the audience (and I only did because I'd seen him perform "It's So Easy" with  urlLink Camp Freddy , another pseduo-GnR band).    3) Matt Pinfield is short.   Really short.  4) "Sex Type Thing" is more popular than any Guns N Roses song.   The crowd went  insane  during this song, more so than for any of the original VR material or for "It's So Easy," "Used to Love Her," or even "Mr. Brownstone."  Very surprising.  5) Scott Weiland is made out of Jello.   I don't know how he contorts his body like that, unless he has no bones.  He really is a human snake.  6) VR's material is pretty damn good.   The band is really tight, they mesh well, and they rock.  The sound at Roseland wasn't great, but from the taste I got (and based on the singles "Set Me Free" and "Slither" that I've heard studio versions of), the album will be good.  I just hope it's successful.  My guess is it'll have a strong debut (Top 3), then plummet very quickly.  But I have my fingers crossed that it'll have longevity.

When she talked to Tom Hanks, she told him that she's seen  Turner and Hooch  at least 50 times... how does Tom Hanks even respond to that?  That's worse than seeing  Joe vs. the Volcano  50 times.  I'd make a joke about finding out which Williams sister is Turner and which one is Hooch, but I'm not that mean.

       Speaking of bad movies, over the weekend I was forced to watch the first 2 Harry Potter movies on DVD and come up with trivia questions and a list of spells for the  TRL  Harry Potter contest.  I don't know about you, but my idea of a fun weekend doesn't include spending 5 hours watching crap (although I managed to cut it down significantly by turning on the subtitles, playing the movie at double speed and simply reading the dialogue).  Anyway, I aimed at making the questions ridiculously hard, even for these supposed Harry Potter junkies, and out of 10 questions, one contestant got 3 right, one got 4, one got 8, and one freak of a girl actually got all 10!  How the hell did she know the license plate number of the Dursley's flying car?  How did she know how many points the dorm that won the House Cup in the 1st movie had?  Damn her.  And yes, it does bother me that I now know all this stuff too.  What a waste of brain space.

       Saw a screening of  Saved!  last night.  It had gotten good buzz, and the previews looked decent, so I went in with a positive attitude.  And yes, while it's better than the recent crap I've had to see ( Raising Helen ,  Soul Plane ), it was somewhat of a letdown.  They give away most of the funny parts in the preview.  It attempts to make Jena Malone's confused teenager a better arguer on Christian faith than her pastor.  They try to make Mandy Moore's ultra-religious character the villian, but it's hard to feel bad for her when there's a scene near the end with her crying and praying to God about what to do so that the audience realizes that she is in fact doing what she thinks is right in the eyes of God.  Not a bad movie, just not particularly good. And while my posts too often argue the merits of the Beach Boys, the film's opening with a terrible cover version of "God Only Knows" by Mandy Moore was a travesty.  Not only did she suck all the feeling out of the song, but she had the audacity to turn it into a sing-a-long ("God only knows what I'd be without you... COME ON EVERYONE!").  I'm tempted to say something to her about it when she comes to  TRL  on Thursday... but I think we can all guess how likely that is.

       Tommy handed me his A-Z mix, which is on 2 discs, in blatent disregard to the rules.  Anyone can make two 13-song mixes... the trick is to fit 26 good tracks onto one.  If you read this Tommy, FOR SHAME!!!

       Track list for the latest CD in my mix project with  urlLink Tommy .  Topic: one CD, 26 tracks, A-Z (either artist or song title), with (very) select liner notes.  1. Idlewild -  A merican English: Put on a mix by my Scottish friend Laurie in my original mix project.  I liked this song so much that I bought their CD.  Sadly, the rest of the album is, as the Scottish say, "shite." 2. Simon & Garfunkel -  B aby Driver 3. Josie  C otten - Johnny Are You Queer? 4. Joy Division -  D igital: I recently watched  24 Hour Party People  and am now obsessed with this song.   5.  E els - Going to Your Funeral, Pt. 1 6. V.A.S.T. -  F ree 7.  G o-Go's - Speeding 8. Colin  H ay - Overkill: I heard this version for the first time on Scrubs, one of Tommy's favorite shows... that's why it made the mix. 9. ZZ Top -  I  Thank You 10.  J ellyfish - Ghost at Number One: Probably the closest any modern band has come to sounding like the Beach Boys. 11.  K inks - Harry Rag 12. Cure -  L ove Song: One of my favorite love songs ever.  So simple yet so effective. 13. They Might Be Giants -  M ammal 14.  N irvana - Territorial Pissings 15. Bob Dylan -  O xford Town 16. Tom  P etty - Apartment Song 17.  Q ueen - Bicycle Race 18. Tommy  R oe - Sweet Pea: If you were to look up " urlLink earworm " in the dictionary, it would list this song's chorus as the example. 19. Marvelous 3 -  S ugarbuzz 20. Blind Melon -  T hree is a Magic Number: This song just missed out on our previous mix topic, Cover Songs, so I'm glad I could put it in here. 21.  U rge - Jump Right In 22.  V an Halen - Beautiful Girls 23. Cat Stevens -  W ind 24. Seconds -  X : This is what Tommy gets when I'm forced to put in a song for X and don't want to use the band X because I'm sure he owns all their albums.	 25. Guns 'N' Roses -  Y ou're Crazy 26.  Z ebrahead - Someday  urlLink (bonus track)  : From a recent episode of South Park.  Butters would tap-dance to this song.  Don't know why it makes me laugh as hard as it does, but it does.

       By the way, last night I saw a screening of  The Day After Tomorrow , and it wasn't that good (I know, is there any movie other than  Napoleon Dynamite  that I have liked recently?  Doesn't seem that way...).  The movie started out alright, and actually one of the coolest part was the credit sequence, which was a long pan across the Arctic Ocean in which the names in the credits created wavy reflections in the water.  The destruction of earth was okay, but ended less than an hour into the film.  The next hour was tediously boring and ridiculously stupid... somehow Dennis Quaid was able to walk from DC to Manhattan in the worst snowstorm ever in a matter of days.  I  urlLink MapQuested  it, and the distance is 226.54 miles.  Not bloody likely, methinks.  Anyway, I'm glad that at least I'm not paying money to see these films.  Next up:  Saved , on Monday.  My first ever Mandy Moore movie.  I'm excited. Oh,  The Day After Tomorrow  had one opportunity to make a joke that would've saved the entire movie and didn't do it.  There are these 3 scientists (don't worry, this isn't a spoiler) who are stranded in a shack in Scotland and they've run out of fuel and have no way of getting out.  One of them says "Don't worry, we have plenty of tea and biscuits... as long as the lew doesn't clog up, we'll be fine."  All 3 laugh uncomfortably, then one by one stop laughing when reality about their imminent death sets in.  There's a moment when the first guy stops laughing where I wish he'd said, "Um, about that..." and there'd be a slow camera pan (with melodramatic music playing in the background) to the toilet, which is clogged.  Oh man, that would've been funny.

       Okay, I had a very random revelation recently.  I think I've figured out the secret to a successful movie aimed at teenage girls: breasts!  It seems so obvious now.  Let's take a look at recent movies:  Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen : Lindsay Lohan with average breasts = average hit  Lizzie McGuire Movie : Hilary Duff with big breasts (for a 15/16-year-old) = big opening weekend  Mean Girls : Lindsay Lohan with huge breasts (especially for a 17-year-old) = huge hit  13 Going on 30 : Jennifer Garner with good-size breasts = successful  Prince & Me : Julia Stiles with fairly small breasts = fairly small gross  New York Minute : Olsen twins with no breasts = bomb So what is it about big breasts that draws teenage girls?  Do they want what they don't have?  Is the audience really filled with horny teenage boys (or sleazy older men)?  Someone should really research this further.

       Congratulations to Randy Johnson for  urlLink pitching  a perfect game last night.  Insane how well he's doing at his age (ditto Clemens).  It's a shame that Randy's career didn't really take off until he was 27.  Another few years in his prime and he could've shattered some records.  I also appreciate the fact that the Atlanta fans gave him such a great ovation after the game.  Way to acknowledge something that's great for the game, even if it wasn't good for your team.  Think Philadelphia fans would've done that?    I also think it's hilarious that Sammy Sosa has to go on the  urlLink DL  due to a strained ligament in his back after sneezing too hard.  His body must be a wreck after taking steroids for so long and then stopping.  He deserves anything bad that happens to him.  Good riddance.

       Saw  Raising Helen  last night and, as expected, it sucked.  It didn't help that I was so friggin' hungry and the movie couldn't go more than 5 minutes without showing some sort of food: brownies, cakes, ham, rack of lamb, pancakes.  There hasn't been as much focus on food in a movie since  Eat Drink Man Woman .  Pure torture.

       Watched VH1’s  urlLink 50 Most Awesomely Bad Songs Ever  over the weekend, and while their list has some merits, they have a few major errors... I will now attempt to adjust the list by swapping out certain songs:  1. “We Built This City” – replace with LFO’s “Summer Girls”    - “Summer Girls” is by far the worst song ever recorded EVER!  Terrible beat, ridiculously amateur lyrics… I once saw an interview with them in which they discussed how everything in the song is true: “New Kids on the Block did have a bunch of hits, and Chinese food does make me sick.”  Yeah, so does this song.  If they were so intent on singing honestly, they should’ve sung about how they are talentless suck-asses.  3. “Everybody Have Fun Tonight” – replace with Kid Rock’s “Bawitdaba”  - The comedians on the show claim that they don’t know what it means to “Wang Chung” (Do they also not know what it means to turn Japanese?  Or to she-bop?)… I don’t know what “Bawitdaba” means, but I can assume it translates into “Kid Rock blows.”  5. “Ice Ice Baby” – replace with Vanilla Ice’s “Play That Funky Music”  - I still own the cassette of To The Extreme, although I haven’t listened to it in at least a decade… but having listened to the whole album at one time, I know that he did much more damage to Wild Cherry than to Queen & David Bowie.  10. “Heart of Rock N Roll” – replace with Justin Timberlake’s “Rosalita”  - Possibly the worst sing-along section in all of recorded music.  It’s bad enough that Justin sings off-key during it, but I think he purposely rounded up the worst group of singers possible to make him sound that much better.  At least N’Sync could harmonize (or at least used computers to do so).  12. “Hangin’ Tough” – replace with New Kid’s “Step by Step”  - All I remember about this song is a horrible rap interlude with lines like “Step 1: We can have lots of fun. Step 2: There’s so much we can do.”  Why I remember that, I don’t know, but it’s embedded into my brain and I’ll never forgive NKOTB for that.  15. “Mmm Mmm Mmm Mmm” – replace with Des’ree’s “You Gotta Be”  - You gotta be kidding me that this song was ever popular.    16. “Final Countdown” – replace with Baha Men’s “Who Let the Dogs Out”  - How “Final Countdown” made the list boggles the mind.  I could wake up every morning to this song and be psyched for the day.  And how did Baha Men not make the list?  No, seriously.  I don’t even need to write anything to justify this, cause I think you all already know how bad that song is.  19. “You’re the Inspiration” – replace with Lynyrd Skynyrd’s “Red White & Blue”  - People claim that Chicago went downhill during the 80s… well, I was never a real Skynyrd fan, but they have an unparalleled plummet if their entire new album is as bad as their patriotic first single, with lyrics such as “My Daddy worked hard, and so have I, paid our taxes and gave our lives to serve this great country, so what are they complaining about?  Yeah we love our families, we love our kids, you know it is love that makes us all so rich.  That's where were at... if they don't like it they can just get the HELL out!”  Flows like butter, eh?  24. “Sussudio” – replace with Madonna’s “American Pie”  - The show pointed out with this song that even a Grammy-winning, hugely-successful singer wasn’t safe from this list.  Using that logic, I point to possibly the worst cover ever recorded.  She turned a poignant, clever homage to great music of the past into a techno train wreck that made me long for the great music of Madonna’s past.  And she had the gall to edit out 4 verses... which, come to think of it, may not have been a bad thing, since it made her version much shorter.  29. “I’d Do Anything for Love” – replace with Celine Dion’s “It’s All Coming Back to Me Now”  - She ripped off the song structure and video, but made it sound much much worse.    32. “Broken Wings” – replace by Geri Halliwell's "Look at Me”  - Her first single after she left The Spice Girls has a bridge section that sounds worse than the entire Spice Girls catalog mashed together and played at once.  I've never changed a channel during the first time I've heard a song faster than I did during that song.  40. “What’s Up” - replace with Ce Ce Peniston’s “Finally”  - One of the first reasons why I hate dance music.  At least the song opened her up to jokes about her name.  50. “Sunglasses at Night” – replace with Third Eye Blind’s “Losing a Whole Year”  - Stephen Jenkins screaming “I remember you and me used to spend the whole goddamn day in bed.”  And I remember when bands used to have talent.  The falsetto voice singing the title during the chorus is the musical equivalent of nails across a chalkboard.

       Okay, I'm officially fed up with the crap that passes for "music" these days.  MTVU plays a video for "Snowflakes" by Just Jack approximately once an hour.  In that song, Just Jack samples the Cure's "Lullaby" and replaces Robert Smith's original lyrics and haunting voice with infantile lyrics that are half-sung/half-rapped by a white thug-wannabe poser.  This sampling nonsense has to stop!  It's not cool or creative; it simply means that artists don't have the talent to write their own melodies.  Jessica Simpson's "I Think I'm in Love with You" did it with "Jack & Diane," 5ive's "Everybody Get Up" did it with "I Love Rock and Roll"... the list goes on and on.  Covers are almost as bad, but at least they admit to their lack of originality and don't try to pass themselves off as something they're not.  Stop ruining good music (not that "Jack & Diane" is good... it was simply an example of sampling I thought of off the top of my head) and write your own songs, you untalented asses!

        EVERYONE SHOULD SEE NAPOLEON DYNAMITE!!!  Saw a screening of  urlLink  Napoleon Dynamite   last night, and I'm making a claim that this is the funniest film of the year... you heard it here first.  The movie has little (if any) plot, but who cares if it's simply a character piece... the writing, acting, pacing, and directing are all top-notch.  For at least the first 20 minutes, I didn't stop laughing or chuckling the entire time.  I'm guessing that when June rolls around, "Heck yeah!" will replace "Don't be stupid, stupid!" as catchphrase of the moment.  Trust me on this one.

       I would've refused to see  urlLink  Raising Helen   based on the trailer, but even before then I knew I'd be boycotting it based solely on the title.  Punny titles are the worst... and normal puns are bad enough ( Beautician and the Beast ), but when they do it with names, argh!  I can just picture the pitch for this... "It's like 'Raising Hell,' which is cool, but the girl's name is Helen, so it's 'Raising Helen'... clever, right?"  Hardly.  What's next, "Walk Like Amanda?"  "Stark Raving Madison?"  "Live or Let Diane?"  Shit, I hope I'm not giving people ideas...

        Things I Learned Watching the  Survivor All-Star  Finale & Reunion:  1)  Even reality shows aren't safe from stunt casting during sweeps.   At some point between the time they left the island to the time they reunited at MSG, Amber was replaced by a liposuctioned  urlLink Trishelle , Boston Rob was replaced by  urlLink A.C. Slater , and Jenna L. was replaced by a less-attractive  urlLink Liz Phair .   2)  Rupert rules!   I loved that when he came back for the first time as a juror, he was still wearing his tie-dye shirt.  Everyone who'd been kicked out before him had cleaned themselves up and changed into fancy clothes, but not Rupert.  I was beginning to wonder if he even owned another shirt until he came out for the final jury wearing a button-down shirt.   3)  Big Tom creates killer catchphrases.   I hope that "Don't be stupid, stupid!"  becomes as big as "Show me the money!" did. 4)  Large groups of people are always retarded.   Who the hell would want to be at MSG to watch this live, let alone  urlLink pay  a scalper $450 for tickets?  The cheering, the booing, the "awwwwwww-ing" was all so grating... it's okay to watch the show, but come on, get a life! 5)  There are exceptions.   The one time I was pleased with the audience was when they booed Jerri so much that she left during the commercial break.  Hilarious!  Her life is just completely ruined.  She could've been singing "The National Anthem" and still gotten booed offstage.   6)  CBS is just as bad as NBC.   Anyone who DVRed (or, if old-school, taped) the finale and not the reunion missed finding out the winner.  It's not that hard to properly schedule programming, or if it was planned that the winner would be revealed during the reunion, tell people about it!   7)  The "shocking twist" was a major let-down.   Viewer's choice award is a cool concept (especially since it will hopefully make Rupert a millionaire), but it's hardly a shocking twist.  Oh, and if CBS is reading, you may want to fix the  urlLink voting link , which doesn't seem to be registering votes at all. Now that the season is over, hopefully I can cut myself off from  Survivor  as I did after the first season ended.

         Simpsons  geek rant:  It's bad enough that the humor has vanished from the show, but now the show isn't even caring enough to properly follow its own history.  Milhouse claimed Homer was his first kiss... has he forgotten about Samantha Stanky?  And Homer claimed he's only kissed one woman is his life, when in fact also he's kissed Mindy Simmons, Lurlene, Amber (his Vegas wife), and even Selma (at least I think it was Selma) during last night's episode!  Come on people, pay attention...

       Fairly disappointed in the  Friends  series finale.  Aside from the utter lack of humor (which has plagued the show all season), it was sappy, predictable, unrealistic, and tried to tie up too many ends.  Given the nosedive the show has taken over the past few years, I'm glad it was finally put to rest.   Simpsons , take note.  Oh, and anyone who DVRed the show and tried to watch it later got screwed out of the last 5 minutes unless they happened to record  ER  as well.  Way to go NBC, which always refuses to start and end its popular programs on the hour / half hour.  On to better television... Hulk Hogan (and his 24-inch "pythons") hosts Classic Jukebox May 16 at 8pm on  urlLink VH1 Classic .  You can bet I'll be watching.

       The Olsen twins are on  TRL  today, and I pushed so hard to do a parody of  The Shining  for our cold open, but unfortunatley all the ignorant  TRL  viewers have probably never heard of, let alone seen,  The Shining .  Therefore, my blog will become the final resting place for this idea:   The Shining  Cold Open  Damien rides through the studio hallways on a tricycle, with the camera following behind him.  As he rounds a corner, he sees the Olsen twins standing hand in hand.    Olsens  (in unison): Hello Damien. Come and play with us.  Come and play with us, Damien.  Forever... and ever... and ever!  Damien  (turning to the camera): Awesome!  TRL starts now.

       There's an article in the  Daily News  today about the cast of  SNL   urlLink cracking up  in a sketch during this weekend's show.  The author claims that cast members laughing rarely happens on  SNL .  What the hell show has he been watching?  Jimmy Fallon cracks up during every sketch he's in... and, surprise surprise, he's the one who started Saturday night's fiasco.  The producers should start keeping a running tally during each show, and then at the end beat Fallon with a paddle for each time he laughs.  He'll be a human Pavlov's dog.  Maybe that'll teach him.

       Well, the  Simpsons  strike has been settled... apparently Fox called the actors' bluff and threatened to shut down production.  No numbers have been released, but  urlLink word  is they got slight raises and no percentage of profits.

        You Heard It Here First  Today, June 29, 2004, is a day that will go down in infamy as the start of the downfall of VH1 Classic.  Next week they are starting a show called "Classic Current" which will feature new videos from classic artists like Sting, Prince, etc., and they are previewing it during today's Tuesday Twoplay.  While this in and of itself is not terrible news, it has opened the floodgates for the channel to play music from terrible 90s bands like the Lemonheads and crappy 90s Aerosmith.  The designation of a classic should be that it came out prior to the previous decade... so the most recent classic should be from the 80s.  Once we hit 2010, songs from the 90s can be classics.  This rule would also prevent the utterly pointless  I Love the 90s  set to air next month (Remember when Britney Spears was wearing a school uniform in a video?  Gee, it was so long ago...).  For shame, VH1 Classic.  What's next, commercials?  Soon you'll be MTV2 all over again (I miss the launch of that channel when they played what was at that time all 19,000 videos ever made in alphabetical order).

        Sunday Subway Story  On a downtown Q train, a gangster-type white guy is trying to pick up an attractive, professional African-American woman.  She obviously is having none of it, but is being nice in her rejection.  He asks her name, and she responds by asking his name.   "Universal," he replies.   "Universal?  That's an unusual name.  Why were you named that?" she asks.   "Because I defy description," he replies.   I think that answer defies logic.  Regardless, she left the train solo.

        Idiot’s Guide to Fantasy Baseball    Tip of the Week:  Make sure that when you’re attempting to acquire a player, you check his first name (or at least first initial).  You don’t want to make the common mistake of picking up outfielder Hideki Matsui when you need Kaz Matsui to fill your hole at shortstop, because you won’t be able to use Hideki at that position.  Similar problems can happen with players with the last name Rodriguez, Jones, and Gonzalez.   Did You Know?  If you’re looking for someone to help you in the walks category, you might want to consider Barry Bonds.  Most people focus on his home runs, but if you check his stats, he’s actually leading the league in walks… by a wide margin!  Chances are he’s not available in the free agent pool, but if he is, I’d pick him up immediately.   Pick to Click:  You may be hesitant to pick up Mark Prior these days.  After all, it’s almost the All-Star break and he only has 1 win.  But the reason that number is so low is that he missed two whole months due to injury.  He’s still an above-average pitcher, so go ahead and roll the dice on him.   Steal of the Week:  Alex Rodriguez.  His numbers are very good (.292 avg., 18 HR, 14 SB), but he also has eligibility at both SS and 3B, two positions that are generally lacking good players.  Grab him if you can.   Hot:  Jim Thome, 1B, Philadelphia.  He’s hitting .320 with 24 HR and 50 RBI.  That’s power.  Scott Rolen, 3B, St. Louis.  He leads baseball with 71 RBI, along with a .336 average and 17 HR.  Would make an excellent pick-up.   Not:  John Flaherty, C, New York Yankees.  Not only is his batting average a lowly .161, but he doesn’t even play every day!  You’d be much better off going with the Yanks’ other catcher, Jorge Posada.  Mo Vaughn, 1B, New York Mets.  Even though the Mets are paying him $15 million in 2004, he has yet to play a game this season.  There are other first basemen who can get you more points, such as Todd Helton.

        Anyone Wonder...  - what  Full House 's  urlLink Dave Coulier  is up to these days?  Here's your  urlLink answer . - if the tiny space between the platform and the subway on the downtown 2/3 section of the Times Square subway station is big enough to fit a grown man's foot?  As a matter of fact, it is, because a guy getting off my subway car managed to stick his foot in it, get his leg sucked into the gap, and toppled over, then panicked when he had trouble removing it.  After some assistance from helpful onlookers, he escaped without injury (I of course didn't help, as I was too busy staring and laughing). - if you're the only one who despises  urlLink Rob Schneider 's film career?  This  urlLink review  of Around  the World in 80 Days  contains the line "Rob Schneider shows up as a San Francisco bum, but I would like to think of that as career foreshadowing."

       Read Rolling Stone's  urlLink 50 Moments That Changed the History of Rock & Roll .  And out of 50 moments (only 21 of which were given actual dates instead of months or seasons), 3 happened on my birthday, August 17: the last day of  urlLink Woodstock , Bruce Springsteen  urlLink playing the Bottom Line  in 1975 (the dates were not stated in the issue but 8/17 was the date of the final gig) and the  urlLink filming  of Nirvana's "Smells Like Teen Spirit" video.  Statistically, there is only a 1 in 7.305 chance of any of them happening on my birthday.  Add those to the list of celebs born on that day (Sean Penn, Robert DeNiro, Davy Crockett, Jim Courier, Belinda Carlisle, Mae West) and that Lou Gehrig played in his record 1,308th consecutive game this day in 1933 and that the Beatles replaced Pete Best with Ringo on this day in 1962, and I think we can all admit that August 17 is the best day EVER!  I feel there were some pretty big omissions in the issue:   - Beatles playing on Ed Sullivan - Blondie recording "Rapture" (rap wouldn't have been as big without it) - The Day the Music Died (killed Richie Valens, Buddy Holly, and The Big Bopper and inspired "American Pie") - The creation of CDs  - Elvis' comeback special (the creative spark of MTV's  Unplugged  or any acoustic jams) - Pink Floyd recording "Dark Side of the Moon" - Alanis Morissette recording "You Oughta Know" (more important than the Lilith Fair) - Wham! performing in China in April 1985 (becoming the first English-speaking pop group to do so)  Then again, that's just me...

       Went to  urlLink amFAR Rocks  last night at Tavern on the Green, and my crazy friend won a silent auction for an autographed picture of Larry Thomas... winning bid: $250.  Who, you ask, is Larry Thomas?  Why he's the Soup Nazi, of course.  Yes, an autographed napkin with a lipstick kiss from Britney Spears went for $300, while my friend paid $250 for a menacing picture of the Soup Nazi with the inscription "No Soup for You!  Larry Thomas, "Soup Nazi."  It's a good thing he's a well-paid investment banker, but it makes me question his investment advice.    Also interesting to note that one of the items auctioned off was a tour for 2 of the MTV studios led by John Norris and seats to a  TRL  taping.  The high bid when I last checked was $375 (the placard claimed the retail value as "priceless").  I was tempted to write down the names and numbers of the losing bidders and offer them the same deal (with me instead of John Norris) for the bargain price of $50, but didn't.  However if any of you are out there, drop me a line...  Finally, the celeb factor was decidedly small (I think because the premiere of  Fahrenheit 9/11  was also last night and drew much bigger names).  Sadly, I think people were most excited to see Carson Kressley (of  Queer Eye  fame).  Do you think that nowadays if someone mentions the name "Carson," he's who comes to mind most often?  It's definitely not Johnny, and I think he may have surpassed Daly at this point.  That's very bothersome to me.

       By the way, the verdict on  Dodgeball  is that it's basically  Happy Gilmore  but with Vince Vaughn instead of Adam Sandler, Ben Stiller instead of Christopher McDonald, it's about dodgeball instead of golf, and it's not nearly as funny (which is sad because I'm not wild about  Happy Gilmore  to begin with).  I wasn't expecting a great movie, but this thing was so predictable, and Ben Stiller was so bad, and it's definitely not the type of humor these guys are good at.  Regardless, I'm sure it'll rake in the dough.

       R.I.P.,  urlLink Ray Charles .  As someone who took piano lessons for 12 years, blind pianists like him and Stevie Wonder never ceased to amaze me.  It's hard enough to play with the music right in front of, let alone without looking at the music, let alone without looking at the keys.  But to compose music without being able to write it down and look back at it boggles the mind.  He sure was talented.

Tragic.  I'd been wondering why she hadn't posted in several months.

Near, far, wherever you are ...  Koolgrrrl, you will be missed.

       Has anyone else noticed that the Snapple  urlLink commercial  titled "The Robot" doesn't make any sense?  The robot kills a female bottle and drinks her Snapple innards, spilling the liquid all over itself in the process, and is fine.  Yet when the police bottles spray it with a water hose, it short-circuits.  Why didn't the female Snapple innards cause it to short-circuit?  If it can survive one, it should be able to survive both.  Tsk tsk, Snapple script supervisors.  P.S.  I love the sound the robot makes when it's drinking the Snapple... "yumyumyum"

       When I was in Long Beach, I heard a report on the radio that Def Leppard will be releasing an album of 70s covers in September.  This cannot be a good idea.  Even though I'm a big fan of the Lep, I've made it clear how much I despise covers.  But it got me thinking... as bad as most of them are, what are some of the absolute worst covers of all time?  - Madonna's "American Pie" - Mandy Moore's "God Only Knows" - Limp Bizkit's "Faith" - Britney Spears' "I Love Rock & Roll" (losing further points because she said in interviews that the original was sung by Pat Benatar) - Guns N Roses' "Sympathy for the Devil" - Billy Idol's "L.A. Woman" - Ataris' "Boys of Summer" - Bloodhoung Gang's "Along Comes Mary" - Orgy's "Blue Monday" - t.A.t.U.'s "How Soon Is Now" - Good Charlotte's "If You Leave" - System of a Down's "The Metro" - Duff sisters' "Our Lips Are Sealed" - Leif Garrett's "Surfin' USA"  I know I've left off tons of them, but I do actually have to get some work done... so this is a start.

       I know that, like the rest of us, David Hasselhoff is trying to cope with the  urlLink break-up  of Creed... but  urlLink drinking  is not the way to handle his grief.    By the way, Sway's annoucement of the break-up on Friday's show would only have been more entertaining had the audio department been able to insert a sound effect of crickets chirping.  You be the judge:  Sway: "So, y'all know Creed, right?" (2 seconds of awkward silence)  or   Sway: "So, y'all know Creed, right?" (1 second of awkward silence, then "chirp chirp")

       Our producer guaranteed that if  urlLink Velvet Revolver's  CD reaches #1 on the Billboard chart, they will be booked to perform on  TRL .

And if you need to be further persuaded, it's  urlLink streaming  on mtv.com, so give a listen, especially "Fall to Pieces" (which is a crossover hit if I ever heard one).

       Yet another thing I wrote for  TRL  that will never see the light of day... this one was for the Wednesday's Live Hit, which was described in the format as "Ashlee Simpson and Amanda Bynes tease each other":   ASHLEE  -WHAT’S UP, I’M ASHLEE SIMPSON   AMANDA  -AND I’M AMANDA BYNES -TODAY WE’RE GONNA BE ON TRL   ASHLEE  -HEY AMANDA, HAVE YOU EVER NOTICED THAT YOU HAVE A LOT OF FRECKLES? -YOU REALLY SHOULD STAY OUT OF THE SUN   AMANDA  -MAYBE I WOULDN’T HAVE THAT PROBLEM  -IF MY NOSE COULD THROW SHADE OVER MY WHOLE BODY LIKE YOURS DOES   ASHLEE  -THAT’S FUNNY -BY THE WAY, I SAW “WHAT A GIRL WANTS” -AND WHAT THIS GIRL WANTS IS FOR YOU TO DROP DEAD   AMANDA  -LOOK, IF JESSICA GOT ALL THE TALENT IN YOUR FAMILY -I’M SURPRISED YOU CAN EVEN PEE WITHOUT FALLING IN THE TOILET   ASHLEE  -AT LEAST I DON’T THINK I’M LINDSAY LOHAN   AMANDA  -AT LEAST CARSON DIDN’T FUCK ME IN THE POO HOLE!   ASHLEE  -ANYWAY, GET THOSE LAST MINUTE VOTES IN   AMANDA  -AND KEEP IT LOCKED -CAUSE TRL STARTS AT 5  I also have to say that Ashlee's performance is one of the worst live performances I've ever heard.  She sounded like a goose... a tone-deaf goose.  Everyone on staff was cringing.  Brilliant television.

       Following up on yesterday's post, I sent this letter out:  Dear Professor Greene, My name is also Brian Greene, although unlike you I am a 24-year-old writer for MTV.  Several times over the past few years I’ve been mistakenly identified as you.  I recently received the enclosed letter, which I can only assume was meant for you.  Although my first reaction was to write a letter expressing my surprise that anyone would have the audacity to question the teachings of someone who shared my name, I instead decided to forward it along to you.   Maybe our paths will actually cross one day.  Until then, I will continue to direct all inquiries meant for you in your direction, and I hope you will return the favor should anyone mistakenly ask you questions about the impact of American Idol on the downfall of popular music. Cheers, Brian Greene

       I recently received a letter in the mail for Dr. Brian Greene, saying how much the sender enjoyed the recent discussion of my new book but that one of my explainations bothered him and to please look over the enclosed pages that are the result of his "kicking it around since then."  So to clear up any confusion: 1) I am not Professor Brian Greene, the Superstring Theorist from Columbia University. 2) If you're going to confuse me with him, do not try to show me up with your hair-brained schemes and theories.  I'm much smarter than you and know much more about physics than you ever will.  When in doubt, remember that I'm right and you're wrong.  P.S.  For more information on my (meaning me, not superstring theorist) dealings with crazy Brian Greene (meaning superstring theorist, not me) fanatics, refer to the entries on March  urlLink 19  &  urlLink 20 .

       Last night I was having dinner with VJ Damien and Sr. Writer Joel at Popeye's  on 49th St.  As we're eating, I notice a man (African-American, probably late-20s, almost certainly not homeless) at another table, with no food in front of him, asleep ... and I mean deep sleep, with drool dripping from his lip to his t-shirt.  A Popeye's janitor approaches the table and starts banging on it, yelling "No sleep!" but the guy doesn't stir.  After about 20 seconds, the guy finally wakes up.  "Get out!  No sleep!" the janitor continues.  The sleepy man looks outside, sees that it's pouring, and doesn't get up.  Another, slightly older customer sitting a few seats away starts yelling at the janitor, "If the man wants to sleep, let him sleep!"  The janitor eventually walks away, at which point the older man joins the sleepy guy at his table.  "He can't tell you not to sleep if you want to sleep," he reassures sleepy guy.   At which point Damien chimes in, "I'm sure the janitor's just jealous... he probably wants to sleep. too."  The older man says, "Nah, he's just jealous because he ain't got a good education and a good job.  That's why he's jealous."  At which point I laughed so hard I almost shot mashed potatoes out of my nose.  P.S.  As we're leaving, Damien is asked to pose in a photo with two teenage girls.  While waiting for their mom to shoot the photo, one of them asks Damien, "So you're just here eating Popeye's?"  He replies, "Yup.  It looks like we've got something in common... we both like great deals on chicken!"

        It's Over... Elapsed Time: 12 Days, 5 Hours  My Duff crush has officially crashed and burned.  Last night I was reading her  urlLink concert review  in the New York Times, which concluded with this line:  She's so relentlessly positive that when she delivered the Who's "My Generation" as a final encore, she altered a crucial line to sing, "Hope I don't die before I get old."  Disgusting!

       I was at Pioneer ( the  place to buy beer in Manhattan) when I noticed a six-pack of He'Brew: The Chosen Beer - Messiah Bold.  Could this be a joke?  A trip to the  urlLink website  does little to answer the question... however, next time I shop there, I'll be sure to buy some (I would've gotten it last night, but PBR was on sale).

        I'm Excused Because I'm White... Very White  Conversation among me, our senior writer Joel, and VJ's Damien and Vanessa, regarding today's surprise guests, Terror Squad: Me - So I just wanna make sure... the other members are Remy, Big Pun, Geddy, and Tony Sunshine, right? Joel - Um, Big Pun's dead. Damien - Yeah, he's dead. Me - He is? Vanessa - Yeah, Big Pun's dead. Joel - You didn't know that? Me - How would I know that?  Look at me! Damien - The only reason that I'm not more upset with you is because you're wearing that shirt.* (The three of them laugh as I slink out of the room)   *Editor's note:  The shirt is a long-sleeved collared Penn shirt that has been cut to 3/4 sleeves because the shirt had shrunk and made the cuffs too tight on my wrists.  I know it's ugly, but it's comfortable...

        Sports Events That Bothered Me This Weekend   1) The Yankees / Red Sox brawl on Saturday.   Jason Varitek is a pussy for not having the guts to take off his catcher's mask during the fight.  Schilling is a douche for saying that A-rod started the fight when Varitek through the first punch.  The Red Sox are pansies for beaning A-rod and blaming the Yankees for initiating the brawl, and for celebrating after that win which put them 8 1/2 games out of first.  The Yankees will look back on this game and laugh when the Red Sox are sitting at home in October.  2) Rob Dibble on Saturday's  Baseball Tonight .   He applauded the fight, saying that the first game was "flat" (an 8-7 come-from-behind victory is flat?) and that fighting is good for the game because it gets players fired up.  Um, no, it causes injuries (see Varitek, Sturtze), slows down the game, and causes players to lose focus.  Rob, stop encouraging fights and stop talking out of your ass.  3) Ricky Williams retiring.   Thanks for screwing the Dolphins, not just for this year but probably for years to come.  You couldn't have announced your plans at the beginning of the week so the team could've gone after Eddie George or even Antwoine Smith?  What a selfish prick.  You're lucky you shaved off your dreads, otherwise people in Florida would've strung you up by them.  Go travel the world and never come back.  4) Lance Armstrong's 6th consecutive win.   Am I the only one who thinks this gets less exciting every year?  It's not even competitive anymore.  Anyone who didn't expect him to win is a liar or a moron.  Even the Bulls took a couple years off in the middle of their 6 titles to get fans excited about other teams and build drama about whether the Bulls could reclaim the title.  You have nothing else to prove... please stop now and give someone else a chance.

       Saw  Metallica: Some Kind of Monster  over the weekend.&nbsp; It's a very well-made documentary, if a little on the long side (almost 2 1/2 hours), and I recommend to everyone, whether or not you're a Metallica fan, if only to see how badly Kirk Hammett is such the little bitch of the band.&nbsp; James Hetfield and Lars Ulrich constantly talk about how the two of them are the entire creative force behind the band, never giving any credit whatsoever to Kirk.&nbsp; Even in the therapy sessions, Kirk never contributes anything of consequence... he merely responds to the arguments between everyone else by shaking his head or laughing awkwardly.&nbsp; I don't really feel bad for the guy... he is worth tens of millions of dollars as part of one of the biggest band in history, but really... it's pretty sad (or funny, depending on how you look at it).

       So as much as I hate to admit it, I now have a crush on Hilary Duff. "But Brian," you may say, "she's only 16!  And her movies are terrible!  And her music is even worse!  And she's about as smart as a bowl of oatmeal!" Yes, these are all valid points.  But she came on the show yesterday, walking in and looking all adorable, and laughed at the jokes I suggested for her when prepping her, and cursed a few times to show that she's not as goody-goody as her image suggested, and told our audience that she's single, and all of a sudden... BAM!  Crush.   I know it sucks and makes me a loser, but I can't help it.  Sigh.

       Went to Prince's Afterparty at B.B. King's last night... got there just before 1am, and the place was packed.  Prince and the band were in a roped-off VIP section, and one of the worst DJs I've ever heard was spinning on stage.  Sometime after 2:30 they started showing footage from that night's concert (which I heard had The Time as an opening act), and Prince, his bandmates, and Sheila E. (who also made a surprise appearance during the concert) took turns waving to the crowd.  No performance, however, and I left when the crowd started booing the DJ and chanting "We want Prince" after Prince had left. One surprise... the crowd went CRAZY when the DJ played Wham's "Everything She Wants," cheering louder than the previous song, Prince's "Take Me With U."  Never would've expected that to happen at a Prince party.

        Quick Thoughts on the Emmy Nominations :  - I like John Ritter as much as the next guy, but his posthumous nomination is not deserved at all and bumped out Jason Bateman.  - In the same category, Larry David can't act at all... and he's nominated while Cheryl Hines isn't? Bah.  - Why does  Will and Grace  (and Sean Hayes) get so many nominations? The show (and he) is terrible! Bump it for  Scrubs ... or  South Park .  - Congrats to Brad Dourif for  Deadwood . I hope he wins.

        Prince 7/13 MSG Concert Review  Last night's concert was at once one of the best and most frustrating concerts I've ever attended.  As far as the actual show, it was incredible.  Prince is an amazing performer, his band was tight (especially drummer  urlLink John Blackwell , who was one of the best I've ever seen, and Maceo Parker on sax), and the energy was unfaltering for more than 2 1/2 hours.  He played almost all of his hits and a wide array of lesser-known songs from his "Vault."  He was in a great mood and joked a lot with the crowd, who went absolutely NUTS for him.  I've never heard it so loud before... at one point Prince got all 20,000 people to jump at the same time, and lemme tell you, the place SHOOK.  The downside to the show was that in order to get through so many hits, he only played about 10% of the songs in their entirety.  Instead we got 2 verses of "Let's Go Crazy," 1 verse (no chorus) of "When Doves Cry," 2 verses of "7," etc.  And while I know playing songs to completion would've shortened the setlist considerably, a lot of the show ended up being one big tease.  Nevertheless, it was a terrific concert, and I'm going to tonight's Afterparty at B.B. King's on the off-chance that he performs.  Chances are I'll stay there until 3am and be S.O.O.L., but we'll see...  Here's an almost-complete setlist, pulled from prince.org: Musicology  Let's Go Crazy  I Would Die 4 U  When Doves Cry  Baby I'm A Star  Shhh  D.M.S.R./Crazy in Love  I Feel 4 U  A Love Bizarre (full version with singing)  Controversy  Georgia on My Mind (Maceo lead vocals)  Acoustic set  -Little Red Corvette  -Cream  -ICNTTPOYM  -Telemarketer Blues  -On the Couch  -Sweet Thing  -ADORE 7  Sign O' The Times  Bambi  Whole Lotta Love  Let's Work  U Got The Look  Life O' The Party  Knock On Wood (Chance lead vocals)  Kiss  Take Me With U  (Encore)  Call My Name  Purple Rain

        Why Old People Suck, Reason #413  I was standing on 75th St. waiting for a broker to show me an apartment, when across the street I see a guy walking a black lab.  He is talking on his cell phone with one hand, and the other hand is covered with a plastic bag to dispose of the dog shit.  The dog does its business, but the guy is still talking on his phone and doesn't it up immediately (although he is standing right next to it).  An old woman comes out of her apartment building, sees the shit, and yells at the guy "You need to pick that up."   The guy responds, "I will, I just need to finish this call." "Pick up the dog's business!" the woman says right back. "As soon as I'm off the phone," the guy replies, more tersely. "You have to pick that up!" she says again. The guy tells the person on the line that he'll call back, then starts explaining to the woman that he was planning to, but he was on the phone and didn't want to risk dropping the phone into the shit. "But you have to pick up after your dog," the woman says.  "It's the law!" "Why couldn't it wait until I was off the phone?" the guy asks. "Because you have to pick up after your dog!" she answers. "You know what?  Screw you, lady!" the guy says.  "Why don't you pick up the shit yourself!"  He then storms away, leaving the shit on the sidewalk.  The woman stands staring at the shit for several moments, then storms back inside.

Me:  Eric Douglas's apartment is available now...  Him:  I don't know who that is.  Where is the apt?  How much?  Me:  Um, that's Michael Douglas's brother who was just found dead of an overdose there yesterday... it's 10 W 29th St., but probably out of your price range.  And this joke isn't funny having to explain it to you.  Him:  great location though

       Pamela Anderson was on the show yesterday to promote her new book,   urlLink Star  .  We did a Madlibs-style stunt with her, and when asked for a noun, she said "penis."

At which point I had the following exchange with Kelly Clarkson:  Me:  We've reached our "penis" quota for the day... so if you wouldn't mind toning it down a bit, just make sure not to say "penis" too many times when you're out there, that would be great."  Kelly:  Oh yeah, like I'm gonna go out there and be like, "I love  American Idol !  And I love ass!"

       At least until  South Park  and  Arrested Development  return with new episodes, the funniest show on television is  Da Ali G. Show .  Sunday's show featured Borat singing a song "Throw the Jews Down the Well," and I can't remember laughing that hard in a long time (my rooommate actually laughed so hard he was rolling around on the floor).  Unfortunately HBO didn't post that clip on their  urlLink site , but there are some great clips up.  P.S.  Speaking of  Arrested Development , the New York Times had a great  urlLink profile  of the show's creator, Mitchell Hurwitz, in the Arts & Leisure section over the weekend.  The previews they gave for next season sound hilarious, especially the idea of having David Cross' character cast as an understudy in Blue Man Group, forcing him to sit by the phone every afternoon in blue make-up in case he's called in.  Genius!
