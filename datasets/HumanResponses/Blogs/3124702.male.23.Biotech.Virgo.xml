      Hah! A full on day of relaxation! The most callenging thing that occured the whole time was a few games of pool. Not bad at all.

      Well, Maira is ill and asleep in bed, so I'm just sitting here at the 'puter improving my website a little and not getting on with my work..  Speaking of which, I have quite a bit to do! Currently I have 3 or 4 Bioinformatics apps under development for my course. They should start arriving on the site soon. :) Plus I have about 4 essays to do before the end of april. Still, there's over a week of holidays left if I get my arse into gear a bit more. The holiday has been going well apart from the slow dealing with the workload - I've had a chance to see some people for the first time in a while, my brother is behaving himself, and all in all everyone seems quite happy.  Huzzah! Just added a few new pages to the website. I'm hoping to get it all over to running on CGI at some point, as soon as I have enough time and reasons to do so. As it stands at the moment though, there's still a lot of content to be done, but I'm happy with how it's coming along. One thing that occured to me today which I fancy doing is writing a 'British Tea HowTo' to accompany the excellent  urlLink 'Russian Tea HowTo' . Partly because it would be fun, and give me a chance to tell the world about Caytie's Perfect Tea Drinking Temperature Theory. But also because it's not like I have much else to contribute to the LDP! ;P  Right, that's it. I'm off to bed.  Oh, and the title was just filled in by the IE form manager in case you were wondering. (blame it on lack of inspiration.)

      Ok, so I've decided to start a new blog. Afresh, as it were. There's a couple of reasons for this I suppose. Firstly,  urlLink my livejournal  pay account ran out and I'm too poor to pay up just to tidy it up, so I sort of abandoned it a while ago. Still, the idea and reasons I had behind starting a blog in the first place still hold true so.. hell, why not?  Hey, plus thanks to Dan Debertin (the sysadmin here) I have a place to keep it which is a lot nicer an easier for me than the old livejournal server, and encourages me to put more work in on my site.  umm.. am I justified yet?? :P

      15.30: Just arrived in Sheffield. The plan is, of course, to get a load of work done. But I think that will be left to tomorrow as it such a lovely day! (although apparently tomorrow will be even better. damn.)  The good news is that I did finally finish the translator CGI, and it will be up tomorrow.

      Been having a shower fitted all day, so the power has kept coming on and off whilst I've been trying to get my work done. grrr..  And, even more grrr..., I'd finished my translator CGI, and when testing it, found that my regex hates me and refuses to work! back to the drawing board for that one. The point is though, that I could just google the answer, it must have been done hundreds of times before, but instead I'm going to sit here for a whole sunday afternoon wrestling with the twisted logic of the little beggar, well at least I have a good distraction for when it all gets too much - TUMIKI Fighters!! Cheers to Tycho and Marach for pointing  urlLink  this  one out. Side scrolling arcade shooter hyper addictive extravaganza. nice.

      Just arrived back in Doncaster about an hour and a half ago, and I'm off to work at the chace in a little while. Not stopping to do the quiz tonight though, gonna get back and finish/post some more bioinf. apps on the site. Also, I want to do some research into producing some software for  urlLink Blissymbolics  as soon as I have time. Read about it, it's a great idea.  Better get ready for work... :D

      Excitement is the name of today, oh yes.  I have been sitting here at the old desk in Casa de Connelly for most of the morning. So far I have achieved remarkably little,what with my attempts to revise for my exam being bogged down with:  1) Messaging 2) Reading Slashdot 3) Blogging 4) Reading Slashdot 5) Playing  urlLink Nasty Psychology tricks  on Ronak  ...and so on. The Good Thing about today so far though has been that, to the best of my knowledge, nobody else has managed to get much revision done either, which makes me feel a little less slack. Although I have just remembered that it is a  public holiday (one of the few we get in this country) and I suppose that if there were going to be a day when I didn't do a lot, this may as well be it. On the other hand, I'm off to work at the chace in a bit, and it (annoyingly) hasn't started raining. This means that all the customers will be trying there best to move all the glasses in the pub into the beer garden. grr...

      Okay there is a nice gap here of about 19 days. Pretty much everything that hapened here involved these steps (delete as applicable):  1) Going to Sheffield for My Course 2) Going to [lectures/The Library/Mairas] 3) Going to [Rollers/NMB/The Albanian Death-Burger Van/Some other Place] for [Breakfast/Lunch/Dinner] 4) Going to the [Graudate/Red Lion/Globe/Brown Bear/Forum/HaHa/Some other place] to meet [Natassa/Sofia/Maira/Sateesh/Jay/Miguel/Xhrstos/Somebody else]. 5) Coming back to Doncaster to work at the Chace.  Just pick some or all of the above with a healthy mix of options nineteen times and that's it. exactly what probably happened.

      I hate it when I do this. Something important occurs to me at an inappropriate time and I think  'oh yeah. I'd better not forget that!'  Well, I forgot to remember that the SWISSMODEL server isn't exactly swift at processing queries.. I had 5 hours to finish an assignment, and I've spent four waiting for the results (which still aren't here).  Fan-fucking-tastic.

      Working hard doin' answers to past paper questions with miguel. Suddenly, he reliably informs me that he 'had a funny thought the other day..'  if we were to produce some software together and try and use our names for the title (matt Connelly and Miguel Camacho) the options are below:  1: MAMI - Spanish for 'Mum' - very gay. 2: MIMA - Spanish for 'to care for, and treat with love' - very gay. 3: CACO - Spanish Slang for a thief - hmm.. bit better. 4: COCA - Spanish Slang for Cocaine - hmm.. probably not the best choice for our academic career. :P

      Bah! 'Tis still raining like a bleeding monsoon outside! Which is a pity 'os I've jst had a very summery meal - salmon and new potatoes with strawberries and cream for desert. lovely.  No Chace for me tonight, I have two weeks off because of the old exam business. This means the dog is pretty confused as she normally expects to go for a ride in the car on sundays (which she loves).    Not this time you poor miserable pooch. MUHAHaha!!!

      All is well. Been reading slashdot and working on my structure prediction coursework. Got a bioinformatics exam about it on tuesday. Strange though..  can't seem to get concerned about this exam. well, not in the usual sort of way at all.  Nevertheless it all seems to be coming along well enough.
