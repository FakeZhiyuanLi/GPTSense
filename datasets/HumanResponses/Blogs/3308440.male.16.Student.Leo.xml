      Ahh finally the weekend a time for relaxing but i will do that later, today has been pretty fun there has been a very relaxed atmosphere in lessons today.  Physics was fun having a water fight (again) while using a big electric thingy... hmm not really a good idea now was it meh nevermind of course i had to use the big electric thing (it's like one of thosse things which make your hair go up)   so I am holding on to it while evryone was touching me...  ;) causing me to get electric shocks and then playing cards in our german lesson instead of revising was a good idea.  ah well a relaxed day comes to an end.  See ya  Dan :)  Current mood: Happy but thirsty  Current music: Linkin Park - In the end

      Wow today has been really weird it has been a fun day but I am actually very tired but I have done nothing at all, all day there has been the potent smell of eggs around school (probably because so many people brought eggs in for someone) luckily I did not get caught in any of the crossfire and I do not believe I am going to say this but biology was fun...   Yes fun?!? Well I suppose it was better than the rest of the day because there was a bit of a water fight going on nothing to big but it helped pass the time on.  That was the fun part of the day the bad part is I am really tired from doing nothing ah well...  Just a question why does a person I thought I was a good friends with seem to ignore me and pretends I am not there???  Hmmm maybe I should say something instead of waiting for her to...

      Today is the start of an era after long debates with myself I finally decided to make my first blog.  unfortunately there will be no pictures for a bit... Well until I get a digital camera but that shouldn't be long.  Anyway a bit about me I am a male student from England just about to start my G.C.S.E's (so I suppose in a perfect world I should be revising instead of doing this but still this ain't a perfect world now is it...)I am into rock music and anything that the radio decides to churn out, if I think there is anymore information needing adding about me I will add it.  I hope to add at least one post a day or if I have the time I will add more but we will see.   Current mood:  Chilled Current music: Coldplay

      Hello all,  Yes I am back after my little rest and now I am feeling happy and relaxed, all my exams have finished, I have a job, and the blog can be found by google... wooo hooo  Well I am happy I have a job, it should keep me entertained for a few weeks anyway.   Try and guess where I am working...  shop? ...bank? ...anything to do with something where I get paid or work long hours?   Nope.  I am working at school teaching younger kids electronics and helping them with the coursework I finished this year I aint getting paid but working about 6 hours a fortnight anit that bad now is it?  If you live in England did you notice the flags hanging out of the windows of peoples houses and flying on peoples cars? and did you also notice when England lost the first game they all disappeared then England won the next two matches but they still disappeared in between? why not just leave them up? Ah well they are out now and all the hype is over for another two years...  Just to say I am not fully English I am a quarter Irish as well so sometimes there may be a change of perspective between they are out and we are out so it all depends what mood I am in at the time.  Just one more paragraph that is football related I promise... I want to ask anyone who reads my blog and who is not from England do people in  your  country smash up  their own  pubs and shops just because their team lost a sports match?  Ah that’s about it now normal service will be resumed from now on.  See Ya  Dan :)  Current mood: Relaxed  Current music: Wierd Al Yankovic - Amish paradise

      Hey all,  Well the past couple of days have been fun and a laugh firstly yesterday I went shopping for an Mp3 player or a mini disc player, I didn't realise they cost so much but I finally settled on a couple of albums being:  Train - Drops of Jupiter Lost Prophets - The fake sound of progress   Then there was today firstly I had to go to work so I met up with Oaky and we both headed off to work, and when I had finished that it was about 11:20am so we decided to go up Perry's house (which Craig and Jamie were already at "jamming") so after a rendition of a R.H.C.P song we decided to recruit Darrell and a PS2 controller (we didn't need the controller in the end) so with six people there we decided to do what most people would do...  Yeah you got it, have a tournament on Fifa 2004 (well what else did you think we were going to do...?) so after the best part of 4 hours, two pizzas and a lot of shouting, screaming and laughing later we had a winner... ME ...yay?  What did we do after that well, we recruited Sam and played football in real life and that's about it for today so far.  So see ya...

      Hey all,  Well you probally have noticed they layout of the blog has changed a couple of times over the past week mainly because I didn't like the way it was begining to look and I had other ideas such as putting Babelfish on my blog so it can be viewed in other languages but it seemed not to work and it also seemed out of place.  Well that's that done...  Today has been fairly fun... from what I can remember of it I went to work and did an extra lesson helping and then went back home, I have been tired today it's my fault really staying up late a couple of days ago and then last night going sleep to be woken up by my phone going off, which after that I struggled to get back sleep, so I think the rest of the night holds rest for me ready for work again tommorrow.

        Hey all,  Well the past couple of days have been fun especially yesterday where I went on a bike ride with Perry, Oaky, Sam and Craig we did about 25 miles (give or take) I worked out it took us about 5 hours (give or take) which I suppose is not bad especially for me who hadn't been on a bike for about 3-4 years before so I am pretty happy about that. Of course I am still aching my knee the most but  meh  nevermind.  Today I have not really done much apart from rest and appaently tommorrow is my birthday (already?) yes I will finally be 16 (yay?) it kind of sucks being one of the youngest in the school year nevermind though, well thats about it for now...

      Hey all,  Well today has just been one of those days, first off I had to go for my job interview, which I think went O.K. they said that they will get in contact with me about the job if the two other people who applied before me do not like it...  So that was interesting and later on I had to go to school to get my timetable for the start of September, when I got it I had half of my lessons missing from it, damn lack of communication between the college and the school... ahh well at least they have put me in for a subject I did not enrole for it's a course called  "Critical thinkin"... as soon as this got described I thought "oh great it's another English course!" well I was not that far off what it is, is looking at some text and describing it!?!? I suppose I shouldn't complain really because it is an examinable course so I now have the possibility of gaining 4 A (S) level's (I have no idea what A levels and AS levels I am in for but hey ho) that’s about it for now, see ya  Dan :)  Current mood: Tired  Current music: Coolio - Gangsta's paradise

      Hey all,  Well today has been a bit of a waste really mainly because of the weather being atrocious it has hardly stopped raining apart from a bit now but never mind, there is supposed to be a lighting storm comig soon so I may record a bit on my camera if it gets good.  Tommorrow I am off up Barrys house for a bit so that should fun, dunno what we will be doing though...  Oh and if any of you want to go to a cool message board thing click here... as far as I know it is a newly started up one so it's a bit empty at the moment, it ain't hosted by me but it seems to be picking up a bit of steam now so go and register aslong as you are polite I imagine the owner would be happy for you to stay...  Well thats my bit of advertising done for today, thats about it for now.  See ya  Dan :)   Current mood: Relaxed  Current music: Nickelback - Breathe

      Hey all,  The last few days have gone ok really, I have mainly been job hunting seen as the orginal job I applied for seems to be well taken so I now have an application form for FOCUS so I will have to get that filled in and set off, the only slight downsides to this job are:  1) It's about a mile walk from home 2) I do not know how much I would get paid 3) I work  all  weekend 4) If I get the job it may stop a mate getting one at the same place...  Thats about it for now,  See Ya  Dan :)   Current mood: Relaxed  Current music: Oasis - Stop crying your heart out
