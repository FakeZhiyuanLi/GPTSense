      I have probably gotten ahead of myself (as I tend to do)...But I figure I will start this blog now in hopes by the time I start using it more actively and people actually look at the darn thing I'll know a little more about what the hell I'm doing.  Plus, All my talk seems to be coming to true fruition and I am just too excited about it!  I still have no clue what exactly I am going to be doing or where exactly I will be living in London come January 2005, but I am doing it!  Hopefully, with the guidance of my recruiter, English friends and new friends I meet along the way I will have a successful adventure......

I hope to get this all set up in the next couple weeks with pics and a little more flair!
Tata for now!

      I am very fortunate to have a good friend who also happens to be from the UK and is always open to chatting about where I should live, what I should expect, and so forth....I talked over London a bit more to him and after he heard about my slight distaste for New York City he said London would likely not be the place for me.  It's not that I do not like New York but after a couple days I'm ready to get out!  So after discussing some pros and cons on places to live, accommodation costs, and doing some internet searches...I am now looking toward the Midlands.  My friend specifically recommended Derby for a few reasons....After looking at numerous websites and comparing it to other areas, I think it may be a great fit for me.  The county also partially represents the first National Park in England and appears to be filled with beautiful natural escapes....
Meanwhile, I have emailed my recruiter twice in the last week and have not heard back yet.  I should assume that he is swamped but I am too excited by now to be patient!  I mean really, I started this blog a whole six months before I even leave!  I've been collecting documents and am now preparing to write my personal statement for my qualification (among the 73 hours that I am working this week in order to save money for this move!).
So, no more procrastination, it's time to get busy!

      I spoke with a former acquaintance today who I was reminded studied in England for her final MSW practicum...I called her hoping to get some insight on completing the GSCC application; instead she left me with some more questions.  Do I want to live in London or is there another location in England that is better suited to my tastes?...that is the question of the hour!  I attempted to find something on the internet that may guide me on the best town/city to live.  But, although the internet may have everything, it is not always easy to find.  I've resolved at this moment that an outer borough will suit just fine.

      Finally! Eureka!!! I received the General Social Care Council Application when I returned home from my second job last night at 8:30pm. I suppose I should have expected detail, but I did not expect to have to write a personal statement!  The way the guide is written compared to the example is pretty confusing!  Now I have to find the time between job 1 and job 2 to get it completed and sent out.  Man, am I tired!

      My mother and I saw Fahrenheit 9/11 last night.  It left me feeling angry, sad and very drained.  I try to keep in mind, although Michael Moore criticizes the media for their hesitancy to portray the truth, he too is another form of media portraying his truth and ideas through the film medium.  However, I agree with his viewpoints and some of the footage in his film just increases my animosity toward George Bush.  I suppose in some ways I am not moving toward much better in that I am moving to a country with a prime minister that many parallel to George Bush.  But I will be moving to a country in which the media appears to some extent to be more aware of the truth....there is at least a greater world view.  One part of the film that really got my blood boiling was when a woman who had lost her son in Iraq was disrespected by what appeared to me an upper-class white woman who probably has had little to do with anyone with significant differences from herself.  For this woman to make statements that disregard the extreme significance of this young man's death, is what I view as the over all ignorance of America.  She told this mother to blame it on AL-Qaida, expanding upon her ignorance regarding what the war in Iraq is really about.  I understand that 9/11 was a horrible tragedy and it often brings tears to my eyes when it was discussed.  But, do Americans realize this has been happening to countries and cultures for years? Do you realize that entire cities have been destroyed in Iraq to meet the government's financial gain, at the cost of young men and women's lives lost for no good purpose....I could rant forever so I'll stop there for now.  I think I am going to like this blog. It's a great opportunity to vent! :-)  Tata for now! Lis

      I spoke with Richard today and I have secured an interview on August 31st in Chicago! If I get the position, which I will know by the end of that week following the interview, I will likely leave for Dudley at the end of November.  At this very moment, I am approaching the end of my 13 hour work day so I am feeling too tired to put into words the excitement that I felt this morning.  I had so much to do at work but I could barely concentrate on anything but my potential future in England.  I've spent the evening at my part-time job (given that there was no kids here tonight)hunting the internet for more info on Dudley and the area....of course I ended up looking at sites about pubs in the area. You know my priorities are straight.  Now I need to start preparing for my interview and reading the lovely dry materials regarding social work policy in the UK. woo hoo!

      I went to campus today to speak with the professor that assists students with international placements and she was not there!! Of course, I was fifteen minutes late because I blew off a little too much steam last night with a few too many rum and diets, but still!  Oh well, I'll just go with what I have and hopefully it will work.  Perhaps I'll email her my statement for a critique....I don't think I could handle being on the campus again! It was so strange to be walking around my old school; I feel so removed from those days... On the exciting note, I received a phone call and an email about setting up an interview in Chicago to work in the UK! If I get this job I will be gone in 3 months!!!  I am so ready.  I do hate to leave before the holidays and with my two new clients here that have so many needs, but as my wise mother and brother say, you gotta do what you gotta do.  Bri is a great brother to have on hand because he has done all of this and has a lot of good insight into the logistics and the overall plan.  
Hopefully tomorrow I will be writing an entry about my interview!

      There seems to be little consistency in this dream/plan of mine to move to the UK, except for the fact that I know  it will  happen.  One of my closest friends (and trusted advisor) continues to send me opportunities to interview for UK jobs in Chicago.  There are interviews set for Aug.30 and 31 and I have now sent my application and requested an interview.  This means should I actually be offered the position, I would begin working in Dudley, England on November 22! I suppose it is only two months early from my original plan to go in January...but missing the holidays makes me a little nervous!  Maybe I'll find some English friends in three days that would want me to cook them an American Thanksgiving feast.  I  still  have not finished my personal statement and I am meeting with a former professor Thursday for her tips so I need to get it done! I have a real deadline now.  But, of course, I am also behind in progress notes and other paperwork because I have been so insanely busy with my old kids (clients) getting into new trouble and my new kids with all of their intensive needs.  I'll get caught up one of these days! At least I quit working weekends and can have some time to breathe a little once again.
Okay, BACK TO WORK!!!!

      I just returned this morning from a ten day vacation with my friend Cammie in Florida.  I had a great time and now am back in Indiana and already feeling the pressure of all that I need to get done.  I began working with a new client right before I left and have another client I am supposed to contact and start working with tommorrow!  On top of that I still have not written my personal statement to send with my registration application to practice in the UK, I have a pile of bills to pay and I have to continue to work 60-70 hours a week among my 2-3 jobs.  Really, I am just wasting time whining when I should be doing something about all my obligations. ....
But a bit more about my vacation: Cammie and I had a fun time in New Smryna, spending it mostly at the beach and socializing with my aunt and her friends.  We then, via other family visits, worked our way to Steinhatchee for scalloping in the gulf.  It was great to have Cammie there in Steinhatchee! I had never taken any of my friends to the small little fishing town and she fit in great (like I knew she would).  The trip was somewhat stressful due to our tight living quarters which included my brother, his wife and two kids, my aunt and uncle and two friends, Cammie and another family friend, my parents and my aunt, her boyfriend and son.  Although most of the family can get a little moody (including myself), especially when our strong personality traits get placed so close together, we survived it and overall had a wonderful time.  Coming back this morning, I felt like I had little to look forward too.  Aside from all my whining above, I feel like there is little I am coming home to.  My parents are still down south and are headed home, Cammie was with me, and aside from that I do not feel a strong connection to this community any more.  Yes, I still have Julia, one of my closest friends and many other very good friends here in Indianapolis, but I do not have anything to really look to for myself.  It affirms for me that it is time for me to leave Indy and try somewhere new.  There is a lot to me that I feel I may begin to lose if I stay in Indiana.  My sense of adventure and love of the outdoors for one. ...I've gotten myself into a rut in the last couple years where I do not get outside to hike, kayak, etc. and I have the same routine going to the same bars and talking to the same drunken assholes every week.  I'm ready to try other bars and other drunken assholes. :-)  But seriously, I feel like the majority of my friends are settling into their future and I still don't know what that is for me yet.  I am so ready to come to the UK and see what adventures may be had there! Plus, now all my family knows I am planning on going so I'm commited.
Well, I feel as though I am rambling and I need to get on with my personal statement.  I hope to truly have it completed and ready to send by the end of next week! tata for now!
