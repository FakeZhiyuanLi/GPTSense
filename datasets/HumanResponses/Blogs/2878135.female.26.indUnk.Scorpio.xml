      OK, this is going to be rather uninteresting, as there is very little I want to say on the web. That being said, I will occasionally be posting here anyway, because everyone else has a blog and I just have this irresistible urge to succumb to conformity with little to no resistance.  So there you have it. This is my conformist blog. Enjoy.

      Yay! I just set up my new email account with Google! Gmail is coooool. So now I have one more account that I don't really need. I guess I can keep using my Yahoo account for filling out online forms and junk, and maybe I'll use gmail for slightly more important stuff, but not as important as my Hotmail stuff (the most important). If anyone reading this does not have any of my email addresses, TOO BAD. If I wanted you to be able to contact me, I'd tell you.  Man, I'm sounding surly. Good thing I get a day off tomorrow. *whew*

      OK, the template took, but now somehow all my links have disappeared. When I look at the html code for the page, the links are THERE, but they don't appear on the actual page!!

      OK, I am getting irritated. Apparently, the AmbericanDaughter blog is still there, but not updated like the Pydahl one is. Also, I'm trying to change the look of the template here, but every time I do and then repubish the whole thing, there's an error but I can't click on it to see what went wrong!! grrrr.....  BTW, it was really cool that Jon came up last night, even though I had thought he was not going to be able to. He tried to make it a surprise, but I'm too clever to be tricked! hehe -- He was a good sport about the jelly beans... And an even better sport about the "Ice Cream." :)

      Still testing this new URL. Seems like something is not working out, like the site is not saving my changes and updates... well, it is, but sporadically. Some things take, others just don't. I hate this crap. I wish I knew more about html. And FTP. And all that jazz.

      Testing something here. I changed the name of this Blog from ambericandaughter to pydahl. Or anyway, I tried to. The changes SAY they were saved, but they ain't taking.

      Oh, one other thing. I purchased some goggles on eBay today too, for Burning Man. I'm pretty stoked. They have 3 sets of lenses. And my car is in the shop. And I went with Kathryn to get her dress fitted. Wow. She's getting married in less than 2 months. Wow. Those are my addendums. And now I must attempt sleep.

      Can't sleep. Well, that's a lie. I haven't tried to sleep yet tonight, so I don't know if I can or not. But I have no interest in going to bed right now. And it's late. Too late. Too late for me because I work at 9 am and all weekend and I HATE HATE HATE working weekends! (It seems I say that phrase about every two weeks -- Oh WAIT! I work every other weekend! grrr)  I put up that first post the day after Valentine's Day. I wonder why I never said anything about Jon? We had a nice time together when he was here. And the times we've shared since then have only gotten better.   I don't think I have anything else to say here that I would want anyone reading. There have been things happening that have made me a little bit upset though. What I WILL say is that war SUCKS. It makes everything harder. And I mean EVERYTHING. Things that wouldn't even occur to you otherwise. Things you never really associate with war, but I guess this kind of thing has happened before. It's just that no one ever TOLD me it could. I hate this. I hurt. I feel guilty. My happiness feels tarnished. I can never TOTALLY ignore it, not for a long time.   All I want to be able to do is just enjoy the beautiful things that I have found in life, but I feel that I can't fully do that now. I will do the best I can, and for the most part, things are lovely. I just hope that this can work out smoothly, and I'm hoping against hope that it will work out soon. I feel like a liar. I feel terrible about this. My conscience is confused.

      I suppose there is only one other person who knows what my name (Pydahl) really means. I'm going to keep it a secret for now. If anyone has any guesses, feel free to submit them. I guarantee you will not get it right, but it's always fun to guess! ;)

      Crying shouldn't be so hard on the face. It can physically hurt if you do it hard enough.  I read a letter tonight. Nothing else in all the universe is real. This letter is the only reality. Reality bites, like they say in the movies, but it is so REAL. It is direct and true. There is nothing separating it from me. Nothing has been this real in as long as I can remember.   My face hurts. My body and soul hurt more than I knew they could. Hell is not a solitary place for those who know their neighbors.

      I am not feeling well. Rather distraught, actually. I thought I was angry, but now I'm not sure if it's that or frustration or sadness or WHAT. Maybe boredom? Somehow it always seems that I tend to go a little bonkers on my days off (like today) when I don't have an extremely rigid schedule to stick to. I almost prefer being at work to days like this.   I just want to get OUT OF HERE. When I say that, I don't know if I mean out of this room, out of this town, out of this life or what. I just feel like somehow I need to escape something. It is a distressing feeling. I don't feel hopeless, but more like I am fully capable of doing what I need to do for myself but I CAN'T because I am trying not to upset any other balances that may hinge on any of my personal actions. Does that even make sense???  Honestly, I don't really think I even have a point here. I just feel so generally frustrated and upset that I need to vent a little bit, and this was pretty handy since I am dinking around on the computer ALL THE TIME anyway.   I felt really bad this weekend when Jon was here. I got that same feeling that I get once in a while that I'm just not very much fun for him. He denies that, but what if he is just being polite? What if he is IN denial and doesn't realize how dull I really am compared to someone like him??? Seriously, what can he see in me? What is so appealing about me? He is so creative and colorful in his life, and I am just so boring and bookish and DULL. I still wonder if he really even knows me. What he thinks he knows about me. What he has fooled himself into believing about me.   Why do I still find myself plagued by these same doubts again and again? Why don't they stop? Why do I feel so insecure regarding him and me? Why haven't I felt this pathetic in relation to anyone else EVER?? God I wish it would stop. I want everything to go away. I want to start over somewhere. Maybe it will help if I can get my own place sometime hopefully soon. I am really a pretty private person, I like having my private space and all that. Maybe that day will come again soon. Maybe when that happens I will be able to get everything back in perspective. All I feel like doing lately is just holing up in my room, hiding out in my own little space. Hell, that's really all I've felt like doing since I moved in here. It's the closest I can get to having my "own place" right now. It's not that I have a problem with Inga, she's a great girl, but somehow I can't seem to funtcion properly unless I'm alone a hell of a lot of the time.  Where am I going with all this? I just seem to keep rambling on and on with no end in sight. I'm sure I'll stop typing soon, since I have to go to bed like 10 minutes ago.  I found 7 apartments on Apartments.com in Roseville and New Brighton so far. They are really nice. Some of them are almost what I'd call amazing. A few are 2-bdrm 1.5-bath, but no 2-baths. Still, all under $900. I have also been tossing around the idea of still getting a place all by myself. Inga suggested both of us moving into her friend's old place but it's an older place in Minneapolis, which I'd really like to avoid if possible. Her original plan was to go to the cities after school anyway, I had made up my mind to go to the cities quite a while ago independently too... Maybe it would be better if we did just split our paths this fall and strike out seperately? I have a specific area I would prefer to be in so that I can be closer to Jon and closer to the job I hope to get in Shoreview. Plus, I really do like the northern suburbs... it's a pleasant area! Inga has her people and her connections down there that might be in different areas, and that's ok too. I guess she has her reasons for wanting to be in certain places, and I'm not going to force her to stay away from those. I don't know. We'll have to talk more about it and figure out what would work best.  Well, I better get to bed. I have to work Friday-Monday and then I get Tuesday off. I hate these stupid working weekends. At least I get paid tomorrow. *sigh*...  Good night world.

      The "basketcase" entry was not what it may have seemed. I had done something several months ago that I never admitted to until recently, and I felt absolutely terrible about it. Guilty would be the word I guess. And then I did something else after I wrote that entry that I felt even more guilty about. Something that was not very respectful of someone very close to me. That was a bad day. A bad couple of days. But I got over it, we got through it. Things have been much better since then. It was the culmination of a couple of really hard weeks. This past weekend was the completion of things getting better again.
