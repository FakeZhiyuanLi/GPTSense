       Was Thomas Eakins a Perv?    So, i was at my American Art History class today and we talked about Thomas Eakins and there was something about his work that caught my attention. He had this weird fixation with the "human nude body." (specially young men) He liked to paint boys playing sports. In his "Swimming Hole" painting, he depicts a group of young boys skinny dipping and he is the only older man in the picture. (in the water swimming next to his dog)          Thomas Eakins (1844–1916) Swimming Oil on canvas, 1885  Purchased by the Friends of Art, Fort Worth Art Association, 1925; acquired by the Amon Carter Museum, 1990, from the Modern Art Museum of Fort Worth through grants and donations from the Amon G. Carter Foundation, the Sid W.

       what to say, what to do   So, why is it that when you dont have money is way harder to make some and when you have the money is SO easy to make more even though you dont have any? I'm sure im supposed to give some fancy economic rule here.  I was thinking on  getting a second job at Pottery Barn next week (there is a new store opening) but after reasoning for a while i came to the conclussion that it'll cost me more to take this job than the money that i was actually going to make by taking this 2nd job. Not only economically, of course, but taking in consideration the opportunity cost of putting more time into this job and taking it away from my studying and whats more important, my SLEEPING time.  But why would it be more costly you might be wondering, well, by taking this job i would incur in extra expenses that i dont have right now (Car, Car insurance, Gas, Meals, CLOTHING, Etc.) plus working that many hours for sure would deter my studying time and also my sleeping time. So i came to the conclusion that im better off not taking that second job.

      so, i find myself in a weird situation that i really dont know how to approach. For the past 6 months i had been dating a really nice guy, we became really close and have feelings for each other. But this isn't a perfect world and well, he had to move to San Diego for work; We're both in a place on our lives where a long distance relationship seems pretty unrealistic.  Me in school and working during the weekends, him with a new job, it would be really hard to see each other. I dont have any plans to follow him there right now. It wouldn't work and we'd both end up hurt. At least this is the conclusion we both agreed on. But now what? i mean, im not with him anymore, i care about him a lot but, what do i do? should i go out and try to meet someone else? it just doesn't feel right, i feel like i'll be cheating on him. Maybe i feel like im only cheating on myself.  I guess i just need some time.   urlLink ');"> postCount(' ');

       New year's plans  So, last night was interesting. I went out to the bar with some friends and i got invited to the scotts' new years party. This year's theme will be "1960's manhattan." Apparently i have to watch"  urlLink Down with Love  to understant what this means.  I was thinking i can either wear a smoking Jacket and pull up a Hugh Effner, or i can go down to 4th Ave and look at some thrifth store for a v-neck diamond-shaped pattern sweater, wear a black bow tie, ankle-lenght pants, white socks and  urlLink these shoes.  I think it'll be decent.  OR i could do drag and dress up like Jacqueline Kennedy. You know, with the little pink chanel dress.    urlLink ');"> postCount(' ');

       Time to say good bye   Last May i met this wonderful guy. We started going out; then after a few weeks he found out he might have to leave town. It wasn't a big deal, we had fun and there was a chance he might've been back in 2 months or so. 1.5 months passed by and he was back in town, mainly because of me. He has been through hard times these past months and i've been to his side just hoping i made him feel at least a little bit better. Today, after 3 months of being together almost every day, he is leaving. He has better opportunities in this other city and i really think it's the best for him. All i want for him is that he'll be happy; I love him, and sometimes you just have to let that person go, in the name of the love you feel for him. It is going to be hard, but i know it'll be worth it.  I Love you Jason

       Good Times  so, i made it back.   San Diego was good times. So am i crazy? why is it that i get anxious whenever im away from home? is it homesickness or just agoraphobia?  more to come.....    So, what do you do when you know the person you love is not happy in the place he is right now and that moving somewhere else would solve most of his problems, despite the fact you wont be with him/her anymore?

So, now i have my test at 12:30 and then we're off to sunny San Diego, which of course it wont be sunny at all this weekend. am i bitter?

       Tired Monkey  I am a tired monkey, i didn't fall asleep until after 4:00 am this morning and i had to work at 8:00. Of course i was 10 mins late to work, not that it matters, but still late.  So the issue that arose this morning is that, since i was still half asleep, when i left home this morning i forgot my cell phone!! and i was just thinking, why is it that we're so dependant on cell phones nowadays? we were having this conversation the other night. One of my friends was saying that he refuses to get a cell and now that i find myself cell-less i really dont know what am i gonna do all day. I wont be able to meet anyone for lunch at school today, i WAS going to stay until later at school and go to my microeconomics' test review session; but now i dont know, i dont think i can do it.   Anyways, i am kinda hungry now and i have to be in class in a while. I think a pit stop at the coffee place is in the schedule.

        So, lately it seems that every time I go home I only get bad news or drama of some kind. It is bad enough that my grandma is living alone with all that she has been through these past years. On top of that, she has more crap to worry about, don’t get me wrong, she is about the strongest woman I’ve ever known but I just wish there was something I could to put her in a better place. I did discover today we're spending Christmas in L.A. this year though, I guess that should be good, although the holidays are not the same anymore but I guess you have to make the best out of what you have, huh.  On other notes, I was forced tonight to watch the most disgusting movie, John Waters is pretty sick, I don’t understand why John loves John Waters'  urlLink  Pink flamingos   it' just gross, NOT funny and just BAD BAD BAD! And the last scene?!!?!?!? I could not watch that, the minute I saw the fucking dog I knew what was coming, had I seen the scene I would've fucking projectile vomit the turkey and pumpkin pie. I will never forgive Mike for making me watch that movie, the good thing now is that I have a free passport to get bad movies for the rest of my life and the bitch cannot say a word about it.  oh and WTF?!!!

        So, my thanksgiving break started, it felt sooooooo good to sleep in and do absolutely nothing today. Here i am, it's 6:25 PM and im still in my PJs, now im just waiting for my roomate to go grocery shopping, we gotta get ready for thanksgiving. It turns out that there's a change in plans, i still have to let my guests know!! My roomate has to go in at work at 2, so what i'm gonna end up doing is just going to my dad's afterwards, my stepmom called me and told me they'll be waiting for me, so i guess it is going to be a family thanksgiving at all, which is good i haven't seen them in a while. Plus i still have to call my dad and ask him to help me out, i hate calling people to ask for help, but i guess you gotta do what you gotta do.     urlLink ');"> postCount(' ');

        I was walking home from work and for some reason I started thinking about that one time I tried to cheat on one of my classes. The sad part is that I wasn't even trying to cheat; I guess I can say I was forced?  Anyways, the story goes as follows... It was on either my freshman or sophomore year in college, when I thought I was superman and I decided to take 17 units one semester (19 units is the absolute highest you can take without needing the dean's consent). So, one of those classes was integral calculus, I remember one week got crazy busy and I ended up missing a couple of my calculus classes. See, I have the problem that whenever I miss a class, the next time I go i'm completely lost and I don’t know what the professor is talking about, this is why I hate missing class; but I digress. The topic for that unit was series (Taylor, geometric, harmonic, etc) the topic can be confusing and time consuming, so the professor trusted in our honesty (it was his 1st year teaching) and gave us a take-home exam. The test was due in class the next week, so I thought, i’m fine, I’ll go over the material by myself during the weekend and I’ll be able to answer it. Nope, came the weekend and I had a project due on Monday and other stuff came on the way. Here I was the night before the test was due and had no clue how to solve the problems.  Back then I had a friend who's a genius and who I thought could help me solve this test. I gave him a call and he had a big project due the next day also, so he was planning on pulling up an all-nighter. But he tells me he could help me in the morning, I agree to meet him the next morning at the coffee shop, the morning comes and there he was, as we agreed. I handed him the paper and asked him to explain stuff to me, I wanted him to walk me through solving the test. I get up to go get some lattes and when I come back, he is scribbling away, he solves the freaking paper in like 15 minutes, then I tell him "I wanted you to explain shit to me, not to solve it for me" to what he replies "its easier this way, I’ll just explain it to you when its solved, then you can try and do it by yourself and just compare answers."  After handing me the solved exam he quickly explains to me stuff and takes off, there I was with a completely solved exam but yet no clue of how to do it myself. My class was in 20 mins. So I had no choice, I copied the stuff from his paper to mine and handed it in.  The next class period I get my friend's test back, he got an A, a perfect score. The professor put a little note next to the grade "Excellent job, congrats!" I felt really bad when he mentions to the class that someone had gotten a perfect score and that he was really happy with the results. I couldn't stay in the room and I left, after walking on campus for a while I went to the teacher's office and waited for him to get back from class. I had to tell him what happened, I told him how I wanted my friend to explain stuff to me and how he ended up just solving the whole thing, I told him that was not my grade and that I was really sorry about it. He ended up giving us another take-home test which I did it all by myself. That was my attempt at cheating; I don’t know why I couldn't get through with it.     urlLink ');"> postCount(' ');

      So, i am kinda looking forward for the holidays. I still have to figure out what the hell im cooking for T-Day. My roomate wants Turkey of course, but my friends dont want turkey, plus i've never cooked a turkey before it should be interesting to see how things turn out.  Something im excited about is that i practically have the whole week off, it exception of monday that i have to come to work for a few hours in the morning and a class i have in the afternoon, the rest of the week i will be doing absolutely nothing. Well, i shouldn't say i wont be doing anything because i have school stuff to do, so i guess i will be homework week, hopefully i'll actually get stuff done. Its a big break, a whole week, wow it should be interesting.  Too bad John wont be joining us for T-day dinner this year, last year was fun. It's funny, last year we had game hens for dinner, they looked so cute, it was like we all had our own little turkeys. That day we just ate drank and slept, John and his sister came over early to start cooking, we went through 5 bottles of wine that afternoon, we were watching national lampoons Christmas Vacation, we all end up sleeping through the movie.

Or the military saying that the rocket attacks (the rockets were launches from carts pulled by donkeys) on hotels and the oil ministry in Iraq are "insignificant" WHAT THE FUCK!!!  and then GWB has the nerve to go to Europe and say that he thinks that the European countries should help rebuild Iraq, WHY!! you motherfucker you got yourself in deep shit now you get out of it alone.    urlLink ');"> postCount(' ');

         Automat by Edward Hopper (1927)  There's something about this painting that catches my attention, maybe the sense of loneliness of this scene. What's a woman doing eating all by herself at night in one of these places? why didn't she even take her coat off to eat? what's she doing? what's her deal?  Hopper wanted to show the sense of alienation people experience in ibg urban settings, this idea of loneliness within the community.

      So, it seems like im coming out of this cold. I spent two days in bed with a fever of 101F it was not a pretty sight, i had to call in sick to work on friday and missed class the same day, but you know what? the good news is that i lost eight pounds doing nothing!! no exercise at all, none.  But yeah, the downfall was that this weekend was supposed to be my roommate's 21st bday weekend, we were supposed to party all weekend and well, i couldn't do it with him. He did have a good time apparently, he got home at 4:30 am this morning and after 10 minutes i could hear him puking in the bathroom, today when i left the apt to come to work (at 12:30) he was still in bed, so at least he did have a good time.  Today i was reading  urlLink his blog  and he has an excerpt from Gabriel Garcia Marquez's  100 years of solitude   and i remember reading that novel a long time ago i wonder if i still have the book. Maybe i should try to read it again, it was a great book he actually won the Nobel prize. I'll have to look around.   urlLink ');"> postCount(' ');

      You wake up in the morning and realize that's raining outside, you have to be at work by 8 A.M. and you dont have a car. You ride your bike to work only to find out you've caught your roomate's Flu. After feeling shitty all day and debating wheather skip class and go home you decided to tough it up and stay. In class you get that test back you thought you got an A on, only to discover it's not an A. After class is over, you step outside and its still raining, you have to take the bus home because there is no way you can ride your bike home. While waiting at the bus stop a fucking bee comes by and STINGS YOU ON THE NECK!! what the FUCK!!! it's winter and its cold and wet outside. What the fuck is a bee doing flying around?!!

But then again i'll prolly end up like im next week so i shouldn't feel sorry for him. Last night he decided he was going to turn on the heater full blast because he wanted to "sweat it off" umm, yeah i guess.  So today was a pretty unproductive day, i had the day off from school and i should've spent it doing homework or at least writing this one paper i have a draft due tomorrow. did it happen? nope, i did write 2 pages of if but its not done, i guess im gonna have to write the intro for it tomorrow at work.  you want to see something funny?    those are my gay sims, aren't they cute? yeah thats what i did today, i played sims.  urlLink ');"> postCount(' ');

        So I guess the amount of work that has been accumulating for the past week is a sign that the end of the semester is close, huh?  I have an 87 page paper to read about Estate Taxes and a paper to write about is (one page-single spaced) how the hell do you write such a paper on just ONE page?! That’s going to be interesting.  Then I have my paper about art and the great depression. I've had the books for a month now, I even had to renew the check out thing and I haven't started reading about it, I think I should've picked my topic better. That’s due on Wednesday, the estate tax paper is due on Thursday, and I also have a test on Thursday. I guess we know how I am going to spend (or how I SHOULD spend my veteran's day holiday) we'll see how it goes.  In other news, I have to report what an interesting night I had last night. It all started when Mike came to pick me up to go grab something to eat. We get in the car and then when he stops at a stop sign we heard something hitting the trunk of the car, we had no idea what it was. We got some quiznos and came to my apt, and then Mike was looking for his cell phone. The cell phone was nowhere to be found. Yeah, he left it, for some unknown reason, on top of the car and when he drove to that intersection, there was the phone. In FOUR pieces. Poor phone  Then Nick and Trevor came over to have drinks before we went to the bar, I wasn't in a drinking mood so I proceed to pace myself. A Gay bar it's interesting when you are the only sober person in the place. I guess the only reason I went was because I needed an ego boost, you know, get some attention, and feel pretty.   I did run into some interesting people there, i just can't understand why the express posse don’t like me? I mean, I know that it’s impossible to be liked by everyone but, what did I do to them? Or maybe im just delusional. Maybe I should try to say hi to some of them the next time I run into them and not just wait to see if they say hi first.   There wasn't much selection at the bar, as usual. I ended up going home and calling Jason just because I wanted to hear his voice. He was watching a movie so we didn't really talk, I think he is in L.A. today, he was going to see his lesbian friend who is there visiting. But you know what, it felt nice to go home and go to bed sober. I woke up this morning without a hangover; I think I should try that more often. I have to say that by far, the end of the night was the best part. We stopped by los betos after the bar. The place was FULL of eye candy, gotta love homecoming. (I think that’s where Nick lost his wallet)  Then after that Nick and Trevor wanted to go to a party, I could get out of it because I was driving. So I just drove directly to my apt and said good night to the guys, by this time Trevor had sobered up a little and was able to drive. I am not sure what happened after that, I just know that Nick lost his wallet and he can't remember biting that guy's ear, or wanting to hook up with a married man.  Good times.     urlLink ');"> postCount(' ');

       Scary    So, i was checking my SAPR after registering for classes for next semester. I realized that i only have 12 more credits to go, that means that I WILL be graduating next fall. Evend though i know i bitch about wanting to leave and being done with school, the thought if actually graduating and start looking for a job and possibly relocating is kinda scary. Now i really need an internship during the summer, in a perfect world i'd spend my summer in Chicago working for a Marketing Research firm, but we'll see. the hunt for that internship has begun.      urlLink ');"> postCount(' ');

There are some things i need to work on, i just dont know why or what for. im tired of always try and be affraid of hurting someone's feelings. Why does it always has to be me the one to come around and try to make things better? why do i even HAVE to come arround and try to make things better? i dont know.  and to top it all off, the holidays are coming, i guess the only thing i look forward to happen this winter is the birth of my niece. I can't wait for her to be here!    urlLink ');"> postCount(' ');

      how are you supposed to get over someone when you turn on the radio and you hear songs like i can't take you out of my head, If you're not the one, here with you and your body is a wonderland? Then you turn the TV on and they're doing the most-relevant-moments-of-the-year thing and then you think about what you were doing when that happend and the only thing you remember is the things you were doing together at the time?  But enough about that, i already have my weak emotional moment of the end of the year. Now im just gonna get ready and enjoy the fabulous new year's party at the Scott's and hope for better and bigger things for this next year for all my loved ones and of course for myself too.   This was also the year this blog was born and i just wanted to thank everyone who has taken a few minutes to read my ramblings and double thanks to those who've taken extra minutes to leave comments.

      For today's art history lesson I've chosen Andrew Wyeth's Christina's World maybe in part because it reflects my present state of mind. In this painting the American realist painter depicts a young girl crippled since youth by infantile paralysis. She is dragging herself through the pasture outside her house in Maine. Wyeth said that he wanted to depict both the joy and sadness of this scene. Now you might be asking why does this image reflects my present? Well, I guess I just feel the desperation of trying to reach someone or something and not getting a response, finally realizing that I have to drag myself out of this situation and move on. im in my own Jose's world now.    Christina's World (1948) Andrew Wyeth  The Museum of Modern Art, New York

        So much has happened since the last time I posted something; I have to start with an apology to all my four readers for not wishing you a Merry Christmas on time, but as at least half of you know I was out of town spending some quality family time in warm and sunny south cali (actually it wasn't either sunny nor warm). Let me relate what's happened in my life in the past week.  It all started two weeks ago, when for some unknown reason I booked a flight to LAX out of Phoenix on a Sunday at 8:00 am, yep that's 8 in the morning. I guess I thought the sooner I left, the more time I'd get to spend with my family. (big mistake) Well, it turned out that the day before, (Saturday) my good friends  urlLink Chris, Paul and Rene  were going to be in town and seeing that I hadn't hung out with them in at least 6 months I couln't pass the opportunity of going out with them. So I quickly made arrangements to leave Tucson on a shuttle that would take me directly to Sky Harbor Airport in time to take my flight and make it to L.A. where my uncle would be waiting for me.  Well, all sounds like good times until you consider the idea that I was to leave Tucson on a shuttle at 4 AM. Yes, I didn't get any sleep that night, went out with my friends then after the bar we went to a house party and at 4:30 AM I was on my way to the airport. Ask me how I got to LAX and I still don't know, I was still half drunk and half asleep when I was waiting for my luggage at the terminal, I guess it was evident that I had a night of hard partying since the my uncle's first comment when we got in his SUV to head back to Anaheim was "You know your uncle stopped drinking, so we're gonna have a dry Christmas this year. Sorry."  The rest of the time was only family time, I didn't get to hang out with anyone else. Went to the mall with my family, went to the theme park with the family, watched Lord of the Rings with the family (you know its a big family when you spend over $100 on movie tickets and over $400 on theme park admission tickets) But it's all good times, I hadn't seen most of them in almost 6 months. Although I did come to a realization, next time I visit my family, I either visit for max 3 days, or I bring my own car so I can make my own mini trips somewhere away from all the noise.  But with all and all good times were had, and like they say sooner (boomer) or later you gotta pay. On my flight back to Phx last night I got to sit next to the guy who was reeking of alcohol, it was until then that I felt sorry for whomever sat next to me on the flight there. Once I got to Sky Harbor my roommate and Nick were waiting for me at the airport bar, having some drinks (talk about lushes) they even made me go pick up my luggage by myself. Since  we were already up in the valley of the sun we decided we were gonna stay and go out. Nick hooked us up with VIP passes and complimentary drinks at Axis Radius up in Scottsdale, good times. When the funs were had there we decided is was time to migrate and so up we went to Amsterdam where we asked Kenn to go grab us some more drinks before last call only to had to go look for him and find him making out with some random guy. By then it was almost 1 AM and time to look for the afterhours place. We heard the major's party was lame, as it was the rainbow room. My partners in crime didn't want to pay cover to not be able to drink anymore so we decided to head back to Tucson at 2 AM not before walking all over downtown Phx trying to find the damned Rainbow lounge with no success.  Once we got on I-10 and were thinking on stopping to fill up the gas tank we hear my roommate uttering something like "pull over I have to puke" which nick quickly did, my roommate opened the door while the car was still going (not on the highway anymore) and I grabbed him by his clothes to prevent him jumping out of the car, we finally came to a complete stop, he finished up puking and passed out in the back seat, we resumed out trip and made it back to Tucson at around 3:30 AM. Good times good times.

        Do you have any childhood memories? The kind that seen so vivid that it seems like it was just a few days ago when it happened?  There is one moment in particular that comes to my mind every time I think about my childhood, its just something trivial but for some reason its just stuck into my mind, maybe because I even have a picture of that moment. I remember talking to my dad and my aunt one night after putting on my new tweety and Sylvester PJ set. We were just watching TV, nothing exciting. I was bored and then I started looking at my hands, so my dad asks me "what's the matter son." to which I answered "Dad, I think im missing a finger, right here (between my thumb and my pointer finger, of course I didn't know the names of the fingers) there's a lot of space in between these two." I just remember my dad laughing and picking me up, then my aunt taking   urlLink this picture.  Dumb I know, but for some reason that's the moment that always comes to my mind when I think about my childhood.

      So i get up this morning and head to campus to study for my very last (and only) comprehensive final of this semester, my microeconomics test. So i thought to myself, maybe i should take my books with me and sell them back. I leave my apartment with $262.15 and 20 lbs worth of books in my backpack. After a short bike ride i make my way to the textbook sell-back counter in the basement of  urlLink the student union  then i hand over my 4 books in hopes of at least getting 30% of my money back. Then the lady on the other side of the counter says "We're not buying this one, this one is $7, this one doesn't have the CD and the last one is $5" yes, she wanted to give me $12 for my books. now let me break it down to each book so you can understand my outrage.  Mechanics of Materials James M. Gere  urlLink $125.95  Sell Back Price - $5.00 (needless to say i didn't sell it)  Art across Time Volume 1 with CD-ROM Laurie Schneider Adams  urlLink $65.75  Sell Back Price - Not Buying Back  Computers and the interworked society (Special compilation for UofA's MIS111) $42.00 Sell Back Price - Not Buying back  Reading American Art Marianne Doezema   urlLink 28.50  Sell Back Price - $7.00   THAT IS BULLSHIT!!!

        Yup. That's the theme lately, ITS BEEN A WHILE. since (here is when i make the mental list)    It has indeed been blocked  so I've decided to put up another of my famous art history lectures, this one was inspired by the movie Moulin Rouge; I don't know what is about this movie that people either completely HATE it (right mike?) or they love it. I think my roommate hit the spot last night trying to explain it to Mike. Mike's claim was that they slandered all that music and my roommate's response was based on the very last line from the movie:   " Days turned into weeks, weeks turned into months. And then, one not-so-very special day, I sat down at my typewriter and wrote our story. A story about a time, a story about a place, a story about the people. But above all these things, a story about love. A love that will live forever. The End. "  --Christian (Ewan McGregor)  At the beginning of the movie, the very first song that they use in the movie is the sound of music and it goes on quoting Elton John, David Bowie, Madonna and even Nirvana. Kenn's claim is that the message of the movie is basically love overcoming all obstacles, love being timeless, this would be the idea behind using the music from this broad period of time. I have to say that I count myself in the group of people that love the movie.  Now you ask, why the art lecture based in this movie? Well, IM sure many of you already knew this, but in the movie there's a character that was based in a real person. Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec. This character had a pretty rough life, his childhood injuries left his legs crippled and he often seeked refuge in alcohol to help him cope with his feeling of inferiority, he used to frequent the Moulin Rouge. His painting style was a very personal one, one can say is a mix between impressionism and expressionism. He many times tried to express the drama that the people from the  underworld  (show-business) had to live. The green skin tones refer to the artificial light in the nightclubs and maybe the lack of sun exposure.     Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec  French, 1864-1901   At the Moulin Rouge, 1892/95   Oil on canvas  123 x 141 cm  Helen Birch Bartlett Memorial Collection,       H2    {    color:Red;    font-size:30pt;    font-style:italic;    } Oh, and leave comments or sign the  guestmap  you bitches!

      Last Monday I got my Art History paper back, in it I talked about federally sponsored art in America during the great depression. And I was annoyed because, aside from a "good job Jose" my professor didn't make any other comments, I mean I did still get an A on the paper but it bothered that she didn't comment on anything; I felt like she didn't even read the paper. I know I'm dumb. Also, yesterday my microeconomics professor gave us our "progress report cards" so we know where we stand before we take the final, well I kept an A throughout the whole semester, until my last exam, but yesterday when we got the card I found out that I am 2 points short for an A. Needless to say, I was pissed I mean, I can still get an A in the class with the final and dropping my lowest score but I am just retarded. Anyways... Today is my last day of class and I have an American Art History exam, have I studied for it? Not really. I know some Dada, Pop Art, American Impressionist and Regionalism slides are going to be in it, I just need to know which paintings are by Dennis hopper, Roy lichtesntein, Rothko, Sheller, Henri and some other 25 painters. Good times.

           Vincent Van Gogh - Starry Night 1889  The Museum of Modern Art. This is one of my favorite paintings of all times. Van Gogh might be one of the most recognized post-impressionist painters. You might have heard that he was crazy and that’s why he hung himself, well i am here to tell you that no, he wasn't crazy, he was epileptic. At the time when not a lot of medical knowledge was available, his seizures were attributed to a demonic possession. His father was a very religious person and kicked him out of his house at an early age because of this belief that he was possessed. You’ll notice in the painting that the only building with its lights off is the church, this might symbolized the cold shoulder he received by the church all of his life. Van Gogh never sold a painting while he was alive; his main supported was his brother Theo who he exchanged letters back in forth for most of his life, these letters were the source for  urlLink vincent’s autobiography.   And no, Gaugin did not  urlLink cut Van Gogh's ear , they did have a (strong) hate - (little) love relationship though, and it was Gaugin who, after Vincent's death heavily promoted his work as a way to make it up to him maybe?. i wanted to keep these stories short and i am already not doing a very good job at is so if you want to hear more about this story let me know.

        As I face my last week of class for this semester, I sit here completely oblivious to everything that's happening, I think I have a test on Wednesday, maybe a paper due tomorrow and I cant really remember when's my first final. I guess I just have that Blah feeling right now, I really should get my ass back on track because everything is going to start going fast and next thing I know I'll be buying notebooks one hour before my first class of the spring semester starts.     Wednesday(12/10)  is my last day of class    Friday(12/12)  I have my 1st final    Thursday(12/18)  I have my last final    Sunday(12/21)  I fly to LA    Saturday(12/27)  I come back from LA    New years!     quick trip to  San Diego     January 14th  school starts    What was is thinking booking a flight out of Phoenix on a sunday morning?!!! ok, i was trying to find a flight out of tucson to LA, but the dates i was looking were almost a hundred bucks more so i said fuck that shit. Then i went to bought my tickets leaving from Phx on sunday at 8 am, this means that i'd have to take the shuttle up to sky harbor at freaking 4 am on saturday morning!! i guess i could go out that night, find an afterhhours and then go directly to the shuttle place. The only thing is that those things are so small i wont be able to sleep on my way up, ugh i really need to start thinking about these things. i wonder about myself sometimes (shut up john, i dont want to hear it from you). but yeah *sigh*  In other news, it seems like the new feature has been very well received and i promise i'll do my best to bring interesting images with funny/interesting stories. So it seems like I have FOUR readers now (ok ok, three and a half, one of them doesn't know how to read well *smiles at Andy*) so I think I'll go home and touch myself to celebrate this event.   Oh, and PLEASE would someone sign my guestmap thing? scroll down--------------------------------------------------------> i'd like to think i have friend in other places of the country.

         So, I bought  urlLink this computer  three months ago, well about a month ago I started having problems with it; at first XP told me there was a problem with a driver and that I had to reinstall windows, well I ran a "non-destructive system recovery" and everything was well. Until last night, I was playing  urlLink Simcity 4  and my computer decided to crash and it wouldn't turn on again!! The farthest it would go is to the boot screen and it'll tell me that my Hard Drive was "BAD" and I had to replace it. After 30 mins of being on the phone with an Asian guy, he told me he was going to have to send me a new hard drive coz as I was talking to him I realized that at about the same time I started having problems with the computer it started making this weird clicking sound, so I guess the HD was defective. After getting off the phone with the guy I started to freak out, I thought I had lost everything on my computer, all my papers from college, all my music, my pictures *whispers* my porn!!! What's worst!! MY CITIES!!! I had just constructed a new monorail and one of my cities had just reached a population of 150,000, I solved my water pollution problem and I was working on the air pollution, the dirty industry was decreasing and I had more and more high tech firms. (yes I know, I have no life) so I tried again, I think the hard drive just gets tired of working and it takes a break because after an hour I tried to turn on the computer and it worked, so I started burning CD's and I backed up everything but my music, I have to go home and do that now. It's gonna be a pain in the ass, then I wont have the Sims expansion packs!! The ones I borrowed from Jason (living large and house party).  I think some of you, my 2 readers, know that one of the things I am interested about is Art History. And maybe you've noticed that I've added some pieces of art that I find interesting and I've given a brief description and maybe some commentary. Well, I think I'll be doing that more often, this is how the IMAGE OF THE WEEK (or maybe just "today's image") is born, I hope you enjoy it.      Sir John Everett Millais -  Ophelia  1851-52  This is a depiction of a scene from Shakespeare's Hamlet. Ophelia goes crazy when she finds out that her father has been murdered by her lover Hamlet. This painting is an example of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, the girl posing as Ophelia was the "official" model of the pre-raphaelites, she had to pose for four hours in a tub filled with water for a period of four months, one time the water was so cold that she caught pneumonia and almost died (this was in London), Millais had to pay all her medical bills!!

        i was reading this article tonight for my microeconomics paper and found a paragraph that i pretty much agree with, so i decided to share it with all of you my two readers.  "I am not sure why people give eachother store-bought gifts instead of cash, which is never the wrong size or color. Some say that we give gifts because it shows that we took the time to shop. But we could accomplish the same thing by giving the cash value of our shopping time, showing that we took the time to earn the money." -Steven Landsburg (The Armchair Economist)  so kids, send money this christmas. I accept Paypal, check or money order and cash if you give it to me in person, dont send cash in the mail!!

         Well, here i am, my cocky self trying to write a paper and i just dont know how to start. Why do i get in these situations? there are PLENTY of other topics than the one i chose, better and easier, but no i have to be original. so now im stuck (up?) now and i want to DIE!!  so, i was thinking last night and i've decided my new year's resolution is to get another job. im tired of the one i have now, plus i need to start thinking in the future, it is kinda scary. What am i gonna do when i graduate? I told my grandma i was planning on moving to either Chicago or Ft. Lauderdale and she wasn't too happy about it. Apparently she thinks that if i move to either city, she wont see me ever again. Or i can just move to SD with  urlLink this cute boy   in other news, apparently the word GAY is a bad word now and kids in La. are not allowed to use it in school, or they can get punished. Gotta love the south.       LAFAYETTE, La. (AP) - A 7-year-old boy was scolded and forced to write       "I will never use the word `gay' in school again" after he told a      classmate about his lesbian mother, the American Civil Liberties       Union alleged Monday.  urlLink Read the story

        So, it's time to go back to school, after a week-long break and after the holiday i should feel refreshed and ready to face the last leg of this semester. But for some reason i dont want to, i can't wait for the winter break but at the same time i dont want to do all the work i have to do in the next 2 weeks. Papers, quizes and final exams are not fun.  In other news, i got told this weekend that i am a stuck up bitch and that i think im better than anybody else. AH! i'd say that's the fartest from the truth you can go, i am just a nice guy and not cocky at all. At least i dont think so, i think its just maybe that people get intimidated? coz the comment refered to the way i dress and the places i go. Like, the boy said "you look like you think you are better than anyone here" while we were at the bar. I mean, thats not a hard thing, be better than everyone at  urlLink THIS  bar.     urlLink ');"> postCount(' ');

        so i made it down to nogi yesterday, my nephew is the cutest baby EVER! he's only 10 days old and he weighted 7.5 lbs and measured 25.24 inches at birth. His name is Omar and he does nothing but eat, sleep, fart and poop its sooo adorable, I already went crazy buying him clothes the other day. If its up to me he's going to be the best dressed baby there is, hehe        While i was down there i made a visit to my grandma's house, she wasn't there; she doesn't spend much time there anymore. It made me sad to see the house so empty, i can't believe it's going to be four years since my granfather's death in just a few days. It's amazing how fast time goes by and yet i still remember talking to him or watching tv together as if it was yesterday, sometimes i still catch myself thinking, when i go to nogales i need to tell my grandpa this, or i need to ask him that. I had never experience the death of a relative until his, it was really hard to overcome that kind of pain. He was a great man, he is with no doubt a rolemodel for me, he was 73 years old and still i bet he was stronger than i was.  I also went to the eye doctor while i was down there, turns out that my eyes were more f'ed up than what i thought, well my left eye at least, so i got eyeglasses. they are actually really comfortable, i will need to get at least another pair though. I wanted a thick plastic square frame type glasses but i didn't see anything i liked so i just went with the think metallic frames, last night everyone complimented me about the glasses so i guess that was a good thing, although im not really sure about it yet.  on my way back from nogi i stoped by my dad's house, he was hanging out with a friend of his and they were having a few beers. My dad and his friend are funny when they drink; he is not very affectionate person, it must be the whole mexican macho thing. But his friend was telling me how he was talking about me and my brothers just before i got there, apparently he was talking about how different we are and how proud of us he is, it made my heart warm. My little brother is joining the nave in july, i think thats really cool, i know i couldn't do it i hope everything goes well for him, he is a great kid.

        I recently read on someone's profile on AOL that this person was particularly proud of the Bush Administration's tax cut. Let me give you a basic macroeconomics explanation as to why a cut in taxes was not the best way to go.   Even though the claim was that implementing a tax cut would put more money into the pockets of the average Joe, the truth is that the average Joe also tends to save some of his money (we're talking about regular people here, not the people that live from paycheck to paycheck). And also the reality is that the distribution of GDP in this country (and in almost every other country in the world) is very skewed, meaning that the ones that have more money would get more money as a result of these tax cuts. It is also a fact that the richer people are the ones that tend to save the most. Therefore, even though there was some money given back to the regular citizen, the total amount of increase in goods and services is less than the amount given back due to the aforementioned tax cut.   What would've been the best alternative? Think government expenditure. What appends with Govt. expenditure (welfare, education and other social programs, public works). If the government had spent the money that not collecting due to the tax cut, the result of this would be a total growth of the GDP by more than the amount it's spending. Why so? Well, by the government spending money, it creates demand for goods and services. Which in turn help to solve or lower the unemployment rates. By lowering the unemployment rates there is more people getting a salary and as a direct result of this salaries also can go up. So, on top of the money invested by the company, there is more people getting paid and at the same time demanding more goods and services. The result, GDP increases by more of the amount the government spends and everyone gets the benefits, not only the ones on top.  I hope that's at least a little bit understandable, if not email me with your questions.

        I like walking to school in the morning, its relaxing and it gives me some time to clear my mind and sort my ideas. Walking to school today i had an epiphany of what i want my life to be; I saw myself putting together a huge art show at an important art gallery in New York City sending out invitations to my friends for the show opening. Everyday im more convinced that this is what i want to do and i think i will try to pursue this dream.   Also on my way to school i was thinking about something i wrote on here the other day, i said that i believed life was a journey and not a destination. If this is true, i also think that we should strive to make that journey the most enjoyable possible. This can only be possible if we keep in mind that most things are out of our control and the easiest way to enjoy this journey is to make the best out of every situation that presents to us. I also said before that i believed that the pain of losing someone was well worth the memories of the times you spent with that special someone. This is why i also believe that for the memories to be worth the pain you have to forgive and forget, otherwise those memories can be spoiled and turn bitter.   If you are reading this i want you to know that i wish you the best of luck from the bottom of my heart. Even though you did hurt me and i think if i had been in your place i would've done things differently, i know we all make bad decisions. I want to thank you for those memories, i really enjoyed the times we spent together and everything you gave me. Even though it might take some time, i look forward to us being friends again. You'll always have a special place in my heart

        So im sitting here at work listening to crappy radio, the milkshake's on right now and its not helping me with my mood, i think almost everyone here noticed im not in the best of the moods today because they're not trying to make small talk with me, which is good. I still have an hour to go and im looking forward to go home so i can be alone, that helps me a lot just being all alone and having time to sort things out and deal with stuff, i like silence. This is why many times i keep my feelings for myself and not really tell my friends how im feeling just because i know they'll be worried and they'll try to help. But really, i think they'd help more just leaving me alone, it might sound a little selfish but this is the way i deal with things. Now it might make more sense why my favorite movie is Good Will Hunting.  This place is really getting into my nerves lately, i don't feel they really appreciate what i do at work and i've come to the realization that i really need a new job, one that will help me get to where i want to go once i graduate. This weekend i had dinner with a very good friend of mine and he recommended me to go talk to my professor and maybe ask if she could help me get a position in one of the local museums or art galleries. I have to say that it hadn't occur to me that this was a good way to go, im sure this would look good to the admissions people at grad school. I need to make an appointment with my professor for this week. I'll take care of that tonight.  In other news, i am uncle Jose now. My sister had her baby last week, his name is Omar i can't wait to go see him im really happy for her. I hope everything goes well for her, you know being a single mom and all, good thing that she's gonna have my mom's help.   Meryl Streep made me smile last night watching the  urlLink golden globes.  After winning best actress for her role in  urlLink Angels in America  she goes on saying that one of America's biggest problems is NOT that two people in love want to commit their lives to each other. I really think that the argument to ban gay marriage is that they want to "protect the sanctity of the union." If they were so concerned about it, they would've pass legislation protecting marriage in other forms. Right now Britney Spears could be in jail, along with all the people making and producing all those marry-for-money reality shows. Those are a real treath for marriage, they should first do a survey to compare how highly regarded is this union between the heterosexual and homosexual population. I know my friend  urlLink chris  is been feeling the "gay heat." (meaning he wants a real boyfriend) which took me by surprise, i would've never thought that he finally wanted to settle down. Good luck to him, oh and if you are a "wigger" (his word) in the Ann Harbor are, give him a Holla. He's a cool guy, very smart; He just today had to give a talk at the physiology department graduate student seminar about The pathophysiology of skeletal muscle strains and repair, and how information gained from basic science research is (or is not) influencing treatment of musculoskeletal injuries in orthopedics and sports medicine.

         Joseph-Marie Vien   Seller of Cupids - 1763  Musee National du Chateau de Fontainebleau   After the death of Louis XV and at a time when people were getting tired of the  urlLink Rococo  and with the revival of the Classical thought. The  urlLink Neoclassical  style was born and it was the product of the need of art that elevated the moral of sociaty and the demand for the art to comply with enlightenment thinking. The Academic art took more importance and the artist started to look back to the Greek Classical sculpture for inspiration. The discovery of Pompeii and Herculaneum in 1738 made this classical revival even more viable.  One of the things i love about art is that you can have the piece in front of you and to the naked eye it could seem the most innocent image, many a time this is not the case.  At first sight this image could seem a little odd, someone selling cupids in a basket? All it takes it to put a little thought on this you might find the "dark" meaning of this painting; aren't cupids the representation of love? therefore, isn't selling cupids, selling love? ha! the subject matter of this painting is prostitution. One little detail that i find hilarious is the sign that the little cupid is making, the "arm's length sign." Art critic  urlLink Didero  found this gesture particularly offensive, he claimed that the cupid's sign was the "size of the pleasure he promises."

        Tonight was a good night, I got to go for dinner with a good friend of mine and got the chance to catch up with him. It was good times, dinner was amazing and the best part is that I was his treat, thank you sweety! geez I can't believe he's been with his boyfriend for almost a year already. Then after dinner we went to the bar where I got a really sweet compliment, I kinda needed the ego boost. Brian said "you look great as always, but then again if there's something you can be sure of is that you'll always be dressed properly, you always look good." maybe im shallow but that comment made my night, I just need some loving. Please people gimme some lovin'

        Have you ever wished life was like a tape that you could just fast forward until a place where you were comfortable, that way you wouldn't have to deal with the issues that afflict you at the time? Did you ever wish you could turn the auto-pilot and just do stuff on auto mode, without thinking, without feeling until you reached the place where everything was behind and you could enjoy life again?  I gotta say that there have been several times in my life where this idea has crossed my mind, wouldn't it be nice to not have to deal with all the crap that sometimes we have to put up with? But then I recently read this next phrase in a friend's  urlLink AIM  away message:   "For a long time it seemed to me that life was about to begin - real life. But there was always some obstacle in the way, something to be gotten through first, some unforeseen business, time still to be served, debt to be paid. Then life would begin. At last it dawned on me that these obstacles WERE my life!"   It actually makes sense, I guess life is not a destination that you can just reach and be over with, what fun would that be. Life is the whole journey and all we have to do is live the journey, cherish it, learn from the mistakes and keep going. After all, I guess it is true that what doesn't kill you makes you stronger. What do you think?

        so i was thinking today, if i made my mind and decided to go to grad school next year i'd like to specialize in French Impressionism and post-impressionism. For that i'd kinda need to learn French and since schools only admit grad students in the fall then i'd have a whole eight months to study and perfect my French. SOoooooo, i was thinking what better way to do so than moving to France for? i could spend 7 to 8 months there studying French and maybe doing some research so when i get back i'd even have my thesis proposal! Doesn't that sound like the perfect plan? This really got me excited, but then again its just an idea that im throwing out there. Keep reading, i'll keep you posted.

        Even though Artemisia Gentileschi was born on an era were women were excluded from the apprenticeship in studios, she was the daughter of another painter Orazio Monotone Gentileschi. Her father was  urlLink Caravaggio's  student and when her mother died his father not knowing how to "properly raise a girl" took her to his studio where she learned the craft. At the age of 19 she was raped by Agostino Tassi and some people claim that this is the origin of her obsession with the scene of the beheading of Holofernes (she did at least 5 different paintings).

        someone asked me a couple of weeks ago if i had the opporunity of having surgery or taking pills to become straight, i would take it. I said no, i said i was happy the way i am and that i wouldn't change a thing about me; funny thing now i think i'd go straight in a snap if i could. There is a saying in spanish "The more i know men, the more i love my dog." The only reason i'd go straight is because i dont think women suck as bad as men do.

        I've discovered that i might have a new addiction... Internet shopping. In the past month i've done more shopping over the internet than what i've done at an actual store and in person and the sad thing is that, with exception of my A|X purchase, i could've just gone to the mall and get the stuff. I realized this just now when i was typing my credit card number at the barnesandnoble.com check out without even looking at my card, yes i do have my CC# memorized. What is the future of me going to be? i have been wondering if i have some degree of agoraphobia already, i love to be home i only leave my apt when necessary and sometimes i feel uncomfortable and as soon im done with my errand i want to come home as soon as possible and now with the internet shopping thing i just don't know. whats so wrong with just staying home anyways?

        im sorry my four readers, i know i haven't written much lately but as many of you know; school started last wednesday and well, i've been kinda busy. I hate the beginning of the semester, you have to run around trying to get all the classes you need. You get to stand in line at the bookstore to buy your overpriced books that you wont really use in class and all the crap that you have to put up with school administration issues.  I have a trip to San Diego planed this weekend, that should be fun. I need a break already! This semester is gonna kick my ass. I am taking 5 classes, all upper division; one of them is even a mixed, grad and undergrad class, that should be interesting. Which reminds me, i have to go yell at the bookstore people for selling me the wrong book, the ordered a different book than what the professor asked so now they better take it back or im gonna kick some ass.   I also have been looking into the possibility of going to grad school next year. I think im liking the idea more and more. I still need to do some more research, i am supposed to come see my last semester's professor to talk about the issue. The only thing im worried about it that i wont be able to do much with an MBA in Art History, i'd have to get a PhD and im not sure how i feel about that. Possible places i'd be going to grad school so far: New York, Chicago, Atlanta, Miami, San Diego or San Francisco.

      For the last couple of days I feel like I've been in trading spaces, Monday afternoon my roommate calls me at work and tells me we're going furniture shopping when I get off. We spent 2 hours picking a sofa/loveseat/end table set, I gotta say that the piece im more excited about is the Chaise Lounge Chair; its so pretty. After that Kenn dragged us to Woodys because he wanted to do scaryokee, that evening turned out to be kinda interesting. I ran into an old friend who I hadn't seen in a long while and then I kicked ass on the trivia network thinggy they have at the bar.  Then Tuesday morning, my roommate wakes me up at freaking 8 in the morning to go pick up a u-haul to go get the furniture because they wouldn't be able to deliver it until Saturday and neither of us had time to receive the furniture and assemble whatever it had to be assembled that day so off we went to pick up the furniture, my friend Mike helped us. I gotta say the room looks a lot better  urlLink (see Pic)   the freaking entertainment center was a pain in the ass to put together and heavy as a MoFO! We still need to make some arrangements and buy a few things to make the room look perfect, but at least some progress has been made and the most important thing is that the WalMart futon is out of there!!  Anyways, today is my first day of class and im not to excited about it, Even though officially my first class starts at 12:30 I have to go in earlier than that to try and fix some crap at the registrar's office and then go to the Economics of Strategy class in hopes that the professor will let me add it. Then tomorrow is my long day, I'll be in school from 11 to 4:30. It's weird, normally I'd be excited about the new semester but im not, I guess like Nicole Richie said "im over the whole college experience thing, or whatever" i just want to graduate. The other thing i have to do is go talk to my last semester's professor; i keep thinking about Art History Grad School, i'd like to get an MBA in Art History, i think that would really make me happy. Work at a Gallery or Museum and put art shows together (curate exhibitions, i guess that's what's called). Anyways, i should probably get in the shower  if i want to do what i need to do today. wish me luck today urlLink

        So little Bush wants to build a  urlLink launch pad  on the moon now?! What the fuck was he smoking? Let me tell you something Sr. why don't you worry about unemployment here on earth first!  Talking about compulsive liars, what do you do when you discover that one of you friends has this problem? i mean, the guy has to be somewhat smart to keep up all his lies and not get caught for all these years. One of my friends has known him since 1997 and it wasn't until tonight that we figured everything out. It's just funny and kinda sad at the same time.  what about those people planning on rallying for Michael Jackson? What the hell do they want? If he is guilty, he is guilty and he should go to prison, no marchs are gonna save him. Good God why people like to make a circus out of everything!   In other news, U of A was ranked the 55th best school in the world and the 41st best in America, i think that's just crazy but really cool.

        It's been three days since i posted something on this and i really don't know what to talk about. I guess i am going to bitch about my weekend; during the week there were so many plans for this weekend, going to L.A. then i wanted to go see someone very special in San Diego, let's go shopping in Scottsdale someone said. Well, it's Saturday evening and here i am sitting in front of my computer writing this post instead.  Two weeks ago i caught this nasty cough that wouldn't go away, i finally went to see the doctor yesterday and it turns out i have bronchitis so i just ended up staying in town and not being able to even go out. I am on antibiotics and because the cough suppressant i am not supposed to drink alcohol. It's just great, school starts next week and all i am going to do this weekend is sit on my ass and take pills like crazy, they're not even the good ones. My roommate did went partying in Scottsdale tonight, wont come back until tomorrow; I didn't feel like babysitting so I stayed. Anyways, this was a boring post. Sorry

        so, it was Sunday January 7th 2001 the day that i finally packed my stuff in my car and went on my way to college. Anyone that has had this experience might remember the excitement of it all, the expectations of the new life and the new people to meet. After i loaded my car and said my good byes and received hugs and advises i got on the road and it was then when i realized i had to fill up my gas tank. (i was only moving 70 miles away from home) So i stop at the gas station and im filling up the tank, then i had to re arrange some things i had in the back seat so they wouldn't fall over. Finally the gas pump stops and im all set to go. I get behind the wheel and start my car, as i drive away hear this weird noise it was like metal being dragged on the pavement. I am thinking oh no please, not right now i have to go! Please car don't break down now my dorm opened 2 hrs ago! i need to make it there!! Then i hear this LOUD laugh, someone pumping gas found my tragedy hilarious. i stop (I've only moved for like 20 feet) get off my car and walk around it. i had taken off without removing the NOZZLE from my gas tank and i ripped the hose off from the gas pump!!! It was so embarrassing, i proceed to remove the nozzle put it in place at the gas pump, look over to the mini mart, trying not to look at the person laughing at me, then i wait for a whole 50 seconds before i get in my car and drive away! The whole time i was driving to get to school i was making these stories in my mind of how the owner of the gas station was going to hunt me down and make me pay for the gas pump, maybe put a hold on my account at school and i wouldn't be able to register for classes, maybe they wouldn't let me check into my dorm because i had driven away and ripped off the hose from the gas pump. They never found me, i never had to pay for it and i have been back to the gas station, they've replaced the gas pumps since, i guess they were old already.

        so, i guess i am in the process of getting a new car, i had my heart set on a jeep wrangler but i am not so sure about it, i don't think they're very comfortable to ride, kinda noisy and well, the whole stick shift thing that i HATE. I also was thinking about a Ford Explorer, but i think i really should really get a more economic car, don't have the monies to be burning gas like crazy, i also would like something that'll run faster *sigh* i wish i was rich so i could just show up and get whatever car i wanted.   You know, as i face the new year i can't help it to get nervous. This will be my last year at the UofA and as of now i have no idea what i am doing after that, i know i still have a whole year to go but its like i have to start worrying about it as of now. My lease ends up in May so i guess i'll have to get another one for 6 months? i need to start doing research about the cities i might potentially want to live, companies i'd like to work for, kiss professor's asses to get good recommendation letters, so much to do. And on top of that i will have two full semesters (15 units each) and one summer class, if i do want to graduate this December and i think i do want to, it's time to move on and venture to new horizons.

        This was a pretty good weekend in the life of your fellow blogger. It started off on a bad note but ended up quite nice; Last Friday I was not in the best of the moods and my plan for the night was to stay in and play Sims on my computer until the wee hours of the night. Instead I had to put aside my depression and come out to save my friend Jess from her evil roommates. She came over and we watched movies then I went to bed.  Saturday I had to work and after that my friend Mike dragged me with him on a shopping spree and I ended up buying my  urlLink dream jacket  that I have been waiting for so long to get! Then we went off to the bar where my roommate got a little bit too drunk and very annoying. The night ended with a few friends over at my apartment; as it was my favorite Tucson's couple 11th anniversary, MAN thats a long time! as Nick says thats like 120 straight years or matrimony. Back at my place we watched Sex and the City and played Trivial Pursuit until 4 AM. which brings me to today's art history lesson.  One of the questions was the following: What Edvard Munch painting was stolen from Oslo's National Art Museum in 1994, on the first day of the Lillehammer Olympics?  The answer is...     The Scream, 1893  Tempera and pastel on board. 91 x 73.5 cm.  The first time Munch described the experience which gave him the inspiration to this painting was in Nice, writing in his literary diary. The entry for 22 January 1892 reads:    "I was walking along the road with two friends.  The sun was setting.  I felt a breath of melancholy -  Suddenly the sky turned blood-red.  I stopped, and leaned against the railing, deathly tired -  looking out across the flaming clouds that hung like blood and a sword  over the blue-black fjord and town.  My friends walked on - I stood there, trembling with fear.  And I sensed a great, infinite scream pass through nature."    Citing Gardner's book Art Through Ages: " Munch Felt deeply the pain of human life. His belief that humans were powerless before the great natural forces of death and love and emotions associated with them -jealousy, loneliness, fear, desire and despair- became the theme of most of his art.

        I am puzzled by an incident at work on Friday afternoon, at the time I didn't think anything of it and kinda just laugh it off. Talking to a few of my friends they both agreed that it might have been harassment, I really don't know what to think now.   Ok, I hold a student position at the medical library and my boss is this super conservative republican lady. It was Friday afternoon and me and a coworker were just sitting around waiting for the clock to tick 6 P.M. so we could go home, then I get a phone call and after I got off the phone the conversation with the co-worker went something like this:   co-worker:  Was that your special girl friend?  Jose:           What do you mean my special girl friend?  co-worker:  Yeah, was that your girlfriend?  Jose:           No.  co-worker:  or your boyfriend, if that's the way you go  Jose:           No  co-worker:  No what, not your Boyfriend or not the way you go?  Jose:           Not the way I go (here I had to lie and the only reason was because my brother also works here and im not out to my family)  co-worker:  Well, that's good because you know [the boss' name] is not too fond of the issue  Jose:           Well, it's not like she has a say in the issue, now does she?  co-worker:  Well, no you're right but you know how those republicans are.  Does that sound like harassment? The comments were all made in a non-threatening tone and just as a friendly chat between co-workers. Now I know that if I was to come out my boss would not be comfortable with me being gay and I do think she would either make it difficult for me to work here or would give me less hours for work next semester. Probably even at the time when she wasn't at the office.  I have to say that I don't feel threaten by the situation nor I care if she finds out, I am now hiding it from her and I do not care what she thinks or does. I know my rights and I know that if she was to do something like the afore mentioned she would be the one in trouble. Now I am just confused because of this incident made me realize all of this, I mean I knew before she was conservative and all that but I never realized just what could happen if she knew I am gay.

        I have to accept when confronted with the idea of gay marriage I did too, like my fellow blogger  urlLink Chris  had my doubts. I looked around and wondered if this was really what the gay community wanted, or is it just about the  principle  of equal rights. When I thought about I was afraid that if this became a reality and we were allowed to marry, we'd screw it up and then the heterosexuals would turn and look at us with dissaproving eyes and say,  see we were right . I know that a big percentage of the gay population is not concerned with monogamy and these "generic relationships" are all over the place  In my own specific case marriage is a good idea; I can't wait until I meet that special someone to spend the rest of my life in a monogamous relationship. I do believe there is a lot of people out there that think the same as I do, maybe im just a romantic but to me sex is much more than just a physical activity. Not to say anything about the people who decide to have open relationships, that's a matter of personal choice. I do believe that marriage is appropriate for me and it has nothing to do with "conforming to hetero standards" its about loving the person you are with and having that special bond and not needing anything else because you are completely fulfilled by your partner.

        Quoting the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy on  urlLink Civil Rights  where it says:   The first civil rights law, enacted in 1866, embodied the idea of discrimination as wrongful denial of civil rights to some while others enjoyed their full set of rights. It declared that “all persons” in the United States were to have “the same right…to make and enforce contracts…and to the full and equal benefit of all laws…as is enjoyed by white citizens.” (42 U.S.C.A. 1981). The premise was that whites enjoyed a fully adequate scheme of civil rights and that everyone else who was entitled to citizenship was to be legally guaranteed that same set of rights.   President Bush today called upon Congress to write discrimination into our constitution claiming that he is moved to take this measure in efforts to save the "sanctity of marriage."  Now the The American Heritage® Dictionary of the English Language, Fourth Edition. Defines the word "sanctity" as     Holiness of life or disposition; saintliness.    The quality or condition of being considered sacred; inviolability.    Something considered sacred    My question is, shouldn't be the church's concern to define what's sacred and what's not? Shouldn't the government be more concerned with the guarantee of equal rights to all law abiding citizens? Isn't the separation of the state and the church a fundamental foundation of this country? If an amendment on the constitution is made on grounds on protecting the sanctity of marriage what will happen to secular education mandated by the state? what about throwing out of courthouses copies of the ten comandments?   An amendment on the constitution is not to be taken lightly, specially if the amendment is only driven by politics. Hopeful Democrat candidate John Kerry said "All Americans should be concerned when a president who is in political trouble tries to tamper with the Constitution of the United States at the start of his re-election campaign."   Bush also said this morning that judges and local officials from Massachusetts, San Francisco and New Mexico were attempting to redefine marriage and "change the most fundamental institution of civilization" by allowing same-sex marriages. But isn't marriage a contract giving benefits and obligations to two people that want to spend their life together. The law should just be concerned with the basic rights of the individual and the constitution should not exclude any minority group of people based on any differences that this group might have with respect of a majority.   The matter of fact is that no concrete explanation has been given as to why two people of the same sex shouldn't be allowed to unite in matrimony other than for being "different" to heterosexuals; the House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco) said "Never before has a constitutional amendment been used to discriminate against a group of people, and we must not start now."

        I'm so tired of being here Suppressed by all my childish fears And if you have to leave I wish that you would just leave 'Cause your presence still lingers here And it won't leave me alone  These wounds won't seem to heal This pain is just too real There's just too much that time cannot erase  When you cried I'd wipe away all of your tears When you'd scream I'd fight away all of your fears I held your hand through all of these years But you still have All of me  You used to captivate me By your resonating light Now I'm bound by the life you left behind Your face it haunts My once pleasant dreams Your voice it chased away All the sanity in me  These wounds won't seem to heal This pain is just too real There's just too much that time cannot erase  When you cried I'd wipe away all of your tears When you'd scream I'd fight away all of your fears I held your hand through all of these years But you still have All of me  I've tried so hard to tell myself that you're gone But though you're still with me I've been alone all along  When you cried I'd wipe away all of your tears When you'd scream I'd fight away all of your fears I held your hand through all of these years But you still have All of me

        I sit here, debating whether or not I should go downstairs to grab a diet Pepsi. I am telling you, life can present you with so many choices that if you let them they can become overwhelming. All you need to do is keep focused and be aware of who you are and the principles you carry with you, as well as where do you want to be in life. Knowing these simple things will help you and make your decision making process a hell of a lot easier.  See, these are the things that I think of while im at work staring at a computer for too long. I was doing some research for my two papers and I realized how much fun it is to discover new things; I know you people are gonna say im a big nerd but I just like to read stuff and find out about things I didn't know before that explain better the reason why things happen.  Ok after this totally random entry I am going to go downstairs and get that Pepsi I am craving. A revoir

        So my roommate and I decided to start working out, this is a good thing because I've had it on my mind but since I didn't have anyone to go with I just couldn't commit to it. As many of you know, the hardest part is to start doing it; once you are on a roll you just do it, without thinking about it at least that's how I am.   You know I almost forgot how fun it is to go to the gym, its almost like getting fit is just an added bonus. For one you get to see hot boys naked in the locker room and half naked in the weight room. You also have more energy during the day and you just feel great; Lifting weights is also a great way to blow steam, you get all your frustrations out and release some stress. I am telling you, building muscle and looking great its just a little extra that comes with it.  In other news, I've decided to host the 2nd annual Jose's academy awards party. After my total failure from last year to try and predict who would win the awards, I've decided to take my revenge and take the money this year. Using SAS software, in my Quantitative Methods for Economic Strategy class, we are looking at data from the past 25 yrs to try and predict who the winners are. Doing simple statistics comparisons we should be able who has better odds on winning the  urlLink Oscar . So stay tuned, I should have my final list of winners by next week, just ready for the big night.  If you think you should have been invited to the party and didn't get the evite, its probably because i have the wrong email address. so PLEASE send me and email and i'll make sure you get invited.

      I have been thinking on moving out... Get my own place and not be under the rules or this site. After all ngrand78.com is available. We'll see, I'll ask around and see what kind of advise do I get. So I am supposed to write a paper about Charles Sheeler representation of the new America and the new national identity as an urban nation where the industry was the most important part of the new economy, all this within the context of the pictures taken at Ford's River Rouge Plant work. How am I going to accomplish this task? I do not know.  In other news, I don't think there are other news. I really hate it when I sit here wanting to tell you something and nothing would come to my mind. You know what I need to do? I need to start working out again, this semester I do have some time where I cant squeeze some gym time, I need to get my ass in gear and do everything I need to do.  You know what annoys me, when people only use one door in public buildings, everyone stands on the other side waiting for the person coming on the opposite direction to pass through the door and then they proceed. I have news for all of you people, THE OTHER DOOR CAN BE OPENED TOO!! That way you don't need to wait!

        What do you do when you know that the thing you want the most will never be yours again. What do you do when you finally realize that everything you wished and hoped for will never come to be? What do you do when you when you can’t lie to yourself anymore. What do you do when you are aware of all this and you refuse to close that chapter? How do you force yourself to move on; what is the best way to move on. Why is it so hard to accept the fact? Do you lie and convince yourself that you have already moved on? You stop talking to your friends about it; you make them believe that the pain is gone while the truth is that you are thorn inside?   The fact is that it all belongs to the past, all its left is memories. There is nothing anyone can do to change the new reality. Then why is it that you just can’t let go? What do you do with the feeling of emptiness? Is it just the fear of being lonely, of not being loved again, not being desired, of feeling unattractive? Then why refuse to take the opportunities that might show up in your face? Is it really loved? Or is it just the fear of being alone?

I will see you, or write to you when i get back on sunday night; that is if my plane is not hijacked for terrorist purposes and i actually make it back alive.

        i bet many of you my 5 readers (yes there's five of you now) don't know the origins of the St. Valentines Day, the most worthless of them holidays. It all goes back to the third century in Rome. It turns out that at the time there were a few wolves outside the city of Rome and they used to attack the sheppers once in a while until the God Lupercus started to look over the shepperds and drove the wolves away. So it was then when the Romans started to celebrate in February the Lupercalia Feast to thank Lupercus for his protection.   Also during the Lupercalia, but in honor of  urlLink Juno  the Romans used to hold a raffle of young women. Putting the names of the girls to be given away in a box and matching them with the men participating in the raffle, they were considered a couple for a whole year.  This is yet another reason why this holiday shouldn't exist, from hungry wolves to the giveaway of women. There are many more things wrong with this celebration. Not that im bitter or anything.

        so i blogged this morning waiting for my roomate to get ready to go to school. So now im sitting here at the union in the basement computer lab on my break and i dont have anything to blog. I usually use this time to write something on here but since i already did this morning i dont have nothing to say now.  Oh, thank God i remembered. I am supposed to look up my apartment's office phone number, i gotta call and bitch at them because apparently the shower upstairs has a leak and the freaking ceiling in there is about to fall down. good call  About the setting down thing from before. If there are any takers out there you just just make sure you buy  urlLink this ring

        So yesterday i had my meeting with my professor from last semester, i wanted to see her to talk about grad school. She was very helpful and nice, even though she told me what i already knew; she did give me helpful information. She even offered to revise and edit my personal statement letter and to help me rewrite the paper i wrote for her class last semester (and here i thought i was done with the new deal art in the U.S. during the depression years.) I also found out that i made a very good choice on taking Drs. Stacie Widdifield's and Keith Mcelroy's classes, apparently they are two of the best art history professors in the country. She encouraged me to go talk to them and let them know my aspirations and ask them for help, im thinking i could use the paper for their classes as my writing sample too.  As for my choice of schools, she confirmed my suspicions. The programs i want to apply for are among the most competitive in the country and it would be VERY hard to get in. The advice she gave me, is that since my only reason for picking those schools is the location (Chicaho, New York and L.A) i should look into other school in the same places. She also told me to do some research on who are the hot names right now in the field i am more interested in (19th century french art and american contemporary art) and maybe get in touch with them, ask about their programs and maybe apply there. I actually did find someone who i think it would be very interesting to study with, his name is Sheldon Nodelman and he teaches at UCSD and i guess San Diego wouldn't be a horrible place to be, although i do like it better to just visit than to live there. But of course now i am thinking more and more about the financial side of all this, maybe i should just be better of getting my job as a marketing researcher and make the big bucks! I guess i just sometimes feel like im on this middle ground and i have all these unresolved business. My friend  urlLink nick  said the other day that Trevor was the only man he knew with a biological clock, well i think i have news for him i think i have one of those too. I want to settle down.

         Date number two went very well, Brian is such a sweetheart. We had dinner, which was the best mexican food i have had in Tucson in a while (and i am picky when it comes to Mexican Food). I kinda feel bad thought, i dragged him with me to watch the movie  urlLink Girl with a Pearl Earring  and even i enjoyed it i realize other people might find it boring. The movie is a fictional story based on a real painting by the Dutch Master  urlLink Johannes Vermeer .   Little is known about Vermeer or his models. He only painted about 35 pieces and almost all of them depict scenes of the everyday life of middle class people engaged in various domestic tasks. The rich colors and textures redered by the artist on his paintings are till this day outstanding. another example of Vermeer's magnificent skills as a painter is  urlLink The Milkmaid . The true story about  urlLink The Girl with the Pearl Earring  is not known, some scholars claim it could've been the painter's own daughter who at the time would've been 12 or 13 years old. It is true that of all Vermeer's paintings this stands out thanks to the in-your-face quality of the picture, the engaging look of the girls eyes.       Girl with a Pearl Earring ( Meisje met de parel )  c. 1665,oil on canvas  17 1/2 x 15 3/8 in.  (44.5 x 39 cm.) The Hague, The Royal Cabinet of Paintings  Mauritshuis

        I've come to the conclusion that my new upstairs neighbors are gay. I have not seen them yet, so i don't have a gaydar reading but last night they were blasting techno/trance music and then this morning they were jamming to  urlLink Rufus Wainwright  kudos for that. Althought they are quickly becoming the annoying neighbors, the master bedroom is right above mine and therefore i can hear all the "matress noises" that come from the apt upstairs, NOT PLEASANT! and then they seem to not be able to just sit down and stay still, it seems like they like to run around the freaking apartment all the time! all im saying is that they better be cute or else im not putting up with this crap.  So i have the 1st of my 2 dates last night, the date went well, it was kind of a short date but i actually think 3hrs is the perfect time for a 1st date, you dont want to over do it. We just went to grab dinner and then i came home. We had a really good conversation over dinner and he made me laugh. We'll see what happens, date number 2 is tonight and i hope that one goes well, Brian is such a sweetheart and very talented too, for what i hear. In other news, and speaking of talented people, next weekend i will be going to San Diego. My old roomate's boyfriend is a graduate student director at UCSD and is directing his thesis play, opening day is February 12th. The play is called  urlLink I Ain't Yo Uncle  and it seems very promising, poor guy has busted his ass off for a few months now and all he deserves is to have a great show.  I also wanted to thank  urlLink burnsy  for his kind words last night, apparently he is liking my blog, which makes me happy.   ... Oooh I'm a star. And the audience loves me. And I love them and they loooove me for loving them.  And I love them for loving me. And we loooooove each other. That's 'cause none of us got any love in our childhood. And that's show biz...

        flash news school is starting to kick my ass already!  i am currently taking two art history classes, 19th century European Art and History of Photography. Both of them start off at roughly the same period, the 18th century, for both of them i need to write a paper, both of my professors are really good and i could potentially use the final paper needed for this class as a "writing sample" for grad school. Specially since in both classes we deal with 19th century French art. So for one of my classes i've decided to write about the  urlLink first impressionist art exhibition  which is one of my favorite themes. For the other class, history of photography, my professor wants me to write about sheeler's portfolio/documentation of Ford's River Rouge plant in Detroit. This could actually work since i have planned a trip to Detroit and i could potentially go to the Detroit Institute of Art and do some research there (but lets be realistic, i am not going to spend my spring break at a freaking museum) By the way, there is a really good show going on up in the  urlLink Phoenix Museum of Art , a lot of the paintings from the American panting collection of the DIA are up there, i have to go check it out. The other topic is more related to the impressionist movement, it'll be about Steichen and his attempt to "Impressionist Photography" (i just made up that term i think, it actually is Pictorialism). Anyways, another thing that pisses me off is that all the books are at the  urlLink CCP Library , which is only open for like an hour a dai. Oh well, we'll see I ran into fellow  urlLink blogger Brian aka bribs  today at school, which reminded me we still need to decide where we're going on saturday, any suggestions?

        After being single for almost four months, i guess it's time for me to "get in the game" (i hate that expression) again. I haven't had a date in such a long time, last month i turned down two guys who asked me out but now i guess i should give it a shot. I am kinda nervous because i do have two dates this weekday (different guys than last month, no im not a whore or a playa) and I've never had two dates with different guys the same weekend, hell I've never had to dates with two different guys the same month! But I guess its allowed, so my friends say. They're both nice guys and very cute, one of them is in school and he is graduating in may (and moving away) that could be a problem, but who knows. If nothing else I'll have two new friends. The other guy I was supposed to go out with a long time ago, but then I started dating my ex and didn't talk to him again, I just ran into him at the bar last weekend so we decided to hang out on Friday. Any movie recommendations?  In other news, i finally was able to install the SAS software into my computer! Those Cats people really suck. Ok i bought a "student license" from the U of A to be able to use the software in my home computer. They lend you the CDs so you can install the program on your computer and they're supposed to give you the code. Well, i never got the code i had to email them and call them so they could finally send me the email. then im on the phone with this person who works at A COMPUTER STORE (Bookstore's Cats) and he is trying to email me the link from where im supposed to download the code. He spent 10 minutes trying to figure out how to CUT AND PASTE a freaking link. Anyways, im over with them.  opinion poll, as some of you know i just got eyeglasses. So i need you to tell me which pair of glasses look better on me. Here are the pics...   or

      Ever since the show  urlLink While You Were Out  changed it's host I've had a crush on Evan Farmer until today. I googled him and found his  urlLink "official" website.  If you look at it everything is fine and normal. But he has a video section where he has a compilation of various tv appearances. Apparently he filled in for Carson Daly in TRL and he made sure to show his fans holding sings of "we love evan" every single time he was on the show, that's just too egotistical of him. Plus he didn't even used to look that good back then, now yeah he is fucking hot, oh well.  And what about the  urlLink boobs hanging out  at the superbowl halftime show. But what's even more hilarious to me is that they apologized for it afterwards calling it a "wardrobe malfunction" and that it was unplanned. For christsake! JT claims he didn't intend to expose Jackson's breast, even though the last line of his song was "im gonna have you naked by the end of this song." C'mon just get over it, i don't know why they're making such a big deal.  Now they are gonna have the feds investigate the show to see what happened. Well im gonna tell you what happened, JJ and JT wanted to make headlines just like Madonna and sluty spears did and what better way to top it of than doing something "outrageous" in front of 100 million viewers and of course they had to keep it secret and not tell CBS because they wouldn't let them do it. I feel sorry for Gil Duldulao who is the choreographer because now he's gonna have to answer some questions, I just hope he has money to pay for whatever fine they give him.   All i have to say is that i love TiVo, i get to watch the halftime show and the commercials without having to wait in between plays. They should just skip the middleman and only show the commercials and the halftime, they can run the game at night or some other day on reruns or something.

        due to the concerned raised by my  urlLink Fashion Challenge  i am forced to explain my reasons and strategies so all of you can go back to sleep at night and stop worrying about me. First off let me start saying that there is no one more aware of just how risky this procedure is and i know many people could be harm in the making. I could, i dont know end up looking like im the gay pimp who missed the boat to cuba.   Now, this all started when i ran across a pair of price-reduced Diesel Jeans and my friends were very skeptical about my ability to pull off an outfit that included said jeans. Faced with this challenge i felt obligated to take it and prove wrong who ever didn't believe in me. I am no fool and i know that not any pair of white jeans would look good, so to all of you out there who are afraid i tell you, just trust in me.   Also i am using this chalice to kill two birds with one stone, you see my roommate refuses to wear a pair of Diesel Jeans claiming that they are just an overpriced piece of clothing and that he can get the same out of a pair of GAP jeans *screech* so what i am going to try and prove to him is that Diesel Jeans are NOT just any pair of jeans, they're special and they are the ones who are going to help me perform this task successfully since i really don't think any other pair of white jeans would have the same results.  With that said, im going to ask you to bring it on bitch...

A friend of mine informed me he is taking on a monumental task.  I won't reveal his name because if he fails, it will be a big disaster. **    He wants to successfully pull off wearing a pair of white jeans. In public.  White jeans... in public!     I am not the only one who expressed concern over the successful deployment of white jeans as part of a fashionable gay male's outfit. But, if any of my friends can do it, this anonymous friend most surely can. He has natural style... I'm constantly impressed by his taste in fashion. But white jeans... I'm not so sure about this.   Not only does this friend want to procure white jeans... he wants white Diesel jeans. Diesel's aren't cheap. I don't know if I'd be willing to spend $170 on such an experiment. I guess the fact that they are Diesel jeans makes the thought of victory even more appealing.   White jeans are one of those things you laugh at while flipping through the  urlLink International Male  catalog.       urlLink     urlLink           I mean, come on, if you saw these guys on the street wouldn't you turn to your friend, giggle and make some snide comment about their jeans???  I think if you had the chance to ask Carson Kressley about wearing white jeans, this would be his response:      >     I feel I've done my duty as a good friend. I've expressed my concern and pointed out examples of white jean disasters. I only hope that if a catastrophe ensues, no one gets hurt ;-)  Anonymous Friend: i need a pair of white dardy diesel jeans Me: white? Anonymous Friend: yeah Anonymous Friend: white Me: wait Me: white? Me: white jeans? Anonymous Friend: mike said i can't pull off a pair of white pants Anonymous Friend: we saw a pair up in scottsdale Anonymous Friend: they were on sale Anonymous Friend: but they were way too short for me Anonymous Friend: so now i want a pair of white diesel jeans Anonymous Friend: coz they looked good Me: it would look funny i think Anonymous Friend: i CAN pull them off Me: well, maybe you should try the international male catalog... im sure they have plenty of white jeans there ;-) Me: while youre at it you could get, oh i dont know, maybe a sarong Me: or a full length leather trench coat with sequin beads Me: how about a tiara? Anonymous Friend: fuck you bitch Anonymous Friend: you both have no idea Anonymous Friend: i CAN pull them off Me: hmm Me: yeah i dunno Me: you'll need some kick ass shoes Me: and some sort of special belt Me: it might even need to be a MAGICAL belt Anonymous Friend: well, i KNOW i can pull it off Anonymous Friend: and it's become a challenge now Anonymous Friend: but i am going to prove you both wrong before this fall Me: i'm eagerly awaiting this       ** the Anonymous Friend being Jose

        did you know that 900 billion dollars is only 8.19% of the national Gross Domestic Product? and when you take in account that the GDP will increase approximately 4% per year by 2005 900 billion dollars would only account for the 7.4% of the national GDP. Now in if you take in account that this year's budget deficit was a record setting 480 billion dollars, don't you think that Kerry is only trying to fix what G.W. has done?   urlLink further readings    APPROVED BY ME AND PAID BY/FOR...  NO ONE, THIS SITE IS FREE   "Why shouldn't I work for the N.S.A.? That's a tough one, but I'll give it a shot. Say I'm working at N.S.A. Somebody puts a code on my desk, something nobody else can break. So I take a shot at it and maybe I break it. And I'm real happy with myself, 'cause I did my job well. But maybe that code was the location of some rebel army in North Africa or the Middle East. Once they have that location, they bomb the village where the rebels were hiding and fifteen hundred people I never had a problem with get killed. Now the politicians are sayin', "Send in the marines to secure the area" 'cause they don't give a shit. It won't be their kid over there, gettin' shot. Just like it wasn't them when their number was called, 'cause they were pullin' a tour in the National Guard. It'll be some guy from Southie takin' shrapnel in the ass. And he comes home to find that the plant he used to work at got exported to the country he just got back from. And the guy who put the shrapnel in his ass got his old job, 'cause he'll work for fifteen cents a day and no bathroom breaks. Meanwhile my buddy from Southie realizes the only reason he was over there was so we could install a government that would sell us oil at a good price. And of course the oil companies used the skirmish to scare up oil prices so they could turn a quick buck. A cute little ancillary benefit for them but it ain't helping my buddy at two-fifty a gallon. And naturally they're takin' their sweet time bringin' the oil back, and maybe even took the liberty of hiring an alcoholic skipper who likes to drink martinis and play slalom with the icebergs, and it ain't too long 'til he hits one, spills the oil and kills all the sea life in the North Atlantic. So my buddy's out of work and he can't afford to drive, so he's got to walk to the job interviews, which sucks 'cause the shrapnel in his ass is givin' him chronic hemorrhoids. And meanwhile he's starvin' 'cause every time he tries to get a bite to eat the only blue plate special they're servin' is North Atlantic scrod with Quaker State. So what do I think? I'm holdin' out for somethin' better. Why not just shoot my buddy, take his job and give it to his sworn enemy, hike up gas prices, bomb a village, club a baby seal, hit the hash pipe and join the National Guard? I could be elected president. "  where's that quote from?

        those of you who know me know i have a thing for skinny white boys with blue eyes, thick lips and brown hair ( urlLink Check out the ex's pix. ) Throw on a pair of diesel jeans, a funky looking/vintage tshirt, a messy/bed hairdo but most importanlty a pair of nice shoes and you have the man of my dreams.   well for the past couple of weeks i've been seeing this very cute kid at the bar that perfectly fits this description. but because of my im-not-good-enough complex, that i hide with my im-too-good-for-you facade, i haven't talked to him. so, this week i had some free time before class and i decided to check out the Jasper John's exhibition at the  urlLink UAMA  before it went down. So i walk in and to my surprise the boy works there! we exchanged glances, i asked him something about the exhibition and he aswered with a grin; then i proceed to walk in through the exhibition expection the boy to show up in any moment to maybe make conversation with me. five minutes later he sure did walked into the hall, but he was with a friend they went over to see a print and they started to discuss it, it was then when i realized it was time for me to go to class so i left.   so now my mission is to get his phone number next time i see him out. He doesn't just fit the physical description of th type of guys i usually get attracted to, but he also is a (my assumption) grad/undergrad Art History student, how perfect would that be. Oh well, i'll keep you posted.

      it was such a nice day today that I decided I was going to sit out and do homework during my class break. So I went to this very nice spot by the  urlLink Old Main Building  and I sat down on one of these picnic tables that they have outside the building; next to me there was a cute couple, you know just sitting and talking showing affection to each other. And then all of a sudden something started to bother me and I didn't know what it was, I could hear them talk in the background, the girl would giggle every now and then. It wasn't until I looked over my shoulder and saw them kissing when it hit me. I wondered how would it be if that was me and my boyfriend, would a straight person just sit next to us unbothered minding his/her own business and let us make out and enjoy each others company in that beautiful weather? I just didn't know what to make out of that feeling, it was very confusing. The funny thing is that i come home and i read  urlLink this blog   on a different note I hereby announce and profess my unconditional love to my boyfriend, yes I have a boyfriend. His name is TiVo and he makes me very happy (I know the quiz says Im Carrie and I totally agree, but for now im going to pretend I am Miranda.) Tonight he recorded for me the best  urlLink Will and Grace episode  I have seen in a LONG time. It was funny, Sharon Osbourne had a cameo, they talked about the ending of friends and sex and the city, but most importantly tonight was proven that I AM WILL TRUMAN. Yes, I've been saying this for quite a while now, I am neurotic, bitchy, bossy, forever single AND I drink gimlets. I just hope that when im forty I'll make as much money as he does. Oh and I need a Grace too, any takers? I have plenty of Jacks to chose from though.

        today while I was sitting at work, killing some time until I had to go home I came across  urlLink this article  that talks about this "whites only" scholarship; offered by the  urlLink Roger Williams University's  college of republicans as a protest against affirmative action. While I don't consider myself a big fan of affirmative action -yes I know, I am Mexican but if you just keep reading and I'll explain my reasons- and I would normally agree with this group's right to establish this kind of scholarship -after all we have all kinds of other scholarships given out based on ethnicity, why would this one be any different- it seems that these kids are not doing it for the right reasons.   But first let me explain why I think affirmative action, when not implemented appropriately, can be of detriment rather than beneficial for the institution. I truly believe in the notion that all men are created equal and posses the same intrinsic capabilities to make out of themselves whatever they make their goal to be. By differentiating people based on their skin color or cultural background we are coadjuvating to the idea that some skin color or culture is better than others. When affirmative action means lowering admission standards based on ethnicity all it does is to enforce mediocracy. When you form part of a minority group and you know what's expected from you is less than the average, you tend to just work the necessary to get you by, while the other "average" person has to work harder. When you put these two people together in the same institution the result is going to be a lower average performance, which will be a drawback to the institution.   The article states a few facts that could be seen as discriminatory to minorities, it talks about the group's attack to a gay-rights activist group and the criticism of Kwanzaa. This makes me believe that their opposition to affirmative action has nothing to do with equality. The scholarship application urged applicants to write an essay explaining "why you are proud of your white heritage" and asks to include a recent picture to "confirm whiteness." making clear that "Evidence of bleaching will disqualify applicants." But don't they know that I can be Mexican, look Asian and still be proud of my white decent?   The matter of fact is that there is no easy solution for a problem that is the result many socio-cultural and economical factors and where stereotypes play a big role. Now, I believe that a person can not be described with one word, or a couple of sentences. The best thing we can do is to fight those pre-conceived perceptions of what we should be due to the social or cultural level we were born in and only strive to be the best we can be for our own sake and never settle for less. By doing this we are not just helping ourselves, but we are creating a better, more understanding society.  Now if you made it this far in the reading I apologize for the boring post, my initial intention was to make fun about the article with witty remarks but instead I ended writing this long letter full of big words and deep thoughts. I know I left some lose ends and there are some gaps in the writing but if you're really interested send me an email and I'll discuss the issue with you at length over private email.

        I just wanted to point out that today was my first free ballin' day of the year. That's right ladies and gentleman, today I am wearing shorts and boxers; what's so special about that you might be asking yourself right about now. Well, not that you should know the answer, but that's what im here for; to give you answers. It turns out that I usually wear bikini briefs or boxer briefs, you know I like to have my junk as secured as possible. But not today, today I decided I needed a little extra freedom if you will. I've had that song in my head too.  And im freeeeee, free ballin' now im freeeeee, free ballin'  its nice and breezy down there, I love it

        I have to say that life is not fair sometimes, how could we let  urlLink that game  slip away like that! It's just beyond my comprehension. And in other note I have a question for you. How can someone get sick after drinking 2 pitchers of cheap tequila margaritas and wake up the next day and not be hung over!? Had it been me I would've spent at least three days in bed and would've needed to have a 5 gallon container of water next to my bed. im telling you, life is not fair.  So yesterday I get home from work and my plan is to take a nap before the game starts, my roommate and some friends wanted me to join them for margaritas at chuys, to which I said no because I was still feeling the consequences of my escapade from the previous night (I had one long island, 2 vodka gimlets and 2 bud lights and felt like shit the whole day) But I digress, The game was about to start and I was waiting for my friend mike who was on his way to pick me up so we could go get food real quick. In comes my roommate with a couple of friends, they walk into my bedroom and start talking, I swear I almost got a buzz just with the smell when my roommate got close and talked to me. My friend comes by, we take off to Boston market not before I left my roommate calling the porcelain god in his bathroom, he said he would be ok so I leave.  On my arrival I find him laying in the middle of my living room, my friends watching the game and complaining that my roommate was not sick and that he was just faking it. After I close inspection I realize that he is indeed sick and that it might be worst that we thought, I tried talking to him and he could barely respond to me. Apparently before I got home he did pretend he was sick, but then he did get sick for real and it was then when no one believed him. We finally take him to his bed and make sure he would be ok after puking some more and drinking lots of water and a couple of excedrins. At this point he somewhat regained consciousness and was freaking out about leaving his car that the restaurant and loosing his phone and also about having to work the next day at 7 AM. After dealing with him for a few minutes we convinced him to go to sleep and we went to pick up his car.   The next morning I wake up at 6 AM to make sure he makes it to work, I get up and walk to his room and I can hear him yapping away on his cell phone. The fucking bastard was not even hung over!! How can someone do that, I was seriously freaking out the night before about having to take him to the hospital and he's not even hung over the next day. I had a lot less to drink the day before and suffered the consequences the whole day. I have to say im pissed, but im just glad he's ok.  I actually take that back, now i remember when i was 20 back in Mexico i used to stay out drinking on a school night until 4 AM then waking up the next morning at 7 in the morning to go to school and then work in the afternoon. It just just be im getting old.

        you know, tonight after an eventful and stressful evening i was watching tv and as i was flipping channels there was a comedian on comedy central making a comparison between Michael Jackson and Mickey Mouse, comparison that i found rather interesting. It went something like this:  The most obvious comparison was the names Mickey and Michael of course. Then you know they both have a theme park in their backyard, they both wear white gloves and thight pants/shorts, they both have funny voices, they both are black with a white face; but most of all they both loooooooove kids (if you know what i mean).

        Heterosexual people claim that a man and a woman cannot be close friends without starting to feel some attraction to each other, I mean we all saw  urlLink When Harry Met Sally;  they say that when that special connection is made sex always comes next and screws things up. But what about Homosexuals? I mean clearly we can be friends with girls and not feel attracted to them at all. But does this rule apply to gay friends too? Can they be really close friends without feeling attracted to each other?   See the thing with gay culture is that, we kinda make it as we go, unlike heterosexual relationships in the gay world there are no sets of rules and boundaries established. This trial and error approach yields such diversity in gay relationships ( urlLink see generic relationships. ) In my own personal case I've had both experiences. I've had friendships that started with a crush, friendships that developed to a crush and friendships where no physical attraction ever existed. Most of the time I take the "whatever floats your boat" approach; BUT you can call me old fashioned but I do believe in rules and boundaries, it is just so much easier when things are laid out, there's less space for confusion. I don't consider this idea of " urlLink friendly sex " part of a healthy friendship. I guess that's why they invented the term "fuck buddies."  With an FB you get all the good stuff without the commitment.  A fuck buddie is a friend that is not really a friend, you don't have to have anything in common, you don't have to hang out with him, you don't have to share the same friends. You can go out or just call him over, have sex and get it over with. Both of them can have their own life and circle of friends and those don't have to cross at any moment. If casual sex is what you want, it is well worth the time to find a fuck buddy instead of ruin a good friendship over sex.

        so i took this  urlLink physical attraction test  and i have to say i got pretty accurate results, you should try it.    What Is Your Approach to Judging Which Men Are Handsome or Very Attractive?    Very Picky: It's official: You're "picky." The fact is you are drawn to the most handsome of the handsome. You know what you like in men and are more selective than most men your age. Your tastes seem instinctual. You'd make a great casting agent, because you have a good eye for men who have "star quality." In real life, your high standards may be an obstacle for you. It's hard to find a man with the strong features you like, who's also well-rounded in other ways. Still, you know the importance of a real physical "spark" in a relationship, and aren't willing (or able) to settle for less. The challenge is finding a man who really wows you physically, even if he's not the most handsome man in the room.     Looks     Aside from the specific face types and features you like, there is often an overall "quality" about a man that makes him especially appealing. There's something about his style and the personality he conveys that sets him apart. Next, we illustrate two "looks" that capture some of the common traits we saw across your choices.    Some may call one of your types "Pretty Boys," but all you know is that they're gorgeous. The combination of classic good looks with small noses, beautiful eyes, and full lips is hard to resist. These guys tend to be clean shaven, have clear skin, and get good hair cuts. They're taking good care of themselves so they can be "pretty" just for you! [Well, you and the 1 in 3 men (33%) that are also after them!]      Another subgroup of men you picked can only be described as "Hunks." They have a clean-cut, "All-American" look. They're very handsome, without being either "pretty" or overly "rugged." Their face shape and jawline are typically very masculine and strong, while the "inner face" brings more delicate features like a small to medium nose, beautiful eyes, and full lips. It's a balance between the masculine and the feminine that make these guys so irresistible. In fact, these guys have been chased after all their lives, by 1 in 3 men (35%).        Body type     You also liked the most desired male body type, which scientifically is called a "Mesomorph." This is a fancy way of saying that you like muscular, hunky guys. You'd find this type among leaner quarterbacks and other athletes, who are strong without being bulky, and have good flexibility and agility. They have broad shoulders, a muscular upper chest (nice pecs!), and the classic V-shaped torso. So, he looks great in (and out of) clothes. Around 10% of single men are Mesomorphs. Keep your eyes out for other signs like prominent jaws, square or rectangular shaped faces, good posture, and large wrists and hands. [Oh, and this type is prone to have very cute "bubble" butts!] At about 5'10", they tend to run about 185 pounds.   Eyes   You seemed especially interested in men with blue eyes. In the test, you may not have even noticed eye color on a conscious level. However, those beautiful blue eyes apparently stood out to you on an unconscious level. Supposedly, blue eyes give the impression of openness and honesty. By your choices, you've shown that you're open to men who wear glasses. Glasses can make a huge difference in a man's appearance. [Hey, it always worked for Clark Kent and Superman!] Maybe those studious-looking horn-rimmed glasses turn you on. Or maybe you just enjoy a man who has a variety of different "looks" and styles.   Nose   You have an eye for men with attractive noses. You seemed especially interested in men with what's called a "Button" nose. These noses tend to be short in length, with a small bulb or "button" at the tip. From a profile, button noses turn slightly upward at the tip. Even though you liked men with a variety of nose types, you seemed especially drawn to men with a "cute" and approachable look, which button noses tend to convey. Regardless of the type or shape of the nose, you typically liked men's noses to be relatively small. Larger noses can distract from the man's overall looks and did not seem to appeal to you in the test.   Lips   You really notice men's lips. In the test, you showed a preference for men with full, very kissable lips. Unlike most men who are at best, "lipless wonders," the men that really caught your eye had a full lower lip and a distinct upper lip. You probably don't realize what you focus on, but when a man, like Brad Pitt, is said to have full lips, it's the LOWER lip that is usually thickest and most noticeable. You love men with big, happy smiles. You were much less interested in photos where the men had small grins or serious expressions. Although you probably didn't notice this tendency, the preference for big smiles fits your overall interest in men who look fun, friendly, and approachable.   Hair   A good head of hair is a real turn on for you. You liked men with a variety of hair styles, but you seemed to have a special interest in men with full, wavy hair. Whether the hair was short, medium, or long, you'd rather see hair with body and texture than straight, stringy hair. Waves and light curls tend to give men a certain "boyish" quality that you seemed to like. And it's by far the best hair to run your fingers through! You liked men with a variety of hair cuts, but you gave special attention to men with short hair. A cut that trims the hair over the ears and short on top seems to fit the masculine "look" you are drawn to. In contrast, longer hair on men can seem too feminine for your taste. Lucky for you, this is the most fashionable cut for men these days, so there will be lots of guys who'll catch your eye. You liked men with a variety of hair colors, but you seemed especially interested in men with deep, brown hair. In the test, you picked a definite subgroup of men who had a variety of different features and "looks," but many had dark brown hair. This seems to fit with your overall interest in handsome MEN, not boys. Blondish guys can appear too boyish for you, while darker hair represents a more serious, masculine look.  A bald or shaved head on the right guy can be a real turn on for you. You seemed to give men without hair special consideration in the test where others dismiss these guys. It's their loss and means less competition for you! You understand the very sexy and masculine quality these men bring. You like your men to be clean shaven. In this test, the men that had beards or goatees were not especially appealing to you. You may occasionally find a bearded man sexy, but at least with this set of photos, your choices were not similar to men who say they love facial hair. Maybe you love the clean-cut look. Or, maybe you're just trying to avoid rubbing your face against scruffy beards. After all, how would you explain the stubble burn on your face and neck after a date?!    If this matches your description and you like my blog, you need to know that im single and you should email me!

        sometimes you have so many things on your head that you don't even know where to begin. Today as I was driving down to the Old Pueblo I started thinking how lucky I am to have made such wonderful friendships throughout these past few years, I think I have grown a lot as a person thanks to each and everyone of these people that I have called friends. Some of them are now living far away, and I might not talk to them as often as I used to, I may not hang out with them at all anymore but they can be sure that you are always on my mind, I guess I just want to say thanks to you for putting up with me at some point.  But I guess what you want to hear about is the Phoenix boy's night out (more like a weekend out), it was a weekend filled with fun, excitement, surprises and of course drama. I get to see my exhibition before it closed this weekend, I have to say that the painting that impressed me the most was John Singer Sargent's  urlLink Madame Paul Poirson   it was as if she was following me with her eyes from across the room, it was the most surreal sensation; I think I even said hi to her when I finally stood in front of her. I don't think I've felt like that with a woman in a long LONG time.   Among other events, this weekend I got a phone call from a boy inviting me to his party on Friday night, invitation I had to decline since I was already up in Phoenix for the weekend; I really don't know how I feel about the subject, sometimes I feel like im on a see saw. But I guess at the end is not really my decision and things are going to happen as they are supposed to happen. This weekend I also say the ex #1, I have to say he caught me off-guard when I went over to see his new place, I called him Saturday morning to say hi and to let him know I was in town, so he asked me if I wanted to come see his new condo to which I say yes and proceed to go over his place. As I walked in the first thing I notice is an  urlLink old picture  I gave him when we were dating (he asked for it.) then he proceeds to try and kiss me, the good thing was that at the very same moment my roommate calls me and I pick up the phone and start talking to him. I have to say that that kiss was completely unexpected, I mean it's been almost two years since we met and about year and a half since we broke up. Another thing that caught me off-guard was that he referred to the day that we broke up as "the day you dumped me." That was a little awkward, specially since I remember the break up being a mutual decision. He also asked about my other ex and then he proceeds to invite me to go on vacation with him once again in may (we took a vacation together when we were dating.) I mean, he is a great guy it was just weird to see that he still has my picture up, I also tried to joke with him saying that he had just taken out the picture because he knew I was coming, but then when I lifted it up and saw there was a dust mark I had no doubts the pic has been out on his book case for a while (and that he also needs to dust more often.) Oh well, I guess time will tell as for the boy who called on Friday I told him to give me a call this week if he wanted to do something; I think that was a bad move, I should've said that I was going to call HIM back this week *sigh* oh well. I think I am just going to go to bed now. I am tired

        Hello Kids, isn't it Spring Break wonderful, sun, beach, alcohol, half-naked bodies, taking off you mind off from school for a whole week. Too bad i will not be doing any of that; yeah because im a loser. I'll stay in town and work and do homework; the only activities planed for the break is a 2 day weekend visit to Phoenix woo-freaking-hooo. not that im bitter or anything, you know this one being my last spring break as an undergrad its no big deal to spend it at work and reading more and more books about economic experimentation, Sheeler's river rouge project and the French commune and the rise of impressionism. I am sure most of the people do the same during the break, those places like Cancun, Puerto Vallarta, South Beach are just a myth. There is a song in spanish that says "there will always be better times." Let's just hope this is true  So yeah, this weekend im off to Phoenix. I am planning on visiting my grandma up there on friday then i'll probably have dinner with Brit-Nick.

        almost 3/4 of a million bucks did the Willed Body Program administrator at UCLA pocketed in the past five years. These two people used to get the "scraps" from the donated bodies and  urlLink sell  them to big research companies like Johnson and Johnson. Who would've thought that UCLA also had it's own butcher shop. What I find hilarious to me is that these crooks would give out invoices for the body parts and also that the companies that bought such parts wouldn't think that they were engaging in an illegal transaction.  another one of today's headlines that seemed hilarious to me was that  urlLink "Americans are eating themselves to death"  doesn't this sound like an news flash of an outbreak of cannibalism? What the report states is that bad eating habits and inactivity are now the No. 2 death cause in America, with only 35,000 deaths below those caused by tobacco. I wonder if now we're going to get those  urlLink truth  spots about eating too much. I imagine them attacking fast food chains and all other junk food companies.

        I hereby declare Nick's 25th birthday celebration a success. Good times were had by all when we gathered at the 3146 E Grant Rd in Tucson Arizona for dinner at the  urlLink French Quarter.  At some point the night seem to be doomed to failure by the lack of a table to sit our big group. But after 45 minutes of waiting, while some alcoholic beverages were being consumed by some, our table was finally ready and we sat down to enjoy the finest creole food Tucson has to offer.  After dinner some of us came back to my apartment for cake,  but don't let me get ahead of myself. It turns out that Tiff brought her "newly gay" cousin to dinner. My interest rose when i found out that the boy had just moved back to Tucson 2 days ago after living in Monterrey for 2 years. Why was this so interesting, you might ask, well it's because he was cute and my sister currently lives in Monterrey; so now we had something in commen. On the way to my place Amanda suggested me to go for him. It was at this point that i found the possibility very interesting so I decided to try my luck. Once we got to my place I started a conversationspeaking in Spanish since boy had asked me earlier to talk to him in Spanish. From that conversation I found out that he moved back to Tucson broken hearted and with my recent experience with a broken heart I could easily detect that boy was on phase one of the broken-heart- healing process, theory that was confirmed when after the consumption of several beers at the bar boy wanted to call his ex back in Mexico and all doubt was dissipated when he pulled out of his wallet a picture of the aforementioned individual. This summed up with the fact that this was boy's first gay relationship (and im not sure but I think gay experience too) made me come to the conclusion that there is a "boy crazy" situation pending to happen any time now with this guy.  I have to make clear that at the time i was not aware that MexiNick had some interest in boy too, these two are the reasos for which i've decided to cease my pursuit. Plus if these were not reasons enough, I just realized this weekend that I am in the final phase of the broken-heart-healing process, a few weeks ago talking with my friend Mike he asked if I was happy and at that point, for the life of me, I could not answer his question. Well, today I asked myself the very same question and I was able to come up with and answer. The answer was YES, yes I am single and happy. I am back at being the happy self that I once was, I am just wiser I guess; you know how they say that what doesn't kill you makes you stronger, well im not dead. This is why I tell you Nick, I wont pursue anything with boy. I do have to say that I somewhat agree with Amanda, you will have to be careful, Tiffany would have to take sides if something goes wrong, so you might want to take it easy at first. Also keep in mind that boy will either go into rebound mode or into boy crazy mode. Neither of those are really relationship building modes but who knows. He seems like a nice guy and he is very cute so you just need to be careful. and again, HAPPY BIRTHDAY!!  And now here's a picture from Friday night.

        well I have to say that last night was the best night I've had in a while. Among the night's occurrences was the death of a cell phone for alcohol poisoning, me getting confused by "a famous person" (I didn't dare to ask which famous person, like someone said last night "you know, Danny DeVito is Famous"), someone telling me he really likes my blog and feels like he knows me,  urlLink a night of scary Canadian drag queens  (for my friend Chris), seeing the most awkward kiss on the dance floor, seeing my old roommate who I hadn't seen in about, hmm 2 weeks? It was good times, oh and oh how could I forget nick's quarter of a century anniversary! The night would've been perfect had I gotten laid, not that there were any potential subjects (i think im way too picky).  The good thing was that for the first time in a while I realized that im happy and that I have tons of friends that care about me and that soon I'll be gone and I wont get to hang out with them as much. Last summer most of my closest friends moved away already and this has been a time of building new friendships and making the old ones stronger. There's still plenty of good times to be had in Tucson and being single is not that bad, I think I'll try it for a while.  Tonight Nick's birthday celebration continues, I have to say im still kind of tired from last night. I didn't went to bed until 3 AM and for some freaking reason I woke up at SIX, give me a fucking break. Then we had brunch with  urlLink Nick and Bill  and 8 other fabulous people. Apparently we were being the loud and obnoxious gay table that cause two couple of old snowbirds to move to another table, we all thought that was funny. Tonight will be a long night, it starts with dinner at 7:30 then we're all off to my apt for cake and drinks after that a mini bar crawl is scheduled to end up at IBT's for last call and for afterhours we're all off to Clark's house. God have mercy.  In other news, i will soon start the "free martha" campaign where i will have the official free martha t-shirts for sale as means to fund the campaign. The shirt will come with a kit for the do-it-yourself print of the official "Free Martha" logo. The t-shirts will be available in beautiful spring colors and as the seasons change we'll have different colors to keep up, let's make Martha proud!!

      my friends say this describes me perfectly, i'll have to agree...    You are Carrie.  Cute, quirky and intelligent, men find it so easy to fall in love with you but things always seem to end in tears.  you're a commitment-phobe and you find it really hard to get over your exes.  Your dress sense is to die for and you blow most of your money on clothes, shoes and cocktails.  Gay men love you.    urlLink   "A 'Sex and the City' quiz"     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla

        Can I take a moment to say that nothing would make me happier than to see Joan River's Plastic charred in the flames of hell?  She is the most annoying, unprofessional and hypocrite person on TV. I mean how can she diss people on TV for their couture selection while she herself has a VERY POOR TASTE for fashion! And her plastic surgeon needs to be shot along with Michael Jackson's (although I think its the same one.) In the past Golden Globes Ceremony she interviewed Kevin Costner along her fiancee and she made the poorest in taste comment you can imagine,  urlLink here is a note from the USA Today      Costner's diamond dissed    In what should have been an ooh-aah red carpet moment, E!'s Joan Rivers blasted Kevin Costner's cheap choice of bling-bling. Seeing the diamond engagement ring the star gave fiancee Christine Baumgartner, Rivers railed: "Oh, you are a fool! It should be four times this size!" Costner, chuckling, muttered something about consulting his lawyers. Minutes later, Rivers demanded to see the rock on Brittany Murphy's hand, given to her by talent manager Jeff Kwatinetz, and proclaimed that it was "what Kevin Costner's fiancee should have had!"    WHO THE F*K DOES THAT?  she does look like an ugly version of Golum! She is the one who should get thrown in jail not  urlLink martha !!

        So i woke up today and i realized im in a good mood, the best mood i've been in a while. We missed the gym today because  urlLink my roommate   is sick apparently. It seems that tonight might be an interesting night, my ex-roomate and his bf are in town for the night and also at midnight will be  urlLink mexi-nick's  25th birthday. I still dont know why he's so excited about; after all he will be a quarter of a century old, oh well to each its own i guess.  I am really glad the week is over, after having the worst day on tuesday and being surprised with an exam i had no idea about. But i have to say i also was pleasantly surprised when i got back the midterm i did study for, i hope that getting an A in that exam will balance with the F i will be getting on the other one.  and now for your enjoyment, here are a few pics of me and friends. good times.  drunken times in Phx   Mo, John and Mike.   Roommate, Ex-roommate and his partner   Kenn, Me, Nick and Bill  One of my favorite Pictures   John, Mike, Me and Nick  Halloween 2003   Doug, Mike, Jessica, Brian, Nick and Me  These guys throw the best new year's parties EVER   Scott, Me and Scot   New Year's Party 2004 [at the Sccot(t)'s]   Mike, Me, Kenn and Chris

        today I realized that daily planners can be a very helpful thing! But they can also be totally worthless if you don't write down your daily tasks on them. Yeah, I learned that one the hard way. I show up to class today and guess what! We had a test, whets up with that?! I mean, yeah I do remember the professor announcing the test about 2 weeks ago but dude, if you're not going to put the exam dates on your syllabus at least you gotta make sure you remind the class about the test a couple of times before the test. I know I was not the only person surprised by it, there was this other guy that did not take it and left right away, I decided to though it up and see what I could do. Needless to say I failed miserably. Then I go to the professor's office hours and I get no sympathy at all from him, im there talking and all he did was nod and smile. Told me the weights of the exams are on the syllabus and that I still had a chance to pass the freaking class; then I tried to ask him to remind the class about the test at least once before the actual day but he seemed to think it was not his problem that students have other classes to take and sometimes accidents like this happened. No one said that taking 15 units of upper division classes was going to be easy but man, give me a break, work with me a little!  Then I go to see my graduating services advisor, because on the website for graduating services tells you to go see the advisor BEFORE registering for your last semester. Mind you, registration for summer begins next week and I know I need to take 12 more units for my major, 3 for my minor and 3 of upper division electives. So I go see this lady, from which I've heard horror stories; her job is to meet with students and help them graduate, you go there and she makes you feel like you are wasting her time while all she is doing is DOING HER FREAKING JOB!! She takes a loor at my  urlLink SAPR  and tells me, "why don't you come back AFTER you register for next semester?" and goes on to tell me "you need to take 12 more units for my major, 3 for my minor and 3 of upper division electives." I was like, umm yeah I figured that out all by my-fucking-self. What's wrong with these people! I can't wait to be out of here. Yes im on a bitchy mood and all I want to do is go home and take a nap but of course I have to do laundry because I've been putting it off for almost 2 weeks.  So my conclussion is: out-of-date daily planner =========> worthless up-to-date daily planner =========> useful graduating services lady =========> worthless professor's office hours ==========> worthless being able to bitch on my blog =====> priceless

        Part of my Saturday night experience with my drunk roommate was his "Christina aguilera" theory. In his drunkenness he was determined to make a statement; and it was that he was tired of trying to make other people happy and caring for what other might think. He quoted Christina over and over again, saying that just because the way she dresses everyone makes assumptions about her sexuality, saying that she is promiscuous and basically a whore. She claims that she doesn't care what people think and that she is who she is and does what she likes to do, if other people doesn't like it then its their problem.  It was a good point my roommate wanted to make and I have to say that this has been my way of thinking for quiet a while. Back in grade school I was one of the chubby kids that every other boy used to make fun of, as a teenager I got teased because, as a result of my obesity as a child I was not quite the best sports player, here and then boys in Jr high would make remarks about my sexuality because 1) I did not play sports and 2) I was not the typical Mexican macho that I was expected to be. As you can see I've been dealing with prejudices all my life; but something very valuable has come out of all this and that is that I've learned that happiness is not out there in the hands of other people, happiness comes from within. As long as you are happy with who you are and you have real friends that can appreciate you for who you are, then nothing else matters.   urlLink Nick  went through his prejudice incident for being gay this past weekend; all I have to say to you buddy is that as long as you are happy with who you are and you accept your sexuality and you surround yourself with friends that really care about you then it doesn't matter what a few drunk, fat, ignorant girls have to say. To answer to your post Nick, no I don't plan nor I've ever had changed the way I am in fear that it might get me in trouble at work, like I said before if they don't like me that's their problem.

        I must say that on my previous entry "gay hostile work place?" my co-worker's comment was purely his interpretation about what my boss' reaction would be. I do know that she is super conservative and I agree that that would be the case. I can't know for sure though if this would be the case, if she'd have a problem with one of her employees being gay. This situation makes me want to come out at work but the only problem I have with it is that my brother also works with me and no one in my family knows and I don't think this would be a good way to come out to them.  I just wanted to clarify this situation, this is not at the least a hostile working place; in fact I sometimes enjoy working here. (considering that right now im on the clock and I still have a chance to blog some.) Take care kids

        So much has been going on lately that I don't even know where to begin. School's been heel the last couple of weeks; from spending 15 hours straight on campus to sleeping 4 hrs per night, homework, papers, quizzes and tests, that has been my life lately. Although it all seems to be winding down now, not until next week when I have to take 4 finals, two on Tuesday and two on Thursday. That's going to be interesting, only two of them are cumulative though and one of them is open book/notes.   I am kinda worried though, last Sunday I found out that I had a 14-page paper due on Tuesday -the reason why I spent 15 hrs on campus- I mean, I knew I had a paper due but I didn't think it was that long, the syllabus didn't mention anything about the length of the paper. So u busted my ass coming up with an Economics Experimental Project; the title of the paper was "Risk-averse bidders, clock speed and it's effects on the revenue outcome in Dutch Auctions." Pretty interesting huh? well, you might be wondering why am I worried, that's coz I didn't quiet wrote 14 pages; I only came up with bare 13 and by that time I was totally drained and it was impossible for me to write more. In the past the professor has been kinda generous in his grading so I hope everything will be fine.  Graduation is in a few weeks, some of my friends are walking, things are going to change. I'll miss them when they move away, I guess it will be the same when I graduate, it is kinda scary what am I going to do when im done with school? What if i don't get accepted in any grad school?  What if I can't afford it? I've never waited tables before...

        By Holly Wells  urlLink Arizona Daily Wildcat  Tuesday, April 27, 2004   When a  urlLink UA  student was walking to class two weeks ago, she got an unpleasant surprise from a man hanging around a UA building.   Gina, who doesn’t want her last named used because she fears the man might try to find her, said she was walking to class on April 12 when a young man walked by and spit on her.   “I saw him walking toward me, and at first I thought he was spitting on the ground, but the spit hit my foot, and he turned around and called me a tramp,” she said.   In the past few weeks, several female students have reported being spit on and verbally assaulted by an unknown man who hangs around the Physics and Atmospheric Sciences building.   According to police reports, three weeks ago, an incident similar to Gina’s occurred when a female student walking by the PAS building was spit on and called a slut.   The report stated the man described by the student was also suspected of harassing several female students on previous occasions.   Gina said she was too stunned at first to say anything to the man, but she thought about the incident all day.   “No one’s ever called me a tramp before. I was just puzzled by it,” she said.   Gina said the next day, she found out the same thing had happened to one of her friends who had been walking in the same area. Both Gina and her friend had the same description of the man.   Gina said she then decided to report the incident to police, although she did not want to press charges.   “I thought someone should know about it since it’s happened more than once,” she said. “I just want police to find him and tell him to stop; that would be an appropriate action.”   Sgt. Eugene Mejia, UAPD spokesman, said the man’s behavior is unusual.   “It’s a criminal act and is disruptive to the university setting,” he said.   Mejia said none of the female students who have been harassed want to press charges.   But Mejia said if an officer sees the man spitting on someone, he could be charged with disturbing the peace. If someone did decide to press charges, the man could be charged with harassment and assault.   “It’s an assault since bodily fluid is actually hitting the person,” Mejia said, adding that the UA could also take disciplinary action against the man.   Gina said she saw the man who spit on her later that week but didn’t say anything to him.   “You never know if he could be unstable. You don’t know what he could do,” she said.   Gina said she and her friend do not take the same route to class anymore and avoid walking by the PAS building.

        It's amazing how things can change in a matter of days. The last couple of weeks have been interesting around here, many of you who read this know what im talking about. I wont get into details because it involves other people, but i guess what i want to get to is that one should take every oportunity to get to know oneself better. It's amazing how our own mind can play tricks on us, make us think something while in reality its the opposite and it only takes a phone call from someone to turn everything up-side-down and take us back to square one.   Luckly i have very understanding friends and i know i can count on them, when the day comes to move on it'll be really hard to part ways. I'll miss very single one of them and i hope we all keep in touch. Maybe i should write a cast of characters to introduce them, although it can be tricky. I'll sleep on it and if i come with a good one i'll post it. For now, you all know who you are, thanks for being there for me.

        i sit here in front of this computer with only 9 hours of sleep since last Sunday, last night I went to bed at 3:45 am and woke up at 7:30 to keep studying for my test. Tonight I have to go home after my 4:45 class and finish writing my 10 page paper. But you know, after all this stress I see a light at the end of the tunnel. I went to see my graduation advisor today, as I walked into her office I said "I want to graduate" im still not sure what my feeling was as I pronounced those words, im not sure if I felt some weight coming off of my shoulders or if I got some more weight on. I realized that it is happening, I am candidate for graduation in December 2004. You know I've been talking about leaving school all this time but it didn't really register until today, I am graduating and I will have to move on.

      you know you don't have to wait until midnight to turn on the TV and watch the Jerry Spring Show reruns whenever you need to fee a little bit normal by watching those fucked up people.  The internet has  urlLink Group Hug , in this site people go and posts"anonymous confessions" here are just some of them:  "i look at pictures of my crushes and masturbate to them at least 3 times a day. "  "Sometimes when I pick my nose, I like to rub it into my eyebrows."  "I had sex with my girlfriends bestfriend while my girlfriend was passed out on the couch."  "Two confessions: I was late to church on Ash Wednesday because I was masturbating in the bathroom at work. Secondly, I masturbate at work, even once at my desk, with a coworker at their desk not 20 feet away. I don't think they noticed. I wasn't fired, so I guess not. "

           Edouard Manet   Gare St. Lazare , 1873 Oil on Canvas - National Gallery of Art. Washington D.C.  Edouard Manet is one of my favorite painters of all times and his Railroad painting is one of my favorites by the artist. It depicts a woman and a little girl waiting near a black iron fence. At the time of it's introduction this painting caused a lot of controversy because nobody really knew what the painting was about. It represents a snapshot of everyday life, say you are walking down the street minding your own business and suddenly your eyes meet with those of a complete stranger, let's not forget that at this time art was supposed to contain a deep meaningful and moral message, this was just an image of an anecdotal scene in an urban street.  To me represents so more than just a snapshop, the woman's expression is that of a lonely person. It makes you wonder what her life is, the little girl even though is by her side doesn't seem to be related to her. It seems like all she has is her little puppy and her book. We just happened to walked by and disturbed her reading, became part of her lonely existence. Have you ever sat on a bus and looked around and wondered what the story was of those around you?

        Here's a story of a lovely lady, Who was bringing up three very lovely girls....  wait hold up, this is not that story. Today I was thinking how funny it is how things turn out and sometimes when things happen that seem to not be the best for one's plans, a better outcome can be expected out of that mishappening.  You see, it was the year of 1996 and I was a senior down in Nogales Mexico at this small private high school. My class was only about 50 people and we all (well, most of us) became close that last year. Our graduation party, which was independent from the school was held at a local club down on the border town, we ended up having over 1000 guests and needless to say was an awesome time. Since this was kindof our own thing, the party took place the very last day of class and then or senior trip to Mazatlan was in order.  upon graduation, my plan was to attend the  urlLink University of Sonora  going as an undeclared major with hopes of getting into the architecture department. In one of my previous posts I talk about how relatively inexpensive is higher education in Mexico, its just a matter of opportunity cost. Due to such low costs of tuition, universities had resourced to other ways of allocating their services. So they have all these bureaucratic processes and exams that determine whether you get in AND whether you get your main choice in major. Anyways, I made the cut to go into my second choice of major, not my first one which was Architecture. But my hope was that I would be able to switch departments as school progressed.  Anyways, we're in Mazatlan having a good time; we're supposed to stay there from Saturday until Wednesday and then orientation for me was on Thursday. Tuesday night comes around and we decide we're having too much fun and we want to stay the whole week chillin on the beach and partying at night. We do that, I called home told my parents I was staying and I'd see them on Saturday. But what about school you might ask, well that's the little detail. My plan was to show up at school on Monday, apologize I couldn't make it to orientation and register for classes that day. Well what do you know that the previous week was the last week before they closed for the summer vacations. And remember how competitive the registration process is? Well, they assigned my spot to someone else. So I didn't get to go to school that day and started working.   If you ask me now, I really don't regret not going to orientation. Instead I worked for the following two years until I got my "green card" in 1998 (that process took 12 years, that's another story I'll tell some other time). Then I started going to a community college in Nogales and transferred to the UA in the spring of 2001. I know at the time it seemed like a bad thing but what I learned about that experience is that you should always stand by your decisions and eventually something better will come.

        i have to say that this was among the most interesting weekends i've had in a long time. everything happened this weekend, from people getting punched in the face to me running into a screen door. But none-the-less it was a fun weekend after all.  It all started Friday night when we decided to have a nice dinner at the bamboo club only to be followed by our usual appearance at the bar. It was a rather interesting night at ibt's, the bar was not very crowded but there was an unusual number of good looking boys around, kinda odd for. After the bar we decided to head over to Clark's house were I proceed to run into the screen door that goes to the patio. I wanted to get in and like a deer in the headlights I didn't see that the screen was closed and I proceed to run into it and bounced back. That night's rendezvous didn't end until very early on Saturday morning, reason why I slept until 4 PM the next day (I think the amount of alcohol consumed played a huge part on this too).  The next night proved to be somewhat more interesting to call it something. Some peeps from phoenix showed up at the bar and we all hung out. kenn was out at the straight bar with his boss since it was her 21st birthday, the interesting part was when this straight dude at the bar was flirting with her AND Kenn, apparently his strategy was to flirt with the gay boy so he could bring the straight girl with him to the afterhours. What the straight dude didn't count on is my roommate's groping abilities, I don't think he liked that very much and decided to punch Kenn in the face, action that kenn found amusing. Me personally would've called the cops, no wait I wouldn't have groped the dude so he wouldn't have punched me, nevermind.

        You know, this is where i say it's enough. Whats next? burning witches at the stacks on halloween or impaling Santa Claus during christmas?   Actors Whip Easter Bunny at Church Show   Thu Apr 8,11:08 AM ET  (Associated Press)    GLASSPORT, Pa. - First, the Passion of the Christ. Now, the torment of the Easter Bunny?    It may not have been as gruesome as Mel Gibson's movie, but many parents and children got upset when a church trying to teach about Jesus' crucifixion performed an Easter show with actors whipping the Easter bunny and breaking eggs.   People who attended Saturday's show at Glassport's memorial stadium quoted performers as saying, "There is no Easter bunny," and described the show as being a demonstration of how Jesus was crucified.   Melissa Salzmann, who brought her 4-year-old son J.T., said the program was inappropriate for young children. "He was crying and asking me why the bunny was being whipped," Salzmann said.   Patty Bickerton, the youth minister at Glassport Assembly of God, said the performance wasn't meant to be offensive. Bickerton portrayed the Easter rabbit and said she tried to act with a tone of irreverence.   "The program was for all ages, not just the kids. We wanted to convey that Easter is not just about the Easter bunny, it is about Jesus Christ," Bickerton said.   Performers broke eggs meant for an Easter egg hunt and also portrayed a drunken man and a self-mutilating woman, said Jennifer Norelli-Burke, another parent who saw the show in Glassport, a community about 10 miles southeast of Pittsburgh.   "It was very disturbing," Norelli-Burke said. "I could not believe what I saw. It wasn't anything I was expecting."

        Sometimes walking around campus I can't help but wonder what would have been of all those people I knew growing up in Mexico, what would have they done if they have had the same opportunities that I have been given. I can't do anything but feel lucky and grateful for what life has presented me. Many of these people were far smarter and talented than I am, I wonder where that little girl from high school would be right now if she had attended an American high school, how many schools would've fought over her when she graduated with a perfect 4.0, last thing I heard she joined a convent to become a nun after finishing med school. What about my  urlLink neighbor  who's ranked  urlLink #1 in women's 400m by the IAAF . Or with my childhood friend who I think was extremely smart but because of discipline issues was dropped off from school. You know, I used to be smart too; in Mexico we don't use the GPA system we have a simple 1-10 scale I graduated number #3 of my class -perfect 10 girl being #1- with a 9.7 grade.  I mean, not that im saying that there are no opportunities of advancement in Mexico; in fact I think in certain ways you have a lot of advantages and I consider a privilege to have grown up in a third world country. You see, in Mexico education is easily available to those who's opportunity cost is affordable. Tuition when I left was only $140 per semester -today's tuition is $210- granted you don't have the same technology you find in an American institution but you live with your parents pretty much until you get married, credit card debt and auto loans are very rare, I had friends who were living away from home that survived with $10 a week -this includes 2 meals a day AND drinking money- this has helped me not to take anything for granted.

      sometimes we rush into making conclusions about people based on personal appearance or some other outside source and it only take a few minutes of conversation with the person to find out that the idea we had made was completely different. This happened twice to me tonight, first with a person that could potentially become a very good friend of mine and then with someone I was interested to get to know but now I am not so sure anymore.  the first one is my friend  urlLink Rupa , after a bad drag queen show we decided we needed to go get some food and it was then where we got into a conversation that shun some light on who she is and what she's been through. Underneath that extrovert personality lies a very smart and caring person that has been through some stuff that no one could even imagine, I really look forward to what our friendship might have in the future and I really hope I'll get to know her a lot better.  as for my second experience, you might recall a couple of weeks ago I had a " urlLink mission " that I wasn't able to fulfill. Well, tonight the boy came all by himself to talk to me and after a few minutes talking to him I discovered he was nothing like I had imagine he would be. He does seem like a nice guy, but he definitely has some issues that would cause a problem with my personality. He will be just one of those people you know from the bar and that you maybe talk to every once in a while but there is absolutely no desire to get to know him better.

        it's been almost six months since we've been apart and i dont know anymore what it is that i miss about you, maybe its just the memory of being with you, the idea of having someone so wonderful next to me. God knows that all i ever wanted for you was happiness, and that is the reason why i let you go. when we were together i was the happiest when you were happy. when you decided to move away i accepted it thinking only on your wellbeing. Now six months after, your dreams are coming true, you finally have that job you wanted so bad, there is someone new in your life and i am happy because you are happy. But i am also sad because i am not with you.   I know what it is that i need to do, i just need to convince myself to do it; you know that you will always be in my heart. getting over you has been very hard but i know i will do it sometime. i dont know what the future might have in store for us but whatever it is i wish you the best, i think you deserve it. as for me, i will try to make out the best of whatever comes my way. In the short time we were together you thought me a lot of things and for that i am grateful, i hope i've left a mark in your life and that you always remember me kindly. But now its time to move on.

        those of you who know me might have already noticed that sometimes I expect too much about myself. A good example is something that happened today; during spring break I was supposed to work on a paper that I had due the week after said break, for one reason or another I didn't get a chance to work on the paper and ended up finishing it the night before it was due. After reading the paper that night I thought to myself "this is shit, good thing that we have one chance to re-write the paper" so I thought I'd turn in the paper and expected to be asked to re-submit it. Well, today when we got our papers back I to my surprise there was a big fat red A marked on the cover sheet, it turns out that it was not a crappy paper after all, this is just one example of how demanding I am with myself (this might be the reason I am still single) and sometimes when I don't met my own expectations I feel like I let myself down, like when I got a B in my test when I thought I did an A job I spent most of the day in a bad mood.  well, right now im going through a crisis. Again those of you who know me might be aware that im graduating this December *crosses fingers* with a degree in Economics, you also might know that what I really want to do is get a PhD in Art History and maybe sometime be a curator of an important museum (high expectations.)  Another thing that you might know is that I was raised by my grandparents and that my grandfather past away four years ago and my grandmother still lives down in nogales. Now coming from the Mexican background and knowing that I am the only family member who -thanks to the Bush admin- wont be able to get married, I feel the obligation by the lack of a better word to describe the feeling, to take care of my grandmother. She is 69 years old and until now she has been living on the money my granfather left, now I know this wont last forever and at some point she will need someone to take care of her.  I've never seen myself like your normal 9-to-6-tie-wearer-office-worker kinda guy, this is probably why my first choice of a major was Civil Engineering, when that got old I switched to Economics. Now don't get me wrong I do enjoy Economics, but I think I am more of a creative-academician than a business person. My dream job would be to travel around the job researching works of art and putting them together in a big room so people can come and admire them. Now my feelings of "responsible grand-son" are making me doubt about my decision of going to grad school, maybe I should just pursue a career in Marketing Research to try and make money so I can support her. I know im only her grandson and that her sons and daughters are the ones who should be worrying about this,  but this comes back to what I was saying and its like when in school projects I end up doing most of the work because "I don't think anyone can do it better than me." And im not trying to be cocky here, I know that by no means I am better than anyone and, once again, if you know me you know that I would never pretend to think that way.  so my question is, is this wanting-things-to-be-done-correctly thing of mine, this I-can-do-it-better syndrome a good or a bad thing? I guess I do know the answer to this. And that's it can be both, good and bad it just depends to what extent I carry it. Maybe I should trust more in other people's capabilities, but more importantly I should trust more in myself. I still don't know what I will do once I graduate, I know I will apply to grad schools but I don't know what my final decision will be.

        today as I was doing some research on gradschool I started to think if this is what I really wanted to do and then this image of little Jose came to my mind. It was at around the time when I used to think that I was missing a finger between my thumb and my pointer finger. I remember vividly that night when I was looking at my hands and then I suddenly got worried about the huge gap between those two fingers and I was convinced I needed another one to fill the space.  it was probably at around the same age -5 or 6 years old- when people start to ask what do you want to be when you grow up. A normal answer would've been that I wanted to be a cop or a firefighters and I knew this so I remember that my answer always was that I wanted to be a firefighters or a famous painter. That's right, a famous painter. You see, I remember having these two 12+ volume encyclopedias at my grandma's house and when all the other kids were outside playing and running in the sun and rolling around in the dirt I would sit by the window with one of the books and just read about famous monuments, archeological sites and of course the grand masters of the arts. Good thing is that I toned it down once I got to junior high or else I don't know how I would've survived.   I swear I was not a total loser, I did have a lot of friends. Most of them were probably my friends only so they could copy my homework from me but that was ok, because I did have a few really good friends and that was all I needed. Sometimes I wonder what would've been of me if the internet would've been invented just ten years earlier, or for that matter I was born 10 years later. I wish I was still as smart as I was then.  but anyways, after remembering this phase of my life I think the answer was pretty much clear, I might not become the famous painter I wanted to be back then, but lets hope I become a decent art historian. After all I remember my grandma being excited about the idea and even encouraging me to take painting classes (which I never did), I'll try to make my momma proud.

        looking back at the day when I left home, I can still remember the feeling of excitement accompanied by all the expectations for my new life. It almost seems like yesterday when I moved in that room on the 3rd floor of my dorm. So many things have changed in my life, very little is left of that jose who barely spoke english and was terrified to engage a conversation with someone.  I had so many expectations, it was a whole new world for me to explore. I've learned so many things, I've met so many special people, I've made great frienships and grown as a person. It's really hard to believe that it was only three and a half years ago when I moved to Tucson. I didn't think I've get to love this town as much as I do now, but at the same time I think it's given me everything it had for me.  Graduation day is still 204 days away for me, but I think IM ready. ready to close this chapter of my life and start fresh again; I am really looking forward to experience those feelings again, dont get me wrong i will miss everything and everyone i've gotten close to in this town. I might not know where I will end up but that's the best part, life is full of possibilities all you have to do is keep you eyes open for the right opportunities that might present to you.

        How can I just let you walk away, just let you leave without a trace When I stand here taking every breath with you, oh You're the only one who really knew me at all  How can you just walk away from me, when all I can do is watch you leave Cause we've shared the laughter and the pain, and even shared the tears You're the only one who really knew me at all  So take a look at me now, cause there's just an empty space And there's nothing left here to remind me, just the memory of your face Take a look at me now, cause there's just an empty space And you coming back to me is against all odds and that's what I've got to face  I wish I could just make you turn around, turn around and see me cry There's so much I need to say to you, so many reasons why You're the only one who really knew me at all  So take a look at me now, cause there's just an empty space And there's nothing left here to remind me, just the memory of your face Take a look at me now, cause there's just an empty space But to wait for you, well that's all I can do and that's what I've got to face Take a good look at me now, cause I'll still be standing here And you coming back to me is against all odds That's the chance I've got to take, oh, oh  Just take a look at me now

        WORSHIP! You're inner Bombshell is the beautiful Audrey Hepburn. Like her you've been blessed with a "certain something" that no one could describe accurately. You are more reserved than other bombshells, and that shows in your gentle, graceful nature. You like doing things for other people and love volunteering for your favorite charity. Yours is a rare gift in this day and age. You don't need to show a lot of skin to be sexy, all you need is your eyes. To see Audrey at the top of her game watch the movie "Breakfast at Tiffanys".    urlLink   Who is your  inner bombshell?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla

        I am so mentally and physically drained right now, I wish I could just take a long vacation, away from everything and everyone (except a select few). im tired of all these expectations and im tired of trying to make everyone happy, I need to stop putting everyone else's priorities before mine. Someone said tonight, "you have to take care of yourself and treat yourself good because besides God no one will ever love you like you can love yourself." But then you look at other people and how you can have such a positive impact in their lives and its all worth it; I guess the trick is to identify who's worth the little sacrifices.  it was earlier this year when I met this, at the time, lonely kid who I have grown to appreciate and respect. I just really regret not having met him before so we could've spent more time together. He's the most genuine and sincere person I've met in a long time, without a single drop of malice in him. Brian, we will miss you but look at this like Summer said, its a new beginning full of possibilities and only good things can be in store for you because you deserve it more than anyone. And remember, I'll come visit you.  and now like my friend Mason says, im going to go take a LONG nap, would someone wake me up when im 30?

        if you're one of my four regular readers, you might have noticed that my blog has been less and less personal lately, well I think its in part because I had a really hectic last part of the semester, but also in great part its because in the past couple of months I feel like I've been in limbo, trying to deal with old feelings and trying to identify new ones and in the process hurting someone else's. Let me tell you, when it comes to emotions nothing is as easy as one wished. I just hope eventually things can go back to normal and our friendship will remain strong, which im very confident this will happen.  What doesn't kill you makes you stronger seems to be my motto lately. The bottom line is that I still have old feelings that I have to deal with and as long as im in this state I wont be ready to give what you deserve. I think you are a wonderful person and any guy would be lucky to have you as I could have, but precisely because I care so much about you I have to let you go. You might be wondering why? What happened? Well, I don't even know I guess I was just confused in need of some affection and you were there and I took it selfishly. For this I ask you to forgive me and I understand if you need some alone time, I wont try to push it as long as you promise things will get back to normal at some point.  Now about me, well I'll be fine. I know there's nothing I can expect from him because he has already moved on, all I have to do is enjoy my time left in Tucson and look forward for a new beginning somewhere else next spring. I have many plans and I have to work hard on achieving them, that should take most of my energy in the next few months. Luckily I have many friends I can count on and that will make it easier.

        As it turns out I've been at work since 8 AM after a 4 day absence. It was nice not to have to come in to work and have the whole day to pretty much do nothing. The good thing though is that I have a little less than a month before summer school starts. Oh, and speaking of school, you might remember that class where I had to write a 14-page paper and I basically pulled off my ass. Well, after finals I had a little scare thinking I wouldn't pass the class.  Apparently this professor doesn't like to give up all the information on the syllabus. I found this out a few weeks into the course when I show up to class and it turns out we had a test. Needless to say I bombed that test, that's the reason I was freaking out when I found out 3 days before the deadline that the paper was 14 pages long. As I said before, no guidelines or specifications were written on the syllabus. All it said was that there was a term paper.  Anyways, this final the professor had told us that it would be comprehensive. Thing that I found odd since the final was worth the same as the 2 midterms and the paper, anyways I busted my ass studying for a comprehensive test and when I finally get my copy of the final, oh surprise. It was not comprehensive, and of course, the material there is exactly what I didn't think we would be tested on so I was sure I had failed the final. To this add the failed test and what I thought was a really crappy paper.  well, I found out today (geez this story got longer than I intended) I got a B in the class, I had already settled for a D I only wanted to pass the class. But anyways, that was the highlight of my day.

        interesting day i had today, not that anything out of the ordinary happened its just nice to not have absolutely anything to do. I am enjoying my school vacation, I so needed this break. I layed out by the pool then went to watch Kill Bill V.2 (we watched V.1 last night) which I gotta say that motherfucker Quentin Tarantino is a genius. Then we went for a walk at the park and got free food from chipotle. Event the weather was wonderful.  tomorrow I don't have anything to do either and so far the only thing on the agenda is another tanning session by the pool. I have to start working on my internship applications very soon though. I am supposed to email my resume to nick so he can look it over. Now the cover letter I will need some help with. Im just gonna have to keep my fingers crossed, its kinda scary to look at real life in the eyes. To think that seven months from now I should be really worried about what im doing next because exactly seven months from now I am supposed to be graduating. So for all of you damn bitches that know me, you better mark December 18th on your calendars!

        with the XXVIII (that's 28th) Summer Games only 90 days away and the current turn of event added to the general anti-American sentiment incited by this country's invation of Iraq, one can only wonder how these games will turn out. United States Olympic officials have already asked their athletes heading to this year's Athens Games to tone down jingoistic behavior for fear of inciting anti-American feeling.  The fact is that everytime I watch the news or read something on the internet I get this feeling of uneasiness deep inside that tells me that we haven't seen the worst of this situation. With the war in Iraq, Osama still being fugitive and thanks to Fort Ashby's very own P.F.C. Lynndie England (which I think she's only a scapegoat, although she does seem to be enjoying herself in the pictures) im afraid this thing is going to get even messier.  Yesterday at work my boss asked me what did I think was worst "the prison porn pictures or broadcasting of the beheading of an American civilian." By the way she asked the question you can guess what her answer to the question is. The thing is that this question could have many answers. If you take in account the culture differences, for these Iraqi prisoners what they were forced to do is far worst than being beheaded. Now I would never in a million years would in any way shape or form justify either of these events. And the bottom line is that both violate the very basic human rights.  The sad thing is that now there is no easy solution for this problem, other than maybe pulling out our troops and letting other countries run the U.S financed rebuilding of what we destroyed and we know this will not happen. All I say now is that we probably have bigger and badder things are yet to come, so stay tuned.  P.S. Thanks G.W.

      I know I haven't been posting regularly in the last few weeks, but I have to say that I had a very interesting end of semester, with all the assignments and studying for five finals there was no much time or inspiration to write an entry for my blog. But thank God that's all over, now I get to relax for a couple of weeks before I start all over again when I start my summer courses.  Yesterday was the day I took my last two finals for the spring semester, I woke up at 6 am after sleeping only 3 hours and headed to school. Nice surprise I got when I got my first final and realized that it was NOT a comprehensive exam like the professor had said it would be. Needless to say, I had busted my ass the night before and that same morning studying all the material from the course. Let me tell you, reading about Pareto optimal allocation, risk averse individuals, Dutch auctions, dictatorship games, self-regarding preferences are not what I'd call pleasure reading. But that's in the past and I don't want to even think about it anymore.  Later in the day, my friend Michael's pre-commencement ceremony was held, by the way I want to take the time to congratulate Michael for his newly acquired BA. in Media Arts, CONGRATULATIONS BUDDY! I also have to congratulate Schweaty Balzack who also got his bachelor degree in fine arts. That's right, you know how during graduation you walk up the stage and you hand the presenter, who normally is the Dean or Associate Dean of the college, a little piece of paper with your name and degree so they can announce it and then you go on saluting all the faculty from your school. Well, this guy handed her a piece of paper with that name, it was hilarious. Imagine a hall with almost 2500 people in it, at first it took me a while to get the name, I was like is he for real or not. Then everyone bust out laughing and for a few minutes you couldn't even hear the names of the graduates. To what the Dean could only shrug and say "Hey, I only read what they give me."   Well, I think that's all for now. But now that school's out I should have more time to blog regularly as usual. I hope I get my 4 readers back. Have a good one!

        Let me tell you a story of a charity auction gone wrong. It was last Sunday May 2nd when we joined the people at  urlLink SAAF  for their  urlLink 17th Annual Reno Gannon Memorial Jell-O Wrestling Extravaganza  I mean, don't get me wrong the event was a complete success. They reached their goal of raising over $23,000 for the Southern Arizona AIDS Foundation. Now let me explain a little what Jello-O wrestling is about.  Like I said before its an annual fund raising event for benefit of the Southern Arizona AIDS foundation, the event is held the 1st Sunday of May at Woodys. The event is comprised of a series of Jell-O Wrestling matches where the wrestler try to raise as much money as possible within the crowd and from other sponsors previously to the match. The matches are alternated with live auctions of good donated by local business and individuals within the community.  This was my first year attending to Jell-O wrestling, but throughout the three and a half years I've been living in Tucson I've heard so much about it that I was really curious to attend. Anyways, let me get to the point of my story. We get to the event at about 4 P.M. on Sunday afternoon, already there saving a seat for Mike and I were my ex-roommate and my current roommate, they proceed to take Jell-O shots and low carb beers as if the bar was going to ran out of said beverages. After the second wrestling match and during the second live auction, both of my roommates were rather toasty. Now our friend Clark, who is one of the most generous persons I know, not happy with already being busy with his volunteering job at the event was bidding on anything that Lucinda Holliday and Gilda Phatone asked him to buy (the auctioneers were drag queens).   Said drag queens had already asked the audience to make their job easier by not making signals that they might interpret as a bid, like waving at a friend across the bar, warning the people that they might buy something they didn't intend to. Anyways, like I said before Clark was bidding on the ongoing auction and my drunken friend wanted to ask Clark something, so since he couldn't make any gestures at him, Kenn decides to call Clark on his cell phone. Action that the drag queens-turned-auctioneers interpreted as a "call in bidder." At the end of the auction Clark turned out to be the winner and when one of the drag queens asks "so who was that on the phone anyways" the other drag queen sees my roommate on the phone and point at him and says on the microphone "it was him, over here. He was embarrassed to bid for the object himself." To what the drag queen #1 responds "well hun, you can be happy now. The $160 butt-plug and DVD porn is yours now!" to what my roommate had nothing else to do but to stand up and face the cheering audience who thought that he wanted the overpriced sex toy. Good thing he was so drunk otherwise I don't know what he would've done. Sad thing is that he wont be enjoying the little toy.  God! That was a long one, I didn't mean to make this story so long. I hope people actually read the whole thing.

        as promised, here is an update on my friend norm's situation"    I am pleased (and yet a little scared) to report that Norm was able to obtain a boarding pass and make it through security without a photo ID.  apparently a birth certificate and police report are more than anyone needed.   Thus, we can cancel the Emergency Queer Reserve watch, posted last night, and do not need to begin planning "NORM-AID 2004" to get the boy a bus ticket to Phoenix.   Norm and I thank you for all your support.   Sincerely, Buckhead John "Orgy Master"

      I was watching six feet under the other day, I believe it was the second episode where the mortuary's sewage system goes awry and blood comes spouting out from every drain in the house. A plumber is called to fix the problem and he ends up giving  urlLink David  a little bit more than a hand with his pipes. At night David tells  urlLink Keith  what happened with the plumber to what he simply answers "well, I hope you know you are not getting out of having sex with me tonight." I seem to be a little bothered by Keith's reaction or lack there of. I think its because in contrast with  urlLink Peter Krause's  character, Nate who is trying to cope out with his wife's death -for which he feels some guilt- is going through a whore phase and it's supposed to cause antipathy, they played this "infidelity" as something normal and trivial on a gay couple.   I mean, im not trying to be a bitter queen by saying im butt hurt by the portray of this stereotypical situation. I know this is real and many people are ok with this in their own relationships and if it works for them, more power to 'em. I was just surprised that Keith and David now are going to have a semi open relationship; Especially with Keith's issues. I mean, they were pretty much a normal couple, Keith has his anger management problems and David is afraid of him and tries to please him any way he can. While Keith knows he so fucked up that no one else but David will put up with his shit and that's the reason they're still together. A normal co-dependency driven couple.  But anyways, this episode is a very good example of why im in love with my TiVo.  urlLink Justin Theroux  -you might remember him from Charlies Angels 2- has incorporated to the cast of SFU as  urlLink Brenda's  new fuck buddy/boyfriend and is in this episode that he appeared naked walking across the courtyard of their apartment complex. Besides his ass you can see his penis dangling in front of him as he tries to hurry up as to not be caught naked in public. Well TiVo has a slow motion button that permitted me closely examine his schlong and let me tell you it a nice one. I just wish it also had zoom in option like most DVD players *sigh* I guess I'll have to wait until they come out with this season on DVD for that. Good times

        The other day one of my students.... Thats a phrase I wish I'll be able to use at some point in my life. It think it'll be very self-rewarding to teach a college-level Art History class. I wouldn't be a tough professor, I'd try to make it fun for my students; I think I'd flirt a little with my students too. Especially if im teaching at a university like the U of A with all those hot frat boys running around wearing tank tops and flip flops.   In other news I was informed last night that during his visit at the ATL, Norm lost his wallet. Therefore loosing his ID and credit and bank cards, that wouldn't be too much of a problem as it would be an inconvenience if he was at home. But seeing as he has a plane to take tomorrow morning and no identification to attest that he is not some terrorist trying to fly a plane into one of Phoenix's high rise buildings. This seems a very tragic conclusion to this trip that included a visit to the dark room of some sketchy bar and the end of his dry spell (alcoholic dry spell, this guy gets laid every other day) Stay tuned for the conclusion of Norm's Atlanta Odyssey.

      this is an excerpt of a conversation I was having with  urlLink Brian  who is  urlLink away  in Cripple Creek doing a show:  Brian: I am so out in Podunk, even the High speed internet is slow Brian: grrrr Brian: 30 minutes to download a 55MB program Jose: Podunk? Brian: the middle of nowhere Jose: oh Jose: lol Brian: I think is a derivation of poor/drunk Brian: basically that's what the locals are Jose: lol Brian: poor drunk Brian: and the whole town shares one tooth  I guess there are worst places to be than in Tucson; so this weekend was a good one for me. I have to announce that I am officially dating someone now. And for this I have to thank Rupa since she was the one who set me up with Derick. He's an awesome guy, sweet, smart and funny among many other things. Speaking of Rupa, I guess every good news is usually followed by a bad one. I found out today that she might be coming back from L.A. later than planned, in which case I might have to make a trip up there for my birth day, if she's stuck there still by then I hope she might be able to come out and party with us. But first I have to worry about my summer class, I have my second exam next Thursday and then my final exam next week.

        So I was reading  urlLink Mason's blog  the other day, this kid really amuses me sometimes. His blog is hilarious. Here's an excerpt of one of his entries where he's  urlLink bitching  about, among other things, the amount of bugs that have been roaming around the great city of Norman, OK.   "One particularly interesting thing about me is that I constantly personify everything. I call it interesting, you might call it annoying, but then I might call you a piece of shit.. So whatever, we all have our opinions. To each his own. Anyhow, personification. As I mentioned the convention seems to be in town and the Junebugs are out in FULL force. One such Junebug was walking through my apartment the other day, just browsing around my carpet. I was trying to tell Lauren this (for SOME reason) and the story escalated to the point of insanity. You know, the type of conversation you only could hope that the government is tapping into and thinking they've finally pegged some terrorist using code language about junebugs to plan some attack. So here's this Junebug, coasting along, and I had no heart to kill him. I've killed before and it would seem I would be able to kill again, easily, but no. So I got a paper towel and placed him out on the balcony to once again be out in his own element. In telling the story to Lauren, however, the Junebug somehow became a mayor. With a closer look, I imagined the reason I spared his life was because he was dressed so dapper. He was wearing a BIG mayor hat, carrying a septor of sorts, and kinda marching along.. Not really walking. I imagine that he will take the paper towel I removed him with back to his people as proof that he did indeed travel to foreign lands. Much like the Wizard going back to Kansas, he will tell his people of his travels and the great things he saw on my carpet. They will admire him, re-elect him, consider him their hero, and then build a house for him out of that very paper towel. One day I will be walking Boomer and I will pass that house, and see Mayor Junebug of June-Bug City giving me a thumbs up. We'll both smile, laugh a bit, and wink at each other."   But you see, in my story, very much like Gulliver's story, Mr Junebug mayor would've been treated as an infidel at first, sent to trial for lying and accused of being crazy. After a lengthy trial they would've discored the paper towel which would've been proof that he was telling the truth. Being saved from impeachment, his popularity would've grown so much that he would've gotten re-elected. Keep up the good job Mason!

        so this weekend my roommate and I decided to go see   urlLink The Stepford Wives  depite the not so good reviews it has been having. I mean, it's got Nicole Kidman and Glen Close in it. You know, I found it was a pretty good comedy. The problem is that from the trailers it seems like it was going to be a sci/fi thriller.   Something that caught my eye from this scene towards the end of the movie it's the huge painting hanging on the wall that turns into a screen. The painting was actually The  Expulsion from the Garden of Eden , by Thomas Cole.            Expulsion from the Garden of Eden    Thomas Cole.   c.1827-1828. Oil on canvas.  The Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, MA.  Thomas Cole co-founded the Hudson River School of Art which established Romantic landscape painting in America. Cole believed in the artistic theory of the Grand Manner, which held landscape painting as a low form of art. For which his solution was to  ennoble  the landscape, in this case telling the biblical story of the expulsion of Adam and Eve from the Garden of Eden. One of his most famous works is the  urlLink Course of the Empire

        GRESHAM, Ore. - (AP) An Oregon City doctor will spend two months in jail after he advised a patient that having sex with him would help her pelvic pain, then billed the Oregon Health Plan for his time during their sessions.      Dr. Randall J. Smith, 50, must also perform 200 hours of community service and pay $1,105 in fines as part of a plea agreement, Rodney Hopkinson, a senior assistant attorney general for the Oregon Department of Justice, told The Oregonian newspaper.   Hopkinson said Smith, who worked as an osteopath at the Adventist Health Clinic-Rockwood in Gresham, also was sentenced to 18 months probation by Multnomah County Circuit Judge Julie Frantz on Monday.   Smith voluntarily surrendered his medical license to the Oregon Board of Medical Examiners on March 4, officials said.   Hopkinson said the woman told officials that Smith told her massaging her "trigger points" would alleviate her pain. Eventually, he said, the therapy involved sexual intercourse.   Smith told prosecutors that the sex was consensual, Hopkinson said.   Adventist Health fired Smith and reimbursed the Oregon Health Plan about $5,000 to cover the cost of the claims, according to spokesman Monty Knittel.    I say the bitch should be incarcerated for being so fucking dumb. My favorite part of the article is "Smith told her massaging her "trigger points" would alleviate her pain.  Eventually , he said, the therapy involved sexual intercourse." Plus, $5000! WTF that was a very expensive lay.

        what's up with this heat? It's only 8 A.M. and already 82 degrees outside and the high is expected to reach 100this is crazy; yesterday walking from the gym to get something to eat before my exam review session I thought I was going to die from dehydration.   Speaking of crazy, yesterday while I was bored in class I realized I am a little cuckoo. I have 4 pens of different colors that I use to take notes, IM taking International Trade Theory and we have to draw many many graphs with indifference curves, P.P.C.', Supply and Demand curves, so you need different colors to be able to differentiate with curve is which. But I digress, I was saying I realized that each of the pens have to have the cap on in the same position as to align with each other,  urlLink here is a picture to illustrate this .   I sent my friend cell an SMS message telling him about this, he says im not crazy, that im just obsessive compulsive. and thats when then I started to think about other weird things I do, for example when doing laundry, the t-shirts have to folded preferably right after they are removed from the dryer using a clipboard for the t-shirts as to get even shapes. The jeans hanging in my closet have to be organized by shades/color. Sleepless t-shirts, t-shirts, short and long sleeve shirts are to be hung in groups, each with its own.  in the kitchen, hands need to be washed at least three times  while  handling chicken and one final time after disambiguate all surfaces with lisle wipes. Only diet Pepsi can be consumed, if diet is not available, any other pop will do -it doesn't have to be diet. In school, when I pick a seat I HAVE to seat in that same seat throughout the whole semester, even if this means that I have to be 15 mins early for class everyday if the room is too full. When going out, only black underwear can be worn. If working on the computer, email has to be checked at least every 10 mins (yes im a loser).

        interesting weekend this turned out to be. It wasn't looking too good when we discovered after leaving the usual bar on Friday night that  urlLink Mexinick's  new  urlLink audi a4  got keyed while parked right in front of the bar. That bust was followed by an even bigger one when the next day, visiting Phoenix for a quick shopping trip and britnick's "pre-house warming party" we stopped by the Audi dealership to find out that the whole side of the car needed to be repainted for the bargain price of $3000.00. Thank god I don't have a new car, or a car at all for that matter.  I really enjoyed this trip to phoenix, Nick's house is looking good and I was very happy to see him and his partner Bill still going strong. Long distance relationships are really hard to keep up, especially if you live 2700 miles away. I know I couldn't do it, I tried it before and I only lived 100 miles away from him.   I've been thinking a lot about the future, I have to say that im starting to freak out. I have all these plans and I know pretty much which paths IM going to take. The big uncertainty though, it's HOW am I going to do these things. I have to take 15 credits this fall and I will have to bust my ass working somewhere so I can relocate by the end of the year and after graduation. I have to establish connections with people in San Diego if I want that internship. My friend Michael brought up yesterday a very important detail about this internship, this is an UNPAID internship, which made me freak out a little. I really need to work on some skills, I haveto find some other job where I could potentially transfer to San Diego or were I can get some highly marketable skills.  *sigh* I worry, but I know that at the end things always work out how they are supposed to. I've always been lucky enough were things might not work out the way I want them to, but they always work out for the best. I just need to keep my hope and fight for my dream.

        I remember when I was a little kid one unsettling afternoon, as I was getting ready to devour a hot dog that my grandma had kindly prepared for me, I discovered with horror that we were out of ketchup. How could this be!! I thought to myself; I was so upset I wonder what would become of me after eating this hot dog without ketchup. After thinking about my situation I came out with a great solution, I remembered that there was a house for sale right behind a McDonalds back in my hometown. So I told my grandma that she should buy that house and we should move in there. How perfect would that had been? I wouldn't ever have to worry again about running out of ketchup, because if we did I could just walk over to the fast food place and snag a few packets of the precious red sauce.  How easy that solution would have been, now I think about this it brings a smile to my face, how naive I was. As time has passed I’ve discovered that sometimes our problems don’t have easy solutions like that, but more importantly, I have learned that many a time our problems can be avoided by just taking care of and paying attention to little details. The key is to not let small things evolve into something that we'll later not know how to deal with, or that will make us take drastic measures.  Had I known this back then, instead of coming up with the bright idea of selling my grandparents house and moving to a new house behind McDonalds, I would’ve offered to keep a thigh watch over the bottle of ketchup to warn my grandma when was time to buy a new bottle and that way we’d never be out of the condiment.

      Well, here's the update from my trip to Hollywood this weekend. As some of you know the reason for my trip to Hollywood was that my recently graduated friend Michael had an interview for an internship in L.A. -which he had to turn down- and since he was driving all by himself I took the opportunity to escape the Arizona 100+ heat right before I had to go back to my scholastic duties, as my summer classes started today.  I have to say that I wasn't very sure -along with a few other people- if this trip was a very good idea. Since my ex Jason was planning on joining us on this trip to hang out with us. At some point I was afraid that this would just open up some not-well-healed wounds while at the same time I was pretty sure I was prepared to see him again (after 8 months since the break up). But thinking about the trip while on our way back to the Old Pueblo a phrase from the movie Pretty Woman were there's a man standing on the sidewalk of Hollywood Blvd shouting "Welcome to Hollywood. Everyone has a dream... What's your dream?"  Well, in a Hollywood perfect ending my dream would have become true and Jason and I would be happy ever after. Needless to say Hollywood does not equal reality, but reality sometimes overcomes fiction. And certainly what this trip gave me is bigger than what I could've expected. This trip gave me the opportunity to reassure myself that I still have a special connection with this person, that it doesn't matter how much time passes by, if we are meant to be together everything will be fine at the end. I don't know if he is "The One" what I do know is that he will always have a special place in my heart and I will always have a place in his. Do I see myself spending the rest of my life with him? I certainly do. Do I wish we were still together? I surely do. But I know that right now is not the right time and I have made peace with that fact.  I also know that there is the chance of destiny taking us in two different paths and if this were the case I'd still consider myself lucky for having had him in my life, for having felt this love for him and at the end I know I'll be happy just knowing that he is happy. Because after all, there's many people that go through their entire life without finding that special one with whom to feel identified, complete, loved, secure, protective. Just having realized this, having had this is bigger than other people's dreams.  I have a dream, what's your dream?

        well, im IN the heat might be a more appropriate title for this blog. It turns out that today we broke the 100 degree mark and as I was walking around campus, thinking how wonderful that heat felt I started to get worried.  You see, I am so used to these Tucson 100+ degree summers that I started to think what will become of me when I finally move to one of those cities from my dreams where the high during a winter day is from 20 to 30 degrees less than our high temperature. I am going to turn into a popsicle probably, I've never been fond of chunky sweaters or turtle necks, I do love long coats and scarves though. That might be a good thing, I don't know how I feel about beanies *sigh* oh well.  In other news, this weekend is started to look like it will be an interesting one. In contrast with last weekend when half of my friends either were away on vacation, visiting family or plain simply moved away. First and foremost, Tucson's newly self-made Nebraskan southern belle aka. Big john aka. John John will be in town for two days starting on Sunday. But before I will most likely make a quick trip to L.A with my friend Mike who's making this job-search-related visit and wants me to come along. We'll see how this adventure turns out. As long as im back in town on Sunday afternoon for dinner at la fuente it all be well.  Also, I was thinking how sad it is that im looking forward to go back to school already. After only a three week break I feel already as if im wasting so much time doing nothing but sitting on my ass and working 3 days a week. Lets just hope I still feel the same after a week of class, I gotta kick ass in that class. Wish me luck!

      if you haven't notices RS has a new feature, the "now reading" section on the right side of the site. In this part I'll try to keep you informed about the books im reading at the time, I say I'll try because when school starts God knows I'll have very little time for pleasure reading. But anyways, this summer so far I've read -as you might already&nbsp;know from previous posts-&nbsp;the Da Vinci Code (finished it this summer), Angels and Demons, both by Dan Brown. Then the  urlLink Life of Pi  and now I rediscovered  urlLink The Art of Happiness  by the Dalai Lama and Howard C. Cutler.   The Life of Pi was a very interesting book, this is the fascinating story of a boy who spends 227 days at sea&nbsp;with a 450&nbsp;lbs Bengal tiger after loosing his family&nbsp;on a shipwreck&nbsp;in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. This book is perfect for readers who like something reflective and filled with a spirit of inquiry. Gives fresh insight to the notion of personal freedom and responsibility as Pi makes peace through fear; packed with curious discussions on philosophy, zoology, linguistics and God. But in the end, it's the story you'll remember with a final twist that will leave you thinking about the wonderful capacity of the human mind to adapt to adverse situations as the instinct of self-preservation takes over.   What can I say about the Art of Happiness, I originally bought this book back when I was still living in Mexico -Spanish translated version- and for some reason I never finished reading it. When I moved away to college I brought it with me and a couple of days ago I stumbled upon it, I have to say that after reading just a couple of pages of the book I was already wondering why was it that I never finished reading it. The book, based on conversations that Howard C. Cutler -a U of A graduate who has a private psychiatric practice in Phoenix AZ- It gives you great insight about the search of happiness and the everyday life factors that can either help us or prevent us from experience that ultimate happiness that everyone seeks.

      Gustave Caillebotte was a french impressionist painter, born in Paris in 1848 to a wealthy family. Caillebotte's relevance to the impressionist movement is not that he was a great painter in his own right, but thanks to his economic status he was a very generous patron of the arts. He was friends with such great impressionist painters as  urlLink Edgar Degas ,  urlLink Claude Monet , Pierre- urlLink Auguste Renoir .   What calls my attention from this particular painting,  The Floor Scrapers , &nbsp;is the vouyeristic nature of the scene. It&nbsp;seemes like he hired these workers for his own personal enjoyment, another one of his paintings that would support&nbsp;claims of his homosexuality is  urlLink Men at his Bath &nbsp;Like the website says, nude&nbsp;bath scenes were popular&nbsp;from Degas' renderings but male nudes were very rare and&nbsp;shocking.  &nbsp;       The Floor-Scrapers      Gustave Caillebotte   1875  Oil on canvas  40 x 57 3/4" (102 x 146.5 cm)  Musee d'Orsay, Paris

      you know what really bothers me? people who post on message boards and dont even know what they're talking about. This morning i was looking at  urlLink IMBD.com  for updates on the movie adaptation of the  urlLink davinci code  and there seem to be some people that are convinced that the main charater, Robert Langdon is 46 at the time of the davinci code ordeal since it's apparently " urlLink clearly stated " in the first chapter of angels and demons that he's 45. Well i went back and read the chapter and it says:  &nbsp;  " Although not overly handsome in a classical sense, the forty-year-old Langdon had what his female colleagues referred to as an 'erudite' appeal -wisps of gray in his thick brown hair, probing blue eyes, an interestlingly deep voice and a strong, carefree smile of a collegiate athlete ." As you can see it IS clearly stated that he's forty, FORTY years old, NOT 45.  &nbsp;  Anyways, the matter at had was to predict the movie's cast, here are my predictions   Robert Langdon : Viggo Mortensen   Sophie Nevue : Julianne Moore   Bezu Fache : Jean Reno   Silas : Jake Busey   Leigh Teabing : still thinking   Jacques Saunier : Anthony Hopkins   Bishop Aringarosa : Tom Hanks

            So, big brother has been one of my favorite summer shows for a while now. but have you seen the new season? Holy shit! I got hooked since the  urlLink first episode , this week the "twist" they have going on is the "project DNA" that's short for Do Not Assume. Anyways, during the fist week two of the contestants found out they had the same father.&nbsp; Last year's twist was that they brought some of the player's exs, but this year seems to be more interesting.  &nbsp;  Another part of project DNA is the fact that one of the guests is actually two persons, that's right, its a pair of twins playing as one while the rest of the house has NO idea. I was so excited about it thinking that  urlLink Holly  was the one with the twin. I mean I knew that  urlLink Drew  (yummy drew) had an identical twin but since they showed this at the beginning of the show I didn't think it would be him. The reason I thought it was holly is because she's got a really cool thing going on -and I hope it is a facade- she's playing the dumb girl role so well, its hilarious! I love that girl.   Now, the whole "four horsemen alliance" thing its starting to get into my nerves,  urlLink Jase  and  urlLink Scott  have to go. I really hope these people realize this and get rid of them as soon as they can. More than anyone I'd like to see Scott gone. But going back to the whole twin thing, I was kinda disappointed to find out that  urlLink Adria  is the one playing with her sister. That bitch is doing a REALLY good job, im sure no one has a clue of whets going on.   urlLink Will , what can I say about Will. He's the token gay boy, I don't think he'll last long he doesn't seem like he has game, he better start looking for his ass or else he'll be gone soon. I think she should've kept his mouth shut when the girls approached him to ask him if he wanted to be part of their group and&nbsp;then they said&nbsp;they'll keep him&nbsp; and Drew around as long as they could. Im telling you, if Drew makes it far in the game it will be because he's so fucking hot that the girls will want him to stay.   &nbsp;

        at the risk of sounding like a complete looser I'll confess that I like going to school during the summer. In fact I don't think I've spent more than 6 weeks during the summer without taking a class in the last 5 years. Pretty sad you might say, but I like it. Better than sitting around doing nothing or going to work from 9 to 5.  School is so different during the summer too; sitting at the union having my lunch, people around me change from the noisy freshman living on campus and the Greek people socializing during their lunch break to mostly foreign students and faculty. The conversations no longer include topics like last weekend's parties, shopping sprees and superficial gossip. Instead I've heard conversations about politics, astrophysics, chemistry and tectonic plates. It almost makes me wish I hadn't changed my major from engineering.  Don't get me wrong I do find Economics very interesting, but sciences have always been an important part of my education. You see, Mexico's education system puts more emphasis on sciences than grammar or any humanities, culture or art classes. In Mexico you go to school every day from Monday to Friday from 8 am to 2 pm and you take 7 classes per semester and they all last 50 minutes every day of the week. I think this is the reason why I like summer classes too, that's the way I was used to go to school. And to think that it all be over in 5 months and 6 days. What will I do without going to school? I don't think I'll know what to do with myself.

        well, I have to say that my bday celebration part one was a success. The only way it could've been better is if all of my friends had been there -we missed you Rupa- but none-the-less I managed to get drunk off my ass and I really enjoyed it. I also want to thank those of you who took the time to give me a birthday card -mike, yours made me teary eyed a little, thank you buddy- and well, Derick you really helped to make my day a special one.  the night started at  urlLink Ra  where we had a very good dinner, by far the best sushi I've had in Tucson I really recommend it. Then we were off to the bar were we met most of my friends there where we proceed to have a lot of fun and I got highly intoxicated.  After the bar we were invited to a house party, to our surprised this was a lesbian party and we almost got strip-searched when we walked in the door. This one girl came up to us asking us if we knew who the party was, who did we know there and if we brought anything -which we didn't coz it was after 1 am already- finally Chris came to our rescue, thanks to our friend michelle who told him to come save us.   thank again guys, celebration part 2 will be next weekend when Rupa gets back!!!

        On this post I confess I have been captured by the  danbrownmania , It all started with the  urlLink Da Vinci Code.  This book really is a great thriller that combines actual historical facts, works of art and real places with fiction to create a great thriller story. The characters are very charming and interesting. The main character is  urlLink Robert Langdon , who is a professor of Religious Symbology at Harvard University in Cambridge. This is a really good book to read, but if you are lazy and don’t want to invest time on reading this book you'll be happy to know that they are currently working on adapting the book for a movie, Ron Howard will be directing it. They don’t have a release date but you can be sure I’ll let you know about it.  Now, although I think Dan Brown did a great job with the Da Vinci Code, so much that it made me want to read it's prequel,  urlLink Angels and Demons  I’ll have to say I became a little disenchanted with him as an author. I mean, don’t get me wrong, the book it's still pretty damn good, almost as good as the da Vinci code. The thing that I found disappointing is that both books have an awful lot of similarities. The plots are very similar, they both start with an older and very prominent/intelligent scholar/scientist being murdered, Langdon's co-star, the murdered gentleman's protégé a very smart, witty and clever woman with very specific physical attributes, somewhere in the plot there's a shady crippled individual, the police officers in both of the stories have more than one similarities, one's nickname is Viper the other is The Bull. But all in all, great books to read, very entertaining and hard to put down at times.  I am currently reading Angels and Demons and I found a very interesting passage that I thought I’d share on here. In this excerpt Robert Langdon is having a flashback to one of his lectures:   "Terrorism" the professor had lectured, "has a singular goal.”What is it?" "Killing innocent people?" a student ventured. "Incorrect. Death is a byproduct of terrorism." "A show of strength?" No. A weaker persuasion does not exist." "To cause terror?" "Concisely put. Quiet simply, the goal of terrorism is to create terror and fear. Fear undermines faith in the establishment. It weakens the enemy from within... causing unrest in the masses. Write this down. Terrorism is not an expression of rage. Terrorism is a political weapon. Remove a government's facade of infallibility, and you remove its people's faith."   I found really interesting his little lecture about terrorism although in other parts of the book he makes other claims that I didn't really agree with on this part Langdon has another one of his flashbacks to a lecture where he is discussing the borrowing of pagan rituals by Christianity:  “Conquering religions,” he continued, “often adopt existing holidays to make conversion less shocking. It’s called transmutation. It helps people acclimatize to the new faith. Worshipers keep the same holy dates, pray in the same sacred locations, use a similar symbology… and they simply substitute a different god.” Now the girl in front looked furious. “You’re implying that Christianity is some kind of… repackaged sun worship!” “Not at all. Christianity did not borrow only from the sun worship. The ritual of Christian canonization is taken from the ancient ‘god-making’ rite Euhemerus. The practice of ‘god-eating’ –that is the, Holy Communion- was borrowed from the Aztecs. Even the concept of Christ dying for our sins is arguably not exclusive Christian; the self-sacrifice of a young man to absolve the sins of his people appears in the earliest tradition of Quetzalcoatl.”    I mean I do agree with the notion of Christianity taking bits and pieces from other religions. In the past Catholic Empires around the world used religion as the ultimate tool for conquering the overthrow country and used their former religion as a base to imposing Catholicism. In Mexico, catholic churches were built on top of the Aztec temple ruins; all through Rome there ancient Egyptian obelisks still soared, only crowned with a catholic cross on top of them. But now if I remember correctly, Christianity was brought to be by the  urlLink Emperor Constantine  in the year of 302 CE. Now my question is how one of the most important rites in Christianity could have been borrowed from the Aztecs when Europeans and Aztecs were not in contact until 1500 years after Christianity was established? By the same token, the comparison between  urlLink Quetzalcoatl  and Jesus is irrelevant, there is no way one could have inspired the other. Like John would say; I’m just saying…

      Q: What's more annoying than a stupid Japanese girl's giggling sound?  A: a stupid Japanese girl's laugh.  Let me tell you, this summer class im taking has turned out to be an  interesting  one. There's this girl that's always hanging out with her fellow compatriots -all of the being boys- and im sure she's fucked at least a couple of them and the rest surely think of her during their morning jerk off. They all sit on the back of the classroom and they'll -meaning, she'll- whisper, giggle and laugh throughout the whole class. I don't think I've given so many dirty looks at someone during class in my entire college career. Not even to last summer's  urlLink Elle Woods  wannabe, come to think of it, I actually liked that girl. She wore the cutest shoes and I swear she had a dog in her purse, I was hoping I'll get to see her giving him some of her  urlLink Fiji water  during class break. She was actually very cute and she probably was loaded too. She'd go outside the building for a cigarette break and talk on her phone about her weekend trips. In a span of 5 weeks I heard her talk about her weekends in NYC, LA, and Chicago.  Summer classes can be very entertaining, you're there for 1:15 daily and you hear shit from everyone in the class. Sometime I'll tell you about the girl who unwillingly gave her own boyfriend herpes after sleeping with 3 guys during the week that she was broken up with him.

      As I mentioned in my previous post, I've had a relapse on my simcity 4 addiction. When im at home, its very likely that im playing and when im at work, since I can really play the game I've found  urlLink this website  and I spend the time trying to find stuff here in  urlLink Tucson , like the  urlLink U of A  or  urlLink Park Place . It's fun when you try to find your own house or a friend's place. Yes I know im a loser

      This weekend was kind of nice to only sit around and do nothing all day, as my roommate puts it, I have gotten a relapse on my addiction to  urlLink Simcity 4  I have experience what it feels like for ex-smokers to have a cigarette after a long period of abstinence. -you can check out some screens from the city I've been working on this weekend- I really can't remember why I stopped playing. It is seriously addicting, you start building roads, zoning land, establishing public services and next thing you know, 5 hours have gone by. Yeah I know I sound like a loser, but if you've played the game before you know what I'm talking about. You just can't help it.  But anyways, like I mentioned it before, this was a pretty mellow weekend. Derek and I went out to the bar on Friday night and got to hang out with some people we hadn't seen in a while. Rupee and Nick decided to stay in that night so they were the big absentees of the night, it's all good though. Next weekend my trip to Portland is in order, I'll meet Jason there and we're driving down the coast to beautiful San Diego, that little road trip should be fun; just in time for my summer class final. God I can't believe the summer's almost over, I have to confess that I'm already feeling a bit nervous about what will be my last semester of college.  I have been thinking a lot lately about my future, I seem to have figured out -for the most part- what I want to do when IM done with school. But there's this doubt that has gotten to me these past few weeks, is it really what I want to do? As I mentioned in a  urlLink previous post  -and also noted on the right hand side of this site- I am currently reading the book  urlLink The Art of Happiness  and there's a sections in the book called " Sources of Happiness " in which the Daley Lama touches the subject of happiness over pleasure and how many times people confuses pleasure as a source of happiness. Howard C. Cutler, the author of this book illustrates the issue with the story of a former patient of his, a young professional counselor in Phoenix, AZ. Who enjoyed working with troubled teenagers but was tired of the traffic, heat and many other problems in the city.  Her dilemma started when she was offered a job in a small town somewhere in the Midwest, this town that she had visited a few times before was her ideal place to be. She thought she would be completely happy living there but there was one problem. That was that she would be working with adults, instead of teenagers. She had spent a couple of weeks trying to decided but she just couldn't make her mind, she knew she wouldn't enjoy working with her new clients as much as she did working with young kids and at the same time she said "this would be compensated with the pleasure of living in the new town." She was happy with her current job, it was living in Phoenix what was causing her displeasure and she was about to make a decision based on pleasure, not happiness. At the end, the book says, she stayed in AZ working with kids.  The same kind of doubts come to me sometimes and I am stuck between going to grad school or taking a break and moving away to a place were I think I'd feel more happy (i.e. I'd "enjoy" more).
