      haiz... love sux manz... makes me so sick... ( lovesick ) although this blog not much ppl know bout it... i really hope those who knows , drop a comment or 2 , to teach me how to face this love difficulty...   dedicating the below song to those who treats me as their brother or a very good friend..    SAVAGE GARDEN LYRICS  "Truly Madly Deeply"  I'll be your dream  I'll be your wish I'll be your fantasy  I'll be your hope I'll be your love  Be everything that you need  I'll love you more with every breath  Truly, madly, deeply do  I will be strong I will be faithful  'cause I'm counting on  A new beginning  A reason for living  A deeper meaning, yeah   [chorus:] I want to stand with you on  a mountain  I want to bathe with you in the sea  I want to lay like this forever  Until the sky falls down on me   And when the stars are shining  brightly in the velvet sky,  I'll make a wish send it to heaven  Then make you want to cry  The tears of joy for all the  pleasure in the certainty  That we're surrounded by the  comfort and protection of   The highest powers  In lonely hours  The tears devour you   [chorus]  Oh can you see it baby?  You don't have to close your eyes  'Cause it's standing right before you  All that you need will surely come   I'll be your dream I'll be your wish  I'll be your fantasy  I'll be your hope I'll be your love  Be everything that you need  I'll love you more with every breath  Truly, madly, deeply do   [chorus]  I want to stand with you on a  mountain  I want to bathe with you in the sea  I want to live like this forever  Until the sky falls down on me      this feeling sux..

      Some friends are damn good at acting infront of u ... Some jus simply wan act big infront of girls. Most are jus normal friends that have fun with.  Some friends take good stuff from others le , den forget bout it , and during the period of time when he jus got the thing , he will treat u damn nice , but after which , once he forgets bout it le , he treats u as if u are no longer a brother jus cos u cannot go out with them...   Do friends encourage u to be defiant to ur parents ? Are these real friends ?   Some friends , even after taking money , they even thought of returning u ASAP , they keep in touch oftenly , and do not leave u behind or talk behind ur back , they do not ask for much , and usually treats each other equally. These Friends are the Good friends. These ppl , u can share ur problems with , and hang out with , even giving them money without asking much. As these are the friends i consider long-term friends, where they will never EVER forget u..  Well... i've always been generous , giving them whenever they need money , even when i do not get to eat the food at the chalet , i gave them , hoping that they cherish our friendship , but , sadly speaking , they took it for granted .   Haiz.. i really got nth to say le.. jus really dunno if i sld cherish the friendship anotz...

						   Love , is like ghosts , which many have heard of , but few have seen. It has been a very eye-opening thing fer me , as i fell in love with a girl , a girl whom wasn't supposed to be with me. And i have hurt her many times. I feel guilty , but , i really cannot do anything , except wishing her in all areas of life , and praying fer her... thats all... I've really tried my best to make it last long , but as people say , this kind of love wun last long , as love is not a simple thing... Love , four-letters , easy to spell , but difficult to get out of it... humans are physically strong , but they are mentally weak. Things happened too fast fer me to stop it... Wad's done , cannot be undone , maybe serperating is the best choice fer both of us ba...  Many of us thinks that love is just by being a girlfriend , boyfriend , but there is more to it... much more. So much that i cannot understand it totally.  Maybe at this point of time , someone can cheer me up ?   Hopes: To have someone to listen to all my troubles , problems , sovling difficulties with me... having fun together... is it alot ?    Why is it that my love life is so unsuccessful ?!?!?!  ARGH !!!!!!!!!

So i continued colouring while vincent packed up the wastes papers , and we hurried downstairs.

When we reached school , Mdm Sri wasn't there , so we talked to D&T teacher , Mr Wong , to help us be evidence that vincent did went to school.

						   Love is like ghosts , which many have heard of , but few have seen.  To love , it takes 2 , to kiss , it takes 2. To get angry , it takes 2 AND a reason. To NOT get angry , it takes 1.   Today may not be the day i was looking forward to , when i reached school , ppl tell me my ex-stead talking to a group of guys. And was jus too sick of it manz... As , we broke up jus last night.  Hey , its not that i jealous or wad... I also dun care wad u told others , and i also dun care bout whether u like others now a not... cos i dun wish to care anymore.. Tired , Sick. I once loved u , but maybe its time i gave up... its very difficult to coax u. You wan me to change , not to get angry over small things , but lie'ing to me is small ? If its considered small , den i've got nothing to say...u promised me u will never lie to me again , whether got or bad reason , but u still did... and it was within a month that u lied to me.  Its ok if u think i am a jerk or wadeva , as i am not going to care. After lie'ing to me , u expect me to trust u even more ? Tell me , Is it logical ? come'on , u are from the best class , u sld know better than me... somethings i know of are damn sickening , but i chose not to bring it up , but u always make me do so.. always making me so fed up.  Its not my fault that we ended up liddat. I've tried my best to change liao. i already dun get angry over those things... And yet u take advantage. I know u got alot of admirers out there , and i have none , but so ? i rather live a life of my own , be happy , and free. u may think talking to me loudly is not shouting , u may also think that i am always wrong , u also may think that i am the one controlling ur life. But have u ever thought of how u treated me ? U also made me not talk to girls wad , u also din want me close to girls wad.. any difference ? i dun see any.  Its time to make things clear. Go study , hard . Stop talking to me and u'll get over everything. treat me like a bastard or wadeva. So wad if i am always in the wrong , at least i got the courage to say " i am sorry " . Did u ever say that in ur first sentence ?  u expect me to coax u everyday , chase after u everytime. ever thought of how tired i get ?lol.. its ok now.. jus treat it that i was never in ur life and please dun ever return anything to me. Your books i will return it to u asap. meantime , dun call me le... after end of year exams over liao den we start talking again k ? i need time to settle down and study , i dun wish to fail again.  Wad a day i had ! haha. went to catch a movie with 2 ppl.(secret) lol !! studied chemistry halfway , some clever students din know how to do a maths problem , so i solved it for them , and they said i very " hao lian " .. LOL !!  write till here ba. Bye PEEPS !!  Priscila : thanks for cheering me on manz. Hope i am forgiven le ba ..
