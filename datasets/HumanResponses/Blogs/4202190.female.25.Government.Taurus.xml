          As much as I would like to write about the present, I find I still have quite a few things to rehash about the past. Let's just say I'M still working through my "feelings". ~me             1. Never Date a Guy Younger than Yourself      I dated a guy for 3 1/2 years, got engaged to him, and was happy with him regardless of how hard it was to be in a relationship with him. Lets call him fucktard, cause that's what he is. In the time that I spent with fucktard between the arguments and the kissing (to put it mildly), the lack of trust for me on his part, I learned the fickleness of men and the stupidity that is fucktard. Oh did I mention the 13,000 + debt of his that he left me to pay off.        2. Never Loan your Fiancee Money      ($13,000)       A word to those in a relationship; no matter how long you have been engaged with someone, or married to someone for that matter, never.... never enter into a co-sign agreement with them on their behalf; for a car or a loan... anything!   don't do it  .     If they can't get it on their own and its something for just themselves, you have to ask yourself... Why? Why can't they get it on their own? Poor credit? Less than full-time hours? A record of irresponsibility with money? thinking back on it, I really should have walked away at that point, but I thought I was in love and I thought he was responsible.    Boy was I wrong! For the entire time fucktard had that car ( a lovely Honda Accord with leather interior), it was never paid for, it got into more then one accident resulting in thousands of dollars in damages. On top of that, fucktard lied to his insurance company about damages, never paid his insurance on time and at one point started driving without insurance. To top it all off I was not aware of the fact that fucktard was fucking up so badly, every time I asked him about car payments he would say that everything was fine and that he was taking care of it. I didn't find out that he had stopped paying for the car entirely until I called the car leasing place myself only to find that they were on the verge of suing me and fucktard.      and who is the one is responsible? Me.       who ends up paying for the car, and doesn't even have a license? Me. in the mean time fucktard is "seeing other people" (ill get back to that)    When I did get the car leasing place to reposes his car he was mad at me because I told them to take the car back. and to this day fucktard has not made any effort to pay for the car or the damages, instead he sits on his ass in his social assistance housing with his social assistance unemployed mother and criminal brother, and does nothing. Oh did I mention he got fired from his well paying IT job with a major Toronto TV station? well he did. why because he was irresponsible .. and a fucktard.      For the entire time that I knew him, fucktard was getting paid a good large salary and not once in the 3 1/2 years that I knew him was he able to improve where he was living or save a dime, let alone finish his high school diploma, even though he had one .. one credit left to finish. I on the other hand have been paying for university on my own, and have been working part time at various positions for very little pay. YET I'M THE ONE PAYING THIS IDIOTS BILLS... WHY ? WHY YOU SAY >> AM I AN IDIOT ? Damn right I am!! I trusted a fucktard.. but why am I paying it? Because I have the integrity to keep my promises, and I signed my name to something making a promise, so I bite the bullet and pay the man $10,000 .       Mind you I will get around to suing factored fat black ass... though it may not be worth it since he can't get a job.    So where does the remaining 3,000 dollars come in. well in addition to the car, fucktard also got me to co-sign on a loan. Again little by little he would miss payments and I would end up paying because I would keep getting scary calls from the credit agency that loaned him the money. ( I also had to pay off $1,000 in gas and another $500.00 from a credit card on my own which he used, but I don't count that since at that point I just wanted to get away from him and be damned the money he owed me... mind you that doesn't stop me from trying to get it back now)    That was a year and a half ago, fucktard still has not paid a cent or acted responsibly in paying for the car or the loan. im finished school and almost out of my own debt and just starting my career in planning. I still have to put my plans on hold I still have to deal with an ex-fiancee's mess and until its over and done with I will still be bitter about it?    wouldn't you?      in closing the moral.   don't trust a fucktard

        Have you ever woken up one morning with the urge to plan?     I don't know who the hell would, which makes me wonder why I ever took planning as a feild of study in university. I have a horrible sense of direction sometimes, I have a short attention span and I don't have a very good memory. So why planning? well there wasnt anything else interesting on the university course selection sheet when I applied. and thus begins my career in planning.  I attended Ryerson   POLYTECHNIC   university, before they went and changed the name. i spent 5 years in a 4 year program only to come out of it with very little understanding of what planning is. Luckily I was hired in a city agency to work in their planning department as a research analyst and survey coordinator. its been a good learning experience. I still dont know what planning is, but im hoping I'll find out soon.   please stay tuned and pass the eggs.
