      Was looking up hard cases for my soon to arrive Treo600 (yes I know the 610 is going to be out soon, I'm not waiting).  One guy was asking about thoughts on a case on ebay and another responded:  "that case is just  fugly! "
 

Great word.

      From  All about circuits 
 

Take for example the mass of a proton, one of the constituent particles of an atom's nucleus:
 
Proton mass = 0.00000000000000000000000167 grams
 

Or, consider the number of electrons passing by a point in a circuit every second with a steady electric current of 1 amp:
 
1 amp = 6,250,000,000,000,000,000 electrons per second
 

A lot of zeros, isn't it? Obviously, it can get quite confusing to have to handle so many zero digits in numbers such as this, even with the help of calculators and computers.

      Hmmm, crumbs on my plate.  Was expecting brownies but they turned out to be bacon bits.  Still good, just surprising.

      I was going to complain how I had (in a fit of infinite boredum) done a  Google  search on xprise & scaled, so I could read about the up coming launch, but that after a few screenfuls of reading stuff that I had read before, I realized there were no navigation tools to get back to the Sprint menu.
 

But then it locked up.  I had to reboot.  Dumb phone.

      I bought some of that generic cerial in a bag from the grocery store.  I got crisp n fruity rice, not quite knowing what to expect.  Its sort of a cross between fruit loops and rice crispies.  But when you open the bag, all you can smell is lemon fresh pledge.

      Ok, so I have sprint with the data plan.  I didn't really expect much from the built in services (email, web, etc.) on my phone, and I haven't been disappointed.  One thing that's not too painful to do is to ge the weather forecast.  It only takes like four or five button presses.  But what I don't understand is if its called the  seven day  forecast, why does it only show me five days?

      A great list of parts that people need (mostly racing & bikes), that someone could make some money fabricating:
 
 hollow bolts
 front forks
 bolt sleaves (1/2")
 

The trick would be making up the tooling so each of these could be produced with a minimum of labor and wear on the cutting edges.  Hmmm, maybe those five lathes at the shop will come in handy.

Selling Web-based software through ISPs is like selling sushi through vending machines.
 
Sounds stinky.

      Lawyers are not happy just ruining the lives of people here on earth.  They've decided that its their destiny to set down laws for outer space as well.
 
Wherever man may go, lawyers are quick to follow, and for some decades now, a forward-thinking cluster of attorneys have their sights set on outer-space.
 

Space lawyers, however, insist that their immediate purpose is simple: to preserve outer space from the lawless free-for-all that characterized exploration and colonization here on Earth.
 

Oh yes, we'd be much better with lawyers running the show instead.  NOT.

 
In 1993 three Yemeni brothers filed suit against the United States for trespassing. The property in question? The planet Mars. The brothers claimed to have inherited the planet 3,000 years ago from their ancestors. The US sent attorneys to Yemen to fight the charges.
 

One space lawyer, Virgilu Pop, has claimed ownership of the sun. Mr. Pop registered his claim over the sun on April 28, 2001, and declared himself not liable for any damage caused by his property.
 

For some, however, the greatest mystery is what, exactly, space law will accomplish.

      So much for chicken for lunch:
 
When my boyfriend, a world-renowned doctor, gave me the grave news, I took it with the same 70-ton grain of salt with which I accepted his assertion that KFC had to change its name from Kentucky Fried Chicken because they used genetically engineered animals with no head and three breasts that scientifically were no longer classifiable as chickens.

      I sure miss the worn out soles of my old slippers.  These new slip on shoes with high performance treds may be great for traction on uneven surfaces, but they're sure a pain for trying to smash bugs.  It takes like five or six tries a lot of times just to get them.  And some of the things crawling around here in the basement are fast.
