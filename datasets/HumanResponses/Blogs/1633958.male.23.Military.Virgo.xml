        Hello Nobody!!!   and I say that in the nicest way. I mean If by some remote chance you actually are reading this Welcome!! But since this is my first post I'm doubting that. Well, having said that I'm going to press on and continue typing my night away while the rest of you are sound asleep. Its my blog and I'll do as I please. But anyway, Today I saw "The Day after tomorrow"..The movie, My name is Jeff, not Miss Cleo, I can't see into the future. Just in case you live in a cave and have never heard of it let me break down the story for you without giving too much away. Global Warming has caused a shelf to break off Antarctica, and as fate would have it  just happens to cause the whole North Atlantic current to change, spawning giant weather systems that devastate most of the earth sending it into a new ice age. This movie has it all, action, stunning visual effects, suspense...A love story. Would you expect anything else from Hollywood? From Titanic to Armageddon it seems like a disaster always has the uncanny ability to make wanna get it on while the world as they know it is crashing down around them. Now, don't get me wrong, I have no problems with love stories, its just that I don't really think they belong in every single freakin movie, but apparently Hollywood thinks they need to be there and I doubt that it will change anytime soon. Luckily,The love story in this movie doesn't really make me think any less of the film. I actually really enjoyed it, although I'm almost positive a hippie thought this movie up to make people think twice about burning the earth's precious fossil fuels. I almost felt like walking home...YEAH RIGHT! Anyways, check this movie out. Oh, and speaking of hippies, I'm pretty sure that somewhere, right now there is a hippie crying. Why you may ask? I just read that Phish recently broke up...I'm crushed.......Alright, that's enough of that..Ugh..I lost my train of thought. Oh well, I was going to write more but I am tired...So I'm going to bed

      So itrs after 4am on my day off and I'm still awake. Maybe its because my sleep pattern is all screwed up. Working 7pm-7am (you read right) will do that to you. Or maybe its because I decided to have my own mini Freaks and Geeks marathon. Or maybe its a little of both. I love that show, and plus I discovered that..Hold on, Viva La Bam is back on...Ok I'm back, I love Viva la Bam. But back to Freaks and Geeks, I was watching an episode tonight and they went to a punk club, there was a band playing. And it must've been my lucky day, because the band happened to be Santa Rosa, CA's finest...Diesel Boy, one of my favorite bands...SCORE! There is a renegade bug flying around my room, and its annoying the crap out of me. Just wait until I see it again..Game over...I will lay the smack down...With my sore arm and everything. My arm is sore from softball by the way. We lost by one today. Some people made some crappy plays and we gave up our 8 friggin point lead...What the crap? But oh well, I did ok out in right field. I made a couple of good catches, too bad my hitting sucked today...But I digress. I really like the Beastie Boys. Their newest album, to the 5 boroughs is awesome and their performance on the MTV Movie Awards was fantastic. I need to see those guys live! That was the highlight of the overall crappy show, the award intros were scary as hell, there were too many commercials, the other bands weren't very good, it was prerecorded. Worst show I've seen. And of course every hippie in Hollywood used it as a platform to support Kerry....Do people really actually believe this guy can change the U.S. for the better. I don't trust the man further than I can throw him, and I really should'nt be throwing anything with my back...but enough politics. I miss having a Chiropractor as a roommate...Dr Dave, if you read this I could use your services. I am here in WA, shoot me an e-mail. How bout them Lightning! I know you're happy about that, you crazy vegetarian, canuck!! And while we're on the subject of sports, I'm loving the NBA finals. Nothing better than watching the lakers get whooped!! Kobe, how does it feel? cuz the pistons just raped your team, buddy!! Anyway, I got an e-mail from comcast the other day. It turns out that since I signed up for cable internet I get the rest of the season free on MLB.com. I can watch any baseball game I want...Streaming live on the internet...FANTASTIC! I can watch my Giants!! Whooo!! Good quality too..Well its almost 5 so I think I am going to take a nap. So If anybody read this...Thanks...I need readers...ART...The ball is in your court now. I updated my blog...Your move - Jeff
