      Just confirmed today that I'd be going around asia a lot to do auditing. Well, most people go all the way out to European countries, but I guess asian region is equally nice.   Here's the deal. I get to see new places, but I've got to pen-in pages of reports after that. First destination - Philippines.  The ear which was supposed to be healing from the fifth piercing seems to be swelling again (it was swolen a bit after the pierce). It was either the extensive amount of eggs I've been eating or the itchy fingers. I think it's just both. Well, my last pierce was 4 years ago, so I wouldn't have remembered much about how to take care of it now would I?  At work, it's a debate between the ear-ring being an aphrodisiac or something that is addictive because of the pain. Then there was the discussion on which parts a woman would usually pierce vs. parts a man would usually pierce. One simple ring, one big hoo-ha. What would happen if I had a tattoo???

      Here's a link that I like from Foong Keaw http://www.theinterviewwithgod.com/ . Nothing religious, but some write-ups that I think is good.  Wonderful day today and yesterday. First time I've ever installed something important. And I'm not talking about graphic cards or motherboards in a pc, but an actual vision system used for production in a tester! Machine serial# S0112R0(6578).   Also, with reference to Fer's blog, the fifth ear-ring I have is healing. Can actually twist it without feeling a thing. Cool. I have a fifth ear-ring and I can touch equipment. Bring it on!!

      Why I strated this despite being a lazy goose, I've no idea. Guess it would do good for me to at least put my thoughts somewhere. June 1st - marks the day where I either started something useful or wasted the last few minutes trying to create something.

      This is madness!!! With the school holidays and public holidays during weekend, getting movie tickets to any shows is close to impossible.   Was queueing up for almost 1hr and 30mins today just to NOT get the tickets that I want when I reached the counter. It wasn't any of the patron's fault anyway. The ticket sellers seems to be ignorant of the long queue and was practically taking their own sweet time. I was told not to blame them as the crowd was totally unexpected. Well, duh! IMPROVISE on the situation!!  What was meant to be  urlLink Shrek 2 , turned out to be  urlLink The Day After Tomorrow , which was a pleasant surprise. The storyline was good, I must admit. The thing is, there's just too many computerized graphic scene, making it quite hard to believe. Also, the focus was in America, which brings me to think that the rest of the world is left to die. All in all, it was enjoyable and there are messages worth pondering over. At least I'm contributing to  urlLink WWF  every month.  The drive back Seremban was good. Road was clear (of road hogs and traffic). Met up with the Kah Thai, Boon Leong, Pad, Ah Fai, Fei Kei, Ling, Kin Teen, Chen Chen, Mi-chelle & Yin Shyan. That's by far the most people recorded in a yum cha in year 2004. Wished Fer was there, but she's having a slumber party at her current "bachelorette pad".  I should be sleeping now.

       1545 hrs : Arrived at NAIA (Ninoy Aquino International Airport) at Metro Manila. I must say that the MAS pilot was really skilled. The landing was hardly bumpy.    1550 hrs : The airport wasn't as big and as modern as I expected it to be. It sort of bears resemblance to the old Subang airport that we have at home. Walking down the aisle towards the baggage claim area, Parames and I were greeted by an Amex rep holding a placard "Mr. Parames & Mr. CH Lee". It had both our sex and my name indicated wrongly.    1600 hrs : Baggage claim was quick and so was the customs. The airport actually had lanes for bussiness related flyers and thus, the line to have my passport stamped was really short, compared to the rest of the crowded ones. Ratio was approximately 1:10.   1610 hrs : Catherine's pick-up wasn't pre-arranged by her company. She wasn't that pleased I could see. So she decides to join our pick-up and walked towards the car. As Catherine and I was fair, it attracted a lot of stares. We stuck out like sore thumb amidst the crowd of Filipinas. Parames on the other hand, was as light-chocolate-brown as them, so it didn't matter.   The one thing that I noticed about NAIA's pick-up waiting area is that it was seperated by family names. They had sign like "Waiting area for family names beginning with A, B, C, D" and a few meters away another sign would have "Waiting area for family names beginning with E, F, G, H", so on, so forth.   1615 hrs : On our way to the hotel in Alabang. The Amex hired car driver (left hand drive) seems to have an ambition to be a F1 driver! He was zipping through the crowded roads and in one two many occasions, almost went head on with an oncoming car. Parames was sitting in front quietly while Catherine who was sitting behind with me cursed quietly.   I observed the town that we were passing through. The rich had their houses built with significant Spanish & Malay influence, while the poor had houses, roads & shophouses similar to any kampung ("siau-di-fang") that we have in Malaysia. The contrast is clearly visible. Catherine and I talked throughout the journey. She's a fun person.     1700 hrs : We checked in to Bellevue Hotel in Alabang, Laguna. The 2nd 5 star hotel in the area. Catherine was trying to get a king size bed and her registration took quite some time. According to her, she needs a big bed so that she doesn't roll off. Parames and I on the other hand was busy checking for messages from Albert Escusa. Prior to this, I had no idea he was a Filipino. We had the bell-boy send the luggages to our room and tipped him 10pesos.      Note: Filipinas practices tipping and their service is one of the best I've encountered so far. There is no question about their courtesy and helpfullness.       1720 hrs : We hit the malls. You can't blame us really, the biggest mall in the area was 5 minutes away and Bellevue had shuttle service. Tried to leave a message for Albert but Parames didn't want to. We were supposed to have a short meeting between Albert, Boyet (whom later I found out his last name was Dioquino while hunting for his room number) on the audit.   1730 hrs : Alabang Festival Mall - First noticeble thing. They had guards at every entrance and bags were subjected to searches. (Also forgot to mention that it is the same at Bellevue entrance). The shopping mall was big and we didn't know where to start. Much of the stuffs that they sell can be found in KL, so we were just walking in search for something different. I found beed bags and bought 2, while Catherine got her key-chains. We walked about that decided that the supermarket would be a better place, so that we can see how different their food are.  At the supermarket, the 3 of us was wondering aloud which was the best brand of dried mangoes we should buy. I remembered 7D brand from the dried mangoes that bro's friend bought for us the last time and Catherine suggested we buy one pack to try. Was also looking for coke bottle for Raj. Too bad, the cans were of different design, but the bottles were the same. Spent money on the local cookies & junk food to bring home, and then called back to the hotel to have the shuttle bring us back for dinner (we couldn't find any good food around).   1930 hrs : It took us 5 minutes to drop our stuffs in the room and we headed out again for dinner. I wanted to try some local food, but Parames and Catherine was sceptical about it. The receptionist suggested Via Mare restaurant and to order for Crispy Pata, while the shuttle driver suggested Gerry's Grill and to order for the seafood soup & tuna belly. We followed the latter suggestion. I also mentioned my interest in  urlLink Balut ,in which the driver was too excited to get for me. Later I decided to decline the oh-so-good offer.  We took at least 15 minutes to search for Gerry's Grill at Alabang Town Centre Mall. After confusing the waiter, we ended up ordering seafood soup, sisiq, tuna belly and local noodles. Meal was wonderful! By the time we finished, most of the shops were closed. While waiting for the pick-up, I couldn't help notice how beautiful the Filipinas are, and how beautiful the mall is.   2210 hrs : Albert left a message for Parames and I to meet up for breakfast meeting at 0745 hrs tomorrow. I was thinking it would be too late for a meeting but schedule for audit was at 0900 hrs, so we're good. I was secretly hoping that the breakfast can be pushed to later hours, but I learnt in time that Albert wakes up as early as 0600 hrs, despite being jet-lagged.   2300 hrs : All clean and ready to sleep, I switched on the tv just to scroll and ended up watching till past midnight. Before sleeping I read a magazine about Philippines and found out that the sisiq I took for dinner (which I actually ranked as best dish) turned out to be pig's ear with liver. I almost threw up. Decided to switch off the lights and head to bed...

      I'm back!!!! "Paid holiday" a.k.a "tour" officially ends today. Reality hits and I've to be back to work tomorrow. Despite having the notebook with me when I travel, me, being the less tech-savy person had some difficulties hooking up to the net. The only time I really did manage too, I was too tired to continue. The next few blogs will be a recollection of things that happen throughout my trip.  p/s: Keat, when one works too long hours at work, blog is the next thing to sanity! aiya.. I blog tengah tengah malam ma.

      So I procrastinated again... Anyhow:-   0630 hrs : The bl**dy 99cents alarm rang (I made a point to bring my home alarm to Manila in case I can't wake up to any other ring). Slammed the alarm off so that I could have more shut eye.   0715 hrs : I suddenly woke up thinking I am late. Well, I am late. Supposed to wake up earlier to read through some materials before going down for the meeting. Guess I'd have to use whatever that's in my brain. Ran (literally) to the toilet to get cleaned up. Did I mention that I didn't have my toothpaste with me? Flossed like mad!    0735 hrs  : Ate some dried mangoes that I bought yesterday (trick to ward off the morning breath). Semi-dressed. Parames called asking me whether I'm ready to go down for breakfast. The usual SKL line, "I'll be there in a short while". She went off first. Got fully dressed, applied make-up with super speed, stuffed whatever documents that I need in the notebook bag and dashed off for breakfast.   0755 hrs : Looking dazed and disturbed, I wandered around the coffee house looking for Parames. Blur really cause she was actually waving frantically at one corner for me to join her. Finally saw her, went over, then met Albert and Boyet. Ooo..c-u-t-e.   0805 hrs : Meeting   0900 hrs : Leave for work in a MPV.    2115 hrs : Back at the hotel & work ends (phew!). Each was given 5 minutes to get ready for dinner. Catherine decided not to join us as she was done with dinner while we were working. Boyet had to prepare for some foils for his boss, so Albert, Parames and I decided to go ahead for dinner.    2125 hrs : Told both of Parames and Albert that I'd like to have something less "porky". Granted. We walked to another suite-hotel (approx: 10 mins walk away), which we were told to have a restaurant at the 35th floor. Supposedly we were able to marvel at Alabang town's night view. We'll see.   2135 hrs : Reached the Vivere Hotel and went up to the restaurant. WOW. The restaurant is unbelievable. So was the view. Tried to take some pictures. Didn't know how to switch on the night mode, but went ahead snapping anyway. Ordered spaghetti (!). The rest went along and ordered somewhere along steak and fish & chips. Dinner was nice. Talked mostly about work and people we know. Also, the two married ones talked about kids.   2245 hrs : Dinner ended and the 3 of us walked back. The street was really safe and calm. I was kind of expecting something else, as everyone was telling me how dangerous it is. I guess it was the Abu Sayaff thingy. It was a good walk after a rich meal.   2300 hrs : Reached my room and immediately took a bath. Logged on to the net to try and retrieve my mail. Failed horrendously. Other entertainment on the net was available, so why waste all the effort I put in to get online?   0030 hrs : zzzz...

      *haha*  This seems so weird. If you don't notice the nickname at the bottom to inform you on who wrote the post, you'd think our dear LC is self-promoting.  I wanted to stay up till 12.00am but then- sayang...dah tua. Tak tahan  staying up late (like as if 12.00am was ever late during Uni days!  So here's wishing you a blessed birthday! Have a good time on Saturday and *hehe* working on Sunday. I pray that God will grant you favour at your work place, protection in your everyday life as and health to keep on partying! *hugs!*  ---  Birthdays are just so exciting, no? You pretend like you don't know or don't want others to know but then secretly you're waiting for your friends to pounce on you - giving you a surprise party or somewhat. *haha* It was so common to celebrate everyone else's birthday in the UK that we ran out of ideas to "surprise" the birthday person by the time we came to the 3rd birthday planning. Ah! So the birthday person would have to act surprised.  I remember I fell asleep on my birthday...or rather, birthday eve. I know the girls would have something on but didn't know what. Anson was supposed to bring me to Asda to do some midnight groceries shopping (oh, how romantic! *swoon* HAHA!) and Jo kept delaying and delaying saying she needed to do her project. In the end, I fell asleep. It was goooooooooooood. I was too tired to keep up with the rest, as in waiting for 12.00am to arrive. Finally Anson woke me up, "Time to go to Asda." I should scan the picture of me holding the knife in a "I'm going to stab you!!!" way.   Anyway, I did get to go to Asda to do my romantic midnight groceries shopping - at 2.00am!

      Sometimes when you make a mistake, it might never be enough to say sorry. When a person lost trust in you, how would you be able to gain it back?  &nbsp;  I may never be able to answer the above. I don't know how I will ever do. Action speaks louder than words and I do hope that is one of the way to gain back the trust.  &nbsp;  I did a dumb thing by lying to the same person twice. Lying about the same thing as well. Well, it does show you that an educated person is not neccesarily wise. We haven't been close ever since and now I miss this dear person. Why did I lie? Well, no matter what the answers are, the fact is, I lied and that's it.  &nbsp;  We lie about everything since young. Whether it's harmful or not, it's always up to the one who's lying to determine. Fer, remember all the times when we were praticing for marching competition, then our mothers would ask, "Are you sure you got time to study ar??"  (Or something like that. Memories do faill me sometimes)  Instantly we would resort to all the lies. We got off real easy then didn't we? I guess the older you get, the&nbsp;more vivid the lies become and the more hurt the person who's being lied to will feel.  &nbsp;  I must start to remember that the  truth will always set you free...

      ha ha.. I was intending to put that up anyway, but I guess my best friend got to it faster than me! You know there is one significant thing about SKL members, is that we have sort of a thick skin. Fer, Mi-Chelle, Chui Shyuan and I are just lucky that McD's in Seremban has yet to paste a "banned" sign for the 4 of us.  Birthdays have always been wonderful. Sadly enough, I have yet to host my own birthday party. Will probably do that when I'm like 60 or something. Why 60? All the major milestones; 12, 16, 18, 21, have past anyway and the next big thing is to actually celebrate that I am alive! :). The first birthday party that I attended was at the age of 12. It was Mi-Chelle's and I think she still has that candid shot of me dancing. For years I intend to burn it out of embarresment, but thinking about it now, I seriously wonder whether I would have the guts to act as silly as I did back then.  It's strange how we the more we grow up, the more worried we get. I personally worry about how people at work would think when I decided to get a fifth piercing, how immature I'd be labbeled if I decided to whine about bad things at work and so on. Heck, sometimes I forget to please the most important person, ME!  People say that you shouldn't look back and stay in the past. Sometimes, you've got to look back and remember what you're missing in life now. F-U-N.

       Here's something that one of my colleagues wrote for two of his chicks. Very touchy-touchy, but nice.     &nbsp;     Little Something for my Ivy   ---------------------------&nbsp;  Standing across the street light smoking,  Regale me O Priest! Little Wings and Holy Ghost in Heaven,  Sadly, impression of those never be ideal,  You, however give me closest feel of that,  Reckon, Juliet’s story shall not be compared,  Nor the greatest love story be replaced,  But ours, in my decent and shallow mind,  Will be forever remembered to last eternity,  Will be closely cherished for legends to tell,  Will not be forgotten by tide of time,  And will not be ignored by God,  For you, dear Ivy, I would let my life fly,  Standing for you in the moments of dire,  Cause if I don't, meaning of living will not exist.   Alexander Emmanuel KT Soo,  in the darkest hour of summer '04    &nbsp;   &nbsp;     Wendy's sonnet   ==============  Sweet scent of English summer hypnotized me,  Spring sweet rhythms vibrates in my head,  Soul I have, peace I obtained,  Still your present precedes the ecstasy of me,  Your smile is hard for millions to deny,  Your warmth kept winter's wind at bay,  Have I been comparing a summer day to thee?  Or have I been shunted by autumn chill?  But thou must have been sure,  As I dedicate this written sonnet to you,  For 24 years ago must be spiritual,  Maybe the next 24 years would be too,  So long that this stays, so long live time,  And time dictates and gives life to me,  Happy 24th birthday.   Penned down on the 6th day of April,  A.E.K.T Soo

      Gawd.. been ages since I last updated this. I saw Spiderman II last weekend. The part where he couldn't produce any cob webs, I think most of it was accumulated here...  Anyways, the thing about doing jobs last minute is that it gets real frustrating most of the time. Just when you thought you had everything done up properly to the very last minute detail, some big shot has to take a look at it the very last minute and decides that "Hey! That's not what I really want. Why don't we just re-do it?" Hello??  Well, you could guess just as much what happened. But really, shouldn't jobs be reviewed much earlier before a dateline? I wasn't so much pissed at the fact that I needed to change things last minute. What frustrates me is that 2months ago, people who gave the green light on the job actually kept quiet and unanimously agreed that I got it wrong! Idiots.. and working with them can actually kill.  A colleague once told me that we need idiots around us. Why? just to make most of us look good :).  I've no idea how this blog might offend people, but I do hope that one day the idiots that "made my day" today would stumble across this and realize that I'm talking about her / them. Hah!
