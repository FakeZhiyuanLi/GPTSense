          One of my favorite animals is a dog. I like dogs because they are very playful and energetic. You can dogs real easy to me. You can treat a dog almost like a person. My favorite wild animal is&nbsp; cheetahs. They are the fastest four leg animal on earth. But I wouldn't want to Have one of those for a house pet. This animal looks so lovable and you just got to have one. This animal is a tiger not just any tiger a white tiger. I really won't one of&nbsp;those. This is one animal I wouldn't won't to have this animal is a   MONKEY !

SHE GOT ON CORNY RIDES LIKE THE TEXAS TWISTA. THAT RIDE WAS CRAZY BUT IT WASN'T NOTHING COMPARED TO THE X-FLIGHT, I MEAN YOU HAVE TO LAY&nbsp; BACK ON THAT RIDE IT LOOKED LIKE YOU WAS GOING TO HIT THE GROUND OR SOMETHING. WE GOT ON ALL THE WATER RIDES, AND WE WAS IN THE WAVE POOL. A COUPLE OF PEOPLE&nbsp; WAS DROWINIG. WELL GEAUGA lake DON'T GOT NOTHING ON CEDAR POINT.
