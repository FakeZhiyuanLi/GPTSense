       I could stay awake just to hear you breathing  &nbsp;Watch you smile while you are sleeping   While you're far away dreaming   I could spend my life in this sweet surrender   I could stay lost in this moment forever   Every moment spent with you is a moment   I treasure Don't want to close my eyes   I don't want to fall asleep Cause   I'd miss you baby   And I don't want to miss a thing  &nbsp;Cause even when I dream of you   The sweetest dream will never do   I'd still miss you baby   And I don't want to miss a thing   Lying close to you feeling your heart beating   And I'm wondering what you're dreaming   Wondering if it's me you're seeing   Then I kiss your eyes And thank   God we're together   I just want to stay with you in this moment forever   Forever and ever   Don't want to close my eyes   I don't want to fall asleep   Cause I'd miss you baby   And I don't want to miss a thing   Cause even when I dream of you   The sweetest dream will never do   I'd still miss you baby   And I don't want to miss a thing   I don't want to miss one smile   I don't want to miss one kiss   I just want to be with you   Right here with you, just like this   I just want to hold you close   Feel your heart so close to mine   And just stay here in this moment   For all the rest of time   Don't want to close my eyes   I don't want to fall asleep   Cause I'd miss you baby   And I don't want to miss a thing   Cause even when I dream of you   The sweetest dream will never do   I'd still miss you baby   And I don't want to miss a thing   Don't want to close my eyes   I don't want to fall asleep   I don't want to miss a thing

      ______________  Momma loves her baby  And Daddy loves you too  And the sea may look warm to ya, Babe  And the sky may look blue  Oooooo Babe  Oooooooo Baby Blue  Oooooo Oooooo Babe  If you should go skating  On the thin ice of modern life  Dragging behind you the silent reproach  Of a million tear-stained eyes  Don't be surprised when a crack in the ice  Appears under your feet  You slip out of your depth and out of your mind  With your fear flowing out behind you  As you claw the thin ice

Is this not what you expected to see?  If you wanna find out what's behind these cold eyes  You'll just have to claw your way through this disguise  [Pink:] "Lights!" &nbsp;"Turn on the Sound Effects"  "Action" &nbsp;"Drop It.

      Everybody's waiting for something to happen  Everybody's waiting for something to see  Lunatics waiting for bigger diadters  Everyone's waiting for news on TV   Winding lives at the end of the spiral  Waiting dictators with their next big thrill  Everyone's looking but no one is listening  Everybody wants to be in at the kill   I wait for the signs, they tell me true  I see the signs of the end of time   Everyone's searching but nothing's revealing  Everyone's looking for the reason why  Everyone's hoping for life everafter  Everyone's looking at death from the sky   Everyone's nightmares are going to happen  Everybody's ripping the mask from their eyes  Everyone's praying but no one's believing  Everyone's heroes tell everyone's lies   So I watch and I wait  And I pray for an awnser  An end to the strife and the world's misery  But the end never came  And we're digging the graves  And we're loading the guns for the kill   Can the end be at hand?  Is the face in the sand?  Future memory of our tragedy   Can the end be at hand?  Is the face in the sand?  Future memory of our tragedy

      Button your lip. Don't let the shield slip. Take a fresh grip on your bullet proof mask. And if they try to break down your disguise with theirquestions You can hide, hide, hide, "I'll tell you what, I'll give you three blacks, and play you forfive ..." "Ta! You was unlucky there son" "Time gentleman!" Behind paranoid eyes.  You put on our brave face and slip over the road for a jar. Fixing your grin as you casually lean on the bar, Laughing too loud at the rest of the world With the boys in the crowd You hide, hide, hide, Behind petrified eyes.  You believed in their stories of fame, fortune and glory. Now you're lost in a haze of alchohol soft middle age The pie in the sky turned out to be miles too high. And you hide, hide, hide, Behind brown and mild eyes.

      Humidity could be felt on the walls  Touched with the palm and used to scare  They used to sweat, they used to stink  Everything swamped and hot  But in the corner, Laying on a bed  A cold piece, made to stay alive  Trapped within its body   It could not think anymore  Thoughts of times of sanity  The world was isolated  Where the sun would salute him  And the night was violent  Fear and guilt  Invade the corners of the room  Pain was felt constantly  They keep on destroying   It could be seen through the window  The eye of disgust and scorn  When you hear the laugh of a madman  That's about to die  To suffer alone in disgrace  His hate is his own  Always hating being alive  Sarcastic Existence

      ================  I got my head, but my head is unraveling Can't keep control, can't keep track of where it's traveling I got my heart but my heart is no good And you're the only one that's understood  I come along but I don't know where you're taking me I shouldn't go but you're reaching, dragging, shaking me Turn off the sun, pull the stars from the sky The more I give to you, the more I die  And I want you And I want you And I want you And I want you  You are the perfect drug, the perfect drug, the perfect drug You are the perfect drug, the perfect drug, the perfect drug  You make me hard, when I'm all soft inside I see the truth, when I'm all stupid eyed The arrow goes straight through my heart Without you everything just falls apart  My blood wants to say hello to you My feelings want to get inside of you My soul is so afraid to realize Every little word is a lack of me  And I want you And I want you And I want you And I want you  You are the perfect drug, the perfect drug, the perfect drug You are the perfect drug, the perfect drug, the perfect drug You are the perfect drug, the perfect drug, the perfect drug You are the perfect drug, the perfect drug, the perfect drug You are the perfect drug, the perfect drug, the perfect drug You are the perfect drug, the perfect drug, the perfect drug  You are the perfect drug, the perfect drug, the perfect drug You are the perfect drug, the perfect drug, the perfect drug You are the perfect drug, the drug, the perfect drug  Take me, if you want Take me, if you want Take me, if you want Take me, if you want  Without you, without you everything falls apart Without you, it's not as much fun to pick up the pieces Without you, without you everything falls apart Without you, it's not as much fun to pick up the pieces It's not as much fun to pick up the pieces It's not as much fun to pick up the pieces Without you, without you everything falls apart Without you, it's not as much fun to pick up the pieces

Mil veces y una más juraste que ibas a crecer y solo una vez más creciste hasta morir sin ver la fiesta terminó no te pudiste controlar mil golpes y uno más la noche te volvió a pegar esta noche es hora de que pienses en cambiar el tiempo pasa pronto y todo tiene su final pasa, pasa, pasa, pásame un vaso más volvamos caminando pero elijamos el lugar  Noche de calor en la ciudad ella te dejó y todo sigue igual. quisieras volver el tiempo atrás pero lo que vuelve es esta noche y nada más.

      No se bien que día es hoy solo se que te vi salir y en cinco minutos perdí las letras para hablarte a vos  Yo se que no tengo palabras y nunca las voy a tener por eso aprovecho esta noche ya ves, estoy solo otra vez  Por eso aprovecho esta noche tal vez lo puedas entender que no me importa poner las letras solo me importa mi mujer  Mañana cuando te levantes y pienses lo que dije ayer ay viejo, en este juego a mi siempre me toca perder, siempre  siempre habrá vasos vacíos con agua de la ciudad la nuestra es agua de río mezclada con mar levanta los brazos mujer y ponte esta noche a bailar que la nuestra es agua de río mezclada con mar  A ti te quiero decir no te preocupes mi amor que yo te voy a entender que yo te voy a querer  Siempre habrá.....

      Maybe your luck has changed Settle down Maybe I\'m just deranged And on the rebound Maybe love was the thing Holding me back from all Maybe I\'m just the thing To break my own fall Take the rope to my heart and fall You may just be the last before you See the black tangled heart fall Maybe departure\'s good Makes room for more Start to mass produce For a chance to ignore Maybe you\'ll kill yourself Before I get a turn Maybe I\'ll fall in love And never learn Take the rope to my heart and fall You may just be the last before you See the black tangled heart fall Take the rope to my heart and fall You may just be the last before you See the black tangled heart fall

      Is everything a baited hook? And are there locks on all doors? If you're looking for an open book, Look no further, I am yours.  We'll behave like animals, swing from tree to tree We can do anything that turns you up and sets you free.  You're an exception to the rule You're a bonafide rarity. You're all I ever wanted; Southern girl, could you want me?  So come outside and walk with me We'll try each other on, see if we fit And with our roots become a tree To shade what we make under it.  We'll behave like animals, swing from tree to tree We can do anything that turns you up and sets you free.  You're an exception to the rule You're a bonafide rarity You're all I ever wanted;  Southern girl, could you want me?
