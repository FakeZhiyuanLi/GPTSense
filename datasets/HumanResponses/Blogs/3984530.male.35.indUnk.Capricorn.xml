      Well, here we are again with another portion of Spudd.  Today we're talking health. What are YOU doing to improve YOUR fitness? Are you able to prevent wobbly parts of your anatomy from scaring local children? Is your belly taking a peek at the world from under your shirt. It is?! Uuurgh!  I'm a fine one to talk. My weight has yo-yo'd so alarmingly in recent years that I only see my feet at sporadic intervals like Rugby World Cups and visiting comets.  Anyway, for the most part we live in a civilised society - I say for the most part because what I do in my own home is my affair. Is it socially acceptable to take up 2 seats with one arse on airline flights? Definitley not if I happen to be sitting in the second seat at the time.  It's true that there are people out there who are grossly overweight and are doing absolutely nothing about it. Should we judge them? Never.  What you consider to be an acceptable level of health and fitness (not to mention bulk) maybe completely alien to someone else. In many cases the individuals concerned are not happy with the way they look but there are a great many that are.  Imagine having that confidence in your appearance? They may be fitless wonders but it's their life to live as they choose. More power to their arm I say - they're gonna need it to shovel in a fourth helping of Mississippi mud pie.  Currently, I am embarking on a new fitness programme of my own. It's quite intense but only takes just a few minutes. You may like to try it if you want to tone up a bit.  This is how it works.   1. Do as many push ups as you can in 1 minute. 2. Do as many sit ups as you can in 2 minutes. 3. Do as many squats as you can in 3 minutes.  Top this off with 10 minutes running or power walking and you have pocket-size fitness plan for today's lazy git.   Over time you can try and beat your PB or increase the time limits for the individual tasks. Set a target for a months time and try and reach it but make it realistic. It would be disheartening, to say the least, to fall flat on your nose 50 push ups short of your target. Don't make it too easy either or the whole exercise becomes pointless.  Personally, I have some wheezing and panting planned for this evening. I won't be exercising exactly but I did manage to get a date with the the girl at the bakery so anythings possible!    SPUDD'S CHALLENGE: Re-acquaint myself with my feet without the aid of a mirror.  See ya next time chums...

      Astrology is a multi-million pound industry. In virtually every newspaper and magazine in the land you'll find some odd looking person with scary hair telling you exactly what kind of day you're about to have.   I wouldn't mind but astrologers have so freaked my mother that she's been too afraid to leave her house on at least 6 occasions since last March. This was most inconvenient for the developers who wanted to build a shopping centre on the site. They thought it was some kind of sit-in protest. It was a week before she came out of the bathroom and only then to hide in the cupboard under the stairs.  One of the most well known exponents of the medium in the UK is Mystic Meg, who looks like she's walked straight off the set of a Hammer House of Horror movie. She earned fame and notority in the 90's by telling us who was going to win the National Lottery but was then mysteriously axed when they didn't.   Another stars star is Russell Grant, the human beach ball. Today he told me, along with 5 million other Capricorns, that I shouldn't avoid dealing with taxes, insurance and joint finances. It may be stressful but they need attention. He went on to say that I'd have some unpleasant situations imposed on me if I ignore these issues.  Who the hell does he think he is? I don't tell him how to run his business dealings so why should I listen to what he thinks of mine? We all have opinions but to inflict them on the whole population everyday is taking the biscuit if you ask me. And he's had plenty of them that's for sure!  Now, I don't know about you, but I try not to place any emphasis on what my stars say but like a car crash, you can't help but gawp if you chance across them by accident. The above reading wasn't pleasant so I've decided to disregarded it. If tomorrow he says that I will inherit the Earth and a smashing little cottage in the Lake District I'll perhaps take that. If I don't get my birthright however, I may have to take legal action. His choice.  There may be scientific evidence that proves you can predict the future from the position of the stars when you were born but in the end, does it really matter?  Take this very moment in time. You could leave this page right now if you wanted...or not, and plod along to the very end of the piece. You could decide to throw your PC against the wall which I'd fully undestand - the writing today is just awful!   Alternatively, you could go make a coffee or go and fly a kite or fix that dodgy roof slate. These are all decisions you can make right now and you could change your mind a million times before you do any of them.  I guess what I'm trying to say is is that life is about choices. In any situation we can decide what we want to do. We may be afraid of the immediate consequences but if we know in out heart that the decision is in our best interest we should just do it.  Take your chances guys, we can achieve absolutely anything if we put our minds to it. I'm sure, like me, you wouldn't want your dying words to be: 'If only...' Thud!  SPUDD'S CHALLENGE: Don't die and fall in a crumpled heap with regret.  Another serving coming your way next week.

      In this my first blog, I shall be talking to you about dreams.   I can assure you right now that this will NOT be about the wierdy stuff that crosses your mind when you first wake up in the morning. Personally, I'm still trying to come to terms with the unnerving experience of seeing myself dressed up in an iguana costume, talking Estonian to my mother who's playing a piano on top of a wardrobe with Abraham Lincoln and bucket of custard. According to extensive research carried out by the country's leading sleep experts i.e. students, this apparently means that I'm having carnal thoughts about the new girl behind the counter at the bakery on the High Street. I can't see the connection myself but rather worryingly, they're absolutely spot on! She's a corker!  Back to the matter in hand. It's a greeny-brown substance and it looks like it might stain so I think I better go wash it off. Seriously though, your dreams, life goals and desires are vitally important to your future. Have you ever taken the time to map out the route for the life you want? It makes a lot of sense to write down your goals and sub-goals and set dates for when to complete them. Take some time now to brainstorm with yourself and write these out. Just let the words flow, you might be surprised what's lingering in your subconscious.  This exercise will help you look into your future with a lot more clarity. Is there a totally different career out there for you?  When you're satisfied with your list of goals, pin it onto a wall where you can see them regularly and keep a copy in your wallet or handbag. This will help you to focus on them and can be used as an incentive to keep you chasing the dream.   Another technique is visualisation - try to imagine now what your ideal life would be like. This can be very powerful and if you're willing to believe it, anything is possible.  If we had a life users manual, I would expect the words 'life is subject to change' to feature somewhere on the first page. Any manufacturers warranty would probably have a clause stating: 'We cannot be held responsibile for any dodgy decisions that either you, politicians, weather forecasters or any other enemies of the state may make'. Consequently, life can be a bit of a git at times.  Take last week. Just as I got enough money together to pay off my credit card, I managed to park my car at 30mph in my neighbours garden. In so doing, I mowed down his scale model of a Dutch windmill imported at great expense from Utrecht. I still say that I was doing him a favour as it was a bloody eyesore. However, I've now had to pay to have his lawn relaid not to mention fund the replacement of his blasted windmill.   The point is that all this was an unexpected life event, particularly for my neighbour, who is only now speaking to me through his solicitor. Plans have to be adaptable but not too flexible to the extent that nothing gets done. You may have goals that include learning more about the world we live in and taking time out for yourself to recharge your batteries. It would be easy, therefore, to put your feet up in front of a TV showing a documentary about the history of public transport in Senegal. Great - you're fulfilling 2 goals simultaneously, never mind the fact that you've got 3 weeks of washing piled up in your spare room and you haven't seen the lounge carpet since Christmas.  No, we need tangible goals where we can see the results and know that we are moving forward in the direction we want. Think of the benefits of being a do-er. If you cleared the spare room so that your clothes were washed and ironed you could choose the outfit you wanted to wear knowing with real confidence that there isn't a curry stain on the collar. You could then invite friends over to stay, maybe even the girl from the bakery! However, the goal in that instance would not be to invite her into the spare room but into YOUR bedroom. Actually, that should be my goal something else for the 'To-do' list!  SPUDD'S CHALLENGE: Improve relationships with people in the baked goods industry.  Later chums!

      Last week I spoke about affirmations and the benefits of standing and talking to yourself in front of a mirror, naked or otherwise. Well, today I'm concentrating on the otherwise and by that I mean clothes, appearance and grooming etc.  Are you happy with the image you're presenting right now? Is your personal hygiene up to scratch or is your personal hygiene CAUSING you to scratch?   Be honest now, do you need an industrial strength deodourant to keep the whiff of bodily odour at bay? If the answer is yes you're best off phoning me in advance before you call round so I can arrange to be away on business.   There is nothing so offputting of the smell of B.O. but to have it compete with the so-called antidote of an antiperspirant with a fragrance of mountain stream or summer meadow just will not work. These chemical concoctions are highly hazardous substances and lethal in themselves. They are no more environmentally friendly than the effluent being discharged from the municipal sewage treatment plant located next door to us straight into my garden pond. The goldfish were absolutely furious and the effect on their colouring has now put them breach of the trades descriptions act, 1968.  The sweaty stuff we call perspiration, is part of your body's cooling system and is natures way of helping you to cool down. It's not the sweat itself that smells, it's the odour caused by bacteria on your skin emitting rather unpleasant-smelling natural chemicals. (Urrgghh! Why on Earth did I choose this topic...)  'Yes Steven, I stink to high heaven. What can I do?' I hear you cry. Answer: TAKE A SHOWER MORE OFTEN THAN ONCE A QUARTER!  Seriously, a good wash in all those nooks and crannies every day should keep the problem a bay. Enlist the help of a deodourant that doesn't have the toxic symbol of a skull and cross bones on the side of the can and you're in with a chance.  Now for your clothes. Do they have more creases than Mick Jagger's face or are they more holey than the Pope?   Well, as we all know, first impressions count so if the people you meet haven't been comatosed by either your B.O. or antiperspirant you've made real progress. However, if you look like you've just crawled out of a spin-dryer you're unlikely to win any fashion awards.  We all hate ironing. Well, I thought we all hated ironing but there are now those sadistic types who are starting up companies all over the country to do your ironing for you. Mind you, I bet they're earning an absolute bloody fortune!  If you can get your clothes cleaned and pressed each week you will feel so much better about yourself. I let out a shriek of delight if I ever go to a drawer or cupboard and find a ready to wear item of clothing. I may have only bought it yesterday but at least it's not unpleasantly stained unlike the contents of my Mt Vesuvious washing basket that's errupting turgid undies and venomous socks.  A good rule of thumb is to remember that a clean, good-fitting pair of jeans and a sweatshirt will always look better than a dirty suit. That minging shirt was a mistake too and as for that tie well...  You get the picture.  Finally, It's also important to dress right for the right occasion. Your 'Monsters of Rock' T-shirt is NOT appropriate for a job interview or a funeral even if it is black. Likewise, don't make the mistake of wearing full evening dress if you're taking part in a swimming gala especially if it's hired.  SPUDD'S CHALLENGE: Don't wear Speedo's when going to the Opera.  Till next time, stay pong and crinkle free!  Steven

      Affirmations are free, easy and can be very effective. Repeating a positive phrase in front of the mirror, in the car, or writing it down on paper embeds it into your mind.  The following are just a few techniques you can use - I will come back to some of the others at a later date.  Mirror, Mirror on the wall...  Stand in front of the mirror and say positive things about, and to yourself like: 'I AM intelligent' and 'There is NOTHING that I cannot achieve' etc.   A strange thing happened while I was using this affirmation exercise. The mirror mysteriously fell to ground without me touching it and when I picked it up my reflection showed my face with 6 eyes, 3 noses and nearly 100 teeth. This was rather disconcerting as the mirror wasn't broken.  Some people recommend doing the mirror technique naked. This is fine in your own home but you're liable to be arrested if you start talking to yourself in an unclothed state in public. It's behavior that tends to be frowned upon by the vast majority of the population.  Exercise for body and mind  Particularly useful for those people on a health kick. Repeat your affirmations while exercising and they will become part of your thought process.   While running chant the mantra: 'With every step I take, I grow stronger - NOTHING can stop me.' However, be careful to avoid that raised paving slab on the corner of Prince's Street or you'll end up in a hedge. Look out for the Pit Bull Terrier on Mayor's Walk and the batty woman with the brolly on Oundle Road. On second thoughts use a treadmill.  Integration  While repeating your affirmation, actively think of ways to integrate it into your life. If your affirmation is "I have a great xxxxx": find ways of loving your xxxxx, improving your relationship with xxxxx, and best ways of achieving xxxxx.  The x's are intended as blanks but all they're doing for me is make me think lurid thoughts about the girl at the bakery!  Here are some affirmations you may like to try:  • "I am healthy." [That was my last burger, honest] • "I am happy." [I'm watching 'Bilko'] • "I take charge of my life." [at the extortionate rate of 26.9% APR] • "My eyes see clearly see the world around me." [except when I haven't got my contacts in] • "I am free." [Actually I charge £90 an hour] • "I am listening to spirit everyday." [It says: 'Drink me!'] • "I am wise." [That's a laugh!] • "I am a spark of divine love." [You've got to be joking!] • "I am beautiful." [Ha Ha Haaaa!!!]  So there you have it - get naked and talk to your reflection. Hmmm, which way is it to the asylum?  SPUDD'S CHALLENGE: Get a new mirror or stop taking hallucinatory drugs.  Until the next time, keep laughing. You can't help your ears being that big.

      Friends, I am suffering from a bit of back pain at the moment and am currently sat bolt upright on my chair with the aid of a garish surgical truss as support.   As a fashion accessory, it's about as cool as crocheted swimming trunks and has done me absolutely no favours at all with the girl from the bakery. I wouldn't mind but it was down to her that I'm in this state in the first place! Fnarr fnarr!   However, this situation has inspired the following piece on the benefits of having someone you can trust for support when you need them.  We all have to face our demons from time to time. Personally, I have been haunted on and off for the past 5 years now but if my ex-mother-in-law would only stay at her home where she belongs, we'd get on oh, so much better. She's coming over this weekend to see my former spouse and I am expecting a little visit from her too. I wish she wouldn't poke her nose in especially when it looks the way it does.  What I have to accept is, is that she is now my wife's crutch. She's the rock in her life and someone she feels she can turn to for help when her now ex-husband unfortunately burns her house down in a freak accident involving the installation of a new fire alarm. You should have heard the missus language - I won't bother helping next time.  The support that family and friends can give us has been prooved to be immensley powerful. Sometimes, especially in affairs of the heart, a third party may help you see a situation in a whole new light. I hear that marriage guidance counsellors and divorce lawyers have a lot of experience in this area too.  What about you? What are your demons? To move forward, we should all try to exercise the devil in our lives. He could do with a jolly good walk not to mention an overhaul of his personality. Let's face it, his people skills are non-existent, and he's so red in the face his blood pressure must be sky high.   Whatever you feel able to confide to a confidant, it is always good to talk. Arrange a regular meeting with a tried and trusted friend so you can share your thoughts on issues affecting your respective lives together. It's a way of helping each other and will increase the bond between you. You must remember though that, unless agreed otherwise, the detail should remain between yourselves.  Always remember that a problem shared is a problem halved or in my mother-in-laws case, quadrupled. Double-Grrrr!  SPUDD'S CHALLENGE: Try not to laugh at the wart on ex-mother-in-laws nose.  Another chip off the old blob next week. Byee!
