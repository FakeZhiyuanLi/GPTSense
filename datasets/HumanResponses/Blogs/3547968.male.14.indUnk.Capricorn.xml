      We're getting a kitten today at around 8:00 pm, Her name is Gracie and she is a Siamese Mix. Me, my dad, my sister, and my mom built our own "Kitty Condo" thing for her. Pics to come.   I saw Harry Potter yesterday, it was a pretty good movie, not the best I've seen, but not the worst. It's much better than the first two, much more action and cool stuff. Unlike my brother and sister, I couldn't tell if they left anything out of it because I hardly remember readingthe book, after it was over they were like "Yeah they forgot the part where blah blah blah." and I like "Oh yeah......that...part." Also, I heard everyone talking about how Hermione is "well past puberty" in this movie, but I honestly didn't see any "well past puberty" features, she looked like a thirteen to fourteen year old.   I've had trobule falling asleep in the last couple of nights, and no it's not my habit of watching tv until 12:30-1:00 am, which I've been doing for a couple of months now. I think the problem lies in something I call "Mental Chatter." (I may start rambling in this post, but try to stay with me) First off, I've found that I have a tiered conscience structure. The first level is concerned with things I'm going to say or am focusing most of my attention to. It's like when you listen to a song you've heard and are thinking the words to it. This level is easy to change for me because I can just change my attention to something else. The second level is like the first but it dosen't matter on what I'm doing. It's not based on my attention. If I have tacos, my first level will notice the taco smell, which then triggers the second to find the strongest memories of taco smells and then sends them down to the first level. My second level isn't a very "verbal" level, it's more of a working level. The last tier I know of is my third. It's the most complex of my tiers. It's the tier I get most of my "Mental Chatter" from. It's the tier that is always "on." It's the fastest of my tiers, it's a hard to describe tier. It performs multiple functions, it's like the deepest voice in your head. Like when you try to clear your head of thoughts, the third tier is the one saying, "This will never work," or "Need to stop thinking of things, aaaaannnnnddddd stop. stop. stop, st-dang!, need to stop thin-God Almighty! Just shut up!" and you continue that pattern until you go crazy. It notices stuff before my first and second are even aware of it. I hear my parents come home, my third tier goes through the millions of possibilites of where they went, what the got, and how long it took based on sound, time, and past events. If my parents get home around 6:00 pm, I hear a rustling plastic bag, I remember that my dad said he was in the mood for mexican food, and the last I remember them being home was at about 5:50. Then my third tier comes to the conclusion that they bought mexican food and were gone about 5 minutes. Then it sends it down to the second tier which then sorts through the possibilites of what they got and picks tacos. The second then sends it down to the first, which is by now aided by smell, and my first tier thinks, "They must have gotten tacos." Whew....now on to "Mental Chatter." "Mental Chatter" is when all three tiers are thinking at the same time and my mind is cluttered with thoughts and noise. My third will think of something random like, the number 12 and then it goes down to the second level, which then makes a result of 12 = Age-2 = years to master degree = needed to do anything in career path. Which then makes my first tier sad thinking that I still have almost my current and past life left in school. That then makes my third tier think of moving to a new school and leaving all my friends behind and probably not seeing them again, which then starts the process all over again while my first tier is still on the first subject. So my first is then split in half, then third, then fourth, etc, etc, until my mind is so full that my third tier "copies" this mental conversation and stores is in my memory and cleans my mental sleep. Luckly this only take about 15-20 minutes until my mind is clean and I fall asleep, it's nothing major,  it's just a nuisance. Like, I'm writing the original paper draft of this post on June 28 at 2:17 am to hopefully clear my mind. I've been thinking about "Mental Chatter" and the tiered structure of my conscience at nights, but my third tier isn't saving my thoughts on this, so they have been piling up, so hopefully this will clean the slate.   God, I just noticed how much I sound like my brother in this. :P

      Yesterday my family went up to the Blue Ridge Parkway and drove around for awhile and visited Linville Falls. One of the best things about going into the mountains is a little shop called "The Candy Barrel" they have over 500 candy varieties adn what you do is grab a bucket and go around the store picking up candy and then pay for it by the pound. I got one giant jawbreaker, one atomic fireball, and eighteen packages of sixlets. Sixlets are the best candy ever created by man. They're candy-coated choclate balls that come in packages of ten. Now I only have about 5-6 left. ::Sighs:: Candyer's Remorse.     I've been told to see the movies Dodgeball, I'm not really a Ben Stiller guy and I've seen the trailers for it so the chances of me seeing it are 1 to 1000. Then again I may miss out on a great movie. But I'm probably not missing a thing. I've also made my list of must see movies. 1. Shrek 2 2. The Terminal 3. Garfield 4. Farenheit 9/11     I've tried to learn how to write C++ in the last couple of days but I'm having my biggest problem with the C++ writer, I downloaded Microsoft Visual C++ toolkit 2003, but it's far too confusing and from my books it dosen't sound like the right thing to use for what I'm trying to do.  urlLink  Vertigo Software  has released a Quake II .NET build it yourself for C++ but Microsoft Visual C++ toolkit seems like a completly different program. If anyone out there knows anything about I'd like some information on what to use to write C++.  06/21/04

      I FINNALLY FIXED THIS FREAKING TEMPLATE PROBLEM!!!!!!!!! HUZZAHS ARE IN ORDER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Ok, now that I've got that off my chest I guess I'll explain. I got too pissed with that last template that I didn't post for a couple of days, but now I think I'll post more often. I still have a few color problems to work out with this one but it's basically my brother's template adapted to mine by my. I've added two new things to the site which are: The Halo Revolution Banner at the top, and the "Hail the Kremlin" flag thing right above this. These both have to do with Halo: Combat Evolved for the PC, if your on sometime, look for Kremlin Joe....that's me. That's also my name for America's Army but I'm pissed at them right now.

      Haven't really had anything to post about for awhile, so I'll just tap into the news. Today Yahoo is increasing their mailbox size from 4 megabytes, to 100 megabytes. This is in trying to compete with the new mail service Google is offering and I am beta-testing..ish. Gmail is by far, the best free mail service out there, they offer 1000 megabytes of storage , that's one gigabyte of storage. It's also much more of a laid back company, like if your trash foldrer's empty is says, "No conversations in the trash. Who needs to delete when you have 1000 MB of storage?!" and the spam folder says "Hooray, no spam here!" They also allow a filter function where you can search for mail from somebody. If anybody wants to try Gmail, just post your email, or send me it and I can send you an invitation.  Back to a more serious matter, I'm interested in Michael Moore's new film  urlLink Farenheit 9/11 , it states that George Bush was "asleep at the wheel" before 9/11. It also hits on things like Congress not reading the Patriot Act before passing, and then stating that they don't read a lot of the stuff they pass. It looks interesting and worth seeing. Then again so does "Shrek 2," and "Garfield," and "Harry Potter," but I haven't seen any of those yet. I should go see one and did somebody say Movie Hopping?

      Kinda fixed the font size problem by switching to a new template, there's still some bugs to work out, but you can now read the font a comfortable size. Nothing much has happened besides that. I'm thinking about getting a  urlLink Lomo  camera, either the  urlLink Seagull 205A  or the  urlLink Fed 5 B . So.......bye.

      Went online yesterday and customized two computers to meet what I need, one for $715 and the other for about $530. What I would like to do to is just by a new motherboard with all the stuff I need and put it in my Compaq, but my mom dosen't want me to save $400-$600 on "something that could break the computer." My mom is to afraid that I'm going to break the computer by trying to make it better. My biggest problem with this is that it's my computer, no one but me uses it anymore, and even I don't use it now because it's in storage. The motherboard I configured today at IkonPC, would bring it up to around the standard of our home computer (Sony VAIO), for only $145 dollars. Currently, I have $70, at the end of June I'll have $90, July $110, etc. I'm hoping on getting a job as soon as possible in Raleigh, possibly at a Food Lion that's near my house because I've heard they pay something like $7 an hour at first. That reminds me of what my brother is having to deal with. My brother has around $420 dollars in Graduation money, he'd like to buy an Xbox and some games for it, buy my mother would rather have him use it for college and spend it on books, for those of you who are in college or have siblings in college, you know that's about enough money for five pages in a book. Just if your curious, he's going to NC State to major in Chemical Engineering.

      Nothing much happened today........I think I've fixed the IE problem (If it's messing up for you please comment), had to show the house from 5:45 - 6:45(View Golfing Good Time Fun Post). Which then led to the fun time trying to find dinner with our two dogs with us. Ended up at a Wendy's, I had a Chicken Sandwich. Then we headed to Pilot Elementary to waste ten minutes. Once we were back at the house my dog had three seizures in about ten minutes, it was one of those moments where you want to pity it, but some of the stuff she did wsa pretty funny, (like trying to walk around with her left back leg up.) I had to laugh. She finally calmed down and went back to normal.

      We had to go out today and I spent most of the time doing something golfing related. At about two-ish I bought a new set of clubs and a bag at Play It Again Sports. It's a really nice place to buy hand-me-down golfing gear, the total cost was about $43. After that we headed down to Twin Oaks and played a nine holes. Pretty good course, the only problem is that the holes are most   I've played a little game with myself of guessing who commented on my first post, and here are my final guesses. (The 12:00 guess is probably a swing-and-a-miss.)  11:58 - Rebecca or Katie 12:00 - Maybe....Alex? 12:10 - Andy Bedingfield   Ummmmmm..... let's see.......Oh yes, another thing that happened today is that the offer that we put on the house that we wanted in Raleigh has been beaten out by another offer. Our house over there was on contingency. Which means, If our house dosen't sell, we can't move. We have 24 hours to have an offer put on our house, which reminds me that we had a showing we had today. My parents always talk about how they want to sell the house, but when out realestate agent calls and says that we have a showing in three hours, everybody panics. And you can't be home when there's a showing because apparently you make the room look bad. It looks like one of those shows where people come in to clean out other peoples houses. People scurrying around looking for the vacuum cleaner, anything wooden is covered in Pledge, and the scent of Windex fills the air. And during the time we are getting ready for a show, everybody's stressed. If you say one comment about anything, someone snaps at you.  And that's why we went golfing.

      This is my second day as a blogger and I'm willing to say I think I've got the hang of this. I've added some new buttons and, with help from my brother, moved off of blogspot. A big thanks goes out to   HTML Goodies,   they helped me with all the buttons and the soon to come ticker. The buttons are my favorite links on the web, and as you can see, the pink rabbit....thing...is my friend Alex Bowman's website where he makes flash cartoons.   Back to my life, today I went with my family around town to look for a golf bag for my brother. We searched through seemingly same bags at Sports Authority for a 1/2 hour, then we went to Dick's Sporting Goods for another 1/2 hour looking for a bag because my parents weren't impressed with Sports Authority. We finally found one and then headed to the driving range. We arrived about noon. Here's the schedule.  12:00 pm - Arrived 12:01 pm - Bought two buckets of balls and got ready 12:02 pm - Split the buckets five ways and teed off 12:10 pm - Ran out of balls and went home  As you can tell it was well worth the hour and a half (including travel) of buying a bag and driving to the driving range for eight minutes of golf. But wait it gets better!  After that we were hungry, we were contemplating places to eat when a genius idea struck my Mother and Sister, Panera Bread! The only time I've ever been in a Panera was when I was sick and couldn't taste a thing, today I found out I was not missing much. I've decided to put my complaints in an easy to read list  List of Hate 1. The atmosphere - To Euro, they try too hard to act like a cafe.  2. Menu - They have a menu stand in the middle of the ordering line and you don't get to sit and read it.  3. Chicken Salad Sandwich - My Chicken Salad Sandwich basically exploded the instant I picked it up, and the bread crust there is mix of dough and an unchewable alloy.  4. Drink Machine - I got over to the drink machine and all I saw there was Pepsi, Diet Caffeine Free Pepsi, Water, Fruit Punch, Mountain Dew, and thankfully Dr. Pepper. Happy on seeing the Dr. Pepper I put my drink under and pushed the button, BUT GUESS WHAT?! Instead of Dr. Pepper, it was filled with water! I poured out the water and then decided on "Sweet" "Tea", In short, it wasn't sweet and it wasn't tea, the flavor had a close resemblance to a smoothie made out of tulips. So I grabbed a handful of sugar and headed to the table.  5. Patrons - As I was walking toward the table I noticed the only people that ate here were fat people and a strange race of twig women. Panera Bread has to be one of the biggest diet places on the earth, and Panera Bread wanting to get money off the Atkins craze, has made a line of low-carb bread. Personally, the only way I see to make low-carb bread, is to make it out of bones which to me seems perfectly tasty! Another thing I noticed is that once one of the twig women finished a meal, they were already done digesting it and had to go straight to the bathroom. They were then seen exiting a minute later wiping their lips with a napkin which led me to think while they were in there, they must have put on make-up and were just smoothing it out.   And  that's  why I hate Panera Bread.

       Two or three days ago we went over to Raleigh to buy a house in Wakefield Plantation. I don't know when we are going to move in but I'm hoping it's not in the next twelve days. My parent's don't know how much this is going to kill my social life. They always joke about how I have no friends, because unlike my sister, I didn't hang out with them every day after school. And then they tell me, "Oh you'll make friends over there." But my main problem is that I am an introvert  .  I was digging through my brother's blog's archives when I came upon a post of his that bascially describes me and him.    "  I am an introvert. I hate meeting new people, and I'd much rather be in a group of two or three friends then a large club of people I don't like....Society hates introverts. Sometime in the evolution of American society, it was decided that the best person was one who enjoyed yammering on with everyone in the known universe. Introverts, those who prefer a life of quiet contemplation, a few friends of like interests, and deep academic focus, were left by the wayside. "    He then  urlLink goes on  to explain that socitey hates introverts and etc.(Near the bottom titled  Finally, some issues: ) I already have good, established friendships here that I've been working on for seven years and in one month they will just end. My mom says,"You can e-mail them or talk to them over the phone." 1. Most of my friends don't use computers that much, don't have an email address, or I don't know their e-mail address. And 2. I'm a man, men don't call people over the phone to talk to, only to say where they are going to meet or order something like pizza. The only friend I have contact with right now is Andy (Lord of Constatine or something)   Ok, now back to the subject of the house we are going to move into. I like the house, it's a great house. The kitchen is huge, gas range, new microwave, love it. (I like to cook, just watch  Good Eats  with Alton Brown). It's a nice layout except for the bathroom that I will be using upstairs. The bathroom I use now is very long. The width is probably about two armlengths and the length is probably four. The new bathroom has it where you enter into an area with the counter and two sinks in it,I'd say about the same width as mine but less length. To the left is a door, you swing it open only to find out that once it reaches a 90 degree angle, it promptly slams into the toliet. With the door at a 90 degree angle, there may be about three inches until you find the shower/bath base. You manage to work your way around the door and close it. You look at the shower, average. You find better bathroom layouts at Holiday Inn Express. You find that the easiest way to open the door is to stand in the shower and open it. You walk out and get eaten by a dragon. GAME OVER.   In my house now, I have the smallest bedroom. And I get the first pick of bedrooms at out new house. My problem with the bedrooms at the new house is that they have no windows, They either have a layout where at the corner of the room you have two windows on each wall as close to the corner as you can get. The only good windowed room is the smallest where there are two windows side by side overlooking the street. The room I'm thinking about choosing has one window. It also have a room of it for storage but me and my dad plan on finishing it and making it an extra room for me. So this is all there is basically about the house that will be my equal of a handbasket.

        If you haven't read my comment yet, I've added Ads by Adhearus (Link at top), to help support me fianancially(sp?), so if you just happened to move your mouse over one, and you just happened to click it, you could help me out :P. I was first going to use Google's Adsense, but my parents wouldn't let me because it requires a Social Security Number to register, while Adhearus only requires an address.          My friend has opened up a forums about the upcoming release of the game, Rome Total War. It also talks about previous Total War Games, and anything that has to do with History, so all History/Game nuts, go  urlLink here.        My Brother and his friend went to see Farenheit 9/11 tonight, I had a chance to go, but once again, I was stopped by my parents. Apparently the only reason it's rated R is because it shows one of those grainy webcam videos of a Saudi Execution. I'm starting to lose it, my parents and sister joke about how I'm on the computer all day, but I have to be on it. I can barely stand my sister anymore, the things she gave me over the summer was a temporary computer, and a mild aneurism. She's been criticizing anything anyone has done for about five weeks, it's been mostly placed on the helpless public or some figure of authority. If a person was in front of her while she was driving and he did something like slowed-down, sped-up, swerved or anything like that, she'd immediately think or say that the person was old or a teenager or something, then she'd do an impression of who she thought it was based on stereotypes. She also always acts like she's my parent, we had a showing today and my parents were in Raleigh so we had to clean-up the house. I helped on getting the dogs out to the dog run, moving most of the pet stuff, vacuuming the upstairs, and filling the dishwasher. My brother help by moving pet stuff, getting the dogs outside, emptying the dishwasher, and vacuuming the guest bathroom. All I saw my sister do was straighten the living room (which was already basically clean), and talk with her friend who was there to go to Spiderman 2 today. And I guess the main thing that annoys me about her is that when ever she is talking to someone and me or my brother say something, she always says our lines like a retard is speaking them, it dosen't matter what we say, we could say "Have a nice day" and she would trasform it into a stuffed-up, deep voiced, slurred voice. I stopped taking this crap from her about three weeks ago, I wouldn't be able to take any longer.

       I've had enough to post about for the last couple of days, so I guess I will.     I've just finished my last book for the Summer Reading list, now all I have to do is do the work, give me about 2-3 hours to work on it, and maybe 2-3 days for my Grandpa to respond to my E-mail about World War II. The book I just finished reading I got about 4 days ago, it's  A Seperate Peace  by John Knowles. It's a great book after you get past the boring part in he beggining. I"m pretty good at spotting when a plot twist is going to happen or who it's going to happen to, but I was completely off with the plot twist at the end, didn't even see it coming.       I've noticed I've had a lot of dreams recently, they weren't good or bad dreams, just dreams. I'll wake up in the morning remembering them, but after five minutes of being awake, they're gone. I usually don't remember them for about three days or until I see or think something that triggers it. I've tried to find the root of these dreams and I made a list,  1. They're just dreams  2. My late night, insomniac-like life has finally caught up    with me     3. Lupin the III is really crapping up my head everynight  4. The stress of moving is making me go crazy  I've basically narrowed it down to 2 and 3 now.     Up next I have a story of a lazy, roofing company. I know what you're think,  I know what you're think, "They were Mexican right?" sadly no, they were hillbillys. In May or June, we hired a guy named Glen to redo our house's roof so it can be a selling point. Well, he redid the roof, put in new shingles, showed us a Carpenter Ant infestation, and installed a new skylight in the loft. The roof looked great and there was much rejoicing. In about mid-June, a really heavy thunder-storm hit, we then noticed that the ceiling in my mom and dad's closet was leaking, and they're on the first floor. About a week went by when another storm hit, this time the closet leaked and a corner of the loft skylight leaked. We called up Glen and he came over and "sealed up the holes." A few days later, a light rain storm hit, no leaking, everyone was happy. A couple of weeks pass and then that big storm hits that was about three or so days ago, instead of just the corner of the skylight leaking, all the corners do, and part of the side. My dad called up Glen that night (My dad wasn't having a good night during this, kidney stone was working through his system) and he was furious,he  told him that if he dosen't fix this up, the next person he will be hearing from is a lawyer. So in short, just hire someone from like Home Depot or Lowes to do it so if you do sue them, you get a lot of money.

      I should post something, but nothing much has happened in my life. Whatever.   People don't seem to understand this of me, I don't like shoes. I hate them, they're so uncomfortable. I only wear shoes if I have to, like going to a store or a restaurant or something like that. People say, "What about outside?" Answer "Only occasionally." I'd like to buy a sock that has a rubber sole on the bottom and use it as my shoe.   I was engaged in a smiley war on the Halo Rev forums, and for extra artillery I found a great   urlLink smiley site . I also found the best smiley in the world.      Ummmmmmmmmmm.........................................................How...about..that... John-John ticket?..........Ummmmmmm.........Kerry's just using Edwards to appeal to the low-life hillbilly slobs in the back country (no offense). And the problem is is that most of America is either a super-liberal-tree-hugging-hippie or a low-life hillbilly slob(again, no offense). All the democrats are all like "Let's stop war and deforestation!!" But that's bad, war boosts up the economy, studies prove it. And if we stopped cutting down trees, we'd run out of power and paper, and basically everything else. Ummmmmmmmmmmmm..................yeah.....   S.A. signing out 12:41pm 7-11-04

      I'm in a bit of a pickle, I seem to have lost my Ragsdale High School Honors English Freshman Summer Work at Graduation. If anyone reading this has it, if they could please E-mail me a copy I would be very greatful. (Sterlic@Gmail.com). I know I'm moving, but we planned on being out of the house by know and I shoudl do it any way if they want to see it at my next school or something.   I hope everyone had a fun fourth of July and blew up a lot of stuff, I know I did :). If I was ever invited to a roman candle fight and was stupid enough to go to one, I'd bring the heavy artillery, you know, the big ones that they shoot off at professional events, that'd show 'em. :P   My biggest problem with this moving thing is that once we move, my brother gets his own computer, my sister takes her computer back to college (I use this one for blogging), and I get the main family computer. My parents won't buy my brother his computer until we move because, "We don't want to get everything set up and wires everywhere, then have to pack it all up again." I have an old Compaq (current personal CPU) in storage right now and I can pack that thing out and back in again in about 20 minutes. And since is was made around '97 it literally ways >30 pounds, it's like made out of lead! So since todays computers (desktops) weigh about 10 pounds, I could pack it up and out in about 10-15 minutes. The HP (sister's computer) has been my primary computer over the summer, I've been doing a lot of stuff on it like trying to make a map for Halo in Gmax and studying different C++ writers (The best I've found is  urlLink Microsoft C++ Express Beta 2005  for free). And would love to have the Vaio (main Computer) because the HP only has an on-board video card and a Voodoo card that's worse than the on-board so I haven't been able to play any game on it. Also, once I get the Vaio, I can upgrade it as much as I want which will be much easier than upgrading my compaq (aka - Keeping the Frame and Monitor and getting new everything.)   7/05/04

      A howdy-ho and a ho-de-hi there readers, this is coming live from room 204 of Holiday Inn Express in Raleigh. So now, the infamous question, "How was everyone's first day of school?", and for those attending College, we don't want to hear it. :-P. After running into a few snafoos with my schedule I think everything is set.  Semester 1 Marketing Small Business/Entreprenuership(SP?) H English 1 H Biology  Semester 2 Computer Applications H Geometry H US History "Healthful Living" (PE)  Fairly good School, Wakefield is. I'd say that Ragsdale has a better layout. Wakefield classrooms = less than or equal to = Ragsdale Classrooms, it just looks big because of the three stories. Fairly easy to get lost in too, especially on the first floor. Luch was probably the worst time because I didn't know anyone there and by the time I got to the end of the pizza line they ran out of pizza and I had to go across the Cafeteria to the other one. They order Little Ceaser's, some would say, "Oh man!! That's great!!" actually, "No, no it's not" Little Ceaser's must bake pizzas by the truckload for schools, so what they lack in quality, they make up in quanity. Pizza also seems to cost a bit. A large pizza costs about oh $8 bucks, seperated into about 7-8 slices. so about $1.14 to $1.00 per slice and they sell them for $2.00, so they make a pretty good profit off of that, but then I thought, Little Ceaser's has to offer them some sort of discount per pizza to order something like that. I figured about $5-$6 or even less per pizza. So in conclusion, they could sell each slice at a $1.50-$1.25 per slice. But they know that kids  need  pizza. So they decided that.

       This is just a quick post to compensate for the lack of content in my last post. Also there will be no yard sale.   I went and registered at Wakefield yesterday and applied for courses. Pretty nice school, huge cafeteria, food court, three stories. Only problem is finding the stairs and that you have to pay $120 to park and they choose your space. Previous Schedule:  :Latin I, H Bio, H Geometry, H Eng 9, PE/health, H Civ/Econ, Lain II, H World Hist . New courses:   Latin I, Healtful Living(PE), Latin II, H Eng 9, H Bio, H US Hist or H World Hist, Astronomy, H Geometry  , with Alternatives of,   Current World Problems(Debates), and Marketing.   What will be happening is that I will be staying with my dad at Holiday Inn until our house closes on the 13th and we move into our new house. So I'll spend about a week living in a Holiday Inn.....what fun. Atleast I don't have to help pack much :P.  P.S.- My biggest problem is the ungodly hours of it, 7:20-2:18  And in the words of Kelsey Grammer, Good day and good mental health.

       We should be having a yard sale this Saturday so if you can, or if you want, you can stop by and maybe buy some things. It's a 10 Swiftcreek court, Greensboro. Probably just a lot of old stuff, toys, and my bed.   I found a great site this week called  urlLink Sodaplay . On it you can make little polygon-ish soda creatures or something and get them to move around the screen or race. I've almost got it down on how to make one. The hardest part is making them stand up, then applying the right muscles in the right places.     I've finaly....finnaly...fenalli...whatever, I've found the  urlLink computer of my dreams . It has a customizable AMD Athlon 64 up to 2.4 GHz. RAM up to 1 gig. And almost every high-tech upgrade imaginable. I've decided that I'll only buy a computer that uses a AMD 64 processor, with all my other computers we bought them and they quickly became outdated, but with the AMD 64 you would never have to upgrade for a good couple of years. But..........I'll probably won't be able to gain the 200-300 dollars I need by Christmas or somewhere around there so I may just get a ATI X800 or the new GeForce Nvidia 6800, whichever I find better.     On a side note, it seems that I may move on or around August 13th. But if the cycle of Bureaucracy runs it's full course, it may be around 2012.
