      It was a delusion, sitting there, staring at the communion cup. my hands were sweaty as i twirlled my finger around the edge of the plastic container that held the representation of My God's blood. all of my sins that i have not repented for filled my hollow mind, eating at my selfworth. Everything that i was living for lately came poring into my mind, my ugliness was uncovered. I looked around the room, it was blurry,there was nothing to see, except blobs. blobs that stood as beings. i could not see a thing, and everything was uncomprehendable, i felt like a million miles away from life.what was life? A million miles away from comfort, i could no longer grasp what comfort was. I sat staring into no where contemplating the silence, my head began spinning, i was dizzy. my thoughts were captivating my whole entire body, and i realized i had become numb. numb to the world around me. I felt the cup slip through my hands, i gazed down, and saw "Jesus' blood" spilt among the clean carpet. everyone was looking at me now, i couldn't see them but i felt it. i felt their eyes. and i felt their shame over me. My head began throbbing, and at any minute i thought my head would explode. My head would combust, at any moment......i took a deep breath....and opened my eyes....back to reality. fantasy gone. whos to say fantasy is good

      And there is no place I would rather be, then away from you. Away from your thoughts on life, away from the air that you bring. Free of what you think of me. Free of your arrogant comments. The way you think you know me kills me and there is nothing I want more then for you to leave me alone. Nothing I want more then there to be a stillness between us. And every time you talk it kills me, it kills me to see you acting as if you’ve done nothing wrong. You’ve done everything wrong. The way you walk so guilty kills me, the way you ramble on about unintelligent concepts kills me, and I hate it. I hate the way you feel bad for yourself. Go ahead drown yourself, drown yourself in a pillow of tears. I don’t care tonight.  	All this time I have wasted trying to make things right, trying to get you to the finish line, trying, trying with everything I have. I should have known this race was going to be futile I should have known that you would be stubborn. I should have known. I should have known your ignorance. 	And we call this fate, fate that we weren’t together, fate that we weren’t right. Fate that things ended up this tragic. Go on lets play the role of a tragic heartbreak, We tried. I tried. You tried. It was an incessant series, a cycle that tore us of our innocent. And we came to the point where we knew nothing would be right again. We came to the point where we tried too hard this time around.  	So we stare at each other with an awkward feeling, there is too much emotion there anymore. Too much to make me run away. I am completely unbreakable. Without a sign of being concerned. He knows I don’t love him he knows I don’t care.. He knows. I am GONE.

      I wrote out of anger and passion. I wrote to him because he killed me mentally. He tore me down to the floor to watch me rot out of my arrogance, to watch me wither out of my lack of knowledge, to see me hurt. And I lay here and cry, and watch these tears slice my cheeks one more time. He’s out there, he is gone, not thinking about me, not thinking about the pain he has caused me.  	Everything is spinning around in circles and he knows it. I saw him for the first time. I ran to him with a decrease of control and grabbed him tight. I forgot all of the hatred towards him. I miss you he says. He declares this because he knows my spirit. This is what my heart longed for. Taking my shoulders he grabs them…As to wake me up from my dreams. I thought that’s what was happening. A rude awakening I was not completely ready for. He took me and looked and me “I love you” he states. My body becomes fatigue and I feel weak in his presence, and the whole world seems to be looking at me waiting for a response. Waiting to see if I will shatter or stand strong. I shatter I can’t turn my back on him, I couldn’t get myself to, even if I am stronger then the pain. I don’t want to turn back, he gave me a comfort, he gave me a sense of worth, a different sense of worth. Something I hadn’t felt in a long time 	His smile makes me bitter and everything about him makes my blood run cold, and I feel faint in his arms, and he must have known this because he clutched me tighter and told me he missed me again. And I want all of these thoughts to connect from my mind to his. I feel like they do, and I feel like things are right once again. I don’t feel a void deep inside me, for that very moment I felt whole. 	He had to go, they were waiting, as I saw him leave I realized I was incomplete once again. He had done it again. What  was I thinking? What was I thinking. I left myself out in the open vulnerable to pain, vulnerable to his emotions. I was left naked and stripped of my character. He knew me. He knew me more then I wanted him to. THESE TRAPS OF INSANITY. These traps of unholy, unworthy things. I let myself get involved in.  	I sit there shaking, telling myself incessantly, I’m wrong its wrong. I can’t get myself to believe what I say. I can’t get to the point where I am free of this confusion, how could I? Its harder then what they say, its harder then just goodbye, its harder…  THESE TRAPS OF INSANITY

      Lately, I have forgotten everything I am, everything I wanted, and everything I was to become, everything that once meant the world to me, now seems purposeless, it all seems aimless.  My existence is a cycle a corrupt cycle, and I find myself adjusting to these world set standards, that i have been trying to so hard to break away from. The cross slips my mind. I forget the past, forget the weeping, and forget the torment that He went through.  My eyes have shut this last past two months, and I have blocked what i wanted out. Things that i used to starve for, i find myself turning away from. Slowly, and barely noticably. I am waiting in anticipation, that i will soon awaken from this hellish nightmare, it will all be over. And the pain will be gone, my conscience shall be clear.  As for now I sit in this silence screaming room, and pray, pray, pray..... Pray that I could have the motivation to draw near, the motivation to fall upon these sinful knees and cry out what is right. I only wish i could have the fire that i once had, the faith that i once had. The heart that i once had. The love that was embedded in my heart so deeply.  Oh, i know within this empty soul, i will be back,  back to the heart of worship.
