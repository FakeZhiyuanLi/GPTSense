      ...thursday night,feelin' alright...  When I was walking to the co-op to do my shift tonight, I was totally overtaken by the mood sifting through the streets.  It was very damp out, and hovering in that moment right before it starts misting.  This air brought out all the smells hanging around. The main one I thought I could distinguish reminded me of homemade soup and a thick slice of bread.  I could have sworn we were nearing the end of September more so than August.  The leaves are already drying up and twisting off of their branches.  I walked by the open door to a bar, not quite ready for business, and caught a whiff of cigarette smoke.  It's one of those moments where it's a comforting smell, reminding me of friends and lost loves.  This is the kind of evening when a hand made quilt is necessary along with a pet to give you kisses.   Then I remembered it's a Thursday.  I wanted to be back in high school, when I had the Thursday night crew to look forward to.  I got invited to it when Channah and I became friends.  It was usually just a few of us, but sometimes more if folks were back in town.  We always got together at Jamison's house around seven o'clock for good coffee, conversation, and an arthouse flick.  I loved being there, especially on those colder nights.  Jamison would hand roll cigarettes and put on a pot of coffee, while his family's big standard poodle, Caesar, would clatter around.  We would eventually put the movie on, and then have to reluctantly amble home once it was over.  It was almost always Nilufar, Jamison, Channah, me, Cecilia, and Saskia, Isaac, Margo, Mindy if they were in town.  Sometimes others came too.  After some time, we wouldn't even do stuff centered around the movie.  We might make dinner, or smoke fruit flavored tobacco from the sheesha pipe Jamison had from living in Egypt.  One summer night we had a sleepover and swam at midnight.  Afterwards we crawled into the car to go to the grocery store to fill that hunger that only swimming can give you.  There was also the night (headed back from a movie?) in Jamison's station wagon where it was pouring rain, and on Lowell, his windsheild wiper gave out.  Everyone stuck their heads out the window to see the road.  Tonight, years later and living in Brooklyn, everything aligned to have all of that flood back into my memory.  What's sad is that I am not in close contact with any one of those people currently.  There are no hard feelings, and when we run into each other it's always nice...we just all got busy...

      ...keepin' a look-out...  Yesterday I saw lots of interesting folks all around town.  Making my way up the stairs to our subway platform, sweet sounds of a mandolin and a steel guitar hit my ears.  Usually, people do not play at our station, so it was a nice morning treat.  Waiting for the train, I saw the guy with two light blue puffs of hair that I had seen walking home the evening before, as well as the punky, pale, colored hair, lesbian couple I had seen on the train the day before.  As I emerged on to the street at the 23rd street C/E station, I ran into Jacob who I work with on his way to a bagel store.  On 22nd street in between 8th and 9th ave., the old man who is there every morning exchanged smiles with me.  During lunch, I saw an interesting fellow in a red shirt with tons of rubber bands around his sleeves holding in various bulky objects.  It was a unique solution to not carrying a bag.  The train ride home was the usual squish of business folks, loud teenagers, little kids, etc.  On the corner of my street, I ran into a guy who works with me in childcare at the co-op.  He doesn't even  live in the neighborhood.  Okay, so...yeah.  That entry was probably only worthwhile to me.  I just enjoy human watching.

      ...shake your money maker...  Man, I should really not work at a bookstore, because I just keep running across things I want to have in my bookshelves.  I guess out of all addictions I could have ended up with, books is not such a bad one.  I have learned much restraint. I need to spend some time making books.  I haven't made one in quite some time...Now I have a work surface that is all mine (though the cats are trying to claim it like everything else!) and no excuse not to start MAKING something, anything.  My head is waiting for a blank piece of paper.

      ...red in the face...  A weekend beach escape was great...courtesy of the DiCarlos.  Fire Island is really perfect.  Even though it was cloudy on the main day we were there, it was perfect.  I had the ocean all to my self for a moment in time.  A seagull cried out a warning as I noticed a constellation of sand on the back of my hand.  It was such a heartbreaking, grey, beautiful day.  Of course, today was perfect in a different way...the sun was out, the sky was BRIGHT, the waves were fantastic.  Luckily, we got to enjoy it before we took the ferry back to the air-conditioned rodeo-of-a-city we live in.

      ...space seed...  Tonight I am babysitting Georgia.  She is four going on five, and never ceases to amaze me with the things she thinks about.  A couple weeks ago we were playing with her legos.  All of them are the usual red, yellow, green, blue, except for one that is shiny and silver.  She held this particular lego in her hand, turning it around slowly, and said, " I don't know where this came from."   I thought she simply meant she couldn't remember who gave it to her, but then she continued,  " I don't know how we got here, how this planet got here."  It took me a second to respond, but then I did with the usual, " Well, everyone has a lot of different explanations for how things got here, and no one is either right or wrong.  It's still a mystery."  After a little more elaboration, and a couple moments of silence, Georgia decided it had to be seeds. ... Then she was only interested in what buildings we were working on.

      ...i am awake...  Cat in my lap, husband actually asleep before me, a productive day behind me, a bug just flew into view and I think I killed it - I'm not sure why, empty mason jar wanting to be full, bladder wanting to be empty, ol' clunky chugging away, barefeet patting on the linoleum, allergies found my forwarding address, heard some cicadas today!!! - didn't know they existed here at all, drew an anatomically correct eyeball to embroider on a pillow, did dishes to tool - one of the best bands ever, started a new book that Joan recommended - Empire Falls, been on a cooking jag, figured out part of an amelie song and a byrds song on the melodica, watched the teen choice awards while drinking wine and coffee, talked with my sleepy sister - today was her first day back teaching, prayin' for rain.

      ...what can you offer...  Do you ever think about how riduculous money is?  How were we all made to believe that simple pieces of paper and metal actually hold power, and are worth working for?  It's a spell of mass proportions.  What if we went back to trading object for object?  I do not know if that would necessarily (is that how it's spelled?) be better, but just think for a second...What things would totally disappear if we did that?  I have no clue.  Would there still be people who made cars, or appliances, and what would you have to do for them in order to get one?  To some, playing a heart breaking song might be worth thousands, but to others it could mean a years worth of crops, or free access to your body, or a baby, or a fantastic meal.  It's all relative.   Do most people even know how to make anything anymore?!  If it came down to it, would people re-learn to spin yarn again, weave fabric, and construct clothes?  Would more people learn ceramics, or how to build things, or whatever?  I guess money is convenient in that everyone has something they know how to do and they get paper for it to buy the things they do not know how to do, or the things they do, but just don't have time or energy to.  Has money made us uncreative and lazy?  It' s a vicious cycle of having to have it, even for basics, and having to work way too much for way too little.   What about the concept of plastic = money.  What about the stock market?  Our money isn't even physically backed by gold anymore...Imaginary, huge numbers.  What was it that Nasa just lost track of in space?...something that cost them four BILLION to build!  Did that money even change hands?  I seriously doubt it.  Man, we are so far gone. Okay...so now you know what a Sunday morning of too much coffee can do to me.  Actually this is part of my mind all of the time.  I've got to go buy groceries...

      ...do a little dance...  Today is much better.  All of my future work is lined up and ready.  My only babysitting is picking up a really fun girl from school every day, and other than that, I am working at the Dia!  Art books, whee!  A weight has been lifted.  I have another book to recommend...this one is a kid's book, and is fabulous.  It was introduced to us by our friends the Freelings *The Grey Lady and the Strawberry Snatcher by Molly Garrett Bang *  So good.  Alright...I promise to be more exciting soon.

      ...oy...  Is there a full moon on the rise, or is there nothing to pin everything bad/weird on?  It's too hot to even care about anything...of course, I care about everything.  Man, even the cats are getting in on the craziness.  They want so bad to run outside.  I keep trying to explain how sorely disappointed they would be when they discovered  - man, I swear to something that Jeremy just! broke his favorite glass, I broke one earlier that's not even ours, I got a small shard in my finger cleaning it up, and Jeremy got one in his foot...things have got to get better right? - that there is no grass, not many birds, and hostile streets.  The cats just don't care.  They are like me, every place I should not be at the moment.  Anyway, do not fret dear friends.  It's just one of those days.  We'll see how things are when the fog lifts in the morning.

      ...in times of trouble...  Sometimes I like to make lists of things that make me happy:  anything involving Jeremy, stormy days, big sweaters, dandelion fuzz, driving through the southwest, a lovingly made meal, spending the day with a book, mail, the frenzied moment an idea strikes, working with wire, dancing to records with our cats, old suitcases, photographs, thinking of, or seeing my family and friends, frozen grapes on a hot summer day, spoons, when smell brings back a memory, history- familial and otherwise, multiples of small things, weaving, drinking from mason jars, sitting on the front stoop watching the world go by, talking with kids, wood floors, overalls, seeing them burn the prarie in Kansas, magnets, finding the cats in bizarre,small places. ...I'll stop tormenting you now;)

      ...new york struttin'...  Saturday was a perfect Brooklyn appreciation day.  It was a great temperature out, and I got out of the house early.  Jeremy and I walked to his new place of work (a children's bookstore - locally owned,) which was having it's opening day.  I bought great kid's books, headed to the co-op for guacamole and pico de gallo materials, and sauntered home, bothering to stop and look in windows of stores I do not normally take time to.  Then it was phone calls, Jeremy came home for a bit (too many people working,) pico and other food making, last minute cleaning, a frosty glass of water...Suddenly food is ready, our neighbors are over, good breeze shootin', and friends from Colorado come in to town.  Perfect.

      ...dusty books...  Yesterday I was wandering through various photo albums, when I came across the pictures of euclid trees in Australia covered with maps from the scribbly moth.  For those that do not know, scribbly moth  catepillars leave trails of digestive fluid on one kind of euclid tree, then go back and suck up nutrients.  The marks are left permanently.  I like to think of my art and writing in comparison to them.  We both leave behind a lot of residue to be looked at.

      ...stoop sittin' kind of day...  The moments before you open a letter are some of my favorite.  Someone took the time to create something just for you.  It takes only a minute at the most from when you take the letter inside to when you open it, but in that time, you investigate the weight, smell, and visual quality of the letter.  Then you get the added pleasure of opening the letter and discovering what it holds inside.    I have not been a great letter creator recently, but I am working on it.  I have to say I love the postal system, even though they raise prices, and lose stuff sometimes.  They are carriers of love, friendship, hatred, junk, everything.  What an interesting position to be in.

      ...ramblin'...  I could have sworn I heard the cicadas last night.  It was just city noises, and wishful thinking.  the cicadas have been persistant this year, not even bothering to pause during the day. they are frantic to get out just one more dusty call before they become a series of empty shells.  This is one of the essences of a Kansas City summer.  I miss it there.  I am discovering, though, the things that I love about New York (Brooklyn in particular) that will some day make my missing list.

      ...long time gone...  Whew...things have been busy.  I went back to Kansas City for the memorial.  It was good.  I love seeing my family.  I really did not have any time to see any friends except Johnny.  John took me out for a cup of coffee and some good conversation.  He also showed me a witch's house, but that is a different story.  It was nice to see a familiar face.  I had a fun time with all of my family though.  I got to spend the night in Piper and Nick's new house.  It is very nice, and surprisingly set up for how recently they had moved in!  I, of course spent plenty of time with my Ma.  She is very funny and fun.  I made her jaw hurt from talking so much!  I saw my Dad not only at the memorial, but I took lunch to him one morning.  We had a good time.  Then I saw Daddad!  Mom and I went over to his house to hang out for a while before going to dinner at Tippin's.  Afterwards we hung out more, and I found old photo albums - one solely dedicated to photos of my Mom throughout her upbringing.  A lot were of ones I had never seen before.  It was great to visit with Daddad.  He gets so forlorn when I leave...I just don't want too!  I needed to come back to my other home here, though.  I missed Jeremy so much.  When I arrived home (NY), I was greated by more familial trauma...no need to go into it...things are better.  So, life is semi-normal again.  Whatever that means.

      ...memorium...  My grandmother was a short stack of fun, intelligence, sassiness, and grace.  She was always there with a pun, a piece of candy, listening ears, a coke, lots of love, etc.  I will miss her greatly, but know that she is a lot happier wherever she is now.  As a young girl, she played lots of sports and ran -  and won! - city races.  She was a small girl with flaming red hair, and she beat those long legged girls!                                                                         She appeared in a photograph in the June 1935 edition of National Geographic.  It was an article about West Pointe, and she was a bridesmaid in her good friends wedding.  Her friend was marrying a West Pointe graduate.  People recognised her by her hair and beauty after the photo was published. She attended journalism school briefly at Kansas University. She worked in the offices of Alf Landen (as a secretary to his secretary I believe) while he was running for president, and made a lasting impression on every one there. She married my Grandfather, a doctor, and they had a love that most people now never find. They had two incredible children together, my father, and my aunt. She used to buy all the chemicals for my dad's crazy science experiments, because he was to young to purchase such toxic materials. She used to volunteer for the rehab in Kansas City. One time, she was walking down the street in KCK  carrying an umbrella, when a giant gust of wind came and picked her up.  She paddled her feet furiously trying to reach the ground, but could not, and all the people on the street could not believe their eyes! I loved spending the night at my Grandparent's home, because that meant we played Chinese checkers and other games, ate jumbo hot dogs, got our own room with our own TV and candy dish, told stories, ate giant cinnamon buns for breakfast, and had tons of other fun. My grandmother was the sharpest dresser in the world.  Always lovely slacks, skirts, and blouses.  Always very high high heels.  Her clothes and shoes matched perfectly and she had outfits of every color!  She always had on great jewelry, and had a million different brooches/pins - some lovely, some silly.  Sometimes for Halloween or other holidays, she would put seasonal stickers on her blouse collar, but it never looked weird. She used to do needlepoint, and made some really incredible things. She always had such nice, encouraging, honest things to say in cards and letters.  She wrote me letters all through college, and also when we moved here.   Grandma loved to take you out to lunch, and I loved to have lunch with her.  When we were kids, she would pick us up in her car and take us wherever we wanted to go - Tippin's, Houlihan's, Annie's Santa Fe, etc. - Sometimes we would run errands with her, and often she would swing by wherever to let us pick out a small  present for ourselves. Grandma knew all kinds of people and all of them absolutely adored her.  She has so many stories, and always knew the latest about anyone.  She adored crossword puzzles and was good at them!  Always did them in ink.  She also devoured books, especially mystery novels.  She always found time to read.  There are so many things that I could say about her...The words can't even come close to how awesome she was.  She will be missed.

      ...september, i'll remem-ember...  So...this week has been kind of glum, for reasons that I will be talking about in the not too distant future.  But for now, other things. Jeremy showed me some action...that is, the action in our piano!  He had his first two classes this week and is on his way to being a fantastic piano tuner.  I'm very proud of him.  There's a lot of stuff going on, on the inside of a piano.  Man, who invented them?  Who thought up all those intricate parts?  Who discovered/invented anything?  Phew...it makes me wonder sometimes...I'm not sure if I have ever discovered anything new.  I'm not exactly the inventor type, though I can build/create lots of different stuff.  When I was a kid, I wanted to be McGuyver really bad and make explosives from paper clips and erasers.  I could never quite get it to work...then again, I used to play QVC when I was alone sometimes.  I'd get a ring or something and do my best pitch as to why all my imaginary viewers needed this item and FAST.  It's not like my Mom, or anyone in my family, were QVC people either...  It's amazing I made so many friends.   So we'll end with...an ode to things, by none other than Pablo Neruda. I just feel in the mood for this, so indulge me.  I'm only doing the English translation though. This is one of my all time favorite poems, so enjoy.  I have a crazy, crazy love of things. I like pliers, and scissors. I love cups, rings,  and bowls- not to speak, of course, of hats. I love all things, not just the grandest, also the  infinite- ly small- thimbles, spurs, plates, and flower vases.  Oh yes, the planet  is sublime! It's full of pipes weaving hand-held through tobacco smoke, and keys and salt shakers- everything, I mean, that is made by the hand of man, every little thing: shapely shoes, and fabric, and each new bloodless birth of gold, eyeglasses, carpenter's nails, brushes, clocks, compasses, coins, and the so-soft softness of chairs.  Mankind has built oh so many perfect  things! Built them of wool and of wood, of glass and  of rope: remarkable tables, ships, and stairways.  I love  all things, not because they are passionate or sweet-smelling but because, I don't know, because this ocean is yours, and mine: these buttons and wheels and little  forgotten treasures, fans upon whose feathers love has scattered its blossoms, glasses, knives and  scissors- all bear the trace of someone's fingers on their handle or surface, the trace of a distant hand lost in the depths of forgetfulness.  I pause in houses, streets and  elevators, touching things, identifying objects that I secretly covet: this one because it rings, that one because it's as soft as the softness of a woman's hip, that one there for its deep-sea color, and that one for its velvet feel.  O irrecvocable river  of things: no one can say that I loved only  fish, or the plants of the jungle and the field, that I loved only those things that leap and climb, desire, and survive. It's not true: many things conspired to tell me the whole story. Not only did they touch me, or my hand touched them: they were  so close that they were a part of my being, they were so alive with me that they lived half my life and will die half my death.

      ...where the heart is...  The other day I was walking down fourth avenue (the one in Brooklyn, by our place) thinking about how for the first week or two when we moved here, how I barely left the apartment, especially alone.  I had never thought that I would be even slightly scared of a place I live in.  It's not like I had been used to living in the best neighborhoods in Kansas City.  Maybe I was afraid I might actually like it here.  Now of course, I walk down the street like nobody's business.  People recognize me, smile and nod.  I am familiar.   I think walking and taking public transportation make you much more a part of your community.  You begin to notice patterns, especially if you are doing things at the same time each day.  I like walking into my favorite corner store on fourth, or the mexican grocery, or flowers and coffee, or our bank, or aniello's, or taco nuevo mexico, and they know us.  I can weave easily through the people on the street, and I know all the characteristics of each street and sidewalk.  It's a different experience than what I was used to in K.C. In the Kansas City area (Lawrence included) it is a understanding of the landscape from the perspective of a car.  I do know parts by foot, very well actually, but the majority is taken in from the driver's seat preferably.  I love cruising around.  Some routes are like my favorite pair of pants, that pair you never want to wash because they would have to be off of your body.  I knew exactly where you could or could not take a left turn, where cars would be parked at any time of day on various streets, almost to the minute how long it should take me from point a to point b, etc.  I also know my car, and how it handles every situation.   Thinking about it, people knew us in Kansas City too.  It just was not necessarily at strictly neighborhood places.  My neighborhood was all over that town.

      ...just slide...  Everyone is so quiet on the subway in the morning.  People are either absorbed into their various papers (or pretending to be,) or sitting there with their eyes closed.  No one wants to be singled out and noticed.  This morning on the C train there was a woman a year or two older than me who was silently crying.  I did not even notice until the woman in the seat across from hers handed her a tissue.  When the tissue lady got off a few stops later, the crying one smiled and gave her thanks.  The other woman leaned down and whispered something...It was very touching in many ways.  First, that something could be so wrong or sad that it would make you cry on the subway, and second, a stranger's compassion.  That simple exchange filled me with happiness and hope.  It seems so much here (probably every where) that people avoid unnecessary contact. On the way home in the late afternoon, people are again quiet, though not as much as in the morning.  So many look like they are lacking iron and sunlight.  It's not even winter yet!  I think too      many people are working jobs that do not satisfy them.   My jobs now require me to spend much more time on public transportation than I normally enjoy, but I also get to walk about three miles a day.  This rules!  I have to be in a hurry, but it feels good.  It is a positive tired at the end of the day.

      ...lap it up...  This morning, in my kitchen, coffee brewing, I looked out our window to steal a glimpse of the neighbors bursting garden, and I spied Mama cat on her side with her three kittens drinking.  The almost all black one finished first, and bounded away to hide underneath the squash plants.  After awhile, Mama decided the other two had enough...the grey and white one kept trying at it.  Soon they were all wrestling, while the Ma daintily perched on a bucket type thing to help herself to a drink of water.  It was beautiful.

      ...not much action...  I've been viewing everything from the inside lately, even though the outside feels fantastic!  I've been inside the apartment, work, the subway, a taxi, other people's apartments...Not much time to lazily stroll about.    We celebrated Rosh Hashanah on Friday with dinner at Peter and Joanne's.  It was great!  Bea was there, and Brian, and Chris.  Joanne and Peter made a WONDERFUL meal (all vegetarian!- that's so nice,) and then we just talked, and gossiped, and laughed a lot.  Jeremy and I had a really great time.  I miss my family a lot, but I am so glad that we are near some of Jeremy's relatives.  Yesterday a piano entered our midst.  It's begging to be tuned... The cats enjoy rolling all over it.  Frank looked very startled when Jeremy started playing it while he was on top.  They have never lived with a piano before!    Piper and Nick have bought a house!!!  By the time we visit K.C. next, they should have been moved in for months.  That's so nice for them.  They have been in the apartment for so long.  I don't get to say goodbye to it...(oh, it's not that tragic!)  I wish I could help decorate it...not that Piper would agree with all my suggestions:)  A house...sigh.

      ...on a plane...  A year ago, today, we were headed back to Kansas City from visiting Jeremy's Great Aunt May here in New York City.  We knew this was most likely the last time that we would be seeing her, and she had that feeling as well.  It was a really wonderful weekend though...After dinner one night, we sat around her table talking, when we noticed that a HUGE full moon was on the rise.  It moved so quickly!  May lifted out of her seat to get a better view.  The three of us just sat in silence for a minute.   May gave us an engagement card and present that weekend.  She told me how happy she was that I was joining the family.  She said lots of great things, as I know some of you out there know. So, we kissed her goodbye on Tuesday, and her sitting at the table is the last we physically knew of May.  I can't really express through words on a blog what she was like... That's it...luckily, we weren't on a flight a week later...

      ...smell my feet...  Yay for Halloween!  I've got the decals up(ghosts and pumpkins, bats and cats) to let the kiddies know we are friendly, and I've got a bowl full of candy(kit kats, skittles, and hershey miniatures).  I'm also sporting a black turtle neck (I'm going as a New Yorker...just kidding) with the skeleton stickers around the collar (just like my Grandma!)  No costume this year.  I'm not very creative lately...I will go through a run-down of things I have been in previous years - in no particular order - a princess, carebear, punk rocker(second grade!) , sleepy-time girl (I just wore pajamas), aerobics instructor, gypsy, giant tea bag, voodoo doll...I know there have been more, but my memory is obviously blocking them for some reason.  Let me know what you are for Halloween, what you handed out, what you received, etc...all the gory details!  Happy Halloween!

      ...wishing i could see you...  I really want to run into people I know on the streets here.  I'm not sure why.  I keep getting the vibe like I am going to.  Actually it already happened a bit.  I've had two KCAI buddies come into the Dia by chance and run into me working!  Jesse and John!  It's fun.  I've just been thinking a lot about people who occupy my past more than my present and maybe even future.  I love where I am as a person right now, and I take nothing back...I just miss some of the way things used to happen.  I like to remember...late nights at Jenny's house, sitting around the kitchen table, or doing crazy stuff...taking late night walks or drives with friends...hanging out at Tony's apartment with him and Mandylan and others...fun nights with Maralie and also Eli and Tim...dressing up to go to the grocery store or wherever...staying up all night talking with Mike A...late nights in studio, and also just studio in general...getting letters from Sarah and Julie, and an occassional visit...etc.  There is so much more...I really do not like letting people slowly slip from my life.  You stop one day and realize where have they gone?  New people have moved in, but create their own space - never taking over where someone else used to stand.  Alright, this is making me too wistful...  ...memory of the day...  The image of driving down that lonely Arizona road and looking over to see dusty, cracked cowboy boots coverin' every fence post for a good mile or two, keeps playing like a bouncy 16mm reel in my head.  Here's to hopin' they still populate that stretch of road.

      ...hidden moments...  The other night, around nine o'clock, I was walking down ninth street in our neighborhood.  It was chilly, so I was trying to move fast, plus look slightly tough in case anyone wanted to mess with me.  Then I noticed an older man standing in his little front cement garden space that we have here, except he wasn't just standing...he was doing tai chi!  It was so beautiful.  He was aligning himself with this crazy town!  You have to be creative about finding your own space here to be quiet and relax.   ...L-O-L-A LOLA...  Lola says some awfully funny things to me in our travels.  Jeremy got to experience them recently, because he came to work with me on Monday.  Here are some examples:  We were on the bus, and she was sitting on her silly putty egg pretending to be a Mama bird when suddenly she yells, cracking up while saying it, " The egg rolled under my VAGINA!"   She's very into talk like that (she's four)  We were talking to a man in the park who had a dog, and he was asking Lo about her dog...she was just telling him whatever, but then declared that her dog has a penis that he licks!  Well...it's true!  She also stated the other day while waiting for the bus,"Where's the damn bus!"  I said, "Lo-la..."  and she very calmly explained to me that it's okay because some people say that sometimes...true again, I could not argue.  One last thing...she sings perfectly the song Lola AND The Velvet Underground song I'm Sticking With You (which is one that Jer and I sing together)  Her parents have great taste in music.

      ...the streets of new york...  Yesterday was a particularly smelly day here in good 'ol NY.  I'm not sure why exactly, but I smelled a much wider variety of fragrances than I normally do.  On the subway was some man who had the odor of that cherry-flavored putty stuff they use to make dental molds.  Wonder what he does at home!  I think I also caught traces of Rodenticide in the air.  On the street was the normal multiple types of exhaust, food smells (baked goods, honey-roasted nuts, burning soft pretzels...) as well as leaves burning somewhere.  Isn't that pretty much illegal everywhere, but so many people do it!  I also took in a snort full of someone smoking a joint on my way into work.  That's another constant smell on the streets here!  Other scents encountered during the day: dust, magic markers, movie theater, candles, and human waste to name a few.  Lovely!  The sniffer is on the prowl!

      ...you say it's your birthday...  Normally I don't inform people it's my birthday...well, except those who already have it ingrained in their head, then I make them celebrate me for the month of October! Ha.  So, on October 21,1978 at 2:16 am (Eastern Time)  I was born in Fairfax, Virginia.  My sister asked my Mama and Daddad (my Mom's parents) who were in town for the event if I was black or white.  She was only four and thought you just get whatever!  I love that!  Jeremy, of course, thinks she knew something about what my Mom had been up to on the side.  My Mom was not up to anything to set the record straight.  In my first moments captured on film, I look exactly like my Dad...a large, round, bright red head, and a confused/befuddled look on my face.  I still have the huge head as my sister and others like to lovingly point out!  So...yay for my parents for copulating, and for the month of October, and for being a Libra, and for all my fun friends and family!

      ...morning...  Good-morning campers!  I love Saturday, because I don't work!!!  I still get up relatively early though.  It's nice having quiet morning time to myself.  I love Jeremy tons, but it is enjoyable to see him asleep in our warm bed, and to have time to read and write.  This morning I am sitting in pajama bottoms stolen from my husband and my old Theater for Young America t-shirt.  Earlier I was looking at some old zines...good 'ol friends.  The cats are actually sleeping.  I'm getting ready to make breakfast and coffee.  It's going to be a good day.  Hoping yours is too!

      ...weather report...  Jeremy told me I talk a lot about weather in my blog.  Yeah.  I love weather so much.  I constantly complain about it (a couple weeks into real winter, "It's so cold!  God, where oh where is summer!" ... a couple weeks into real summer, "I wish it would get chilly so I could wear my winter clothes!  I'm so hot!"), but I love all kinds.  They are predicting a real doozy of a storm for tomorrow.  In some ways, woo-hoo!, I love a good rip roarin' storm (hope it's like the mid-west variety.) In other ways...man, I have to walk in that...a lot...with a kid part of the time...and no super hardy shoes...(softly)damn.  Weather is very tied in with my memories, just like smell.  You know what, just the other day I was wishing there existed a perfume that smelled exactly like that fresh outdoors electricity right before a crazy storm smell.  That is my kind of perfume!  Also, desert in various stages of bloom perfume would be nice.  Okay, I am a total nerd...pay no attention to me! ;)

      ...brewin'...  Things I came in contact with today: a scritchy-on-papers-early- in-the-morning cat, a blaring alarm clock that was starting to lose the battle, a washcloth, the same outfit I wore yesterday because it's so damn comfy (a new sweater!),  a bowl of yogurt with grapenuts and fruit, some zines, a toothbrush, a goodbye snuggle, our neighbor Nancy on the way to the subway - all the way to Jay Street, a large cup of coffee, a chilly yet pleasant walk, an empty office, mail orders, emails, my boss and her son Otto, chocolates she brought from Frankfurt, entering books, a peanut butter/jelly sandwhich on the go, a very happy Lola, the various folks we chat with on the bus, a stop at the dog park in Union Square, a Curious George reading, Lola's mom, the subway home - daydreaming, an encounter with my landlord - grrr, a half-hour with my husband (uh, not with with okay? :) some re-heated added to Chinese food, t.v., cat snuggles inter-mingled with scritchy on books, more t.v. (Buffy was on), weird voices when I tried to log-on (I swear I am sane), internet browsing, blog-writing, on to...seeing Jeremy soon, chit-chatting, flannel sheets, glorious sleep...repeat.

      ...mmm...pie...  Today is a day for baking cheddar cheese buttermilk biscuits and apple pie.  I have been looking forward to this for days.  Is that sad?  I just don't often have time to bake and I love it.  I have never attempted these particular items either, so it is an adventure.    Last night we went and saw some bands with old Kansas folks (people Jer knows from KU) in them who now live here.  It was really fun.  I got to meet a lot of new people and they were all very nice.  The music was also great, in particular Brian and Laura's band - Dust Dive I think the name is.  It was very...I can't explain it any other way than it made me homesick, happy, want to cry, etc.  Laura plays violin in it some...great!  It was a long night.  Yesterday I complained for the first part of the day about having to walk in the rain so much.  Then, on my way to pick up Lola - it was steadily pouring as it did all day - I passed by a homeless man in a doorway, curled up sleeping and absolutely soaked.  I realised that I may be uncomfortable for a few hours, but at least I know I have somewhere to head home and dry up.  Man...those pants of his are never going to dry in this weather.   Lola was actually fantastic yesterday.  We had no complaining or crying or anything.  We went to the Barnes and Noble in Union Square to read until it was time to meet her Mom at Eli's daycare.  We just read a ton of books and she was very in to being mellow.  No complaints even about rain!  I was so happy and grateful.  Jeremy got to talk to Erin from Colorado yesterday on the phone while I was at work.  She's really great.   She and Joey came for a visit a couple months ago...it was good times.  Anyway, love to you Erin if you're out there - I will talk with you soon.  We are going to visit Rick soon.  We are very happy Rick is alive and doing well.  I know he's out there - so lots of love to you.  Joan and Rachel bought a place in England! (Well, Rachel didn't buy it really) It sounds nice, and they even get all the furnishings!  Everyone is excited for them and suddenly trying to arrange trips to England :)  So yay!  That's it for now.  I've got to go prep the kitchen.  Enjoy your days.

      ...casual friday...  Yay!  It's Friday! Usually that is not always cause for celebration considering I do not really have a weekend away from work, BUT...this week I do not have to work Sunday or Monday!  Today though, I have to stay with Lola until five.  It's rainy out and I'm sure she will not be thrilled to see me.  She has gotten it in her head that I am very mean and bad and she likes to inform me of that...frequently.  Yeah, I sure am the devil for buying her chocolate milk, reading stories to her, and never yelling.  I know she's just four...I also know my future kids will probably do similar stuff, so why do I put up with it from a kid who is not even mine?!  Grrr.  What's frustrating is that she is lots of fun when she is happy.  Okay, enough of work!  Work be gone!!! It's chilly, and rainy, and such a great day for cuddling with your husband under a quilt and laughing.  That's where I will be mentally all day.  I am going to stay in the space of warmth and hot beverages and good books and kisses and cats.  In reality I'll be patrolling the streets, on the lookout for smiles.  Tough assignment on a day such as today.

      ...the fall tickles...  It's pretty chilly out, and I am so glad due to the fact that I can now wear sweaters and long-sleeves.  Some of my favorite clothes are fallish/wintery ones.  What should I wear today...  Our neighbors with the fantastic garden finally picked their HUGE squash that was hanging off this rope thing they had suspended.  Recently, I had been secretly hoping that it would fall on it's own before they could pick it.  That's mean, but it would have been strangely satisfying to see that much destroyed squash on the ground.  I am glad they were able to pick it though.  I need to calm down some.  Fall is in my bones and making me wild.  I don't mean to be that way, and I don't like to be upset or mean.  My apologies to anyone who has come into contact with that part of me recently.  I shouldn't even blame it on fall...fall is the best...maybe I can blame it on Mercury! :)  Someone told me recently that it was in retrograde(?) I think that's the right one, and that it was righting itself soon.  In it's wake in my life it has left broken internet and credit card machines at work (oh, madness,) getting upset about inane things, getting very defensive, stressed, tired, etc.  Yeah...blame it on Mercury...that's the ticket.  I watched Bones catch an incredibly speedy moth last night while Jeremy was on the phone with Joan.  On one hand, I am glad he got his little hunt and was able to devour it as well.  He is quite quick with the claws.  On the other hand, I love moths.  I think they are really pretty and twitchy.  I love how twitchy they are!  Oh well, the cycle of life continues.  So, reaching out to you, hoping you and yours are well.  My thoughts are with you a lot, I can guarantee.  Wishing we could all be next door neighbors...well...maybe some of you should be on the next block over.  ;) Just kidding.  Enjoy October - Libras rock (I'm biased.)  Get Halloween candy even if you don't get trick-or-treaters (more for you!)  Take care. love

      ...'round the campfire...  Last night, Jeremy met Corrie and I at our place of business so we could all go out to dinner.  So...we did that!  Then Corrie came home with us and she treated our ears with some music she is going to record for fun.  She strummed the guitar and sang, while Jeremy accompanied her on the mandolin.  After awhile, I joined in singing when they just started playing random songs.  I like to harmonize.  It was so much fun!  I love having live music in the house.  I think it is so important to sing, play musical instruments, and dance.  It can really lift your spirits.   You know what?  I've been purchasing really fun postcards lately.  I hope to actually fill them out and send them on their way to new homes soon.  Of course soon probably means Thanksgiving...I have found some great stores just on my daily walks that sell amazing postcards.  Maybe one will come your way...whoever is out there.  Speaking of walking, Jeremy did the math and discovered that Tuesday through Friday I walk at least 3.5 miles, and the other days, probably only a mile or two.  So how come my tummy isn't shrinking!?  Oh yeah, I like food.  Actually, I do feel healthier in some ways.  Walking is so fantastic.  So many dogs, a crazy-quilt of people, endless asphalt, hole-in-the-wall stores, unpredictable weather... Yeah, so get out there and walk around some.  Oh, and you can send me postcards too if you want.*wink, blush*

      ...net less...  We will be losing internet access for a couple days.  Our year of free access is about to run out, and we just ordered new stuff today, though the disk will take a few days to get here.  So, there may be a semi-long silence, but not too bad.    Oh, I'm feeling a bit better.  I am not working at the Dia today - except for the special gala event tonight - but guess who is working in my place?!  Jeremy!  They may be hiring him for the weekend position we need to fill.  Cross your fingers.    It's odd how quickly moods change...yesterday, I wanted to close my eyes on the world because everything was too painful to look at.  It was so drab outside and also inside me.  Today, even though I am still a little sicky, the world is an okay place, and I am curious about what it has lying in wait for me and others.  Humph...let's see what happens today.

      ...hot cross buns...  On Halloween, after I dropped Lola off with her Mama, I was doing my usual walk on 23rd street back to the F stop station.  When I get there, the train is pulling up, so I am rushing to get through the turnstile which keeps telling me I am swiping my card too quickly.  Finally, through the turnstile, and of course the trains doors are shut.  So I plunk my stuff down on a bench, when miraculously the conductor is nice enough to open the doors again!  I dive in, and get settled into a seat.  After a couple moments, I notice a guy sitting on the sideway seats across from me, and it looks like it is Seth, Lola's Dad.  I can only see half of his face, and his wrist tattoo and ring finger are covered up.  Alas, I can't bring myself to say anything.  He gets off at the next stop, never seeing me (and it was him by the way).  This brings me to thinking about awareness and also just invisioning how close we are to people we know and they have no clue.  What I mean,I guess, is those times you realize you've been on the same train as a friend - or what about all those times it happens and neither of you have a clue.  Or just thinking sometimes, wow...there is an apartment somewhere in this mess of a city that contains my husband, and cats, and things.  Or that miles away my Mom is going about her business.   Hmmm...I don't think I am clearly translating my thoughts into words.  I guess it's not a particularly weird phenomenon...sometimes the universe just hits me over the head and it's all very strange.   ...a public service announcement...  Yesterday, Jeremy and I were walking to a little movie theater near our place.  We were approaching the corner right by our house when I became aware of the sizeable group of birds perched on the wires above that particular corner.  I commented about it to Jeremy, and we chatted a little about peolple getting pooped on.  Then we were waiting for the light...under those birds...I looked up...thinking,"I wonder how often birds poop..."...I look at the ground and notice all of the stains there.  Right as I think, "Damn" and the light changes, I feel something hit my left arm.  That's right, we turned around so I could go change jackets due to the bird poop streaked down my arm - and luckily nowhere else!  Can you believe that!  Needless to say, we did not stand on that corner when we returned...

      ...mama don't take my kodachrome away...  Been a long time away from a computer and time.  Holidays were interesting to say the least.  We saw a fair amount of people in Kansas, but not nearly everyone we would have liked to.  Lack of time, transportation, and...well, time.  We did have some memorable ones though, like Ponak's with Cynthia, Ross, and Heather.  The CD Cynthia gave me for Christmas got permanently stuck in Heather's car player...oops!  Bummer for both of us.  Our first night Jer hung out with Johnny and Joe!  Good thing they came inside when they dropped Jer off.  Joe knows good husband/wife relations.   We also made and decorated cookies with our favorite flower girl Anna, her mama, and her awesome aunt and cousins.  Anna was very wired that night, and she gave us amazing gifts she picked out all on her own!  How many almost four year olds would pick out a Bob Marley T for Jeremy because they used to listen to him with Jer when they were a baby!  That same day we saw Kris and Joanna and baby Nora, who is soooo wonderful.  Loni came along for the fun too!  Then there was the get-together that kept growing...Kristen, Becky, Pat, Jenny Bany, Em, Wendy, and Wendy's man.  KB, B, Pat, and JB, and us all went to Sahara first for a lovely meal, then headed to the O.P. branch of the Peanut where we drank, talked, and had a proper adult good time.  Em and all met us there.  Come to find out, Jer used to date Wendy's older sis!  What an odd small world (or just small town)  That night was good.  And of course...last, but most definitely not least...was family time!  We stayed with my Ma, and had some good times, but not nearly as many as we should have.  She really went to town on creating a wonderful Christmas!  We saw Daddad a couple times...it's hard seeing him sooo much older now...every time I visit...we saw Dad, had some dinner with him, hung out...and we actually played with Piper and Nick quite a lot!  Casual Friday...that's all I'm saying.  One reason we got to see them more was our flight back to NY was canceled right as we got to the airport.  Luckily they live up North!  So, we spent an extra night and morning with them.  Unfortunately, I was getting over the stomach bug that attacked me during Christmas Eve night.  We had opened presents already though!  I just wasn't fun to be around, and I passed the bug on to Daddad briefly and Jeremy (he's still getting over it)  Oh!  I also got in a pleasant quick chat with aunt Pat and uncle Gary.  Lovely time had by all. To: Ann, Christine, Evan, Teresa, Hugo, Ana, Jenny O, Matt, Jon, Angie and Thom (well Jer saw you briefly) and everyone else we did not see...we are sorry, and wish we could have seen you all.  We really do miss you and will be back at the end of July.   Please don't hate us :) Oh!  and to Jer's family that we missed seeing because of our flight being canceled same to you.  We love you and are sorry we missed out on fun.   Everyone take care and have a good New Year's.  love...

      ...makin' plans stan...  So, no strike thus far.  It is still a possiblity, but who knows what will happen.  Regular work-a-day for moi.  On the other hand...we are filling our schedule in K.C. very quickly.  I know we are going to piss somebody off because we won't be able to see them, but...sorry.  We have no car there, plus we need family time.  We are moving back soon enough anyway.    I'm excited...we are going to decorate the tree when we get back in town.  When I was in high school/college, I was always too busy to dedicate a lot of time to do this, though I loved helping when I was little.  But now, it is exciting again.  My mom said she already put the lights and garlands up, so that leaves the best parts for us!  Ornaments and tinsel.  We have some very unusual ornaments, as well as some normal ones.  There are the various ones that have either my sister or my name on it or our picture.  And of course, the solid colored balls.  But...we also have santa playing tennis (my mom can't stand him!), a little clingy panda, mini stockings that always have fun flavored gum put in them, homemade candy cane reindeer, the gold angels that when my sister was little she ate one of their heads, the totally 70's looking birds (made with brightly colored yarn), southwesty ones, antique-y ones, plastic baby on a cotton ball in half a walnut shell (it's supposed to be baby Jesus - I made it in preschool), and best of all the gold, green, magenta, silver glittery pointy thing that for some reason reminds me of the Kremlin that goes on top of the tree. Oh!  Don't forget the bubble lights!   I love our tree.  It has so much going on...

      ...(chanting) strike,strike,strike,strike...  There may be a transit strike in New York within a couple of days.  I have mixed emotions about this.  I definitely want workers to strike if a deal is not made, because everyone should be making good wages, plus the MTA are a bunch of scammers who apparently have no money currently, yet people riding public transportation is way up.  Money mismanagement?  Most likely.  Plus a strike will create an interesting situation that I secretly desire to be played out so I may watch and kind of participate in.   On the other hand...so many people rely on public transportation, and it's going to get ugly out there with extra-huge traffic jams, even pissier people (which I cannot handle), and who knows what else.  Such a delicate balance...So...to strike or not to strike?  You gotta do what you gotta do.  I don't think I will personally be troubled much if it happens.  As long as we can make it to the airport Wednesday in a timely manner (cross your fingers for no delays and great weather!) Oh!  Another thing...the news has totally been hyping up how horrible this will be and even dragged in the 'ol terroism plea (that this would be a perfect opportunity for it)  It seems like someone is maybe in bed with the MTA and trying to scare those transit workers...Also...the union leader is very cool.  That's all.   ...lament for counter space and time...  I wish I had a kitchen with lots of counter space and cubbies to store things.  I would be able to unbox my AWESOME mixer and quisinart, as well as use our other fun gadgets in a much easier fashion than we can now.  And I wish for time in order to make the things I have dreaming of making recently...my great-Grandma Birdie's (passed to me from my Grandma) Swedish pecans, Fafa's (my Mom's Mom's father) caramels, a very belated super-chocolately birthday cake for Jeremy,  biscuits of all kinds, pies out the wazoo, and all those other glorious baked goods that Martha Stewart wants me to make...Sigh.  Soon...first we gotta clean those dishes...

      ...the rush...  Saturday morning I ventured out to the Union Square holiday market/farmer's market.  I spent most of my time at the latter.  I purchased a cup of hot spiced grape juice (so good!) to warm my hands.  There were potatoes of all kinds, knobby carrots, fresh herbs, wintery veggies, fresh eggs, goat cheese, farmer's cheese, jams, jellies, and pickles, and mountains of baked goods.  The smells were overwhelming.  I love just walking around farmer's markets.    We leave for Kansas City a week from this Wednesday!  Home...well, one of them.  This time of year always seems to fly by easier than the rest.  Lots of diversions I guess.

      ...are these those times...  Isn't it amazing that a simple CD can bring back such a rush of times, happy times, but now it just makes you almost kind of sad...I am alone in my apartment in Brooklyn on a Tuesday night, my feet are freezing regardless of how much blanket I wrap around them, and all I can think of listening to this music are friends who are no longer a part of my daily or even semi-daily routine.  We are still friends...things just get busy, and no one lives nearby anymore...will this change when we move back to Kansas City?  Or will I just long for Adam Kuban to leave a kooky message, or to see Corrie B at work, and to hang out with Adam and Angela, or to eat Chinese food with Bea?  Don't get me wrong...even though I get wistful at times, I love now.  I wouldn't trade any of my time with Jeremy for all the candy, or mixed tapes, or other great things in the world.  He is so...sigh.(good sigh)  So, I am enjoying my time here as much as possible.  I've been worrying too much lately.  I forget that that has not worked for me in the past, so why should I bother to let it gain force now.  My biggest concern for tomorrow...find my mittens, because my hands damn near froze today!  That cold reached right into my teeth and shook all the way through every bone.  It's sneaky, that cold.  Wow...the CDs just switched (from Tori to Tool!)  Now I am in high school, in my room, painting my sandals and whatever else I can get my hands on.  A cup of tea, my own phone line, incense, a stereo...or it could be me now, considering I still listen to Tool all the time!  Yay...Jeremy walked in from tunin' class.  Screw you guys!  Just kidding...  can you believe his classes are over next Tuesday?  Maybe you didn't even know that...or maybe... I'm a total freak!  Alright, sorry to leave you for my man, but he's distracting and I like to hang out with him.  Adios.

      ...thanks...  Our Thanksgiving trek was great.  It was nice to get away even if for a couple of days.  Joan had her veggie lasagna just coming out of the oven when we arrived on Wednesday night.  So, we had a nice dinner, and just hung out.  Rachel and I had a fun time painting nails and chatting.  Thursday, we drove to Meade, Alan, Lucas, and Liam's farm in South Haven.  Ahhhh.  An invigorating walk and talk, good food, board games, no responsibilities.  Jeremy and I spent the night at their place, while Joan and Rachel stayed in town.  In the morning, I helped Alan take one of the cars in to town for a tune up.  Then we made our way back, and Alan whipped up his wonderful blueberry waffles.  Unfortunately, we had to leave after that to go back to Detroit, but it was the first night of Hanukkah, so Joan made latkes and applesauce (with ginger in it!) and we ate some leftovers too.  We exchanged prensents and played dreidel, which is a fun game (especially if the dreidel isn't rigged.)  So...there's a lot to be thankful for.  Thanks to all my new family...I love you all very much...and thanks to all my own family...you know I love you tons as well.

      ...restless night...  I kept tossing and flopping all night...much of it due to strange dreams.  Here is the last one I had before waking up for good. I was on my Mom's street(in front of the house, but more to the left) and had just run into Lola who wanted to have the stuffed animal I was holding.  We were discussing the topic when I see Nancy (our upstairs neighbor in NY) in a very decadent wedding dress walking across the street, headed to my old elementary school, Brookridge, which is right around the corner.  She shouts something at me, but I don't quite hear.  All this time I am thinking, "She and Rich are getting married?...but we never got an invitation."  She leaves her Manolo Blahnik shoes on the corner of 99th and Lowell, and I get the impression that she wants me to bring them when I come to the wedding.  I drop the stuffed animal, and run across the street to pick up the shoes, and go to find what is going on.  I finally get to the school (which is seriously a short block from my Mom's house) and inside everyone is dressed up, milling about, and I don't see Nancy.  I do however see my mother and my sister all prepped for the event.  I am in jeans and a t-shirt.  Someone tries to hand me a flower petal, but I tell them I'll get one when I come back.  I go to my sister and tell her Jeremy and I never got our invitation.  She says she is sure we are invited, and talks about how Nancy talked the whole month of April to her about it.  I ask if I have enough time to change and she says I have plenty.  I run home, but it is that special slow-motion dream running.  Finally I make it to my Mom's and run up to my old bedroom.  I already knew that I would just throw on the flower dress that I wore to Piper's college graduation.  Jeremy wasn't even home yet from the doctor.  I reach into the closet, pull out the dress, turn around, then look down as I am taking my clothes off and see that I already had on a white eyelet dress.  I take it off and am turning the dress around because it was inside-out, when Jeremy comes home.  I tell him what's going on and he gets wide eyed.  A few seconds later he appears almost fully dressed, while I am pulling my dress on still!  I also realize that the flower dress turned into a velvety number that I have never seen, but is beautiful.  While I am pulling it on, he tells me about his doctor's visit (which I will not go into details here, because it is too strange)  Then I woke up...

      ...how it is...  Salt scars run along the sidewalks like seams to some huge, unknown sewing project.  It also seems that as quickly as dogs can let it come out, what does instantly freezes to the asphalt.  Halos of this seasons past eliminations are everywhere you can look.  It is hard to escape much of anything here.  I keep dreaming of those steaming, summer-y, so-hot-it's-painful sidewalks that are coming up in the future.  The city starts to sweat and all the smells come out intensified by the dense air.  Sigh.  I'm already at that point in the winter where I need sunlight warming my naked arms, sweat slowly rolling down my side, and a good porch where I can watch the world go by, then dive in.  This usually does not come until February... Hoping all of you are able to stay inside under blankets, with warm drinks and a nice companion (person, book, pet, or otherwise)...but if not, that you can think warm thoughts while walking those bitter sidewalks.  love.

      ...snow day...  I wish that the few inches of snow on the ground would render the city useless and make it so I wasn't able to go to work.  Snow day!  It's been so long since the days of school snow days.  We even got them a couple times in college...of course, they told us once we were halfway through the day anyway, so it wasn't as satisfactory.  Most of us decided to stay in studio anyway.  At least today is a go-home-early day.  I do not have to pick up Miss Lola.  I get to come home and...do laundry!  Woo-hoo!  Friday's are sizzlin'!   ...the little things...  the day where there were hundreds of oil rainbows in the street, running into someone familiar on the train, how frank always has kitty kisses for you, unexpected mail from friends, coming home to find my husband walking towards me with a big glass of juice and dinner on its way, looking through sara's cedar chest, having the big, blind dog run into me on the street and apologizing to it, being comforted by the fact that the weeds are growing up through the tracks at the smith and 9th stop, watching a shadow bird walk the length of a rusty i-beam, the beauty of viewing a plane glistening in the morning sunlight through the industrial structure of our subway station, being privy to secrets (positive ones) and i'm not even going to tell you, the joy of hot cocoa in a tiny cup...

      ...so many words, so little time...  I have not felt like writing recently, because I have been absolutely glued to other activities.  Jeremy even has a hard time pulling me away from my books and drawing.  It feels good though.  There is generally a bone biting cold outside, so I try not to go unless I must.  Today, I must brave it to pick up the little mama, but then I get to meet Corrie, Christine, and Jeremy for my first Ethiopian feast!  Yummmm...well, I hope...I don't know what it will taste like yet!  So...life is pretty good.  Jeremy is making blintzes and coffee for breaklunch as I write, the roaches are on retreat from our apartment, we are healthy, Jeremy is making business contacts, I am surrounded by things that need my attention, we have been cooking a lot, etc.  Yes...

      ...it is not acceptable for a mermaid to turn into a panda...  My hands are itching to work out some ideas.  Why have I kept myself from drawing for so long?!  I guess I doodle some.  Anyway...Piper and Nick gave me a great blank book for Christmas, so I believe that tomorrow, or possibly this evening, I shall start filling it with things I like to look at whether it be other people's visuals, my own, or writing.  Very exciting.  I'll have to pull myself away from my new books though.  With my gift card bonus from work I purchased Fast Food Nation and Gangs of New York in person, and am reading them simultaneously.  Excellent.  I finished out the card last night on-line with The Grey Lady and the Strawberry Snatcher,  The Secret Art of Dr. Seuss, and the latest Dead Prez CD. I've seen two new movies within the last week: Gangs of New York and Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets.  Gangs was great.  I am absolutely fascinated with that period in time.  Very violent movie, but great.  I am a total nerd who now wants to go find where the five-points neighborhood used to be.  Harry Potter was good as well.  Maybe a little scary for kids, but probably not.  I was into crazy, mythic beasties at a young age, as well as low-grade horror films, and look...I'm normal...hmmm.                                                                                                               You know what I miss?  Crows.  I don't think the city has much visible besides pigeons and sparrows.  Sadly in K.C. they have so many crows that they place poison on top of buildings for them to ingest.  That's bad news bears.  I love large birds.  We had a badge in Campfire called the Thunderbird.  I think you had to stand out in the rain for 20 minutes or something to earn it (that's a very bizarre thing to have to do to earn a badge)  Anyway, I hoped more than anything that I would see an actual thunderbird someday.  Why am I never the person who sees the things I always read about starting in fourth grade from those books on the supernatural/myths/strange natural things shelf in the library at school?  I guess I should not complain...I have experienced some very "strange" (though they didn't feel wrong) things with energy and such.  Uh-oh...I'm getting all space-y on ya.  Yeah, so no crows here.  Maybe if I set out some shiny things they will come...

      ...encounters...  What a hectic, odd, strangely beautiful at times week it has been.  Things at both jobs were fritzy - mass mail orders + other stuff, kids with flu and double ear infections.  Plus I had a few encounters on the street that took me by surprise.  One day I was headed to Lola's school and noticed a man walking towards me with two crutches.  When we were about ten feet apart he suddenly yells, "Hey, don't step in that!"  I instantly freeze, one foot suspended above the sidewalk and do a quick frontal scan, find nothing, so check in back thinking I may have already stepped in it.  There is nothing there as well.  Right as I realize this he says with a big smile,"Quit thinking so hard!  Relax!"  I did not say anything and we both kept on walking.  About twenty paces afterwards I decided I should have said thanks...or at least smiled.  The next day...I was just crossing 10th Ave. on 22nd Street right by the Dia when a man carrying a paper bag walks up saying, "Sock, hats, gloves."  Seeing as how I generally ignore people selling things on the street and already was wearing all three of the things he was selling with plenty more at home, I just kept walking.  He immediately said, "Alright, f**k n*****s." like that was what I was thinking.  That certainly woke me up.  Again, I said nothing and kept walking.  Part of me wishes I had turned around and said,"Actually I don't need any of those things and it's not because you're African-American and I'm white.  It's because I don't need them!!" but the other part just thought that I really don't feel like getting into a debate this early in the morning when all I want to do is get to work, eat my bagel and drink a little joe.  Did I do the right thing, who knows, ah well.  I wish people would get to know me before they decide who I am. (I was just reading this again and I thought I should add that it's not always other people who do this...I know I have done it myself...what makes us do it, I cannot say) Well...we all have our things. I saw this dog I have seen before again.  This time at the Union Square dog park instead of tied up in front of the Garden of Eden grocery store on 23rd.  It's the tough looking black and white, kind of pit-bully or Spud's McKenzie type face, but in this humorously large green and ecru sweater!  The first time I saw him I burst out laughing.  And there he was again.  I love running into the same people or animals throughout my days.  I guess it's easy to when you have the same route daily, but often it is not even related to that.  Who knew in a city of this size! So...my dear friend Kristen who I have known since middle school is in a car at this moment, in New Jersey, headed for Brooklyn.  She has Ben with her (who we have not met) and they are here for five days or so!  Kristen is great.  She hasn't been to New York since we went on a theater trip here our senior year.  Fun!  She's a good gal to travel with.  It was her, Heather, and I (or is it me) who went to Australia together.  Hmmm...I suppose I should help Jer finish last minute cleaning...

      ...a true story...  Did I ever tell you the one about the skinwalker I saw?  I know I probably have...but here it goes again.  We were driving on a single lane highway, twisting through the cold, New Mexico night.  Mike was driving, I was the passenger, and Dave was in the back.  We were talking about what nights such as that inspire you to.  I would periodically gaze out the side window, trying to make out the desert plants stretching on forever.  On one of those looks, I saw a flash, though a very clear one, of a very tall creature, almost all black except for a white head.  It's arms were so long that they reached the ground.  It used them to lope along at an incredible pace - keeping up with the car.  This was only maybe ten feet away from our car.  I looked away, then back, and it was gone.  I rushed to tell the others, but they just thought I was being dramatic, or letting the scenery take my imagination on a ride.  When we stopped for the night, I quickly sketched out a little drawing of what I saw... Months later (that was in March - now we are in September) at school we had a visiting artist who did these performances on stilts, stilts for both her legs and arms.  She wore animal print material all over, and the stilts made her lope strangely.  I saw her perform in the streets during the Westport Art Fair.  I took pictures.  It reminded me of what I saw...I told some people the story, but they thought I was strange. A few more months go by and the pictures are developed.  I took them over to my sister's to show her, plus tell her the story.  She was wide eyed, then told me she teaches a story of Native American (Navajo I think) origin in which they talk about creatures similar to what I described, called Skinwalkers.  Little kids in the Southwest will hear them on the roof-tops trying to get in.  Actually, one of her friends who lived in New Mexico saw one too.  I felt...relieved that someone believed me and that I had really seen what I had seen.  I was also slightly freaked out, but not really.   I don't know what inspired me to write this today.  The mood just caught me I guess.

      ...snow dunes...  Man...I already wrote this semi-lengthy bit on the immense snow fall we had,plus the peace rally on Saturday, but somehow in the process of publishing it, it all got erased.  So...I'm not sure if I feel like re-writing it now or not.  Here's the un-exciting run-down.  Lots of snow. Huge dunes. Very happy...bouncing off walls.  Staying indoors, coffee, photographs, buried cars, snow...Peace rally on Saturday - wonderful experience, lots of people, puppets and signs, freezing toes, people united all over the world, police blocking us once we came from 2nd to Lex so Jer could leave, home, hope it works.  Ah well...that's it in cave-man language.

      ...i'm free...  Singin' a song, la la la, my Mondays are free!  Another day to dream, draw, hang out, enjoy leasurely coffee mornings and write.  I think I have the most ideal living in New York work schedule now.  There is absolutely no reason to be in a bad mood about anything!    "Quilts contain volumes of cultural information about the times in which they were created and the circumstances in which they were used.  Each one can tell us about the lives of the people associated with it." - from History from the Heart - E.Duane Elbert & Rachel Kamm Elbert Tiny voiced Sara and I went to the Whitney on Saturday primarily to view the show on the quilts of Gee's Bend, Alabama.  They are great!  All the materials are from old clothes, leftover courdoroy scraps from when the women were hired by Sears and Roebuck in the 70s to make pillows, and any scrounged fabric imaginable whether stained or not.  I saw one that had pieces from those classic, cheap (i.e. dorm mattresses) blue-striped mattresses!  There were even rust traces on it.  Beautiful.  In the documentary they showed of the women, they would occassionally comment on how their quilts were not like those fancy quilts you see...their's are not perfects squares with elegant top stitching, and store-bought fabrics or even always traditional patterns.  I think both kinds are wonderful.  Quilts can be anything!  Make them however you want!   So...that show was excellent, as was the stuff from the Whitney's permanent collection that was on display.  I was surprised every time I rounded a corner.  The best part is that working at the Dia we get a card that gets us into any museum (not just art) in all bouroughs for free!  Plus we can bring a guest for free too!  Woo-hoo!  I want to take full advantage of that and I will!  I can't believe I have been so lacadasical (spelling?) about getting out-and-about!  So...I have been having a lot of political talks lately, as I am sure many people have been.  I am discovering more and more that most people are against what is going on.  Even my Mom is...not that she is normally pro-war at all, but most of the time she doesn't really take much of a stance, plus she is a registered Republican and votes as such.  She is much more like the old Kansas Republicans though, who actually weren't super-right, plus cared about funding education, etc.  I think this is going to be about the only time I address any of this on this site.  I like to keep this as a place of the little details in life, and things that are ultimately good (at least for me.)  So...in case you are wondering why this is a place that seems to not care about the state of the world, that is why (not that I think anyone who may read this is thinking that.)    Hmmm...I feel like I want to write more, but I'm not sure what about...it's probably best to quit for now.  Hoping all is well...

      ...sweet tooth...  I have been thinking a lot about sweets lately.  I had this whole, ambitious plan that for around Valentine's day I was going to make truffles, as well as homemade caramels and Swedish pecans.  This, of course, will probably not happen, or at least won't happen within the next week or so as things tend to go with me.  I thought, though, that I might share the recipe for Swedish pecans with you, as they are extremely tasty and remind me of my Grandmother.  It's actually my Great-Grandma Birdie's recipe (who knows where she got it) but I remember them filling the various candy dishes scattered around my Grandparent's apartment at special times of the year.  Here ya go:  4 cups pecan halves in warm 300 degree oven for 10 min.  2 egg whites, 1/8 tsp. salt, 1 cup sugar...beat sugar into whites...add cinnamon and/or vanilla and rum flavoring- 1tsp. each  Mix warm pecans in egg mixture.  Separately, melt 1 stick butter.  Cover large cookie sheet with half of the butter.  Arrange nuts on sheet.  Pour remaining butter over. Bake 30 min. at 300 degrees, turning nuts with a spatula every 10 min.  Yum! Yum!  Enjoy...feel free to share yummy recipes with me too!  I'm always on the look-out.

      ...it's nice to see you without your hat on...  The weather outside has been great the last few days.  On Saturday, I was walking home from the co-op and the skies were grey, but it wasn't too cold out.  The air was really moist, like it should have been at least misting, but it wasn't.  Every breath dragged in wet, salty air that coated your throat.  I loved it...I started breathing deeper so I wouldn't stop feeling that sensation.  Here, I don't normally notice the salt in the air.  There were even seagulls on fifth avenue (in Brooklyn)!  Every ocean experience came back to me and I just floated in them until I reached home.  What a wonderful walk.  Yesterday it was pretty nice out, but I was inside the Dia all day, so it did not matter as much.  I was feeling pretty frisky in my new Murakami t-shirt, though, so I had to dance around some and get the wiggles out since I could not be outside.  Today we got to meet Joan (in town for just today) and Judy for lunch in mid-town before I picked up the Lola.  It was very pleasant.  We ate at a little Italian cafe and enjoyed our brief time together.  Outside the weather was...so great you didn't even need a hat.  People were out, and actually smiling.  Even though it is still cold, there is that hope of Spring...the cold cannot last.  Thank heavens for that.

Japanese animation (in particular Miyazaki) is delightful!  Incredibly beautiful!  Makes me want to cry and laugh and sigh!

      ...smelled any good houses lately?...  As I settled into my seat on the A train this morning, I noticed the smell of boring soup permeating the whole car.  I could not tell if it was coming from someone in particular, or if it is just what that section of the train smelled like.  It made me think of how everyone's houses have different over-all odors.  Many houses are fairly benign, but others are extremely distinct.  That always fascinated me as a kid...I can't really describe my Mom's house as it was fairly mellow most of the time, but when she cooked fish...All I know is that I was getting picked up in high school one night by some friends to go to a show at school and I did not escape before she began cooking.  It was fairly horrifying.   So it goes...that's better than the litter box stench I am marinating in right now!  The glories of trash night.  As we emerged from the Carrol Street stop, the train rickety-rackety-ing it's way to Smith and 9th, I discovered that while I had been underground half of the sky was that perfect shade of storm blue that looks even more fantastic with lightning streaking across.  It gave me the power to feel as if I had summoned this storm and was in control of the wind.  Every third molecule of air had a bite to it.  Luckily I had Arizona scarf wrapped around me.  I need a bit of the West these days.  Torn between directions...why do all the landscapes have to be so good?!  So now Jeremy is my hero and buying us tortilla chips and glorious fake cheese sauce so we can have a night of bean dip, avocado, electric cheese, and salad.  Plus, he rented a movie!  Plus, he is my favorite person to hang out with!  It is a good night after a fine, but whatever day.

      ...you look like a child and smell like a child...  Above...this is what Lola said to me yesterday.  Interesting.  Is this a good thing?  I suppose!  The birds have been chasing each other around (look at the nest I built you...halt! check out my nest!)  and everyone here in the city seems a bit happier as well as a little more loopy.  I've seen many people with these disturbing, vacant eyes just walking down the street or standing on the subway while doing these bizarre smiles that go in and out.  It's not even day-dreamy looking, it's just kind of creepy.  Ah well.

      ...where do you come from?...  Lying on the stairs coming up from the F platform at the 2nd Avenue stop is a small, black button with a piece of thread for a tail.  Whose jacket is missing you, or do you come from pants...perhaps a shirt.  Will they even notice you are gone?  Will someone new pick you up?  Maybe I should have, but I was surrounded by people when I noticed you.  You remind me of my many clothes that are missing buttons...

      ...we are a peaceful people?!...  Uh, yeah...I must have forgotten how peaceful Americans or any other humans are.  Excuse me while I go take a shower to rid myself of all the disgusting things my ears just took in listening to the president speak.  I like to believe deep inside my core that humans are good, beautiful beings as are all other creatures...and I do come across things that reinforce this every day, but man...on the other hand..."Humans are a bad animal."  This doesn't even come down to an American people issue with me (though I do not agree with many of our leaders) I think all people have that potential to be total hateful, greedy war monkeys.  But...we can stop ourselves at any time.  It frustrates me how many people there are in the world, how out-of-control this experiment, this life has gotten, but at the same time...that is what happens.  "Things fall apart, the center cannot hold..."  What do we do?  More, more, more. What else can we do?  Who is 'right'?  What is 'right'?  The right certainly doesn't have the answers, and I'm pretty sure the left doesn't have them either.  So many differing opinions of what is 'good' and what is 'bad'.  Who truly has the authority to say?  I don't.  Just because you are in a position of power and control does not mean that you do not die at some point like the rest of us.  And that is the beauty...the unknown...of what is to happen here in our earthly lives and what happens when that no longer exists.  So...what will I do?  What will you do?  I could really use a hug right now...I think the whole world could.  Peace.

      ...the weekend approacheth...  I absolutely adore Fridays!  No one is allowed to be in a bad mood...at least I'm never allowed!  I never feel like it.  They are somehow always sunnier, put a little more skip in your step.  Work should be good...Christine is usually hyper and will jump around with me or play bumper cars with the big roll-y cushions we have (uhh...we only do it on Sundays though!...no boss!)  Ron is there and makes you just want to stand around and talk.  Rich is usually goofy.  Michelle is in a good mood.  And Lola is always good on Fridays because if she has all of her stars for the week she gets a small toy!  Then, Jeremy is cooking an Indian feast tonight!  I finally found a store that sells the onion relish that I ADORE and can endlessly eat.  So...bought a container - fresh- bought some nan...have the simmer sauce of a saag persuasion waiting for some veggies and tofu to be added.  Have the frozen samosa and the lovely onion relish, tamarind sauce, and mango chutney to be poured liberally on whatever it calls for.  Mmmm...then it's printmaking time!  Joy.  Hope your Fridays are filled with fun people and good food as well.

      ...music for my eyes...  I bought a book of Michael Ondaatje's (the author who wrote "The English Patient") poetry entitled "The Cinnamon Peeler."  What a joy it is to soak in this book!  So beautiful.  I thought I would share with you one of my favorites so far...  Near Elginburg  3 a.m. on the floor mattress. In my pyjamas a moth beats frantic my heart is breaking loose.  I have been dreaming of a man who places honey on his forehead before sleep so insects come tempted by liquid to sip past it into the brain. In the morning his head contains wings and the soft skeletons of wasp.  Our suicide into nature. That man's seduction so he can beat the itch against the floor and give in move among the sad remnants of those we have destroyed, the torn code these animals ride to death on. Grey fly on windowsill white fish by the dock, heaved like a slimy bottle into the deep, to end up as snake heckled by children and cameras as he crosses lawns of civilization.  We lie on the floor mattress lost moths walk on us waterhole of flesh, want this humiliation under the moon. Till in the morning we are surrounded by dark virtuous ships sent by the kingdom of the loon.  -Michael Ondaatje

      ...came to an end, found a new beginning...  I had to say goodbye to Kristen (and Ben-who is very nice) this morning.  It was sad...I enjoyed going out and doing stuff with them, but mainly the times we just got to hang out and talk, or make stuff (her knitting me drawing) or dance or cook or tickle.  I'm glad she is going to where she is though.  She is moving to West Virginia to small-scale farm.  Yay! So, this morning it was lightly raining on my whole journey to work.  It was fairly warm out and just a little drizzly.  I spent most of my time at the Dia today in the back entering on the web, so I did not know it had stopped till I broke for a roof-top coffee break.  By the time I left at two, the day had turned a brilliant shade of sun striking through slightly grey, but mainly bright blue skies.  I stuffed my hat, mittens and two scarves in my bag and enjoyed having my head exposed to the air.  The weather today made me stand a little taller, walk with a more relaxed gait, and hold my head up - making eye contact and smiling a lot.  I also looked up, up, up at the buildings I was walking by.   You'd be surprised how much good stuff you can miss if you are always looking down or at eye level.  My back and temperment were glad to take a sunny stretch and realize that things are not so wrong.  There were lots of good smells on the street as well...lentil soup, laundry room air, honey roasted nuts, a city scrubbed a little more clean by the rains.

      ...ebay binge...  I formed a very bad habit today, but luckily I have restricted it to today.  Right now I have three packages from various ebay seller headed my way.  All were cheap (the most expensive being $35 w/shipping)  and they should be good...One is a set of 8 National Geographic magazines from 1935, one of which is for June.  In the June issue is a picture of my Grandmother as a bridesmaid for a West Point wedding.  People actually used to recognize her from it due to her flaming red hair!!  Another package contains Pee-Wee Herman trading cards, tatoos, stickers, and masks.  Fun!  And last but not least is a package of Victorian era (though a fair amount actually is not of that time) papers - maps, books, pamphlets, certificates, ration books, post cards...plus, coins, a letter opener made of bone, sugar tongs and a few other bizarre things.  Surprise!  That's it for me...at least for now.  No more till we have a house!

      ...all is well...  The weekend was great, and the days I have been back have been that way as well.  I got to hang out with Daddad a lot and the rest of my family, sling back $2 margaritas with Jenny, eat lots of Mexican food, talk with a bank about getting pre-approved for a home mortgage, and lots more.    Being back is good.  I missed Jeremy a lot!  Things are good...plans are known and yet unknown too.  I am not very worried about whatever future we have.  It's good to have warm weather here, and thunderstorms!, and healthy cats, and...everything.

      ...happy birthday to you...  Today my Daddad (my Mom's father), Thomas Lyman French,Jr., turns 91.  He is the reason I am going back to Kansas City tomorrow for an extended weekend.  Now...Daddad is not a perfect man.  He has some characteristics I do not agree with, but those certainly do not make up most of who he is.  I love him very dearly.  When my Mama (his wife) died when I was in fourth grade, he started coming to our house for a visit every afternoon.  I have grown very close to him over the years.  Daddad grew up in San Antonio, Texas with his parents and his four siblings : Olive, Claude, Dorothy, and James.  All of them have passed away.  He had a very accident-filled childhood.  For example:  he was nearly scalped when he got in a bicycle accident.  They took him to the pharmacist who poured peroxide on his skull while sitting at the soda counter.  There was also the time his brother was swinging around a box of dirt on a rope (who knows why- it was the 1920s?!) and when their father told him to quit it he just let go and it smacked Daddad in the head.  Then one time he was riding on the outside of a Model T, headed to play football with some friends, when the car tipped and fell on top of him.  They just erected it, played football, then Daddad got his leg checked out.  His father died about a month before the depression, but luckily left coins in the safety deposit box.  My great-grandmother Georgia did people's laundry, Daddad worked, and they took out some coins each month.  He worked at an ice-cream factory for awhile, which is appropriate considering he is one of the biggest chocolate fiends I have ever met!  I used to open cabinets in his kitchen and find them lined with one-pound Hershey bars!  Part of that is he still has a depression mentality (the man saves everything), but mostly it's because he eats unearthly amounts of chocolate!  Anyway...Georgia died young as well.  My Daddad always gets teary-eyed when he talks about how she had to cut her hair (it was red and when it was down, trailed behind her on the ground!) because it caused too much pain.  So, Daddad moved to Kansas City due to his job and met my Mama, Marjorie Jane Benton.  He spotted her having a soda with some friends after a bible class, strolled up, swung one of his long legs over a chair, sitting in it backwards, and said, "Howdy girls, my name is Tex."  He asked her out soon after, and thirteen days after their first date, they were engaged.  They got married a few months after that.  Daddad left to fight in World War II.  He was in the military police and saw lots of things in Europe, and met some very interesting people.  My mother was born while he was away...he did not see her until she was seven or so months old.  When he returned, he worked for the IRS investigating people who wanted to work for the IRS.  This is why he is a notorious questioner of everything!  He has never tasted coffee in his life, though he enjoys a nice, cold Coke.  He hasn't had a drink since Mama got sick.  She, and in turn he, were very social people in their day.  Never been a smoker.  Has had some fairly major health problems, but is still going.  He gets sad that he can't recall things well...he is a story-teller, so it hurts extra.  He has traveled the world - Europe, both during the war and later on with Mama, Africa, Mexico, the U.S.  They were planning to go to Australia, but then she got sick...There is so much more...  Daddad has instilled in me a love of family- living and past, history, collecting (you should see his stamp collection!), not to be too extravagent and to share what you have, work hard, be educated,and so much more.  I realize that this could be his last birthday...that's why I knew I had to fly home.  He and I are very close...he told my Mom, "I can't believe she is coming just for me!"  He is my last grandparent.  They were all so important to me, and I can't bear to think of having to let go again, but I know that's how things go.  I don't think he's scared and I am not for him, or for what I will feel.  But...this is a celebration of someone who is luckily still here despite all those head traumas at a young age!  Here's to you Daddad! (even though he won't read this...he's not into computers) Happy Birthday and I will see you on Saturday.  I love you.  xoxo

      ...we have taken over...  Psst!...This is Frank and Bones!  We can't believe Stacy forgot to mention our part in this past weekend!  She was just focused on her fancy highlighting tricks.  Humph!  We had a splendid few days with that little human they referred to as Morgan.  Finally, someone actually paid close attention to us and played with us endlessly.  She discovered our love of the rainbow wand and the octopus-on-a-string immediately.  I, Frank, delighted in her presence from the get go, but you know Bones...he takes a bit to warm up to things.   Hey!  This is Bones (aka Boney Mahoney, Bones Muldoon, purr-bot, and whatever else they think to call me) Alright, alright...I'm just a little shy.  I still had a lot of napping on the box by the heater to get in before I was really interested in Morgan.  But she's a great kid.  Top notch.  We are so bored now that she is gone.  She would even move my scratching post to wherever I was!  Now, that is service!  I mean...don't get me wrong...Stacy and Jeremy are pretty good humans, but it's always in and out, squirting us when we just want to sharpen our claws on their stuff, and not as much play as we require...though they do feed us well, and provide excellent napping opportunities.   Oh!  Uh...we gotta go!  I hear Stacy coming and we can't let her discover yet we know how to type!  Meow!

      ...success declared...  I entered my apartment building after work on Thursday and was greeted by Zoe, my favorite New York dog, as usual.  After a couple good pets, I threw open the door finally able to do what I had been waiting for all day...to see  urlLink Josh  and meet  urlLink Julie  and Morgan!  (By the way, Julie taught me how to do that word highlight-y thing within my text!  Now you know how totally un-computer saavy I am.  Thanks Julie.)  We had a great night.  Julie and Josh are a very excellent match for each other (aw...cute and nice!) and Morgan instantly endeared herself to me by saying, "I hear you are artsy-fartsy like me!"  Jeremy and I even got to sign her coveted Dr. Suess My Book About Me.  We  drew, had make your own tacos, and then after Morgan was asleep had adult hang-out/talk time.  Not the dirty meaning of "adult" okay!   On Friday I had to go to work, but only until two, so they all came to meet me so we could head to the Natural History Museum.  I had never been there before, and man...that place is big!  We didn't even see half of it, and we saw tons.  Jeremy kept harassing Morgan by poking her with an umbrella , so she finally got him back when we were sitting in front of the stuffed penguins.  Thus, the umbrella fights began.  We went to  urlLink Guru  for dinner, which is where Jer and I had our N.Y. wedding reception last summer.  I watched Morgan work on the same spoonful of lentil doughnut in yogurt sauce for about fifteen minutes.  She whispered, "It's kind of sour!"  Not one complaint though, and she did eat some as well as portions of what Josh and Julie had.  We headed home and ended the long day early.   Saturday was the big day, the reason we were all gathered...Joan's birthday celebration!  Josh left in the morning to go to New Jersey originally to pick up Rick, though unfortunately he was not able to come, but got to hang out with him instead.  We just kicked around the apartment, watching Simpson's episodes, eating breakfast, getting ready, goofing around.  I was very mean and kept picking up Morgan and messing with her, trying to get her to wake up and play with me.  Finally she did when Julie brought her breakfast.  I apologized for bugging her and she said that was okay.  Man...she is the most sweet, polite kid!  Wait...I know lots of great kids...I'm not going to play favorites!  So, Joan's party was a success.  Everyone seemed to have a great time.  Food was tasty and plentiful, it was beautiful outside, family and friends were gathered, and there were lots of people to meet and lots of folks who had not seen each other in a long time.  It was sad when we had to say goodbye to Josh, Julie and Morgan in front of the restaurant.  Morgan started crying and it broke Jeremy and I's hearts. Jer and I wished that we could all live in the same town.  We miss hanging out with Josh, and now we miss the latest additions to the family.  It's nice to think about how it is just a beginning though, and not an ending.    Jeremy and I hopped in a cab with Rachel and Judie to head on to Grandma Bea's.  There, we got to relax and watch Joan open her presents!  I always love seeing what people pick out for others.  Joan seemed very pleased with the whole day.  We were happy to be surrounded by so much family!  I got to hang out more with Rachel, which is always a good time, and eventually Peter and Joanne, followed closely by Chris and Juhani with their new girlfriends Carlin and Rebecca, showed up.  After lots of gabbing, suddenly it was around 8:30!  Time raced by on Saturday.  We all walked out together, but then Peter and Joanne caught a cab.    So...Chris, Carlin, Juhani, Rebecca, Jeremy and I all headed for Chris's car which was parked a ways away.  Lots of laughing and getting to know one another.  When we made it to the car, Chris folded up the backseat so that four of us could sit Native-American style (the preferred nomenclature) back there while he and Carlin had the luxurious front seats.  It gave me a new perspective on how scary drivers in New York are.  We went all the way uptown to where Peter and Joanne live (81st Street!) By the end, Juhani and I were clinging on for dear life and trying not to hurl.  (Chris is a very good driver, but was giving us a hard time!)  We were very grateful when he let us out, our legs buckling beneath us.  We decided not to go up to Peter and Joanne's, but went instead to a good Mexican place around the corner where we had a very delayed dinner and drinks.  Mmm...strawberry margaritas...so tasty and alcohol ladden...After many laughs, stories and such Jeremy and I called it a night and found the nearest subway.  We made it home around 1:45 am and went to bed almost immediately (We first had to make sure our neighbor Nancy upstairs wasn't dead like we thought she may be, but that is a whole other story!)  So, the long day was done.  We were tired, happy, and still a little sad, but we had a great weekend.  Thanks to all who were involved.  Oh...Julie...sorry we never got a  urlLink Manhattan Special.  (I just wanted another excuse to use the highlight-y thing!)

      ...funny tails...  On Friday Lola and I did our usual perusing of the Union Square Farmer's Market and obtained a couple of chocolate chip cookies.  We plopped down on a bench and I, of course, devoured mine pretty quickly.  Lola began to throw little bits of her cookie for the birds, which swarmed immediately.  I suggested that birds should probably not eat chocolate, but she didn't seem to agree with me.  Soon a couple of curious squirrels came over, as well as the mysterious pigeon boy who does not say much but held bread in his hand while the birds landed on him.  I couldn't really tell if he was a real person or just some sort of interesting spirit.  Anyway...Lola hand-fed a piece of cookie to one of our squirrel friends.  Well, he took a liking to it so much that he snuck up a minute later and snatched the remaining half cookie out of Lola's hand and took off!  We watched him nibble on it delicately in a flower bed, turning it around and around in his T-Rex style hands.  Then he got a good grip on it with his mouth and scurried up the neighboring tree.  Lola claimed she didn't like the cookie much anyway.  I know she was just thrilled to have such close contact with the animal she has been talking about wanting for a pet for days.  ...mythical birds...  Last night we did the most unusual for us...we went to a pub (Peter McManus - or McManus' as it is known to insiders- to be exact) to watch the Jayhawks humiliate Marquette.  Adam K. and I got a head start on drinking while waiting for Jer to show up from work.  It was a good time.  We enjoyed the game, but mainly got caught up in talking, eating simple pub food, and drinking beers and cider.  The only drawback was that McManus' reffered to french fries as...da da duh...freedom fries.  Sigh. The Jayhawks were...great!  Will they win on Monday?  Will Roy Williams stay on as coach?  Why does Kirk Hinrich look like a Beastie Boy?  We shall soon find out...well, probably not about Kirk.  Anyway...I'm not even a KU alum (but 3 of my grandparents and both of my parents are) but I must say I have a spot in my heart reserved for KU basketball.

      ...little...  The day after tomorrow I am heading back West.  I get to visit with family and friends, attend a cool textile conference, celebrate my sister's birthday, and close on our HOUSE!  I'm sure people are sick of hearing about it...then again, I'm not sure how many people actually read this.  Ah well.  I can't wait to get my hands on paint samples and start going nuts on the house...joy.  Last Saturday I volunteered, for some odd reason, to go up to Beacon, New York, and work at the Dia's new art space up there.  It is huge and very busy.  It wasn't very hard work, but I had to get up early in order to make it there in time (it's an 80 min. train ride from Grand Central) and by the end of the day I really wanted to just quit seeing people.  The train ride was...fantastic.  Hanging around all day was the kind of mist that refuses to burn off.  The telephone wires dipped like curvy sheet music alongside the water.  I saw places that would have been my secret spots when I was a kid.  It made me wonder why people live in the city when this is so close by...New York does have it's good points and it's own brand of beauty, but...man, that train ride was great.

      ...my precious saturday...  The coffee pot exhaled like a sighing dragon, moist and whistful.  My knife paused at the outer flesh of the strawberry, then with a little bit of effort, cut it's way through stopping at my thumb.  A cat's hungry meow wanting approval to begin eating.  Sweat shirt sleeves pushed up to my elbows revealing wrists that have gotten a little more slender lately; the natural shedding of winter pounds.      Cold water poured into a freshly cleaned mason jar.  Brown sugar and half-and-half mingling in the base of a big, ceramic mug before the introduction of strong coffee.  Hair pulled into a sensible ponytail, my part is a little crooked.  He always says these shoes are more like expensive slippers, but I could not resist their shade of blue and excellent craftsmanship.  My jeans gather at my ankles, and my t-shirt is almost too thin to decently wear in public.  First take that water out and place it up, away from curious, delicate cat paws.  Then the cereal bowl and coffee.  I place everything on the table, turn on a movie, sink into the couch, slip off my shoes and enjoy my Saturday.

      ...keep those fingers crossed...  This WILL go through, this WILL go though, this WILL go through...That is what I keep chanting.  If it works, then we will own a beautiful house in Kansas City in a couple of weeks!  I am so not kidding.  It has wood floors, a cool fire place with fancy brick patterns around it, a built in niche above for displaying whatever one feels like, plaster walls, 4 bedrooms (one of which will be my studio!), lots of light, a quiet street within walking distance of many cool things - Brookside shopping area, SRO video (coolest local video store ever), our favorite Indian restaraunt Taj Mahal, our good friend Johnny, a little artist co-op store, a good coffee shop, etc., enough space and light for a veggie garden, and so much more!  I have not even seen it yet!  I have seen pictures on the web, but Jeremy has seen it in real life, and I completely trust his judgement.  This is sooo much fun!  I still cannot believe that everything is happening, and so quickly.  I keep waiting for someone to snatch it all away from us, but I do not think that is actually going to happen *knock on wood.*  I have been knocking on a lot of wood lately - not THAT wood sicko...wait...maybe I am the only sicko around here.  So...Jeremy comes home tonight, which is FANTASTIC.  Things just aren't as exciting without him.

      ...obrigada...  Boppin' along 5th avenue with fresh food co-op purchases in my roll-y cart (mmm...kale, baby wild ramps, patty pan squash, avocado...and all organic) when what should overcome me...Portugal!  I smelled grilling meat and sardines with a little salt rubbed on them.  There was a slight breeze, perfect temperature...sigh...where are those lazy days?  Though,these days are not bad...just different.    I also discovered that the woman on the corner a block away from our place who sells the fried meat pockets has ones with just cheese!  Yay!  I can partake in fried goodness too!  And how good it was with a little Tapatio hot sauce sprinkled on.  Maybe I should go down to the subway and see if the whole-mango-sliced-up-in-a-zip-lock-bag-with-a-fork people are there.  I love street food!!!

      ...candy wrappers from heaven...  In the wake of some bumblebee dirigibles was the scent of four years of my life.  Suddenly every pore was filled with those memories of dusty yarn, late nights, solvents, baggy pants with pockets, stink of 500 students, laying on the lawn, every face being known, small classes, the clang-shush of a loom, the slightly sour earth smell of clay, crazy apartment, passion, tears, fights, and a great time.  Who knew I would have found it again on 22nd Street between 9th and 8th in New York City?

      ...a new york minute...  So, for about the last week I have been really into trying to cram in New York-y stuff I have been meaning to do all along, but never bothered to do until now.  It's been great!  Now it will be even harder to leave...  My first Lola-free day after Dia I headed down to the Lower East Side  to pick up a couple food items.  We were in the middle of a crazy heat wave, which made walking a chore.  I first went to   urlLink Kossar's Bialys  and picked up a baker's dozen.  Then I took a few steps down the street and bought a quart of half-sours (with a couple new pickles thrown in) at the  urlLink Pickle Guys.   The most well-known pickle place in NYC is probably Gus's Pickles, but they moved to Orchard Street, and the guy who runs Pickle Guys used to work for Gus's.  They have a big war going on, but I read on  urlLink chow hound  that the Pickle Guys have slightly lower prices and are just as good, if not possibly a little better.  I don't know.  I do know that I picked up some amazing pickles.  It's such a fun place just to see...barrels of pickles, plus olives, pickled tomatoes, garlic, celery, peppers, etc.  It smells wonderful in there too!  As for other New York stuff I have been up to, yesterday I went to  urlLink Coney Island  to help celebrate Lola turning 5!  What a fun place for so many reasons!  Unfortunately, Jer could not come.  We first met in the Museum and had some pizza, cake, and pinata smashing.  Actually, it was really terrifying because at one point the kids just were tearing at the poor unicorn with their hands.  Kate also got smashed in the chest  with the pole!  Yow.  Then we headed to the kiddie park and got to ride for a couple hours free.  It was gorgeously sunny, the beach is right there, the kids and adults were having tons of fun...I only rode a couple of things.  I went on the free fall with Lola and some of her friends, and then later I took on the  urlLink Wonder Wheel  with Seth, two other parents and three kids.  We only rode on the stationary cars on the outside of the wheel instead of the ones that swing like crazy on the inside.  It was still totally awesome!  Ferris wheels are my favorite!  After that, things were kind of winding down, so I swung by  urlLink Nathan's  for some cheese fries and a coke, then got on the W and headed for home.  I'm really going to miss New York, and especially Brooklyn.  Kansas City will always be home, but Brooklyn has found it's way permanently into my heart too, and I am sad to leave.  I definitely want our future children to know New York well, and feel comfortable there.  Anyway...Jeremy and I are going back to Coney Island next weekend since he has never been there, and there was a lot I did not do!

      ...now i'm a believer...  So, I am really no longer going to doubt Johnny.  For months he has been saying he was just going to show up one day in Brooklyn.  All last week he kept telling us, "See you on Friday!"  Didn't believe him.  So...Friday after work I headed on over to Peter and Joanne's for dinner with them, Bea, Dollar Bill (Jeremy's cousin) and Jer.  I'm enjoying the conversation, eating cheese and crackers when who should come sauntering in with Jeremy...Johnny!  That old trickster!  We had a good night - Thai food, fantastic hospitality, talking, etc.   After leaving Peter and Joanne's, the three of us headed back to Brooklyn to go to the bar Freddie's where Brian and Laura's band, Dust Dive, was playing for Brian's birthday.  Their music is...sigh...beautiful.  It breaks my heart.  Then it was home, home, home...late.  Saturday Johnny and I decided to adventure since Jeremy was at work.  We had lunch at Daisy's diner then decided that  urlLink this  was where we needed to head.  This museum is actually a room, and not much more.  After entering a non-descript building on Union Square East and finding "suite" 600, we walked into a room of people whose heads all turned as they proclaimed, "Wow!  Real visitors!"  We were given the grand tour and had it explained to us that they rent out their space for various groups to meet in.  We had interrupted the Star Wars fan club of New York meeting!  There were no hipsters in sight, and we even had one guy say, "I am the comic book guy." They all cleared out soon after and we could actually get to the walls, which featured work from the book "Broad Appeal" - all cartoons by women artists.  As we were talking to our tour guide once again, another worker (ponytail, pale skin, black clothes) came out with a stack of papers and said,"What, praytell, shall I do with these?"  Wow.  It was a good time, and I highly recommend supporting them if you ever find your way to New York. I'm going to sum up the rest of the day/night quickly - we left, called Bill, walked many blocks in the rain laughing, got to the Dia, caught a cab to Guru for dinner with Jer, walked around the East Village, had a sticker booth picture made of us with a Zapatista frame, met up with Judie and Bill at Gem Spa,  Judie left and Bill came with us to Brooklyn, partied late into the night with beverages and such, Bill threw down some rhymes, lots of stories and laughing, we tossed Bill into a cab about 1:30, I crashed, the others crashed, Bea called us at 6:00 a.m. freaking out wondering where Bill was (he had slept in the lobby apparently.)  Then it was time for work...  Sunday passed as it usually does...no need to go into it. Monday we bid farewell to Johnny (we miss you buddy!) and hello to furniture and art that Rick passed on to us.  This was the last time I get to see Rick before he moves to South Carolina.  I don't know when I will see him next...this is sad.  I have become close to Jeremy's family here, and it is hard to move away, and have them move away.  I guess these things must be done.  Good luck with your train trip, Rick, as well as settlin' in to a new place.  I'm exhausted by all of these words.

      ...ah yes, the where...  I am going to use the cool link-y thing that  urlLink Julie  showed me so long ago.  Besides getting to do fun things like hand over large cashier's checks in exchange for land that long ago was just that...land, and hang out with good people, last week I attended the  urlLink Surface Design Association conference.   I attended lectures, panel discussions, and gallery shows - all pertaining to the fiber arts.  I also went to the opening dinner where who else should be playing but  urlLink The Wilders  who played at our wedding!  It wasn't too surprising considering that Phil of The Wilders works for the Art Institute where this grand conference was being held.  Anyway, it was great to see them, but most of all to hear them!  They are good people.   So, I had a very packed week...I missed my husband though.  I wish we could have been in the same place!  Well...sometimes it just can't work out.    Here are a couple of other links I just feel like throwing in for the heck of it:  urlLink Nest magazine -so cool.   I will be getting a subscription now that I have a permanent address.  Our friend  urlLink Adam  and if you are really cool you can visit his  urlLink blog.   Here's one more little tidbit...did you know that Springfield, Missouri is the birthplace of the way most people enjoy  urlLink cashew chicken?   I was doubtful at first...the information came from our friend Johnny who has been known to stretch the truth...then again, he knows many things...Anyway, we did a google search and lordy it is true!  Save us all.

      ...pulling the strings together...  Lately I have been feeling a little like the miniature hot air balloons my Dad used to make in college out of paper bags and candles...the ability to go far - soar high, but delicate...I might catch fire at any moment.  It has been constant going, going, going...but when is it never?  I've been a bit of a complainicus I must say - Jeremy hears most of it, a little on edge, a little more manic songstressing, yet...I am happy for so many reasons.    Here are my reasons to celebrate today: the sudden tan-ness of my arms, Frank leaning his pink nose into the waves of the song coming from my mouth, a sweaty jar of Coke leaving rings on the beat-up desk, picking out paint colors for the house...brazilian blue, artichoke heart, laguna yellow, burnt cumin..., little kisses that cover your face, the hot sauce burn of Tapatio on my lips, wearing flip flops, seeing the cycle of life displayed in the gutter even though it was extremely sad, music that you can't sit still through, and...last but not least...it's Rick's birthday!  A real reason to celebrate!  Happy Birthday Rick! I just realized today that next Monday will be the first time I will have seen him in awhile, and the last time I will for x amount of time considering he leaves for South Carolina in a little over a week.  Everyone is on the go...I hope none of you catch on fire before you land.

      ...last call...  Our internet is being taken away from us today.  Think of it...no connection by that means for probably two weeks...shudder.  I can't believe how tied in with it I am.  I didn't even get email until I was in college!  It will be okay...I can focus on other things...like how we are getting cell phones!  (They still have not arrived...it was a whole drama yesterday that ended with Jeremy telling them not to call us until they are ready to say that 2 cell phones will be here by Tuesday...they called, so we will see) That, I am still not too sure about how I feel.  Jeremy's is for his work, which makes sense, but mine is not so much for that purpose.  Definitely don't want to make it my primary phone, no no no!  I'm sure I'll enjoy it, but I'm the person who still talks into them funny, like I don't trust that the people can hear me if the mouthpiece is halfway up my cheek.  I've seriously only talked on one three times.  Anyway...technology...bah!    New York...who knew a Kansas City girl could fall in love.  Don't get me wrong...I am VERY excited to be moving back, but I love my neighborhood here, and riding subways, and walking around trying to figure out who it would be okay to make eye contact with, and being able to have any type of food I want at most likely any hour, and most of all different family and friends.  I know we are coming back for visits every year-ish, but...sigh.  Alright, it's list time...all New York lists...  Famous People I Saw (or almost saw) While Living Here: Jacques Torres John Waters Lou Reed Laurie Anderson Duff Pauly Shore (Heather and I were walking and she saw him sitting, but I was spacing off and totally missed everything) Rachel Dratsch Robert Whitman Chuck Close Jo Baer uhhh...alright, I'm tired of this list  All Time Favorite Experiences In New York:  Zoe greeting me every time I come in or out of our building, sitting on the beach at Fire Island with the sky all gray and a fine salt mist devouring me, walking to the co-op especially on Saturdays,  going out to Mexican food with Juhanni, Rebecca, Chris, and Carlin, this one lunch - a long time ago- with Adam and Angela...it was a Saturday, Indian food, and then a great stroll down 1st ave..., hanging out with Lola in Union Square almost every day, going to the Comic and Cartoon museum with Johnny, having Heather over for making-dinner-watching-Sunday-cartoons nights while she still lived here, chatting with Corrie up in the Dia cafe, getting to see Dust Dive twice, long talks with Nancy and Richard upstairs, meeting and getting to know Adam K, when Lola's family would give me a ride home...never boring!, shutting the door in Luis's face,  that special corner on our block where you can spy on the Statue of Liberty, Ukranian Borchst...any Monday I want, dinner at Bea's - telling stories, Joan's birthday party, our wedding reception at Guru!, spending time with Rick, dinner at Peter and Joanne's, fourth of July this year, hanging out with Arno and Susie, all the things I noticed walking around town, the subway stop for The Natural History Museum,  having Josh, Julie and Morgan visit, riding on the ottomans with Christine at work, dancing in the office at work, bringing home lots of good food from the co-op, sitting on the stoop and having people stopping to talk, flying over New York knowing we are about to touch down, those little tile faces I've been seeing around, running into Jeremy by surprise on the subway, riding the Wonder Wheel with an absolutely terrified Jer (hey...he suggested it!), our anniversary...brunch at Sidewalk-walking around the East Village, ...too much more to list.  Lot's is going to happen in those two weeks...Rachel turns 14, driving with two kitty boys to K.C., our fridge gets delivered (it's stainless steel with a freezer on the bottom...pretty), I visit my Dad in the nursing home for the first time...Here's to everything that has already occurred and to the unknown, may it be as fun, mysterious, heart tearing, frustrating, lovely, wild, boring, tiring, and inspiring as all that already is. Safe travels to everyone...and love!

      ...it's getting hot in here...  Last night we met up with  urlLink Adam  to go have a little dinner, then head to the Cutting Room where his friend  urlLink Adam Dugas  was singing a few songs, including his version of Nelly's It's Getting Hot in Here!  Also performing were  urlLink The World Famous Pontani Sisters.   Glittery costumes, huge smiles, fake eyelashes, old fashioned dance moves...bringing back the burlesque atmosphere!  It was the best show I have seen in a long time.  Plus, there was Dana Pontani (singing), the Fisherman Xylophonic Burlesque Orchestra (awesome!  the xylophone guy wears a fez!), Jo Boobs ( does not show it all, but can twirl her tassels well), and Oh De Twirlette.  Yay!

      ...stunted...  Wouldn't you know that the urge to just sit down and super focus on art would come at the most inopportune time?  There are boxes to pack, jobs to finish, people to say goodbye to, streets to walk on one more time before moving, things to eat that you just can't find elsewhere, etc.  No rest for the wicked.  I also have a sudden need to look at things that are already packed, such as certain books.  It is hard to believe that the time is so near.  Sigh.  I love our house we are moving to, and I love Kansas City, but...I love New York now too.  Even though I like to complain about the city often (hey...from what I can tell most New Yorkers do) it's really grown on me.  Thankfully, we have many reasons to visit: Adam, Angela, Bea, Judie, Brian, Joanne, Peter, Adam K., Nancy, Christine, Corrie...  Jeremy just called me blog horn leg horn!  He makes everything better!

      ...burn a dollar...  Jeremy and I are not huge supporters of July 4th, but we do enjoy fireworks.  Fortunately, his cousin (actually first cousin once removed) Susan was in town from Nepal, so we were able to enjoy them from the balcony of May's old apartment.  It was good to see Susie.  She always is fun to talk with.  Her friend Viva, who is her neighbor in Nepal, was also in town.  By the time the fireworks came, Francis from across the hall was over, and their friend Azalia was there as well.    I could not believe the display that New York has!  We could actually see two different ones from our vantage point, but one was far superior as we could see all three parts of it.  The view from May's bedroom was even more spectacular.  I had a hard time deciding which view I preferred.  On the balconey, you felt more a part of the whole city and could hear the collective ahhing and clapping of millions of people.  We had been watching, as dusk grew, people gathering on the rooftops of the surrounding buildings.  After dark, we could only see them in the flashes from the fireworks and hear that they were there, and very much alive.  At one point a small boy yelled out, "I wish this was every night!"  I think many people replied to him, "Me too!"  The fireworks were like neurons, and petri dish growth, and flowers, and things from every part of nature come to life in an extra huge version of gold, violet, red, blue, white, green, orange explosion!  I was fighting back tears at how something so simple can be so beautiful.  It brought lots of memories, especially from when I was a kid, to the surface.  If you were to have asked me at that moment, I probably would have told you my childhood was terrific, because I could only remember those sticky, summer nights where bug repellent, barbeque smoke, and fresh cut grass are wrestling to have the largest smell.  Fireflies are creating there own light display every night, and don't seem to mind being caught every once in a while.  You can stay up later, because the sun doesn't ever want to set, and there is no worry of having to go to school the next day.  There are more excuses than ever to eat candy, drink soda, and nosh on things all day long.  That's exactly what we did at Suzie's!  Mmm...cookies, grapes, Coke, hummus, potato chips...I wish we could have stayed in that moment longer, but...it's good to know that there are so many moments in time where I feel that...I don't want to leave or ever have it end.  Luckily, I try not to have much space at all in between those times.  Those are the times when I don't worry about anything, and I don't get so frustrated that I proclaim, "Ugh!  I can't stand people!"  There probably needs to be less of that in everyone's life.  ...family matters...  We finally downloaded Powerpoint so that we could look at the cd of family photographs and stories that we got from Rick, via Arno (Jeremy's second cousin I believe)  It is an extremely long slideshow, but you just don't want to stop!  I'm interested in any person's photograph collection, but this was extra good because it's Jeremy's family.  I think there is somewhere around six to seven hundred photographs spanning from 1900 to 2002/3!  Arno had, and still has, a huge task ahead of him, and the end result is great!!!  I think this is how I may want to organize all of the stuff for my family...we'll see.

      ...open up and say ahhh...  The rains have been sent to us!  I'm sitting up here in our cozy little tv room, typing away, drinking strong coffee, and watching the puddles in our neighbor's patio chairs grow larger by the second.  When the rain first started a day or two ago you could almost hear the grass and other plants collectively gulp.  My favorite thing though is the fact that in our kitchen the rain sounds like popcorn exploding as it hits the stove exhaust pipe on the roof!

      ...hide your sons and daughters...  Yowzer, we are back on line!  It wasn't too bad being away.  I could do it again easily.  We just got back at 2:30 this morning from Detroit where we had to bid adieu to Joan and Rachel.  Even though it was an extremely short visit, we had a fantastic time.  Jer and I got to have Rachel to ourselves for a good portion of a day...she is just the coolest.  I am so happy that Rachel is in my life.  Joan made a really yummy meal of veg sheppard's pie and green beans with shitakes. Mmmm.  Jer and I had a good breakfast with just Joan that was fun.  I love my in-laws!  Our stuff arrived less than a week ago.  I immediately set up the kitchen, as it is a very important room for me, and am now focusing on my studio.  Life is good.  It's very weird to drive almost everywhere.  Not that I have been wanting to walk in the 105 degree heat, but I'm missing out on all the little stuff you get to notice while strolling around town.  There are other things though...we had about 15 peace lillies (our friend Matt told us they were actually surprise lillies) surface in our back yard.  My Daddad has some too that were transferred years ago from my great-grandfather's garden.  I think I am going to take some of those bulbs this fall.  We have a chorus of crickets in our basement that sing us to sleep - Bones caught one and ate it with a sickening crunch!  We have lots of spiders patrolling the premises making sure that no corner goes un-woven.  There is an organic farmer's market about a mile away from us on Saturday mornings!  Everything is coming together.

      ...how prophetic...  Well...what a couple of weeks it has been.  I was not really prepared for any of it...during the evening of Monday, July 21st, my father passed away unexpectedly in a sense.  That night...I can't even really talk about that night.  The next morning everything got picked up...taken away so quickly...then we ate our final slice of Aniello's pizza, shoved everything in the car including the cats as loud, electric pops of thunder started breaking loose.  I hopped behind the wheel and we had one of the scariest drives to Pennsylvania (due to horrible storms) that I have ever experienced.  Everything happened so fast...when we arrived in town on Thursday, I immediately went to a meeting at the place where the memorial was going occur.  As of today, our belongings have still not arrived and are not scheduled to for another week and a half!  Never use Mayflower!  My father...this is all I want to say about him...he was a lot of things, but the things I have been remembering the most is his love for us, and really for life around him.  I've been learning even more about him having to go through his belongings.  I've found the rolls of photos taken solely of the television during the moon landing, slides he took himself of celestial things through the telescope that he built, letters he wrote defending his work and actions when employers accussed him of things like not doing stuff in a timely manner, etc., stuff about the Registar system that he developed, his slide rule, his bowling ball, his old camera, his shoe shine kit, so many papers with equation after equation...notes... I really wish I could have been here... I can't really talk about it anymore, so I'm not going to.   So...yeah...our stuff is not here, but the house is!  It's a good house.  Kansas City is certainly here and real.  Everything slipped into place so perfectly - driving, visiting friends and family, knowing where to get anything.  Whenever I have thought about New York it has seemed not real.  We lived a similar life there in many senses, but in others it was so different!  No one here really knows that life we had, and we have been so busy that Jeremy and I have not really discussed it much.  New York worked it's way into my body, and I'm not sure I want to let it go.  I guess I do not have to, as we are planning to return many times.  Kansas City is great...the cicadas are busy talking all day and part of the night, Jeremy bought a truck that is a fraternal twin to the one he had to give up before we moved to Brooklyn, and I can hop over to my Mom's, Daddad's, sister's, etc. whenever I want.  New York...what are you up to?  I'm picturing right now what is likely happening on 14th Street, on 5th avenue, at the Dia, on 23rd Street, in the East Village, at the Buncher's, on Fire Island, at the co-op, in the subway...what a different entity New York is...not better than anywhere else, every place is wonderful in some way...just...I don't know.  Well...I need breakfast  I still don't have regular computer access for another two weeks or so (by the time we hook up internet.) Hoping whoever is out there is well...please tell me you are well.

      ...i'm falling...  It's almost my birthday month!  Yes, I declare the entire month of October as my own.  This is absolutely my favorite time of year.  I love that I can still wear summery clothes most of the time, but that at night I need to put on a sweater.  Soups, chilis, stews and such are much tastier in the fall.  Halloween is by far the best holiday, and this year we get to super decorate for it, and we should actually have kids that want to trick-or-treat at our place!    Today the first leaves started to fall from the trees, and I noticed at the tip tops of some that the leaves had turned.  Fall makes me a little melancholy (spelling?  one l right?)  I know death and hibernation are coming for nearly everything.  It's a chance to reflect and release things and hope to survive to be reborn in spring.  I really like this aspect of fall.  This is kind of a central theme to my life...my name actually means "of the resurrection."  I love the image of the phoenix, periodically going up in flames only to come back again to repeat the whole process.  I suppose lots of people can relate to that, so I'm not saying it's a unique thing to me by any means.  Hmmm.  Enough reflection...let's go drink some warm apple cider...and eat donuts...mmm...donuts.

      ...chester drawers...  Jeremy and I picked up a handy piece of my old furniture from my Ma's that is perfect for stashing socks, t-shirts, underwear and such.  In order to do that though, I had to clear out the memories: cards for every holiday, elementary writings and yearbooks, stacks of notes illegally passed in class, old photos and objects that were once so important.  Luckily I could part with a paper sacks worth of stuff, so I have less to find a new home for.  Sometimes I wish I was a minimalist.

      ...saturday, in the park, blah blah blah rest of the lyrics...  Everything today is wet.  There is a mist outside that makes all the plants want to give off their best shade of green before they begin to turn.  Our  neighborhood is dripping with huge trees, flowers, long grass, and vines overtaking whatever stands still for awhile.   No one seems to be awake today.  I know other people are somewhere in town, because I saw them at the farmer's market not too long ago.  70th Terrace is quiet.  Anyone with sense is still in bed, excited that quilts have needed to return.   This is when I listen...no need to talk except for the occassional exchange with a kitty.  The cicadas died out with the hot weather, so now all of the other insects can be heard singing their pleas for mates.  They mix in with the questioning purrs of Bones, the wood floors creaking under delicate cat paws and me shifting in my chair, the constant hum of the computer and click clicky of keys, fingers rubbing on a ceramic bowl, green tea juicily slurping into my mouth, and the distant sounds of what few cars seem to be out there this morning, but I have yet to see from my window.

      ...whatever happens...  I wish there was some sort of vaccum that could suck all of the snot from my head, yet not touch my brain.  I would appreciate that right about...now.    My Mom was adopted by an almost all black cat.  Just in time for Halloween!  She named him Spooky.  The fact that she took him in is very funny considering all of my life she has not enjoyed cats.  Spooky worked his magic on her though, and they are great companions.  He is very sweet and declawed, and she has something to talk baby talk to and to calm her down a bit.  We are working on moving Rick to Kansas City soon.  I'm pretty excited.  I like having family near by (well...yeah, yeah I do) and he can meet my family, and check out all the things we love about Kansas City, and I'm sure find things that we don't even know about!    The other day we were making our way through the Westport Art Fair when we realized, "Oh!  We're right by Murray's Ice Cream Shop!  How odd...I almost forgot it was there!"  Murray's is only the best ice cream in town.  No flavors felt right until my eyes fell upon the name *Pink Grapefruit Champagne Sorbet*  Mmmm...delicious.  I think it was the most satisfying frozen experience I have had all summer.

      ...skeletons in my closet (actually they're on my front door)...  The day of all days is here!  My eyes keep getting drawn back to the large bowl of candy I fixed up this morning - junior mints, shock tarts, reece's peanut butter cups, milk duds, gumballs...drool...Must take my mind off of sweet, sweet candy...must not become diabetic...  So instead I am focusing on sounds today.  The tornado siren-like squeal of the dryer, the rustle of embroidery thread repeatedly being pulled through linen, pops of old wood floors, the wet hiss of the coffee pot, and the giant BOOM of a transformer blowing this morning that tore me from my dream world.  The power was only gone an hour or so.  Tonight we do the dance of passing out candy to  kids.  Jeremy and I discussed the various approaches to doing this, and I believe my way won out - mainly because I say so.  He thinks the kids should be allowed to take their own candy from the bowl.  While I remember this being a wonderful thing when I was a kid, now I can only see little, sticky fingers shoveling as much candy as they can into their bag.  I'm for passing out one or two pieces per kid, and I get to randomly decide what those pieces shall be.  You can trade up later kid...I'm not taking requests.  Jeremy thinks this is another attempt of mine to take kids down a notch.  Hey...I just want to make sure everyone gets a piece of the pie...er...I mean candy.

      ...stranded at the drive-in...  We tossed an armload of blankets and pillows in the car, and took off Saturday night to meet Christine, Evan, Liz, and Hillary for a double-feature at the drive-in.  Texas Chainsaw Massacre is very frightening when viewed in your own car, surrounded by night, and having to go to the bathroom, but not wanting to go anywhere by yourself after that flick.  We survived though.  I pulled the blanket up over my eyes a couple of times...of course it is a loosely crocheted blanket, so I could still see anyway.  Kill Bill Vol. 1 was the next movie.  Very good again, but quite violent.  I love the way Tarantino matches up music to what is happening in the film.  Sunday... I don't know what I did to deserve this, but Jer made french toast and fake bacon for our very late breakfast.  Yummmm.  Then we just lazed around with the various visitors that called on us, until Jer had to go to work.  Fantastic.

      ...till next year...  The party is over.  At least, the birthday party, not the party that is everyday of my life! (ha.)  A quarter of a century does not feel that different than last year, at least so far.  We'll see what is in store for this one...  The sun is still shining, and the leaves are still breaking delicately beneath my feet.  Halloween is not far away, and thankfully we have not eaten all of the candy...well...I had to buy another bag or two that we haven't opened, but we never finished off the original one!  My head is overflowing with things I want to work on in studio, strangers are calling Jer to have their pianos tuned, and the cats are still rearranging the rugs every night.

      ...what's goin' on...  A cold rain is falling outside, and the sun is almost gone for the day.  Jeremy is already at work  for the night.  I am currently reading "My Invented Country" by Isabel Allende and "Stupid White Men" by Michael Moore.  This morning I started my "Sweatin' to the Oldies" workout.  Richard Simmons is pretty fun.  I've been working on art and cleaning the house.  my birthday is tuesday shhhh...Tonight I am going to watch Friends and ER.  Tomorrow I am going to make Morrocan carrot spread, onion dip, and hummus for an upcoming shin-dig.  I have begun to master medium-level spider solitaire.  I need to write some letters.

      ...who knew...  I dropped my car off this morning for an oil change, etc., and, thankfully, had to walk home.  It's only about a ten-minute walk, but in that time I learned lots about Gregory (the street) that I had never known just driving on it. A few trees have some bluish-white mossy spots on them.  They come right after the tree that has seaweed-like pods hanging from it.  I am not sure if these have the same delicious sounding/feeling pop-hiss to them as the seaweed does, but they looked like it.  There was also a stretch of trees that not only has regular, dark green leaves on it, but light green ones curled down like little tongues waiting to lick those who walk under it's branches.  The tongues cradled some sort of berry, most likely not edible. I think in our neighborhood that the plants are ready to take over.  If only people would leave them alone!  The sidewalks are already severely buckled in some parts, with plants sneaking their way out of every crevice.  Lots of people have ivy creeping up their houses or fully engulfing their chimneys.  If we all disappeared, it would not take very long for the ferns, trees, flowers, ivy, all of them, to claim everything as their own.  They silently pass the time...waiting for the long moments of their uprising...lucky plants...

      ...heavy whipping cream...  Now you can witness how truly flip-floppy I am...going from serious thought to...  I just wandered downstairs for a brief interlude and found Bones, our resident heat monkey, sitting in front of the air vent in the dining room, lapping up the waves of warm air.  I'm seriously considering heating up a sticky bun my mother bought for me even though it is practically midnight.  Conan is coming on t.v.  (that sounds a bit crude...sorry) and I find him highly amusing...in fact so much that I am going to say, goodnight.

      ...how does this happen...  Do you ever zoom out from your life and realize how ridiculous so many things are with it, and with the world in general?  Here I am...I own a house with my best friend and partner, I currently have no income because my husband is making money and I am a semi-privelaged person, I have lots of things...in fact I have so many that I get rid of tons of clothing, paper, whatever each year, I never miss a meal unless I choose to, I have never had an act of physical violence done against me, I went to college - to art shcool none the less, I have traveled all over the place... I am so lucky.  How did I get this place in the scheme of things, yet other people have none of what I do?  Did I do something really good in a past life, or am I destined to do not as well in the next one?  Does God or whatever there is just like some people better for no good reason?  And why am I not doing more with what I have to help those who have not?...is it even "better" to be the one who has?...what is the perfect existence,  when you have what you need - food, shelter, love, good health, a whole range of emotions - and not too many things to bog you down - jobs, obligations, guilt, wants, and you know of no one else who needs anything?  Does that exist?   I have had times throughout my life so far where I fight harder than usual for basic rights for all, for justice, for universal happiness, for something - anything...then...life sucks me back in and it is easy to forget other people.  I walk down the street with a veil.  We think it is so horrible that Muslim women are forced to fully cover in public, but we are a society that is still covered ourselves, and we like it!  You just can't see ours and it is self-imposed. It's so easy to sit here - in my jeans, t-shirt, and cowboy boots - and type on my computer, and drink my fresh water, and expound upon what is wrong with the world.  What are my solutions?  This is the toughy...I don't know.  I guess I will try to be a good person and not use too much of anything, though that's easier said than done for the lifestyle we have become accustomed to.  I will raise any children I have to please, please, please question things, and want to drink up any books, magazines, newspapers, people, dances, songs, art, animals, vistas, whatever that they come across, and to help, and love, and do something as long as they fully embrace it and believe in it.  I will do what I can before I burn (not in Hell, I don't believe in it...in actual flames...I want to be cremated) and try not to feel too guilty for what I cannot do.  That is very hard.  For now...universe...ever expanding (or is it actually shrinking?)...I love you, whatever happens, whether you take it all away or give me more (I really don't need more)...thank you for it all...please give other people breaks...please do something to equalize us all - or is that for us to figure out?

      ...birthday suit...  Happy Birthday to my wonderful husband Jeremy!  Like a fine wine, he gets better every year (and he was definitely not bad at all to begin with!)  Jeremy brings much happiness into my life, and others as well.  I don't know what I would do without you sweet potato!  I love you!   Last Saturday we paused for lunch at the New York Deli and Bakery, then continued on our walk to Forest Hill Cemetary.  This is all only a few blocks from our house, and happens to be the final resting spot of my Mama (Mom's mom), her parents Tola and Herbert, Herbert's parents, his sister and her husband, and Tola's brother and his wife, as well as a future plot for my Daddad...which is a little creepy to look at as he is still very much alive.  Anyway, on Sunday was the 15 year anniversary of Mama's passing, so we went to say hello.  We ended up walking around the cemetary (which is huge) for over an hour...checking out crazy mausoleums, and interesting tombstones.  As we headed for the gates, we noticed that the crows had formed a barrier that we must cross.  I got a little nervous, and prepared to offer them something shiny, but they were distracted and took off for some nearby trees.  Silly crows.  Saturday night we got to hang out at Scot and Marla's place.  It was Scot's birthday, but he failed to tell us that!  So...Scot...I'm outing you publically...happy birthday again...late...  Anyway, we had a good time, and were the first to arrive and the last to leave.  Why, do you ask?  Because we are those people.    Sunday was Mary's flute performance.  She is getting her PhD in flute, so this was no ordinary, 4th grade concert.  It let me see a whole new side of Mary.  We enjoyed it a lot.  Today the temperature is in the 70s.  Why am I in here typing?  Oh yeah...Jer is in the shower, then we are going out.  I'm looking forward to these upcoming days as there are many things I get to cook for our two Thanksgiving feast we get to attend...fruit salad, nutloaf, chocolate raspberry birthday cake, Fafa's (my great grandpa Herbert) caramels, Birdie's (my Dad's Mom's mom) swedish pecans, cheddar cheese buttermilk biscuits...drool...plus, soon I will start printing various cards - some to sell and some to send out for the holidays!  Yay!  I love having things to do.  The more I have to do, the better I use my time.  Happy Birthday again, Jer.

      ...much more relaxed...  On Friday, since Jeremy didn't have to work, we had a nice little date of slices of Joe's pizza, and seeing Lost In Translation at the Tivoli.  It was a very sweet movie, and shot nicely.  When we returned home, I treated myself to a nice, warm bath with my new bath salts and the rest of a bottle of white wine to sip.  Ahhhh.  I feel much better than earlier in the week.  Saturday we not only got the pleasure of hanging out with Kris and Joanna, but we got to babysit 1 1/2 year old Nora for a couple of hours.  I just want to make her laugh all the time!  She was so much fun to play with, and she talks a lot.  Besides all of this, I have been fairly non-stop working on my easy-cut print blocks for my alphabet cards.  I got the material on Thursday, and I haven't been able to keep my hands off of it.  Well, it's just past one a.m. and my hands are chilly...I spy Frank on the futon, so I think I am going to go steal some of his body heat.

      ...one toe over the edge...  I screamed at a man on the phone this morning...he's with the Mayflower moving company.  We got a letter in the mail today that just made a rage brew in me.  I wish my screaming could have penetrated the heart of the corporate beast like a sword...be felt throughout the whole body...make it quake and question.  Instead I was yelling at an outer scale.  I don't feel fully sorry for doing it, though I always feel pretty bad for yelling at anyone.  It brought up lots of issues.  I'm partly feeling the sting of realizing my own naivete and stupidity regarding the move, and it sucks having to admit it's not all on somebody else.  It also just transported me back to those days of summer, when everything was so right for awhile, and then just got dashed into the ground.  I guess I've been suppressing a lot of sadness towards what happened with my dad.  I just released it all on Jeremy...poor guy.  Then I felt the sudden need to blindly write something down here.  I don't really need to talk to anyone specifically, I guess I just need to have something concrete come out of me...something I can look at.  Things aren't that bad.  I love my husband, myself, our life, our cats, friends, family, our house.  Sometimes I need to realize it's okay to embrace sadness, and that it doesn't have to be put in a spot where no one can see it.  So...now I'm realizing other people besides me look at this.  Uh...hi...please don't think I'm crazy or depressed.  I'm normal...yeah...normal... :)

      ...just thinking...  My mind today keeps wandering to the painting that presides over my Daddad's living room.  I'm scanning over the seaweed covered rocks that shine in the moonlight.  The ships look so weathered, like the small town behind them in the distance, but not unhappy.  I'm trying to imagine myself on that beach.  You would need a thick, wool sweater I think.  Everything is moist with salt water...can't escape the smell.   A foghorn sounds...there are still some lights on in the town, though it must be past midnight.  I can see the moonlight playing on the surface of the water, trying to illuminate further than the first few inches.  I'll have to be content with not getting in the water, though I want it to cover me.  Too chilly. I think about how in her last years, Mama must have spent a lot of time looking at this painting.  I wonder if she pictured herself wherever it is supposed to be.  She saw beauty in that scene...she was the one who picked it out.  That painting is like a long, deep sigh.    This whole weekend has been trapped in the painting.  It's been days of garlic soup, hearty sweaters, perfectly cured cast-iron pans, fat ceramic mugs of coffee, thick ecru-colored cream, grey, chilly skies, fine mists, sewing by hand, warm cat cuddles, crunchy leaves, seeing your breath, drafty houses...

      ...grey days...  At first we thought Halloween was going to be a bust.  It was already 7:00, and we had yet to have any children come knocking.  The door was wide open, I was reading a book on the couch to take my mind off of my excitement.  Is there no such thing anymore as kids going around to houses?  Do they just go to shops for candy now?  What is wrong with the world today - isn't anything sacred?  Finally...two kids came!  Between 7:30 and 8:00 we had a good rush, and we got rid of all of our candy (thankfully...Jeremy and I still ended up with major sugar hangovers the next day)  Witches, a vampire, football player, racecar driver, carebear, princesses, ghosts, and many unidentifiable things graced our porch that night.  Woo-hoo...boo!

They were both amazing!  I want to learn more about the techniques of hair art...it's so beautiful.   This area has such great museums, and after today I am much more motivated to visit them.

      ...walkin' in a rainy wonderland...  This time of year is out-of-control!  In a good way.  I think I have been more socially active in the last week than in the past few months combined...well...that's a bit of an exaggeration I suppose.  Lots of friends are in town, and it is also a time for seeing lots of friends who are always in town, just busy people.    This is definitely my favorite time of year mail-wise.  Today was...well...like Christmas!  We received a package from Josh, Julie, and Morgan, as well as about five more holiday cards.  I actually did the thing where you hang the cards you receive around a door frame, or something similar.  I think it is required that you do that if you have a house.  Mainly I just enjoy looking at the interesting cards people make or pick out.  On non-holiday related tips, I have begun reading "Lonesome Dove," and am about a quarter of the way through it.  You should read this book!  Last year our friend Dylan read it while he stayed in our apartment, and he left his copy.  Then, Jeremy's Dad gave us his hard-bound volume before he moved.  It has just been sitting on one of our many bookshelves, silently waiting to be picked up.  I found myself perusing the shelves for something new to read, and fixed my eyes on it.  It has proven to be an excellent choice.  Otherwise...more people are marrying next year, and popping out children...not us...yet.  I am hoping that 2004 will be a year filled with much happiness, and not as much sadness, though I enjoy all of my emotions.  As for weather, since I always seem to have something to say about it, today is grey and rainy.  Maybe it is because when we were watching a rainy scene in "Igby Goes Down" last night I was thinking about how nice a good rainy day is sometimes.  That, of course, would be assuming that my thoughts had great powers, and the world revolved around me...which as far as I know it does not, thankfully.  I do not believe that it is supposed to be a snowy Christmas this year, though I guess one never can tell.  I just hope for family, friends, peacefulness, yummy food, and a few presents.

      ...what has happened to this place...  I just got done reading an article on Salon about the protests that happened in Miami at the end of last week.  Man...I really don't know what to say.  Is there something fundamentally wrong with the human animal?  How can you beat back senior citizens, children, all kinds of people, and actually defend that action, and feel good about it?!   The deal is everyone is different, and should have differing opinions.  It can make things difficult, but that's the beauty of free thought.  No one is better.  When I get pissed is when people don't think for themselves.  We align ourselves fully with the thoughts of our government, our party, our work co-horts, whoever!  It's not bad to agree, but to blindly chant U.S.A., U.S.A., U.S.A., or to hate someone because you are told to, or to watch T.V. all the time because that's what everyone else is doing...this sucks!  Do what you really believe, yet be compassionate along the way. Ugh.

      ...weather blog...  More snow!  More snow!  A couple of days ago the skies opened up and dropped upon us approximately five inches of snow as well as a bunch of sleet before hand.  Then, last night, it started again.  Pure snow.  I ended up spending the night at my sister's house, and when we woke up...snow!  The drive home was a teensy scary...slippy-slidey.  Once I was back at our house I declared, "No more outings today!"  Now it is the perfect Saturday.  My belly is full of tomato soup, grilled cheese, and coffee.  I can sit inside in warmth and peer out the windows at the still gathering flakes, while sipping on a variety of hot beverages.  I love being housebound in the winter!  There is so much here I want to do!

      ...bring it on...  Slowly this morning, I climbed the stairs, trying to balance my cup of juice, glass of water, and bowl of cereal.  Placing it all on the table beside the computer, I then plugged in the internet, turned on the computer, and opened up the blinds a tad.  I noticed the frost on the window first, then I saw it...snow!  Our first snow of the year is only one-half to one inch of accumulation, but it is still snow!  We saw a little bit when we were in Michigan for Thanksgiving, but it came after being there for a couple of days.  The trip was very nice.  Jeremy and I rolled up Wednesday night, expecting everyone to already be there, having a jolly old time.  As we discovered, only Alan arrived before us, and he was at the store when we got there!  So, we had a nice chat with him for a couple of hours, and just as he was ready to fall into bed, Josh, Julie, and Morgan arrived.  Meade, Lucas, and Liam followed not too long after.  The visit was:  hiking the dunes on Thanksgiving and being amazed at Morgan's ability, good food and lots of it, competitive scrabble, trivial pursuit, sleeping bag wrestling, talking, talking, talking, Morgan bouncing around and me bouncing around with her, drinking lots of wine, bowling, going to the movies with the boys, very late nights talking, having little Ben- who joined us with his family on Friday-climb into my lap, Jeremy making hot cocoa at one in the morning,  just having a good time.  Now it's been back to reality for a couple of days.  Ah well.  Gotta go work...

      ...another weekend another storm...  So tonight we are supposedly in for at least 6 inches of snow, and possibly ice before that.  THEN, as if that weren't enough, it is going to snow another 6 inches on Sunday.  Well...bring it on!  I got some grocery shopping done yesterday, I have new art supplies to play with, and new goals to work towards, my husband is here, our cats are here, we have books, movies, and plenty of entertainment.  Come on storm!  **just don't knock the power out** please!

      ...mount up...  The other day I was headed out to my car to warm it up so I could chip off the thick layer of ice coating it.  It was maybe 10 in the morning, but very quiet outside.  As I reached the sidewalk, I had this sinking feeling, and felt as if suddenly huge men coated in furs, and riding Shire horses were going to turn on to our street off of Oak, and start riding towards me.   I could almost hear the ram's horn being blown for battle call.  I quickened my pace to get to the car in time.  Once I unlocked the door, I realized I was totally irrational.  It just had that feeling outside...like everyone was gone, and I didn't know it yet, and there are roaming bands of Vikings or something. Maybe I shouldn't read and watch movies so much...

      ...blue norther a comin'...  Yesterday there was mass fear of a terrible ice storm, possibly to rival the bad one a couple of years ago that had power out all throughout the metro for a week.  This morning when I woke up, there was ice covering everything, but not any more than some previous freezing rain we have already had this season.  Regardless, I haven't set one toe outside today...chilly, and no place I have to go.  We received organic seeds in the mail yesterday for our upcoming gardening adventure.  Since it will be our first year, we are trying not to be overly ambitious - scarlet nantes carrots, de cicco broccoli, sugar snap snow peas, lettuce/mustard green mix, spinach, brandywine slicing tomatos, yellow pear cherry tomatos, scallions, and  tomatillos.  Plus I think we will be doing a herb selection: dill, oregano, basil, mint, chives, cilantro...maybe more.  There is a lot of work ahead of us, but I think it will be a beneficial endeavor.  I am getting very excited for the weddings that are coming up!  Meleah and Peter were in town a week ago to work on some of their wedding plans, and we, along with Jenny, Pat, Julie, and Carrie had a racous evening of eating and drinking.  I think their wedding is going to be fabulous.  Christine and Evan's wedding planning is in full swing, as is Cynthia and Ross's.  It is really interesting to see how different everyone's approach is to getting married.

      ...farewell...  Yesterday the dental hygenist who was getting ready to work on my teeth said that I had to take out my tongue ring.  I have had it over seven years, and had never taken it out, even for the dentist.  I went along with her, and she insisted that I would still be able to get it back in.   She took the full set of x-rays...didn't get it back...the doctor did his exam...didn't get it back...she spent an hour cleaning and flossing my teeth all the while lecturing me on how I should really floss, and had I heard that tongue rings can cause severe damage to one's teeth...got it back after all of that.  She shooed me into the bathroom to put it back in.  I could only get it partway in...the top hole had already healed.  Sigh.   I had been considering taking it out, but I wanted it to be my decision.  Ah well.  If I had cared more I suppose I would have put up a fuss, and not taken it out in the first place.  So...no more tongue ring.  I keep feeling for it, and am surprised when it is not there.  My tongue misses it...though now it can curl into a taco shape again.  The hygenist also said after she had finished throughly scraping the plaque from my teeth, "How much coffee do you drink?"   Oh great I thought...you want to take my coffee away too?! "Not more than a cup a day, if even that" I replied.   "Are there a lot of grounds in your coffee?" "No (puzzled)" "Well I found some black powdery looking stuff just underneath your gumline.  Do you know what it could be?" Just then the lightbulb clicked on.  It was the monkey brand tooth powder that my mom...uh, I mean Santa...left in Jeremy's stocking.  It's an Ayurvedic tooth powder from India, and it is indeed very black, and I had used it just before I went there...must not have rinsed well.  I told her about it, and her face kind of twisted into semi-disgust, then she asked in a very condescending manner, "Does it have flouride in it?" "No." "You really shouldn't probably use it then.  Is there any reason you are?" "It's refreshing!" "Hmmm."   I like my dentist a lot.  I'm just not so sure about that hygenist.

      ...scritch scratch blues...  Jeremy has a bit of a cold, and I believe it may be starting to pass to me.  So far though, I think my latest trend of exercising regularly, and eating a bit healthier than usual may be keeping it at bay.  I have a lot more energy from the workouts...yay!    Today is gray and rainy.  I should really get a job, otherwise I am going to spend my life sleeping late, and padding around the house.  It's just so hard to motivate when the sun doesn't shine.  Blah, blah, blah...:)

      ...top of the new year...  I was perusing today's newspaper at our neighborhood coffee shop this morning, when my eyes ran over an article about the possible colon cancer fighting properties of drinking coffee.  Yay!  I knew there had to be something redeeming health-wise with coffee, otherwise why would it taste so damn good!  Before I found myself in the coffee shop, I had been outside walking back from the gas station where I dropped my car.  There is a real light snow lazily making it's way down to earth, and melded pellets of ice coat the sidewalks and trees.  The branches look so beautiful trapped inside those icy shells.  They crack like old bones though, if you run into them.  The holidays were good to us.  We felt fortunate to be able to spend so much time with some family and friends.  Lots of folks in town for awhile.  Lots of good food, though my jeans seem to be more loose than ever...hmmm...unusual.

      ...glamour nights...  Tonight is the Oscars...I don't know why I love them so much, but I always have.  One year in college I even dragged my small, portable t.v. into the weaving studio so I, and the rest of the ladies, could watch them while working at our looms.   We were going to watch them with Piper and Nick, but when I got home from work Jeremy was ill...sad face for Jeremy.  Nothing drastic, but feeling bad nonetheless.  Friday night while he was working at Muddy's, Jeremy spied Shandi, the local K.C. girl who is currently on America's Next Top Model!  We've been rooting for her, not only 'cause she's from our town, but because she rules!  I missed chatting with her as I was at my Mom's.  Ah well...not a big deal at all.  All of our tickets and lodging are in place for our upcoming trip to New York/London/Swanage!  It will be nice to get away, though I always worry about leaving the kitties.  I think they get sad, and I miss them a lot.  It will be nice to have a few days back in NYC...lots of good folks and memories there.  We are also excited to hang out with Joan and Rachel in their British digs.    I think the weather has taken a turn towards spring!!!  It's been warm for many days, and today it was very windy and rained, but it wasn't too chilly.  C'mon spring!  No more snow!    Lately I've been getting back in touch (or they have been with me) with old friends.  It's nice that you can get back in sync after misplacing them for a couple of years.  I've never enjoyed losing friends...unless they are absolutely wretched, but I don't think I've really had any that I would describe like that.  One last thing...if you ever have the opportunity to do an Ethiopian coffee ceremony, do it!  We were involved in one a couple of weeks ago, and had a grand old time.

      ...emerging...  Work is good!  Busy bee, busy bee.  I am enjoying my job immensely - the familiar faces who come in, the variety of materials, questions, and having things to do!  Yay this job!  I hope my feelings for it continue in this vein.  It has been a good past week...both Jeremy and I have reconnected with seemingly lost friends, I've started a new book - "The Shifting Realities of Philip K. Dick: Selected Literary and Philosophical Writings" and have a couple waiting behind the curtain - "The Red Tent" and "Gravity's Rainbow."  The food I've been eating has felt very healthy, and I have been exercising regularly.  We once again have fixings for White Russians in the house.  We had multiple days in a row of 60 or so degree weather...the snow is all gone, and the birds are out in record numbers.  Yesterday at the bank, a gaggle of Canadian geese were taking their sweet time walking along the drive that leads to the teller windows.  I watched a woman just wait helplessly in her car until they meandered past.  They were actually headed for a specific sidewalk, and walked along it, not going into the grass!  Here is a shout out to Morgan...my future neice...Happy Birthday!  You look great for your age!

      ...jobby job...  Tomorrow I start my job at Utrecht.  That's right...I got the job.  It will be nice to have money and somewhere to go.  I really need schedules created by someone else to motivate me to use the rest of my time in the most efficient manner.    So Valentine's Day came and went.  Jeremy and I never do tons for it, but we did some chocolate and flowers, and cooked a nice dinner.  It was fun for all.  Nothing much else...for now.

      ...catch up...ketchup...  Jeremy took me on a date last night to see the final Lord of the Rings movie.  It ruled...all 200 minutes of it!  There is a massive icecicle to the left of our front door.  The whole neighborhood stands in awe of it.  People are making pilgrimages to it just to get a chance for a glimpse.  Well...maybe not pilgrimages...it's an impressive icecicle, okay.  I have a interview with Utrecht art supplies store today.  I have been told that I am the number one candidate, so I may very well have a part-time job soon.  Discount art supplies, whee!  I also dropped off a packet of work last week to a store that carries local artists work.  They don't provide a definite time-line of when they get back to you, so I have no idea.  Keep your fingers crossed they like my stuff.  Yesterdays mail was excellent...Meleah and Peter's wedding invitation arrived.  It was beautiful.  Plus I won a contest and received a $20 gift-certificate to the Majestic Steak House...fortunately they have vegetarian options.  This is the month that Einstein Brothers Bagels has chocolate cherry flavored coffee.  Mmmm...I love it...drool...  Christine and I are continuing our work-out plan, though after our last session I got an incredible urge for a Slurpee...so I got one...but it was the smallest one...and so worth it...mmmm  This weekend I have to start our little brocolli plants inside.  They will hopefully be transplanted into our yet-to-be-dug garden before we leave for England.    I am currently bookless, though I think I am going to start the first Disc World book, and the Lord of the Rings series, and maybe something not so fantastical.  We'll see.

      ...the best news of all...  The passport arrived yesterday.  In perspective, it was most definitely not the worst thing in the world what happened...there is plenty that is MUCH more frustrating and horrifying.  We have it pretty good.    Anyway...yay, yay, yay!   Here we come NYC, London, and Swanage!

      ...the passport saga...  So, last Tuesday I flew to Chicago for the day to apply for a rush passport seeing as how someone (I'm thinking the passport agency) lost my previous application.  I had the fun task of stopping a check, reporting a passport lost, and still worrying about all the documents that have all that information "they" warn you to guard just floating about somewhere. I flew into Midway, and hopped on the orange line of the L.  I was excited, because I had yet to ride the L in Chicago!  I got to take in the snow that was falling from a very warm, seated position.  I got out at the LaSalle Station, and walked around looking for food, and getting my bearings.  I ended up in a little Middle Eastern cafe, and snacked on some lentil soup and a spinach feta pie while reading my book.  Afterwards, I still had plenty of time until my meeting, but I decided to make my way to the Federal Building anyway, just to locate it.  It was a very short walk...Chicago is pretty easy to get around!  I wandered the blocks surrounding the building looking for someplace warm to hang out.  I ducked into a bookstore for a bit, then found a seemingly fancy Italian cafeteria/espresso bar inside the Bank of America building.  Everyone was a suit...I was not, but didn't care.  I enjoyed a cafe mocha and took in more of my book (which is "Reading Lolita in Tehran" by the way...Meade was reading it over Thanksgiving, and I finally picked it up.) After my coffee, I decided it was close enough to the meeting time, so I headed up to the 18th floor of the Federal Building, got my number, and waited to be called up to a window.  I was surprised with how many people there are who need their passports within 14 days.  I made it to a window, shoved all my papers at them, grudgingly wrote a check, and was assured that it would be mailed to me and would probably arrive on Saturday.   Then I gave Meleah a call to just say hi, since I was in her city.  She was on her way to work, but we had a nice chat, filled with much laughter!  After that, I figured I might as well head back to the airport.  I got back on the orange line, and it took me around the whole loop, which was very cool.  I scuttled up to the ticket counter once I made it to Midway, and discovered that I could probably make the 3:00 flight if I hurried, instead of waiting for my 5:00 one.  I took as many moving walkways as I could.  I considered for a minute just waiting for my original flight so I could check out the Ben and Jerry's ice cream parlor, but then I decided I would much rather get back home sooner than later.  So...made the flight, Jer picked me up, we had an early dinner at the Jayhawk, and made it home in plenty of time to catch America's Next Top Model!  As of yesterday, I have still not received my passport!!!  I gave them a ring, and they said that they mailed it that day...by regular mail...not priority...not express...so...I wait, and hopefully it will make it in time for the trip.  If not, we go to New York and hope it arrives with enough time that Johnny can overnight it to us...if not that...then obviously the Gods must not want us to go.  So...I am pretty sure that it will arrive in plenty of time, and we will have a great trip!  Be positive, be positive. If you need a passport, I suggest sending the request many, many months in advance, because they need plenty of time to pull their heads sloooowly out of their asses.

      ...in the year 2000...  Woah...I haven't written yet in March?  Time is slipping through my fingers, though I don't think I ever had a grasp on it.   Today, after dropping off my car to be worked on (yes, again...there is some sort of high-pitched squeak escaping it) I walked down to McClain's bakery, which has been there since my Mom was a kid.  I needed to go there actually for my Ma...next Friday is her birthday, and Piper, Nick, Daddad, my Mom, Jer, and I are all going to Governor Stumpy's for dinner, then back to our house for cake and presents.  Anyway...I placed an order for her cake and eye-balled all of the other sweets they had for sale...icebox cookies (cherry and regular), fruit bars, cream puffs, macaroons, cupcakes, little pies, m&m cookies, etc.  This started my envisioning what life could be like when we have kids...walking to McClain's for cookies!   So, I exited sans sweets and debated whether I should stop on my way back to the house for coffee from the wonderful Bar Roma (best espresso and coffee outside of Europe ever!!! - the other day I got an iced mocha to die for with their own espresso/vanilla whipped cream on top...sigh) or for a coke from QT.  I opted for coke...couldn't resist that sweet burn, though now I am slightly wishing for coffee.  I took the back way home from QT and transported myself to when our future kids are teens, walking around the neighborhood with sullen looks on their faces.   "Mom...I'm going to QT for a coke (actually probably for a coke and cigarettes...grrr)" The back way home is full of chain-link fences, no sidewalks or ones that abruptly end in gravel, utility boxes, rampaging weeds, and weird little businesses.  At least there is no drainage ditch like what was by my house growing up.  I hung out there a lot (unless it was raining...I'm no fool!)  In other news...I'm starting to worry about my passport.  I sent in an application to get a new one in my married name at the start of January, and I've sent them emails twice to check on the status of it...they don't have it in their system...uh...we leave in two weeks!  Please passport gods...let them find it and process it swiftly!!!  I'm going to call them tomorrow and see if they have it yet in their computers, and if not, ask them what I can do.

      ...snippets of life...  Preparing for inventory at work...inventory is tomorrow.  Lazily working on an embroidered present for my pals Meleah and Peter who are getting married a week from today.  Ate some amazing pesto ravioli in a gorgonzola cream sauce the other day.  Replanting an aloe plant that uprooted itself trying to escape us...it didn't get past the front stoop.  Tomato plants sprouting...basil too.  Making preparations for a party.  Writing a note to my future niece...now I just have to mail it.  Launching pills down Frank's throat so his gum infection will clear up.  The color is slowly returning to my arms.  My car started doing this weird vibrate-y thing when I'm stopped...Jer put premium gas and cleaner in the tank today...massage car.  Trying to keep allergies and colds at bay. love.

      ...chronicle...  part one...i want to wake up in the city that never sleeps...  We arrived at Billie's apartment in the East Village around 9:00pm on Friday the 26th.  The days travels went fairly well, though we had to get put on a different airline due to the fact that we were not notified that our original flight time had changed.  I was about ready to freak, but it all worked out fine.   So...it was great being back in the city!  That first night, after talking with Billie for a bit, Jer and I walked to Odessa...a great 24-hour Ukranian food joint/bar.  We were super hungry...I got the matzoh ball soup and Jer the hot borscht, and we shared sweet potato pierogis and a potato pancake...mmm... The next three days consisted of hanging out with Corrie Beth in Thompkin's Square Park, enjoying the company of the DiCarlos, brunch with lots of family including some cousins!, walking all throughout Central Park until finally arriving at the ice-skating rink to chat with Kuban for a bit, going up into the triple digits for a lovely night of snacking and drinking with Christine and Ron, chats and dinner with Billie, visiting with Bea, clothes shopping, and eating!!!   Tuesday we took a very l-o-n-g subway ride out to JFK and after much line standing, found ourselves on a flight to London...  part two...london calling...  We had never flown Virgin Atlantic before.  Man...I couldn't sleep at all...too many movies and video games to choose from.  It was a good flight, though I regretted not sleeping a little later.  When we deplaned, Jer and I headed for the tube, and then got mixed up in finding our B&B.  Luckily, we finally found someone who busted out a comprehensive map, and directed us to where we needed to go.  I was thankful for finally being able to set down heavy bags. We couldn't check in right away, so we left our bags and decided to grab a bite at a Vietnamese restaurant not too far down the street.  Mmm...I got a bowl of tofu/vegetable Pho (I think it was Pho...maybe Bun) that came with a plate of thai basil, sliced up hot chiles, lime wedges and cilantro to add to my taste.  That, in combination with some jasmine tea, made the shower and sleep that followed all the more sweet.   After a glorious rest, we spent the rest of the night in the room, enjoying British tv, and discovering the tasty sandwiches that one can purchase at Boots. London was a blur of walking to Westminster Abbey, foot pain, expensive yet tasty food, bashing around Brixton, and the start of my love affair with Boots - the best drugstore chain in the universe. Saturday, Joan and Rachel picked us up and we all enjoyed a great day walking the length of the Portabello Road market.  Jer and Rachel had never been there before, and I was happy to have another go at it!  After much walking, we wound our way back to the car, and began our journey to Swanage.  part three...there's corfe castle, i love corfe castle...  The English countryside is beautiful, and I fully enjoyed it from my shotgun seat in Joan's car.  As we found ourselves getting closer to Swanage, I found myself loving all that my eyes were taking in more and more.  We found out as we passed by Corfe Castle (ruins of a medieval - sp?- castle...very cool) that last summer, every time they would drive by there, Morgan would declare, "There's Corfe Castle!  I lo-ve Corfe Castle!"  It drove Rachel nuts, so we decided to keep up with the tradition. The night we arrived, we got acquainted with Joan's house, and took a little walking tour of Swanage on our way to eat fish and chips...yes, I ate fish and chips...and it was good!  They are about a five-minute walk from the beach, and can pretty much get anything they need by foot.  The town is all stone, moss, moisture, salt air, and church bells.  I love it! Sunday, we headed to Monkey World (my new home), though Rachel did not join us, for she has been to Monkey World plenty, and had important business to attend to at the arcade...such as the dancing game.  Anyway...Monkey World is a near-by place that takes in all kinds of monkeys who have been rescued from lives that monkeys should not have to lead...such as being photo props, being people's illegal pets, or living in laboratories.  They are given fun indoor/outdoor living spaces, and we are allowed to try to catch glimpses of them playing with their friends, or eating their friends bugs off of their backs.  We saw quite a few, and had a nice time.  As we headed back to the car, the requisite five-minutes of rain for the day came down.  Upon our return, Joan whipped up a super-tasty meal of vegetarian bangers, mashed potatoes, and cabbage, washed down with wine...so good.  Jeremy and I were having a great time hanging out with Joan, but Rachel called and insisted we come to the arcade to meet her mates.  We were game...ha ha. The arcade is a strange mixture of adult gambling machines and various kinds of interactive video games...kid gambling machines!  We met some of Rachel's friends, were ignored, played a basketball game, played the only pinball machine in the place, played air hockey, watched as they all shoved pounds into the dance game (though they are all really quite good at it...I, on the other hand, am not!), were giggled at for snogging, were hugged by Rachel, and were ignored more.  After awhile, we decided to head back. Jeremy started to come down with something, which he is still fighting a bit, so he did not join Joan, Missy (the puppy), and I on our big hike the next day.  It was beautiful!!!  I thoroughly enjoyed the sights, and the company.  Joan made dinner when we returned, and came down with a bug herself soon after.  People were dropping like flies!  She was fairly knocked out for the rest of our stay, though not entirely. Jeremy and I ventured on our own to Corfe Castle.  You can get a steam train from Swanage to Corfe Castle village...about 20 minutes.  We found a nice little tea room to grab a bite of lunch.  While we waited for our order, a poor waiter dropped a tray of glasses, and a bunch of glass flew right onto us, and some other surrounding eaters!  Yikes.  We switched tables after picking the bits of glass from our coats, and were delivered some extremely tasty food.  Jeremy just got some cheese scones with chive butter, and I ordered the vegetable soup with crusty bread...I think that was possibly one of my favorite meals of the whole trip!   Corfe Castle was great fun.  It has amazing views from the top, and I just love hiking around ruins of things.  We walked around the village some before getting the train back to Swanage.  Joan still wasn't doing too hot, so Jer and I headed to a pub for some pints, and some food. Wednesday, our last full day in town, we went to Dorchester, but unfortunately missed the market they have there.  But, we did see some interesting Thomas Hardy related sights, and had fun spending more time with Joan.  That night, all four of us went to an awesome pub in a semi-nearby town.  Very cool. So...Thursday we were driven to Poole, boarded a bus for the airport, got checked through quickly, got on the plane, had food constantly shoved at us, watched two movies, got off in Newark, hopped on the hotel shuttle and enjoyed lolling in our hotel room.  Poor Jer was not feeling well at all.  Fortunately there was a Chinese take-out menu left in our room, so we ordered soup and a spicy tofu dish, which seemed to perk Jer up.   Friday we began the journey back to Kansas City.  The cats were very happy when we came through the front door.  ...a few of my favorite things...  Wellies! - I was wearing Joan's, now I have my own...the view from Joan's guest room window - a full moon illuminating the swift clouds and rooftops - the colors were incredible...English candy bars - we brought many back...crisps - all those flavors...laughing with Rachel...Missy in the kitchen...that wonderful brown bread...walking around with Joan...pints of cider...British news...pulling the chain to flush the toilet...Boots ploughman sandwich!...spending time with friends and family in both New York and Swanage.  ...one last thing...  Since being back, we have been discovering all the secrets of our yard.  We were not here this time last year, so we did not know about the tiny purple and white flowers that are scattered throughout our front yard, how the surprise lillies that came up in the fall have very different looking plants in the spring, or that we have daffodils!

      ...is that all there is?...  My body is full on friends and food.  Tonight I am going to sink into the futon with my embroidery.   Friday we headed out to Excelsior Springs for a party at the Freelings.  They were having a campout, though we couldn't spend the night due to work the next morning.  Here are the things I remember...Mandylan called me on my cell phone, so I talked with her on the crazy, steep, twisty front stairs while cats poked out of the bushes and I stared at the triangular mailbox...devouring a slice of apple pie with homemade vanilla ice cream, followed by a slice of strawberry rhubarb pie...laying by the campfire looking for satellites among the stars...lots of kids running around...drinking wine from the bottle with Jer. Saturday was work is for jerks, but...da da da dum...then came a most fabulous dinner with Christine and Evan over to share in it.  French toast,made with Jer's yummy batter, topped with fresh blueberries, strawberries, apple, banana, and kiwi, plus toasted pecans, honey butter, and powdered sugar.  Drool.  There was also chiken and apple sausage,scrambled eggs donated by Christine's Dad's chickens, and mimosas...then coffee after awhile.  Sigh. Sunday we headed to Lawrence for a BBQ Jenny O. was throwin'.  So much food, and beverage, and...well...it was a Jenny O. party.  It was a fabulous cap to a very filled weekend.  One disappointment though...Amigo's is no longer in Lawrence!  Where is one to get a crisp pinto burrito on their way out of town?!  Highly problematic in the taste bud arena.

      ...my fellow friends...  Today is the start of my weekend of emptiness...ahhh.   Not that last weekend was bad by any means, just full.  Thursday night I went straight from work to Lidia's Italian Restaurant where Cynthia and Ross's rehersal dinner was taking place.  We snared an invite due to the fact that a couple of days before, Cynthia had called to ask Jer if he could accompany the singer with guitar during the ceremony...she was having a hard time singing acapella.  So, we had a great time...lots of friends, and family (not our own, granted, but it felt close,)and food.  Afterwards, Cynthia, Corrie B, and I spent some time at Broadway Cafe winding down.  Corrie came home with me, as she stayed with us until Sunday! Yay!  Friday was the big day!  I started off the day with two hours at work...woo hoo.  An hour or so later, I was picking up Heather from the airport!  She flew in for the wedding.  We got to Drexel Hall a half hour or so before things started, so Jer could get tuned...I snuck up to visit with all the ladies upstairs.  Cynthia looked fantastic in the dress she had picked out, and Grace, the flower girl, is possibly the devil disguised in the body of a red-headed three-year-old...she's not evil, just mischevious and hilarious!  The ceremony went well...it was elegant, yet relaxed and had laughter.  Dwight Frizzel was the minister, and BCR played at the reception, so it was guaranteed to be interesting!  The reception was fun.  We mainly stuck to our table, because the company was so enjoyable, and the food was...yummy!  Goat cheese and leek tarts, purple potatoes with various toppings, baby vegetables and hummus, roasted garlic, roasted red and yellow peppers, bread, sundried tomato stuff, etc., etc. and the cake...a table of cupcakes and cookies, plus the seven-layer citrus cake...drool...so sweet.  Here's to their happiness!  Saturday was a full day of work, which was followed by an awesome performance of Corrie B and her guitar (and Jer played mandolin and banjo on a few songs!)at the Westport Coffee House.  Her voice...I love it.  She was followed by our pal Laszlo's band The Get Wild Five...yow!  Then they were followed by Ad Astra Per Aspera...always a good time.  I was very tired by the end, so we headed home, but Corrie and Jer hit the after-party at Anthony's.  I mainly did not due to what my plans were for Sunday...  Piper's graduation from Grad School!!!  Yay Piper!  Mom and I went to the ceremony at 10am (ugh)  It was nice, and not too long!  I really enjoyed the guy they gave the honorary degree to.  His speech was great.  At the end of the ceremony they released white doves.  Guess it's better than a bunch of balloons! We swung back by the house to grab Jer and Corrie and food we were taking, then made our way north to Piper and Nick's for a little party.  Good times.  On our way out, we had to say goodbye to Corrie at the airport.  Sigh.  So...that was last weekend...this one looks to be a little more...m-e-l-l-o-w...no work today, Saturday, or Sunday...what's a girl to do?  A shout out to Josh, Julie, and Morgan...congrats on your new living space!!!  Yay for you guys!  I look forward to sending mail to the new address.  We are excited for everything that is happening in your lives.  We love you guys!  Hoping your weekend is m-e-l-l-o-w too.

      ...yeah, fire! fire!...  Metallica rocked hard last night!  They played Master of Puppets, For Whom the Bell Tolls, One, Search Seek and Destroy, Enter Sandman, Nothing Else Matters, and some newer songs, and other songs I can't recall now.  During many songs there were huge bursts of flames, and firework type things.  We could feel the heat from where we were standing!  I liked watching my Mom throw her hands in the air, and attempt to make the metal horns hand sign (an unknowing tribute to Pan?)  I got a little shiver, though, watching everyone throwing fists in the air and shouting in unison.  It was a little Nazi-esque to me...I couldn't bring myself to do it, at least in rythm with everyone else.  Creepy.  As was the guy who was a racist skin head (nice big swastica tattoo on one arm, and a cross on the other + wearing red suspenders and a bald head.)  He was on the floor, and in the pit the whole show.  He did the ugly mosh pit strut.  Bleh.  Otherwise...plants are transplanted and flourishing, thunder has been rolling across our land for a couple of days - broken up with lots of sunshine, I'm helping out my friend Joscelyn in her studio a bit, Corrie B is coming into town and so is Heather!, the kitties look a little slimmer, Piper is graduating from grad school on Sunday, and...life is good!

Plus she is cool as hell...she's taking Piper and I to Metallica tomorrow!  I think she is more excited than I am!  Thanks Mom for all you do.  Also...here's to the other Mom in my life, my Mother-in-law, Joan.  Thank you for your contribution in raising Jeremy, and for the love and support you give us both.  Yay Moms!

      ...sizzlin...  Our upstairs is hot!  That is where the computer is...my brain is working s-l-o-w-e-r in the heat...must have water soon.  Meleah and Peter's wedding was a hit!  We danced like crazy and I drank much more than I normally do...tried a Colorado Bulldog...yummy...it's: equal parts Bailey's, vodka, and Kahluha, then you put a little milk/half&half (whatever you prefer) and top it off with a splash of coke...try it...now!  Anyway...I wasn't exactly hung over the next morning, but upon rising, I decided I needed to sit upstairs a bit, drink some water, and eat some crackers before I could get on with my day.   Congratulations Peter and Meleah!  I love you guys.  So, that day after the wedding, we had a little May Day/Cinco de Mayo throw down.  Overall it went well.  Make your own tacos, sangria, and cookies is what we provided, and others brought shrimp, chicken enchiladas, tamales, and I don't know what else!  I did not drink anything stronger than Mexican coke (it's sweetened different!)  Late into the night, things got a little rowdy, but we won't go into that.  I got the pleasure of working the next day, but it wasn't bad...Monday I got a weird 24-hour bug, that made me sleep a lot, and when I was awake, burp and fart much.  It could have been much worse I suppose.  I thought after this past weekend that things were slowing down for awhile...hahaha...how foolish. It's good though.  Next week is Metallica with my Mom and sister!

      ...raindrops keep falling on my head...  We had a mini-vacation of camping this past weekend, for Evan and Christine's bachelor/bachelorette party.  It was at the same group site by Clinton lake that Jer and I had our b/b party at two years ago! Here is a perfect example of how nice Jer is...Friday he arrived at the campground around 4:00 to pick up the key to the gate.  I could not leave until 8:00 due to working, so I didn't even arrive until close to 9:30.  Jeremy knew approximately when I would get there, so he had food on the grill for me that was ready about 10 minutes after my arrival!  Plus the tent was all set up (though we ended up experimenting with sleeping in the truck that first night...quite cozy.)  What a sweetheart.  It was a good trip, though we got rained on heavily Sunday morning...kind of a bummer way to end a nice weekend, but it worked out.  The rest of the time was gorgeous and there was swimming, night sailing, crazy kids running around, fires, smores, drunken 14-year-old antics, who-can-hold-their-hand-in-ice-longer competition (I was part of that...I can get a little competitive), much eating of food (there was even pork satay with peanut sauce + roasted jalapenos courtesy of Noy and Aaron!), funny campfire conversations, ticks, and much, much more.   Otherwise...Jer and I are up to the usual.   The anniversary celebration was a sucess!  We stuffed ourselves at La Bodega on tapas (I even tried anchovies!), beverages (port for Jer, wine for me), dessert (the best flan ever!!! + pear tart), and coffee (regular 'ol coffee for the Mr. and flaming Spanish coffee for myself...invision a sugar rimmed glass filled with Bacardi 151, set on fire, then having cinnamon sprinkled into the flames...they are extinguished by coffee, kahluha, and whipped cream...then it is devoured by a roly-poly Stacy.)  Mmm...

      ...brown is the colour of my true love's hair...  Two years ago today it was HOT, but I didn't care, because Jeremy and I were trading rings, and we were surrounded by friends and family.  Part of me can't believe it has already been two years, while the other part feels, "It's only been two years?!"  A lot can go on in that time...  I cannot imagine a better partner than Jer.   You are my best friend, my lover, and I would not trade you for anything!  I love you, Jer.

      ...what...  Since I was last here... Rick, Jer's Dad, came for a visit.  We had a very pleasant time with him - talking, watching movies, cooking, eating, talking some more.  Though the trip proved not to be the best thing for his health, we still enjoyed that he made it to visit us, saw the house, and met my Mom and some of our friends.  We truly had a good time hosting him.  The rains have been drowning us, but the plants seem to appreciate it.  A guy Jer works with is convinced it is the weather planes run by corporate America doing it...I don't know...I think it's just a rainy season.    My car rolled over 100,000 miles yesterday!  It's been all over the U.S. ...to some places multiple times, and yet it is still running (though still chuggy chuggy at stops, and having a slow go of speeding up from stops, but still running!)  I am excited to receive my new car,but how can I say goodbye to my transportation for the last nine years?!  Wow...I'm really attached to an inanimate object.    I've been embroidering floral patterns made out of human bone shapes on to tissue paper.  Delicate work.  A belated, public Happy Birthday announcement to my sister Piper, and to my almost sister-in-law Julie.  Julie is one day older than Piper!  How bizzare.  Both are off traveling, and having a good time of it I'm sure.  Also...a belated birthday greeting to Rick!

      ...long distance birthing celebration...  HAPPY BIRTHDAY to my sister-in-law Rachel!!!&nbsp; She turns the big 1-5 today.&nbsp; Rachel...I don't even know if you read this, but Joan can tell you...we will be sending a present to the house in Detroit, and we are attempting to call or email today.&nbsp; Just know that Jeremy and I are thinking of you, and hoping you have a super-fun birthday!&nbsp; We love you lots.  ...in other news...  How fitting that today, exactly one year from my father passing away, that I would get a call from the Toyota dealership saying I could pick up my Prius this Saturday.&nbsp; It is fitting due to the fact that I am able to get it through money inherited from my Grandparents through my Dad, plus my Grandfather and my Dad both had a love of cars, and fine machinery.&nbsp; So...in honor of them, I will be dubbing my new car...Dr. Wilson (Grandpa was an actual Dr. and my Dad was a PhD.)&nbsp; Look for me cruisin' the streets of K.C. (in an environmentally responsible way) starting Saturday!&nbsp; The Dr. is in, be-atch!

      ...been a long time since I rock and rolled... &nbsp; These are busy times my friends.&nbsp;  Christine and Evan's wedding came and went.&nbsp; We had a really great weekend of hanging out with them, and their families and friends.&nbsp; Being a bridesmaid was no sweat, and Jer and Mary played beautiful music during the ceremony.&nbsp; Now Christine and Evan are away camping for the honeymoon, and I miss them!&nbsp; We usually see them at least once a week...ah well...they deserve a nice vacation.&nbsp; Congratulations you two! &nbsp; I hung up some art I've been working on the last couple of months at Utrecht yesterday.&nbsp; It gets to be up for a month!&nbsp; I know it's not a crazy gallery show or anything, but I'm still excited about people being able to see it.&nbsp; I have not shown anything since I was in college... &nbsp; All of our precious yellow-pear cherry tomatoes have been eaten by some mysterious beastie.&nbsp; That's our fault for not putting up fencing I suppose, but our pal Matt says it can happen even with some sort of barrier.&nbsp; At least they have left the herbs, tomatillos, and gypsy peppers alone! &nbsp; &nbsp;

      ...rock the...  VOTE!!! It could very well get nasty here in Missouri today...hopefully we will NOT vote in Ammendment 2 (which will write into the constitution of Missouri that marriage is between a man and a woman so those "activist" judges can't say otherwise.)  There is also a vote to build a downtown arena in K.C. (and taxes would not be raised to do it.)  I guess that's okay...I wish they would put in a giant ferris wheel like London instead.  Now that would be cool!!!

      ...a whole lot of buzzing goin' on...  Saturday afternoon I entered my studio in search of an old sketchbook when a buzz near the window distracted me.  I looked over, expecting to see a large housefly trapped on the wrong side, but instead there was a wasp hovering above the window frame right by a NEST!  As one can imagine, I quickly exited the room and shoved towels around the edges.  Tonight, Evan and Christine came over to pick up their tents that were drying in our backyard, and Evan sprayed the hell out of that nest with noxious chemicals.  Tomorrow we are going in and removing the window air conditioning unit, and later will take down the devestated nest.  Ugh.  On top of that, I feel itchy all over due to bug bites and keep searching the ceiling of every room for signs of unwanted insect life.  Otherwise...I brushed a kittens worth of fur out of Frank's coat the other day, Christine made her delicious tortilla soup last night and I got to come over and enjoy it! (Jer had to work...she sent some home for him), heirloom tomatoes are highly tasty - in particular Cherokee purples, I ate a little strawberry from our yard today, the Prius is fun to drive in - especially when it is silent, rosemary infused strawberry lemonade is...fantastic!
