      Sigh... leaving for Europe ma√±ana... I*m gonna miss my buddies... Especially Tony!!! Man, Tony is one of those buddies who is there for me regardless of how estupid I act or what I*m going through. He*s one of the real friends. I got so pissed at my other "friend" earlier, Miriam. I really love Miriam and Nana a lot, but I hate how I always have to be the wrong one and how they always have to be correct when they*re not sometimes. Then I always get the blame for everything. They*re always taking eachothers side and no one ever takes my side exept for Tony. Man... Well, I*ll get to see him when I come back, I know... but I*ll miss him so much. We burly get to see eachother now, and now we won*t get to see eachother more. Sigh... well at least I got to see him yesterday. I had a lotta fun yesterday. Went to the La Macabrona band practice and I*m in. I*m playing the trumpet... so I*m gonna learn, and I*ma learn how to be the best trompeta player I can be. So then I went with the Drunk Skunks and woo! Drunk Skunks got to be on TV! Woo hoo! They did really good too... better than IV man. IV sucks! Estupid OC ska... HaHaHa =P But yeah... At least I got to see Tony yesterday and have lots of fun with him and the band(s). Sigh... :'(

I couldn*t take it anymore! I was so sleepy! Well hmm... I was supposed to go to a gig today but the band (Drunk Skunks) and I don*t have a ride... sigh... I haven*t gone to a gig in like 2 weeks. I*m so bored off my mind staying home! I need live music! I need to skank with the homies! I need to go all out in the pit!!! Ahhhhh!!! This is so boring... Wow... well right now I*m listening to some Tiger Army and I tried to learn "True Romance" on the guitar and it*s kinda hard... Asshhh... I like a challenge anyways but I*ll try to learn it later. Besides that, I drew this really bad (good) picture!   There*s the link! Go check it out!!! Man... I*m leaving for Europe this Friday. My friends and I are going to have a kick back in Thursday probly. Mehh... So what*s new? Nothing with me. I*m talking to Tony right now... The best trumpet player in the world!!!

      Guess who's back back again! Nica's back! Tell a friend!!! HaHaHa hello everyone it's me Nica. Haven't been here for ages. I guess I've been really LAZY and stuff. Ha! Well anyways I'm back from Europe. It was koo... but then kinda boring... but then koo. Jups. Garsh I dunno what to say! Ha! Um... let's see today I kicked it with Nana, Miriam, and Yesenia. Ha! Well, Nana and I are kinda mad at Miriam right now. Well, Nana's mad at Miriam cuz you can kinda say that Miriam is being a "5th Wheel" and well she has been. Then I'm kinda mad at Miriam cuz she's been lying about a lotta things and yeah... But oh well. LOL It was funny cuz Nana and I went to go pick up Yesenia from Berendo and she had detention so we were waiting and she passed through the front and we didn't see her! So we were like OMG! Well Nana and I just went to her house and we all kicked it. It was bad! ^_^ HaHa and we were all clowning around and cracking up at some good times we had in Middle School. Too bad Yesenia is in 8th grade but ha! We're still good friends. HaHa it was funny when some guy called Yesenia and Nana and I started clowing and I was like "Ooh it's Tony"... "Ooh it's Jesse" then Nana says "Ooh it's Miguel" and I'm like "Ooh it's Jesus Christ!" LOL and we were all ROFL and I'm like "Looks like Jesus Christ gave Blondie a booty call!" HaHa it was HILARIOUS! Then Nana was clowning on how Tony skanks and she was trying to do it and she does it FUNNY! Ha! Well anyways... I guess that's about it. Nothing more. Bored like crazy... Well I dunno. I'll come by when something fun actually comes up. Oh and not to mention I'm going to the Chencha Berrinches show this Thursday! Can't wait!!! ^_^
