      So I have to email him with little bullshit, just so that I have  some kind  of communication with him.  what's wrong with me?  Friggin' glutton for punishment!  Alex, my wonderful boy, is playing with Skyler - playdough - he's the best kid, I swear... He is a nurturer, like me. Holds his feelings inside, just like me too.    I've created a monster, I think!  Matt will be here to talk to Skyler tonight... Not looking forward to seeing him.  I know I'll cry.  I know I will want him to hold me... I know I will end up hurting more, just seeing him.  God why am I so weak when it comes to him?  Tomorrow at 2:00, I have to go see that house again.  Try to float the check, I guess... Hope it doesn't go badly... I need a fresh start... And how do I do that without Matt's help?  Fucking catch-22!  She wants employment references, I have none... She wants a deposit, and I don't even have that...  I don't know what to do...  I can't swallow my pride and ask him again... Can't do it.  I have to act like I don't need him, even though God knows I do... At least I know I want him... Don't know if I need him...  Anyways... I'm off to pick up some clothes.  I'm losing weight.. That's the one good thing about being empty inside with stress eating away at you... You lose your appetite and finally lose some weight!  Well... I always thought I'd rather be fat and happy, but who was I kidding...  I'd rather look good and fake the rest...  lol

      I woke up at 5:00 am, done sleeping for the night.  Now I'm wishing that I didn't give dad all my tylenol pm.  Shit!  Had the bright idea to take a ride to see where Matt spent the night.  Turning into a stalker, I guess...  Surprise, surprise, he wasn't at Bonnie's (hereafter to be called "The Whore"), or at Dave's... Or at the firehall.  He must have another slut on the line.  He doesn't waste any time, big surprise.  So we told Alex yesterday...  I did all the talking... Thanks for the help, Matt... So he leaves with an adoring kiss and hug for Skyler, and with a "see ya" for Alex.  Fucking bastard...to do that to Alex.  So I call him and tell him how fucked up that was, then he goes and makes it better.  He doesn't see the problem is that I HAVE TO TELL HIM THAT HE'S FUCKED UP, before he realizes it and makes it better.  He doesn't see that I shouldn't have to tell him to be decent...  fuck!   And of course Alex didn't say much, just looked like he had been slapped.  He just held it inside, like I always do...  I hate Matt for putting us through this.  I do... I know I did a lot of shit to contribute to our problems, but I was working on them, and really making progress.  He fucked us so hard... I tried to hold in my feelings about him fucking the whore, right under my nose... I tried to suck it up and show him that I was the better choice...  oh well... I'm probably better off without him.    He had the nerve to make a common about a three month separation not being enough...Like he had any intention of coming back.  What's one more slap in the face?  Should be used to it by now.  I hope he realizes, a few months down the road, just what he did.  What he lost... I guess that will be my revenge...

      So...I 've never claimed to be a poet.  I'm trying something new.  Afterall, It's A New Day, right?  So I've decided that I need to express my feeling more- stop hiding behind the smile...  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ...maybe now isn't quite the right time...lol  with so much shit going on!  Anyways...  I wrote this Saturday afternoon... after yet another blow up with Matt.&nbsp; This one is THE ONE though... no going back now.&nbsp; It's pretty lame, but it really summed up my feelings at the moment, hell... and my feelings still...   7/24/04    I love you, I’m here Don’t worry, have no fear  All I believed in is gone, when the truth is brought out  And yet you can’t understand why I still have my doubt  It’s done, it’s over, I’m here Family is what’s important, have no fear  But the calls keep coming, and each time you jump In my throat again, that old familiar lump  You’re my best friend, I’m here We’ll work on it, have no fear  And I hold my head up, and push back the pain And pretend like there’s anything left to gain  I love you, I’m here She’s just someone I hang with, have no fear  Out of your mouth – lies&nbsp;  Every time I hear them, my soul- little by little dies  I don’t want a new family, I’m here I’ll just be his friend, you’ve got nothing to fear  But that’s what Alex was told,  And look at you now.&nbsp; It looks so familiar, the way things unfold  I love you, I’m torn Give me three months and you’ll win  Well, I’m done, I’m tired I cannot compete You’ve already moved on Your life is complete  Goodbye, I’m leaving We’ll always be friends  Out of your mouth – lies And every time I hear them My soul – it just dies    It hurts to read it, but yet I do, again and again...  I'm a sucker, this I know!  I set myself up to fail, to hurt... but at least I'm feeling something!

      Well...  My laptop broke and so I've had no access to the internet.  Lots has happened.  Where to start??  I got a job!!!!  And I love it!!!  It feels so good to get up and do something other than take care of my family.  Don't' get me wrong, my family is the most important thing in the world to me, but I was going stir crazy and needed to get back to work.  Some people can stay home and be happy...  Me...I was slowly dying inside, and I knew it... For a long time.  The situation finally allowed me to get out and do it... And I really can't believe that I landed a REAL job.  Shit, I was a waitress all my life... To get a job like this is such an ego boost.  I should've insisted on it long ago, instead of just allowing myself to sink deeper into the hole that I helped dig.  Anyways... I'm working now, Skyler will be going to school soon, and Alex.  I'm thrilled!!!  I'll be able to save a little, buy a little bit for myself, the kids....  I'm happy, to say the least!  Matt and I are working on staying together.  I guess he broke it off with the whore.  We will see where the road leads.  I want to believe him whole heartedly, and I do... And I hate that I do.  I'm so afraid that he's playing the game... Straddling the fence, keeping his options open, but he says he is committed to making this work, and I believe him.     In the back of my mind tho...  Anyways... I can't keep my guard up tho, or it's senseless to even bother trying to keep this marriage together...  We will see.  If I get burned again, I guess it will teach me something...  LOL..  Another lesson.. Just what I need!  But I have learned that I am worth more than I believed... Learned that already... Pretty quickly... (only 25+ years, LOL)  Getting this job has helped me so much already.... Still cant believe it!  Mt focus now is on making our marriage work, while keeping my kids safe and happy, and making sure that I don't' crawl back into my hole...  So important!!!!  got to go to bed now... I want to cuddle with my best friend, lover, and husband.  I can't get enough of him now.. Never want to let him go...
