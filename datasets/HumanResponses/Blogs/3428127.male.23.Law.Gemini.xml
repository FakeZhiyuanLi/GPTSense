      sup sup yall!   hope all has been well. if you're one of the few regulars on my xanga, im sure you can tell there have been a few changes. Namely, none of my previous entries are viewable. I'm sure you all remember firsthand that since i started an online blog two years ago, I've gone into exhaustive detail about everything thats happened in my life.    Upon further review, I don't know if being so honest online was necessarily a good idea, as controversial subjects such as my journey in faith and your momz were discussed in great detail but were frankly too boring and introspective for the casual reader.* That and people got offended. As time passed by, I realised that unlike many people with online blog spots, my xanga was written primarily for me, and the few people who were crazy and brave enough to slog through the the deepest regions of my psyche. But its not for everyone and i acknowledge that half of the adult population today can't get through two paragraphs without drawing blanks, let alone spell their name right. Plus it was selfish of me to write about anything substantial or relevant going on in my life on this site, so I apologize profusely if anyones brain went "ouchie" from the occasional usage. Sweeping changes are in order, and I have concluded that my personal opinions are better left private and unsaid.  So from hereafter this blogspot will be reconfigured into a running commentary regarding the petty annoyances that cloud my life, which I believe is just enough to start a new site filled with the so called "good stuff". The other issues and musings that were previously dealt with here will be transpanted to a new site, one that is primarily for my records alone. If you care enough to want to know whats going down in my life, call or ask me, but no more cliffs notes for you, you lazy xanga whores.    entries will become less frequent, as i'm shooting for once a month, but should offer a detailed glimpse into all the things that irk the shit out of me and might be amusing to you as well, giving back to the community never felt this good.     no matter what though, I solemnly swear that this new site will never ever embrace brainless rehashing in the following vein, "OmG, I WEnT oUT aND PaRTiEd at Blah BlAh aND sAw sO ManY pEoPLE...LIkE OmGWtFBBQ?!!?.." Not that theres anything wrong with sites like that or anything, its just there are plenty of other blogs out there with pretty little pictures of horseys that you'd probably like better than this one.   i just want to emphasize before the fireworks start, I don't mean anyone any harm with the things that will be said, as its merely me blowing off steam after being stuck in hours of LA traffic. besides, i read somewhere that laughter is the key to healing one's soul. MY SOUL especially, but it's all meant in good fun. lighten up and save the PC rhetoric for someone else who cares.   And with this lengthy disclaimer out of the way, i go to write about everything and anything. enjoy and seeya soon.  - suky suk  p.s. - most of the "stuff" on this site is taken from experiences that I or my friends have gone through. The remainder is just made up. But the finished material is my own creation, and is the frantic product of me madly scribbling on millions of little post-its that aren't sticky anymore whenever I get an idea. Its a fucking crazy process and my desk is a mess but the satisfaction garnered is immeasureable. So please respect the site, and give credit where credit is due. Bite my shit, and be plagued with cold sores on your ass for an eternity. word up.    * i love run on sentences now that college is over. I can cram in however much i want and no one can say shit.    MLA 0   Me 10,000.    Step off bitch.

      this is my new blogspot. same format as my previous xanga page, with the same monthly entries, but with my daily ramblings as well. the key factor in the switch was free image hosting and spellcheck. beat that xanga!
