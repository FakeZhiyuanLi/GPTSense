      I spent most of the day working on the search engine marketing efforts for Marathon International in Mississauga with their (very cool -- pardon the pun) Baxi  urlLink tankless water heater  line.  These little units reside in a closet somewhere (usually close the the place that's using the water) and provides hot water on demand.  Jenny and I are thinking we should get one when we build our retirement house.  Anyhow, as per usual, I'm starting with placement on Yahoo.  Right now we're #783 for the 'tankless water heater' term (I'm not kidding) so we have a ways to go.  About 4 of the first 10 listings were from Yahoo's Directory (expensive to keep listed there) but a bunch were from the rest of the web, so we certainly have an opportunity to get up there.  One thing is for certain in my research:  Yahoo likes things a whole lot differently than Google does.  At least there appears to be a  bit  of logic to Yahoo.  :-)

      We're still very solidly placed on all search engines for the French BackRelief terms, with the exception of MSN.com.  It seems to like everything from Canada in MSN.ca (we're very well-placed for all of the BackRelief terms there -- both French and English), but uses the host address or registrar address as a penalty within MSN.com.  Hmmmmm -- may have to come up with another acceptable solution for them.  On the other terms, we're seeing progress with Yahoo again.  Specifically, it indexed our ' urlLink neck exercises ' page and moved us from 102nd position to 28th.  Need to do more, though, so I adjusted the title layout.  Also changed a Yahoo pointer from lower back pains to a pain that speaks about ' urlLink methocarbamol '.  We'll check again in 2 days.

      I still haven't had any time to look at the XodusZero contest -- and today will be no exception.  Too many paying clients!  Anyhow, I setup some links within one of the directories ( urlLink Ontario Canada Xoduszero Services Available ) so we'll see if that moves things up the rankings at all.  Interestingly, this contest has taken a non-existant word from 0 to just shy of 20,000 pages in Google's index in just under 3 weeks!  Very bizarre.  No wonder this business isn't getting any easier!  :-)

      Things are improving for Teleq.  In just one re-indexing of the Soundstation page, Yahoo moved the page from 91st to 44th.  Still not where I want it to be, but a definite improvement.  I added some product page links into the  urlLink TELEQ Systems - Polycom SoundStation Products  page.  We'll see in a couple of days if this moves the page up at all in the rankings.  The Viewstation pages haven't been re-indexed yet.  I'll check again tomorrow to see how they did.

      Weld-o-matic is my latest challenge.  I started by looking at the results within Yahoo for the simplest term -- ' urlLink spotwelder '.  We aren't actually placed too bad for this term -- 24th -- but we need it to be on the first page (i.e. less than 20th in Yahoo) to mean anything as far as something that will generate traffic.  I did an in-depth comparison of the pages with which we're competing for that term and most of the pages that were in the top 5 were extremely light in content.  One was just a photograph in a page with a title of 'spotwelder'.  Very bizarre.  Obviously, getting found this way won't do anything for the customer.  Nobody is going to phone someone about a spot welder just based on a photograph.  There are two sides to a successful search engine marketing project.  One is getting people to the site.  The other (crucial) element is getting them to take some action -- preferably by contacting the client by phone or email so that they can build a relationship.  As a good friend of mine in the AutoCAD world says, 'People buy from people.'  Anyhow, I simplified the architecture of the page being visited frequently by Yahoo and we'll see how this affects our rankings.  Almost all of the text content stayed the same -- other than removing some ALT tag paragraphs.  We'll check in a couple of days to see how it does.  If the new architecture is good, we'll apply it to the other pages.

      I spent a considerable amount of time yesterday investigating the search engine placement competition for Teleq Systems.  They are in a technology field (boardroom conference systems) which tends to be quite competitive from a search engine marketing perspective.  Not a ton of competing pages for their terms, but lots of firms vying for the search engines' attention.  I added considerable content to pages related to the Polycom  urlLink Viewstation  and Polycom  urlLink Soundstation  products -- possibly too much, in fact.  One of the pages has something like 1900 words on it, while I usually like them much less than that.  Yahoo has included these pages in its index and returns to them very frequently so I'm going to see how it reacts to this new content.  If I can get Yahoo to like us relative to the competition, I expect the other major search engines will like us too!

      Sorry about the long title.  I created five more blurbs to finish the first round of modifications to Canadian Flexi-Drills site.  The blurbs were for ' urlLink drill bit extension ', ' urlLink spade drill bit ', ' urlLink auger drill bit ', ' urlLink hex drill bit ' and ' urlLink drill bit manufacturer '.  It took a while to do each one, but by the time I was done, it was moving along at a good clip.  Then I created the ' urlLink detailed drill bit information ' page which uses those blurbs.  It came together very quickly and summarizes the salient content very well.  Now we just need to hurry up and wait for the search engines to crawl through these pages again.

      Did another one for Canadian Flexi-Drills.  This one is a modification to include a table of  urlLink carbide tipped bits  (for bell hangers) that the company manufactures.  It's getting faster to put these together, and certainly the content is much better.  Looks like this is what I'll be spending a good chunk of Thursday on!

      I put a table into the default page when executed with the 'flexible drill' argument for one of the more popular styles of  urlLink flexible drill bits  that Canadian Flexi-drills caries (the 'Flexi-Bit').  By the time one finds, reformats and inserts the table into database, we're looking at about an hour per product line.  However, the content being provided is much better than what was there previously.  Content, content, content... :-)

      Spent a considerable amount of time yesterday reviewing competitive pages to the ' urlLink spline-shank bits ' products for Canadian Flexi-drills and today implemented changes to the page to take advantage of what I learned.  Will have to do the same for the other products.  The first one was time-consuming.  Hoping the others will go a bit faster!

      It appears like the top 10 or 20 placements for  Xoduszero  (the keyword for the Canadian SEO Competition) has stalled.  I've updated the content at my  urlLink Xoduszero  dedicated domain page, plus some of the stuff at the Engineer_to_order  urlLink xoduszero  non-dedicated page.  I still need ot spend more time on this.   I'll bet if I included all the hours I've spent on this project, it would be less than 2 -- not enough to really be taking a serious stab at it.  Perhaps more time will be available on the upcoming long weekend.  It is interesting nonetheless.

      The intent is for me to take over all clients with whom we aren't meeting our guarantee (yet) and allow Jenny to concentrate on proposal generation and keeping our existing clients found.  However, since I can't work on all of our 'not-found' clients at once, we're going to merge into it.  Hopefully we'll be fully transitioned within 30 days, but in the meantime she's going to continue working on the recently acquired customers -- especially the real estate clients ( urlLink Sheila Halpert ,  urlLink Ernie Macmillan ,  urlLink Francis Shirvan  and, of course,  urlLink MoneyMaker4Agents.com ).  I've spent a ton of time delving into Google logic (or lack thereof), particularly with Canadian Flexi-Drills site.  I have some things, now, that I want to try out.  This has become a much more difficult site that we originally thought it would be -- mainly because of the number of e-commerce sites out there in competition.   Content, content, content.  That is ultimately the name of the game.  The good news is that we've got a ton of pages in the index for Google -- 100 at last count -- and the pages are relatively current with the most recent update being July 19.  The bad news is that we have no first page placement, yet.   We also have inclusion in the index within Yahoo -- although nothing has been 'deep crawled' (i.e. following all of the links on the page), so there are only about 16 pages in the Yahoo index.  MSN also has 16 pages in the index of its new,  yet-to-be-released version, but nothing in the old (currently being used) version. We received the official go-ahead for this project from you back in late March and normally we'd expect to be seeing results in no later than 2 months.  It is now just over 4 months.  Google crawls have occurred 4/1/04 (29 results), 4/2/04 (13 results), 7/18/04 (7 results), 7/19/04 (7 results).    We're going to redouble our efforts on the following terms first:    urlLink spline shank bit   urlLink carbide drill manufacturer   urlLink flexible drill bit   urlLink drill bit extension   urlLink spade drill bit   urlLink auger drill bit   urlLink hex drill bit   urlLink drill bit holder   That's all for now!

      The goal of this blog is to allow the team to monitor the activities on various topics.&nbsp;   For example, tonight investigated  urlLink neck exercises ,  urlLink back spasm  and  urlLink methocarbamol &nbsp;and posted inquiries on a variety of forums as far away as Australia.&nbsp; We are making very good progress with the  urlLink backpain &nbsp;initiative for Robaxacet -- particularly on the French terms -- but we need to continue our efforts on the English terms.&nbsp;&nbsp; The above terms are very close to hitting our minimum commitment for our client, so we'll see if we can get them found, and then continue to&nbsp;focus our efforts&nbsp;on other terms.&nbsp; Jenny created a  urlLink backache  &nbsp;site that has not yet been deep crawled by Google and once it is, it should improve results for other search terms.&nbsp; There sure is a ton of content on the site, so most search engines should like what they see.  Earlier today I spent considerable time researching on Google and working with the  urlLink XodusZero  initiative.&nbsp; I really hadn't had the time to spend on it previously -- and wouldn't even be working on it now if it weren't for the fact that the research I do here is useful for getting other clients found.   That's all for today.  -  urlLink Bruce

      Nothing much new to report on BackRelief.com project.  The  urlLink BackRelief.com: Back pain  page hasn't been crawled yet by Google, and the two pages submitted to Yahoo for review yesterday --  urlLink Back Pains  and  urlLink Muscle  Relaxant -- haven't turned up in the results yet.     There are two other terms --  urlLink Back Spasms  and  urlLink Muscle Spasm  that we need to get Google to look at as well.

      We made excellent progress on the term  urlLink Flexible Drill Bit  in Yahoo -- getting as high as #16.  But then a glitch occured on our servers and the next time the crawler came by, the page was down so we lost our placement (oops!).  The glitch is fixed now so the page should come up fine, plus I made a couple of other changes.  Hopefully this will get us even higher than #16.  Since this is the company's main product line, we should absolutely work to get them up to #1!

      We're seeing excellent response in Yahoo for BackRelief.com.   We're now found on the first page of results for 'back pain treatment', 'back spasm' and  urlLink methocarbamol .  We're definitely on the right track here.  Unfortunately, we lost first-page placement on Yahoo for  urlLink neck exercise   -- and I'm not sure why.  One problem could the that every now and then the page on the BackRelief web site that calls the data from our site returns a blank page.  If the crawler hit the page and that event occured, I could see how we'd get removed.  Anyhow, up 3, down 1 -- I'll take it.  I suspect that 'neck exercises' will be back after the next refresh.  We're still looking for Google to crawl the  urlLink BackRelief.com: Pain in your back ,  urlLink Spasms in your back , and  urlLink back pain causes  pages.

      I'm not the only one doing search engine marketing at Avalanche Networks.  We have a full-time programmer, a full-time researcher, plus another full-time search engine optimizer --  my better half, Jennifer (Chadwick) Lamb.  Jenny's started to keep a  urlLink weblog  of the major modifications she's made to new clients as well.  The ongoing minor tweaks to existing customers sites may not get mentioned here, but rest assured that everyone's site is monitored adjusted as we see changes in the attributes that the various search engines prefer.

      I adjusted our  urlLink Clearone Audioconferencing  page to concentrate on the Clearone line, instead of both Clearone and Polycom. I'm starting in 140th position for 'clearone', so we'll see if this new concentration makes a difference.

      Progress with Old English Pantry.  My latest changes have moved us from 'not even in this universe' to 140th position within Yahoo for  urlLink Royal Doulton Figurine .  Not a bad start, but a LONG way to go.  I made 3 minor changes to the site today related to outbound links and we'll see if that has any impact.  I should be ready fairly soon to go after another term.  This is a very competive area with tons of e-commerce sites, so it will definitely be a challenge.  Yahoo is just the first part of that challenge.  I'm waiting for Google to look at the most recent version of the page as well.  We've pretty much written MSN off until they get their new search engine 'live'.  The current version is not taking in much in the way of fresh results.

      My recent somewhat dramatic changes to the  urlLink Resistance Welders & Spot Welding Equipment  page got us kicked totally out of the results in Yahoo.  Go figure.  Not that we were very high in the first place, but I found it somewhat bizarre that we would be totally kicked out.  Anyhow, I documented what I did to get us to our current situation, so now I'm reversing those actions.  But I'm doing so one-by-one to see what change caused the dramatic reversal of fortune, as it were.  Google hasn't yet taken a look at this page, so we continue to wait for a visit.

      I spent most of today (so far) working on the BackRelief project to try to improve things and particularly with an eye to getting Google to look at the  urlLink Spasms and pains in your back and muscles  page.  There are a couple of key sub-pages that I'd like to get reviewed by Google's crawlers, including the  urlLink Spasms in your muscles ,  urlLink Causes of back pain , and the  urlLink Exercises for your neck  pages.  There is a ton of very relevant content on this site and I must say that it has been a pleasure to work with as a result!

      Almost forgot.  Another term that is just at the margin (#10 in Google) is  urlLink exercices pour le cou .  We're currently being found for the exercices/directory.shtml page and the exercices/default1.shtml page with the 'mal de dos' argument.  Hopefully getting indexed for this page will help solidify our position on this page (and hopefully a tad higher than 10th!!!).  :-)

      We've improved things in BackRelief.com sufficiently to the point where we've met our minimum commitment -- 15 of the 30 terms found on the first page of results in at least 50% of the major search engines.  One of the last pages for us to get found for was ' urlLink Posture Pour Le Dos ' (or something like that), but we made our minimum commitment one today.  The next challenge is to continue to improve things in Yahoo and Google for the English terms.  We're laser-focused on a half dozen terms that we feel have very good first-page potential in the next couple of weeks.  We just need the crawlers to visit us more often!

      We had excellent success taking the spline shank bit from 11th position to 2nd position in Google, so we're going to apply the same basic logic to the rest of the products from Canadian Flexi Drills, starting with their  urlLink long bits .  I also created pages for their  urlLink step drills ,  urlLink hammer drill bits  and their very cool flexible-bit Manipulator ( urlLink drill bit holder ).

      I've continued work on the ' urlLink spasms in your back ' pages and back pain relief search engine marketing program for Wyeth Healthcare.  We are so incredibly close on hitting our minimum commitment on this project it's not even funny.  We're being found on the first page of results in 50% or more of the major search engines for 13 of 30 terms, including 'back pain relief', 'neck exercises', 'relaxant musculaire' and 'maux de dos'.  We're 1 search engine shy on 'methocarbamol', 'muscle spasm', 'back pain treatment', 'exercises pour le cou', and 'postures pour le dos', and 2 shy on 'back spasm'.  Anyhow, I updated the 'back spasm' page (currently #14 in Google) to see if we can move it up a bunch of notches.  Soldiering on...

      Interesting -- Google improved our placement of the  urlLink Avalanche Networks - XodusZero  for the Canadian SEO Championship.  As per usual, I've had next to no time to spend on this.  I updated another   urlLink xoduszero  page for this contest with about 25 links to other Xoduszero pages.  I don't think it will do much good -- especially with so little time left in the contest -- but, quite frankly, that is all the time I could afford on it.  Gotta go... :-)

      One step at a time.  We're gaining increasing knowledge of what a search engine likes and what it doesn't, how much is 'enough' and how much is 'too much'.  We added some PDF links to the  urlLink TELEQ Systems - Viewstation Products and Services  page and as much as this provides tons more content from Polycom linked to the site and each of the links included 'viewstation' in the link text, the impact was zero in Yahoo.  I'm almost concerned that it could be 'too much' for Google, but we'll cross that bridge once our Yahoo placement is improved.  I added some graphics to the page - 6 graphics of the various models of Viewstations - so we'll see if that has any impact.  I'm guessing not.  No ALT tags either.  We'll start changing things in increments and go back an check every couple of days to see whether Yahoo likes it better, less or is indifferent.

      I started analysis last night on the search terms for The Old English Pantry for their 'Royal Doulton', ' urlLink Royal Doulton Figurine ', 'Royal Doulton' china, 'Waterford', and 'Waterford crystal' search terms.  We've been challenged on the placement for these terms since mid-June (about 6 weeks) so I'm going to take a stab at it.  This is a tough category, characterized by a lot of e-commerce sites with tons of content, links, pictures, etc.  We're taking a slightly different tack in that we want this to be the starting page for a person to find links to 'everything Royal Doulton' and 'everything Waterford'.  I've updated the look of the page specifically with Yahoo in mind.  We'll see how it likes the new info, and once we get things found well within Yahoo, we'll apply our results into Google (taking into account the typical Google penalties that Yahoo doesn't seem to mind).

      I submitted another page to Yahoo for Wyeth Healthcare (Robaxacet) -- this one concentrating on the term  urlLink back pain treatment .  We are meeting our commitment on another term as of today --  'neck exercises', and the  urlLink methocarbamol  page hasn't been indexed yet.  In short, we're making progress every day in this initiative.

      Nolte Log Homes is  urlLink log home builder  in British Columbia and ships them all around the world.   Really  nice stuff.  They are pretty well found in Yahoo (5 of their 8 terms on the first page) and 2 terms on the first page in AltaVista.  Google has indexed some of the pages but hasn't done a deep crawl for some reason.   I submitted another page through Yahoo for one of the tougher terms - 'log home builder'.  Lots of traffic for this one.  We'll check it in a couple of days.  If we can get this page design and info to catch with the search engines, it could mean quite a bit of revenue for them!  I march on...

      The majority of this afternoon was spent working on a project for Bell-Camp Manufacturing in Ingersol.  There are 20 terms in their agreement, but main terms I'm going to start on with them are  urlLink welding fabrication ,  urlLink stainless steel fabrication ,  urlLink hopper bins  and  urlLink steel fabricators .  We're already at the top of Google for 'industrial chutes' and in 10th position for 'steel fabrication specialist', but there is a long way to go.  They do steel fabrication projects (particularly with stainless steel) all over the world, so search engine marketing is a natural way for them to increase their business!

      Things improved for the  urlLink Viewstation  listings for Teleq Systems.  We went from 231st position to 142nd for one term, and 57th to 39th with just one change.  I added some more external content references into the page.  We'll see how this impacts things.  It's nice to see some results starting to happen with this project -- although we have a long way to go, yet!
