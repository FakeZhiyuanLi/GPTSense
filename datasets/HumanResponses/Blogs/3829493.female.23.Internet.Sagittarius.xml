         all great things start from some stupid crappy old idea then gradually turns into one gigantic great shit. much like some crazy idea that your boyfriend's cheating on you and you of course tries to dislodge that thought from your paranoid head to avoid a fight. then one day you'll just slip and all hell breaks loose. crude remarks&nbsp;keeps popping in your head but they dont just stay there, they actually come out of your mouth and before you know it, everything is a mess. you try so hard to mend things thinking all along it was all your fault&nbsp;coz you actually believed a simple shit. well try as you might a broken egg can never be put together just like that nursery ryhme about humpy dumpy. you end up&nbsp;so miserable about destroying the happy life you tought you had. when you've finally accepted it was all your fault, you&nbsp;later find&nbsp;out you were right all along. all the nights you spent blaming yourself for were for nothing coz the gigantic shit you thought created was never yours.

       you wouldnt believe that each fucking movie i watch, i remember you. all these movies have some mushy scenes on it and the more i try to understand the movie and pretend i was on it not just a mere spectator i feel the same loneliness and crappiness of my farce life.     i look so damn okay to the people around me. they actually believe that i'm so oblivious of the feelings that i should have been having. the more they think me that way the more desperate i am to make it real. making it real for them makes it tolerable to see the movies and the life around me. then my job intrudes and thankfully it makes me numb for a couple of hours to the horrible feelings that envelops me, incasing me in this bubble causing me to suffocate in pain.     i still remember the nights how i wish i was dead. dead to the world and especially dead to the pain i was so alien to. remembering those nights triggers the tightness in my throat and the hand that squeezed my heart to show the pain it was feeling.

       Sometimes i wonder if this stinking life is really worth it...i wouldnt say ive some terrible tradegy in life. In fact no fucking tradegy has ever happen to me. If i consider being unable to attend the university that i wanted a few years back ...and the fact that ive finally proven i am indeed capable of strong likeable feelings to person which most people will term as "love". So that makes two tradegies in my life. The former i was able to overcome the disappoinment and was able to prove to everybody i can be the best even if i dont belong in the "elite" group of fucking immatured narrowminded teenagers. The latter, i will definitely say its the worst feeling ive ever had. Yeah it does feel good when everythings ok but once the situation goes stale and unexplainable things keep intruding the mind then thats when the creeping sinking feeling comes in.

      Pain   i wish somebody will shoot me right in the head to get rid of the pain a pain i can barely take much less tolerate this pain is because of me hurting you  have you felt you can breathe but barely like someone is squeezing the air out of you i tried to ignore it just to let the day go by days and weeks w/o you  have you ever really cried because of a pain you cant explain a pain that can be only taken away by taking you to a nonexistent plane
