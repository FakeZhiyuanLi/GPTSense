      Well... I have nothing overly exciting to post. 'Cept that today was "alright". Nothing slap-on-your face great happened... But thank goodness that this weekend is over. Phew. I have write an 'In-class Essay' tomorrow for English... It's dead stupid. 76 minutes to write something intellectual about  Othello ? I'd have better odds against a fool with a machete. Speaking of fools. I know lots of them. For instance; there was a car accident today at school. This kid who lives up my road (I think he hates my guts...) he probably screeched out of the car park, like most of the drivers try to do and got barrelling down the road off to some unknown restaurant in order to purchase some desired greasy, fatty food for lunch. And then, come storming back to school, in the company of foolish friends and finish up the rest of the day absorbing knowledge like a sponge. Not. It was funnu though because I was walking home for lunch (I like two seconds away) and I heard a tremendous clatter and instantly thought "Hah, it would be funny if someone went into the ditch." Only to hear ten minutes later from my thick as two short plants brother that someone had. Upon my return to school, he was sat on the bonnet of his faded red Jeep Cherokee with a solumn look upon his sunglassed obscured face. Indeed the noon-hour today happened with great incident.

       urlLink    "The Lord of the Rings - The Return of the King" Theatrical Poster&nbsp; urlLink     I saw it last night. For the third time. Seeing it again today. Fourth time. It's funny like how great cinema can be. I mean my favourite movie of all time is "Pulp Fiction" by the mastermind Quentin Tarantino (this site is named after a very famous scene), but that movie is about  shit . Now when I say  shit  I mean nothing. It's not actually about poo. Really. Go rent it now. But anyway, "Pulp Fiction" has no plot, and yet it appeals to me because I love those characters and the words they say. It's magic. The first time I saw it I was like "Wow... This is pretty cool." Then thought nothing of it; I did want to see it again though. This was last... October. Then I started reading about it and thinking about how great some of the things in it are. And then it hit me "Wow." And with that I was hooked and started to devote myself to movies. I love movies. But it's sad because I've only just gotten into them heavily so I've missed a time of movies. Then again, for most of the nineties I was an uber-geek. I still am now. And geekhood has just become attractive (God bless you Seth Cohen), so I should be raking in girls. Not literally of course... That would be stupid. I'd need a net or something of that nature. A rake'll get you nowhere.   This weekend has been... Procrastination City. Population: Me. All I've done is put stuff off. I'm doing it now! But, I did get a project finished. I just have to do some review, read a book and do some simple history sheets. Not hard at all. The book I have to read is called "The Great Gatsby" and it has the plot with an interest level equivalent to watching paint dry. It's as dull as brass. That being said, there is a lot of different circumstances in it. "What the heck is he saying?!" Well, it's set in (and was written in) the 20's, so it's neat to see how people acted during that era. It's like stepping back in time... A magical ride... *Dodges incoming projectiles* Hem.   I had marmalade today for the first time in a long time. Yum.   S'all for now.

      I'm going to have to change the domain name... I spelt "Ezekiel" wrong. Boo-urns. Yeah. So I'm thinking of a new URL, if you're looking for this site next week it means that the thing's been changed... I'll post it up though.  Just got back from school... My feet are drenched because it rained and I, like a fool, walked across the field. To each his own. This weekend is going to be murder. I have so much to do. But I think I can do it. It's mostly just little/big things that are very isolated, such as review for a test (bascially do review sheets), read an entire book (The Great Gatsby) and finish a botany project (naming plants that I've gathered and sticking them in this homemade book I have planned). Wish us luck will ya? AND! I plan on watching "The Lord of the Rings - The Return of the King" this weekend so I AM NOT missing that. I wanna watch it with my friend... To see if she'll cry hehe. I should moan about school but I don't wanna. Really there's not that long to go until summer so there's no point. More later, I gotta get started on tonight's homework!

      Congrats Fantasia! You  deserved   to win.   urlLink    Fantasia, after being crowed the American Idol.&nbsp; urlLink     But still, wasn't it the most boring show ever? The first hour was dedicated to the 'red carpet' which was actually a string of interviews with people no one really cared about. Sure there were some performances (i.e. La Toya) but everything else was just something we've heard before. Had they executed some fantasic twist, like the runner up actually being the winner, or bringing back La Toya into the competition then it would have made the two hours really exciting. Instead... It dragged on and on and on and on and on. The highlight of the night though were the 10 seconds that Jennifer Huson, Fantasia and La Toya London had when they 'sang' together for a brief moment. I must admit that that brought a smile to my face. Something else that stuck out in my mind was when Diana Degarmo, Fantasia Barino, Kelly Clarson and Ruben Studdard all performed together; that was a great sight to behold and listen to. However the solo performances of the two previous winners were... Not good. I myself am a huge fan of Kellys, but her piano version of "Beautiful Disaster" didn't have the same "WOW" that it does on her album, "Thankful". I don't think that that song was really for piano.   But eventually Ryan got to the results and Fantasia was named. Sympathy? Because of her situation as a single mother? I have a feeling she won't be seeing her daughter for about a week due to the press and then starting work on the album. I'd buy it if she had a duet with La Toya. Or Diana. Perhaps I'll buy Diana's album just to spite my parents; they  hate  her. But, as I said, I wanted her to win. The second like she sand "I Beleive" (last night), it was AMAZING! Then Fantasia comes back with "Dreams" and it's like woah, baby. Alright? Apparently the vote was close... About a percent between the winner and runner-up.  I think this afternoon my TV will be turned to FOX, while I watch On Air with Ryan Seacrest. Maybe they'll have something intelligent to say. Doubt it. It is Ryan afterall. And now that sweeps is over (ended officially last night...), all I have to look forward to is the summer season. Filled with reality show goodness, hurrah.   Let's dive into summer!

      I apologize for the lack of updates... Not really, I've been busy. Everyone this side of the meridian knows that with May comes some of the greatest (albeit poorest... FOX anyone?) television known to man. It's sweeps. May Sweeps. Completely different to February Sweeps for the sing fact that this time... It's personal. I have been looking forward to a few VERY importan season finales, like Survivor, 25, The OC, Friends, Will & Grace and... Umm... American Idol (which ends tonight...) Oh! And Alias! That was the GREATEST finale I've ever seen. Period!   School's winding down.. Then I have (Woah.. Deja vuu... Vuu.) tonnes of time off. Whee. Job searching. Great. Corn. Huzzah! And... Other things? Heh.  S'all for now.

      Alias season finale tonight. Wheee. Bitter sweet mind. Also on tonight, Extreme Makeover: Home Edition. A truly great show! One of the best reality show things I've seen in a long time. Then again I larve reality shows, mainly Survivor and Big Brother though. BB is my summer guilty pleasure, which starts by the way.  Speaking of summer... It starts soon. Eleven weeks of glorious weather and no school. The latter and former can battle out for the most important feature of summer. But it also means that job looking WILL commense. I  really  need a job; sure I've given out a few resumes but none have been.. Followed up on. Bah at my town. It sucks though RE post secondary school. I honestly think that it should be free for everyone. It isn't fair to be charging kids tens of thousands of dollars for school, and then people wonder why we're greedy... It's 'cause we need all the freaking money we can get after school to survive! I hate the fact that while we're in high school, students are forced to get part time jobs to raise money for post secondary school, while the jobs interfere with high school marks which, essentially are the only things that can get us to post secondary school. Think about it, you walk up to a university and say "Hey! I have $20,000! Sign me up!" They'll say "Ok... Lets see your marks... Wow... You failed everything. I think we'll pass." "But I have the money!" That is how it'll be. All post secondary schools need to be nuked.  Seacrest, OUT!

      Wow. That was some storm. People in this part of the country will know that there's only a bit of warning for a storm. When I say "bit of" I mean they just say "There's a storm coming yadda yadda yadda" and that's the end of that. But for today's storm there was a lot of coverage of it on FOX... I was trying to was On-Air, but they just kept on interrupting. At one point, there was a clash of thunder that sounded just like a bomb.  I decided to get some pictures of this "rare" occasion (not, we get them all summer). But there was a lot of rain, so I snapped the pictures! These are hot off the wire! Rock on.    urlLink    My finger pointing to the now open heavens.&nbsp; urlLink      urlLink    The rain bouncing off le tarmac. (French... I think)&nbsp; urlLink

      I was supposed to get my first (and only!) filling today. So I got a not from my Mother to leave school at 2:30. Left school, came home... Got a drink. And off I walked, in the sweltering heat to the dentist. Got there, the door was locked. I figured that maybe they don't open 'till three or something. So I waited in the hallway. And waited. Eventually my Mum comes up in the car, and says they're closed 'till Wednesday due to a death. She rang them up to say that she'd pay for the thing there, and got an answering machine message instead. Oh well. But now... It's gonna be drawn out and prolonged into this huge event. Ack. We're gonna get a new dentist though... Whee. School was great today. History was a riot; but some of the kids are getting pissed with me and my one liners. Even I am. I just so rabunctius in that class. I can't help it. The day was made even sweeter when we had no Biology! We had this presentation from this police officer about drunk driving. It was good I suppose. The guy have the biggest feet and the smallest ears! Just a contrast... Haha. Then in English we practiced the scene we're acting from Othello, which was cool I suppose sans the people who weren't doing it right. Haha. Then Business sucked cause of the freakingly ubsurb stuff we're doing in it. It'll all Math... The same stuff I did last semester, and FAILED! It was only sweetened due to my leaving at 2:30. Huzzah! I started to write Episode 2! But.. Yeah. I'm debating whether I should rewrite Episode 1 and make it script form. I can't write novels anymore. I used to be able to... But I lost that flame. I don't know what I'll do next year in Writer's Craft. If I make it in script form (i.e. like a movie/TV script) it'll be AWESOME with camera angles and all.. But none of the character development stuff... But if I keep it as it is then I'll kind it harder to write, but there will be development. Get me? Leave comments and tell me what you think.  That's all for now folks.

      I still have homework to do haha. It's EASY shtuff though. I just gotta read muwahaha. I will do it though, 'cause it's stupid not to. Anyone know what happened two years ago today? " Star Wars - Episode II: Attack of the Clones " was released. Woo! Wow.. I have nothing to report. RE: "All The World's Ablaze" Hopefully I can get a lot of people to start reading it. I know the first episode wasn't all that brilliant... It's just an introduction to Ron I suppose. Hm. Oh, and feel free (to say no? haha) to leave comments. In fact... I urge you all to do it! Do it... Especially tell me how ATWAB is going so I can figure out what to do. Ooh and suggest storylines?  Is that it?  I think so... More later.

           Ron broke through the water, gasping for air. Water droplets jumped off from his sandy-golden hair and hit the sun light, making them look like diamonds. Ron looked around erratically for his surfboard. He wasn't far out from shore, but still enough to make an unseasoned swimmer uncomfortable. Ron, however had been swimming all his life and was well accustomed to the sea's ways. He saw the board and swam over to it, the sleeves of his wetsuit stretched against his movements. Grasping around the board with both arms he pulled him self up and swam to shore.       The sun was getting bright now, which meant that all the tourists would be hitting the beach and the water would be filled with people surfing and swimming. The empty beach got closer and closer until Ron could touch the bottom. He threw a bare foot to the sand and waded to the shore, surfboard tucked under his arm. Water soaked the sand underneath his feet, but he didn't care. He shook his hair furiously, making the final last droplets fall away.       Taking his board he thrust it into the sand and sand down next to it. Looking at the wide ocean he thought of the wipe-out he had just endured. "My surfing abilities aren't that bad, are they?" He thought to himself. Indeed, Ron had been surfing for years, and had the injuries to prove it. He smiled at some of the memories he had, including his Dad attempting to surf. It was certainly a sight. He sighed and got up, pulling his board from the sand and walking towards to road. On the way he passed some tourists, dressed in flip-flops, shorts and the ever-popular sun tan lotion on the nose. Ron sniggered to himself as he walked down the hill to his house.       At eighteen years of age, Ron was still living at home. He didn't really see the point as he Dad had made a fortune as a professional athlete. Ron himself was a great athlete, being on just about every sports team there was in high school and getting hundreds of scholarship offers when he graduated. Sometimes he still regretted his decision to deny them all; everyone he knew had gone to University and he had stayed home with nothing.       Still he walked down the road, barefoot and trailing water behind him. He thought of last summer when his best friends came down to visit. They were in a band, After-Two. Lame. But there  were  three members. They lived in Toronto, Canada and had always asked Ron to come visit. But Ron couldn't imagine leaving California. The sun, sand and surf were a vital part of his existence. "My feeble existence" he thought. He turned a corner and walked up the steps to his house.       Mom: “Hey, how was surfing?”       Ron: ”It was good,” opening the fridge for some water. “There are some great waves out there. Some really good ones.”       Mom: ”Oh yeah? Sounds great. You’ll have to tell me all about it when I get back”      She smiled and left the kitchen, leaving Ron alone. The mornings were great for Ron; he was always alone ‘till lunch time which was when his Dad came home from practice.       Ron realized that he was still dripping, so he walked down the stairs to the basement. His basement. He opened the door and went to the bathroom. Closing the door behind him and unzipped his wetsuit from the back and pulled it off. A seven centimetre long cut sat across his chest. He looked at it and ran his fingers across it, sighing he opened the medicine cabinet in front of it. There was some cream in there that his doctor has prescribed for the gash, he unscrewed the lid and rubbed it over the cut. It looked brand new, but it was a reminder from when he was fifteen. That was when Ron’s world came crashing onto him. It still brought pain to him to think about it.  Ron put the tube back into the cabinet, closing it he stared at his reflection. He rubbed his eyes and washed his hands.       Ron’s room was his sanctuary. Sure he loved his parents but they weren’t there as much as Ron would like. Even though he was an adult, Ron still needed guidance especially after what happened. He looked for his elusive phone, eventually finding it under the bed. He dialled and waited for them to pick up.       Dan: “Hello?”      Ron: “Hey! Dan! How are you?”      Dan: “Ronny! You haven’t called in like what… A day. I was beginning to worry.”       Ron: “Ha, you’re fucking hilarious.”      Dan: “That I am.”       There was silence for a while, Ron picked the scar on his chest.       Dan: “So, you call for any particular reason?”       Ron: “Well… Yeah. I got some news yesterday that I forgot to tell you.”      Dan: “Like what?”      Ron: “Well… I’m moving. To Toronto.”      Dan: “You’re coming up here?” Dan said excitedly.      Ron: “I am man! I got a job! The firehouse up there said that I’d be a perfect addition to their team!”      Dan: “Awesome! So when you moving up?”       Ron: “Well. Actually, next week. Apparently all the papers have the done; I just have to sign on the dotted line or whatever.” Ron said.      Dan: “Oh I see. Are actually okay with leaving California? You haven’t done it in a while…” Dan said.      Ron: “Yeah. I know. It’ll take some getting used to-“      Dan: “I’ll say.”      Ron: “But, it’s a great opportunity. It really is.”      Dan: “Well, I’m happy for you Ron. But, hey I gotta jet.”      Ron: “Alright.”        The gulls flew overhead, their wings flapping lightly due to the strong thermals from the ground. Their cries were muffled by the din of the crashing waves below the balcony where Ron stood. He leaned against the railing watching the surf. There was a lone jet skier in the distance as he raced across the waves chasing the sunset.        Dad: “Hey buddy.”        Ron’s Dad appeared behind him, in the doorway of the huge glass doors.        Ron: “Oh. Hey.”      Dad: “Great sunset eh?”      Ron: “Brilliant. Too bad it’s my last.”      Dad: “No it isn’t. You’ll come back to visit. Well… You better come back an visit. Plus, there’s always Christmas.”      Ron: “I guess. There probably aren’t any sunsets in Canada. Just long snowstorms.”      Dad: “That’s the spirit.” He said sarcastically.       They laughed, relishing the moment.        Dad: “You packed?”       Ron: “Yep.”      Dad: “Passport? We don’t want a repeat of last time.”      Ron: “Lay off that will ya?”      Dad: “Oh come on. This’ll be the last time for me to tease you for a while.”      Ron: “That I won’t miss.”      Dad: “You’re very funny”      Ron: “That I am.”

      I guess this is, well... Uhhh... Weird. Hah. My THIRD blog. I guess I moved this time for simplicity. And the fact that I didn't really need a website for something that everyone else has. Then again, Quentin DOES rule.  To people reading this:  Most of you know me. To those who don't... My name is JD. That's all you need to know. I also ask for people to refrain from using my real name *leers at them all*. Ahem. Well, as my description says... I DO have a soap opera in the works. It's kinda weird though... Yeah. It'll set around a firehouse. With firefighters and all. In NYC. After 9/11 I suppose. Yeah. It should be pretty cool. Look for that. Oh, and also look for blogs I suppose. Hah. I find that they can be quite humourous. So there's something to look forward too.  'Till then. Z-ya.

Engand lost. I'm incredibly disappointed. N'aw well, the tourny's over for me; I don't care who wins now... They could blow the place up for all I care. Bah.  I went to Windsor with my mates the other day. I had hardly any money cause I spent it all the weekend before... Whoops! I hope we go again after I get paid. I did buy one thing though:  Donnie Darko  on DVD. Yay! If you haven't see  Donnie Darko  then you suck. And you need to rent it. I think I'll go watch it now.   So long.

I bought the new Zelda game for GameCube and I bought the OC Mix 1. Take that Josh. I already had it all on my computer, but the music is so freaking good! Huzzah! Yep, and that's what I did today. Rock on Chatham bus thing.  Every time I think about tomorrow my stomach just lurches. It turns over. Man I'm SO scared!! Eeeeeeeeeek. But.. I'll be fine. It's my first day; there will be room for leaniancy. I hope I don't get fired... Can they even do that? Fire you on your first day. Right that's the last of that... My stomach hurts.  In other news... Wait there is no other news. Catch you on the slip side.

      This weekend was pretty good. I acomplished  most  of what I wanted to do. Four of the six people from my English group got together (myself included). We got a fair amount done. We got the video from the library and watched it, so we understand it a lot better. And then we started just other bits. Oh, and I typed up my beast of an essay. And... Uh. I watched "Pulp Ficiton" again today. That is like the best movie ever made.   I had McDonalds twice this weekend. Glutton city. I larve it though. Fuck is this a short-ass post. One thing before I click "Publish"...  "Fuck you Lance!"  Classic.

      Even though there's still about 8 or 9 days left of school, we had the year-end assembly today. Can I go on record and say that it was overly rubbish? With a few good parts. Started off... Interestingly. The band butchered up an Oscar winning score. Well..., Actually, "The Two Towers"'s score didn't win an Oscar. But no worries. It was alright though, but I'm such a fanboy that anything Howard Shore writes is music to my hea-ears. God I need to get out more. Anyway, after that was an amusing video/film. It was kinda funny... The cameo appearance made by my Grade 10 English teacher was hilarious... After that everything was just old and "seen it". The films that the kids at school have made so far are all shit. I'm sorry, but I could write something better in an hour. Well after this came the all important dances. Not. My high school seems to celebrate everything with a dance. We've had a few deaths since I started in 2001, and yes, we had a dance for at least one of them. That is how sad we are. Well after the five-hundred dances the was a foolish kid who decided to make an ass out himself and rap. It was... funny. But fell  so  flat. I could have pulled a better assembly out of my ass. Go figure. Final rating: Six out of Ten.  Now for my weekend plans. ISUs galore! And studying. I'm a bit worried about one ISU (which isn't really an ISU since it stands for Independent Study Unit and this is in groups...) 'cause we have to get together tomorrow, which means I'm the ring leader... Great. I'll get 'em all sorted though! And it'll be GREAT! Rock on y'all!  And that's it for today... Stay cool.

      I'm dead worried... I have no homework tonight. Ack. I do have to read some Gatsby though, only because I said I would. I'm hoping tomorrow will be easy... We have the end of year assembly (great... more dancing) so all the periods are shortened. I only want ONE bit o' homework, and that's my History ISU. Aswell as my English ISU of course. Oh, and studying for my exams (in class) next week... And the ones in the exam week too. Great...   Then again, it's a good feeling; school is almost over. In about three weeks I will be able to chillax all day long. Until I find a job. Man I want a job badly. It's funny, a few months back I had no desire for a job... Now I really want one.   I have hardly anything to blog about... I think the next time I update, I'll actually have something to talk about *leers*.

      Today is the weight off my shoulders day. I had a crap-load of stuff to do at school today i.e. in class essay and a test, but now that's ALL GONE! Now I can chillax so speak... I don't have anything HUGE to do until next week when I have History ISU and test/quiz... And my Business exam. Yes, I will enjoy this while it lasts.  Canadian Idol tonight. I started watching it last year until they started picking the top 10 or whatever. But I got bored, and there wasn't anyone I liked. Except for this REALLY hot French girl. Man... She was in my dreams for a while. Or... Right.  My in class essay went well. It was easy... Somewhat. I wrote about the minor characters (Roderigo, Emila and Bianca) in  Othello . I hope it'll be good. But the real kick in the balls was when the teacher didn't show up. Haha. We had a sub. It was HILARIOUS to see everyone scramle and run around like a headless chicken because they needed to ask questions or what have you.   Hm... Man the weather is playing tricks on me. I was walking to the convenience store... And there was this HUGE menacing black cloud overhead... But it like blew over top and away. It was well weird.   Better git going... Dinner awaits.

      I bought the new Beastie Boys' album (To the 5 Boroughs) on.... Sunday. It RAWKS!!! I love it! Huzzah! It's my first ever BB album ever. I wanna get Lisence to Ill next, which I think I'll purchase when I preorder Star Wars the next time I get paid. I'm such a geek eh.   In awesome news; I went to the opticians today. My optician looks remarkably like Jimmy Fallon from SNL fame. Anyways, I'm getting new glasses and..... dun dun dunnnnn contacts!!! YAY! I can't wait. I have an appointment tomorrow to learn how to put them on and what not. Apparently they're a pain for a while. Meh. We'll see. I'm just trying them for a month and then well'll see what happens thereafter. I don' think they're too expensive either. Well I hope not.   I saw Spirited Away last night. Man that movie was awesome! I wasn't too partial to the visuals, nor the characters... Well I was sorta. But I LOVED the story. The story just knocked me off my feet. It really suffered from the fact that it was a TERRIBLE dub. Boo-urns on that. Oh well. Disney can kiss my ars--oh hey that's all the time we have today. So long!

      It's been a while indeed. Mainly due to my working and not being bothered to update... Yes. Well work is awesome still for the time being. I did do corn again the other day, and I suffered immensely because of it. Beh. I got corn rash all on my arms, ears, and the back of my neck. It's killer when I shower.   In other news, I'm nearly finished my script... I can actually see the end. It'll be a mixed day when I actually finish it because I've been working on it for months. I'm going to hate to have to say good-bye to those characters. Well, for the time being anyway. I almost have enough ideas for a "spin-off" type dealy. But we'll see...   I shall be going for my drivers lisence this summer. Nothing much more to say there... I'm gonna take driver's ed though so I can get my G2 by next April/May. Here's hoping!  Well I hope y'all missed me... But I will try to start blogging more now. It gets so hard in summer though because fuck all happens y'know? Wait 'till school starts up again hahaha.   'Till next time..
