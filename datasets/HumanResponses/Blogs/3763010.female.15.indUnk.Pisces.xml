      where would i be without my eva?  talkin to my dead sexy doggy-style-lovin' buddy always makes me feel better. heh heh.   anyways: right now im trying to listen to happy music to see if it makes me feel better.  actually im listening to (Janet Jackson * Don't Stop) which is more like horny Janet talking about doing people all night long and moaning, but whatever. . .it's not even working dammit.  i still feel really really really sorry for myself.  and you might be thinking "wow..she's a pathetic loser that blows everything out of proportion and needs to quit complaining." and to these people i would like to say that: yeah, you're right. so now im gonna leave you with the..erm..high quality lyrics of Janet.    Janet Jackson * All Nite (Don't Stop)   This is sick So intoxicated I'm so stimulated Feel so X-rated I could dance all night  Work it like you're working a pole Shake it 'til you're shaking the floor Pop it like you're poppin' a cork Don't Stop Don't Stop Jerk it like you're making it choke Break it like you're breakin' a code Drop it till you're taking it lower Drop that Drop that  Everybody on the floor  Let's get hardcore  Make my sweat pour  Ohh my body's yours Don't stop Don't stop  yesh..erm..interesting..it's a good song though i swear!

        Alright well, once again it's 4 in the morning and i can't sleep because i keep thinking about stuff.  like brad...and all kinds of stuff...but mostly brad.  so now i find myself listening to Angel of Mine over and over again and crying because that was one of the songs we danced to.  But then i dumped him because i didn't think i deserved him and i didn't feel right about not telling him some stuff.  And i would of told him, but i was afraid he'd freak out.  or maybe i was afraid he wouldn't care. i guess i don't know. Well i guess that's just another thing im gonna have to live with.  But i always wonder how things might change if he were still around, seems that things would be better cuz he kinda made you feel like you were the most perfect person in the world.  sounds like bullshit i know, but it's true if you get to know him in the right way.  Drives me insane that i can't just go and tell him how i feel too, but i've tried talking to him a lot, and he jus doesn't wanna talk to me.  So i guess i won't be telling him anything...well brad, if for some insane reason you ever read this: i miss you man.

      How Come we dont even talk no more And you dont even call no more We dont barely keep in touch at all I dont even feel the same love when we hug no more And I heard it through the grapevine We even Beefin Now After all the years we been down aint no way no how This bullshit cant be true We Family: aint a damn thing changed unless its you  We were so young  So full of life and vibrance  side by side, wherever you was riding, I went So close, almost on some bonnie and clyde shit You even had the same type of childhood I did sometimes I just wanna know why is it that you succame to yours  and mine? I survived it.  we grew up, grew apart as time went by us and I blew up to both yours and my surprises. Now I feel a vibe, I just cant describe it And in your eyes is a look of resentment. I can sense it, and I dont like it.  How come When you talk it's with bitter and spite? And how come It's my fault for what you did with your life?  And everytime I go to hear you play, you look away,  we barely embrace, you cant even look me in my face.     yeah that pretty much covers anything i had to say.

Linkin Park * From the Inside    Trying not to break but I'm so tired of this deceit Every time I try to make myself get back upon my feet All I ever think about is this All the tiring time between Just takes so much out of me
