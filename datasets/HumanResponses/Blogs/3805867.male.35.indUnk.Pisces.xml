      Well, I quit my job last friday, how cool is that.&nbsp; I've never done anything like that before, it's kinda scary.&nbsp; Anyway, I've been here working for 8.5 years of my life and I've finally had enough.&nbsp; Gotta move on I say.&nbsp; If you knew what this company was like you would move on as well.&nbsp; The "managers" of this office like to procrastinate a bit.&nbsp; I put in for a raise on May 7/04 and they said it wouldn't be a problem.&nbsp; Last thusday (payday) my raise still didn't show on my check.&nbsp; To hell with them I say!&nbsp; I will get a raise by leaving this god-forsaken place for another company that will appreciate what I do.&nbsp; I'm moving on to bigger and better things.  &nbsp;

      This movie kicked soooooo much ass.&nbsp; I love this guy, he freakin' kills me.&nbsp; The weather guy was quite funny as well but I thought Will Farrell still owned the show.&nbsp; Alot of people are saying that the weatherman stole the show but I tell them to "eat my ass".&nbsp; I won't spoil anything for ya but I will say that the phonebooth scene and the flute solo were my favourite parts, you'll know what I'm talking about when you see it.&nbsp; GET OUT AND SEE IT BEFORE IT'S GONE!!!!!!

      Just got back from Mansfield. Such a brilliant show. My review won't be as detailed but here it is:   We were tailgaiting til about 12:30 and went in to catch   Lacuna Coil  . I don't care what anyone says, I really enjoy these guys and they put on a good show.     Lamb of God   kicked some ass altho I spent some time at the "double kick" competition at the Tama tent during their set.     Hatebreed   impressed the hell outta me. I was never really a fan but I think I might buy a CD.     Slipknot   was insane. At this time we were about 15-20 feet away from the stage and we were getting crushed. People were chanting for water before they came on, we didn't get any. When they hit the stage it felt like all the air in my lungs was expelled because of the crushing of the croud. I've been to alot of concerts over the years but I have never witnessed anything like this in my life. My hat is off to the 12 year old that was beside me, he spent the first 2 songs with his head in my armpit. After 2 songs I had to slowly back away from the stage, I hate to admit that I'm old but i just couldn't take it, I was exhausted. We backed up a bit and watched the rest from there.     Black Label Society   were tight and sounded great. Wish their time slot was a little longer since we missed the first 2 songs fetching water to replenish the system.     Superjoint Ritual   were interesting. I have both their albums and I love the band but it seems that Phil was spending to much time trying to sell his new band to the audience. "Ain't this the best band you ever heard in the fuckin' world" he said at 1 point and their seemed to be some digs towards damageplan a few times as well. Oh well, they were great anyway.     Dimmu Borgir   were very cool to see. I'm a new fan of these guys, I only own "death cult armageddon" so there was some stuff I didn't know and they were "wicked hard" as they would say in Boston.     Judas Priest   ruled the roost for me. Rob still wails. Tipton and Downing still shred and Scott Travis just plain rulez! The set was a little slow paced at first (physically), Halford wasn't moving around much, but after they got rolling it just freakin' ruled!     Black Sabbath  : for me, these guys shouln't have been on after Priest. I realize it's ozzfest but it just seemed like a step back. Alot of the adrenaline was sucked outta the crowd. They put on a great show tho. Ozzy seemed like he was in better shape, physically, than he was when I saw him last year but his vocals were not very good. I think maybe the sabbath stuff is too high for him to sing anymore. he sang Black Sabbath quite brilliantly tho. Something else that bothered me was that I could hear a guitar continuing the riffs behind a couple of the guitar solos. Now maybe it was just my ears playing tricks with Geezer's bass sound but it definitely sounded like a guitar, I was wearing earplugs so it's easier to pick stuff like that up....did anyone else hear anything like that????   That's about it for me. This was my first Ozzfest and hopefully not my last.    Items Purchased:   DVD - May (horror flick)  CD - Judas Priest - Metalogy Box Set  CD - Tad Morose - Modus Vivendi  SHIRT - Ozzfest 2004  SHIRT - Judas Priest  TOY - Pinhead Bobblehead  TOY - Alien Bobblehead  TOY - Timmay!!! talking stuffed toy (complete with operational wheelchair)

      Well here I am at the office on July 2nd, 2004.  For those of you who are not Canadian let me tell you that yesterday was a holiday for Canada Day and today is friday which means alot of people that work with me have opted to take the day off.  I don't know why companies don't just say to hell with it and take an extra long weekend.  I'm here bored outta my tree cause there are no engineers here to feed me work (I'm a draftsman by the way).  It's completely stupid for me to be here and to top it off we have 2 secretaries out front that are just sitting around twiddling their thumbs.  Thank god I've got KNAC.com to keep me company with great rockin tunes while i piss the day away.

      Well, I'm convinced, I hate these movies. It's the same crap over and over again. I say "crap" because I'm not even sure if I'm allowed to swear on this blog or not. The day I find out that I can curse on this thing you will get to know a completely different GR I promise you that. Anyhoo let's get to my review...this will not be detailed, it's just my quick thoughts on the flick.   Everyone who has read the books thinks these movies are great. I have not read them and I think they are crap. I was more than a little excited to hear that Gary Oldman was joining the cast for this one. I knew my bride would want to take me out to see this film so at least I had that to look forward to. It didn't help. He's not in the picture long enough to even see that it is him (well, i may be stretching the truth there a bit). Same stuff...Harry dissed by his aunt and uncle who hate him and he has to live with...off to "magic" school for some training in the black arts...a little game of "catch-the-flying-ball-on-our-wickedly-fast-witches-broom-stiicks" or whatever it is called...fiddle around with the stupid "moving painting" in the halls of the barracks and watch the neat-o stairs move around.   I hate this crap....   When is Alien vs Predator coming out anyway?
