      I was just reading the FAQ at JKR's web-site, and I noticed something very interesting...  "The mirror might not have helped as much as you think, but on the other hand, will help more than you think. You'll have to read the final books to understand that!"  Hmmm... interesting, indeed...

      On the CoS Forums, I saw an interesting post, about how on the 31st of this month, Harry's Birthday, there will be a full moon. A blue moon, to be exact. Methinks something interesting will happen concerning the sixth book on that day...

      So, the title of the sixth book has been revealed a few days ago, as all fans know.  'Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince'.  I have no definite idea as to whom this prince could be. I have some, of course.  Seamus Finnagan's father is a muggle, as stated in the first book. So, he's sort of obvious. But then there's the whole thing with the Dean Thomas and how his part got smaller, and how the second book was supposed to originally have the title of the sixth. There's also speculation as to how it could be Hagrid. Which it very well could be, but somehow I don't think so. I even went out on a hu~ge limb (the end of the branch being several meteres away from the trunk of the tree), and thought about crookshanks. I mean, he's half cat, ne? And Remus. But I'm not sure if being bitten by a werewolf makes you half-blooded or not. I would love a book about Remus though. He was my second favorite, next to Sirius.  And Sirius' death. Well, I think he's coming back. Of course. Maybe not in this book, and maybe not back to life  persay , but I think he'll be back none the less.  Luna Lovegood is another one we have most certainly not heard the last of. I think she'll have big role to play yet. It seemed as though in OOTP, we were just being introduced to her, but leaving us to think about her a little more.  The sixth book should be very special indeed, my darlings...

      I now have 1018 pageviews at my  urlLink DA . ^ ^ I am very much happy about that.  I've been drawing lots more lately, now that I have all these art supplies. I can experiment a little more, and I'm developing a new style even. It's very fun now, that I don't have to force myself to draw.   I installed Bitcomet, with which I have been having much fun, downloading all the Malice Mizer movies, the newest episode of 'Le Portrait de Petit Cossette', as well as much Gacktness and other stuffs.   &nbsp; I dedicate this post to the&nbsp;inventor of 100+GB harddrives. You brilliant son of a bitch, you.

      Tee hee! No lake for me! I've been playing Sudeki all day. Which, by the way, is an amazing game. I highly reccomend it to all X-Box gamers. The X-Box really does need more games like that... o O. That's why I need a PS2. It has much spiffy RPGs...  Check out mah  urlLink DA ! Much updating as of late has occurred~! Almost at me 1st Kiriban too. *giggles more, mostly from the painkillers*

Mum says we're going to the lake tomorrow.... if my brother is going, I will stay home. If he stays home, then I shall go. *nods* yup.  Maybe I'll go see King Arthur...

      I don't know why... but I'm happy nonetheless.  I think everybody should go to albinoblacksheep.com. That is the best place for pointless amusement EVER.  Ever ever ever. Go financial planning! Now that's some fun shit. Well, not really... has to be done though. If I get a job, everything has to be planned in advance, so I don't end up screwed over when the time comes for me to pay for my school... hell, maybe I could go to ACAD if I do this well enough. Now *that* would be super.  *pours a cup of tea and recilnes*  Well, I'm working on the Cinderella story again. Wouldn't it be wonderful if I could publish that? I would be known for writing the most controversial version of the fairy tale  ever.  I would love to be known for that! *huggles Seth and Morgan* And if that ever went well, I'd love to do sleeping beauty... and snow white. And then maybe Alice in Wonderland. I'd have to think of one hell of a twist for that, since that one has been done to death...  *glares at MSN* stupid piece of shit won't log me in for more than 5 minutes! WTF?! *grumbles and pours more tea* eew, that was the grossest jellybean ever. Just thought I'd share that.   Time to work on mah story...

      So I went to the library. Among the returned books, was Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind. And when I dropped it off, it was in the same condition I had returned it in. Because I had left it on my shelf for the entire month, and forgotten about it completely. So, my arms overloaded with Dan Brown, Lemony Snicket, and CDs of varying kinds, I made my way to the checkout.  And what should happen? They take out the Nausicaa book, and tell me that it's been fucking water damaged. WATER DAMAGED. Which it clearly was. But it wasn't when I had it. And they were trying to pull this shit on me, saying "feel it! the pages are still damp!"  Which there were *   NOT   *. I know for a fact there are more than one copy of that book. At least two. But they insisted that was the one I had. And it wasn't even fucking damaged. The corner was all that was "water damaged".  And there were worse books than that that have gone back on the shelves! It's bullshit! The worst part of all: I had to pay for the bloody thing.    $40.00 .  I think they're fucking insane. I got nailed once before for a book that had a cigarette burn through the pages.  I DON'T BLOODY SMOKE! AND I'M SURE MY DAD DOESN'T READ FRANCESCA LIA BLOCK!!!!!! Had to pay for that one too. I am so pissed off right now. They were such bitches about it too.   My head isn't functioning right today. I can't walk or think straight, and when I was going down stairs I tripped (because I wasn't thinking), and reaching for the rail, I bloodied my hand up on the fucking brick wall.  Maybe I'm tired, who knows. But my mind was not here today. I felt very... blank. It usually doesn't bother me when people look at me, but today it did. I told one poor chap to fuck off and die, or else I would force him to eat his own testicles.  *sighs*  Too much tea. I'll be up all night. Playing 'The Suffering' again. Meaning I  definitely  won't sleep at all.  But I bought David Usher's newest CD... so there's one good thing.  I'm starting to plan all my stuff for next year. Courses, how I'm going to handle my time and money, and a budget plan. Maybe that's why I'm so out of it, come to think of it. It's going to be one of the hugest changes of my life. It's hard trying to adjust to the idea that now I'm moving out a little more into the world. I don't know why I'm so scared. It'll be so lonely without everyone though, and... yeah...  Bah. I need more tea.    And sleep. Sleep is good.  I should finish my poem too.  Maybe write the first song with actual *structure* that I've written in a while... something a little less free verse. That could be good.  Something to make me think...

      I found a really pretty song... it's called 'cloud 9', by Maaya Sakamoto. Another brilliant song from Wolf's Rain. Bloody brilliant. So, because I'm bored, I'm doing what I always do when I'm bored. I shop for Dollfies. I hope to get a MSD next year, once I've been working for a while. ^ ^ So expensive though... @ @. I got bored in C.A.L.M. today, and I drew me:      (tinted and reversed because otherwise you couldn't see shit... o O. Stupid 2H pencil...)

      The last year was emotionally and physically draining for me, and I fucked up acedemically  big time.  I've thought about this a lot, for many months now. And I think it's the best desicion. I can't afford to screw up again. I need to make something of myself, and the way I'm going, it's not going to happen.  Thus, I announce that I will not be returning to Victoria next year, but I will do all my schooling at home through St. Gabriels, online.  It's for the best. I need to buckle down for the next two years, with no distractions. This way I will be able to finally write my damned book, and I can get a good job.  I sat down with mom, and she said with all the money I'll save on transportation costs that usually go towards bus passes, (600$ a year), she'll take me to England and Ireland for a month or two after my surgery in a couple years, once I've recovered well enough.  I love all of you people at Vic, and you've been my family for two years. I thank you all for what you've done for me. I'll come visit as often as I can, and good luck to you all in the coming school year.

      I finished 'Hunter the Reckoning: Redeemer'!  Which makes me sad... I was kinda hoping it would be longer. I hope there's another sequel though. Come to think of it, I still haven't finished the first one... perhaps I should do that. I need to write. But to write, I need a plot... at least I have characters. So far, I have Rune, Jenna, Luca, Kael and Kaeden, Emlyn, Lael, Pandora, and Radley. They just need a plot... o O.  I started one possible beginning, with Jenna being kidnapped from a field, and Luca waking up from a nightmare of her kidnapping several thousand miles away. He wakes up (in the apartment he shares with Rune), and finds everything missing except for an old looking box on the table that won't open. And... I have no idea where I'm going with it. I'm working on my Cinderella story, Afterimage, occasionally. I'm getting more and more used to writing for a character that can't speak. But soon I'm on to part two, where everything is from Seth's POV. So it will be interesting to find out how everything in his head works. Up until this point, he's just been the shy, injured, scared and paranoid little elf who relies on Prince Morgan entirely. And then they faery godmother figure, Mab, will come into the story. Oh dear. That will be something special, indeed... But enough about writing about my writing. I'm going to update my other blog now, and actually do some writing...

      I have a blog about my thoughts on Harry Potter, called  urlLink Padfoot Lives . Just because. I think about those books a little too much. So why not make a blog about them? Everyone has settled down about the report card now. I doubt I'll be going to Vic this year though, very much... most unfortunate.  It will be an adventure in a new school, I must say. (20 bucks says I'm the loner of the school.) A happy note! Elya said my Gothic Lolita Bible (the 13th one) came! She was kind enough to order it for me. I'll have to scan that one... Come to think of it, I still have a lot of work to do on Digi-Loli. I have posters to draw too, for the local anime convention. It's for charity, so that's really neat... So much work to do. This is going to be such a busy year for me. I won't leave my room hardly, so I'll have to get a coffee machine for my room... and decorate it so I can stand it long enough to be in there for days at a time.  (The plan for this year, is, to actually  not  screw up.)

      So, I've been moving alot, from web-service to web-service. Wow, has blogger changed a LOT.  Everything here will be pretty much permanent from now on. But if I get a domain name (finally), then all that will change will be the address. ^ ^ I think I've generally found all the services I like... took a lot of experimenting though. o O

      ...or maybe, I'm really, truly, finally going insane.  Perhaps it's the calm before the storm, or vice versa. Depending on how things go. I know, I'm such a girl, but I'm actually frightened of going back to school next month. It's a new school and everything, and this means I finally don't have to associate with people, but there's always that little voice in the back of my head that is totally fucking convinced that I'm going to screw everything up. It's sort of my last chance to prove myself, here...  I'm just a little tired of not being taken seriously. People saying that manga isn't an art, or that I'll never go anywhere because I have no useful talent. I'm rather sick of it. Wouldn't you be? If someone, who was really close to you, said that you had nothing useful to contribute to society.  *sighs* And now, I have to figure out how to find a way around society, if that is even possible.  And then, the wiping clean of the slate! I get to start over, in a way! Start a new life, and I can let go of everything. All those people, all the things that happened, all the stress... I can slowly re-adjust myself to people and the rest of the world, without being a total nervous wreck all the time. It's hard to forget things, though, when they keep breaking through the ice beneath my feet. Maybe come winter the water will have thickened a little more, and so will my skin. It'll be a little easier that way.  But for now, I'll stay home. I'll work on my book, study religeon, do my homework, play video games till my eyeballs fall out, spend time with Eris (my oboe), bake cookies, see movies, walk my dog, meet people for coffee, maybe martial arts even! Why not. And when I'm ready, I'll get a job. Then I can save for my education, and buy all the manga and comic books and art supplies my small little room can possibly hold.  Well, I'm going to burn CDs... the converter hath 'dinged' insistently at me...

       a quiet smile barely shows as I think about what could come tomorrow holding a mirror to my heart  under a clear sky that was crying  (brilliant prisms falling in the sunset) listening for a sign or a voice saying I might meet you tomorrow or even in a passing dream the person I've always loved but never layed eyes on I'm soaked with tears now still smiling about my tomorrow I can stand forever now waiting as long as it takes endlessly thinking of you at one end of the road waiting for you to walk towards me    I sort of based this on a feeling that I've had lately. Where you know, in your heart, there's somebody for you somewhere. You may not have met them yet, but you feel like you've known them forever. But all you can do is wait patiently and continue to search, or wait for them to come to you.  Super-corny, I know... o O. But thoughts like that have been going through my head for a while now. *grumbles* Stupid dreams... making me think... how dare they...
