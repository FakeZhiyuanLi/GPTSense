      Is nutzoidal a real word?   I remember creating this word in my high school diary. For me, it meant the brink of lunacy. Being crazy, anxious, day dreamy, optimistic, pessimistic, angry, frustrated, happy--- all those teenage-angsty emotions raging inside one's self.    Nutzoidal just seemed to aptly describe the hollow, hungry feeling in my tummy when I was nervous about what my life was going to be like in ten years. It is nutzoidal when I felt out-of-control of life and things are not going my way.  Ten years later, I am still nutzoidal. I have no idea what my life will be like ten years from now. It terrifies and paralyzes me.

      There I've finally given in. I've just placed an online order to get CDs of Lee Hyo Lee, Lee Min Woo and Rain. Watching all that Arirang stuff could make a previously Korean-allergic girl like me (keep kimchi away), suddenly embrace all things K-pop. Unpronouceable names and undecipherable symbols notwithstanding, the songs are cool and have a distinct sound. It's pop at its best, never mind if I don't get any of the lyrics. Its just the melodies that get me.  Today, I grabbed a CD of teenage pop star BoA, (think Britney and her Baby One More Time phase NOT in her current I'm A Slave Who Got Married and Annulled in the Same Day phase). I first spotted her singing a cute, upbeat song called Milky Way. Somehow the song lodged itself in my brain, and kept playing over and over in a bizarre Pan-Asian loop along with Wo Hu Xi Ni and Dang Ni Shi Ni Pengyou.  After watching Lee Min Woo, I got hooked on his cool R&B flavored songs and his smooth dance moves. You got to see him glide and slide on the dance floor, amazing! M as he is now called used to be a member of the boyband Shinwa, but I think he may well be the Justin Timberlake of Korea, after the success of his solo effort.    Lee Hyo Lee is a really pretty singer, whose Ten Minutes is a JLo flavored R&B song. Great to groove to!  As for Rain, well I wanted to avail of the get 3 KPOP cds for $8.45 each. But I kinda like his song In Anger, with his gravely voice reminding me of Ja Rule.  I remember when i took the Eurostar from London to Paris, a Korean girl asked for my help thinking I was also Korean (I felt a bit insulted to tell you the truth). But she was nice and looked kinda scared and we chatted a bit, even if she wasn't too fluent in English. Again in Paris, several people also mistook me for Korean. Now, seeing how pretty and nice Koreans are, I think I would be flattered to be mistaken for a Korean! As long they think I look like Song Hye Gyo or Choi Ji Woo or Jeon Ji-Hyon! It would help if I could find a guy who's like Jang Dong Gun or Won Bin or even Cho Han-Sun.

      I recently discovered my love for asian pop culture. I have never been interested in Hong Kong films (ok, so I liked John Woo but only in Face Off) or those Sunday morning kung-fu flicks.   But that was before I realized how cute F4 was and how funny Meteor Garden is. Jerry-Vic-Vanness-Ken... Love 'em all.  Then I went on to watch Korean dramas and discovered Won Bin and Jang Dong Gun. Loved My Sassy Girl and il Mare.  Now, Im on my Hong Kong film phase-- obsessed over Tony Leung in Infernal Affairs. Realized how great Andy Lau and Sammi Cheng were in Needing You. Had a crush on Edison Chen and Shawn Yue in Infernal Affairs 2.  This is bad.... I need to get a life

       Vday: tears, Chinese food, laughter and Vanness   Oh, it's Valentine's day? I didn't notice... Yeah right. One has to be blind to miss the red-ness of everything, the overthetop flowers, the sickening hearts and pinky stuff everywhere. Yelch. In case you didn't already notice, this is someone spending Vday alone.   But my cynicism does not extend to the film world. I'm still a sucker for love stories. So, I spent the day watching a sappy sad love story and an incredibly funny romantic movie.   First on my V-day watchlist was Fly Me To Polaris, a film starring Cecilia Cheung and Richie Ren (who has the same Zaizai hairstyle but definitely not as cute) as a nurse and her blind patient. At the start, I cringed at the cartoonish portrayal of a blind man, Onion (what's with the weird name? Is it a translation problem?). He was irritating except when he played the sax. Just when he falls for his nurse, Autumn, he suddenly gets hit by a car.   Sigh, he's given a chance to go back to earth for five days but he can't say he's Onion. As Cheuk, tries to woo Autumn, but she's still weepy over Onion and hates Cheuk. Here's where it gets good, when  Cheuk reads Onion's diary to Autumn, but there's actually nothing written and he's just remembering aloud. But the real good part is when he stops trying to convince Autumn he's Onion and he's just content to watch her. He even sets up Dr. Woo to play the sax, to get Autum to fall in love with him. Ooops, just when you think it's the end-- Autum suddenly realizes Cheuk is Onion and the tears just flow until the meteor shower... (what's with meteor showers and movies? seems like there's a meteor shower everyday)  After my tears dried, I slid the next movie My Tutor Friend, a Korean romantic comedy which has been compared with My Sassy Girl. Well, nothing can quite compared with MSG, one of my favorites. I was wrong, this is a cute film, not quite groundbreaking but funny and kilig in the right places. The incredibly cute and hunky lead Ji-hoon is a bonus!   I thought there was a FirstKiss moment (film of Choi Ji Woo and Ahn Jae Wook), where they were standing outside a red phone booth in the rain. The way it ended up was really hilarious! The violence is handled pretty well. I really liked the subplot about the gangmembers, interesting twist.   With the two movies and a delish Chinese lunch, I have survived Valentine's Day. Oops, wait, Vanness is on MTV Asia Awards tonight. F1 guy-- a great way to end Valentine's day, don't you think?

       Finding my zaizai   I ditched work last Wednesday afternoon to watch Magic Kitchen with Gik. She was doing a review, I was just going to see if Andy Lau really upstaged Jerry Yan and Sammi Cheng's chemistry.   Strolling around the mall, I once again passed by Tower Records (which filed Chapter 11 in the US-- piracy kills a giant) and disappointed not to see Vic's cd on the racks yet. But lo and behold, what do I see at the next door music store-- it's Zaizai's new album, in his snow-capped glory. Sigh, but I was stupid and thought I could live another day without the cd. Maybe on pay day, right?   After finishing Magic Kitchen (disappointed with the lackluster Jerry, but super kilig with Sammi and Andy), I started to go home. Then I dropped by another nearby mall... the urge to buy Zaizai's album was too strong. So there, I handed over my much-abused credit card and bought the album.   So, now it's Valentine's day. I'm spending it with Zaizai crooning meaningless sounds in my ears. Sigh. Just perfect.

       Zaizai, zai na li?   I get all excited when I go shopping. I feel my hands go cold, and i have that extra skip in my step. Its even more fun, when I am in search for a particular thing.   These days, I'm looking for the new cd of Vic Zhou. Entitled Ji de wo ai ni, Remember I love you, it hasn't been released here yet. Sigh, I have been lusting after the cd on Yesasia but paying nearly $18 for a cd which I can't even understand the lyrics too is crazy. But that's not to say I very nearly ordered it, if it hadn't been for the fact that it wasn't available that week.   Last week, there was a false alarm. Gasp, I saw the cd cover pasted on a display at Tower Records. I searched desperately (while pretending clutch the cool new Incubus cd, hmmm... did I really love Brandon Boyd before?). Alas, it wasn't there. I had my pride. I didn't ask the Tower Records people where to find Vic Zhou, for fear of a look of disdain on a mere F4 fanatic like me.   Valentine's day is coming. I hope to have Zaizai's cd on my player by then. So I can fall asleep with his voice lulling me... "Ji de wo ai ni".

      "M"  The songs of M kept repeating in my head. Have I said that I do not speak or understand Korean. What is it about this short guy, with great dance moves, weird hair and cool R&B songs? I have been humming his songs... can't let go, sweet girl and untouchable... Gawd... I have the shinhwa dvd on repeat mode on my player. Acckkk...

       Shinhwa obssessed   True to form, I have become obsessed again. This time, its a Korean group which has been around since 1998. It's Shinhwa.  I've heard so much about them. But mainly I got hooked because of Min Woo. He's the shortest member of the band, but he's got the moves! I can't get over how he can look cute with blue hair?!! Thank god I got the Best of Shinhwa cd in Hong Kong. I have their dvd on repeat mode in my player. I love watching Min Woo in My Life Style and Perfect Man.  They have the cool R&B beats that I just really dig. It's the perfect sound for me. No matter that I have zero knowledge of Korean (except I have been mistaken as Korean numerous times in Europe).  By the way, Min Woo is the only one I can recognize in the group. I don't know any of the members.

       Hopeless in Hong Kong    The arrival  Even if I barely got enough sleep the night before, I was psyched to arrive in the modern Lantau international airport. I've forgotten the hassles and pains of travelling, like bored flight attendants and the snotty airport people. Jeez.    The Great VCD raid  I swear I just love movies-- especially Asian movies! I have gone completely mad (as Sonia would say) in HK. Janfield, a hole-in-the-wall shop near our hotel, proved to be a treasure trove for Asian films and music.  Movie cds were selling for as low as HK$10 (or roughly P75!) and it's original! New ones were more expensive at around HK$30-$40. I patiently searched the store and ended up with about half a dozen or so movies and some audio cds. I got original copies of HK films, Infernal Affairs I and III, Sound of Colors and some movies with Andy Lau and Edison Chen. Korean classics were slightly pricier at HK$20. il Mare, Christmas in August and Art Museum by the Zoo. Of course, I would not go without getting an Edison Chen audio cd, which comes with a sort of pop-up art book with pics! Let's face it, he's not much of a singer, but he's damned cute.  I grabbed another copy of Vic Zhou's RILY, just because I had to get the photo album and calendar. This is the first time I ever got tempted to buy two copies of the same album. Vic is like chocolate, I can't get enough.    CloseEncounterWithF4andAndy  I had given up hope of seeing any asian pop star, so I was really happy when I found a Samuel and Kevin store sa MongKok. F4 had huge posters. Ofcourse, I just had to buy something! I found a nice long-sleeved violet polo shirt ( I can wear it to work) on sale. Alas, there were no shirts with f4. At the second floor, there was a Baleno section and I was really happy to see a store poster of Andy in a light blue polo-- ang gwapo!    Ocean park  Another amusement park?? That was my reaction when our cutie guide asked us if we wanted to go to Ocean Park. Plus the $300 fee to enter is not exactly cheap. Besides I've already been there!  Turns out, the guide should've just told me that Andy Lau would be at the park on Friday (the same day when we should have gone there!!!) AAAARGGGHHHH.... I saw a clip of Andy at the dolphin tank, kissing it! He looked so damned freakingly cute with his boyish hair. DAMN.  But then again, I would have gone completely nutzoidial if I had been at Ocean Park and did not see Andy. Oh well... there's always next time.  Yam called me up the next day, to tell me Andy was at Ocean Park. I have failed the mission. :(   MeetingJerryYak  It was our last day, when the bellboy came up to our room and picked up our luggage. Tall, chinky eyed and spiky hair (Edison-like hair). He was kinda nice, but I almost laughed aloud when I saw his nametage-- Jerry Yak. Close enough?

      Friday blues...   It's the last day of the week and I am literally too lazy to work. I have run out of ideas and all that's on my mind is how I can download the Shinhwa cds on my laptop.   After a couple of hours online, I have finally downloaded the first three albums. (I already have their recent albums). Yehey!!! And I was able to do this because there's no one at the press office.   I'm quite a loner myself. I derive some crazy pleasure in these kpop downloads. Sigh... this will keep me glued to my laptop for the next couple of hours. I have this goofy smile on my face.   This is almost enough to make me forget the fact Yesasia has yet to send the package out. F^$%&%^$$&^.... I am resigned to the fact I will probably get the package by the end of June or early July. Arrggghhh... darn it. And I was so excited to watch the Winter Story vcd and read (??? Korean???) the Addicted picture book and listen to Project S cd.   I better be happy with this advanced birthday gift to myself-- it cost me quite a few thousand pesos. Made me realize I am close to spending 10K on Yesasia stuff. Is this actually sane?

      Months have passed, but I am still gaga over those Korean boys- Shinhwa. I recently got a copy of their Everlasting Mythology concert and I love them even more.   If someone told me a year ago that I would go crazy over a group of Korean boys with oddly stylish hair singing songs in a language I know absolutely zilcho--- I would have freaked.   Min Woo is really such a great dancer and singer. He's got the moves which make all the girls shriek with delight. He's the best dancer hands down. He's channelling Justin Timberlake a bit too much, but he's sexy the way he is. His charming smile, and the way he said "Thank you" --- meeeelllltttt...  Shin Hye Sung, who I dismissed as boring, is actually the best singer among them. He's quite serious, but there was a moment when he smiled and it made me melt. He even sang an entire song in English--- cooooolll...   To tell you the truth, I didn't really like Kim Dong Wan at the start. He looked menacing in the Wedding photos, with his bald head and stern look. This concert changed it all. He's the total performer, with dance moves and rockin' style. He really pumped up the crowd with his rock n' roll songs.   Junjin-- gosh, I realized how cute he was when he started dancing albeit goofily. He reminded me of Soon Seung Hun -- soooo sexxxyyyy....   Eric looked somewhat bored with the whole thing. He came alive for some of the rap stuff, I liked his rapping and bad-ass style.   I was disappointed with Andy, who danced half-heartedly and sang a few lines. Borrrrinnnggg...   Overall, their concert was so great. It was obvious they lip-synched in some parts. I thought Minwoo, Hyesung and Dongwan sang live a couple of times. I had a new respect for these guys.   I cannot wait to watch their Winter Story tour...

      finally, yesasia informed me my package has been shipped out! I cannot wait for this advance birthday present! Even if its a month ahead.   Now, I wonder when Tito randy will go back to LA? Or else I am doomed to have to wait for my relatives to arrive in July and bring it here. i just know I will never hear the end of it, when they see the Korean stuff in the package.   Aaaccckkkk.... I am just as bad as Andrew was. To think I was mocking Andrew for his obsession with Thai music. Now, look at me??!!! Horrific for me.
