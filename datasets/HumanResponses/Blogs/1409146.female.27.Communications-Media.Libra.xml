      Oh my goodness!  I think I’m coming down with something.  Tonight, I will be sure to spend some quality time with my bottle of Robitussum.    Need to pack!  Can’t wait till tomorrow!

      Yesterday, I was in a weird mood.  I hadn’t been feeling 100% due to lack of sleep perhaps from the night before.  I wanted to study, but my heart wasn’t in it.  After work, I picked up my car from the dealership.  I was dismayed to find my car in a moderately clean condition (instead of super duper spectacular).  Afterwards, I went over to Marcus’ apartment only to discover that he was absent.  I grabbed my badge and headed for home.  His absence annoyed me because he told me he’d be cooking me dinner.  When I got to my place, I gave him a ring.  He didn’t answer so I left a message.  He didn’t call me back till 7 or so citing that he’d been grocery shopping this whole time.  I talked to him about 3-4ish and he had given me the impression that he was wrapping things up and was heading to the grocery store where he planned to pick up some dinner and head on home.  That’s a long time to be wrapping things up/grocery shopping.    He didn’t like my tone of voice, and I told him the miscommunication was frustrating and that I was no pleased.  Tough.  After my failed attempt at a nap, I headed over to his place b/c he wasn’t answering his phone.  I figured I’d pick up the coffee he bought for me and maybe study till he got there.  Just before I arrived I called again, and he picked up.  He asked where I was and I told him I was headed to his apartment.  I asked him where he had been and he said he was talking to his neighbor.  He was surprised that I mentioned coming to his place when he wasn’t there.  I asked him if he had a problem with that because I already tried calling him to let him know.  He almost sounded accusatory at first, but he’s been over to my place many times without my presence.  He has no right to be angry.  I arrived, but noticed that he had no pot to boil hot water or a coffee mug from which to drink.    I wanted to leave almost as soon as I sat down.  It would take him forever to boil the hot water and I wasn’t in the mood to wait around for his tortoiselike pace.  I was thinking that I’d also wanted to sleep early and needed to wake up early.  He likes to stay up late.  I made as if to go and he asked me if I was leaving.  I said yes and asked him if he wanted me to stay.  He mumbled something that sounded like do whatever you want and my mind was made up.  I lay down and heard him washing the dishes.  He had mentioned that he could wash the pot and boil water for me.  Too late.  I picked up my stuff and kissed him goodbye.  He looked to his right and my eyes gravitated toward the direction of his gaze.  He had already started boiling the water.    As I made ready for bed he called me.  He asked me if I was alright.  I was fine.  I don’t think I’ll get mad at him anymore b/c it’s a wasted emotion on him.   I headed home and was rewarded with many Z’s.  I feel great today, like the title, refreshed and invigorated.    Meanwhile, Ryan called.  I’m so excited to see him.    Another bonus: Free lunch for Tilford's retirement.  Yay!

      This weekend was great.    Friday night, Marcus, his mother, and I all went out to Jazz at the Bistro.  We ordered three appetizers, some wind and had a good dose of jazz to start out the evening.  Afterwards, we visited Bar Italia.  Much to our surprise, we spotted Monica, Marcus’ sister there.  She’s underage, but at least she’s not at a skanky bar.  She innocently replied that she had just been trying to contact the mother and was so happy to have bumped into her.  Ha!  Mario showed up later that evening.  I heard Marci tell Mario that Marcus only says good things about him and talks about him all the time.  Interesting.  Marcus has been telling me that since Mario moved in with Pat, he’s in a better place.  Maybe so.  We frequented the Pepper Lounge to dance for a bit.  Marci can shake her booty.  Most of the people that night exclaimed how pretty she was.  She’s an attractive woman, but I don’t see how so many people could have mistaken her for Marcus’ girlfriend.  She does have an extraordinary amount of energy.  I don’t know if my mom could have lasted that long…  Saturday was great.  We dropped my car off to the shop then went to the Botanical Gardens to look at the Japanese koi.  Beautiful.  We sat by the pond for a bit and Marcus took some pictures.  The Garden is so large, we didn’t have enough time to venture out into the other areas.    I almost forgot that I made a quick stop to the Soulard Market.  Oh My God!!  I found cheap asian bras that fit me!  I’m so happy.  Marcus had said earlier that he liked small boobs.  I wonder if that translates to his liking asian women?  He said he has no inclination whatsoever, but I wonder if his denial is due to the fact that he knows I am disgusted with Asian fetishes.    Ok, so we got back to my place and made ready to go to Lea’s surprise birthday party.  I was exhausted but still had enough energy to make it out.  The girls want to have a woman’s night.  I don’t think I’ll be able to commit to it.  I’m too busy.  I’m not sure I can put of with our ideological differences on a weekly basis either.  Apparently, Lea wants to read the bible.  Yeah.. I don’t think so.  That night I had a bad dream.  It had something to do with Marcus cheating on me.  I couldn’t catch him with the other woman he had, but I did see him swapping spit with another girl.  It was Shannon.  However, Shannon morphed into some Asian girl.  It was initially supposed to be a goodbye kiss.  I was there because we were shopping.  Marcus and she exchanged a kiss, looked at each other longingly for a second and dove in for a deeper kiss.  He didn’t think I had been watching because I was supposedly distracted with some jewelry.  I saw it in my peripheral vision, but my dream added cinematographic effects and zoomed in on the kiss.  I didn’t let the second one happen.  I yelled at Marcus and was crying.  In my dream, this kiss seemed to have confirmed all the suspicions I had that he had been cheating on me.  He denied everything.  Even the kiss.  I was broken-hearted and mad that I could have been so gullible and permitted our relationship to have lasted for so long.  Marcus woke me up because I was crying hard.  Really I was dry racking (you know like dry heaving, but with sobs).  He asked me what was wrong and I briefed him on the dream.  We had sex that morning.  He didn’t want to at first, but I managed to seduce him.  Bow down to my powers.  The rest of the day he seemed out of it.  I wasn’t sure what was wrong.  He said nothing, but I belatedly reasoned that it must have been the sex.  Hmm.. I guess I won’t try to have him again.  I’m getting tired of this.    We went bike riding.  I loved it.  It made me nervous at first, but I’ve acclimated to the sport.  We stopped early because of the looming threat of rain.  However, it didn’t rain for the rest of the day.    Afterwards, I looked up listings of  Shrek 2 online.  I called up Melissa and Karly and we met up to watch the flick.  However, I bought my tickets online, and they did not.  It was sold out, so I changed my tickets for a later showing.  Marcus wasn’t too pleased with this.  Apparently, he had made plans in his mind to meet up with Merrick.  I was thinking that it would have been nice if he had let me know, but I apologized for not conferred with him prior to changing our plans.  Melissa joined us for some dinner while we waited for the next showing.    The movie was hilarious.    We split with the group afterwards to go back to my place to pick up clothes for today.  He told me that Shannon was having a get together for her birthday.  We went back to his place so that he could change.  I remembered that I forgot my birth control pills and asked him if he could come with me to get my patch.  He demurred that if I dropped him off, we wouldn’t have to stay there long.  I liked this plan, so I dropped him off and got my patch.  When I got there and he asked me what I had been doing.  He must have missed me.  I shared one glass of wine with him, and then we ordered another.  I didn’t think we were going to drink because he seemed displeased when I said I might drink before we went out.  I must have been wrong because the 13 bucks I offered didn’t cover the tab.  Well, my mind and body were tired and calling to go home.  I’m such a wuss.  He didn’t look like he was going to move though.  So, the urge to smoke overcame me.  I had one despite his protests.  I was ready to leave.  He said he needed to think a minute on his plan of action.  This didn’t please me.  Shannon said she’d be there for 30 minutes longer.  He decided to come back after I went back to my place.  While driving, I was thinking that he probably would take a lot longer than 30 minutes.  He always does.  I was also thinking that my dogs probably missed me more than he would and that I should never have come back to him.  I told him I’d be staying at my place.  He said that he would only be a minute, but I’d heard that bit before.  I was thinking it would be a waste of my time to get mad, and I’d rather get sleep.  Besides, I don’t know if things will work out.  I could tell that he didn’t really want me to go home, but I was bothered by his wanting to return to the bar, my dream, and his aloofness earlier that day.  At the same time, I understood that he wanted to be with his friend and that I needed sleep.    We really haven’t been intimate on a regular basis for awhile now.  He says that we’ve been busy.  I’m never too busy for some action, but I guess he gets tired.  I read something about a p test (hidden cipher in case someone reads this and knows what I’m talking about).  I thought this was strange and did somewhat corroborate my dream.  More like disturbing.  A dreamt yesterday that I tested negative for being anemic.

      Photographer P talked to me yesterday as I was making my way back to my desk.  I wish he’d stop trying to make small conversation.  I made my body and my eyes emote this sentiment in how I was angled away from him and my eyes seem to shift distractedly about the hall.  His skills of observation are to be envied, I’m sure.  He was asking me about my bike and if I had purchased one yet.  I said that I had.  He asked me if I biked around Forest Park, and I replied that I had not.  The knowledge of my proximity to the park must be public.  He remarked that he lived 10 minutes away and passed through the area quite often.  I told him that I wasn’t ready yet and only took my bike around the neighborhood on secluded backstreets.  Luck was smiling down on me because another coworker stepped in asking P a question.  I utilized the interruption and made a quick get away.  Close call.  I don’t see why he continues to make the effort of dialogue when it’s clear that I’d rather go about my business.  The hallway at work is an unwelcome opportunity for confrontation.  Don’t get me wrong.  I enjoy conversation and most of my other coworkers, but my intuition bids me to steer clear of his company.    I had a dream about Gav.  I was writing an email updating him on things since I’d last seen him.  In his response, I saw him as if he were talking to me.  He was laughing and calling me that term of endearment that he used often to tease me (cheeky bastard).  I dreamt that he hadn’t married yet.  I’ll contact him in the fall.    Things are going well with Marcus.  I skipped arguing with him this month.  The likely culprit is my studies.    I was reading on the website that I really need to volunteer at a dentist’s office.  I’ll try my hand in that in a couple of weeks.  I had no idea it was so important.    My car’s air conditioning isn’t working.  It’s going to be 90 something today.  How uncomfortable.  Tonight, when I get back from work, I’m going to clean my car out.  Then, my car goes to the shop and I have a fancy new loan till it gets fixed.  Yay for me!  Pew!  The maintenance people are in the building making a ruckus.  How many fat rednecked boys does it take to change a light bulb?  Apparently 3.  This one red headed guy has hair that medusa would envy and smells like he hasn’t taken a shower in weeks.  I’d never encountered anyone with such compelling body odor.  Edit that to repelling.  Yuck.    Lea called me to go out with her to see a dance performance tonight.  No can do.  First, I need to study.  Even if I didn’t study, I told Marcus I would hang with him.  Third, she’s kind of getting on my nerves.  This feeling might be mutual.    I can’t talk about religion with most people anymore.  This nation has been saturated with teachings that seem to transcend logic and thought.  I can’t base my future and beliefs on faith that I believe to be intriguing yet absurd.  When I study religions that preach external salvation, it seems like a fantastic idea stolen from a storybook.  People use the world myth when referring to Greco-Roman gods.  Is it far-fetched to think that a monotheistic god can’t also be a myth or maybe that there could exist another possibility?  Why does it make sense that in life, we’re judged by our actions, but in death, we’re judged by our beliefs?  I’m against a hell.  If it does exist, then I don’t mind going to it because I acted on my integrity.  Why would anyone want to worship a god that would unfairly reward a person despite his actions and punish a person to spite their faith or lack of.   The arrogance of a person to condemn another to hell is not their place.  Many people derive strength from their faith, and I’m outraged that someone could be so presumptive to assume that theirs is the only truth.  This close-mindedness is grates on my nerves.  I find the existence of people that speak in tongues to be ludicrous.  I find the belief to be tantamount to brain washing.  It doesn’t mean I’m right.  I will concede a lack of knowledge.  However, I think it’s a greater shame that these people don’t try to explore other thoughts.  It will only lead to greater understanding.    Anyway, that is why Lea is irritating me.  The greater pity is that I don’t think she will change.  Marcus has faith as well.  He doesn’t like it when I express amazement that people believe in god, so I’ve kept it to myself.  After all it does help maintain tradition, a sense of closeness in the community and some social morality.  Sometimes I don’t mind the ceremonial/ritualistic aspects of it.  The wafers they hand out at communion are yummy to my tummy.  Maybe I should take up prayer.  Or prayerlike meditation.  I do think taking some time out of the day and seeking solace in ones thoughts might do a mind and body good.    Eww gross.  The handyman came into my cube to talk to me.  He goes like, “I saw you come into the cube.”  I come in through a tiny slab of an opening.  There are two openings, and because of a girth restraint that hinders most people, the larger one is utilized with greater frequency.  I responded in an affirmative tone.  Then he goes like, “ So, this is your cube, you just get to hide away up in here.”  Yup, that’s me... and my cube... and my hideaway.  Meanwhile I’m thinking, and what are you doing in it Mr. Creepy Maintenance Man?  He left soon after.  There is only so much two anonymous strangers with no common thread but a light fixture can say to each other.

      I was lazy yesterday.  So naughty!  I’ve figured out another regimen to adopt to help motivate my studies and me.  Today, I will go home and prepare a spinach salad and drink a vial of that ginseng herb.  The concoction usually gives me a boost of energy, so I’m sure it’ll motivate me to go to the bookstore.  I will skip out on exercising until maybe tomorrow night.    I did my little workout routine.  I’m liking my tone.  Afterwords, I got caught up in my book.  I finished it this morning on the way to work.  Makes one think about the ethics of cloning.    I don’t think Marcus is ever going to get me that ipod, however, I did get me some booty.  Unfortunately, it wasn’t very exciting.  I wish he’d kiss me more or be more aggressive.  He rarely kisses me on the lips anymore.  If he does, he does this brief kiss pull back thing.  This morning he let me kiss him on the cheek.  It’s irritating.    Speaking of booty, my baby has such a tiny one.  It’s cute, but it’s smaller than mine now.  I’m thin, but his disturbs me.  I read on CNN that there is an increase in eating disorders in males in America.  I think he needs to find time to eat more.    Things to do:  buy REAL cottonballs, get two cans of coffee, study, study, study.    God, I’m tired.

      Yesterday was fairly mundane.  I went home after another unproductive day at work and did a little workout then wasted the rest of the day with a nap.  Karly provided a break in the day with a phone call.  She’s dogsitting to Dobermans for a friend and wanted to know if I’d be interested in taking my dogs out to the dog park with her.  My dogs are scared to death of most things, but I thought it might be nice for them to get out and about.  However, upon the torrential monsoon-like storms we’ve been getting, I’m going to have to postpone our dog-date till tomorrow or another sunny day.  That works out better for me because I can spend more time at the bookstore studying.   Marcus came over last night.  He didn’t sleep well due to Mishka’s incessant barking.  She was scared of the thunder and wanted to lie in my arms.  This did not please him.   Today, I’m reading The house of the Scorpion.    I'm feeling a slow and languid.  It must be the rain.

      I had the unfortunate experience of participating in one of those speed dating events.  This has become somewhat of a fad among business professionals that are too “busy” to meet people.  The number of people varies as well as the time in which you meet.  There were probably 10-11 guys for each girl that were to meet for 3-5 minutes.  I had gotten dinner with Marcus earlier and accidentally spilled salsa on my shirt, so I had to rush home for a change.  I shouldn’t have been in such a hurry because I still had to wait when I got there.  My arrival was also delayed by roadkill.  Poor pooch was hit in the middle of the highway.  It was a good 80 lbs or more.  Someone’s going to miss their best friend.    The batch of guys present was indeed slim pickings.  These are guys I probably wouldn’t normally talk to in a social setting.  I’m just being a realist.  If we don’t have music in common, then we probably have very little to talk about.    The first guy I talked to wouldn’t stop staring.  Gross.  The rest of the guys were ok, but nothing outstanding.  The last guy was by far the most annoying.  I was going to start giving him a verbal beatdown, but managed to maintain my composure.  This last guy put me over the edge and I wanted nothing more to do with the event.  I’d wasted enough of my time and dinero.  Melissa understood the cruel and unusual punishment that I had to endure.  The host gave me a dirty look when I told him this was just not for me.  What can I say.   Instead, I got plenty of sleep.  I feel much better this morning.  It must have been exactly what I needed.    That book, The Seduction of Water, was a trite and predictable read.  I don’t recommend it.  Tonight, I will go to the library to get more books!

      I haven’t felt like myself since Thursday.  My body and mind have been running on low this whole weekend.  No drinking this week and upcoming weekend for me.    Friday night was supposed to be booked for dancing.  The DJs from Astralwerks ended up being a misprint.  That sucked.  However, the night wasn’t a total waste.    Emily called me up to go to a happy hour martini at the Chase.  It was to commemorate our old drinking days.  Initially, I declined citing a hangover from the night prior.  However, I could not get myself to take a nap, so I figured no more of my time and effort should be wasted.  I was looking cute when I walked out.  Part of me wanted to look good because I knew I would see Marcus.  Part of me just likes looking nice.  I got there and was greeted by Amir.  He was generous enough to compliment me and offer a drink.  Yay for me!  That was my last free drink of the night.  Apparently, I just missed a bevy of boys that had been surrounding Emily.  One of these boys is Emily’s current interest.    I called Karly up to join us downstairs, and she arrived about half an hour later with her boyfriend in tow.  I’d met all his friends before at his surprise birthday party.  Later that weekend, I realized that I’d met all of them before at a Root’s concert.  They are all quite pleasant and charming.  One guy, Steve, joined us later and caught Emily’s eye.  She immediately pulled me aside to gather some info on him.  He remembered me from that birthday party, and I thought he was far more attractive with a boyish demeanor after our conversation.  Marcus knows them all.  He told me Steve is closer to his 30s and going through a divorce.  Shocking, because he looks like he’s ~23 or younger.  Emily seemed to be acquainted with them as well.  It’s a small world.  Anyway, Marcus came in and told me these guys thought Emily was psycho.  Ha!  When she and I briefly hung out with them at a Roots concert, she took a liking to Steve.  (I happen to get into the venue, but left them to fraternize amongst themselves).  Anyway, after that evening, she honed her telephone use on Steve, much to his chagrin.  This caused somewhat of a scandal in their eyes, and she was tainted as a stalker.  I never knew Emily had this kind of potential.  Marcus told me about the ordeal.  After cleaning up some cobwebs in my memory bank, I recalled the whole thing and how I knew them.  She knows them through her friend Cara, who happens to be acquainted with all these law students.  Marcus know Karly and Aroun(sp?) and friends through BP and has met them on numerous occasions.    After a couple of brief rounds of dancing, Marcus and I headed out to Lo, where we were sorely disappointed by the no show DJ.  He was exhausted and wanted to go home.  I wasn’t ready to have my night end, so I called up Emily to join her at Moxy’s.  She was hanging with her new boy and his chums.  Their chemistry was… interesting.  I had no clue which of the guys she was sitting with was hers.  I ended up sitting next to an outgoing guy and we laughed for a bit.  This was her guy.  He ran after me after I left to make sure I was ok to drive.  How sweet.  I went home exhausted.    The next morning began too early.  This messed me up for the rest of the day.  Emily called to go shopping.  What fun!  I brought the cutest dress for $15, 2 floral pins ~$5 each, a purse $23, some toe rings $7, and skirt $20.  She bought a lot, but has deeper purse strings than I.    Later that evening, I went out with Lea.  I think I prefer going out with large groups of people.  Lea and I have serious theological differences.  It’s grating on my nerves.  She knows I’m going to hell and is positive that she knows this truth.  It’s laughable to hear her say such things.  It’s also insulting that she’s not openminded enough to concede to the possibility that there might exist other truths beside her own.  It’s insulting that she would think that I haven’t reflected on these matters and that her limited intellect could dictate my possible future with any modicum of accuracy.  People have been debating these issues for years and have not reached a universal resolution on these matters.  As strong as her faith may be, I don’t think her actions necessarily reflect well on a consistent basis.    Anyway, our evening was more or less uneventful.  We went to Atomic Cowboy because Lea wanted to see Rick.  Rick has a huge crush on her.  She likes to flirt.  Unfortunately, he was working at the Pageant.  Instead, Peter was there.  Peter is good to me.  Anyway, Mario walked in later and started talking about this guy Marty.  Marty has a crush on Lea as well.  It seems as though he’s not as pristine in character as Lea had initially suspected.  He dabbles in hard drugs and has a plethora of stripper girlfriends.  She was not pleased after hearing this and wanted to go to Rue to see if he was there and possibly to have drinks on his tab.  We hunted him down in a fruitless search, after all, I’m about free alcohol.  I saw some people I knew and hung out with them for a bit.  I think it was odd that she was so adamant about seeing him.  Why did she care?  She said something about him looking bad and wanting to see how he was going to react to her (as if he would know of her freshly gained insight).  Why would he react any different?  It was stupid.  She probably just felt stupid for having thought he was a nice guy and wanted to get back at him in a passive aggressive manner.  Marcus finally came over to meet up with us and we went to a house party but tired of the scene early.  We went home and straight to bed.  The next morning I managed to seduce him.  Our sex quota for the week was met.  I wish I had more energy.  I am glad that we haven’t been seeing much of each other.  It causes less friction in our relationship.    Sunday, I went to Lea’s parent’s house for a birthday bbq.  She’s finally turned 21.  I wasn’t expecting such a religious household.  I had wanted Marcus to come, but I’m glad he didn’t.  He would have probably felt uncomfortable.  Within 10 minutes of my arriving, they broke out into prayer.  Hmm.. yeah.  Dinner was nice with cordial intercourse.  I got to jump on the trampoline afterwards, but knocked myself silly playing crack the egg.  There’s a nice shiner on my forehead now.  I left after a couple of hours and went home to catch up on some Z’s.    Today, I’m tired, but it’s speed dating tonight.  Should be fun.  I’m going for Melissa.  She wants to meet a new man.  More on this tomorrow.

      I apologize for the drunken post.  I was being selfish.  I’m going to try not to get angry and resign myself to being temporarily disappointed with a bright light at the end of the tunnel.  I woke up today feeling groggier than usual.  I hit the snooze bar a couple of times, a habit whenever Marcus spends the night.  I like a little morning snuggle.  Marcus did end up coming over to my place last night.  I wonder if he came over because he wanted to see me or if he came because he has no bed at the moment.  Soon, I plan to get my Illinois driver’s license.  I’m excited.  I think it’s a disgrace that I have to pay personal property tax on my vehicle in MO.  It was foolish of me not to have my car under my mother’s name.    Studying is going well.  If I continue at this rate, I will definitely be ready for my exam in June.  Tomorrow is flash card day.  With the looming date of application soon approaching, I have little time to think about distractions like relationships.  I don’t mind that I haven’t being seeing as much of Marcus these last few weeks.  I don’t mind that we haven’t been having sex either.  In fact, I’ve been having fewer breakouts since our sex has been minimized to a weekly event.  It’s probably because my sexual frustration has taken a hiatus.    He hinted that he would want some tonight.  I don’t think that’s going to happen.  It’s unfair that I always give into him.  Tonight, I plan to stay out late, but if we happen to have sex, then so be it.    A while ago, he told me I’d have difficulty finding someone better in bed than he.  Funny.  I remember thinking that he sucked when I first met him.  He only got better after he realized he wanted to be with me.  Now, he’s just mediocre.  The difference between now and the first time is that I have more control over when I come.   I hope to god that he’s not the best I’ll ever have.    I’m really looking forward to the end of May.  I can’t wait to see Ryan.  Good music, thoughtful conversations and great people watching.  Jimmie’s sister is going to culinary school there as well.  He thinks I should meet up with her.  Maybe it will be nice.  Maybe I will get free food!

      Marcus is a fucking idiot.    I wish I had a cig.    I came home today from studying at about 10 p.m.  He had called, but I left my cell at phone.  As soon as I had seen his call, I returned it.  He was at eleven with Mario.  Mario the dumbass.  It was his graduation party.  Marcus wanted to know if I could join him at the restaurant, but I had to wake up at 6:30 the next morning.  However, I was hopped up on caffeine and as soon as I had heard the voicemail he had left, I changed my mind.  It’s easy to convince me to go out.  You only have to ask a couple of times.    I called him back and asked him how long he was staying.  He said not very long unless I came.  I told him I thought I might stop by.    When I got there he was on his cell, not such an uncommon thing for him, so I talked to some people that were already there.  He got off his cell and continued whatever conversation he had had with other people around us.  I didn’t bother to interrupt.  I figured I came out of my way to see him, I wasn’t interested in going further.  Besides, the conversations I had struck up were refreshing.  I’d never talked to Barry at length or his friend Karly.  I like Karly.    When it came time to leave, Mario had voiced his desire to go to 609.  I wasn’t willing to sacrifice my Friday workday for Mario and declined the invitation.  I looked to see what Marcus would do.  He stayed behind with me.  He thought I was going to 609.  I told him I wasn’t, but I guess he wasn’t listening.  I told him I’d drop him off to his car instead (even though 609 is closer).  I used the bathroom and then left after we hugged each other goodbye.  I must have been short of hearing b/c he thought I’d wait for him.  Some minutes later, he called and asked why I left, and I told him I wanted to go home.  I think he’s short of hearing like me.    I’m upset b/c he’s not really there for me.  I told him I understood and knew that he feels like he needs to be there for Mario.  Mario isn’t the only one that graduated.  I did too.  I’m just not making a big deal out of it.  I’m not going to my graduation and I’m not throwing myself a graduation party.  If Marcus feels like Mario needs more attention then so be it.  He earns marks from Mario, but loses marks from me.  I told him I came out b/c I heard his voicemail.  I told him it’s not too hard to convince me to go out.  My friends do it all the time.  They tell me I’m a pushover.  Marcus says he doesn’t want to beg.  Well, I beg to differ.    I don’t know how long he will last.  He said he wouldn’t be staying long.  That’s what he said earlier that night about eleven.  I don’t mind being woken up in the middle of the night, but he knows that I’ve been having trouble sleeping when he comes to my place late at night.  It bugs me that he’s not picked up on that, but that might be expecting too much of him.    I don’t like the progression in our relationship.  It seems like now, he has all these obligations he has to keep with other people.  It seems like all these people take precedence now.  I don’t mind not seeing him.  I’d rather know that I’m not seeing him than him saying that there’s a chance he might come to see me then not show up.  That’s highly irritating.  I think I’ll be spending a lot of my time studying.  He said that he might come and see me after work today.  Instead, he went to Mario’s graduation.  I’m ok with that.  Then he said he might see me afterwards.  I know Mario.  I know he’s going to want to go out for drinks afterwards.  I told Marcus that it was ok if he wanted to hang with Mario and that I would be ok with seeing him the day after.  I hate that he says well, he doesn’t know what’s going to happen.  If he doesn’t know what’s going to happen, then say that he can’t come over.  I don’t like that he’ll see what he can do.  So far, his track record has been poor and usually something comes up.  I want him to say that he has to be there for Mario.    I hate cell phones.    I think it’s funny when he says that he’s empathic and that he can relate to people.  I think maybe he can relate to the average person.  I don’t think he can understand me.  He says people say he has an old soul.  These people must be limited in scope.  Most people are.  I think he’s full of himself.    I miss feeling crazy in love with someone and having that feeling reciprocated.  I miss Gav.    I can’t wait till I take my exam.

      I get off work early today because of a doctor’s appointment.  Although I’m not looking forward to my yearly exam, I am excited about trying a new birth control pill.  You might think this to be somewhat mundane, however I see this as being a potential quick fix to my pms dilemna.    Since this is a new post, I’d better elaborate on the above.  I don’t always maintain a cool temperament to put it mildly.  During that time of the month, I notice the tendency to be more controversial against my will.  It makes me feel so evil and difficult because all the things I would normally let slide become hostile points of contention.  Before dating Marcus, I would seclude myself until the temper had passed.  However, dating a person puts you at constant exposure to them.  Marcus has been victimized by this uncontrollable urge that overcomes me every so often.    I’m not sure how much he can take.  Probably not much more.  He and I have been dating since August of 2003.  I hold our previous history as “friends” against him, and it will be a lessoned learned (never get into a relationship with someone that has previously disrespected you no matter how pretty his words may sound).  It points to someone that is heavily self-centered.  Although that’s not necessarily bad, I know I need more.      Last night, he thought I’d voiced excessive complaints.  They were small little things like his not helping me with the dishes anymore, his eating our leftovers yet being unwilling to share his (I combined that with an apology because I didn’t know he had eaten ours when I asked to eat the leftovers he had from a previous dinner in the fridge; but I still don’t think that was cool), and the fact that I never liked that he cut people’s hair in my apartment, yet refuses to cut people’s hair at his new apartment because he wants to keep it clean.   These are all trivial, but points that I happened to bring up throughout the evening.  He makes it sound like it’s something that wouldn’t bother him were he in my shoes, but I noticed when he had roommates he would comment on little habits they had that slightly irked him.    I don’t think he’ll last past December.  I want to say I tried, so I’ll do what I can to make my temper heed my will, but I wonder how much he or I can take.  I’ve come to the conclusion that I can’t change him, only he can change himself or we have to learn to acclimate ourselves to each other.  I’m just waiting to see if that’s going to happen.    The summer months are soon approaching.  I hope I’ll be ready to take my tests when the time comes.

      The problem probably started when I told Marcus I’d also be applying to a school in Michigan and North Carolina.  He’s not fond of any of those states, and I offhandedly made the remark that we might have to break up if things didn’t work out.  Now, he’s talking about leaving in December (May is my deadline).  My position is similar to what yours was, but there is no question in my mind that I’m leaving for school.  I’m also not thinking of him as being the one I want to marry, even though our kids would be so cute (he doesn’t think this talk is funny).  The biggest plus is if we break up this way, we’ll still be friends.    I’m going to cry, or maybe just tear up a little.    Marcus can’t take his work anymore and has a sure thing waiting for him in Minneapolis.  The city has impressed him.  However, I don’t want to leave without knowing which school I’ll be attending.  I’ll also be able to save up much more money here.  I don’t know if things are going to work out, but the possibilities are frustrating.    I'm being selfish...  I know.

      This is the coolest game.  You use American icons to defeat the Bush administration.  It’s a nice lesson in history as well.  http://www.emogame.com/bushgame.html  Last night with Marcus was weird.  Yesterday with Marcus was weird.  I think he might be reacting to me.    Early yesterday morning, he called to say hi.  I was slightly upset with him for his absence the previous night when he called me spoiled.  It was inappropriate.  I told him I was mad at him, and he said he knew.  He probably thought I was upset because he didn’t spend the night.  I would have liked him to have him spend the night, but all signals indicated that he wasn’t inclined.  He said I was being spoiled for wanting him to come over.  I spent the night at his place for most of last week.  I don’t like that he has such difficulty reciprocating in kind.  At least he apologized in his call for speaking out of place.    Last night he told me that his salon is having a sale that ends today.  He asked me to cut him a check for $17 to cover the cost of the shampoo.  What an outrageous request!  I don’t believe he’s short on funds, so why would he ask me to cover such a cost.  I’ve bought him gifts in the past even though the thought rarely strikes him to do so in kind, but here he comes and tells me that I need to give him a piddly $17 to cover the cost of hair products?  I have letting go of an amount, but it would have been nice if he could just surprise me with something like that.  After all, he has offered to many times to give me these things and instead he turns around and decides to charge me.    What bugs me about him is that he doesn’t follow through.  For instance, he tells me that he might come over and he doesn’t, or he tells me that he will buy me products and he doesn’t, or he tells me that he will do something for my graduation and he doesn’t.    I’ve noticed that he’s been awfully reluctant to pay for anything lately.  As a matter of fact, I can’t recall the last time he paid for dinner.  Even sex last night was off.  He went to Taco del Mar right afterwards and ate in his car.  He was gone long enough for me to fall asleep and wake back up.  This morning, I didn’t spare too many words for him, made a shake without offering any to him and left without kissing him goodbye.    I think I feel a cool draft coming in.  However, I am open to the possibility that I opened the window.  I’m so glad that he is my first.  The ease at which my mood shifts is unsettling.  I would be reluctant to subject others to this.

      I plan on taking my exams sometime next month.  The pending date is to be determined, but will probably be around the 19th.  I figure taking the exam right after a weekend will offer me my best chances.  The application process is grating on my nerves.    After much perusal online, I've determined that I should send out my applications without my DAT scores.  It turns out that they begin processing in June, so I figure I should write my personal mission statement in June and give it to my dentist for initial perusal.  I'm visiting with her at her office for a couple of weekends.  She's faculty at a dental school here in Missouri, and I think that she would probably be a great reference.    With the submission of my application, I would probably be subject to initial rounds of interviews starting in September (hopefully).  The interview process is extremely formal and probably would consist of a panel.  Eek!  When the time comes for this, I'm going to have to do a ton of research.    I've been reading up on financial costs that I will most certainly accrue and have determined that UIC is definitely my first choice.  However, they say that public schools have the most stringent admission guidelines.  If such a case were to arise, I will most certainly look at the east coast.    All this change makes me very nervous.    I was thinking that I might take some classes after the fall term expired.  It might behoove me to take some histology, biochemistry, cell biology, etc.  One step at a time though, you know?  I'm done reviewing my biology.  I'm halfway done with Chemistry have made a good dent into my orgo.  Maybe by the end of this week, I will be finished with Chemistry and almost done with Orgo?  I want to leave July for intensive review and practice exams.    The test is 4 hours long.  There is a section devoted to the natural sciences (see above), perceptual aptitude (I'm good with puzzles!), quantitative reasoning, and reading comprehension.  My weakest point is usually reading comprehension.  I just hope that the first three far outshines the last bit.  I didn’t see Marcus last night.  The night before he came home late (between 12-1 a.m.).  I’m trying to focus on my studies.  Part of me is jealous that he’s become so fond of his neighbor John.  Well, at least John is better than Mario.  Sooner or later, Marcus will miss me and will visit.  I talked to him about school today and said that I planned on applying to North Carolina and Michigan.  Marcus said that he didn’t know if he could move to those states.  I told him that I guess when the time came we would break up if conditions weren’t suitable.  I know that I would not move for him right now, so it’s unreasonable for me to assume that he would inversely reciprocate.

      My posts concerning Marcus haven’t always had a positive tone, but the truth of the matter is that they indicate uncertainty.  On occasion he does small things that irritate me, and these actions prompt me to make a post.  It’s like the news.  We usually only see/read/hear bad news; however, this doesn’t color the spectrum of news out there.    Since he got his own place, we’ve been amicable.  No arguments.  I think we might last 3 months.  Yay!  I had my reservations concerning the longevity of this relationship but remain hopeful.    I love that he hugs me when I sleep next to him.    He probably thinks I’m such a schizo.  The new birth control pills do help in controlling my temper now.  I think I was experiencing too many side effects ie. mood swings with the overdose of estrogen/progesterone.    The test month is soon approaching.  I remain distraught.  Mom is still pissed but is now spending time with Adrian.  Thinking about sending Dad some flowers.

      The past weekend was uneventful as far as amusing endeavors are concerned.  However, I do have a rant.  Sunday, we went over to Mario’s pad for lunch.  I really don’t like him, but I’m being nice to him because he’s Marcus’ friend.  Marcus knows of my feelings towards the bastard.    When we interact, the feeling he gives me is one filled with misdirection.  He reminds me of a girl with low self-esteem.  These girls are dangerous at times because they think too much in treacherous ways.  I could be more forgiving if he was ignorant of his actions, but he’s cognizant and likes to test people.  He likes to boast of his skills of manipulation.  Why would I want to associate with the likes of him?  It’s shady, and I want nothing of it.  He will only mess with me later.    Yesterday, he invited us over for lunch.  Next time I will be sure to say no even though he does bring in the best seafood I’ve ever had.  It is beneath me to use someone for food, but temptation lures me to forget on occasion.  Anyway, Marcus and I made some sushi rolls and met his friend Chris.  Chris is a ghetto Asian flamer, the most amusing combination.  We had a nice lunch, but Mario was upset when he learned that I wanted to leave afterwards and said that was untoward of me to leave after eating.  He insisted we go to the pool with him.  I was not favorable to taking a dip, but relented to accompanying him to the pool (pushy people irk me).  Chris went in for one dip, but Mario was really the only one that frolicked in the water.  He was not very considerate of the other poolside inhabitants and made a show of jumping in different positions and making a huge water bonanza.  By their looks, they weren’t very appreciative.  He then proceeded to talk a lot of shit about the foreigners by the pool even though he himself is one.  The disparaging inane comments that spew out of his mouth are unsavory.  He sounds so ignorant and low class.  It makes me sick to think of my association with someone so crass, undignified and bigoted.    Marcus makes the excuse that Mario is just European.  His mannerisms reflect poorly on his country.  Marcus has had limited exposure to Europeans.  More than half of the people with whom I’ve ever associated were from the old world, so I think Marcus’ exposure has been limited.  I’ve never met one that comes as close to being as uncouth as Mario.  To me, Mario reminds me of a spoiled party kid.    Their friendship bothers me.  I know that he will have many friends like Mario.  I don’t mind being acquainted with the likes of Mario, but my time is wasted when spent in his company.    The other day, I mentioned how happy I would be to leave St. Louis a year from now.  Marcus said he didn’t think he could even last a year.  I’d forgotten about keeping that bit to myself.  My mind has been made up that my stay in St. Louis would run until my lease expires.  The arguments to leave in December elude me and rest in the area of impracticality.  Anyway, I won’t know which school accepted me by December.  It would be a moot point to randomly leave to an undetermined location.  If he chooses to leave early, he will do so without me.  He must realize that our relationship is dying.  Geographic relocation always works to finalize things.  It’s exactly what I need to separate myself from him.   I’ve noticed that I’ve changed around him.  I don’t like it.  I’ll miss him if we aren’t together.  I can see why people are drawn to him.  I love Marcus, but knowing that someone like Gav could exist makes me optimistic that I’ll find another, especially if I could have fallen for someone like Marcus.    Age sure does creep up on a person.  As the years go by, I’m realizing the limitations it brings me.  However, I can only hope that things will get better.    Photo P spotted me in the loop later that day.  Ugh.  He had cupped his hands to say something unintelligible to me, and I ignored it.  People usually make comments that I don’t understand as I walk by so disregarding people has become second nature.  I asked Marcus what the man had said as we passed him.  “Boeing is calling you”.  At once I knew who it was.  I was rolling my eyes on the inside, but realized how rude I must have seemed.  I didn’t really care but was not looking forward to seeing him again.  I knew that I would probably bump into him on the way back, but hoped his outdoor luncheon would have broken up long before my shopping trip ended.  I really don’t like him.  He was getting on his bike while when we returned.  If he hadn’t called out my name, I would never have seen him.  I made an excuse for my earlier rudeness and kept the conversation short.  What a pain.    I think I was meant to be a hermit.  Is it so wrong that I don’t like knowing people?  Most fill me with disappointments or disdain.  I think tonight, I’ll spend quality time with my Mishka and my studies.

      Last night with Marcus was great.  I wasn’t thoroughly productive, but I woke up this morning refreshed.  I like that we live apart.  Helps maintain my sanity and his and giving a sense of personal space, which is something I need.  His place is looking swanky.  He bought a white plastic table from IKEA and this cute yellow triangular rug.  I like the rug and his placemats.  The table is ok for now.  His pad is comfortable.    This is a piece of correspondence between Adrian and me.    -----Original Message----- From: Adrian  Sent: Monday, June 07, 2004 7:57 PM To: mondapop Subject: RE: here's my addy  Grace,       Yes, you can cancel your insurance.   I will call the insurance office with the number tomorrow.  You shouldn't apologize.  You were being very sweet and tactful, a perfect daughter.   Sunny is dealing with many problems right now and reacts differently than she normally would.  (I think).     Don't worry about the check until I get the bill and pay the premium.   I will let you know.  Thanks for your encouragement.  I really enjoyed our conversation.   Have a good week.

She didn't seem to be in a better mood when I called later that evening.  I apologize for the uncomfortable situation I catalyzed.  Upon more thought, I think it would be more sane for me to keep my distance until she's cooled off considerably.  My tolerance is dwarfed by your own.  However, I did have a pleasant time talking with you.  She has spoken many times of your patience and gentleness.  I'm very happy that she has someone like you in her life. > >Should I call my insurance agent to cancel my coverage or wait till the end of the week?  I forgot to leave you a blank check.  When you've discovered the amount I owe, please advise.  I like him.  He thinks I’m much nicer than I am.  This image he has of me encourages to me to be a better person.  I think this is a good lesson to keep in mind.  It’s always better to catch flies with honey than with vinegar.  People react positively when dealt with in a positive manner.  He’s good at killing people with kindness.

      The weekend visit to my mom ended with the all too familiar drama that characterizes my family life.    Friday, my mom was overjoyed to see me.  We had our lines of communication mixed up and she thought I was going to arrive at a later time.  While I waited for her to come home from the airport to pick up Adrian, I called my sister for a brief visit.  I know now where she lives.  Her condo was riddled with filth.  Because I had just come from a 4 hour drive, the need to relieve myself was overbearing.  She directed me to my brother’s bathroom.  It seemed to capture the odor reminiscent of his Purdue apartment.  I couldn’t quite place the origin of this fragrant “Eww de Jay”.  He kept say that it’s really pronounced “eau”.  Torstoy looked a mess.  He is in desperate need of a haircut and bath.  His nails are longer than any dragonlady I’ve ever seen featured in a magazine.  Gross!  Lucy seemed fairly active and happy, but both dogs were chubby.  Poor babies.  I took a peek into my brother’s bedroom.  There is excrement indiscriminately scattered around his bed.  I made the recommendation that he set up his bed in the living room.  The dogs are barred from that area.  He stated that he felt it was dirtier.  The whiteness of the carpet must have given him that impression.  Gross!  I couldn’t stay long because I had to meet up with my mom and Adrian for dinner.  We ended up having sushi.  We chatted for a bit and my mom lamented on the state of my brother and sister.  She wants my brother to consider graduate school but is outraged at the notion that she would have to pay for it all.  The lack of a summer income for my sister causes her some amount of restlessness as well.  She wanted me to talk to both of them.  I told her it wasn’t my place and asked her what she thought could come of it.  She sighed and left the conversation for a later time that night.  After my mother had taken some sleeping pills, she came and talked to me for a bit.  She went on and on about how depressed the looming insurance fraud investigation made her feel.  She was apparently immobilized for two weeks over this matter (I can just imagine her lying in a fetal position in front of her plasma tv display).  Even worse was the lack of communications between my siblings and her.  She complained that they never called her anymore.  Then she stated that she wanted to go far, far away.  I vocalized my objection to this idea and told her she shouldn’t just disappear with no way of anyone to contact her.  She acquiesced and said that she would tell me of her general info.  Melodrama.  She said that she washes her hands of the matter, but begged me to speak with them.    Saturday, we went and fixed up my car and grabbed some breakfast.  Then we made a quick stop to Walmart and Petsmart (I offered to buy my sister’s dogfood).  I hadn’t planned on spending a significant amount of time with my brother and sister but was dissuaded by my mom.  They had no plans on leaving their virtual game and hang out or go to the movies, so I felt like I would be wasting my time.  However, the dialogue there ended up being beneficial.  My brother might hate me.  I’m not sure.  Sometimes he can be tricky, but I devoutly believe that deep down, he has a heart of gold.  My sister only resents me.  I can work with that.  Surprisingly, they were both nice and even somewhat conversational.  They paint quite a different picture than the one my mother tells.  My brother tells me he didn’t really want to go to graduate school, but that my mother wouldn’t stop haranguing him about it, so he decided to goad her with financial obligations.  He’s not opposed to going to graduate school because that would be 4 years of sitting on his ass all over again, but this is not something he demanded as a personal goal.  He has his sights on being an FDA inspector.  Low pay, but excellent benefits.  Living expenses are pretty much accounted for as well.  What a great deal, eh?  My mom told me she wants my sister to have a job, any kind of job, even one at a fast food chain.  I told my mom disdainfully that even I would never consider such an option.  I related the same to my sister.  She tells me that my mom doesn’t pay for anything but tuition anyway, so where’s the pressing need?  Indeed!  After conversing with them, I have no idea what my mom has up her ass.  They seem like they’re doing fine and dandy, except for the resentment they have towards the maternal figure.  It seems they don’t call her anymore because she has neverending litany of complaints.  I could see that.  I don’t like calling her because she’s always complaining about my sister and brother or somehow I end up getting in trouble for some contrived error I’ve unwittingly committed.    After 3-4 hours of watching them play their video games/talking to them, I headed back over to my mom’s.  She and Adrian were watching TV on her bed.  I sat by her side and recounted my visit.  Basically, I told her that they seemed to be getting along fine and that I didn't think my intervention was necessary.  I told her that I thought they would do quite well in their respective futures.  She was not pleased with this info.  Somehow the discussion got on a tangent about how could I think that video games were ok and how I never had the patience for such a thing when we were living together and that they’ve given her so much heartache, etc.  When the heartache word spewed out of her mouth, I took that as my cue to leave the room.  I went to the bathroom to get ready for dinner and wipe my eyes.  I too have resentment, and it comes out when she audaciously laments on the wrongs people (namely her kids) have committed against her.    I suspect birth control makes me emotionally unstable at times.  This is evident in the times when my ability to stop the flood of tears and color that rushes to my face are somewhat compromised.  I never thought I’d be this way.  Damn the hormones.    It pisses me off that she would dare speak of heartache.  I firmly believe that she is no position to make such a complaint within my hearing.    We went to dinner, but she was as cold as ever.  She even tried to pick an argument with me by condemning my passing belief that Peterson was guilty.  On occasion she forgot herself and laughed, but that was rare.  She abstained from eating and for the most part from dialogue.  The prim manner in which she tightened her lips and the scornful scrutiny with which she directed at me really pissed me off.  I managed to maintain my composure.  That night, I took a long bath.    Two sleeping pills later, my mom came to pay me a hazy visit.  How tasteless.  She managed to retain her aforementioned demeanor as well.  We got into a tortuously time-consuming argument.  She mentioned something I had said earlier that probably hurt her.  Some years ago, I told her that the saying that with absence, the heart grows fonder and that our relationship was more stable with infrequent visits.  This is the truth.  I miss her and love her, but she is poison to me.  I can never give her what she desires.  In anger, she will throw this back at me, but add in that she would like to make the absences very long.  I told her I rarely see her as it is and berated her for her childish words.  I told her I spoke the words out of honesty, but that her motives for speaking the words were out of anger and with the motive to hurt.  I could not condone such a thing, but if she were adamantly possessed by the notion, that I could not stop her.  I asked her what her motive was in telling me such a thing and that it seemed if she had made up her mind, that she should not tell me and just to do it; otherwise her motives are obviously maligned.  She started going on tangents again and started speaking of my father.  I don’t even know how he came up and asked her.  She said that he doesn’t have to hear from us and that we should complain to him and ask him for stuff.  I asked her when was the last time I asked anything of her or complained to her.  She envies our relationship with him.  It is nonexistent.  I told her if she behaved towards us the way he does that she would have no problem cultivating a relationship with us similar to the one we have with him.  She said he was a smart man.  She is a stupid woman.  I told her she should be happy her kids are as stable as they are relatively speaking to their past.  I have no patience for her crap.    She left after a lot more exchange, and I spent the rest of the night watching anime.  I love the cartoon network.    Sunday, Adrian asked if I would be interested in joining him for breakfast.  But of course!  I can never turn down food.    We had an interesting discussion.  She hasn’t changed at all (it’s a good thing that I live far away from her).  She still cries for attention and help.  I cannot be of service.  We cannot be of service.  I believe she’s done a great job of burning us all.  He tells me that she speaks of taking her life or disappearing or never wanting to have been born.  You can never be sure if she’s speaking in a figurative sense, but the meaning is the same.  It is to find a conduit of escape from her present situation.  I won’t tell my sister and brother about this, but I find it troubling nonetheless.  They would only have more ammunition to throw at her.  The temptation is great, but I would like Adrian to have a better chance at making a relationship with my mother stick.  She’s a sorry case, but she will not hurt me again.  I would be happier for her when she finds peace.    I was surprised to find that she still speaks to Joe.  Interesting.    Sunday, I got home early but spent the rest of the evening putting things away and lifting some weights.  My arms are sore today.    Work is ok.  I’m rendering…

      Work is boring again.  However, I’m reassured in that I am not the only restless employee here.  Rumor is that budget for exhibits has been compromised because of this VIP initiative.  It’s nice to put a cause to the monotonous days.  Recap from the past weekend.   San Francisco was great!  It was great seeing Ryan.  He was as sweet as ever and reminded me of all the reasons why I like him and get annoyed by him.  I did arrive sick and left in physically compromised, but it was worth it.  Friday night, I arrived fairly late.  We grabbed a late dinner and spent the rest of the night glued to the tube.  It was nice to have a bed to collapse on.  Considerate Ryan even washed the sheets and scrubbed the bathroom floors for me!  Awww.  Friday was spent on Haight-Ashbury.  We got a lot of shopping accomplished.  To my credit, I spent less than $100.  We did a big club thing that night.  I wasn’t impressed; it was way packed.  Saturday, same thing.  However, we ended up going to some kind of multimedia/dance party.  Interesting bash.  It had a lot of hippies.  I danced my ass off on both nights to breaks, dub, house, and a little goa.  I didn’t spy me any good dancers, but I did spot someone that looked like Micah.  On Sunday, I met Christine.  She’s nice and perfect for Ryan.    She brings out a part of Ryan I thought he’d grown out of.  I’m glad I was just visiting.  I’d forgotten how sensitive the boy can be.  To sum up the trip.  If I moved to san fran, I would not live with Ryan.  Bryce was nice, but I couldn’t live with him either.  I had a nice visit and am good for a couple of years.  Yay!  Marcus caught my cold.  He likes it when I take care of him.  I like feeling needed, but I think I should stop spending time with him when I get back.  I really need to focus on my studies.    I’m going to visit my mom.  She’s got too many issues.  I had a talk to her yesterday and she was commenting on how there was a dental school close to d.c.  I knew that and told her that I had mentioned applying.  She’d apparently forgotten.  I told her I’d be able to spend more time with her if I went to school there.  She coyly asked if I would want that (I find coyness highly irritating).  Of course I would (but probably not in large doses).  I’m glad to be visiting with her this weekend and brought loads of laundry and some books to study.  She enjoys knowing that I study.  This is good.  It gives her less of a chance to start up a line of conversation that could potentially lead into an argument.    Recently, this anonymous blog came to my attention.  The author claims to be some Hollywood A-lister.  I was reading though the comments and some guy goes off and says just remember where you came or don’t forget yourself or something.  Sometimes that comment bugs me.  Although I do see the good intent behind that bit of advice, I think it’s awfully presumptuous to make such a comment.  The problem with that comment is that where you are now, is probably who you are or at least a facet of who you are and that you have no idea of knowing that what you were and what you are is right or wrong.  When one acquires fame or wealth, who’s to say that the person they become isn’t the person they were meant to be?  The person they grew to be?  Who’s to say that they hadn’t acquired wisdom in their endeavors and unfortunately turned jaded and corrupt?  Who’s to say that this corruption is so terribly wrong?  It nettles me when strangers have the gall to dictate the direction of one’s personal growth.  Anyway, the blog’s author sounded mature and level-headed.

      Things have been going to well between Marcus and me, but the relationship between the salon and Marcus has been deteriorating rapidly.  Over the last couple of months, I have been sensing a steadily increasing intolerance for the politics involved.  It’s given me some reason for concern.    Marcus has been staying here for me and to save up money for a move elsewhere.  Recently, he went to the North American Hair Stylist Awards.  He came back inspired and even wrote a page on his appreciation for the artistry in the nature that surrounds us.  He had mentioned meeting Aveda people at this show and that they knew of many openings in salons on the west coast.  He must have left a strong impression with them, because a job offer got thrown his way.  I would be in tears for awhile if he left, but I know this is something he probably needs to pursue.  It makes me sad.  Last night I had a dream about Gav.  His name on the caller ID was Gavin Nihease (I can’t be positive about the spelling).  He called me right after I decided not to call him.  In my dream, he was married or engaged, but occasionally thought of me.  I missed him so much in my dream.  Somehow, he happened to teleport through the cell phone into the room I was in.  He looked so different.  Physically, he had aged much and had a mildly bitter demeanor, but when he looked at me, there was still something in his eyes that held mine.  Somehow his significant other popped in through the lines as well.  She knew who I was, but that was about it.  In retrospect, she wasn’t anything like I had imagined.  This girl was white with blonde highlights.  She still had a bit of her youthful exuberance probably perpetuated by this free spirited hippy evident in her personality.  I liked her.  My dream was spent hanging out with her.  Some drama came up, but I can’t recall it.  The thing I remember the most was that I wanted someone like her to be happy and that obviously Gav made her that way.  In my dream, I decided to leave things alone and send them back to their own place (there was a problem with how this was going to perspire, but details, details).  I woke up to a gloomy sky.    I will probably always thing about Gav because he was a great read, but he’s long gone.  It’s futile to think of what could have been.    I’m trying to convince myself that I will be fine without Marcus as well.  It’s hard, but I can’t stop the inevitable.  He was the best first I could have asked for.

      It’s incredulous that I used feel apathetic towards the Cure.  Any fan must be a romantic at heart.  Lyrics aren’t my thing, but you can’t help but catch a few.  His voices bleeds with sorrow and pain.  Damn.    On another note, I had the most troubling dream last night.  I was looking for something with a friend of mine.  We’d been drinking gin and tonics and smoking some cloves.  He opened the patio door.  The deck led out onto a grassy knoll.  The house was a mansion and there was a party going on, but we were hanging out at a sparsely populated section of the house.  We decided to venture out into the yard, and we did the nasty.  The next morning, I lost all recollection of this event, but my friend looked at me oddly.  He tried to give me a comforting pat and said that we were still friends.  I remember continuing my quest for whatever it was I was looking for, but everywhere I went, people were snickering or giving me these odd looks.  His ex girlfriend (but in my dream they were still together) coldly ignored me.  Her friend informed me of the enormous resentment she held for me.  I couldn’t understand it.  Finally, I went to see my friend Leo.  He told me that I was a naughty girl and that he didn’t know I had it in me.  Shocking!  He said everyone had been talking.  I denied any knowledge, but tried to dig through the files of my memory to get a better idea.  All the sudden it came to me in flashes all that had gone down on the lawn.  Evidently, I put on quite a show.  I was mortified.  I knew Marcus would be so angry with me.  I couldn’t believe that the second guy I slept with would be this friend. Lucky me it was just a dream.    I think I had this dream b/c I lied to Marcus.  A little lie that I forgot about until I gave it more thought.  I had a drag of a cig on Friday night.  It was a little one, but I was drunk when I smoked it.  The next day he asked me if I smoked, and I said no of course not.  However, a couple of minutes later when I went to take my shower, I was going through the previous nights events, and I remember some guy gave me a drag.  Oops…  I’m going to L.A. this Friday.  Yay
