      Everynight he comes. Hes always here for about 3hrs atleast. Sometimes he comes and stays untill we begin to lock the doors for the night. He comes dressed in the same style each time, tshirt jeans and work boots. Sometimes his boots are caked in red Alabama clay, pants coated in a thin layer of grime. Other times hes freshly showered , but his hair is always distraught. One can always find him in the same section, although he sits in one of two places. Sometimes sitting in the floor in front of the manga, other times sitting in the squishy grey arm chairs. I like to make up stories about him , what he does, where he lives, why he comes here. Tonight hes a construction worker. He comes to look at the manga hidden from his rough hewn constuction buddies. They wouldnt understand his love of manga, so he keeps hidden in a bookstore, a place where they wont likely be browseing. And so he sits for hours enjoying his secret, guilty pleasure.

So much to do so little time :P Not too much going on other than work and Dave. Well I keep looking at tattoos but prob not going to get one. Im too indecisive. I did however decide on kids names.

      Being me wasn't good enough so I slid on my chameleon suit expert at the art of disguise until I even had myself fooled. I wandered life looking for me until I was alone. Then I found my pieces lying all alone. I picked them up and held them close vowing to never again lose me and yet losing me seemed the only way to be loved, until I met you. I cast my chameleon suit aside , you allowed me to be real, to not be afraid of who or what I Was. No more hiding behind that suit no losing me to gain you. You take all of me good and bad. I know your my true love for my heart sings. Im free of the masks I once used, the lock I kept on my heart is gone. I feel my soul my essence call for you pull towards you. You love without condition, you love me as I am. You are my soulmate, for you I was born.

Though what&apos;s funny is I woke up around 7 and I looked at the clock and thought it said 1:00 because I didn&apos;t have my glasses on, so I&apos;m running around trying to get dressed and ready for my 2:30 when I finally looked at another clock and realized it was 7:00 Dark Geeky Femme Fatale says: lol awwwwww Dark Geeky Femme Fatale says: my blind baby lol The One Dave says: Hehehehe.

Dark Geeky Femme Fatale says: he is so embarrasing too The One Dave says: We&apos;ll be driving in South Norwalk, aka &apos;the ghetto&apos;, and I&apos;ll lock the doors if they&apos;re not locked and he&apos;ll be like "you&apos;re such a racist" and I&apos;m like "I&apos;m a white person with a post-2000 year car in a neighborhood full of black and hispanic people where there&apos;s known gang and drug activity that gets reported in the paper EVERY DAY... of course I&apos;m going to be cautious!"

Dark Geeky Femme Fatale says: but I have a not too shabby 1998 Taurus station wagon one of the smaller ones Dark Geeky Femme Fatale says: I cannot believe you have a beattle The One Dave says: That&apos;s almost scary coincidence!

      Working at a bookstore can bring in some interesting debates. Fathers Day is approaching which means it was time to get the "Action Alley* (center walk through) ready by putting out the Fathers Day merchandise and setting up the gift tables. Well the books on these tables range from grilling, to motorbikes, to golfing. On the very front table as you walk in is the main Fathers Day table. This table is the first thing you see when you walk into the store, and on this table is the 50th anniversary Playboy Photo Book. A few of my religious coworkers were quite pissed about this. Not just because it was playboy but because it was accessible to children, and they felt it had no place on the table. I in turn argued that it is considered an art book. They disagreed completely. I argued that photography is an art form, what is or isn't art is to each individuals perception, and everything is relative. I also pointed out that kids could see more than what was in the book if they went to our unrestricted sexuality section filled with how to guides completely illustrated with photos of people trying out the positions. I want to hear what you guys think! Comment and lemme know how you fill. Should this book be displayed? Why or Why Not?  To be continued........

      When one is a very tall dame it can be very hard to find a guy. Im 6ft 1 and havent been able to wear heels with any men I have ever dated. So youd think the height would make it hard but there is more. Im pretty darn intelligent, and I like men that are intelligent. I think its where I live but intelligent men seem to be far and few between. When I do find one they are either way short or taken such is my luck. I was beginning to think the kinda kat Im looking for didnt exsist, but then as the fates have it they must prove me wrong. I have found the Geeky Nerd man of my dreams! Hes 6ft 10! he wears a size 18 shoe! An 18! Hes super intelligent and very sexy! I tell ya! Dave where have ya been all my life! He has the greatest voice, he loves japanese food, he lives in the North, he loves anime, he loves kung fu movies, he knows lines from The Revenge of the Nerds, this guy is freaking awesome! I adore him! So heres a shout out to Dave one sexy nummy man geek! I heart you!
