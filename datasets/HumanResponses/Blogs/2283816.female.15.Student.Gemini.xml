       Glinda sat on a stool in her room, sadly applying eyeliner. A small tear fell from her eye, and she muttered something as the violet smeared. Great Oz, she looked like a boxer now. No way to greet the people.   Why had things turned out the way they did?  She heard her window open, and then shut with a slam. Cautiously she peered into the mirror. It was Elphaba.  “ELPHIE!!” she cried, running to her and giving her a huge hug. “What in the world?”  “Lots of things, really,” Elphaba said. “First of all, the shoes. Sweetie, where the hell are my shoes?”  Glinda released her and squirmed nervously. “Well… Dorothy had them last”-  - “Yes, I know that,” the Witch said patiently.   “And then… erm… uh… we’re all pretty sure they got lost in the desert on her way back.” Glinda braced herself.   The Witch looked at her pleasantly. “Well, I’m sure you’ve already hired a team of trained professionals to go find them, haven’t you?”  Glinda took out a small cell phone and dialed. The Witch nodded and raised her eyes to the ceiling. She waited until Glinda finished her phone call. Then the Witch was gone, and Elphaba returned. “Next,” she said, “Fiyero is still alive.”  Glinda wasn’t entirely sure how to react to this news. “I’m … I’m happy for you,” she finally said softly.   “He’s a scarecrow.”  Glinda stared at her. “Oh, honey…”  “The last thing – what did you do with my bottle of green elixir and why do you want it?”  Glinda again looked uncomfortable. She could only whisper it into Elphaba’s ear.  “HOLY SHIT!! ARE YOU SERIOUS!?!?”  Glinda nodded.  Elphaba stormed around the room in utter disgust. “This is unbelievable,” she muttered. “Freaking unbelievable.” She looked up at Glinda. “Why did you take it?”  “I just wanted to see… see if it really was true… it was.”  “Do me a favor and don’t mention it again… ever… okay? That despicable piece of…” She continued to storm around. Glinda watched her friend burn off the steam. Then Elphaba turned around and began to cry.   Glinda put a comforting arm around her shoulders. “Elphie, calm down. You’ve had a rough day.”  Elphaba glared at her. “Oh, a rough day? What about a rough LIFE, Glinda, did that occur to you?” She sobbed some more, dabbing her eyes with a handkerchief to avoid her watery tears.  “Just… think about Fiyero.” Glinda was surprised at herself. She didn’t think she had it in her to be compassionate about it. But here she was.  Elphaba’s sobbing began to subside. “You’re absolutely right – I’m wasting my time standing here crying. Go, Glinda. Go tell the people about me. You’ll be late. I have to get going – come back to my castle after you’ve finished.” She headed for the window. She turned one last time. “And you might want to fix your eyeliner.”

        Elphaba leaped out the window and headed back into the sky. She took one last look at Glinda standing in the window waving. Elphaba smirked. She only muttered stuff to herself all the way back to Kiamo Ko. There she landed back into her bedroom trying hard not to knock anything around with her broom. Evil. That's all she could think about. Evil Glinda! She marched her way down to the kitchen for a snack. Chistery was sleeping on the counter. Elphaba moved her way over and shook him. "Get up! Get up you lazy ass." Elphaba roared.   Chistery, startled, flew up and hit the ceiling. He glided down and stood my Elphaba.They moved there way from the ice box to the oven looking for food. Elphaba found some bread and broke a piece off for Chistery and herself. They headed back upstairs. Half way up the spiral steps they met Fiyero. Elphaba stopped. Fiyero stared her down. He looked into her dark hazel eyes. He thought back when he was at the window watching the Witch on her broomstick. He moved closer and finally came in with a kiss. His fabricated lips tore and he withdrew in pain."Yero my hero. Let me fix you up." Elphaba said.  She went ahead and pulled him up the stairs being ever so careful not to tear his hands. They moved with grace. As if floating on a cloud. Opening the door to her room Elphie went to the cabnet and took out liquids, herbs, dust, and of course the Grimmery.  Glinda adding the final touch of rouge to her cheekbones stood up and posed. She looked herself down. Today she was in a Quox blue attire. A skirt with flowers stiched at the bottom for a lace. She pulled at her vest with shoulder bells brushing up against her curly hair.Finally, she slanted her hat at the brim and puffed up the feather that hanged in the back. She put on a smile and grabbed her papers. She headed out into a long hall covered in green drapery and pictures of great Ozians from the past. Glinda stopped at a bust of the Wizard. She puckered up her lips. Wonderful Wizard my ass. She flipped her hair and made her way to a great balcony. As she came out of the shadows a loud cheer shook the city. Glinda could only smile and wave. She blew kisses to the younger boys that we're standing on the bases of the city street lights. They could only blush. After calming the crowd Glinda cleared her throat. She closed her eyes and began. "Fellow Ozians. It is a great honor of mine to tell you all that....that the Wicked Witch of the West at last is dead. Dorothy, the girl who fell from the sky, liquified her. And the Wizard himself has claimed of her death as positive. We shall honor Dorothy in The Great Hall of Ozians. But, please we should not celebrate this day, but mourn for the Witch did not know what she was doing. She did not choose her wickedness. Ozians, spread this good news throughout the land. I bid you a wonderful day and may the Unnamed God bless you all. Thank you."  The crowed cheered. Glinda bowed and went back down the hallway. Several munchkins greeted her and talked of a celebration for the Witch's death. Glinda only smiled. She nodded her head and hurried back into her room. She undid her vest and pulled off her skirt leaving her only in her white underwear. She pulled open two dark wooden doors and searched through a pile of hanging shirts, vest, skirts, hats. What should I wear to Elphie's she thought. Glinda, of course, being the proper girl she is always wanted to fit right along with the theme of the party. She found a bark colored skirt and slipped it on. She finally found a matching suit and a belt with a white flowed as a buckle. She slipped quickly into the outfit and pulled back her hair. She added a smoking eye shadow with just hint of glitter. She was ready to talk to her long time friend. She sat up in excitment and head out into the hallway. She made her way down a marble staircase. Then out a dark green door. She entered a room a pink book right in the middle resting on a stand. She opened it at came to a page. "Transportation," she read outloud,"Quox leaves and Owel leather make my weight as light as a feather."   Glinda floated up into the air and a bubble formed around her. She drifted off into an opening in the ceiling. She was off to see the Witch.

        "I'm melting! Melting! Oh what a cruel world! How could a little girl like you destroy my beautiful wickedness?," Elphaba recited.                   She headed deeper and deeper into the floor until she could feel her feet touch the hay barrels that layed under her. Slowly she kneeled on them ever so carefully not to make a noise. Finally, Elphaba, was under the floor boards. She could only see little specks of light through the holes. Peering up in one she could see the little girl. Fools she thought. Her plan had worked perfeclty. One of the Winkie guards handed the girl her broomstick. Elphaba unaware of what was going on stretched her ear to the hole. "Oh, thank you so much!   Now we can go back to the Wizard and tell him the Wicked Witch is dead," the girl cried. Elphaba wanted to laugh at the girl's foolishness. They all left in a matter of moments. Elphaba waited. Alls she could do was wait. She looked around the room. Barrels of hay, cobwebs, and the moist air surrouned her. She was tired from the chasing and the plotting and slowly drifted off into a deep sleep.  Her eyes opened and saw a man of straw peering down at her. She raised herself with her her elbows and held at her hand. The Scarecrow raised her up out of a small trap door that she had slipped through. "Are they all gone?", Elphaba said brushing the hay and dust of her black outfit.  "Yes, the girl is back home. Glinda helped her-", the Scarecrow started.  "All good, but what about the shoes?"  "Well, the shoes," the Scarecrow said, "I think Glinda took. She also took your bottle of elixer. Don't ask me why."  Elphaba stared out a window onto the dark mountains. Her teeth grinding against one another. Her face started to turn black due to the color of red from her anger and the green from her skin. She looked back down onto the trap door and picked up her hat. She brushed it off and placed it tight on her head. "Where is my broom?" Elphaba said.  The Scarecrow ran out of the room and came back with her broom. He handed it to her with shaking hands. Elphaba yanked it from his slowness, mounted it, and leaped out the window into the foggy sky. The Scarecrow rushed towards the window and looked out. Elphaba was hovering in the air.  "I will be back soon. I told you I want my shoes and now with that brat out of the way I can get them. I am heading back to the Emerald City to speak with Glinda.", Elphaba roared, "Don't worry I will find a way to turn you back to yourself. Goodbye Fiyero, my love."  And with that she blew him a kiss and raced into the sky dissapering into a black cloud.

      Went to Debrand's with B, Hill, and Michael today - fun stuff there. I got a Creamy Hot Caramel drink and it was soooo incredibly awesome!! We were gonna see Master and Commander - ya know, the Russel Crowe one? Yeah, sold out. Of course. A Friday afternoon and it's SOLD OUT. :P   Which was :P but Debrands is always cool. One of those places where they fill up your water glass every five seconds.   I'm reading  The Book of Spies , an anthology of spy stories. It actually looks to be pretty good, and I hope it fills my Alias void. At least for a little while. Because two weeks is a very very long time.  I'm going to miss Elliot and Kelsey in art!! It's over and now I can't eagerly discuss Alias every other day. I have to remember to watch 24 again, that was pretty cool. The OC is horrifically bad. Really. That Ryan guy is actually pretty cute, but otherwise the show is ew. DAVID ANDERS ROCKS!!!!!!!! MWAH!!!!!!!!!!!!   And we must do Fiddler on the Roof for play! Because Victor Garber's gonna be in the TV version and he ROCKS. And DA tried out too, don't know yet if he made it. Must Google some more.  I'm off to see if Regina's recapped yet - cya later, all!

      My first blog post! Mwah! :) And I'm all excited.   ME: My pen name is the strangely fitting name of Christina Saturday. The Saturday stuck during a particularly uninteresting homily on Friday, during which I was subconciously thinking about Saturday and WHY HASN'T IT COME YET. I needed an S! And it stuck! My real name, however, is Laura, which I do like - I just needed a change.   Blahbety BLAH... I love the idea of this blog thing. Unfortunately not much interesting stuff has happened today - I'm about ready to read Best Enemies by serenity sea - really good stuff there. And Alias last night??? So. Freaking. Awesome. And you know? If the angry mob of S/Vers covince JJ and Company to break up Lauren and Vaughn - I'm all for the Lark. Truly. That would be so awesome.   And here is the end of my first blog post - I'll look back and laugh. :)

      So I freakin' have to do my science project and I DON'T WANNA. I HATE SCIENCE AND THERE IS NOTHING ANYONE CAN DO ABOUT IT. Really, Mr. C should stop wasting his (precious? doubt it) time trying to make me interested. It ain't happenin. Nada.   So what happened today? Lotsa stuff I don't want posted all over the Internet. And I have to leave now. Ummmghhf, I'll think of something relatively fascinating when I return.

      Back from church! Kudos to Mike and all of you other people with solos. You got GUTS. Nice job.  Alias is on in 2 1/2 hours .... I am bursting with excitement - and the temptation to put off geometric means just a bit longer. I have better things to do, thank you.    ANYWAY. I was listening to this FAB FAB song I've been literally in love with since I was six. It's called "Shut Up and Kiss Me" by the wonderful Mary Chapin Carpenter. Take a read, find the song, and show it to your guy. :-)  _______________________________________________________ Don't mean to get a little forward with you, don't mean to get ahead of where we are Don't mean to act a little nervous around you, I'm just a little nervous about my heart 'cause It's been awhile since I felt this feeling that everything that you do gives me It's been so long since somebody whispered Shut up and kiss me Didn't expect to be in this position, didn't expect to have to rise above My reputation for cynicism, I've been a jaded lady when it comes to love but Oh baby just to feel this feeling that everything that you do gives me It's been too long since somebody whispered Shut up and kiss me  There's something about the silent type attracting me to you All business baby none of the hype That no talker can live up to  Come closer baby I can't hear you, just another whisper if you please Don't worry 'bout the details darlin', you've got the kind of mind I love to read Talk is cheap and baby time's expensive, so why waste another minute more Life's too short to be so apprehensive, love's as much the symptom darlin' as the cure Oh baby when I feel this feeling, it's like genuine voodoo hits me It's been too long since somebody whispered... Oh baby I can feel this feeling that everything that you do gives me It's been too long since somebody whispered Shut up and kiss me Shut up and kiss me     I love it, I tell ya. I had good taste at the tender age of six. Mom is making pizza. Whee. Bye, y'all.

      I changed my pen name - it's Christina Simon now. But I'm keeping the Saturday Style because I like the sound. And alliteration is fun. Anyway - went to library and now have ALIAS BOOK!!!!!!! WHEEE!!! And it's on for the first time in like a month tonight.   I should probably do homework, but I honestly don't. really. want. to....   If someone's life strikes them as interesting, please email me and explain. I want tips.   Brandon's Conquest of the World is now OVER. If someone would like a copy, again, email me. Or it'll be posted on my site when I get bored enough. Also, if you are interested in being in the actual PRODUCTION of BCotW... you know what to do. Contact me, Brandon, Hillary, or Michael. We aren't writing anymore, so don't waste the little brainpower you have in your skulls to beg us to. Although we accept bribes - even if there's nothing in it for you.   Alas, alas, (Legolas's first line in FotR, hee) my story is not done. MY title-less story. I'll just lament about this to myself while I go to church and listen to some lovely singing voices. Ta.

      Hi, Brandon! Hi, Ramon! I'm sitting in computer class now, typing in my blog out of lack of anything better to do. I don't like you reading over my shoulder, Brandon. Stop. Kopele. Hi, ramon! LAAAAAA!!!  You are ... ?  I'm drawing a complete blank here. I could be like Kevin and blow things up, but I'm not in a destructive mood. Yet. *thinks*   I need a bomb.   *runs out to store*  *returns with large, twenty-pound daisy cutter*  Ahh, much better. What shall I destroy?  I could blow up the computer lab! Hah!   Of course, that idea was all mine, not Brandon's. Brandon had no part in that last brilliant idea. The credit is all mine. Mine, mine, mine. I have a broken arm in Jessie's Oregon Trail game.   WOW, I'm bored. Loooo. I'm going to Yahoo o see if I can watch la videos musica. Farewell.

      Listening to "Breathe" by Michelle Branch and wallowing in self-pity. Do I have to put the damn declaration on my site? For once I can think of nothing to say. I think I'll find a new website to love and show it to people.

      I am so nervous. It's like I'm afraid to finish typing up my story, because then everyone will read it. The reason I've kept it inside so long is this: I didn't want it marred by other people. I wanted it to be all me. I did not want the influence of anyone else on it.  If I DO get it to a publisher, I'll likely have to extend it. :( This will be a project, and I've already extended it till I couldn't extend it anymore. I didn't want to have more.   I am so afraid. It's like I'm truly opening my soul up - this is my ideal story. This story would be the one in the library that would catch my interest and be what I would want to read. It's very near and dear to my heart right now. And if it's hated, I will feel horrible.  But I would like honesty. Honest opinions will help.   Sark is sexy. Bad writing is not. I would be a more believable Lauren Reed than Melissa-Ego-George.  *sighs sadly* Alias... come back to meeee....well at least next week we get the comforts of Sexy MenOnAPlane! *grins* Bye, y'all.

      For lit, I have to write a poem about To Kill a Mockingbird. I personally think this book is kickass, and I wanna do it justice. I'm thinking of writing about the relationship between Jem and Atticus. This is also kickass.  If anyone ever reads this, I'm spurning ideas off here. Want one? Credit me.   - Three-sided - Atticus, Scout, and Jem. Family. - Aunt Alexandra voicing concerns on Scout and Jem. - Miss Caroline, voicing frustrations on Scout. - Miss Maudie, as she works in her garden. - Boo Radley, skirting throughout his house, watching Scout and Jem and Dill. - Dill, on how he's almost jealous of Scout and Jem. - Atticus, on protecting his children and Tom Robinson. - Tom Robinson, hearing the verdict of his trial. - Jem, about how he admires his father.   Oh, screw. Someday I'm going to write all these poems. I love these characters so. They're so rich and colorful and developed, and well-rounded, and brilliantly vibrant. I LOVE THEM. My entire soul loves them. I want to live in Maycomb.   That said, there are about fifty thousand other things I should be doing. I've memorized the bulk of my lines. I've scared Joe at least twice, with my overdramatic leg-grabbing. That's actually pretty damn fun, for those of you who have never grabbed Joe's legs before. *snickers* Oh, man. That is SO, so wrong. Damn mind. Too much time in the Sark Harem. They rub off on me, I tell ya.  The first person to tell me they've read this gets a bag of M&M's. No, I am not shitting you. LOL.   My life is so damn sad.   In other news, the new Lemony Snicket book, The _________, should be out soon. No, I do not remember the title. Hack into my email and tell me. I'm too damn lazy. And this "Happy Club" song is really annoying.  The Community Notebook is kind of like a Blog or a Live Journal, if you think about it. People come in and post, aka write, their thoughts, and others comment. Funny how it all comes out in the Chinese laundry. Ahh, much better. Suite from The Parent Trap. Much better.   I've been talking for a LONG time. I rarely ever write this much anywhere. M&Ms sound SO damn good to me right now. I want to run to the store and break all pretences of a Lenten resolution and just CHOW. I'm cold. It could be how I am sitting here in khakis, a sweatshirt and a tank top underneath, but you never know. Could be the house.  Alias is finally, finally on tomorrow. Blowback, that's what it's called. A Lark scene, and a scene with Sarkster saying "If you love her, you will put the gun down." I love the way he says it. So damn SEXY. Sark is synonymous with sexy. I swear to you. Okay. Goodbye for now, fair minions. You know you all work for me anyway.

      Okay, I have a quick political Republican-slanted rant to make.   Who. Really. Freaking. CARES. Whose fault it was.  ?!  Poor Bush. He's damned any way he goes. If he's done anything good for this country it'll be ignored because, "Oh, look what else he DIDN'T do?"   Did anyone hear a damn thing about Hillary Clinton's supposedly racist remark? Nope. If Bush had said it, they would be ALL OVER him. He opposes everything the morons love! Guess they just need a scapegoat - might as well blame Bush. He's a Republican, he's a cautious speaker, let's bash every damn word that comes out of his mouth! Let's devote copious amounts of paper from the trees and environment we SO DEARLY WANT TO SAVE and waste em on a man we hate and what comes out of his mouth!   You know what? If you hate someone (and I know this from experience) don't waste your time on them. If you hate Bush, make an effort for him to go down in history as the Millard Fillmore type, the one that nobody remembers.   There are plenty of things our conspiracy-seeking public cannot and will not ever know about. Perhaps Bush had other, more covert reasons going on, intel that will NEVER reach public ears... about why to invade Iraq. WE DON'T KNOW. I am not suggesting that we blindly trust our government, I'm saying -   "Give them a chance and give them a rest! They work their ASSES off for America every day, and in your hindsight, everything looks crystal clear. The fact is that 9-11 may have been one of those things that are destined to be, possibly a wake-up call to the rest of the world. Everything happens for a reason. 9-11 happened for a reason. If you would rather waste your time on a circle of endless blame game than the issues that really matter, like the environment and the economy, perhaps this country would be moving forward. Perhaps Bush would have a CHANCE to make a difference instead of defending his every action every second of his every day."  Please, America, look past this issue. I know you can't hear me, because I'm screaming in the dark.   Do I want a war in Iraq? Do I want my uncle over there risking his life? No. Not really. But if you hate the war, quit picketing outside the White House (because they sure as hell aren't listening to you) and support our troops. Concentrate on something else, something that REALLY matters. This country can only move forward if we are all UNITED, as our name states.   George Washington must have been an intelligent person, opposing political parties like he did. Talk about some unity. Hah.   I cannot ever see John Kerry as the leader of this country. He sounds like he hasn't got much of a backbone, bashing Bush as much as the next Democrat. Screw bashing him, screw bashing each other! I'm sick of the bashing! Respect and tolerate each other! Isn't THAT what this nation stands for? Unity, tolerance, liberty and justice for all?  Oh, and another thing. The Pledge. If you don't want your child saying two simple little words, just teach them not to say it, and be tolerant of a tradition in our country, and be tolerant of the majority of America that believes in a deity.   America today portrays itself as being such an atheist country, at least in our media, and I'm tired of that, too. Christians need to step forward as well, re-establish themselves as a strong, united people. And it's really simple, too. Teens can do it - don't give in to peer pressure. That's all.   Some quick political rant...

      Today I will attempt to give you a list of all my fears/strong aversions of various things. I pray that you will not use them against me.  SPIDERS: Loathe very much. I think, as Ron Weasley put it, it's the way they move. It all started when I was a young child in my grandmother's Columbia City residence. My dear cousin Britney, four years older than I, was a theatrical sort and one of my greatest influences growing up. I think this is where I learned to overdramatize practically everything. Anyway, there was a box of puppets she had brought over from her church, and we adored putting on puppet shows for our bored relatives.   Or at least, she did. She was normally all the voices. And characters. I just kind of sat and watched.   But there was one puppet she always threatened me with, whenever I did not pander to her every whim.   A large, black, fuzzy, long legged, many-eyed spider.   She waved it in my face and made hungry noises. I would scream and cry hysterically and leave the room and/or do whatever she wanted.   One time she locked me in her parents' master bedroom. She wouldn't let me out, either.  HORSES: I used to love these lovely creatures, until I went to Camp Logan and had a horse named Tucker. This horse seemed determined to give me a hard time. It stopped to pee, crap, eat, just stop for the hell of it, and buck at me, and try to throw me off, and walk the wrong way.  It was not fun.   This is the most likely reason why I detest these creatures today. Other than those damn pink unicorns.  GOATS!: I was about six when one of these brats climbed into MY red wagon and sat down and wouldn't move its ass. It took my father and a zoo keeper ten minutes at least to get the damn thing OUT!   Another thing that annoys me is the fact that every time I climb into that place one starts chewing on my shirt. I don't know if I spilled something on it, or I smell good/bad, or WHAT. But it's inevitable and I can't stand them. So there.  Yes, I went to the Zoo today. And it was cold.   Hmmm.  I intend to start a new page on my website.... it's a campaign idea of mine. You might want to check it out later in the day.  *sigh*

      THE STRESS BUS. A True Story. By Laura Lee.  Once upon a time, there was a relatively happy little girl named Laura Lee. She was not very little because she was nearly fifteen, but she wore pigtails a lot and those made her look younger.   Anyway, one day, Laura Lee's father came home from a two-day convention in a Faraway City. He came bearing many strange gifts, including several pens, a three-sided highlighter, an action figure of some kind, a triangular ruler, and a squishy yellow bus that said Downey Insurance on the top.   When the Siblings discovered these gifts on his person, they immediately pounced on him in the master bedroom and began ransacking the suitcase. Laura Lee came down after hearing the loud proclamations of "Ooooh!" and "Ahhh!". After gazing upon the items, Laura Lee's father told them to pick what they wanted and leave.   Laura Lee realized the potential this little yellow bus held for her. While she WAS a relatively happy little girl, she did have her Moments. This bus, it seemed to her, could be used to squeeze away copious amounts of stress. So she picked up the bus and several pens and was immediately trampled by Sibling Un.   "That's MINE!!" shrieked Sibling Un. "I picked it out BEFORE YOOOOOU came down here, I told Dad I was gonna get it!!"  "Too bad, I got it first, I HAD IT IN MY HANDS - GET OFF, GOD!!! You know, Dad's standing right here, did that occur to you??"  "IT'S MINE!! CLAIRE, GRAB IT!!!"  Sibling Deux made several attempts to grab it from Laura Lee but failed. Laura Lee raced upstairs to her computer, where she proceeded to hide her precious Stress Bus under her leg. Sibling Un came and threatened to do many things if she didn't reveal the location of the Bus. Laura Lee calmly refused.  As the two Siblings were getting ready for bed, Laura Lee snuck into her bedroom and hid the Bus under her track shorts in the dresser.   Sibling Un barged in and wanted to know where the Bus was again. Laura Lee lied and told her she'd thrown it behing the desk, knowing the desk held many nooks and would occupy this sibling for at least ten minutes. Sibling Un eventually came back, began to search the dresser, touched the Bus but missed it completely. Laura Lee hid her smirk.   To this day, the Stress Bus remains hidden, waiting for the day when Laura Lee snaps and needs to squeeze out a little of her anger. Sibling Un has apparently given up.  THE END.

      Hah! Anamaria (or Anamaria's father) has TRIUMPHED over adversity - that is, her computer not working. So she is back and ready to have one or more personalities write some jolly good things for you. Ummm - let's see.   : : topics of the day : :  ME AS A FAMILY PERSON. I must confess, I do not care if I raise a family or not. I am a rather career-driven person. And after watching that stupid National Geographic movie I am no more encouraged to enter this particular vocation. That is all.   OUR CONCERT: I think it went rather well. The choir had a good night and so did the advanced band. Also the intermediate band and the advanced strings. My, we are the interesting ones, aren't we? *smiles*  MY STRESS BUS: More on that tomorrow.  EVERYONE'S BLOG: I see everyone has abandoned theirs in my absence... I hope this isn't a continued trend, cause I like reading them.  Off to update my subprofile now... chao, my dearests.

      Let's see. I think I'm going to talk about a few things that have been bugging me/confusing me lately.  It's odd how there seem to be three worlds in our society - that of the adults, that of the teenagers, and that of the elementary school kids. Each of these three worlds, in their own ways, are identical. Several things that exist in both worlds:  1) Popularity contests. 2) Economic problems.  3) Social exclusion, racism, intolerance. 4) Relationships.  There are plenty more that I can't think of now. What bothers me is that each group successively looks down on the others. Adults look down on Teenagers and Kids. Teenagers look down on Kids. Kids look down on the younger children. I'm afraid of what the younger children are doing. But the point is, because adults have the age advantage and more experience, they get to make all the decisions... yet they continue to have the same problems that the other two groups have. I know several teenagers that could do a better job of running the UN than the current leaders...   I don't know. All I'm doing is confusing myself and saying things I'll later contradict myself on.   About relationships: In these three worlds, relationships seem to have the same significance. Yet adults and sometimes others in the groups look down on others in a lower group... because they don't believe Teenagers/Kids are capable of such emotions at their current age. They believe that T/K are too young to feel these emotions. I admit that in the past I, too, have been a skeptic, and I admit that I still am.   But I am a skeptic in the sense that I believe: it's very RARE for a T/K to feel these emotions at their age. Many times the emotion is not real - it is contrived; it is based off of what they have seen from their parents, or television, or books. But in some rare occasions, certain T/Ks have the maturity of mind to feel these emotions... just as though they were "adults." Sometimes although our experience, our education and our freedom is limited, we are still capable of feeling the strongest of emotions, and by that I mean love.  I believe in the CHANCE of love at fourteen. It's rare, it's hard to come by, but I believe in the chance.   There are some days when I feel like an "adult" already. This is one of them. I feel like I'll never find what I'm truly looking for at this time in my life... I know I'll have to wait. And being the impatient, impulsive girl that I am, this is going to be painful.   It's not always a contrivance.

      Because of a sudden Heaven-sent (Mass homily-induced) inspiration, I will now proudly present to you all:  THINGS I'VE LEARNED ABOUT ACTING (by Laura)  This essay is designed to let y'all know what I know (or think I know) about acting. I hope it proves useful to somebody. I will be using several examples from "Fiddler on the Roof" to illustrate just what I mean.  1) CHOOSING A CHARACTER. This is the first step, pre-audition. You have had two informational meetings about the play and learned what it's all about. It's now time to grab up a scriptbook and borrow it for a week, if possible. Read through it all several times. Look over the characters - see what the demands for the roles are. This is where you ask yourself - what are you capable of? Are you confident enough in yourself that you can sing a solo in front of 500 people? Are you capable of showing extreme emotion? Are you capable of putting yourself into character?   When I read the script for Fiddler, I was at first preparing to audition for Chava. I was confident that I could act the part and do a decent job. I was not so with Hodel - I didn't have enough faith in my singing voice to have a solo. Then I started thinking about Tzeitel. I realized that I had a lot of common traits with her - oldest child, a little bossy, worrier, willing to break tradition but not stray too far from it... the more I thought about it, the more obvious my choice became. I knew I would be believable.   It's also a good idea to practice your audition character's lines ahead of time, in case you have to read for them.   2) AUDITIONING. The most important things you can do are stay calm, focused, relaxed, and refrain from putting yourself down. If you don't have confidence in yourself (or act like you do, this IS acting, after all), the directors will not have confidence in you either. Just calm down and focus on what you have to do. Are you prepared?  Water and fruit are probably the best things for your voice - avoid candy or chips.   I watch the other performers. I tend to audition near the end rather than the beginning - I feel more comfortable that way. Watching other people helps you remember that we're all in the same boat. If you make a mistake, you definitely were not the only one.   When it's finally your turn, please - be honest about what you can do. If your intended part requires you to play a real drum solo and you have no rhythm, tell them... for the good of the cast and your own personal pride. Don't let them cast you as something you are not. And no excuses, buddy. We ALL got colds the day before we performed, yet we've ALL still gotta prove ourselves to these guys. Prove to them that WE CAN DO whatever they call on us to do, even if we have laryngitis. The show must go on, as must the audition.  If you can, go without a book for your audition song. It shows you've put practice into it. For more about singing, see the section on it. Speak loudly and clearly for your reading - just like you would onstage. Pour as much emotion as you can into those lines. You've got one chance to show the directors what you're capable of. And mistakes are okay. Just let them see that you can recover quickly, smile and go on like it never happened.   There's no need to hide the fact that you're nervous - we all know it. But do believe in yourself.  3) CASTING LIST. The casting list has been posted. You are Hodel. You are a villager. You are Tevye! Excited shrieks, shocked "HOLY - "s, whispers of "I'm your HUSBAND!!" and sad groans all fill your ears.   Say you landed the part of Golde. Congratulations! We're happy for ya. It's just ... well... we really wanted Golde, too. So we're jealous. But we're glad you got a good part. *sigh* Such are the toils of having a good part, eh? But be happy - you've reached your goal. Just make sure you don't hurt other people's feelings by gloating.   On the other hand, you could be a villager. We've all been there - HUGE disappointment. You worked so hard, you did the best you could, and apparently it wasn't good enough. It SUCKS.   Don't blame it on yourself. This just wasn't your year. Maybe there just wasn't a character that you clicked with. Maybe you're incredibly talented, but there are more people even better than you. For some reason, there wasn't enough room - but if you did your very best with your audition, it's out of your hands from there.   And there's no need to quit, either. The ensemble/chorus is judged on Broadway shows as well as the characters (read this in a review of Best Musical nominee Wicked). The ensemble is what can make or break a memorable show. Try writing a character bio for yourself. Maybe let other people in the chorus know what you're doing - they might do it, too. Then you can share them with each other when you're on break.   Make the most of the part you've got.  4) OFFSTAGE/AT HOME. Don't forget you're in a musical/play on your days off. Study in between classes, at home, before you go to bed... Practice your expressions in the mirror. Overdramatize your words. Have someone practice with you.  5) ONSTAGE/REHEARSAL. Listen to your directors, darlings. Learn to trust them, because most likely they know what they're doing in the long run. Follow direction to the utmost. Example: One rehearsal, I was instructed to grasp Joe (Tevye) by the legs and beg for him to call off my marriage to Lazar Wolf. Having mixed feelings, I went ahead with it. It was later deemed too dramatic and I was spared actually doing it during production.   And don't ask about the mixed feelings. I will ignore you and pretend you are not there.  Always wear some kind of expression. People standing blankly on the stage is not entertaining to the audience. It is probably not entertaining to you, either. Do something. Look occupied. React to what's going on around you. Sleepwalking is bad. Mrs. Pio's/Barbra Streisand's advice is to LISTEN. I hope you were there for that particular lecture. Learn the lines of your fellow actors - for cues, and also to help them out if they need it. If he or she forgets a line of your cue, you're going to have to be quick and rescue them.  Michael (Motel) and I had an important question for Mrs. Pio concerning the wedding. Why was personal contact basically forbidden? She explained (without getting mad) that that was just Jewish tradition - men and women were on opposite ends. If we had experimented with this on performance night, she would most certainly have been annoyed. Ask your director before you start changing their own stage directions.   Make sure you make it to most rehearsals. It shows you're committed and just kinda looks good.  6) SINGING. The most important thing about singing in a musical is to be emotionally perfect rather than technically perfect. You don't have to hit all the notes. You don't even have to sound that good. THIS IS NOT CHORAL SINGING. Sing like there's no tomorrow. Sing loud. Sing for your dear little village Anatevka that you've lived in all your life. Your voice will probably be lost in the mix anyway, so don't worry about sticking out.   Also, make sure your face matches the lyrics of the song. Singing about your dear dead cat with a smile on your face is just stupid.   To practice singing, I usually record myself. I drink water first, and then I find the Sound Recorder on my computer and practice. Hearing your voice in a different way is very helpful in picking out your mistakes, what you need to work on. If you play an instrument like piano and know it's in tune, tune yourself.   7) EVERYTHING ELSE. I should talk a little about those scenes where you just have to pour your heart and soul into it. I had to cry in Fiddler on the Roof - for days I tried to come up with something that I could use as a fuel to help me out, something that would make me sad. It wasn't until dress rehearsal that I found something. Think about change. Think about something that will change your life or an opportunity you will never have again, a memory or the inevitable that's left a huge impression on you. The bittersweetness of graduation - that was mine.   If you still find yourself unable to get the tears out, unavoidably you must fake it. Do it this way: let it out. Don't worry about your voice squeaking or sounding stupid - your character is upset and doesn't care, so why would you? Hold nothing back.   In fact, that goes for everything. HOLD NOTHING BACK. This is the stage! You put yourself onstage, you sign the CONTRACT to make a fool of yourself. If you don't, will the audience enjoy it? Will you enjoy it?   Take it seriously, but not too seriously. Love it. Love what you're doing. The stage is a wonderful place to be.

      I am PISSED OFF at my computer. It's being so STUPID AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO ABOUT IT!!!!! If you think you could possibly tell me what to do, I'd like to hear from you.   It alllll began last night, when I attempted to download the Most Popular Theme from themes.org.... Naturally I was unsuccessful. Then this message pops up... "Windows File Protection: Files that are required for Windows to run properly have been replaced by unrecognized versions. To maintain system stability, Windows must restore the original versions of these files. Insert your Windows XP Home Edition Service Pack 1 CD now." The theme is all messed up - the start bar is half silver, half the green, half old windows...and in a different font. I restarted the computer fifty million times and when I clicked on a button nothing loaded. When I tried to log on to my dad's account, it rebounded back to the main screen.   Right now, it's working moderately well, but the message is still up and I don't know where to look for the CD because my dad isn't home. *sighs deeply*

      Hah! I have had my blog longer than any of you! Hah! Ha ha! *clears throat* So I babysat tonight. Talaricos. Very nice children indeed.   George - Jumped on me a lot at first. Attempted to tackle me but was unsuccessful. Would not clean up his food mess until I created:  THE LIST.  Yes, teenagers of the world, I have a solution. THE LIST will solve all your problems. Simply grab a piece of paper and pencil. Proceed to make a list of all the bad deeds your client is committing. Inform them that their sins are being written on THE LIST and will be given to Parent to Deal With Accordingly When They Return. Just make sure they don't grab the list and try to rip it up. Then you have to make a new list. Anyway, once they know this, tell them that when they repent for these sins, they will be crossed off the list and never be spoken of again.   It works. It really does.  Alice: Good as usual. I experienced a first when she had a number two and wished to be assisted. I have never done this before. I probably did it incorrectly, too. Oh, well. *sigh* Oh - scenario.  LAURA: Um...so... you wanna do it? I mean... here.  ALICE: You don't know much about this, do you?  Sophie - I like her now... She likes to swing. And she likes popsicles and Monsters Inc. Speaking of. That movie brings a tear to my eye every time I watch it... it's so SAD and so good...   Yes, Sean, I know. CASABLANCA. I'll watch it this weekend. I really don't have the time tonight. I'm, um... being lazy. That takes time.   Amy's life sucks, and Amy wants to die, and Amy wanted to slit her wrists a couple days ago but couldn't find any sharp objects. The rest of the personalities were delighted with this, but Amy just wanted to cry. But she couldn't get the tears out... Amy wishes all men would quit trying to screw over her life. Amy is going out to a club and getting wasted.   In other news, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is probably doing quite well. I haven't checked in awhile and I don't plan on it.  One thing that bothers me is people who don't know when to leave well enough alone. If others don't like you, don't talk to them. Leave them alone and/or start a hate page.  I'm off to find a RENT page of the characters. Bye, y'all!

      Yes, um. So my story is completely typed now. And my editor (Katalin) is now in possession of it. And I am on the edge. And I am going to shoot some things if I don't find out what she thinks by tomrrow. Oh my Lord. I am getting nervous just talking about it.   In other news, I love my pretty new template. Alias isn't on this week. I went to Mass today. A seal died on the Arctic coast.   Paul has now sent me three Dashboard Confessional songs. They are not bad at all.   Wow, dude, I have nothing to say. I think I'll update y'all on the current state of my personalities. If this proves popular it will be a daily feature.   Regina: Lazing about. JJ: Looking bored. Tiffany: Knocked out with chloroform. Casey: Surfing the internet. Charlene: Setting fire to the convent. Marsha: Off shooting.  Jen: Complaining about how much leg hurts. Lolita: Hungover and playing with butterflies. Alicia: Tired from singing while home alone. Anamaria: Running the wheel and cursing. Laura Lee: Telling Regina to stop cursing at the butterflies. Amy: Prancing through the woods with rum and Inigo Montoya. Kula: Lazin with Regina.  CURRENT PROMINENT PERSONALITY: Kula.

      Well, I am now back from my little Indy trip and I'm going to type all the junk I wrote on the bus. Here goes:      7:2? AM.  Don't know the time because Amy's sister's head is in the way. Oh - 7:26. Listening to Ev and sitting by Jessie on the bus. Semi Preps are in front. I have my knee on the seat in order to annoy them. Didn't I tell everyone I would hole up in a corner and not speak to anyone?  Well, at least Jessie seems to understand the rule of NOT ASKING what I'm writing.  Just had a Strawberry Cheesecake jelly bean. OMG, it is good *savors* Chloe's laugh is gonna bug me this whole trip. GAH.  *is very bored* My Immortal is on and I think I'll turn on a musical. I'd rather not be depressed today. And at the rate it's taking to leave, I'll probably finish the CD.   *listens to Defying Gravity* mm... I wonder what Michael and Brandon are doing. It is now 7:35. They're probably hitting each other and taking pictures. *sigh* Co-ed buses would be so much fun. I really should have brought my book. That's why I'm writing so much; I have nothing better to do. Hey - maybe Luthe's grandma is late - that's why we're still sitting here. Otherwise we'll be under the careful dictatorship of Mrs. Pio! *smile* Whom I do like... YES!! &;38, we. are. moving!! uh oh... highway writing...not gonna be good.  *Idina reaches climax of song. I stop babbling to listen. Thank Goodness comes on, and I proceed babbling.* I think I needed that break. My hand is going to be smashed. *sigh* I haven't done this in awhile, it seems. Write a lot in pencil. It's all on the computer *nowadays*.  Jessie just pointed out a weird smell. *shrug*  Weee couldn't be happier!  Anyway, my current book it "Beautiful as the Moon, Radiant as the Stars: An Anthology of Jewish Women in Yiddish Stories." The title says it all. Kristin Chen sings her operatic trills in the background*  I'm already on my fourth page. Geez.    7:45 AM.  All the people of Oz love Glinda! Whoo! *end* I could get sooo much reading done. I'll just occupy myself with writing. We are on Coliseum Blvd. I really am terrible with streets and the whole lot... I see a Snider baseball field out the window. How can you not like Wonderful just a little? Just for the cornfed hick line. And the "we call it history" line. Heh. I love it. *dance music for it*   I haven't been to Baskin Robbins in YEARS. *sings with Idina and Wizard*  Someone should just whisk me away now and take me to New York to see this play!!! I love "As Long As You're Mine" ... mmm... Idina's voice sounds good with everyone. "Just for this moment - as long as you're mine!"   I think when I'm done with whatever, I'll write a review of the CD for amazon.com or whoever.  1) No One Mourns the Wicked: (7) Nice, pretty overture, compilation of many of the songs. The cast comes in, singing about the death of the Witch. Glinda has a pretty, opera-riddled solo. This song is good, not good enough that I always listen to it. Glinda then goes on and explains Elphaba's birth/conception...her mother's green lover and her father's disownment after finding out she's green. Poor girl - but the citizens of Oz have no mercy, because "No one mourns the wicked!" The end of the song sounds just like the finale.   2) Dear Old Shiz: (4) Song is sung about the dear old sorcery college. I never listen to it. Doesn't make sense without seeing the musical.   3) The Wizard and I: (6) Even though I WORSHIP Idina's talent, I rarely listen to this song. It's pretty, but I enjoy others more, and this one gets lost. Elphaba sings about how she hopes the Wizard will team with her.  It's sad, because we she sings about her dreams - yet we know how THOSE turn out. And how she wants to be "degreenified." Here's where the "unlimited" line comes in first. Beautiful conclusion - IM's voice makes it worth it.  4) What Is This Feeling?: (8) G(a)linda and Elphaba discover they're roommates and clash immediately. It's hard to resist singing along, it's so good. The rest of the students don't like the green girl either and they join in singing... AWESOME.   5) Something Bad: (4) Again, I usually skip this one. It doesn't make any sense without the musical. Just proves Idina can harmonize with anybody.  6) Dancing Through Life: (7) Fiyero starts it off by inviting Galinda to the Ozdust Ballroom... Elphaba's little sister Nessa is set up with a munchkin boy, Boq, by Galinda. Galinda gives Elphaba her famous pointed hat. It's a nice, flowing song, that would make more sense in the musical. The dancing is probably great to watch. It's pretty long and I don't always listen.  7) Popular: (8.5) Galinda and Elphaba are friends by now, and Galinda decides Elphie's in need of a makeover. The resulting song is hilarious and addictive. Kristin Chen sounds great. She has great timing and will remind you completely of all the preps you knew in school.   8) I'm Not That Girl: (6.5) Everyoen can relate to this song in some way. Idina sounds packed with emotion, which only adds to its appeal. It's simple, so you either love it or hate it. I love it.  At this point, I will commence watching Finding Nemo.    8:49 AM.  Those Pixar People are so smart. Dory!! She reminds me so much of myself... short-term memory loss. *sigh* I love her. Oooomg, latte flavored jelly bean *SAVORS*  Sharks! With Alcoholics Anonymous! YAY!  We are now entering Gas City.   The Shark Scene is like, the BEST. Poor Bruce. Can't stand the pull of fish blood. ES-CAP-E!!!!!! I am SO naming a pet that someday. aww... poor Nemo in a dentist fishcage. Hee. My Bubbles. Bonjour. Hee, hee, hee. Voila, he is Clean. Auntie Flo! and Deb! Ah, rest area. We will see what goes on.   9:07 AM.  Jessie: Is that a log of our travel?   Anyway. I had a cookie courtesy of Megan! Thanks! I think my mom liked her thank you notes. I'll have to ask. The volume went down. Hm.   Rolling through the fields of What Indiana Is Famous For. *sigh* Branbo! Michaelangelooo... What are you doing?? Hillaree - I can see you but you're all the way in the back at a table and I can only wave. My vocals don't carry that far.   I'm kinda tired. I want to sleep a little - oh. Liz pulled the curtain down. I guess I can sleep. It's just sooooo bumpy. I'm having problems writing. Both of my knees are on her seat now. Maybe they put the curtains down so we wouldn't have to stare at the CORN. Grr. *curls up with Rent soundtrack to sleep*   10:03 AM.  Well, I didn't sleep, but I listened to Rent. There is no way I can memorize all these songs! Anybody with friends needs to hear Seasons of Love and Happy New Year, or at least read the lyrics. OMG. There was such a huge bump that the carpet thing fell off Abby's TV. Several people screamed. The cons of all-girl buses.   "You can take the girl out of Hicksville, but you can't take the Hicksville out of a girl..." Passing a little white house. PERSON: That's where Bob Ewell lives.  ME: Hahaha!  I am annoyed with myself. I only brought one battery. *tsk* Annnnd 10:16 AM, we roll into the Indiana State Musem. Idina wails. Goodbye!   1:27 PM.  *settles into seat with "What Is This Feeling?"* :) Loathing - there's a strange exhilaration. BOO! Ah! *boom*  Okay. Had a decent time, barely saw anything educational so the trip was rather wasted. And now I really, really, really don't want to go back to school. *Popular!* Can you imagine singing that song every day for WEEKS?? You'd really have to enjoy your job... Hmm...  Hillary - Glinda Laura - Elphaba Michael - Wizard Brandon - Fiyero  Because I am bored and will continue to be so. *Don't dream too far...*   Hey, it's the Princess Bride! I kinda like this movie and I wanna save my CD batteries. The song's over anyway.    2:00 PM.  Middle of Princess Bride. I can't decide on Boyfriend. Inigo or Wesley? Wesley reminds me so much of Sark, yet he's taken already. By Butterbitch. Inidgo is witty, swordfighter, yet he's taken by revenge. What's his career plan afterward, hm?  Maybe I'll kill Butterbitch. He'll see she's wrong for him... and then I can have Inigo on the side. I'll move to India, I think it's legal there. Oh, and Katie's (Araceli's) boyfriend is Vizzini. You know you want him, girl...Kill him, Wesley dear.  I decided. Boyfriend is Inigo, but Lover is Wesley. May they never meet again. There's nothing likeable about Butterbitch, darling! Drop her immediately! And darling? Never take that sexy black mask off.   *regains sanity*  The Prince needs to shut up. "Never wrong," my ass.  DARLING! YOU TOOK YOUR MASK OFF TO KISS BUTTERBITCH!! WHAT ARE YOU THINKING, YOU UNFAITHFUL LITTLE   *regains sanity*  Okaay, I am SO seeing New Kelly, because mobs/guns/hitmen/Heath/******* = Best. Film. Ever. Those casting agents knew what they were doing.   I personally think Cary Elwes is hotter when beaten up. It so works for him. My hair is bugging me - these little stray ends are ticling my eyes and face. What. Does. Wesley. See. In. Butterbitch. As far as I can tell, she has no redeeming qualities whatsoever.  Damn zodiac signs - it seems that no one is compatible with me. Aquarius and Libra are my best. I don't know many of those. But I have to find out what moon I was born under. Those supposedly make a difference. Sometimes I wonder if I'm a half-Scorpio. I mean, one side of me is all serious and the other is a complete spaz.   I think I want to sleep again.   Oh - did I mention I finished my epilogue this morning? And now I'm going to print it out and give it to Katie for Harsh Critiquement.   I wonder if there's such a thing as Group Blog where other people can post too. Will check on that. Because if so, I think I'll put Brandon's Conquest of the World in blog form. It'll be so much easier. I've got a craving for Wicked. Here we go...  Boyfriend is on the bottle again. Hee. He is so my boyfriend. Hillaree! I'm back in the Elite Club! I'm dating a Spanish rum-drinking swordfighter! We deserve each other... It's really amazing how much we have in common, eh?  "The wickedest witch there ever was, the enemy of all of us here in Oz, is dead! Good news!" What is Boyfriend doing? Oh. He's apparently being guided to the right direction by his sword. *green lover sings* :)  I go flying off the handle quite a lot and can't help it. Oh well. More corn. I ought to go back and sit by Hill, I'm bored up here now. WICKED!! I think all four of us brought this CD. *I hope you're happy too*  How many fantasy movies were made in the 80s? Geez.   I think I'll go back to Rent after Defying Gravity ends. Not very far now, but I'm going to crank it up and drown in it. Be right back.  That song is so genius. IM's ability to sound so strong and vulnerable at the same, and so desperate... I cried almost. And I was shivering. I wouldn't want to be anyone but her.  Apparently a camera is needed to take a pic of Abby M. No clue.. oh, she has chocolate smashed all over her face. Good for her. *sigh* Where's RENT? And I need to sharpen this pencil, but it's not like I have a sharpener.   *December 24* - *stops*  BOYFRIEND!!  Oh yeah, he doesn't die... still though. The thought of anyone inflicting pain on Boyfriend just SICKENS me. *sings* Boyfriend ain't gonna dieeeeee....  Oh. Lightening. Hm. *looks * Don't see any.  Butterbitch is such a dumbass.Die. HAH! And the Prince is a weanie. Those two are meant for each other. Inigo and Wesley are meant for ME!!  Wow, that lightening was huge. A little creepy, no?   I can't stand to watch them kiss. *sigh* Well, girl can't have everything. Come here, Inigo. Let me hold you...   3:06 PM.  *turns on Rent and grabs sharper pencil* You know, just for Contact, Rent should be R-rated.   Stop SCREAMING, morons. The storm has really picked up. We drove right into it, I think.   YAY!! Voice Mail #1!! :)  Luckily Mrs. Q can't hear a damn thing. Good Lord.   Oooh, bad language. *turns to song 23* La Vie Boheme!!! I reaaaaaaaally love this song. And nooo, I don't want to sing those irritating songs today/now.   Wow, I wrote a lot.   That pizza for lunch was really good. I don't understand how Michaelangelo didn't like it. *sings with chorus* La Vie Boheme! This music is so GOOD!! AHH!! I want to live la vie Boheme. *sigh* I am now very cold. And I will need new batteries soon.   3:37 PM.  There is no way I will ever get to see Rent *sigh* It's RIDDLED with R-rated references. *smiles and sings to Take Me or Leave Me* Who cares if it's two lesbians? :-P  Back on Coliseum Blvd. How exciting going home. I'm telling you, I SO cannot go back to school after this. TAKE ME BABY! OR LEAVE ME! Seasons of Love is so beautiful. I'm going to post the lyrics in my profile.   BORDERS! *shrieks as Nikky shrieks "Mall!"*  People!! Stop yelling. I'm tired of you all. Grr. Nikki dearest! Enough!!  *turns up music to drown out them*  Seasons of ... love....  THE END.

      Oh dear. I am on the verge of becoming a Rent-head... *screams*  Anyway, we have the trip to Indy in the morning. I should be in bed like everyone else, and I'm tired, but I have to dry my hair. *sneezes*  *sings* That was a very loud beep... *stops self*  Rent is all I can think about. Um... I'll think about ponies and how they should die. Grr.  Nah. I like thinking about things I enjoy. Dammit, what do I write? I write about... how my dad is here and giving me a look. That is not something I enjoy. I do not enjoy this at all. This is scary. Not enjoyable.  I think I'll go now.

      *sings to self* Sorry to hear that Maureen dumped you, I say c'est la vie, so let her be a lesbiAAAAAAAAN! There are other fishies in the sea! Love, MOOOOOO-om! *beep*  I checked out RENT from the library. In case you didn't already know, RENT is a Broadway musical that won the Pulitzer Prize for Drama in the late 90s. There are these people called RENTheads who love it... and many of them happen to love Alias. So naturally I was curious. I checked it out, and it's kinda bizzare. But I'm growing to like it. "Seasons of Love" and "Tango: Maureen" are two of my favorites. It's kind of a PG-13 play, if you ask me.   Anyway - I have to leave for my grandma's before lunch, so I'm doing all this now because I have to clean the bathroom when I get home (thrill).   There's a lady at our church - I don't know how many of you have noticed her. I call her the Hat Lady. This name is rather self-explanatory. She's a shorter woman with gray hair, pink lipstick, a nice smile, bright dresses, and a HAT to match every single one of them. Her husband is apparently some guy that owns a bank. So I suppose she has enough money to buy all these hats. That's going to be me someday. You watch.  Being Catholic reminds me of being Italian or German or something - it's ethnic in its own little way. We're good little children who sit and get bored during church and eat Cheerios. Then we are sent to Catholic school where we have insane teachers, which I guess is better than having insane nuns. Just ask my mother sometime. They're all crazy. And then we become bad boys and girls when we grow up because we have been stilted and can't get our nervous energy out. Then we see therapists. Then we become therapists. It's a cycle.  I swear, our teachers really are insane. My mother claims you have to be insane to teach junior high.   Like Mrs. Kirby. Good lord. She's a nice woman, but can she stay on topic? Can she focus on one thing?? *sigh* And is it really necessary to be tan at the age of 50+? Or wear sandals all the time or try to look younger? I don't know. I just don't know.  Mrs. Quinn just needs to retire. Ack.   I don't know, they all just get progressively stranger.   *puts off typing up her epilogue* It's gonna suck. Accccccccck.   There's a Harry Potter article in Girl's Life. I'm trying to read it but I'm typing all this stuff so I'm getting distracted. But I like to type. The siblings won't go away and I have lost my comic touch temporarily. It's Mrs. Kirby's fault.  And I can't figure out why the font is so small on the main page. I'm going to try and fix it.   Kiss me goodbye, y'all.

      Okay, well yeah, today I had fun. Lots of lazy fun.  Went to Abby's and hung out inside for awhile and did nothing... then Katie came and we went outside and talked about like nothing. Then we went on a walk and talked some more about nothing. And then we went for a ride in a paddleboat and talked some more about nothing and drank a lot of cans of stuff. I had Brisk. Annnnnnd we came in and had hamburgers, and then we went downstairs and made up personalities and stuff and almost set Abby's room on fire, HA! And then we ate Oreo pie and we discovered that it is unwise to let Abby cut things.   Really.  You know, for quiet people we talk a lot.  Anyway, it felt good to just hang outside (which I NEVER do, by the way) and get away from it all...

      Dear God, I love Norah Jones. Her new CD is yum. Well, the wind is blowing and it's quite painful to be out there without a sweatshirt on. Kristin, I'm sorry, but yours just does not fit. It's too small. *shrugs*   I'm happy-ish right now... I think it might be the Oreos. Or other things. This might be my blog, but definitely not my diary. Sorry to disappoint all ya pervs out there. *waves to skanky fifty-year-old men whose eyes are glued to screen*   *watches as they sadly flick off their computers and drive out on their Harleys to Denny's Bar*  Now... hmm... what is there to say? I bought Fiddler on the Roof on Sunday and I LOVE it. I've watched my wedding a thousand times. I think I like the dancing. I also have to watch Casablanca and finish West Side Story. Gah, I never have time for ANYTHING. I sit at the computer and talk to people... that's quite time consuming. Oh, and there's a history test tomorrow. *sigh*  I want there to be a nice sun and no mosquitos, so I can lie outside and enjoy sunset. Read a book and listen to Norah.   Oh, Sibling Deux made up a joke! Let's hear it.   SD: I have a joke! ME: Okay.  SD: Why did the dog, um... get into the oven, and then put in a bunch of dirt? ME: (typing in blog) What? SD: Why did the dog get in the oven and put dirt all over himself inside?  ME: (still typing) I don't know. SD: Because he wanted to be a hot diggety dog! ME: Oooh... cute.  (SD runs off happily, having told her joke.)  Yes, thus runs my life. I am FREEZING COLD and yay! It's time to put the hot pad on my leg. Because, you see, it still hurts. *waits for skeevy fifty-year-old men to send flowers* I like roses. Anyway, still cold... warm up, thing... soon...  How is my life? Decent, I suppose. I shall see y'all later.

      I'm still somewhat the skeptic.   But after reading Random Writings...  I think I understand a little better.    So just...  that's a good thing . I mean... I'm beginning to understand. After all, you read my story, right? I'm not a total skeptic. I think I'm starting to see where you're coming from.   It just took me awhile.

      This scene from RENT describes how very Mark-like I feel.  ROGER  Who are you to tell me what I know, what to do  MARK  A friend  ROGER  But who, Mark, are you? "Mark has got his work" They say "Mark lives for his work" And "Mark's in love with his work" Mark hides in his work  MARK  But from what?  ROGER  From facing your failure, facing your loneliness Facing the fact you live a lie Yes, you live a lie -- tell you why You're always preaching not to be numb When that's how you thrive You pretend to create and observe When you really detach from feeling alive  MARK  Perhaps it's because I'm the one of us to survive  ROGER  Poor baby  MARK  Mimi still loves Roger Is Roger really jealous Or afraid that Mimi's weak  ROGER  Mimi did look pale  MARK  Mimi's gotten thin Mimi's running out of time Roger's running out the door  ROGER  No more! Oh no! I've gotta go  MARK  Hey, for somebody who's always been let down Who's heading out of town?  ROGER  For someone who longs for a community of his own, Who's with his camera, alone? (ROGER takes a step to go, then stops, turns.) I'll call I hate the fall  I'll be out of town for a week. See ya.

      Perhaps no one's noticed, but I'm a rather bitter person and I don't like having certain things rubbed into me. I'm sick of it, in fact, and it burns up my soul, and I'd rather none of you discuss it anymore. It only serves to make me hate, and hate is not an emotion I enjoy feeling. Regardless of what the hate page says.   MORE THOUGHTS ON TEEN COUPLES: It takes two very mature people to make it work. If you can, dandy. If you can't, equally dandy. But I don't give a damn either way. I will not persecute any of you. Love is something I would like myself and I would never, ever discourage anybody else from it. Savvy? I have naught but good will toward all of you.  But PLEASE. Do me a favor.   Stop telling me about it. It hurts.   Some days I really wonder if I'd rather be a stupid innocent hurt person who believes or a happy one who is unhurt. That's all love has really done to me, just caused me to wonder that fact minute after hour after day.  I don't want your pity. I just want you to understand. I don't want you to feel sorry for me. I just want you to know how I feel. I want you to know that I've got all these scars from my past experiences and sometimes it hurts even to see the people I love together and happy because I'm not. I don't call it jealousy; I call it longing. I am SORRY that sometimes I feel that way. I just can't help it. I don't know what to do other than wait.  And I think I've already waited forever.

      RENT: A summary by me and the official site of RENT  Mark Cohen: filmmaker/video artist. Narrator of the show and Roger’s roommate. Roger Davis: struggling musician who is HIV+. Hopes to write one meaningful song before he dies. Tom Collins: computer genius. Also HIV+ and back from NYC. Benny Coffin: Mark and Roger’s landlord. Wants to build a multimedia studio. Joanne Jefferson: public interest lawyer and Maureen’s lover.   Angel Shunard: street drummer transvestite (cross-dresser) who is also HIV+.  Mimi Marquez: dancer with AIDS and a drug problem. Maureen Johnson: performance artist and Mark’s ex-girlfriend.  ACT ONE:   Mark and Roger are spending a cold Christmas Eve in their industrial lot apartment in the Lower East Side. They receive several phone calls (TUNE UP #1 & 2/VOICE MAIL #1). The first is from Mark’s mother consoling him about losing his ex, Maureen, to a lawyer named Joanne. The second is from Tom Collins – who is cut off when muggers “detain” him. The third is from their landlord Benny, demanding the rent. The power blows, along with Mark and Roger’s tempers (RENT).  Collins is still outside in pain from the mugging. He is found and comforted by Angel, a street musician, who offers him a helping hand (YOU OKAY HONEY?). Discovering they’re both HIV+, they set out for a night on the town and a life support meeting.  Maureen calls Mark with a technical problem and asks for help, so he sets out to her performance lot. Tonight, Maureen will perform a protest against Benny’s eviction of the homeless. He tries to get Roger to come along, but he refuses. Roger (as Mark explains to us) has not left the apartment in six months. He’s still reeling from the suicide of his girlfriend April, who slashed her wrists when she learned they had AIDS. Roger is trying to write a song but suffering major writer’s block, and the only melody he can find is “Musetta’s Waltz” from Puccini’s La Bohème (ONE SONG GLORY).   Mimi, an S&M dancer who lives below Mark and Roger, knocks on the door with a request: LIGHT MY CANDLE. There’s an immediate attraction between she and Roger, but Roger shies away and shows her to the door. She knocks again – she’s lost her stash. Roger helps her look and Mimi eventually finds it- in Roger's back pocket.  Joanne is frantically trying to fix the sound equipment for Maureen’s performance. Her parents leave her VOICE MAIL #2, pleading with her to come to her mother’s confirmation hearing. Collins arrives at the apartment with a bag of cool stuff. Angel comes along gloriously arrayed in his Christmas finest - wig, glitter, and platform pumps. In TODAY 4 U, Angel explains how he earned $1,000: a wealthy woman hired him to play the drums until her neighbor's yappy Akita barked itself to death.  Benny enters with a proposal (YOU’LL SEE). If Mark and Roger stop Maureen’s protest, he’ll drop the rent. He tries to bribe them with Cyber Arts, a state-of-the-art, multimedia studio to realize all their dreams. He is unsuccessful and leaves. Collins and Angel persuade Mark to come to life support with them, but can’t persuade Roger.  Mark finally reaches Maureen’s performance lot. There, he meets Joanne, still struggling with Maureen’s demands and sound equipment. Mark offers to help her. They discover (TANGO: MAUREEN) that although they dreaded meeting, they have a lot in common. Finished, Mark heads to the LIFE SUPPORT meeting.  In her apartment, Mimi is dressing and appeals to an imaginary Roger to take her OUT TONIGHT. She barges into his apartment and continues her appeal to Roger himself, but after a passionate kiss, he vehemently rejects her. They fight, her words blending with the affirmation of the support group that emphasizes the importance of living the moment (ANOTHER DAY). A young man from the support group asks quietly, "Will I lose my dignity/Will someone care?" (WILL I?). His thoughts and fears are echoed by each member of the community. The thoughts are Roger's too, and he decides to go outside.  After the meeting, Collins, Angel, and Mark roam outside and rescue a homeless woman from the taunts of some neighborhood cops (ON THE STREET). The three dream of opening a restaurant in SANTA FE, tired of New York life. Mark leaves, and Angel and Collins express their love for each other (I’LL COVER YOU).  Joanne, meanwhile, has her hands full juggling work, parents, and the ever-demanding Maureen...all over the phone (WE'RE OKAY).  The scene changes to St. Mark's Place where vendors hawk their wares to the bohemians of the East Village (CHRISTMAS BELLS). Angel buys a new coat for Collins. Mark finds Roger who spots Mimi looking for drugs. Roger apologizes and asks her to dinner. Just as the snow begins to fall, Maureen finally appears on her motorcycle to perform her protest, OVER THE MOON.  After the performance, everyone heads to the Life Café, where they meet Benny. He announces that Bohemia is dead. The others immediately engage in a mock funeral that turns into a celebration of LA VIE BOHEME. During the song, Benny confronts Mimi and threatens to reveal their past affair to Roger. Beepers go off to remind the revelers to take their AZT. Roger and Mimi each discover that the other is HIV+. Frightened, excited, they vow to be together (I SHOULD TELL YOU).  Joanne has been sent back to the lot by Maureen several times to check on the equipment. She finally rebels, telling Maureen that their relationship is over and announcing a riot in the lot: Benny has padlocked the building and called the cops but the homeless are standing their ground. And mooing. The artists rejoice, the riot continues, and Roger and Mimi share a small, lovely kiss.  ACT TWO:  The second act begins with the company posing the question, "How do you measure a year in the life?" (SEASONS OF LOVE). It is one week later, New Year's Eve, and Mark, Roger, Mimi, Maureen, Joanne, Angel and Collins are having a breaking-back-into-the-building party (HAPPY NEW YEAR). Once inside, Mark listens to one more phone message from his mother in Scarsdale as well as one from Alexi Darling, a tabloid TV producer salivating over his footage of the riot (VOICE MAIL #3). Benny crashes the party, angering Roger and alienating Roger from Mimi. Dejected, Mimi wanders outside and into the welcoming arms of her drug dealer.  Mark fastforwards to Valentine's Day. Roger and Mimi are still together. Angel and Collins could be anywhere. Maureen and Joanne are still rehearsing another show, but it is not going well (TAKE ME OR LEAVE ME).  The company reprises SEASONS OF LOVE and time marches forward again, to spring. Roger and Mimi have a fight and Roger walks out. Alone, Mimi reflects on what life would be like without Roger (WITHOUT YOU). At the same time, Collins nurses a sick Angel; Maureen and Joanne reconcile; as do Mimi and Roger.  At the end of the summer, Alexi is still courting Mark for her TV show (VOICE MAIL #4). Roger and Mimi, unsatisfied by love's complications, break up, as do Maureen and Joanne. Angel dies (CONTACT). At a memorial service, his friends remember his spirit. Collins remembers his love (I'LL COVER YOU: REPRISE).  Outside the church, Mark phones Alexi to accept the job. Mark ponders how life has changed since last year as he recalls the joys of that one night last Christmas (HALLOWEEN). As the mourners leave the church, Mimi confirms that Roger has sold his guitar and is leaving town. Roger confirms that Mimi is now with Benny. A fight erupts among Roger, Mimi, Maureen, Benny, and Joanne. Collins interrupts them with the sorrowful reality that the family is breaking up. Joanne and Maureen reunite. Mimi and Benny leave.  Mark tries to convince Roger to stay in New York and face his pain and the fact that Mimi is very sick. Roger attacks Mark, accusing him of hiding from his feelings. Mimi enters, having overheard the entire angry exchange, and bids Roger farewell (GOODBYE, LOVE). Roger leaves town. Mimi turns to Mark for help. Benny offers one helping hand to Mimi and extends the other to Collins to help him pay Angel's funeral expenses. Mimi refuses the help and flees. Collins accepts and he and Benny go out for a drink.  Mark considers the events and faces the last year, as does Roger, who is on his way to Santa Fe. Roger begins to discover his own song and Mark turns down the television job to finish his own film (WHAT YOU OWN).  Roger's mom, Mark's mom, Mimi's mom, and Joanne's father all wonder where their children are (VOICE MAIL #5). Back at the loft, Mark tells us that again it's Christmas. He now has a rough version of his film, which he's going to show tonight. Roger has returned, has written his song, but cannot find Mimi. Collins enters with money he has gotten from an ATM rewired to give money to anyone with a special code. The password? Angel.  Maureen and Joanne suddenly arrive holding Mimi, whom they found collapsed and near death in the park. Roger begs her not to die and sings for her the song it has taken him all year to write, YOUR EYES. Mimi dies as Roger wails her name over a blast of Puccini's music. Suddenly Mimi awakens. It seems that a guardian Angel was watching over her.  The company joins in a reprise of the affirmation that love is all and that there is "no day but today" (FINALE).

      Yesterday was so action-packed that I'm still tired now. It's about 1:30 and I'm still in my pajamas. Everyone has some kind of practice except me... I don't know what I'll do all day. Oooh, Abby's on! Yay!  I'd rather watch a movie than read a book. Maybe I can go with somebody to see The Stepford Wives or something. I kinda want to see it. I made a big list of Movies to See.   This had better not be a boring day...  Oh, yeah! Mattie Stepanak died! I felt so terrible because I've seen him on Oprah and I just checked out his book from the library! It was just sad.... he seems like just a beautiful person. Or seemed. But that sounds so depressing.   I have two fanfics in the works. One, a Fiddler on the Roof alternate universe and two, a Harry/Hermione/Ron triangle fic. The second one is probably going to be incredibly long and tangled and confusing, if it's anything how I would like it to be.

      I am SO SICK of people who stand around and do nothing. GRRRR. I figure - why make plans and discuss them and rehash them over and over again if you're not going to do a thing? Why? What's the g-d point? LET'S DO SOMETHING!!   I am SICK of standing around and looking at each other and pessimistically pointing out all the problems. Lighten up. We can find a solution if we START WORKING. Get off your lazy ass and help out, okay? Did Albert Einstein sit on his ass all day and say, well, if I already had the solution I could START researching and experimenting. Yeah? No, I don't think he did. He accomplished something.  Which is what I want. All I want is for something of mine to go RIGHT for a change. We have the materials, might as well.   *is very, very pissed*

      One thing I've noticed in my later years of writing (I'm fifteen, hah!) is that I get all my best ideas sitting in church. Especially during the homilies. I have several theories as to why this is.  1)  I'm bored.  I don't wish to pay attention to my surroundings and instead lose myself in thought, which invariably leads back to my stories. 2)  God wants me to pay more attention in Mass and so punishes me for not doing so by giving me a bunch of good ideas that I can't write down, leaving me with the feeling of DAMMIT, WHY COULDN'T I JUST REMEMBER THE DAMN PENCIL.  3)  The atmosphere and deep thinking get my creative juices flowing and inspired.   I think it's a nice combination. Whatever it is, someday I think I should try writing in church. Not during a Mass, just coming in one day and sitting and thinking. I've gotten MOST of my good ideas there.

      *deep breath* This is the closest I've felt to a book in a very long time. And I'm all the closer to it knowing it's  real. There was an Anne Frank alive in Holland in 1944. This was her diary.  And it's exciting and eerie all at once.  I've always been interested in Anne Frank - I found out she shared my birthday (June 12th) and was born in 1929 (I was born in 1989). Exactly 60 years after she was born, I was born. She kept a diary, like I do. These are her hobbies and interests: 1) writing, but that hardly counts as a hobby 2) family trees.... 3) history 4) Greek and Roman mythology Film stars. Family photos. Books and reading. History of art, poets, painters, music. Hate algebra and geometry.   She writes that after she becomes a journalist, she wants to be a great writer and publish books... and she says having a husband and children isn't too important to her...   But it's not only the fact that I love and hate every one of those things she mentioned. I felt as I was reading it, like I knew her. I knew Anne Frank. It's like she had touched a part of my soul and brought it down to paper - and I read her words and I knew. I knew exactly what she was going through and how she felt about her mother... I knew the way they didn't get along... it's like that with me. And I know how she was with her father - I'm very much the same - and I hate the way my mother and sister gang up on me and laugh at me when I'm in a problem... and I know what it's like to need somebody to talk to and to listen and to understand me...   I know what it's like to feel that nobody understands - and then finding someone who does. I know how it is to love somebody very much but know you'd never marry them... and how it is when you're a teenager and you have all these THOUGHTS and philosophies and you think about life! And you need to tell about it all and THINK and you grasp so much - and the adults don't understand that part of you.  And when you have two sides. The side that no one ever sees of you, the tender side that says it can love - and the other side, the front that one puts up to prevent ever, ever getting hurt.   Needing something to believe in.  I feel it all - and they killed her. They ripped, cut, sliced her life short where she was - what she could have been - what I might be someday. She was my age. And she's gone... and it feels like somebody hurt me too. I can feel that cut on my soul where she was part of me...  And yet I think she still lives on. I think... all I have to do is remember who she was and keep her very close to me, and just try and BE somebody. Be somebody... because she was somebody... and she could have been more...

      Only recently I've been skimming the internet looking for HP shippers, seeing what's popular and what in my own mind could work and couldn't work. Gonna discuss a few for ya...  Harry/Hermione: JK Rowling always seems so surprised when she finds out people ship these two. That, and the fact that they seem to be such platonic friends, causes me to doubt this ship would ever happen. I'm not saying it would be really boring or anything, but they just don't radiate that type of chemistry (in my mind). I've never seen romantic sparks from either of them together. I do think it's an awesome relationship the way it is and an awesome friendship. I love it when they collaborate solving Harry's insane problems. Romantically: Nope.  Ron/Hermione: Yes, I'm a R/Hr shipper, though not an insane one. I definitely see chemistry between these two - Ron was SO OBVIOUSLY jealous of Hermione and Viktor Krum, and I think it was incredibly obvious to Hermione, too. Maybe (and I have to reread the books majorly) at first, she was okay with spiting Ron with Viktor, but I think now she's beginning to have second thoughts about it. And think of all the times she and Ron have had to work together to keep Harry on track. Think of all the times they've probably shared with each other when Harry wasn't around. Some might say that they fight so often that there's no romantic spark there - but I think the fights are part of the relationship... fights keep things healthy! They seem to complete each other, and I can see this ship lasting a long time.  Draco/Hermione: A long time ago, perhaps first book, I could've seen this ship happening. But I think in light of Malfoy turning more and more evil (like his father) as the books progress.... there's not a chance Hermione would risk her friends' trust for a relationship with him. I would be incredibly disappointed if any of the characters we've grown to love turn to Draco. Sure, it would be fascinating to watch Hermione's inner conflict - but the book is about Harry, remember, and we wouldn't get to see much of what makes this ship so fascinating. And JK would never make it canon, ever. She just doesn't seem to think that way.  Harry/Ginny: I'm not sure what to make of this one. I don't know what Ron's reaction would be to Harry dating his little sister, but it would likely be more positive than his reactions to Michael Corner and Dean Thomas... This is one ship I probably would find boring, though. It's just... blah. So what. There's nothing there but platonic and even distant friendship.  Draco/Ginny: Oooh, now this would be interesting. Except for the fact that, um, GINNY WAS CAPTURED AND NEARLY KILLED BY VOLDEMORT, who happens to be a very close friend of the Malfoys. If Draco was merely a slightly grey badass boy, I could see it - but he gets blacker and blacker every book, and I'm willing to bet that Ginny loathes him. Sometimes loathing/hate is closely related to love, but any love here would be from Draco's end, and he hates the Weasleys. Although he could see her as the exception to the rule because of her looks or something. It could possibly be a Draco-chases-girl type thing, and lead to a one-time thing between the two.  Ginny/Neville: I'm not sure when this girl will settle down for a long-term relationship, if ever! So for the moment I actually ship Ginny/Random Dude. A spot which could easily be filled by Neville Longbottom. Surprising but true... they've got history, it could be cute and oddly fulfilling for both of them.  Harry/Luna: This is MY ship. This is the one I'm rather passionate about at the moment. These two have so much potential and so much in common. Both are slight outcasts, both have lost parents and can see thestrals, both aren't afraid to defy the conformity and step outside the box. They seem to complement each other. Harry doesn't mind her talking about Sirius, something kind of rare - and at the end of the fifth book, a bond seems to have been created. I can see Harry becoming fascinated with her, maybe attracted to the more hidden qualities of her personality that others fail to see, because they choose not to look deeply enough at her. He might like her sense of humor and grow to see her as more of a person than anyone else ever has. Luna, I think, already understands Harry. Under her dreamy exterior, I can see a quick thinker and perceiver, and I think she already knows him from the inside out. And she accepts him as he is. He needs somebody like that in his life. *so speaketh the Harry/Luna shipper*  Snape/Lily: In other words, a ship of Harry's mother and Snape at school. I'm certain Lily felt nothing but pity for Snape, so I don't think this ship works. I don't think any Snape ship works, because the girls he likely loved felt nothing but loathing or pity for him, and the girls who loved him (if any), he shunned away because he's used to a loveless existance. Snape has a hard, cold shell, and it would take a miracle for anyone to break it.   James/Lily: I want to know how Lily went from hate of James to marriage. I also want to know what deflated James's head in the first place - seemed like a heartless git in the fifth book. This ship is definitely one JK must explore in the future, because it seems incredibly crucial and important to me. I would be interested to see, but I'm not a fanatical shipper of these two.  Remus/Lily: This ship would be sweet. I'd very much like it if Lupin and Lily had a short, sweet relationship for awhile. I think they'd have an interesting history and chemistry, and I can definitely see either of them crushing on the other, if only briefly. I'm sure there's something there that could be explored.  Sirius/Lily: This ship would certainly be interesting... sparks would fly for sure. This is somewhat of what Draco/Hermione or Draco/Ginny could be if Draco wasn't such a bastard. These two POSSIBLY had something at one time. Sirius was probably attracted to her and chased her a bit - she never let her guard down, though. This ship could be fun.  That's all I can think of for the moment - hope you found it interesting.

      So be amazed, Laura is actually DOING something. Basically to distract herself, but whatever.  This is a list of people/things that imspire me or that I admire - I got the idea from the song "La Vie Boheme" from RENT. It's quite a cool song.  Alias RENT Fiddler on the Roof Jules Verne Pizza PBJ sandwiches musicals Broadway Idina Menzel Eoin Colfer apples strawberries chocolate Van Gogh coffee Pirates of the Caribbean alcohol bubbles camisoles Agatha Christie JJ Abrams Wicked Jennifer Garner Victor Garber David Anders Catherine Zeta-Jones Renee Zellweger JK Rowling Louis Sachar jazz classical music Tchaikovsky Liz Phair Sarah McLachlan Evanescence Norah Jones Sara Evans  There's obviously more, but I have dinner.

      This is my kinda late equivelant to Hillary's Harry/Hermione post. I'm not trying to change minds, I'm just stating what I think. I'm Ron/Hermione and Harry/Luna, and I don't want anybody trying to change MY mind. I wouldn't do it to you.   Required reading:   urlLink  http://www.livejournal.com/users/angua9/19232.html    Must-read reading:   urlLink  http://www.livejournal.com/users/angua9/35085.html    And this is the best:   urlLink  http://www.livejournal.com/users/angua9/45103.html      If you want my opinion, all those posts are SPOT-ON. Romantic relationships need FOUNDATIONS and GROUNDWORK laid. I'm pretty damn sure that Rowling has been plotting and laying groundwork already, and she's not just going to stick Hermione with Harry. There are absolutely NO sparks, and I would consider it boring. Ron and Hermione, though, are sparking every moment of their sparky lives. Like Angua said, one person does not have to be your everything. Harry needs LOTS of people to help him, and Hermione just isn't strong enough to handle it all on her own. Harry needs someone to make him laugh and keep him grounded, and I think Hermione needs that too ... so it's kind of a dead end. She can find it in Ron, though, and Harry can look elsewhere.  "But Ron was staring at Hermione as though suddenly seeing her in a whole new light. 'Hermione, Neville's right - you ARE a girl...'" Then he's totally desperate to know who she's going to the ball with. And then when he finds out, he won't stop harassing her about Krum and what a loser (he thinks) he is. All he watches during the dance is Krum and Hermione. (Just like Harry watched Cho and Cedric.) JEAL.OUS. JEAL.OUS. JEAL.OUS. So yeah, he might be going about it the wrong way, but face it, at this point he's still an immature teenage guy. What the hell does he know?  I will also quote Goblet of Fire, page 316 of American hardcover. "Harry liked Hermione very much, but she just wasn't the same as Ron. There was much less laughter and a lot more hanging around the library when Hermione was your best friend."  I think that speaks for itself.

      "You can sit forever, lamenting about how bad you've been, feeling guilty until your death, and not one tiny slice of that guilt will do anything to rectify past behavior." I just like this quote.  I was thinking on the way back from Borders that everything is possible when you can drive. You can move out, buy food, date people, watch movies, and do ANYTHING.  My dad doesn't trust me/think I'm ready to drive yet. Sure I'll get lost nearly everywhere I go, but that's half the fun... and I won't get into any accidents, I know that for sure. So I have to wait another YEAR for driver's ed when I could be driving around in a beat-up Oldsmobile with rust on the doors. Damn.  My parents have refused to buy me a car... they don't even want to give me my dad's current Malibu. They're afraid it'll explode or something. Well, with me driving... Anyway, before I can get a car, I have to get a job. To get to my job, I need a car. WTF.  I would be a babysitter, but unfortunately by the time I moved here the market was basically monopolized by a group of other people my age. Thanks, Hill. Kids seem to think I'm strange but funny, which does work. But little kids scare me. I'm always afraid I'll psychologically damage their little minds. I'm sure I already have. There was this game we played called Queen... *smiles* Good times.  Anyway, I'm just too lazy to find a job - I really ought to start looking, next summer at least. I just need to write a really good book and make thousands of dollars on it. But I severly am procrastinating right now. It's bad.

      I wrote another poem - it's kinda like one of those funky things you'd hear sung/spoken over music. It's odd. Tell me if you like.  "delicious, delectable edible apples"  you know, i thought i had a good life so pretty and fake on the outside but so sour and bitter and raw inside i'm tired of that, sick of it yeah i want my life to be sweet with a crunch like apples fresh picked so sick of the storebought ones where they're all lucious red and taste like shit when you bite i want to pick it pure and clean, happy feel the rush in my soul from the flavor cause it tastes sooo good no more worms in the apples for me i want to taste my life, taste it good start again, reset, be fresh mmm... can't wait for the flow thrills me so fast and doesn't leave me try someone different, try someone new believe and love God move on be new be fresh be clean be pure... taste good.   Well, whatever. It's raining outside off and on, and it's generally a bleak looking day. But my heart feels kinda good, and this is a first. I think this could very well be a turning point in my life for something far for the better. I think I might enjoy my life now...I'm ready to move on and try new things. I have a desperate need to meet more people. I need new surroundings, I've been stuck up in this house way too long.  Megan's party was great!! We really ought to have another one before school starts, just as a grand finale. Beedeebooom. [/overthemoon] Byee!!

      I will now take this time to profess my deep appreciation for&nbsp;two Harry Potter characters. &nbsp; Dumbledore: It kills me, the way he calls Voldemort "Tom." It shows so many deep levels and meanings and is completely kickass. A) Dumbledore's not afraid of him and Voldemort knows it. B) To show Voldemort that he's still human and able to die. C) Dumbledore thinks calling him by his (in his opinion) unintimidating title is silly. He only calls Voldemort "Voldemort" around other people. D) Dumbledore's just calling him by the name he had at school.  &nbsp; I don't know, I get this thrill every time he does it. Yes, it does turn me on. I'm totally turned on by 150+ year old fictional wizard.  &nbsp; McGonagall: The way she was combating Umbridge at every turn, making her AWESOME, and the way she was still totally strict/unfair/etc./old self .... she's actually one of my favorite characters. One of her best lines is "The Yule&nbsp;Ball is of course&nbsp;a chance for us all to - er - let our&nbsp;hair down." Also "May I offer you a&nbsp;cough&nbsp;drop, Dolores?" ALSO,&nbsp;"I wonder how you expect to gain an idea of my usual teaching methods if you continue&nbsp;to interrupt me? You see, I do not generally permit&nbsp;people to talk when I'm talking." She's. Just. So. Frickin. Cool. She's like an older, more sarcastic version of Hermione. &nbsp; That green pastel Bug is still sitting in my neighbor's driveway. I'm SO bored today. I ought to be reading a book or something. And my internet is still acting up, so don't be surprised if I am kicked off, etc. Ohhh - do I hear the beginnings of a storm? &nbsp; I have to pack for camp tonight. I loooooooathe packing and unpacking. Sometimes suitcases sit in my room unopened for days.

      Got some stuff to say that I've been meaning to say for awhile. First of all, I LOVE MY SIDEBAR TO DEATH!!! Go look at it right now! Isn't it cool?? And I did it all by my onesy. Okay. Now. Down to the serious junk. &nbsp; Ever notice how teenagers are always philosphizing about the world and heaven and everything? And adults really aren't? I wonder about that.  &nbsp; I actually try not to think about it too much, because I would go crazy if I did. But here's some stuff I've thought of... &nbsp; Maybe the afterlife is only what we imagine it to be. Maybe everyone has their own personal vision of heaven, purgatory, and hell, and God just is sure to punish/reward you with whatever it is. But I doubt it, because if we went to Homer Simpson's vision of hell, we would be surrounded by fire and eating barbecue.  &nbsp; But my vision of hell is a small white room, with no doors or windows, and yourself in incredible pain, searching around the box for a way out, with nothing else to do except sit and think about what got&nbsp;you there. And then you would&nbsp;stay that way for eternity. Eternity's a frickin long time. It's not even a time, it's just ...  &nbsp; Thinking about forever has always freaked me out. Or it did, until something occured to me. I don't care how long forever is as long as I'm not alone with just a bunch of angels. I want the people I care about to be there. I want to meet all the people I admire and new people I've never met, and I never want to run out of things to do. I don't want to just float forever. &nbsp; But maybe that'll change once I'm actually there, you know? Cause supposedly when you're there, material things don't matter anymore. But I know my immature mind will still want to meet Anne Frank and Agatha Christie and several other cool people. And I'll still want to look at what's going on down there, just in case I leave somebody behind. I want to somehow help the world when I'm up there.  &nbsp; Purgatory is a weird thing. It's never been made very clear to me exactly what it IS. I have a couple of ideas, the first one being becoming a spirit on earth. You get the opportunity to correct something on earth that you did wrong while you were alive. Or if you can't correct whatever it was, you get to interfere with fate a little for the positive. Once you've done your job, you leave.  &nbsp; The second one is that you come back as a different person. I have extreme doubts about this one. But in some way, I think every action affects everything else (think butterfly effect), and in that lifetime you could repair what you'd done before. I don't know, I like the so-called ghost idea better....  &nbsp; Because really, what else could it be? An emerald mine somewhere in the underground where you hack away at rock with a hammer and feel like your soul's being ripped out, with a clock in the corner somewhere telling you how much longer you're going to be there? &nbsp; If you want a really funny and moving book on this whole heaven/hell/purgatory thing, I recommend  The Wish List  by Eoin Colfer, the writer of  Artemis Fowl .  &nbsp; *sigh*.... &nbsp; In other news, I went bowling today, sucked, and then went to Healthkick to taste my first Bawls. It's strange and unique. I actually think I like Jones better. And I'm pretty sure I'm building up an immunity to caffeine, but it got me hyper nonetheless. I was tapdancing outside the bowling alley if that gives you an idea.

      In light of recent events, I've decided to place down for you all my policy regarding Orlando Bloom. Take it without question, as it is the truth and will not be changed for any reason.   As a whole, I enjoy Orlando Bloom. I enjoy his acting, which I feel is good and strong. I enjoy his personality; he  seems  like a normal, sweet, down-to-earth person. Do I choose do be suspicious of his personality? No. I treat him as I treat all other celebrities I read about - goodwill with a grain of salt. I also enjoy his looks. I do not think there is anything extraordinary about them, but he is nice to look at.   If I heard he had died in a plane crash this very day, of course I would be upset, as I would assume most people would be when they hear of somebody dying in a plane crash. (Except in the case of Britney Spears.) Talent and youth would be lost, [valleygirlvoice] and they'd totally have to rewrite the next POTC movie. [/valleygirlvoice]It would be tragic, HOWEVER. I would not slit my wrists about it.   Further on his good looks, I had not the faintest idea what anybody was talking about (Orlando hot? What the hell...) until the last five minutes of POTC, when he appeared onscreen in a dashing hat to save my favorite character. Then I noticed.   To even progress further backwards, I used to loathe Orlando Bloom in the days of hating LOTR. Anything remotely connected with him or LOTR made me scoff and turn away disgustedly. I did not think he was spectacular when I finally watched FOTR, but he made a good impression.  I do not believe he is up to the acting caliber of Johnny Depp, Jennifer Garner, or David Anders, my true celebrity obsessions. I appreciate these people more than I can possibly say, and that's another blog entry.  To sum it up - I like Orlando Bloom. I do not love Orlando Bloom. I have never kissed a picture or made flirty eyes at a picture of Orlando Bloom. I have, however, smiled at one. There is a solitary picture of him on my door, accompanied by Johnny Depp in the same. (To be specific, it is the scene where Will pulls out his sword and yells "Aye! Avast!")  I will not disguise the fact that I like Orlando Bloom. I will not be convinced to stop enjoying him, unless by chance I hear it for a fact that he has committed murder. (If you wish to quiz me on what would convince me to stop liking Orlando Bloom, I will gladly oblige you, as I am not interested in listing every reason.)  HOWEVER.  If he offends you in any way, I will not mention him in front of you. I will act as though I am completely indifferent to him (and I am close to it, at this point). I will make every effort to have no mention of him in any situation or circumstance around you because I would like the same courtesy done for me. I will not attempt to convince you to like him, nor convince other people to like him. If I have done this in the past, this is the new policy: I will not.   If you let me like Orlando Bloom in peace, I will let you hate Orlando Bloom in peace.   That is all.

      I updated the links on the very bottom of the right bar. I'm pimping Paul's blog cause really, it's the one most worth your time.   So last night I broke out my new watercolors to test them on my skin. My hand is still partially green, but that's a good sign because it took so damn long to GET it that way. My family still has no idea of my intentions to greenify myself :D AND THEY WON'T FIND OUT. They just think Michael/Hillary/I are using watercolors in our skit because we're ridiculous, foolish teenagers with no lives.   I don't know, I'm having the most terrible writer's block lately. I wrote a song last night though... I think I'll post it out of lack of other material. HERE IT IS, written at 3 in the morning:  "3 AM"  too late, too long you're pushing me around the bend now close my eyes cause what the hell am i doing wrong all my charms are failing me and i just don't see how to break the walls of your mind  chorus:  cause baby i've been trying to get down deep inside and everything i try becomes more tears to cry you don't seem to care about a thing that i do baby what's it gonna take what's it gonna take ... to get to you?  indifference confuses me and makes me wonder who are you and who am i baby if you loved me would you be this way and could you love me as bad as i love you?  -repeat chorus-  final: my thoughts revolve around you and you can't tell and if you can why do you hide it so well?  -repeat chorus-   Yep. So there's my late-night ramble song. The tune is still a bit fuzzy and I only wish I knew more about guitar (and actually had one). And I'm not that good on piano to compose, so... *makes sound of firework whistling to the ground*

      Blah, blah, blah. I saw Intolerable Cruelty today and really liked it. George Clooney is so funny and HOT and Catherine Zeta-Jones is so COOL.... know what? Screw blondes. She's beautiful. There is no one prettier than Catherine Zeta-Jones. I promise.  Guh - well, today I wrote a Tzeitel fic. Rather exhausting. But it was about if she had been forced to marry Lazar Wolf instead of Motel. I love this girl to death though, so it sucked doing it to her. But it was an idea I've had for awhile. Just ask if you want to see it.   Nothing is going on! I need to do something. Bleh. Life is sooo very dull. I think it's the absence of Michael/Hillary. And the fact that somebody should be calling me on the phone and hasn't yet and I'm starting to go into aortic fits of heartbeatingfasterfasterfaster every time the damn thing rings. Please call; at this point, the suspense is killing me and GAH!!!

      If I were an actress, and an interviewer was to ask me what I thought about the war in Iraq, I would likely reply, "Why are you asking me? I'm just an actress. I act. I don't know shit." Grrr. I hate you, Gwyneth Paltrow. And you, Jennifer Aniston. And you, lead singer of Coldplay. I don't hate you, Johnny, because you're a smart guy anyway and you're allowed to have opinions. Unlike your fellow moronic contemporaries.   Well, they can have opinions, but why don't they just SHUT UP AND ACT?!  I went golfing today. It was a practice thing and I did somewhat badly but made it to 100 yards. Go me. I also went rock climbing the other day - THAT was the most strenuous thing I think I've ever done. It was really cool and unique, though... I could begin to like it if I had more access to it.   I love art. I love the fact that anybody could think up some brilliant beautiful thing in their head and then have the genius to get it out and down perfectly. And it's so deep and fulfilling and moving... and there's that sense of happiness at bringing something totally original and creative into the world. Something, some part of you. Some different beautiful THING. Making the world just a little bit richer and vibrant and colorful.  So you see, I might not know much of the technical aspects of art, but I think I've got the whole soul thing down pretty well. I'd have to like art or I couldn't like or write about Alexei (who is my favorite guy. I've never loved a character quite so much and I love doing things to him).   I might as well talk about my story here, seeing as nobody has to read it if they don't want to/get bored, and I'm anxious to talk about it.  Spoilage is very possible, so if you haven't read it all, don't read on.  Hmm... I dearly love all the characters in their own way. If I don't like a character, it's painfully obvious.   I try and give each important character a conflict or backstory, something to occupy their lives and keep the reader interested and caring about them. Take Alexei, for instance, who is probably the best example of this. He's had a rough life - he never knew his father and his mother ditched him with his artist uncle at a young age. I'm really not sure how much I'm going to reveal about anybody, because I might use some of this stuff in the second half. Alexei had to steal when he was younger, but not frequently... he developed a charming way and had decent manners. He was quite bright and motivated to become a good painter like his uncle was. Turned out to be a pretty good kid - enough for Violetta to come along and fall in love with him.   She likes his wild and his charming, shy side. She likes the wildly varying time she has with him and the whirlwind of doing something different than her boring, sheltered rich life.   Eventually they develop into the people they are (or were). Violetta is a bit more cynical due to her father's disownment and the sudden hardship she was forced into. Alexei is more stubborn, liking control, and more of a worrier/cynic. He never got the son he wanted, except for the one who was stillborn (and named after him). Still, Alexei and Violetta love each other exactly the way they did at the beginning of their courtship - they've just gotten used to each other... and how they've changed.  Aleks is used to being shunted away from the spotlight by her pretty, older, smarter, more talented, interested-in-art-and-her-father's-favorite sister. Only her mother really encouraged her, and she too had much time invested in Natalia. Natalia was the perfect one, and Aleks was just... Aleks. She doesn't know what she wants out of life yet or what SHE is really good at. She was brought up to believe what is worthwhile and she doesn't happen to be good at any of it. In the second half I'm going to explore more of what Aleks's talents are and how she'll use them in the future.  Natalia's flirtatiousness and secret daring got her into trouble. She's not sure if she's ready for marriage or children yet, or if Kamen is really even the one for her. She questions herself constantly. Meanwhile, she tries to keep of a facade of beauty and perfection, of respectability, when really she feels (and almost is) like trash. Still, she was brought up to have good manners and morals, and she has the right ideas. She just has to rise above what she's done to her life with poise and grace. This is a huge conflict for her.  The decision to kill Violetta was a last minute one. I worked around it for so long and decided it would be best for the story if she was killed. It would make Alexei's attempt at suicide make more sense. It would make the story go smoother. However, it did present a difficulty when deciding why Aleks would rush to Vlad's or why Vlad would even bother to go to Alexei. I'll try and get that explained here.   Vlad knows what happened to Natalia when she tried to step outside the box of her father's rules. He'd rather it not happen to Aleks, so he'd like to get Alexei's permission to have a relationship with Aleks and get that out of the way instead of getting Aleks and himself into trouble. Make sense? Yeah, I hope...   Vlad is also interesting to me, but also very difficult to write. He's smart and witty, and for some reason I'm terrible with comebacks unless I try to write in a very spontaneous way or edit something in later. Sometimes I do have little bursts of banter that I learned to discover in drama class, but that's not the point. He's hard to do.   He's also had a rather hard life - he never really knew his father except for a few brief, likable memories. Count Peter Kovachev was a pretty cool guy. His mother used to be really sweet before she lost her husband and went a little off the wall. Peter kept her under control, and now that's Vlad's responsibilty. He does not relish it - loves his mother but would rather her be a mother than someone hardly there.   For awhile, I considered that maybe there could be something between Natalia and Vlad. He probably liked her at some point and thought, in modern terms, that she was hot - but way out of his league because she was a couple years older. This was back at the beginning when he was just a conceited slacker.  I think Aleks was the one who helped him grow out of that. He realizes what a sweet, cool girl this is and gradually calms down in his quest to figure her out and come to the point of loving her. He also comes to realize that her animosity to him is really because of his attitude and he works to change that image she has of him. (Vlad's psyche is really hard to write as well.) He changes his self-destructive ways and decides he'd rather help others.   I think they're pretty suited for one another, though sometimes I wonder if a Natalia/Vlad thing would've been more spicy. Now, I think Vlad would really do anything for Aleks because he has so much loyalty to her and her family. He's gotten over his protective shell of indifference. Sonia he doesn't care for because she's boring. Aleks has opinions and things, and he likes that hidden, spunky potential she has. In the second half, I want to write about how Aleks's opinions and Vlad's opinions can collide because of their separate social classes. I don't think Vlad cares much for his wealth but will utilize it for his own purposes. I don't see him as having much loyalty to the government or rich people in general (as seen by his attitude to his grandparents). Yet he doesn't want to see Aleks get hurt for her anti-government thoughts.   Many comparisons can also be drawn from Aleks/Vlad and Violetta/Alexei. The beginning letters of the names, for one. Violetta and Vlad come from wealth, Aleks and Alexei from poverty. I think Aleks might come to Alexei for advice in instances where she and Vlad disagree. Aleks doesn't have her mother anymore (who she did confide in occasionally); Natalia is busy with her own family and only has some time to listen. So that leaves her with Alexei and Vlad.   The relationship between Aleks and her father is very crucial to the story, and I think it was Hillary who really pointed out that Alexei is the central character. A lot of things square back to him. He carries his presence even when not in the scene. He's a prominent figure. Alexei might be busier with conventions/exhibitions and traveling to them, but he'll still have a lot to do with his recent boom of commissions and such. He'll be around for Aleks when she needs him. The two will probably be a lot closer in the second half.   Aleks will carry many more responsibilities, ones that Natalia and her mother had previously and are no longer there to care for. Many of them involve making sure Alexei stays focused and takes care of himself. Organizing, paying rent, keeping the house up... everything. She'll balance her job, her relationship with Vlad, helping Natalia with her children, her house, and her father. To top it all off, developing a new talent.   Kamen was a minor, almost unseen figure in the first draft I wrote. I wrote him in as more of a character in the second. You'll see much more of him in the second half of the book. He's a drifter, a no-good, but he's motivated and ambitious. He realizes the mistake he's made with Natalia, but even if the marriage goes completely sour he'll work to fix it because he believes he can build out of anything. He's going to have love for his children enough to make things work, even if they aren't. It's going to be a painful, tough road, but it'll work out for him.   Wow. Um... can't think of anything else to ramble about at the moment. I'll shut up...

      Here follows the epic tale of my trip to the Outer Banks. It's really, really, really long. I will not force you to read it - only if you have nothing better to do.  GLOSSARY SU: Sibling Un SD: Sibling Deux BSU: Bitchy Sibling Un SBSU: Still Bitchy Sibling Un Inevitable: Sunburn v.: very   SATURDAY, JUNE 5, 2004  1:41 PM. Driving through Van Wert. Many colorful chairs sitting out on neighborhoods that look suspiciously like downtown Fort Wayne. With about fifty more liquor stores. Apparently there's about to be some sort of parade to-do. This town is even less exciting than ours. And oh, look! Cornfield!  This morning SU went to Indy and had a gym routine choreographed for her. Wasn't All That Jazz *sigh* Too bad; I might've come to see that. She won't hush about it. Luckily she's sleeping.  During this presumably nine hour car ride I have music, books, and writing to keep me completely occupied. I suppose I ought to lay out the itinerary for you. We're driving to Hagerstown, PA, to get to a nice little Holiday Inn. My aunt, uncle, and cousin from Indy will possibly meet us there. We'll stay the night. Then, we'll go down to MD and see Mount Vernon, THEN get to the Outer Banks. After that, I have no idea other than The Inevitable (i.e. Laura Gets a Very Bad Sunburn).  3:40 PM. Blah, blah, blah. SCENE: Me in backseat in tanktop and still wet hair, surrounded by STUFF. Most of it's not mine, which is surprising. Sibs in front of me, speaking in loud, shrill, squeaky tones. SD is playing with the map book (dropping it) and complaining about past injuries.  According to five well-placed signs, we just missed Brice Road. Last time I checked we were in Columbus, Ohio. I looked up all the locations mentioned in RENT and apparently they're all there.  Dad sitting placidly in driver's seat with sunglasses and sandals. He has his Hootie and the Blowfish CD in and it's on repeat. This is the second time through. I suppose if I said something he would change it, but nobody likes my CDs anyway.  Now they're eating carrots. I'm having one. *munches* Good God, I feel like a hamster.  He turned the radio on, yay! We have such good communication.  I don't even know what Mom's doing. I'm sitting two seats directly behind her. SO glad I have the back to myself. I'm sick of those two already. They keep telling me I have to sleep on the cot. I don't WANT to sleep on the damn cot. I want a bed.  SU has hung the bag of carrots from the clothing hook by the window. I pity the poor travelers who drive past and see small, orange objects hanging from the window.  Scenery very dull. I'm going away to do something else.  5:30 PM. Saw funky bridge and went under small Wheeling Tunnel.  SU: Whoa, look at those mountains!  MOM: Just reinforces how ugly our state is.  SU: Too bad glaciers came and scraped us flat. (Proceeds to explain this to SD, who doesn't care.)  7:26 PM. Stopped at Bob Evans a bit ago. Pennsylvania seems to be a very clean state. I like this.  I have a fear. It seems that every time I go out of town something terrible happens. I pray for Hillary.  SUNDAY, JUNE 6, 2004  9:15 AM. No Inevitable yet. Will be.  I had a thought during breakfast... [insert future blog entry here which I will post when I have nothing else to talk about.] Well, I'm done for today. Except that I'm ... [insert blog entry I've already posted when I had nothing else to talk about.] Back to my trip.  We apparently went through WV twice without my knowledge. And Hagerstown is actually in MD. Go figure. In about two hours we'll be at Mount Vernon. Anyway, we got in the Holiday Inn - tried to reach aunt's family but couldn't. Clerk told us they were there.  Went to our room - 132 - and dropped. It was 11 PM their time, 10 ours, so we got ready for bed. I had to share with SU. It was horrible. She wouldn't switch sides with me until my dad forced her. She lay right on the middle edge of her pillow and told ME to scoot over. I was half off the bed anyway, so I kept pushing HER. It just sucked. Dad told me I said "Ouch" twice in my sleep. Somehow I don't think I was sleeping. Didn't sleep at all. Woke up at 6:10 our time, 7:10 theirs. Probably b/c of SU. Annoying child.  Did I mention we listened to Wicked in the car? I started with Defying Gravity (just to secure my position) and got a mini-applause out of them at end. Did not dare request RENT. Want to keep head attached to neck.  Got dressed, blah blah blah cakes. Went down for breakfast (continental!), had coffee to perk me up... finally met Aunt Rose, Uncle Dan, and Sam coming in to eat.  I began to slowly get the impression that all the people in the room were spies. They kept LOOKING. They sat and stared at everyone. One guy's ring seemed to be oddly tilted - camera, obviously. There were random sunglasses sitting on a table - another camera. Eventually I think Ring Spy intimidated all the others away. Him and his bodyguards, yeah. Freaks.  So now, here I am in my aunt's car. Sam switched me. They're watching Looney Tunes: Back in Action on their portable DVD player. I'm sure missing LOADS. I'm just on RENT and writing. I can't remember ever going to DC. Whoo. Just hope nothing blows up. :-P Gah. Bye for now.  12:44 PM. Headed out to find fast food for almuerza. (Just assume I'm listening to RENT on headphones during half the entries.)  Well, Mount Vernon is very nice - 8000 acres of unadulterated HISTORY. Yes, it is cool.  My father commented that SU would be sleeping in the stable and me in the slave quarters. SD was not mentioned. This does not bode well for her. There were servants' quarters/hall - very modest, fake food sitting out.  From there, we passed into the mansion (couldn't take pics), in which we were told Washington decorated everything. Picked the paintings, patterns, furniture, everything. We saw the bedroom where the Marquis de Lafayette stayed once. (If anyone whose brain isn't painfully short-term-oriented remembers more than his name, tell me.) Many nice bedrooms. Saw his AWESOME study - he had a swivel chair! :) And a really big globe. He actually sat at that desk and did stuff. *everyone says "Whoa...."*  But there was one dining room in particular where the wallpaper was comparable to a BP station. Pea. Green. Just that bad. Gah.  Took a few nice pictures outside, went down, saw old tomb, wharf, and new tomb. It feels very awkward taking a picture of George Washington's coffin/grave thing. Very guilty.  Went to a nice little history tent, played games, etc. I read about writing materials and tried to decide if Anamaria was literate or not. Yes, I do spend time thinking about these things. Found out quill pens & slow-dry ink. Quick stop at gift shop and now we are back on the road, still looking for food. Rent on Finale A... :)  2:28 PM. I hope I never get old and buy license plates that say LOVE GFT.  2:29 PM. And I connived my dad into putting in Wicked again. Luckily he didn't remember what number 7 is. Hee. We're on Defying Gravity right now - finale!  2:33 PM. Hah. I am evil. *is taking advantage of mother sleeping and asking dad to flip all over CD*  2:47 PM. Should I be surprised that SU knows half the words to 7 &amp; 11?  2:50 PM. I would rather see Taye Diggs than our current Fiyero. Taye can sing better. I have proof! *taps RENT CD lovingly*  3:17 PM. I'm starting to fear my CD will burn out from overuse.  3:32 PM. Just passed exits to Yorktown, Williamsburg, and Jamestown. Another day. *has snuck RENT reference in* I'll be doing that a lot.  4:01 PM. *listens to POTC recording* I'm in an underwater tunnel, isn't it thrilling. Walls brick, long side lights, ah, we see light. Under the seeeeeea....  4:14 PM. Passed shop Michael would probably like... Ye Old Mystique - Shop for Spiritual and Religious Supplies. Voodoo, baby, voodoo!  4:52 PM. SD insists that we are in Kitty Hawk. We aren't. We're just PASSING all these cities today, aren't we?  I'm about 2/3 through the Anamaria fic, which is tentatively titled "Borrowed Without Permission." Sibs getting to obnoxious stage. Part where they read all signs out loud, mock me, and make rude noises. At least they aren't touching me.  5:04 PM. Why does this old Jewel song only come on when I'm single?  5:25 PM. I'm going to post the link to my Anamaria story here, when it's there. BRIDGE! YAY! This is how you get to the island. Wright Memorial Bridge.  Just think... once there might've been pirates on this ocean. Maybe touched the same water. *is lost in fantasy* SD singing laxative commercial *dies* I'm yawning a lot. Coffee/coke wearing off.  All these houses are on stilts - v. funny. RENT! There's a RENT SIGN!! Anyway. It's for floods & the like. Wow. This IS v. funky.  5:47 PM. So. Dilly. We're supposed to be able to see both sides of this island - the sound and the ocean. Sound = water between NC and Outer Banks. Ocean = duh.  Ooh, pool ... in glass.  Pulling into driveway of house. SD won't shut up about bodily functions. Bye!  LATER. No clue what time it is. Have locked self in room - will explain.  This house is v. bizarre but cool. We pulled up to the garage and went in - there were several noodles and a boogey board. Walked in. Small room w/ two couches, games, and TV... on other side was stairs - we all go up. Come to this big maze-y mass of bedrooms.  1) Two sets of bunk beds  2) One room with twin beds (mine! hah!)  3) Two rooms with master beds and all  Fun stuff. Closets and bathrooms and all. We go up yet another flight of steps and come to biiiiiig place. Kitchen, living room, porchy thing, loft, table, ee!! Some movies on VHS (but I have Pirates, MWAHAHA), many tables/chairs/stuff.  Currently am locked in MY room b/c SU wants to SHARE. Me. No. Share. Me PRIVATE and I refuse to share another room with her. My old house was torture enough. Grrr.  The original reason was that SU was going to invite Sam in to jump on these incredibly bouncy plaid beds. Again. No.  Did I mention that there are decks EVERYWHERE? One has a deck and a porch swing. And there's a jacuzzi/exercise machine indoors. Finding many mysterious locked doors. Cannot figure out. Mother keeps saying she's lost. She's lost every trip we go on. I'd hate to see her go camping seeing as I am the Queen of Getting Lost in Nature b/c It All Looks Vaguely the Same.  Sibs/cousin going on spider egg hunt. Happy Easter. At least they're killing them all. Other than that, my sister, my clock, and getting lost, there is only one real problem. THERE IS NO PENCIL SHARPENER. I've already written about as much as my journal for Indiana State Museum, don't know what the hell I'll do when the other six pencils die out. Maybe I'll switch to pen. I hate pen.  10:11 PM. (Their time) She's in my room. Oh, WELL. At least I'm not still going all Elizabeth Turner and having that dim lightbulb anymore. Although that would've been fun.  SU is griping that she doesn't have a pillow. Will go upstairs to find privacy until my shower turn.  Right. I am now on what is technically the fourth floor - a mini loft with four chairs and a table. Could be useful for cards if I had them.  Think my dad is getting tired of hearing someone yell "DAD!!" every five seconds. [Will Turner] Here they come. [/Will Turner] Stupid blighters. Right, well, fourth floor is MINE since I don't have my own room anymore.  Because second person POV is nice, and because writing about the ocean is somewhat of a requirement when you're keeping a vacation journal, I give you the following.  You walk along the rocky path, passing beach houses and the smell of grilling hamburgers. Before you is a set of wooden steps. From here, it looks like stepping off the edge means falling into the sky. You come closer, and you see the thin line of the ocean appearing and growing bigger and bigger, thicker. You reach the top of the steps and finally see the sand. It spreads across you like batter and it's sprinkled all over the steps. You reach the sand, and you and your sandals squish through it, until you take them off and go on alone. Your feet hit wet sand, and you clap across it, little holes of air appearing in the ground. The ocean flourishes before your eyes, blooming in waves of white foamy petals. They come roaring at you and you stand, waiting for them to reach you. Several times they brush your toes, but don't go beyond. Finally, you catch sight of a wave - a huge white foamy mass, pushing its way toward you. You let the cool water lap at your ankles and splash your knees. The delighted voice of your cousin yells "I got my shorts wet!" repeatedly. You? You're just glad to be here, looking out on the edge of the world.  I hope God doesn't mind terribly that I missed church. All there is here is a Methodist church. I suppose I'll pray myself to sleep. *Jack Sparrow salute to dad* Fourth floor is so relaxing.  I'm going to ask for a pair of scissors to try and whittle this off... then I'll probably end up writing and going to bed or watching a movie. Gooooooodnight.  MONDAY, JUNE 7, 2004  9:09 AM. I should point out I'm really not getting decent sleep - however rested I may feel. I have huge eye circles. Oh, and I sharpened my pencil with a kitchen knife. Going to change to bathing suit. We're going somewhere.  12:27 PM. I don't think Hillary will like my versions of Anamaria and Amelia. I wrote them into the world, not into us. I stayed true to the movie characters (or I hope I did). *sigh* So close!  I had Corn Chex for breakfast at about nine, and we all trooped out to the public indoor pool. It's pretty nice. It goes up to about five feet, so it's about four inches below my hair. Played volleyball, played gang up on your dad and uncle w/SU's assistance and try to hit them with beach balls (they started it), looked for diving sticks, etc, etc.  We all dried off, were forced to put on sunscreen, and started walking down to the beach. It was kinda cloudy and cold, and I brought my pirate story along because I didn't want to swim. Plus I figured it would be inspirational. Breeze, waves in the background, cinammon fields of sand under my toes.... Lunch!  4:46 PM. If nothing else, I'm getting Inevitable on my face. "I'm staying the week with my favorite uncle." There. I wrote it. He should be happy if he checks.  Oho, I forgot to talk about the necessary!!  If you ever come to the Outer Banks and pass Dianne Street, we are the house completely enclosed in trees. And we are grey.  Our current statues is Possibly Going on a Bike Ride, Then Dinner and Beach for an Hour.  Damn. I'm now stuck watching SD and Sam while everyone else goes on a bike ride.  SAM: (whisper to SD) Let's go and jump on the beds.  ME: Nope. Sorry.  SAM: Aww.  They're playing Life now. After I'm done with all this I'll put on Mask of Zorro again.  I feel very Anne Frank-ish, hanging out in a strange house with 8 people total, writing in a diary. Reading her diary makes me so comforted knowing I'm not alone. And I'm not psycho.  Well, after lunch, we went to a lighthouse - 200 something steps. I thought it was a little tiring, but SU wouldn't shut up about how easy it was. It's when I'm up that high that I remember why I'm afraid of heights. Took nice pics and stuff. before we went up, though, my aunt Rose decided she didn't want to b/c her leg hurt. She's my mom's sister, by the way. There was a worker sitting outside who asked us if we had a big group.   DAD: Seven. She (indicates aunt) isn't going, she has a bad leg.  ROSE: *tsk* Shut up...  DAD: Have you heard that excuse before?  GUIDE: Oh, it's one of the most common. Vertigo, sinus...  Anyway, after that we went (my family only) to this nearby bookstore. It was like paradise, really. It seems like forever since I went in one. I found this BOOK that my parents counted as a b-day present - "The Young Writer's Guide to Getting Published." EE!! Anybody is welcome to borrow it when I'm done.  The lighthouse was built 129 years ago (1875) - and they had another little building nearby that we also saw at Mount Vernon. This little gem is called the "necessary."  Which is my new word for bathroom. *smiles*  Good grief - feels weird. Must be result of the Inevitable. I'll have to change the name when I get it. Maybe the Hadit.  I need to stretch soon.  GAH! My cousin asked me to put in Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles because he can't reach the VCR. It won't WORK.  SAM: Let's watch the Stress Channel! Where one ordinary teenage girl gets frustrated by one VCR.  Later he amended it to the Frustrated Channel because I gave up.  We had Cosmos Pizza last night. Just sayin. Oh, I just skipped two pages in here. I wondered... And I forgot a sweatshirt and oversized T-shirt and received many sighs and exasperated looks. Hell, if Mrs. Talarico hadn't called and wanted me to babysit, I wouldn't have packed at all. Sleep is bliss. And my hand is starting to throb from where the pencil rests. OW.  6:26 PM. SAM: How can you just sit quiet in a corner and do stuff?  LAURA: I'm just cool like that.  SAM: Just weird...  Sam is 9 years old. He has buzzed blond hair and glasses. And he is incredibly hyper. He could have his own radio show commercial-free, that's how much he talks. But I doubt he could keep still long enough for that. The ironic thing is that as a toddler he did not speak. At all. He used sign language. He is a Pokemon/Digimon/trading card/video game/Yu-Gi-Oh! CHILD. I don't know how he and SD get along so well. She hates that stuff.  11:02 PM. Cannot figure out SU. One minute she is hyper and beeyatchy and the next she admits she's singing Defying Gravity. The only reasonable explanation is, as Kelsey so aptly puts it - HORMONES.  Or it could be that she does stupid, annoying things to get my attention. Still, for all my psych tricks I can't get to her. She won't shut up, she want -  HELP! THE LIGHTS ARE BEING TURNED OUT AND I CANT SEEE...  We played Boggle this evening after getting back from the beach. (I made a sand castle with the initals HG on top. Take a guess what that stands for. I took a picture.)  I think I have decent handwriting in the dark - but we turned on the small Elizabeth lamp so it doesn't matter. I kicked ass at Boggle until my mom showed up and started playing. And who the hell writes "invoke" on their paper? Only mom. See??? That's what I'm up against.  LAURA: Jeeenna?  SU: What?  LAURA: Do you have a boyfriend?  SU: No.  LAURA: Do you want a boyfriend?  SU: No.  LAURA: Why not?  SU: Because they're stupid.  LAURA: (pause) You might have a point. (pause) I'll think about that.  No offense to y'all or anything. You're not all stupid. I think I'm tired, but I'm running on adrenaline.  We briefly discussed trading Sam to the neighbors with the roof porch in exchange for several hand towels and soap (all of which we finally have), but it was dropped. I come from such a cruel family. No wonder I turned out like me.  SU wondered if our house would smell new again when we got back, and without meaning to I brought up what H and I discussed on our sleepover. Did not mention pillows. Mom thought it was funny.  Thank God I wrote her that note. I don't know how things would've worked out otherwise...  Note to self: Ask Brandon for POTC CD to burn... Well, it's about 11:30 their time... I'll read a bit, then GOODNIGHT!!  TUESDAY, JUNE 8, 2004  11:57 AM. SU acting like superior bitch. V. difficult to tolerate. Am in room trying to escape madness.  I woke up at 8:30 and walked in on conclusion of family meeting. Fake celebration commenced. Everyone except for my dad and I went to the pool and Dad said we could go on a bike ride. Got out blue-green bike with v. high seat, purple ill-fitting helmet and went out. There's a nice big blacktop path along the roads - we went about a mile or so, at one point had to cross road and came to townish bit. Nice little bookstore - Dad asked if I wanted to go in. Um, YES!  So we go in and I get a latte - dropped quarters and irritating men stared at me. Couldn't even find said quarters until Dad came and realized they had fallen onto a shelf instead of the floor.  Country music was playing. Dad read a book while I looked around and sipped coffee (very strong!). Not nearly as much new stuff as other bookstore. Thought about getting Diary of Anne Frank but Dad said it'd be hard to get home on a bike. Someday I'll buy that book. Having her birthday used to terrify me. It's just kinda weird.  There was a computer with high-speed internet you could use if you paid $4. Since it was 8 our time I figured no one would be awake to talk to anyway, and even then I wouldn't want to leave - like I do now. BUT.  Some news you do hear from the outer world - I heard about Reagan's death the first day. I happened to pick up part of the Style section of the newspaper and flip through. IDINA MENZEL WON THE TONY!! WHEE!!  11:51 PM. Will write about rest of day tomorrow - way too tired. Night.  WEDNESDAY, JUNE 9, 2004  10:00 AM. Or so I think. It's hard to tell time on the beach if it isn't noon. I'll start with yesterday. After our lunch, we drove out to Roanoake Island, home of the Lost Colony. You might remember this from our history class *takes on droll Mr. C style* A group of settlers from England set up a Virginia colony, the first of America. Technically it's the first, and Jamestown is the first permanent settlement. Virginia Dare was born there, the first American child. Only one problem: they all vanished. And still nobody knows what the ____ happened to them. Anyway *tone stop* that's why it's so famous.  The first place we stopped at was an aquarium. Note: I have visited Shedd Aquarium in Chicago and once you've been there, every other aquarium kinda pales in comparison. It was a very nice little place - I was fortunate enough to touch the bouncy, slimy soft back of a sting ray. It was actually rather terrifying trying to put your hand in the tank and watch the aggressive ones flapping their wings on the glass with little thunks. In honor of Hillary, I found several purple fish! And there were many others. Let's see... after that we headed to this thing called History Festival. Only it wasn't a festival, it was just history.  We were greeted at the entrance by a man in period clothing of 1585 (or whereabouts) - green leggings and a Robin Hood type hat. He was rather funny. Told us to tarry not, but to beware the swamp beset with biting flies. And I just kept thinking, Michael... I have found you a career. Someday - those green leggings... *goes off and snickers*  But it was nice. And we found our way outside to a small ship, the Elizabeth II. I practically scoured the place, looking at everything, in my POTC obsessive way. It was too big to be Anamaria's and too small to be the Black Pearl. Kind of a mini-Interceptor. I saw the post that swung around and Will hanging for dear life (I really need to learn the names of these things); saw captain's quarters and ship's quarters and everything. Mast and crow's nest and rigging. There was a cute guy with an adorable fake Irish accent (hard to tell it was, but it had to be) and an older guy who showed Sam, SU, and me how to tie three knots. Square, sheath, and double-sheath (spelling probably off). We got to keep the rope (mine is purple!). [Since then I have been unable to find it :(]  We realized that they were showing a movie, so we rushed over to watch it. It was about the Indians' reaction to the English settlers coming. Not a documentary - more of a drama. It was pretty well done, I was surprised. Except the little girl couldn't act, but she just had to ask questions so I don't blame her.  After that we went down to the settlement. Two guys were there as well - cute blond guy with Irish accent (a different guy), and a big guy with brown hair and glasses. We looked around at the tools and camp stuff. Got more interesting when Sam found a sword. Uncle Dan took a picture of him, and then I got the sword. Unfortunately this dictator has no idea how to hold specific swords. So I just held it in one hand and now we have a picture of a pigtailed teenager holding a sword with a ridiculous smile. I tried to scowl but failed.  CUTE IRISH GUY: Oh, very threatening, one-handed! That'll frighten the Spaniards away for sure.  [I just sorta smirked, partly cause HEWASSOCUTE and why would I want to frighten away my headquartering country?]  He asked how old everybody was - Mom said I was 15 (not yet!!).  CIG: 15? She'd be married. Nope, not yet. CIG: Can you cook? LAURA: Kinda. CIG: Can you clean? LAURA: Yeah! CIG: Can you teach? LAURA: Sorta. CIG: Have you learnt everything you can from your mother? MOM: (mutter) She thinks so. CIG: (incredulously) Then why aren't you married? [Ah, these adorable role-playing guys. I'm such a sucker.]  And apparently they threw Will Turner into apprenticeship right when they found him, because you had to be 11 or 12.  Last in this exhibit, we went to the actual museum. I saw a REAL cutlass and several boats, played around with a fake pirate pistol and found one thing that can only be expressed in a photograph. Will upload when I get the chance. Also, found a sign that said INDEED there were women pirates. Mwah.  There was also a duck shooting station. It occured to me just now that it was like shooting pigeons, except with a laser rifle. No satisfying crack. (In case you care, I have shot a real rifle. I'm terrible so far but would hopefully improve with practice.)  By the end I was starving. Everybody was. So we get out on the road. We saw a dude who was either a drifter, druggie, hobo, mentally ill, or all four. He was talkign to himself and looking at his tattoos and flexing his muscles. We stopped at a place called Big Al's and our food took FOREVER but it was awesomely good. But we had to eat quickly because we were on certain Dad-imposed time restraints. I had a burger/fries. The restaurant was 50's themed and had a huge private collection of Coke products. (It feels like I've been writing for AGES, gah.)  AFTER WE ATE, we went to see a play! *cheer* It was called The Lost Colony and the guy who wrote it has a Pulitzer. It's the first and longest running outdoor play ever (1937!!). It's told from the colonists' perspective. Language often difficult to grasp b/c of Shakespeare style. SD was lost. Then again she's only 7. The actors and their singing were quite solid and good, and the Indian dance was close to perfect. Liked it.  After it was over, we all waited for bows, but they never came. It was weird. All were incredibly exhausted when we got home, so we went to bed. Woke up again at 8:30 today - Sam wanted to watch Jurassic Park but the VCR is basically screwed.  So somebody (not me, actually) suggested POTC and I'm all, okay! and perked up... Sam seems to like it, good sign. Uncle Dan seems to like it, even better. He sensed I was a JD fan (now, how did he come to that conclusion??). He is a smart guy, very funny. Anyway - and my dad was willing to sit through it a second time. He took some of my friends and me to see it when it first came out. We're at the part where Liz is parleying herself over to the Black Pearl.  Put on sunscreen and came to the beach. It’s here that we did something fun – SD, SU, Sam, Rose, and me all stood in a line facing the beach sand. We were pretty far from shore. Anyway, you stand there and wait a second – and are suddenly brushed over by a wave! Sometimes you walk forward to avoid losing your balance (I have none) and sometimes it smacks you in the ass, and sometimes you are nearly knocked over by the force. And you feel the pull on your feet and the sand under you as it washes back out.  I should mention we had a speech about beach safety by (in my aunt’s opinion) a hot guy delivered to us at the aquarium. OMG – it’s 11:50. I’ve been writing for almost 2 hours. I ought to shut up – and now we’re going to the pool, whee! Swim till 12:20 and then eat. Be right back.  SOMETIME AFTER LUNCH. About to watch POTC again.  SOME MORE TIME. I think I’ve figured out why Jack walks the way he does – too much standing on the beach and being knocked over by waves. Time for Boggle. Mwah.  3:30 PM. Hah. I thought my mental clock was right. We played Boggle and I kept getting distracted by POTC, which was being watched by Dad and Uncle Dan.  Well, we went to the pool, and I got in b/c I was way overheated. Went in for diving sticks and then had inner tube races with SU. Went back, had lunch, watched POTC/Boggle and now I’m back at the pool writing. This chair is just plain gross.  [Insert yet another blog entry here. And then a big long spiel about Jack and Anamaria which I’ll type up someday and force you to read.]  Unbelievably, STILL no Inevitable. What I had before was just windburn. But with the Sunscreen Nazis hanging about, I’m not sure if I’ll even get red ears.  Going back to house to retrieve Anamaria story. I plan on editing… Amelia will get her own story someday. It’ll be Hillary’s Christmas present.  THURSDAY, JUNE 10, 2004  10:12 AM. About to go on bike ride with parents. Mom ASSUMED I wanted to go to coffee shop when I never said it and she already said no. And SU is SCARY at exaggeration. Just to enhance her stupid accusations, she makes things up. *is annoyed* Yes, I am “obsessed” with many things. But not like you think. I can live without them, and that is the difference.  11:00 AM. 6 MILES!! AGHK!!  My back, neck, and forehead are a little damp. I don’t get that much exercise, ever. Will go outside and fall into pool.  8:48 PM. *longs for some contact w/ somebody she’s not related to* I need my guys. And my girls. I am going to be so sore tomorrow. I’ll just dwell on HP and lounge in bed.  First of all, The Inevitable has arrived. On my legs, ears, and front. and it is making me tired and irritable. SU humming/singing DG again… gr… don’t make me hate it, girl…  Went to the beach and had much fun boogeyboarding in ocean. Read HP for a bit after lunch – then went to Kitty Hawk. What do you know. We did go after all.  Climbed up unnecessarily large sand dune/hill to see Wright Monument. Took pic. Went in v. small museum and looked at replica of airplane.  SU singing. Grrr. Jenny from the Block. I curse myself for ever burning that. And she should gimme my headphones back; I never said she could have em.  There. They’re MINE.  I didn’t know she liked my Rock Steady. Oh well. *listens* We had food at pizza place. Nearly got hysterical while there but calmed self. Went to meet Wards (cousin family) at sand dunes – “Jockey’s Ridge” as SU was kind enough to repeat 50,000 times. Went up barefoot – hard on feet but sand felt looovely. Soft, soft, soft. If it wasn’t about to storm, we would’ve stayed longer/gotten better sunset view. *sigh*  I’m tired and it’s only 8 Indiana time. I’m gonna be so off-schedule it’s not even funny.  I dearly wonder how the poor world is getting on without me. [/sarcasm]  FRIDAY, JUNE 11, 2004  8:14 PM. I don’t feel sorry for Bitch and I’m not speaking to my other four family members. If they really want to make my birthday suck, THAT’S THEIR FRICKIN PROBLEM.  SATURDAY, JUNE 12, 2004  9:02 AM. Happy Birthday to Mee!! The day when at 5 AM, this insane writer-Alias-coffee-freak was born into the equally insane universe. And I was apparently born on a Monday. I hate Mondays.  At least my dad understood… haven’t tried Mom, and BSU won’t listen. We’re going on a walk to the beach to see the waves. They’re supposedly huge.  9:18 AM. Don’t understand why they must make big ___ deal out of everything. Pisses me off. Might as well go back to sleep L  It sucks that they insist on doing this on my birthday. SUCKS!! I’m not sure about this. I might be 15 now, but it’s only been 4 hours and I’m still me. And I still cry about everything. I don’t know how I’m going to enjoy this day at all. And I think about my friends and I start to cry again because I miss them.  I’ve been thinking about my story in the past two days. I think I’ll end it with a parting in accordance to the theme. (Just a note to self.) Will probably do much brainstorming/sleeping on way home. *sigh*  I think I will go back to sleep, I’m already under the covers.  9:49 AM. It’s like B and thunderstorms. The worse I feel, the crazier the waves get. They’re ruining my birthday and they don’t even care and I can’t stand it L. And it’s all so stupid. They need to get over it. I don’t think I’m going to speak to them anymore unless I have to. It’s not worth wasting my time. *needs hug*  12:40 PM. Feeling better – went and rode bikes with Dad. Bought some stuff and went back to coffee place - got something called Mucky Duck. [The town we’re in is called Duck, by the way.] It was espresso, whipped cream, chocolate, caramel and other wonderful spirit-lifting stuff. See, the only problem is that right now, my tongue is SEARING with pain of being burned. *sticks it out and sucks air* Not pretty. But at least I feel better… less tired anyway.  Being civil to SBSU and Mom – not speaking to them much. Am determined to have semi-happy birthday. Have worked out agreement just now with SU. I will tell her when she’s bothering me and she will back off. V. simple and (hopefully) effective.  [NOT.]  Tongue still burns. Ohhh… *winces* Espresso is a wonderful thing, you know. I’m afraid that when I come back, Hillary will be standing in a pile of rubble and telling me everyone’s off killing each other. Then we can go to the movies :-P Everything bad seems to happen when I leave town!! Augh!! I can’t take the suspense. I want a detailed email explaining everything that went on while I was gone.  I have reached 72 pages in pink journal on this trip alone. That’s about 3 times as big as the Indy trip Chronicles.  Just remembered – the water was very clear yesterday, probably because of the storm. Uncle Dan, SU, Dad, and I were all in deeper water looking for shells. Found some very cool ones. Then we got out the GOGGLES! YAY! and swam around, scattering thousands of ugly little fish all over the place. Learned art of body surfing and watched Dad/Dan boogeyboarding (still can’t spell that.) Rather funny. One thing that is cool to do: sit underwater facing the beach and watch the waves roll over you. It’s so weird. A little line goes over you and moves you forward. And sometimes you see little crabs walking along under you.  ABOUT 2 PM. SU IS SCHIZO!! She walked up while we were walking to this dock where the Sound is. She’s all, I’m telling your b-day present – if you want to go see Harry Potter with your friends or something I’ll give you the $ for the ticket.  Unbelievable. And I’m like, um… that’s creative. Cause I couldn’t think of anything else to say, you know? So we walk (except for Dad and Aunt Rose) to look at the Sound. There was a little dock that we stood on and looked. The water was very brown and murky and lake-ish. Somebody had hung two cages on ropes – we pulled them up and both of them had three crabs each! Funky, big, blueish. Scares SD b/c they move like spiders.  There were two people sitting on a bench on the dock: older dude with gray hair, tan body, and no shirt – and other (I thought rather cute) young guy. Black, Elliot-length curly hair, green and gray t-shirt, cargo shorts and sandals. Didn’t say a word but was probably 17 or so. *sigh* I liked him. There are so many lovely guys on this island – I will have to live here someday. Tan Guy and Co. were from Pittsburg and TG and Dan talked… I stared at Curly Guy and then we went home. Sound was not very exciting.  When we got home, Aunt Rose was back and gave me part of my b-day present – FUDGE and a funny card. And she brought much more candy and things. That made me happy. She said she’d take me shopping if we go to Indy for Fathers’ Day. I think I know what I want… *smiles and thinks of Jack Sparrow’s lovely coverbox face* [Okay, so I didn’t get Pirates, but I’m still saving, dammit.]  It’s quite chilly out here. We’re sitting out on the beach for what is possibly the last time. The waves are HUGE. Overlapping each other, white foam everywhere, constantly growing – you can’t see a spot without a wave. Even at the very tip of the ocean that’s visible has little white spots appearing.  We saw a few dolphins one day. Far out but still there. Very few people are in the water right now, but most of them are male. That might say something. There are about four shades of blue on the ocean right now. Deep blue on the edge, green-blue, brown-blue, and murky green closest to me. But that one is partially concealed by white marshmallow foam. Dad flew a kite for awhile and Sam/SU have halfway buried themselves. I should mention the convo that was had on the way back from the Sound.  SD: I don’t want to get in the water. MOM: But you have to put on your swimsuit if you’re going to sit in the sand and build a castle. SD: I don’t want to build a castle. MOM: Then what do you want to do? SD: Sit on my towel and play with my hands.  See, as bratty as she can be, occasionally she can be almost cute. Like when we were on the dock she said she’s going to call me Bubbo. I kept calling her Bubba and then we decided she’d only be Bubba at the pool. Some. Times. She’s. Just. Cute. Like a bunny.  We all scooted our towels and beach mats back because the water’s getting even higher. A kite nearly fell on me. Most people are just sitting and staring at the ocean. I’m wearing my dad’s t-shirt over my bathing suit … I’m very cold. I think we’re having pizza tonight… SU asked what I wanted and ran to tell Wards. I think she was prepared to whine to me if I didn’t pick it, but I want it anyway.  I’m out of things to say for now… going to relax in sun.  LATER. Took walk on beach with SU and Wards. Sand sticking to my toes. Hee. Wow. Water rising. *sigh* Sam is going to bury my feet. *frown* I’m hungry. But there’s no food. Goodbye for now.  5:18 PM. I devoured a bowl of Cheerios an hour ago – I was almost shaking from hunger… then I read my aunt’s two magazines… Allure and Good Housekeeping, joy. At least JG had the cover story. But Kelly Ripa is everywhere and I’m so sick of her.  Everyone (excluding me, mom, Aunt Rose, and Uncle Dan) is at the pool. I am becoming restless – there is NOTHING to do… and anything I could do, I want to save for the drive. We won’t be home until 12 midnight. I think I’ll screw myself out of a lot of sleep so I’ll spend most of the boring drive out of it.  I do have 4 dollars and that coffee shop is still open and it still has Internet access. I’ve gone nearly a week without a computer (or church, gah… will have to go to confession) and it’s finally taking its toll. I keep thinking about all the stuff I have to catch up on and do – that computer is so mine on Monday. If I don’t eat – you’ll know why.  Kidlets are back. Doubt they’ll be interesting. At least they add noise. (I can’t believe I just said that.)  An hour or so before we go to have pizza. Don’t think I can stand the boredom – at least I have something to write on …  Dan is watching golf, can’t watch TV, there’s no DVD player in Rose’s room and I think she’s watching something too. And I’m still cold.  10:22 PM. Well, we went to Stone Oven Pizza – yumness. And after that we went and looked around the shops. I swear, I find the strangest places. Every single one of those shops must’ve had tarot cards. Michael, you would have been in heaven… went back to Wings store and got two ankle bracelets for souvenirs. Meehee.  *SIGH* Aunt Rose turned on the TV around 9 and Grease was on. Apparently she owns the record. Her and my mother, augh, sang every song we saw. It was just so terrible! and SU was there too… this birthday has been absolutely schizo… goodnight *is 15*  SUNDAY, JUNE 13, 2004  8:18 AM. (our time! whoo!) *is very tired* We’re rolling out the garage of our home, Summer Daze… going down Dianne Street… going down Duck Road…  Wow. This vacation has been action-packed, for lack of a better adjective. The Wards left about ½ hour before we did, because we were waiting on the dishwasher.  We’re sitting next to a big black Hummer in the rental office parking lot. [We were there when we arrived in Duck, too. We were looking for a place to eat, but everything seems to close before 8! I don’t remember what we ended up eating. Also, Aunt Rose and I were on a fudge hunt one evening… it was great.]  The name of the neighborhood is Northpoint.  9:56 AM. We’re on a bridge going through Chesapeake Bay. Radio has frizzled out.  11:04 AM. SU and SD smacking each other with waterbottles… I sit staring at the highway procrastinating. Doubt I could concentrate anyway. SD’s laugh is v. grating.  3:52 PM. I will not get motion sickness, I will not get motion sickness, I will not get motion sickness.  7:36 PM. We ate at Cracker Barrel tonight and I obsessed over the peg puzzle for the entire meal. I think I do have a touch of OCD – or else I’m just terribly perfectionistic. But they tend to go hand in hand.  We have listened to Josh Groban, Clint Black, Matilda on CD recording, How to Eat Fried Worms on CD recording, and now Kenny Chesney. Three of those are my mother’s and combined, I’ve heard them all more than Wicked and Rent combined. Yep – that. Damn. Much. I’m dying to listen to Rent now, but I’m nearly out of battery juice. Kenny’s okay for now.  My mom, thank the heavens, gave me her book she finished. Anna Quindlen’s “Object Lessons.” It’s rather good, but I think I would enjoy it more if I could stop thinking about the computer.  Our hamster has taken refuge with our neighbors, Brenden and Claire Murphy. We’re only halfway through Ohio and I’m fairly itching to be back home…  Sometimes when you lie on the beach with your eyes closed, you can see the waves.  8:48 PM. V. dark… can’t see what I’m writing. Storming like hell… cleared enough to see road but still amazing. Trying to listen to Rent but storm droning it out.  10:10 PM. Back through Van Wert and so v. tired. Want to go to bed.  10:57 PM. Rolling along dear old St. Joe Ctr. Road. Can’t see a bloody thing! *smiles* The Wyndemere sign!! Whoo!! Rolling… *waves to Hillary and Diana*  Oh, hello, house J  You’ve been a great audience, really… goodnight!!

      I am officially a Jones addict.  This is not entirely my fault. A good friend of mine named Paul Ensley bought me and Sam bottles for our math pizza party (Crushed Melon - tastes like Skittles) and I was a moth, drawn to the flame... and now the fire has ceased, and I am a butterfly crushed on the wheel!! [/Chicago] So today I had to go to Naked Clay Cafe and fulfill my addiction. I had Berry Lemonade. For some reason it was good when I was drinking it, but it wasn't satisfying... I always felt like I needed more - when I was drinking it and when I wasn't.  Sounds kinda like life. Mind you, I didn't come up with that metaphor myself. Credit to Paul Ensley for the whole "relationships are like beverages" thing. It's very interesting, actually. Bug him about it, will you?  Oh, and I've started a bottle collection. I figure I will collect so many that I can barely fit them in my room and then take them all out to be recycled. Cause I'm a good little consumer like that.  Now, onto my Q of the M.... forgive and forget. This expression confuses me. I realize the intent is to say "Forgive people for what they've done to you and don't hold it against them." But - if you completely forget whatever the mistake was in the first place, what's to say it won't happen again? We're supposed to learn from our mistakes AND forgive and forget. FORGETTING usually doesn't result in LEARNING, and I should know. Just think of science class, for Bob's sake.
