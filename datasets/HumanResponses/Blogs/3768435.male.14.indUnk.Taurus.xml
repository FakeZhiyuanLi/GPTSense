      i understand that i have to deal with it plus i am much better beacuse it's her lose not mine. i still have feeling for her but im not just gonna be thrown away for the summer, im made of stronger stuff than that, i can get through this. plus im single and i dont care. so thanks for everyone who helped me. hey im ok. stuff like this happens to everyone. let it go. you may find this strange but a nice walk will really clear your thoughts, and also the song float on helped beacuse its true we will all float on ok. By the way i dont want to tie her down she needs to try out other guys and she is gonna realize how good i was to her its her. im not a toy and she will realize that she cant have it all. so im just gonna sit back and let it all drift away and be happy. not let this bring me down think of it as a bigger step in life not a step back but a step foward. me and ben wildt hung out today we are both going through somewhat of the same thing but it helps to be with someone who is going through the same thing. and also we went and did one of those cocktail fire things and it was cool we ran off and than went through this private roda and into someones back yard and met this lady who said to go away and she is calling the cops. and when we get back she is talking to my dad and its all a JOKE!!! what the heck. well everyone this is just another chapter in the Shane Norman history book. and next year will be great.

      well today has been the worst day i have ever experienced, seriously i havent been through much but today tops it. well today is going normal im playing guitar talking to people on the computer and stuff like that. i was talking to people about how great alicia was and how much i loved her and how i miss her and cant wait for her to come back from camping. when she calls me(this makes me very happy). and she says we should break up for the summer, now she had been wanting to do something like this but not so serious for a while now and this catches me totally off guard. i ask her why and she says "i cant be in such a long relationship at such an early age." its about 8 or 9 PM when this happens, and at that point im bawling my eyes out asking why over and over. THIS DOSENT MAKE SENSE TO ME!!! She says we can get back together at the end of summer, but i dont want to be thrown away than picke back out again. So than i am sad and she says i have to go and i say "fine" all rude like than say im sorry for saying that. she says "you'll get through this, trust me" and than hangs up. i run downstairs to find the book with her mom's cell phone number in it and call back only to find out she went for a walk. i get a call 30 minutes later from her dad saying she wont call me back and how she is upset about things and i cry on the phone with her dad their. so i cry all night, i try to go to sleep but i cant sleep when im crying. i try to get my mind off of it but i cant so i come downstairs and write this. why is this happening im miserable and i hope i die i feel like shit. paige is the only one who trys to make me feel better. and i just want to talk to Alicia so i can get things straight. paige told me alicia is always mad at me every other week and how she hurt me alot this time, i still have it in me to say it's worth being hurt to stand at her side. i still love her more than anything but i guess i have no one to hold anymore i feel so empty.

      uh so far i have opend my eyes to find myself in the same place i was when i closed them, i enjoyed my trip downstairs to the breakfast table where i found myself eating 2 snak packs of pudding yum!!! the kind that goes chocoalate vanilla chocoalate. i stumbled my way to the computer and began my daily browsing of the website neopets and talking to people on aim. sigh summer is boring nobody will hang out with me. if anyone wants to i live in the house that contains the phone number (425) 255-1428. i have signed up for this now i am cool. hmmm what to say. jflasdjflsfjlsdfjsdlfjsdlkf.

      Sorry i forgot to talk about yesterday so today is double the post fun well yesterday i went to a movie with my friend from IMS named Caitlin Saunders and her friend Jessica and boyfriend(who wears gay clothes) were there as well we saw the movie "The Terminal" and it was really really good i recomend it i also recomend fehrienheit 9/11 that i saw on monday of this week. my mom and her dad came to see it as well so i couldnt have as much fun at a theater as i normally would. but i did get 4 dollers by saying i got food.   today i played guitar and worked on my song i mean what else do i do. how often am i not attached to it when anywhere in my home. so than i played some more. took a shower played neopets and played guitar at the same time, but not in the shower mind you. than i ate dinner, shaved, played guitar, and than came on here and said what i just said. interesting day for Shane Norman. Now on to how i feel. today i got a big dose of Alicia and Shane memories which i didnt like at all, seeing as she broke my little heart and now im getting over it. im doing pretty wel actually i havent cried for 2-3 days, so thats good. i could use a hug but oh well. shane is doing a ok
