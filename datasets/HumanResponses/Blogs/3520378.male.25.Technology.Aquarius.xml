      Ah, another Sunday night to reflect on the buffoonery of a weekend.  Friday night was Tabitha's b-day party at Kendall's.  It was a night that included a very fast and efficient waitress (strangley hot as well).  It continued with equal parts of vodka and tonic in massive quantities.  Drunken conversations about politics, college, the future, and............hmmm, probably other stuff that was highly emotional and without much intelligence.  Good times!  Meandered home at about 430 after stops at the Dark Horse and Seiwerts.  Saturday night got Sushi and a slew of other expensive Japanese quisine at some place on Southport, then onto Irish Oak's with Fugazy and Dibona.  A nice chill evening overall.  Gosh, this weekend was more or less uneventful.  No dumb stories, no crazy stories, just your run of the mill weekend nights.  Oh well, they can't all be trips to the moon.

       Tonight's adventure was sponsored, in part, by Zebrahead.    Bj, Wolf and I made the obligatory appearance at a great rock show at the House of Blues.  It sure is nice to be able to kick it with a good band on a Wednesday night in the city!  They were decent as usual, the lead singer always puts on a hilarious performance.  But going to these rock shows, especially ones like Zebrahead, sure do make me feel old.  A 25 year old is an old man at these shows, where the majority of the crowd is in HS.  I probably threw stuff at people that were as old as me when I was their age.  And whoever got hit probably deserved it.  A good old fashioned punk (though poppy) show doesn't need someone slaving for the man screwing up their atmosphere.  Ha!  Fuck it, I always have a good time at those things.  I like to think I will continue with a decent concert schedule for at least a few more years.  Probably until they won't let me in when they see my ID.  They'll probably think I'm a narc.  Probably already do.  Shit, it really doesn't seem  that  long ago when Stevenson, Bob and I were jamming at our first Foo Fighters show at the Riviera, it was.......MY GOD it was over 8 years ago.  1996.  Shit.  That shit was fantastic: getting that nervous, thrilling, spine-tingling feeling when the band that I was watching was up there ripping ass up, and that was my only thought and concern in the world.  It's always been a huge release for me, seeing a rock show with my friends.  Quite drug like.  And now I'm holding on for dear life, hoping that my friends don't drop out before I feel it's time.  But I think that time is approaching, since I have to almost beg most of them to go see a band that I want to see.  Ah, c'est la vie.  It was bound to happen sometime.   But I guess I will just have to enjoy my times at shows that are still to come, while I'm still young.  ROCK AND FUCKING ROLL!!!!!!!!!!!  Good times.

      I finished reading Ayn Rand's 'Atlas Shrugged' last night.  Great book, I really enjoyed it.  It really puts forth some strong and hard ideas to contemplate.  The one that is giving me serious struggles is her view on religion.  Obviously I have heard the argument before that faith and religion is for the weak, for those that need that crutch in life.  But her argument was that man's life and morals are based on his ability to think and reason, which is the opposite of taking something explicitly on faith.  I am seeing many contradictions between faith and reason now.  All our lives we are told that we are supposed to use our minds, to think and be the best that we can be.  Use Your Head!!!..............Why don't you think?  But when it comes to God and religion, we are just supposed to turn off our minds and not think or try to explain?  It seems like a giant contradiction.  Humans were blessed with the ability to think and reason, given to us by God.  But we aren't supposed to think and reason about God????? Hmmmmm....... supposedly contradictions do not exist.  So it is either one or the other, or I am thinking on the incorrect premises.  This is messing with my mind.    But there were other great points as well.  One idea that came to me indirectly from the book is:  Why do people wear their suffering like badges of honor?   I know i've tried it before, its a plea for pity.  "Man, I've had it so much harder than you,   you  never had to deal with the shit that I have,  you  have no idea!"  Who gives a shit.  Hey man, that's too bad that you've had it rough.  But guess what:   So have I.  So have most people out there.  Suck it up and lets go out there and kick some ass together.    Wear your happiness on your sleeve.  Wear your success on your sleeve.  Wear your pride on your sleeve.  Your accomplishments.  Your ethics.  Something positive instead of negative.    Well, onto 'The Rum Diary'.  Probably not gonna get any brain busters out of that one.  Maybe an urge to drink rum on the rocks and kick it on a beach somewhere, but no brain busters.

      I am stuck in the pleasant present.  Pleasant and content, but what else is out there?  I can't tell if I am going to make my great adventure, or only peek out of my shell here and there.  I feel this unseen thumb pinning me down with logic and security, keeping me from going out, taking the unsaid dare.  I wanna say  'FUCK IT'  and  'FUCK YOU' ......any path clearing method that will spark and enliven. There are no strings holding me back except said security.  But summer is here, in the city that lives and breathes this season.  How can anyone think of leaving at this time?  Hell, I know me, I'll pocket this until the turning of the leaves, and hope to gain the understanding that is necessary to make a leap.
