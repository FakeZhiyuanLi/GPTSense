      Oh geez... for goodness sake.. I don't know what it is with men nowadays. They really leave much to be desired..no wonder more and more women are entertaining thoughts of staying single and self sufficient forever (which includes a vibrator in the list of items needed). LOL  I just logged into my account on Friendster and I have had to clear so many messages. Most of them ceases to grab my attention. But now! hey I found this freaking pea head, most probably with a penis the size of a pea who wrote to me so many times and I refused to waste time time drafting a reply so save for a "    Hi, thanks but I'm unable to write a longer reply. I don't think I know you and I have no wish to be friends with someone I do not know. Thanks for your kind effort in writing this message though. Cheers."      Not knowing what is called a straight "NO", He still persistantly deluged me with questions on my hobbies.. ( geez.. nowadays where got ppl use hobbies to describe.... kauz ..), my likes and dislikes ( yar, as if if I tell you i hate perverts like you, you'll back off..),  my work ( nbz.. what is it with men anyway, being an acct mgr at my age is sooooooooooooo... unbelievable huh or my face spells BIMBO with a capital B huh???!!)  TMD... I had enough but this latest email from him is the cherry on the icing lor! Nbz... fancy a Moral education lesson from Mr. Pea Head.. KNN..   From:    nyp      Date: August 6, 2004 1:35 PM Subject: ...Social Grace - Message:    replying in email mean :...politeness, social grace, civilised manner.u did not repeat the same answer cos that email was "different" in content.the sad truth is....Social Grace has to be cultivated from within.      I strongly believe he don't know how to write the chinese word "DEATH". Ohmigod... I'm really hopping mad lor. Cant believe such dockheads still exist; I thought they were long wiped out by a meteor like the dinosaurs the last I heard. Urgh..   Then you have the ones who claim to know you but for the life of me, I just DO NOT recall ever knowing anyone with the same looks as him.... sigh...like the one below.. kauz.. soya bean milk along orchard road somemore...    From:    Pang      Date: August 7, 2004 3:22 AM Subject: hi hi hi4 Message:    Wendy didnt hear from u a long timehope u hv no forgotten me!anyhow, what is ur plan this national day holiday?care to have a drink .............soya bean at orchard road? nicholas singapore      Then there's the one below who's clearly a buaya... sigh.. and he thinks I'm stupid or what??     From:    Zen      Date: August 7, 2004 1:11 PM Subject: W e n d y . . . . . . : ) Message: Hello Wendy,I happen to come across your profile, and I think that you are a pretty sweet looking girl, wonder if you will like to make another new friend? ;) Let me noe ok? I'm very keen and sincere abt this. Thanks Regards,Zenith      Look through his freaking profile and you'll realise that almost 90% of the "friends" in his list are made up of chicks ... and all has the same kinda of sey onez.. long hair and all. Wa lau... he must think I'm stupid... sigh..   I don't know to laugh or to cry... the world having been made smaller and so much more interact'able by the advent of the internet, is now the main advocate of beauty first, personality second. Is it no wonder that more and more kids and teens are afflicted with anorexia nervosa and bulimia. Pathetic, sad but true.. Truly the world never ceases to amaze.

      Ah doi!!!!! My beloved pals.. esp Joyce and Mulia! (I badgered them earlier at 8 this morning for a free session of " counselling " with regards to my noctournal " adventure "), I finally finished my whole stack of claim forms and sales sheets!! Hooray! Girls, thanks so much... Without you peeps, I'd still be a wreck like I was this morning. whew.. Esp Mulia.. your phone bills must be sibeh the rocket high manz, after squandering a good 15minutes on hearing me vent it out. Pai say la... I promise, the next time you need me, I'll be there. Like what they say,   A friend in need is a friend indeed  .      Alright, to those of you who have heeded my warnings in my recent post to contact me.. hee.. thanks hor. Unfortunately this time round it's my turn to say sorry. I couldn't afford the time to reply ..yet...  Tell you all something funny...I bought some nougats from my recent trip to Aussie Land. Then hor, I brought it and left it in my office right? Ok, last week, I had a craving for it and opened one and munched on it. Eewww... to my disgust, it's Lao Hong lehz...I discarded it and didin't give it much thought thinking it might be a bad one I picked up from the jar.  Then hor, after finishing most of my paperwork, I badly needed a boost of sugar... I took one out and eeeeewwwwww.... LAO HONG AGAIN!!!!! I was thinking, must either be the freaking faggot of a shopseller who saboh me, cos I accidentally knocked over his crate of goodies otherwise must be the colleague who went with me cos we forgot to divide the big freaking bag. Self righteousness burning in my heart, determined to fight for my best interest, I marched to my colleague's room and swing open the door. "thud" ......... In case you don't know what that is, well.. that's the sound of the hard wooden panelled door on impact with a smooth verneer of a head. Gulp... yes... the door kena my boss Greg. Needless to say, I forgot about my nougats. I think this time, Greg will accept my resignation without delay sial... LOL  Oh well... ok, time out. Need to change liaoz...otherwise i'll be late for the function. Dun know why but despite the nightmare last night and recently, I feel like I'm prettier by the day.. my skin seems to have improved a lot, my hair has also become more lush and thick.. hee... I feel pretty now. Ok, don't burst my ballon pls, I know I have an arse the size of Singapore's reclaimed land, a tummy with enough fats to submerge Singapore.. and many more. But for now, just let me be la... And did I tell you guys. I love Singapore...!!    We have a vision for tmr....     We can achieve.... we can achieve     We have a goal for Singapore     We can achieve... we can achieve          There is something in the air..     It's a feeling we all share....     We're gonna build a better life for you and me     We can achieve... we can achieve          Count on me Singapore     Count on me to give my best and more          You and I will do our part     Stand together heart to heart     ....        Steady right?? hee... this used to be my favourite national song way back in the 80s when i was in primary school.... I still remember the lyrics lehz.. aawww..... ^_^

      Stark white walls surround me like a cocoon, directly above looms a huge round cluster of bright lights which glares straight down on me, seemingly seeking to illuminate what is hidden in me. Somewhere in the distance, rings a disembodied voice. Out of an inexplicable fear or unexplainable obedience, I blindly followed the voice's instructions and laid myself on the bed, placed my legs in the stirups. A disjointed latex gloved hand then appeared and proceeded to fasten and tighten the grip of the leather straps on my feet; holding me prisoner to the foreign metal.  The same disembodied voice asked me if I'm ready and as I looked in the direction of the projection, the voice materialised itself in the form of a bespectacled man with dark beady eyes swathed in a green surgical gown and whose face was masked. He seems vaguely farmiliar but yet I can't quite place it.  Finally as if some fog in my brains lifts, my senses are suddenly heightened auditory and sensory wise. I glimpsed a pair of what I think is forceps in his hands. I sense danger.. like some primal instincts kicking in, I struggled to be freed. I hear rustling to the left and immediately I see this definitive female form garbed in the same green surgical gown materialising next to me. Without any preemptive warning, i could only gap in fear as I witnessed the needle pierce my skin, through layers of cells and finally hitting the target, the vein; discharging the deceptively innocent clear liquid.  Slowly, as the drug took its effect, I felt like my soul was torn away from my body... As the man approached with the loathsome metal tool, I started whimpering, all the while struggling to stay conscious and free myself. I watched in horror as he closes the distance between us. As he plunged the biting cold metal into me, I screamed...  THEN I WOKE UP.  Ya, a dream.. More like a nightmare. With the exception of the recent long weekend cum holiday, I've been plauged with the same recurring dream every single night since early last week. I'm tired.. exhausted, yet the thought of sleep, despite mine knowing how much needed a commodity it is to me, brings much fear. I'm really spooked out by this. Over the weekend, perhaps becasue I had so many distractions that the nightmares didn't come visit me at all. The relief was so welcomed I would shout "hallelujah" if I could..  The relief was shortlived... it returned last night. And tonight's the worst. It was so real, i could literally feel the pain! Each time I woke up, it's either with a start (that's usually the better option..), or crying and whimpering ... (ok, 2nd best..cos only crying nia mahz..) or the worst like tonight lor.. I SCREAMED my lungs out. Whew.. woke up my dad who was in the living room dozing. I ended up having to placate him when I was the one who was more in need of it lor. Still, it used to be easier to will myself back to slumberland and I usually could.. recently it's effectiveness is decreasing.  Which explains why I'm blogging at this time of the night. Cos yours truly could not get back to sleep despite ... Think too traumatised liao.. Still, I'm longing for my bed, longing to fall back into the lush comfy sheets and snuggle under the comforter and sleep. Somehow I just cant.. I don't know why. I slept comparatively "early" tonight; 1.45am. And now less than a few hours' sleep, here I am typing insanely... The clock is registering 4.39am now. TMD...  Rarely do i get to really close my eyes and sleep early..., this bloody nightmare has to come at a bloody inoportune time. I decided, I'm songz liaoz... have written all I needed to off load froom the trauma just now. I dun care, die die also will sleep...Freaking tmr's a busy day; i can't afford to mess things up like I did a couple of weeks back. frenz, poh bi and keep me in prayer yea? I need it manz..

And stupid me still went against the warnings of my body and headed for the pool. Bad move... really...  Shan't blog much.. I need to rest.. Otherwise how to bring my mum out for the fireworks display later? sigh.. no choice I desperately want to please my mum, make her so darn happy before I break the news that her daughter has resigned from what my mum terms a lucrative job... geez..  Ok ciao.. need to run. My nose is having the runs too.. sigh..

      Something to announce......  I'm dying.... Wiltering like a flower left in the hot scorching sun... Sapped dry of life giving water Destined never to rise and sway in the wind again..   YAH RIGHT.. NO la! Scared you guys huh? hur hur  Nah, contrary to my introduction, I have good news.. but depending on whether you love me or hate me, it can be bad news too. Still, I can't imagine any of you pals out there who's want me dead. LOL So... *drumroll*.... tada! My medical report is out again... and my WBC is down!! ok la.. I exagerate a bit but forgive me la... Not DOWN but stabilised... Still the report might as well be a winning toto ticket cos I was absolutely exhilarated. Stunned beyond words, ( you know me, too used to bad news liao) I could starred at the dear doctor with a gapping mouth like a fish. 10 seconds later, after the news has sunk in, with adrenalin pumping in my blood, I hugged my doctor!! And gave him a peck on the cheek...  hahahaha..  Today's been really good.. I really wanted to call each and every one of you and share this piece of delightfully good news but acting on Joyce's advice, i decided not to. Too bad but stil it's never too late to share with you guys here. And I went out today!! Went to Indonchine and then Norman suggested going down to Chinablack cos his friends were there. And so the 3 of us went down and had a crazy time. Pity I didn't bring along my cam... tsk tsk tsk..  Then obviously buoyed by the happiness in me, I imbibed quite a far bit... By the time it was 12, I was quite erm... gone... *blush*... Then some equally sey dockhead suggested we shift to Velvet Underground.. We went and I nearly got raped by some pervert in Velvet's member lounge... Ok exagerate a bit.. not raped la but that bastard was obviously taking advantage of a highly intoxicated me. Heng Norman and Cobby came to my rescue and Joyce.. yha I must tell you about Joyce. She sibeh the friend, called out for help while trying to wrestle out of his grip, she looked at me and told me not to joke and fool around.. dud... Whew.. anyway I'm just glad to be home now and be sufficiently sober to type.  Still nothing could dampen the exuberant mood I'm in now... Ok shall end here, off the the shower I'm going. One last word.... I'm never gonna get so drunk again. It sucks...

      I know and I know and I know......that a change in my URL address is rather untimely considering that most of you out there are either in the midst of your exams or in the thick of work. Yet, all things considered, I would like to believe it is for the larger good. hee.. so sorry mates. Those of you who happened to be that tad closer to me knows the exact reason behind the move; so a hint to you peeps out there who have not been conversing or emailing me, you better drop whatever you're doing and start contacting me.   Have not been able to do up the blog properly due to time constraints so bear with the monotonous layout and lack of links to you guys. Will try to complete the transfering of previous blog  posts on the former URL by next friday... HOPEFULLY..   In any case, the week's been pretty much monotonous, the usual happenings at work but then midweek I did something... the best thing I ever did for myself. I TENDERED MY RESIGNATION.  How's that pals? Thousand apologies if this feels like I dropped a bomb in your face...I know among the bunch of us at KC and GYSS, the one least likely to get a "divorce" from our work is ME. Yada yada yada... Strangely it feels like a huge burden has been heaved off my straining back when I walked in and gave the letter to my boss. I can't say the same for my boss though... he looked absolutely stunned. Like some Hellfire missiles just dropped on his arse.  Bearing any unforseen circumstances like death, pregnancy, operations, my wedding!! yea man!! ya right.. and maybe... just maybe my boss will give me a 2thousand bucks increment, YEA I'LL STAY FOR GOOD!! LOL I'm pretty much decided about this. Have plans to head off to some "exotic" asia contry like Laos, Myanmar, Cambodia etc..under Raleigh or SLF  to do some voluntrary stint. Then again, just had an offer from NKF to do something as well so we'll just have to see. You guys out there, any lobang for me?? LOL My needs are very simple; 5K a month, a car to drive, all boarding and entertainement expenses on the company. hmmmm... think that's about it. Yah right! Joyce and Mulia will ask me to go fly a kite if I'm for real. Oh yea, Jeremy and Jean, please take note that since your upcoming nuptials happens to fall in the month I'm resigning, please don't expect a fat ang pow from me hor... got 10bucks, can laugh liao. ^_^  I need to go sleep liao.. feel like I'm falling ill soon. Have a great holiday u all... Love, Wen
