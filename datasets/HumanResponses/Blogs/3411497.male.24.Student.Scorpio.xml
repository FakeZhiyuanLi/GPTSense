      Monday mornings hit like a truck -- and this one is no different.  I awake from bed, mind working but body unusually sore and stiff... I hit the gym a little hard yesterday, and the pain steeming from that is compounded with the pain of knowing its Monday.  When you've got a combination like that, soreness and Monday,  you know it's Monday .  On Mondays, the truth of reality is often impossible to ignore, and this particular Monday morning, stained with the mistakes I made literally yesterday, reminds me of all the mistakes I have made over my figurative yesterdays.  I feel I owe all of my readers, fans, and friends an apology.  My real name is not The Black Blossom.  I have deceived you.  The name comes from long ago when I washed onto the shores adjacent to a dilapidated Burmese nunnery.  It was at this nunnery that I first received my name... The Black Blossom... as they wrote it and an accompanying blessing on a roll of parchment before rolling my basket back out into the Indian Ocean.  I have taken the name to heart, as the blessing imparted on me the qualities of myself that I hold dear: placidity, patience, and mysterious and frightening beauty.  So though The Black Blossom is not my real name, it is my real identity.

      I have awoken on a Sunday.  You know how I know?  Things are different.  The world is not as carefree as it was yesterday -- my brain is infected with the strange compulsion to do something... there are too many people out there being nervous about stuff, and it woke me up.  I have a hypothesis.  People, or at the very least Americans who "know how to make an entrance" are born on Sundays.  Why?  Because Sundays know how to make an entrance.  Sundays always enter the week with a finality that cannot be found in other days... Tuesdays are Tuesdays, Thursdays are Thursdays, but Sundays...  Sundays are Sundays .  People do things on Sundays, and I think the things they do affect the collective unconscious in ways we do not immediately understand.  There are billions of people in church right now... and there are billions of people resenting those people who are going to church... and then there are people who resent both of them.  Sundays are absolutely loaded with those weird human emotions: devotion, faith, resentment, doubt, guilt -- people refusing to shop because its Sunday, people shopping on Sunday even though they feel bad about it, people sick of people not shopping on Sundays, people sick of people feeling bad about people feeling bad for shopping on Sundays, people fixing their homes, people watching sports, people cooking outdoors... it's a weird day.  It's like a day off that doesn't count -- although we are allowed to do nothing on Sundays, it's fairly understood in this country that even if you're doing nothing, your nothing ought to be something.  If you're reading, you should spend at least an hour reading a classic, or a work of socially relevant non-fiction.  If you're watching television, at least an hour should be spent watching quality programming, like PBS or the History Channel.  If you're cooking, it had better be a good meal.  It's not a real day off!  There are too many social responsibilities that infest the collective unconscious!  We need a new day off, a real day off... a day that doesn't mean anything.  I have not done ample research to back up my claim, but I have already chosen that new day:   Tuesday.   Yeah yeah yeah, I know what you're thinking.   Tuesday?!   Yeah, Tuesday, and I'll tell you why: first of all, the days YOU are thinking of, which are either Monday or Friday, will not work.  Although the three-day weekend is a nice thought, both of those days have ingrained significance in our lives... Fridays signal the end of the week, and the beginning of a deserved respite from the daily grind, and Mondays represent a return to it.  They are loaded with hope and a fateful determinism, respectfully.  Secondly, Tuesday as an enforced day off will not upset any sweeping preconceptions about the significance of days.  Tuesday is a bland day with no real social impact -- but if turned into the NEW day off, it would change the entire dynamic of the week... I'll explain how.  First, the weekend would still be relaxing, and people could still behave in their weird, sci-fi-esque manner on Sundays.  Mondays would still be bad, because everybody would be going back to work, like normal... but they wouldn't be  as bad  because everybody would know that they have the next day off.  Furthermore, after an entirely relaxing Tuesday that can be acceptably expended in any manner, the "real" work week would begin on Wednesday.  Wednesday is already known as the middle of the week --   and how bad can a work week be if it starts in the middle of the week?    Thursday remains the day before Friday (like being George Clooney's brother, or something... Some guy: "Hey, you're Thursday!  You come right before Friday, don't you?" Thursday:   "You know man, I am my own day, you know.") and Friday remains Friday.  The weekend remains the weekend.  Do you see how simple that makes everything?  The week is given an entirely new dynamic, one typified by its faithfulness to positivity both in its emphasis on relaxation, and in its subversion of the typically negative days.  Plus, we could tell our grandchildren about the "old days" when people worked on Tuesdays... that's why in "Stormy Monday" the guy says "Tuesdays are just as bad [as Mondays]."  That song would take on a whole new social relevance, and I think we need a new song like that.  But even moreso, we need a new day off... Tuesday could transform our culture in one fell swoop, making us a more patient, tolerant, and loving community.    Tuesdays should become the new day off not only for our benefit -- but for the benefit of the entire world.  Perhaps I embellish the significance of a different Tuesday... but I doubt it.  I think it may be the answer we've been looking for.  Regardless, today is Sunday and The Black Blossom has some tasks to perform -- I shall continue my discourse on a less busy day...    I think we all know what day I'm talking about...   know what I mean?    You know the day I'm talking about?    Tuesday.

      I must say, there are times when I have a dream so vivid that I expect to awake into a reality of that dream.  This morning was not like that.  Rather, this morning, I awoke remembering not a single instant of last night's dreams, remembering only vague impressions.  As usual, I was presented with some sort of challenge, some sort of search, and as usual I succeeded only to have a new challenge, a new search, bestowed upon me.  Somehow, my dreams have fallen into some common template -- I always have to go do stuff.  Something about last night I recall: I was pursuing this kind of yellowish, marshmallowish creature that did something... and whatever it did, I had to do something about it, but even then, I don't recall knowing why, or necessarily agreeing with why it had to be done.  We're always doing things  about  something.  I can't remember the last time I've seen Americans, as a society, do something  for  something.  I think our lives are becoming far too speculative, too privileged for the present... I saw a commercial yesterday about some service called "InPhone", (or perhaps more insipidly, "InFone"), where some guy calls this service to   book a restaurant reservation for him.    Does anybody really need a middle-man to take care of that task?  How much longer before I can have somebody sent over to my house to take a nap for me?  Some things are different, and require middle-men.  Assassinations, for example, often require middle-men.  Grocery shopping requires middle-men, we can't all go to the farm, take what we want, and leave some cash in the doorstep.  In certain instances of the handicapped and elderly, driving requires a middle-man... flying almost always requires a middle-man for everybody.  Making a reservation at a local restaurant, however, does not require a middle-man.  That is a task reserved for those so "busy" that they only have time to call somebody to do something even though it would take the same amount of time to perform that task personally -- rather than calling somebody, you can call this service and have them call that person for you.  That is so fucking stupid.  I'm going to call "InFone" and ask them if they'll call "InFone" for me -- I need a reservation at Taco Bell.  I simply wish those resources, and that money, and the people that now work for and run "InFone" would dedicate their lives towards something more worthwhile.  The privileged are already privileged -- they need not more privileges.  Regardless, the entire point I'm trying to make here is that I just woke up, and I'm in a world that makes as little sense to me as the world where I was while I was asleep, chasing a yellowish-marshmallow creature for reasons that were as elusive to me then as they are now.

      Ah, the gentle morning light caresses The Black Blossom from his nightly slumber -- welcoming him to a new day filled with all the promise of a tomorrow, with all the wisdom of a yesterday.  He stirs and stirs... looks about, familiarizing himself with this all-too-familiar environment, and smiles at how the morning light makes everything look soft, dewy, and innocent... if ever the world, and if ever humanity itself could find that place of salvation in tranquility, surely it would be on a cool, forgiving morn such as this.  Eh, probably not.  I slept funny last night.  I have a crick in my neck.  That's right, a crick.  I don't even know what a crick is... it is either related to the insect, the cricket, or the game, cricket.  If the insect, I suppose I am to assume a cricket crawled onto my face and whistled its little mating song right next to my ear, so I cranked my own head into the bed to avoid hearing its piece-of-shit serenade.  If the game, I would have to assume that this condition is common among cricket players, probably related to the constant torquing of the body.  Regardless, there is a crick in my neck, and as I do not have crickets in my house, nor am I on a cricket team, the only logical explanation for the crick in my neck is that God did it to me.  Oooh, He is always playing Pranks!  Mornings are okay.  I do, however, think that humanity can be divided into two hierarchical castes based on whether or not they can function in the morning.  In Nietzschean terms, we'd be talking about a publicly enforced master-slave dynamic -- but because "master-slave" language is so depressing, I propose a shift towards "Number Ones" and "Number Twos".  Number Ones are people that cannot get up in the morning.  If they do get up, they're pissy.  They throw waffles at you, they refuse to do anything, and even if  you're  trying to sleep, they play they're music as loud as possible so  they can wake up .  These people need to be captured, subjugated, stripped of their belongings, and sent back to kindergarten to learn some fucking manners.  There is no excuse for rudeness, ever.  So listen up, Number Ones, and you know who you are... (and if you don't know who you are, listen to yourself in the morning.... do you ever say: 'I'm not a morning person'?  'Don't talk to me before I've had my coffee'?  Have you noticed people hate you before noon?  If any of these sound vaguely familiar to you, you're a Number One, and under my rule, you're going to camp!)  ahem, as I was saying, so listen up, Number Ones: get it together.  Put your stupid little emotions aside while you wake up, because neither I nor anybody else, not even other Number Ones, find your little rising-sun ritual of being a dickhole nearly as endearing as you do.  That's the biggest flaw of the Number Ones, they think being a bitch in the morning is cute...  So here's some reliable information for all, Number Ones and Twos: puppies are cute.  You, in the morning, are not.  Number Twos are a superior race.  They get up, and they do their thing.  That's the shit!  If they're in a bad mood, they keep it to themselves until after they have showered and eaten.  They do not lash out at the general public, and certainly not at those close to them.   Why then should these gentle creatures be constantly attacked with the morning vitriol of the emotionally weak?   They should not.  It is a crime.  I, a Number Two, have tasted the icy wrath of many a Number One...   And many a Number One has died for it.   I call for a worldwide revolution of Number Twos... let's flush these dastardly morning tyrants down the proverbial toilet.  You know, that one toilet... in that one proverb... about not being wasteful or something.  Regardless, the time has come for me to face the music -- which, by the way, is a stupid saying.  Face the music?  Who needs to face music?  That's why it's music, you don't need to look at it -- and go to my ninja lesson.  That's right.  The Black Blossom is a ninja.  Beware.

      This morning I arose slower than usual, a phenomenon I have chosen to dismiss as the random hand of fate rather than the deliberate hand of death... I normally wake up rather quickly, jump out of bed, and immediately begin planning out my day.  Today, it took me around five minutes -- I'm feeling a little behind.  Regardless, allow me to introduce myself to all of you -- whoever you are.  Chances are I know you.  I either work with you, go to school with you, or have done one of those things in the past with you.  Those are all acceptable to me.  So, to begin, as the "profile" aspect of this little gem seems to be lacking, allow yourself to bend thy seeing ear my way as I explain to you my most hidden desires, thoughts, and plaintive moods -- or to be more pedestrian about it, I shall explain my profile.  To begin... "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon" is my favorite movie.  Why?  I'm glad you didn't ask, but I'll tell you anyway.  First of all, the movie is beautifully rendered on a visual level -- the land and city-scapes are gorgeous.  They give the film a very palpable fairy-tale (or for the pretentious, "faerie-tale") mystique.  Compounded with the visual elements, the characters are realized in very human terms... they all have very glaring weaknesses (although not necessarily flaws except in Jen's case) which made them very sympathetic to me.  Overall, the depiction of China was a very romantic one, and it swept me into that blue lagoon that is the history-sized sky of China. HOWEVER, the permeating theme of the movie is not so romantic as its superficial layers.  It indicts the male-dominated society of ancient China, and also criticizes its self-oppressive and repressive customs.  Despite their greatest strengths, the story is ultimately a tragedy -- with the fatal blows being struck not by human hands, but by the sweeping brush of human fundamentalism.  "It should always be acceptable to love somebody", begs the film.  Ready for more?  I mean, you've already read this far.  You might as well finish up.  I mean, why not read the whole post?  It's only his second post, he's excited.  He goes off on tangents sometimes.  In the future, maybe he'll develop a more stream-lined and accomodating mode of narration... so I'll give him a chance now.  He seems smart enough, and those eyes... those eyes...  What do I do?  Well, if you're reading this now, as in the day I wrote it, you know what I do.  I walk around our bookstore and tell you what to do.  Actually, I don't tell a whole lot of people what to do.  I don't like to... besides, whenever people tell me to do something, I don't do it.  I think most people are like that.  So I either don't tell people to do stuff, or I tell them to do it in a funny way so it doesn't actually seem like I'm telling anyone to do anything.  So far, my modern day mind-sorcery has worked... no has gotten wise yet... and fuck it, people can figure out shit on their own anyway.  I've got a blog to work on, goddammit!  Other than that, what else about me?  Some basics: I try to keep clean.  I noticed yesterday that I began to stink, and it really pissed me off.  I hate stinking, and I hate being dirty.  If I seem to be in a bad mood, it is invariably because I either feel dirty or I feel like I stink.  The best way to get me out of a bad mood is to either say, "you look clean" or "you smell nice".  If I detect a lie, your punishment will be delivered swiftly and without mercy.  I'd like to point out, almost in summary, that this blog is about me.  Only me.  That's weird.

      Hello to all that have ventured here... which is no one.  Thank you for coming.  I am sitting at work, cooling my heels, and enjoying some much needed paid-time-off-while-actually-working.  This is my first installment.  I hope you enjoyed it.  - The Black Blossom

      I write to you from within the despairing depths of a Laurie Notaro reading/signing at Changing Hands Bookstore.  I have come to the grim realization that I too could be a star -- if only, I too, were an overweight, snaggle-toothed, boring-as-hell little harpy -- like Laurie Notaro.  She has just finished imparting upon her legion of boring/bored fans a story about how one time she accidentally ripped open a pair of pants.  When discovered, she pretended she was swatting flies.  Isn't that funny?  I mean, oh my god, isn't that so goddamn fucking funny?!  I don't know about you, but to me, that story, the whole idea of that story, is so funny that it makes my butt water.  I have endured her blood-curdling cries of cued laughter for only one-half of an hour, and already I have considered stabbing myself in the ear with a pair of scissors as a desperate attempt to escape the pain... the only reason I have avoided doing so is that I know this hell will end before long, and that a massive head wound is something (despite it making a good story to tell to my grandchildren) I will ultimately regret.  Tell me, what defines celebrity?  What defines funny?  Is it simply capturing the zeitgeist?  Because Laurie Notaro, like no other, has captured the idiotic zeitgeist -- and the people here love her, and I know of nothing else to do except vent here, and hope that some wayfaring soul with a special communication with God recognizes my pained soul, prays for my mercy, have God grant me mercy, and then apotheosize.

      Everybody should take a little time out of their day and observe a small moment of silence for the Olsen twins -- they're eighteen now, and it's all downhill for them from here.  They've never not been in the media, and I think from here on out we're going to start seeing them for what they really are, or at least, will be...  Utter weirdos.  These kids are going to be weirder than anything Michael Jackson, David Koresh, or Odd Nerdrum ever imagined.  Their lives have always been on television, and I am absolutely positive that their constant publicity has tainted their subconsciouses far more than we realize... and now with all the hoopla over them being "legal", the pervs will crawl out of their walls, proudly proclaiming that it'll be legal when they jerk-off to pictures of the pair.  The psychological damage will mount as these two girls realize they're the nerd fantasy of every creep in the United States, and before we all know it, they'll disappear from the public eye to go devote themselves to some sort of Neo-Nazi psychic cult in Boulder, Colorado.  I feel sorry for them.

      EDITOR'S NOTE:  Some parts of this blog entry were written a few days ago -- at the time of publication the carpet was replaced, the room restored to order, and Reagan, still dead, was buried in the Capitol Rotunda.  Also, for the sake of the reader's ease and comfort, this entry is divided into four sections -- shout-out, cranky, heffalump, and much-luv.  If you do not want to read The Black Blossom's thoughts on the presidency and death of Ronald Reagan, please skip "Section Heffalump".  Thank you.    SECTION SHOUT-OUT   There is a possibility that you are a stranger -- that you do not know who I am, and read this anyway because you surf the 'net a lot, and believe you have stumbled upon the ramblings of a genius.  If this is the case, I would like to tell you that I know three people that you don't -- which is your loss, because these three people have ruled in recent memory, and deserve public recognition for it.  The first person is a friend of mine named Nate.  A few nights ago he espoused to me his theory that cats are domesticated vermin.  The ramifications of this small lecture reached far beyond just the biological niche of house-held felines -- and straight into comic genius.  He may not think of it as a good bit, but it was as good a bit as I've  ever  heard... and for all future comic purposes, I will be referring to cats as domesticated vermin.  What was truly odd was how similar his theory was to my often pseudo-scientific sense of humor... I could've come up with the idea, but he did.  Oh well, at least I have the "whales vs. humans armageddon" idea.  The second person is another friend, named Gaya, who gave me a talking-to after I wrote her a sad email.  Having another's concern is always nice, even if it means they're concerned.  I'm sorry if I concern anybody -- but if I do concern you, please let me know, because it'll make me feel better and you'll have less to be concerned about.  Anyways, I wasn't expecting a talking-to, and it was very kind.  The third person is another friend, Angela.  Angela may be the only person that is as cool as me.  She's like a female Fonz for the new millenium.     SECTION CRANKY   After a disruptive period of life known as "house-painting and re-carpeting", I am hoping to regain the once glorious method of writing on this thing once a day... I have finished my obligations of painting thus far, making the final strokes just this morning.  Overall, however, the entire thing has sucked and my room is now a monstrous mess of things that needed to be moved, and will need to be moved again for tomorrow's recarpeting.  Even The Black Blossom is vulnerable to the inconveniences of style.  So I'm going to say a few things: some of them good, some of them of nice, and some of them not-so-nice and arguably bad.  So we'll start with the mixed stuff, and move towards the good stuff, because that way everybody can go back to what they were doing feeling relatively good about things... that's always the best way to do things: say something nice, criticize, then say something nice again.  There's always room for positivity!  Now let's hug.   SECTION HEFFALUMP   Actually, let's not hug.  Reagan died.  Now, I'd be lying if I said I "liked" Reagan -- I'd also be lying if I said I "respected" Reagan.  In fact, I'd be lying if I said I had anything purely positive to say about the man... I think he was a horrible president, and like many politicians, I ultimately consider him to be a liar and a murderer.  No amount of Cold War thawing is going to excuse his endorsement and installation of Pinochet in Chile, or his involvement in the Iran-Contra scandals.  Nor can it go unnoticed that despite his constant promises of reducing the national debt, under his presidency the debt and deficit increased dramatically.  I understand that to some he is a hero -- and that's fine... but I think any fair-thinking individual will have to admit that Reagan's legacy is a mixed one, at best.  I tend to think of him as a Republican's Clinton.  He was a smooth talker, and he fucked everything up for the other side of the political spectrum for eight years.  He was so likable that while I was growing up (and clueless, let's not forget), I practically thought the guy was my grandpa.  Leftists hate him though, just like heffalumps (not woozils) hate Clinton.  Personally, I'm not a fan of either one...   SECTION MUCH-LUV   All of that said, the current political setting of these United States is quite the interesting one -- so interesting, in fact, that even a cursory glance at the events on Capitol Hill is maddening.  I wish Gandhi were alive so he could walk down a line composed of the President and his Cabinet, slapping every single one of them across the face.  There are times that I don't really know what to do.  Now is one of them.  My house is in disarray, my car is broke, and I have no clean clothes -- in a larger sense, this is also the problem of the entire country: we don't know what we're doing, we aren't going anywhere, and we look dirty.

      'Tis Friday morning, late morning, and I have just shaken off that little slice of death we all call sleep.  I must admit, I rather enjoy sleeping.  It's like pressing the reset button.  If you're tired, you go to sleep.  You'll feel better when you wake up.  If you feel a little sick, you sleep more, and feel better.  It's an odd process, really -- to drive the point home, I think if I were ever rich and famous I'd have a special sleep chamber with a bunch of tubes and bubbles -- I'd tell reporters that "at night, this is where I rejuvenate."  I found out last night that I have a fan!  And not just a fan, but a Number-One Fan!  Part of me wonders if it may be a bit early for me to have fans, but at the same time, is it really ever too early to have fans?  The world might be a lot better place if everybody were more willing to be fans of other people... actually, come to think of it, it wouldn't be.  There are some pretty cool guys that used to live on this planet, and their fans are fucking it up for everybody -- and yes I prefer to call these people "fans".  You know what I've noticed as I've grown up?  I'm not sure if I remember the specific moment I realized this, but it was a momentous revelation that flew in the face of everything I thought I knew:  grown-ups are just making it up as they go along .  If anybody is in charge of anything, they're just making it up.  They don't actually know what to do, they're just giving it a shot.  Trying to avoid a war?  Well shit, they'll do their best.  It's kind of strange to look back on youth and remember having the concept of 'right and wrong' explained to you, realizing that the person telling you about it was more indictable by their definition than you were.  It's very strange being trapped here.  I find it very believable that human beings descended from monkeys, because if monkeys were in charge, things would probably look a lot like this -- a lot of whooping, and a lot of feces-throwing.  On the one hand, it's very interesting.  On the other hand, I kind of want out.

      Today is Tuesday -- oddly, my day off.  Even more oddly, it is a day I have to do something.  I must paint my room, and at least one other room in the house.  I will probably paint the bathroom, but it remains to be determined.  As I am still shaking off the dust of subconsciousness, I do not feel I am in a reliable place, mentally, to start making decisions.  I should probably sit here and babble with my fingers until I have the confidence to decide which room to paint first, even though they will all eventually be painted.  Life is full of hard decisions, and that's an important lesson for everybody to learn.  It is easy to criticize others for decisions that appear foolish when we have the luxury of retrospect.  In history, all things become clear... but in the present, reality is often presented to us in a swirling mass of uncertain possibilities... we should respect others that make mistakes, not only because we ourselves will eventually make mistakes, but because we should respect mistake-making in general.  Mistakes are bound to happen -- we should be aware that things will go wrong, and not be surprised when they do.  So in that vein, I think I'll paint the bathroom today.  Sure, it might mean the deaths of thousands, but how am I to know that know?  You'll all just have to forgive me!  The next decision to make is in regards to the music I will listen to... and that's fairly easy.  I'll listen to funk, soul, and some low-down dirty blues... and then I'm going to rock out with some rawk!  But what if these are mistakes?  What if some of my neighbors are trying to meditate?  What if I have a sick neighbor that is trying to sleep?  Well, then I'll be making a mistake, and THEY'LL have to live with it!  Hey, I make mistakes!  Deal with it!  After that, I'll have to take a shower.  But will I turn on the hot water first, or the cold water first?  They will have to mix eventually so I neither scald nor freeze myself in the shower, but which do I turn on first?  I'll probably start with the cold... but what if I'm wrong?  What if I should start with the hot water?  Will my cat die?  No, so I don't care.  And then I have to wear clean clothes.  What if I'm not stylin'?  Heh heh heh, I think we can safely rule out THAT possibility.

      Last night I realized something about myself that makes me both proud and ashamed, happy and sad, and a host of other poetic contradictions. There is no good way to introduce the story, so I'll simply jump into it...  I got home from work last night at about 9:45 pm. I was very hungry, but also feeling particularly lazy, as I had been up since 6 o'clock in the morning. After haplessly surveying the contents of the refrigerator and pantry, I almost resigned myself to not eating anything -- not because I wasn't hungry anymore, but because I was feeling so lazy that I didn't want to make any effort in securing any provisional sustenance... I didn't want to cook, I didn't want to drive anywhere, I just wanted to sit on my ass and have food brought to me. Normally, one calls for a pizza in this instance, but I didn't want to pay for anything, either.  It was around this time that I overheard my roommate and his lady-friend discussing the ins-and-outs of procuring a delivered pizza. I wayfared my way into his room to become part of the action. They informed me directly that they planned on getting a pizza -- and I supported them in their decision. Covertly, I planned on sticking around... getting a slice or two. They made the call, made the order, and hung up the phone. Estimated time of arrival was 45 minutes. I realized that I was going to have to commit 45 minutes of absolutely awesome company if I hoped to receive food... one cannot just drop in on a pizza and hope to get in on it... it requires some sort of investment.  The following 45 minute period was among the most exciting and entertaining comedy shows I have ever put on in my entire life. I talked myself into losing situations where I allowed myself to look like an idiot, so that they could feel cool. I made funny faces, and even danced for laughs. And I will say so falt-out, I was funny. I was really fucking funny, and there were a few times I actually thought, "they'd better give me some pizza, because I am putting on a great fucking show here."  Eventually, the pizza arrived... as did the moment of truth. Would I be fed?  Yes, I would. The two of them actually seemed to compete over whose slices I could eat. He said, "you can have one of my slices", and she corrected him, matter-of-factly, "no, you can have either of our slices". I obliged them both... and I think I ate more of that pizza than either of them.  Then it hit me like a ton of bricks... all those old nature documentaries I used to watch that described the social dynamics of monkeys... some monkeys were bullies, and fought for food; some monkeys were foragers, and found their food. But there was always that one monkey, and there was a monkey like it in every group of monkeys, no matter where they came from. The narrator of the show could never understand the behavior of this monkey, and its name was always "Bonzo" or "Fifi" or something else insipid... and it was the monkey that sat around and entertained other monkeys, and swindled the food they fought or worked for right from under their noses.  These monkeys were the dick monkeys... the monkeys that were dicks.  I'm a dick monkey.  This realization came to me while I was still sitting there, eating. I couldn't stop laughing about it. I had this image in my head of two monkeys sitting around eating bananas, just kind of shooting the shit, when up comes another monkey. You can tell by the look on this monkey's face that he's up to no good, but the two other monkeys don't seem to notice -- then the new monkey starts to act silly, the two monkeys laugh, and start giving him bananas... I pondered the comedy that no group of monkeys seems to think that they have a dick monkey, that the dick monkey is some sort of covert ops position in the primate social hierarchy... and sometimes, such as in my case, not even the dick monkey knows they're the dick monkey.  They seemed to think that I was laughing about something else, and god bless them for it, because they cannot know the truth. I actually sat there a little bit longer than I was planning to because I felt guilty about the whole thing -- guilty about tricking them into exchanging food for my company, guilty about being the dick monkey.  It's the next day now, and I don't feel so bad anymore. It's probably part of my genetics.

      Now, I know it's been awhile... and I've received a few complaints.  To my adoring fans who have felt neglected, I sincerely apologize.  But please realize how easy it is to be The Black Blossom, how easy it is to never be removed from my unique and brilliant banter... I don't know what it's like to not have myself around, so I'm always happy and laughing -- so please forgive my thoughtlessness.  Now, the first and only order of business today is to publicly establish the parameters of "the perfect woman" -- I am doing this not only because I constantly have young women pounding on my door, calling my phone, and leaving notes for me at work and on my car, but also because I don't like any of these women.  To the layman, I might appear to be somewhat of a loner -- a sophisticated eye, however, will discover that I am simply very picky... I know what I want, and I don't settle for anything else.  All of that said, who am I looking for?  Essentially, I am looking for Sigourney Weaver's character of Ripley from "Aliens".  Let's make this supremely clear: I am not looking for Sigourney Weaver, I am not looking for Ripley from "Alien", "Alien 3", or "Alien: Resurrection"...  I am looking for Ripley from "Aliens".  Do not say I have a crush on Sigourney Weaver.  She's an attractive lady, but she's no Ripley.  What do I appreciate about Ripley in "Aliens"?  Well, let's start with the superficial.  She's a hot lady.  The Black Blossom appreciates beauty.  But hot ladies are a dime a dozen, especially here in Arizona.  You're going to have to be more than hot to snag The Black Blossom.  I can get hot by walking outside -- so if you think your spaghetti straps and thong underwear rising over your jeans is going to get me all riled up, think again.  A clone of you and your style will reappear within five minutes, and you will be forgotten instantly, replaced by another globule of American beach style.  Not impressed.  I'm glad you're hot, and make no mistake, I'll look at you, but don't think I'm going to talk to you, much less be nice to you or appreciate you at all unless you're smart and tough like Ripley.  Beauty is not a pass, so don't flash it at my door thinking you'll get in.  You'll get bounced faster than a Bob Cousy dribble pass.  That's right, you saw me write "tough and smart".  That's what I want.  I want a woman that can spot a corporate sleazeball.  I want a woman that doesn't take any shit from unethical assholes.  I want a woman that knows her books, knows her movies, and in general, just plain-ass knows her shit.  She also has to know that she knows her shit.  Most importantly, I want a woman that will, (if the need arises), duct-tape a flamethrower to a machine gun and invade hostile alien territory.  (She doesn't have to know HOW to use a machine-gun or a flamethrower, necessarily.  She just has to be willing to pick them up and use them if a small innocent girl is kidnapped by aliens.)  Manners are cool.  I'm not looking for some 100 mile-an-hour lady that's going to kick my ass if I disagree with her, knows more dirty jokes than me, exclusively drinks whiskey and scratches her crotch in public.  I'm not about that.  I subscribe to a few ideas of femininity, for better or for worse, and maintaining a certain level of that is required.  No monster truck enthusiasts.  No doily collectors either.  Really, the best way to find out what I'm attracted to is to watch "Aliens".  If you think you fit the bill, go ahead and drop me a line.  No fakers, I'll spot you -- I'm looking for a Ripley, not some farcical imitation.  I hope this has helped.  I'll be happy to answer questions.  I hope this has helped in some capacity.

      What you are about to witness, and read, is something you may not have expected... unless you know me. You probably know me, so you probably do actually expect this -- but imagine for a moment that you're my only non-Arizonan reader, and that you don't know me. You'd never see this coming. You'd never see the Black Blossom going political coming.  So here goes.  This year's election.  Politics.  Kerry versus Bush.   Bush versus Kerry.  Who to choose?  After all, this election is so important. Haven't you heard? I mean, if Bush gets elected the world will explode. But if Kerry gets elected, the moral fiber of this nation will unravel at the seams, opening us up to attack from our enemies. At the same time, if Bush gets elected, we'll all be put in concentration camps for having violated the laws of Thoughtcrime. But if Kerry gets elected, nothing will get done, and eventually terrorists will kill all of us. But if Bush wins, the entire world will lash out at America, declare war on us, and everybody will hate us forever. But if Kerry wins, the entire world will lash out at America, declare war on us, and everybody will hate us forever.  It seems to me that both of these campaigns are being run on rather dire platofrms.  They both claim to be optimistic, but they're only optimistic if you vote for the right guy.  If you vote for the wrong guy, and the wrong guy gets elected, we all die.  If we vote for the right guy, and the right guy wins, we'll all be showered with wealth, security, and hell, a couple dozen virgins.  We jsut have to choose the right one.  Behind door number one is heaven, behind door number two, hell.  We just have to choose the right door... unfortunately, there are no numbers on the doors, so it's a gamble either way.  Bush is opposed to stem-cell research. Kerry supports it. So which one do I vote for? The one that wants to kill fewer babies, or the one that wants to kill fewer adults?  When is life acceptable, and when is death acceptable? Who should be allowed to live?  These are apparently campaign questions.  Can anybody really answer those questions?  Should anybody really be trying to give me the answers?  Personally, I think the idea of a nation trying to answer those questions is stupid.  How the hell is a country supposed to come to a consensus on who lives and who dies?  I'm sick of the whole idea that everything leading up to this election is the most important thing in the world.  Like history is ending.  Like people are going to stop dying if the right person is elected.  Like people are going to stop killing each other over frivolities.  Like diseases are going to disappear because of the President, and not brilliant doctors.  Like world peace is going to fall over the world if I can just make the right vote at the right time...  Everybody knows who they're voting for, and that's fine.  But when we die, whether it's tomorrow or in 70 years, the Middle East is still going to be an extremely turbulent place.  People are still going to murder each other.  Women will still get raped by soldiers, despots will still be exploiting common-folk.  There will still be disease, and natural disasters.  There will still be a hole in the ozone layer, and it'll probably be bigger.  Neither Bush nor Kerry are actually going to change that.  The most infuriating thing about living in the United States is that everybody buys into this kind of crap.  Everybody thinks they know what's best for everybody, and everybody acts on that.   Everybody has an opinion, and everybody is right.  Everybody is fighting the good fight, day in and day out, and if it weren't for all those other people that disagree with them, it'd be paradise.  It seems to me that is the story of human history, the consistent failure to find ways to disagree. Some people just know what's right -- and when people know what's right, they don't have to be respectful to people who are wrong.  Kerry and Bush know what's right.  So do their followers.  Thank god they always have to tell me.
