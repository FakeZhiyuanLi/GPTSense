        Today I made a movie with a bunch of 6 year olds. I pretty much improvised the whole script during the "rehearsal".I'll put the script down as best I remember. Any asteriks mean there'll be a note at the end.  The Cast  Katrina, the good witch- Alice Crawford Princess Rose- Ada Lowenguard The Evil Wizard Hades.- Raymond Lowenguard The Evil Wizard's vapire minion, Tara- Sarah Valandria The Narrator- Henry Crawford (thats me!)  Scene 1 Setting: The house of the good witch Katrina's house. Midday [KATRINA is walking around the setpointing her MAGIC WAND at various places]  NARRATOR: Once upon a time there was a good witch known as Katrina. She worked for the nearby kingdom of "Gardenia" by watering their garden with her magic.  [KATRINA wipes her forehead]  KATRINA: Whew I'm tired, I'll go to bed.   [KATRINA turns out light and lays down, putting her wand next to her.]  NARRATOR: But that night Evil struck.  [TARA appear in a puff of smoke and takes the wand, then dissepears again. Then Cut to HADES' Lair where TARA appears in a puff smoke. TARA hands the wand to her master   TARA: Here Master.  [HADES takes the wand]   HADES: MWAHAHA  NARRATOR: With the wand HADES had all of KATRINAS powers and KATRINA had none  [Cut to Katrinas house wheres she still sleeping.  She wakes up and looks around]  KATRINA: Wheres my wand!?  [Cut to the castle where ROSE is]   KATRINA: Princess Rose, Have you seen my wand  ROSE: The Evil wizard took it*.  KATRINA: Then we have to get it.  [cut to the duo walking down a path with a large rock wall. TARA appears in a puff of smoke in front of the wall]  TARA: don't cross this wall if you wish to live*  [TARA dissepears into smoke]  ROSE: What do we do?  KATRINA: we have to get my wand back! We have to climb these rocks   ROSE: Ok.  NARRATOR: After many hours of climbing they finaly got to the top.  [Cut to HADES' lair the duo run in]  KATRINA: Give me wand back HADES!  [KATRINA runs towards HADES]  HADES: NEVER!!  [ he flick the wand at KATRINA and a lighting bolt shoots out of it, hitting KATRINA onto the ground]  KATRINA: Rose! I need you to get my wand*  ROSE: ok  [ROSE runs towards HADES but before she can get there TARA appears in smoke]  ROSE: Oh no  KATRINA: Take this  [KATRINA hands ROSE a small baton, ROSE takes it.]  KATRINA: hit her* with it.  ROSE: Ok  [ ROSE hits TARA with the baton, she screams and disintigrates]  HADES: ALAKA-  [ before he finishes the spell ROSE grabs the wand and pulls it out of his hands then throws it to KATRINA]  KATRINA: ALAKAZAM!  [Hades disintegrates]  KATRINA&ROSE: YAY!  FIN.   Notes  1. the actor changed this line to " I'm sad to say that evil took it" I found this very amusing. Also this is pretty much the most complicated line she says the rest is mainly "ok"  2. Tara happened to have the most complicated lines in the entire movie.  3.Oridgionly the plotline was that only a princess could get the wand back  4. did you notice that Taras name is never mentioned?

          Heres something I found while browsing blogger tonight (url)http://purple_pixie.blogspot.com/(url/) now payy attention to the HULKING MASS OF FAN LIST!! It's ginourmous. And what really bugs me is the fact that 12 of them are the same person, Orlando Bloom. And of course at least a year before LOTR came out OB was practicly unknown. so what I infer from this is that it's mainly for the looks, not acting skill (which I think he has a lack of). Now maybye this is just envy talking but the fact is just annoying. so please comment if you happen to be an OB lover.

          Today I met up with Chloe and Jack (two freinds.) we met at 1:00 pm in this local lounge, and it lasted till 10:00 pm. Heres how it went down. At this lounge ("the tea lounge") they have this stuff called "Shot chocolate" and it's pretty much Hot chocolate with a shot esspresso in it. Anyway Chloe had a cup of this and became caffenated chloe (I've coined that phrase by the way). Then we left all hyper and chipper and scurryed on down to the church where we saw our old camp  letting out, we hung out until it got awkward. Next we went to Jacks house and yelled at people from the window ( we were still sugar high at the time). we then took a break to eat a dinner of pizza ( where we learned that chloe starts laughting hystericly when some one snorts. as you can guess we exploited to it's fullest) then we got boered and went out side holding a sword (me) recorder (chloe) and a dustpan (Jack) then we tore flyers off of lamposts. Then we rented a movie we're they wouldn't let us rent an R movie (understandable) or a not rated movie. Now that got us thinking, if barney was not rated, Would they let us rent it? Any way thats the end of my story, hope you enjoyed it.
