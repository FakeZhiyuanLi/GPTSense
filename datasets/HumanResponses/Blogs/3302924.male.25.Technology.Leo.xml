	      I am checking out all types of stuff that can give me higher page rank. With million sites and billions web pages its real challenge to get a top pagerank. One would love to get his site in google search results. But for that to happen my site should have links on as many other sites. For this I had added a banner from BannerAdCentral banner exchange programe.   And hey you every one droping by my site i invite you to share links with your blog with me. On top right corner I had added a drop-down menu for Blogs. Now... that will contain links to your blog if you agree to put mine at your place.  :) Yup.. I am serious on getting a pagerank :)

	      As promised I had been working to enhance my blog with new tools and features. I had added a dynamic drop down menu, on the top right corner. This currently contains Web Links (also space for blogs..though not enabled yet).   The left sidebar now includes links from Amazon. I had worked on this to provide a rotating banner which will display best selling books, music and DVDs. (Though will add more categories to this latter).  And lastly the bottom of page has a "Donation" button for those who would want to contribute to my cause. (I had lot many things planned for this site and will share as and when i progress on this. I would love to have this blog content rich.)

	      I have planned to come up with some featured tools for my blog. Some of the ideas I am playing with currently are an Opinion Poll, a News Aggregator, Photo Albums. I had checked with some options here, and will soon be updating the design. Your suggestions are most welcomed.  Also spending some time now to understand the Template Tags, this will help to do some tweaking and customization. Being a techie, its fun.  Hope to release a next design change by month end!

	      At last I found some time to setup my very own blog. This is currently more experimental but I hope to have this running and interesting for all you guys.  As the Blog Title says it all, this is more an open slate where I can post updates about subjects like collaboration, technology, travel and other stuffs that will be of my interest and the readers who are most welcome to comment.  Please feel free to let me know your suggestions to improve this journal to make it more user-rich and content rich.

	      Okay, thats a bit loaded statement, but check it out your-self at  Mozilla, Firefox . Recently installed this Mozilla offering on my PC and found it a very good option beside MS IE. Yes I mean it. I have made it my default browser too and use IE only for sites which are still very MS centric in their design. It seems to me that IE has long back stopped evolving (Check out what  Joel  has to say on this -  How Microsoft Lost the API War ) and options like Firefox can provide with many nice to use features for easy-browsing.  Some of the features that I like about Firefox: > Tabbed Browsing: So you can view multiple pages/sites in a single window. Thats cool! > Popup Blocking: Now this would be bit of anonyance to lots of Advertisers. > Themes, Themes and more Themes: You got that. > Google Search: So if you been using Google Toolbar, don't worry they have for FireFox too.  Cons: - I have found this to crash a couple of time, but even my earlier IE used to crash quite often.       - I am having some problem with my drop-down menu. Not able to get the position correct. But also havn't spend much time to check that out yet.  Do comment on your experience with FireFox. I would really like to hear from you.

	      Tell me, is sugar sweeter Or He who makes sugar cane? Beauty of the moon is better Or He who makes it wax and wane?  Leave all the moons behind Put sugar out of your mind In Him another youâ€™ll find He makes another kind of grain.  O mind you may be wise In knowledge and insight may rise Or is it better to prize He who makes the mind insane?  Body, soul, mind and heart With power will make a start Yet in a drop, with art A hundred eyes will entertain.

	      Google had always provided me with the best and accurate search results (Okay... nothing new to that). But recently I noticed that the top ranking search results were not I would expect Google to display to me for my search queries. It was then I realized that my machine was hacked by some ad-ware/spyware and this was tampering my Google search results. So if I searched for "IBM Workplace Client Technology" in my search result the top entry would be links saying search for "IBM Workplace Technology" at eBay or some other stuff. The link was managed by searchbrowser.com which then redirects the users to their patrons/advertisers.   I used an anti-spyware tool to scan my machine and oh-la I had dozen different types of such worms on my m/c. I could remember reading some statistics about 60 (or was that 70) percent PCs are infected by such programs. Still I removed these from my m/c. (I used XoftSpy for the clean-up). This got rid of many other annoyances but not the one that tampered my Google Search Result page. For this I found that this was using a BHO (Browser Helper Object) 2_0_1browserhelper2.dll which gets loaded with your IE. I got rid of this by disabling it through BHODemon.  So this was another clever (but unethical) way of increasing the web traffic to one's site. Or should I say the extent to which Advertisements can be pushed to the Internet Users. The good old days of banners and pop-ups are over. Now we have light-weight spies on PC's that monitors user activities and tampers with their search results and other such utilities.

	        Sea waves are green and wet, But up from where they die, Rise others vaster yet, And those are brown and dry.  They are the sea made land To come at the fisher town, And bury in solid sand The men she could not drown.  She may know cove and cape, But she does not know mankind If by any change of shape, She hopes to cut off mind.  Men left her a ship to sink: They can leave her a hut as well; And be but more free to think, For the one more cast-off shell.
