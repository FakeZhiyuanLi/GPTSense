      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So we were good friends for years.&nbsp; We played together, went to each other's birthday parties... we were great friends.&nbsp; Brad and Robert, my brothers which we have named each other, came into the picture during grade one, if memory serves (unfortunately, most of the time it doesn't).&nbsp; I'd never met cooler guys.&nbsp; We did everything together.&nbsp; As the years went on, we spent nigh every waking moment together, especially considering they moved in just a block away from me. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They were my friends, she was my friend, they were her friends. *shrugs*&nbsp; It was quite the set up.&nbsp; For a hand ful of years, our little group was unseperable, even though we did let others in quite willingly.&nbsp; Pepar, Travis, John...&nbsp; Many a person we became friends with, but none as greatly bonded as the circle of the four of us. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Grade five rolled along, and all of a sudden the only girl in the group doesn't want to be the only girl in the group.&nbsp; That's respectable.&nbsp; I wouldn't have a problem with that, save that she stopped spending time with us.&nbsp; That made me rather angry, especially considering my temper.&nbsp; She started hanging out with this little group of girls who prided themselves on coming along and harassing and making fun of us.&nbsp; Mostly for the fact that we used to (more or less) role play out things live action, explaining things as we went along.&nbsp; Sure, it was funny to watch, but it was also fun to do. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We stopped seeing eye to eye pretty quickly.&nbsp; She was, is, so strong willed, and I'm so damned stupid and stubborn, we never really got past the first little stages of appologies.&nbsp; One gained a little ground, the other fought twice as hard to gain it back, and then some, and then all over again.&nbsp; Another little circle. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Grade ten, five years later and I hadn't spoken to her for... too long.&nbsp; We started talking again, seemingly randomly, at the end of the second semester, or nearing it.&nbsp; Just as friends catching up.&nbsp; A few tickling matches, though, and things got a little more than that.&nbsp; Nothing past tickling ever came out of it (truth to tell, I'm not a really forward person... it took me forth months before I even kissed her), not physically, anyway.&nbsp; We started going out, and... it really felt like a piece of me that had been missing, or had even never really been there at all had finally come home, gotten to where it was supposed to be. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nine months, we went out.&nbsp; She was my first girl friend.&nbsp; Nine months, and... I'm still not completely sure what I did wrong. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Around the following Christmas time, her Grandma was getting iller and iller, falling closer to death.&nbsp; Finally she couldn't hold on anymore.&nbsp; It was incredibly hard on her, especially considering she was getting no rest.&nbsp; She might have been sleeping, but no rest during the daytime.&nbsp; With two younger sisters, two parents, two jobs and the advanced classes in her high school, she was torn, tired and twisted. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It didn't help that I'm a closed book, most of the time.&nbsp; We had no trouble talking about jovial things, making each other laugh, but I don't talk to anyone about my big problems, usually.&nbsp; I hold it up, grasp it and don't let anyone see.&nbsp; It's none of their business, and I'd really rather not relive some stress from myself, only to put it onto someone else's shoulders. *shrugs*&nbsp; I just... don't like it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She was, though, finally getting me to open up, finally getting me to talk. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, as I mentioned before, I have an anger problem.&nbsp; Yes, I had a bad temper as a child, and yes I do sprout from two different families which have bad tempers, one at the beginning states of their lives, the other all the way through, though the most of them can handle it.&nbsp; I can, too.&nbsp; For the most part.&nbsp; I bottle it up, though, storing it away.&nbsp; I'll stand up for myself and my friends, true enough, but many a thing which angers me, I merely glare at and do nothing. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She, myself, one of her female friends&nbsp;and Brad and Robert were at an all right movie thing at the new movie theatre in our city.&nbsp; I started the evening, for some idiotic reason, in a black mood.&nbsp; I sat high and away from them during the first movie which, for the following reasons, was probably a better thing than I'd imagined. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A couple guys, I'm not sure of their age; I never did see them, were dumping popcorn onto her and her friend through out the movie.&nbsp; I don't know why, but this made me insanely angry for some reason. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My anger isn't just anger.&nbsp; I get frustrated frequently, but hold it in.&nbsp; All that frustration boils, not into only anger, but what has been described bloodthirsty rage.&nbsp; *shrugs*&nbsp; It might sound rediculous, but it's true.&nbsp; When I heard what these guys were doing to them when we'd left the little theatre with the crowd, I crushed my cup and stormed back inside the theatre, looking for, you guessed it, blood. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, it's a good thing that I didn't sit with them, else I would have been arrested for whatever I was going to do to them.&nbsp; *sighs deeply, shaking his head*&nbsp; I used to be a little shit disturber in elementary school, but I wouldn't want that coming around again now, when I can be charged with things.&nbsp; I agree with rules and try to follow them to the best of my ability. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't know whether she couldn't handle it or what, but my anger was, and is, a huge problem.&nbsp; It might have been one of the benefactors in the incident. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I visited her Grandma with her in the hospital upon several occasions. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Something else to explain...&nbsp; Death isn't a big deal to me.&nbsp; I am a strong Christian, and believe that you are going to go where you are deserving of.&nbsp; Her Grandmother died, and was, is, gone from this world.&nbsp; That's it.&nbsp; Didn't bother me, but seeing her in pain did. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The unfortunate thing about that was, though, that I rarely saw the pain she was harbouring.&nbsp; She, like me, bottled it up and talking about my problems helped divert attention from her's...&nbsp; At least, that's what her Mother said. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her parents and I became close.&nbsp; They liked me a lot, and I reciprocated the feelings.&nbsp; The same with her little sisters.&nbsp; Anyway... &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During the Christmas break, I think it was, she called when I had Brad and Robert over.&nbsp; (Something else I missed.&nbsp; They are actually blood brothers, twins though not identical.&nbsp; We call each other brothers because we might as well be for the amount we care for each other.)&nbsp; She told me that she was at her friend's place for the week, out of town and just *shrugs* having a good time.&nbsp; *frowns and, rubbing his eyes, shakes his head with another deep sigh*&nbsp; I'm such a fool... &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Brad and she never lost track with each other, it was only she and I because we were both so bull headed... (another thing I love about her.&nbsp; She's tough.)&nbsp; He could feel there was something wrong when he talked to her over the phone, so she told him the whole story.&nbsp; The story that she wouldn't tell me and for, I guess, good reason.&nbsp; She made him swear not to tell me, for she wanted to tell me in her own time. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't know how long later it was...&nbsp; It could have been that weekend Sunday, or the next weekend Sunday, but it was a Sunday, directly before the second Semester started.&nbsp; It was late and one of Brad and I's friends had told me that Brad needed to speak with me before ten o'clock over MSN, that it was urgent.&nbsp; How urgent could it be...?&nbsp; I had no idea, though I'll give you a hint. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Brad is like a rock.&nbsp; He helps others with their problems, listening and giving out adivice, good advice, as he sees fit (I do this, as well when the opportunity arises), and he is able to keep his ground solid beneath his feet, looking ahead with a level stare.&nbsp; His reason for wanting to talk over MSN and not on the phone was because he didn't want me to hear him crying.&nbsp; That's fair.&nbsp; I'd rather not him hear me crying when I started, as well. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The things he told me...&nbsp; I had my shoulder dislocated once.&nbsp; Torn out of the socket and shoved into my back.&nbsp; It was excrutiating.&nbsp; This was worse.&nbsp; I would rather go through that a thousand times, than this ever, even have the memory of this. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She hadn't gone to her friend's place that week.&nbsp; At least not directly.&nbsp; She was so stressed out from work, school and family that her animosity with her parents was growing steadily.&nbsp; She and her Mother finally had it out, and she ran away.&nbsp; Where, you might ask?&nbsp; I'm sure your first guess would be to her friend's place.&nbsp; Maybe. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No, she was running to the home of a twenty or so year old guy she'd met at the hospital, and who had, if memory serves, been making advances on her in whatever way, be it shy or aggressive; I don't know. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Five hours before Brad began telling me these things, I was on the phone with her.&nbsp; I finally told her that I'd realized I love her.&nbsp; The same night that I find out she was running away from her family, from me, the same night that I found out she'd been thinking about breaking up with me for months. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It might have been my neglect for her problems, rather than letting her prode at mine, or the fact that my anger had gotten the better of me an amazing amount that once, and has been a subject of debate before.&nbsp; It might be that... I'm just not good enough for her.&nbsp; Now, do not think I'm being sarcastic there.&nbsp; I say that in all honesty. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first time we left each other, six years ago, we hated each other.&nbsp; The second time, I loved her and she... didn't care about me.

      Kindergarden was an interesting time.&nbsp; I'd just moved to the city with the name that rhymes with something dirty in the Southern region of Saskatchewan from a city just a few hours North of it, also in Saskatchewan.&nbsp; I didn't know anyone, save for my family, extended or not.&nbsp; Going into the class was a little strange, though it was encouraging that one of the first things I saw was fairly amazing.  Keep in mind, I was five...ish... at the time.  As I stood in the little hallway from the door outside leading to the overly colorful classroom, the door to the outside world opened again.&nbsp; I can't remember if there was anyone behind this one figure, but she stood there, haloed by the bright sun of the late summer day.&nbsp; It was like an angel had come to kindergarden, only she was very short.&nbsp; And striking.&nbsp; And mischevious.&nbsp; And... it was a very special time meeting&nbsp; her.  I don't know if I loved her.&nbsp; Probably not, as I was pre-pubecent elementary schooler, skinny like I was Etheopian, quick and energetic like some rediculous tiny clone of 'the Flash'.  I did have a crush on her, though.&nbsp; Maybe it was how the sun glistened off of her hair, or the way she presented herself, but I was infatuated, even if I'd never admit it, even to myself.  Life went on seemingly normally, though there were excursions within the huge tractor tires half burried vertically in the play ground with her, upon where we practiced what we thought we'd have to do eventually.&nbsp; Apparently, though, kissing and hiding in the tires wasn't a very discrete thing to do.&nbsp; Word spread, and after that I was made fun of promptly every day.  I'd like to set something straight right now.&nbsp; I am the product of two families who are naturally broad shouldered, and have amazingly bad tempers during youth at the very least.&nbsp; Being drawn out with petty childish insults, I lost my temper and got into a fight every day afterward.&nbsp; Kindergarden wasn't a treat at recess, but it was great during the actual schooling, as kindergarden is want to be.

      I've never done anything like this before... not really, anyway.&nbsp; I'm sure, though, it'll be an interesting outlet, just growling about things which annoy and/or grate at me.&nbsp; I may not be regular, but I'll be intence.&nbsp; Heh, I guess I really don't have to worry about what I put up here, though.&nbsp; Chances are, no ones going to be reading it.  The only thing I've ever done similar to this before was some rediculous journal when I was quite young, composed mainly of the musings of a seven year old who thought he knew what he wanted.&nbsp; Turned out in the end, though, that he did know one thing of that.&nbsp; Unfortunately, it slit his throat in the end, not literally speaking, of course.  Well, that and a little bit of self hating, self pitying garbadge...&nbsp; It was sad, really.

      Campanoe. An eight day long canoeing camp that is derived from the Scouting movement I'm in in Canada. It's a good camp, and I've been there four years, including this year. This year was my first year as a CL, or Challenge Leader. They basically get all the bitch work, as the CL directors like to call it. First day we went to a nearby free copse of trees and cut a bunch down for spars for lashing. It chopped down three before a big blister on my left hand finally decided to explode in a rather more literal sence than I would have liked. It tore open, pussed a bit and just stung horribly for a while. The chopping was fun, though. (Note to self; next time? bring gloves so as not to get blisters.) The next day a friend of mine whose real name, believe it or not, is Pepar, went on the first year program. That is, the activities which those who have never taken any of the courses before go on. The camp is based around Good Spirit lake. It's a man made lake, and made mostly, I believe, from the good spirits of those who live around it. Why? Well, for one, that doesn't really look like water... And anyway, the people with cabins around there are mostly partiers and pricks, so the good spirits are low, just like the water level. It takes three minutes to walk to the water from the tree line, and another fifteen before it's shoulder level. So, Pepar and I go on the first year program, which is set to canoe around most of the smallish lake with a group of approximately thirteen year olds, as well as six or so of their Leaders. Most of the kids were great. The canoeing director Jeremy was great. Most of the Leaders were great. Most of them. There were two people from the same family on the trip together. One was a Leader one year older than I, and the other was his little sister who was a participant. About one year ago, their oldest brother killed himself. I don't know if I've stated how I feel about suicide before, but I have no respect for those who kill themselves. There should be nothing in life so bad as to end it prematurely. Yes, I have thought about it on many occasion, but there is no honor in suicide, my family and friends would suffer needlessly, and I would be a foolish coward. I feel badly for the family of the one who killed himself, but that still does not excuse their actions. Firstly, the younger sister constantly contradicted Pepar and I, mostly Pepar. We finally had to get her Leaders to 'tune her in' as it were. We only had one problem with the rest of the small group of kids with us, and that was more or less spurred by Pepars inspired speech on mutiny. Yes, he's got an IQ of 160, but he can be less than a genius sometimes. Secondly, her older brother was a, I don't want to say pain in the ass, but a massive ache in my posterior. At least for only a few moments. The entire group was in a cooking shelter composed of a tarp tied to surrounding trees. There was little to sit on, so people took whatever they could find. I didn't know that he was a Leader, and it really doesn't matter that much. There was a plastic green box in the shelter, and kids sitting on it was wrecking it, squishing and deforming it, so we kicked them off of it in a not unkind manner. This one sits down on it during breakfast, and I ask him to get off of it, saying it's wrecking the box. He replied, "I'll do it when I'm done my pancakes." There are a few things that make me incredibly angry, and one of them is people ignoring me. I never hit girls under almost any circumstances, save for when they are attacking me with intent to leathally hurt, which has never happened. A girl I was having a conflict with merely ignored me and refused to work it out. I talked to her, and she acted like I wasn't there. I almost killed her, in a very literal sence. Instead, I growled a lot and left the room to vent. This 'Leader' ignored me. I replied to him, "How about now?" and he didn't look at me, acted as if I were talking to someone else. When he stopped eating, I confronted him about it, and he started swearing at me, bitching and what not. "Well, I'm a Leader." That gave me pause. I didn't know he was a Leader. I merely assumed he was a participant from his age and from his actions. "That doesn't matter. When I say something that applies to everyone, that means everyone." He stood and left. His brother killed himself. I'm sorry. To my knowledge it was a year ago, and doesn't merit him being an asshole, and disrespecting a CL in front of participants, as well as acting like a child. When we returned to base camp, in fact on the second last day, we had a water fight. I left my button up black and red plaid flannel shirt on a table so as not to get it wet, and a friend of mine picked it up and took it back to his site, presumably to make sure I got it later. What he did wrong was hang it on the tent of a pair of people, one of which is the younger brother of said 'Leader', and the other is an immature, loud mouthed, head strong, conceited know-it-all. Yes, I realize I'm probably at the very least half of those things, but I like to think I have a modicum of control. He doesn't usually. I went to the site to get the shirt, and found it on a picnick table, wet, dirty and covered in bits of grass and whatnot. It was less than pleased. The friend who had taken it there had said that the younger brother and the immature one, as well as the 'Leader' had thrown it from the tent and stomped on it. Another of their Leaders had seen this also. I had two witnesses. When I talked to them, they all told me they'd not touched it. Then they'd said they'd merely thrown it from the tent. After a grueling bit of growling conversation, I finally conceeded they weren't going to tell me the truth. I shouldn't have been surprised. The younger brother and immature one were standing in front of me side by side, and the 'Leader' was several fifteen feet or so back. I was talking to the first two, and he was standing back there smirking as if the entire thing was hilarious, and he didn't want to show it. "What the hell are you smirking about back there, eh?" Apparently, anything I say to him now merits him blowing his top. "Hey, fuck you. Now yer gonna tell me what kinda facial expressions I can and can't have? Fuck you. Fuck off. I don't wanna fuckin' fight with you. You've been fuckin' houndin' me all week." One confrontation and I've been 'hounding him all week'. He's got the mind of a seven year old in the body of a seventeen year old, with the mouth of a sailor. Lovely. He walked off, ignoring his problems again and refusing to even  try  to fix them. Once again, I hate it when people ignore me, and I hate it when people ignore solvable conflicts. He did both. When he came back, I started talking again, and all he had to say to me was random swearing and smart ass comments, nothing of real value. The Camp Chief was standing right there, and didn't stop us. I assume he either thought I could handle it, or just didn't want to get involved or something... The later is possibly less likely, considering this is the Camp Chief who wont stop fights with words, but with dirty fighting. "I do whatever I need to to win. Twist nipples, bite, lick, scratch, whatever." Gllen Cook has been with Campanoe for tweny odd years. Great guy. So I didn't even give the 'Leader' a second glance for the rest of the camp. Another friend of mine on the camp, a girl by the name of Sam, was feeling incredibly badly Friday night. Her Grandmother, her best friend, the one she told everything to, did everything with, loved with all her heart, had been in the hospital for a while, and Sam had had a horrible feeling about her. She is a tough girl. She'll kick your ass. She's never needed to try to kick my ass, but I have little doubt she would go for it. She was hurting because of this terrible feeling, crying, just feeling horrible. She couldn't get a hold of her parents; there was no answer at her home. She just wanted to get home, so that she could find out what was wrong, if anything. The next day at the BBQ, her boyfriend came back from the third year trip (she was a CL), and her Dad came. They all drove back, and she was already tearing from the news that her Grandmother had died. I wish I could have helped her more than telling her to go to bed so that the next day would come faster instead of sitting there and feeling horrible, but... what could I do?   ...

      I guess this is more or less a continuation of my last post, entitled 'Fears', but that's all right (this also gives me a chance to explain my 'doors' item). Just seems my mind has been on the subject of that certain door in my mind that I keep nigh forever closed.  I have to explain something about 'doors'.  This term in my mental capacity means something much different than people may think.  When I speak of doors in my mind, I speak of all the different bits of myself, all the different 'me's who influcence what I do everyday.  I'll try to list as many of them as I can think of, but there are just... too many, really.  As well, I'll explain what their door in my mind looks like, what it represents.  Past that, the size of the door and how close it is to the 'center', my consciousness, is how influencial it is.  It's like the center is in a circular room with a low roof all made of dark brick, very little light about.  There are a seemingly infinite number of hallways going off of this room, all leading to a door which is completely unique from it's bretheren.  The closer the door to the center, the closer to my conscious through those feelings are, and the size of the door represents  how large a part of my personality the item is.  Anger, rage.  The door is massive and covered in flames.  It towers above all the rest, seemingly, and is never far from the center.  It is usually an indentation in the wall, a short hallway to the huge door, but it moves forward at times, scratching on the cobblestone floor, toward the center and toward showing what he feels like.  Within is a vision of myself with death in his gaze and seemingly unmatchable strength in his limbs, chained always back and away.  That door should never open.  But sometimes, it does.  Honor.  This door, too, is massive.  There are times when Honor and Anger battle for closeness to the center and for supremacy of influence.  This door has a great huge sword with the blade pointing downward carved exquisitely into the wood, the representation of strength, skill, and justice.  The right.  This door is always either flush with the wall, open, or pushed forward, as if more important than the rest.  A vision of myself in armour with a sword identical to the one emblazened upon the door at his hip.  This is my honor, the one who shows me right from wrong in all things when he is able.  Knowledge.  The door of knowldge, of the want to know and the storing of things known is large enough, but pales in comparison to those such as Honor and Anger.  Though not huge, it is almost always outstretched from the wall, the need to know, to learn things always influencing the center.  Upon it's front is merely the title of 'Knowledge' in fine script, the door rectangular instead of arched at the top as the rest are.  It is in the likeness of a closed book, though is almost always open.  Inside is the vision of myself clad in a scholar's robes and my glasses, hair tied back so as not to impede my reading.  Pain.  This door holds everything which hurts, mind, body or soul.  It has carved sharply and rashly upon it scenes of grotesquery, of the downtrodden, of things that would sink one's spirits to even see, let alone peer within.  This door is a fairly medium sized door compared to Anger and Honor, and is never far away.  It is closer to the center than is Anger, but still not quite flush with the walls of the dark brick room.  Inside is a vision of myself, naked and cowering, weeping and dirty, bloody and shaking.  He riles Anger, much of the time.  The Lover.  This door is similar to Pain in its size only.  The scenes upon it are beautiful, provocative things to quicken the blood and breath.  They are subtle, though, not a nipple or bottom shown.  Tasteful.  Here holds all the drive to make the one I am with enjoy love in all its forms as much or if possible more than I.  Within is a vision of myself bearing a dark red, almost black silken robe about himself, as well as a massive canopied bed with sheets of the same hue as the robe.  This door is only so far back from the surface,  nigh several inches to being flush with the wall.  It is open at all the appropriate times.  Lust, the pervert.  This door is so much smaller than the Lover's that the difference is barely noticable at times.  It, though, is always closed if possible, always pushed back meter after meter away from the center.  Upon the door are scenes of fornication which are both arousing and upon occasion disgusting.  Inside is a vision of myself sitting down with an ever present smile, different from that of the Lover's.  This is for me.  All for me.  What I want only, be it wrong or not.  Within are pictures pasted to the dingy walls similar to those upon the door outiside.  The Wild.  This door stands in equality to Honor and Anger for size, but is nigh always silent, pushed back miles down a dark corridor away from the center.  Pain, Anger, Lust and merely being in my 'home' draw it forward with sickening speed.  Upon the door are merely two fur trees.  The door never opens.  I see to that.   What I fear, the main point of this, is the first door and the last two, and any combination therein.  Anger is bad enough on it's own, especially with me, but when combined with the  Wild, I fear for others and for myself.

      Everyone fears.  Some people are afraid of other people, of things in society.  There aren't that many things that scare me, and the things that do are obscure and don't happen that frequently.  I'm afraid of heights to an extent.  If I'm on a plane, it doesn't bother me.  A ladder doesn't bother me, or a roof top.  Hmph.  It's a rather subded fear, I guess.  That's a small fear, and a common one with people.  My real fear is... probably less common.  I'm afraid of myself more than anything in life, maybe more than helplessness.  Maybe.  I hate that my rage seeps into my mind, and I hate that I love it.  It scares me.  I don't want to hurt anyone.  Yes, I'm strong...  I don't know how strong, I don't know if I can even punch hard.  I don't want to go feral sometime and hurt someone, because I would.  When I was still going out with her, Brad, Rob, her, one of her friends and I were out at an all nighter movie thing.  I was, for whatever reason, in a horrible mood that night.  The first movie we went to, I sat five or so rows higher in the theater than the rest of them.  It turned out to be a good idea.  During the movie, these two little bastards poured their popcorn on her and her friend.  I'm glad I wasn't there.  When the movie ended and and I heard about it, I went back into the theater to find them.  My vision was slightly blurred and all I cared about was finding and hurting them.  I loved the feeling, the rage.  I didn't find them, and I'm glad I wasn't sitting with them.  I would have hurt them badly.  Very badly.  The seats were on a steep slope and I'm betting one or both of them would have gone flying.  I hate not being able to help people.  It scares the hell out of me.  For all my strength, stubborness and ability, it's the worst thing in the world almost to not be able to do anything.

      Why do I hold back sometimes?  Why do I back off during some things?  I don't trust myself.  Plain and simple.  I wont go too far, and I wont let go.  There always has to be some modicum of restraint over myself.  I will not let go.  That's why I'll never get drunk; there's too much chance to... do something.

      My oldest friends, my Brothers.  Bradley, the silent truth.  You are to me as a cornerstone is to a tower of rocks.  Indespensible, respected immeasureably, strong, immovable, intelligent.  We will live and die together, I pray, by each other's sides.  Robert, the blinding right.  You, too, are a cornerstone in my life.  You show the light to Brad's darkness, the perfect optimism to his blatant truth.  I need and love both.  With you at my side, we can do anything together.    Pepar, the brain.  I've known you too long to know you so little.  You are a good man, book smart and indulgent.  I love how you live your life; to it's fullest.  Lacey, the whip.  You are there for me always when I need you.  All your comments, subtle or otherwise, always hit with suddeness and great effectiveness.  Sara, the river.  When I was lost and thirsty you found me and gave me water.  You are similar to Brad in that when I need it you will soak me in what thunderous truth I need.  Julie, the wind.  Subtle and smiling, you're like the breeze here in Victoria in the summer; refreshing during a particularily hot and trying day, and always giving that little push no matter when.   Thank you always for being there for me.

      Why am I the way I am, and do the things I do? Why do people see me as they do and I see things so radically differently? I don't know. I don't understand. I don't understand how someone could love me, when I hate myself.  My parents love me, of course. My close friends, and... There are a few who, for whatever reason I cannot derive, really love me.  One I had met through role playing a long time ago; I'm not sure when. She was a good RPer and she'd mistook me for someone else, talking to me out of character. A long time later, after talking to each other about our problems in life (mostly her to me, as I hate talking) she says that she loves me.  She, Sherri, has not had the best life. Her ex-husband is a bastard, and the man she is with now is... different. She lost her kids to her ex, lost her whole life almost to this man. She is around forty years old, whereas I am seventeen. I don't understand how she could, and it pains me that I cannot bring her happiness by returning it. I love her as a friend, a good friend, but nothing differently than that. She understands this.  Lacey, this bright, happily exaggerating girl who is aggressive, smart and so many other things. I don't know if what she feels for me can be called love. I just don't know enough. I do know that her feelings are strong, and that as chances go I'll never have the ability to truely return this feeling. I want to, if not for her happiness, then for mine, but there are too many things.  It is similar with Sara. Strong willed, grinning and quick witted. It is very similar with her, and these things, too, pain me. I can't do anything about them anymore than I already am. I fear it isn't enough.  I love Brit. I always will. I wonder sometimes if I always had, ever since I'd first layed eyes upon her. I will never be with her again; there is no hope there, I have recognized. I will love again, but I would bet that I'll never actually marry. There are always too many things in the way, too many obtrusive factors shoving themselves our way.  My 'love life' brings me smiles, brings me happiness and joy, it is the best and worst thing going for me. It fills me, and then guts me.

      He is my brother and nothing will ever change that.  Nothing.  I will fight hell, bitch slap Lucifer and burn a city before I forsake him.  He is my blood and my mind and my fellow soul.  But sometimes I don't understand him.  I have three friends who I've known for a fair time.  Nowhere near eleven years, but a good deal, still.  I like them.  These are nice girls.  He has things against them.  I don't know if it's merely dislike, annoyance... *frowns deeply after a moment*  Actually, with him, those seem to be the most appropriate descriptors for it, I'd bet.  It just frustrates me.  Firstly, he hides it and doesn't confront them.  If you've read the rest of my posts, you'd know that I fiercely hate it when people don't take care of their conflicts, run from them.  It softens that hatred because he is my brother.  Secondly, the things he says about them just don't seem right to me.  The things he seems to have against them seem... irrational.  I merely think we have two different views, likes and dislikes.  He is my brother and I love him, and we wont always see eye to eye, but that's to be expected.  Just because they're my friends doesn't mean they have to be his, just... seemed like the kind of people he likes; not that stupid carbon copy of everyone else; interesting.  Brad, if you ever read this, we are blood.  We are brothers.  That is who we are.

      I really just realized something when I was in the shower a little while ago.  Well, a few things, but one thing in particular.  I'll never see her again.  Chances are, the only image of her face I'll see will be the pictures of her I have, which I refuse to look at...  How do I know this?  I can't be around her.  I just can't.  She doesn't care about me, and I'll never stop loving her.  Which is the second reason why I'll probably never see her again; she doesn't care enough for me to make contact of any sort.  Makes me sick, not for spite of her, but just because... she doesn't  care.  I realized that I only began to understand that I hate myself after the whole thing with her occured.  Now, I didn't have high self esteem before that.  I had a kind of self respect, sure, but I definately didn't like myself.  It's  no better, now.  I think she stopped caring because I was, and am, so bloody depressing.  I can just get so damned down sometimes, and she just couldn't handle it.  *shrugs*  I can't blame her.  Whenever we'd go out, she'd always bring a group of other friends along instead of just our little circle of friends...  I don't know why I was always so downed by this, and other facts when we were out together.  Doesn't really matter, though.  I buggered up, there.  The rage couldn't have helped.  *frowns and sighs*  Oh well.  Talking about being depressed, here I am again in my little pathetic pit of sorrow.  Boo hoo.

      I'm part of the Gaia Online forums.  I posted a thread asking people if they thought I was attractive/good looking or not.  I hadn't thought of it before and it seemed like a good idea.  I put up a poll with a yes or no answer.  No took ninty four percent of the vote, with sixteen to one.  Heh, that's what I thought.  There was one person, though, who changed their 'dicision' after finding out 'no' was the answer I was looking for.  Strange.

      My Dad and I got up this morning and got to work in his backyard after having a well sized breakfast.  He has a cement patio in his backyard against the back fence where he'd like to build a new shed after he tears down the other one.  Around the front and to either side is a four level high cinderblock wall.  The top level was mortared in the wrong way, so that the holes in the cinderblocks were facing outward, making holes in the walls.  Past that, there were piles of junk, rocks and dirt.  There must have been about seven hundred and fifty pounds of debris that I hauled today, in something like thirty degrees Celcius.  Heh, it was great fun.  My Dad, first of all, is a very funny man.  That definately makes things go faster, not to mention some good rock on the radio.  Physical work like that is, I think, a lot of fun.  I was sweating, exertiny myself and bloody hot.  It was a great time.  Heh, paper work can burn in hell.

      I realized a little while ago after noticing how frequently I check my e-mail and this page, that, no matter how little I want to talk about these things or really for people to know about them, I do want people to read my posts here, to know what I'm like and to give me whatever feedback they think of.  I guess I'm a fairly people oriented person.
