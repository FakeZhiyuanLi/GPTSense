      good afternoon..  wow today has been totally hardcore packing...  extremely stressful.. i was like 2 seconds away from beating the crap out of my sisters and having a total meltdown at the same time... so i took a nap and that kind of worked.   i saw some of my friends today and they were sad..  i feel sorry for them...  but anyway, i am soooo sick of this packing crap.  its like my schedule for this whole week is get up early, pack until dinner, pack some more, and go to bed late, so i'm running on very little sleep.   and once again my sister is bugging me and driving me insane...  god don't u just love little sisters???  i'm going to sleep for like a week when we get to hartley i swear..  and this sucks my mom won't let me get on msn cuz we have too much to do...  but whatever.  yeah i better go toss some more stuff in boxes so i'll type later..  love u kait..... jon

      wow this day is dragging... i've been getting on msn like every 5 minutes seeing if kait's on...  i'm just waiting until i have to help my parents again..  man this week has sucked...  if u have ever moved u know what i'm talking about.  one of my friends was like crying last nite when i talked to her... i felt bad.   but i think i'm going to like hartley tho.. i'll be close to tara, and some other people... i'll be farther away from kait tho..  thats the only drawback i think...  oh well...  i get my license in november so i can go visit her more often then.  and we'll see each other at youth council too...  i love her so much tho its hard to explain or describe..  being away from her hurts so badly...  well i'll probably get on later tonite again, so i might get to talk to her.....  hooray.  that would make me very happy. still nothing new around here...  so i better hit the road.  i love u kait.. jon

      hello again.  just got back from signing up for classes at school..  it was wonderful. anyhoo, i wasn't able to type for like the last 24 hours because our internet was down for some reason... i don't know why.  it made me really mad.  but yeah its back!  yay!  umm....  what has happened in the last two days...  i know!  i had band "camp" if thats what you would call it..  more like marching around then playing some tunes and leaving but yeah.  the first night i was so scared..  i knew literally no one except a few kids who went to my church, none of which played percussion, so i had no one to talk to.  the second night was better, a kid talked to me..  i think he played trumpet but he was nice so yeah it was cool.  it made me happy.  and i cleaned my room last night at like 11, i don't know why.  i just felt like cleaning.  but then i couldn't sleep until midnight, and i woke up at 2 and someone was taking a shower and i'm just thinking, what the crap??  so i was pretty groggy this morning, i had my alarm set for 7:30 but slept thru it (i'm trying to start waking up earlier to get ready for school..  that didn't work..)  so i woke up, took a shower and ate 2 muffins, ran out the door into the car, and we left for my meeting, and now i'm here.  ta da!  do i win a prize or something...  ? ....   well, i can't really think of anything else to put in here so i think i'm just going to...  oh wait!  my friend from minnesota whom i talk about a lot for some reason, zaac is finally moved into his new house too...  lol we moved at like the same exact times..  it was freaky.  but he plays guitar and stuff so he has a band room (YES!)  and i really want to go up there before school starts..  it would be the coolest.  he just started up a band and wants me to be the drummer which would be sweet.  so yeah i'll stop rambling and leave now.  later kait-*hugs and kisses* love you always jon

      hey all.  my day's been very good.  if i were grading it i would give it an A.  i think its because i just talked to kait and i'm just sitting here looking at the picture of her and i'm just so happy...  i know i love her with all my heart, no doubt about it.  i could marry this chick...  she's amazing.  from her blog, i know she feels the same way, and that makes me even happier..  i'm just like high on kait.  i want her all the time..  she's the coolest girl ever...  i don't know how to describe it even.  i'm just so happy.  every person in the world should be able to feel as great as i do now...  then they would know why i'm feelin SUPER HAT!!  i want to be with her so badly..  my day wasn't even that great, it was just coming home from band and talking to her, and i felt soo good.  so kait, you made my day perfect.  =)  besides talking to kait my day was made up of going to the doctor, getting tetanus shot, playing basketball with tara and her cousin cody (she had brought over our house key from feeding our cats and then we saw cody riding his bike, so we filled up the basketball hoop thingy with water and played for a while..  pretty fun), unloading most of our huge van that was filled up with stuff from hubbard, taking a shower, and going to band which wasn't too bad cuz everyone else there was clueless too.  so yeah my day wasn't too specacular...  like i said i'm high on kait..  i love her i love her i love her!  *sigh* i can't wait till labor day... then i get to see her!  that will be great...  fantastic..  wonderful...  spectacular, neato, etc. you get the picture lol.  i probably better get going...  got things to not do, places to lazily scroll thru on the web, people to ignore...  yup thats about it lol.  later jon

      good morning.  i just felt like getting on and typing a little before my...  dun dun dun...  PHYSICAL.   ugh...  i hate physicals...  they feel you up and poke needles in you and smile about it the whole time..  it freaks me out.  but other than that, i get to write a paper about nye to send to my former pastor!  how fun..   so yeah, i'm not looking forward to today..  that and i have band camp starting tonight.  ew.  i'm going to be there and not know anyone at all because the first night is for freshmen and stuff, and even tho i'm not a freshman, i have to go, which sucks...  i'm going to feel very lost.  i woke up this morning thinking about kait..  that made me happy  but then it made me sad because she wasn't there.  i miss her so much..  well i'll type later g2g.  peace i adore you kait jon

      hola. its like 11 at nite and i don't really know why i'm typing now... my parents are downstairs (they fell asleep watching the olympics) and i just had a craving to type. anyway, today was pretty much completely uneventful. i did nothing... literally. tomorrow i have band tho.. so that should be.... um... interesting? sure. i talked to kait tonight and that made me sooo happy.... actually i wrote something for her... i'll stick it in here somewhere... ew that sounds so wrong but yeah.... lol. i still can't get on to read her blog.. that made me really mad.. its cool to read about what she's thinking. it keeps saying i have to have an administrator's code or something... its stupid. i'm always thinking about her... just the smallest things make me think of her, like if i see an orange hat i remember the ut visor that she got at nye.. sometimes they make me sad, and others make me happy.. but i really just want to be with her now.. especially now. well i can't really think of anything else to type so i think i'll put in that thing i wrote.  staring at your photograph in my bed tonight, i can't help counting down the days until i can see your face again. you are so far away, and it hurts to not be able to see you each and every day. i remember the care in your embrace and i feel so alone now. my stereo sets the rhythym for my sadness and hope. i look up at the cloudy night sky and know it is the same that you see, and it comforts, but not enough to dull the pain that i feel when you aren't here. i remember you there by my side. holding your hand, wishing a day could last an eternity. signing off with "i love you" every night, nothing else in the universe could be so true. they say that all things that have a beginning have an end. i hope desperately that they could be wrong. i love you too much for that.  its not much, but i figure its what i feel, and so what better way to describe it, right? lol anyway, i probably better get off.. before i get in trouble.. so later all. i love you kait jon

      ok.. i know i said i was back.. but then i didn't write anything for like 10 days... we've been reeally busy. like this week we've been at hubbard painting, patching, wallpapering, and more painting.. it sucked. but at least we got to go to adventureland.. that was fun. it was hilarious too. my second cousin who's like 4 was at a magician show at adventureland and the guy did a trick, and she yelled out "is that all you got?" it was soo funny. but yeah i went on like everything.. except the spinning things.. my stomach can't handle those. but the main reason i couldn't get on my blog here is that my mom's comp wouldn't let me access my own website.. it was completely stupid. so i had to wait for my room to get hooked up with internet.. and when i finally did, i couldn't get on because we were always unpacking.. it drove me crazy. i could only get on at night for a little while.. and i didn't have time to type. but yeah, this time i think i'm back for sure... maybe.. i think... well anyway, we got to go to jordan creek mall in des moines! it was cool... but i hated their hot topic. it didn't have any of the shirts that i wanted to buy. they just had like metallica and slipknot and metal crap.. and that sucked.. but i got a cool shirt at pacsun. so that made my day. but i was thinking about kait the whole time that i was in hubbard and des moines.. literally. like i would space off and just think about how much i love her... i missed her incredibly. but then i got to stop in humbolt on the way back to hartley last nite and we got to spend what.. and hour together? i don't know... but it was fun.. we went on a walk and played basketball and sat by her fire pit.. i wish i could just stay for like a week in humbolt with my grandma some time and kait and i could hang out and do fun stuff... but now school is too close... 10 days.. urgh.. but yeah i am going to get to see her on labor day i hope.. so thats good. but i thik i beter go.. i'll type later. peace =) kait-"i love you" is the truest thing i could ever say to you... jon

          hey all!  we are now at hartley, and still working on getting moved in... but anyway, i got my dad to get internet for at least one comp in my mom's sewing room..  it's really slow, but i'm doing what i can....  i was hoping that kait might be on, but she wasn't..  man not having my comp online was driving me insane.. literally.  i was like soooo bored and lonely... not cool.  but i did get to spend some time with kait yesterday.. it was awesome.  we didn't do anything spectacular, but it was cool to just hang out with her... i was so happy yesterday.. i can't even describe it.  with her there it was like heaven..  i have a lot to type about regarding "the move" but i'll type later...  my mom says i have a half hour time limit, which sucks.  but yeah, i think i can get my comp in my room wired by tomorrow... hopefully.  i love my room, but i'll talk about that later..  gotta get going, so says my mom.  so, i'll just play out my half hour and hope that kait gets on.. that would make my mediocre day a whole lot better...  well better go.  later...  kait, you complete me =)..... jon
