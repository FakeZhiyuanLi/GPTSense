        &nbsp; PROBLEMS WITH GIRLS  IF u TREAT her nicely, she says u are IN LOVE with  her;  If u Don't,&nbsp; she says u are PROUD.  If u DRESS Nicely,&nbsp; she says u are trying to LURE  her;  If u Don't, she says u are from HYDERABAD.  If u ARGUE with her, she says u are STUBBORN;  If u keep QUIET,! she says u have no BRAINS.  If u are SMARTER than her,&nbsp; she'll lose FACE;  If she's Smarter than u, she is GREAT.  If u don't Love her,&nbsp; she tries to POSSESS u;  If u Love her, she will try to LEAVE u.(very true  huh?)  If u don't make love with her., she says! u don't  Love her;  If u do!!&nbsp; she says u are CHEAP.  If u tell her your PROBLEM,&nbsp; she says u are  TROUBLESOME;  If u don't,&nbsp; she says that u don't TRUST her.  If u SCOLD her, u are like a CHACHA to her;  If she SCOLDS u, it is because she CARES for u.  If u BREAK your PROMISE, u Cannot be TRUSTED;  If she BREAKS hers,&nbsp; she is FORCED to do so.  If u do WELL in your exams, she says it's LUCK;  If she does WELL, it's BRAINS.  If u HURT her, u are CRUEL;  If she HURTS u, u are too SENSITIVE!! &amp; sooo hard to  please!!  If u send this to girls, they will swear that it's  not true....... but if u don't, they say u are  selfish.....  The moral of the story is.......SEND THIS TO GIRLS  OUT THERE ANYWAY...  Send it to boys also, gives them some laughter ...    Words to remember for a while  Boys are like apples on trees. The best ones are at  the top of the&nbsp; tree.  &nbsp; The girls don't want to reach for the good ones  because they're afraid of falling and getting hurt.  Instead they just get the rotten apples that are on  the ground, that aren't as good, but easy.    So the apples at the top think that there is something  wrong with them,when in reality, they are amazing.    That is why we just have to be a little patient and  the right girl, the one who takes a chance to find the  good, right apple, will come someday...     So Although i am alone...this means that  i am on top of the tree....one day aishwarya must come to me; just i shud not tired before that....    Best Of Luck.....   &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; its all just for fun .Don't take it as serious, ok  SUBHAM
