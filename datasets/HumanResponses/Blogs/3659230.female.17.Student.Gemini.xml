      LUIS: You are a special case.  Sometimes it seems like you belong in an insane asylum because you are just out of it.  You like having things your way, and if you don't get what want you are not happy because of this, you can be manipulative at times and or annoying. I have lots of fun insulting you, and making fun of little mistakes or things that happen to you.  JP. But you can be really clumsy and unorganized.  Oh yeah.  You sometimes don't act like yourself.  Ok enough of the negative cause the list can go on forever (joking)-not really.  You speak what is on your mind, you are not afraid to against the norm.  You can be a very determined person at times.  You are a very open person and you like meeting new people. You always look at the bright side, you are very optimistic.

      :: my horoscope for the day:: Although you might have been hard on yourself recently, now it's time to leave your value judgments behind you -- whether you were judging yourself or someone else. You have the ability to change your mind quickly when you get information that suggests you should. Now, not only can you do an about face (or at least a change of direction), but you also can surprise others with the suddenness and completeness of this shift.  :::::::::::::: Its so weird how these things describe what I'm going through each day, coooolllll, lol, i feel much better because i've reconciled with all this crap that's been bothering me, and atleast started with others instead of keeping mum. My goal is to have everything out in the open by Wednesday or Thursday or Friday or Saturday nah Sunday sounds better. Eh I keep on postponing things and I don't know why I'm not being myself and telling everybody what I think. But then again half of the problems I have is because I do that too much but I don't really want to think too much about what I have to say because then it doesn't come from the heart its more analytical, you know what i'm sayin? Eh i'm out for now. I wonder if anybody reads this but me...

      today i just exploded and it felt damned good. i knew that this was going to happen sooner or later that i would just burst because i've been keeping too much in for such a long amount of time. i think i'll finish it up and just tell everybody what's on my mind because some issues don't feel closed because i've never dealt with them head on to wrap them up. oh and queen you're right- i'mma work on that and maybe later on come back to that because i should do what you said to do. thanks for your advice and for puttin up with me (its a hard job i know lol)

      I am currently at school making up those days I took off. Its not that bad we were sweeping sawdust, sitting on our asses, then pretending to sweep sawdust, and now we're cleaning up some of the science classrooms, so its not too awful, although theres no one here to talk to, so i'm just sitting here listening to my music in my own little world.   I want to apologize to some people, you know who you are, i've been avoiding you without telling you and its just that i've been so busy and i have a lot on my mind that i need to just think about by myself without everybody tossing in their 2 cents about what i should do. i'm analyzing the situations and i'm gonna take care of them and i'll be back to my regular old self so just give me some time but meanwhile i'm sorry for being an extremely crappy friend, forgive me???  Well that's all I have to say for now, but since I am extremely bored don't be surprised if you see like 20 more posts (that I doubt anyone would read anyways...) buh bye!

      I'm feeling a little bit better, got many things that are bothering me off my chest. But... I'm still busy with all of these articles I'm writing so that I can be on the staff of this thing called Youth Connection and for the Chicago Defender and I'm entering all these writing contests, God I'm so busy!!! I need to make some time for fun now... hummmm. Oh and peoples, feel free to leave comments, I want some friggin comments!!! grrrr. theres not much to say really but when has that ever stopped me from talkin... heh... i'm debating on whether i'm going to put some of my poetry on here. so if you don't want to be tortured into readin it let me know and i wont do it but i am leaning on putting that up on here. right now i'm listing to dip it low and feel like gettin jiggy wit it (na na na na na na na) (na na na na na na) gettin jiggy wit it... okay i'll stop... tomorrow i'm gonna well hafta go work up at the school because i'm gonna be busy workin at dusable and walgreens, i hope that i'll have some sort of a social life after all of this. the first thing i'm gonna do is buy me a cell phone, cause i need one dammit!!! and then i'mma get me some new clothes... who wanna go shoppin with me??? its the chemicals i swear. my horoscope is confusing today, i kind of understand it but don't really. i think its saying that today i can either absorb all of the information that i'm being given or just focus on what i want to hear... i'd prefer the later... eh i don't know they shouldn't made the analogy thing, it makes me think and you know how much i hate that...well anyways i'm done with this for now... leave me comments...lol... well buh bye luff yaz!!!

      Ay! There is too much going on with 1. my mothers people, 2. my dad's declining health, 3. relationship difficulties, 4. myself, 5. the possible selling of our home, and the more and more I've been isolating myself from people the worse things seem to get. i thought if that if i stay to myself for a while that maybe i can sort out this mess myself. I guess that maybe its time to just go out and talk about whatevers on my mind because keeping all of these thoughts to myself. lately it feels like i can't really say whats on my mind to those that i usually do and if i do decide to give them a snippet its extremely editted and i don't really like doing that. i wish i could talk to people honestly now but i can't. it kind of worries me that the people who are closest to me can't tell that theres something up with me, am i putting on that good of a show.

      Sup peoples. Yeah this is my first entry, i hope this is something that i can actually keep up. Maybe it'll help me sort out some things going through my mind, which is alot... because keeping it to myself isn't working because lately it feels like i can't trust that many people its either people are critizing what i do WHICH I DON'T FUCKIN NEED!!! or if i say what i'm really thinkin people are all like "oh that's stupid" and will dismiss it and not give me a response you know but that's how i'm feeling and i just need to let all of it out. (yeah i know i'm being random) but yeah... lol... Well i guess that's enough for now or atleast until i figure out something else i want to say...  luff yaz, jen

      Pug  No bones about it, you're an intelligent, playful Pug. Witty and charming, you're a lot of dog wrapped in a small package. People just love you — a wonderful approachability and sense of humor put you at the top of everyone's list. And because you're smart and quick-witted, you attract a crowd wherever you go. (Have you ever considered running for office or starting a company? You've got the charisma for either.) But that doesn't mean you can't be a little naughty or mischievous when opportunity knocks — you've definitely got a nose for fun! A happy, optimistic breed, you're admired and respected by all. Woof!

      wow i have been so busy. everythings been so crazy lately. ive been so busy with work and all. at work things are cool- i can't wait til we get paid shit... i need some money man! today for work we had a little field trip; we went to the rainbow push thing where bill cosby and jesse jackson and judge mathis and bill clinton spoke at. they were talking about edumaction. things are going so fast lately, i'm so exhausted lately. i don't even feel like typing maybe i'll finish some of this during the weekend cause me is so sheepy.   ***a fact for 1 person- u know who u are... Did you know that out of the 36 million blacks in america, 6 million are poor, 80% of us are middle class- only 16% of blacks are poor despite the images the often flood the media. and out of those 16%- 50 to 76% in certain cities are iliterate and in jails because of nonviolent drug related crimes.
