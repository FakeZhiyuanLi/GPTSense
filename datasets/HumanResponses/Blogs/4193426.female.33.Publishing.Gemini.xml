      So -- Let's discuss the dream I had this morning. Should I contact Clyde Friday's boy, and tell him about the dream I had??  Here goes - I'm walking through a college campus Union, when I come across him. A storm is brewing, so I gotsta go -- this is when he offers to show me how to  fly  a car in a hurricane. It goes well, and when we "land," we're at the mall. We decide to shop. We go to Bath and Body. I decide to take a shower there, so I can try out the products. I take so long to shower, that he has the time to grow a mullet and then take a nap. I'm naked. I wake him up. We walk back to campus. I wake up.  Sometimes, life is better than dreams.

      In preparation for another camping trip over Labor Day weekend, I'd like to share a recent expedition B and I took to Point Lookout, MD, with some of her good friends from New York. We'll call them Chartreuse and Jethro. And it went a little something like this ...  Point Lookout has a campground that's nestled between the Potomac River and the Chesapeake Bay, at the southern most point of Maryland. It's about a 3-hour drive from the DC area via The Beltway and Rte. 5 -- a 2-lane highway that leads you right to the park, through some of MD's less sophisticated parts. More about that later. Anyway, I've got my Murano loaded to the gills with gear for both B and I (apparently B's idea of camping is, "Hey, can I sleep in your tent?"), including a huge cooler and an electric travel cooler filled with 2 cases of Miller Lite and Smirnoff Ice. (Don't ask.) Char and Jethro have a Toyota Tundra packed to the hilt, too, including about 7 coolers filled with all the food for the weekend and about 4 cases of beer, more Smirnoff Ice, and bottles of Beam and Sky.  We hit the highway and make it within about 5 miles of Woodrow Wilson Bridge before traffic's got us at a standstill. We, of course, are in the fast lane. Char and Jethro are right behind us. Traffic's inching along, slowly. I lean over to B, who's riding with me, and say, "You know, it would be a great time to smoke." Normally we're not allowed to smoke in the Murano, but the stopped traffic affords windows rolled down and arms with cigarettes hanging outside. B smiles. But, unfortunately, she says there are no cigarettes in the car. I yell, "Get your friends on the horn and tell them to meet m at their driver's side window with smokes and fire, STAT!"  Breaker, breaker, 1-9.  Next time traffic slows, I've got it in Park and I'm headin' North rapidly on foot. The Tundra's driver's side window slides down and a pack of 100s and a lighter find their way into my mits as gracefully as if we were in a relay race exchaning batons, or undercover agents handing off microfilm in the night. Then I realize traffic is moving, so I "run" back to the Murano. Luckily, I had the presence of mind to leave the door open when I left, but my plan of "jumping" back into the driver's seat was a little shortsighted. Well, actually, I think it was more a problem with my vision than any plan ... As I lept into the Murano, I basically took out the pillar behind the driver's seat (you may call it a door jam) with the entire right side of my body and it threw me back out into the road. Laughing hysterically at this point, I manage to get into the car and throw it in drive as I'm closing the door. And a few feet later ... we're stopped. But at least we have cigarettes!  So, we're smoking, we're rocking out to recently rediscovered PUSA ("You, Lynard Skynard hat, me, Little Kitty"), devilhands out the sunroof, screaming at the top of our lungs, "SHE'S LUMP, SHE'S LUMP!!!" Then B finds her own cigarettes in her bag. "But we STILL needed a lighter!!!"  Moving on ...  We're now about 45 minutes or so from the park when B finds something else in the car, this time in the glovebox -- a gift to me from our gay friends, who we'll call Noodle and Teve. It's a "hermetically sealed" sardine can labeled, "Survival Kit." Huh, B ejaculates, then reads the packaging. First up, the ingredients.  Sewing Kit Antibiotic Ointment Bandaids Razor Blade Matches ...  You get the idea. Then we come to something we weren't expecting.  Energy Nugget  As we try to figure out what the hell an Energy Nugget could be, exactly, B discover's the "uses" for the sardine can.  No, silly. It's not just a clever marketing gimmick or a sturdy container in which to keep your survival ingredients safely secured. You apparently can also use the can ...  To boil water. As a shovel. As a spoon, hopefully AFTER you've used it as a shovel AND boiled water in it. (The list goes on ... and then,) As a mirror, to be used as a "signaling device."  All of a sudden, it dawns on us what the Energy Nugget is. Let's recap. We've got a razor blade, matches, mirror, spoon, and an Energy Nugget.  Um. Hello. It's crack. Which, well, cracks us up. Then B says, "Dood, what was the marketing brainstorming session like for this product?!? 'Hey, how many things can we come up with for the sardine can?!?'" So, now out of control laughing, we start coming up with our own uses that the marketing team either wasn't forward thinking enough to realize or didn't have room for on the label.  The coup de grace? I say, "You can give BIRTH in it ...You can SHIT in it." This sends B over the edge. She starts screaming, "Stop, STOP! I have to pee, I HAVE TO PEE!" In the interest of sparing the leather seats, I blow by the nice new Amoco station and pull over at the NEXT gas station we come to. You're thinking Sheetz, 7/11, Exxon? Well, think Cooter & Friends.  B jumps out of the truck and shimmies cross-legged over to the front door of this joint, where's she's greeted with a sign that reads:  NO PUBLIC RESTROOMS  Although, it was most likely spelled "No Puhblick Rehstrums."  "HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA!!!"  Sucking it up, literaly, B heads back to the car, but stops along the way to check out a parking lot "vendor" selling corn. This guy's about 70 years old, missing teeth, wearing bluejean overalls. He may have had his sister/wife in the 1970 baby blue Ford pickup truck that was doubling as his store front, I don't recall. Anyway, he tries to sell B some corn by sharing with her what is apparently his company slogan, "Ain't Got No Worms." She hems and haws, so he sweetens the deal by throwing in a canteloupe. Hook, line, sinker. We're heading out of there with one EXTREMELY RIPE canteloupe, a sack full of his best worm-free corn, and one bladder full of urine.  After a successful piss stop, we get to the campsite and begin to setup. Now, picture if you will ... Four idiots desperately in need of alcohol by this point, trying to setup camp with a quickness because it's supposed to POUR down rain all weekend, and it's about 1,000 degrees out. Sweat literally running off us ... Christ, my KNEES were sweating. My EYEBALLS were sweating!  After a GREAT Char and Jethro "YOU'RE NOT DOING IT RIGHT! YES I F*CKING AM, YOU PRICK!"-style fight (which reminds me of camping with Husband, who got relegated to staying home with our 3 dogs this trip), we finally get our tents up, strategically place the orange cones, and crack a few cold ones. Next, the gazebo. (That's pronounced GAYS-bo, for your information.) This thing's f-ing HUGE! It's bigger than our two, six-people tents combined, for crying out loud.  As that thing's going up, Char makes a critical discovery and starts making the rounds to brief the rest of us on the situation. "Hey, I think that's poison ivy," she almost whispers, pointing to EVERYTHING surrounding our tents and the campsite, in general. The poison ivy discussion carries on for another 2 hours or so ...  "Don't step there!"  "There's poison ivy!"  (swat ... SWAT ... "Honey, what are those!?!" "Deer flies.")  "Be careful -- IVY!"  "I-V-Y!!!"  "Do you know Mike Ovachio?"  In the meantime, I go to take a gulp of my beer and get a mouthfull of deet. Nice, B. "Hey, Einstein -- aim AWAY from the open containers!" Then Char says something about, "This was the first time you've smoked in your car, eh?" "I don't smoke," I said flatly. Chirp. Chirp. Blink. I think I may have been smoking a cigarette at the time ...  Anyway, darkness falls and so does the temperature -- by about 2 degrees. It's thundering and lighteninging like CRAZY and we're psyched about getting a good storm. We're READY! We've got rain gear. The tents are waterproof. The gaze-go's not, but at this point, we're thinking we're going to be too drunk to care if we get wet (and the water to wash off the sweat and deet is most welcome).  The sky starts to spit at us a little and B and I break into our Scott Weiland routine, "HERE COMES THE WAAAAAATER!!!" Then, about 10 minutes later, it's over. Now, we're sweaty, deety, and our clothes are annoyingly moist from the "rain." Perfect time to get our drink on -- and for Jethro to yank out his cock.  My new buddy, Jethro ... Who substitutes the words of every song that we listened to with lyrics about his balls. (Actually, he's quite good at it! Later in the weekend I ask him why every song has to be about his nuts and he says, "If I had a twat, I'd sing about that.") He also has an affinity, obviously, for displaying his junk. After several failed attempts at trying to get a campfire going that first night, he comes into the gaze-bo with Johnson AND his stepchildren hanging out through his fly. (Get used to it, B tells me. It makes several more appearances throughout the weekend. And late night, his junk dons glow sticks!)  Hoo boy.  So, we hunker down around the picnic table, play some card games. Drink. Read some magazines. Drink. Smoke some cigarettes. "I don't smoke." Drink. Sing some songs. Drink. Drink some drinks. Drink. "Do you know Mike Ovachio?" Then the canteloupe gets violated.  Apparently, Char and Jethro bring toy Army Men with them camping to "protect" their campites. It's just something they do ... like shoving you if you're bent over a cooler -- unless you call "SAFETY!" Well, a few of the army men, plus some cigarettes and a glowstick ended up IN the canteloupe, which is so ripe it's dentable with a finger. And Char (who's been insisting all night that someone stole her and everyone else's lighters and then finds one in her pocket, and who's tripping over pavement and running into poles at this point) is now talking to the loupe as if it's a person. "Do you know Mike Ovachio?"  So, we figure, the loupe needs a name. "We dub thee, LUMP!" Seemed fitting. That's basically what it was -- an oozing, rotten lump of loupe flesh.  Blah, blah, blah. It's time to go to bed, but B and I notice Lump is missing and accuse Jethro of lobbing Lump into our tent. He denies. We search the tent. Can't find Lump. Jethro's insisting it's in the garbage. We search the garbage. There's Lump.  "OH NO -- NOT LUMP!" we yell, as if he's kicked someone's best friend in the gutter. So Lump gets rescued -- only to meet a worse fate down the road, literally. B and I decide to perpetrate a stumble by fruiting. It's sort of like a drive by shooting, but without a car and with fruit ammo. We wander, Lump in hand, away from our campsite and down the road to surprise some unsuspecting neighbors. B's holding the flashlight and I'm yelling (for stealth), "HOLD IT STEADY!" Then, without warning, Lump gets launched. What happened next is anyone's guess. But I can tell you it involved a lot of giggling, shrieking (again, for stealth), and scurrying back to our campsite.   While we giggle in bed for the next hour ("Stop laughing ... NOW!"), B and I discuss how AWESOME our tent is. Then B says, "We don't need any f*cking beer holders!" (in reference to Jethro's earlier bragging about how their new tent has cup holders). I was like, "Dood, you just ragged on your friends' tent!" Giggle, giggle. You gotta watch B when she's drunk -- she'll turn on you AND your tent like THAT!  Morning. Imagine the sunlight breaking through the trees, us neslted in our tents, woodland animals rustling in the brush (and under our covers -- RACOON POOP! DUTCH OVEN!!!), and the serene sound of birds ...  CAW, CAW, CAW, CAW, CAW, CAW, CAW, CAW, CAW!!!  "WHAT the HELL is THAT?!?" Tent door ripping open. Jethro with a dracula-like reaction to sun, cursing, stumbling, "F*CKING BIRDS!"  Then it's our turn to emerge. B and I step out of our tent, in which we shared an air mattress after much speculation by Jethro, and I announce, "[B] wore me like a hat last night!" I think the birds stopped cawing at that point. We crack us up.  Breakfast. Clouds. Intermittent rain. We take a walk, past the scene of the crime (which looks like someone ralphed all over the road). "I'm NOT walking in there -- THERE ARE TICKS!" Come back to our campsite and begin drinking in earnest. Lunch. "Let's go to the lighthouse!" Drinking. More talk of leaving. No one moving. More drinking. Then, after several hours, an effort to go on an adventure. We drive to the lighthouse, which to our dismay is locked behind a fence. Disappointed! Then we drive to the beach crawling with children. No. I'd rather have sand fleas in my buttcrack. Then we drive to the dog beach, thinking it would be empty. But the tide is high ("I'M HOLDIN' ON") and hanging out there is out of the question. So we head back to the gaze-bo.  Still raining. Jethro says, "Hey, I think the sun is coming out." Laughs.  Dinner. More rain. More drinking. Peole getting very uninhibited now ... B delighting us by standing on a picnic table doing her best Weiland, Jagger, Axl, Slash and Tyler impersonations, screaming the lyrics to every song with us -- her backup screamers.  B's precisely DJing music to get us up to exactly 11 PM when Quiet Time is enforced by Park Narcs and Camp Cops. At approximately 10:59 and 59 seconds, the last blairing song ends and B, just like a rockstar -- spread eagle, devil hands waving -- screams out, "THANK YOU!!! GOOD NIGHT!!!"  After about 15 minutes of laughing hysterically, we realize that when we aren't talking, the rest of the ENTIRE camp ground is dead silent. So, basically, while we were singing and carrying on thinking everyone else was doing same, they were actually just lying in their tents, patiently watching the clock and hoping their children didn't have lasting emotional scars. Literally, you could hear crickets. I think I even heard a deer blink.  More laughing.  Jethro bailed early (after, of course, showing us his glow stick -- I think it was yellow that night, maybe green -- and again failing to get a campfire started). We drank on. I ended up getting a raging headache and was down next. So, now it's just B and Char up at this point, in the gaze-bo with the tunes on low, loudly discussing what kind of car Char should buy.  At about 11:22, I hear a scream and then laughing. I look out of the tent and see two uniformed Rangers standing outside the gaze-bo, eerily illuminated by our propane lanterns in the gaze-bo (which we also dubbed the Fish Bowl because at night with the lanterns on, you can see everything going on in there like you're watching a domed drive-in movie screen, from most likely miles away). Ponch and Whoever The Hell Ponch's Blonde Partner On Chips Was remind B and Char that it's Quiet Time and explain that everyone can hear EVERYTHING they're saying. B says, "Well then, what kind of car should she buy?" One guy laughed, then regained composure and told them the music has to be OFF -- not just turned down. B, ever the people pleaser, asks if they want a lemonade. Chirp. She also asked if they liked her shirt. Blink. I think they walked away at that point.  Morning. Breakfast. Message from a Ranger that my dog's sick. I spend an hour in the pouring down rain trying desperately to get ahold of Husband to find out what's going on. One of our dogs was old, had some tumors in his lungs, and wasn't expected to live much longer. Crying. Trying to make a collect call and getting blocked by Verizon at the pay phone. Trying to use the operator who's a TOTAL C*NT and won't take a credit card, even though there's a sticker on the front that says "Verizon" just above several credit card symbols. Put in my last $2.75 in change to make a call and get call intercepted at the house, denied, and lose my money. Now I'm in the car, broke, crying, driving north until I can get a cell signal. Finally get Husband and learn that my dog -- my baby -- is in intensive care at the vet and they want me to decide what to do. Does he "live" or die. I fly back to the campsite, mutter something about having to leave, dog dying, I'll be back, don't worry.  Four hours later I'm back at the campsite with a half bottle of silver Patron and my best brave face on ...  "Hey, let's go to the lighthouse!" Laughs. "Hey, I think the sun is coming out." We did manage to go to the pier for a bit. Laughed at some dykes and their horrible New England accents. Admired some sailboats. Checked out some cool birds in a nest clinging to dear life in the wind. Then we hit the beach. No one else there. Actually did some swimming, until some fat bitch comes by with her dorky kid and says, "How are the nettles?!?" Trying to avoid a panic ('cause we're all in the water), I yell out at her, "They're around, but we haven't seen any here." She, with infinite wisdom, yells back, "Huh. They were as THICK AS THIEVES IN ST. MARY'S!" Ten seconds later, B swears she just had something gelatinous graze her foot. Fun's over. We sleep on the beach for a while. Char takes a walk. I throw a can at Jethro's nuts. He goes to the bathroom and we pretend to leave. Good times.  Dinner. Drinks. Crying. Consoling. Jethro trying AGAIN to get a campfire going. Char's even into it now, making excuses about how the logs are specially treated to NOT burn. Finally, I'm like -- enough! Step aside and let Alaska girl do this right. After about 45 minutes of careful and strategic log and paper placement and some precision blowing, 3 days into our camping trip we've got a rager. Hurray for The One On The Right. I rock.  Then, the smell of lighter fluid is wafting at us from a neighboring campsite. And FwuhBam! Overt your eyes! A HUGE explosion in their firepit. Then, a loud "Awwwww" as their fire dies down 5 seconds later. This goes on for another 2 hours. Basically, they've got some wet wood and a jug of lighter fluid and apparently are hoping for a miracle (while we're hoping for common sense). BLAZE! Awwwww. BLAZE! Awwwww. BLAZE? Awwwwww.  Then it starts to pour down rain.  BLAZE. Awwww. BLAZE. AWWWW!  Meanwhile, our fire is still RAGING -- even in the rain. We're laughing about bringing them a lit log while we are CHOKING on their fumes.   It's time. I go grab the bottle of Patron.  We're sitting in a circle next to our campfire in the pouring rain, stripped down to our underwear, passing around a shaker of salt, the bottle of Patron, and a cup full of limes. The only relief you got from the shot you just did was while waiting for it to quickly pass through the hands of the next three people before it was your turn again. In 10 minutes, that bottle was dry. Then, we started on vodka shots (with lemons shaked and baked in a sandwhich bag of sugar). Beer at this point was dangerously low.  There's a lot of dancing, SCREAMING the words to all our favorite songs, and the music's on full blast ("COMIN' AT YOU LIVE!!!"). It's WELL after Quiet Time, but we figured it was our last night, there was a death that day, and we were going out with a bang. Plus, it's raining so hard that the CHIPS twins were NOT coming out. And our neighbors, after witnessing the drunken heathen rain dance going on, were probably too scared to ask us to keep it down.  Suddenly, and I mean out of no where, B announces she's going to bed. Char didn't let the words fully get out of B's mouth before she was like, "Me, too!" Nighty, night. That left me and Jethro in the rain, soaking wet, stumbling drunk, trying to dance and keep each other upright. It also left no one capable of defending me against the prowler who later tried to steal my bra.  The next thing I remember I was waking up in the poison ivy, hucking my guts out and Jethro saying, "Are you OK?" In my mind, I'm wailing, 'Go on without me! Save yourself!' I think he helped me up and into our tent. I laid down next to B, the tent started to spin, and I sat bolt upright and flailed toward the door. I must have pawed around for the zipper in the CORNER of the tent for 15 minutes before yelling, "LET ME OUT! LET ME OUT!!!" Then I laughd at myself  when I realized that the zipper is in the center of the tent. (It must have looked like our tent was trying to give birth.) Jethro set me free, then went to bed. I grabbed a chair, sat it in the middle of our site, sat down, put my head in between my knees and braced for impact.  Hyuck. Cough. Sputter. Back to the tent.  Morning.  I have to piss like a race horse. Get up, stumble out of the tent sideways, walk around back in barefeet and squat in the poison ivy. Wet wipe. Garbage. Back to bed. On my way, I notice a pile of vomit right outside our tent. I'm like, "Hey, [B] -- there's puke outside our tent" hoping she'd fess up and I'd be off the hook. She yells back, "Is there corn in it?" Yes. "Oh, it's mine" she says (being the only one who had corn the night before.) I shrug and get back in the tent.  Woah. Crawling back into bed, I feel a thick layer of rocks on the air mattress -- all over. I mean, ROCKS. They're stuck in my skin from just laying down. As I'm picking them out of my skin and wiping them off my side of the bed, I ask, "Dood, how did all the GRAVEL get in our bed?" B feels around, giggles, then plucks a rock out of her navel. Both of us ponder this phenomenon.   B starts recalling herself on all fours scampering out of the tent last night -- while Jethro and I were still up and at it -- saying to herself, "Not in the tent. NOT in the tent!" Hurl. Then she crawled back into bed. The only thing we could deduce was that she basically navel dragged (similar to knuckle dragging, but less vertical ... ) her way to puke and back and didn't bother to brush the rocks off her elbows, knees, shins, face, gut. We both chuckle, then go back to sleep -- in the gravel. Tells you how great we were feeling that a.m.  A few minutes later, Char crawls out of their tent all bright eyed and bushy tailed, laughing at two things ...  1. She found her husband Jethro naked, in the fetal position next to their tent door -- on the inside -- laying in a puddle of "water." "Did he piss himself?" we ask, fighting back the urge to lose it. "No, I don't think so," Char says, as if she's convincing herself.   Hmmm.  And 2., somehow, on the outside of their tent are MY sandals and somehow, on the outside of OUR tent are Jethro's sandals. And none of us know how THAT happened. (Nor can I figure out now why I'm wearing B's shirt.)  Double hmmmmm.  That morning was rough. It took B and I like 2 hours to dismantle the tent in between breaks which consisted of sitting down and moaning, "Uuuuuuugggghhhhh." Then Char announces, "Hey, you know ... I don't think that was poison ivy after all."  PHEW!  Once we were all packed up, Char decided to drive the Tundra 'cause Jethro was green. We all quickly hugged and said good bye. Char and Jethro headed off on their 11 hour journey back to New York. B and I hopped in the Murano and headed for the nearest Sheetz.  Along the way, all I could think of was, 'How the hell am I going to drive all the way back home." I was sweating. Shaking. Uuuuggghhhing. When we got to Sheetz to get gas, we both jumped out on a mission. Me, gas. B, food. She came around the back of the truck and asked me what I wanted. I grabbed her with both arms by the shoulders, got about an inch away from her face and with the utmost seriousness, as if her life depended on it, said ...  "I'm going to need you to go in there and get me something with as much cheese as you possibly can." She understood perfectly.  As we're waiting for our food order, we're doing a little light shopping ("Do they have carts?"). We've now got cookies, Ding-Dongs, chips, Dots, Gatorade, Slim Jims, Milky Way Bites, and an assortment of other crap IN ADDITION TO the two roast beef "pretzels" (one with extra cheese god damn it), cheese fries, and nachos we've ordered -- for the two of us. Forty-five minutes later, after we've finally checked out, found where I parked the car, and are now stuffing our faces in the Murano, a black lady we saw in the store earlier strolls up to B's window in her Sunday best.  "I have something I want to give you," she says and hands us a leaflet. "God bless." B says "Thanks," and grabs it from her as she puts up the window. B looks at me, looks at the leaflet and then we both laugh at the fact that this woman -- out of the 20 people she just saw in Sheetz over the past half hour -- decided to give US and us alone a little friendly info on salvation (dogs and cats living together). Alls I'm saying is Preachy McThinkswearedrunklesbians is lucky she strolled up to B's side of the car ...  Full and feeling slightly better, we hit the road again and eventually make it home without further incident. Char and Jethro weren't as fortunate. They had to pull over before they even hit the Sheetz. Jethro's complexion went from green to chunky, all over the inside of their truck. I bet that was nice for the next 11 hours ...  Sidenote, it took 2 full weeks to the day to unload the Murano. And even then, I made Husband do it. I guess I just didn't want the good times to end. Can't wait for Part Deaux.

      B gets a phone call from a bartender we thought we'd never A. hear from or 2. see again. To backtrack, the last time we saw him, there was an off-the-cuff comment made by B about negotiating the bar tab with sexual favors, which resulted in glowering disapproval and the tab being literally tossed in our faces. (And I thought the universal sign for "Check please" was the CUSTOMER making a checkmark motion in the air ... I was wrong. Apparently, it's getting the tab thrown at you by the bartender.)  Anyway, this guy left a message that claimed he thought WE were mad at HIM and wouldn't we want to get over it and come in and visit him ... Interesting. Whatever. (Um, we were the ones laughing hysterically. You were the one acting like someone's dad.) So, we decide to give it one more try for a couple reasons. First, we're running out of bars in the area that we can still go to that we haven't "compromised." And III, this guy majorly hooks us up with free drinks. And, after spending 4 years at Smith's never getting a free drink and always getting overcharged for shit we don't order, girls gotta do what girls gotta do.  So, we roll in there. It's crowded. It's noisy. I'm tired. Not in a good mood. Headache. Whatever. And both B and I are trying to assess what the status is exactly with this guy. Are we in like Flint, or out like ... um, gout? Ir-regardless, we're trying to make the best of it, but there's no where to sit.  I happen to spy a lone barstool and we make our way over to it in the process of ordering a drink. The only problem is, some bitch has her purse on it and, despite our looking needy, continues to talk to her friends as if her using the barstool for a handbag was perfectly acceptable.  Needless to say ... I lean over and shout, "Is anyone using this stool?" To which I get a nasty look as if to say, 'Can't you see my purse is on it?!?' So, I (laugh and) say, "I mean, is anyone SITTING here." Reluctantly, bitch grabs her bag and in her bitchiest bitch voice says, "I don't THINK so." Great. Thanks for playing along. And by the way, screw you.  So, trying to get as far away from that mess as possible, I pickup the chair, grab B and head toward the opposite end of the bar. We squeeze in the best we can with our stool, but since there wasn't really room to sit and we were sort of in the middle of the aisle, we decide it would be more appropriate if WE used the stool for OUR purses. Oh the irony ...  A few minutes later, one or two people leave and we make our move for their stools at the bar. As we're headed that way, a random couple runs up behind us with hopes of same. Denied. So they decide to stand behind us. Next thing I know, B is distraught and mutters, "I have a problem." But she won't say what it is. This goes on for about another hour with her obviously uneasy about something.  Meanwhile, this couple is like right on top of me and the girl is elbowing me in the ribs every 2 minutes. I keep trying to move over, and over, and over until basically B is wearing me like a hat. Finally, another couple of stools open up so I'm like, "Scoot down!" and we move over a stool or two. Then this girl decides she's going to sit down on the stool next to me and the whole jab fest starts all over again.  Now, by this point, normally I would've whipped around and gut stabbed her with a straw or a tampon, lemon wedge -- something. But I could sense that the source of B's "problem" was somehow connected to this couple standing behind us (probably because she kept looking over her shoulder and breathing 'Not now' every time I asked her what was up) and figured it was best to keep my mouth shut until I knew the details.  Unfortunately, Jabby McWhorebag wouldn't let up. So I decide to stand up off my stool to get a little farther away from her. Next thing I know, she's grabbing my stool from behind me, pulling it over in front of her, and PUTTING HER PURSE ON IT.  That's it.  I spin, grab the stool in her hands, and shriek, "Um -- HI!" She says, "Oh, I'm sorry -- was I jabbing you?" Excuse me. What the F*CK did she just say?!? Nostrils flaring. Veins bulging. With great restraint I say. "Actually, I had plans to use my stool, again -- still." Blink. Blink. Chirp. Then the guy she's with passes me one of the THREE now vacant stools that are positioned between the two of them, which apparently weren't suitable for her purse but are suitable for my ass. Sigh.  So, with my new new new NEW stool, I turn back around and I realize that B is basically "Doot do doo"-ing, trying to remain inconspicuous and uninvolved. This is when I realize what's going on. It dawns on me that this guy, the guy with Bitch No. 2, is a guy B knows well -- I suspect he's the reason we said we could never go to Friday's again. Apparently I'm right. Long story. B can comment if she wishes, although I suspect this one isn't blog material. Ha.  Best line of the night? I knowingly lean over to B and say, "If it's any consolation ... " when she interrupts and says, "NOTHING you can say will be a consolation." Then I say, "Well, he's hot." (Major understatement. Props B!) Which, judging by the look on B's face DID evoke a moment of pause, but was NOT consoling and perhaps the LAST thing she wanted or was prepared to hear. Sigh.  I mean, of all the nights and all the stupid things we've seen, done and/or been a part of lately, what are the chances that we'd run into THIS guy and he'd be there with someone who apparently has the same stool etiquette as the biotch STILL sitting at the OTHER end of the bar, STILL wondering where she's supposed to put her purse.  The good news is that our bartender friend hadn't forgotten HIS manners and plied us with free alcohol all night. Our tab was the low, low price of $5.25. We had $25.25 on us. He got a $20 tip. Then we quietly exited stage right.  Memories ...  Circa 2002:   "Hey," random says with my barstool already in his hand, "do you mind if I take your stool?" To which I respond,   "Stool SAMPLE?!?" With a look of horror, my stool promptly gets replaced without a word.  What is it with me and stools?!? Not to mention all the "stool" B and I left at Smith's ... Maybe that's why we never got any free drinks there.

      OK ... Couldn't help it. There were some new blog templates available and I had to reconsider ours. B, if you hate it -- let me know! Was just having some fun. Plus, looks like we have some cool editing/composing features with this new template ...

      Here's some fun facts I've found on the web: It's the poison ivy oil that causes the rash - 90% of the population is allergic, thus the rash. The oil stays active on surfaces for five years. For first time sufferer, it can take up to ten days to present as a rash. Also, the leaves change color with the seasons - never knew that.  Now, for the gross stuff - I can't figure out how to get a link to work - so, try typing in the http://, then poisonivy.aesir.com, slash view, slash rashes, dot html.  Baking soda, oatmeal, the inside of a banana peel, and cool whip are all listed as home remedies for stopping the itch and drying out the oil. Hmmph.  Let's be careful out there!

      There's even a feature, called AudioBlogger, that lets you call Blogger from any phone and leave a message that is immediately posted to your site as an MP3 audio file. (It's fun at parties.)  THIS is where our blog gets us either fired, evicted, divorced, disowned, or, quite possibly, even killed.

      Update Numero Uno:  The snapped ankle is, lucky for us, not snapped. Merely bruised sprained, and leaving our pal in a Vicodin-induced state of bliss, on sick leave through the weekend.  Update Numero Two:  The One on the Right now has admin rights. I no longer take responsibilty for what goes on up in here. Cool points out the window...

      So, at this point, I feel compelled to backtrack a bit and explain the One On The Left, One On The Right story. It all began about a month ago ...  The two of us decided to do a "movie night" at Plan B's house (wow, another name and funny story that I guess needs to be explained at some point!). I was in charge of picking up the movies. A more difficult task than you might think since me and Husband watch a lot of movies ... What the hell do I get that Plan B will like and I haven't seen yet? Keep in mind it can't be a horror flick 'cause B don't do horror.   Anyway, decided to compromise and got Monster with Charlize Theron (which I hadn't seen and hoped B would watch) and Badder Santa with Billy Bob (which I knew B hadn't seen and even though I had, it's worth watching again!).  Before we get too tangled up in Monster, the impetus for this post, I have to share our favorite scene from Badder Santa. Bernie Mac, Billy Bob and that damn midget are on the Santa "stage" at the store in AZ. Billy Bob's character is basically passed out in the poison ivy, so to speak (reference to another good story!), and Bernie tells the midget (small person, vertically challeneged, whatever) to bring Billy Bob to the car. After explaining that he's only like 4-foot-something, the midget screams that if Bernie's got a plan on how HE can carry Bill Bob out to the car by himself then he should, "SKETCH IT UP, M*THERF*CKER!!!"  On a roll ... ANOTHER great scene and a favorite?!? The scene where Billy Bob and the midget try to teach The Kid to fight. 'Nuff said.  OK, back to Monster.  I had no idea what this movie was about other than I knew it was a true story, Charlize apparently did an amazing job, and it was about a female serial killer. Oh yeah, and the pimply guy at Blockbuster told me Charlize is hot, but not in this movie. (crickets chirping) So, about 10 minutes into the movie, when Charlize's straight character meets straight Wednesday Adams in that gay bar and they proceed to get plowed and order up shot "Lucky Number 10," I yell out to Plan B -- "YOU'RE THE ONE ON THE LEFT, YOU'RE THE ONE ON THE LEFT!!!" B shrieks, "YOU'RE THE ONE ON THE RIGHT!"  And no -- we're not gay. I'm married -- "TO A MAN!!!" ... Unless you ask hispanic-sideways-baseball-hat who hit on us at Friday's, who thought we went to a "Geraldo Rivera" concert and then promptly got the "We're gay" maneuver. (Hello?!? VELVET REVOLVER, jackass.)  Anyway, back to the movie. This banter carries on for another few minutes as we watched them spill drinks and ricochet off a few walls, etc., up until about the point where I realize they really are gay. Then I'm like, "Ooooooh. You're both, YOU'RE BOTH!!!"  And no we're not homophobes. One of our best friends is a gay guy ("It's a sad day when a white girl's gotta ask a gay dude to be a bridesmaid!"). It's just hard to imagine me making out with B like they did behind the bar in this movie ... Left me feeling dirty, like my soul needed a douche. Although, again -- depends on who you ask. We convinced a couple of guys on an unoffical trifecta bar crawl the other night through DC that her and I went at it with another chic's husband, in the rain, on a picnic table while we were camping. Men. Ah, ANOTHER couple of good stories ...  Favorite scene? When Charlize is preppring for her next date with Wednesday in the restroom of a gas station (or whatever it was) and she's feathering her hair into those god awful feather "rolls", then does the infamous "hair toss" and says in her most manly voice, "You look goooood." We get a lot of mileage out of these types of things.

      SO - Last night was the Barenaked Ladies and Alanis Morissette concert at the amphitheater on the hill. And  someone  in our crowd, who shall rename mainless, had a problem with his ability to stay vertical. Snap, crackle, pop, tumble tumble tumble. 235 pounds taking out a row of three people after snapping an ankle. Or maybe just spraining it. But seriously, it's the size of a grapefruit, and the IT Department is short-staffed today.  If only he had listened to us, and stayed on the blanket, preferably horizontally, then none of this would have happened. Highlights of the conversation include"Who has some money?" and "Dude. Is it over? I didn't even  hear  the Barenaked Ladies. I was too trashed." "Yo dood - it's  intermission . BNL hasn't even PLAYED yet."  Sprecken zie which, we owe JB about $28 bucks. Love how he comes to visit our blanket during intermission, and we beat and rob him like a schoolyard pansy. It's just wrong how much we crack me up.  Props to the driver (designated, but just a swervy as the rest of us) for getting us back in one piece. And now, for your listening pleasure:   Afternoon Delight   Starland Vocal Band     Gonna find my baby, gonna hold her tight Gonna grab some afternoon delight My motto's always been; when it's right, it's right Why wait until the middle of a cold dark night When everything's a little clearer in the light of day And we know the night is always gonna be there any way Thinkin' of you's workin' up my appetite Looking forward to a little afternoon delight Rubbin' sticks and stones together makes the sparks ignite and the thought of rubbin' you is getting so exciting Sky rockets in flight Afternoon delight  Started out this morning feeling so polite I always thought a fish could not be caught who wouldn't bite But you've got some bait a waitin' and I think I might like having a little afternoon delight Sky rockets in flight Afternoon delight  Please' be waiting for me baby when I come around We could make a lot of lovin' 'for the sun goes down Thinkin' of you's workin' up an appetite Looking forward to a little afternoon delight Rubbin' sticks and stones together makes the sparks ignite And the thought of rubbin' you is getting so exciting Sky rockets in flight Afternoon delight
