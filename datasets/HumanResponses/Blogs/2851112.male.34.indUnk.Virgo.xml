      My map is almost the same, except I've also been to Oregon, Washington and Idaho. Too bad they dont have a Mars map. When I was there last week I found a funny little guy rolling around.When I addressed him, he gave me the snub, so I gave him a swift kick. I guess he's famous around here, I saw him on TV the other day. But that holier-than-thou celebrity attitude doesn't go over so well on Mars.

      This is kinda cool:  A Web site that lets you map what states and countries you've visited. I wish it let you draw a line to indicate your actual movements. I guess I could do that myself ...      urlLink create your own visited states map       urlLink create your own visited country map

      i was recruited earlier this week to be invloved in selecting a new coffee provider for our office.  while i'm sure my input will amount to a hill of beans (or maybe not...) i was excited to get some free coffee out of it.  let's just hope it's worth more than i paid for it.

      I like coffee......especially very good coffee, but every day I drink the most funky office coffee pot swill ever. And not just one cup….but two. If this coffee was created at home, I would be upset and start a new pot, but in an office environment it somehow seems acceptable. Supwidat?

If you can share any information, please contact Nancy Ruggeri, UW-Madison, at nruggeri@wiscmail.wisc.edu.  Can anyone help this poor woman?

      OK, so i read the dream that buster was describing the other day. And even though such a narrative can oftentimes reflect George Carlin's philosophy  that nothing is more boring than listening to someone else describe their dreams to you,   i was actually entertained and even inspired by the dream to create a funny, but admittedly poor photoshop image that would supplement the dream and the obvious effect it had on poor Buster. But alas, the problem quickly reared it's head that Blogger does not host images, or at least the free Blogger does not. And even though i have like a kabillion megs of storage in my Yahoo briefcase, they will not let just anyone access that server without logging in with a yahoo ID, blah blah blah. So linking the hilarious image is not a viable, or at least painless, option. My question is, how can we post funny ass photoshopped images, or any images outside of HTML coded shiz? Can we post pics directly on this site? Or is there an available server? I'm dyin' here!

      I had one of those crazy dreams last night. It was long and epic. The kind you sit back and watch even though you are the main character. Here’s the basic plotline:  I’m walking through an arid land when suddenly gun shots whiz by from both directions, there are guys hunched down behind hills shooting at each other, and they both think I’m on the other side. I spotted a dead guy and I reached down and picked up his machine gun and started running and shooting. I ended up in some trees, and I was running madly. Next thing I know, I’m captured and taken to a classic interrogation room with a bare light bulb on the ceiling. The interrogators are yelling and screaming at me, but I don’t know what the hell they’re talking about. I finally go berserk and beat the crap out of everyone. I leave with the machine gun and I’m walking through an unfamiliar urban area, and a dude walks up and starts giving me crap about carrying a machine gun, then he whips out a pistol and threatens me, so I killed him. I suddenly realized how obviously armed I was in the busy city, so I started running as fast as I could. I finally got to a weird swampy place and went into a shack. I turned on the TV and there was a news bulletin about me. “This man killed a bunch of guys, then beat up a bunch of guys, then killed another guy……stay vigilant…consider him armed and dangerous". So I went outside and buried the machine gun and took off. Then I was standing in a backyard with a big bamboo gazebo, where I called and made an appointment to get a haircut. Then I watched the police come calmly to get me as I felt a sense of peace knowing that I was gonna get a haircut before I went to prison.  This dream lasted hours in dream time, there was a bunch of other crazy stuff I cant remember, eating on a patio of a chinese restaurant, a fellow fugitive, an orange.....  weird  Got Dreams?

      The bosses went to some sort of “off-site” meeting of questionable validity today, and as they say, when the cats away, the mice will play. I was pelted with dozens of rubberbands in a matter of moments, which was very fun, but led to the opening up of a serious can of woop-ass……You see, I can hit a man running full speed in the ear hole with a rubberband given the opportunity, and I didn’t hesitate to do just that. The carnage was gruesome…… stretched and disfigured rubber bands lay limp and helpless one on top of the other. Bald heads and unshaven cheeks whelped up with the rosy glow of elastic impacts. After the battle, the sullen and bruised survivors paced the office……searching for the limp loops that littered the battlefield…….before the bosses returned.

      i'll try to keep the politcal jabber to a minimum. but i thought this  urlLink op/ed  from today's ny times was funny, if for no other reason than because it's written by the real life george castanza.   My War By LARRY DAVID   I couldn't be happier that President Bush has stood up for having served in the National Guard, because I can finally put an end to all those who questioned my motives for enlisting in the Army Reserve at the height of the Vietnam War. I can't tell you how many people thought I had signed up just to avoid going to Vietnam. Nothing could be further from the truth. If anything, I was itching to go over there. I was just out of college and, let's face it, you can't buy that kind of adventure. More important, I wanted to do my part in saving that tiny country from the scourge of Communism. We had to draw the line somewhere, and if not me, then who?  But I also knew that our country was being torn asunder by opposition to the war. Who would be here to defend the homeland against civil unrest? Or what if some national emergency should arise? We needed well-trained men on the ready to deal with any situation. It began to dawn on me that perhaps my country needed me more at home than overseas. Sure, being a reservist wasn't as glamorous, but I was the one who had to look at myself in the mirror.   Even though the National Guard and Army Reserve see combat today, it rankles me that people assume it was some kind of waltz in the park back then. If only. Once a month, for an entire weekend — I'm talking eight hours Saturday and Sunday — we would meet in a dank, cold airplane hangar. The temperature in that hangar would sometimes get down to 40 degrees, and very often I had to put on long underwear, which was so restrictive I suffered from an acute vascular disorder for days afterward. Our captain was a strict disciplinarian who wouldn't think twice about not letting us wear sneakers or breaking up a poker game if he was in ill humor. Once, they took us into the woods and dropped us off with nothing but compasses and our wits. One wrong move and I could've wound up on Queens Boulevard. Fortunately, I had the presence of mind to find my way out of there and back to the hangar. Some of my buddies did not fare as well and had to call their parents to come and get them.  Then in the summer we would go away to camp for two weeks. It felt more like three. I wondered if I'd ever see my parakeet again. We slept on cots and ate in the International House of Pancakes. I learned the first night that IHOP's not the place to order fish. When the two weeks were up, I came home a changed man. I would often burst into tears for no apparent reason and suffered recurring nightmares about drowning in blueberry syrup. If I hadn't been so strapped for cash, I would've sought the aid of a psychiatrist.   In those days, reserve duty lasted for six years, which, I might add, was three times as long as service in the regular army, although to be perfectly honest, I was unable to fulfill my entire obligation because I was taking acting classes and they said I could skip my last year. I'll always be eternally grateful to the Pentagon for allowing me to pursue my dreams.   Still, after all this time, whenever I've mentioned my service in the Reserve during Vietnam, it's been met with sneers and derision. But now, thanks to President Bush, I can stand up proudly alongside him and all the other guys who guarded the home front. Finally, we no longer have to be embarrassed about our contribution during those very trying years.

      POSTED: 9:30 a.m. EST February 12, 2004  SYDNEY, Australia -- A man attacked by a shark while snorkeling had to swim back to shore, walk to his car, and then drive to a surf club for help -- with the shark still attached to his leg.   Lifeguards at a beach north of Sydney, were stunned when the man walked in with the two-foot carpet shark biting his leg, and refusing to let go.   He said, "I just realized I had to swim in like that, hanging on to it."    Once he reached the shore, people tried to help him but couldn't remove the shark. Lifeguards flushed its gills with fresh water, forcing it to loosen its grip. The man had 70 needle-like punctures.    The shark later died.  Copyright 2004 by The Associated Press.

      Once again, I woke up this morning expecting a winter wonderland………but got nothing.  I didn’t even have to scrape the windshield….. We’ve had snow a few times, but never enough to make a snowman or an igloo, just enough to make mud when it melts. To make matters worse, the veteran weather guys around here all quit this year, and the new guys are competing to see who can freak out the “hometown viewers” with pending weather catastrophes. They’re really pissing me off. I’m ready for spring now. You Yankees got snow?

      the last thing i remember was shaving. the mirror looked as it did on most other occasions save for a slight shimmer and a wobble not unlike a skin on some sort of metallic pudding. well, the cuervo gold and the fine colombian having made the night a not so wonderful thing, pretty much stood out in my mind as the best possible explanation for the misbehavior of the usually solid looking glass. yep, on most occasions, i can count on good old facts and physics to stay, well...factual and physical. the next thing you know, i slip on a bit of wet linoleum coming out of the shower...zip....zoosh....and then i am flying through this void like a big naked helpless dummy, still kind of stoned, so i don't fight it much. until....thud....ouch that hurt. voids are supposed to be void of tops, sides, and most importantly, bottoms. two worlds collide, my bottom and the void's slammed into one another, neither offering an apology. well, not much happened between then and now. walked towards the light, yada yada, heard voices, yada yada, zigged and zagged to avoid the swirling masses of nether spirits, yada yada yada, even played a game of hide in the dark from an obviously angered griffin.  then, appearing out of no where, (or actually i should clarify it was me who was appearing out of nowhere) i caught sight of a char-bucks internet cafe. i walked in, signed up for a computer, checked my email, got a second invitation for this blog, signed up to participate in this obviously pre-mensa forum, and viola, here i am. now someone please get me the goddamn out of here!

      A little girl goes to the barber shop with her father.  She stands next to the barber chair, while her dad gets his hair cut, eating a snack cake.  The barber says to her, "Sweetheart, you're gonna get hair on your Twinkie."   She says, "Yes, I know, and I'm gonna get boobs too."

      This experiment is presently failing miserably, so I have invited more doods to contribute and partake of the pan-galactic gargle blog. They are a trumpet player, a stuff figure outer, a rock draw-er, and a place seller. So lift yo stinky hands and slap'em all five. Gost and Newburg: feel free to invite more, I dont think there's a limit.

      Fluid replacement is vital to the well-being of all organic life. However, some beings take fluid replacement to health-threatening extremes, with the enthusiastic imbibing of Pan Galactic Gargle Blasters.   A cocktail invented by Zaphod Beeblebrox, its ingredients include Ol' Janx Spirit, Santraginean sea water, Arcturan Mega-gin, Fallian marsh gas, Qualactin Hypermint extract, the tooth of an Algolian Suntiger, Zamphuor and an olive. It should be drunk with extreme care.   Ol' Janx Spirit is a particularly vicious alchololic drink. Wiping the neck of a bottle with a towel is more likely to kill any bacteria on the towel than on the bottle.   It is an interesting fact that almost every culture invents a drink called a jynnan tonnyx, or something that sounds identical.   Some beings reject alcohol, and instead drink tea. No-one is quite sure why.    urlLink excerpt from the guide to the hitchikers guide to the galaxy

      That is a creepy-ass Grover.  Bored by the pop mediocrity of the halftime show, I averted my eyes and started yammering. In the middle of my exuberant diatribe, I witnessed, in slow motion, the jaws of my guests drop as they lifted their arms with forefingers extended. Unbeknownst to me, they were pointing to the boob of Janet Jackson. The next few minutes were dominated by vigorous debates about the boob, the unveiling of the boob, the glistening shimmer that adorned the boob, etc. I, however, was unable to participate in the debates, having witnessed only the reactions to the boob, and not the boob itself.   I had hoped the panthers would win the game, too bad they kept going for the 2-point conversions.

      so i was pickling turnips with mao tse tung using cider vinegar and garlic, when all of a sudden a case of beer falls off a passing freight train. kneedeep in turnip greens, without any recipes to cure my onsetting athlete's foot and halitosis, i thought about hair removal, or better yet, hair replacement procedures. the beatles on dvd would have nothing on this house party. especially with ice cube and dr. dre in the hiz-ouse. of course, black flag will be a problem, what with their gate crashing and monday night football parties. anyway, hopefully that will be enough fodder for the banner ads to react for several months. go banner go!

      Saturday was a beautiful day for lumber jacktivities. I pulled out my neglected chainsaw and gave it the once over. I sharpened the blade, adjusted the chain, filled it up with fresh clean oil, gassed it up, and headed to the back forty. I was giddy. There’s nothing quite like hearing the wood start to crack when the chainsaw has finished its job, and looking up to watch the dead tree top scrape the blue sky as it agrees to give up its piece of heaven and join its ancestors below with a final thud. It makes my heart pound….. partially from the physical exertion involved, but something else too… the anticipation, the fear that something’s gonna go wrong,  the finality…..   One of the trees was completely choked with poison ivy. The vines were as thick as my wrist at the base of the tree. The top of the tree fell off in an ice storm last winter, but there was about 15 feet left. Last summer it was a 15 foot high monument to the Goddess of Oozing Rashes…clad in evil leaves grouped in threes. I was careful, I had gloves, long sleeves, and safety glasses on. I cut through the Ivy with the top of the blade so that the sawdust would shoot away from me. I successfully reduced the tree to a 2 foot stump, then I piled wood around the base of the stump and set it on fire. I kept it burning all day to eliminate the stump. I knew better than to get in the smoke.   It got hot. I took off my flannel shirt. I cut down more dead trees and ended up with saw dust on my arms, I wiped it off with my gloved hand…I was sweating… I wiped my brow with my arm…. Today I write this post while peering through two squinty slits that the Goddess of Oozing Rashes has graciously allowed me to keep even though I toppled her evil temple. I am leaning slightly to the left. This is because my normal man arm has doubled in both mass and volume and is dripping with the sacred ooze.*  The stump is still about 6 inches high and needs to be burned again. The top and middle of the tree are laying where they fell, with the rotting arms of the goddesses minions waving in the breeze and waiting to curse me one last time…….  *Physical symptoms grossly exaggerated for effect

      It’s been rumored for many years that there is a  urlLink Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy movie  in the works. Apparently, casting is underway, and filming starts this spring. I have mixed feelings about the whole thing. This is why: The Hitchhiker books are some of the funniest, most brilliant and entertaining books ever. Hopefully, the moviemakers know this, and will create a worthy flick. According to the website, Douglas Adams himself wrote the screenplay, which is a good sign. If the movie is done like it should be, it'll be freaking huge. There are opportunities to blow movie watchers away with scenes that put The Lord of the Rings to shame. Just imagine what they can do with Slartibartfast and his terra-forming planet factory, or the 2-headed blue Zaphod Beeblebrox, or the Restaurant at the end of the Universe where they view the “Big-bang” nightly. In addition to the endless eye-candy possibilities, the story, characters and situations are funny as hell. It’s gonna take some damn good film-making to pull this one off. My fingers are crossed.

      The band is playing Springfest this saturday. I think we'll be on the stage by the train station at 2:30. Dickson street will be shoulder to shoulder about then, so it's gonna be a blast. The energy level of our songs is dependant on the venue; sometimes we play the restaurant versions, sometimes the nightclub versions. This weekend though....we're breaking out the super badass Arena versions. I'll have room to run around, and climb stuff, and bite my lip while rocking with total abandon. I even got some fresh Ernie Ball super slinkys for the occasion. Pants are optional, so I won't be wearing any. Also, I think I'll give myself a mohawk.

      We all come across things in our daily grind that just make you sit back and say "damn glad I ain't that sumbitch".  Well, I just got off the phone with a fella that seemed pretty well adjusted (translated means he's not plotting revenge on the dickheads from high school who pissed on him in the shower after gym class) and he actually seemed to know what he was talking about.  We started with the usual banter of how nice the friggin' weather was, how crappy the Brewers are and where the best beer brats could be found and all was going well...until...I asked him for his name so I could document our actual "work" discussion.  Without missing a beat he says "My name is Tony.  Tony Karpfinger".  I says, spell that for me (my juvenilistic sense of humor made it very hard for me not to laugh as he proceeds to spell K-a-r-p-f-i-n-g-e-r).  The conversation was pretty much over for me, as all I could think about was how many ways I could bust on that name.   A certain duo at the big K could discuss that one for, oh, 3-4 weeks.  All I can say is that if I were him my name would have been changed to Nick Papageorgio as soon as I hit 18.

      Last night I got a call unexpectedly from TomGost, who told me he was headed out to see a Rush tribute band. A Rush tribute band?  I’ve never in my life paid good money to go listen to a tribute band. I hear there are some good ones out there, but the concept always seemed a little cheesy. I mean, how could self-respecting musicians find themselves in the position to do this? I mean, hey, I’ve been obsessed with certain bands in my life, but that was when I was a teenager, and teenagers don’t tour the country playing clubs night after night. Then again, it was a RUSH tribute band! Rush is only 3 guys……3 guys who are masters of their trades. 3 virtuosos. I figured that if someone is going to be in a Rush tribute band, the following rules must apply:  1.	if you’re the drummer, you have to be one of the best drummers in the world 2.	if you’re the bass player, you have to be a super-good bass player who can stop playing bass               and start playing the keyboards without ever skipping a beat, AND you have to have a painfully              high singing voice 3.	If you’re the guitar player, well, then you just better kick tons of ass, because if you don’t, then              you’re gonna ruin the whole thing.  So anyways, I decided to go, and it was pretty damn good. They had a great set list, they were good musicians, and they kicked some butt on the songs that really mattered. The highlights of the night were Tom Sawyer, Xanadu, YYZ, Subdivisions, La Villa Strangiato, Red Barchetta, Overture, Jacobs Ladder, Freewill, and The Spirit of Radio. Their were some stanky low points too, but who cares..... I had fun, and so did they.. I checked out  urlLink their website   this morning, and it looks like they just play a couple shows every few months, so this is just a hobby. They do it just because they like it. That being said, I realized my pre-conceived rules were overblown and incorrect. Here are the only real rules for being in a Rush tribute band:  1.	You had to spend countless hours playing Rush songs over and over again when you were a kid. 2.	You must have lots of equipment. 3.	You have to love Rush 4.	You have to forget about money or chicks, because you won’t get either in a Rush cover band.

      Since I bought my house 4 years ago, I’ve had irrational fears of awful things happening to it. I’ve imagined it slowly scooting downhill and collapsing into a pile of rubble, I’ve imagined colonies of extraterrestrial fluorescent molds habitating the nether regions of the crawlspace, I’ve imagined infestations and pestilence. None has come to pass, but the other day……. I opened the furnace to replace my air filter, and when I pulled out the disgusting gray caked patty I noticed that it was soaking wet! I freaked out and looked into the chamber below the filter and the floor was soaked, the sheetrock was mildewy and warped, and I freaked out. I’ve had a headache for a week, and suddenly the big picture came crashing down on me. No, my crawlspace isn’t teeming with alien molds, however, the one place through which all air must pass in my house is contaminated and giving us all a runny nose and a headache. I replaced the filter anyway, and put a huge towel under the drip temporarily until the AC man can come blow out my drain pipes. I’ll probably have to cut out the sheetrock and replace it. Since I had to do something to make myself feel better, I ripped apart my vacuum cleaner and cleaned every tube and filter. Psychologically this had a positive effect on me, but the AC guy just called and told me he cant come until tomorrow. It’s really freaking me out. I saw a 20/20 special once where a house was overtaken by molds and mildews and everyone was sick. It was so bad they had to tear it down and build a new one. Freakin Yuck.

      I felt that it was worth noting that Bobby Sugarpants, our resident primatologist, has left the country. He' s now deep&nbsp;in the jungles of South America playing leopard sounds through a ghetto blaster and watching the monkeys get scared about it. I know it sounds funny, but he has a pretty good idea about what he's doing, and I imagine that he's going to figure out something that noone else has. Lets all send Bobby our happy vibes and wish him well in his endeavors. Good luck Sucka, And if you get a chance, drop us an international pan-galactic post.
