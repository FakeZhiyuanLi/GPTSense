      Kind of unproductive last night.  When to Coffee and surfed the internet.  Getting into going to wifi areas and relaxing.  Good way to save money and have time pass.  Good investment...  ...however, one draw back was, the seating...next time need to be facing people, so I can see some eye candy!

      Had an awsome time parting last night.  My friend was in town from Wash St., had to have a party out.  Went to HMC karaoke, and it was a blast.  The boys came through and showed there support as usual, as well as the ladies, but the guest was a little late.  My girl was singing up a storm and enjoying herself.  However, gave me a little glare at the end when I was talking to a female friend she never met.  This friend is pretty...Haha!  Got the hint, but enjoyed the talk.  Will talk to her again.  I can't believe we drank that much on a work night, but we did it before so why not do it again. haha.  Paying for it right now at work.  Need to have more nights like that, feeling of being free and not worrying of what anyone thinks. Except for the residents that complainted later on that night because we were too loud in the parking lot.  The mananager had to come and tell us we had to leave.

      Hey, had a eventful weekend.  Went to HAL softball Friday, saw all my friends that I haven't seen in months.  Just another reason to drink and have fun.  Saturday, did the early lifting and lunch with CO.  After that was a slow day, party was cancelled, so did laundry. Sunday, two parties, only made it to one...afternoon was so hot and didn't eat all day, only to start drinking at 12noon, then all down hill after that...hung over by 4pm.  Missed the second party, fell asleep and woke up at 8pm.  Anyway...need to have more parties...

      It's been pretty slow today.  Not much happening at home or at work.  Boss has been physically here, but not mentally.  My co-worker said when has the boss ever been mentally here! SO TRUE!!!  I'm going to take a break this weekend and enjoy it with family and friends, also take Monday off from the madness at work.  Monday's always suck no matter where you are.  Unless you have it off or take it off...lol.  Oh...well another day another entry.  Short but sweet...out!

      The continued saga of the Pshyco person.  I text this person and no reply, so told the person got the hint.  Later the person apologizes and says didn't get the msg till two days later. Whatever...I got text msg before that, same frickin system.  Whatever, already...cut this person out...  Anyway, been hitting the gym this past weekend too. Feeling pretty sore, but it was a good burn.  CO is getting stronger, curled 90lb. Haha..i remember when we started, my max was 60lb, I think his was 70lb.  24hr is a good stress relief, other than drinking. haha.  EN took me out to lunch yesterday! It was nice of her and we bonded a little more.  We hardly hangout and when we do it's more of just small talk.  I had a nice time.  Last night had to do laundry...looking for clothes that I want to wear only to be in the laundry bin.  Took me the whole night after work doing the laundry and folding it afterwards.  Had to fold, don't like ironing so better to just hang it in the closet after the dryer.  Didn't feel the urge to go out after laundry, called CO to cancel lifting, but he was already going into the office to put in hours, he had jury duty, so had work to do afterwards.  That sucks.  Well this is the most I ever wrote...will get back...out! Peace!

      Have you ever had someone call your cel phone, home over eight times to try to find where you are?  well I had a person do that the other night.  Didn't even have my phone and the person is all upset.  Can't talk with this person at all.  Now this person won't talk to me, for which I am pretty happy at this point.  person just using me and taking me for granted.  one message was going to ask me to do something, but then changed to, "Just CALL me!"  Oh, well life wouldn't be fun without some drama in it...haha!  Been keeping busy, went to company softball this past Friday...pretty fun and a lot of new pretty ladies...woohoo!!  But have look at the eye candy or my babe will kick my butt...  Oh well...more later...Aloha!

      Took my advise and took a short, but sweet vacation.  My girl and I visited the Garden Isle of Kauai.  Visited family and friends and had a blast with the white sandy beaches.  Only spent a short time there, but it was so relaxing.  Family took us on a tour of the island and all the secret spots to relax and hangout.  I have to admit it was beautiful.  The sun, the white beaches, and not that much people to annoy you.  Well to my friends we have to take another vacation...somewhere, anywhere.  Have to get back to the job...out!
