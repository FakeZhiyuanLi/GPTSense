Uhhuh, I went with my bestest friend, we shared chinese food, bought a pack of gum, and she bought me a cookies n creame chiller from that place...lol. I drank it in like 5 minutes...mmm mmm good! Today I went to Mikes house, n saw him n his cute lil bro Cliff, and saw James too! N then went to James casa where he made me Mac and Cheese he makes it the best, then his mommy brought me home n Parker came over n we chilled n stuff n then we left n went to Stop n Shop with my Madre, n then to the shit hole mall we have. We kept seein ppl we didnt wanna see, so wen we saw them we went the other way...i hate ppl...I dont like being around them, or talkin to them...thats why I dont have a lotta friends, but I think I gotta have a better attitude this year cuz I just do.
