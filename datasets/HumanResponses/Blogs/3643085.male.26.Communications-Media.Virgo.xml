       urlLink    This is another Rachel.  This Rachel is one I'm going to be working with on the new programme I'm on.  This Rachel likes cheese sandwiches.  I think that might be a chive on her chin.  &nbsp; urlLink

       urlLink    Me and the lovely Rachel from resources at the BBC summer party.  Rachel lived in the halls of residence across from me at Nottingham Trent University's Clifton campus.  She was the last girl I properly fancied before I went a bit funny.  She's now happily married.  Well married anyway.  Who am I to say if its happy?  She certainly looks happy. But that may just be because she's with me.  &nbsp; urlLink

      Ok change of plan.  In what can only be described as a photo-finish result the bbc managed to come up with an offer today to entice me to stay with them for two more months.  This means I had to let STV down but my lovely former boss there was very kind about it and told me not to worry.  So after my week's sojourn in London next week catching up with Keith, I will start on a programme about morals.  So I intend to spend some time thinking about my own morals.  In what areas do I have strong morality and in which do I not?    Actually I dont know if I'll think about that too much.  I've bought tickets for Jerry Springer: The Opera on thursday.  I'll save the moralising for then.  And even then I probably won't.  I hope Keith enjoys it.  I think he prefers more traditional fare than songs about bestiality and bigamy.  I catch a train to Euston tomorrow at 2pm from Glasgow Central.  Please baby Jeebus keep the drunken nutters far from my carriage.  Love to your folks, Jono xxx

      In honour of my first comment (attached to the picture of me, alison and ellen in starbucks) i publish below a picture of my first commentator.  Its the lovely Mairead.  She's second from left.  She's irish.  She looks irish, she sounds irish and she even spells irish.  Note the excellent use of the word 'Jaysus' and 'doirty' in said comment.  Loving your work my lovely.

      So its decided.  I'm leaving the BBC and heading back to my old stomping ground of STV.  I'm kind of looking forward to it as I have a lot of old friends there.  But its always weird going back to a place you haven't been for a while.  Plus I get to muck about in front of a camera which is always nice for the ego, even my little regional ego.  And its a good excuse to buy some new clothes.  I have next week off and I'm going down to London.  Will probably do some shopping then.    GOOD GOD - what a boring post.  Apologies.

      This weekend I was graced with a visit from my good friends Beverley and Imogen.  I used to work with them in Southampton and it was good to see them again.  We had mucho fun, involving acrobats and smoking pipes.  Sadly my camera didn't work so there is no evidence of Beverley's visit.  There's some pictures of Imogen above though.    In other news I'm a bit all over the place with work at the moment.  Will update you when I know exactly what's happening.  But right now I don't.  Isn't that lovely!    I see Keith a week today.  Woo!

      Last night, around this time, I received an email from Australian immigration granting me a 12 month working holiday visa.  So sometime soon I'll be heading off.  I guess this is going to be a diary of it all.  It seems like a good time to be starting it.    As it stands at the moment I am working in Glasgow, saving money to head out to Sydney.  Waiting there is a nice guy called Keith.  Well, he's not  just  waiting there.  He's doing other things too, like working in investment banking and playing tennis and inviting friends round for jacuzzis.  Actually right now he is in Seoul which is in Korea fact fans!  I think there may have been a world cup there when I was younger.  I think I may have built the mascot for it out of a kinder egg.    I wonder how it will all pan out?  Will I:  a) be struck down tomorrow on the great western road by a 'wee happy bus'? b) hear that Keith has been struck down in the streets of Korea by a 'wee happy rickshaw'? c) get to Sydney and be struck down with heat exhaustion and sent home in a fridge?    All will be revealed...  Jono x  ps - this blog is called Knees of My Bees.  It comes from a joke on 'Kath and Kim' - a v amusing aussie sitcom that you can sometimes catch on LivingTV.  Its also the title of a song on Alanis Morissette's new album 'So Called Chaos' which is a very good album.

      hey folks.&nbsp; I'm just back from a trip to Oban on the west coast of Scotland.&nbsp; Was doing a spot of filming there but it wasn't the greatest of shoots for me.&nbsp; It all started when we turned up at the hotel to find it was pretty minging and the owner had a go at us because apparently the BBC still hadn't paid its bill from last time some crew stayed there.&nbsp; (Who were these BBC employees and why didn't they warn us?).&nbsp; Anyway the rooms were vaguely ok but the bar was really dark and it had a huge carved wooden penis on the bartop with&nbsp;two wee&nbsp;ashtrays where the testicles should be.&nbsp; I wanted to get a picture of it but it was behind a few bottles and i didn't want to touch it in case it was used in whatever wicker man activities they get up to up there.&nbsp; Anyway that still wasn't so bad until I ordered my coke.&nbsp; The people we were filming had arrived and we were to have a bar lunch with them and generally schmooze and impress etc.&nbsp; I took a swig of my coke and felt something in my mouth.&nbsp; I thought it was like a bit of lettuce or something.&nbsp; I reached into my mouth and pulled out......&nbsp;&nbsp; the biggest f**king spider you've ever seen in all your days.&nbsp; And IT WAS ALIVE!!!!&nbsp; I put it on the floor and IT DRAGGED ITSELF AWAY!!!&nbsp; It must have been at least 2 centimetres long which doesn't seem a lot but it is when its in your mouth.&nbsp; How minging is that?&nbsp; Worst of all was the fact I couldn't react as I didn't want to cause an upset and put everyone off their food which had by now arrived.&nbsp; So I had to quietly freak out on my own.&nbsp; I should point out that I am a vegetarian.&nbsp; I guess this makes it a little worse - but its not like meat eaters regularly eat spiders so maybe it doesnt.&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyway later that day the contributor's gerbil ran right up my trouser leg while we were filming an interview and again I couldn't react as we were in the middle of the shoot.&nbsp; It didn't make it to my pants but it did its damndest.&nbsp;   So I'm glad to be home now.&nbsp; I'm mainly filming in Edinburgh for the next week so all should be back to normal for a bit.&nbsp; Then I think I am back in Orkney the week after that.&nbsp; I'm very nearly Orcadian these days.&nbsp;   J xxx

      It was my Aunty Rosemary's 50th birthday soiree last night.&nbsp; Below are some pics of us out at 'The Loft' in Glasgow's Ashton Lane.&nbsp; I got her a nice bottle of Veuve Clicquot and I made her a nice photo album of her life so far which unfortunately made her cry.&nbsp; That wasnt so good as she had to reapply makeup and all that.&nbsp; I think she liked it anyway.&nbsp; She was probably just crying at the horrific hair cuts she had in&nbsp;some of those photos.&nbsp; Rosemary is the only person I know who spends her life getting younger with each passing day.&nbsp; I have no doubt that in a few years time we will be pushing her up the street in a pram.&nbsp; She's already heading for the&nbsp;Pampers&nbsp;everytime she laughs.&nbsp; Anyway the point is I'm the one who looks 50 in these photos.&nbsp; Argh!

      In my 26 years&nbsp;I had never been to the Orkney islands.&nbsp; Today I got back from my second trip there in a week.&nbsp; Sometimes I love my job.&nbsp; Other times I hate it.&nbsp; This is one of the times I like it.&nbsp; It was a cool trip.&nbsp; Had filming all day Wednesday but managed to change my return flight to make it a day later.&nbsp; Went out for a pint with Cameron last night and today did my touristy bit - as detailed below.&nbsp; I also managed to fit in a visit to the Stromness museum which features an exhibit all about Cameron which was kind of weird.&nbsp; It was totally worth the £2.50 admission just for the childhood photos of him and his peedie*&nbsp;brother Julyan.&nbsp; I thought my kiddie photos were bad!&nbsp; If you think your parents didn't dress you expecially nicely as a child, just imagine what it could have been like if they&nbsp;could only&nbsp;shop in Stromness.&nbsp;   Got back about half six tonight and my wee cousin Gemma came over with photos for the album I am making as a surprise for my aunty Rosemary for her&nbsp;50th birthday.&nbsp; Then took a run over to my Nana's to raid her photo pile.&nbsp; Looking at old photos with old people is something I recommend you do more often.&nbsp; Its great fun and it reminds you of your own mortality which is not necessarily a bad thing.&nbsp;   I'm missing Keith lots but I'm trying not to think about it.&nbsp; So I won't even write about it.&nbsp; Suffice to say he is in Singapore and has just found out he has to go to Hong Kong next week instead of home to Sydney.&nbsp; The poor thing wont have been home in about a month.&nbsp; He's been away so long his electricity has been cut off.&nbsp; God you'd think he lives in the outback.&nbsp; He's only off Oxford street.&nbsp;   Ok nighty night folks.&nbsp;   J x  * peedie = orcadian for 'wee'

      top o the mornin to ye.&nbsp; its afternoon now though.&nbsp; never mind.&nbsp; my trip around scotland went very well.&nbsp; before this week the furthest north i'd been in the uk was inverness.&nbsp; now its stromness!&nbsp;  &nbsp; we filmed first in peterhead.&nbsp; stayed in a nice enough hotel where the night porter freaked me out by dragging me away from the rest of the crew and offering me the keys to the hotel pool to go skinny-dipping.&nbsp; i passed on that little offer.&nbsp;  &nbsp; then it was on to banff where we had a nice little bungalow in the grounds of a hotel.&nbsp; then on to thurso which - apologies miss debbie dunnett - is a dump.&nbsp; we stayed in a fairly nasty hotel there.&nbsp; then we caught a boat to the orkney islands where our show's presenter - cameron - is from.&nbsp; he enjoyed showing us about and we went for a really nice chinese meal&nbsp;that night.&nbsp; we sat around the table telling ghost stories.&nbsp; or rather everyone else told the stories and me and our production assistant barbara quietly freaked out.&nbsp; i managed to sleep ok though but allan the cameraman scared himself too much.&nbsp; the hotel we were in was the old hospital you see....&nbsp;  &nbsp; anyway it was a cool trip and the last hotel we were in back in thurso was really nice.&nbsp; i'm heading back to orkney on tuesday just for one night.&nbsp; wish it was longer.&nbsp; its a really cool place and i'd like some more time to explore it properly - maybe go diving among the ww2 wrecks at scapa flow.&nbsp; would be bloody cold though.&nbsp;  &nbsp; will no doubt have some more pics for you later in the week.&nbsp;  &nbsp; J x &nbsp; ps - i went to see spiderman2 yesterday.&nbsp; it was cool.&nbsp; spiderman still looks a bit too animated for me though.&nbsp; cgi is not all its cracked up to be!

      Hello.  Not had time to do much posting as I've been busy at work.  Also I've been lazy.  Anyway below are my pics from my travels with Keith last week.  Had a great time in London meeting his mates and mine.  Then up to Aberdeen to meet his parents!  Eek!  All went ok.    Have to run - I've got a week away with work this week.  Heading up to Peterhead today, then Banff, then Thurso then Orkney.  I'm reliably informed that the hotels should be 'interesting'.  Will furnish you with photos of it all upon my return.    Later gators!  (Thats a whole other story!!!!!)  Jono x

      Just off the plane from Orkney.  We had a rare old time at the Dounby show.  The sheep we were filming won the inter-breed award which means it was the best sheep in all of Dounby.  We were all very proud.  Didn't get up to too much mischief unless you count our delight at finding the masks - see below.   Last night we went to a lovely little inn in Stromness where we had great food.  After the meal a group of locals gathered to play traditional celtic music.  It was so cool except they all seemed to be English.  Not that this should make a difference I suppose seeing as the choons were good.   Anyway I had a great time.  Orkney is a wonderful and very friendly place.   Jono xx  ps - not much planned for this weekend, just sorting stuff out.  Monday is an exciting day though as I get to meet none other than Bart Simpson himself - Nancy Cartwright.  Am definitely getting a photo of this so stand by for it!

       urlLink    in the taxi back to bbc. the driver chose to ignore us which i feel was the correct response. we were in 'character', i was explaining how i had been judged the best pig in western europe by Cilla Black... basically you get two drinks on the orkney-glasgow flight cos you have to stop in Inverness. I had vodka and gin.   urlLink

      Everyone knows when you are interviewing for a flatmate you can turn up some odd folk.  Just take a look at the movie 'Shallow Grave' (early Ewan McGregor).  I've encountered some in the past, like the guy who came round to view a room i had free but he hadn't been home from the night before.  He'd pulled someone. stayed at theirs and then come round to view my flat still wearing his ruffled shirt from the night before, sweating alcohol and telling all about his adventures.  That aint gonna work my friend.  But tonight's effort really took the biscuit.  For legal reasons I can only let out the other couple of rooms in my flat to a couple or a single person.  No way round that.  Tonight a lesbian couple came round to look at the flat.  They seemed very nice except for the following three facts:  1. They both played the drums and intended to practise regularly - strike one.  2. They had a dog who was four feet tall - strike two.  3. THEY WEREN'T ACTUALLY A LESBIAN COUPLE THEY WERE JUST PRETENDING - strike five hundred and thirty-seven.   Good God in Govan!  What in the name of the wee man is that all about?  That takes the crunchy biscuit it really does.   But on the plus side I had been a bit weepy all night about my imminent departure and all that I'm leaving behind so the laugh we got after the pretend lesbians had left made me feel SO much better.  I can't thank them enough.  They aint moving into my flat but I reckon they were sent by the big man to make my life a little bit nicer this evening.  Thank you ladeez!   Anyway look how late it is - after 11.  I have to be up at 5.  I am going back to Orkney (sick of the Orkney pics yet folks?).  This time I am going with the lovely Rachel whose picture you will find below.  The first pics of this post at the very bottom are from a small gathering at my workmate Pauline's flat the friday before last.   Jono xxx  ps - hurrah!  Nadia won Big Brother.  She is FAB-U-LOS!!!

       urlLink    on saturday i took my flatmates out to my mum and dad's boat on loch lomond and we went to one of the islands, climbed up a hill and took in this scenery.  isn't it amazing.  i'm sad to be leaving this behind.  from me (superman) clockwise  - joel & sallie, the lovely scottish/californian couple who are taking on my flat while i am away - dan and stephanya a lovely couple, dan is the brother of - anya (next to me) who is my old friend and flatmate and has already appeared on this blog before.  &nbsp; urlLink

      Have had a fairly quiet weekend so the only excitement I can conjure up for this blog at the moment is a little stroll down memory lane with some old snaps.  There's loads more where they came from so I should be able to string them out for a while, plugging the gaps where I'm doing little of interest.   Directly below this though is a picture of Keith taken last night which he sent me before he went to bed last night.  Doesn't he look cute?   Rightio I'm off to bed.   J x  ps - don't forget you can comment on any of the pictures or posts just by clicking on the bit that says '# comments' below it.

       urlLink    Here's Keith in bed with a total dog.  I don't know who the dog is - one things for sure its not the dog I gave him as my going away present.  That was a dinky little spaniel we named Angus...  We just liked the name...&nbsp; urlLink

       urlLink    Just for a laugh - here's a picture of me two years ago this month.  I'm on a train somewhere in the south of Spain, probably Seville or somewhere like that.  I think I look alright with no hair but very few people agreed with me, least of all my mum.  &nbsp; urlLink

       urlLink    Friday 27th February 2004.  Me in Melbourne - Ramsay Street to be exact.  Except its not called Ramsay Street, I forget what its called.  Anyway obviously its where the tv soap 'Neighbours' is set.  It was actually a bit emotional going there as it reminded me of my youth - all the wasted hours spent watching Kylie and co playing about on Ramsay Street when I should have been out kicking a ball in my own street.  Wasted childhood.  Anyway... Two days after this was taken I flew to Sydney where I met Keith.  &nbsp; urlLink

       urlLink    4th January 2004 - Robert, Susan and Gavin on our trip to NYC.  This is us at the bar-jains in a huge shopping outlet complex in deepest, darkest New Jersey.  Fellow shopper Carly isn't in this picture - she was too busy purchasing to pose for snaps.  This is the first proper picture I took with my digital camera which I bought that day.  &nbsp; urlLink
