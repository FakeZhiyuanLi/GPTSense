      You do not  &nbsp; understand  This is not  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; your land  This is our  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;land  Together we will  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; stand   Get  &nbsp; off that hill  You do  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; not belong!  Your&nbsp;bell is&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ringing  Ding  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dong.

      False persona exist In the eyes of the blind Blithe, lighthearted enjoyment Inevitably artificial  Unspoken deeds An unknown mastery I possess Desired with utmost malice Relished with love's hero  A belief I hold The belief system; corrupt Conflicts are the action Brutality, reaction  Nucleus of a nation Crooked from within Quiet revolts ubiquitously Spoken finest through ink  Undeniably true Nothing is forever Bliss, love, success Anger, envy, hatred Defines Life

      There is something dark here Something unpleasent is near Black flows everywhere Evil is around And there is no sound  Shine a light towards it Light from the fear inside Knocked back from the flood of darkness With the power of a teary tide  Lines of information Create a web of nothing The complex is lost Without meaning Without cause Without life

      A restless beginning Ignited by discomfort In need of an outlet For this pain and hurt So I used this device To get ahold of you And relieve me of my fears Which are far from few  You hung up, yes you did But not before you said...  The mind's loss A beautiful thing Goodnight and Sweet dreams of nothing  Where do I go from here? Another distressful night I remember what you said And you are always right So I started to fade away And you walked through the door You want me to end your fears But I can't face the horror  And in my eyes were doubt But the words that came out...  The mind's loss A beautiful thing Goodnight and Sweet dreams of nothing

      So here I stand Battered and bruised Shirtless, broken Lost and confused There's more than you think More than written in ink Because behind these eyes Is where the truth lies

      Reach out your hand For an offering And the world returns it Bloody and broken  If there is a worst thing It will happen to me  And it's almost laughable To pity How much the world is out To make me miserable  If I could hit restart I'd do it If I could erase anything I'd do it If I could get anyone To help I'd do it And if there was anything I could do Than sit in complete darkness I'd do it

      In a race with life I can't keep up Life is running circles around me  Put my fears aside Slap me in the face They just won't leave me be  Stuck in a hopeless dream Please                           Please Release me.
