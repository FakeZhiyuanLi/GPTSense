        Dad liked to polka every once and a while. If a good polka song came on the radio (that sat on top the fridge in the kitchen) dad would reach up and turn up the volume, then start bouncing around the house. It was nice to see him grab mom and to the "Farniok bounce" around the kitchen.

       My first king salmon was caught on June --, 2004. On the Little Susitna River, near Wasilla, Alaska. We met the boat at 6:00am. The weather in the morning was chilly and it got pretty warm by noon. The river in most places was 3ft deep. Didn't get much deeper.  I was the first one in the boat to catch my King (only allowed one, per day, per body of water) and I caught the biggest one! It was 30lbs. It was also a fighter, took a good 15 min to get him in the boat!
