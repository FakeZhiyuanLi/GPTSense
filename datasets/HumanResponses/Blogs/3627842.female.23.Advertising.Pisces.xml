      I've decided I'd like to be in love.  But not just love like we have today.  I want to be in love in a movie in the 1940's.  I want all the romance, the passion, the chivalry, the whole package.  I want the dramatic music to cue at the beginning of a heart-felt moment.  I want obstacles to overcome and trials that end up strenthening the love instead of weakening it.    Have you seen the new movie, "The Notebook" yet?  Well, I'm guessing you haven't because I saw an early sneak preview of it on Tuesday.  The movie comes out this Friday, and I would recommend it to anyone.  Even guys.  It may be kind of a chic flick, butI suspect guys will like the story line just as much as girls.  It's such a beuatiful movie.  In fact, I would rank it among the most beautiful films I've seen.  In that same category are "A River Runs Through It" and "In America," two movies you should definitely watch if you haven't already.  I'm sure you've seen the trailer on TV, but in case you missed it for some odd reason, you can watch the preview and two short scenes from the movie at this website:  thenotebookmovie.com  If anyone sees "The Notebook" this weekend, please post a comment w/ your own personal review.  I'd love to hear your thoughts.  Good night all.  Here's to the heart, here's to Hollywood, and here's to the hope that we'll all find that kind of perfect love one day.

      Well, here I am in San Antonio for Father's Day.  I got here yesterday, and mom and I went to go see The Terminal with Tom Hanks.  It was a good movie.  Tom Hanks has got to be one of the most versatile and talented actors out there.  It's funny though, even with his foreign accent, he still maintains some of the classic "Tom Hanks" gestures and tonal inflections.  Anyway, good movie.  I would recommend it.  Today mom and I are going to go to this store called The Bombay Company that my mom's been wanting to show me for a while.  Apparently they have really nice home furnishings for decent prices.  Then tonight we are making dinner at home for Father's Day.  My old friend from Texas State, Paris (Matt Sharp) is coming over for dinner.  I haven't seen him in a long time so it will be good to catch up.  We're about to step out, so I'll post more later.    Happy Father's Day to all you dads out there reading my blog... or to all of you sons and daughters, I hope you're enjoying the day with your dad.

      UPDATE!! Texas State won third place in the Nation again this year!  Go team!  I'm so proud of them for placing in the top four, especially when they came as the wild card.  They beat like fourteen other teams who had won first in each of their districts.    Unfortunately, SMU won first in the nation and they are our biggest rival.  Also, the presenters on that team each win an all expenses paid one week vacation to Florida.  BOO SMU!  Those kids don't need money for vacations anyway!  Sorry Todd, if you're reading this.  Your brother can be one of the cool kid exceptions at that school!  So to end on a happy note, TEXAS STATE ROCKS!  I'm so proud of this year's team!  You all did it and should be so proud of yourselves!

      Rebecca just called to my attention the fact that I overlooked writing about seeing her this past weekend.  Sorry Rebecca!  I guess I just got so carried away with my AAF news, that I forgot to mention hanging out with my buddy.  So we did hang out and we did have fun.  I got to Rebecca's loft around 7:30 and we went almost directly to the mall, where we shopped at Charlotte Ruse (sp)?  I tried on some of those skimpy skirts that are really much too short for my long legs and shall we say "ample" bootie.  It's not that I have a huge butt, but I also don't have one of those tiny, flat as a board butts either.  And I think those skirts were designed for the buttless.  So anyway, Rebecca w/ her cute little bootie, bought a skirt, her sister bought a few things and we then headed to the Cheesecake Factory - so I could work on increasing my already ample bootie I suppose.  We had quite a wait there, but the food was worth it.  If you have one near you, I would reccomend the New Orleans shrimp.  Very scrumptious.  Rebecca and Sarah had some sort of devilish chocolate brownie tower with ice cream and whipped cream.  It was pretty darn good.  I helped eat some of it, being the good friend that I am.  Always ready to pitch in and help!  So then we came back to Rebecca's and hung out there.  We were thinking about going out to Liberty Hall (an Irish Pub), but we ended up being too tired to get all gussy'ed up and go out again.  So we ended up crashing around midnight, which was good since I had to get up early for the AAF presentations the next day.  So there you go, Rebecca.  Don't be sad that I didn't mention you before.  I don't know what I was thinking!  Oh yeah, and after the competition, I met up w/ Rebecca for dinner at Rockfish for some more girl bonding and conversation.  It was great to see you Rebecca Lynn, and I miss you too!  On another note, I sold an ad to a golf course today!  One step closer to having this golf guide for the "Explore Austin Map" wrapped up.  We are under a tight deadline, so I'm hoping it will all come together.  Good night everyone.  And goodnight moon.  "Goodnight Moon" - remember that kid's book?  It's a good one.  You should check it out if you haven't already!

      Wow, this is my first post for all the world to read.  I must say it's an intoxicating feeling, knowing that my words could reach millions of eager readers.  Or it could reach my three or four friends who might be interested in what goes on in my little life.  Either way, it's kind of a fun concept.  I just got back from the AAF National Student Advertising Competition, in Dallas, TX.  I went to go show support for Texas State, who made it to Nationals this year on Wild Card.  That means out of all the second place teams in the nation, they had the best plans book.  So anyway, they did a great job on their presentation.  I was so happy for them and proud they were representing our school.  I was actually on the presentation team last year, so it was cool to be able to be there for this year's team.  Last year, we got third place in the nation.  This year, who knows?  We'll find out tomorrow.  Tomorrow is kind of a special day.  I don't have to be in at work until 8:45 b/c we had such a busy week last week.  Any time I can sleep in an extra 30 minutes, I know it will be a good day.    Well, that's about all for me tonight.  Thanks for reading, and check back soon for more updates.

      No real reason for this blog entry, other than to say Life is Good.   I am drinking a glass of Yellow Tail Shiraz as I type these words.&nbsp; And later tonight I will be going to Round Rock to see two of my friends perform live : John Mckallip of The John Show&nbsp;  urlLink www.thejohnshow.net , and Bruce of 'Kill me Sarah"  urlLink www.killmesarah.com  .  I can't wait to see them!&nbsp; They are both very talented musicians, and I love listening to them play.&nbsp; John's lyrics are always interesting.&nbsp; He is a talented song writer as well as singer and guitarist.&nbsp; Bruce I'm just getting to know, but he is a very cool guy from what I know about him so far.&nbsp; He's got an incredible voice.&nbsp;   Tomorrow night I am going to see the Tim McGraw concert in San Antonio with Sandi and Paris.&nbsp; That should be a great time.&nbsp; Can't wait to see my boy Tim again.&nbsp; He is a hunk and I love his songs.&nbsp; One of my favorites that he sings, and believe me when I say it's hard to pick a favorite is, "She Can't be Really Gone."&nbsp; It's so beautiful and heartfelt.&nbsp; I have like three or four of his&nbsp;CD's.&nbsp;   It's funny how just one glass of red wine can make me feel totally relaxed and a little tipsy.&nbsp; I'm not even trying for a buzz here, and here it comes anyway!&nbsp; But oh well, life is good.   &nbsp;   &nbsp;

        Saw The Bourne Supremecy today.&nbsp;&nbsp; It was awesome!!    You must check it out.&nbsp;  Matt Damon is pretty damn good looking  in it, as he is in every movie he's been in thus far.&nbsp; The plot is quick and suspenseful, and there are scenes that definitely make your heart beat faster.&nbsp; I even bretahed in loudly in fear&nbsp;at one point.&nbsp; What can I say, I was really sucked into the whole thing!   &nbsp;  Last night I went to The Alamo Draft House to see a  Mr. Sinus Theater production of "Dirty Dancing." &nbsp; It was pretty hilarious at times, but I actually thought they could have done more with it.&nbsp; I mean there is a lot of funny material to work with, and I just thought they didn't quite go far enough.&nbsp; Although, don't get me wrong, they did go pretty far.&nbsp; Every time it looked like the dancers were going beyond that thin line between "dirty dancing and clean sex" one of the comedians would say, "I'm inside you!" and the whole audience was suposed to respond by yelling, "Get the f*** out!" and drinking.&nbsp; That was interesting.&nbsp; For some reason I feel a little uncomfortable yelling that word in public.&nbsp; Something about it just doesn't seem very lady like.&nbsp; I think my mohter would agree!&nbsp; The guys had no problem with the phrase of course!&nbsp; (Even though it wouldn't really apply to them come to think about it, would it?)  &nbsp;  It has been another great weekend, and I think I will finish it off by going to the gym to burn some of the extra calories I ingested this weekend.&nbsp; Speaking of calories, if you're looking for a good high caloric treat, you should definitely try  fried pickles .&nbsp; I had some at the draft house and they were delicious!&nbsp; I know, I never would have thought of ordering them either, but I had first been introduced to them at Katz' deli a few weekends ago and immediately became a fan.&nbsp;  Here's to new favorite foods!&nbsp; Yummm....  &nbsp;  &nbsp;

      So last night I went to my first yoga class ever at the Gold's Gym downtown.  My friend, Sabrina told me about it and said it was a begginer's class, so I thought, why not?  I'm really glad I went, but it didn't feel much like a beginner's class.  I probably would have been better off starting with a class called "Yoga for Dummies."  The instructor had this cool English accent.  Well, I'm pretty sure it was English.  It also could have been Irish or Austrailian.  Sometimes it's hard to distinguish.  Anyway, he was speeding through some of the moves, and I had to strain to keep up.  Today I can definitely feel a little soreness in my muscles.  It's a good feeling though, because I know I worked myself!  I'm planning to again, but I'm going to try out some different instructors to see which I am most comfortable with.    Woah, look out. Cassie is finally catching up with the latest excersize routines.  Maybe I'll try pilates in ten years!

      This post was inspired by Rebecca's friend, Ashley's blog post, entitled "C2."  She had a very interesting take on how people are never really satisfied with anything.  The commercial spot for "C2", the new Coke w/ fewer carbs, plays the song, "You can't always get what you want... but if you try sometimes, you just might find, you get what you need."  Great song by the way, and I love those commercials.    Ashley pointed out that if Coke can look at life that way, why can't the rest of us?  That got me to thinking about my life, and the things that I want and need.  It seems no matter how great my life is going, I am always looking to the next thing to make it that much better.  If I find a job right after graduation, which I did, I just find myself bored and wanting a new job.  If I live in a great city with lots of fun activities for young people, I wonder what it would be like to live in a different city. If I'm single, I wish I had a boyfriend.  If I have a boyfriend, I remember the good old days of being single.  There's always something.  Don't we all think that way?  If only I lost 15 pounds, or if only my hair were a little longer/shorter/blonder/darker/straighter/curlier, etc.  Girls, you know what I'm talking about.  If only I had a pet, or if only I didn't have a pet, so I could leave on vacation without worrying about who will take care of Sparky, if only I had a better/more fulfilling/better paying job, or if only I had a nicer apartment or house.  The list can go on and on, and it can drive you a little crazy if you let it.    For right now, I'm trying to enjoy my life just the way it is.  Because you can't get these years back.  And why spend your time worrying about the future or wishing for things you don't have?  You might as well enjoy your life for what it is, now at this very moment.  Because really, all we have is a series of moments that make up our lives.  The more we can learn to live in the moment, the more happiness and satisfaction we can derive from our lives.  This is not to say we should all forget about our futures.  That is certainly important; but, we should also try to stop and smell the roses now and then without wondering what the rose garden will look like ten years from now.

      Lyrics to one of my favorite love songs:  The Way You Look Tonight   You may remember this song from movies such as "My Best Friend's Wedding" and "Father of the Bride."  Anyway, I was thinking of this song this morning, and I just wanted to share it.  So here it is.  Enjoy.  Someday When I'm awfully low When the world is cold I will feel a glow just thinking of you And the way you look tonight   Yes you're lovely With your smile so warm And your cheeks so soft There is nothing for me but to love you And the way you look tonight   With each word your tenderness grows Tearing my fear upon it And that laugh Wrinkles your nose Touches my foolish heart   Lovely Never ever change Keep that breathless charm Won't you please arrange it Cause I love you Just the way you look tonight   And that laugh That wrinkles your nose It touches my foolish heart   Lovely Don't you ever change Keep that breathless charm Won't you please arrange it Cause I love you Just the way you look tonight   Hmm... Hmm... Just the way you look tonight

      Last night I went to see the sneak preview of "Anchorman" with Will Ferrel at Waterloo Park.  Well, I didn't go WITH Will Ferrel, but you know what I mean!  Anyway, it was a funny/goofy movie.  A good one to see if you're just in a goofy mood and feel like laughing at ridiculous lines and cheesey/spoofy situations.  There's even a part of the movie where Christina Applegate's character says, "Take me to pleasure-town," and then they show the two of them romping around on unicorns in a make-belive world.  Pretty out there!  Tonight I am going to see a musical (The Secret Garden) at an outdoor theater in Zilker Park.  I'm going with Sabrina and a guy we met last Friday downtown.  It will be fun to hang out with him again.  Plus, this time we'll be sober, so we will be much better judges of character!
