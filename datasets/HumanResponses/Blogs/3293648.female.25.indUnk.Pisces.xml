       Since moving to San Francisco (I've called this city much worse names, but will digress here), I've suffered through some of the strangest experiences o my life, but what strikes me as odd is how the strangest ones all seem to be transit related.    I stood on the street this morning, waiting for the train.  Usually this experience entails squeezing yourself in between strangers, most of whom shower regularly, but there's always the exception.  Today, however, the N Judah line was experiencing some sort of technical difficulty and MUNI, in it's infinite wisdom, had sent a bus to pick us up.  Yup.  A bus. Not several busses, but A bus.  So, as we squeezed in tighter than normal, I knew the day was off to a blazing start.  Little did I know I was sharing this particular bus with an especially angry young man.  After nearly starting a fight with the man standing in front of his seat for standing too close to him, he yelled at an elderly woman next to him for coughing too much.  Apparently he'd never ridden public transit in San Francisco before.  After the standing-too-close-guy explained to him that he'd love to step back, but that unfortunately we were all stuck on a small bus, our angry rider threatened to follow the guy off the bus to attack him after the ride.  This all seems a little too much for 8:30 AM, but it gets better.  We thought we were spared from a fist fight when we pulled up to the next stop and passengers shifted so that the standing man could move further back.  But alas, a new unsuspecting passenger stood in front of the angry rider, apparently bumped or stepped on Angry's shoe.  The new passenger apologized, but apparently not to Angry's satisfaction, so the yelling ensued.  When instructed by other assorted passengers to shit up and relax, he started jumping around and knocking into people yelling "throw me off the bus, throw me off the bus."    The MUNI driver continued on his way.  I saw several passengers pull out cell phones, so I'm not sure if the driver called the police or if a passenger did, but about two stops up the road, the SFPD was waiting for us.  We all had the pleasure of getting off the bus so that this a**hole could get taken into custody.  Now, I'm a proud liberal democrat.  I understand the evils of single-passenger vehicle commutes, but I gotta tell ya.  I love my car.  If I never have to ride the bus again, it will be too soon.  The real kicker, this guy was apparently studying to become a taxi driver.  Talk about road rage, and he wasn't even behind the wheel yet.

       I sacrificed an unmentionable amount of recent hours sorting through various blogs relating to just about everything and decided, much as I did with the cell phone, that if everyone else has one, I should get one too.  The real test will be, as it was with the cell phone, if this monkey can figure out how to use it...
