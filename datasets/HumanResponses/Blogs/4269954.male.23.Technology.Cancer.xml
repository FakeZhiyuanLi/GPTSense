       Wow... today was an early day for me.  I'm glad Aaron convinced me on PRGS.  At 9:51am EST I bought 633 shares of PRGS at $20.15.  At 10:10am EST, it spiked to $20.90 and automatically sold.  Also, since I made such a great gain on PRGS, I decided to lower my limit order on WB... it sold at 10:45am EST for $46.14.   Today's Percentage Gain On Investments: 2.145%   Overall Balance: $26,188.25   Overall Gain On Total Investments: 4.753%   Average Days Per Trade: 1.33     So, after 6 trading days, I've scored a overall 4.753% gain on my investment.  In a regular savings account at Bank of America, the APR is 0.75%.  That means if you would have put your $25000 in 6  years  ago... you'd have the same return as my experiment.  Booyah.  -Bo

       I have come to the conclusion that there are no worthy picks today.  A few stocks got 9 of 10 criteria right, and a few got 8 of 10... but thats not good enough.  I'm going to sit on my WB stock and hope it sells today so that I can trade my entire balance tomorrow.  I'll keep ya updated.  -Bo

       Well, a decent day on the market... I ended up selling CAI, but not WB.  At 10:31am EST, CAI was sold at $47.07 a share for a 1.12% gain.  WB is going to have to wait until next week.   Today's Percentage Gain On Investments: 1.12% (CAI only)

       Since half of our money is tied up in CAI from yesterday, we only get to choose 1 stock today.  Today's pick is WB.   At 9:59am EST I bought 280 shares of WB at $45.88.  -Bo

       Today, in contrast to yesterday, the market was on a decline.  I quickly made my 1% and some on HAR within 10 minutes of buying.  At 10:09am EST I sold my shares of HAR at $87.78.  CAI on the other hand was pretty stagnant today.  I looked more into it, and the difference between HAR and CAI is that CAI's main percentage gains appeared in the before-market hours.  HAR had to before-market trading, so it's gains from it's upgrade in status were throughout the day.  CAI did waver within about 1% of its open price, but I got in a little too late.  We'll just have to stick it out and wait until it sells for it's 1%.  For now, I cannot update my total balance, because I don't want to "estimate" the equity that I have in outstanding stock, so I'll only provide you with the statistics of the day...   Today's Percentage Gain On Investments: 1.4% (HAR only)   -Bo

       First off, I am starting out with a theoretical nest-egg of $25,000 (it's a common amount on the fantasy stock market site I use). Also, I am using a commission rate of $10.95 per trade based on rates that I found on  urlLink http://www.ameritrade.com . Also, the "system" says you should put all your money into 1 of the approved stocks. I am going to try to put my money into 2 approved stocks when I can unless there is only 1.  Day 1: According to the 1% Theory system, I picked ASO and CPSI. At 10:07am EST I bought 478 shares of ASO at $25.39 and 587 shares of CPSI at $20.55. I set up a couple of limit orders (automatic orders to sell when they reach 1% or higher) and went on my way.  Lets see how long it takes to succeed or fail... 1.5 hours...  At 11:04am EST I sold ASO at $25.75 and at 11:23am EST I sold CPSI for $20.77.   Today's Percentage Gain On Investments: 1.065% Overall Balance: $25,301.22 Overall Gain: 1.03% Average Days Per Trade: 1     In case you're wondering, there will always be a slight discrepancy between "Today's Percentage Gains" and how much the overall gain goes up. Today it is illustrated because I did not use 100% of the cash that I had to make the trade... I used most of it though :-)

       Hey everybody... this blog has been made solely to test the "1% Theory of Stock Trading" that I came across on the Internet. The system basically states a set of rules on which to buy a stock (being recently upgraded in status by a Broker is the main criterion)... and tells you to sell it automatically when it reaches a 1% gain. So, I buy a stock in the morning at $15.00 and set it to automatically sell at $15.15. Minus some commission, you make a little under 1%.  I am using  urlLink http://game.marketwatch.com  to track my results with fake money of course. Unfortunately, it has been brought to my attention that MarketWatch has some bad bugs in the software. Just as a precaution, I am also calculating my trades in an excel spreadsheet based on the buy price, sell price, commission costs, total percent gains, and current balance.  I will post my stock picks at the end of each day to let you know how they do. The "system" that I am testing states that it takes an average of 3 days for your stock pick to reach 1% gains... we'll see how it goes.
