      Much as I would like to post little arbitrary observations on the many uninteresting events that happened today... the need to sleep is getting the better of me and I'm just not in the fucking mood to defy my brain's biological impulses...

      Okay... so from the very first day I've been keeping this blog, I've posted nothing but crap with no relevance whatsoever to the going ons in my day to day life.   SO?   Okay.... I'll start with a little bit about what went on last night leading to this moment with me sitting in front of my comp.   Went to orchard road to pass a book to a friend.  urlLink   Some book about Nirvana I bought as a stoned, straggly haired kid back in secondary school... Met up with an ex-colleague/friend, Gavin at Spinelli's... Headed down to The Wine Network @ Dempsey Road with a couple of other guys... Had this REALLY good Chilean Cab/Merlot that only set us back about 20 odd dollars?? Then off to Zouk to meet up with Farty and some other guys. Had a ball at the coffeeshop opp. Zouk. Went to winebar after getting loaded up on beer at the coffeeshop... followed by vodka, sex on the beach and blinding white lights... Scarlet red pineapples and white plumed birdies...... LA LA LA...   FUCKs... I HATE blogging... Think I'm just gonna stick with posting CRAP!!!! HAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!   Mi nalgas est√° peluda y el pene es largo!

      They All Laughed Lyrics: Ira Gershwin Music:George Gershwin  The odds were a hundred to one against me The world thought the heights were too high to climb But people from Missouri never incensed me Oh, I wasn't a bit concerned For from hist'ry I had learned How many, many times the worm had turned  They all laughed at Christopher Columbus When he said the world was round They all laughed when Edison recorded sound They all laughed at Wilbur and his brother When they said that man could fly  They told Marconi Wireless was a phony It's the same old cry They laughed at me wanting you Said I was reaching for the moon But oh, you came through Now they'll have to change their tune  They all said we never could be happy They laughed at us and how! But ho, ho, ho! Who's got the last laugh now?  They all laughed at Rockefeller Center Now they're fighting to get in They all laughed at Whitney and his cotton gin They all laughed at Fulton and his steamboat Hershey and his chocolate bar  Ford and his Lizzie Kept the laughers busy That's how people are They laughed at me wanting you Said it would be, "Hello, Goodbye." But oh, you came through Now they're eating humble pie  They all said we'd never get together Darling, let's take a bow For ho, ho, ho! Who's got the last laugh? Hee, hee, hee! Let's at the past laugh Ha, ha, ha! Who's got the last laugh now?"

      Damnations... Curses... Woke up late this morning. Thought I'd blog about some of the rather unusual events that transpired the past 2 weeks, but that'll have to wait another day la. For now, let me amuse you by posting this rather interesting anecdote with me as one of its much feared protagonists... Note that I have taken the liberty of changing some names from the original text.  Enjoy.  It had been a hazardous trial to get to this point. Wounded all over his body, burned, and burning inside from poison and his own demonic blood, Stiffy arrives at the Shogun's private chambers, the large doors to the room shut tight, as if it could keep this intruder out. Hardly. Coughing from the previous smoke bomb, Stiffy wipes his teared-up eyes and takes only a moment to compose himself, reaching into his haori to see that the Messenger's note was still there. It was, though slightly bloodstained. Then... This was all that was left. Pausing only a second to take a breath, Stiffy goes to open the massive doors to the chambers, locked or no, using his demonic strength to do such a task.  At the far end of the room, a lone figure seated at the far end of the room slowly raises his head. Stern, composed, the Shogun watches silently as the bloodstained figure shoves the massive door open. Every inch the proud ruler of Eyoto, he kneels at the end of the spacious room alone, a sheathed katana resting in the ground in front of him. Determined to face this threat, it seems, as befits a ruler -- fighting with his own two hands.  Stiffy enters the room silently, his eyes on the figure seated on the other side, shutting the massive doors behind him. He stands there, back to the closed doors, silently letting his eyes run over the figure of the Shogun. A man he'd never seen before. A man he knew nothing about. A man he was here to kill. His green eyes fall on the katana. So he intends to fight... The nekomata doubts the man is close to the skill of those whom he had fought previously... A ruler would not have the time to train to the extent, so likely, his skills are hardly a challenge... But for a man who has to die by the hands of this one, for no personal offense... Stiffy would not deny this man an honorable death, if it is his choice. His moment of contemplation ends, and the nekomata stalks towards the Shogun, the demonic claws shifting in the dim light.  "So... " the Shogun speaks, his voice low but proud. "You have come here seeking my life. For what purpose?" The question asked proudly, with no attempt to wheedle or cajole. A demand -- demanding to know for what reason this intruder comes seeking his life.  For what... purpose? Stiffy does not answer at first, considering not answering at all. However... he is compelled to speak. In a voice much softer and gentler than how he appears, he says, "In order to save the life of my only daughter and the life of my only love, I am to take your life tonight." What more does he need to say? Perhaps... "I hold no hate for you... more, I am grateful for the prosperity and confidence you have given the people of this country. However," he says, turning slightly, "At this time there are forces at work which no man, human or demon, can hope to stop. I am bound to this dark fate as much as you are."   " ...even if all of that is true," the Shogun says slowly, rising up from his knees to his feet, leaving his sword on the ground, "I cannot simply stand by and let you have your way... "  Stiffy nods slightly, saying, "If you did, your people's respect for you would be unfounded, and I would have no regrets in taking your life." He shifts easily into a slight fighting stance, his posture relaxed... waiting.  "Then you will also understand," the Shogun replies calmly, "that we who serve the Shogun cannot allow such a thing either." A solid *thud* suddenly sounds from the door behind Stiffy -- being barred and reinforced from the other side; like-sounding *thud*s sounding from the room's other exits, the portals likewise being barred and reinforced, sealing them in. "Even at the cost of our own lives," the ruler adds, his voice suddenly completely different, turning dark and smooth -- he bows his head as he raises his hands, hands clenching to forcefully tear off his garb -- and his FACE! The costume falls away in tatters, revealing a dark uniform with the arms banded in stripes and capped in gauntlets, head raising... to reveal the gleaming white of a porcelain grinning demon's mask! "Oniwabanshuu onmitsu Hanya desu," he declares, walking calmly towards the nekomata. "And your mission of assassination ends here."  It would be a lie to say that Stiffy was caught completely unaware by this. He did not doubt that the true Shogun had been taken to a safer location, but he could not let his guard down-- nor could he simply lie-- when faced with the false Shogun. The sound of his being sealed into this room do not cause him worry... if need be, he will make his own door.   Watching Hanya aproach, Stiffy takes in his opponent. There is obvious strength and power, and the man's control over his muscles, his movements so finely tuned, the nekomata does not doubt his power rivals-- perhaps is even more-- than Stiffy's own. However... Once again, he cannot be swayed from his task. And thus, he feels the need to use his only trump card.. perhaps it is reckless, but time is running out. If there is a chance....  "More than once Misao has mentioned you," Stiffy says quietly, softly. "And I do not doubt that her love and respect for you is in any way unfounded... and it would sadden me greatly should your demise be at my own bloodied hands. However... The thought of her death being at my hands is a pain that I cannot bear." The nekomata looks up at his opponent as he approaches. "If I cannot complete my task, Oniwabanshuu onmitsu Hanya, then Misao-san will surely die, along with my daughter." Stiffy's voice chokes up slightly at the last part, and the demon grits his teeth. This is not the time to lose your focus and sink into a depression, he tells himself, the time for tears is later.   Hanya pauses at that, eyes behind the mask watching you for a long moment. "I know that you are friends with Misao-san," he remarks. "And this name could easily be a ploy... but I can see that you are not lying. I can see the grief this causes you. However... " He slowly settles into a fighting stance, his fists held at the ready. " ...Misao-san is one of us. As a member of the Oniwabanshuu, she understands the duty we have. I could not face either her or the Okashira if I were to throw aside my duty for the sake of her name. Also, should you succeed, this entire country will be thrown into chaos. The life of one person cannot be traded for the well-being of a country... this, too, the Oniwabanshuu understand. Thus are our lives forfeit, when our Shogun is threatened."  Stiffy drops fully into his own fighting stance as Hanya does the same. "You are correct... for one life, and one so dedicated to defending this country, this crime could not be allowed to happen. However," He says, raising one hand, lengthening the claws to almost a foot long each, "It is not one life that rests upon the completion of this task, but two. Misao-san... she is the one I love most dearly, but my daughter is the only one in this land who returns my love... she is yet to start living her life, and to have it taken so violently by the blade of my most hated enemy... this is something that I cannot allow to happen, even for the sake of this country." Stiffy swallows deeply, then says, "We both fight for what is the most important in our lives, so neither of us are wrong in what we fight for." That said, Stiffy waits for Hanya to make the first move.  "Indeed." Hanya strikes his fists together, metal ringing muffledly beneath the leather of his gauntlets. "Before we begin, young man, may I ask your name... ?" Stiffy drops back into a fighting stance, the ghost-like invisible claw forming around his fingers once again. "My name...?" Why does it matter, anyway? ".....  Smelly Stiffy " he says quietly.

      OH MY GOD!!! I miss her so much!!! And I just saw her this morning...  Okay... hmmm..   Here's something weird, collecting her warm-red hued Mango tube top (very certain she's gonna blog about it.. haha) from the alteration lady's was a strangely comforting experience... holding the soft 95% Viscose/5% Elasthane fabric in my hands somehow reminds me a lil' bit of her. (even if she never wore it 'cept for the short 2 mintutes she had it on while trying it out.) Just came back from lunch... messaged her how much I miss her and trying really hard not to call her 'cause I wanna let her sleep.   Anyways... Here are some pics we took at heineken. (Blog in process.)   urlLink    Hot Chicks!&nbsp; urlLink      urlLink    Hottest Chick!&nbsp; urlLink
