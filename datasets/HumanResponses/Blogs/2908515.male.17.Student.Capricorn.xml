      "Thank you, have a nice day."  Its my last week of work.  I'm pretty excited.  And a bit sad because I have had so many good experiences there.  It's so cool.  1.) A female coworker was hitting on me.  It was cool.  She was about 20-something.  I was talking to her on my break and she asked me if I wanted to buy her lunch or something.  I didn't know what to say really because I didn't feel interested in her in anyway.  I just kinda stammered and made a silly excuse in which another coworker came and saved the day.  After that, we just became friends.  We talk a lot and I did have lunch with her oneday.  It was a lot of fun.  2.) Jonee goes to our school.  She's a cool kid.  I like talking to her too.  3.) DISCOUNTS+++.  I bought my uber cool MP3/Radio/CD player there.  And a few CD's.  And a few video games.  Discounted.  Which was cool.  Oh yea, I also bought some food there too.  4.) Hm...A guy hit a on me.  That was interesting.  But I was not in the mood for some ice cream with him so I declined.  5.) A couple of nights ago, two lesbians came into my lane with stuff.  I was checking them out when one of them said, "I don't know why we have to use condoms.  Aren't we lesbians?  Why do we need condoms."  "Shh...you'll corrupt the poor kid."  "Don't worry, he's probably seen tons of lesbians, right kid?"  Yea, it was interesting.  And then when they were done,   "Don't mind her, dear.  She's not too tightly wrapped."  "Yea, and you're vagina isn't too tight anymore either."  Too much information, right?  Well, anyway I think there were women condoms.  There's such a thing, right?  6.) $$$$+++.  I finally have a MAC card, which is pretty hot.  And money to go with my MAC card.  Which Alex Manzi is so jealous of, even if he makes fun of me for it. "Oooo...look at Dennis with his MAC card and his memorization of his Social Security number.  With his driver's liscense.  OO....isn't he so cool?"  7.) MISC, ETC, whatever.  I need to find a new job.  Who wants to come with me.

      I should be doing my homework right now but I'm currently in a state that forbids me of any feeling resembling "worry" about homework.  It's just the dumb packet for Kobyrinski.  I think I am like a rollarcoaster fueled by overthinking.    It seems that more and more, I am in a world my own.  Not really paying attention to the things going on around me and acting strange to people.  I analyze things people do and things they don't.  I'll ask myself that if I had done this, would people like me better?  I'll get pissed off at people for things I would never normally get pissed off at.  I'll see things differently.  One minute I'll feel sorta happy and the next minute, I'll feel angsty and against the world in general.  I am never directly mad at people, just generally mad at people.  Although sometimes I'll single people out, it doesn't mean that I hate them.  Just means that I am annoyed by what they did, or did not do.  I don't want to go to a couple of classes tomorrow.  Maybe I'll skip.  But I can't really skip any classes.  All of them are important and the periods in which I have idle classes, I'm already in orchestra.  Well, except for 9th period.  I guess I can skip that.  I don't know.  I think I worry about what people think of me too much.  I should worry less about that.  Some people will always be better than me.  And I will have to accept that.  I guess.    I guess about a lot of things.  And I don't know about a lot of things either.  It just is.  And there's nothing I can do about it.  I think I need a hobby.  Or some courage to confide in people.  pfft, who reads this anyway.

      I feel kinda happy today.  Among other things with people, I feel that I am getting along with people around me.  Although I seem like a jerk sometimes, I don't mean to be.  I have the best of intentions in mind, just that its me and I tend to do weird things.   Today after school, I drove myself to Barnes and Nobles and got myself two books.  One was about the history of the three scientist that developed the Atomic Bomb.  The other one was the book that Ben sorta recommended.  That Japanese author.  Its a good book so far but I'm focusing more on my other books right now.  Thats about it today.  I am happy.  That is good.

      Well, upon the matter of my leaving, its had nothing to do with you.  I'm just at a point in my life where everything I do is pointless (heh) and that I can't find the joy of stuff anymore.  I mean, I pick up a video game and ready to have fun and whatnot but all I do is press buttons randomly hoping for a good outcome.  I pick up my pencil read to do some math homework but all I get is confused by the buttons of the calculator.  I have the phone in my hand and I'm ready to call some of my friends but I just don't for some odd reason.  Maybe I should take a break.  I mean, there are a couple of things that I still like to do.  For instance, I still like to talk to you.  You're a cool guy, no matter what you say.  I still like to take walks (but since there's no one to walk with me, I seldom do).  I like to cook (but since I have not the time)  I dunno.  I don't have such an active social life as you think.  Its funny how your e-mail came to me today.  I thought I had an okay social life yesterday.  But after today, I just realized that I don't.  Well, not just today, I had a feeling that I wasn't the most socially active person for a long time now.  I found out that some of my friends are going to baseball games and concerts without ever once thinking of inviting me.  Even though all of my efforts in the past where to include everyone I could think of in my outings.  Yet, no one mentions a concert that I would like to attend.  No one would even think of asking me.  I think it has to do with an incident a couple of years ago when someone asked me to go to a concert and I made some lame excuse not to go because I didn't have the money back then and I never like to borrow money from my parents.  I made some lame excuse like, "I don't like concerts" or something like that.  And I guess they still believe that and don't even bother to invite me to anymore.  Sometimes thinking about it, it almost makes me tear up.  Its not even something so superficial as going to a concert.  I just want to be talked to and invited to things like I invited other people to things.  And there are a couple of concerts that I would love to go to but no one would go with me because they're too busy doing other things.  Today was just mentally exhausting.  After having been slapped in the face by the fact that I was excluded from such trivial yet important things like concerts and baseball games, I get slapped in the face again for being average in every single thing I do.  I hate whining to people.  But this has just been bugging me.  I'm not the smartest person in the class.  I'm not the greatest violinist in the orchestra.  I wasn't the fastest soccer player.  I'm not the best of anything.  Just average or slightly above.  But whats worse is that sometimes I grow to hate the people who are better than me.  Maybe not hate, but feel intensely jealous.  And that really sucks because thats a bad feeling.  Then I connect the state of being average to my problem with not being invited to places.  Then I think that maybe because of me being just a regular person that no one really takes notice of me enough to take me places.   I don't think I've had arguements with my friends.  But I can just never have a good conversation with them anymore.  Its not their fault but whenver I talk to them, they'll tell me about the stuff they do all the time.  Like how they need a new drum set because their band is doing a gig at some place.  Or how this person went to a tri-county whatnot with their orchestra.  I mean, I feel happy for them and stuff but I just feel left out.  Why can't I be in those things?  Oh wait, I know, because I'm insanely average.  Fuck.  Its not like I want to keep things from you.  So far, I've been honest and open.  I wouldn't decline any question directed towards me.  I don't think you're going to molest me (nerds aren't strong, right?)  Just kidding.  I'm just over-thinking things and being anal about everything (for a lack of a better phrase).  Popularity escapes my grasp, but yet it is so close that I can touch it sometimes.  It'll be cool to meet sometime.  It wouldn't be bad because we could meet again some other time after the initial meet.  I mean, its not like right after our meeting one of us will go off into war and never been heard from again.  I know that our meeting will not be bad because I know that we will continue to talk again.  Even if not through chat, then through e-mail.  I once had a penpal (online penpal) from Germany.  This nice girl about my age when I was about 13 or 14 years old.  We used to exchange e-mail letters everyday without fail.  She was so human.  She had flaws and she had strengths.  We had so many conversations and I learned so much stuff about Germany.  German word and phrases and foods.  But at the end of our time exchanging e-mail, something happened to her.  She was sent to the hospital for some sort of testing.  And I never really heard from her again.  I felt so bad and lonely.  You know?  All this time, two years or so, we spent e-mailing each other, and for her to just cut off so suddenly without a goodbye or anything, it just broke me.  And to think it, we never even chatted real time.  There was no IM'ing.  But it just ruined me.    The moral.  Well, not really a moral.  More of a transitition to this paragraph.  Matt.  If we are to continue talking, then you should some sort of promise or pact or whatever that you won't disappear to Japan without a goodbye or if not a goodbye then a pact/promise/whatever that you'll still continue writing.  The little girl in Germany managed to write to the little boy in America.  You could do the same in Japan.  I don't know what the future holds and I don't expect that much from the future.  Maybe we will meet.  And maybe not.  I sure hope we do.  I like to meet the person who is responsible for keeping me from so many assignements, papers, projects, and masturbation sessions.  Yea, too much information, I know.  The last one was for ha'ha's.  Anyway.  I'm going to Tahiti no matter what.  Its your choice whether or not you want to come with me.  The end.  Dennis.

      I was talking to a person about soulmates and it really got me thinking.  I go through life, school, and I see that there are so many people who have someone that they can rely on.  Someone that stands by them no matter what.  And someone that they do stuff with.  Its not even a boy/girlfriend sort of thing because those things I am not really worried about.  Its just the matter of a friend that I can confide in.  I mean, not to sound angsty, but there is no one for me.    Maybe its me.  Maybe I'm a complete and utter jackass that no one likes or no one can really see themselves getting close to.  I'm not an open person, I don't embrace people at the drop of a hat.  I don't even like to touch people that much.  Or have people touch me.  But that doesn't really matter.  Maybe I joke too much and people find me superficial, unreal.  I never tell anyone my problems, well, not usually.  I never open up, you know?  I'm just me to people and nothing more.  Just skins and bones.  I blamed my father for my lack of a confidante.  He hates my friends and never approves of them.  My mother never talks to my friends and it makes me feel that I have bad friends, which I don't.  I think I have awesome friends, but sometimes something is nagging at the back of my mind.  My parents tell me never to trust anyone and that all I have is my family.  Well, I don't like my family all that much.  I am not close to my brothers.  I am not close to my mother or my father.  I don't tell them my feelings or my problems because I can't find the right words and I always think that they would just belittle me or not really care about my problems at all.  I mean, what kind of person has such dumb problems?  A dumb person, thats who.  Anyway, I have never given many people my trust.  Eh, don't know why.  Maybe its because of my parents and maybe its because of me.  Or maybe its because of something that is out of my control.  Maybe I haven't met anyone worthwhile to spill my secrets to.  I mean, I'm only 17 and where am I?  I'm in a life that I did not choose to be in.  I don't have my freedom yet.  My dad still controls my hair.  He controls what I wear to some extent.  Maybe when I am able go on my own that will I find new people.  Or maybe the thought of soulmates is entirely fictional.  Another person that was made that can understand me.  Far-fetched.  Optimistic.  Too good to be true.  Is it too good to be true.  Am I just chasing an idea that is not real?  A fruitless search for gold?  But then why do other people have soulmates?  How do they have soulmates?  How do they have someone else that knows exactly what movie they like?  How?  Or maybe its just all a trick.  No one is really truely friends with anyone else.  Or that I'm asking way too much for something that shouldn't be asked for.  Whatever.

      I don't know why I blow off my obligations, my friends, and my interests to spend time with my family, espeically with my father.  Pat had invited me to see Hot Shots 2 or something but I declined to spend time with my family.  You know, there's only so much family to go around but tons of friends.  But sometimes I feel that I don't have friends either, but thats another story.  Anyway, my mother wanted to go to the mall.  But I disliked going to a place without a reason.  If I go to the mall, its to do something.  To buy something or to look for something.  But when I go with my family, there's really never a reason to go and we'll just walk aimlessly around, slowly, conversationallessly.  If thats a word.  It feels like I'm wasting my time.  Even if we didn't buy something, talking would be nice.  But I can't find anything to talk to them about.  They're just strangers to me.  And thats really sad.  I don't know.    We bought some pretzels.  Not some pretzels.  More like six.  And I wasn't hungry at all.  I didn't have anything today except for pretzels and some ice cream.  I feel so sick.    My mother wanted to see a movie.  But I told her that maybe she should go alone with my father since their movies aren't really suitable for kids to watch and I wanted to see those movies too with my parents.  But I know that I would be stuck watching the kids in some lame ass movie like Scooby Doo or something.  But she insisted that we should all go to the mall anyway.  So we're at the mall and my mother suggests we go to the movies now.  My father was obnoxious and blurts out, "Why, there's nothing good out."  I think that totally killed my mother's mood.  I felt a change in atmosphere and I knew that he said something bad.  And I totally agreed with my mother although I didn't help much by saying that she should have just left us at home and went out to see a movie with my father.  What I really wanted to say was that my father should go fucking home and do whatever and the whole family minus my father go watch a fucking movie.  You never know hypocrisy until you're yelled at for being a bum from a bum.  Namely my father.  He yells at me far too much about my flaws.  How I'm not a super student.  How I'm lazy.  How I like odd stuff.  How I'm nothing like him.  How I have dumb friends.  How much I suck in general.  And it makes me so sad.  Because it feels like he doesn't love me, or that he loves me because he has to.  If he were to get a divorce with my parents, he would die.  He doesn't pay for his medicines, he doesn't have enough income for rent.  What's he to do?  Die.  Sometimes I wish that they would get a divorce.  So that my mom will be happier.  But I know that its selfish of me to wish that.  Because I would be happier than my mother.  Its for personal gains, and I guess thats what I qualify as selfish.  I wished I had never prevented their threat of divorce a few years back.  I wish I had kept my mouth shut when my parents were planning on divorce or maybe I should have encouraged it.  Whatever.

      I am now officially unemployed.  And it is the first thing that made me feel good this weekend.  Recap.  On Friday, I wanted to do something with people because of the recent actions in our school.  I just wanted to have fun because school is not nearly as fun anymore.  Not with the policemen and all.  Anyway, I assembled a crew fit for a king.  It was Alex, Ben, Ed and I.  I had not spoken to Ed in a long while and I feel bad sometimes for "ignoring" him either consciously or subconsciously.  I like Ben and Alex is cool too.  Although sometimes Alex seems inhuman because he doesn't get mad or sad or anything.  Or maybe I just don't see it.  Anyway, we went to the mall and walked around.  To make a long story short, I think going to the mall with those people was a bad mistake because I felt like the odd fourth wheel out.  The other three had things to talk about like marching band or some new video game or whatnot.  I'll chirp in a few times but...eh, I didn't get much conversation time.  I made some excuse so that Ed and Ben could go off to look for...Resident Evil soundtrack?  Or something.  At that point, I would have rathered hung out with Alex because he is easy to talk to.  I bought a megaman shirt at Hottopic.  Its really cool.  After that, we just went home.  I dropped the three of them at Ed's house after I made some shitty excuse about "I'm not too keen on going to people's houses" or "I have some other stuff I want to buy, I'm gonna be stopping at Gamestop or something".  In truth, I really didn't want to stay with them anymore, there wasn't anything to do.  And Ed has his car, he could drive them, not like he drives me anywhere.    But then, I shouldn't really complain. I shouldn't be telling or hinting at what he should or shouldn't do. Right?  ...  On Saturday, I went to my grandmother's grave with my brothers alone.  Since my parents are out of the state right now at another funeral.  It was raining.  It was dark, overcast.  What a wonderful day?  Well, I thought so until I locked my keys in my car.  Yup, keys in car, locked, in King O Prussia.  I waited about an hour and a half for my Aunt to come and pick me up after I left about five thousand messages on her answering machine.  Its times like this I wished I had a cellphone or something.  All of my car capable friends were out of town.  I thought about calling Ed but after last night at the mall, I didn't.  I need time to think about things.  Anyway, I got back home and got the key and went to the car again and drove home.  I called me work place to say I couldn't come in after I told them I locked me keys in the car.  All they said was, "Well, after you get your keys out, tell me what time you could come in."  I was a bit peeved at that because they apparently didn't care about me and wanted me to just come in and work for them as soon as possible.  Whatever, really.  It was my last day and I just did not come.  Fuck them, so to say.  So I went home and dawdled a bit online.  I still have to start the speech for social studies.  Saturday evening, I went out and bought three movies at Hollywood videos.  Bowling for Columbine made me think.  And it made me want to take some affirmitive action in some of the things I disagree with.  It motivated me.  Maybe I'll do something.  I don't know.  Went to Burger King with my brothers.  I felt guilty for eating a big ass whopper.  But whatever.  Sometimes in public places, I get the feeling that people glance at me.  Its strange in unnerving.  Sometimes in school, I feel that too.  Maybe its just me.   I went home and watched some movies.  Then went to bed.  This morning I woke up.  It was sunny outside and it definately made me feel better.  I'm unemployed and its sunny.  What more could I ask for?  Well, a lot more but thats not the point.  Enjoy every moment because the next moment will be different.  I hate Xangas that retell past events.  No one cares.  But in this case, thats the only thing that I could think of putting in this entry.  I'll try to end with some of my thoughts on stuff.  I guess.  Sometimes I feel very lonely because I do not have a person in which I could share an interest exclusively.  It bothers me to be a fox and know a little about a lot, so to say.  Well not really, but something like that.  I'm not a huge music fan but I like music.  I'm not a huge violin player (or particulary any good) but I like violin.  I'm not a huge hacky sacker but I like hacky sack.  I am not too well versed in doing some sort of hobby, but I find it interesting.  But I keep finding people left and right that have one sort of thing that they're keen on.  Some sort of hobby, craft, whatever, that they do all the time.  And they talk to other people about that interest, hobby, craft or whatever.  But when I try to do that, I can only talk about it for so long until I lose interest or I don't know anymore about that subject.  There are a few people in which I can talk to about anything in the world.  A few really.  And thats pretty cool.  But I can't help it sometimes to speak to another person about stuff too.  You know, to get a third or fourth point of view on things.    I don't know.  Whatever.

      I love driving in the car with the window down.  The wind is all in my hair and it feels cool.  I like to put my hand out and waggle in the wind.  And I like driving too.  And thats what I've been doing the past few days.  I've been driving to work with the windows down because its been so nice outside.  I love it.  It makes me feel happy.  In other news, nothing is really going on in my life.  Sometimes I think that I have reached a point in my orchestratal career that I don't seem to be progressing anymore.  I practice and practice but it doesn't seem to do anything.  Or maybe I'm not concentrating.  Oh well.  Maybe a bit more practice would help.  It couldn't hurt, right?  This coming Sunday is my first Sunday off.  Well, its because I'll be jobless on Sunday.  But fortunately, unfortunately, I have that orchestra thingy art auction thingy.  I'll be busy.  And I just wanted to relax too.  But I'll have fun playing and thats cool too.  Maybe next weekend I'll be free and able to relax and such.  I dunno, I had this nice thought-provoking post I wanted to post last night after I watched WonderBoys.  That is such a good movie.  But I forgot what I was going to put down.  So whatever.  It's gone to waste.  And so has this space of the Internet.  Yup, a waste of virtual space.

      Yesterday, while I was driving around town looking for people to talk to, I came upon Mrs. O'Brien.  I had always thought that Kevin's mother was scary and that I will not have that much to talk to her about.  You know, one of those feelings one gets from an adult that one isn't too sure of.  She scared me as an overly sarcastic person as well as a critical person too.  When she said once "Oh, look at Dennis driving.  Isn't he so cool?" it was weird.  Also, whenever I needed a ride from any place in the past, I heard Kevin re-enact his mother with an exasperated tone such as "Fine, we'll drive him home." and I always felt like a burden and bad for not having a ride in the first place.  But anyway, as I was travelling around, trying to get my little brother to sleep, I decided that it wouldn't hurt to give Kevin a visit.  Well, Kevin was out with his father shopping or something and Mrs. O'brien and C.J. were the only ones home.  C.J. was funny.  Funny kid.  Anyway, Mrs. O'brien inquired why I wasn't at the prom.  Well, I've been telling people that I couldn't go because my parents weren't home.  And I left it at that.  Well, "Where are your parents?"  They were in California. "Why?" My mother is going to work there for three months.  My father just went over to help her get settled. "Oh."  Yea, my mother has half a mind to move there.  "Oh, thats too bad.  Dennis, you're not allowed to move."  Well, I told my mom that.  If we do move then I'm not moving.  I'm staying here because this is where my life is.  "I understand.  I like it here too."  Blah blah blah.  "You know Dennis, if anything I think you'll have no trouble finding people to stay with if you parents move.  I mean, it'll only be a few months as you're gonna just finish your high school year.  I'm sure there are many people who would be happy to have you with them."  Yea, I might live with my Aunt if we do move although I don't like her that much.  C.J. said something like, "He could stay in our basement."    "Yea, we just cleaned it out" said Mrs. O'brien. "It'll only be for a few months.  You're not allowed to move across the country."  Well, I said something about it being weird to live with my friends.  The relationship with my friend once I move in with them would grow on a more personal level and some parts of that makes me uncomfortable.  I barely have any personal relationship with my family as it is now, I don't know if I would be too willing to have a personal relationship with any of my friends.  By which i mean, with all of my friends I have a good relationship.  With some of them, I can trust them with my secrets and vice versa.  But if I do live with them, I'm sure they'll know all of my secrets which makes me feel defenseless, you know?  Its like when we were kids and we had a "secret place" where no one knew about.  Were our imaginary friends resided and we had all the time in the world to do whatever and catch bad guys.  I think secrets are like this "secret place".  Once I share it with someone, it'll no longer be a secret place.  It'll be a shared place.  Which is entirely different.  But I'm sure it won't be too bad.  I hope that didn't sound too offensive to anyone.  Seriously.  Anyway, I don't know if my mother would want to move anyway.  I don't think she would.  She likes this house too much.  But what Mrs. O'brien said to me, it made me feel good and wanted.  I had always had a kind of aversion to her, but now its almost completely gone and in its wake is the warmth of acceptence.  Well, maybe not acceptence or anything like that, but its a nice feeling nonetheless.  So I stopped worrying about the future.  What will be will be.  And if worse comes to worse, I'll have one good option to look into.  I don't care what Kevin says, his mother has the final ruling.  Ha.   Other than that, nothing much.  The book I'm reading right now is titled Complications by Atul Gawande.  I have a feeling he's Indian.  Anyway, its such an interesting book.  You know how sometimes mystery novels or action novels make your heart race and you want to read as fast as possible to find out what happens?  This book is like that only that its non-fiction.  Dr. Gawande describes how his first day of Residence went.  He had to place a line in a large aretery near the heart using a huge needle through the chest.  The specifics aren't clear or understood by me but I got the general gist.  Anyway, it was nerve wrecking for me but more so for him.  He had to hold a large needle and drive it in a patient's chest and draw blood to confirm he was in the right place.  He had no x-ray to guide him.  He only had a demostration earlier.  He utlimately failed and his supervisor took over.  However, he does bring up a good point:  Medicine is a Practice.  Nothing in medicine is book regulated and perfect.  Its mostly a guess then check.  When a person is wheeled into an emergency room, the doctor doesn't have enough time to go to a text book and check what he should do.  The doctor has to act now to stablize the patient then check to see if he did the right thing.  If not, fix it or learn from it.  A real good quote for doctors, especially surgeons: "You can be wrong, but never be undecisive."  Although I'm not halfway through the book yet, it just confirms why I think Medicine is such a wonderful area.  Its the action and the adrenaline that makes it so worthwhile.  And its the gratitude of the patients that makes it sweet.  I'll read more and tell you what I think.  Thats all for now, I guess.  I don't think I have anything more to say.  Oh yea, I took $60 from my mother.  I don't think she minds.  She did ruin my Junior Prom night.  I do love her though.  My dad just remembered that I'm going out tomorrow night to see bands and he offered to pay for it.  I told him that I already did years ago and he said he'll pay me back.  I told him it was okay.  I kinda felt guilty for taking out $60 from my mother, but I'm sure she knows already since I did tell her that I was going to.  Hmm...whats a teenager to do with $60?  Maybe I'll by some weed.    Nah, maybe a good CD.  Happy Trails.

       Try as I might, I have not expelled anything out of the rectum that is Xanga.&nbsp; After seeing High Fidelity with Charlotte, I have decided to create a list of my own.&nbsp; A list of worries.   1.) My social studies Final.&nbsp; What am I going to do?&nbsp; How will I do it?&nbsp; Where will I gather my research?&nbsp; These questions have plagued me so.&nbsp; But I think I have it down.&nbsp; I shouldn't worry so much about this, but since it is due in a week, I have put it as my number one concern for the moment.   2.) I guess I've beat this subject down to a bloody pulp, especially with Charlotte upon such matters, I have to jot this down incase I lose it.&nbsp; What will I get for my esteemed Matty.&nbsp; For a going away present.&nbsp; I presented him with my idea of getting him something.&nbsp; I asked him what he wanted or needed for his voyage to the known (as opposed to unknown).&nbsp; He took my suggestion and threw it away.&nbsp; We argued for some time.&nbsp; He did not want me to get him anything.&nbsp; And I'm a stubborn nice jerkface who cannot be told otherwise.&nbsp; "Why are you fighting me?" and so forth, "All I want are memories." and the usual, "I'll take your gift and give it back to you, I won't accept it.".&nbsp; What am I to do?   I have decided upon one article in my gift montage.&nbsp; Charlotte had told me to give him something special, something new, and something of mine.(actually, I don't&nbsp;know if&nbsp;Charlotte actually&nbsp;told me those things, but I will credit/blame&nbsp;her for them anyway.&nbsp; I have a lousy memory!)&nbsp; I already have the something special and something of mine, I just need the something new.&nbsp; And I think I have decided.&nbsp; I will buy him  Peter Pan by J.M. Barrie .&nbsp; The reason for this is that our relationship is based upon the idea that we want to fly away to some place other than here.&nbsp; Bora Bora, to be exact.&nbsp; It's also based upon the principle that we shall never forget.&nbsp; Wendy never forgot Peter, I think.   It's been too long since I've read the book, but I will buy it for him.&nbsp; In hardcover, if possible.&nbsp; Anyone want to take a trip to the mall with me?   3.) I need to get a job.&nbsp; My money is fast dwindling and pretty soon I will be left nothing but the money I need to spend on car insurance and various other payments.&nbsp; It seems my childhood has left me.&nbsp; An allusion to Peter Pan.   4.) My grades.&nbsp; I need to bring my English grades up.&nbsp; I don't know how to fix it.&nbsp; We don't get anything.&nbsp; I am mad at the lack of learning and the lack of chances.&nbsp; What will colleges think?&nbsp; That I slacked off in that class? I hope not.&nbsp; Because I have not had anything to slack off on!&nbsp; No matter, I find it ironic that I have an extremely good grade in Social Studies, Ms. Kobyrinski's class, in which I complain (used to anyway) about how boring and bad it is.&nbsp; How Ms. K did not teach, yet I enjoy that class more.&nbsp; Chemistry is okay.&nbsp; I cannot wait until next year when my interest in chemical and bioligical science is tested.&nbsp; Maybe not a concern but a growing point inside my mind.   5. ) I don't know.&nbsp; I had a good one here but I seem to have forgotten it.&nbsp; Fine, I'll give one of my general concerns.&nbsp; What will happen tomorrow?&nbsp; The day after that?&nbsp; What will I be like when I'm 25?&nbsp; 35? 45?&nbsp; Will I be happy?&nbsp; Or will I be dead?&nbsp; Who will I still see?&nbsp; Who will I lose forever, lost in the sea of memories in which I cannot be sure if they really had existed or not or that am I just a prisoner of illusions here in my padded cell.    No matter.&nbsp; Life goes on.&nbsp; And one by one, I shall cross of each worry and smooth each wrinkle in my life until it is nothing short of perfection.&nbsp; Whenever that is.   Happy Trails.

       Okay, first thing's first.&nbsp; Good bye Bioluminesence.       Okay, next thing.&nbsp; Yesterday, celebration party for finishing the chem final.&nbsp; Yay.&nbsp; Here is the first picture.       This one isn't really such a big surprise.&nbsp; Just Biscombe and Charlotte fighting.&nbsp; Which one is winning?&nbsp; I bet you its me.&nbsp; YES, IN THAT WAY.       This isn't such a big surprise either.&nbsp; Lauren thinks she's cool.&nbsp; Too bad she doesn't eyes in the back of her head, that'll be way cooler, no?       More fighting?&nbsp; Hey, you can kinda see part of Ryan in this picture.&nbsp; Hey, he does exist.       They started doing each other's hair.&nbsp; This is Biscombe's famous hairdo done by the world famous Charlotte.       Charlotte's famous hairdo done by Burly Biscombe?       Done by the wonderful Becca, this is my hairdo.&nbsp; Of death.       Pat's semi-weird fluffy hairdo.&nbsp; Err...sweet.       I'm gonna leave you with the coolest picture I took all night.&nbsp; I have no idea how I did it.&nbsp; I think its that I took the camera away before it was done flashing or something.&nbsp; I want to recreate this but I guess it works better for artificial lights than natural light.&nbsp; Coolest picture...eva.   Happy Trails.

      My father's birthday is on July 4th.  I don't know what I am going to do for his birthday.  I am not a real big birthday-supporter.  Usually on my birthday, I try to lay as low as possible.  I try not to let anyone notice that it's January 3rd.  My parents know this now and just kinda acknowledge it.  However, my friends make a big celebration out of it.  Which is okay, but sometimes I would rather not.  I don't know why. *shrugs*  Soon, Matt is going to come over to my house.  Our 2nd meeting, this is going to be interesting.  "we're going to do some hardcore discussing and joke-telling and xanga-reading ;-)" in his exact words.  Which sounds cool.  I am looking forward to the hardcore discussing.  I would like to talk about these issues and get them over with.  Or at least I want to see his reactions when I'm saying the things I say because I have not seen his facial real time reactions before.  Concerning these things.    Matt also invited me to his house.  The date is unsure but I would like to have it on Monday since that would be more likely to happen.  I would really want to go over to his house.  You know what?  I would really want to spend time with him anyway possible.  Even if its doing something I hate.  Because I know I wouldn't hate it so bad.  I was really touched when he invited me.  He started out by saying "My parnets said I should invite someone over..." and I just thought,  Yea, he's going to go on one of his thinking outloud sessions about his life making me feel jealous or bad.   But it made me feel really good when he said that "zenzen0K (10:53:32 PM): i'm assuming you wouldn't want to, considering it'd be driving and also meeting my family" and then,  "zenzen0K (10:55:05 PM): really?  i would have just seen you.  and while that in no way bothers me ;-), you would have to drive 45 minutes" and then "zenzen0K (10:59:06 PM): since you'd be spending some of 4th of july weekend with me"  He makes me feel really good.  I didn't think I could go since that would be a far way driving and my parents are anti-far-ways.  I asked him to come down and pick me up.  Which i thought was asking too much so I don't know if this whole thing will be possible.  I really hope so.  This summer will be the best summer so far.  I am lucky to know Matt.

      I am talking to Matt about this blogger.    The reason that I set up this blogger was that I wanted a place where I didn't need to watch what I say.  A place where I could post anything and not have anyone raise questions.  Of course, in order to achieve this, I had to get rid of the very thing that made up a blog; the people who read it.  Which is pretty ironic, I think.  Anyway, I never privatized my entries or hid them.  I never really hid this blogger from anyone, I just placed it somewhere where they don't look too well.  Sometimes, I feel that it would be easier for my friends to find out about this blogger than it would to tell them.  Meaning that the reason why a person has a secret is that they are too afraid to tell anyone.  Well, certain secrets anyway.  I am really scared at my friend's reactions to these rants about them.  Some rants are anti-friends, anti-parents and whatnot.  Maybe when they read this, it would be easier.  I dont know.  Anyway, Matt, when you do read this, I want you to know that I'm glad.  As you can see, I don't have any (at least I don't think so) entries about how I am anti-you.  When you pissed me off, I usually shrugged it off and sent you an e-mail.  That was my blogger entry.  It was.  I didn't reach for my blogger when things turned ugly.  I reached for my e-mail.  I always thought that I wanted an open relationship with you.  I could say anything I wanted and have it understood or at least accepted.  Call me crazy.    I am very glad that I had the chance to talk to you.  I think that you shall please your partner very much so.  Your partner is going to be very lucky and happy.  Maybe if I'm lucky, I could be that partner someday.  I will be very happy.  And very lucky.  But nevertheless, whatever the feature holds, I will be happy if you're happy.  Thanks for everything.

       urlLink Matt's Livejournal.   After our meeting yesterday we had a conversation about the topic that we have beaten to a bloody pulp.  It was about our relationship.  And its funny how both of us beat around the bush when we talk about it.  I really don't have a clear picture of his feelings towards me.  I never have the courage to ask.  But I know my feelings towards him.  Well, I think I do.  But I never have the courage to say it.  Maybe its an even-steven deal where I won't tell him in exact words how I feel until he tells me how he feels.  I think I like him.  I think he's one of the greatest people in the world that I have met.  I really don't know why he still talks to me.  He is so much better in almost everyway.  He gets high SAT scores.  He's going to Japan as an exchange student into one of the best Japanese schools.  The Emporer went there.  He has this and that.  Yet, he still talks to me.  And I think he still expresses ideas that he is interested in me.  But why?  He can find so many other people that are better than me.  Richer, smarter, quicker, wittier, more awesome, better violinists, better conversationalist.  Its weird how he still talks to me.  For whatever reason.  Or maybe he's doing this until he leaves and in which he'll never speak to me again.  I don't know which would be worse; him not speaking to me now or him not speaking to me when he leaves.  Both are pretty bad.  I don't know.  Its all very complicated.  And sometimes I wish I didn't beat around the bush as much.  Sometimes I wish I had enough courage to just dive to the heart of the matter and end it right then.    The whole day that we spent together, I felt that I was being so boring.  He said afterwards online that I was a different person in real life than I am online.  I don't know if he was saying that he liked my online personality more or something else.  All he has seen thus far is my online personality.  This was the first time we met.  And it was so scary.  Stressful.  Maybe we should meet again and talk about these issues in person.  It'll be more stressful but things will be solved.  What do I want?  I don't know.  Wha tdo I expect?  I don't know.  I don't know anything and that bothers me.

        urlLink Pictures of Biscombe's Going away Party.    Today I went to the mall with Matt.&nbsp; It was hard to set up since we don't live so close to each other.&nbsp; We have planned this for a long time.&nbsp; It was good to see each other.&nbsp; Most of the time, we just walked around and chatted about stuff.   It was funny.&nbsp; When Matt and I were walking in this one part of the mall, this Asian lady stopped me specifically and asked me for directions to a pizza place in the plaza.&nbsp; It was funny because she totally ignored Matt who was a white guy and went for me probably for my asian-ness.&nbsp; I guess Matt kinda felt weirded out by the whole thing.      urlLink PICTURE.

       Friday, June 4th, 2004.&nbsp; Kevin, Charlotte, and I decided to reward ourselves with a most deserved early dismissal.&nbsp; We walked off the campus of our most prized high school using the awesome door in the orchestra room.&nbsp; And we drove to Kevin's house were we did the crappiest/dorkiest/dumbest/most enjoyable thing ever: We played scrabble.&nbsp; And had chocolate milk.&nbsp; And had stale tortilla chips.&nbsp;    Afterwards, we went to my house, Kevin made plans to go to a concert.&nbsp; The train would not come.&nbsp; We waited for about thirty minutes.&nbsp; And so I decided to go on an adventure of awesome proportions. (teehee).&nbsp; I decided to drive Charlotte and Kevin to Philadelphia so that Kevin could attend his concert.&nbsp; Note: it was my first time into Philadelphia.   Well, the trip went well.&nbsp; No hitches.&nbsp; It was easy, I'll say.&nbsp; And my two companions were treated to an enjoyable ride.&nbsp; Well, my rides are always enjoyable.&nbsp; Because I'm a fun driver.&nbsp; Although scary sometimes.    The Trip Pictures    And onward to the next section of Xanga Entry-ness.&nbsp; I shall copy both Lynne and Jemma and who ever else decided to do this.&nbsp; And I hope everyone else shall copy me.&nbsp; And so on and so forth.   Charlotte: You're a cool buddy.&nbsp; Although sometimes I can be moody/jerky I appreciate that you didn't totally run out or stop speaking to me.&nbsp; You're a good conversation.&nbsp; You're good advice.&nbsp; And you're someone that I feel that I can relate to and spill most of my beans too.   Kevin: You're pretty cool too.&nbsp; Although I didn't really start to talk to you until this year when we had that fateful 9th period together as well as those other classes together, I think that we get along pretty well.&nbsp; I like the conversations we have and the times we spent together.&nbsp; Most triumphant.   Jemma: You're someone I look up to.&nbsp; You have many good qualities that I say "Damn, I wish I had".&nbsp; You showed me the meaning of sarcasm, playful namecalling as well as the feel of tough skin.&nbsp; Go far.&nbsp; You will.   Lynne: I offically met you halfway through the school year.&nbsp; And at first when people were mentioning your name I had actually thought you as someone else with the same name.&nbsp; However, I soon discovered it was false.&nbsp; No matter, I think you're a pretty cool person too.&nbsp; I love to read your entries although most of the time, I don't have enough spunk to respond and comment.&nbsp; But no worries.&nbsp; Its good to meet someone with brains for once.&nbsp; You'll do well in your adventures.   Ben: You're an interesting thinker.&nbsp; And I like that.&nbsp; It was fun getting to know you this year.&nbsp; And I know next year is going to be greater.   Biscombe: I like your laughs.&nbsp; I like your "jokes" and stories.&nbsp; You're an awesome person.&nbsp; Although you really don't seem it, you're the smartest person I know.&nbsp; Well, the smartest person I would like to know. (Greg doesn't count because he's an ass).&nbsp; Anyway, it has been a swell year with you.&nbsp; Maybe during the summer, we could do something together.&nbsp; Or play scrabble online.&nbsp; I'll be looking forward to it.   Molly: How do warp engines work?&nbsp; Holodecks?&nbsp; I like our science conversations.&nbsp; Its awesome to know someone who can discuss nerdy/geeky stuff with.&nbsp; But thats not all you're known for.&nbsp; You're reasonable.&nbsp; You're hard working.&nbsp; I hope some of it rubs off on me.&nbsp; Especially the reasonable trait.&nbsp; :D   Becca: You're smart.&nbsp; But more importantly, you have common sense.&nbsp; I know many people several times your age in which I respect less.&nbsp; (you're still ten, right?)&nbsp; Keep up the good work.   Patty: You're the man.&nbsp; A great buddy as well as an awesome bash-thrower.&nbsp; Is there a more common sentence than "Party at Pat's tonight"?&nbsp; More than that, you're funny.&nbsp; Which goes well.&nbsp; And thus, may your life contain many parties as you work towards your goal.   I don't know anyone else.&nbsp; Well, maybe one more person.&nbsp; This person probably shaped this year the most for me.&nbsp; The most influencial.&nbsp; As much as I hate to admit it, my "voice of reason" (major eye-rollage).&nbsp; Although he will probably never read this (since I don't plan on giving him my Xanga address), I have to add him to the list of awesome people.   Matty: In quite possibly&nbsp;everyway possible, I love you.&nbsp; You're an asshole.&nbsp; You don't understand some of the stuff I put out.&nbsp; And I don't really understand the stuff you put out either.&nbsp; Sometimes I feel jealous of you.&nbsp; And I don't really believe why you would feel jealous of me.&nbsp; Your reasons for some stuff are quite "out-there" and totally disagreeable.   But you were there.&nbsp; You're a good conversationalist.&nbsp; You're always there to debunk an opinion and make me justify myself and my thinking, thus making me grow as a person.&nbsp; No longer am I the person with empty opinions.&nbsp; I have reasons for what I believe in.&nbsp; Thanks.&nbsp; Staying up late together and talking about whatever.&nbsp; I like the ultra-sappy mode you go into whenever you deem necessary, cheering me up.   I hate you.&nbsp; I hate you for going away.&nbsp; I hate you for something which I can't and won't hate you for.&nbsp; Its a mixed feeling sort of deal.&nbsp; Maybe its for the best.&nbsp; Maybe our friendship will be tested.&nbsp; I hope that our bond will never be broken.&nbsp; But if it is, I'll have the memories.&nbsp; I guess.&nbsp; But it won't come to that, I'm sure.&nbsp; We're going to see each other again when all this "college" business is over.&nbsp; And when we do, it will be good.&nbsp; We'll have ice cream.&nbsp; And go driving.   *sigh*.&nbsp;

      Yea, I just got two e-mails saying that I've been accepted into two summer programs at LaSalle University.  I'm really excited about those.  I think this summer is going to be one of the better summers so far.  Other than that, um...Matt's being an asshole.  I think I'm going to not talk to him for the weekend.  Then I'll see if he's still an asshole.  I think it would be cool if he came begging for me to talk to him since he usually says I have interesting viewpoints on everything.  And that I'm an awesome guy.  He's an awesome guy too but its like talking to myself, I'm such an asshole.  And he is too.  Mood rings.  Yup, thats what we need.  Only manly ones.  That are cool.  Maybe we'll see Harry Potter, that looks like a cool movie.

      I think my parents should realize that I can be a lot worse.&nbsp; I can do drugs and smoke and be a very bad son.&nbsp; I do my homework, I work hard.&nbsp; Yes, I am lazy.&nbsp; Yes, I don't always study.&nbsp; But thats on me, not them.&nbsp; Well, what I want to say is that I can be a lot worse.&nbsp; But I'm not.&nbsp; So they should cut me some slack.  I could wear all black and try to cut myself.&nbsp; I could bust a sag and listen to horrible music.&nbsp; I could just be really dumb.&nbsp; But I'm average.&nbsp; And I think thats okay most of the time.&nbsp; Of course, I do get dissappointed and sad when there's someone who is better than me at something which I care a lot about.&nbsp; But, thats life and I can't do anything about it, except work harder and try to be in their shoes someday.  I was thinking, what if I was given the chance to take a glimpse at the future.&nbsp; Would I take it?&nbsp; And I think that I wouldn't.&nbsp; It would ruin the surprise.&nbsp; So I was thinking that what if I took a glimpse but then I forgot about it.&nbsp; So that my curiosity would be satisfied but the surprise still held?&nbsp; I think thats impossible.&nbsp; Since&nbsp;it could have happened already.&nbsp; Some stranger probably asked me one day in the past if I wanted to see my future.&nbsp; And I said yes.&nbsp; And it was a good/okay future.&nbsp; Happy and junk.&nbsp; But then afterwards he wiped my memory so the future would come true.&nbsp; But then I'm here now wondering.&nbsp; So it didn't work.&nbsp;   I think what I really want is to be in that future.&nbsp; So that I couldn't make the future not happen.&nbsp; Since I'm already in it.&nbsp; You know?&nbsp; I want to know who I will end up with.&nbsp; Where I will live.&nbsp; What I will do?&nbsp; Stuff like that.  But I guess I have to wait.  Later.

      Today I called Mr. Laskey since he told me to call him on Monday at about 1:30 PM or so.&nbsp; Well, I called him at 2:10 PM because I was in the car with my parents and I didn't know when we were going to stop again.&nbsp; So I took out my cellphone and dialed his cellphone number.&nbsp; Well, when he picked up, he screamed and started yelling at something.&nbsp; I thought he was yelling at his kids or something.&nbsp; Something not so important.&nbsp; And there was silence.&nbsp; So I hung up.  Later when we stopped at Target, I called him again and I was informed that he just got into a car accident.&nbsp; I felt so bad.&nbsp; I thought I had caused it.&nbsp; But he assured me it wasn't my fault.&nbsp; I just had really bad timing.&nbsp; I just called to check that Thursday was still okay.&nbsp; Last Thursday, I stayed extra long to make up for the previous Thursday's absense.&nbsp; The previous Thrusday, Mr. Laskey didn't show up.&nbsp; He said that he lost my phone number so he couldn't have called me.&nbsp; So there I was at the high school and I was free for an hour.&nbsp; So I decided to go to the auditorium and play.  It was awesome.&nbsp; The acoustics in that room was steller.&nbsp;   Last Thursday, Mr. Laskey introduced me to another scale.&nbsp; This time, I went into seventh position.&nbsp; Sigh.&nbsp; Its really high.&nbsp; When it gets that high, I have a hard time remembering the note names.&nbsp; The notes pretty much only get recognized by the finger I use to play them.&nbsp; I should work on that.&nbsp; Especially with half and whole steps.&nbsp; Laskey also advanced me on the Viotti piece.&nbsp; Its pretty good.&nbsp; The way I was playing it before was different that the way he told me to play it.&nbsp; He told me to use third position on the A string.&nbsp; Which I guess makes more sense.&nbsp; Although my fourth finger G is always out of tune.&nbsp; My fourth finger is always out of tune for any note.  Biscombe came back.&nbsp; So she wants to have a get-together at her house on Friday.&nbsp; Of course I'm going.&nbsp; She's a cool kid.&nbsp; Plus, she said that she'll copy her calculus packet for me.&nbsp; Since I lost mine.&nbsp;   While I was cleaning my room, I found the LIST OF THINGS TO DO that Charlotte and I made in sophomore year.&nbsp; I think that was the time when we talked the most.&nbsp; Last year, we barely had any classes together.&nbsp; But we were closer.&nbsp; Maybe this year, we'll be both&nbsp;more talkative and closer to each other.&nbsp; She's a cool kid too, although she makes me mad sometimes.&nbsp; Especially when she's moody or dealing with another problem with Kevin.  Speaking of Kevin.&nbsp; He gets me so angry when he compares himself to other people.&nbsp; Like how he says he's not awesome anymore since he failed his driver's test.&nbsp; Pfft.&nbsp; I don't think anyone would care too much if he did fail.&nbsp; No one would think less of him.&nbsp; Maybe I'm insensitive.&nbsp; But thats all BS.&nbsp; "Wow, PSAT score.&nbsp; How did I get that?&nbsp; I'm so dumb!"&nbsp; Shut up little fucker.  Sigh.

      Except visiting colleges is not fun.     Today, I visited Rider University and College of New Jersey.  Although the two schools I wasn't really interested in, it was fun to go around and tour them.      I wasn't really impressed by Rider University.  It was just bland and the cost of tuition was too much for something thats not so awesome.  Its mainly a business school so sciences weren't the top priority.  I took two pictures there.  I wasn't interested at all.    College of NJ was better.  But not by much.  The campus was great.  The dorms were bigger.  But again, nothing really interesting.  I liked the study abroad program there.  But its not too big.      Meh, nothing interesting.    La Salle business is over.  Now, I'm just chilling.  Its getting really boring here since I have no one intelligent to talk to.  Matt hasn't e-mailed me back.  Sigh.  Other than that, I've just been e-mailing various people.  College e-mail-ing.  I have to e-mail biscombe and ask about her.  Um, I'm studying.  Yeah, I'm a dork.    I think next year is going to be really stressful for me.  Which is good because Junior year has been too easy.  I got my class rank and junk today.  14/430.   Good.  3.99 GPA.  Hopefully all my honors and AP classes will bring my GPA up.    Farewell.

      While I was online, I decided to visit my Xanga page and to check on my friend's Xanga pages and their updates.  I mean, I really do care.  hehe.  Anyway, I see Kevin's page and it was very angsty.  Apparently he failed his driver's test and was very bummed out about it.  Sometimes I feel like that.  You know, when all of my friends are able to do this the first time and pass and I can't I'll feel that I'm less of a person than they are.  I'm not as awesome or cool as they are since I failed my first time.  And I know how I hate people who just go and say "Aww, you'll pass next time."  I damn straight will pass next time.  No, I'm going to fail next time.  Pfft.  Anyway, I decided to comment and I thought about what he wanted to hear at that moment.  Well, I didn't know but I gave a really good attempt.  So I decided to curse him out.  I mean, its different, right?  Basically, I just told him that he will be the same person to me no matter what.  That there are more important things to worry about other than some dumb driver's test.  But I said those two sentences with a bit more energy.  Mixing words like "asswipe" and "fuck" a few times.  It was hard, I'm not used to cursing.  Hehe.  Other than that, today was my last day of forensics at La Salle.  I liked working on the electron microscopes.  I do wish the Professor will send pictures he took of the whole event soon.  I could totally post them on my journals.  Wednesday night, one of my neighbors decided to ring the door bell at 9:00 at night.  It was really unexpected.  She said that she had always looked across the street at our house and had always wanted to talk to us.  But she didn't know how.  So she decided to today.  Or tonight.  Wednesday night.  Sure, whynot.  She likes the artchitecture of the house.  And stuff.  Cool, I guess.  A few minutes later, my next door neighbor knocked on our back door and announced that there was a family of skunks living under our shed.  Right.  Well, the next day, we investigated.  Well, we didn't investigate too much because I was afraid of getting sprayed.  But we didn't find anything.  *Shrug*.  Maybe they moved out.    Cool beans.

      A song by the Chinkees.  Sounds interesting.  Anyway.  I signed up for a Gmail account.  I don't know why.  Blogger offered and I decided that someday I might need it.  So I should start now and get a good e-mail address before they all are taken up.  It is at  urlLink This.Car.Up@gmail.com .    Forensics is fun.  I thought I had something really pressing to say here.  I like hanging out with the little posse that formed.  This one guy is really nice looking.  He does a really good George Bush impression.  I have definately taken a liking to him.    Today at lunch, we discussed gay marriage.  His friend, Tom, had the same views as I did.  Basically I am against gay marriage because I find that contradictary.  Marriage is a religious ceremoney and I don't see how the state can have the power to either ban or allow gay marriages.  It is up the the church to decide whether or not they will allow marriage.  I think the state should only be able to allow civil unions.  Civil unions between man-man, woman-woman, or man-woman.  It doesn't matter because its not marriage.  Marriage is left to the religion.  Which is where it belongs.  Tomorrow is the last day of forensics.  Its also violin lesson day.  Which I am dreading since I have not practiced.  I've been so busy.    Sigh.  In a good way.

      Hehe, the first day without Matt for a while and I break down.  I knew this would happen.  I can't stand the thought of not having him there to talk to, especially now since he means so much more to me than ever.    I logged online today and found an e-mail from him.  I love getting e-mails from him.  But unfortunately, this one wasn't filled with awesome metaphors and a good message.  This e-mail was filled with two zipped conversations.  From the very first to the most recent (and hopefully not the very last).  Which I guess was nice.  But I wanted a message from him.  Sigh.  12 MB.  Wow.  Since June 17th, 2003.  To July 10th, 2004.  A year.  And more.  I told Amanda about us today.  And that felt good.    Anyway, about the Simpsons.  Today, the episode was really touching and it made me tear up a little bit.  It was about when Homer was a young kid.  He was sent to camp where they made him work.  At camp, Homer met this girl and they shared their first kiss under the stars.  And after that, he didn't see her again.  She was heart broken.  And so was he.  Well, it turns out that the girl was Marge.  And so in the end, they did get back together again.  Without knowing their previous romance.  And I found that very touching.    Its something I would want someday with Matt.  But that road is filled with many many bad parts.  Pain.  And tears.  But in the end, is it worth it?  It is.    Other than that, I'm randomly tearing up whenever I think of Matt and how he's moving away.  Hopefully it'll get better.  Soon.  Also, I might be going away the two weeks he's home.  Which is bad since the last time I saw him (yesterday) we didn't get any alone time.  Which I need before he leaves.  To have him hold me one last time.  Lets hope this all works out.  Hope.  Sigh.

      Today I got up at about 6:00 or so.  I did go back to bed until 8:30 AM.  I had a dream but I forgot about it.  Probably wasn't important anyawy.  Today I was to meet Erika at the Oaks Movie theater at 11:15.  So I left at about 10:50 and I arrived early, actually.  So she picked me up.  And we chatted about biology and forensics and electron microscopes and whatnot.  That was fun.  She's in interesting person.    I arrived at Matt's house early.  Before everyone else, nearly.  I just kinda stood there while his mother and Erika arranged stuff.  I offered to help but there wasn't anything really for me to help.  I did help bring up some beverages.  I felt like a sore thumb.  Like I didn't really belong.  Which was partly true.  I mean, I don't think I would have been invited if I had not had plans with Matt that needed to be broken.  Sigh.  His friends started arriving.  They were cool people.  There were a couple of silences which I didn't understand.  They must be really good friends, I don't know how there were silences.  There's almost never something like that with my friends.  There's always constant conversations with my friends.  But I guess people are different.  I think the day was fun.  Although it was getting bit old and overdone with meeting new people, these were good people to meet.  I had a great time.  I was kinda sad I didn't get any time alone with Matt but I think it was important for him to spend time with his friends and family.  Since he is going away.  Maybe I'll have time with him later.  I hope so.  I don't want this to be the last time we meet.  I really like him.  I want him to stay here so I can be with him more.  I hate this.  He is such an awesome guy.  I don't want to let go.  Heh, look at me, I have watery eyes.  Sigh.

      Yesterday night, I really wanted to talk to Matt since I wasn't feeling so chipper.  But as I was telling him my problems, I didn't really feel that he was listening.  Since his responses came a bit late or took a really long time to come.  And I just didn't have the feeling that he was listening.  Then I found out he was talking to Amy, who wasn't feeling so chipper either, and some other guy that he's going to Dorney Park with today.  So I told him that I was going to bed.  I didn't feel like staying up for no reason to talk and have a third of his attention.    I did manage to tell him that I told Charlotte about us.  And the whole "Which side of the fence are you on?" sort of deal.  I don't know.  And people should stop pressuring me about it.  Geeze, what difference does it make?  If I want to find out, it would be for myself.  Not for other people.  So I left Matt since I think Amy's problems seem a bit more urgent or something.  And I didn't want to deprive Amy of Matt's attention.  Matt did, however, wave off that other guy.  And I felt better.  But I don't know.  I wanted his full attention.  And I guess if I didn't have his full attention, I didn't want it at all.  Childish, I know.  But thats how I felt.    I hate it how he doesn't understand my situation at all.  Even if I do get awesome test scores on the SAT's, SAT II's or whatever, I'm still not going to get into every college, or even my dream college.  Money.  Geeze, he makes it sound like its no big deal.  I hate that.  I hate talking to him about colleges.  How his family is so well off that they really don't care what he studies in college.  He can go anywhere, the only thing limiting him is his brain.  I'm limited by a wallet.  I hate that so much.  "Don't worry about that until later."  Fuck you.  Anyway.  Today was the last day of Forensics.  And I am so glad.  Danielle is seriously getting on my nerves.  She's getting way too touchy-feely on me.  I was complaining how it sucks to drive in a hot car and she comes over and says, "What?  Hot?  You're hot? What?" like she didn't know what she was talking about.  Lady, I feel your presence in my bubble.  Stay out of my bubble.  Stop freakin touching me.    Other than the bubble-invading lady, today was okay.  I liked getting to know the other people.  And doing science work.  It is like a full day of biochem lab or something.  With smart people.  Which is always a nice change.  Group Picture.  Matching La Salle t-shirts!  Corny.  Next week.  Same thing.  Only with electron microscopes.  Awesome.  I want to talk to matt today.  Maybe today will be better.  Maybe today, we'll have one of those conversations about whatever that I never want to end.  But they always do.  At 2:00 in the morning.  I love those conversations.  I am really going to miss them.  Who will be my Matt-replacement?  Whatever.

      Yesterday, Matt's father called me.  Well, he called my dad's cellphone and there was much confusion.  Whatever.  It seems that his parents want to cancel the Philadelphia date/trip.  For a surprise party.  I was a little crushed by that.  But I guess it'll do Matt some good.  Since a lot of people will be coming.  They, of course, invited me to that.  And at first, I didn't really want to go.  Since it'll be meeting new people and I have had enough new people for the week.  I didn't feel like looking my best for any new people.  But I think Matt would like it very much if I came.    Of course, I can't tell him.  Or ask him if I could/should come.  Well, whatever.  Today, when I was driving, his mom called my cellphone and said that I should call him to reschedule the Philadelphia trip to another time so that he doesn't suspect anything.  I mean, it would be pretty bad if I just told him I couldn't go or something.  Maybe he could read me.  And I guess it'll be better if I stayed out of his way for sometime?  I don't know.  11:15 AM, Oaks Movie Theater, I should be there so Erika, Matt's sister, could pick me up.  Saturday.  Matt's house.  Surprise!

      Yeah, the third day of Forensics at La Salle.  Today, I am having more people interaction.  I guess everyone is loosening up.  And that could or could not be a good thing.  I'm not in such a remembering mood now.  But there was this retelling of a conversation after lunch.  Some people are just so sheltered.  Its not even that.  Maybe sheltered isn't the right adjective.  Some people are just ignorant of certain facts about sex.  Sure, why would they care about them?  I guess I'm just looking it at a curious person's point of view, but a person should know what goes on in the body of the opposite gender.  I won't begin to tell you how sad it would be if they don't even know what is going on in their own body.  So people were explaining to this girl about circumsizion.  However you spell that.  Anyway, they retell that conversation in front of me thinking that I will turn red or something.  Instead, I turn slightly insulting in that I call the other girl sheltered.  And turn around to really focus on the work.  Since we were dealing with somewhat lethal chemicals, neurotoxins and whatnot.  Somehow, a lot of people there think I'm a genius.  Or really smart.  Or they're just joking.  Which is confusing but anyway.  So we're doing the experiment and every so often, I wow they with random science facts.  I guess they like that.  Like the agarose gel.  The enzyme for that is procured from seaweed.  I think.  Tch.  I thought these people were smart.    I told them my story about how I went to Condom Kingdom with my friends.  Great adventures.  Suddenly the sheltered girl just says "Can we talk about something else?" which was kind of dumb since I wasn't really talking to her to begin with.  So I go on a whole rant about how it'll do her good to hear about these things.  And how she should go down to the ghetto to learn a few things.    Its funny, cliques.  They form.  Which is a by product of the small group.  I can't complain too much, the cliques sometimes interchange members.  Everyone knows each other now.  Insulting each other in a friendly way.  *shrug*  So I was measuring the lines from the standard protein samples from the electrophorisis test when someone behind me puts their hand on my shoulder.  Actually, she has been doing that somewhat during the whole day.  And its really bothering me.  I hate it when people touch me for no apparent reason.  Like a "oh, how are you?" sort of thing.  Damn, no one should touch me.  Ever.  Well, until I deem it necessary.  But I don't want to be a stick and tell them off.  I mean, its not like they know I don't like being touched.  I just wish people will be less willing to touch other people.  In fear of a stabbing, right.  Just one more day.  Just one more day.  Just one more day.  Crap, just one more day.  whatever.

      Yesterday was the first day of a Forensics Seminar at La Salle University.  I was pretty excited.  But with the whole car-matt incident the day before, I was really tired.  Extremely tired.  My dad drove me to La Salle, explaining in detail about the route I am supposed to take since I will be driving myself the next days.  Anyway, I found the building easy enough.  And I enter.  I waited in a lecture room and watching the people come in.  I was dissappointed that there was no one from my school so I was the only one.  Sitting alone.  But there were a few people who were alone too.  So we were alone, together.  Kind of.  I didn't have enough energy to socialize with people that early.  So I just kind of sat there and thought about the day before.  About Matt and stuff.  I still can't believe that I have a boyfriend.  It has been something I have wished about for the longest time.  Well, not exactly.  I had always wanted sexual relations with another guy.  But I have always wished to have a person that understands me or at least tries to understand me.  I want to be held and loved.  I want a person that is there for me, who cares for me.  And I think its an awesome thing that the person I have now is exactly what I wanted, as a boyfriend/lover and as a sexual partner.  Except we don't have "sex" which is okay by me.  What we're doing now is fine.  Anyway, the day starts.  We are ushered into a lab room and I find out that there are an odd number of people there.  So I volunteered to be in a group of three.  So it was fine.  The people there were nice.  Somewhat smarter than the people I usually deal with.  Which is great, actually.  The lab we did on the first day was DNA spooling.  I have done this before.  But I guess it doesn't hurt to do it again.  I was so tired, I couldn't really remember most of the day.  Lunch was okay.  All they gave us was a bottle of water.  Whatever.  Its funny to watch really social and outgoing people act.  Maybe not funny, but interesting.  But some of the partners in my group go to the same school so they already know each other.  I was one of the new people.  Which I didn't like that much.  Much more work for me to get to know them.  But I guess it wasn't too terribly hard.  Conversations ranged from the weather to college to how boring this lab is.  Jokes here and there.  And away we go.  I went home.  My dad drove me.  The route home was easier.  Let's see how I do tomorrow (today).    Yesterday night (July 6) I had a chance to talk to Matt.  Which I wanted to for the whole day.  So many things reminded me of him during the day.  Like the spoolled DNA looks just like cum.  And I couldn't help but think of him.  It was weird.  Anyway, we had the usual topics of what we did that day.  Nothing new and interesting.  And then we moved onto the topic of the e-mail he sent and the day before.    I told him what he did "wrong" and what he did "right".  He made a good observation.  He said that it seems that he is very hard to understand but very easy to please sexually.  And  I am somewhat easy to understand but very hard to please sexually.  Like opposites.  Its good.  Although I was somewhat offended when he said I was somewhat easy to understand.  I probably am, but I don't like to think of myself that.  I like to think that I am very complicated.  And I am.  Not that many people would think that I would be a person that has a boyfriend.  And not a lot of people know my secrets.  Except for me.    Then he said that it would be cool if I told him whenever I had an erection and he told me whenever he had an erection.  Which I thought was a weird request.  But I agreed.  And I do admit, it was somewhat a turn on to know.  But I would rather know in real life when he had an erection than over the Internet.  Since I would be able to at least look at his crotch rather or maybe do something more rather than just imagine and remember how his cock felt.  The conversation moved to my "confession" of how I felt about him moving away.  I said that I hated him for moving away.  I hated the whole thing.  I hated Japan.  I hated him.  Which is true.  Mostly.  But I know that he has no choice now.  And it is very selfish to wish that he's not going away.  I mean, he has an opportunity.  And I want him to be happy.  I might as well let him go.  To fly.  He and I then wondered if we will ever grow up to be married to each other.  And I said that it is possible, but I'm afraid that someone else will take him away from me.  And that makes me sad.  I mean, who can resist such a good and awesome guy?  I can't ask him to wait for me.  I can't say "Don't have any boyfriends.  I want to have you."  Thats just selfish.  But I want to.  I am willing to ward off any permenant relationships just to be with him.  But I can't ask him to do the same thing.  I can only wish for it.    Today, on the other hand.  Today was better.  I was more awake.  And I knew the people kind of.  Its weird how teenagers, I think, always are seeking for a relationship with some other teenager.  Like all they can think of is sex.  Or something.  Which in my past entries is all I can think about too.  But I keep it inside me.  I don't actively go out and try to go out with people.  But whatever.  I guess I'm just being hypocritical.  We did PCR, polymerase chain reaction.  Its the stuff that they do in CSI.  Which is cool.  We did a lab where we solved a crime.  It was easy and most of the time, we sat and chatted with each other.    I think I have a somewhat strong aversion towards new frienships.  Like I don't know the nature of them.  This girl that I met there, Danielle, asked me to walk with her to the parking lot.  I don't know.  Maybe I'm just very interesting.  And she wants to know me better.  But I guess its cool that I can say "Yeah, I'm taken."  I just won't say by who, of any gender.  How do you feminize Matt?  Mabel?  Whatever.  I think a simple "Yeah, I'm taken" is enough.  I hope people never ask too much.  At least during the summer.  Because after the summer, I'm no longer taken.  Which would be a sad change.  But enough of that.  Drove home today.  Traffic is scary.  People are stressed and it is so hot outside.  I love driving with classical music on.  It feels like some movie experience with an awesome soundtrack.  I made it home okay.  I tried to lay down and sleep but the house prevented me.  Maybe I'll try again.  Speaking of trying again.  I still haven't masturbated.  Maybe I'll try that again.  When I came home from Matt's, I couldn't cum either.  Maybe I can now.  I hope someday, Matt can give me the best cum I've ever had.  Sorry for being graphic.  But I guess this is a blog, somewhat into my personal life.    Sigh.

      Today I went to Matt's house.  I was very nervous because I had gotten the impression that Matt's parents were going to interrogate me.  About DC which I have not been to.  But I have.  I don't know.  I drove to the King O' Prussia mall at about 9:30 AM.  I waited a bit.  And I saw Matt there so I got out of my car and walked to him.  We had planned to do something before we finally were set to go to his house.  He called his mom and said that I was going to be late.  So we had thirty minutes to ourselves.  Which was awesome.  We drove to the top of the parking lot thing and parked in a corner hopefully away from everyone.  And just kissed.  It felt so good.  And his hands felt so good.  After that, we drove to his house.  It was a half an hour ride.  Through the country.  Which looked really nice.  I liked it.  I got really disoriented because of all the turns.  But his neighborhood is nice.  Nice big houses.  Peaceful.  Quiet.  Good place for a family.  His house is nice too.  Nice pool.  His parents weren't that bad.  They weren't that scary once the introductions were over.  His sister was cool too.  It was very normal.  And I like that.  We played some DDR.  This would be my second time.  And I totally suck.  But Matt's really good.  Really really good.  And it was funny/awesome to watch him play and jump.  I'm just clumsy.  But I guess if I had more practice, I could get better.  For lunch, I had some stuff from the local take-out place.  BBQ stuff.  Which was awesome.  Afterwards, we played some video games.  That was fun for a while.  Then we went down and went swimming.  That was also fun for a while.  Then we went upstairs again.  And watched three good funny episodes of the Simpsons.  That was fun.  We kept sneaking ticklings between us.  And random holding of hands.  But nothing really too serious since his family was still there.  But it was fun.  And I liked it anyway.  And then it was time to go.  Which I didn't like.  But I guess good times had to end sometime.  We drove to the mall again.  And we decided to give the whole thing another try.  So we went up to the top floor of the parking lot again and parked somewhere where people wouldn't notice.  And he put the sun shades up.  And then we went into the back seat.  It was way too small and cramped.  So we both couldn't stimulate each other at the same time.  So I decided to stimulate him first.  I reached down into his pants while he was on the bottom and I was on top.  I don't want to sound shallow, but his penis was really big.  I wasn't really surprised as much as I was happy.  So I had an idea.  I asked him if he felt comfortable if I gave him a blow job.  And he agreed.    It was so nerve wrecking.  I didn't know what to do, exactly.  I took his penis and went for the head.  And as I grew more and more comfortable, I pushed deeper and deeper in.  He tasted really good.  And I could taste his precum.  Lots of it.  I deepthroated him the best I could since it was my first time and all.  And I guess he liked that a lot.  His hands touched me all over and that felt good.  And I felt that he liked it.  Pretty soon, he was close.  And then, he blew.  Inside my mouth.  And it was so good.  Tasted awesome.  I still had some in my mouth so I came up and kissed him.  Sigh.  Good.  But it was my turn.  And I guess I had inhibitions and stuff when my time came.  He was so gentle.  He took mine into his mouth.  Up and down.  And it felt so good.  But at the same time, it was weird.  I guess he pulled my foreskin too far back.  And my head is really sensitive.  So thats why it felt weird.  And maybe the location was weird.  And it made me feel weird.  Doing it in the car.  I guess I'm not a car person.  So I told him to stop and I told him to just give me a hand job.  Which I was fine with.  And I got really close a couple of times.  But he just went to fast.  Which I didn't like that much.  And it washed away the goodness.  Maybe if we do it next time, I'll give him better tips on how to get me off.  But in the end, I didn't cum.  At all.  He said I had some precum.  Which is a good sign since I would have to be really really horny to get precum.    I told him to write me an e-mail while he was away.  Well, I sorta "talked" to him, having a one way conversation since he was away and all.  Passed out, it seems.  Anyway, I just told him that it wasn't his fault.  It was probably my fault.  It was probably the location.  Or something.  I still felt bad about it.  But I didn't want him to feel bad at about it.  I'm still kinda jealous that he got to cum and I didn't.  But I guess, oh well.  In the e-mail, he echoed what I said in the one way conversation.  I said that I had a small voice saying "Maybe this isn't right." and another voice saying, "But Matt is right for me.".  Conflicting and all.  He agreed that maybe this wasn't the right thing to do.  That we're moving to fast to something important and at the same time, lowering our standards of what is important.    What is important?  I don't know.  I like him a lot.  I want to be with him.  All the time.  I want to live in an apartment with him washing dishes and putting them away.  I want to hold him and kiss him.  And rub the side of his face for the stubble.  I like to rub my hair against him since he likes that.  And rub my legs between his.  I like to kiss his neck.  And smell him.  And kiss him.  And I guess the important thing is to spend as much time together as possible.  Because pretty soon, he's leaving.  For a long time.  But at the same time, I want to do as much stuff with him as possible.  Because I like him.  A lot.  A lot.  I don't know.  Maybe its my biology and sex drive kicking in.  But where the hell was my sex drive in the car?  I don't know.  Right now, it is important that I talk to him.  Sigh.

      Last night, I was too emotionally charged to write an entry.  But I might be better now.  I couldn't stop thinking about what I have with Matt now.  Its all I think about.  Well, mostly.    Yesterday I went to the beach.  This means that I have a long two hour or so drive in the car.  In my own little world.  Thinking.  About Matt, mostly.  And I had so many questions I wanted to ask him.  So I wanted to go home as soon as possible.  When I got home, I talked to him about it.    1.)  When we were kissing and you reached down to my crotch.  How far does this go?  Or how far can, will it go?  I was actually a bit dissappointed by his answer but I knew it probably was for the best.  He said that he didn't want to mark us for each other.  Meaning that once we do it with one another, all future engagements will be compared to the first time we had.  And those future engagements will lose meaning.  And he doesn't want that.  He doesn't want that for me or himself.  I argued with him that it won't be so for me.  But in any relationship, it takes two.  And I certainly don't want him to feel bad.  And I don't want to ruin it for him.  Maybe when we're older.  Let's just have fun now.  Not sex.  Just fun.  2.)  What is this exactly?  A summer fling or a relationship?  Are you my boyfriend?   This is actually a serious question.  I didn't know what to think.  I mean, words were exchanged but sometimes we have a way of beating around the bush and not realize it.  I wanted the words in plain english.  Is he my boyfriend?  And as you can tell by my previous post, he was.  This is a relationship.  Which is good.  Because I know what to call him now.  I mean, I won't call him, "So, boyfriend, whats up?" but I know that I am "Taken" and not single anymore.  Which is a good feeling.  3.)  There was a sentence in your Livejournal post about me.  "I mean, I spent so much time thinking about us. Being with him always seemed like it was a possibility."  What did this mean, exactly?  I really liked his answer on this.  He said that he had a mental image once of the two of us in an apartment putting dishes away together.  And that mental image sounds so good.  Its probably immature to say this since I haven't actually started my dating life in this area but I feel the same way.  I could see myself living with him.  For a good deal of my life.  A really good part of my life.    All the other questions were small.  Besides, I can't remember them anyway.  Those three were the big three questions I had.  So I spent most of the thinking of stuff and having those questions burn within me and I spent the other times re-living my memories with him.  My only memories so far.  Of us kissing and feeling.  So vividly.  He smelled and tasted so good.  Sigh.  We then moved on to other topics.  I let him have the mic and get off anything he had in mind.  His parents want to meet me.  Its tough having to lie to our parents about each other.  Its sad that society doesn't accept this.  I really hope it changes someday.  We talked and talked.  And it came as a big surprise for me when the subject turned to sex.  And I thought it would be weird to talk about that with him.  Well, the topic wasn't sex.  It was more phsyical stuff.  I don't know, the subject wasn't on having sex.  It was on sex talk, if that makes sense.  Like, "Do you precum?" and the likes.  And it was great having that conversation.  It makes me at ease.  And it gave me a lot of background information that I can use later.  I know I probably can't control myself the next time I see him knowing the things I know now.  About his body.  It makes me crazy and anxious.    Today, I talked to my parents about him.  And I think they generally, genuinely like him.  More than my other friends.  They said he's nicer.  Which is true.  But they don't know about that.  Haha.  I told them about his ability to speak Japanese and the neat stuff he can do and they were impressed.  They're all for me doing stuff with him.  Like go to Philadelphia and all.  Which is nice.  But I'm not too thrilled that I'm taking the bus to the King of Prussia mall.  I want to drive to his house.  I might try to persuade my parents to let me drive to the King of Prussia mall and park the car there in the shade.  But then I'll just take the car and meet him there, have him park the car and take him to King of Prussia.  Although, if he doesn't like that, then I won't.  Its his call.  He's in command.  Which is so hawt.  He wears boxer briefs.  *swoon*  I can't wait to see him tomorrow, however way I'm getting there.  I am going to be tired going home, I know that.  Sigh.

      Today was probably the most awesome day I have ever had.  And that's saying a lot.  Matt came over. Earlier than we planned which surprised me and caught me off guard. We planned to do Xanga reading. Which I thought would last longer than it did. It only lasted a few minutes. Ten or so. I didn't have that many Xanga (Xunga) entries about him that were too interesting. Unlike here. When we were done, it was kinda awkward. I was so nervous and I felt embarrassed kinda to have him in my room. I don't know. A room is where a person goes to get away from it all. And its weird. In a good way. A totally good way. I tried to show him stuff in my room. Which was fun.   We then decided to go to the farm park to do some hardcore discussion. Which I was also nervous about. We arrived, he drove. We sat on a park bench. And it was silent. This is the bad part, actually. The worst part of the day.  You know how people believe in karma?  How for there to be good there will have to be equal?  Newton?  Keep that in mind.  Anyway. It seems that we switched sides. I said that I no longer thought it was so wise to get involved in anything. And he thought it would be cool to get involved in something. And that was where there was a silence. Friction. Which I felt bad about.  I mean, I have always wanted to be something with him. And he has always been anti-that. Which I sorta accepted. So I expected him to be firm on his beliefs. I mean, thats what I predicted. And he would agree with me since I took so much time to try to change my point of view. Painfully. But it wasn't like that. At all. And he was sad. I hated that smile he has when he's dissappointed. And he kinda pouts and acts weird. Which is very bad. Bad.    I guess now that I think about it, I really wanted to be sure that I wanted something with him.  I thought that if I had "tested" this out, to see if Matt really wanted and felt strongly about wanting a relationship.  I certainly didn't want just a fling or a "sex" buddy.  Even if we're not going all the way.  You know?  Its like, I intended to say the complete opposite of what he was saying.  Because I wasn't sure of many things.  I wasn't sure of how much he wanted a relationship.  I wasn't sure of how much he felt for me.  I wasn't sure of all that.    But it showed that he felt a lot of about me.  And he wanted this relationship badly.  Proof.  His face was so sad and dissappointed.  Like he couldn't have something good.  And that showed to me that he really really wanted this relationship.  However, at the same time, he didn't force me at all.  He accepted what I had to say and cares about me enough to trust me to make my own decision.  He cared about me enough to suppress his feelings and act "okay" which i felt was really sweet.  Although painful.    Matt, if you're reading this.  Well, when you read this, I have to say that I am very sorry what I had put you through.  I just didn't know you well enough.  Well, I did but I didn't.  Strange, huh?  Well, our relationship is strange.  I am sorry for making you sad.  I am sorry for crushing you.  But I had to do it to be sure.   We  had to look at the bad side of things, at the "No" before the "Yes." and that was essentially what I was doing.  Although I didn't clue you in on it.  I just felt that maybe if I told you, you would act differently.  But I see that you really wanted this bad and that you really care about me.  And I appreciate that a lot.      I have no problem seeing myself in your arms for the rest of my life.  No problem at all.    Anyway...  We went to the mall. Plymouth Meeting. To look for mood rings. We found some. But they didn't have the correct sizes and the correct style. I mean, they had my size but they didn't have matching styles for the both of us. So close yet so far. But all the while at the mall, Matt was sad and smiling. Which I didn't like. I wanted to hold him. Or have him hold me. Or something. To make things better for him. I care about him a lot.  We had pizza. I said he had nice eyes. Which made him uncomfortable. Well, he was staring at me. And I had no choice but to look into his eyes. And he really did have awesome eyes. I could stare into them all day. And by this time, I was thinking that maybe something with this guy wasn't so bad. Not so bad at all.  We got into the car to go home. And I just let it all out. Forget what I said. Forget I said that it wouldn't be so wise to be anything. We're going to get hurt anyway. Which was his reasoning. If its going to hurt anyway, why not? But I didn't like that. Not really. I wanted something. I wanted something. I made him promise that we can break this off when he leaves and we can "resume" it later. I made him promise. We can resume it. Later. Which was what I wanted. You see, at first, I wanted to wait until we were older. I still do. But I want something now too. And it was the best of both worlds for me. And hopefully him too.   Well, he accepted.  And he took my hand.  And it was good.  Karma.  For  you.  I love you Newton.  He was so happy. Which made me happy. I was also happy because I had an awesome guy. I had him. And I was so happy. It just cannot describe it. Beyond Happiness. Beyond.  We went back home and we talked. Unfortunately, we couldn't hold hands or anything. It was my house. We made a list of the things we should do in the future. And we got to number 10 until we decided to take a break and read those hypothetical questions from a book I have. And that was fun. My parents left so I had to wait until my parents returned until I can go somewhere more alone with Matty. And that came in due time.  We decided to go to a park near my house. Walking. We sat near a stream. And it was silent too. But a good silence. I like this silence. It was awkward since you know, we're together then. "Officially" but I didn't know what to do. I was nervous. Flushed with tons of emotions and feelings. Eventually we started to talk and have a good conversation. We moved closer. Held hands. Hugged. I love his stubble on his chin and side of the face. I love that. So much. So much. And we just turned our heads. And kissed. It was so awesome. And it was everything I wanted. He tasted awesome. And good. And awesome. And his hand reached down to my crotch. Although I wanted that a lot. I didn't think it was so appropiate at that very time. I mean, it was public. I wanted him to touch me. And it felt good when he did. It felt awesome. But sometimes you just gotta say no. In a nice way. We will do that in privacy next time. We will. And he understood that. I knew he had an erection. I wanted to reach there too. You know. To feel. But maybe in private. No. We will do it in private. Touching. Sweetness.  karma.  Too much goodness.  I really want to go to his house on Monday. Maybe I will. My parents liked him. Which was good. They said he seemed nicer than all my other friends. Which was good.  I love his chin and his side of the face.  Um, he seems to have a better recollection of things. I mean, yes, I do remember everything that goes on. And I did leave a few things out. Like getting scared when people walked by our spot where we were sitting very suspicously close together. But I didn't think that was too important. Maybe I'll add on more someday.  Anyway, onto a discussion. I think its awesome that we have a relationship. Its amazing. I wanted this for so long. And I finally have it. However, its a bit weird since we're both guys and I don't know who has the role of what. I guess we just take turns. But I will tell him that I do not want him to call me "Baby" or anything. I mean, "Honey" is border line. But I don't want a "Hey Baby" everytime I sign on. I don't. It just feels weird. I like guys because they're guys. I don't like guys because of cocks, although it is a very good bonus. I want him to be as natural to me as possible. You know? Although I love sappy stuff. I like that mushy stuff I don't like to be called "baby" or "doll" or "sugar" or anything. That is it for this particular subject.  Okay. Next. I don't know if I love him. I really really really like him. And as time goes by, I'll think about the rest. Or maybe I shouldn't. Since it will end. I am sure. When he leaves. Maybe I'll like him now and love him later. That seems like an awesome plan. As long as I get to spend more time with him. And kiss. And feel his face.

      Yesterday evening wasn't my best evening in a while.  So I guess thats a good thing.  But it was a bad evening nonetheless.  My mother decided to take the family to see Spiderman 2.  At 9:00 PM.  And I was positive (or at least hoping so) that the shows opening day were all sold out.  So that I didn't have to see such a horrid movie.  But one show was not sold out!  YES.  One show.  At 10:30.  So we had to wait until 10:30 when we arrived at about 9:15 PM.  It was so boring.  And dumb.  I hate going to see the movies at night.  Because thats when people go on dates.  And people on dates have the one thing I don't; a date.  So I usually avoid seeing movies at night.  I usually see movies during the day.  When there's only old people and bored people.  Which is me.  Kinda.  So anyway, here I was with my family trying not to look related to them.  And complaining.  I know I shouldn't have complained because I wanted to be on their good side.  I know I should have kept my mouth shut and smiled.  Better to not say anything than to say something, right?  But I just couldn't help it.  Its my character to speak out.  Which pissed my parents off.  A lot.  At the last moment, I just clamped my mouth down.  Fine.  I will like this movie.  I will.  The movie wasn't that good.  I don't have much interest in comic-to-big screen movies at all.  I don't have much interest in comics in the first place.  Except for the Sunday Comics.  Anyway.  My mind was elswhere the whole movie.  But I do have to say that Tobey Mcguire is one good looking guy.  I just melt with his smile.  Its so happy and boyish.  Like he's geniunely happy.  Nothing could take his happiness away.  And its good that he has a nice body to go with it.  (shallow-ness is over)  This morning was better.  I think my mom was a bit pissed off at me this morning still.  But I guess I used my personality and talking skills to calm her down.  Today we went to Philadelphia.  Which is semi-fun.  I hate my weak stomach.  I had a stomach ache the whole morning.  I think its partly due to my semi-lactose intolerance.  Whatever.  We had lunch in a resturant.  I find it nice that I can recognize people there.  And they recognize me.  Well, more so my father.  Connections, baby.  We then went on a quest to buy some incenses.  Or however you spell that.  We went to this supermarket on Washington Blvd.  My father and I spent some time looking at the music they had for sale in a small shop that was part of the whole supermarket.  That was fun.  My father and I were watching a Karoke video of some chinese singer.  It was cool that it both had chinese characters and vietnamese words on it.  I guess it was a dual language thing.  Which I thought was cool.  And the music wasn't that bad.  I was also looking at some knick knacks that I could get for Matt but decided not to.  It wasn't worth it.    When we were leaving, my mom said that if I wanted those small knick knacks I should go to California.  It would be cheaper and the stuff there is better.  So I asked her if I can go to California since she had expressed that in the past I would be able to go on the plane alone and junk.  Which would be awesome.  My mom totally said that that scenario is possible.  But I would have to travel with my brothers which isn't the worst thing in the world.  I would live with my aunts.  That too isn't the worst thing in the world.  And I would have access to a lot of the sources of my little knick knacks.  Which is cool.  And plus, its traveling.  Its something to do.  I hope I do get to go.  It is so boring here.  What else?  Hmm...I think the 75% tuition to Uni of Penn is something of a dream now.  Like its probably not going to happen.  Since my mom would have to work there for three years before the promise came into effect.  Which sucks because I would have been so happy to go to the Uni of Penn.  It's a huge dissappointment.  A really big dissappointment.  If I got in anyway.  Hmm...maybe I can visit Hawaii when I'm in California.  I have family there too.  That would be cool.  That's about it.  I'm getting ready to go to violin lessons with Laskey.  6:30.  I have plenty of time.  Doing what?  Sigh.

      Since I cannot access the Internet right now, I shall write this here.  And I will paste it.  Today Charlotte came over during the evening.  It was a much needed break from the regular everyday stuff.  Although I have had contact with people people, I love being with Charlotte because she makes me happy.   Charlotte came over after dinner and the two of us walked to the park to the very same place where Matt and I shared our first kiss.  Our first date together.  Along the way, I told her the story.  Of course, I had already told her most of it online.  But this time, I wanted to tell it in person to a real person.  And she was a great listener.  She says she is happy that we are together.  And I like that.  She feels bad that she can't meet Matt.  And I feel bad too.  She's leaving again on Thursday.  Everyone is leaving.  And I am left here.  Of course we talked about other things.  We can never run out of things to tell each other.  Even when we are silent, I feel like I am experiencing her too.  Words without sound, I guess.  To sound poetic.  She talked about this guy that she barely knew at her place that she works at in Gettysburg.  How she always admired him and had a little crush on him.  And how she felt so bad when she didn't know what to say to him until after he left.  He is leaving for Missouri.  And she feels bad because she didn't have anytime to know him.  His full name, nonetheless.  And in a way, I know that feeling.  To have someone leave before they know or before I know what is really going on.  She always talked about how her mother looks down on people sometimes.  I had always thought her mother to be good.  But I guess everyone has a bit of black on them.  Charlotte's mom sometimes talks about people behind their backs.  Or thinks she is better than them.  Which could be true, I'm not doubting.  But sometimes, modesty works.  We discussed destiny.  I am reading a Buddhist book on ways to change destiny.  LiaoFan.  It's very interesting.  Ordinary people are destined to have what they have.  It's no use to fight or pursue anything with great vigor because they are destined to have that in the end.  However, enlightened people let go of their attachments and truely gain what they want even if it doesn't fit into their destiny.  They gain both spiritually and worldly.  "Riches to last ten generations".  Do good deeds and everything will be good.  I like talking to her.  There is a small group of people who I like to talk to about a lot of things.  Matt, Charlotte, Kevin.  I can't think of anyone else.  Those people always intrigue me and I feel like I can say anything I want to them.  It's a good feeling.  Wow, the place that Matt and I sat for the first time together is so beautiful.  Willow tree and a stream right by.  Its so peaceful.  I love it.  Afterwards, Charlotte suggested that we go to see the Village.  To the theaters.  Sure, why not.  I like to spend time with her.  She's a wonderful person.  We tried to call Matt Quaglia.  But he couldn't go, his parents were out of town.  And we tried to get Alex Manzi to come with us but he wasn't home.  So it was just Charlotte and me.  I liked it better that way.  I could talk about things more openly.  I had a free movie ticket thing so I didn't have to pay.  But I drove us there.  I paid for the drink.  The popcorn was free too.  Which was cool.  I saw Izzy there.  He works at the movie theaters.  I don't know if he still considers me a good friend.  We are so different now, its sad.  We used to be best friends back in kindergarten.  I don't know how two people could change that much.  But I guess its possible.  Sadly.  I hope my friends right now, I hope I don't grow far apart from them.  Especially with Matt and Charlotte.   The movie was awesome.  Somewhat scary.  Suspenceful.  It is way better than Signs.  I did not like Signs at all.  And some of the scenes in the movie was gorgeous.  Picturesque.  If thats how you spell it.  The thing I loved the most was the music.  The violin was awesome.  And the solo violin accompanyed by the small orchestra really fit the mood of the movie.  It was so natural that a violin would be playing during some scenes.   I had wanted to see this movie with Matt.  But I don't think spending two hours staring at a movie screen was the best way to spend our last two hours together.  I wonder how he is.  I wonder if he wonders about me.   At the place where Matt and I were together first, in the park, Charlotte gave me a green bag with a pink rock in it.  I forgot what the rock was called.  But it symbolyzed love and was for people who will/was/are going through tremendous hardships.  And she said that once Matt leaves, I would need all the good luck I can get.  I think, right now, that when Matt leaves, I would not be so much as sad, but as silent.  I don't think I will cry.  Or be sad.  It is sad that I have given up a lot of my emotions.  Well, not give them up, but learned to hide them so well.  And only in my solitude that I can express them.  To myself.  And always to myself.  But this time, I won't express sadness in the form of tears, I will express sadness in a smile.  That I will carry with me.  Maybe I'm an ordinary person and my destiny will guide me to my destination.  Maybe I'm an ordinary person in which all actions to change my destiny will be ultimately futile.  I wish not.  Because I wish to see Matt again.  But then if my destiny is to end up with Matt, then I wish badly to be an ordinary person so that my destiny carry me safely.  Matt.  To you, I want to say this.  You have made me happy. You have caused me to shed tears, as I am doing right now, at this very moment.  You have made me angry.  You have made me feel emotions I never expected to feel.  I thank you.  I don't know if I have been so potent on you.  I don't know if I had been powerful enough to stir strong emotions from you.  But it doesn't matter.  You will always be right here, in my heart.  Some part in my heart.  In so many days, weeks, months, years, lifetimes, we can be reunited.  And then we can have all the time in the world to do whatever.  Like wash dishes.   I don't know what to say, really.  I want to say something.  But what?  Maybe in my silence, words will appear.  Maybe by my past actions, paragraphs will form in your head of my gratitude, my happiness, and my sorrow.  The Wall is almost complete.  Take my hand and we will climb one last time.  After which, only cracks in the wall will we see each other.  But time will pass and the wall will crumble.  And we shall be able to hold each other's hands once again.  And the world shall be ours.  To enjoy.   Geeze, my eyes are watery.  And my nose runny.  Must be the dust in here.   Sigh.

      I just got an e-mail from Matt today.  He is at home but his sleeping schedule has been erradic and he has yet to see me online due to the time (or lack of) he has spent online.  Visiting people and doing this and that before he leaves.  And I totally understand that.  I had expected this, although I wished it never came true.  I'm having mixed feelings.  I feel  angry  at him for not sending me an e-mail when he got back.  I feel  angry  at him for not calling me when he was over there.  Or anything at all.  There was no contact and I am  afraid  that it will be like this when he really does go over to Japan for good.  Yet, I feel  happy  that I did recieve an e-mail from him.  But at the same time, it feels like I'm being squeezed into a time slot.  An appointment for him.  I want to act  selfish  and request special attention but that would just be bratty.  He said that maybe he could squeeze me in for a movie or something.  But not for the whole day.  I guess I'll settle.  Thats all I can do.  A movie?  Which movie?  We can never agree on any kind of movie.  I had wanted to spend the whole day with him so I can spend some time with him on my bed.  Because we always wanted to do that.  It'll be romantic and fun.  But I guess not.  If we were to do anything, it'll be in the car again.  I want to do something.  But then again, I don't.  It is the last time we are going to see each other again in our teenage years.  What is appropiate?   I don't think I want Charlotte to come with us.  But I want her to meet Matt.  I think that once she does, she'll know more about me.  Since no one really knows that much about me, I want her to be one of the first to get to know the real me.  And to meet Matt.  But then again, its our last meeting.  Is it wise to invite another person?  I don't think so.  But I'm torn nonetheless.  Whatever.

      Hm, maybe he's busy.  Or tired.  Time diferences, I'm sure.  Maybe he has more orientation classes or something.  I don't know.  I have not heard a word from Matt.  I thought he would at least e-mail or something.  Or maybe update his journal.  But nothing.  And I don't know what's going on.  What to do.  Sigh.  Is he going to dissappear?  To just leave me?  It sounds like a beginning of an emo song.  A really gay one.  Other than that, Target sent home a card saying that they have reviewed my application and will contact me when they need me.  Meaning that there's no more spots open, I guess.  All of my old bosses have moved on so I don't have any high contacts anymore.  I applied at Old Navy too.  I finally got my application for the volunteer position at Suburban hospital.  Shrug.  Yesterday was the first day that I had ever mowed my lawn.  It wasn't that hard.  Especially with the tractor.  It was kinda fun.  It was more fun because my parents weren't home.  No one was home except for me.  And I liked it that way.  I am definately not going to stay home for college.  No way.  Temple seems like a nice place.  Populated.  I want to do something with other people.  I'm sick at staying at home.  And I had hoped I could do something with Matt.  Just one more week that he's supposed to be here.  Maybe I won't see him ever again.  Or hear from him ever again.  Right now, it really doesn't matter.  I had good memories.  I wanted more memories.  But I guess I can't ask for too much.   What should I do?  What is my next step?  Will someone please comfort me?

      Right now, I can't sleep.  I'm just thinking too much, I guess.  As pathetic as it sounds, I can't wait until Matt comes home so I can talk to him.  Just to chat.  I don't know what I'll do when he really leaves.  Sigh.  He'll be home on the 4th of August.  I was just thinking about when I will be able to see him again.  I hope soon.  I got into an argument with my parents about colleges.  It seems that they want to send me to MONCO for two years, then I can transfer to a real college after that.  I don't know, but the thought of living with my parents for another two years isn't very appealing to me.  If I do live with them, it means I won't have a life at all.  I won't be able to date.  Its not like I'll be making any college friends since I won't be in college.  I'll be at MONCO.   My mom says I don't volunteer enough.  Maybe I don't.  But I do volunteer.  I do orchestra "gigs".  I tutor people.  I help people in school.  I play for old people.  I play for dinner parties.  Thats good.  But I guess I'll have to do more.  So today I called the Montgomery County Cancer place or whatnot on Powell Street.  I actually want to volunteer there.  Maybe it'll make my mom happy and me happy at the same time.  Which would be awesome.  I plan on calling Target tomorrow and see if I can get my old position back as cashier.  Whoo.  Except not.  I really don't want to work there.  But I have to make sacrifices inorder to do certain things.  So I guess I must.  Two six hour days and one eight hour day.  Tuesday, Thursday and Sunday.  Twenty hours a week.  I think that will be good.  A bit too much.  But I can handle it.  It'll being in good money.  About $300 before taxes for every two weeks.  I can finally buy stuff again.  But I mustn't get ahead of myself.  I have to call first.  And see if they're hiring this time.  I hope they do.  Sigh.  I really don't want to work there.  I wish there was some other place to work.  That pays just as well.  And is easy to get.   Sigh.
