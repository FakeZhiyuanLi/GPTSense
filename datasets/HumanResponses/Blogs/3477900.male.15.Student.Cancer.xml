      Hi,     I decided to write this like a letter, i chose a stupid name for my blog, lol. Its almost 3 am, my friend (jessie) fell asleep so im up alone,  got boored and decided to write this for my buddy profile. I gues since this is my fist blog i should tell you about me, but im gonna be here for a while so i might talk alot about me or about other people. Well, im 5'10", i have maybe 5" long dark brown hair, and i have dark brown eyes. im almost 15, im a guy and i live in southern Ohio. im not skinny, but i would say im fat(others have though...). i play bass alot and i try to get online to talk to my friends, but my parents bug me most when i am online.lol  Im thinkin about learning guitar so that i can play some cooler stuff, but i still like my bass. im a huge metallica fan, i havent been to many of their concerts, but i have all their Cds. I like older rock and some newer stuff, im not a big fan of rap, but i do like some of it. im stayin up late tryim to download "Naruto", its an anime series you get offline, my friend showed me a few episodes and it rocks. its taken forever though, im downloading the first 10 episodes and its gonna take like 9 hours. I hope it's worth it, im freezing.lol   if it doesnt speed up i wont get to watch it untill monday( it's thursday night). im leaving early tommorow to go on a trip, it's gonna be fun though. I get to skip school too :) thats why im up so late. i usualy have fun at school, but i never do any work, lol. im taking latin and it sucks, i have a D and its alomost the end of the year! So, i've been typing for like 20 minuts, im a slow typer and im running out of stuff to talk about. i could talk about alot of stuff but that could offend some of the people who read this. I wonder if i could stay up all night... if i do i can just sleep in the car tommorow, lol. I wish i had someone to tak to right now, im sooo boored. Im gonna change topic alot so i hope it doesnt confuse you too mouch ;). I just broke up with my girlfriend and im lonely :( im looking for a girlfriend, but this one girl i think is real hot probvably wont go out with me. she talks to the prepy girls and this one kid, i think she likes him or somethin... i gies i'll find someone, i want to date someone that i can spend time with though, i like to just hang out and talk and stuff. If you wanna go out with me i hope you live in fairfield, thats where i live, lol. My mom wants me to meet tth daughter if one of the people she hired, she's always talkin about her... my mom is just weird, lol. i think im gonna go watch tv for a while, if i come back it'll be in a different blog. if you wanna e-mail me it's metrocks612@hotmail.com ok, well i'll make another blog either tonight or monday. bye bye
