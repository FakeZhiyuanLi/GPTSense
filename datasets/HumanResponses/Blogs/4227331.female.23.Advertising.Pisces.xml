      Today, I feel the need to bitch. Yesterday was undeniably the day from hell.  Work was bleh, as it usually is on a Monday. Saunter in around 8:30ish to voicemails from my anal retentive prick of a supervisor and proceed to be put in an absolutely horrible mood due to the simple fact that he's a lonely, unhappy man and misery loves company. He is only the beginning to a day where I sorta wish I lived in some 3rd world country like Canada or something...  Next up! A few months ago, I lent a close friend almost $500. This was an emergency as she needed to see the doctor and make her car payment and such and I had the extra cash so I helped her out. (I'm such a sweetheart, I know.) Anyway, this month has been a bit tough for me monetarily so I asked her if she would be able to pay me back just a little bit of the money. She said "Sure! Monday, I'll cash my paycheck and we'll meet for lunch." Never got a response to my morning email and figured she was busy.  Work continued to get shittier as I had an political debate with a friend of a friend at lunch and got fired up at his complete ignorance on such matters. I think the only thing worse than an idiot is a loud idiot. So finally, 5pm rolls around and I bolt outta here. I get home and take a shower and try to calm myself. She waltzes in, throws her purse down, and proceeds to smoke some "happy smoke". I mention the check. She gets flustered and acts frustrated and says "Yeah, I cashed it." End of discussion. I then decide that maybe I should mention the fact that my gas light has been on all day and I'm running on fumes. Response: "That sucks. You should get cheaper gas since you have to drive so far every day." What the fuck?!?! YOU should pay back the money you owe, especially to a friend that's struggling.  Ultimately, I think I have got to learn my lesson. Not everyone values friendships the way that I do and not everyone is willing to put others before themselves like I do. And that's fine. Everyone is different. I just can't keep lending selfish people money. Why money means so much to certain people is beyond comprehension to me. If I have enough to pay my bills, then I'm willing to help out the people that I care about. I just have to start viewing people for what they're worth instead of blinding myself to any and all faults.  Okay, I feel better now. I'm just really in need of something to fall into place for me. I truly believe that everything happens for a reason. But I'm beginning to wonder when there will finally be a reason for something GOOD to happen...

      It has been a long time since I've played the dating game. And I'm not talking about the cheesy Chuck Woolery 80s gameshow. I'm talking about the mind games intricately weaved into dating someone in the 21st century. Why do we do this to ourselves? I'm the type of girl that if you're pissed at me, tell me so I can fix it. If you're sad about something I've done, let me know so that I won't do it again. What does it accomplish to not answer my calls for 3 days and then call me back with nothing to say except "Nothing is wrong!" Bullshit.  And at what point did dating someone mean that you were monogamous to that person? If I'm dating you, then that means that I'm dating...If you're my boyfriend, then I'm not dating anymore. I'm in a relationship. Get where I'm going with this?  So, the point of all this rambling: Saturday night, myself and 2 girlfriends and about 6 of our closest guy friends all meet up for a few beers at our local bar. This bar is a comfortable place that we can all go to relax and hang out with eachother, as there is never much NEW action in there (if you catch my drift). So I'm sitting at the bar with my girls and I look over and there he is. Piercing blue eyes, athletic toned body...Mmmm... So I make a mental note of what kind of beer he's drinking and continue to sneaky peaky at him until he's ready for another beer. I then take it upon myself to purchase his next Corona w/lime and have my girl Kim bring it over to him with my regards.  He then saunters over to thank me for the beer and introduce himself. His name is Ryan, his eyes are even more striking up close, adorable dimples and he has this Texas drawl that is to die for. I have found my mission for the evening. He then invites me and my friends to play pool. I politely decline, as I am not intending to make myself look like an ass. I am awful at the game, and being the perfectionist that I am, I tend to get a bit...angry, to put it nicely. He talks me into it saying it's just a friendly game and he's not all that good either. I finally agree to playing a team game. Him and I against Krista and Dave (two friends). We played a few games, then went to sit and chat. Here's where it all fell apart. I am an undying liberal. He felt the need to profess his adoration for the imbecile in charge of our nation. ROADBLOCK. My first reaction was to walk away immediately and chalk it up to a loss due to ignorance. But those eyes, that accent...I just couldn't pull myself away.  To make a long story short, I ended up going home with him that night. Totally unlike me. I'm not into the one night stand scene, but I just couldn't get enough of this guy. Now comes the sticky part...do I tell the guy I've been "seeing" about this rendezvous? Or do I consider it a one-time thing, pray they're never at the bar at the same time and hide it to cover my ass? Unfortunately, I'm a brutally honest person. I cannot hide things from those that I care about. I tell him and hold my breath for the outcome. "I've gotta go." ::click::  This was not good.  At first, I felt awful for hurting this perfectly innocent, absolute sweetheart that I had been seeing. Then I began to look at the facts. Danny is not my boyfriend, I've been seeing Danny for about 2 weeks now, I told Danny from the beginning that I was not into the monogamy thing at the moment. However, I felt as though I was being persecuted for cheating. How can I cheat on someone I'm not with?!? But I FELT guilty...I felt as though I had done something irreparable. And I felt as though I had to remedy the situation.  Things with Danny and I now seem to be fine and we're hopefully on the same page. I just am still unsure as to whether giving in to a guilty pleasure now and again is worth the guilt and the persecution. However, I'm also not sure whether those eyes and that drawl will be, once again, too good to pass up.

      Well, today is Friday the 13th! (Cue the scary music) Today has been like any other Friday thusfar. Me waking up at an ungodly hour (surprisingly NOT hungover this morning), driving my happy ass the hour it takes me to get to work and then proceeding to stare at the clock for the next 9 hours. Ahhh, to live the American dream. And I have an hour and half to sit here and relish it.  Friday nights around my house lately have consisted of beer, beer bonging, shotgunning beer, and beer runs. I'm surprised that none of my friends have managed to dillute their livers enough for a transplant...as of yet. However, we are only 23-25ish. We still have quite a few more years of good hard drinking in our futures. It's Friday nights, though, that I think about the recent "lifestyle change" I've experienced and how happy it makes me.  I was living the high life for the past 3 years. In a relationship with a semi-decent guy, living comfortably in a nice home, in a nice city, 10 minute commute to work, a job that I adored, and my two kitties. Life was more than tolerable. However, we all are aware of the wise saying "The grass is always greener in someone else's yard." My friends all young and beautiful...and single. And here I was playing house with a man a few years older than me and a few decades more mature. And I use the word mature in the worst way possible. I use mature in reference to sitting at home ALL weekend studying real estate and watching ESPN. All weekend, every weekend. Where was my life headed?  I began to think about living that life for the rest of my days. Having kids and exposing them to the fact that their father was a boring old man and their mother was an unhappy dreamer. I began to quickly feel stifled and smothered. I felt as though I was carrying the world on my shoulders...yet I had no one that could REALLY understand where I was coming from. Everyone looked in on my relationship and saw how polite he was and how well he took care of me and how he treated me like a queen. And that was nice for a while...a short while.  Finally, after a few months of being away from the situation completely, I realize that I was never happy with HIM. I was happy with being with someone. Happy to go to bed with someone every night and wake up with someone every morning. Never wonder if I'm going to have to have dinner alone or worry about a date for the wedding next month. It was comfortable. To a certain extent comfortable is nice. Comfortable is convenient. But comfortable is rarely passionate.  As unfair as it is, I am constantly comparing any and all men to the first man that I ever loved.  Our relationship was nothing short of volatile. At eachother's throats one moment and struggling with eachother's pants the next moment. The good was incredible and the bad was devastating. I longed to feel that passion again.  I've finally come to the realization that I don't have to be WITH someone to be complete or happy or have fun. I need to find that within myself before I can give myself fully to any relationship. (Now let's cue the sappy music...lotsa harp!) My Friday nights now are fun-filled 23 year old stupidness. And I wouldn't want it any other way.
