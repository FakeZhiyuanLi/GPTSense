       Meh...stupid emotions! They ruined, yest again, another day. Man, I was so happy...i had the best dream ever, woke up happy. Mom  left. Happy. Dad and brother wern't home. Happy. I was alone. Happy.      Happy!!      But now, depressed/sad/angry/annoyed/joyfilled?!      I have NO idea as to were the last one comes in, no how it fits with the others O___o; Which is weird      Anyway, I guess its because I can't wait to see the Zone today on YTV. According to a friend, voice actors from Beyblade are gonna be one O_o; So I must watch, for MGH =3 (Marlowe Gardiner-Heslin)      Nyeh...Today I really wanted to be left alone o.O; I dunno, its just one of those days, where I just want to be...alone. Just me and my computer. Yep. Alone...      I went to TyKamara today O__o; That place kinda scares me. I only went to go look at some posts that someone told me to. I have an account there, but i have like, what, 36 posts DX!!      I like Tamashii no Kaze more.      Anyway gotta go, maybe I'll post about my happyness or dissapointment after the Zone.      Oh Yea, by the way, I didnt get to play .Hack yesterday       ~Phoenix         (wow, Small entry today o.o;;)

        It seems to me, that my mood and my attitude is being controlled by music, believe it or not.      &nbsp;

       Normally...It would be a new day. New ideas. New adventures...But not for me. Nope. Its a Brand new, same day.     &nbsp;   What do&nbsp;I mean, you ask?     &nbsp;   Well...Despite it being a brand new day, everything's the same. Same fights. Same people. Same house. Same...everything.     &nbsp;   Ha, here I sit, in my overlystuffy room, trying to sound deep...I'm not. My real personality is more of that of a complete psycho wanna-be. I don't try to be the way I am. I don't try to be crazy, outgoing to anything. Its just the way&nbsp;I am. But yet, somehow, It feels fake. It feels like I'm living an imitation life. Something created by media, friends, family, etc. I hate feeling as if, I'm doing something wrong.     &nbsp;   Confusion. I hate it. So confused about a lot of things lately. Its been difficult for me, in my own little world lately. Confused about so many things, some of which I don't feel up to talking about at the moment.     &nbsp;   Parents. I love them, and they should know that. I don't show my feelings, because I'm never around them, but they should know. Sometimes I think they forget that. Recently, my relationship with my "father" has gone down the drain, so to speak. I have no clue as to what I did, but, like always, its my fault. My 'dad' says its because I'm an irresponsible 15 year old, who does nothing but sit in her room and talk on the computer. Now, this is true...But I hardly consider myself irresponsible. But, that's just me.     &nbsp;   Life. I seem to be living two lives. One real, one not so real. The real life is great. I have friends in school, we do stuff outside of school, and they like me for who I am. My not-so-real-one, is on the internet. Message Boards, chat rooms, wherever. But the internet life,&nbsp;I seem to be liking better...Take this one board I go to...Everyone there is like family. I don't feel that in real life. Sure I have close friends, but none to actually conceder my 'family'     &nbsp;   Personally. My personal view on myself, is,&nbsp;I should have done some things differently. I should have looked after my body, so I wouldn't risk getting diabetes, like I am currently. I should have lead my own life those 5 years I let people walk all over me. I should have never hurt myself, and made my mother cry. I should have met my real father. I should...I should have done a hell of a lot more then I am now...I should have had ambitions.     &nbsp;   ~Phoenix
