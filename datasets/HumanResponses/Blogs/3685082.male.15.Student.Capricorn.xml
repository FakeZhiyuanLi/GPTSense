						   Today, after school, a classmate and I were carrying some books for our language teacher to the staff room. On the way, we passed by some classes and my friend started switching off all the ceiling fans that were still on in the class rooms.   "Why are you being such a saint?" I asked him.   "Because" says he, "I may look like a bad person, but I'm not."   That really got me thinking, and I began asking myself if I am who I truly think I am. Do you think I am being myself?   During Moral period today, we learnt a new "Value" called  "Taat Setia Kepada Raja Dan Negara"  (Loyalty to the King and Country) which I thought was total bollocks. Really, really, total bollocks. But I won't state the reasons here, for fear of being found out and getting myself into deep shit.   I'm having the sniffles and a headache now, due to a lack of sleep.    I hope I get well soon!

						   My temper is really bad today, due to the hot and humid weather.    I phoned a schoolmate just now and found out that we have  yet  another Moral project to complete. I got so frustrated that I started yelling at the phone. Another project!   If the government really wants us to learn Morals, then they should seriously implement subjects like Literature in English into the school syllabus. Moral is just plainly, a stupid subject. It is impossible for someone to learn the definition of "Compassion", be shown what compassion is, and with a snap, become a compassionate person. It just doesn't work that way, but the education system  expects  its students to be like zombies. I don't know if it’s the same around the world, but in Malaysia, sometimes I feel like the system is trying to get me to lose my identity and individualism.    If they taught us Moral values through Literature however, it would be an entirely different case. Students will be given the task of thinking for themselves. There will also be a higher chance of students actually absorbing some Moral values too, as good literature gives its reader an almost first-hand experience in a situation.   The Chinese Rice Dumpling Festival has begun. The special Rice Dumpling Festival is celebrated by the Chinese in memory of a great Chinese poet/scholar who snuffed himself a few centuries ago.   The rice dumplings are wrapped in bamboo leaves and steamed till' the pork fat in the glutinous rice melts. The dumplings are normally stuffed with huge morsels of fat pork, oysters, shrimps and salted eggs. There are other various types of dumplings too, some of which are plain but are eaten with  kaya  (a thick, delicious jam made from coconut flesh).   And in follow-up to yesterday's journal entry, I want to note that in my opinion, the situation of Kim Sun-Il, the Korean captive in Iraq who is currently fearing for his life, is a problem of moral and rational action. By giving in to the terrorist’s demands and pulling the troops out of Iraq, an innocent life will be saved. However, by turning a cheek, one more head will be lost but other benefits will follow.   It's a Catch-22 situation. I wish Kim Sun-Il the best of luck, and to mankind; the universal sign: _1_    I'm beginning to fear this world, to fear the very people that I see on the streets. Sometimes, I even fear my own thoughts.

						   I wonder if I'm hyper-active.   It is library week at school, and the theme of this year's library week is the "Paranormal". Considering the low budget that the library committee probably had, I must say that they made quite a big effort to turn the library into a haunted kinda place, but the things that really freaked me out were the portraits of the country's past ministers that still lined the walls of the library.   I was so hyped up by this library week thingy that I started running around and jumping like I was on sugar 24/7. Even my friends noticed it. Me is nutty!   And it turne out that my internet friend is alright after all and that she was away at yet another camp. However, my hatred for human traffickers still burns.   In the papers today, I read an article about the middle-eastern countries. Restrictions on women entering some countries aren't so much based on religious rules; it is plainly because human trafficking is a shit helluva big problem there.   Another fascinating fact in the papers; Scratch this. 200+ people have died so far due to riots in the Phillipines. And a bad thing is that these are only the deaths that have been accounted for. Tsk.,tsk. All for the sake of electing a new leader. How beastly we humans are, not to mention Malaysia's crime rate which, in my opinion, is almost equivalent to that of a war-torn country. I think that Vietnam's crime rate might even be lower.  On the beheading of American captives by the Al-Qaida in the middle-east; it is a barbaric act, a true act of war. So far, the body count of beheaded Americans due to the current turbulence of power in the middle-east is still outnumbered and factually overshadowed by such gruesome historical periods such as the Spanish inquisition.    One thing that these two periods have in common is the obsession with power and balance. If only human beings can learn to be simple people, then only will there be peace. However, as I have always said, we are humans; tools of war.    I totally detest the beheadings though, but it is war. Things like that happen; people are shot, stabbed, beheaded, blown-up and stampeded on, etc...   People killing/ people dying/ children hurt and leaving crying/ if you practice what you preach/ why do you turn the other cheek?/ Father, father, father, help us/ send some guidance from above/ cuz' people got me/ got me/ questioning: Where is the love?   -	The Black Eyed Peas: Where is the Love?

						   It's a Sunday. A really hot and humid Sunday, the kind where you don't want to do anything that is related to work.   I successfully completed half of my Moral project last night, but due to my classmate's incompetence, the diskette which he gave me, that contained the necessary information for the project was faulty.    My internet friend, who is Asian, lives in a neighbouring country. I nearly freaked out while eating my dinner last night. I was reading the papers as I ate and came across an article about her country. It said that her country has an alarming rate of human trafficking. Girls, mostly underage and teenage, are trafficked from Thailand, the Phillipines and Indonesia for sexual exploitation. Some of them willingly become prostitutes whereas the others are forced into it.   The question really is; how many of them are voluntary and how many are forced? It is a poor thing to enslave a peer, a human being. It is as poor as being a politician.   Those girls who are now, as I write, being exploited, are daughters, lovers, sisters or friends. They have hearts, just like their exploiters. However, the only difference is that the abuser's heart is the one that is in pleasure and the abused is in pain.  Pleasure, derived from pain, is extremely sadistic and unnatural. The girls had their lives stolen from them just so that some horny bastard can have his overdue orgasm. I think that wanking is an even nobler thing to do than forcing an underage girl to have sex.   Since when was it natural for an adult Gorilla to have sexual intercourse with its young? Incest among animals may be understandable, but not pedophilia. The purpose of an adult is to protect its minors, not to injure them. Human beings are supposed to be more refined than animals, but there are just too many of us who call themselves "Human Beings" but are unable to follow the simple rules of nature.   This image, that inevitably occurs all over the world as we speak, isn't half as frightening as the bigger picture. Thousands of children are trafficked every year and exploited upon arrival. What if your loved one is a target of such savagery? What can be done to protect them?   As a normal citizen, I don't think I can do much to solve this problem except to write about it and complain. It is entirely up to those shit heads who are sitting on their ever-expanding arses in parliament, doing almost absolutely nothing about it. However, when this becomes a global disaster and UNICEF starts putting the pressure on, only then will the incompetent leaders of the world stand up and take charge. Even so, it can be assured that when the big kahuna has died down, they'll all return to gobbling their caviar and gulping down their cognac.     If this cruel trade continues, all of our loved ones are in serious danger. Your sister, your friend, could be next on a pedophile’s list.    The border between humans and animals is a rather wide one. At least animals don't kidnap the young of their neighbours for brutal sexual exploitation.

						   I feel so heavy-headed, droopy and sad.   I really wonder if I am a little bit off my rocker sometimes or if I'm just a teenager.   I haven't heard from her (my internet friend) for a long time and it's driving me nuts. I've never known anyone as nice as her.   Anyway, I watched Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban with two of my best mates today. We went to the mall extra-early in the morning (9.30 am), ate breakfast at Burger King and even before the ticket booths at the cinema opened, a LONG queue was already there for the Harry Potter movie.    My friends are really cranky too. They suffer from mood swings like I do.   I feel depressed frequently, but thank God that I am sane today. My favorite book is still the  Life of Pi .   I named my pet turtles Jesusvishnumuhammadbuddha (male) and Maryshivakaunyin (female) but my parents made me change their names to Mr. and Mrs. Potato because it's not good to "refer to God as an animal"   But isn't religion about loving God? Why can't I love God the way I want to?   Dang. I've gotta do my Moral project. And in case you're wondering, "Moral" is a really lame subject that only exists in Malaysian schools.
