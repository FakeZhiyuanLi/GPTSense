      Although I am no longer on the dating scene, I was there just a short time ago.  I found it most comforting to meet men through  urlLink online dating sites .  It gave me a chance to get to know the person before I met them in person.  There are several sites that offer helpful tips on dating online, help with writing an ad and more just in a simple search.  If dating online is something you have never tried, you might give it a try!  My mom and my stepdad met online 6 years ago and are happily married and  urlLink I ran into my husband  (former high school sweetheart) online before we started dating again.  It's well worth a try and it's far better than sitting at home waiting on Mr or Ms Right to come along!

      With April Fools Day approaching I thought it would be fun to find out about pranks that others have done or have had done on them.  I also did a little research to find out just what April Fools Day is all about and  urlLink here is what I found :  According to legend, up until the mid-sixteenth century, France celebrated the new year on April 1. But in 1562, Pope Gregory XIII introduced a new calendar to the Christian world, which changed the date of the new year to January 1.   Word traveled slowly and some people continued to celebrate on April 1. These poor, misinformed souls were referred to as "April Fools" and others continued to play tricks on them.

      Genital herpes is actually very common.  In fact it is estimated that one in four adults over the age of 12 have genital herpes.  What's worse is 90% of these herpes virus carriers don't know they are infected.  It's also astonishing that more and more genital herpes type 1 cases are appearing.  I personally believe this is because many people think that oral sex is safe sex when in reality it is not.  Cold sores are just as easily spread to the genital region as genital herpes is.

      You know? being a single parent was probably the toughest job I have ever had to do.  Fortunately there are several sites on the internet where single parents or single mom's can exchange information, frustrations and more.  It was through my own struggles as a single parent, I developed a passion for helping others through some of the struggles I endured.  That is how  urlLink Single-Again  was born.

      On March 11th I had the opportunity to speak to a group of medical professionals offering the patients perspective of living with herpes.  I am thankful to  urlLink GSK  for helping me accomplish this goal and for assisting me in future talks similar to this one.  Many in the medical community realize that herpes is a common virus and that it is not life-threatening, but they tend to overlook the impact this virus carries on the persons emotional state.  I am looking forward to similar talks mid April and mid May and hoping that more will follow suit.  If you or someone you know has herpes and need someone to talk to, find an  urlLink H-Pal here .

      Hi my name is Gayla.  I am the founder of  urlLink Herpesonline ,  urlLink Wartsonline ,  urlLink Skincare-online  and  urlLink Single-Again .  Although I do love tinkering around with web design (which I've been self taught in the last year) my heart is in the education and awareness efforts on the risks, preventions and treatments of Sexually Transmitted Diseases.  I am available to offer support and answer questions through any of my sites listed above.  I am also a big fan of  urlLink Yoshi2me  - a sight founded by one of my best and dearest friends on the internet and whom I have never met in person.  We seem to talk nearly every day and feel as though we know each other so well, but have never laid eyes on each other.  So I know without a doubt that genuine relationships of any kind CAN develop on the Internet.  I hope you enjoy my blog!  I am looking forward to giving the public a slight peer into my world and that of my friends.  This blog will not be just about skin disorders and diseases but also about some of the efforts that are being made to further the efforts of education.

      Last night I watched the movie Runaway Jury.  This movie is primarily based on a shooting that took place in school several years ago and the laws and court cases that pertained to guns following.    Following the movie, my mind drifted back to a time when I was bullied in school.  I carried a great deal of hatred for those who bullied, mocked and humiliated my brother who was three years older and I.  My brother Tony and I were both very shy kids.  We were always taught to be respectful and to always *turn the other cheek*.  Which is what we the good little Christians that we were, did each and every day.    I am now 36 years old and believe with every ounce of my being that my brother turned the cheek one to many times.  Two days following a severe blow to the head from his *school bus bully* my brother (then age 13) had a severe cerebral hemorrhage which would place him in a state of unconsciousness for 16 days.  At the end of those 16 days my parents had to make a decision that no parent should ever have to make, that of pulling the plug.    Through the eyes of a child that was bullied I would say that many children who are bullied likely have zillions of thoughts running through their heads on how best to get revenge on their bullies.  This is why this problem needs addressed and not just viewed as “something kids do.”    Now I have my own children who endure harassments at school.  I have instructed my boys to tell the teacher anytime there is any kind of harassment taking place.  I have explained to them that harassment is any behavior that makes them feel “uncomfortable.”  But realistically, what can the school do?  We have taken the right from our school staff to punish our children to any degree that would promote change in behavior.  Our children see cases on television in which parents are being punished for spanking their kids.  They see parents who are taking up legal action against school systems for paddling their ill-behaved child.  Whatever happened to “spare the rod, spoil the child?”   One of my boys has the same male teacher I had when I was in 4th grade.  I remember Mr. E as a stern sort that could place the fear of God in his students just by smacking his hand on his desk.  My entire class never wanted to feel the forces that be, on the other end of a paddle that Mr. E would swing.  Although we feared the unknown, this fear was not the sole cause for the respect and admiration we gave our teacher.  Fast forward 26 years later to the same teacher in the same school who once possessed the ability to cast a shadow of fear of the unknown in his students.  That has long since been stripped from him and what you find is a man who has been given some of the most ill behaved children in our schools 4th grade simply because he is a man.  Why would the school system or anyone for that matter, think that gender has anything to do with how well a child behaves?  Mr. E has lost his passion for teaching; you can see it in his eyes alone.  The worst punishment he can threaten a child with is a trip to the principles office that results in nothing more than a day out of class.  And at worst a note home to the parents, most of which place the responsibility of their child’s behavior in the schools hands since they are at school all day.  Where does this vicious cycle end?    Now society struggles with the issue of God in our schools, our pledge to our countries flag, our music classes and more.  Just how much does society and our government have to strip from our schools before we realize how much it’s affecting our children?  If you are an adult, you likely grew up in a school that had a policy of corporal punishment.  Do you consider yourself to be a lesser citizen because of that policy?    I’ve yet to hear of court cases being made against criminals that place blame on the punishment their school imposed on them as a youngster.  Many of the criminal’s today claims to have been abused children at the hands of their parents.  Ultimately I think God should stay in our schools, our pledge and our Anthem.  I would rather my children fear the paddle than torment their classmates.  I would rather my children’s teachers spend more time teaching than learning how to keep track of grades in an e-grade book.  I would rather my children learn computers at home, than to have our school lay off teachers so they can purchase more computers.  I would rather our teachers have fewer kids in their class that they can focus on, than to have new playground equipment that would only be used 1 recess a day, since they had to dismiss two of them do to lack of teachers to monitor the playground.  I would rather our schools keep the Best teachers who have the truest positive impact on my children not the teachers that have the most seniority.  If you were bullied in school perhaps it's time we all step up and help organizations such as  urlLink Safe Schools of America  know how to really combat the issues.

      First of all why is it that so many wish to rely on condom labels, textbooks or pamphlets to reveal such information to people but primarily our teenagers?  If parents would only be more open to allowing things like this to be discussed at school then we wouldn't have to worry about debates pertaining to condom labels.  Personally I have tried to get into high schools to help educate our teens on the topics of  urlLink STD's, the risks, preventions and treatments .  Most everyone wishes to have abstinence preached to our youngsters instilling a fear in them that will be short lived at best.  As I was when I was a teenager and not unlike the many generations that will follow, teenagers believe they are invincible.  Just as the government believed hiking up the price of cigarettes would prevent teens from smoking???  Who are they kidding?  These are the same teens that will not bat an eye at spending $150 on a pair of sneakers!  The education HAS to start with the approach of anticipation that kids WILL do what they are told not to!  It has to start with the parents realizing that just because a subject is not talked about doesn't make it less likely to happen.  Wake up America!  It's time for a change and the change should start at home!

      CHICAGO - That tiny bit of print on a condom packet is at the center of a raging debate now that President George W. Bush (news - web sites) has asked the Food and Drug Administration (news - web sites) to modify the current warning to include information about  urlLink human papillomavirus , commonly called HPV or genital warts.  On one side are scientists who believe that condoms should be promoted as a crucial line of defense against several STDs and cervical cancer. On the other are groups that advocate waiting for sex until marriage, and who see the dangers of HPV as an argument for their cause.   Justin Kleinman hadn't noticed the condom packet wording until he squinted to read it recently.  "This is completely pointless," the 24-year-old Chicagoan said of the warning telling him that, while condoms can help prevent the spread of some sexually transmitted diseases, there are no guarantees.   "The lack of information getting to the American public regarding this disease is beyond comprehension," said Linda Klepacki, manager of the abstinence policy department at Focus on the Family, a Colorado-based organization.   She and others point to research showing that condoms don't necessarily prevent the spread of HPV, in part because it may be found on parts of the body the latex devices don't cover. Abstinence is the best way to prevent the disease, she argues.   Adding that information to a condom label would be "truth in advertising," said Libby Gray. She's the director of Project Reality, an Illinois-based group that teaches public school students about abstinence — and notes that most students she speaks with have no idea what HPV is.  But scientists who study  urlLink HPV  worry that abstinence groups are dismissing important information to promote their own values.   "I want to be polite. But it appalls me when I see scientific and medical studies being manipulated for a different agenda," said Tom Broker. He's a professor of biochemistry and molecular genetics at the University of Alabama at Birmingham and president of the International Papillomavirus Society, a coalition of experts who study HPV.   The focus, Broker said, should be on the fact that condoms have been shown to reduce the risk of cervical cancer, which is caused by HPV and which can be detected and treated if women get regular PAP smears. (The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (news - web sites) issued a recent report to Congress that included the same conclusion.)   Broker also said research has shown that HPV transmission is less likely when a person does not have other STDs, such as HIV (news - web sites), gonorrhea and chlamydia, which condoms have been shown to combat.   Both he and Dr. Ward Cates, former head of the CDC's STD/HIV prevention group, agreed that teaching abstinence is a key to preventing the spread of disease.  But when someone becomes sexually active, they also believe that "condoms are the best imperfect way we have," said Cates, now president of the family Health Institute of Family Health International, a nonprofit global health organization based in North Carolina.   Officials at the federal FDA concede that boiling down a "very extensive and complicated" body of scientific literature on HPV into a few words on a condom label is no easy task.  "It must be medically accurate and at the same time, be clear and understandable for, like, my 17-year-old when he goes out on Saturday night," said Dr. Dan Schultz, director of the FDA's Office of Device Evaluation. He expects to issue recommendations on an HPV warning by the end of the year.   Some young people, meanwhile, are frustrated that so much attention is being paid to wording on a condom label.   "Honestly, getting people to use a protection at all is the biggest step," said Jessica Keefe, a 21-year-old senior at the University of Michigan. "I know so many smart, well-educated college students who don't use them — even after years of sex ed and university health programs."   Marina Elbert, a 20-year-old junior at Rutgers University, said she's among those who'd be unlikely to read or heed a condom package label.   "I'm a smoker, and I read the warning labels on my cigarettes, but I still smoke," she said. "That's the same mentality that teens might have toward condom labels."   She'd rather get information from her doctor or books, magazines and Web sites. To that end, the makers of such condom brands as Trojan and Durex have posted information on their Web sites about STDs, as has retailer Condomania.com.   Kleinman, the 24-year-old Chicagoan, agrees that's a better tactic than labeling: "If the money can teach one kid in school the dangers of sex — even with a condom — then it will have been put to a lot more good than any fine-print label on a crumpled wrapper on the bed stand."

      I have been very fortunate over the last 5 years finding ways to work from home and provide a cozy lifestyle for my boys and I.  Unfortunately, that is looking to come to an end the middle of April.  I sure wish this was some type of April Fools Day prank, but unfortunately it's called "real life".   Everything I look for requires a college degree, many even state they don't care *what* that degree is in just that one is required.  Whatever happened to knowledge and experience?   Perhaps someone should come up with The University of Hard Knocks that issues degrees based on life experiences and areas of expertise, even if the experiences include floor mopping 101 or Diaper Changing 202 or what about a PhD in Dispute Settlement?  I have seen articles written on just how hard the job of parenting is, yet no one wants to recognize the true skills it has taken many parents to raise *great* kids.  Those experiences just don't seem to count.  Yet many parents have experience in problem solving, mediation, creative writing (or story telling at bedtime).  Parents tend to have extremely strong organizational skills.  And have you ever seen a parent that could not communicate?  OH and what about that multitasking ability?  Let's not forget that!  Anyone who can organize meals, soccer practice, baseball games, school lessons and still keep the white clothes from turning pink should be recognized for their abilities and not just because they are listed on some sheet of paper that could be displayed in a costly frame on the wall.  Whatever happened to the saying "the hand that rocks the cradle is the hand that rules the world"?  Did something happen somewhere along the line and the rule changed to be...the hand that rules the world so long as you are bilingual, have at least a degree in underwater basket weaving and are of mixed ethnicity.    Many of the jobs I see indicate you must be free to travel with a strong underlying statement that if you have to neglect your family, that's OK because we will pay you for your neglect!  It's ok that you neglect your family and run the risk of you or your spouse having an affair simply because you are "lonely".  It's ok that you have to miss your child’s ballgame and miss that amazing triple play your son had that he will never be able to repeat.  The bright side is you will have a nice fat paycheck from which you can buy him a new bike in hopes of making up for what you have missed.  Now in my own opinion, I have always put my family first.  If I have to struggle for every dime and pinch my nickels till the buffalo...well you know... Then I will!  I will not miss my children’s ballgames; I will not miss a single tooth fairy visit.  I will not have a paid servant placing a band-aide on that boo-boo that only mom can kiss the pain away from.  I will not have another person who has little interest vested in my child’s personal growth instilling *their* own morals and standards in *my children*.  I want to be the parent who can stand at my child’s graduation and know without a doubt that *I* helped create that amazing adult who is about to make an incredible mark on this world.  Written by the hands that rule My world!

      *This is one of my personal favorites of all the articles I have written.*    Allow me to introduce myself:  I am your mother; father, brother, sister, best friend, girlfriend, boyfriend, neighbor, waitress, classmate, coach, co-worker, possibly even your physician.  I am of many faces and varied ages.  I possess higher education or little education at all.  I am found in all classes, races and religions of society.  To look at me, you would never imagine that I hold a secret, that in a particular situation and with the slightest sin of omission, I could affect your life in such a way that would alter life as you know it.  What could this secret possibly be?  It is Genital Herpes!  As a person with genital herpes, I can often live in an ongoing fear of telling you of my condition.  I suffer this fear as the result of your possible ignorance.  How is it that one person should live in the fear of another person’s lack of knowledge?  It’s true!  Nearly 50 million new cases diagnosed each year will walk this same dreadful walk.  The voices of conscience continually asking “will this person run from me?”  “Will this person mock me?”  So many times, I will draw the conclusion that the unknown response is the best and I will make my exit from your life.  Never knowing if you might have been asking yourself those same questions.  The statistics would indicate it is likely that you could, but then again, the risk and fear prevent me from speaking openly with you.  Over time, I have been placed in situations where I was made to feel sub-human.  Listening to jokes, ridicule and hurtful comments by all those who suffer from ignorance, up to and including talk show hosts that are admired by millions across the U.S.  I have been a person who has had the quality of life snatched right out from under my feet, simply because I acted on human nature and had a sexual relationship with another person who’s life was affected by genital herpes.  What can you do as a person that I may encounter?  Become aware!   urlLink Genital herpes can be treated .  With proper knowledge and consideration for you, I have the ability to protect you.  Though I cannot completely eliminate your risk, I can minimize it tremendously.    Understand that just because I have genital herpes, this does not mean I am infectious 24 hours a day, seven days a week.  It simply means I may become contagious a few times per year.  Know that with proper care of my body, time can further reduce the frequency of when I might pass along this virus.  If I am a person with genital herpes and have taken the time to get to know my body and how this virus reacts in it’s active state, I can recognize early symptoms that may further reduce my risk to you.  You have looked at people many times over your life that bore the symbol of herpes in the form of a cold sore.  Were you quick to stand in judgment of them?  Did you assume they had a severe cold or flu and perhaps that cold sore was the lingering aftermath of that battle?  You assumed wrong!  That cold sore is herpes and has little to do with a cold or flu.  In fact, cold sores are becoming the most common cause of genital herpes cases diagnosed in the U.S. month after month.  As a person living with genital herpes, I ask you to learn more about me.  Place me in a position that I may feel more at ease speaking openly with you.  Let me see that a disclosure of such a personal nature will not be comparable to a scene from some old Friday night horror flick in which you would run screaming in fear.  If you would be open to my confiding in you, you may just learn that I am the most honest and trustworthy person that you could encounter.  The majority of us living with genital herpes have found ourselves in this situation by no choice of our own, having been the victim of deception, cheating spouses or significant others.  Not only do we carry the burden of a former deception, we have a lingering reminder of that breech of trust thrust upon us by another.  Certainly, in many cases genital herpes is a form of baggage from a relationship past, but in the face of an understanding person, it does not have to be emotional baggage.  Genital herpes can be a secret borne by anyone, regardless of gender, status, or background.  The next person that you encounter is potentially one of us.  It is everyone's responsibility to understand the pervasive nature of this condition, and to develop a working knowledge of how it influences those around us.

      Over the last several months, I have watched my own mother and step-father struggling to find work in the U.S.  My mother was injured in an on the job accident while installing the fiber-optics of Homeland Security.  She shattered her knee after being told she didn't have time to get a ladder and was instructed to use a bucket instead.  This happened nearly 2 years ago.  In the last couple of years, my mother has gone through 3 surgeries and has now been diagnosed as being 50% disabled.  But did workman's comp stand behind her and support her?  Hell NO!  Sure they helped pay for her surgery and necessary therapy, some of which had to be turned over to collections against my mother before they paid.  Did the black marks on her credit report get removed?  NO!    Right now my step-father is in North Carolina grasping onto any paying job he can get his hands on.  Because of his age, it's a little more difficult.  Here I thought it was against the law to descriminate based on age???  Another thing that really ticks me off is the fact that when they do get applications for postitions it asks questions like race, age and do you speak spanish?  Why? In America, a country that was founded and grew on the English language must we learn to speak another language to get a job when it is the imigrants that have chosen to move here?  Shouldn't they be the ones to learn OUR language?  It does get to be very upsetting in the heartland of America where we are continually watching our jobs filter out of the state and even out of the country!  Just a couple of weeks ago, nearly 1,000 people showed up for work at a plant in Northern Indiana to find the doors locked and their jobs Gone!  Many losing nearly 25 years vested in that corporation.  My mother and I are constantly thinking What can we do to encourage Americans?  To help encourage jobs in our area, but find ourselves hitting brick walls with every idea we come up with.  As a source of dispelling a bit of frustration, I did put together a page on  urlLink Single-Again  with links on where to buy American products and a place to cast your votes on many of the issues that are affecting Americans these days.

       urlLink Human papillomavirus  (HPV) is one of the most common sexually transmitted infections in the world. Experts estimate that as many as 24 million Americans are infected with HPV, and appears to be on the rise. More than 100 types of HPV have been identified. Some types of the virus cause common skin warts. About  urlLink one-third of the HPV types are known to spread through sexual contact  and live only in genital tissue. Low-risk types of HPV cause genital warts, the most recognizable sign of genital HPV infection. Other high-risk types of HPV cause cervical cancer and other genital cancers.   Like several other sexually transmitted infections, HPV usually causes an infection that does not have visible symptoms. One study sponsored by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) reported that almost half of the women infected with HPV had no obvious symptoms. Because of the persistent nature of this viral infection, individuals may not be aware of their infection or the potential risk of transmission to others and of developing complications.    As far back as 1991, the Journal of the American Medical Association revealed that almost 50% of sexually active females seeking evaluation for unrelated conditions at a gynecological evaluation at a University Health Center environment demonstrated positive testing for HPV DNA in the vagina. Thus, a decade ago almost half of sexually active females revealed through testing that they had HPV DNA in their vaginas. This data is an astounding revelation regarding the prevalence of this infection that had never before been noticed.   Interestingly, in this study fewer than 10% of patients had actual visible, external signs of skin changes consistent with "genital warts", the most common skin manifestation of HPV. The conclusion, therefore, was that about half of sexually active females ranging in age from 20-40 were infected with HPV, and fewer than one in ten patients were aware of it.    urlLink Information on hpv testing

      Tue Apr 6, 1:03 PM ET  By Maggie Fox, Health and Science Correspondent  WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Americans may say they know a lot about sexually transmitted diseases but they do not practice what they preach when it comes to defending against them, according to a survey published on Tuesday.  While one in four Americans will be infected with an STD -- and up to half of younger adults will be -- most of those surveyed believed they were not personally at risk.  This is precisely why STDs spread so easily and so pervasively in society, said the  urlLink American Social Health Association , which published the survey.  "The findings in our survey are quite disturbing. Despite the fact that STDs are extremely widespread and have severe consequences, it is troubling that there is such a large portion of people who still feel invincible," said Dr. James Allen, president and chief executive officer of the ASHA.  "In addition, people's lack of awareness about the various STDs only underscores  urlLink the need for continued education  to prevent the spread of these serious diseases," Allen added in a statement.  STDs cause a range of long-term problems. Human wart virus or HPV is the main cause of cervical cancer, while bacterial infections such as gonorrhea or chlamydia can cause infertility in women.  They often have no symptoms and people are often unaware they are infected.  The non-profit group, which promotes awareness about sexually transmitted diseases, published a poll of 1,155 adults aged 18 to 35 interviewed by Harris Interactive. It had a margin of error of plus or minus three points.  Despite not knowing whether their partner had been tested, 93 percent said they were sure their partner did not have an STD, the survey found.  Just over one-third of those surveyed felt "very knowledgeable" about STDs, compared to 22 percent who felt they knew a lot about diabetes, asthma or migraines.  FEELING INVINCIBLE  Sixty-three percent said they were well-informed about the risks associated with sex and 84 percent said they felt they took the right precautions.  But 82 percent of those who said they were sexually active said they never used protection against STDs for oral sex, 64 percent never used protection for anal sex and 47 percent never used protection for vaginal sex.  Even among single adults, 71 percent used no protection when having oral sex, 42 percent never protected against an STD when having anal sex and 23 percent always had unprotected vaginal sex.  STDs including the AIDS virus, gonorrhea, syphilis and chlamydia are transmitted orally, anally and vaginally. In the United States, heterosexual contact is the primary means by which HIV is transmitted now.  The survey also found Americans ignorant of the risks of hepatitis A, B and C, all of which can be transmitted sexually. he group said hepatitis A and B cause more than 170,000 infections each year in the United States alone, killing 5,000 people a year.  "One in every four Americans will contract an STD sometime in their lifetime," the group said.  In February, Advocates for Youth -- a nonprofit group advocating sex education -- and the sexual health-oriented Alan Guttmacher Institute published a report that said 27 million young Americans under the age of 25 were sexually active.  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says there were 18.9 million new cases of STDs in 2000, of which 9.1 million or 48 percent were among teens and adults aged 15 to 24. That means one-third of all sexually active young adults and teens contracted an STD in 2000 alone.

      I have heard from a few friends that  urlLink The Apprentice  is a pretty cool show.  It gives some really cool business tips and strategies, but what I want to know is How in the heck can anyone get beyond that "your fired" and the famed flick of the wrist?  If they could find a way to tie Donald's hands behind his back I think I would be more likely to tune in to The Apprentice from time to time.  Personally, my favorite reality show of all time has been  urlLink My Big Fat Obnoxious Fiance'   Now that was a real hoot!  Hope everyone had a happy Easter.  It's been kind of crazy around here.  I just got a new puppy, her name is Maggie and as soon as I figure out how to post a photo in my blogger, I will show her off to the world.  I can't believe someone could dump such a cute little puppy out in the middle of nowhere UGH.  Some people and their approach to animals simply make me ill.  Donald should figure out a way to fire them off To The Moon!

      I found some really cool information on  urlLink Everything Mother's Day !  From what NOT to give, to gift ideas and inspirational stories!  Here is a bit of information that should be taken into consideration when looking for that perfect Mother's Day gift!    Give household and garden items to mom this  Mother's Day  at your own risk!  That's the message in a new poll. The poll, sponsored by the leading online personal gift service, WishClick, reveals that moms want to be showered with jewelry and flowers, a day off from household chores and quality time with their family.  WishClick asked 500 U.S. moms to name their  best and worst Mother's Day gifts  ever, and also indicate the gift they most wish for this year.  Worst Mother's Day Gifts Ever  The poll reveals insensitive and badly thought-out gifts that have made moms cringe, including carpet cleaner, a thigh-master, a night out at a husband's favorite restaurant and a card that read, "reupholster the chair in the master bedroom."  Worst gifts ever, according to U.S. moms, were:  1.        Kitchen appliances, garden tools and cleaning supplies -- 12%  2.        Dead and poorly arranged flowers -- 5%  3.        Cookie, candy and cakes -- 4%  According to the poll, moms care most that loved ones remember their special day.  Fifteen percent of moms said that their worst gift ever was when their families forgot Mother's Day altogether.  And the poll demonstrates that moms will appreciate most gifts -- a reassuring 46% said that anything their kids give them is a good gift.  Best Mother's Day Gifts Ever  Apparently surprising things can make moms happy.  Tickets to a Cleveland Indians game and a ride-on lawn mower were highlighted by two moms as their best gifts ever.  One mother was delighted when her family gave her a monetary tip one year.   According to the poll, best gifts ever were:  1.        Jewelry -- 24%  2.        Home and school-made cards -- 18%, and gifts -- 17%  3.        Help with chores, or a day of rest -- 5%  4.        Spa trips and beauty products -- 4%  Mother's Day Wish List  Moms are wishing for many different things this Mother's Day, from hugs and kisses to furniture, but the most popular wishes are for a little luxury and pampering, to escape the housework and for quality time.  Some moms are aiming high.  Four percent would love a new car, others a mansion or a cruise.  One mom wants to be "Queen for a day."  And others dream of less conventional gifts -- a shredder, a son's report card with "A's" and "B's" on it, and sex.  Top of this year's Mother's Day Wish List are:  1.        Help with chores -- 14%  2.        Jewelry -- 11%  3.        Quality family time -- 8%  4.        Dinner out, or breakfast in bed -- 7%  5.        Flowers -- 5%  6.        A trip -- 5%  7.        Spa and perfume products -- 4%

      With  Mother's Day  approaching, I did a little searching to find unique ideas.  What I found was this really cool article on the history of Mother's Day!   Mother's Day  actually began in Rome and nearly 100 years ago it became a national holiday in the U.S.  You may think it was all started by Hallmark in an effort to sell cards, but that's not the case at all.  Mother's Day dates back to the ancient Romans and made its way to the United States in the early 1900's and finally became a national holiday in 1914.  The earliest tributes to Mother's Day date back to the annual spring festival the Greeks dedicated to Rhea, the mother of many deities, and to the offerings ancient Romans made to their Great Mother of Gods, Cybele.  Christians celebrated a Mother's Day of sorts during a festival on the fourth Sunday in Lent in honor of Mary, mother of Christ.  In England the holiday was expanded to include all mothers.  It was then called Mothering Sunday.  In the United States it started with one woman named Anna Jarvis.  Jarvis was an Appalachian homemaker and she organized a day to raise awareness of poor health conditions of her community.  She thought the day would be best advocated by mothers and called the day "Mother's Work Day".  When Anna Jarvis died in 1905 her daughter, also named Anna, began a campaign to memorialize the life work of her mother.  Anna remembered that her mother said there were many days dedicated to men but not for mothers.  Anna then began to lobby the politicians of the time to support a day dedicated to mothers.  Anna Jarvis talked to many politicians including Presidents Taft and Roosevelt hoping they would support her campaign.    Jarvis organized a church service to celebrate her mother in 1908 and Anna handed out white carnations to those in attendance because the white carnation was her mother's favorite flower.  Anna Jarvis' hard work began to pay off five years after that service in 1913.  The House of Representatives adopted a resolution calling for officials of the federal government to wear white carnations on the day many began calling Mother's Day, the second Sunday in May.  Finally on May 8, 1914 President Woodrow Wilson signed a Joint Resolution designating the second Sunday in May as Mother's Day.     "Now, Therefore, I, Woodrow Wilson, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the said Joint Resolution, do hereby direct the government officials to display the United States flag on all government buildings and do invite the people of the United States to display the flag at their homes or other suitable places on the second Sunday in May as a public expression of our love and reverence for the mothers of our country."  That was the first official Mother's Day and the tradition carries on to this day.  In fact, Mother's Day has flourished in the United States.  The second Sunday in May has become the most popular day of the year to dine out, and telephone lines record their highest traffic, as sons and daughters everywhere take advantage of this day to honor and to express appreciation of their mothers.

      The following is an article posted at Healthcentral.com  SATURDAY, April 24 (HealthDayNews) -- Every year, doctors in the United States diagnose roughly 15 million cases of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs).  Some of these, such as HIV and hepatitis C, are life-threatening. Others, such as herpes, may not be deadly, but they never go away.  With April designated National STD Awareness Month, new government statistics show mixed progress in combating sexually transmitted diseases.  The number of Americans with  urlLink genital herpes  is falling, down 17 percent between 1988 and 2000, to 17.6 percent of adults, according to data presented last month at the 2004 National STD Prevention Conference in Philadelphia.  However, syphilis rates have risen in recent years. In 2003, nearly 7,100 Americans were confirmed to have the disease, up from 6,862 in 2002. That marks the third consecutive annual increase, officials say. All of the surge is attributable to more syphilis in men, particularly men who have sex with men.  Meanwhile, a recent study out of Colorado found that 30 percent of women, and nearly 19 percent of men, were infected with a strain of  urlLink human papillomavirus  known to cause cervical cancer.  "STDs can cause serious medical consequences, including infertility, transmission to newborns, neurologic damage and increased risk of HIV transmission," says Dr. Ronald Valdiserri, a sex infection expert at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. "While we acknowledge the successful declines in herpes, overall STD rates in the U.S. remain alarmingly high."  The best way to avoid a sexually transmitted disease is "to abstain from sexual intercourse, or to be in a long-term mutually monogamous relationship with a partner who has been tested and you know is uninfected," the CDC's Web site states.  For everyone else, however, latex condoms can thwart the transmission of STDs, as long as they're used correctly, the agency says.  Condoms can often block the spread of HIV, as well as diseases such as gonorrhea, trichomoniasis, chlamydia (the most common bacterial STD in this country), genital herpes, syphilis and chancroid. "While the effect of condoms in preventing human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is unknown, condom use has been associated with a lower rate of cervical cancer, an HPV-associated disease," the CDC says.  Charles Ebel, senior director for program development at the  urlLink American Social Health Association , says condoms may not be perfect protection for all sex infections, but they're "much better than nothing."  In fact, when used properly condoms do block virtually all HIV and gonorrhea, and possibly chlamydia, Ebel says. Recent data suggest they reduce the risk of herpes by about 50 percent, he says. That's significant, he adds, because 40 million to 50 million Americans have the virus that causes genital herpes, though only between 20 percent and 30 percent know they're infected.  "Within the context of any given partnership, condom use makes a huge difference in the protection against the most life-changing STD -- HIV -- and in terms of the most easily transmitted -- gonorrhea," he says.  Sexually active people can also cut their risk of catching an STD by minimizing their number of partners. Studies have shown that people who have sex with many others are at significantly higher risk of STDs, condom use notwithstanding. "Even if you use condoms the partner thing is a big part of the equation," Ebel says.   Chlamydia, which affects an estimated 3 million Americans, is a particular concern for young women in whom an untreated infection can lead to sterility. Caused by the germ Chlamydia trachomatis, the illness can be easily controlled with antibiotics. However, 75 percent of infected females, and half of males, don't have symptoms. And left untreated, chlamydia can cause serious problems, including inflamed testes in males and pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) in females.  Pelvic inflammatory disease is a leading cause of female sterility. Each year, more than a million American women suffer a bout of acute PID, health officials say, and more than 100,000 become infertile as a result. PID and its complications are linked to more than 150 deaths a year in this country.  The American Social Health Association offers the following tips for minimizing the risk of chlamydia:  Limit your sex partners. Doing so will reduce your chances of being exposed to the infection, as well as other STDs.  Always use barrier contraceptives -- condoms, diaphragms and even vaginal spermicides.  If you're sexually active, get tested for chlamydia at least once a year. If you have the disease, make sure your sex partners are tested for it, too.  If you contract chlamydia, be sure to get tested for other STDs, such as gonorrhea and HIV, which frequently accompany the infection. Abstain from sex until your doctor says it's safe to resume intercourse.

      It's been 12 days since I last blogged.  I can't believe how quickly time passes by!    Spring is a really busy season around this household!  I have been working at my in-laws family Greenhouse business, helping them out at least through Mother's Day!  There are some great pictures of the fruits of their labor that can be viewed  urlLink here .  My boys have started their baseball season too!  We have all waited a long time for Opening Day which was yesterday!  Complete with photos (some of which I will display soon), ceremonies and the first pitch by a local minister.  This year my boys team is sponsored by  urlLink T.I.S. College Bookstore.   Opening Day was an exciting time since the boys first game was against their sponsor from last year.  Given that the boys team went undefeited last year, they were concerned over their ability to win this particular game.  In the bottom of the 6th Inning, they pulled out from behind and were able to advance to lead by one run which was what it took to win that game.  The coaches son, who had not hit even one in the previous year, pulled a heck of a hit out of his little pocket to win the game!  His mother, with tears in her eyes turned to the crowd and said, "That's MY Boy!"  I think that was just the encouragement that little guy needed to be a GREAT contributor to the forthcoming games we have this year.  This year means a Lot more to my boys and I because this year we have Rusty!  My highschool sweetheart from 20+ years ago, who became my husband last November.  He is helping out with coaching and for the first time, my boys have a father on the field too!  What a great spring this is turning out to be!  Until next time! Gayla

      I recently  urlLink participated in a talk , speaking to a group of medical professionals. Along with talking about the challenges of  living with herpes , I spoke of the importance of both conducting and encouraging proper STD testing.    I was utterly dumbfounded when a participating dermatologist responded with "why should I encourage couples to be tested when we all know the likelihood is that one will test positive for type 1 herpes?  Only to turn around months later and play marriage counselor because of transmission?"   Unfortunately this is the common mindset of many physicians who do not disclose the fact that standard STD screening does not include  Herpes, HPV or HIV  for that matter.  Would it not be safe to assume that those who seek STD screening would be under the impression that they are being tested for more than those  sexually transmitted infections  that can be cured in a week with a pill?  Should it not be safe to assume that you ARE being tested for the two most life altering and the one most life threatening of all STD's?  I would think so and in fact I did, exactly 17 months prior to my own diagnosis of genital herpes.  Unfortunately, so many in the medical community would rather not "open that can of worms" than to address the real issue at hand.  That issue being that we cannot possibly hope to gain control over the social scourge that is taking place if the medical community is unwilling to properly diagnose.  For information on proper testing , visit  urlLink Herpesonline's STD Testing    I urge each and everyone of you to speak to your own physician, tell them WE want proper testing.  Tell them to OPEN that can of worms!  Ecourage them to do the same for all their patients.  Also, I would encourage everyone to contact their own local government and demand a change in policy where  STD testing  in concerned.  If you have something to say, feel free to email me.  I would like to put together a page called the Herpesonline Voice!  A place where anyone and everyone could publish their own thoughts on this very topic.  Feel free to email me at Gayla@herpesonline.org

      There is nothing like a little fire to get someone going.  After reading the teen sex article this morning, I began an effort that has been heavy on my heart for some time.  I placed a  urlLink teen sex and sex education grassroots page  on herpesonline.  I am going to dedicate time to this effort in hopes of making a change, even if it's only here in central Indiana.  I would hope that others will join the effort.  After reading how much control the Government has over non-profits, I am beginning to think those who are promoting abstinence are doing so with the dollar signs in their eyes.  Simply because abstinence is NOT the reality!

      By Mike McGee, C.S.T. Reprinted with permission from  urlLink National Sexuality Resource Center     When so much public discourse about sexuality education centers on abstinence, promoting comprehensive sexuality education becomes all the more important. Discussions about managed care have often focused on the benefits of prevention and health promotion -- recognizing that maintaining people’s health is less costly than paying for treatment. Promoting sexually healthy behaviors however, is fraught with controversy. Few, if any, educators have a community mandate to help young people develop healthy and satisfying sexual lives. If the organizations that fund sexuality education programs are interested only in changing adolescent behavior to reduce the negative outcomes of intercourse, how do educators promote sexual health? If adults’ messages to young people are only about the dangers of sexual behavior, as with many of the programs funded with abstinence-only-until-marriage dollars from the federal government, where do teens learn how to have healthy relationships? There is, after all, a 12-year gap between the time adolescents are capable of reproducing and the average age of first marriage. Planned Parenthood and similar organizations are working to address the needs of youth, families and communities. In an era of abstinence-only fan fare and funding, emphasizing the need for comprehensive sexuality education is a complex task.   Planned Parenthood’s History  In 1916, Margaret Sanger opened the first birth control clinic in the United States in Brooklyn, New York, and was promptly arrested on obscenity charges under the notorious Comstock laws. Sanger was arrested two years earlier and again later, in 1921, while educating women and men about the possibility of controlling their fertility. At that time, speaking publicly about sexuality was a risky business – particularly when the speaker was a woman, and the content of the speech flew in the face of convention.   Today, the organization that Sanger began, Planned Parenthood Federation of America, provides services to five million women, men, and young people in the U.S. every year. One and a half million of those served are the participants in our community-based education and training programs. Over 850 staff educators and 900 volunteers work in our communities in education and training. Each of us is challenged to follow Margaret Sanger’s example, and speak up publicly in support of healthy sexuality. Eighty-seven years after that first clinic opened, the world is very different, and the movement for reproductive self-determination has had a profound impact. However, sexuality educators across the country are again muzzled.  During its first several decades, Planned Parenthood education programs focused on contraception for married couples. In the 1960s, however, with the introduction of the birth control pill and evolving social movements for civil rights, sexual liberation, and equal rights for women and homosexuals, our sexuality educators broadened their focus to encompass these issues. Public discourse about sexual issues flourished throughout the 1970s.  In the 1980s, with the AIDS pandemic, interest in and funding for sexuality education (about HIV in particular) significantly increased. But while the symptoms of HIV disease were just becoming a public concern in 1981, the Adolescent Family Life Act (AFLA) was introduced in Congress by Jeremiah Denton. As mandated by the law, AFLA's early grants went almost exclusively to far-right and religious groups. Much of the funding was used to develop the first generation of so-called fear-based curricula such as Sex Respect and Teen Aid, which relied on scare tactics to promote abstinence. They often distorted information related to the effectiveness of contraceptive and disease prevention methods. In 1983 the ACLU brought a lawsuit, charging that the AFLA was funding programs that, in some settings, violated the doctrine of separation of church and state. After 10 years of litigation, the Kendrick v. Sullivan settlement guarded against overtly sectarian programs. This funding stream continues today, but it has been rewritten to ensure that programs funded under it comply with stringent guidance developed for the more onerous 1996 welfare reform law.   In a 1992 local battle over abstinence curricula, the suit Planned Parenthood of Northeast Florida v. Duval County School Board was filed, with seven families and Planned Parenthood of Northeast Florida (PPNEF) in Florida state court. Florida law required all public school students, grades kindergarten through 12, to receive accurate, complete, and philosophically neutral instruction on human reproduction, pregnancy prevention, and reduction of the risk of sexually transmitted disease. Therefore, Planned Parenthood argued that Jacksonville's school board failed to provide sexuality education that met the standards of Florida's comprehensive health education laws. The Duval County School Board, however, chose to adopt for its seventh grade the fear based curriculum titled Me, My World, My Future, published by Teen Aid, Inc. of Spokane, Washington. Intervening on behalf of Teen Aid were Pat Robertson's attorneys, the American Center for Law and Justice. The plaintiff families won several pre-trial motions, but before going to trial, a political solution was forged. In September 1994, the school board member who had been the biggest proponent of Teen Aid was defeated, leaving a school board majority that supported responsible, balanced sexuality education. A community task force was appointed to develop a new, comprehensive K-12 curriculum. This task force included representatives from both sides of the controversy, who together developed a balanced curriculum that was adopted officially in 1996. The lawsuit was then dropped.  1996 was also the year that conservative members of Congress quietly inserted language into legislation designed to overhaul the nation's welfare system. This language – section 510 of the Social Security Act – guaranteed $50 million annually over five years beginning in fiscal year 1998 for abstinence-only education grants to the states. In addition to that amount, states that accept the Title V funding must provide a three dollar "match" for every four dollars of federal funding, meaning that $37.5 million more is spent each year on abstinence-only-until-marriage in the states. A program funded with this money must adhere to the federal definition of abstinence.  Special Projects of Regional and National Significance program (SPRANS), funded through the maternal and child health block grant, directly finances community-based organizations. SPRANS sponsored programs differ from section 510 in at least three significant ways: programs must target adolescents aged 12-18; they must teach all components of the eight-point definition; and, in most cases, they cannot provide young people in SPRANS programs with information about contraception or safer-sex practices -- even in settings that are not funded by SPRANS.  Does it Work?  No comprehensive scientifically valid evaluations to date have demonstrated that this approach has made any difference in the number of young people who delay intercourse until marriage. Thus far, over half a billion public dollars have been spent on these unproven programs, with the result being that there are areas of the country where young people do not get medically accurate information about condoms, contraception, or a wide range of other topics appropriate to healthy sexual development.  The environment in which Planned Parenthood and other organizations is working has become increasingly polarized around public discourse about sexuality--the discussion often centers on whether or not a program promotes abstinence, rather than whether or not it promotes sexual health. Research conducted by the Alan Guttmacher Institute (AGI) demonstrates that although more than nine in 10 public school teachers believe that students should be taught about contraception (and half believe that contraception should be taught in grade seven or earlier), one in four are instructed not to teach the subject. While the vast majority of teachers also believe that sexuality education courses should cover where to go for birth control, information about abortion, the correct way to use a condom, and sexual orientation, far fewer actually cover these topics.  As a result, Planned Parenthood clinicians in Waco, Texas, for instance, report a profound disconnect with their young clients. When teenage girls come in for pregnancy tests, they are counseled to use condoms in addition to other methods of contraception. The counselor suggests that condoms are helpful for reducing the risk of contracting a sexually transmitted infection (STI). These sexually experienced girls say, “Oh, no thanks. We learned in school that they don’t really work anyway.”  Educators report that they may be invited into the school to do “the lecture on pregnancy prevention,” but that they are asked to avoid talking about condoms. In some school districts struggling to offer students a balanced sexuality education, the contortions include inviting a (publicly-funded abstinence-only) crisis pregnancy counselor to teach about puberty, and then bringing the Planned Parenthood educator in the next day to present “the other side.”  Many of the programs that Planned Parenthood provides are often meant to prevent unintended pregnancy and STIs. Some programs do have these outcomes – notably the affiliates that have replicated Michael Carrera’s comprehensive, long-term program developed with the Children’s Aid Society. These programs have been shown to delay intercourse and increase protected intercourse at sexual debut, among other positive effects. Several Planned Parenthood affiliates have also replicated programs that the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) have identified as “programs that work” to reduce the risk of STIs; among them, “Reducing the Risk,” “Be Proud, Be Responsible,” and “Safer Choices.” However, at the direction of Congress, the CDC has recently discontinued the “programs that work” initiative and is considering a new process that is “more responsive to changing needs and concerns of state and local education and health agencies and community organizations.” Currently 48 of these proven programs are fully replicated at Planned Parenthood affiliates.  Looking toward the Future   Taking the long view, Planned Parenthood developed a vision for how we would like the world to be in the year 2025. One of our bold goals is to “ensure that sexuality is understood as an essential lifelong aspect of being human, and that it is celebrated with respect, openness, and mutuality.” Part of achieving that goal is to develop a social marketing initiative that will normalize mature public talk about sexuality. Over time, our hope is that our community-based education and training programs, coupled with advertising and public relations activities will help Americans to speak up for sexual health in ways that are mature and respectful, and lead to a healthier society. We want to normalize public talk about sexuality that is authentic rather than polarizing. This vision is entirely consistent with former Surgeon General Dr. David Satcher’s Call to Action to Promote Sexual Health and Responsible Sexual Behavior. We are taking seriously that document, with community forums to discuss appropriate local responses to his Call to Action.  Educators in the field believe that responsible sexuality education should provide accurate information. It should provide a context for understanding personal values about sexuality. It should help people to develop the social skills they need to resist pressure to engage in unwanted sexual activity as well as the skills to create satisfying relationships. Finally, sexuality education should help individuals to behave responsibly -- protecting themselves and their sex partners from the negative outcomes of sexual behavior.   Too often, the focus is only on the last goal. What we have learned from the evaluations of existing sexuality education, teenage pregnancy prevention, and HIV prevention programs is that they can be successful. Research conducted for the National Campaign to Prevent Teen Pregnancy, for instance, has shown the benefits of a variety of programs that have had an impact on the sexual behavior of young people. The positive outcomes can include increasing knowledge, clarifying values, increasing parent-child communication, helping young people to delay intercourse, and increasing the use of contraceptives and condoms. The evidence also indicates that these programs do not increase the likelihood that young people will begin intercourse or increase the frequency of intercourse for sexually active youth.  As we develop or replicate programs, to solve a problem or to promote sexual health, we have a profound need for more and better research into the antecedents of healthy behaviors and the most effective ways to support young people’s healthy sexual development. We seek strategic alliances and partnerships with those who share our vision. We hope to engage the research community and other sexuality education providers in order to ensure that sexuality is understood as an essential lifelong aspect of being human, and that it is celebrated with respect, openness, and mutuality. We need to create a safe and public place for mature discussions about sexuality and health.   As Dr. Satcher has said, “We cannot remain complacent. Doing nothing is unacceptable. Our efforts not only will have an impact on the current health status of our citizens, but will lay a foundation for a healthier society in the future.”  * Michael McGee, C.S.T., is the Vice President of Education and Social Marketing at Planned Parenthood Federation of America.

      Condom Warnings   Derrick Wilkerson   May 9, 2004   Indianapolis -- Using a condom during sex doesn't provide complete protection against sexually transmitted diseases. President Bush wants the warning on condom labels to include language about a virus called H-P-V. H-P-V is a virus that causes cervical cancer.  Gayla McCord says she contracted H-P-V from her ex-husband nine years ago, "At the time that I was diagnosed with HPV and I'm thinking cancer...If I was gonna die he was going with me."  Doctors from the Marion County Health Department say condoms reduce the risk of cervical cancer. However, several strains of H-P-V and herpes can still be transmitted from skin to skin contact even when condoms are used during sex.  Gayla McCord manages two websites that support and warn potential victims. The are www.herpesonline.org and wartsonline.org.  Copyright © 2004, WXIN-TV, Indianapolis

      I don't know about every other parent but personally I HATE Yu-Gi-Oh. Those cards are a waste of money, time and energy! Especially mine! For some reason every single time those cards come out they cast a spell-like curse on mine and my husbands kids. They encourage fighting, yelling, cheating, deception and more.  I am beginning to wonder if this is not some sort of foreign conspiracy to create dysfunction in otherwise peaceful American households?  I have seriously considered starting Yu-Gi-Oh Anonymous for anyone who suffers from such a curse. Or better yet, how about American Parents get together and create a card game to send to Japan that might wreck havoc on the households of those who create Yu-Gi-Oh. Then again, those twits probably don't have children and have nothing better to do than set around and plot their next strategy.  If you are anything like me and have complaints against Yu-Gi-Oh I would suggest complaining to the person responsible for bringing this War in a Deck Box to the States.    urlLink  Upper Deck Entertainment Link   and

      My Grandpa and Grandma  urlLink       This is my grandpa and grandma.  When I was very small I spent a great deal of time with them due to my older brother being so ill.   There were many a night that I would have my grandma brush my hair and tell me about the time when she and grandpa met.  Grandma was working in an old time fountain shop when a sailor walked in off the street one day.  There was no conversation exchanged other than the typical, ordering, paying and leaving.  When grandpa walked out the door my grandmother turned to her friend and said, "That's the man I am going to marry."  Later that day grandma went and broke off her existing engagement and waited a very long 6 months or so till that sailor would come back in town.  He did and they dated a very short time and married.  They were married 54 years when grandpa passed away.  Prior to this he had survived 7 heart attacks and even World War II.  They had five children including my mother.  The night he passed away I was there.  I stood back in the corner of their room almost feeling as if the space around grandpa's hospital bed was sacred space and should not be disturbed.  I heard my grandma and grandpa whispering to each other a bit and then I heard grandma lean over and say, "it's ok, you can go now."  Within a couple of minutes my grandfather was gone.  This was a man that held onto his beloved even through his own pains.  He could not and would not leave her until she assured him she would be ok.  He was always so concerned that my aunts would place my grandmother in a nursing home and take all she had left in this world.  Grandpa was an intuitive man because that's exactly what they did.  Today my grandmother lives in a nursing home dying a slow, painful and very lonely death.  She doesn't remember much, whether that is drug induced or otherwise, she hasn't much memory of the greatest love story I have ever known.   In honor of my grandparents and the inspiration they were to so many hoping for a love like that.....I wanted to archive their tale so it will carry on, even after I am gone, or so I would hope.

       urlLink    What makes me feel Patriotic   With the 4th of July Holiday approaching, feelings of patriotism begin to bubble up inside me.  While setting out on my porch today after the morning showers had passed, I looked across the road at the rolling fields of those amber waves of grain.  I realized just how much living in the heartland really means to me.  At times I may joke about the small town I live near and all the conveniences we lack out here in the middle of this wonderful heartland, but by that same token I have conveniences that can never be replaced by having a 7-11 on the nearest street corner so when the gas gauge is running low or we are about to pour out our last bit of milk on the morning cereal.  I may not have the conveniences of running through a drive-thru to pick up dinner on the way home, but what I do have is the convenience of opening the door and having my kids go to the barn to fetch the extra two eggs I need to make a batch of homemade brownies.  We don't have the traffic and people hustling by in such a hurry to get their next lunch date or rushing to get to their kids soccer game in hopes of catching the last 10 minutes just so they don't feel bad and can say at least they were there.  What we do have is an occasional farmer puttering down the road in his tractor getting to his next bit of spraying of plowing, but if he doesn't get it done before his kids baseball game starts, that's fine, he can leave it safely in the field and return to it when the more important things in life are tended to.  There are some things that I have often taken for granted out here in my sometimes boring but slow life, then all the sudden a friend from a few states away draws my attention to the birds and tree frog she hears chirping because the sun has decided to peak through for the latter part of this day.  It is those times that I realize just how convenient it is here in the middle of nowhere.  It's convenient to walk out the door and let the breeze caress my cheeks as I listen off in the distance to a world that's not in a hurry to get anywhere, because they are right where they want to be, Home among the fruited plains.

      Having been on disability, my husband sought the help of Rush County to lower his  child   support  only briefly.  Seven months after the process began, my husband is told that Rush County is backed up to January of 2002 NOT 2003 on their paperwork and that due to the fact that it is not in the best interest of the children he would have to file more paperwork, hire an attorney and appear before the judge.  Hmmm makes you wonder how they expect him to do ALL that one $12.17 per week!   Rush County Indiana  is NOT a Great Place to live.  No wonder  Tony Stewart  got out!!!  My recommendation is if you are thinking of moving to Indiana, unless you are a Rocket Scientist or a Brain Surgeon - DON'T!!!

      Personally I believe that EVERY Person who takes an oath of office should have their children drafted into the armed forces *Immediately* upon taking their political position.  Nothing else seems to force them into making decisions with the families of America in mind, so perhaps that would be the ticket!  Do you think they would have been so quick to send so many of our men to Vietnam, Desert Storm (we'd have probably got the twerp the first time if that'd been the case) and every conflict since if their own children had been holding up the frontlines?  I think NOT and if so, then it would Proven just where their head and hearts were?  On American Families or in their own pockets!  Just my two cents :)  Gayla

      Here in Indiana, wading through the classified ads looking for a job that will both pay for child care, pay for groceries, car, gas and health care is nearly impossible. I wonder in amazement IF WE are expected to stretch a $7 an hour job THAT far, why not put a few of US in the White House to balance the budget. If I can balance mine.....  Indiana has always been a thriving state thanks to automotive industry and the blue collar jobs that we held. Over the last few years we have watched our jobs go south of the boarder while our friends south of the boarder come here to take what little jobs are left. Where is the since in that? Now there is talk of bringing a Technology Park to the very site where an Industrial Park now exists? In a near 100% blue collar town? WHY??????? So my neighbors will be forced to fork out yet another expense to gain a college education in order to have a job where they live?  I am a mother of two and stepmother of two. I have worked from home for nearly 6 years and have raised my own boys from the age of 4 to 11 BY MYSELF.  urlLink I was PROUD that I was able to stay at home  with them and instill MY Morals and Standards in them. I never wanted a child care facility to raise my children, they have absolutely NO INTEREST in the adults they will become. Recently because of budgeting concerns my job was axed.  Budgeting concerns? Perhaps, but it was found that they could hire "visitor's" for less than half of my worth.  My grandfather, the Diehard Democrat that he was always told me that in this life you have two things you can count on - Paying Taxes and Dying. I am realizing more and more just how right my grandfather was.  I certainly hope in the coming years we see a change. After all the wealthy folks may have the money to support campaigns but in the end isn't it the votes that count?  Grassroots campaigns may be more beneficial And from what I see there are far more of us poor folks than there are wealthy folks

      As for Child Support? I always thought the State of Indiana had it out for single mothers who were trying to do "the right thing" when they did not provide assistance in securing child support payments from my ex husband.   My journey began Sept. 11 - the day of the dreaded attacks on our U.S. soil (how could I EVER forget the date?). My Prosecutor's office promised to help. Well here we are nearly 3 years later and I have received a whopping $1000 of the near $30,000 that is owed my children.   I have the most beautiful, well mannered twin boys, age 11, you'd ever want to see. Why on earth their father wants nothing to do with them is beyond me. Well not really, I refer to it as a sickness - The Brown Bottle Flu!  All I EVER asked for was a flat $100 per week for two kids. I took care of insurance, medical, clothes, etc. I just wanted OUT!  Perhaps that comedian wasn't so far off base when he suggested placing Dead Beat Parents Photos on Beer Labels.  On the flip side of that coin,  urlLink my new husband  (as of November 2003) has paid child support religiously for four years. Even when the laws say he is entitled to reduced child support (i.e. summer vacations - he keeps them nearly ALL summer).   He was injured mid December 2003 and had major surgery in mid March 2004. Since January 2004 he has tried to receive the help in getting the reduction the state promised him. The fruits of our courts labors are yet to be seen. My husband makes a whopping $250 a week. By the time child support and the REQUIRED Health Insurance for the children is taken out he comes home with $12.17.   When we phoned the courthouse to enquire about the status we were told that they are backed up on paperwork to January 2002 NOT 2003!!!! There is NO way his child support is going to get adjusted and he cannot return to work for yet another 1.5 months.  In Indiana Child Support Laws benefit ONLY Dead Beat Parents. My husband and I are walking talking breathing proof.  Honestly, WHAT can be done?  Hey if the White House needs their budget balance, gimme a shot. If I can balance mine, I am sure I could put a big dent on the positive side of the National Debt.

      Speaking of Healthcare - My "job" has been to be a voice for those living with a sexually transmitted disease.  urlLink I AM a Herpes Patient Advocate  and Proud of it! Once I was ashamed but this is something that I got in the divorce, NO choice of my own.  Almost daily I speak to people in both physical and emotional pain because they cannot afford suppressive therapy.  urlLink Suppressive therapy  WOULD reduce the risk of transmission by as much as 75% (according to the data) but according to my own study IN the Herpes World, I believe the percentages to be MUCH higher.  My Peers cannot afford proper healthcare and prescriptions that are needed to insure both physical recovery as well as emotional. From my own experience, herpes provides a much stronger emotional attack than a physical one. It certainly doesn't help matters when such shows as Leno and The View are allowed to publicly make fun of and torment those with Herpes. I certainly wish someone would realize that we should have the same respect and consideration that those with HIV have.   Although Herpes is not life threatening it IS life altering as are HPV and HIV - Which by the way none of the three are part of STD Screening! Not in the Armed Forces, not during pregnancy and not upon a simple request of a "complete screen" they MUST be asked for and signed for INDIVIDUALLY!   Another note about Healthcare  - My Mother was injured while working at Homeland Security! Her supervisor told her to stand on a bucket that she "didn't have time to get the ladder." As a result my mother fell, shattered her knee and has since undergone three surgeries and has a 50% reduction of use of that knee. She was a contract employee so that is the leg that is being used for their standing. With an attorney she is being offered a completely insane $30,000 as full compensation releasing them of their responsibility to her leg which now has a full knee replacement.  My mother was making in excess of $70,000 per year at the time of the accident and they want to release her with less than HALF compensation and no responsibility Knowing she cannot get another job making that anywhere near that amount especially in THIS Job Market!   As the result my mother may have to move back into Canada (My stepfather is a dual citizen). As the result she would not only lose use of her leg because of the accident that forced the move, but this grandmother would also lose the opportunity to watch her only grandchildren growing up, playing their baseball games, the many nights they spend at grammy's house. Just how much can any one person have taken from them that HELPED provide security for our Entire Country?????  I think that about covers all of my vents for today. If only one of the things I addressed could be improved I wish it would be that my mother could stay close. I lost my brother to a stroke, I don't want to lose any time with my mother that I may later regret.

Most of which was very enjoyable, but that old Murphy's Law was in full affect - lemme' tell ya!   urlLink The Indy Gathering  went off very well!  The numbers were smaller, but enjoyable just the same.  Saw many old friends and made a few new ones.

I will close on my first loan this next week!  Yippeeeee!!!!  While learning my new job, my old computer decided it was time to pass on into the Microsoft afterlife.

      Two boys arrested for setting friend ablaze  Greenwood-area incident leaves 15-year-old boy in drug-induced coma with severe burns to his upper body.    urlLink   Star report     July 21, 2004&nbsp;  Two Greenwood-area boys -- curious about what it would be like to run with their clothing ablaze -- have been arrested after a companion was critically burned.  White River Township Fire Marshal Eric Brown arrested the 15-year-old boys Sunday and Monday.  Thomas Jefferson, 15, remained in critical condition at Riley Hospital for Children with severe burns to his upper body. Doctors put him into a drug-induced coma, with breathing assistance from a ventilator.  "He is expected to remain in this condition for at least three weeks," Brown said.  Johnson County sheriff's deputies and Fire Department investigators went to the 4300 block of Mahogany Drive about 10:30 p.m. on July 5. Brown led the investigation.  "All three of the boys were willing participants," Brown said Tuesday of the incident.  The boys had tried to ignite their own clothing with cigarette lighters, Brown said. When that failed, one boy suggested using gasoline to assist.  "One of the boys went to the garage and got the gasoline and poured it on the victim's shirt," Brown said.  Thomas Jefferson put the shirt on, and the shirt was ignited.

      An Internet auction for the Web site www.kerryedwards.com failed to attract the $150,000 minimum bid sought by the Indianapolis man who owns it.  The site became a hot property after Democratic presidential candidate John Kerry named John Edwards as his running mate.  It has belonged to 34-year-old Kerry Edwards since March 2002, when he registered the name to post family photographs.  After Kerry, a senator from Massachusetts, named Sen. Edwards, of North Carolina, as his vice presidential pick, Kerry Edwards decided to try to sell the prophetic Web address through the online auction company Sedo.com. The sale was set to conclude at midnight Saturday.  But Keith Watson, who handles public relations for the firm that specializes in selling Internet domain names, said Sunday that no sale had transpired. Watson said he knew no other details.  Edwards, a local bail bondsman, did not return calls Sunday. In a previous interview with The Indianapolis Star, he said the site got 51,000 hits the day Kerry named Edwards as his running mate and that he had been offered $30,000 for the site.  Mike Harmless, Indiana chairman for the Kerry campaign, said he is not aware of the campaign having any interest in the Web site at this point.  "Obviously kerryedwards.com would be a great Web site," he said.  "But with the amount of effort, enthusiasm and excitement that has built around JohnKerry.com, I don't think anyone would want to switch with just a few months to go until the election."  Harmless said Kerry's Web site has been in place since last year. Kerry urged people to log on to it during his acceptance speech last week at the Democratic National Convention.  Terry Burns, spokesman for the state Democratic Party, said he hasn't heard any local interest in the site, either.  Sunday night, the Sedo.com Web site no longer listed kerryedwards.com for sale, but it was offering kerryedwards1.com, kerryandedwards2004.com and several other variations with no posted minimum bids.

       First of all I resent ANYONE who categorizes all people with  urlLink   herpes    as being promiscuous. All it takes is ONE time of having sex. And that is something we have all done.  I don't care how many different ways people try to sugar coat it or how many times they try to justify their having herpes. I personally believe that contracting herpes from a toilet seat is Extremely rare if even at all possible.  The person who wrote this letter is likely getting away with extramarital affairs and has a naive spouse if the spouse honestly believes this bogus story.  Each one teach one. It's the ONLY way to bring the truth about  urlLink   STD's    to the forefront.

      Herpes virus takes strange paths I am very disappointed in a recent column about getting herpes from a toilet seat. The herpes simplex virus does not live outside the body and needs direct skin-to-skin contact to spread. It is impossible to get it from a toilet seat.  A recent study found that one in four people had genital herpes, but only 12 percent knew they were infected. That means the majority had no clue that they had it and could spread it. Most people attributed their symptoms to some other problem.  Medical wisdom maintains that a clean, dry toilet seat cannot transmit herpes or any other infection to intact skin. But not all toilet seats are clean and dry.  Several readers, like this one, contacted us to insist they contracted infections from gym equipment or unsanitary facilities: "At my gym there are many men and women who are models with great bodies. Quite a few of these people have herpes from being promiscuous.  "These men shave their legs, arms, underarms, butts and even pubic hair at the gym in the shower. You said intact skin and a dry toilet seat are safe. But you don't have that in many health clubs. Shaving is an abrasive action and often produces bleeding. I have seen guys shave and jump out of the shower and use the toilet. "I am a power-lifter and do squats with as much weight as possible. Sometimes I shave from my knees to my thighs to tape my thighs before working out. One day I showered and dried off and went to the toilet, but the seat was wet. I took a towel and wiped it, but a few weeks later I had a rash. My doctor diagnosed it as herpes and prescribed Valtrex. The rash was gone in three days.  "I have been married for 25 years to my high-school sweetheart and have never even considered cheating on her. How could I explain this? Luckily my doc asked us a lot of very personal questions and said it was very likely I got it from the gym."
