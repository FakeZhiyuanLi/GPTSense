      This will be the last entry till the next time when i come home from camp. i guess i will miss those i care for and love and i hope that while i am gone, they make a possitive change in their lives. Guys i wish you all the best and i want you to know that i love you guys. i hope to see you soon. And If there are those who are down and depressed, go listen to a song called "That Thing You Do" by The Wonders. it worked very much for me. Frankly i leave in tears as it is hard to part with you guys but i guess i have to do my part which i had promised someone a long time ago, to work hard and try to make decent money for the family. Although we are no more together, it is just something that i have to do. Pray for me felles. Keep the faith.    Russel Watson - Where My Heart Will Take Me  (Theme from TV series Enterprise, also known as Faith Of the Heart)  Lyrics by Diane Warren   It's been a long road, getting from there to here.  It's been a long time, but my time is finally near.  And I can feel the change in the wind right now. Nothing's in my way.  And they're not gonna hold me down no more, no they're not gonna hold me down.   Cause I've got faith of the heart.  I'm going where my heart will take me.  I've got faith to believe. I can do anything.  I've got strength of the soul. And no one's gonna bend or break me.  I can reach any star. I've got faith, faith of the heart.   It's been a long night. Trying to find my way.  Been through the darkness. Now I finally have my day.  And I will see my dream come alive at last. I will touch the sky.  And they're not gonna hold me down no more, no they're not gonna change my mind.   Cause I've got faith of the heart.  I'm going where my heart will take me.  I've got faith to believe. I can do anything.  I've got strength of the soul. And no one's gonna bend or break me.  I can reach any star. I've got faith, faith of the heart.   I've known the wind so cold, I've seen the darkest days.  But now the winds I feel, are only winds of change.  I've been through the fire and I've been through the rain.  But I'll be fine ...   Cause I've got faith of the heart.  I'm going where my heart will take me.  I've got faith to believe. I can do anything.  I've got strength of the soul. And no one's gonna bend or break me.  I can reach any star. I've got faith, faith of the heart.   Cause I've got faith of the heart.  I'm going where my heart will take me.  I've got faith to believe. I can do anything.  I've got strength of the soul. And no one's gonna bend or break me.  I can reach any star. I've got faith, faith of the heart.

      Once again, i sit on this chair in this stale room just wanting to write something yet i do not have any idea what i am going to write about. i think to myself, why am i awake and not treasuring whatever sleep i can get before i go to camp where i have to sleep on a bed which i appernetly "inherited" from the last man that slept on that very bed. This bed will stay with me as long as i am in this camp or at least i think so. Listening to the music that i am playing on my playlist pushes my mind to my beautiful place. A place that i had dreamt of quite awhile ago and i remember the sweet smell of fresh dew and the lush green grass and the sweet scent of the flowers. The singing children never seem to grow weary of their joyous songs running around a great big tree which has no shadow. The sun shines so bright in the sky, shining at every nook and cranning letting no shadow ever take form. Yet as bright as the sun is it does not hinder my eyes and blemishes my skin. The winds blow and i can hear the wind whisper to me and i seem to understand of what she speaks of. The leaves join in the childrens' song and the flowers dance in the wind but although she blows, it never gets cold. Everything seems so complicated and unnatural but a part in me does not bother and i slowly let down my guard as a little boy leads me by the hand and we run and run through the lands and past many rivers but we never grow tired. And at last we reach the sea and i look into the water which is so clear and the sand so soft and i sit. the dream ended ther but in my mind i would not forget. how can i possibly forget something so beautiful and then i think of the many things in my life thats beauty has been marred. i guess my dreams are my hope and aspirations. Something that is there to keep me standing and picking myself up as i fall. i want to share my dream with many but there are the critics. i want to share the dream yet i find it of too much significance and i only want to share it with one. But i guess these are the things that will unfold by itself and i should not bother too much about it which might cause to destroy everything i believe in once again..

      As i sit in my dark-stale room, i cant help but think how time has passed by so fast and army is just one day away. i start to think of my friends and family and how things would change outside without my knowing therefore many thoughts run through my head and slowly i come to feel a mix of hope and paranoia. i cannot comprehend how i can make something so simple seem so wrong leaving no room for effort and chance, always botherind myself with the unconsequencial yet many things that are not might be tommorrow and i worry. Sometimes i pray for a ray of light that might shine upon the darkness that surrounds me but that is the one thing that i fear the most. Most of the time i prefer to hide in the shaodows, the shadows of others therefore leaving me unseen, unnoticed and many a time all alone. In this loneliness i find a resting place and comfort in my plight but then again this darkness consumes me and i come to find that i have walked round the mountain and back again making no possitive change and only making another entry for negetivity. Many things that many has told me and i remember but what i do not understand is how can these things be accomplished? Although at the back of my mind i know i have done what i could but i still want to push myself forward and far beyond the expectations that anyone can set for me. i have longed to be recognised as someone who is capable and not the failure that i am known to be. i come to realise that this longing, this hope are but dreams as i sleep and to ever achieve such "status" is like seeing jesus coming and lifting me up and he whispers these words into my ear,"we are going home." But then maybe one day, someday something good might come to be and i shall smile again once more.

       &nbsp; It has been awhile of pain, agony and horible nightmares and the light, the little glimpse of hope which i had always held on had shone its blessing on me and brought me someone to bring me through. It seems that i have found my comfort zone. My little place of rest or a time for me to think about the good times and be comforted for the tribulation that has befelled me. I have prayed for this, prayed till the skin on my knees and torn, bled and hardened. My fingers locked together numb and there is almost no more strenth for me to rejoice but there is still one more prayer. The prayer&nbsp;of thanks.

       &nbsp; After booking in, i had spent the entire night listening to nice but depressing songs play on the vcd walkman that has been hooked up to the television that is in the bunk that i sleep in and that is probably the place that i will be sleeping in for the next&nbsp;two years.   &nbsp;&nbsp; As i listen to the music, i see flashbacks of my life. I see the times that i drank with friends and made merry and i see the times that i drank in a desperate attempt to drown all my thoughts. I sat there just thinking of how i would have been so pitiful if i wasnt so pathetic.  &nbsp; I did not want to do it but it was something that i had done a long time ago and as far as i remember i liked it. I picked up my knife and cut myself and as i watched the blood ooze out and as it flows out, i took out a cigarette to soak up the blood and i found that cigarettes look better red than white. I lit it and drew its first cloud of smoke that filled my lungs and as i exhaled, i tasted somehting in the cigarette.

      Push my fingers into my eyes... It's the only thing that slowly stops the ache... But it's made of all the things I am today... Jesus, it never ends, it works it's way inside...If the pain goes on... Aaaaaaaah!   I have screamed until my veins collapsed I've waited last, my time's elapsed Now, All I do is live with so much fate I've wished for this,  I've bitched at that I've left behind this little fact:You cannot kill what you did not create I've gotta say what I've gotta say And then I swear I'll go away But I can't promise you'll enjoy the lines I guess I'll save the best for last My future seems like on big past You'll live with me 'cause you left me no choice   I push my fingers into my eyes It's the only thing that slowly stops the acheIf the pain goes on,I'm not gonna make it!   Pull me back together I'll seperate the skin from the bone Leave me all the Pieces, and then you can leave me alone Tell me the reality is better than dream But I found out the hard way, Nothing is what it seems!   I push my fingers into my eyes It's the only thing that slowly stops the ache But it's made of all the things I am today Jesus, it never ends, it works it's way inside If the pain goes on, I'm not gonna make it!   All I've got...all I've got is insane... All I've got...all I've got is insane... All I've got...all I've got is insane! All I've got...all I've got is insane!   I push my fingers into my eyes It's the only thing that slowly stops the ache But it's made of all the thing I am today Jesus, it never ends, it works it's way inside If the pain goes on, I'm not gonna make it!&nbsp; &nbsp;

      I had a dream which nearly cost me very dearly. A beautiful dream which my mind had turned into a complete nightmare.   A beautiful dream of beauty, freedom, family and most of all love. i remember a white dress with only abit of colour keeping innocence and restoring happiness. Long orangy-brown hair, black piercing eyes and a smile that i for one cannot forget and smooth soft skin with a slight tann.   Suddenly her wounds hurt and start to open  her two feathered wings are torn and broken  her halo is but a needle hole  the flowers die as the cold winds blow  her two little legs lift off the ground  the tombs open and the bodies are bound  their bone white skulls scream all so loud  over their heads a little black cloud  Every Beginning Has An End  Thats Just The Way We Are Made.....We Are Men.   I got into a scuffle back at camp and there was so much shit going on and before i knew it i was in the medical centre waiting to go to the hospital. They thought that i was a basket case and well.. i was dropped out of course and now i join my Company HQ doing admin and some work in the store. I have come to learn alot of things and one of them is that there is one big problem in my life that is causing so many things that has gone wrong and the answer is me.

      It had been two weeks since i met her and i started to find it hard to convince myself that there was love in the relationship at all. There was a enormous blackhole eating me from the inside and everything seems to be unstable. It seems the good things that has been happeneing to me lately were but dreams and maybe false hope. Or maybe it was just not the right one. I have once again found myself making something perfect beyond perfect. This time there were modifications. I never demanded anything from her, i always raced to take out my wallet and i have paid for everything as long as i was with her with the exception of one time in a taxi where she smartly occupied me with carrying her stuff and therefore when the taxi stopped, she already had her money out. I did everything i could to shower her with the uttmost love and affection and gave her all the freedom that she wanted. I never wanted to consrict her or tie her down lest i lose her but now i have decided that i lose her. I felt very much that she never wanted to meet me and she was just with me to occupy her mind as at that point in time, she had someone on her mind but now she is strong and she has gotten over it. These are but mere assumptions on my part and i know it is wrong as i am not trusting her but i guess some things about me do not change. I always need that speacial someone to push me and guide me. The someone to hold my hand as the sun rises and kiss me as it sets. Someone to tend to my wounds should i hurt myself. Someone to breathe life into me when everything seems meaningless.  I guess the search continues and only with time more things will unfold and sort out.
