       urlLink http://www.registerguard.com/news/2004/07/31/d1.cr.lithiakidnap.0731.html    So this guy walks into a dealership in town here and he pulls a gun on a dealer over some bad financing that his daughter got when she signed for a car the other day.  My job has something to do with financing and loan dealie things. I hear from dealers and customers all the time. I'm not defending all dealers because I know of many bad ones across the country but pulling a gun on someone to solve a problem?  Hello!!!  Hey, dumbass....reality check here! Your daughter should not have gone in and signed for a car by herself if she was gonna whine about it to you later on because she felt she got screwed and BTW, it wasn't like SHE had the gun to her head to sign anything! Why is it so hard to just get up and walk away?!?! This isn't rocket science here. It's just common sense. If you don't think you are getting a good deal, don't pick up the pen and sign!! I've lost track of how many phone calls I get about someone who felt they got screwed by the dealer because they didn't read over their entire contract. It's in writing. You are supposed to get a copy of what you signed to take with you when you leave the showroom. You should not go home and whine that you got a bum deal. TOUGH SHIT. Maybe you'll learn a valuable lesson and some damn personal responsibilty. It's no one's fault but your own, genius.       urlLink   urlLink   urlLink   urlLink

      I refuse to devote my blog to my weight. By doing so, I would be giving it more power than it deserves. My weight does not define me. Or at least that's what I tell myself. In reality, it is who I am every second of the day. It seems like 90% of the decisions I make are based on my weight.   "I can't buy those heels-           My fat ankles won't be supported by them!"   "I can't buy that candy bar-           The check-out clerk will look at me funny!"   "I can't work out at a REAL gym-           There's no REAL bodies working out in there!"   "I can't fit in those student desks-           I won't be able to breath till class is over!"  It's been like this since fourth grade. That’s 18 years of my life as a fat chick. Oh the stories I could tell. Oh, the tears I could cry again and again. I don’t remember every single day, every single funny comment, look, or gesture. Basically it all runs together in one giant blob (ha!) of painful emotions. It’s impacted my life in ways that I have only begun to explore. I wonder how much of my depression can be attributed to my weight and my self-image? I wonder how much of my love life is affected by it? I wonder if I would have a different personality if I were skinny? Would I be the funny girl with the funky, second hand shop wardrobe that struts her funkiness everywhere and doesn’t care what others think of her? Would I be the cute little redhead with freckles who waits tables and has a perfectly smooth apron tied around her tiny waist? Would I be the outgoing girl who wears gap halter-tops and loves to sit in the sun? Who would I be if I were skinny? If only…if only… if only…  I started Atkins last year with J****. Both of us were ready for some kind of change. I was at my highest ever and I was feeling it in every step I took, every stare I got, and every single thing I ate. I started slowly, just focusing on what I was eating, not following Atkins perfectly but trying to consciously think about the types of foods I was eating and what I was putting my mouth, how it tastes and how it felt. I found out that I really hated McDonald’s food (although I still slip in a nasty breakfast burrito every other month or so). I found that I love the feel of fresh fruit on my tongue. After I cut out regular soda completely and trying to have a glass or 2 of it since then, it has come to taste so sweet and syrup-like that I can’t finish even a can of it (I think I should have had stock in Coca-cola for all those years I bought it by the case-load). I lost 30 pounds in 4 months with very little exercise.   But Christmas came and with it, a trip home to my mother’s cooking and all the comfort foods that I love and then Valentines day (with the wonderful juju hearts stocked in the bulk section at the supermarket) and my first semester at the University (with ample amounts of Chai tea and heavenly oatmeal raisin cookies) and the subsequent harder semester (with a wonderful substitute for juju hearts- nummy bears) and I gained 10 pounds back by May.   I knew I had to get back to eating better. My basic diet still consisted of healthy items. I stuck to the outer ring of the grocery store where the fruits, vegetables, meats, and dairy are all kept. I didn’t go back to Hungry-Man dinners (I’m surprised that those didn’t give me a heart attack!). I had gained a few good habits from my initial success and when you think about it, that’s what weight loss is all about- good habits that you must maintain the rest of your life in order to be healthy and look healthy.   The day after I talked to T*** for the first time in four years, I found the motivation I was looking for to continue losing weight. That also seems to be a big factor in losing weight and finding success with it- there has to be an internal will to want to do so… and in my case…I want it real bad! I want to go back to Madison skinnier than when I left and I want to show T*** and everyone else all the changes that have taken place over the last two years of my life out here. I AM a changed person. But I know that some of those inner changes are not detectable in short visits. That’s why I needed something on the outside to get the point across (only ugly people say “beauty is only skin deep”)  As of two weeks ago, I have lost 50.5 pounds total (and yes, I have earned that half pound so it will be counted) I have lost a small child from my middle! Halleluiah! What I really wanted to devote today’s blog to was the fact that none of my coworkers seemed to notice. Wouldn’t you notice if someone lost several inches of hair, or had a boob job or took Viagra (Did you get a raise Bob? Nope, my Johnson did though!). Would you say anything to them? What if they looked better than before? What is it about weight that makes people tongue-tied? I could understand if I looked like I’d gained 50 pounds in my middle and people were wondering if I was with child (which has happened, by the way, and boy is it embarrassing... and no it’s not as forgivable as that stupid-ass commercial where the lady says thank you and gets a hug from the offended fat chick... gimme a friggin’ break people!). But I am losing weight and it shows! I feel better and better every day and I have energy and a healthy glow and I am dressing fashionably in black (no more wild patterned clothes that look like grotesque circus tents on my obese frame). I have walked around the office, back and forth for the last few weeks just waiting for someone to say something. I don’t work with just a few people either. I work in a call center that employs 200+ people of which I know 70 or more I see on a daily basis. No one said a goddamn single word.  Until today.  Today, one of the supervisors, (whom I’m not fond of and would think to be the last person ever to say something nice to me), was walking by me out the door and she stopped and said in a whisper “Have you been losing weight?” I mentioned I was and the amount and she smiled, clearly relieved, and said, “I can see it!” Well, finally, FINALLY, someone around here has noticed. And I feel so much better about the whole thing. I thought everyone had their heads up their asses… but I was proven wrong (even if it’s just temporary). It gives me the motivation I need for the next 50 pounds I need to lose. It gives me the hope that I need when I go home that everyone will see, however small, the changes that I have made.

       Well as of noon today, I hit 57 pounds lost. That makes 57 to go. I have never gotten this far on my weight loss efforts before. This feels permanent. I hope that it is. I KNOW THAT IT IS. I am halfway home and more than that, I am only 16.5 pounds from my magical happy weight number! People who have never been seriously fat will not know what this is. This magical happy number is different for each person trying to lose weight. It may or may not be the ending number (in my case, it's not) but it has some sort of significance for the person. My magical happy number is 199.5. Why? Because I can't remember a time in my adult life when I have weighed less than 200 pounds. In fact, I can't ever remember being under 200 even though I probably didn't hit 200 until around 9th grade or so. It's always been a given for me. I came real close to it 8 years ago. I was on Weight Watchers and doing really well for 8 months. I had gotten to 207.5 and then the bottom dropped out when I took on too much stress with work and school. The weight just gradually went back on. I did try again, about 5 years ago and lost somewhere around 30 pounds. But it was really a half-assed effort.     This time, however, I am bound and determined to keep the weight off. When I hit 240, 230, 220, each time I vowed never to go above that number again. I refuse to. I can’t live life in this condition anymore. I have to be skinnier & healthier. I want to be able to walk a flight of stairs & not feel like falling over (which I can do just fine now).   This weekend at the air show, many spectators brought along folding lawn chairs for the general seating area. The newer ones have tags on them that warn of maximum weight allowed. Last year, while searching for camping gear, I remember having a tough time finding a chair that could hold my weight comfortably. There was maybe one type that Walmart carried that held over 270 pounds. This weekend, I had a chance to glance at the tag on the chair next to me. It was designed for a maximum weight of 225 pounds. I can sit in that chair, and many more for sale on the market and be just fine. I don’t have to worry about bending the little stick legs anymore. One less thing that I can potentially break.

      Today I hit 56 (56.5 as of 8/18.. this post was started yesterday) pounds lost and my BMI is now 34 (33.9 as of 8/18). I started at 273 with a BMI of 42.8. I'm feeling much healthier nowadays. I have just 4 (3.5 Whoo-hoo!) puny pounds to lose before I go home in 2 weeks. I can do this!  I notice the weight loss in weird places. My neck is longer and I can see my collarbone. My shoulders seem smaller. I have to turn my elbows in to touch my wrists to my hips. I can see my arms getting smaller. My knees seem smaller in size. My 2 favorite parts are my lower back just before it curves out. It is tiny in comparison to the rest of my torso. And when I lay down, I can just begin to feel my hip bones jut out. It's weird feeling my bones again.

      Today is the 20 day mark to vacation. That would be 20 days and 2 hours till I am on a flight home!! yippiiieeee! I am so psyched.  I have been missing madison like crazy all summer long. I haven't had homesickness this bad since I first moved out here 2 years ago.  I hope this vacation gets here real fast. I am super snippy with my customers and coworkers. I am just bouncing up and down, thinking of only one thing.  homehomehomehomehomehomehomehomehome  I am almost there.

       For as long as I can remember I have been ugly. This wasn't always the case. My baby pictures were cute. In fact I won a pretty baby contest when I was two.  urlLink    1979 age 2&nbsp; urlLink    When I got to middle school, I was not pretty and everyone, EVERYONE, let me know it. I tried to hide myself, ignore others, pretend I was all alone, but everyday from the first day of 6th grade to my last day at East High in 10th grade, I was put in my place. We're talking comments, jokes, looks, stares... you name it and it probably happened to me. I literally thought of myself as a monster. Like the hunchback or something. I didn't like looking in the mirror. In fact, I must have had some sort of disassociative disorder because when I did look in the mirror, I did not grasp that the person staring back at me was me. She was someone else. Someone who stood in the next room and peered at me through the hole in the wall. SHE. WAS. NOT. ME.  I thought this for years.   Then, the day that this picture was developed and placed in my hands-   urlLink    March 1997 &nbsp; urlLink    -something happened. All of a sudden, I could see a glimpse of a better version of myself. I realized I liked my smile and I liked to mug for the camera. I realized that not all hope was lost. I began to slowly see myself in the mirror again. I began paying attention. This picture was taken in 1997, just after I had lost 45 pounds and was very close to 199 pounds (my magical happy weight number). I was letting a friend take pictures for me just as a joke, something to post on the internet for chatting. I really didn't think they would look good. I don't keep 95% of the pictures taken of me because I find too many faults. I just can't bear to look at myself. But this picture...changed me. I wonder if that's ever happened to anyone else. I've read all about the phenomenon where someone looses like 50 pounds just based on one photo where their double chin shows up but I've never heard of someone starting to like themselves based on a picture. My world was rocked that day. And I'm ready to have that happen again.

      so I am sure that to the rest of the world,     urlLink     273 pounds&nbsp; urlLink      I must look pretty chunky. 55 pounds only counts if you have a reference point. This picture is mine. That coke shirt was tight around the middle when I stood up.   Besides the fact that I am hiding in an ugly tee-shirt, I am also hiding behind my hair. Someone once said to me that I shouldn't hide behind my hair. I didn't really understand what he meant and was pissed that he even said that cause I always liked my hair. But when I see a picture like this, I understand. Hey, when nothing else is going for me, what am I supposed to use? My hair was what I used to pretend I'm pretty. But from the looks of it, that's just goofy.   I wished I had hiked down to the lake that day.. but I think if I walked more than the 20 steps to the bathroom and gift shop, I would have fainted. Maybe I should schedule another visit for next summer and see what I'm worth?!?

      Did I mention that I hate cubicles? I mean, I really hate them. I was sitting here, doing my job, needing some help and I dialed our in-office help line. I get someone who does not know their job, doesn't seem to care to want to know their job, and doesn't really want to help me. I get so frustrated that I hang up on them, mutter to myself what a jackass they are and go on with my task...minutes later realizing that the jackass was sitting in the cubicle next to me the entire time. So I get that awful feeling in the pit of my stomach- I think it was my foot just inserted a little too far in my mouth but I recover quickly because I really don't care!    He never said a word to me. And he shouldn't! He doesn't know his freaking job!!!

      I decided to make small steps towards my large goals in life. If I want to be a vegetarian at some point than instead of going cold turkey (hahaha), I shall begin by just cutting out the red and white meat as of right....(swallowing last bites of taco) now!   James thinks I can't give up brats but I've done it before and I'll do it again.   I won't miss:                    bacon                            ribs                             anything BBQ'd roast kielbasa

      I was dreading having to fight the laundry monster this weekend. Piles and piles of clothes in the corner of the bedroom all screaming to be dealt with. Throw a sock on top and the monster will have eaten it by day's end. Such an insatiable appetite! THAT'S where all the socks really go! So much for actual pairs of socks. I'm happy if they are the same color.  It didn't take me nearly as long today because 70% of my clothes are being boxed up to be taken to St. Vincent DePaul's. I don't like wearing any of my old clothes since they just hang on me. Too many 3x’s and stretched out tops and big-ass jeans. I vow never to return to them. EVER. Goodbye 54.5 pounds! I will NEVER miss you!

      So I wanna get a birthday cake for James' 31st birthday because it's his golden one and everyone deserves a great cake on their golden birthday. I still remember my Barbie cake from my 4th birthday. While surfing for ideas I come across something corny like this:     Which would totally work.   Or  even this:    But then I see this:   And at first glance I'm thinking, a coffin? For a kid's birthday?  What would you write on top?   "Here's to one more year closer to DEATH Timmy!"  "Life's a bitch and then you die kid!"  "Pretty soon you'll have one foot in the grave. Enjoy it while it lasts!"  What the hell? Then I noticed that the caption for the cake said it was a treasure chest. And I'm soooooooooooo relieved!

      So I’m sitting in the break room gnawing on a really good piece of marinated chicken breast from last night’s dinner and I am overhearing a conversation that a coworker is having on the phone. She’s demanding that the person on the other line “hide the vegetarian pizza somewhere…like the freezer.” Apparently she’s afraid her dinner will be all gone by the time she gets home. Two thoughts that go thru my head are: 1) I bet she’s real pleased to see me ripping apart my lunch in the carnivoristic manner that I am (yes, I know that’s not a word…get off my back) and 2) Do I really want to go back to being a vegetarian once I’ve gotten down to my goal weight? I mean I’d like to do the right thing and stop eating the animals of this world. It just isn’t normal in my mind. But, I did find it hard at times not to eat critters when I did the vegetarian thing for a whole year. I like fish and fishy foods. I like marinated things. I totally like breakfast burritos with eggs and cheese. I was raised in Wisconsin where brats are a their own food group!  But it was so hard to explain to everyone all the time what I could and could not eat. It was hard to scour the menus at restaurants for vegetarian items. I hated having to have my own food and constantly worrying that everyone else was going to want some so I'd be left with nothing (free pizzas at the office were the worst....why does the cheese pizza look so much more tempting to everyone instead of the double meat pizza?) It was hard to walk past a really good backyard BBQ and have my mouth not water in envy (and I hate BBQ flavored things!)  But after reading  urlLink The Pig Who Sang to the Moon  by Jeffery Masson, I was reminded of the emotions of animals. I know that they feel and think and love and grieve. I know that I shouldn’t be eating something that has emotions and a family and a life. It ain’t right. I’m torn over what to do. I am doing the low-carb thing right now and have researched whether it’s possible to be a vegetarian at the same time. It’s next to impossible unless I want to become really, really good friends with salad. I can’t have a salad for every frickin’ meal. I can’t always tolerate this diet…imagining a life of salad is not something I wanna do. I miss beans and rice and French bread. I don’t think any of those things are “bad” for me, especially in moderation. I don’t think that low-carb diets are the best thing in this world. I am denying myself some important foods. But I guess it’s okay as long as I can fit into the lower sized pants and I can feel better about myself. I will have to just see what happens when I get down to my goal weight. Maybe my body can handle more carbs and I can switch to low fat vegetarian items instead. Or maybe I can throw the whole diet mentality out the window because I will have learned moderation and have a much more active metabolism. We’ll just have to wait and see.

      Dear Rachel Blogger, Thank You! Thank You! Thank You for that  urlLink post  on June 14, 2004. I too have had that dreaded feeling of going into a "skinny" store looking for clothes and fearing the stares. I have never heard of anyone else having the same problem as me. It was always an unspoken rule- don't go where you don't belong. It's all a mental thing, I know, but it has shaped the way I shop for clothes. I would never dare tread into the "wrong" section for fear that an alarm would go off and two fashion policewomen would drag me back to my plus size department kicking and screaming. I used hate clothes shopping when I was a child. When I got too big for clothes around 5th grade, my mother would dress me in larger sizes that always made me look like a kid dressed in old lady clothes (and we're talking 30 and 40 year old women's fashions). I was mortified that I couldn't dress like my friends. I couldn't get the "right" jeans (with the cuffs rolled up like the preppy kids did) and I couldn't get the "right" dresses because I didn't fit into any of them! So much for dances (and in reality, what kind of dance is a middle school dance? It's not like it matters much, but geez, when you're 13 and obese and wanting to desperately fit in... those dances MATTER!) That changed when Fashion Bug came into my life. Finally, FINALLY, I was able to dress like everyone else. I still looked like the Michelin Man but damn-it, I was dressed in the popular looks and I could let my guard down a little. I didn’t stick out as much as before. Fast-forward to this summer as I hit 50 pounds lost and went to Target to get a pair of workout/yoga pants. I walked away with an extra large pair of pants. HELLO!! Like I haven’t seen a 1x in pants in more than 8 years! (Side note- when I did the Relay for Life last month, I got a 1x tee shirt. Last year I had a 3x! Boo-Ya!) The pants fit and they were in the regular sizes of the store and the check out lady didn’t give me any weird vibes. I’m psyched! This losing weight thing is totally cool.

Most of the blackberries are not ripe enough to eat. Very large blackberry patch that contained last years loot has been chopped down by the city. Knowing Eugene, it's probably because of the homeless population setting up camp there again.
