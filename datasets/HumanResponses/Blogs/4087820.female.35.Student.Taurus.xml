						   Ah, Friday nights! Hubby and I look forward to Friday because, frankly, we hate our jobs. Every Friday we go out to eat (Think  Chic-fil-A , not  Cheesecake Factory ) and see the newest movie.  This Friday we saw M. Night Shyalaman's " The Village ". I had already notice that Ebert had given the movie only one star.  I usually respect his reviews. Still, I was fully prepared to be disappointed. I happen to like Joaquin Phoenix and I will see pretty much anything he is in.  Anyway, we went to  Chic-fil-A  and I ate one of those Cool Wraps (grilled chicken, cheese, and lettuce wrapped in a flour tortilla). They are huge and it made me sick. Maybe my body isn't used to anything green. I felt like I had eaten a brick and it was stuck at the top of my stomach.  Then, we drove across the freeway to the  Loew's  Movie Theatre. This movie theatre has to be 20- years- old and believe me, it could use a make-over. The seats hurt your butt big time. But, it's better than going to the  Cinemark  and waiting in line an hour. Every time we go, we know our butts are going to start hurting  before the coming attractions are  over.  One thing that bothered me last night was that the movie theatre was full of teenagers that laughed and talked through the movie. So, like the old thirtysomethings that we are, we mumbled under our breath and moved to the other side of the movie theatre where it was nice and quiet.  I enjoyed the movie. Not muched happened but it was beautifully shot, the actors were top-notch and it was interesting. Yeah, a few of the lines were ridiculous. I suppose if you were expecting a terror filled movie, you would have been disappointed. But I realized that Shyamalan's movies are never really like that.  Some of the kids were yelling "It sucked" but there was applause after the movie ended.  After the movie we drove to  Starbucks  and purchased two Venti-sized Vanilla Bean Frappuccino's. We are relatively new to the Starbucks craze. We aren't into coffee but damn if those Frappuccino's aren't heaven on earth!!!!

						   This is &nbsp;just great. I was sitting at my desk, very excited about starting my blog, and my electricity went out. Now, I have a laptop, but the battery usually lasts just long enough for you to get into something important and then it shuts down. So, this is my first, anti-climactic post. I shall return when the power is on!

						   Well, I did it. I went to the Doctor for my annual physical. I always put if off. Even though I learned several years ago that it was a BAD idea.  A little history. There was a stretch of time in the 90's that I didn't have my exam for six years. Yeah, that's right. Six. So, when I finally did go for a check-up, I found out that I had an ovarian cyst and that I had to have one of my ovaries removed. This was a major surgery that I probably could have avoided if I had caught it earlier. Anyway, ever since then I have had my exam every year. Listen, girls AND boys, it's very important! Get your annual exam!  Anyway,  I was totally dreading the pelvic exam. I can deal with the blood tests and the endless questions, but the pelvic exam is a nightmare for me. Shudder. I was laying on the exam table, feet in the stir-ups, and saying a little prayer that it was over when I felt this excruciating pain and the Doctor calmly asked, "Did that hurt?" Fuck. Did it ever! He had snuck in a rectal exam and stool sample. The worst part is that he referred me to a GI Specialist for a 'problem'. I'm assuming it's hemorrohoids but it could always be colon cancer and that is exactly where my brain goes to. Lucky me, I have two weeks to worry about my 'problem'.  But to the good news. I have refills for all of my prescriptions. I have asthma so I NEED them. And he was kind enough to give me a prescription for Phentermine.  I'm on my way to the phentermine.com forums to check out some success stories.....

						   Just came across this funny shirt. I've been a Catholic, a Buddhist, and now an Atheist. So I can  really   relate to it.  TAOISM: Shit happens. CONFUCIANISM: Confucious says, "Shit happens." BUDDHISM: It is only an illusion of shit happening. ZEN: What is the sound of shit happening? HINDUISM: This shit has happened before. ATHEISM: There is no such thing as shit. AGNOSTICISM: Maybe shit happens, maybe it doesn't. PROTESTANTISM: Shit won't happen if I work harder. CATHOLICISM: If shit happens, I deserve it. JUDAISM: Why does shit always happen to US? ISLAM: If shit happens, it is the will of Allah. EXISTENTIALISM: Shit doesn't happen; shit is. TELEVANGELISM: Shit will happen if you don't send money. RASTAFARIAN: Smoke that shit. SECULAR HUMANISM: Shit evolves. CHRISTIAN SCIENCE: When shit doesn't happen, don't call a doctor.  HeeHee.

						   What does an atheist do on Sunday? Why, I watch Pastor Joel Osteen from Lakewood Church. There is something analgesic about his sermons. He appears to be a kind person and like he really cares about you and your 'spirit man'. He doesn't strut around the podium with a holier than thou attitude. No, he preaches about forgiveness, love, and hope for the future. Today's sermon was "God wants to Restore" or something like that. The gist was that if you are having a hard time, God wants you to come out of your troubles with more than you had before. All very soothing and motivating. It doesn't hurt that he is an attractive man and his wife is just as cute.  That is why I wake up on Sunday mornings and stumble downstairs to listen. I've been a little upset lately because Pastor Joel is selling his first book  and he is giving sermons in far flung cities. I don't like to share.  I gave up believing in religion a long time ago.  And that is a long, long, story. Still, there is a part of me that wants to believe in that picture perfect way of life.   You know, God-fearing people who are all loving and wear their best to church on Sundays. I wish that all christians were as loving as Mr. Osteen seems to be. But I've never met any.
