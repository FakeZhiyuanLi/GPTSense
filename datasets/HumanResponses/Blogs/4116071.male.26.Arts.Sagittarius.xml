       So the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth are now having to eat a big old plate of dick now that it emerges they are FULL OF SHIT.   The entire ad is based on a sworn affidavit by Larry Thurlow, Republican Cocksucker of the moment, stating that Kerry was never fired upon. But military records show him to be lying his priviledged ass off. So now that the MILITARY officially corrects Thurlow, what does he do? Calls  them  liars. That Kerry probably wrote the report. So Thurlow basically is a traitor to his country, just like Kerry. I swear to Christ, you can't make this shit up.   Oh Yeah, if by chance you are here and are not registered to vote, take 2 seconds and pop over to  urlLink http://www.rockthevote.org .    Damn the Man.   XO

        One of my favorite bands in the world is the Long Winters. They are on the barsuk label, home to death cab, they might be giants, nada surf, and so much more. check out their webpage, cause they are gonna blow up, and when they do, they'll STILL be the same badasses that come out after their set and hang. they ACTUALLY seem to not hate their fans.     anyways, they played the Echo Lounge this summer with the decembrists. the decembrists are a snoody pirate band. and although i have their latest effort, it is not in heavy rotation on normaltown radio. last time i saw  tlw , John Roderick, the lead singer, mentioned he hadn't had any good southern bbq. so i carted five pounds of athens' finest to the echo, and between amanda and myself, carried it the ENTIRE FUCKING SHOW. when  tlw  finished, i carried it to their merchandise table. they weren't yet there, and it was getting late, so the door guy swore to me that john and the boys would get this award winning bbq.                    The door guy is a fucking liar . and he probably ate it. which riled up John something fierce.      So it is with great satisfaction that i get to the point. I recently had to go back to the ATL, and when i did, i made a pit stop at the echo lounge. actually, i made a pit stop at eckerd's first, and THEN to the echo lounge. no wait. FIRST i stopped off to buy five more pounds of bbq. THEN i went to eckerd's. Then to a parking lot. and THEN to the echo lounge. i dropped off bbq for the door staff, mentioning that i had ben in recently and we had discussed the virtues of athens' fresh air bbq, and they seemed jealous that i had brought some for a band, so i had FINALLY made it back to reward them for helping me out. They were touched by the gesture and offered me drinks on the house. I politely declined, said i had to get going, but to take care, and headed out of the city quicker than you can say diarrhea.     You'd be amazed how much  ex-lax  can fit into a container of bbq sauce.     i shit you not.     my mom was there, and she will back me up.    xo

       i just received the script for Gnomes: Gnome Deuce, and kids, i don't think it'll disappoint.  it occured to me that ten years ago i was a junior in high school. we were gearing up for grand nationals in indianapolis. how trivial it seems now. it has been nearly a decade since gwen dutton asked me, VERY POLITELY, to look up ethics and integrity in the PHONEBOOK. i shit you not. she really did say that to me.    For those not privy, i was told this by a kid's mom who had been my friend for eight years. she thought her son deserved the distinct priviledge of being band president. i got it. so i of course rigged the whole damn thing, cause what's more important than a high school band officer election?   NOTHING.   except the Passion of the Christ, of course.   but i digress.   it should be noted that the band directors called me into the office while this was going on. they informed me that they knew she was full of shit(not their words, but something incredibly similar), and that little dutton had received EXACTLY 2 votes. not even his girlfriend voted for him. he did. and i am betting his mother busted in an illegal vote.   i'd also bet both of them are going to vote for bush/cheney/satan.   but i am totally over it.   now the pinewood derby is an entirely DIFFERENT story...

        i just wish i was a little more blog savvy. guess that comes with time. i am psyched to be gettin' ready for a couple of gigs. gnomes:gnome 2 is in the pipeline (which i guess is the NEW troma style) and i am getting my head straight for a film me and the boys are involved in at the present, tentatively titled Scalywags. the concept is truly dope and all we need is the ability and resources to get it done.     strange days, yes?     people never seem to really be paying attention. if they were, the polling wouldn't be as close and we would be sending junior to the gallows. just cause you invoke the lord almighty don't put her on your side.      so, my in-laws are in town. and i am on day 3 of my latest flirtation with sobriety. i really could use some morphine.     xo

        seeing as this is my first blog, i feel introductions are appropriate. (although i seriously doubt the likelihood anyone will venture here who needs it)   my blog...   yeah, fuck it. first things first.   i am a liberal.   i am married.   i am an actor.   i am an atheist.   i am 26.5 years old.   i have not done enough with myself.   i hope to do more.       guess that pretty much sums it up.    if you got here, please to drop a line. it'd be appreciated.   2nd August, year of our lord 2004 (for posterity)
