      Sometime during September I'll be the proud parent of another  urlLink dog . I felt it was time Colby had someone new to play with and I needed something else to occupy my free time. Sure, I could be like normal people and get a boyfriend, but I happen to like dogs more.   And since I'm getting a new dog, I have to think of a new name. If I get a male dog, then I was thinking of naming "Toby" after Tobey Maguire [Spiderman]. It seemed like a cute idea at first but then I thought of the possible implications of naming my dog "Toby."  One word: Roots.   I could just imagine all the Kunta Kinte/Tobey jokes that I would get from my family, especially from my sister who would take great pride in reinacting the scene in which Kunta was forced to accept the name Toby.   I'm toying with the idea of just naming the dog "Kunta" and let the chips fall where they may.

      I had thought about changing the name of my site---it would have marked the fourth time that i had changed site names. I decided that I needed to stick with one name for more than one year. Besides, I like "Delusions of Grandeur." The title works for me, for now anyway.   Not much else is going on in my world at the moment. I've been enjoying the Memorial Day holiday by eating pizza and watching The West Wing marathon with the flux. I've never been a fan of the West Wing, but after watching one episode I'm thinking of adding it to my list of favorite shows.   Tomorrow, I will continue my job hunting and hopefully something will come from it. I need a job as soon as possible, if not I'll be moving home for a while. I'm not looking forward to that, so I'll be off to find a job.   I really, really need to find a job.

      I saw Spiderman today. It is awesome. I went to the Alamo Drafthouse since it was the only place I could go to without having to bum a ride or take the bus. I thought about waiting until the weekend and then organzing a group of fellow Spidey-addicts to attend the movie with me, but impatience got the best of me.   Besides, I like the no complications way of going to see movies. There's no rides to arrange, no figuring out who rides with who or being stuck riding with someone that I can't stand. I go see the movie of my choice without hearing any whining or complaining and I leave the movie stress-free and happy.   Now this only applies when I go the movies with groups of 4 or more. I don't mind going to the movies with 3 or fewer people. Usually if I go to the movies with just a couple people, chances are they won't get on my nerves.   Groups of people always make me nervous, especially if there's a whiner or a bitch amongst them. Nothing kills a good time faster than someone whining or bitching about something beyond their control. First they whine or bitch about the movie selection. A good example of a bitches or whiners are the girlfriends [or a girl he has a crush on] of my guy friends that are being dragged to a movie that they don't want to see. Of course, I have no sympathy for them. I have a low opinion of them anyway--especially if they prefer to watch inane chick flicks compared to movies with explosions.   Anyway, because of the presence of the whiny bitch, everyone starts bending over backwards to appease her because they don't want to get into a fight with their friend. I, however, will not hesitate to make her look like a moron, even if it makes me look a bitch in the process.   See, this is why going to the movies in groups is a bad idea. This is why I went to see Spiderman by myself. The last thing I'd want to hear is some bitch whining about not liking Spiderman or thinking comic books are stupid, etc. Why do women like this exist in the first place? And why would a guy who loves Spiderman and comic books even bother associating with someone who thinks they're stupid?  Argh. That was long repressed tangent about a guy friend of mine that consistently dates stupid girls.   Aside from that, I made a nifty image of  urlLink Spiderman . Tell me what you think.

      As with all things, you have to wade through the bad before you get to the good. And with this certain personals service, this means I get a fairly large amount of chat invites from random guys. Guys who have obviously not read my profile or they would know that we are not even remotely compatible.   How do I know this, you ask? I just got a chat invite from a 19 year old that asked if I liked to cuddle. Then he asked if I'd like to have a baby.   Argh.

      After careful deliberation, I've decided that I've been far too harsh on the male gender lately. Not all guys are complete assholes. I should give guys a fair shake. I'm not exactly the easiest person to get to know and if I would just give guys a chance, then I'd probably meet someone decent.   Now, honestly I don't think I believe everything I just typed, but I'm going to keep telling myself that I do until I believe it.   I'm back to browsing the online personals. I haven't seen anyone that I'm even remotely interested in, but browsing kills time and is often amusing. Some guys on online personals try their hardest to convey how witty and funny they are by making their ads as corny as possible.   I am very systematic when it comes to browsing personal ads. First I look at the picture and try to guess how tall the guy is from his photo. Then I view his profile and find out if I got it right. Sometimes the guy never makes it to the height guessing phase. If he's too cute to be attainable, I skip over his profile. If he's not cute enough for me to date without snickering, then he gets skipped over as well.   Photos are important for the first impression. Any photo of a guy playing a guitar [or any other instrument] gets an automatic skip over. Photos that look like mugshots--skip over. Photos of shirtless guys, while nice to gawk at, get skipped over too. They are clearly objectifying themselves. I especially like the photos where the guys have clearly cropped their girlfriends out of the photo. Nothing says "rebounding" like cropping a photo of your ex-girlfriend.  When in doubt about his looks, I turn to his headline or user name. If either of these are stupid or cheesy beyond redemption, he gets skipped over. The headlines I find truly scary are the ones that say they're ready to settle down. Nothing is scarier to a commitment phobe than "I'm ready to settle down." Skip.   Location is another important aspect. If they don't live in or near Austin, it's skip-a-de-doo-da for them. For example, if the guy lives in, let's say Nigeria, then the chances of us dating are slim to none.   I doubt highly that I'll meet Mr. Right through the personals. At best, I'll get a couple of dates and more fodder for angry [or funny] journal entries. That's what it's all about anyway.

      I rented the X-Files movie over the weekend. I was a huge X-Files fan a few years ago and now I'm reduced to watching repeats late on Sunday nights. The movie is decent, it plays out like a two hour episode of the show rather than a movie. I kinda like it that way.   Anyway, while watching the movie, I was reminded of a song that former roomie used to play all the time called David Duchovny by Bree Sharp. It's hillarious.     It's Sunday night, I am curled up in my room The t.v. light fills my heart like a balloon I hold it in as best I can I know I'm just another fan But I can't help feeling I could love this secret agent man and I can't  Wait anymore for him to discover me I got it bad for David Duchovny David Duchovny, why won't you love me? Why won't you love me?  My friends all tell me, 'girl, you know it's just a show' But deep within his eyes I see me wrapped up like a bow Watching the sky for a sign The F.B.I. is on my mind I'm waiting for the day when my lucky stars align in the form of  David Duchovny floating above me In the alien light of the spaceship of love, I need David Duchovny hovering above me American Heathcliff, brooding and comely David Duchovny, why won't you love me? Why won't you love me? Why won't you love me?  So smooth and so smart He's abducted my heart And I'm falling apart From the looks I receive From those eyes I can't leave You can say I'm naive But he told me to believe  My bags are packed, I am ready for my flight Want to put an end to my daydream days and sleepless nights Sitting like a mindless clone Wishing he would tap my phone Just to hear the breath of the man, the myth, the monotone and I would say  David Duchovny, why won't you love me? Why won't you love me? Why won't you love me? David Duchovny, why won't you love me? Why won't you love me? Why won't you love me? David Duchovny I want you to love me To kiss and to hug me, debrief and debug me David Duchovny, I know you could love me I'm sweet and I'm cuddly - I'm gonna kill Scully David Duchovny, why won't you love me? Why won't you love me? Why won't you love me?  I'll be waiting . . . In Nevada . . .

      I hate freshman orientation. Right now, over half of the computer lab is under the control of entering freshman trying desperately to figure out to register for fall classes. It makes me feel like an old fart whenever I'm in the lab with them, so today I'm on the third floor in the mini-lab they have up here.  Of course, this means that none of the damn computers have floppy drives which annoys me to no end. I hate having to burn files on CD. It seems like such a waste of a disk for two or three files.   By five, all the freshman will be out of the main lab and I'll be able to get on a computer with a floppy disk drive. Won't that be great?   I'm annoyed by life today. I am confused as to what I should do with mine. It would be a lot simpler if I could just be passionate about something enough to pursue it. As it currently stands, I don't like a single thing enough to devote a lot of time to it.   I lead a listless existence. I crave purpose and meaning. How do I obtain these things?

      For some odd reason, my  urlLink launchcast station  is playing a lot of obnoxious chick  and rap music despite the fact that I have blocked most obnoxious chick and rap artists. However, launchcast does this thing where they play stuff that other fans of certain bands like. Kind of like, "Fans of Yes also listen to this band too" type of thing. I know that has to be a lie. Fans of Yes don't like Chingy. No, they don't.   Yesterday, I got another employment rejection letter. Oh well, there's always the Air Force.   Tonight, I'm going to the Waffle House. That should cheer me up. Definitely.  Happy Friday.

      It seems like as soon as I add more minutes to my prepaid [argh] cell phone, someone calls and I talk away all my minutes. I'm currently looking around for a "real" cell phone but until that happens, I'm stuck with having to buy minutes as I need them.   Today's minute burner was my brother, whom I hadn't spoken with since Christmas. We weren't having a fight or anything, I just don't talk to him all that often. Usually we speak two or three times a year and our conversations last a couple of hours. I get him up to speed on all family occurances and he tells me about life in Alaska.   He told me all about his kids, all of which have pretty interesting personalities and keep he and his wife pretty busy with their antics. I wish they lived closer to me, I'd like to spend more time with them.   Anyway, he asked if I were dating someone [meaning did I have a "real" boyfriend or was I still messing around with the last "fuck-buddy" I told him about---which was Dorf in 2002]. I told him all about Blinky and then I asked him about the behavior  urlLink the fucker  that dissed me last week. I asked him why would a guy do something like that.   My brother said that perhaps A) the guy was intimitated because I pursued him instead of the other way around. My brother said that to some [not all] guys it seems a bit "slutty" and "desperate." B) The guy probably went out with me because I asked him in front a group of his friends; and C) maybe the guy just didn't want to date a black girl.   I had thought of all three as possible reasons and quickly concluded that it didn't matter what the reason was---the dude's an asshole and I shouldn't be harping on what happened.    The incident does make me rethink my stance on dating---making the first move as well as attempting to date outside of my race. Both are touchy subjects for me because whenever I attempt either one it usually comes back to haunt me. Not that dating black men has been a picnic. However, guys I tend to attract usually turn out to be morons regardless of race or religion.   I'm disappointed with dating, plain and simple. I have yet to meet someone who was worth the effort and I'm starting to doubt I'll even get close.   I thought about swearing off men for the next five years, but that seemed a bit drastic. Instead I'll just do my best to avoid them, not all men, just the ones that want to date me. Unless the turn out to be nice but with my track record I doubt that'll happen much.   Ah well, enough whining for tonight.

      So today I finally decided to pay a late fee that I had been ignoring for at least two months. My apartment manager had sent me at least three friendly reminders that I had casually tossed to the side and ignored. I had hoped to ignore the aforementioned apartment manager because she's too friendly and it annoys me. No one's that damned friendly all the time.   Anyway, I finally made out the check and headed to the office, hoping that not only I'd be rid of that damned bill but I'd also be able to go another month on my month-to-month lease without having to pay any extra fees. You never can tell about leases, there's always some hidden fee that shows up out of nowhere the moment you decide to move.   Another thing about apartment leasing offices that I don't like is the nagging that you get to renew your lease. Most of the time they harass you with such earnest desperation that you're almost suckered into signing your life away for another year. Actually,I really had no intention of renewing my lease unless I got a really spiffy job.   Currently I pay about $575 per month, with the month-to-month I have to pay $625 (yikes) for a small, one bedroom on the ground floor [this means when I look out my bedroom window, the parking lot is above me]. Despite the grim detail, I actually love where I live. It's quiet. I don't have to awake to the sound of beer bottles crashing to the ground [*cough* University Commons *cough*].   I know that I could find something cheaper, though I doubt I'd find it in my current neighborhood. So you could just envision my excitement when my apartment manager announced that they were lowering the rent on my apartment. With the new, lower rent I'd be shelling out $499 per month. Not too shabby.  I can take advantage of this lower rent if only I would renew my lease by June 30th. Therein lies the problem. I want to renew my lease, but I don't have a job yet. I don't want to commit to this and then find a job in another city the moment the ink on my signature dries.   Argh.   Now I could just go ahead and sign the lease, for 6 months this time, which would in a way  force  me to find a job in time to make rent for August. Then again, that seems like an awfully risky, and downright dumb thing to do considering the only callbacks I've been getting are from jobs in Dallas [which I'll only accept if I have exhausted all efforts in finding a job in Austin].   Hrm.   I guess I'll just have to find a job in Austin by June 30th.

      I was going to write about family dysfunction, but I'll save that for later. I have other, more happy things to think about these days. First of all, Spiderman hits theaters next week. Wooo Hooo! I love me some Spidey. In fact, I love Spidey so much that I'm now the proud owner of a Spiderman temporary tattoo which I have placed on my back. I got it out of a box of Spiderman fruit snacks. I've also been eating a lot of Spiderman popsicles. I'm also redoing an old Spiderman template for this blog.   I am a dork.   Also, to add to my glee--- urlLink ACL Fest  tickets are on sale. I will be buying mine before the end of July. Do you wanna know why?  Two Words: MODEST MOUSE!!!!  Sure, I saw them back in March. I've been a fan for 7 years. But they're not only reason I'm going. There's also Spoon, Wilco, Ryan Adams, Cake, Los Lonely Boys, Old 97's, Gomez, Cat Power, and The Gourds just to name a few.   Me so happy.

      Before I start with my rant on my family's current level of dysfunction, I have to share an excerpt of a conversation I had with my little sister earlier today. Apparently, the brother (who is 15) of one her ex-boyfriends has taken a liking to her and the feelings aren't being reciprocated. The poor kid is also really bummed about my sister leaving town in a couple of weeks (she's going to visit my brother), and his "bummed-out-ness" had obviously clouded his knowledge of geography and the location of cities.    Idiot that likes my sister:  So you leaving?  My Sister:  Uh yeah.  Idiot that likes my sister:  Where you goin'?  My Sister:  Alaska.  Idiot that likes my sister:  Oh you mean like in Georgia?  My Sister:  [rolls her eyes] No, ALASKA. Not ATLANTA.  Anyway, this weekend was quiet, sort of. I saw Saved! on Friday, despite my not wanting to be bothered with people. I had nothing else to do. The movie was hillarious and struck so close to home, it was almost scary. I went to a school like that. Granted, I was only in the 1st grade, but stuff like that transcends time. My other sister's 1st college was like that---exactly like that. I went to church with people like that, kinda sheds light on why I avoid church now.   Aside from that, I spent some quality time in Blockbuster this weekend. I rented Flirting With Disaster, Big Eden, and Permanent Midnight. I guess I wasn't really paying attention when I chose these movies because I had inadvertently rented two Ben Stiller movies. I honestly don't like Ben Stiller that much. He basically plays variations of the same neurotic asshole in just about every one of his movies and it's irritating to watch.   However, Flirting With Disaster was actually funny but it wasn't because of Ben Stiller. Everyone else was funny too which made the movie watchable and damn near enjoyable. Big Eden was okay. It was one of those heart-touching movies about gay guys falling in love in a small town. It was pleasant to watch and funny, not exactly realistic [the town in which it's set is fictional as well as the attitudes of its inhabitants] but better than watching some movie where the gay characters get the crap beat out of them by homophobes. I'd had enough with watching those.   I rented the movie mainly to watch Eric Schweig, he was in Last of the Mohicans and recently appeared in The Missing. I've had a crush on him ever since Last of the Mohicans but seeing him lock lips with another guy kind of killed it for me. Then again, seeing him lock lips with anyone would have killed it for me. The movie ended happily, which I was grateful for.   Permanent Midnight was bad though. Not because of the acting or the story, although Ben Stiller annoyed the shit out of me, it was because you had to watch Ben Stiller's character get high as a kite and fuck up his life. That hit a little too close to home for me and I had to stop watching it halfway thru. I did finish it later on Sunday, just in time to watch the Clinton interview on 60 Minutes. After the 60 Minutes interview, I watched The Cider House Rules, another movie that did nothing to put me in a happy mood.   Not much is going today as usual. It was too damn hot outside so I spent most of my day watching soap operas and eating jell-o. Not a bad way to live, I must say. Not bad at all.   Oops, I forgot to rant about my family's dysfunction. Ah well. There's always tomorrow.

      I'm kind of glad that this week is over. I can only handle so much crap in one week without wanting to pull my hair out while screaming at the top of my lungs. With the exception of Tuesday, this week hasn't been bad at all. I'm just glad it's over.   I bought a  urlLink shirt  on Monday (mine is red). I like it but I still have to bring it back to the store. The cashier forgot to remove the ink tag and I didn't discover this until I got ready to wear the shirt.   Today is going by slowly. I don't have anything planned, perhaps watch more movies or something. I want to see Saved! but I honestly don't feel like dealing with people right now.   Anyway, the computer lab is closing soon, so I'd better be off.   Happy Friday.

      I fixed the problem. Now the layout should look good in Safari as well as on various other browsers. I can only guarantee IE, Mozilla, Netscape, and Safari. If you're using anything else, you're on your own.

       urlLink David Sedaris  at BookPeople tonight @ 7pm. Be there!  I fixed my other layout but when I looked at it, I didn't like it as much as I thought I did. That happens fairly often with me. I'm finicky when it comes to layouts. Of course, I haven't been changing them on a daily basis as I did on my  urlLink old journal . But as my amount of free time increases, I'll probably be making more templates.   Alas, I am still a bit pissed about what happened on  urlLink Tuesday . I haven't heard anything from him and I doubt highly that I will. I'm still a bit amazed, more like shocked that someone would blantantly be an asshole like that especially when I did nothing to deserve it.   Argh.   I'm letting it go. Harping on it won't make me any less offended nor will it shed any light on why it happened. To hell with him.  Anyway, I finally got my first job callback a couple of days ago. 'Bout time. Too bad the job's in Dallas. I can't really afford to move, but I can't really afford to stay in Austin. Perhaps I'll start hearing back from places in Austin. I'll take just about anything at this point.

      So on Monday, I called Hefner and asked if he wanted to join me and the flux (and some other people) for birthday drinks at Hole in the Wall. He said no, adding that he'd have to work the next day. Okay, I can understand that. I was a little hurt or what not, for the blunt "no" that I got from him when I invited him out. But I let it all go.   Until I got to the bar.  I was there for almost an hour when I spotted him playing pool in the back with a couple of guys that I had met the week before. He looked at me a number of times but did not bother to come over and say "hi" or anything. He just glanced at me and went back to playing pool. For a moment I thought that maybe he didn't see me or something.   Bullshit.   He saw me. He looked dead at me. Three times and didn't even come over to say hi or explain to me why he showed up after he said he didn't want to go.   I was too pissed to say anything. I drank more beer and sulked and wondered why this guy would be such an asshole a mere two days after our first date.   But after a while, I threw up my hands. I'm tired of trying to date guys that don't want me. I'm sick of dating guys that have no clue how to treat someone or even pretend to be interested in them.   So if there are any decent guys out there that find me interesting and are younger than 35ish, send me an email. 'Cause I'm about two steps away from swearing off men from the next five years.....

      Right now, I'm killing time until the Unicorns show at Emo's. The show doesn't start until 10, doors at 8. I may show up around 9ish or so. I haven't decided yet. I'm hungry but I don't want to go home and eat. If I go home, I'll stay there regardless to how much I like the Unicorns.   I've also discovered that my layout looks wonky in Netscape as well as on a Mac. Well, that's what I get for trying to design the entire site using CSS. I don't care enough to fix it for every browser on the planet. For now, it only looks good in IE. So be it.   I have to do some  urlLink birthday shopping . I hope that what I get will be cool. I've never been good at buying gifts. My sister is better at it. Usually, I need someone to tell me what they want or they'll just find themselves with a gift card.   Anyway, I must get food. My stomach's rumbling.    urlLink This  is so funny, it's almost sad.   And it sucks that I'll have to wait until November to see new episodes of  urlLink The OC . Damn it.

      For some reason, my layout looks weird on a mac. I'm not a fan of macs and I have no desire to tweak my layout in order for it to look right on a mac. Oh well. Besides, I have more important things to discuss.   Well on Saturday I had my date. It was a bit awkward at first, I was drunk off my ass (putting it mildly) when I tossed the date invite out on Wednesday. By Saturday, I had started to rethink everything and was on the verge of having a panic attack. Sure, I was happy to have a date, but with Hefner? I met this guy three years ago and never said more than two words to him since then. It was weird. I was worried.   Eventually, I put my fear aside for the time and got ready for my date.  Around 3, Best guy friend called me once more to remind me of the time and place to meet up with everyone else.  I called Hefner a little while later to give him directions to my apartment.   He showed up on time.  We headed downtown. We didn't talk much on the way there. The tension was thick in the car and I couldn't think of anything witty or interesting to say. I was overwhelmed with fear, I guess. But that's to be expected on a first date.   We got to the restaurant ahead of everyone else, so there more opportunty for awkward silences and averting eyes.  We didn't have to wait long before the next couple in our entourage showed up, with Best guy friend and his girlfriend showing up last.  There was a 45 minute wait for our table, so we sat outside chatting. I listened more than I actually spoke. I'm like that in most social situations. I didn't know what to say or how to even contribute to the conversation, so I sat there mute until our table was ready.   There wasn't anything super interesting that happened the entire night, so I'll skip all the little details and quickly summarize.   He paid for everything. Shocked me shitless. It was the first time that happened, ever. Usually I have to drop hints or go dutch. He paid for everything without hesitation or bitching afterwards. I guess that's what happens when you go out with a college graduate who has a job.   He has good taste in music.  Likes mostly 70s stuff. Which is good. He knows who  urlLink Yes  are.    After bar hopping on 6th street with the rest of our group, we all parted ways and Hefner drove me home.  I kissed him goodnight, to which I got a "wow" and a big smile from him. Then after I shut the car door, he backed up and swiped the front bumper of a car parked behind him.   Yeah, I tend to have that effect on men.

      Yesterday, I went shopping for a dress to wear on Saturday. It's not like I really need a new dress to wear, I just wanted one. I'm liking the new sundress fashion trend that's going around. I spent most of yesterday afternoon walking around Highland Mall in search of the perfect sundress. I didn't want anything that was too bright as I hate being the center of attention. And nothing would make me the center of attention better than a bubble gum pink, floral print dress.   After trying on at least 10 dresses, I decided on a black halter dress with white flowers. It's cute but not too bright or gaudy. I'm keeping the price tags on it for the time being, just in case this date thing falls through. I only spent $30 on the dress, but it was $30 that I had no intention of spending about three days ago.  Anyway, I'm off to run some errands and kill time.   While the world is focused on Reagan dying, and that is important and whatever, keep in mind that  urlLink Ray Charles  died too.

      It's official. Hole in the Wall is my new favorite bar. The drinks are cheap and the bartenders aren't stingy with the alcohol.   But before I go off on a tangent about how much I like this place, I must first tell you all of my night of carousing and drunken flirtation.   As most people know, I'm not good at flirting. In fact, I loathe the idea because I find it to be wholly deceptive and used mainly to sweet-talk your way into someone's pants.   Not that it's a bad thing, but still.  Anyway, my night began at Crown & Anchor where I drank three kinds of beer [Shiner, Guiness, Sunshine Wheat] and watched Best guy friend and his other friends suck at playing pool. I had drunk a considerable amount of beer but I was no where near drunk or even mildly buzzed. It's a scary thought, but my tolerance is building up.   After spending an hour at Crown & Anchor, our group made their way to Hole in the Wall which is where my inner flirt reared its ugly head.   It started with a Malibu and coke, then a couple of  Screwdrivers, ending finally with a Red Bull and vodka. With the aid of these, I was able to flirt my ass off. First, I bumped into a guy standing at the bar when I was buying myself another drink.   I said, "Sorry about that." To which he replied, "It's okay. But next time it's gonna cost you some money. To touch me you have to pay."   Since I was drunk by then, I boldly went where sober neemie would never, ever go: "Oh wow. I wonder how much it'll cost to grab your ass."  He put my drink on his tab.   I smiled and said thanks. As I walked away, I casually patted him on the arm and said, "Oops. Looks like I touched you again." Then I made my way back to my group.  One member of our group was a guy I had met three years ago. He was Best guy friend's roommate for a while and I had a fleeting interest in him a while back. Never said anything to him or anyone else, but for some reason when I saw him last night I had an overwhelming need to talk to him. Of course, I didn't do that while sober. For now I'll refer to him as Hefner [for reasons that I can't explain now].  As we stood around, some random girl walked up and asked if one of the guys wanted to join her friends for a game of pool. Since no one else wanted to do it, Hefner volunteered. One of the girls was seriously trying to flirt with him. She kept touching his arm and smiling. I stood next to everyone else and watched with a snarl forming on my lips. It was then I decided I needed to take charge.  Best guy friend kept trying to convince Hefner to get the girls number. I shot that down quick. "You don't really want to talk to her do you? She has small boobs." After that, Best guy friend walked away to talk to his girlfriend. I turned to Hefner and said, "Don't talk to her. Talk to me. I'm more interesting."  By the end of the night, I had his phone number and he had mine. Also, Best guy friend and his girlfriend invited the two of us to join them for drinks on Saturday. With Best guy friend in on this, I can be assured that Hefner will call me [Best guy friend will pester him until he does].   So now I'm searching for a new skirt or dress to wear on Saturday. Honestly, I'm just glad that I got out of my shell for once. It felt good. Even if all this amounts to a big, fat nothing I'm proud of myself for putting myself out there.

      So last night I met best guy friend's new girlfriend. I had decided that I would hate her regardless to how cool she turned out to be merely because she was A)dating my best friend and B) I kinda wanted to date him myself.   Well after hanging out with the two of them, I decided that my hatred was unfounded and that my crush on best guy friend had dissolved completely. Though I still cringed whenever they were affectionate [which is something I do whenever ANYONE does public displays of affection], I was happy to see them happy.   Besides, his new girlfriend is cool. Really cool. Cool as in "I'd hang out with her of my own free will" type of cool. By the third round of Mexican martinis she was laughing hysterically and couldn't stop. Fun drunks are cool. Best guy friend should keep her around.  Tonight we're all going out once more, but this time some more of his friends will be joining us. Hopefully the rain won't drive anyone away.   I did feel kind of jealous though. The entire situation made me wish that I were dating someone, but the feeling was momentary. It'd be nice if I could actually keep someone around for more than a couple of months.

      I loathe my credit union. I deposited a check a week ago and it didn't show up in my account for some reason, so now my rent check for this month has bounced. ARGH.  But it's okay. I have everything under control.   Not much else is going on in my world at the present moment. I haven't seen best guy friend yet, nor has he called since yesterday. I probably should call and find out what's going on, but honestly I don't want to.   It's raining today and I stupidly decided to wear flip flops. I've been sliding around on the sidewalks all afternoon. It's like trying to walk on a Slip 'N Slide.  Argh.   I need a hug.

      Earlier today, I was in a good mood. I had just arrived on campus and I was headed downtown to cash one of many graduation checks. Thoughts of future purchases danced around inside my head, filling my heart with such elation that I was ten secounds from walking on air.   Then I checked my voice mail.  Best guy friend will be flying in tonight. I was excited about that, a bit too excited. It seems I still have a tiny crush on him. I was looking forward to his visit until I listened to voice message he left.  He's bringing his girlfriend.   Aww hell.   There's almost nothing I hate more than having to meet the girlfriends of guys [now friends] that I have/had crushes on. It'll be the second time in a week I've had to endure this.   Why me? And this week started off so well...

      For the first time in a really, really long time, I've had a good weekend. A very blessed weekend is a better way of putting it. Next month's rent is paid which means I have more time to find a job and I don't have to move back to Beaumont. Thank God.   I also got new sandals.   Yesterday was dubbed "My Day" which meant I was taken out to eat and money was spent on me. I got groceries (I won't be hungry for the rest of the summer), and of course, new sandals. My aunt was cool and spent most of the day cracking jokes about my choice in toliet paper and my love for Easy Mac.   Fun was had by all.   One thing nagged me though. This morning as we sat outside IHOP (Kerbey Lane North had a 45 minute wait), she turned to me and asked, "Are you happy?" This wasn't a question I was prepared for. So of course, I fibbed and said, "Sure I am."  What constitutes being "happy?" How exactly are you supposed to answer that question? Sure, I'm happy that I don't have to panic about moving home and now I have time to find a job. Yeah I'm happy that I now have food to eat and money to spend. But am I happy overall? Honestly I don't know.

      For over a week now, I've been patiently stalking the mailman in hopes that he'll show up with the remainder of my graduation money. I'm expecting it to show up today, alas the mailman probably won't show up until 5pm. Until then, I'm driving myself crazy in anticipation. I need money. NOW. I'd like to buy some new clothes. Pay some bills. Buy cleaning supplies for my apartment. Stuff like that.   But no, I instead have to wait for the mailman to take his sweet time to show up. Yesterday, he was at the maiboxes around 1:30pm, today at 1:30 he hadn't show up. Argh.  To add to my antsy behavior, my aunt is visiting tomorrow. I haven't seen her in over a year. We're supposed to hang out tomorrow and I'm not exactly sure what we'll do. We're not exactly close and I feel like I'm being put on the spot whenever I'm around her. But lawyers tend to have that effect on me.   So tonight I'll be furiously cleaning my apartment and giving Colby a bath. I want to give the appearance that I have everything under control and that I'm not a hopeless procrastinator.   Happy Friday.

      I'm starting to rethink the whole Moveable Type thing. "But you can customize it," they say. Argh. I don't need a whole lot of "customization" and I start to loathe "customization" when it gets too damned complicated to be worth it.   I'm just in a pissy mood today. Nothing is going right and I'm taking out my frustrations on Moveable Type.

      After playing around with the list of Moveable Type tags, I've finally managed to get my template all worked out. Now if I could only remember the link so I could login and fix the template, my life would be complete.   There isn't much going on in my world, as usual. I'm toying with the idea of buying a  urlLink tote   urlLink bag . I've been using the same purse for quite a while now and I need something bigger and more summer-like. Plus, I need something to do other than mope about being unemployed and not getting any callbacks. Then again, I've only been looking for a job (diligently) for a week now. Something will turn up soon. I hope.   Later I may hang out with dorkus a bit---watch him play video games for an hour to two. I'm almost desperate for male company. I need someone to stare at my boobs and attempt to flirt with me. I'm feeling a bit neglected.   *sigh*  It's not easy being a college graduate.

      Well once I figure out how to navigate Moveable Type and the subdomain, then I'll be moving my site once again. For the moment I'm stuck trying to figure out how to work every thing. Argh. I'm all about simplicity. I don't even know how to use FTP.   *slams head on desk*  This is why I'm using blogger. This is why I used  urlLink diary-x .   Besides that, I still need to find a job.

      I am  thisclose  to getting internet in my apartment. Pay day is Tuesday. I'm calling the Roadrunner people on Monday. My days in this computer lab are numbered.   It's about time. It's been over a year since I've had internet access in my apartment. My computer feels neglected.   I've also decided not to get one of Colby's puppies. I don't really need another dog nor can I actually afford to spend time with it or take care of it. Colby is a handful by himself. Besides, I could really use the $200 that I would get instead of a puppy.   And in car news....I'll be getting a truck [not a new one, mind you] within the next few weeks. I'll discuss the details when I know them.   So life is picking up for me at the moment. It's about damned time.  Work is getting better. My co-workers are down-right funny at times and I spent a lot of time giggling. Not a bad deal I must admit. I guess you need humor in order to survive working in a cramped office all day long.   I'm still doing the online personals thing. I have a love/hate relationship with them but they've gotten me more dates in the past few months than I've had in years. So it's not all bad. Besides, a few days ago I got a message from a guy that is too cute for his own good. I mean seriously cute. And he's tall.   But just too damn cute. So far he seems pretty cool. We'll see how this goes.   I have no plans for this evening, which means I'll be making it a blockbuster night. I've cancelled my netflix subscription until I get some of my bills under control. I miss it already.   Yesterday, I found the greatest pair of jeans at Goodwill for $7.50. They fit in all the right places and make my butt look awesome.   Anyway, that's all for now. I'm going to wander around Half-Price books for a bit.   Happy Saturday.

      So last week,  urlLink this guy  pops up online after not calling or talking to me for two weeks. I figured I had gotten the brush off when he didn't call after our infamous first date [which bore an eerie resemblance to my 3rd date with dorf two years ago].   I was aloof when he came online and gave me the "I've been sooo busy" song and dance that I've heard so many times from other guys that I don't even get annoyed anymore. It's pointless. Annoyance means that you cared. And cared, I did not.   He played the "aloof nice guy that was kind of weirded out by our first date and needed time to think" card and then preceeded to make a big deal about us hanging out sometime. I almost bought it. Almost.   As you can tell, I have no faith in men in general. You guys just tend to disappoint me on a regular basis, or rather I may just have my hopes aimed too high.   Anyway, after that show I thought that I'd actually hear from him and we'd like, you know, hang out, but last week passed with not so much as a peep from him. Once again, I figured I had gotten the brush off. But this time I was pissed. Why make a big deal about us hanging out and then not call?   There was no way in hell I was going to call him. That would make me look desperate, especially after he said that he'd call me.    So yesterday, he pops up online once more and doesn't even bother to give me the "I was too busy" line. He wanted to "hang out" that night. I told him that I wasn't up for that. Then he threw in the line that every guy likes to use to make it seem like  you  were the one bringing up sex even though that's exactly what they want..."it isn't always about sex you know."   Lies. All lies.   Despite knowing that he was lying his little ass off, I decided to go ahead and humor him. Why not? Honestly, I was lonely. It's been a while since I've been around people my own age. The only socializing I do is at work and that's only by force. I get tired of talking to myself or to Colby all the time. I needed another human around even if it was only for a booty call.   I was stupid, I know. I was weak. I am a moron. I'm not kicking myself as hard as I did before. I guess that I've decided to embrace my inherent stupidity.   I'll probably hear from him again, when he's in the mood to get laid once more. Then again, he might actually take me out on a real date. But really, I don't know if I even like him all that much. Well that could be because I don't know him all that well, which makes me seem even more stupid. If he does see fit to call me, I'd probably "hang out" with him again, but only if I have nothing else better to do.   -sigh-  Ah well. Here's to hoping next time he'll buy me dinner first.

      I was reminiscing about Dorf, only momentarily. I was thinking of the time he attempted to teach me how to swim at Barton Springs two years ago. I wrote a couple of entries about the ordeal in my old journal and thought it would be fun to post them here....     lesson #1 from 06.30.2002   he swam further and further out and had the audacity to call out for me to meet him. he didn't realize that i couldn't swim even though i could have sworn i told him like 10 times already that i couldn't fucking swim. instead of just letting me enjoy myself in knee deep water he took it upon himself to try and teach me how to swim.   bad idea seriously.  the entire lesson went like this:  "just hold your arms like this. i'll hold on to you. just push yourself out. no baby i won't let you go. no i promise i won't let you go.  no really i won't let you go. no, you're not gonna drown. see it's not even that deep. c'mon let's try it.  i taught my mom how to swim the same way. no baby you're not gonna drown. i swear you're not gonna drown. calm down okay?  i told you i wasn't gonna let you drown. wait, wait come back. (starts laughing hyserically) please baby it's not that hard.  i promise i won't laugh this time."  needless to say it didn't go well.  after that fiasco we relocated to the deeper end of the lake. i decided this time to watch him swim intead.  he's a great swimmer. i'm never getting into the water again.  as we were leaving he said, "wow you did a lot of swimming today."    lesson #2 from 08.20.2002   dorf tried to teach me how to swim again.   needless to say it did not go well. i knew that already but hell i figured i'd give a shot. who knows? he may have been successful this time in getting me to dunk my head under the water. not. i told him numerous times that i'm afraid of water.  the entire lesson went like this:  "dude, i don't want to learn how to swim. i just want to stand right here by the wall. no don't splash me dammit! i said i'm not moving and there's nothing you can do to change my mind. no let me go. i'm not kidding let me go. no i don't want to hold your hand. it's slippery down there. what if i slip and fall backwards? what do you mean 'big deal'? it is a big deal, i don't want to put my head underwater. i told you before that i'm terrified of water. how many times do i have tell you that?! i swear if you try anything i will do you bodily harm. i'm not kidding. i am fucking serious.  i'm going to the wall now. stay away."  i still can't swim.  Ahhh, good times.

       I know you'd like to thank your shit don't stank But lean a little bit closer See that roses really smell like boo-boo   ---Roses by Outkast  The absolute last place I want to meet guys is on the bus. In fact, I avoid eye contact with everyone on the bus for fear that some guy will take it as an invite for conversation.   So as I rode to campus via the #1, I put on my headphones and turned the volume up to deafening and stared out the window, thus ignoring every passenger on the bus.   But one guy just wouldn't take the hint.  I knew it when he got on the bus. I made the mistake of looking up from my seat in the very back of the bus and he looked at me.   Crap.  What's worst is that his buddy looked at me too and gave his friend that "go talk to her" pat on the arm.  Crap.   I rolled my eyes and looked out the window. He sat next to me, well technically he sat next to my tote bag. I like maintaining as much space as possible between me and the rest of the stinky, heathen bus riders.   I kept looking out of the window. I refused to even turn in his direction. I could feel him smiling at me.   Damn it.   My eye rolling didn't work. Blasting my music on my earphones loud enough for others to hear didn't work. My patented "fuck off" look hadn't worked either. He kept smiling and staring.   It would have been an entirely different situation if I had found the guy even remotely attractive, but I didn't. When I first looked at him, my initial thought was "Oh God please don't let him talk to me."  Even when I got off at the Co-op, the guy looked up at me and smiled some more. For a second I thought he was going to follow me off the bus.   As the bus drove past, he was still smiling at me from the window. He was giving me the look of someone who had just seen their soul mate for the first time.  And the whole time I was  thisclose  to saying "fuck off asshole."  Talk about getting mixed signals.

      My first week of work is officially over now. I somehow managed to survive. Thank God.   I didn't get out of bed until 1:20. I was so tired.   So after leaving the lab today, I plan on going home and relaxing. I know that I need to clean, badly, but I don't care.   Today is my day to relax and enjoy life. Hooray!

      One of the things I detest about working in an office all day is the air conditioning. It's bad enough I have to breathe recycled air all day, but I also have to freeze to death.   Who would image getting relief from sitting out in the hot Texas sun?  I spend my breaks and my lunch hour outside, soaking up that 90+ degree heat in all its scorching splendor.     Tomorrow is Friday and I am glad. So very glad. I will be spending this weekend sleeping and not much else.   Sorry I don't have more to say, my brain isn't functioning fully today. Oh well.

      I'm tired.   I'm too tired to leave the computer lab. The thought of walking to the bus stop makes my head throb and all I want to do is put my head on the desk.   Today has been a long day. I slept through my alarm clock again this morning. I still haven't trained myself to get up early or go to bed early for that matter. I didn't settle down to bed until around midnight last night.   And Colby's not a big help either. That little beastie slept right through my alarm too. In fact, I had to wake him up. Then he had the audacity to bark at me when I did.   To further add insult to injury, the humdity was 90% this morning. Anything over 50% will fuck up my hair royally. When it's 90% I don't even bother combing my hair. But I have to comb my hair even though it turns into this nappy mass of fuzz within 5 seconds of setting foot outdoors.   For the past two days, I've shown up to work looking like a Haitian refugee. None of my clothes want to fit this week---I'm bloated with nappy hair.   Also, having to be indoors all day sucks all the color from my skin and I look pale and ashy.   A pale, ashy, nappy-headed, Haitian refugee with a scowl that would make Satan cower in fear. No wonder no one will talk to me.  I figured that things would pick up during my lunch power-hour. I had brought some leftover hamburger helper which I was definitely looking forward to eating. I got into the cafeteria and found a table near the window. I set down my book, cd player and my can of root beer then headed across the cafeteria to the microwave.   Life was good as I watched my bowl of beef taco spin around in the microwave. Three minutes later, I headed back across the cafeteria only to find that my table had been taken over by one of the "mentally disabled" workers from the other division.   Granted, I have nothing against the mentally disabled. I would have gladly shared my table with her, had she asked. But no, this bitch took over my table and gave me the "fuck you" look when I showed up to claim it.   This pissed me off. But I didn't want to seem like the asshole who gets into a fight with the mentally disabled over a table. Even though it was mine first. Besides, she looked like she could have kicked my ass if she wanted to, it just wasn't worth it.   So I spent my lunch-hour outside on a bench. Although it was pretty hot outside, it felt better than getting my ass handed to me because of a table.   I spent the remainder of the afternoon watching the clock. My head was throbbing and I started to feel claustrophobic. From now on, I'm going to bring some advil with me to work in case I get another headache.   When my head wasn't hurting, work was fine.   As soon as the clock struck five, I bolted out of the office and crossed the street to catch the #1 downtown. It was computer lab time. Honestly, I loathe having to ride the #1 because there are more dirty hippies and bums riding the #1 than any other bus.   Everyday, never fails, someone who smells like burnt cheese will sit next to me on the bus. Today, however, the stench was a mixture of b.o. and cheap liquor. Having to sit next to these stinky bastards makes me smell bad too. I'm stinky by association.   So now I'm stinky, with a headache, bloated, wearing ill-fitting clothes, trying to tame my nappy hair,  along with pale, ashy skin and I'm too tired to leave the computer lab to go home.   *Sigh*  Man, it feels good to be employed.

      I do nothing but sit at a table and shuffle paper all day. I date-stamp, then shuffle. Paper clip some forms, then shuffle some more. Eight hours spent moving forms from pile to pile until they end up in a cabinet only to be shuffled later by someone else.   Eight hours spent in the basement, affectionately referred to as the "ground floor," shuffling paper while bobbing my head to the music blaring into my ears via my earphones. This music keeps me sane. It prevents me from having to listen to the inane banter being tossed about from cubicle to cubicle with blatant disregard for intelligence or even subject-verb agreement.   Hours upon hours of trying to pass through narrow corridors when there's a 300+ pound woman trying to come down the same hall in the opposite direction. And just when you think you've passed her, there are three more just waiting for their turn to waddle their way back to their cubicles.   I cringe whenever I see food now because I see so many 300+ pound women munching down on it. I think to myself,  Oh God if I eat that food, I'll turn into one of them.   It's ridiculous, I know. But I had a similar reaction at the IRS and because I had no willpower, I gained 15 pounds while I worked there. The thought of that scares me and I spend my lunch hour with that same fear. I'll be bringing my lunch from now on.  Despite my loss of appetite, my lunch hour is my power-hour. It's the only time that I feel totally at peace with the world and my situation as a glorified paper-shuffler. I can read and listen to music while I munch on pb&j and ignore the people around me.   Kind of reminds me of college.   Once I take those magic earphones off, my ears are subject to some of the dumbest conversations known to man. Actually the conversations aren't at fault. It's the butchering of the English language that causes my ears to bleed.   "What song that is?" and other witty musings are shared between my superiors.   Then they have the audacity to give me those patronizing, condescending glances whenever I walk into a room because I'm "new" and don't know the ropes yet.   I am on the bottom rung and I have a college degree. They are my bosses and they barely passed high school.  Eight (technically nine) hours spent in a basement with co-workers who'd prefer to stare into space instead of actually getting more work done, and comment that I'm working "too fast" and need to "slow down."   I've been working for two days and already I'm annoyed. I'm not complaining or anything. It's hard to believe, but I actually like my job.   Paper shuffling is quiet and time-consuming. I can listen to music all day and not have to interact with my co-workers. There's no typing, no answering the phone, no greeting customers.   It's the kind of job that I wanted. I asked for it and now I have it.   And for that I am eternally grateful.

      Awww damn it! Curse this insatiable horniness within me!   It's the only reason I'm even talking to  urlLink this guy . Well, not the  only  reason. But usually I avoid short white guys like the plague.   So why is this one getting attention from me? Honestly, I don't know. It's not that I want hump him all the time or anything like that. Then again, maybe that is it and I'm trying to justify it by pretending that I hold some interest in this guy.  Or maybe I am interested in him and just being too stubborn to admit it?  Aww hell, I don't even know anymore.  I'm just a bundle of confused nerves. I don't know what I want or who I want it from. All I know is that one day, I'm gonna have to grow up. Hopefully, it'll be sooner rather than later.

      Colby is a daddy now. Three bundles of puppy joy were born around 1:15 today. I am ecstatic. About 8 weeks from today, I get to bring one home.   Work was mindless and tiresome, just like any other job. It bore an eerie resemblance to my old job at the IRS. I'm practically doing the same things at my new job.   I get an hour long lunch break which is pretty nice, but sucks just the same. Since I don't have a car or money I'm confined to the cafeteria.   Anyway, I need to go home and mentally prepare myself for tomorrow, and the next day, and the next day, and so on.....

      Tomorrow morning I start my new job. I'm excited about it.&nbsp; It's about time that I actually had a job.    I'll have to get up at 5:30 am to get ready for work. I know that seems&nbsp;kind of early, but bear in mind that I have to ride the bus. &nbsp;I have to be there at 8.    I was supposed to wash my khaki pants earlier, but I've spent most of the day goofing around and drinking tea.   I was also supposed to clean my apartment, so far I've only managed to put the dishes in the dishwasher.   Ah well. It's not like anyone's coming over any time soon.   Shit. I just realized that former roomie is coming by tomorrow.   Damn it. Now I have to clean.  *Sigh*   Well I hope my new job turns out to be good.

      First of all I want to share my great news with all of you. All you who have read and/or listened to whine and groan about being unemployed for 2 years, I thank you for putting up with my ranting. Now my journal will take another turn as I change from unemployed college grad, to employed&nbsp;college grad.  &nbsp;  Yeah, that's right, I GOT A JOB!!!  &nbsp;  A real job in which I'll get paid and&nbsp; finally be able to pay my bills on time.&nbsp; Thank you God, because I was on the brink of insanity.  &nbsp;  So yah, I start my new job on Monday. And peep this, I'll have the weekends off.  &nbsp;  Can it get any better?  &nbsp;  Aside from that, even though i have no desire to see this  urlLink movie , I still think this camel is too damn cute.

      Today is just as boring as yesterday was, and I haven't done anything worth posting about in the past few days.&nbsp; It's not really a bad thing, it's nice to have a down period when there's nothing pressing on my mind.  &nbsp;  It's a breath of fresh air.  &nbsp;  I'm obsessed with buying CDs again and since Tower has closed,&nbsp; I'll be frequenting Waterloo a lot more. Not really a bad thing.  &nbsp;  Anyway, I decided to recycle a post I made on my  urlLink old journal &nbsp; about piracy. The post is about a year old, but I think it's still relevant today.  &nbsp;  It's cleverly titled "Put an End to Piracy---My Ass." Enjoy.     $20 million per movie. $20 fucking-million-per-movie. Julia Roberts makes that and the last 4 movies that she’s been in have sucked. the money from one movie should be enough for her to live on for the rest of her life.   but you get these stupid commercials with Ben Affleck and James Cameron talking about how much piracy hurts the people that work hard to make movies. not them specifically, but the people that do the actual work.   on the other side of the coin, we have the music industry. they’re suing people for downloading music. they have the audacity to act surprised at how many people would rather download music illegally than pay $18.99 for the CD.   why is this?   it’s because people are fucking fed up with having to spend their hard-earned money on worthless crap. I’ll gladly spend $18.99 for a CD, if the album is actually good. but there’s no way in hell I’m going to pay that much for a shitty CD just so some rap artist can buy matching Bentleys for his cousins or put a 24-karat gold ceiling in his house (Master P). nor will I pay $8.00 to watch a stupid movie so Ben Affleck can buy J-Lo a ring that cost $4 million.   they can kiss my black ass.   the only people that are actually suffering are the poor ones as usual. these rich bastards filing lawsuits aren’t suffering one bit. they’re not fighting for the little guy. they don’t give a shit for the people on the bottom rung. don’t believe for one second that everyone’s gonna get a raise from all the revenue generated by settling lawsuits. if anything, there’ll be a lot of layoffs.   if they want piracy to end, then they should put out something worth spending money on. want more people at the movies? put out a movie with an actual plot. realize that most people have functioning brains (hence the rise in piracy) and that a whole bunch of pretty special effects won’t divert our attention from the rest of the movie.   stop giving us CDs with two decent songs and 10 filler songs. I don’t give a shit how “hard” the artist worked on those two songs. not only that, but I don’t care who writes the songs. just as long as when I decide to buy the CD that at least 85% of it is actually good.   as a consumer I feel that I am justified in what I’m asking. as with any other product out there---if it lacks in quality expect it to lack in sales. expect people to demand something better. and expect them to get it by any means necessary.   stop giving us shit and then getting pissed when we discover how bad it smells.   and for fuck’s sake quit making commercials about the evils of piracy. do you actually think that giving us a guilt trip from actors that make $20 million per movie is really gonna get us to stop?   if images of starving children in Africa can’t guilt us into spending money, don’t think that Ben Affleck can.

      I'm done kicking myself over last Friday. No more wallowing in my own self-loathing or complaining about men. I need a break from my usual habits of whining about things beyond my control and wallowing.   Once again my mind is idle and I need something to do, something to think about other than guys that I'm not dating.   I've been spending a lot of time hanging out in various coffee shops reading and such but that only keeps me occupied for a short amount of time. I have the attention span of a gnat and my passion for reading has just about evaporated. I can only sit in the shop for an hour or two before I have to leave in search of something else to do.  I'm thinking about taking my personals ads down. I'm not meeting any guys that I'd actually be interested in. In fact, I've attracted more morons in the past couple of weeks through the personals than I have in real life. That is sad.   Aside from that, my apartment complex will [hopefully] be set up for wireless internet in the near future. This means I'd never have to come to the computer lab again.   Wouldn't that be great?

      I am  thisclose  to swearing off men again.  I don't want to do it, but it may be for my own good. I'm so reckless at the moment that if I were to come across a nice guy, I'd quite surely botch it up.   My sister says that I need stability and balance in my life and that if I had a decent boyfriend [one that stayed around for more than a couple of months], I'd probably calm the fuck down. However, attaining a decent boyfriend is proving to be both tiresome and annoying.   Regardless to how hard I try to seek out different guys I keep ending up with the same assholes occupying different bodies. Not all guys are assholes and I know this, which makes me believe that it's not the guys that I'm choosing, it's me.   I keep thinking that if I meet the right guy then whatever issues I have going on in my head will magically get worked out just by having him around. This is not so.   How can I expect someone to want to be bothered with me when most days I don't want to be bothered with myself?   Most guys don't even have to be assholes for me to automatically lose interest in them. Sometimes I just take one look at them and shake my head. "I'd drive this poor boy insane," I think to myself. Or "Once he gets to know me, he's going to haul ass in the opposite direction."  Issues.  I have to get my head together and try to figure out why I act this way ALL THE DAMN TIME. If I don't, I'm going to be one of those old ladies who talk to stray cats all day.

      I am a moron. The one thing I swore I wouldn't do, I did with such reckless abandon that I thought I had momentarily lost my damn mind.   I'm referring to my date last Friday. No point going into detail. If you know me well [or if you've been reading my blog for a while], then you already know what I've done.   Aside from that, I got a weird letter in the mail on Saturday. It had my address printed on it, with a Massachusetts postmark but no return address. At first, I thought it was just another letter from some student loan consolidation company, but they usually put a return address on the envelope.   Once I opened the letter, I pulled out an article about student loan consolidation that had been carefully and deliberately torn from some magazine. On the first page there was a yellow note fashioned to look like a post-it with a printed message that read: "Thought this would be of interest to you" with only the letter "J" as the signature. No other letter, no explanation. Nothing.  It fucking freaked me out.   I started going over all the people I knew whose names started with a "J" and I can only think of a couple but neither of them even live in Massachusetts nor have my address.   I'm still kind of freaked out by it. I wish I knew who sent it because I will continue to be freaked out until I find out who did it.   So yeah, that was my weekend. How was yours?

      I want to learn how to salsa. Or maybe tango. Rumba sounds cool too. Perhaps even mambo.   That was just a random though. No meaning behind it whatsoever.  Anyway, tonight is my coffee date. It's only 4 1/2 hours away. I'm a bit nervous but not too much. The guy already seems a bit impressed by me, so we'll just see how it goes.   I plan on being on my best behavior. Minimal profanity, no alcohol. Wouldn't want him to get the wrong idea.   Not yet anyway.   Happy Friday, y'all.

      I think I've officially reached a low point in my life when my sister ends conversations about me dating with either "don't get drunk" or "don't botch this up."   Gee, thanks sis.  Well it's understandable. I have a habit of botching up potential relationships just by being myself, at my worst. If I get nervous and there's alcohol around...you'd best believe I will be waking up in the back seat of a cab. Or I'll turn into horny-bitch-overdrive and try to hump the poor guy as soon as possible, to distract him from trying to get to know me.   What it all boils down to is that I don't like opening up. In fact, I'm terrified of it. I try to remain as emotionless as possible at all times. An iron reserve.   How bad could I possibly be, you ask?  I've been best friends with Guitar Guy for 7 years now and he's never seen me cry. Not even when something really fucked up happened. Not one tear. I've been around people who have cried for lesser things but not me. Not ever.  I get this from my mom and my dad. Both of them had their moments of stoic behavior and it has manifested itself within me and I have embraced it.   Add this to the trust issues that I already have and you can see why I don't date that often nor do I date anyone seriously.   But perhaps it's time for a behavior change. It's more than apparent that with my current behavior pattern I'll probably push away any decent guys that I come into contact with.   This must stop.   I have to change my attitude towards men if I ever expect to keep one around. I'm not talking about a whole personality overhaul, merely just not being as negative as I tend to be. Giving guys a fair shake instead of putting them in the "asshole" box before getting a chance to know them.   Easier said than done. But I'll give it a try.

      I know that I'm cute. Seems a bit arrogant, I know. It took me  years  to reach the point in my life where I believe that I'm cute. Still sometimes I question it, but more often than not, I'm a bit cocky about my looks. And it only gets worse if I've been drinking. Then I think I'm the shit.   I'm such a hottie. How could you not want to hit this? The smile, the great skin. I should be fighting off guys with a stick.   Of course, I'm being sarcastic.  Most days I look in the mirror and cringe, especially if I haven't bothered to fix my hair that day. So whenever I get responses to my personals ad with guys saying that they find it hard to believe that I'm actually single, I treat it as empty flattery (almost redundant).   Sure, yeah I'm cute or whatever. Honestly, I don't find it hard to believe that I'm single. I'm neurotic with a host of idiosyncrasies that no normal man could possibly find attractive.

      So yah, this weekend was alright. I started out on Friday watching movies and lounging around. On Saturday morning, I got up earlier than usual and started cleaning. My plan for that day was to clean and then spend the remainder of the evening reading or watching television.   Instead, I found myself downtown with the flux and her "date." He was cool. Meets the minimal requirements. He likes the Pixies. He likes Modest Mouse. He's the right height. Right weight. Right personality. Employed. College graduate. Has a car that works. Could possibly be a virgin [I'm not known as the " urlLink Deflowerer " for nothing].    And I think he's more interested in the flux than with me. Don't know that for sure, it's just a feeling that I have. Then again, I could be wrong. I was drunk at the time. My judgment was impaired. I can't remember every detail. Hopefully he does find me interesting because flux has already put him in the "friend box."   So how do I even approach this situation? Do I call the guy up and say, "Hey even though things didn't work out with flux--I'm here. And I'm cute. And yeah, I like Modest Mouse. You know you want me."  And what if he's not interested in me? Oh man, that would suck.   Honestly, I have too much time on my hands. I need a real job so I'll have something else to think about. Thinking about the boys always takes up too much time.

      I seriously fucking hate the 80s.   I realized this weekend as I browsed the various radio stations that Austin has to offer. One station in particular played 80s nonstop for the entire weekend.  I wanted to scream.  It's bad enough that damn near every station in this damn city plays the same 12 songs from the 80s at least once an hour, every hour, every day. But do dedicate three whole days to it? That's abominable.   Then to play covers of the same 12 fucking songs...WHAT THE FUCK? If I hear that fucking 311 cover of "Love Song" one more time, someone's getting stabbed in the eye with a pencil.   The 80s spanned 10 YEARS just like every other decade which means it produced 10 YEARS worth of music. Crowded House had other songs. Stop playing Tears for Fears for fuck's sake. The Cure have a new album.   Just let the 80s go.

      Why can't I just nurse one beer for the duration of the night? Why must I always drink so much that I spend the next day in a daze, kicking myself because I can't remember what I did [or said] the night before?  And why, oh why, do middle aged white guys keep sending me replies to my personals ad? So you're 44, divorced with two kids and unemployed....of course I don't want to date you. We have nothing in common. Why are you emailing me?  Oh wait, I know why.  It's because I mentioned that I liked  urlLink Yes  in my profile and the average Yes fans are middle aged white guys.  So yeah, it figures.

      Tomorrow morning I'm going to a temp/employment agency. Hopefully something good will come from it.   I spent the better part of this afternoon scouring the mall for decent business casual clothing at a reasonable [read: cheap] price. Once again I found myself in Burlington Coat Factory. After an hour of laughing out loud at some of the most ridiculous clothing I've ever seen, I bought two shirts and a tote bag/purse [my third tote bag this summer] all for $32.  Not bad, not bad at all considering I had initially planned to buy one shirt at Learner New York for the same price. I bought my pants from Learner for $43. I have a hard time finding pants that fit me in all the right places and I usually end up spending a lot of money on them. I don't mind though. I plan on wearing them quite often in the next few months.   I awoke this morning to the sound of my cell phone ringing from the living room. It wasn't ringing exactly, but playing a midi version of Strawberry Fields. I'm still searching for the Bullwinkle theme. I loathed the cartoon, but the tune is catchy.  Anyway, I snapped up right in the middle of a weird dream that I was having. Part of me was kind of pissed, I wanted to know how my dream would end. On the other hand, I needed to get out of bed before noon for once and the ringing pissed me off so much that I couldn't go back to sleep.   Despite my abrupt wake up call, I managed to remember most of my dream. It seemed a bit symbolic, but I never really believe that my dreams mean anything.   Anyway, the dream began with my siblings and I running up hill to beat a pretty horrible storm that was looming behind us. My siblings managed to get up the hill pretty fast but I was lagging behind. I had a huge backpack that I was trying to carry and no one was trying to help me. My siblings kept telling me to hurry up but I lagged behind even further.   Then the setting changed and I was in the home of one my neighbors from Beaumont. A neighbor that had died maybe 5 or so years ago. She was seated in her living room watching television as I laid on a bed on the other side of the room. Her granddaughter [I didn't even know she had one] was in another room with her husband. A little boy, I assumed it was her great-grandson, walked into the room with a ball. He kept running back and forth from the living room to the other room with his mother, trying to get her attention.   My neighbor told the boy that it was no use trying to get her attention. She was dying of something and it wouldn't be long before she would be gone. I sighed and my eyes got watery. I looked at my neighbor and said, "That's such a shame. She's too young to die."  She turned her attention to me and said, "I wouldn't be crying for her if I were you. Your time's coming pretty soon too." Then the damn phone rang.   Does this mean anything? I doubt it. I've never been one for dream interpretation. But I do know that I woke up this morning and decided I needed to take action with my life. I had been too passive aggressive with my job search. I needed to speak to a human rather than continue with emailing my resume and hoping for the best.   So wish me luck for tomorrow. Perhaps I'll get a job or at least a push in the right direction.

      There's nothing I can write about without the fear of having to explain myself later. So for now, I'm going to remain as vague as possible about goings on in my little world.   Work was annoying. Often during the day, I fantasized about banging my head against my desk and calling my co-worker a "lazy fucking cunt." Not exactly the nicest thing I could say to a person, but this co-worker worked my last nerve by screwing up the simplest tasks then pretending that it was no big deal.   For lunch I had to eat at KFC. It's slim pickings when the bus is my only source for transportation. I'm pissed that I spent $4.50 on chicken strips that tasted like plywood.   Last night I considered giving my booty on call his walking papers, but then I changed my mind. Who in their right mind would toss away free sex? I must have been nuts thinking that I could part ways with that.   It would be different if the guy was a jerk, but he's nice. So until something more permanent makes its presence known, I'm going to stick with the booty on call.   So there.   Anyway, I'm going to Gap to buy myself a reward for not screaming at my co-workers.   Go me.  Also, in reference to yesterday's post, that certain person already knows about my date.   Shit.  I knew there had to be a catch.

      It's a small fucking world.   My date last night was awesome, by the way. I won't go into how awesome because the realization was made that we both know the same person.   And that same person reads this blog.   I'm not saying that this person is prone to sabotage, but I honestly don't want this new guy to know about my blog and I definitely don't want the person who reads this blog to know who I went out with.  If that makes any sense.   It's censorship time, folks. So I'm deciding whether to go through and delete some entries, to save a lot of "foot in mouth" time later on, or to just leave my blog as is and just play dumb.   Either way, I'm still screwed.

      I spent most of Sunday as previously mentioned, watching Season Six of the X-Files. I've gotten through the first two discs and I'm eagerly awaiting the arrival of the next ones.   Thank you Netflix.  And it's official now, I have a "sex partner." I know that's what everyone wanted me to get. After years of bouncing around being commitment phobic and scaring decent guys away, I finally have a "sex partner."   Congratulate me. I know you want to. It's every girl's dream to be on booty call 24/7...to have a guy come over with the intent to get laid and not much else.  And I am living that dream.   The dream of never introducing him to my friends because it would painfully obvious to everyone that we know very little about each other because haven't had many conversations. And the conversations that we have had are always on the same topic [and you already know what it is].  My daddy would be proud.  I aim to remedy my current situation by going out with someone else and not screwing it up by having sex.   That's right. You heard me. I'm going out with someone else tonight and I'm determined for it to go smoothly. I'm going to move at the speed of a special olympic hurdler.  We'll see how this goes.

      My obsession with the  urlLink X-Files  has reached an all time high and I blame Netflix.  Because of Netflix, I am able to get all 9 seasons of the X-Files. The sad thing is, I'm only looking for certain episodes, mainly episodes where Mulder and Scully get all cutesy.   Sure, I like the scary ones...the ones that make me sleep with my lights on. Those are cool and I watch those too.   But I like the episodes where there's a hint at something more going on between Mulder and Scully. In fact, I like that more than them actually saying it out loud. The "it could happen" factor was much more engaging than them actually going ahead and kissing or something---which is why seasons 8 and 9 annoyed me to no end.   Alas, I am a dork and I'll probably spend the rest of my afternoon proving just how dorky I can be by watching Disc 1 of Season 6.

      My Saturday was a busy one. That hasn't happened in a long, long time. I was Miss Popularity yesterday, my phone rang so many times that I couldn't keep up. I'm glad that I'll be buying a new one in the near future.  Saturday started off normal as usual. I slept until about noon, then around 12:30 I got a knock on my door. It was former roomie whom I hadn't seen since graduation. We ran our mouths for a bit then headed out to Threadgill's, another restaurant that I hadn't been to in at least a year.  We had the cutest waiter and I batted my eyelashes and smiled at him the whole time. Roomie tried to get me to write my number on the receipt, but I refused to do it. I already have one too many guys on my plate at the moment.  Besides, I'm no good at flirting or anything while sober.   Afterwards, we headed back to her sister's apartment and spent most of the afternoon getting drunk and watching Michael Jackson's Back or White video.   We also relived one our favorite college pastimes: Daily D'Angelo.  Daily D'Angelo started when we first saw his "Untitled/How does it Feel?" video in which he stands buck naked in front of a camera and sings. That's it. They do close-ups of his well chiseled and sweaty body for over four minutes. It's beautiful.   But back in college, we used to watch his video [via launch.com] every day before class. It gave us hope for the day.   After watching that video, we danced around to "Don't Stop Til You Get Enough" and drank more beer and wine.   Later, roomie's sister returned and we sat outside talking about her Hispanic neighbor's blue eyed baby and questioned who the father might really be. Fun was had by all.   I talked to another friend of mine, whom I hadn't spoken to in a while. He asked me to refer to him as The Supreme King of something or other, I can't remember. Anyway, we talked for ten minutes or so. I drank more beer.   Then  urlLink this guy  called me. It was weird, I hardly ever hear from him on Saturdays. He must really like me or something.   I spent the remainder of my night downtown, drinking even more beer with the flux. By the time I had gotten downtown, I was quite inebriated and had lost count of how many drinks I had.  Fun was had by all until the cab ride back to flux's apartment. We were discussing boobs when the cab driver insisted that we discuss something more positive. What's more positive than talking about boobs? Everyone loves boobs. They make people happy.   So I started talking about Jesus and college. That killed the conversation quickly and we rode the rest of the way in silence. The cab driver got a 50 cent tip.  When it rains, it pours. I enjoyed my busy Saturday and will probably harp on it for months to come.   And despite all my drinking yesterday, I managed to wake up at 8:25 this morning without a hangover, which is both chilling and liberating.

      Today was my fuck-up day at work. I couldn't concentrate and fucked up at least 4 times on things that had I been in my right frame of mind I would have never overlooked.   I put the wrong forms in the wrong baskets. I wasn't paying attention and allowed an incomplete form to find its way into a stack of complete forms. I left some envelopes stapled to some other forms and they should have been removed. I forgot to date-stamp other forms.   It just wasn't my day. My co-workers and my boss were in good spirits about the whole mess. They've fucked up too on more than one occasion. Besides, it was the first time in three weeks that I had messed up something or in my case, a lot of somethings.   When it rains, it pours.   Overall, it wasn't a bad day. I spent a lot of time laughing with my co-workers as they made snide remarks and joked about everyone from our boss to other temps. It was hilarious. Though it did nothing to help my concentration, I still welcomed the laughter.  Aside from that,  urlLink this guy  keeps making appearances. Not last night though. But he keeps on popping up.   Part of me wants him to go away. But that is the self-sabotage Neemie.   Self-sabotage Neemie keeps saying things that result in her foot being inserted in mouth on a regular basis. Things that could possibly push the aforementioned guy away. You see, Self-sabotage Neemie is also ruled by Horny Neemie who doesn't care about anyone or anything as long as she gets laid.   Of course this means that she won't bother even trying to get to know this guy, she'll just put him in the "fuckable asshole" box and go on her merry way.   [It's weird how I can just talk about myself in the 3rd person and it makes sense]  So yeah, that is what's going on in my head at the moment. I won't give a nice guy a real chance. Though I doubt that at this point he even cares about that. Then again, I never bothered to ask him what he thinks.  -sigh-  One of these days I'm going to stop bouncing around so much and allow a guy to be around me without me doing something to screw it all up.   But until that happens, I'm just going to smile and enjoy the sex.   Bad Neemie.

      My brother is such a dork. Seriously, the stuff he comes up with sometimes just boggles my mind. And he says these ridiculous things with such conviction that you wonder if he's actually joking or not. Either way, it's funny as hell.  Case in point, during my afternoon break I called my little sister in Alaska [she flies back to Texas tonight] and we get into an argument about how big her butt is.   Not the "your ass is huge, you need to lose weight" argument, but the one argument that only black women can have amongst themselves: whose butt is the biggest and how can I make mine bigger without everything else going to hell?  My little sister swears that her butt is getting bigger and I tell the poor kid that she inherited the skinny genes from the family. The chances of her butt expanding beyond what it is now is out of the question. She's damn near 6 ft and skinny. She will not be getting a ghetto booty any time soon.  While my sister is desperately trying to convince me that her butt is getting bigger, my brother is yelling nonsense in the background.   His theory is that butt expansion [and some weight gain] is directly related to fucking.  I kid you not.   So while my sister was talking to me, he yelled "Your ass won't get big until you start fucking."  I laughed at him, thinking how much of a moron my brother can be. My little sister laughed too and said, "Ooo...you so stupid."  "Y'all think I'm playing," he said. "But it's true. I noticed Neemie had put on some weight last time I saw her."  My little sister laughed so hard she dropped the phone.   "Your brother is crazy," she said as if he weren't her brother too.   I, however, was mortified. Shit. My brother knows that I get laid.   It's no big surprise. The only one in denial about my sexual escapades is my dad and I hope that he remains in denial for the rest of his life. My brother doesn't care as long as I don't get fucked up beyond repair.   He just likes to tease me like all brothers enjoying doing to their younger sisters.   It was a much needed laugh, my work days are long and boring at times.

      So I'm all excited because finally I can afford to have internet access in my apartment.   I call up the Roadrunner people during my morning break. I can barely contain my excitement. I was practically skipping to the lobby to use the phone.  Happy, I tell you. I was happy.   Then once I gave the lady all my information she said those damning words that sent my good mood straight to hell:  "Well our first available time for installation will be August 14th."  August 14th? WTF?  I have to wait  TWO WEEKS  before you can send someone over to flip a switch?  -sigh-  It figures.
