          Well, I am officially exhausted. The adrenaline has run out - for now. I could have slept all day, but we had another full day of orientation/training.       Also, I forgot to mention that yesterday when Nate and I were out and about in Hong Kong, I made a trip to a public restroom that looked all fine and dandy. To my surprise, this bathroom had no toilet paper and people had to bring their own. Fortunately I had some napkins to use...I guess this isn't so rare in China, but I was not expecting it to happen in Hong Kong. That's traveling though, right? Prepare for anything!

        I was going to wait until I got to Zhanjiang to put more thoughts out there, but I'm in the mood to articulate some thoughts now.  By the way, if you're actually reading this and checking out my blog, you rock!  I'm not sure who of you out there will do this, but I hope it's a fun way for those of you interested in my perception of a new culture to stay informed.          That aside, let's get down to business!  After a slow weekend start, Sunday rolled around and I wanted to go further into the city and explore some more.  Nate and I had not gone and explored as a couple yet since we're constantly surrounded by our fellow volunteers who have quickly become new friends.  Today was our only opportunity, so off we went...              I'm not sure why, but until today I haven't really felt like a foreigner here.  Pretty much everywhere you go, there is Chinese and English on the signage, and the majority of the people can speak English.  However, wherever we were today, we were constantly reminded of our non-Chinese backgrounds.  On a few of the crowded streets, Nate was definitely the only "white guy" and by far the tallest.  It was the first time since being here that people were staring at us with confusion.  Since this was my first experience with this in Hong Kong, I didn't really mind it.  It humored me up actually.  We found a Vegetarian restaurant (we somehow always manage to do this, don't we?!) and the server spoke to me in Cantonese the entire time.  Even though Nate would reply back to her in English or attempt to speak Mandarin, she just kept talking to me.  I found this rather strange since I clearly was not replying back.  I just smiled awkwardly and kept looking at Nate for assistance.  When our appetizer arrived, a beautiful shiny fork came with it - and it was clear that it was meant for Nate's usage.            The crowded market areas we ventured into had what I pictured China to have: lots of fresh produce, hanging poultry and old men with no shirts smoking.  It also had what I wasn't expecting: a kiosk just selling bras, fish and seafood practically jumping out of their shallow tanks onto the sidewalk, many 7-11 convenience stores, men butchering slabs of meat on tree stumps, and people burning things in tiny garbage cans.  I smiled when a girl walked by with a tank top that read: "I'm a mango girl."  The random written English phrases on some of the clothing here is hilarious.  I wonder if the Chinese characters on clothing in the USA is equally hilarious to Chinese people?          Hmmmm...maybe my experience today was preparing me for what life is going to be like in China.  Until today's adventure, I've been sheltered by being in very touristy areas of Hong Kong.  Wherever we were today, were not so touristy and for that I'm thankful.  I think I've been craving a more realistic experience of what it is like to be Asian-American in Asia.  Perhaps if you check back in with me in the middle of January, I may not be so cheery about this, but then again, maybe I'll be fine.            Good night all...it's past midnight here in Hong Kong.

        As we were landing, we could see all the buildings that comprised Hong Kong. I didn't know what to expect, but since the city I had been to with the most buildings was New York, I was picturing something along those lines...and I did see that but I saw what seemed like 4 or 5 New Yorks packed into one very dense space. It was mind boggling! At the airport, we managed to find Kevin, one of the coordinators with Maryknoll whom I have known since college. It was nice to have someone there to "escort" us to the Maryknoll house, in which we had no idea how to get to. Kevin got our train tickets and got us a taxi, and before you knew it we were seeing one of the largest cities in the world pass us by. Kevin commented that in Hong Kong, buildings go one way: UP!          The Maryknoll house is very pleasant. It is located in perhaps the most "posh" area of Hong Kong. It's called the Stanley area, and most of the apartments in this area go for $5,000-$6,000/month - US dollars! There are a lot of fancy resorts around here, too. The outside of the house has a traditional East Asian architecture, while the inside feels very much like a nice college dormitory. We had arrived in time for lunch, so we joined the other volunteer teachers who had already arrived and began our first introductions. I was exhausted after not having slept at all on the plane and very little in the Incheon Airport, but when adrenaline wants to kick in, it does and I guess the human body can withstand anything.          Some people wanted to go to the beach which is just a hop, skip and jump away, so after throwing our luggage down in our "Newlywed Suite" we changed into our bathing suits and joined the rest of the gang. The beach was very crowded as it was a Sunday and the sun was showing through the hazy sky every now and again. This was my first time swimming in ocean water, and wow was it salty! It felt great to be in the water and relax, but the bottom of the water was filled with rocks, rocks that made it very difficult to walk on. In fact, later when we all had returned to the Maryknoll house, we discovered that about half of us got some type of gash on the feet! I managed to avoid a gash, but Nate got a nice one on his right foot.          After dinner Sunday evening, Nate and I went straight to bed. It was only about 8:00 pm here, but I knew I had to sleep. The next day we were to begin our orientation and training on becoming English teachers in China.          Monday through Friday was filled with many lectures, activities and opportunities to gain as much information as we could so when we all headed for the mainland to our respective universities, we had some idea on what we were getting into. There were nearly 20 of us volunteers, 9 of whom were St. Ben's/St. John's graduates, and the rest from all over - Massachussetts, Illinois, Indiana, New York...getting to know everyone in the last week has felt a lot like freshmen college orientation. We have all commented on this feeling, but yet how we're in Hong Kong overlooking the sea, so it's definitely an idyllic setting. Most of the volunteers are younger than myself, having just graduated from college and being around 22. There are a few volunteers who are well over the age of 45, too. Those of us in the "Under 26" category have enjoyed livin' it up. Please feel free to use your imagination with this. I will admit I've had some expensive drinks here in Hong Kong ($4 shots, $6 beers). Maybe this is a good time to list some very basic observations of Hong Kong:       It's a fairly expensive city - prices are pretty equivalent to any big city in the USA, and in some cases higher! There are McDonalds EVERYWHERE. As a group we've walked around and hummed the extremely irritating melody "Ba-duh-duh-duh-daaaaa...I'm lovin' it!" It is a very dense city. I can't believe how many people live in such close corners. The buildings at nighttime are gorgeous, far better than any night skyline I've ever seen in the USA - they light the buildings up in every color imaginable. There are definitely some sketchy bar areas loaded with prostitutes. The markets are packed and sell everything imaginable, but nothing so far that I've wanted badly enough to buy. I did see some cute Sesame Street figurines that I almost bought, but realized I really didn't need. The public transportation is great, but unfortunately the area that the Maryknoll house is in is on top of a hill and requires a very bumpy, windy ride down to get to where the action is. I've had motion sickness dozens of times since getting here. You see lots of European, Australian and USA folk around here - in some places it is easy to forget you're in Asia. There seem to be a lot of Indian restaurants and therefore people who live here. Restaurant employees hand out flyers and deals to sway you into eating at their restaurant. Some downright follow you and beg you to eat at their restaurant. This is one experience in which my Asian ethnicity came in handy. I didn't get nearly as many people asking me to buy stuff or eat at their restaurant as my Caucasian counterparts did. This city never sleeps. Bar time closings do not apply. I should know, last night a group of us were out past 3am and the bars were still hopping. Every street is bright and reminds me of Times Square in New York City. It truly is unbelievable.    Well, we depart for the mainland this week. Perhaps when I'm more settled there, I can write more about my new experiences in China, which is sure to be quite different than Hong Kong. Hong Kong is a touristy city, and I can easily walk around and speak English without confusing the locals. On the mainland, I'm not quite so sure that will happen. We'll see... ba-duh-duh-duh-daaaa...

         If you feel adventurous and think you may want to come and visit Nate and I, please consider flying into Hong Kong...      The Maryknoll House in Hong Kong is fantastic (hopefully you've checked out the picture of the ocean view we have) and they are open to us having visitors stay here for $25/night! Moms and Dads are free...      At this point, Nate and I aren't EXPECTING any visitors from "back home." We know that financially a round-trip ticket can turn anyone off, but if you do at any point feel inspired to check out another side of the world you can certainly let us know and we'd be happy to help with the arrangements...not to mention we will get lonely from time to time and would be delighted to see any of you show up on our Chinese doorstep. Just make sure to take off your shoes, would ya!?

          Most people know by now that Nate and I spent 10 days in the southwest corner of the USA before flying across the Pacific. Here are some highlights of each of the cities we contributed our hard-earned dollars toward:           Phoenix, Arizona:      ~ Stayed for free with my best high school buddy, Chil...also our best man in our wedding. Chil lives in a developing suburb called Chandler.      ~ Experienced first-hand what 118 degrees of dry heat feels like     ~ Wrote out Thank-You postcards      ~ Walked around ASU area in Tempe, Arizona     ~ Relaxed by swimming in Chil's nearby neighborhood pool     ~ Drove up to Sedona and got a psychic reading done!     ~ Hit some happy hours and local bars with many of Chil's friends     ~ Walked around Downtown Phoenix and went to a free outdoor art gallery     ~ Slept...recovered from a month of moving/painting/wedding planning/China planning           Los Angeles, California:      ~ Stayed in Hollywood at a decent, but not extravagant Hotel...had a nice view of the Hollywood sign.     ~ Rode LA's train system everywhere     ~ Had lunch in Chinatown     ~ Wandered around Koreatown     ~ Checked out Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills, where cheap probably means $100 for a pair of sandals...if they even sell sandals there!     ~ Got a wheatgrass shot at the Jamba Juice off Rodeo Drive and realized that it's more expensive to get a wheatgrass shot in Minneapolis than in Beverly Hills! What's up with that?     ~ Took our shoes off at the Santa Monica Pier and let the tide roll in over our feet.     ~ Had dinner at "Real Food Daily" in Santa Monica and discovered my new favorite Vegan restaurant!     ~ Drove through some "tough" neighborhoods that were touched by the LA Riots, and are still touched by racism, poverty and hopelessness today.     ~ Went to the Chinese Mann Theater where the Walk of Fame is.          From Los Angeles, we boarded Korean Air and spent the next 12 hours of our life at 37,000 feet above the ocean so we could begin our journey in Asia. Nearly everyone on the airplane was a Korean-speaking person, so I confused the hell out of the flight attendants when I couldn't answer their questions in Korean. We had a 13 hour layover in Inchon's International Airport in Korea. Neither one of us slept much and sat awake between the hours of midnight and 5:00 AM in an eerily quiet airport...with the only sound being the custodial crew and the high-tech plasma televisions featuring Korean Olympians in various events. Finally, around 8:50 AM we boarded our airplane for another 3-4 hour flight to get to Hong Kong. Whew! What a journey! Hey, did I mention we haven't even seen most of our wedding pictures yet?
