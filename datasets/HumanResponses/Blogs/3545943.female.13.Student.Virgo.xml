      Do the ends justify the means?  What is Utopia?  What truths will hold true forever?  Which ones will die?  Why do fools fall in love?  Is love real?  Is death beautiful?  What does the future have in store?  Is secrecy cruel?  Is cruelty evil?  Is evil bad?  Now the time is ripe for a bit of Shakespeare:  To be, or not to be: that is the question: Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune, Or to take arms against a sea of troubles, And by opposing end them. To die: to sleep; No more; and by a sleep to say we end The heart-ache, and the thousand natural shocks That flesh is heir to, 'tis a consummation Devoutly to be wish'd. To die, to sleep; To sleep: perchance to dream: aye, there's the rub; For in that sleep of death what dreams may come, When we have shuffled off this mortal coil, Must give us pause: there's the respect That makes calamity of so long life; For who would bear the whips and scorns of time, The oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely, The pangs of despised love, the law's delay, The insolence of office, and the spurns That patient merit of the unworthy takes, When he himself might his quietus make With a bare bodkin? who would fardels bear, To grunt and sweat under a weary life, But that the dread of something after death, The undiscover'd country from whose bourn No traveler returns, puzzles the will, And makes us rather bear those ills we have Than fly to others that we know not of? Thus conscience does make cowards of us all, And thus the native hue of resolution Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought, And enterprises of great pitch and moment With this regard their currents turn awry And lose the name of action.  I dearly love that passage.

      Oh, my poor darling VW, whom I have sorely neglected, here is your ode.  Now, though I'm rather sure you weren't actually angry, if you were, hopefully here is compensation.  In fact, a song.  But there's only the lyrics.  Which is okay, seeing as I didn't bother actually thinking up a tune.  But you don't need to know that.  So here we go:  Oh, sometimes she's rather crazy. And sometimes she's rather glum. But I can say for certain That she's not very dumb. For VW, though she's crazy, Is wise beyond her years. She'll share with you the good times But also calm your fears. So bow to her!  I dare you to! You will not regret, For VW, she's an awesome dude, One you won't forget.  Ahh, dripping with cheezy goodness.  And by the way, VW must be pronounced Vuh-Wuh for the meter to work out correctly.  I s'pose now Elm will desire a song, eh?

      First off, sorry Elm, I didn't see that you had already explained the whole Ralph Nader thing.  I didn't even see Siri's comment on VW's blog.  I was just replying to Siri's comment on your entry "Rather Bored."  Speaking of which, Ralph Nader is a rather obstinate old bat, isn't he?  Oh, I want to see "Farenheit 9/11" really horribly badly.  But it's rated R.  So I won't be seeing it any time soon.  Crap.  But anyway, back to the subject at hand, the Divorce of Responsibility.  Or rather, a tiny fraction of it.  Depression.  Can I argue that the only people who enjoy life are those who are completely ignorant of what goes on around them?  I could, but I will not.  But I do see that it is something of a bell curve, and that there is no point beyond ignorance in which you could be totally without depression.  Cogito Ergo Doleo.  But I'm tired of America's view on depression.  You're sad, have some pills.  The expanding range of mood-altering drugs is insane.  By offering drugs so easily, this takes control out of the realm of the person's own control and places it solely in the realm of mental illness.  There's nothing wrong with most of the "depressed."  America is catering to the wills of its consumers to make more money.  People don't want to be sad, so there's drugs to stop it.  There's a drug for everything now.  America's consumption-based attitude is bringing it down.  All day, America is shouting "Consume, consume, consume!"  Feel bad?  Take a pill.  Can't "go all night," take a pill.  Eat to much, yeah, we'll cure that too.  How?  You guessed it, more consumption.  Drugs everywhere.  Along with ignorance comes more ignorance, such as the Twinkie Defense.  I'll probably butcher this story, but roughly and shortened, there was a man convicted of murder.  His psychiatrist testified that he killed because he was depressed, and when he was depressed he coped with his depression by consuming a lot of junk food, and being an ex-athlete, he knew it was bad for him, which made him more depressed.  Hence the Twinkie Defence.  God, I hate America.

      I'm sick and tired of life revolving around my sister.  I'd clarify, but...I don't feel like it.  Current: Knitting project:  Right front of the cardigan, just finished the pocket. Reading material:  Nothing new. Greatest desire that cannot be fufilled:  Parents that I could talk to. Greatest frustration:  Me Inspiration:  Pain Plans for the future:  If I planned it out now, what would I do later? Focus in life:  Understanding Attitude toward the whole of human kind:  Pity Completely illogical desire:   For the world to lie to me To tell me I'm good For something. Wrap me in falsehoods So I can pretend For a moment Until I realise There's no ground beneath my feet. Thing that I wish I could sit down and do but feel incapable of doing:  dying, painlessly Physical condition:  Good enough Mental condition:  Near the breaking point Emotional condition:  Rotten

      Again, Elm helped me understand.  I think this holds true for her, too:  I tend to think of myself as entirely separate from most of the world.  Maybe a little more mature, a little beyond the giggling bikini-wearing teenage girls that make me so disgusted with society.  I have low self-esteem and high expectations for myself.  I'm hard on myself.  I can't figure out what I want to do with my life, even a vague idea.  I keep putting off the things that I do want to do, like my novel.  I have a feeling it will never be complete.  I just drag through my days, they all blend together, each seems just like the last.  I don't  do  anything.  Nothing that matters.  And then I hate myself.  But then I realised, I'm only thirteen.  Assuming I don't die a premature death, I have most of my life ahead of me.  I don't  need  to know what I'm going to do with my life, as long as I have that initial desire to do something worthwhile.  My sister is going to be a senior in college, and she doesn't know what she's going to do.  My other sister is going into college with no idea as to what her major will be.  I've got time.  I think I need to relax a little, be a little less uptight.  Allow myself to make mistakes, knowing I can learn from them.  What good will it do me to wallow in my depression?  I'm not saying I can just put everything off until my last year of college, but I have plenty of time ahead of me to learn and grow as a person.  To explore new possibilities and figure out what it's all about.  It's okay for progress to be slow, if it is careful and strong.  I think I'm going to go work on my novel now.

      I was reading  urlLink Elm's  blog, and, well, Elm is always a source of inspiration and thoughtfulness to me.  People are generally bad at telling how someone feels.  It's so easy to fool the world, mostly because the world is willing to be fooled.  Everyone seems to want their own rose-coloured glasses.  Why are there so few people that look out beyond their own meager lives and realise the truth?    I figure if a random stranger such as  urlLink "The Reactor"  (That is, assuming it  is  some random stranger) can steal the "currents" from her blog, I can too.  I steal a lot from Elm.  Current: Knitting project: still the cardigan Reading material:  The Lord of the Rings  (again) and  A People's History of the United States  by Howard Zinn Greatest desire that cannot be fufilled:  To escape and live on my own Greatest frustration:  People that can't see beyond the walls of their own lives Inspiration:  People like Elm and  urlLink VW , people that can put a ton of emotion into writing or art Plans for the future:  If you mean besides camp next week, a family reunion a couple weeks after that, and school in the fall, I got nothing. Focus in life: Ha. Attitude toward the whole of humankind: disgust Completely illogical desire:  pain Thing that I wish I could sit down and do but feel incapable of doing: working on my novel, drawing (I'm a little intimidated to go back after a four month break from the last thing in my sketchbook), cleaning my room (Okay, I wouldn't be sitting.  But that's beside the point.) Physical condition: on the poor side of fair Mental condition: good Emotional condition: Is it necessarily good to be happy?

      WHY does everyone call when I'm home alone?  That being said, we got a new car!  A 2004 Toyota Corolla.  It's gray. And it has funky wheels and a spoiler.  It rocks.  Not that we could normally afford a car that new, but it was a really insanely good deal.  There was another car, a 2004 Hyundai Elantra (what we had before, only uglier) that was even cheaper, but it was...not so cool.  And my dad liked this one better.  And we bought it.  There's a new car in our garage.  And I think that's cool.  I think this is the first time we've bought a new car.  No, the van was new.  But it was older.  And it's a van.  I mean, come on.  Anyway.

      Prepare for several unrelated paragraphs, none of which make sense.  And none of which are indented.  Why?  No reason.  Just because.  Oh, story, thou art so patient with me.  Thou art vivid and true.  If only I might take the time to write you!  I keep writing down little bits of my story, but much more of it waits in my head.  I don't like the word "story."  Thesaurus.com will help me think of a better word.  Okay, thesaurus.com isn't very helpful.  I'll just call it my novel.  Anyway, I fear that I shall spend much time only to find it is stupid and long.  But I assume it will be.  But it must be written, if nothing else, just to be written.  It awaits writing.  It nags me!  Gah!  Oh, I  do  think I've cracked.  I'm going to camp on July 4th.  Camp Wapsie.  The camp everyone goes to.  And I fear it, for its popularity.  But I will be away from home for a week, an idea which suits me nicely.  And I know of no one from my school but Abbu that is going that week, so that is comforting.  And I had signed up for the horseback riding lessons, but they were full, but Abbu got in, so she said she was going to drop out, but then they called me and had an opening, so I got in, and Abbu didn't drop, so all is awesome.  I think I'll have fun.  I know I'll have fun.  As long as I don't have to spend too much time with snobbish teenage girls.  Can't think.  I had one or two other things I was going to write about...if I think of them I'll post them.

      &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp I've decided that I like running.  Not for long periods of time, nor particularly quickly.  And I don't like jogging.  Not at all.  What I like is the simple act of running.  I thinkk it's a psychological thing.  It's so ancient, so plain, so natural.  No need to think.  Just run.  And it represents getting away.  My true desire.  Freedom.  But am I running away from here, or am I running to a better place?  I think both.  I'm running away to.  To quote  From the Mixed-up Files of Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler : &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp "'Of all the sissy ways to run away and of all the sissy places to run away to...' Jamie mumbled. &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp "He didn't mumble quite softly enough.  Claudia turned on him. 'Run  away to?  How can you run  away  and  to?   What kind of language is that?' Claudia asked."  &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Oh, Claudia, you and your grammar.  Sometimes you must abandon what is seemingly correct for what holds the most meaning.

      &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp I'm kind of into dream interpretation right now.  Not like "if you see a tree you'll have a long life."  But when I think about my dreams, I can usually dissect them into portions, and I understand where each part came from, like if I was thinking about my friends they might appear in my dream, et cetera.  And dreams usually have an underlying feeling.  Like fear.  Nightmares usually have an underlying base in fear.  When I was younger, I used to have nightmares about being chased by a monster or a cloaked figure.  My fear was death.  It was something I (obviously) hadn't experienced.  But now I don't fear death.  In fact, the idea appeals to me sometimes.  And I don't have those dreams anymore.  I also often had a re-occuring dream in which I was with my family and there were small monsters running around.  They scared me, and I tried to escape but my family just laughed.  But in that dream, death wasn't my fear.  It was me being upset that my family wouldn't take me seriously.  So if you want to test my dream-interperating abilites, maybe you've got a story to tell me. &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp I haven't had a nightmare in ages.  Does that mean I'm fearless?  Not on a small scale, no.  But on a larger plane, perhaps.

      &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Today I went to the beach with Kate.  I mean Elm.  Yeah that's it.  I went to the beach with Elm.  Palo beach.  Cuz the ocean don't go to Ioway.  So we saw the traditional beach-goer girls with their string bikinis, and they made me laugh.  Because they are very crazy.  And they make sand boobs.  And Ignorance's head is fuzzy.  It was a happy time.  Is sand bad for your digestive tract?

      &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspI've been having trouble getting to sleep at night lately.  I think there's always just too much on my mind.  But I wrote this song at about three in the morning.  Did I scare you off darlin'? Was I just to far from what you expected? Is that why you left me, is that why you're gone? Or were you just too blind to understand?  Chorus: I'm waiting for you, all dressed in black. You left me stranded, said you wanted something better. And now you've seen the world and you're turning back. Didn't I warn you? Didn't I tell you? Didn't I show you the way?  Don't think for a moment that I'm grieving 'cuz I lost you. I'm grieving because you lost yourself. You took me for a fool, but now you've seen the light. But maybe now I'm gone for good.  Chorus  I don't know what to do about you. I'm not quite sure how much you changed. When you come back to me, how should I react? Welcome you or push you away?  Chorus  I'm waiting for you, all dressed in black.

      &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp There are still some kind people in this world.  Last night, we went to Joensy's because my mom and dad wanted tenderloins.  It's way out in Center Point.  As we reached the "One mile to Center Point" sign, the car began to slow.  My dad pulled onto the shoulder of the highway and the car continued to slow.  Finally, it came to a halt.  My dad got out of the car and checked the engine.  He tried to restart it several times, but we got nothing.  We got out to walk.  We had walked only ten feet when a car pulled over in front of us.  A man with rugged features and bristly stubble all over his chin got out of his truck and walked towards us.  His face was dirt-smudged but kindly.  He offered us the use of his cell phone and gave us a ride to Joensy's.  (And my mom said not to get into a car with a stranger!)  He told us that they had had a car that broke down once, and they took it in to fix, but it kept breaking down every so often for about six months, until they gave in and got rid of it.  He was awfully chatty.  He told us all about his wife and kids.  So here was this man we had never met before who stopped to help, just because we knew what we were going through.  That's kindness.   &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp We ate our supper and called a friend of ours to come rescue us.  My dad waited for the tow truck, which would only tow the car five miles before charging, so they went to the auto repair shop near Center Point.  My mom and my sister went to fetch my dad.  Now the car is dead.  Our good ol' Hyundai that served us so well.  But that's what happens when you buy a used car, I guess.  Poor thing.

      &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Usually when I think of a word or phrase, I can write a poem or song, albeit a bad one, almost instantly.  Insperation hits, boom, finished product.  Well, not finished.  But a draft.  Or draught, as they say in that funny ol' land I love so dearly.  So if I randomly use British spellings, don't hit me, people.  I just love them.  But I digress.  So for quite a while now, about a month, I think, the word 'escape' has been prodding me.  I want to write a song with the title Escape.  I know what kind of voice I want to sing it and I know basically what I want it to be.  But I cannot write it.  It won't be written.  Not yet.

      &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp For a brief moment, anarchy sounds good.  But it doesn't take long to realise what total chaos we would be thrown into.  Government is an ancient idea, and all in all a good one.  But then when you look at it, most of our governing leaders are bad.  Then there's the question of whether or not they are really bad or if it is just our perception.  Does an effective leader remain in the public's favor no matter what, or does s/he do what is the best choice for the public, even if it means falling out of favor?  It seems as if the choice of one who is pure in heart would be the latter, but if you are in the public's disfavor, they will do what they can to stop you.  By choosing the "right thing," you may inspire a revolt, throwing the country into political turmoil.  And then have you done what's best?  A people is only at peace if it believes its leader is doing a good job, so if you go against public opinion, might you be taking away the peace? &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp It seems as if our problem is based in that the only people that would run for government office are those not intelligent enough to realise how difficult it would be to make such decisions.  Only those that don't think through all the options are willing to make such decisions.  And then there's people like Bush, who neither make good choices nor remain in the public's favor.  Or does he?

      &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspI love swimming.  I love submerging myself under water and listening to the silence, propelling myself along.  I love somersaulting, twisting, turning, just enjoying the mobility and near weightlessness of it all.  I love swimming alone.  When you have the whole dang pool to yourself.  That’s the best. &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspSo why don’t I swim very often?  It’s because of that blasted Bever pool.  A few years ago, my sister would take me to the nearly-deserted pool and we’d swim for a while.  I loved that.  And then they remodeled it.  Now it’s a wade-in pool with fountains and waterslides, and all the people in their tiny bikinis go there and tan in the two-inch-deep water at the shallow end.  Caged in.  What happened to the little, dirty, cracked-bottomed, pool I loved so?  Now it’s a popular place.  And I hate it.  Sure, I might go there once, maybe twice a year, but I never really enjoy it.  This is where “improvement” leads us.  It drives away what was there before.

      You're trapped in a well with a goat and a slinky.  Describe how you will escape.  &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspFirst I'd cuddle the goat.  I love goats.  They're so ornery, yet lovable.  Then, I convince the goat to let me shave its fur/hair/whatever because it's so dang hot in the bottoms of wells.  Then we splash around for a bit.  Then, assuming the slinky was an old-school metal one and not a crappy plastic one, I'd bend it into a drop-spindle and a pair of knitting needles.  Then I'd make nice mohair yarn and make a sweater.  Oh, wait, I was supposed to escape?

When it hurts too much to fake it, Don't just keep staring. Turn your back. Swallow your pride and turn your back Walk the other way. And when they start to talk about you, Let it go forever. Turn your back, Turn your back, Turn your back.

      &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspFirst off,  why  must it be so dang difficult to indent paragraphs in an html document?  If anyone knows of an easier way to do it than to use five non-breaking space tags in a row or use a blank space image,  please  let me know!  Maybe I could find some way to work out a definition list-type-thing, but it would probably end up being even more complicated.  Gah! &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThat being said, I think I'll just get all chatty for a while.  I don't really have anyone around to talk to right now, and even if I did, I don't figure I'd have much to say.  Besides, there's something comforting about the gentle clickity-clack of the keyboard.  And I don't like actually talking.  It tends to annoy me.  And I type faster then I write.  Which is perhaps why I'm quickly getting addicted to blogging.  Even though I could be doing more productive things than writing a whole bunch of nonsense for friends and random people to read.  Like working on my story.  But hey.  I know the basic plot and a bunch of minor details, but I tend to get intimidated when it comes time to actually do some writing.

      What is sorrow's hue? Is it a somber shade of grey? A dreary color caught halfway  Between the worlds of black and white? Is it the deep and lonely blue Of the silent, tranquil sea? Is it the rich crimson Of blood spilt without reason? Is it subdued and pastel Or bold and strong? Is it the cloudy mist Of a single tear? If only I might know I would paint my soul.  This reminds me, check out  urlLink "A Dream Deferred"  by Langston Hughes.

      Tied up in knots. Twisted and stretched, pulled in all directions. A thousand voices scream my name. My mind is jumbled, no thoughts coherent. Pain. Wish it away or revel in it? Can't stop the motion of the world. Can't change a thing. Remaining forever, Tied up in knots.

      &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspTrust is a funny thing.  So difficult to build up, so easily shattered.  And then you start to wonder if you've only built up trust because you haven't been observant enough to notice what would kill it.  But can you ever fully trust anyone but yourself?  What is trust?  Truth is a big part of it.  Does trust mean telling each other the truth, no matter what?  But brilliant minds such as Machiavelli contend that it is not always necessary, nor even good to be truthful.  If you lie to protect someone, may that shatter trust?  And what of love?  What brings you to care so much about someone that the love remains even through broken trust?  Looking at Machiavelli again, he insists that the ends justify the means.  But it takes more force to begin a motion than to continue it.  Love too can be shattered easily.  But then, what is love?  And in love, what is peace?  There is no black and white.  Only darker and lighter shades of grey.  There is no good, no evil.  It's all in the eye of the beholder.  It's a huge mishmash of grey.  The world is not our perfectly balanced black/white, male/female, yin/yang that we believe it to be, or wish it were.  But I digress; is trust a good thing?  Is it necessary?  Perhaps we ought to all live for ourselves solely, but then to quote Thomas Hobbes, "No arts; no letters; no society; and which is worst of all, continual fear, and danger of violent death: and the life of man, solitary, poor, nasty, brutish and short."  Ah, perhaps we are all the cruel joke of some creator.

      When evening passes and morning crawls in without sleep, queer thoughts come to mind.  This may very well be the strangest thing I've written.  Every Saturday at four Death comes knocking at my door. I then invite him in for tea And tell him of my misery. I'm glad to see him here again Though others would not let him in. If only he would always stay; I miss him much when he's away. When five o'clock comes rushing in He must go away again. "Do take me along!" I moan. But always does he leave alone. I ask him why I cannot go, Escape at last this wretched woe. But smiles, he does, and says to me That Life would miss my company. I scold him well for teasing so. It is not true, I surely know. For I am minor, nothing true. A better's loss, perhaps she'd rue. I tell him he's a wicked foe To not take those who want to go. For they can only sit and wait For Death will come, though far too late. Instead he always compensates With other deaths and crueller fates, Taking those whou wish that they Could maybe live another day. Stealing those who might be missed, Those whose lips have not been kissed, Those who matter rather more With something still worth living for. But Death says he must go away He shall be late if he delays. I bid him gone, go where he may For he'll be back next Saturday. But I see something in his eye: A tear rests there, waiting to cry. I kiss his weary, tender cheek And he goes until next week. I know now why Death waits for me. He won't let go, he cares deeply. I'm different: I don't fear his song Most mourn his arrival; I mourn him gone.  As I said, rather strange.

      My "novel" is a fantasy piece, that being my perferred genre.  I'm not totally sure where it's going yet, to be truthful.  The plot is vague.  Ha, plot.  Like it will have one.  But anyway, it's pretty traditional, Renaissance-era-esque, long journeys, magic, and battling evil.  But that's such a broad outline that you could describe a horribly predictable or amazingly brilliant story that way.  I think my ideas are halfway decent, it's just the question of whether or not it gets screwed up on the way to the paper.

      Alrighty Elm, here's your happy song.  ELM! Though that's not exactly her name, It kinda is. It kinda is. And that's why we call her Elm.  DEMOCRAT! Though she's not registered to vote yet, That's what she'd be. That's what she'd be. Or maybe an independant.  DANG! That girl's pretty sweet and it's quite the treat To know her. To know her. She's a spiffy sort.  CANADIA! Doesn't have much to do with her But she loves it so. Oh oh oh She loves it so. Hey yeah woo woo! She loves it so.  She's got brains in her head Which work fairly well. Though due to a rare birth defect she has only two legs.  ELM! She's pretty insane But we loves her. We loves her. We done loves her good.  Yeah, the Canadia part begins the bridge, which ends with the line about her missing legs.  I just love how no one will understand the least of this save her and VW.  For the rest of you, just bear in mind that some of this is inside jokes, but most of it is random insanity.

      I am weary.  The long, languid days of August have coated me thickly, nearly smothering me with their weight. And now I trudge along under this burden of days, dripping with honeyed illusions. The last days of summer roll out from beneath me and tumble along like water o'er a mill. Some days pass swiftly and vigourously, laden with youthful virility and impulsion. Others slow to nearly a standstill, with naught but necessity keeping them from a halt.  Now autumn is at bay, and before or after we are ready, but always when we are not prepared, the chill winds signifying the passing of the seasons slip through the web of summer. The leaves shall die away in their glorious coats of red and gold, and our minds will turn to harvests and cider. But ere long, in our minds, the chill turns to cold and we grow tired of autumn. And then, then! we will look back on these summer days with regret and desire. For we are simple minded, and little remains in our high esteem for long.  We cannot and would not keep the wheel of change from turning. We cannot force it to spin faster, though we always try. We are caught in an endless and eternal cycle of death and re-birth, of the passing of the seasons, of change.

      I had forgotten how anal I get about school supplies. Last night I was doing my labling and packing so as to be done and not have to worry later.  But despite my nonchalant attitude about organization at home, my school supplies must be perfect.  There is a place for everything and everything in its place.  I have everything I need on hand, as well as back-up supplies.  Why do I get this way?  I think it's my distinction between home and school.  They are separate things, and I have different attitudes in each.  School is work, work must be organised.  I feel that in the future, the same distinction will be made between work and home.  I do not necessarily need or even want them to effect each other.  They can be two separate entities for me.

      I think it's in my nature to steal from  urlLink Elm. I can't help it. But I stole this from her (who I thought stole it from Rachel Carlson) before, and I'm stealing again my "Life's Questions and Answers" from sixth grade and now.   For a person you loved deeply, would you be willing to move to a distant country, knowing there would be little chance of seeing your friends or family again?   Hopefully, this guy would be my friend, and since it says I would have little chance of seeing my friends again, I wouldn't see him anyway. So no.  I don't know if I believe in love. If it's as perfect as I hope it would be, then yes. He would be my friend and family, first, though.   If you were to die tonight with no opportunity to communicate with anyone, what would you most regret not having told someone? Why haven't you told them yet?   I would tell them things I'm not about to post on the internet, and I haven't told them because I don't want them to know while I'm still alive.  Of course I'm not going to say here. I haven't told them because I don't want them to be angry.   If you could spend one year in perfect happiness but afterward remember nothing of the experience, would you do so?   Hell yeah.  I cannot imagine perfect happiness. I do not believe it is possible.   If you were able to live to the age of 90 and retain either the body or the mind of a 30-year-old for the last 60 years of your life, which would you want?   I'd say body, cuz my mind would only get better as I lived through more years of experience. Would you really want to stop learning at 30?  Neither. Let me age with grace. Let me become forgetful and wrinkled. I would rather deteriorate than suddenly drop away while still in good condition.   What would constitute a "perfect" evening for you?   Heh heh heh.  Golly. I worry what I meant by that. Um...drop me in the middle of the woods, alone, with a bowl of ice cream.  Would you rather be extremely successful professionally and have a tolerable yet unexciting private life, or have an extremely happy private life and only a tolerable and uninspiring professional life?  A happy private life, definitely. If my job is tolerable, that's good enough for me. I only work for money for my private life, anyway.  Private life. I don't have rich fantasies about having a job I love. Maybe I'm just pessimistic. But I'd rather have something to go home to than not want to go home.   Would you be willing to become extremely ugly if it meant you would live for 1,000 years at any physical age you chose?   Not a chance. 1,000 is way too long. I'd forget to embrace the moment, and I'd turn lazy.  I love Elm's answer. Go read hers.   If you could wake up tomorrow with any new ability or quality, what would it be?   Ummm...flight, maybe?  Oh, I don't know. Somehow, having an ability quite suddenly doesn't seem very appealing. I'd like to work for it. But I'd still like flight.   You have the chance to meet someone with whom you can have the most satisfying love imaginable. Sadly, you know that in six months, the person will die. Knowing the pain that would follow, would you still want to meet the persona and fall in love?   Of course I would!  Satisfying? I don't much need to be satisfied. I'm never satisfied. I wouldn't like to fall in love just to lose him. Satisfaction is not high on my theoretical list of priorities.   Do you prefer being around men or women? Do your closest friends tend to be men or women?   My closest friends are female, but I think that's mainly cuz mens' minds work in different ways, and I find it hard to communicate with them. Don't get me wrong, though, I have nothing against guys.  I don't really have much in the way of male friends. I just don't really like any of them that I know. Maybe they'll grow out of their immaturity?   Have you ever hated anyone? If so, why and for how long?   I have never really hated anyone, and I don't believe that you can say how long you hated someone, because I think that hate is something that lasts forever, otherwise it's only intense dislike. I have intensely disliked several people."--Alexa Neelie Zarshall Frommassachusetts (If you don't know who that is, SHAME ON YOU!!!) Her words are true, though. I agree completely.  I don't know if I still think hatred lasts forever. I wish there were two words for hatred, one for hate in the way that I both love and hate people, and one for pure intense hatred, or as I define it, a complete and thorough lack of love. Because in everyone there is something I absolutely can't stand about them, and I would go as far as to say that I hated it, except that I don't want that to be confused with the other type. I used to think of hatred as being willing to give your life to take their freedom. But that's not quite true. For example, I would give my life to take various terrorists' freedom, but I do not hate them. Because this kind of hatred is a void, a black hole, if you will. I do not hate them because I understand them, and part of me pities them. I do not hate anyone in this way.   If you knew there would be a nuclear war in one week, what would you do?   Have a hell of a good time.  I wish I could say I would try to stop it, since I have nothing to lose, but I'm not that altruistic. I think that truthfully, I would either join the masses in their hopeless franticism (word?) trying to fufill their every desire and then commit suicide the day prior to, or keep a level head and try to seek shelter deep underground, and see if I could survive.   If you knew you could devote yourself to any single occupation--music, writing, acting, business, politics, medicine, etc.--and be among the best and most successful in the world at it, what would you choose? If you knew you had only a 10 percent chance of being so successful, would you still put in the effort?  I  don't know...I can't see me sticking with one job for very long...I'd get bored to death...maybe something equestrian...I'd love to ride hunter/jumper...Giving your best effort is not just to become successful. I would surely give it my all.  I cannot say. I have absolutely no idea of what I would like to do with my life. I feel like I am not good enough at anything to base my life upon it. But if I found something I wanted that badly to do, I would put forth all of the effort I had.   Your house, containing everything you own, catches fire. After saving your loved ones and pets, you have time to safely make a final dash to save any one item. What would it be?   My books...or maybe my CD's and CD player...my computer, my sketchpad, my drawing pencils, everything!!! *sob*  I'm not very fond of material items. There isn't much I couldn't live without. But I'd probably head towards my books.   When did you last sing to yourself? To someone else?   I'm singing to myself now, and I sing to other people all the time, but they rarely listen.  Oh, I'm usually singing to myself. I don't really sing to other people...I kind of sing at them, though. They don't realise I'm doing it.   If you could choose the manner of your death, what would it be?   Anyone who does not know that I want to die of spontaneous human combustion is a complete idiot.  Yeah, I'd still go for spontaneous human combustion. Or suicide. I don't think I really believe in anything strongly enough to die for it.   Do you have any specific long-term goals? What is one, and how do you plan to reach it?   I tend to set my goals small and achievable. Right now, I really want to take riding lessons. (On horses, silly) Definately hunter/jumper and probably dressage...and I also would like to have something I wrote published. How cool would that be?  Perhaps this is kind of lame, but I feel very excited that I actually reached the goal I set for myself in sixth grade. Though I can only ride when I can scrounge up twenty bucks from my non-existant income, at least I get to. And I'm going to do a combined test at a show in September. (That's dressage and some jumping, just short crossrails.) I guess I don't really have any long term goals. I'm kind of wishy-washy. I'd still love to be a published author. It seems like that would finally give me a sense of accomplishment. But that's not very likely to happen.   For what in your life do you feel most grateful?   My friends.  My friends, still, for they help me figure out who I am.   If you could have free, unlimited service for five years from an extremely good cook, chauffeur, housekeeper, masseuse, or personal secretary, which would you choose?   I don't need a cook, cuz I hate eating. A chauffeur would be useless because I can get my drivers permit in just over a year. I don't need a house keeper cuz it would be a waste of time for both of us. And what would I need with a personal secretary? I'm 12, for heaven's sake. Masseusse would be good. Very good.  Cook? Naw, I still don't like eating. Not to say I won't. Because I do eat. I just don't need someone to cook for me. Chauffer? Not once I can drive. Housekeeper? No, I can do my own cleaning, thanks. Masseuse? Mmmm...massage...but I don't want some random person on call to rub my muscles... Personal secretary? No, I handle my own stuff. I guess I'd rather be self supported. I don't want any of these things.   Would you enjoy spending a month of solitude in a beautiful natural setting? Food and shelter would be provided, but you wouldn't see another person.   OH YEAH!!!! Talk about heaven on earth!  This sounds like paradise. I don't think I'd miss people, even. I'm too fond of solitude.   Would you like to be famous? In what way?   Maybe, for writing a truly awesome book, or doing something great with horses.  I guess I'd like to be known, but not famous, if that makes any sense.   Which of the following restrictions could you best tolerate: leaving the country permanently, or never leaving the state in which you now live?   I wouldn't mind leaving the country...I've always wanted to live in Great Britain. Staying here forever would be awful, tho.  I would rather leave the country permanently. That actually doesn't sound bad.   Is there anything you've dreamed of doing for a long time? Why haven't you done it?   Riding lessons. I think I've made it clear that I can't afford them...feel free to donate. ;)  Can't think.   What are your most compulsive habits?   Don't get me started...  I turn of the lights every time I leave my room, I always flush the toilet, oh, wait, that's not quite what they meant, is it? Checking my e-mail, I think. And using metaphors instead of saying things straight out. Using semicolons.   What do you most strive for in your life: accomplishment, security, power, love, excitement, knowledge, or something else?   Accomplishing secure, powerful, loving, exciting, knowledgable something.  What do I strive for? Perfection.   You are invited to a party that will be attended to many fascinating people you've never met. Would you want to go if you had to go by yourself?   Sure would, and I'd have a whoppin' good time.  Yes. I'm not fond of parties, but I would still go. I'd be more inclined to go alone than with another.   Since adolescence, in what three-year period do you feel you experienced the most personal growth and change?   The last three years.  I think the last year has had more change in it than any other three-year span combined.   If you were happily married and then met someone you felt certain to bring you passionate, intoxicating love, would you leave you spouse? What if you had kids?   I would never leave my spouse. Fidelity (sp?) is very important to me.  I do not desire passion or intoxication. I would not leave a spouse I loved. I would not trade security, love, and thoughtful conversation for passion.   Who is the most important person in your life?   Can't pick just one.  I'm not inclined to say.   Do you support capital punishment?   YEAH BABY!!!!!!!!!!! wh00t!!!  Ahh, keep in mind I was joking. I do not. Death is kind.   If you could change anything about the way you were raised, what would it be?   I'd have my parents give me more freedom, and make them LISTEN and I'd want them to understand and not tease me.  I desire more freedom. I now know I don't need understanding from my parents; I can get it from others.   If 100 people your age were chosen at random, how many do you think you'd find leading a more satisfying life than yours?   I think it's impossible to rate how satisfying one's life is. What can you compare it to?  Satisfaction? It is what you make it to be.   Someone you love deeply is brutally murdered. You know the identity of the murderer, who is acquitted. Would you seek revenge?   Sure would. If I loved them, I would do anything to avenge their death. I would kill the murderer, and I wouldn't get caught. In every great detective's mind, there is another powerful side, a criminal side, that must be locked away. I would unlock this side.  I think I was on something when I wrote that. If I knew the murderer's identity for certain, s/he would not be acquitted. If there was a reasonable doubt in anyone's mind that it was not her/him, than that reasonable doubt would be in my mind, as well.   What do you value most in a relationship?   Understanding, trust, pure sweet love.  Love, understanding, and trust are still at the top of my list. I do not care if we disagree, as long as we can see each others' sides.   Do you judge others by higher or lower standards than you judge yourself?   Lower standards.  Lower standards, though the closer they are to me, the harder I judge them.   If there were a public execution on television, would you watch it?   No way...unless they were getting their head chopped off...:P  No.   What things are too personal to discuss with others?   Things that I won't list here.  I think if I found someone I could really talk to, and completely trust, there would be nothing. But generally, I hide quite a bit from people.   Would you be willing to do something very unsatisfying (e.g., clean toilets) for the next five years if you were certain that the experience would afterwards bring you a deep sense of personal fulfillment for the rest of you life?   Sure would.  Certainly. What I do matters little compared to what I think.   How many times during the day do you look at yourself in the mirror?   Never on purpose, unless I'm dressing up for something and have to fix my hair.  Before I leave the house, or on random occasions when I just stare and wonder.   Would you prefer to be blind or deaf?   Blind. My hearing is important to me, and I just don't care about sight.  Blind. I do care about sight. I love beauty. It's hard for me to say just why, really, but I'd rather be blind.   What does it take for you to trust people?   I fully trust only one, and I trust her because of many things I don't care to say here.  My trust in her is greater than most, but is not complete. I trust no one. I cannot.   Of all the people close to you, whose death would you find most disturbing?   One of my friends  One of my friends, I suppose.

      It's amazing how I can be gone for just a week, but it feels like forever.  It's amazing how everything seems to be so unchanged, how everything seems to pause an wait for you.  It's amazing how quickly everyone changes.  Or perhaps no one is changing but me?   I wish I could say what I want to say.  I wish.   I'm ready for summer to be over.  I want to go back to school.  Not because I like it, but because I need my routine back.  I need to see a lot of people every day.  I need to get out of the house.  Mostly I need to puncture my false hopes.  I need to realise that I'll never find what I'm looking for.  Elm, VW, we need to talk about the band.   If you don't want it anymore, perhaps it should be laid to rest.  But I don't see why we couldn't write serious songs as well as an occasional "Pink Bubblewrap" type thing for stress relief.  I hate vacation.  Sure, I enjoyed some things, like going on a trail ride through the mountains and holding my cousin's five-month-old son.  But all in all I'd rather stay home.  I had planned on writing a lot about vacation, but frankly, I don't feel like it.  Have you ever had a dream that's so strong and so meaningful that it weighs down your mind and your heart, haunting you constantly?

      This is an article from my other blog: Under the Ice at astuteobservation.blogspot.com that I thought was extremely relevant to this page.  Adults have a common problem of classifying young people as one mass, not normal people but sort of semi-human group with relatively consistent opinions and tastes. Think about it and you'll see what I mean. Signs of it are everywhere: Kid's meals, kid's Post, kid's shows. All this because of the mistaken belief that all kids like the same things. This amalgamation of America's youth is a symptom of a bigger problem, which I call the "Sub-Human Child Mentality." This, quite obviously, is the belief that, as a very wise man so cogently put it, "children are in training to be people." People with this mentality (most of the adult population) assume that children have not developed a full enough spectrum of emotions, thoughts and experiences to be treated as relevant members of society. I, as someone who has recently undergone the change from a childlike mind to a more adult one, can testify that this isn't true. As a child, one is more fresh, more alive, more human in many ways than an adult. A young person hasn't had as many bad experiences as an adult, so their minds aren't clogged with fear. This is why children's opinions should be respected. I'm not trying to pretend that young people can decide everything by themselves. It is incredibly important, especially in the early years, that an adult's experience by factored before a decision is made. In an ideal world, experienced adults would explain the guidelines and limitations they understand from a long life, then let children decide within those parameters what they believe. The Sub-Human Child Mentality has grave repercussions in a young person's life, the primary one being inability to express oneself. Because children are not viewed as people with valid opinions, they don't get chances to say what's on their minds when they're young, and grow up not knowing how to communicate. It's satisfying to avenge all the young people who were classified as "below normal intelligence" or "ADD" because their culture disrespected them and not because they were born with a sub-normal cranial capacity. There are two fronts that must be tackled in the destruction of the Sub-Human Child Mentality and it's replacement with a respect for the young. First, there are the adults who must be re-educated to understand the ideas stated above. Second are the children, who will need no more than freedom and encouragement to make their mark on the world.

      What's your favorite part of the newspaper?  For me it's the editorial.  If I could have only one page of the newspaper, I would take the editorial page.  Or maybe the front page.  Let's just say that I'd go for section A.  Frankly, there's a lot of dumb people out there.  Then they write their annoying pro-Bush articles.  Make sure you read today's editorial, Elm.  There's a horrible letter about how Kerry is evil, etc. that really got under my skin.  But there was also a letter of questions to ask yourself about the candidates that was clear-cut, concise, and wonderful.

      On the war in Iraq:  People tell me that the war in Iraq was necessary, that Saddam Hussein was a tyrant, and he was going to attack us with WMDs. After I finish laughing, I reply as follows:  "A) Although Saddam Hussein was a tyrant, he was killing fewer Iraqis than we have in our war. Isn't it also more important to focus on the welfare of our own country before we take into our own hands the welfare of another country? After our country is in working order (no multi-billion dollar defecit), then we can focus on other countries, some in far worse condition than Iraq. We can do this in peaceful ways, such as providing basic immunizations (the money spent in Iraq could have paid for basic immunizations for every child in the world for 42 years!).  B) Saddam had no weapons of mass destruction. And don't come back to me in a month or so telling me that I was wrong, because they 'found' WMDs, which they probably will. There have been numerous inside reports of WMDs being flown into the country, not to be dropped, but to be "found"."  Someone needs to teach "President" George W. Bush. I mean that in a literal, non-threatening way. Please don't arrest me I'm just a minor. (Damn Patriot Act)!

      Quite frankly, I do not belong here.  Yes, I am a youth of the nation.  No, I am not informed.  No, my intelligence is not greater than that of many adults.  Yes, I have thoughts and opinions that differ from most.  No, they are not beyond the intelligence of any.  I guess all I've got is an annoying habit of forcing in my two cents worth.  But maybe that's all I need?
