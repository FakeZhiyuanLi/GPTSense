      Every winter I pore over the seed catalogs, thinking of spring when I can sow the tiny specks into the freshly tilled soil.  I think of my greenhouse in the back, where I labor late at night, starting the seeds under artificial lights to give them a head start.....  OK, that is all bullshit.  Who really has the time?  But goddamnit, I like flowers.  So that's why I'm at the nursery, surfing for plant porn.  Whatever is gorgeous and flowering goes onto my little wagon.  Native to Hawaii, requires intensive humidity? Terrific.  The one where the buds must be trimmed every third day?  In it goes.  The beautiful ones that require daily sprayings and root baths?  Sure, why not?  Full sun, part sun, sandy soil, whatever, its all the same to me.  I buy it and put it in the ground.  Thus, I am responsible for the grisly death of a wide variety of flora.  I enjoy their flowering beauty and then rake the withered remains into the yard waste bin.  (I have also enjoyed the slow death of many an orchid indoors.  I have a friend who was convinced that I have nurtured one for a year when in reality it was an ever-changing cast.  I might as well keep goldfish).  I do read the directions.  First, I'm supposed to prepare the soil by turning it over with organic compost and fertilizers, then test the acidity with some kind of kit or something....I stop reading after that.  Honestly, do you take a hooker to dinner and a movie?  I just want to look at the blooms while they last.   And some flowers are just uppity.  Like dahlias.  They are gorgeous and they know it.  I have a friend who brings paint chips to flower shows to swap bulbs with other growers to get the exact shade of flower.   Following dahlia protocol, he actually digs UP the damn bulbs every fall, carefully packs them in newspaper in a cool dark basement where they slumber all winter, listening to Mozart or something.  (He's queerer than a posy of tulips, as if that wasn't clear).  Now I don't know about you, but I am not digging up something I planted anymore than I'm fishing one my daughter's dirty diapers out of the trash and putting it back on her clean tush.  Thus, plant porn at the nursery.  Instant gratification of the simplest sort.   I fondle the soft folds of lamb's ear, stroke the woody stalks of bamboo, and squeeze the bursting seed pods of impatiens before I leave with my prize:  a squeaky wagon overflowing with color, flowers of all shapes and sizes, never before grouped together due to the sheer impracticality, destined for certain death by the end of the month.  Bliss.

      Sunday I completed my 3rd triathlon.  I competed in the Danskin, a women's only tri.  This one was extra special as my mom extended a visit to see me race.  I have never been at a more pro-woman, incredible event in my life.  Last year was my first, and I was hooked.  The race is a 1/2 mile swim, a 12 mile bike ride, a 3.1 mile run.  But more than that, it is a chance for the women to shine.  Seattle's race is the largest event in the country.  The sheer hoopla - if I may be allowed such a word - is thrilling.  Also, to see the thousands of volunteers and supporters.  Boyfriends, husbands, kids, friends, parents all come out to cheer in a way I've never seen at any other sporting event.  No Nike sponsorships here - just lots of homemade signs for Mom or Grandma or Sue or whomever.  The oldest participants were 77 - one of those ladies never did ANYTHING athletic until last year, when she did her first tri at 76.  I was also running near some 12-year-old girls and not a few cancer survivors.  (The race raises money for breast cancer).   I'm not a naturally athletic person myself - but in this kind of company, how could I not be inspired?

      Greetings to the few loyal members of my writing group!  As promised, here is my new venue.  After much deliberation, I have decided on Spidersoup as my blog name.  I wish I could come up with a fantastic story behind it, but it is pretty mundane.  After finding out that my first ten or so carefully chosen names had already been snapped up by more creative and speedier individuals, frustration moved in and set up house.   Dejected and alone, I took to eating fudgsicles nonstop until I had enough sticks to built a small replica of the new Seattle library on my desk.  Inspiration came in the form of two small hungry children.   Occasionally, I make the rookie error of asking my two-year-old and four-year-old what they would like for dinner.  Their responses are astonishing in both their creativity and their lack of nutritive value.  I don't know why I'm expecting them to say "steamed vegetables" or "broiled chicken."  When I make the gentle suggestion of several plausible choices, their tiny faces crumple with despair.  I suppose this is like telling someone they've won a fantastic vacation anywhere they choose in the world, as long as its Sheboygan.  After several more minutes of whining, pleading, crying, etc., I simply announce, "Fine, I guess we'll just have spider soup."  After the look of horror passes, they quickly come around, assuring me that tofu and brown rice would be simply fantastic.  I guess that's about as good a portrait of my parenting as any, the fact that my kids actually believe I'd serve them such a dish.  OK, I am aware they are terrified of spiders and everytime I dispatch one in the bathroom or laundry room, I may remark that it would be a fine addition to my soup.  But hey, I'm not above using any tool at my disposal to get the job done. I'm not exactly coming from a position of strength, what with the fudgsicle stick structures and all.   Thus, spider soup.  But it does seem to sum up my blog creation experience...not my first choice, but hopefully this blog will become my fantastic creation I use to achieve my hidden agenda.
