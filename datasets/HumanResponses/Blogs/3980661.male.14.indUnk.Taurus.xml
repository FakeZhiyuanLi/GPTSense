         Martha Stewart should be let of the hook, the only reason she is in such deep shizzle is because she is a celebrity. Which is totally wrong, because your govermental status should not be judged on your social class. So what, she took a tip from her broker. If I got a tip that I was going to loose money, hell, I'd sell it in a heart beat. That is just sick that the US government would destroy a womans life for doing what anybody else would. Free martha!

      Very recently, my grandmother began to rave about how she hates imigrants coming into america, and how they shouldn't be allowed to live here. This angered me, especially since she brought up the worst cliche ever, They are taking our jobs. You are wrong. w-r-o-n-g. They aren't stealing or taking our jobs, they are getting their jobs. I'm tired of the people I live around talking about how their parents are unemployed because a mexican got their job. I see so many things wrong with that sentance. The mexican got the job because he is more qualified. If the parent really wanted that job, he should get off his butt and go get it. Apply yourself people. Now another thing, is that people complain about how the imigrants get payed minimum wage. Well, guys, that is giving them a favor, because if they weren't payed minimum wage then the whole reason that the company hired them is because it was cheap labor. So by paying them minimum wage, it is doing them a favor, by keeping them on the pay list.  &nbsp;   &nbsp; Who do you think is more happy? The woman getting payed for small tasks, or the man who doesn't get payed? Some people will say that he simply was cheated out of his job by an imigrant, geuss what, there is a reason he lost his job, the other person was more qualified. He could have been sleeping on the job, or drinkin on the job, which just goes to show you, that it is his own fault. Get a clue people, just because an imigrant kicked you out of your job doesn't mean it was his fault, it means that it is your fault. Here is my&nbsp;4 step solution. 1.buy / rent a nice suit 2. buy new shoes 3. Go get a new job 4. work hard and get payed. Hey, steps one and two don't even need to be compleated, it just helps to add to the quality of job you get. Hell, I could get a suit, and go to a hotel offer $2 a bag, and carry them to people's rooms. How much would I mke in a day? $50? $60? That is enough to live off of. To be fancy, I will do the math. Say it is $15 to eat every day. Now subtract that from $50. You have $35. Now multiply that by 5. $175 a week. (you could also work weekends). Now if there are 52 weeks in a year. That means that I could be making $7020 a year. Whic is far more than any 14 year old should be making. So lets take it a step further. If I worked at McDonalds for $5 an hour. Say I worked 40 hours a week. that is $200. Plus you can eat some of the food, so I will take it down to $8 for food. that means I make $160 a week. x 52 = 8230. Which I could make in highschool alone. Now that means I could buy a new car. Now lets take it one step further. You make $7 an hour at a pizza joint. so that is at 40 a week, 280 a week, subtract $8 for food, and you come up with $240 a week! Plus tips which I will estimate are around $40 total. (that is the least). So you are back at $280 X 52 = $14560. Not bad for a teenager is it? Now I could be making more money than some grown adults, only because I would be trying harder. See, now you would complain the youths are taking your jobs. geuss what we are not. It is the elders that give them to us. So get up, go out, and work damnit!

      Okay so lets talk about politics. I will mainly be basing this on the American election for 2004. So who does Spike want to win? Good question, because to tell you the truth, I haven't even decided yet. They both suck. I don't like those men. I wish it were hard to choose because they were both so good, but sadly, they are not. You have Bush, an ex alcoholic, soldier who went awol and on top of that a daddies boy. And an over concerened show off who wants to give more to the people, so long they pay for it. Bush, dives into pools headfirst, water or no water. Like the war, he just jumped right in, with no thoughts of the after shock. Well geuss what! You say we are safer. Safer my butt. I expect terrorists attacks on us for at least 20 years. They say saddam was using wmds, yeah well geuss what bush, you were wrong. Then they say that Saddam was the wmd and that he was very evil, well geuss what, he did some bad things, but not so bad that he would STOCKPILE WEAPONS OF GENOCIDE! Good job all you politicians who think you have the public's support, you are wrong. Don't think I like Saddam, he did some fucked up shit, but in all honesty, that aside, he wouldn't have hurt the us for a while. We liberated Iraq! Why? For the people? NO! For the oil? Maybe, For the political insecurity that will keep them in an economical depression, keeping them from ever rebelling their American overlords? Yes. Now, as for Osama. He attacked us. He destroys two buildings, so we bomb the&nbsp;shizznizzle out of afghanistan and tear apart their country and make their citizens live in poverty, just because we want revenge. So with all this war, who pays for it? Not the current tax payers, I will, When they are dead and I am older, I will pay for this pointless war, that is if I am safe from the resulting terrorist attacks. Bush has already sucked our funds out, and is giving the wealthy money great. Just&nbsp; great, steal from the poor and give to the rich! Anti- Robin hood.     Now, I support our troops 100 % I believe once we started fighting, there was no turning back, so I support the brave fighting for me. I think that it was right for us to go into afghanistan and take out the Al-queda but not the whole country. Oh, and Bush with his crazy bible talk ( I&nbsp;am a christian). He says that homosexuals should not be married, and actually said he wouldn't allow it. Why not? Because&nbsp;it's&nbsp;gross? Because God said no sodomy! Well geuss what,&nbsp;a sodomizer isn't gay, a man who&nbsp;has "butt sex" with his wife is a sodomizer.&nbsp;The only&nbsp;time the bible states that homosexuality is wrong is when it says that you need to make children and be happy. That doesn't even point the finger at homosexuals. It points the finger at all the people who never get married, or have children!&nbsp;I geuss he just thinks men should have children with women and that they should stay&nbsp;home and watch them then.&nbsp;Geuss&nbsp;what buddy. That is sexist.&nbsp;Maybe he doesn't want a country of the steryotypical candy ass homos well, I've heard stories of vietnam where homosexuals would get their guts spilled, and as they scooped them back in to themselves, they never once complained, just kept&nbsp;doing their duty. So They have more guts than Bush will ever have, so why don't you just give some heros, and&nbsp;your citizens a chance? &nbsp;  Now time for Kerry, a backstabbing hippie.  I hate hippies. When Kerry was in vietnam, he won a silver star and 3 purple hearts. Whoopdee doo! He uses that as a campaign tool. That is wrong. He did what he did to save a man, not to become president. Not to mention, when he got back to Florida, he became a hippie creating the vvaw, the vietnam vets against the war. He should have married Jane fonda, because then they could let our american brothers being held captive rot away, because they think war is wrong. Well geuss what kerry, while you are off fighting against your troops, they are ducking communist bullets for your safety.     &nbsp;He&nbsp;fought, I salute him for that. He was a man at war, and while he was at more, he did more than I ever hope to. But&nbsp;as soon as he returned from the war, he did&nbsp;something I don'tlike, by demoralizing our troops.&nbsp;I only fear what will happen if he gets office. Not to mention how he speaks of his new policies like they are as sweet as candy and sugar, well they aren't. I don't want to pay for your tax cuts. So what I get money back, who pays for it later? Who pays for the health care of the Americans who are to lazy to get a job? Me. So screw that. But besides that, he will end up doing more for our countryt then Bush will. He is taking away his money to give it to the public. Stopping tax cuts from going to the upper class. Kerry, I salute you for this, for taking your money and giving it to the poor.   So now the tiem has come. Who should be The President? WHO? Well, I can't vote yet so it doesn't matter, but all in all, I think I am for Kerry. Bush has just done alot I disagree with. Kerry has too, but at least he fought. At least he wants his people to prevail, as where Bush is 50% people 50% religion. Seperate the church and the state man. Oh well. I geuss I am a kerry supporter. Not by much, but I am.

      Okay, lets talk about movies. This year, I have seen Dodgeball, the Village,Spiderman 2, Big Fish, Secret Window, and Troy. Out of these movies, 2/6 were awsome, 3/4 were alright, and 1/1 were just good to watch with a funny friend.  Now, Dodgeball, was a hilarious movie, I give major props to dodgeball, but there were many things I would have done differantly, like the obsession with unicorns. WTF, and steve the pirates (***spoilers***)  leaving served no purpose what so ever. It might have been for comic reasons, but him coming back in the post game made no impact on me. What would have been funnier if he was actually Chuck Norris's son or something,  that would have made me laugh. (***end spoilers***) (highlight to see them) Overall score 6/10  The Village, oh the Village. This movie with the exception of 1 part was about as predictable as rolling a ball down a hill. Will it go down? The movie wasn't even scary. At two parts, I recall jumping in my chair. (***spoilers***)  The first was when the demon walked under the tower, I knew it would happen, just the sight of one in a cloak surprised me, and the second was when Ivy heard noah in the suit, and turned around and there it was, then she hid behind a tree and it was right next to her, then it charged. The only reason that got me was well, because that shit was scary. End of story. Now, I knew noah was the demon before it got to him without the mask, I knew the elders were the demons, and that Lucious was going to get stabbed, I knew that Lucious would save Ivy, and that most of all, she would makie it back safe with the medicine (***end spoilers***) (highlight again) So this movie isn't for a horror crowd. But more of a suspense. My friend didn't get all of what happaned before it did, but I did, because if I made a movie like that, I would do the same things. overall : 6/10  Spiderman II. This movie just rocked. I loved the Bruce Cambell part, and the director is the schizz. Overall : 9/10  Big Fish took an alternate spin on the fantasy genre. It incorporated everything from giants, to werewolves, to siamese singing vietnamese twins. The movie simply said was awe inspiring. My mother didn't like it, but hey, I did! Overall 8.5/10  Secret Window was also very predictable, but did succeed in making me jump in my seat some. Snaps for that. But that aside, they changed the book around, and a screw driver, how unoriginal. Overall : 6/10  Troy. Troy troy troy troy troy. Wow, way to rewrite history. A sevral year war turned into....12 days. The lack of immortality, and the cheesiest line of the year : "the god's, they envy us because we can die, feel pain, and love." Or something along those lines. It was teh suck. Overall : 4/10  Now people tell me Riddick was the best movie, and I slap them. These peices of shit movies don't deserve to be played on big screens. THey suck, with bad acting, and more concern for digital effects than a story, I cry. The same with 2 fast 2 furious, I didn't even watch it. I hate pop movies, like the fast and furious series, the riddick series, the chick flicks, the over rated police movies (i.e: SWAT). I can't take it. I have seen so many good American Movies, in fact, I have been keeping a record, and am running on roughly 411 hours of movies. (that doesn't include the ones I forgot). So total probably about 500-600 hours. I've seen se many American movies, I have started in the foreign business. I watched Les Pactes Des Loups, one of my favorite movies, (The Brotherhood of the wolf), Battle Royale, a sick japanese movie that just flat out rocks, Battle Royale II, same thing, The seven samurai, on my top 5 list, and Wasabi, a kick ass Japanese French movie. All these movies are great, why can't America learn a thing or two? I'll tell you, rap, pimp my ride, collumbine, and teen suicide, all these things stop American movies from growing to their full potential. When you have people who just want guns and bitches (rap) in their movies, the media delivers half assed movies that a 3 year old could understand. When we have movies based soley on Cars, well that just sucks. You have Coullmbine, which stops movies with kids holding guns in them from ever being released state side. (Battle Royale, Battle Royale II). The Teen suicide thing keeps truly moving movies, that would make you depressed for a while, and things that show reasons to die being released, because the kids might be influenced. Me and a friend decided to make sure that we would make a movie here so that it would be known as not only awsome, but completely breaking the rules. What happens? It gets canceled. Why? Because our parents said that if we made a contorversial movie with teens fighting, then other teens will reinact it, and kill their friends. I was like WTF! Just because some deranged lunatics killed their peers at highschool doesn't mean everybnody who sees our movie will. Either way it got canceled. So instead we are making a movie about a serial killer and a bumch of kids who have to escape. Sounds like your normal slasher eh? Not, I made sure when writing the script to insure that it will be like nothing you've ever seen before, when it gets done, I'll start taking orders. Well for now, I have to go eat my Ramens, and shoot some peers. (not really)
