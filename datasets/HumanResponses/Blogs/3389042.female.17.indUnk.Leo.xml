      i'm here at atlantic city right now.. i arrived here at 4p yesterday.. we went to the movies and watched Harry Potter.. nice movie.. =) my aunt watched troy so we had to wait for her.. while waiting for her, we played at the arcade.. and then we went home at 11p. i slept.. i woke up at 10:30a because we had to go to philly to fetch my aunt, unc and cousins. we passed by the krispy kremes shop for our breakfast. we got there. we saw them instantly. i hugged them as soon as i got there! and then we had to wait until 3p because their boxes were delayed. and then we went to kfc to eat our late lunch and then went to the church. we went home.. fixed the things.. i wasnt able to go back to secaucus because it was too late already. so now i'll be sleeping here and i'll wake up at 4a to go back there.. haay.. okies!! i'll watch the lakers game!! ciao!! =)
