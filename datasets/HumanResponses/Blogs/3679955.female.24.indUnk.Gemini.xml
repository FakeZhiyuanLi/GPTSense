      Well, I have about three months until I leave for France.  At this point I know that I will be teaching elementary aged students somewhere within the academy of Grenoble.  I am waiting to receive my arrete de nomination which will tell me the exact city I will be in and the school(s) I will be teaching at.  I am feeling pretty helpless right now because there is nothing I can do until I receive this piece of paper.  Once I get it I can apply for my visa, buy a plane ticket and start hunting for an apartment.  So pretty much, until it comes I am just daydreaming about what my life will be like in three months.  I set up this website for all my friends and family so that they can stay up to date on what is going on, mostly when I am out of the country, but I wanted to get warmed up now. So, this is the beginning and there should be lots of excitement to come!

      Today's Horoscope:    This is a good day to reinforce to yourself that your future happiness is not hinging on one particular person.  Exert your independence.         I found this horoscope to be very relevent to my life right now.  I am currently reading  The Art of Happiness:  A Handbook for Living  by his Holiness the Dalai Lama and Howard C. Cutler, in part because I am about to move to a new country and am feeling a little nervous about the whole experience.   I guess I am most worried about be all alone and unhappy while in France.  I will just have to keep reminding myself where I am and what a wonderful experience it is.  I am also going through a breakup right now with my boyfriend of almost two years, so I need a little inspiration (that's where the horoscope really helps out!).  It's kind of tough when you are used to spending all of your time with one person and then all of a sudden he is not in your life.  But I think I am a pretty independent person and I need to get used to being on my own again.  This book is very helpful so far with explaining that my happiness is in my own hands and I should be able to find happiness wherever I am.  So that is my goal!  I am completely determined to have the best time possible for seven months in FRANCE!  Now if I would just get my arrete so I can start getting really excited.

      I was just looking at my calendar and realized that I have exactly 12 weeks until October 1st, which is the day that my contract begins in France.  I still haven't received my arrete de nom from Grenoble and I am really starting to get frustrated.  I guess my excitement will start to grow again once I finally get it and can start making more plans.  I am hoping to head overseas around September 20th so that I can get situated and find a place to stay.  Other than that life is pretty boring in La Crosse, Wisconsin right now and I just keep thinking about how exciting it is about to become.  I am sure these next 12 weeks will go by very quickly.  Until then I am    trying   to work as much as possible and get all my bills paid off.  I have been coaching figure skating at the ice rink everyday this past week, which isn't exactly where I would like to be in July, but it's money.  I love those girls too and I am going to miss them next year.  I have been working with most of them for the past five years and it is amazing to watch them grow and improve.  You make me proud!  I'll be looking forward to coming back in the spring to see you all!

      My Arrete de Nomination finally came on Friday, July 30th 2004! After two weeks of running to the mailbox about three times a day, of course it showed up while I was at work. My parents were kind enough to hand deliver it to me while I was working at the mall and I didn't expect it at all. And then of course I didn't want to know where I was going to be, but I got very lucky! I was placed in Echirolles in the Isere Department. Here is a map of the Academy of Grenoble to give you a better idea of how large it is.   urlLink http://www.ac-grenoble.fr/admin/academie/decouvrez/cartes/index.htm   I could have been placed anywhere in this area, which is about 200 miles long. Echirolles is only 4 miles south of the city of Grenoble so hopefully I will have plenty of housing options and other things available to me. I have been trying to research as much as possible, but it just makes me more and more anxious to get there! All the pictures look beautiful! As of right now I am researching tickets. I think it will be easier to fly into Geneva, Swizterland than Paris. Then from Geneva I can fly right into Grenoble. I have no idea how I am going to pack for this whole thing and I am not looking forward to hauling all of my luggage around until I find a place.   Here are some more links in case anyone is interested in information on Grenoble:   urlLink www.ac-grenoble.fr   The website of my academie   urlLink http://www.grenoble-isere-tourisme.com/accueil_eng.htm  The tourists office - in English!!   urlLink www.ville-grenoble.fr   About the city - This one is in french only  I will add more as I find them!    urlLink
