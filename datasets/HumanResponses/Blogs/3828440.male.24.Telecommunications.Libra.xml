      There's this girl that i like... She may not always know but she's beautiful There's never enough hours in the day I'm always left wanting I'm always left needing more More of her  My mind left spinning prepetually Always She moves me She takes me out of myself and makes me new Effortlessly , flawlessly  When she looks at me i am quieted Tongue tied Unable to do unable to speak My lips longing to touch yours  Will you grant me what i wish for My legs are tired and my tears all gone If i were blind my eyes would still recognize you Every ounce of my being knows you As if we were old spirits akin to each other Or maybe just two sides of the same coin  I would have you in my arms till this shit ended Till society understood conformity and chose not to All though that may never happen.... I've had you in my arms before  Chances are good that you will end up there again  Chances are good Probably won't let go Feeling is noticably real To real to ignore or disregard for fancy  You're great you know that? And if i could have your beauty in my life everyday from now on  If i could sit and talk with you everyday If i could hold you when you were scared or had a bad dream That is something real Real is what i crave What i crave is you...you are perfect  &nbsp;

      Verse 1   I see you sitting by the window of your car  You smile  I see you laughing  Out of the corner of my eye   So many things that i've wanted to say  The things I feel  My thoughts of you  I'm going crazy but it's not crazy that I feel   What i woudn't give to stay locked in this moment with you  Beautiful you are so beautiful  Far to beautiful for me   Chorus   This moment is perfect  And I want to stay  Lost in this moment with you  For another day or maybe just an hour or two&nbsp;   Yesterday I had a dream that this could happen  But i never thought that it could be true  Because of your eyes and smile i'm lost  Please don't let me stare too long   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;

      As I wait for you to enter my plain of existence My mind wanders Back to the past  When the things i used to do i hadn't thought of And you were just a vision in a surreal dream  It was getting late and I being of a mind that is always evolving came to a thought If this is a true feeling And my mind is not playing tricks  The you are emotion  You are the invisible movement that sets my mind at ease and puts a smile on my face You are emotion  Emotion a force that moves the heart and sets the soul free My soul soars and my mind sits in wonder and excited anticipation What's next?  If this is feeling and you are emotion then this emotion continues to improve You are that which improves me  My focus and my labor Morning thoughts slipping into nightly dreams You are emotion  That fire in my life and that desire to do To become the best for you  To become emotion in your life To move you I am that emotion that you are and you are that emotion in me

      Distorted perceptions of reality Loves lost Loves gain Encouraged cannibalism of the mind and heart Documentation of the insane  Projected predjudices Disguised as spiecies validation Incoherant babblings of wise men Unconditonal surrender of morals held true Choosing conformity now and then  Trust eludes Real purposes intended Meaningful foundations laid Scared of the easily offended  Restoration of restitution Favors disguised as blessings

      Do you remember springtime... How it brought you back to mind Carried you across fields blooming Your scent your voice..  Can you still see the stars from that night? The ones that I swear I see in your eyes Dancing across the heavens Beautifully being..  The soft gentle caress of the wind Moving it's way across your face as if it were a hand gently touching your cheek Wipping your tears from cold... How I wish that were my hand....  Your favorite song plays gently on the radio.. You slip into melodic exstasy Feeling you move closer and closer into the warmth of my body. Your heartbeat.....your heartbeat  My heart is beating and i've noticed i'm alive Feeling each breath you take Snuggling into the warmth of my arms  Your head pressed against my cheek Your lips still moving with the words of the song  What do I do This moment... This place... It feels... I feel... I do...  Silently ... the words come  As though they had always been there Words meant for your ears for your heart Your soul

      My sanity oh God! Give me my sanity. Strip this pain that numbs my heart, And let me indulge in happiness once again.  Rain clouds all it does is rain, Can you stand the rain? Or will it drown you out? Perhaps it will sweep you away.  Wash it all away Every thought Every Memory Every expression of love Of true love  Someone please take away this pain Release me from the limiting hold of emotion Release me from trust and understanding Cut loose the bonds of affection and warmth  My mind still holds tightly But on what reality  When will it all be done Life a parody of death When we live we are alone When we die we are alone  Death while alive causes sorrow Bordering on the suicidal and psychotic

      Where can I begin to describe the beauty i see in you Do you know what it's like to capture the uncaptureable?  To put in words what no words can adequately describe. You are a mystery to me  You have all the grace and beauty of a symphonic masterpiece Carefully arranged to compliment every wonderfully beautiful part of you.  From your porcelin skin to the delicate contours of your face, To the way your body moves with all the grace of moonlight creeping its way across the bed spread at night.  To say your beautiful is an understatement. An angelic vision still would not capture it.  To say your are a beautiful angelic light that shines in my heart would be close.  But it would still not convey the way I feel when I look at you. The way my heart weeps with joy because you love me And the way my soul cries when you tell me how much you do.

      Faith keeping the boundless limits of premonition away.  Slap happy comentary with a happy go lucky attitude.  Forced and pressed into a shape that's impossible to imagine or calculate.  Simper Gumby....always flexible.  It's all about mind numbing pain isn't it?  To love is to hate to hate is to love...or is it because that something makes us vulnerable that we do love...or hate. Hayrides and sock hops..a thing of the past in a distant future reality if you will.  A past present future tense.  An abrupt halt, your soul rising to heaven and then just ceasing to rise, just ceasing to be.  You've become reality so reality doesn't think you exist...but in the imaginations of little children and the mentally ill.  A fraudulant portrayal of an actual existing thread of fate. Where do we dwell but in the minds of the idealogically sound.....the conservative highly religous.....or the pompous liars.  The soothing feeling you get from vicks vapor rub is awesome isn't it?  Kind of a euphoric sensitivity without a lock and key. Maybe it's not so bad though....maybe it's just an orchestrial piece and this is just the first movement in the Key of D minor.  Just a hobbyists arrangement strewn all over the floor.  So we see everything and see nothing at the same time.....and that's the hard part.  The part that makes it hurt the worst. All this time my hearts been beating to the tune of something written by Al Green on a sunday morning while in his bathrobe sitting by a pool somewhere.  Perhaps that tune was written for someone else and I just happened to come about this most beautiful creation by accident....  The point is is knowing knows and not knowing never can understand.

      My moon You are that... That which captures my admiration My mind and heart caught in your beautiful light Warming embrace of familiarity Tenderness caressing my soul Your glow surrounded by it you hold me Bathed in you.... You are my saving grace my insanity and passion made flesh My love the carrier of the shattered pieces of my heart..  You are my star Although i'm not always quite sure what that means You're beautiful My thoughts are of you no matter what i undertake It's you I see when I open my eyes and when i close them Such grace and elegance Your laugh echoing in the air around me Eyes peering into the depths of my unworthy soul filling it with heavenly light Blinded by you....  My heart is overflowing This blood racing through my veins My heart pounding in my chest Feelings not felt in awhile manifested They belong to you and you alone My walls torn down Replaced with an ever increasing desire to be with you To watch you to love you Passion utter passion An urge to be next to you an urge...urge... A longing to show you how i feel and how much i feel it Touches in love Traces of my fingertips across your body... Remembrance, remembering how you feel Scent lingers on me Your porcelin skin....the contours of your body... You fit.  Everything i feel is reality Though Chaotic Such is love Order is not always beautiful My life ordered for a time Is Chaos because of you Beautiful chaos You are my reality and that is chaos My moon my star my heart....such is love
