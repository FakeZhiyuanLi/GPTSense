      Continueing my current trend of the vacation of mediocrity, the traditional drunken family party simply had to be thrown. Apparently every year my great aunt and uncle throw a lou-ow, as in coconuts and hawaiin shirts. Just when myself, my aunt, uncles, cousins, and grandma were ready to leave my uncles mini-van doesnt turn over. Two hours later we're on our way, minus my aunt and youngest cousin. Like most family parties it ended up being dull for the most part.  As we were walking into the giant tent that was set up in the backyard my uncle slapped my with the designated driver post.  If it wasnt for that the party probably would have been much more enjoyable.  Because of the hawaiin theme and because that part of the family really likes to go all out; there was even a hula/belly dancer.  Obviously that was one of the things that made the party a little more enjoyable.  This woman was pretty hot, mabey like a seven and a half.  Not sure wether its her really name or not but i think that my aunt mentioned that she went by Bina.  In sudden revelation that this is a step away from a pornographic novel, the dancer woman wasn't a stripper, despite that that would have been....interesting.  After being forced to sit with the adults for an hour and a half I was finally able to mingle with people that are at least close to my age.  My second cousin, for whom the party was being thrown, started introducing me to some of her friends.  At this point many of them had been drinking for around eight hours.  The entire experience can be summed up with the words of one her teacher friends "My students know that im a raunchy motherfucker." She was an interesting person to say the least. It was because of her that i realized the fact that females apparently get a little footloose after drinking.  My second cousins were telling me how perturbed they were when there friend was quasi-hitting on their "little cousin" when she stepped out of the room for a moment.  It was just this side of being hysterical.  So because i have the worst luck in the world, my grandma decided it was time to go home.  So at around 1:30 we finally went home just as I was really starting to have fun. .

      In a time when nothing seems as if it will happen, everything will happen.  Today was more than eventful, especially by my standards.  I was awoken this morning by the sounds of my two year old cousin, Ellen (or baby ego as some might call her), demanding to play the piano.  Now don't get me wrong, I do love the little girl, but when her family comes and she takes my bead forcing me to sleep on a couch only to force me into an early morning stupor; I'm most definatly going to harbor at least some ill will. Once I was able to stumble off the couch that i had been allocated  to like a refuggee to a camp when my cousin invaded my bedroom, my grandma made everyone some great breakfast.  If there is one thing about my grandma it is that she loves her food.   After lolling around in my well fed catatonic state I followed my usual routine and i went downstairs and hopped on the computer.  After poking around for a few minutes I get an IM from Stephanie P. my off and on again girlfriend.  The night previous to this there was a school dance, if one can even call it that.  Like most things at the International Academy if it doesn't require academics then we suck at it.  For most of the dances the guys stand in a corner and don't even make a token effort to dance.  But i digress.  Getting back to the point, I was not able to go to the dance for two reasons 1) I no longer attend the International Academy and 2) I'm 11 hours away in North Jersey.  So her and the rest of my friends who in all likelyhood will slowly ostracize me for returning to my home high school.  So it was in that moment that she realized that we will hardly see each other anymore and that she needed to break it off.  Once again, just when i think I can finally turn things in my life around and I'll be able to get outta of bout of horrific depression, life turns out to be the seagul to my oyster.
