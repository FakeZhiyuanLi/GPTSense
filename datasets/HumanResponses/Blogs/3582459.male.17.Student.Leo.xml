      I'm going to waive the word:image ratio for this post because this topic isn't conducive to good photos.  As I was taking a shower today, I somehow stumbled onto the topic of the ends justifying the means. Generally, people today (at least the liberals who surround and think similarly to me) seem to think that the ends don't justify the means. Usually they give some example along the lines of killing babies for food or imprisoning millions of people to stop one murderer. However, I don't agree wholeheartedly with a blanket statement such as, "the ends do not justify the means," though I don't necessarilly agree with the inverse either.  In reality, the ends do justify means a lot of the time, if the ends are good enough. For example, killing someone is generally considered a bad thing--if we want to apply Kant's categorical imperative (which is bunk, by the way), we could say that killing someone is always wrong--but in some situations it is definitely necessary and perhaps even right; if a man is pointing a machine gun at a hospital full of babies and little girls, it is not only acceptable but even right for the police officers to shoot him. Of course, the assumption underlying this example is that it doesn't matter what party takes an action; the state (police officers) is held to the same moral standards as the individual. I'm going to say that this is a reasonable assumption, as I don't see why the state should be allowed any more moral leeway than the individual.  Some may say that this is a straw man argument, that this is an extreme example that stretches the argument out of proportion. But in reality, this is exactly the kind of argument that exposes the fundamental flaw in saying that the ends don't ever justify the means; when the benefit end is incredibly greater than the drawback means, the end does justify the means. To generalize, when the positiveness of the ends outweighs the negativeness of the means, the ends do justify the means.  Of course, the situations I mentioned earlier (killing babies for food &c.) still hold. So how do I reconcile the two?  The answer lies in the weighing process. In the situations I mentioned earlier, the ends were marginal in comparison to the means, so the ends do not justify the means in those situations. To generalize, when the positiveness of the ends is outweighed by the negativeness of the means, the ends do not justify the means.  Combine the conditionals I mentioned earlier: the ends justify the means in situations when the positiveness of the ends outweighs the negativeness of the means.  This thought experiment was pretty intuitive and didn't require much complex reasoning, but sometimes when we (we being people collectively, not the royal we) discuss things, we ignore the weighing mechanism and pick the platitude that fits our argument more.  The difficult part with applying this generalization is in situations when the ends and means are closer. Here are some situations:  1. On a heavy note, if we say that abortion is wrong because feti (fetuses?) are humans and have souls (which is sort of implied by parts of the Bible, though I don't think it's ever explicitly stated that killing fetuses is wrong, I may be wrong--I can think of a lot of Biblical and pseudo-Biblical arguments that may or may not hold water for both sides about early abortions that I don't really have the capacity to go into at this point), an argument can still be made for abortion being legal, along the lines of: the benefit of allowing people who would substantially tax society by having babies (through welfare and the like) outweighs the drawback (need a more evil sounding word here) of aborting those fetuses. Basically, this devolves into two main arguments, one about who decides whether the benefit is great enough, and the other about whether abortion is so morally wrong that it's off the charts in evilness (that babies haven't sinned so they are more worthy than sinful humans may figure into this, too). Maybe it's just liberal Palo Alto talking, but I'm inclined toward saying that early term abortions should be universally legal though not encouraged.  2. On a lighter note, if we say that doing things just for college is bad because it leads to cutthroatness and delegitimizing heartfelt compassion when it has to do with community service, a debate arsises with respect to volunteering: is it right for the individual to volunteer to get hours to get into Oxford, Harvard, MIT, &c. from the view of society? The positive externality by the volunteer to society is helping the world--teaching famished illiterate orphans in Liberia to read--and the negative the intangible cheapening of volunteerism and increase in cutthroatness and competition in society. I personally lean toward saying that the more volunteering people do, the better.  I apologize for using so many parenthetical things; I just talk with a lot of appositives and things like that.

      Be warned: this is a long post (1400 words or so), so I recommend reading it in chunks. Read from one picture to the next; they roughly mark section by section.  Today, In the Light, Gunn's Christian club, had a barbecue to welcome the soon-to-be-graduated eighth graders from JLS (Termaners were notable in their absence) at Mitchell Park. I estimate that 15 people attended, about eight middle schoolers and seven high schoolers. The other end-of-the-year event that In the Light has traditionally held is Senior Night, which also appears to be not happening (I was told that it was happening but when I went to investigate about 20 minutes ago no one was as Gunn).  Contrasted with previous years' barbecues, this year's was sort of wimpy. I remember that 40 or 50 people attended previous barbecues (starting with the one I went to after eighth grade). In addition, about 25 people went to Senior Night in previous years.   urlLink    Patrick (left) looks at the camera while others converse over food at the annual In The Light barbecue at Mitchell Park today (June 10, 2004). Attendance at the barbecue was markedly lower than in previous years.&nbsp; urlLink    I know I am not in a position to criticize the leadership as I have not made any significant effort to become a leader, and I do not intend this post as criticism, but it is clear to any objective observer that In the Light's meetings and organization this year has been weak when compared to previous years'. That attendance at the barbecue, probably the biggest event in the second semester, could decrease by more than 50% is disturbing. Moreover, this lack of attendence symbolizes the decline that the In the Light club has experienced this year.  Basically, I see three main forces behind the decline of In the Light in this most previous year. First, In the Light did not have a large, devoted group of seniors and a strong president, resulting in fragmentation and lack of unity. Second, the club did not organize meaningful small groups until perhaps second semester, and even then the small groups were of lower integrity than in previous years. Third and perhaps most important, the club failed to have meaningful, Spirit-led meetings on Wednesdays.   urlLink    While playing link tag at the barbecue, Stephanie (center left) laughs while Bethia (center) and Jonathan (right) look on. Only two seniors were present at the barbecue, representative of the unsually low number of seniors in In the Light this year.&nbsp; urlLink    I don't have the writing ability nor the energy to expand on all three points in a meaningful way right now, so I'll move on to discuss what we as a club and I as a person can do to fight this decline and bring up In the Light as a force for God's will and center of Christian fellowship on the Gunn campus.  All of the issues I discussed earlier stem from one root cause: the leadership that was supposed to run the club this year didn't crystallize until late into the year, and never attained the level of coherence that previous years' leaderships did. So I have three recommendations for the present In the Light leadership and membership.  First, In the Light needs one to three strong leaders who are willing to commit to run the club--this year's committee style of leadership did not work too well. That is not to say that a core group is unnecesary, as in previous years the core group has proven key to success. Rather, I am saying that it is necessary to have strong leaders who are willing to take initiative and do stuff. Who these leaders will be remains unknown; soon-to-be seniors whom I know reasonably well are, in no particular order, Patrick, Stephanie, Jeff, myself, and Josh. I apologize if I left you off of this list.   urlLink    My house in the afternoon. This would not be a good place for core group meetings because people who do not know me would feel awkward going to my house.&nbsp; urlLink    Second, the club needs to have core group meetings at a place other than someone's house. I know that I personally felt awkward  about going to Dustin's house this year for meetings because I did not know him to the point that I didn't actually attend any meetings. It may be that some evil force has a hand in this, but I do believe that meeting at a coffee shop or a book store or something like that would facilitate greater attendance at core group meetings. Currently the meetings appear to be happening at Jeff's house, a place that is slightly less scary to me than Dustin's but I'm sure is equally scary to people who don't know Jeff.  Third, small groups should get started up earlier in the year. I was in Patrick (the elder) and Joe's small group freshman year, Ed's in sophomore year, and Albert's this year. This year's was less well done (no smack at you, Albert, it's a systemic problem) than in previous years, and as a result I did not grow in my faith because of small groups as much as in the comparatively "better" groups by Patrick, Joe, and Ed. Again, no insult to Albert, who definitely worked very hard on the small group.  As a senior next year I feel led to have some responsibility to be a leader in the club. Thus, I make some commitments for myself that I will try to keep over the course of the next year. If you see me reneging on these promises, please let me know.  First, I will attend core group meetings if possible, even if they end up being held at Jeff's house ad infinitum; I will not allow God's will to be hampered by petty awkwardness. If this is not possible because of night classes for calculus at De Anza, I will keep in contact with people who attend the meetings to relay my thoughts and tell me what I can do to contribute to the club.   urlLink    My two bibles. I will ground my small group in the Word in teaching people things, and try in general to commit a significant amount of time to In the Light.&nbsp; urlLink    Second, I will play some role in small groups, prefferably as a small group leader or co-leader. Small groups were the most important thing to me about In the Light when I was a freshman and a sophomore, and I really feel for those who have not experienced a Spirit-led small group in campus fellowship (or at all, for that matter). Indeed, small groups thusfar have been the driving force behind my spiritual growth. More important, I will ground my small group in the Bible because otherwise I may stray into wrong teachings, which would be bad.  Third, I will balance In the Light against my other commitments, recognizing that grades aren't really that important in senior year as long as I get As and Bs and no Cs in first semester (perhaps a 3-3 or even a 4-2 B-A split would be acceptable, recognizing that I need to get an A in calculus at De Anza because that counts for college GPA), and mostly Bs (with the exception of calculus at De Anza again) in second semester, but also remembering that I have other substantial commitments that may take precedence over In the Light.    urlLink    A Eucalyptus tree bathed in light. In the Light's future is as bright as the background behind this tree, its vivacity as great as the photosynthesis in the tree's leaves.&nbsp; urlLink    All these bad things said, In the Light has a bright future ahead of it. With a whole slew of rising seniors, many of the leadership problems may prove to be more solveable. In addition, I can sense that the current club has a core of strong believers that I believe will continue to support in prayer and in logistics other Christians on campus. God willing, this year will go down in the history books as an aberration.  If you have read all of this, I thank you, and apologize for the length of this post. In addition, I apologize if I have offended anyone in the In the Light leadership; I didn't and don't intend to criticize but rather to help build up both the club and myself. Also, I ask any believer who feels led to assist me in keeping to my commitments and in building up In the Light as a force for God on the Gunn campus in whatever way he or she feels led. I'm also sorry if I sounded arrogant in this post.

      One of the first things  The Oracle 's esteemed editors taught me in the spring of 2003 when I was first starting to be an editor was that it was bad to have huge swaths of text without any photos or art. I've found that many web logs and web sites have a very high text-to-image ratio; indeed, many web sites and logs don't even have images at all. This makes those sites hard to read and quite boring, which is acceptable from and expected of boring things like online texts, but should not be the case with web logs, which should be reader-friendly.   urlLink    The classified section from my newspaper--what I don't want my web log to look like.&nbsp; urlLink    So I've decided to try to stick to a 150-300:1 word to image ratio for my web logs. This will force me to post lots of images up to break up text, enhancing readability and increasing entertainment value. I'm sorry if you're on dial-up.   What exactly does a 150-300:1 ratio mean? Basically, the ratio has two key impacts that I think will both be very positive, both arising from image granularity.    All posts will be more than 150 words, as it is impossible to have more than zero images and fewer than one image.    Posts will have images interspersed in them that will ease the reading of text and provide a holistsic view of what I'm talking about.   Note: word counts will be approximate (however many words I feel a certain post is), and I will count captions and the like as part of the word count as I see fit, on a case-by-case basis. If I violate this principle, I will try to fix the violation, and barring that, I will do nothing. Another issue is that currently there is no way for you, the reader, to distinguish between copy and caption. I don't know if or how I'll be implementing some kind of copy-caption distinction in future.

       urlLink    This is a watercolour painting that I did of my (sister's) cat, Rosebud. Okay, so it actually isn't a watercolour painting, but I did take it with my low quality camera.  I originally thought she was named after Rosebud in  Citizen Kane , but it turned out that my sister named her Rosebud after all the rose buds that were blooming when we first got her.   Rosebud is an old cat, about 12 years old, making her equivalent to about a 70 year old human. She was a gift from my dad's coworker, Dado Vrasolovic, who had an unspayed cat. Rosebud is the last of her family to survive; her mother and siblings got run over by cars, poisoned by neighbours, &c.   When I first met Rosebud, when I was four or five, I liked to throw her into our swimming pool. It was a lot of fun, and she started to really dislike me. We're okay now, though; I fed her for a while so she started thinking better of me. I feel kind of bad now for throwing her into the pool so much but I still sort of smile when I think about it. We don't have a pool any more.   urlLink    Note: this photo is slightly different from the higher up one. I just put it here to break up the text some; 400 words needs at least two photos.  When we first got her she was a white cat with pink ears. Now she doesn't have ears anymore but her fur is still white. No, the ears didn't fall off; they got cancer, so a couple years ago my sister took her to the vet and got the ears removed in an elaborate operation to the tune of $1300. I thought it was kind of a waste of money but I suppose it made my sister happy (she  has a lot of money to spend on stuff like this), so it all worked out all right. Rosebud catches mice too, which is kind of nice, though she sometimes leaves half eaten mouse carcasses in various places.  So in conclusion you shouldn't get a white cat with pink ears and make her stay outside because she'll get ear cancer and you'll have to pay $1300 to cure her, even if she is a good mouser. And if you do get a cat don't throw her into your swimming pool or she'll dislike you for a long time, though eventually she'll learn to love you if you feed her for a while.   I should learn how to paint watercolour. It seems pretty cool.  &nbsp; urlLink

      Hello everyone.   I decided to make a blogger blog for three main reasons:     I think it's kind of cool to be able to post things that people will read. I'm not exactly sure what I'll write up here but I like the idea of having a format that allows me to communicate in a thoughtful, meaningful way (as opposed to telephone, in person, &c., formats in which I tend to lose my train of thought)     My first attempt at doing something like this on my own web site failed horribly.     I've noticed a disturbing trend of people opening "xanga"s and to a lesser extent "live journal"s. This must end! For some reason I'm opposed to those two web sites but I'm not opposed to blogger--perhaps because blogger has a cool interface and is run by Google.     Hencefourth I will try to limit my usage of Internet words like "blog" and just call this a web log. In general, I will try to avoid using jargon (arr, I hate this word but I can't think of an equivalent) if possible. Right now I'm lamenting my choice of name for this web log; I should have just called it "Charly's" [For historical reference: at 9:08 p.m. on 8 June 2004 the web log is officially named "Charly's blog"]. I will try to remedy this with all deliberate speed.  Furthermore, I will try to use British English when possible. I think British English looks more elegant than American English. For a good guide to British English, go to  urlLink http://economist.com/research/StyleGuide/ ,  The Economist 's style guide. If you don't know what  The Economist  is, just know that it's a very good news magazine.  I don't have much else to do at this moment. I suppose I could work on my computer science final and/or project, but I lack the willpower.

      Argh, I'm not good enough at writing to articulate what I want to say. More revisions to come later.  One of the biggest stumbling blocks in my faith up until a few months ago was my fuzzy definition of faith; I wasn't sure if my faith was deep or believing enough. This was partly because I had only been a Christian for a few years and was thus unsure of myself, and was also because of a weird example of faith: God eminently exists just as a chair eminently exists, so one's faith in God should be as taken-for-granted as having faith that one's chair will not fall apart upon one's sitting down in that chair.  Basically, I had trouble taking for granted God's existence and provision; I expected that believing in God was an emergent truth from observation. Since I wasn't as confident about my faith in God as I was about my faith in my chair not falling apart, I seriously questioned myself, which was sort of good.  A few months ago it occured to me that having faith in God does not necessitate one being confident in him in the same way one is confident in a chair.   Exodus (particularly Exodus 4): When Moses was first starting out as a leader, God told him to go lead the Israelites who were slaves at the time, and that he would provide Moses with the necessary speaking skills &c. Moses replied that he wasn't much of a speaker and generally doubted his ability to lead the Israelites, even though God had told him directly to do so and that he would provide him with whatever was necessary. God responded by scolding Moses, who ended up leading the Israelites out of Egypt, parting the Red Sea, and the rest is history. Here, I see that Moses doubted; I see his faith wavering a little bit. Indeed, when he first started talking to the Israelites, it's very possible he was scared and unsure of himself even though God had told him directly to do it. What's important here is that even Moses, one of the great men of faith in history, had doubts about God, who was in some ways more eminently real to him than to us (that is not to say that we today can not have faith like Moses did). He showed his faith by ultimately doing what God told him to do, even though he had personal doubts--indeed, when Moses first started out, it seems that he wasn't as confident in his faith in God as he was in more mundane things.   Acts (particularly Acts 6-7) When Stephen presented his defense of Jesus and of himself to the Sanhedrin, it never once says that he spoke without stuttering a little bit or being afraid (indeed fear would be reasonable as he was martyred). It never says that Stephen spoke with complete confidence and had and absolute command over fear or doubt; it just says that he spoke. This is stretching beyond the passage, I know, but it seems quite reasonable to me that Stephen was afraid here, that Stephen could have been completely unconfident about Jesus here. But again, I see a man overcoming any and all fears and acting in a way that was according to God's will.  In both Moses and Stephen, I see an overcoming of doubt followed by acting according to God's will. I do not see senseless, take-God-for-granted actions. I see force of will overcoming doubt--the quintessence of faith.

      Today I walked to the Los Altos Library from my house. It took about 45 minutes to get there--the library is about 2.5 miles away. I went there to return a book,  The Partly Cloudy Patriot  by Sarah Vowell a few days overdue, and while there I read some newspapers.  More specifically, I read about a week's worth of  The Christian Science Monitor  (CSM), which, despite the scary sounding name, is one of the five national (secular) newspapers, the others being  The New York Times , the  Los Angeles Times ,  The Wall Street Journal , and  The Washington Post . The CSM is unique in that it's printed on tabloid size paper rather than broadsheet size paper. Tabloid is smaller than broadsheet.  In any case, the CSM continues to impress me with journalistic integrity and general goodness. It costs a dollar, but is about 30 pages long and packed with useful information. Except for the one Christian Science (which is a cult) article on the last page, all of the stories in the CSM are usually worth reading or at least skimming. In addition, articles are just the right length--long enough that they leave few unanswerwed questions, but short enough that I can read them pretty quickly.   In contrast, I'm disappointed in the print edition of  The New Republic  (TNR), a left-leaning political magazine I recently ordered. It's only 40 pages long and is printed on magazine sized paper, so it has less content than  Time  magazine. Also, the articles are far too long for me to read in one sitting--they often span several pages. They're good articles, though.  Both periodicals are used extensively in speech and debate circles for evidence.   Getting only the Friday CSM all year round costs $52, and getting 44 issues of the almost-weekly TNR costs about $40. If I had to choose one as my only news source, I'd choose the CSM. But since we get the San Jose  Mercury News , it's better for me to get TNR.   Both the CSM and TNR use a lot of good vocabulary, so if you're planning on studying for the SAT I'd recommend reading them.  The Economist  is good too.

      Today, after eating dinner at Fresh Choice, Marcell, Greg, and I watched  Red Sonja , a 1980s movie starring Arnold Schwarzenegger. It's a very bad movie, possibly the worst movie I've ever watched.   I never thought I'd say that about a movie starring Schwarzenegger. Probably that's because  Red Sonja  isn't actually a Schwarzenegger movie; it's a movie that happens to have him in it. The actual star is a woman who is both horrible at acting and doesn't have Schwarzenegger's moviegenic personality.   Here's the movie's plot: priesthood of women guards green orb that can destroy the world somehow, and prepares to destroy it. An evil queen kills all the woman-priests except for one, Sonja's sister. Sonja's sister meets Schwarzenegger who takes her to Sonja. Sonja goes off on quest to blow up the orb, sister dies, Schwarzenegger follows stealthily. Along the way they meet the boy prince of a kingdom destroyed by the evil queen with the orb. They travel together on a quest to kill the evil queen and blow up the orb. Guess who wins.  Okay, so Schwarzenegger movies aren't known for plot, or even special effects (which were seriously wanting in this movie). Fine. But in this movie even the fight scenes were bad; the scenes that had Schwarznegger were pretty good, but everything else was horrible. In most Schwarzenegger movies this isn't a big deal because he's in all of the fight scenes, but in this movie this was a problem because half the time it was Sonja who actually did the fighting.   In conclusion, you shouldn't watch  Red Sonja . You should watch any other movie by Schwarzenegger, though, except possibly  Last Action Hero , which I hear was bad but haven't seen yet.   Actually, now that I think about it, the only violent movies I like are about guns and karate; I don't like sword movies much. That's another reason why  Red Sonja  is a bad movie--it's a sword movie.

      I've always though of myself as a liberal, but the more I think about it, the more conservative I am. If I were put on a national average I'd probably be a moderate or slightly left-of-center, which makes me part of the reactionary right at Gunn. I like to read  The New Republic , a liberal political magazine, but I don't agree with many of the positions it pushes. I agree with it more, however, than I do with conservative magazines like the  Weekly Standard .   Here are some politicians whom admire for various reasons. Yes, I know that their stances on issues vary widely. You can accuse me of being manipulated by the media and having no real political thought on my own, and I'll defend myself by saying that I'm just a dumb 16-year-old who doesn't have any meaningful comprehension of politics, doesn't pay taxes, and takes too much for granted in his country, yet is still trying to formulate a substantive political position. If you look carefully, you'll notice that all five people I've listed have been really famous recently. I would add Olympia Snowe, Arlen Specter, Diane Feinstein, and Jim Jeffords onto this list but that would make me look wholly beholden to heavy media coverage.    Colin Powell (Republican)   urlLink    Colin Powell is a moderate Republican.&nbsp; urlLink    I don't know a whole lot about Colin Powell's domestic stances--he probably doesn't have any--but I do know that his foreign policies are pretty reasonable. I don't think that war is ever really necessary and believe that it should pretty much be avoided/prevented at all costs, but as far as actual statesmen go, Powell seems to highly dislike fighting, and has the credentials--as a four star general--to oppose war. My bet is that if Powell were president, we wouldn't have gone to war in Iraq (I've heard this term so much it makes me want to cry; hereafter it'll be known as the war), which would have been good.   John McCain (Republican)   urlLink    John McCain is a moderate Republican&nbsp; urlLink    John McCain styles himself as a modern Teddy Roosevelt, and I find that kind of gung-ho progressivism romantically appealing. He's a little conservative on some social policies for me, but in general his fiscal stances make a lot of sense and he seems pretty honest, with all the campaign finance reform and such. He's a little too hawkish for me, though, having supported the war.   Arnold Schwarzenegger   urlLink    Arnold Schwarzenegger is also a moderate Republican.&nbsp; urlLink    Schwarzenegger is a great guy. I'll ignore his questionable personal history and talk about his stances. His fiscal policies are nice, especially to my well-off family, and his social policies are pretty reasonable, being pro-abortion and not really caring about gay marriage. If anything, his social policies are left of where I am. Also, he generally seems pro-environment which appeals to me, which is ironic because I drive a full-size diesel that gets like 22 miles per gallon.   Howard Dean   urlLink    Howard Dean is a moderate Democrat (!).&nbsp; urlLink    I almost volunteered for this guy over winter break. His fiscal policies in Vermont were very good, balancing the budget while improving health care and education, and in general is more moderate than most people think; he's pro-guns, for example--not that I really care about gun control laws. Civil unions are pretty reasonable, too.    Bill Clinton   urlLink    Despite what some people say, Bill Clinton is a moderate Democrat.&nbsp; urlLink    Bill Clinton sort of started the whole New Democrat thing where Democrats were actually pro-small government and pro-balanced budgets. As a young person, deficits are incredibly important to me (third only to having cheap public universities and promoting jobs for entry-level people), and Clinton and all of the others I've mentioned in this post--eexcept Powell because he doesn't have any evident fiscal policy stance--are anti-deficit, unlike our current president. During Clinton's administration, welfare reform and NAFTA were enacted, and thusfar I think those programs have been tremendously successful and I support them fully.  I guess I'll summarize what I think about politics now:   Foreign Policy  I don't see the exercise of U.S. power as useful in this world; it's pretty much impossible for us as a nation to change the lives of any people in the world with hard power unless we want to spend trillions of dollars on troops and weapons and lose hundreds or thousands or tens of thousands of soldiers--just look at how Iraq and Afghanistan are and how much they cost ($150 billion and 300 lives a year is a reasonable estimate).   I suppose that means that I would surrender to the terrorists; no, that doesn't mean convert to Islam and stop drinking alcohol, which by the way I don't drink, but it does mean pulling troops out of places we aren't wanted (like Saudi Arabia and  urlLink Iraq ) and accepting the resultant doubling, tripling or quadrupling of petrol prices. We could use the $150 billion we currently spend on fighting on helping people adjust for the increase in energy costs and on promoting the use of non-petroleum based fuels. I definitely wouldn't start a war to keep energy prices down.  It's kind of depressing, but I see the United States as a country in relative decline when compared to the rest of the world. That doesn't mean that the country itself is declining; no, it means that the rest of the world is growing stronger faster than we are growing stronger. The European Union, which I know is not really a nation, is already on par with us economically, and it's probably impossible to prevent China and India from growing to our size in the next 50 to 100 years except by military power. I wouldn't start a war to keep other people from getting rich enough that they are as wealthy as me.   Also, as a Christian who doesn't know any way to rationalize fighting into Jesus's teachings about turning the other cheek, I'm a pacifist, sort of like 7th Day Adventists and Quakers.     Social Policy   I'm definitely left of center when it comes to social policy, and I reconcile this with my Christian faith with two ideas: that of free will, and that of the secular state.    First, free will: somehow it seems to me that it's more meaningful for me to be allowed to sin and not do it than for me to not sin out of fear of going to jail; it's more meaningful to tell the truth when I don't have to than to tell the truth when someone puts a gun to my head. I get this sort of out of Paul's writings about everything being permissible but not everything being profitable and Paul's saying that he chooses to do stuff like not eat sacrificed food even though he can because by doing so he doesn't cause those around him to stumble. For example, if nobody fornicates because fornication is punished by death, then that I do not fornicate out of my own volition isn't meaningful. In contrast, if it's perfectly legal to fornicate (as it is today) and I do not out of my own volition, then it's clear that I'm somehow different, which opens the door to spreading the Gospel, and makes me feel more legitimate. I guess you could say that the law is sort of a crutch.  Second, the secular state: I know that the secular state is entirely non-Biblical, and the theocratic state is Biblical, but that Israel was a theocracy a few thousand years ago doesn't mean that the United States should be one today. Most of the stuff the Bible says about government is in the Old Testament; the New Testament largely leaves the topic alone aside from implying that I should generally obey the government except when doing so puts me counter to God's will. (Romans something talks about obeying the government, and Jesus has the whole thing with the giving coins with Caesar's head on them as taxes. Paul breaks a lot of laws by continuing to preaching the gospel. Daniel, which is OT, I know, shows a good example of civil disobedience when the Persian king, Cyrus I think, does the 30 day non-worshipping thing which Daniel doesn't comply to. I guess my reading of the Old Testament is selective, as I just realized that I only follow the parts that I agree with; I'll have to pray about this.) In any case, I don't see the government, especially the federal government, as having a huge responsibility to regulate morality; that should be left to families, churches and communities. I hate to repeat cliches but here goes: not everything that is sinful should be unlawful, and not everything unlawful is sinful. That's a cliche that many  urlLink mainline to liberal  protestant churches repeat a lot.  But I digress. My social stances:    I don't care a whole lot about gun control; I'm rich enough to not live in the projects of Chicago, and I am not a southener. I don't personally own a gun and I don't really care whether my neighbor does, as long as he isn't shooting people or other people's cars and animals. It makes sense to outlaw machine guns/anti aircraft guns/explosive rounds/require non-invasive background checks/&c. though.   Abortion is generally a bad thing because of the whole God forming people in mother's womb thing (if there's another thing in the Bible that people use to attack abortion, please let me know as it might change my view on this though probably not), though there is an argument to be made about the first couple months because back in Biblical times people couldn't tell if a woman was with child until quite a ways into a pregnancy. If I were a woman with a healthy, non-health threatening child who was not a product of rape/incest, I wouldn't have an abortion even if it were out of wedlock. I'm glad I'm not a female, especially one in said situation.  Saved!  is a fun movie to watch just for the illegitimate child, by the way.   On gay marriage: I don't think the government should be using the word marriage. Marriage is a holy covenant between man and woman that forms the basic unit of society, when in reality in our society it frequently is just a tax status. Since the government shouldn't be regulating morality, it doesn't have much of a role in marriage. It should issue civil union licenses to couples (only to couples, though) and let the churches bless them and call them marriages if they want to. I don't really know what to think about gays adopting kids, though.   I don't like entitlements (social security, medicare) largely because I probably will end up getting taxed superheavily for them and then have them go bankrupt right when I retire.    Welfare reform was a good thing. That welfare exists and is effective is also a good thing. Right now we have a pretty good balance.   The federal government has no role in K-12 and preschool education. It should hand out more research grants, though.      Fiscal Policy  I touched on this topic earlier, but basically I'm a budget hawk because people who pile on debt today are hurting my future by making me have to pay a lot of taxes, undermining social security and medicare, and possibly even leading to a  urlLink destabilization of the dollar . We should balance the budget over rolling six year periods to adjust for the cyclical nature of business, and start chipping away at our general debt, though having a little debt is good. We should also fund social security and medicare while reducing entitlements. Defence doesn't need as much money as it has; we can reduce our role in the world, too--"let Europe be the policeman." Taxes should be changed so that passive income like capital gains are treated like normal income, and money saved should be used to pay down the deficit first and then lower general income tax brackets (progressively).   Attempts should also be made to encourage Americans to save part of their income, perhaps by weakening the dollar.

      Whenever I see someone make posts like the ones I made earlier, I can't help but think, "what a weenie--what an upstart, overly sentimental weenie, taking everything so seriously, trying to look so smart, teen angst, more teen angst, blah blah blah." What I'm here to tell you is that I'm going to try to be less of a weenie when it comes to stuff like this. I'm only 16 years old; I don't have the perspective or life history to make any meaningful statements about anything more serious than the brand of shampoo I use (I don't use shampoo, by the way; I just use soap on the hair).   I'll now use a cliched quote from  Citizen Kane  to sum up what I'm saying, making it look like I'm well read in film history when in reality the only Orson Welles/Alfred Hitchcock/Francis Ford Coppola/other golden age director movie I've seen is  Citizen Kane , which I blindly accept as the greatest movie ever made because other people say it is: "If I hadn't been very rich, I might have been a really great man." In other words, if I were a black orphan-drug dealer in inner-city Chicago, I'd be allowed to make haughty posts like the ones I made earlier, but since I'm not I just look arrogant and unsubstantial. Now I'll use French to heighten the arrogant effect: c'est la vie.  I'm sorry if I sounded overly thoughtful and meta-y. I'll try to tone down what I say so that my posts actually have meaning when read with the context of a spoiled teenager's life in mind. Maybe I'll try to emulate Sarah Vowell's writing style some more. Please note that this post is not in response to anything anyone has said to me.

      I started working at Lockheed yesterday. I work at the  urlLink Lockheed Martin Solar and Astrophysics Laboratory , on sunspot research with the  urlLink TRACE satellite . Right now I'm just getting acquainted with things, specifically Interactive Data Language (IDL), and the week-to-week things that my job entails. My predecessor, Jon Ullman, is teaching me how to operate programs written by people who worked at Lockheed years ago to monitor the quality and quantity of data that TRACE gathers. The programs update the links at the bottom of  urlLink this site .  I know I sound like I'm boasting and that this stuff could sound very complex, but in reality my job thusfar has boiled down to running and trying to understand programs people wrote years ago, and writing my own trivial programs, all under the watchful eye of now-graduated seniors. For example, I made a number guessing game and a hangman game yesterday.  Work is kind of boring.

      16Then the eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus had told them to go. 17When they saw him, they worshiped him; but some doubted. 18Then Jesus came to them and said, "All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. 19 Therefore go and make disciples of all nations , baptizing them in[1] the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, 20and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you. And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age" (Matthew 28:16-20, New International Version).  16Then the eleven disciples left for Galilee, going to the mountain where Jesus had told them to go. 17When they saw him, they worshiped him--but some of them still doubted! 18Jesus came and told his disciples, "I have been given complete authority in heaven and on earth. 19 Therefore, go and make disciples of all the nations , baptizing them in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit. 20Teach these new disciples to obey all the commands I have given you. And be sure of this: I am with you always, even to the end of the age" (same as above, New Living Translation)  This passage, commonly known as  the great commission  is a large part of why Christians try to evangelize--here, the resurrected Jesus commands his apostles (the eleven) to make disciples of all nations. Often we say we should evangelize without really understanding why, taking the bolded text above out of context and having evangelism exist in a vacuum away from the other parts of our respective walks with God.  It's interesting to see the progression of reasoning in Jesus's speech: "I have authority over everything, so you should teach other people about me [the word disciple literally means student], about my commands, and I will be with you forever." So somehow  Jesus's authority over everything naturally leads to teaching others about him.  What I have said so far is not interpretive at all--it's simply what Jesus said. When I think about how the two ideas (Jesus's absolute power and spreading the gospel) are linked, basically two reasons emerge: first, reverence for God, and second, the best-thing-since-sliced-bread phenomenon.   What do I mean by reverence for Jesus? I mean that it is natural for a person who is aware of an incredible man (someone worthy of reverence) to tell people who are unaware of that incredible man about him. For example, imagine that Jesse lives in an area where nobody reads the newpaper or watches the news, so no one is aware that a great new president has been elected. It is natural for Jesse to tell the ignorant other people about this new president--this new president is just so powerful and worthy of respect. Similarly, it's natural to spread the good news about Jesus because Jesus in personal form was the greatest man to ever live, because he was fully man and fully God, master of the universe, with all authority in heaven and on earth. I think this reasoning process is emergent from the passage.  Now onto the best-thing-since-sliced-bread phenomenon (hereafter known as the bread phenomenon). The most momentous event in any Christian's life is coming to know Jesus; everything else pales in comparison to befriending, knowing, and being the child of the god of everything. I realize that knowing Jesus is an incredible thing, and think it's just so great that other people should get a chance to know too. It's kind of like discovering an incredible new invention that is the best thing since sliced bread--it's too awesome to not share with others, only instead of an invention it's an incredible friend/creator, and instead of best thing since sliced bread it's best thing ever. This reasoning isn't explicitly eminent from the passage, but it definitely is substantiated by other events in the Bible, such as with the various healings, when people were healed and ran around telling everyone how great Jesus was.

      Argh, I typed this all up and then Mozilla crashed when I was looking up a quote. I'm really annoyed. Grrrrr. Oh by the way, I'm going to give up on posting pictures. I've decided that things I post here will be largely for personal edification and clarification.  It seems today that Christians are seen as increasingly closed-minded and conformist. This perception has come about as a result of some (generally conservative) Christians putting topics such as creationism vs. evolution and swearing ("family values") at the forefront of their political agendas, when in reality such debates, while worthwhile to some people, are really trivialities.   When non-Christians people hear of the science teacher in rural Tennessee being fired for teaching the big bang and evolution (not sure if this exact incident happened but this general idea has been publicized), or the Kansas school board removing any mention of evolution from its standardized tests, non-Christians see closed mindedness, anti-intellectualism, and mental conformity. In reality, it doesn't matter one bit to an individual's faith whether he literally interprets the first part of Genesis believes that God directly created the world in six days of twenty four hours, or figuratively interprets that same part and concludes that God created somehow used evolution and the big bang. Indeed, Jesus never really talked extensively about the creation of the world in his fleeting years on Earth.  Some Christians seem to believe that swearing is a cardinal sin, as if the Bible says, "do not say these following words: blah blah blah blah." In reality, the Bible doesn't have such a list. I don't swear because swearing is disrespectful and offensive; I don't swear because I have the fruit of the Holy Spirit. It really doesn't matter if the non-Christian cuss or don't cuss, as clean language is at most a result of striving to show the love of God to others. Indeed, I know some people would rather tell the heathens not to swear than tell them about the love of Christ Jesus, or at least it appears that way. Paul says that evevrything is permissible, but not everything is beneficial (1 Corintians, 10:23); swearing and clean language fall in this category.  Partly for the reasons I have enumerated, Christians sometimes come off as closed minded and conformists when they try to push orthodoxy in behaviour and thought when such orthodoxy is wholly unnecessary, often using trivialities to eclipse or even exclude non-trivialities from meaningful dialogue. The United Church of Christ (formerly the congregationalists) put it well: "in essentials, unity; in nonessentials, diversity"--in other words, in essentials like the divine and messianic nature of Jesus Christ, unity, in nonessentials like belief in creationism, diversity.   This not to say that I am perfect; I am human and am prone to my own hypocrisies and sins, and indeed have generally been a weak witness for God in past. One of the youth counselors at Lord's Grace, Craig Ing, says that we Christians should major in the majors (divinity of Jesus, personal relationship with God, great commission &c.), and minor in the minors (creationism, different amount of water in baptism, whether one should be baptised before taking commuinion, &c.). The Christian community could do better to minor in the minors and major in the majors. I've been rather successful at minoring in the minors, but need to work on majoring in the majors in my spreading the word.

      Whenever I think back to my middle school years, I can't help but think that they were a time of tremendous missed opportunities, specifically in English, social studies, and humanities education. In 6th, 7th, and 8th grades, we read a lot of nice little adventure books like  Julie of the Wolves  that had no real literary or philosophical value. I would much rather we have done a survey of western philosophy and literature instead. Granted, middle schoolers may not understand many of the ideas presented in, for example, the Enlightenment, but exposure to those ideas is valuable in and of itself.  Social studies should be taught in a way that doesn't focus in specific events, but rather focuses on major movements in history, with events and dates only used to illustrate the major movements. Literature read in English should correspond to the movements being studied in social studies. Music and art taught should strive to be representative of the various eras.  Basically, I would structure the middle school years around the writers of the great eras of western civilization: classical western civilization--basically the Greeks and Romans (Aristotle, Plato, Homer, Vergil, St. Augustine); the Renaissance and the Enlightenment (St. Thomas Aquinas, Shakespeare, Sir Thomas More, Immanuel Kant, John Locke, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Thomas Hobbes, Adam Smith, Jonathan Swift); modernity and post-modernity (Friedrich Nietzsche, Karl Marx, Virginia Woolf, James Joyce, Franz Kafka, Michel Foucault, T.S. Eliot, e.e. cummings, Leo Tolstoy). I'd also throw in a survey of American civilization, too, including Samuel L. Clemens (Mark Twain), Edgar Allen Poe, Ernest Hemingway, Thomas Paine, Harriet Beecher Stowe, and Upton Sinclair. If the public school system allows it, some of the Bible (completely in a historical, cultural context) would be good too, as western civilization is pretty firmly rooted in the Judeo-Christian tradition.   That's a lot of authors--29 not counting the Bible--but students wouldn't need to read full books by all of them; most of the above authors wrote excellent short stories, poems, and essays. I would recommend reading 2-3 full books in 6th grade, 4-5 full books in 7th grade, and 5-6 full books in 8th grade.   Students in middle school should also be exposed to the eras of western civilization by looking at representative art and listening to representative music from each particular era.   What would giving all students such a broad and liberal education in western civilization do? Aside from being intrinsically valuable, liberal education pushes students to think logically and creatively, and gives them the tools to argue effectively. Liberally educated students are better able to synthesize together ideas from history into wholly new ideas and arguments. Also, it's pretty cool to be able to quote St. Thomas Aquinas and Immanuel Kant when talking.   Let's dispense with  Julie of the Wolves  and teach our middle schoolers about the foundations of the western civilization they live in.

      Last year my dad had this huge fan installed in the middle of our house. The idea was that you could turn it on and open up all the windows, and it would draw air out of the house into the attic and presumeably out of the attic windows, sucking outside air into the house to fill the lower pressure in the house caused by the fan. That way, it would be easy to cool the house down after sunset because air would be changed really fast.   I'm happy to report that this fan thing works really well, especially if we put it on "high" mode (why we would use "low" mode is beyond me). I estimate that in 15 minutes we can attain a 95% air change rate--and keep in mind that the fan air suckage is probably of asymptotic nature (original air starts out at 100% and then decreases exponentially toward 0% but never reaches it).  The house I'm living in right now is about 2800 square feet and is roughly square-shaped, so we only need one of these huge fan things. My first old house, on Baleri Ranch Rd., was like 4800 square feet and shaped like a W, so we would probably have needed to have two fans to have the same effect. My other old house, on Forest Rd., was about 1350 square feet, but was two storied and lacked an attic so such a fan would have been impossible. The small size made such a fan unnecessary, however; we just got some window fans, which worked quite well. In any case, I don't think my dad had the idea until last summer (when we first moved into this house), so we wouldn't have tried to install one of these in either house.

      Whenever I see a long post like this, I think, "wow, what a weenie for writing so much, you hypersentimental-overphilosophizing twerp!" I also dislike it when people break into quotations as I just did. Rest assured, this entry talks about cars.                I guess I'm pretty spoiled. I don't do any work around the house (often, I don't even make my bed until I get home from work); I don't really contribute anything to the household; my parents give me a lot of money--$100 a month, plus diesel costs, plus car insurance, plus car repairs, in total probably about $300 a month; and I'm often pretty unrespectful to my parents, to boot. This occured to me a few days ago when I was thinking about getting a MINI Cooper, or rather, accepting one as a gift from my mother. My dad was opposed to it (for non-financial reasons), and by implication said that I was spoiled.  Recognizing that I already have a perfectly functional 1984 Mercedes-Benz 300D Turbo Diesel, I tried to rationalize the purchase of a new MINI Cooper at a total price tag, including tax and all costs, of about $20,500, as follows in no particular order. First, my car lacks air conditioning and a functioning FM radio, and it would be stupid to put said amenities in because doing so would cost more than the value of the car.  Second, my car is somewhat unsafe as it does not have crumpmle zones, ABS, air bags, or traction control. This is something of a moot point because my car weighs like 6000 pounds, is made of steel, and doesn't accelerate very well, so I am unlikely to get into any serious accident, and even if I do I'll probably be doing a lot more damage than I'll be receiving. Third, the aforementioned poor acceleration sometimes makes it difficult for me to get onto freeways &c. I can go from 0 to 60 in about 18 seconds, which is generally sufficient for getting onto 280 but sometimes causes trouble for getting onto 101 when it's somewhat but not tremendously crowded. I don't go on the freeway very often, though. Fourth, my car is prone to breaking in various places as it is over 20 years old. Fifth, my car gets pretty bad gas mileage and does a lot of damage to the environment. It also has never passed a smog check. Sixth, the MINI Cooper has like a million air bags so it's very safe.  Seventh, the MINI Cooper has air conditioning and AM/FM radio and a totally unnecessary CD player. Eighth, the MINI Cooper would be stick shift which would be kind of cool to learn to drive.  Ninth, the MINI Cooper is reasonably environmentally friendly and gets fairly good gas mileage--27/36 or something like that. Tenth (principally a suggestion on my mom's part, though something I had embraced), lots of other high school students have expensive cars like new Solaras, Acuras, and BMWs.  When I talked to my dad about this, I realized how spoiled a brat I can be sometimes. I said, "Is it not unreasonable to want to drive a car that has air conditioning and FM radio?" It sounded reasonable at the time, but now this sentence seems representative of the decadence I live in. In a sample of people my age in the United States, most don't even have their own cars, and I'm whining about not having some unnecessary amenities in mine. I am loath to hold myself to relative standards, however, so I have compiled a fairly compelling argument behind why I should not accept the gift of a MINI Cooper from my mom.  I have already addressed the first point on the above list. The second point rebuts itself. The third point is weak--I can still get on the freeway, only it's a little more difficult. The fourth point is moot as I will be living at home next year, Mercedes-Benz has very good roadside assistance, and my parents are paying for repairs anyway. The fifth point stands but it's absurd to spend $20,500 to save a little money on fuel, and in any case we don't have to pay a fine for failing the smog check because my mom already paid it years ago (a sunk cost).   As for the sixth point, the MINI Cooper has only a very marginal at best safety advantage over my current car. The seventh point I have already addressed--I don't really need air conditioning and FM radio, so such things are unnecessary and actually are signs of decadence. The eighth point is decadence incarnate--"let's spend $20,500 to have fun!"   Regarding the ninth point, I ignore two things. First, it's not economical to spend $20,500 to slightly improve the environment and save a little on fuel; and second, 27/36 is pretty bad gas mileage considering that a new generation of hybrids and similar cars are going to come out in the coming decade.  And the tenth argument is moot on three levels: relativity, necessity, and economy.  On relativity: it is moot based on relative expense to other students at Gunn High School because buying a MINI Cooper would put me in the top 15% or so of students in terms of cost of car, showing how spoiled I am. I don't know any national norms but it's pretty much a given that buying your kid a new car is a sure sign of decadence and spoiled brattiness.  Yes, there are some students who drive new Hondas, new Camry Solaras, even new BMWs at Gunn, but for many of these students these vehicles were necessary first purchases to expand their families' vehicle fleets--their families happened to need another car, so they bought another one and let them drive them. Some of those students probably made a lot of money on their own and bought the cars with theor own money. Others are simply spoiled brats.  But in any situation one individual person or family's decision making process should not be impacted by another's, as the principles behind decision making are universal--that the Jones family purchases lots of unnecessary cars and spoils the kids doesn't somehow legitimize purchasing lots of unnecessary cars and spoiling the kids. On necessity: It is unecessary for me, a 17-year-old, to have a car. I could walk to school every day if really necessary, as I only live about 50 minutes away from school by walking. That I have a car is an incredible blessing and in and of itself perhaps somewhat spoiling, and definitely unhealthy, as I would surely be a lot more healthy if I walked to and from school every day. On economy: It is uneconomical to spend $20,500 buying a new car for a 17-year-old who has no need for a car at all. Very, very few 17-year-olds have contributed $20,500 gross (not even net!) to their families. I definitely haven't. One can do a lot of good with $20,500 by giving a consummate sum to charity. Also, speculation went that if I got a MINI Cooper, we would sell one of the other family cars, meaning that we would actually lose utility in our vehicle fleet as the MINI Cooper is not as good a vehicle for a family.  If I really examine the reasons why I want to accept a gift from my mother of a MINI Cooper, I recognize that my reasons are wholly decadent, unnecessary, and perhaps even representative of a greater fiscal depravity. I principally want a MINI Cooper because the vehicle is glamorous, fun to drive, and generally better than my current car; I am not motivated by any real needs.   Indeed, the reason my mom wants to buy me a MINI Cooper is well-intentioned but misguided: she wants to buy me a MINI Cooper as a reward for my doing well in school and on standardized tests. She sees it as a kind of motivating factor (aside from going to college while conveniently ignoring the fact that whenever I do well she tends to give me money). God has given me a gift of intelligence, and I shouldn't be rewarded for doing well in something that my personal integrity had nothing to do with. Besides, it just sounds spoiled that I'm getting a new car for doing well in school when tens of thousands of other students have done well in school as a matter of expectation. I suppose this is the greatest sign of my decadence; I'm spoiled but I don't want to appear spoiled to others.  I also have an ATM card that can be used as a credit card. Another sure sign of being spoiled is having a credit card-like item.  I also have a cell phone that I don't pay for.

      A big part of my job is to measure sunspots' angular velocities and do write-ups on them. It's very difficult to impossible to have a computer measure a rotating sunspot's angular velocity, so it has to be done by hand. It takes a level of skill to measure sunspots, too. I suppose this is what interns (and, to a lesser extent, research assistants in universities) are for--doing tasks that are important, tedious, and impossible to automate.  I help maintain these web pages:  urlLink rotating sunspots ,   urlLink TRACE/MDI rotating sunspots list , and  urlLink TRACE health monitoring . I also did a  urlLink write-up . The online write-up is not complete, as I'm too lazy to translate the full write up from TeX (a text layout format) into HTML.

      It occured to me the other day that I spend far too much time thinking and too little time doing. I spend so much of my time thinking about morality and evanglism and philosophy, but I spend a much smaller amount of my time actually applying that same morality and philosophy, and spend almost none of my time evangelizing. This also is probably linked to my slurring of speech when talking to other people--because I spend the vast majority of my time thinking about things, I have a lot to say about some things, so I speak very fast. The fast speech compounds my natural speech impediment (I used to stutter, having trouble pronouncing soft 'w' and 'h' sounds such as "why" when I was very young), causing me to slur my words.   I hereby resolve to alter the balance of thinking to doing in favour of doing, and to speak more slowly and crisply.

       Yesterday I went to the maxillofacial surgeon at 8:30 a.m. to get my bottom two wisdom teeth removed--I don't have and never will get any top ones (thank God). They put an IV in my right arm, an oxygen mask over my nose, and the next thing I knew I was lying in the recovery room with some ice packs. I estimate that it took 15 minutes for me to wake up fully from the drug-induced sleep. I didn't ask them for my teeth beforehand, though, so they discarded them; I don't get to keep my teeth. Evidently they came out in pieces, too.    Dr. Anthony Beech, my maxillofacial surgeon, did a pretty good job in my estimation. He even sewed up the holes my wisdom teeth used to be in with some kind of self-dissolving sinew stuff. In general, I haven't experienced any significant discomfort aside from some numbness in my lower jaw yesterday, an aftereffect of one of the drugs used in surgery, and some pain in the back of my mouth where the wisdom teeth used to be.     This relative comfort is at least partly a result of my being all drugged up. They gave me four prescriptions to take and apply after the surgery. Here are the medicines: Vicodin, an oft-abused opiate-based painkiller; Lodine, an anti-inflammatory; Penicillin, a broad-spectrum antibiotic; and a mouth wash, which tastes like Listerine Mint, that I'm supposed to use in lieu of brushing my teeth. I'm not taking the Vicodin because my sister said it made her feel all woozy and half-dead when she took it after getting her teeth removed; instead, I took Advil yesterday and am taking Tylenol today.     I wasn't able to eat much chewable stuff yesterday because I was afraid of chewing myself on accident, though I can pretty much eat anything I want today as long as I'm careful. Mashed potatoes taste pretty good.    It could just be that I got lucky, but getting my wisdom teeth removed wasn't a huge deal. I'm still not going to work tomorrow, though, because Dr. Beech said that I should avoid doing any driving &amp;c. for 72 hours after the surgery.     In any case, I thank God for answering my prayers for a no-complication surgery with relative comfort afterwards.

      Craig and Sharon has been advertising BAAYF, a regional Asian (principally Chinese and Vietnamese) Christian youth camp, at GAVE/LGCC youth meetings. Evidently LGCC helped start BAAYF 10-15 years ago, but pulled out a few years ago over a debate about speaking in tongues, and just re-joined BAAYF this year, making it so that the class of 2005 managed to get through without going to camp. Previous GAVE/LGCC youth "generations" had gone to the camp rather (ahem) religously.  At the leaders meetings Craig and Sharon repeatedly asked us to go, but in general the response was tepid because people had various plans made for the week &c. They asked all GAVE/LGCC youth members to go, and as far as I can tell the response was also lackluster. Furthermore, Craig specifically called me to ask me to go two days ago, and I said I'd ask my boss about it--I didn't really want to go and I had been more or less saying that I couldn't get off of work when I had never broached the topic to my boss, so in a way Craig called my bluff.  Now that my boss has said that I can go, I'm still deeply ambivalent about going. That's a sophisticated way of saying that I don't want to go.  I like making lists so I'll list the reasons I don't want to go. I'll even write little explanations of the reasons.   1. Hatred of nature-- I have an aversion to camp in general. I dislike pretty much everything about going to camp (different from camping, which I also dislike). I dislike bugs, not sleeping in my own bed, having to share a room with other people, having to share a bathroom with other people, not having the freedom to do whatever I want, and not having a telephone or a television. Usually the water at camp isn't as good as the tap water at home.  More importantly, going to camp is a lot of trouble. I dislikepacking up clothes, towels, and toiletries (this is also why I dislike traveling far away on holiday). I dislike organizing rides and having to be courteous to whomever drives me. If I drive myself, I dislike driving far on my own because my car doesn't have air conditioning or FM radio so it gets boring.    2. Sloth-- I desire to stay at home, go to work, and relax. Maybe it's because I'm an aristocratic, elitist city-slicker, but I like being at home. My house is 2800 square feet and I have my own room, so I have a lot of freedom just being at home. I have a Netflix account, so I can watch a DVD-movie pretty much every day. The refrigerator and pantry always have a lot of good food in them, too (thanks mom).  This probably wouldn't be true if I had a real job, but I like working at Lockheed (LMSAL, actually)--measuring sunspots is pretty easy and I share an office with several other people so there's usually an interesting conversation going on.  In general, staying in Los Altos Hills-Palo Alto during the summer is very appealing to me because it's a comfortable existence--a relaxing one, even.   3. Closed-minded obstinance-- I am a reactionary, and am lazy too. I am a fundamentally conservative person. I'm not conservative in the political sense (soon I will be a card-carrying member of both the ACLU and the Sierra Club), but rather am conservative in my resistance to trying new things. In other words, my default response whenever anyone asks me to do something I haven't done before is the negative. I resisted going to summer camp three years ago; I resisted going to winter retreat until last year; I resisted going to youth group for over a year; I resisted going to the newspaper convention; &c. By default, I am resisting going to BAAYF.  I touched on this earlier, but the reason I am conservative in this way is that I am fundamentally lazy--it's a lot of trouble to talk to my boss about going to BAAYF, to tell my parents that I'm going, to pack for BAAYF, to write the ($300) check for the fee, &amp;c. when I can live perfectly comfortably at home.   4. Greed-- Going to BAAYF would cost me $600. They say that BAAYF costs $300, which is true; the fee is about $300 depending on when one registers. But to a contract worker like me who gets paid by the hour and doesn't get any paid vacation or sick leave, the actual cost of going includes missing a week of work, or about $400, so the total cost of BAAYF for me is upwards of $700. It's actually a little less because of tax and donation to LGCC, but the figure is at least $600.   My reasons for not wanting to go to BAAYF could potentially sound really bad--I don't want to go to spiritual growth and wholesome Christian fellowship camp because of hatred of nature, sloth, closed-minded obstinance, and greed, but I still stand by my reasons. I suppose I could attack BAAYF and Christian camps in general by saying that they promote elitism, don't necessarily promote spiritual growth, and focus too much on fun and not enough on God, but I won't because those statements are as much a charicature of BAAYF as saying that my motivations for not wanting to go are fundamentally based on prejudice, vice, and closed-mindedness.

      I've been walking down the dangerous path of treating church as a social club as of late, sometimes going to church and youth group to meet with friends &c. instead of with a real heart and mind for learning and growth. Perhaps it's because I'm beyond the stage when it is easy (I am loath to use the term easy, but bear with me) to learn and grow--I've read pretty much the whole Bible and have what I hope is a fairly good foundation of true faith and beliefs that come with. Also, I've come to know many people at church as pretty close friends. In short, I've reached the stage where it's possible to go to organized worship with socialising instead of learning and growing in mind.     Now, friendships and community are tremendously important, but they should not be the driving force behind a desire to go to service &amp;c.; rather, they should be an outcome of the body of Christ meeting together with the intention of learning and growing together.     From now on I will pray every day that God will move in me a desire to learn and grow more, which I sort of have but also sort have been lacking as of late, and specifically that God will move in me to treat organized worship not as a social club but focus on it with a real mind for learning and growth.

      For a long time I had trouble arguing against "personal responsibility" and "individualism" when it came to social insurance. I could only say that I had a gut feeling that losing big was a lot worse than winning big, that if I had the choice between 1) staying where I (or rather, where my familiy was) was financially or 2) having 50% chance of either trebling my income or halving it, I would choose to stay where I am even though the second choice has a greater expected value. I've found an amazing article that articulates an impressive intellectual and evidence-rich argument for social insurance that is substantially beyond what we have today.   urlLink "False Positive"    by  Jacob S. Hacker, Ph.D.   Some highlights:    Plus, conservative paeans to social mobility miss an even more glaring problem: What goes up also goes down. And, for most Americans, downward mobility is far more painful than upward mobility is pleasurable. In the 1970s, the psychologists Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman gave a name to this bias--"loss aversion." Most people, it turns out, aren't just highly risk-averse--they prefer a bird in the hand to even a very good chance of two in the bush. They are also far more cautious when it comes to bad outcomes than when it comes to good outcomes of exactly the same magnitude. The search for economic security reflects a basic human desire to guard against losing what one already has.  Judged on this basis, what my evidence shows is deeply troubling. When I started out, I expected to see a rise in the instability of family income. But nothing prepared me for the sheer magnitude of the increase. At its peak in the mid-'90s, income instability was almost five times as great as it was in the early '70s, and, although it dropped somewhat during the late '90s (my data end in 1999), it has never fallen below twice its starting level. By comparison, permanent income differences across families have risen by a more modest, if still troubling, 50 percent over the same period.  The full explanation for this dramatic rise in instability is still unclear, but two causes loom large. The first, and most obvious, is changes in the nature of work. In today's postindustrial economy, less skilled workers are much more vulnerable than when unionized, manufacturing labor was more of the norm. (Not surprisingly, instability is greater for families headed by less educated workers, though  it has actually risen more quickly in the last decade for workers who went to college. ) Workplace benefits, such as health insurance and pensions, have been on the chopping block. And corporate America increasingly relies on part-time, contingent, and contract workers--all of whom enjoy precious little security....  Perhaps the most promising idea for creating such a system is a simple proposal I call "universal insurance"--a kind of umbrella insurance policy protecting families against catastrophic drops in income or budget-wrecking expenses. Premiums would be a small share of total income and payouts would be based on the decline of disposable income from its previous base, with the share of income replaced higher for lower-income families.  Universal insurance could, in turn, be coupled with a less regressive and dangerous form of personal accounts than those advocated by Bush. These tax-free accounts would help families manage unavoidable household expenses before they reached catastrophic levels. Each year--and upon the birth of children--the government would contribute small amounts to each account. These public contributions would vary inversely with income, offsetting the regressive distribution of the tax breaks.  Universal insurance would protect Americans before they fell into poverty, lessening the burden on programs for the poor and protecting the dignity of beneficiaries. From the standpoint of income protection, what matters is not whether some are rich and others are poor, but whether all Americans are protected against precipitous drops in their standards of living. Universal insurance would depart from existing social insurance programs in providing general risk protection. Its premise would be that Americans need access to more than existing, highly segmented programs--programs that not only leave glaring gaps, but also lack the ability to respond to a rapidly changing world of risk.   Maybe I'm just another idealistic tax and spend liberal youth who doesn't trust God enough, but I think the United States would be a better place if something like universal insurance with non-regressive personal savings accounts was implemented.

      I frequently use the terms "pretension" and "arrogance" (I'll lay off of the quotation marks from now on; they annoy me) in my posts in a generally self-deprecating sense, so I should probably clarify what I mean when I say pretension and arrogance. Naivete.  To be elaborated on later

      I've been thinking about future careers for some time now, and I see six main professional career paths: business, engineering, education, health sciences, law, and ministry. Currently I do not feel led to pursue full time ministry, so that leaves me five career paths to think about.  I recognize that many very happy and successful people do not work in the field they studied in college, but as a rising high school senior I'm going to ignore this and view my future career in the context of undergraduate college  In this context, I see electrical engineering as a possible undergraduate major for four of the five principal career paths. If I major in electrical engineering I have the potential to go into business/entrepreneurship or even attend business school after working for a few years; I could pursue an engineering/technical/science job; I could teach high school (or college if I get a Ph.D which I don't want to do at the moment); or I could go to law school and become a lawyer of some kind, possibly but not necessarily a patent lawyer. I recognize that it's very difficult to get good grades as an engineering major--not that I scoff at those who get good grades in the social sciences and humanities--but, for the time being, in my pretension I wto assume that I can do well enough to get into a reasonably good law school, teacher college, business school, or get a Ph.D, or get a job in engineering/science after college.  The problem is that none of the aforementioned four career paths is tremendously appealing to me--businessmen are too greedy for me, engineers are tomorrow's textile and steelworkers; teachers get paid almost nothing (I'm shallow) and have to do the same thing over and over again; most lawyers don't contribute anything to society and those who do get paid nothing; and being a professor is incredibly stressful because of the pressure to publish papers. Also, none of the above jobs are very secure.   So then I look toward the health sciences. I see basically three jobs in the health sciences that I would want to have: medical doctor (D.O. or M.D.)--anything but surgeon (I dislike blood) or obstetrician/gynecologist (I'm not a woman and don't like insurance companies); pharmacist; and optometrist. In all three fields, I would be helping other people, would have reasonable job security (just you try to export that yearly checkup to India), and would be making a comfortable, even decadent wage. I am deeply ambivalent about bioengineering and pharmacology because I don't like the idea of personally testing drugs on animals, and it seems like those fields could require frequent 80 hour weeks. I also wouldn't want to be a dentist.  Based on my very limited research in the health professions, I know that schools of medicine, osteopathy, pharmacy, and optometry are unbelieveably hard to get into and require people to take many biology and chemistry classes. From anecdotes, I know that said science classes are highly competitive and that premedical/prepharmaceutical/preoptometric students are notorious for being cutthroat and stressed out. Also from anecdotes, I know that medical/osteopathy school (and probably pharmacy and optometry school) and the few years of residency/intership are unbelieveably hard, depressing, and filled with sleepless nights. My dislike of blood and gore might make medical/osteopathy school in particular very unpleasant for me. However, being a doctor would probably be the most rewarding career among the three health science professions I have enumerated, both monetarily and emotionally, assuming I didn't work in an emergency trauma ward or something like that.   But here's the rub: if I set myself up on the premed/prepharm/preoptometry track and take all those unbelieveably hard science classes, and don't do quite well enough to get into med/pharm/opt school, I end up a teacher. However, I'm not a disgrace to the family because my parents at least pretend not to care about social class and say that whatever I do they're happy (all my non-nuclear family relatives are either estranged or dead so I don't care about them, either).  So here's one potential solution: study electrical engineering in undergrad while doing all the necessary premed/prepharm/preopt classes. This does two things: first, it makes my four years of college a living hell and probably makes it five years of college; second, it makes my grades so bad that I'm unemployable as an engineer, incapable of getting into law, business, or medical school; third, it wastes a lot of college money; and fourth, I end up as a teacher not in the district of my choice (a wealthy one that treats its teachers right like PAUSD, FUHSD, or LAMVHSD), but rather in a bad district (I'm an elitist racist) like Ravenswood, where teachers get threatened at knifepoint. Also, doing this would make it very hard to get a broad liberal education in college, which I see as intrinsically valuable. Of course, this is a cariacature and I'm sure that some people have successfully done premed while majoring in EE, but the worry is still in my mind.  The only way to even try to avoid the aforementioned worst-case scenario if I do choose to do EE with premed is to go to a college with "easy" classes, which means no U.C. Berkeley (in my pretension I assume that I will get into U.C. Berkeley electrical engineering, perhaps the most prestigious and difficult engineering program in the world.)  I pray about this broadly every day--I ask God to show me what to do with my future. I will continue to pray about this, and I have faith that God will guide me, and probably make me a really good solution that I couldn't possibly have thought of before.

        urlLink "Roll Over, Martin Luther"  by David Van Biema  Basically, the article says that for the first time ever in U.S. history, Protestant Christians may soon compose less than 50% of the U.S. population. Between 1993 and 2002, the percentage of Americans that calls itself "Protestant" has declined about 11%.   Historically, about 63% of Americans have been Protestants. The article suggests that the majority of people who have lost their faith have basically become agnostic/atheist/nonreligious.    (This does not mean that the United States will have ceased to be a "Christian nation," however;  Christians--Protestants and Catholics--will still have about a 70% majority in the United States.  I don't really know why Protestant Christianity has lost so many people, and this particular topic seems too narrow for me to write on without doing any real research. What is easier for me to write about is that this ongoing secularization of the modern United States brings us one step closer to post-Christian Western Europe. Basically, I see the United States going down the path of secularization, mixed market economics (some would call this socialism), and greater trust in the federal government as "protector."  Stub for secularization to be filled in later  In spite of all the claims of "fiscal conservatism" flying around in politics today, my country is beginning to show signs of Western European-style mixed-market economics, epitomized by recently (by recently I mean the past few years) enacted prescription drug coverage, and bipartisan calls for universal healthcare. To be elaborated on later  Stub for greater federal power and involvement to be filled in later

       The Economist  argues in  urlLink "Drugs and the Olympics"  that since doping is impossible to keep out of sports, we might as well legalize some kinds of doping. I'm deeply ambivalent about this stance, but I can't really think of a way to address the principal problem of enforcement being impossible so cerebrally I'm somewhat inclined to agree.  It--making certain kinds of performance enhancing drugs legal in sports--just feels wrong though. Gateway drugs, impressionable youth. To be elaborated on later.
