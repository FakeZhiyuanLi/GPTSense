      actually i lied.... today im quite free.... shld i do the stupid jing shen jiang ppt? haiz....  today when i was queueing up by the side of the auditorium i was so nervous to go the stage to recieve the tt prize. it was my first time to get a prize from mr yue and the whole school would be looking at me, so i was so frightened.... u believe me? hehe... im lying.  all those who saw that mr yue was going to give out the prizes, ppl started to say that after shaking his hand muz go and disinfect. my sentiments exactly.  the spotlight today was on ms chan shouting at zixuan. actually i could see she was mad. maybe. she's a deceiver. people just cant look thru her mind. i was quite shocked that she managed to raise her voice and boom the whole class. zi xuan was trying to rebel. no use. ms chan obviously could get the upper hand and roar back at him. it was fun seeing hydrochloric acid put with zinc. she went thru that twelfth nite (or is that how you spell it) so chimly no one could understand. i like her lessons. she's a good teacher. realli.  the ss test today was crap. mind me for saying this, hopes mk does not invade this space. i hate ss tests, but not elit. ss you have to think more. you have to rush like a mad dog. mayber even madder. think about it. for an english paper 1 you have 1.5 hours to complete a compo, a few pages (maybe three). for ss, you have 6 questions to answer, with 1.5 hour. how to complete and get high marks with the answer levels so tough. i bet the teachers cant even attain the levels. todays test was still okay lah, actually. the decontextualised questions were still do-able. think i can get b.  still have some geog stuff to do. muz get b for geog. muz get b for geog. must get b for geog. haiz.................  that's all today.

      周杰伦 - 将军  曲：周杰伦   词：黄俊朗  时间的箭头      都指向你铩羽而归的地方你会前进　 但终究还是要习惯投降想当然耳 第六步是你最大的致命伤     我按兵不动　 出于习惯凡事沈默的酝酿 当头炮纯粹出于我礼貌的开场     屏风马 神华内敛才能以柔克刚 第二十六着炮五进四　  只是在试探性衡量 三十三招车二平七的出手　  你恐怕就暗箭难防  这一场不流血的仗只有自尊会受伤 成王败寇的规则跟现实没啥两样 提着鸟笼的老头站在一旁拍我肩膀 我猜他想的应该和我一样  ＊看我　我手指放松　我目光如龙　当敌人是空　我战法无穷　 我攻势如风　用单车入宫　碾过你懊丧的脸孔　 看我　我手指放松　我目光如龙　当敌人是空　我左右开弓　 我气势如虹　将跑马尽用　兵临城下想逃都没用　  (阳光从树叶细缝露出了笑容　温暖了我的美梦　只有笼里的画眉羡慕着天空　却从来没有人懂)  我对着潮汐推敲什么是     以静制动 山林间迷雾能不能当障眼法的内容 月转星移的轨迹跟临军佈阵相同 风林火山是不是用兵之重     到最后 必然是我运筹帷幄　  你最后放弃抵抗 我仰望着夕阳　你低头黯然离场　 听我说胜败是兵家之常 你不用放在心上　是因为我只适合无双

      wat's up with life..... i dont think im suited for this treatment. the people around me are bullying me that's for sure. eugene is the sissy... not me... i dont go around telling people theyre sway or wo ying ni... wo shu ni.... so wat if i have higher marks, or you have higher marks. whats the point of comparing so much until you dont notice that youre becoming arrogant. i heard frm favourable peeps that you were tough to be a good friend to, youd be boasting and wanting your way. I now know that youre childish. i know its childish to do this, pricking ppls back behind like this, but i find this effective in venting my frustrations against ppl like you.... wat "pal" are you in the first place... i dont see the right in you calling me not being a "pal", for u yrself dont treat me like one. you call me names... shen jing bing( you do that to everyone) and when i act blur whats the point of scolding me and asking me to empty the rubbish bin just for your sake of wanting to throw some minute litter waste into the bin? i dont get money from you as your maid or wateva, and you dont have the right to treat me that way. i noe i seem dumb in not shouting back at you, for i noe that it is pointless doing so... youd just irresponsibly think of some lame stuff and dismiss the argument. so who says i dont treat you like a pal.... think before you speak. is your brain malfunctioning or wat? in the last term, when you said that you were "becoming stupid", did i say hahahahahahhahahahhahahahahhahahahahahhahah...... i doun think so.... think before you speak. when i helped you to print notes for bio did i go around saying you must be super super super super grateful to me?, while when you printed a notes for me you rattled the whole day asking me to do work just because of your "work" magnificently done. think before you speak.... really... when i was sitting on the chair of liling's today was there a need to come and shout some wat the hell malay word and laugh so much on it. I had to act as if i knew its meaning and slap you off like a mosquito. what's the supid point of bullying me like that... only babarians do that... do you feel very happy to see me sad? if you are, welcome to the sadistic club. if you arent, youre just a few stones throw from the club. cant you see other ppl not bullying me? wat's in the word sissy that you find amusing to call me? is it the "si" or the "ssy", let me tel you, the definition of sissy is a person like you, going aroung not caring about ppls thoughts and feelings ( i just used a rubbish term) and just laughing off your chair at peoples misery. it's not only me youre doing this too, poor verena is also shot by him many times for saying that her voice is like a mosquito( she does not). whats the point (i noe my vocab is limited) when you just voice out at teachers shouting out vulgars? to MK( our beloved form) and ms soh? is it cool? is it fun? you never learn from experiences. that day ms wong had already caught you and you could still laugh about it. there is no sense of guilt and shame in you... you are a shameful little brat. only always wanting to win( hey theres no such thing as a smooth road with setbacks). You cant win all the time. dont think you win once or twice then zhan zhan zi xi... you dont tell yourself to work hard or comfort ppl ... wat kind of sickening attitude is this? is going to the bb court more often makes you a man? wat are you? trying to boast that you have completed your work and have a lot of time to go play bb and so you can luagh over me and my sorrowful misery? o... i forgot... ppl like you have the most free time to sleep at ten and be hao lian over it... saying you have learnt this topic and this topic... and they are all VERY EASY.... i mean, how can a person say that. other ppl have not learnt this yet but why must you give "VERY EASY" comments about it. So wat if you think your popularity has risen or decreased? are you like trying to compete with me whos more popular also? wat the hell.... i just have to hand it to you... being able to stay hao lian for such a long time. Wait till one day you cant survive... let's see you fall...
