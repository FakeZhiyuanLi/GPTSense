      My lifes principles are live life to the fullest and stay away from babies with knifes (i dont no how thats a principle) I basically am a skater punk and you will find me either listening to alern. rock / punk music, spending time with that weirdo :) Carlos or maybe even rescuing doomed men in hotdog suits. Anywayz apart from that Im a punker/grunger WHATEVER, i breath, eat, sleep punks (i eat blink 182 cds) and me and carlos are pretty much the only punks in our school since everyone likes hiphop but F**K them. IM so hyper and u wouldnt wont to spend a week with me :) carlos is just crazy and/or unique :P PLEASE comment if ur a punk i wanna communicate with u guys

      OK, me and my best m8 carlos made this up since on the deepend of his pool (its an appartament pool) theres a massive shadow but nothing seems to b casting it. So we made up a story:  There was once a girl called Anna who loved swimming, she was the champion at her school and was soon to go into the Florida youth championships. She was very strong and had an olympic carreer infront of her but one day a tragedy happened. She was swimming in her community pool one day, supervised. It was a very busy day so she had absolutely no worries and she as a very safe girl. She ran over to the deepend of the pool infront of which lay a massive plam tree which cast a shadow throughout the whole deep part of the pool. No kid dared to enter it on fear of being eaten by crazy made up monsters but Anna wasnt like that. She soared through the air qas a start of an elegant dive. and glided through the water with no splash, like a beautiful penguin or seal. Anna shut her eyes not realising that the end of the pool was nearing her elegant face. With a silent crack of bones blood clouded across the deep end of the pool but was only absorbed by the shadow making it even less opaque. Nobody could see her unconcious body. A week later her parents called everyone suspicious of what had happened, the last anyone had heard she had been swimming at the public pool. So the parents searched the pool and the whole area, only to find her bracelet in the deep end of the pool. Years later the tree started to take a strange form, just like the beautiful face of Anna. But winter came and it died, one thing did not die though. The shadow of the grand tree was stuck there to warn other children of the dangers, however Annas warnings were rather vengeful, 27 kids went missing that year and the shadownn got larger. The pool was eventually closed only to be opened 20 years later in 2004...  i made nearly all of this up right now on the spot, the story though of a girl dying there was made up by me and carlos   N-joy.

      Alrite this was after the beach party ben stayed over twice and then again but the best time i had was with my best friend Carlos, i was already tired from 2 nites not sleeping and ive been destroying myself by going to bed at around 4 nearly every nite of the summer holidays (its 3am rite now) so i had a few cokes and red bulls and i was off to carloss house. So we walked to the video shops, avoiding the jitanos (or Chavs, Muggers, Gangstas or whatever) and got a video while disgusing girls and getting hyped up on pepsi, we went back found the games were crap so we went to swim. We got freaked out by makin up this story that a girl died down in the deep end by the pool (i put the story in a different blog), then after that at night we were bored out of our midns so we decided to take stupid pictures of ourselves, being cool and looking stupid at the same time...heres some pics.    i modified that one on my computer making my hair look absolutely stupid. Thats it.

       This was actually a few days ago but im gonna post it now since it was the most exciting thing to happen to me this week and its something i would like to start my blog off, alrite so i went to the beach with my sister and her friend and my friend Ben not sure if that worked and we were smashin up barnicles and i cut my finger really deep and it wouldnt stop bleeding so the best thing i could think of doing was makin them tribal marks on my face so i did. Me and my friend ditched my sister and her friend to get a pizza and go to the video arcade and we had just enough time to come back to watch the hot dancers :P  and that was my day at the beach
