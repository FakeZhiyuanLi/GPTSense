      With the summer of Satan (2002) and the Catastrophically Fantastic Summer (2003) safely behind us, we now move in to the yet to be named Summer of 2004. I think it would only be appropriate to begin the summer by requesting submissions from all of you so we can identify a name that best represents the debauchery that this summer will bring.  As you can see, I am finally making good on my promise that I made in 2002 to get us a web page that can document all of the ridiculous things that we do.... So here it is... Enjoy!

      This post was submitted by Brent Fehnel (That's Butchie's real name for those of you who don't know) and captures the status that we are striving to attain in the summer of 2004:  "In 1972 a crack commando unit was sent to prison by a military court for a crime they didn't commit.  These men promptly escaped from a maximum-security stockade to the Los Angeles underground.  Today, still wanted by the government, they survive as soldiers of fortune.  If you have a problem, if no one else can help, and if you can find them, maybe you can hire the A-Team."

      This is a travesty, a sham, a mockery... Dare I say that it is a traveshamockery! We were promised by a certain local radio station that the glorious footwork of our own Chris Jones, better known as Jonesy, would be posted on their website and broadcast into the homes of billions of people to share the Kodak moment(s) that we enjoyed after an early afternoon imbibing session at the wonder that is the Ocean Drive's "No Shower Happy Hour." This display brought joy to the faces of all within eyesight (and was sure to do the same to those who could view it on the internet); however, much to my dismay, I discovered yesterday afternoon that this award winning footage was not posted on the website along with the other footage that was taken from the Ocean Drive on that day. Yes, Jonesy may have been using some language that could have made the burliest of truck drivers whimper in fear, and he (along with several others around him) had so much alcohol in his system that passing birds and small children were at risk from the fumes alone, but a promise is a promise... And these bastards promised that we would see Jonesy displayed prominently on their website! Jonesy put a lot of blood, sweat and tears into his performance (actually it was mostly just sweat) and even went as far as to ruin a good pair of socks by doing the moonwalk on the cement without his shoes. For that Jonesy, I applaud you... And will surely find a way to get you on our website!
