      Do you have time to kill?   urlLink http://www.ebaumsworld.com/castle.html   Courtesy of an online friend named Alucard.  My one and only score is stage 13.  It's pretty monotnous, it's really a test of your threshold of pain as your wrist does get quite sore :)  Good Luck.

      Was fun spent the time playing my game ToS and hung out with my girlfriend.  Went to get some donuts at Tim Horton's.  Saw my buddy Mike too.  Was suppose to go play Volleyball but we got rained out so we will maybe postpone it but since next week we are all going to a friend's wedding that might not happen.  Yea that's about it.

      Today I went to the local amusement park, called "Playland".  For today was the grand prize for the females who had won the contest, "Battle of the Sexes" on the local pop-radio station.  All females from the lower mainland were allowed in free at the amusement and were allowed to ride all the rides or the majority of the rides for free.  Myself being a male had to pay but my girlfriend and I split the costs which was nice for me :)  Overall it was a good day and lots of fun.  I had not been on a roller coaster ride in ages and it felt good to go on a few today.

      So I recently went to the local T&T and went to the bun section with my gal Eves.  The strangest thing happens, a mom walks in with her two kids and they start chanting "My bao bao".  Eves tells me it means "buy buns buns" so I'm like wow cool!  So I joined in the chant and started saying "My bao bao".  I think that's something to write about.  It's pretty cool.  Hope you enjoyed it as much as I did.

      K so like i'm thinking....and I think that this is gonna be pretty dumb.  So I was thinking that I should like dress this thing up and make it all snazzy and sh*t but now that I think about it a bit longer and contemplate on the amount of work involved in gathering the resources and energy to actually do it and the real payoff...  I don't think so.  So yea this is it and this is what it will look like.  laters
