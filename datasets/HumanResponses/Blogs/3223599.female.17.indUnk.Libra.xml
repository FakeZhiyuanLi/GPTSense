      Weeellllll I just got back from Survivor.  So freakin awesome. Seriously.  I'm so tired.  Stayed at Merediths friday night...definitely went to bed at 3. Got up at 6 something. It was at Camp Edgewood.  Did all the challenges. Rentrop was my partner lol.  Swam in the lake, defeated the wasps.  So much stuff. It was just...awesome. It's bad when it takes a trip like that to make you think, but awesome when you actually do think. They got us up at 5 to do the obstacle course, I'm tired.  Gonna go wash the lake water out of my hair..then sleep. So awesome...lol.

Everyday up @ 5 for PT. Wednesday was Sea Trials. We ran 11 miles total. I stopped counting pushups at 400. How I did it, I'll never know. It was pretty awesome though. I dunno if I'm still gonna apply tho.  Umm..last night we went to Kelli's.  Found out some stuff. Got real mad. Now I'm here.

       ya know, today was a good day.   i didn't worry that much.   i didn't think about...everything.      i got up and lauren and me went to school.   then we went to La Fitness.   and then we went and saw mike and picked out   plants for our future apartment.   ummm then we went to tiffs.   but tiff was working.   so we were bored.   and we put about 500 pink post it notes on her walls.   with junk written on them.   and blew up balloons.   and kate made animals with them.   and bought her a tiffany barbie.   and then came home.   and my dog tried to molest me.   sooo me and lauren watched starsky and hutch.   then we made dances.   for songs.    that was the greatest.   and i sang to my brother.   um um um.   it was a good day.   and we wanna go play softball tomorrow.   dunno y.   we just do, yo.   so yeah that was my day.         we had drama yesterday.   it came out good though.   no promises or plans or crap that i always do.   just realization and fear of loss.   and i really cant lose another good friend.   it'll work out.         and btw...   i  do  realize what it does.    i've seen it happen.   and it does make you lose friends..   friends that you  do  want.    good  friends.   and that really sucks.   and i dont want it to happen again.   and i  do  wish it never happened at all.   but it did and i'm sorry.   i guess all i can do is try to prevent it from happenin again.   and i  am .    i just wish i did a long time ago.
