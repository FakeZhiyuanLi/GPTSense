      I just revamped the  urlLink  website.  It's basically a whole new thing to accomodate having a blog now.  It's been very quiet there lately, but I'm hoping maybe some traffic will pick up.    Just received a bunch of CDs from the Bhaktivedanta Ashram in Orissa.  They were on sale so I got a bunch.  :)  I like to listen to bhajans especially in the car.  Today I am going to try and practice some on the harmonium and see if I can make sense of it.

      This morning we're going to the beach.  I always feel inspired there, so I am hoping to chant a few rounds.   Sometimes my husband is in very much of a rush!  I like to stay there, as long as it isn't so hot.    Yesterday I received a   harmonium   that I had ordered.  I am SO excited about it.  Now all I have to do is learn to play it..... although I feel like with our background in music it shouldn't be all that difficult.  I always only could play the piano with one hand anyway.  So hopefully I will be playing bhajans by the end of next week :)  I have never blogged before but it seems to be a good idea for keeping the website updated more than once a month.  There is a lot I don't know about it, but I am hoping to find out if I can add pictures and stuff like I already have, or what I need to do to link and so on.  I am looking forward to this and hoping it will save me a lot of time, because time is going to be short over the next few months while I am in school.

      I can't believe how long it's been since I've posted.  We are doing major redec/redo work on most of our house, so that's taken up a chunk of time and energy.  Also, the annual survey finally arrived.  After three very long, very stressful days we were found to have  no deficiencies.   This is really excellent and doesn't happen often.  The day the survey left, I ended up having to work 11-7 because a nurse called out, and I was up for something like 35 hours straight before I finally got to sleep.  So anyway, it's been a bit rough, but I'm hoping to get things back on track around here with routine postings again.

      So today we go out at lunchtime, and here we are in the parking lot, and Anne says, out of absolutely  nowhere .. "Oh Gauranga!"  Well, I nearly hit the car next to us.  I said, "GAURANGA?!" and there was a girl wearing a shirt that said.. "DON'T BE SAD, CHANT GAURANGA AND BE HAPPY".  So needless to say I went off chasing her across the parking lot.  I had a good discussion with her and her friends, who are all recent highschool graduates, and gave them all my card.  They aren't devotees-she had been in Scotland and heard the band Gauranga, which as far as I'm concerned is close enough :)  So perhaps this is a beginning.    JAI GURUDEVA!

      Still not feeling well.  It's getting old.  There are a lot of projects and things going on right now (including keeping the blog updated!) I am almost at the point where I might consider myself to possibly be overextended.  But I will try to keep on going.  Maybe I need a better schedule to manage my time.  I listed all my current projects this morning-there are about 15 of them!

      I am still not feeling very well.  I am pretty drug out.  Yesterday we had a fire at work (a real one) up in the ductwork.  This is the second one in the past two weeks, for the same cause-the belts that turn the fans up in the ventilation passages.  During that hysteria, the state arrived, so you can imagine how drug out I actually am.  This isn't the whole annual survey team, just one person, so we can continue to look forward to the special joy of having the whole team show up.  Today is Nirjala Ekadasi.  Today we fast from everything-food and water both.   It is a very difficult Ekadasi to observe, but I am going to try very hard to do it.  Last  year I got sick from not drinking any water.  I am going to try hard and see how far I can get through the day.  Not feeling well to begin with isn't going to help this at all, but I will see what I can do.  Got a letter from Gurudeva yesterday!  He likes the idea of a nursing home very much, so I have to get back onto that project as well.  How many projects do I have going right now??!

      I am not feeling very well today so I haven't done much.    One of the things I do to help promote some interest in a group here in Wilmington is distribute flyers.  I printed them up myself and had copies made, and at night, when I go out for japa walks, I distribute them in mailboxes.  It's a numbers game, really-all marketing is, so if I get one or two website hits out of it, I feel like I'm doing well.  Spoke to Rangadevi at New Goloka about the webcam idea.  I need to contact another devotee up there to talk about it, and see how much it will all cost.  It will really depend on what kind of setup they want.  I could buy a whole wireless cam setup for about $120 complete, with two cameras, but if they want one really nice cam, it will cost a lot more, and I won't be able to afford the whole thing.  We will have to see.  I've started doing some reading for school, but being as uncomfortable as I am today, I can't really concentrate, and so a lot of it is just not sinking in.  I am hoping to feel better tomorrow.  I   have  to go to work, so all I can hope is that I feel decent.  Today it feels like I have a bowling ball rolling around in my gut.  This hasn't happened in a long time, to be honest, and really I ought to be glad, but at the same time, it's miserable.  It's been raining off and on, and the humidity is about 180% even when the rain stops (actual humidity 83%-air temp 73F, heat index 84F) so it's miserable outside too.  All you can really do is stay inside and read and chant.  This weekend they are playing nonstop Bugs Bunny cartoons on Boomerang, but we only have one TV and Scott gets tired of that PDQ.  So I am reading and chanting and intermittently dozing between doses of Motrin.  I hope I feel better soon.

      So, I'm still awake... I went to Walmart after leaving work at 4:30 and spent some time there just wandering about.  I bought some floor pillows for in front of the altar and a nice round pan/tray to bathe the Deities in, and some picture frames for pictures of Srila Prabhupada that I've recently purchased, and a bunch of other miscellaneous stuff.  I thought about going to the beach to walk and watch the sunrise, but the humidity is like 99.5% and it's very sticky outside.  I don't feel as bad as I  should  having gone all this time with no sleep, but I am sure that at some future moment forthcoming I will just crash.    I have really been enjoying the  urlLink live audio/video from ISKCON Los Angeles.   In fact, I've been enjoying it so much that I would like to set up something similar at New Goloka.  Simpler, at least to start-streaming audio would make it more complicated, so I'm thinking maybe two wireless cameras and a receiver.  I wrote a letter to one of the devotees there to just see if it might be feasible.  I get such seperation from Radha Golokananda.  The LA temple seems very opulent and beautiful, but I really like the intimacy and sweetness of New Goloka.  I don't think I could ever really be as happy anywhere else.  I hope that when the new temple is built, even though it will be bigger, it retains that sense of closeness and personal attention.  I'm sure it's really nice to have a big opulent place-the gift shop in LA looks enormous itself!-but for me, I think I prefer something smaller.    So hopefully my book will arrive for school today and I will finally be able to get started.  I am so ready to get on it and get over it and get along with it.  My goal date is still September 30.. for now..

      Work is going to be rough this week.  I have to go in tonight and also sometime over the weekend.  We expect the state this coming week, so I don't anticipate getting any time off, and also working an enormous amount of hours.  Tuesday is Nirjala Ekadasi-total fast, even from water.  That will be a very big austerity with all the stress and pressure.  I am going to have to work very hard to keep focused on chanting and hearing, and make sure I have at least some time to either read or listen to a lecture every single day.  These are the special problems of being a householder-having to maintain a job and basically keep one foot in the material world to some degree while remaining focused on the spiritual.  Some days are harder than others, but every day is a motivator to get through school, and get into working from home.  It isn't that I don't like my job or the people I work with-I do-it's that I want to be home, in a controlled environment where I can regulate my time and ensure that I have time, energy, and interruption-free periods for worship.  I also think working from home will please my husband in that it will make it easier on me to keep up with housework and wifely things.  I am just hoping that it comes together financially to make it possible.

      I woke up very disoriented today.  Last night I was looking at some old pictures of Manhattan on the web, and reading about abandoned subway stations, etc., and then I had some very vivid dreams, mostly about work.  So when I woke up, I wasn't (and still am not) quite sure what was a dream and what was real.  It's a  very  unsettling feeling.  Today will also be busy as far as work is concerned.  The last I checked on my book for  urlLink school  it was in Greensboro.  I am going to check again before I go to work, but I am definitely hoping it arrives today.    I am still listening regularly to Srila Prabhupada's lectures on mp3.  It is great to have all these lectures available.  On each disc there are hours and hours' worth.  It's definitely a great system, but I need to get an adapter for my MP3 player!  I am going through batteries like nobody's business.

      I am draggy today.  I just feel like I need a day off.  There is a lot going on at work and I don't like the utter lack of regulation in my life.  This is all motivation for school.... I am hoping my book arrives today.  The goal is to be at a point where I can be established in my own business by the end of the year.  I am going to have  urlLink a devotee i know  design a professional website for me, and order some business cards, and get to marketing right away so that things can build up.  I am not hoping for miracles or millions-if I could match what I am making now, that would be fabulous.  I just want to be at home, and be very regulated in both my sadhana and my chores and so on.  I think Scott would appreciate it as well, and we would have more freedom to do things that we wanted to do.  He is also talking about starting up a side business building furniture, so the next year may be quite busy in this respect.

      Today I watched  urlLink mangal aroti in LA by webcam .  It's really cool because they also have audio and you can switch around on the cameras and zoom in and stuff.  It was sooo neat.  Especially for me, because I don't have any experience of any other temple besides New Goloka, and in different places, things are a little different.  Like, all the songs are the same, and the basics are the same, but every place is individual, with its own mood and traditions.  So I am getting ready to watch the evening aroti as well in a bit.  The nice thing is that since it's west coast, mangal aroti is at 7:30 am.  I wish I had the resources to set up a system like this in Hillsborough!  Mangal aroti is my very favourite program of the day.  The Deities are so sweet in their pajamas and the mood is so intimate and special.  Of course, New Goloka is very small compared to the LA temple, and I think that contributes to the sense of intimacy.  But it is always so beautiful with just the altar lights on, and if I could spend one hour only at the temple every day, that would be it.  Having DSL has also made listening to web radio lots easier.  The quality of the broadcast coming over is a million times magnified and the video streams really, really well.  For this reason alone, especially if someone lives far from a temple, I would definitely recommend switching over to DSL from dialup.  Also, the connection never dumps you!  Pretty soon I will figure out more about how to play with the templates here.  This page is pretty darn boring looking.  I don't have money to dump into upgrading my account, so there are limitations to what I can do, but perhaps I can figure out a way to make it look a little better.  Hare Krishna!!!

      Haribol.  It's raining again, with thunder and lightning.  I am tired.  Tomorrow we are expecting consultants at work, so I am not really thrilled about that.  With the way things are going, the state will be in next week, and Anne and I will have our trip cancelled.  Beyond that, I've been listening to Srila Prabhupada's lectures every day.  I got the MP3 set and I really like them a lot.  Some of the files are not as good quality, but I think it's mostly just a reflection of how they were taped.  I also have some japa CDs and stuff, but I find that I get very distracted by it.  I like to listen to Srila Prabhupada chant japa, but I can't seem to chant along-I just get confused and lose my place.  Is that weird?  I don't like to chant japa in a room full of other people chanting, either.  I like to have quiet, so that I can really hear and concentrate.

      We had hail and some severe thunderstorms last night, but today it's sunny and cool.  In fact, it is still a bit too cool and breezy for me to sit outside.  Later on today I am planning on taking a japa walk.  In the meantime I would like to get a bit of work done on my Bhagavad-gita assignment (which has been taking me forever due to my stubborn procrastination and intractable laziness) so I can get that sent off.  I wish I was going up to Hillsborough today, but I think that will have to wait a couple of weeks yet.  On the 13th Anne and I are going to Charleston, just for an overnight visit.  The following weekend I am on call, so I can't go that weekend, and so it looks like I will be going up the last weekend in June.  It will be wonderful as always to be back up there, especially because I am absolutely sure that between now and then the state will be in the building (at work) for the annual survey.  That is always an extremely stressful time (especially because I got personally nailed last year on something I hadn't done) but I am hoping that it goes well this year, at least for me.  Isn't that awfully selfish?!

      I didn't get the job.  On a super bright note-one of the girls who called for the ad, called me back!  She asked a lot of very intelligent questions about the philosophy and different points and issues.  It was a real challenge for me-I so rarely get asked these things and I am sometimes not really very articulate at putting together my answers!  I was praying for mercy and to just let the Lord speak through me.  She did say she would like to visit the temple so we made a date of it-a week from tomorrow we will go to Hillsborough!  I am SO excited I just can't stand it.  :)  I would really love to be able to write finally to Gurudeva that a real home programme has been scheduled for here in Wilmington, the very first ever.  So I'm really glad and I am looking forward to it.  Perhaps there will be some other calls this week!

      So Anne and I had to go to Raleigh for a meeting and after the meeting we went to Hillsborough!  Mother Cintamani was kind enough to allow us to have a special darshan of Their Lordships and gave us some prasadam.  I was ecstatic to get Anne to the temple finally after two years!!  I think she enjoyed it and she gave a donation.  She also seemed very attached to Srila Prabhupada, and looked very carefully at all the paintings and pictures in the temple room.  Afterwards we had a pretty amazing time going through all the devotees' names of who we saw while we were up there.  I am just so inspired.  Jai Srila Gurudeva!

      I wish that we could live in a devotee community and near the temple.  But maybe this is Krsna's special project for us.  I say us even though Scott isn't a devotee (yet)- we still do things together.  So maybe this is a task for us- to develop a community here.  Krsna knows everything, and everything works out as it ought.  So how can anything be bad?  We have so much karma, so much punishment we deserve for all the evil, sinful things we've done-and of this, we only get a token.  If we are honest with ourselves we admit we deserve so much more.  So maybe it's just a matter of perception-a matter of learning how to see.  For example, sometimes I feel bad because we don't have children, and I ask myself why, and get all upset and think about what evil karma I must have in my past that we don't have children now.  Then, sometimes, I think, well, maybe it's a blessing.  Maybe Krsna is actually rewarding us by not giving us all that worry, and expense, and anxiety.  Instead, we have more opportunity to focus on Him, and more time to devote to Him.  So really, it's a blessing, isn't it?  It all seems to be how I decide to look at it-from a selfish, me-centered, whiny viewpoint, or from a bigger viewpoint that goes outside what I might personally think I want to look at other possibilities.  So maybe this is really a great task and a great, wonderful opportunity.  Here's the chance for me to tell other people about Krsna, in a place where literally nobody is a devotee.  How fantastic it is to perhaps be the very first person to tell someone about Krsna Consciousness, and to share Srila Prabhupada's books!  What an amazing opportunity!  To bring someone to Krsna Consciousness is the greatest thing you could possibly do for them, in this lifetime or any other.  People go hundreds and thousands of lifetimes before they might get the opportunity to hear about Krsna's pastimes-and then the actual chance to perform some devotional service as well!  It is really a rare gift, isn't it?  So I think maybe it's all about how to look at situations.  If I can think about things positively instead of selfishly and negatively, everything changes.    I have that job interview tomorrow.  I am excited and nervous both about it.  I hope it goes well.

      Got another call today from someone who's read the ad and is interested!  This is so encouraging and wonderful to me.  Gurudev's mercy is showering down.  I am excited about the opportunity to send out some books.  I am also sending out information about the group, and I hope to call everyone in a week or two to follow up and maybe we can manage to get together somewhere to meet even before the house is done.  I am so grateful for the opportunity and I just hope that I don't mess anything up.

      Today I had another job interview and I have one on Tuesday as well for a job I am very interested in.  I am sending out two copies of The Higher Taste to people who've responded to my ad in the Ad-pak.  In about a week or so I'll follow up.  I am so hopeful that perhaps this may be the break I've been praying for, and that there will be enough interest to have a meeting and actually begin the group after all this time.  Jai Srila Gurudev!!  If I can just please you I know everything else will come.

      I spoke today with a girl who is very eager to talk and even meet to talk about vegetarianism.  Unfortunately we didn't get to talk very long since I was at work, but I will be sending her out a copy of the Higher Taste, and hopefully she will be interested enough in the philosophy as well as the diet to still want to come meet.  Lord Nrsimhadeva is so merciful.  To demons, He is just like death personified, and He puts fear into their hearts.  But to devotees, He is kind and merciful and showers us with blessings.  He is easily able to rip up the demons in our hearts and bring us to His lotus feet.  I can't even begin to find words to really express how I feel.  For so long I've hoped for some people to become interested in Krishna Consciousness here in town.  Even if this girl is not really interested in philosophy, if she reads even a little bit, her life will be perfect.  So there's no loss.  I am happy to even distribute one book.  Jai Sri Nrsimhadev!  Jai Gurudeva!  Jai Sri Krsna Caitanya!  I was offered a job today that I initially turned down, but I may call him back the first of next week to talk some more about it.

      Today didn't begin very well, but I sure am feeling inspired this afternoon!    To begin with, I've been looking for a new job.  This is not the place I really want to talk about mundane things, but it does add to my general anxiety level, so I'm mentioning it.  As a result, I didn't sleep very well last night.  Well, I had forgotten, but I put an ad in the Adpak (local classified paper) about the Discussion Group, talking about distributing free cookbooks.  I got two calls!  I'm very excited about that and will be sending them out as soon as possible along with some information.  I am hopeful that maybe someone will take some further interest and decide to come and meet!  It is all by Krishna's mercy and through Gurudeva's blessings.  When we feel most fallen something happens to give us a drop of hope and we can carry on.  JAI GURUDEVA!!! JAI SRILA PRABHUPADA!!!  Also, I have two job interviews lined up for this week and tomorrow I need to call to make an appointment for a third.  I don't know that I'll be making any decisions this week but in this economy it sure does feel good to at least be getting interviews.  Feels like my cell phone has been going off all day!  But most of all I am excited to get some response about book distribution and hope that people take some further interest.  It would be the best thing I can think of to have a devotee group here and to be able to take association on a more regular basis and face to face!

      No ranting today.  Promise.  I feel very strongly the seperation from the devotees and the Deities in Hillsborough.  I often think to myself that my life would be so much better and happier if we lived there.  But there must be a reason for us to be here.  Krsna doesn't make mistakes.  So I will try and carry on, and hope that I can bring myself to a point of being qualified to live in the association of devotees.  Because of all the work we've been doing in remodeling the house, I haven't been up to Hillsborough in over a month.  Hopefully soon I will be able to get up there, and if all goes well, Jagannath prabhu will be setting up a web-cam system like they have in LA, and I'll be able to see the Deities every morning.  That will be wonderful.  Eventually maybe we can get an audio system as well, and I'll be able to hear lectures and everything even when I'm not able to be there.    I often wonder at the mercy I've received.  I've done so many things in my life I am not proud of, and made so many mistakes, and still continue to make mistakes every  day out of my foolish ignorance and pride, and yet I've been given this chance to take a step towards coming to Krsna and Radharani's lotus feet.  It's amazing to me-I have this sense of being so utterly unqualified.  I don't want to question it, but it seems almost unbelievable at times.  How on earth did this happen?  So I want to try hard to somehow work towards being a little bit worthy.  If I can just get one drop of taste for chanting, this whole lifetime will be perfect-so I am praying for blessings and the mercy to keep going, even though sometimes I feel so alone and far away.  Srila Prabhupada and Gurudeva are always watching and caring for all of us, and with their blessings, everything will fall into place.

      Please don't think I feel like women ought to be barefoot and pregnant, or abused by their husbands, or kept ignorant and illiterate.  I don't feel that way.  But I do think there is a natural order of things, and that we spend an awful lot of time turning the system upside down and suffering from the consequences of it.  If we could just return our focus a bit more, lose some of this pride, stop trying to be men-I think we would do better.  This doesn't mean a woman can't ever work-lots of women have to work in order to eat.  I work.  But it means that we should know what our priorities are.  Lots of people think Srila Prabhupada was sexist or whatever because of things he said.  On the surface, it might look that way-but we have to look past the superficial, into the actual meaning.  There are real physical and biological differences between men and women that prove that we are designed differently for different functions and roles.  Women are hardwired emotionally in a different way than men are, and men see and process things differently.  Why is it so bad?  Why do we want so badly to be what we aren't?  Why do we buck at the thought of being less than entirely self-sufficient and independent and 'not having a man tell us what to do'?  Is it just a female way of expressing this envy of Krishna, this desire to be God?  I can't think of anything I'd rather do than stay at home, and cook meals, and clean, and make sure the house was a little bit of Vaikuntha on earth for my husband.  I've spent time out (weeks) sick from work, and once I got to a point where I could function, I really enjoyed being at home and doing things for him.  I liked having supper ready the minute he got home.  I took pride in keeping the house neat and clean, rather than doing a slip job because I was busy working 50 hours a week.  I got satisfaction out of seeing him happy and contented with the way things were.  It was really good.  I didn't turn into a vegetable or a robot or lose any IQ points.  I spent time reading and studying as well as doing things around the house.  I baked bread and planned nice meals every day, instead of once a week on a Friday or Saturday.  I really felt good about who I was, as a woman and a wife.  Why have we poisoned our minds against this?    This is a large part of why I want to start my own business.  I really want to work from home.  I feel like if I work from home, I will be able to do all those home-focused things like clean and cook.  I want to be here when my husband gets home.  I want him to be proud of the house, and proud of his wife who takes care of it.  I feel like if I can work at home, these things will go easier.    I make close to twice what Scott does.  He doesn't mind and he isn't threatened by it, which a lot of men are.  He's pretty liberal and enlightened in that way.  On the other hand, I don't throw it in his face or minimise what he does.  My goal in working has always been to just make money we've needed and to take some of the pressure off him.  I guess some women tend to throw it in their husbands' faces.  I think that's a really bad move.  It just creates more tension and disruption, and again, reverses the natural order of things.  Sure, I make more than he does, but I'm not out there bragging on it or using it to make him feel like less of a man.  I spend time listening to him, asking him questions, and trying to enhance his sense of self-worth, not tear it down over something as stupid and material as money.  Am I bragging? No.  I'm just whining, I guess, and trying to understand.

      If most women understood their position, they'd be so much happier.  I am currently in a situation where I am preparing to leave my job.  For lots of reasons, but one thing that stands out to me is the number of women I work with who are unhappy in their marriages.  Because of this, they tend to put in lots of hours-they don't want to go home.  Everything suffers because of this.  Krishna consciousness is so nice.  Everything comes together automatically and becomes right.  Feminism is not the wonderful great thing most people think it is and propagandise that it is.  A woman should look at her husband as her guru, and understand how the pieces of the puzzle fit together.  My husband is not a devotee.  Still I look to him for guidance and leadership.  That's his role.  We don't have children, so me working is not the issue it would be if we had children-still, I try to understand what my proper role is in the marriage and strive towards it.  I am not perfect by any means, but I do try.  And this feminist mentality is so pervasive that women themselves will put you down for keeping your husband and your home life as your first priority.  Many women will say that their children are the first priority and that's good-but what about the husband?  Too many women don't trust their husbands or look to them to lead and to guide.  Perhaps the husband is not fit to lead or guide-or perhaps he just hasn't got any confidence.  My husband is very supportive of me even when he is advising me against something.  I try and be as supportive of him, even though sometimes my fears get in the way when he talks about taking risks or making changes.  I try to invest in him-in building him up, in letting him know I think he is absolutely fantastic and the smartest, most brilliant, handsomest man there is, full of all good qualities.  He isn't perfect either-but I still think he's absolutely fantastic.  I think more women should spend some time doing this, and I think they'd see some improvement in the state of their marriages.  It seems to me like a lot of marriages have trouble because the women think they are the men, and try and rule things.  That just can't work.  This doesn't mean that the men are not to blame-they need to step up and be responsible and be that leader they are supposed to be-a qualified one, not some alcohol-drinking, drug-taking, irresponsible unemployed person.  They should work just as hard to be what they should-providers, leaders, guiders.  I think if people could work on this there would be a lot less difficulty in marriage.  Krishna consciousness provides for all this.  It's a system that covers everything, all in itself.  That's why it's perfect.  We may not be, but Krishna is, and He's the goal.

      Uh... in all the excitement, I forgot.. we did go get Scott's truck the other day.  He's really happy with it and we are actually taking it to New York tonight.  Originally we were going to leave right about now, but we are both tired (it's been a pretty emotional day for me, and he was out on an install) so we are going to leave around 3AM hopefully after we get some sleep.  Anne's staying in the house for us, so we are just hoping that Fabian goes elsewhere and nothing else happens til we get back.

       I GOT THE JOB!  I was offered the position of Geriatrics Night Shift Coordinator.  This position turns out to be salaried and is forty hours instead of thirty six (three twelves and a four, weirdly enough).  It is a  substantial  increase in pay, and the funniest thing about that was I didn't go after this job with a mindset to get more money.  I would have taken any job they offered me, as long as it was three days a week.  All I was really concerned about was getting the time available to perform more devotional service and to work on getting a group.. but I got so much more.... jai Srila Gurudeva, jai Prabhupada, jai Nitai-Gaurachandra, jai jai Nityananda Gaurasundar, jai jai Bala Gopal!

      Today I interviewed for a position at the hospital.  I originally applied for a floor nurse position but the manager who interviewed me thought I would be good for a coordinator's position, so she interviewed me for that too.  I am extremely hopeful about it all.  I really would love to have to work only three days a week and be able to have all that extra time for preaching and getting up a group.  It's really all about serving Krishna to the best of my ability, and putting myself in the best position to do that, materially and emotionally and time wise and psychologically.  Everything will fall into place, just so long as Krishna is in the FIRST place.

      Hopefully today we will be picking up Scott's truck.  This week is also very hectic with this truck buying and me working weird hours and having to get the house ready and all for leaving to go to New York.  I'm excited about the trip but I feel like we're going to need a vacation from it all.  Next year, Scott says, we're going to have a 'real' vacation.  We've never had one, so I think it will be fun.  But first, we've got to get through this year!!

      Had an absolutely fabulous time at the temple.  I am so inspired.  I was able to take the association of so many really advanced devotees, like Prema-manjari dd, who I had a very long talk with and who's really set me on a whole new path as far as preaching is concerned.  It was really unbelievable.  Janmastami was very successful with probably 1000+ visitors and devotees at the temple.  Bhakti Caru Maharaj and Bir Krsna Maharaj were both there.  Bhakti Caru Maharaj led some kirtans.  I always love how he sings-it's so full of sweetness.  The girls danced and there was a great maha table and many new things in the bookstore.  It wasn't excessively hot so it was a lot more comfortable than it's been the past two years.  At midnight was the feast.  I fasted on water (and a little juice) probably for close to 30 hours and I had a terrible headache.  I took a plate of prasadam and went back to the hotel around 1:30.  Oh was I sick!  I won't break a fast with fried foods and heavy subjis again!  But it was so wonderful as well, it's hard to pass up.  There were any number of preps-I can't even tell you how many there were.  The following day was Srila Prabhupada's Appearance Day.  I was sick at the hotel most of the morning but my stomach settled and I came around about 10:30 AM.  At noon was another feast- this one was even bigger (if possible!) than the Janmastami feast.  I had one plate of prasadam that I actually made THREE seperate meals of.  It was just amazingly opulent with a cake that was totally first class.  And that cake was just one of at least half a dozen sweets!  I didn't have near to everything that was there.  Friday was a fairly quiet day.  I spent some time with Prema talking in depth about the bhakti vrksa group.  It isn't quite what I will be aiming for right off the bat but so many of the ideas in the manual are great and totally applicable to cultivating new people.  She has so much experience in introducing people to Krishna Consciousness and she gave me so much help and new ideas.  I really can't even express in words what it is to have the association of someone who's advanced and so willing to help and support.  It really means a lot.  Saturday I made some big decisions in my life.  But first we went shopping!  Mandakini and I went to a couple of Indian stores and bought some good stuff, including a nice board for rolling out chapatis and some sweet (and hot!) lemon pickle.  After that, I spent some time at the hotel just sort of chilling out in the freezing AC and relaxing.  I made some decisions.  I decided firmly to quit my job.  Yes, I know I've been talking about it for months now but I really mean it-and this time, it's not because I'm paranoid or angry.  It's because I want to devote more time to preaching.  I've actually went and applied for a position at the hospital working three days a week.  If all goes well I'll be putting in my resignation the end of this week.  I just feel like I've finally got my priorities straight now-with devotional service, not work, in the top spot.  And yes, I know I said I'd never go back to the hospital, but this isn't about me or what I want, it's about what's best for advancing Krishna Consciousness in southeast North Carolina.  If working at the hospital is what it takes, then so be it.  Sunday I came home early.  We are working on buying a truck, a blue 2000 F150 for Scott.  It's proven to be a bit more complicated than we expected but at this point we plan to be picking it up tomorrow.  Then on Friday it's off to New York!  For now, it's off to bed.  I have to be to work very early tomorrow (5AM) and so I have to get up extra early so I have enough time to chant my rounds before I leave.

      Getting ready for a five day trip is always stressful.  Even if I didn't have to work.  I am excited about going but it's sort of like leaving a child-always second-guessing and wondering if you've left something where they might could get to it and hurt themselves.. so tomorrow is going to be VERY hectic and so will Wednesday morning.  Additionally, this is the week I get paid-so I've had to make some arrangements for getting my check (so my husband isn't forced into forging my signature!)  To make things even more stressful, we're going to New York next week-I'll be coming home from one trip and packing for the next.  I am sure it will all work out wonderfully well-but at the same time I am always a bit unnerved by it all.   I will be so happy when we live close enough to the temple that going there is something I can do every day.  In the meanwhile, I will be happy if just one person comes forward and becomes interested in Krishna Consciousness here in Wilmington.    Jai Srila Gurudeva!

      Janmastami is this week coming!  I always love to go up and spend several days at the temple.  What is even bigger for me (this year) is that we will be in New York for Radhastami.  I am planning on going to Second Avenue that day.  I hope to find out if anything is planned.  Since I've never been to Brooklyn (does that surprise you from a native New Yorker? Some people never leave their block, never mind their borough!) I don't feel very comfortable taking myself out to the Brooklyn temple alone.  Perhaps another time-maybe if Anne and I go back to New York again, we can spend a day going out there.  I have heard it is very beautiful-but since I have no idea how the trains run there or even where it is or what kind of neighbourhood it's in, I just wouldn't feel very safe.  Second Avenue is not a very good neighbourhood, but I will be there in the daytime, and I tend to always feel relatively comfortable no matter where I am in Manhattan.  I am hoping on getting involved in the Bhakti Vrksa program when I am up in Hillsborough.   I'll be there for five days this year, which is more than last year and a very welcome retreat for me spiritually.  I love Janmastami.  It is so much fun and excitement.  I'm just hoping it isn't too hot, and that maybe it doesn't rain  quite  as hard as it did last year.

      I can't believe how long it's been since I've written.  I did go to the temple with the girl who called me!  We had a very lovely time and she got the association of many very advanced devotees, besides being able to listen to Bir Krsna Maharaj give class.  It was important to me that she hear him speak, especially since it was on my first trip to the temple that I met my spiritual master, and because for some reason, Maharaj is not usually at the temple when I visit, and this time he was.  So I was glad that she had this opportunity.  I am continuing to see some response from the ad, so I expect to continue it as time goes on.  Additionally, I am going to get involved in some small way with one of the bhakti-vrksa groups in Hillsborough, so that will be some training for me in how to help people who are coming newly to Krsna Consciousness.  I am looking forward to it because my grasp of the philosophy is not very good.  So I am hoping to learn and become a little qualified to help other people.

      So.  Still no emotion about the job.  I'm guessing there isn't going to be any.  Still seems kind of strange, though.  I went to Social Security today and got my name changed on my card.  Then from there I went to DMV and got a new license.  I passed the vision test without wearing glasses.  Even though I wear my glasses when I drive, I don't want a restriction on my license.  Sometimes I forget them.  So I passed, even though I didn't look at the book first.  The only one I missed was Railroad Crossing.  As last time (1997) I had to close first one eye and then the other to read the letters on the chart. :(  Random interesting facts about me:  there are only two of these that I'm really aware of.  One is that my hemispheric dominance (like in the brain) is backwards.  Normally, dominance reflects handedness, and works in opposites.  What that means is, a right handed person will generally have left brain dominance, and vice versa.  There are lots of tests you can take online to find this out, but I found it out years ago in a psychology class.  I'm right handed and also right brained.  Is this the cause for all my confusion?  I'm a bit ambidextrous, which might explain some of it, and also I remember reading something an age ago about ADHD and hemispheric dominance.  Anyway, it's kind of interesting.  I wonder what it really does to me to be backwards like that.  My sister is left handed.  I guess I am supposed to be left handed too.  The other interesting thing about me is that I have an extra set of ribs.  We found this out when I had to have some lumbar films done.  The doctor thought it was a wonderful joke to ask the resident what was wrong with the film (she didn't get it) and he eventually counted out the vertebrae and ribs for her.  Apparently it's some kind of weird recessive gene thing and about 1 in 20 people have an extra set.  I don't know if they do anything good or bad for me, but there  they are.  I'm hoping that if anyone visits the blog, they'll sign the guestbook.  I didn't add it in for nothing.   urlLink Email Me

      Another rainy day.  I'm still surprisingly emotionless about this job change.  I wonder if tomorrow will make me think more.  I've got to go get my license changed tomorrow, and probably go to Social Security as well.  I started working on an Aran sweater for Gurudeva.  The pattern is a relatively busy one, which is fine.. and it's a charted pattern, which is something I've never really had to deal with, and it's like five seperate charts, because of the different panels of the pattern.  Even that isn't a problem, really.  The problem is errors in the charts.  That's definitely a problem.  After a little while you can just sort of carry on by looking at what you're doing, but boy, in the beginning, it was a real pain.  Anyway, it's a saffron colour, and I'm hoping to have it done in plenty of time.  The yarn I'm using is a Caron acrylic that is soft and feels really nice to the hand, and is super-easy care, which I figure will be good with the way he travels.  So after it's done, I'll take a picture and post it on  urlLink my regular website.   It's nice to be able to make something like this for him.   urlLink Email Me

      Every day I  urlLink have darshan  of Sri Sri Radha Golokananda online.  Radha-Golokananda are the presiding Deities of New Goloka up in Hillsborough.  It occurs to me, judging from comments people have made to me and questions people have asked, and even my own personal experience from when I was just learning about Krishna consciousness, that when you look at the forms (murtis) of the Deities from a material standpoint, you can get confused, and think They are just made of marble or brass or whatever, like dolls or statues.  But in reality They are not.  When you can begin to understand that the Lord actually comes in the form of the Deity to allow us to offer some service personally to Him, and you begin to try to approach Krishna and Radharani to develop a relationship with Them, then you can see for yourself that They are very much present and very much reciprocating with Their devotees.  Everyday, when I take darshan, and I see Them dressed so beautifully in Their night and day outfits, I think to myself, who couldn't love Them?  They are so beautiful and full of mercy, smiling at us.  Their mood is sweet and playful.  So as you come to guru and learn from him, and through him begin to take a step towards Krishna and Radharani's lotus feet, then you can begin to get a glimpse of the reality, and see past just the material vision of what looks to you like two statues.  There's so much more there, but you have to have the eyes to see it.  There are many accounts where Krishna has spoken to His devotees, and even travelled on foot across India to bear witness to an oath, when His devotee was going to be cheated.  The burden is on us, not on Him-when we can become pure enough, we can become qualified to engage in this sort of dealing with Krishna.  For now we have to try to elevate ourselves from this material mud.

      So.  My job's over.  Thought I'd have more emotion about it, but surprisingly enough, there's none.  None.  In exciting news, I got a call about the ad I've placed in the Ad Pak for a Bhakti Yoga class!  I called the girl and she's very interested and also bringing her mom and possibly one other friend.  So this is incredibly encouraging.  Prema mataji is helping me so much and giving me so many resources for facilitating this class.  All glories to her wonderful service and her recipe for Krishna's cookies!  There isn't any way any of this would be happening right now without her inspiration and her blessings.  Nobody can really understand the goodness and the compassion of the devotees, who are totally dedicated to bringing people to Krishna's feet.  I am so blessed just to be able to take association of such devotees.

       I GOT MY NAME CHANGED!   It's legal-my name is Satyavati devi dasi.  Of course, I kept my last name too.  I have a court order and everything to prove it.  I'm so excited.  I almost wish I could have done it Tuesday so that my nameday and my birthday would be the same.  My spiritual birthday, though, is April 25.  So it's so exciting.  I have so much to do now though-so many things to change.  Monday I'm going to get my driver's license renewed (it was up anyway) so that will be changed, and I'll need to call the Board of Nursing to see about my nursing license.  There's lots of other things that will have to be changed, but those two and my social security card are the biggies.  I made a form letter up that I'll be sending to people to get things changed over.  It will probably take us a good six months to get it all done properly.  But I'm totally excited about it.    I got a call from Sucharya mataji today.  It is always so inspiring to speak with advanced devotees.  She is planning on visiting Wilmington with her daughter Lalita soon, so perhaps we can spend some time together when they're down.  I also got the newest newsletter from Prema mataji, and I need to write some emails myself.  I am very fortunate to have such great association, even from far away.

      So today in the news kids are killing each other in schools and trying to kill themselves.  I don't know.. can someone actually be depressed enough to be seriously suicidal and not have anyone know it?  When you're young and in school and around people all the time?  I think everyone goes through a time in their lives when they at least contemplate things like that.  I know that years ago I did.  Males are more likely to actually attempt suicide than females, and they use different methods than females do.  But I still think, when we're talking about kids, someone should be paying enough attention to notice this sort of stuff.  Maybe this would be a good time to scroll back to my last rant and read all that stuff I wrote about unwanted children and evil karma.  I don't make this stuff up.  It's all there, in the Vedas, for anyone to read.  Krsna Himself, in the Bhagavad-gita, told Arjuna exactly what would happen if people stopped taking marriage seriously and engaging in illicit sex all over the place.  Now, unfortunately, we're looking at it.  How much more convincing do people need to realise they are on the wrong path?  Tomorrow's my last day at work.  It doesn't really feel like it.  There's so much chaos going on there it's practically unbelievable.  I think it's a good time to get out.

      I don't feel very well today.  Tired.  Blah.  Anxious to get this week ahead of me taken care of and done.  My friend Rangadevi is engaged to be married!  The wedding won't be til next summer, but it's always fun to plan.  We seem to have decided on a floor plan for Shangri-La.  Now just to get all the bills paid off, find a chunk of property not too far from Hillsborough, sell this one and build it. Simple as that?  I sure hope so.

      Another bright shiny day.  Scott has to work to make up for his hurricane day, and I'm on call.  Last night I had to call the cops  THREE  times.  The good ol' boys next door came home from the bar around twenty to three and decided they were going to put the music on really, really loud.  Now, I am not, per se, against loud music.  Scott's theatre setup is so intense that I can't keep a picture hung straight on the walls in there.  But not that loud at three in the morning.  You know?  Here he is, having to work in the morning, and here's me, who can't sleep if a pin drops, and they're over there playing the music so loud I can sing along with all my windows shut.  A residential development like this one is not the place for that.  You can hear everything around here.    So I called the cops.  Not in a screamy angry way, just in a hey, can you help me? way.  I can't go over there and ask him to turn it down, because he hates me (due to a fight we had about six, seven years ago) and he'd probably shoot me.  I was going to call his house, but his number isn't listed.  So after awhile I guess they came out and asked him to turn it off, and it went off for about twenty minutes, and then back on again.  Louder.  So I had to call again, and they came out again, and he shut it off again, and then at about ten to four he turned it on so loud I could actually hear it in the garage, which is all the way on the far end of the house from his house.  It's a good thing I wasn't the one having to work today, because I would have been really, really mad.  And then at four thirty they shut it off for good, and his lights went out.  The whole loud-music thing has been going on intermittently for years now.  Scott is a really sound sleeper so it doesn't wake him  up-therefore, he doesn't care.  But me, I get mad, just because it's so inconsiderate.  Even if he'd shut it off at midnight, I probably wouldn't mind.  But to just blatantly crank it up not caring about any of the neighbours-that's just not right.  I don't know how many times I've slept with earplugs.  But from now on, I'm just calling the cops.  We have been neighbours for ten years now.  Enough.

      The storm's over.  It really didn't do anything impressive here.  Just some wind-I think the highest sustained winds we had were around 60-65, and not a whole lot of rain.  A few trees came down here and there.  None of ours.  As always, today is gorgeous.  I went outside a little after four AM as I was getting ready to start chanting, and the sky was possibly the clearest it's been all year.  The sun's shining now, and there isn't any standing water-things are just a little damp.  The storm hit much harder north of us, but I still don't think it was all that big of a deal, after all.  It was moving so fast it didn't really have time to do a whole lot. I'm glad-if we have to take a hurricane, it's good when it's one like this.  This was like a microcaine. :)  A hurricanette.  A petit-cane.    I'm on call this weekend but I'd still like to get some things done around the house.  This is my last weekend at my current job and I am hoping not to work.  Yesterday I received two MP3's from Gurudeva's tape ministry.  They are lecture series.  The quality is really high on both the packaging and the sound.  There's a little anecdote I'm going to share related to this.  Back in April, when Gurudeva was here, I was staying at Uday and Raseswari's house in Graham, NC, to help out.  I wasn't getting more than two hours sleep a night (and really not even that much.)  Every night before I shut my eyes I wrote in my journal.  One night it was about 12:30-1AM and I was sitting in bed writing.  I was already undressed and I had my little tape recorder with me.  Out in the livingroom, Gurudeva suddenly began to sing Jaya Radha Madhava.  It was the most beautiful thing I'd ever heard-I had never heard that melody before, and it sounded just like a lullaby to me.  It actually made me cry.  Then there was some Mahamantra kirtan, in the same melody, very soft and gentle.  I wrote about it in my journal.  It was upsetting to me because I could not get dressed and out in time to tape it, and I figured it would just have to stay a transcendental memory.  So yesterday the CDs came and I put one in (Set U) and the first thing that came up?  Yes! You guessed it!  Jaya Radha Madhava, in that same beautiful melody.  I cried.  Hare Krishna.

      The air is getting heavy, and the wind's picking up.  It's about that time.  Welcome Isabel, and Hare Krishna.  In Kaliyuga, this age of the world that we live in, everything is so degraded.  People put their sensual and physical pleasures before everything else, even self-pride and respect, sacrificing themselves for a moment of perceived 'happiness'.  The demands of the body are catered to no matter what they entail.  Morality goes out the window-sex is disassociated from love and its proper context, a 'need' to be filled whenever it presents itself, with no regard for relationship, let alone marriage.  The children that result find themselves thrust into a world that didn't want them.  Surrounded by violence and sex in the media and raised by perhaps one parent, whose own lack of moral values was responsible for the 'accident' they are, how can they help but to grow up angry, resentful, violent, and even further degraded?  I know this sounds harsh.  And not every situation is as black as I paint it.  But I see variations on this theme every day.  People will do anything to satisfy the sex desire of the body.  It reminds me of my friend's dog, who is aptly named Trouble.  Another one of her dogs went into heat and Trouble was so intent on getting to the dog that he was actually hurting himself physically with his efforts.  Is what humans do any different?  They are so intent on joining sexually with people that they disregard the hurt they inflict on themselves and others to obtain it.  Nothing is as important as satisfying the body.  Because of this overriding obsession with the body, they have no time to consider higher things.  Spiritual questions are pushed aside in favor of evenings spent in bars drinking alcohol and going home with people they don't know, only to find themselves embarrassed and ashamed the next day, and no happier than they were before.  The Bhagavad gita and the Srimad Bhagavatam clearly explain this propensity of people to mistake their bodies for themselves, and outline very specifically and explicitly what happens when this occurs.  The solutions are so very simple, and easily obtained, with no difficulty and no cost.  But people are unwilling to do anything that might interfere with obtaining pleasure for the body.  It's like a child who is playing in the mud.  Although the mother offers the child a shiny, nice toy, the child doesn't want it, because it would have to leave the mudpit to come get it.  It doesn't make any sense, does it.  So there are four principles we follow: no intoxication, no meat eating, no gambling, and no illicit sex.  People think this is very restrictive.  Actually it's liberating.  If only they would try and understand, and then try for themselves.  There is no cost to giving up these things-in fact, most people would save an awful lot of money if they weren't out buying alcohol and meat products.  They think it would restrict their pleasure.  They don't understand that they are just in the mud.     urlLink Email me  if you'd like to talk about this.

      Well, the storm should be here tonight.  Right now it's a little breezy and the sun is shining.  I am overcome today by terrible inertia.  I don't want to go to work.  The whole building is boarded up and it's like working in.... "the long dark of Moria."  I slept late today (very bad) but for some reason I just couldn't keep my eyes open.  I'm going in late today.    Our sister facility in Wrightsville Beach is moving into our facility.  I tell you, the whole management of this thing has been a joke.  Instead of making all these emergency plans back in May like they should have, the genii at corporate have spent the last two days making a complete mess of things.  Reason #735 I made the right decision.  However, there is one bright spot in all of this.  I won't have to stay at work tonight.  Since we live so close to work, I'll be able to come home to sleep.  That's the only bright spot I can find so far.  At the very least it will be good to stay at home.    I am looking forward to having this thing over and done with and getting through this weekend (I am on call) so I can finish out this last week and be done with it.  I need to move on and get these plans for preaching set up and start work on the real important stuff-introducing people to Krishna consciousness and helping to generate their interest.  All the rest of this is just fluff.

      This pre-hurricane tenseness is always exhausting.  I'm trying to forget about it, but how can you?  I just need to focus more on what's important-reading, hearing, remembering and chanting.  There is a great CD I've been listening to by the Gauranga Bhajan Band called CHANT!.  It's really wonderful.  There are different tunes that they use for mahamantra kirtan.  I like it because it's got some really good beats and it's uplifting and inspiring.  I like best to listen to it in headphones while doing things around the house.  I'd like to find an inexpensive used set of Bhagavatam/Gita lecture books by Srila Prabhupada.  I do better somehow reading than listening.  Best of all would be to read AND listen.  I am going to look around to see what I can find.

      Today I began the process of having my name legally changed.  It's sort of an odd thing, as many legal things are.  First you have to "post a notice at the courthouse door".  This is literally a paper you fill out and put on a corkboard in the courthouse.  I think the idea behind this is that this way someone has the opportunity to read it and contest it, but in reality, who's down there reading the notices?  Anyway, the security was really tight.  I thought they were going to confiscate my scissors but they gave them back to me.  So anyway, the notice gets posted for ten days.  Then you show up with two notarised affidavits that say you have good character, and a paper outlining all your information and why you want your name changed, and there's a filing fee (always), and some proof of identity.  So then it goes before the judge, and he decides whether you can have your new name.  I'm pretty excited because this means my name will be changed before I go to work at the hospital.  I'm not crazy about waiting ten days, though.  So all eyes are on Isabel.  I figure it's coming to Wilmington.  They always do.  Plus, it's my last weekend at my job.  What could be a better ending?

      Another somewhat cloudy day.  Soon we will be able to turn off the air conditioning.  This is one nice thing about living in North Carolina-for almost six months of the year we don't run either heat or air.  My newest ad is going in the Ad Pak next week.  This one deals with the free bhakti yoga class.  I am hoping it will generate some interest.  I am making plans to go out in the next two weeks to distribute some flyers.  First I have to make some prasadam chidwa or cookies for distribution also.    I am very lucky to have the association of some very advanced devotees.  So many of the devotees at New Goloka are experienced preachers and have been going out in the community for years.  By taking their association I am able to learn lots of things I would otherwise have to learn by making mistakes.  Also, this allows me to ask for their blessings.  The blessings of the Vaisnavas are very powerful.  I always feel so inspired after I receive a newsletter or a personal letter from devotees who are so supportive and enthusiastic about whatever little efforts I can manage to make.  I feel like it would be all for their glory if I could establish something regular here.  So I am hopeful with all the changes currently in progress that soon I will be able to write and let everyone know that there are regular, steady preaching efforts going on and that results are being seen by Lord Caitanya's mercy.    There is a wonderful relationship that exists between all devotees.  Since we are all enlisted in the same mission of preaching about the glories of Krishna's Name and Lord Caitanya's message, and working to propagate Srila Prabhupada's mission, we can all take inspiration from each other.  We can all be enthusiastic for each other.  There isn't any sense of envy or jealousy.  I always feel so inspired (as well as humbled) when I hear about devotees who live in adverse circumstances, in countries that are very much opposed to Krishna consciousness, and yet they are establishing steady programs with devotees that are dedicated and unwavering in devotional service.  Then I think to myself, how fallen I must be that here I am in this environment that presents almost no obstacle and yet it has been all this time without any result.  So the fault is in me.  Today I received a lovely letter from Prema-manjari mataji, who lives in Hillsborough and is a very sincere and dedicated disciple of HH Bir Krsna Maharaj.  She has enormous experience in preaching and is a great source of inspiration and instruction for me.  She recommends that in order to facilitate preaching efforts, sadhana must be very dedicated and serious, with attentive japa every day early in the morning (NO OVERSLEEPING!!) and daily reading of Srila Prabhupada's books.  In this way, she explained, by having one's own sadhana very purified, people will be drawn to develop interest in Krishna Consciousness.  So this I am taking as my mission: to increase my attentiveness (sometimes I am not very attentive at all) and to increase my reading of Srila Prabhupada's books, and to overall improve my daily sadhana.  This way by following in the footsteps of a devotee who has had so much good experience and good results in preaching work, I can hope to pull myself out of material mentality.  So I am very inspired today.  Despite the fact that these last two weeks or so at my job are going to drag, I feel like it is going to be a precursor to better things, and I am looking forward to putting together a schedule so that I can be sure that things get done routinely and consistently, not haphazardly.  All glories to the wonderful preaching efforts of the Vaisnavas, who are compassionate and dedicated to helping all the conditioned souls in the world.

      We are back from New York.  I didn't do a single thing I had planned to do but we had a nice time anyway.  We stayed at Scott's mom's house and met her boyfriend (Scott's father left his body in 2003 after a long bout with cancer).  He seems very nice and they seem to be very happy together.  We drove around a LOT and saw all the old neighbourhoods.  Not very far from my house we saw a flock of wild turkeys, which was a first for me-in all the years I lived there, I never saw such a thing.  The lake didn't look very good.  We went up to Cold Spring and took some nice pictures.  I am hoping to get them developed tomorrow.  We also went to Norwalk to the aquarium there.    The weather was cold (in the 50's) and raining most of the week.  I had to buy a jacket because I was freezing half to death.  Every morning I got up and chanted japa on the front porch.  The first morning I locked myself out and was out there from about 4:30 to 7.  It was very cold.  We finally told Scott's mom about me being a devotee.  I gave her a copy of The Higher Taste and a nice Gita, and she read the mahamantra (aloud) off my beadbag.  So Jai!  In that respect it was very good.  I am also going to send a cookbook and possibly a Gita to Don's granddaughter Krystle as well.  On the way home we got confused and made a wrong turn that took us about 100 miles out of our way, so we are really tired tonight and won't do much of anything but get some rest.

      It was very nice to meet Bhaktin Polly on Saturday.  She didn't get the whole 'Sunday Feast' mood, but she was able to spend some very nice quality time with several advanced devotees, including the temple president, Mother Krishnapriya, and to see the Deities.  I like to go up on a non-Sunday because I like the quiet and the sweetness of the mood.  Most especially I like to sit beside Srila Prabhupada and chant.  It's just so peaceful.  Bhaktin Polly asks so many good questions.  She is hoping to meet Bir Krsna Maharaj in the near future.  She got some books and some neckbeads, and her husband was reading some of Nectar of Instruction, so I feel very sure that the mercy is raining down on their house.  I am helping a friend of mine write a report for her religion class.  She's decided to write about the Hare Krishnas.  I've never done anything like this before but I sure am willing to try.  I go to nights on the 25th, and looking forward to it.  urlLink Email Me

      Received a letter from a devotee in Reading (UK) who is originally from Mauritius (I have a Godsister in Mauritius) and who is interested in approaching Srila Gurudeva to ask to be accepted as an aspiring disciple.  The devotee, Bhakta Kesava, asked for some help in composing the letter.  I too asked someone to help me with my first letter to Gurudeva, so I was happy to render some service.    Yesterday I didn't feel very well, but today I am going up to Hillsborough.  Bhaktin Polly will be there, so that's very exciting, and I am looking forward to it.  It's raining here, but abotu 72 degrees.. Hillsborough will be partly sunny but even colder, so I am making sure to dress warm.    Work's been good.  I am enjoying doing assessments and thinking, trying to put pieces together.  I'm learning a lot because I'm working with diagnoses and situations I've never had to deal with before, as well as learning about all the technology and new things that come with being a coordinator vs a staff nurse.  The charting on computer is getting easier.  Lots of things are the same.  I feel good about how things are going.  Next week I'm working Tuesday and Wednesday in Neuroscience, then I'm working the weekend in Geriatrics.  After that, who knows?    All I'm worrying about today is getting up to Hillsborough.

      Long day.  Achy feet.  Feels good to get my hands on a patient in acute care for the first time in five years.  Still kind of overwhelmed, still remembering Krishna and wanting to continue in Srila Gurudeva's footsteps of preaching.  Tapasya.  Some people today asked me about my neckbeads and how I came by my name, so I was able to bring up just a wee bit about Krishna consciousness at work.   Jaya Srila Prabhupada!  I have been planning on going to Hillsborough this weekend, tomorrow.. I normally go on Sunday but I have to work Monday and I can't be out late on Sunday night.  It will be wonderful to be back up there again.  urlLink Email Me

      I think my blogging schedule might change a little bit now that I'm working again.  The 12 hour days are long and it is hard enough to do all the things I have to do in the little bit of free time I have outside of sleep time, so I will probably be writing only briefly if at all on days I work.  There's so much new at the hospital, I feel like I have to go back to school.  I am very grateful for the long orientation periods they have now (6 weeks).  I got my first paycheck today, and also my last paycheck from my old job, so that's good, as it means there won't be any lapse in the income.    Today is a nice day out and I am looking forward to spending just a little bit of time, maybe an hour, outside in the sun chanting.  I did a little food shopping today and plan to make aloo sak later (aloo sak is a very simple dish of greens and potatoes.  Preferably you use spinach, but I got some turnip greens, which will also be nice.  Lord Caitanya's favourite dish was sak.  His mother, Srimati Sacidevi, used to make all different kinds of sak for Him.)  Apart from that, I've been more stressed out than possibly I realise.  It is entirely possible to be under major stress and not consciously realise it.  However, the body will let you know!  I have had some persistent, intractable heartburn for about 3 days now.  Tums helps for about half hour, and then it's back.  So today I've moved to Tagamet (nice that it's over the counter now) and I am hoping that helps, and if it doesn't, I'll move to Prilosec, and if that doesn't help, I'm scheduling a GI consult.  LOL! And probably a psych consult.  No.  I'm teasing.  I'm just realising how much the job change is stressing me out.  It will be another stress when I move to nights (in about another two weeks) and have to get acclimated to that.  I am just considering this tapasya, austerity, to be able to preach.  This job is simply for the purpose of providing me the time to preach and share Krishna Consciousness with others.  So any discomfort, stress, tiredness, anxiety, irritation, etc., that comes with it (and you know it will.. you cannot work on a hospital floor without seeing all of those things at some point) I am considering just austerity for Krishna.  I have to always remember that He has put me in this job and He takes care of His devotees, and to remember all the austerities and difficulties that Gurudeva goes through to bring the message to the people of Poland.  At least no one is trying to beat me up!  (Yet! LOL!) So any little difficulty is just temporary and is worth it in the end.  Hare Krishna!  urlLink Email Me

      So there I was making prasadam cookies to bring to work tomorrow (nothing like someone who shows up on the first day of work with a GIANT BASKET full of cookies, right?) and the phone rings and who is it but Ramcandra prabhu.  So he tells me, the Padayatris are on route 701 right near Elizabethtown.  Well, I just about fell out.  I was so near them yesterday!  They had to take a detour, so I missed them.  Today their goal is to go to Clarkton.  So I said to myself, jai! I'm there.    After finishing up the cookies I jumped in the Jeep and off I go.  Well, you want to talk about hell's half acre.  It's nice out there, but boy, is it a lot of nothing.  Cotton and peanuts, that's about all I saw.  Some cows, a few ducks, a pig, some goats, a couple of horses.  Onward I go.  Finally I make my way through Bolton to 211 and then from 211 onto 701.  There they were, parked at a little church.  JAYA!  I nearly flipped my Jeep spinning it round to park it.  Then, the next thing I find out-I KNOW these devotees!  They don't know me, or maybe more accurately they don't remember me, but I remember them-back when I first started visiting the temple, they were there, and then they went to India.  So Avadhuta prabhu and his wife Chandrabhaga mataji are doing the Padayatra.  Their Lordships Sri Sri Nitai Gaurasundar are very beautiful and giving darshan as They go.  Their smiles are so sweet, and They have beautiful lotus eyes.  Yes, I took lots of pictures and as soon as they're developed they will be on my website.   Sri Nrsingadev is also on Padayatra with them and watches very protectively over His devotees.  The whole atmosphere is so sweet and transcendental.  The horses, Kana and Balaji, are big Belgian horses.  Enormous.  Bigger than your average horse.  They are draft horses, and like to pull.  I helped to feed Balaji, who is indeed very strong.  They are surprisingly gentle for such big horses, but once they were hooked to the cart, they were ready to keep going.  We can all learn a very good lesson from these faithful souls who very steadily perform their service for the Lord everyday, with no complaints, and requiring only the basic necessities of life.  Kana and Balaji ki jai!  Several people stopped to visit while I was there.  A little boy came and asked if he could come along.  He told me he lives with his grandfather and his grandfather's wife.  When I asked him about the rest of his family, he just shrugged.  Lord Caitanya's mission is so transcendental.  I gave him my card with the padayatra website on it, and Avadhuta prabhu encouraged him to stay in school til he's 18, and then come and join the Padayatra.  Several other people showed up.  Mataji says it's often a 'circus' atmosphere.  I was impressed how respectful everyone seemed.  I know nobody in Clarkton, NC has EVER seen devotees before.  It's amazing how Srila Prabhupada is bringing Lord Caitanya's movement to even these little towns in Nowhere, USA.    I stayed for a couple  of hours and brought a small offering of turmeric, basmati, mustard seeds, toor dal, urad dal, hing and some laxmi, whatever I could afford.  I wish it could have been more-I too would love to join the Padayatra and just carry on across the country.  But we all have our service to perform.  Who would ever have thought I'd be offering obesiances to Sri Sri Nitai Gaurasundar in a grassy field beside an AME Zion church?  Truly miracles happen every day.   In return the Padayatris gave me a maha apple from Their Lordships and also some candied fennel from Sri Sri Radha Damodara.  This is especially important to me, being that now is the time we particularly remember Lord Damodara's pastimes.  All glories to Lord Caitanya's sankirtan movement! urlLink Email Me

      So I drove all over hell's half acre today looking for the Padayatris.  I drove from Elizabethtown to Clinton and then, after talking to Ramcandra prabhu in New Jersey, I decided to go back through their itinerary.  So I ended up in Snow Hill.  Finally I figured I wasn't going to find them today, and came home.  Nobody I asked had seen them, not even the police I spoke to had heard about or seen them, so my question now is.. where ARE the Padayatris?  urlLink Email Me

      Just to keep you up to date: yesterday was OK.  In the interest of being unbiased and fair in my reporting, the hospital seems  to have really taken a different attitude from the time I left.  The 'magnet status' thing seems to be the real deal, and not just a PR trick.  They honestly do seem to be much more nurse-friendly than they were when I was here last.  In particular I am impressed with the very thorough orientation plans.  So many things have changed in the last five years that I feel like I'm waking up from a coma.  They don't use demerol anymore.  I have a lot to relearn.  In other news, today I am going to find the Padayatris.  I have only the vaguest notion of where they are, but I'm going to get dressed, get in the car, and head out there to see if I can't find them.  My plan is to make a huge circle from here probably all the way up to Clinton and then come across 24 to 242, and then down to Elizabethtown.  If I don't find them today, I'll find them tomorrow.  Either way the weekend isn't ending without me finding the Padayatris.  I have Monday off-if I need that as well, I'll do it.  I have money for gas, and I went and got them some dal, turmeric, a bag of basmati, two jars of hing, and I will stop and get some carrots for the horses and one of th ose little disposable cameras that I like.  I am hoping to be back later online documenting my visit with them.   Hare Krishna!  urlLink Email Me

      I could write a lot of mundane things today, but instead I am going to tell you about the very nice phone call I received from Ramcandra prabhu, who works with the Padayatris.  There was a terrible accident, where a car crashed into the back of the wagon, but miraculously, no one was hurt.  JAI SRI SRI GAURA NITAI!  They are probably going to be in the area of Elizabethtown sometime this weekend.  Ramcandra prabhu is going to call me later on tonight to let me know what's up.  The Padayatris are expecting me, which is somehow very wonderful to me, and I am hoping to bring a nice offering for Their Lordships.  They mentioned that they need some hing, so I am going to check in the Saigon Market to see if they stock it, and if not, I have some that I can give them.  I am thinking about dal and a nice bag of basmati and whatever else I can find.  The Saigon Market will be my best bet.  I am also going to bring some flowers and, if I can locate one of our little coolers, some milk, and some laxmi.  The Padayatra is very important to me.  Being by myself here, when I first heard about it, I was hoping they'd come this way, and then I thought, oh, why would they, there are no devotees here.  Well, Elizabethtown is about 45 miles from here, but that's close enough for me.  I am so looking forward to meeting with them.  I am anxious to bring the videocamera and take lots of pictures, so there will be pictures posted on the website.  It will be so inspiring to see them, just wandering across the country, bringing the holy Name to everyone and anyone, just like Lord Caitanya did.  This coming week I'm off Saturday, Sunday, Monday, so I am pretty sure that I'll be able to go visit.  I'd like to spend some time with them, if they have the time.  I don't want to be a burden, either, and they have places to go and things to do.  I think I will also bring some carrots for the horses.   This is a really big event for me-I am almost surprised by how important it's become to me that I see them when they're here.  Hare Krishna!

      First: I got 100% on my pharmacology test.  This means I still have a job.  Here's one of the questions: you have to give 250 units of insulin IV in 1000cc of saline at a rate of 4 units per minute.  What is the rate in cc per hour and given a drip factor of 10, how many drops per minute?  Second:  I got another email from the Padayatris and they are in Clinton.  So hopefully I will be able to go see them soon!  I have my schedule for at least the next week, so I am looking forward to hearing from them as they get closer.  Third:  A VERY generous donation was received to support the Free Book Program and Srila Gurudeva's preaching.  All glories to Bhaktin Polly!  Using resources in Krishna's service is the perfection of having resources.  Being a wise steward of resouces for Krishna's service is the responsibility that goes along with it.  It's important to always be careful and remember that we are responsible to manage Krishna's resources-not for ourselves, but for Him.  It's still raining, but that's all right.

      Long day sitting through the first of five orientation days at the hospital.  It's given me a headache so this has to be short.  Read a really good book I got for my mom for Christmas (yes, I buy Christmas presents, but we don't do much) called NEW YAWK TAWK.  It brought back a LOT of memories of things I grew up hearing, like 'Does Macy's tell Gimbels?' and a lot of phrases and words I didn't even know were New Yorkisms.. like all true New Yorkers, I believe that the way we do it there is the way it's done everywhere.  I remember going to Philadelphia once and being absolutely stunned that the subway shut down at night.  It seemed ridiculous to me-why should the subway shut down??? It's the subway.  Yes, we DO believe New York is the center of the universe.  I'm debating upgrading the blog to something I can put pictures into, but on the other hand, I'd rather use the money to send out books.   urlLink Email Me

      Today's the day my job starts at the hospital.  I'm a little nervous.  I still haven't been cleared to work by the doctor, so I have to actually leave orientation and be at Employee Health at 9:15.  I'm hoping that's just a breeze, and that everything's okay.    Like everything, this job is only temporary.  It's going to allow me to do the things I need to do-preach, distribute books, begin a group here in Wilmington-and it's going to provide resources for us to pay off our bills and move to Hillsborough.  That has to be the focus.  The job itself isn't important; what I personally want or don't want isn't important.  The ends are defining the means here.  The whole focus is that the priority is Krishna.   urlLink Email Me

      I've started up a  urlLink Yahoo Group  for all of Srila Gurudeva's disciples,  friends and well wishers.  I am hoping that it will provide a good forum to keep up with his travels and hopefully facilitate some communication.  There is one group on PAMHO that I am a member of, but it's in Croatian and I haven't learned how to read it yet.  There wasn't a conference available for Srila Gurudeva's disciples in English, and I know not everyone is a member of PAMHO, so I decided on Yahoo as a quick and simple way to get everyone together.  There's also a link here on the sidebar, so it's just as easy as can be to join.  Jai Srila Gurudeva! urlLink Email Me

      After my sleeve reached 21" I realised that I made a huge mistake about 18" ago that involves increases.  SO this means about 18" of the sleeve has to come out and be redone-I can't even go back and just pull out a stitch or two to fix it.  Like spiritual life.  You sometimes have to go back and fix problems that were caused through your own inattentiveness and lack of concentration.  The solution is to develop that attentiveness and work on improving the concentration, and being aware to spot problems before you've knit another 18" past it.  urlLink Email Me

      I'm getting a little more used to this fall weather.  Today, though, it's supposed to get up to 76.  I am very happy to be having some opportunity do to a little preaching by email.  Although my knowledge of the philosophy is limited and I am not very advanced myself, I have available a lot of resources to look through Srila Prabhupada's books and words.  So that makes it easier.  I often worry, what if I say something wrong? or make a mistake? but I just have to trust that Radharani won't let that happen and will make sure that the intelligence comes from Krishna to say the right thing.  Today I'm not sure what the plan is.  I do need to do some cleaning up and laundry around here before  Monday.  I don't even know what my schedule will be like next week, so I want to make sure I'm good for clothes, etc, before I get into things.  I also need to rearrange my office here at home and gget my printer installed.  I had it at work for almost two years.  It's just a matter of making room for it on the desk, but what a huge difference it makes having it available.  I will write later this afternoon and I promise to be less mundane and more philosophical. urlLink Email Me

      So I've been watching the  urlLink Padayatra  with great interest.  They're coming to NC!  I looked at the itinerary, and, if Krsna wills it, I won't be working they days they are near Elizabethtown.  I'd really like to get out and see them and offer my obesiances.  If I can, you can believe I will have tons of pictures up.  Right now they're in Gaston, NC, which is better than a three hour drive from here.   urlLink Email Me

      So today's our eleventh anniversary.  The weather is almost identical to how it was when we got married-ie, gorgeous.  Sunny and cool.  I got him a nice present-a stereo for his truck.  The one in there only has a cassette player, and a while back he was talking about getting one with a CD, so I found him one at Best Buy that plays not only CDs but MP3.  So it's nice, and if he wants it installed, they'll do it, or otherwise I got him the parts.  I also bought as a sort of gag gift a pair of saddle shoes, and I got neon green laces.  This is a joke that goes WAY back.  When I first met him, that was all I would wear-saddle shoes with neon green laces.  Sort of my counterculture statement.  So he's never forgotten them, even though they've been long gone, fell apart.  I decided to get some as a goof.  Do you know how hard they are to find?!    So I went back to Employee Health sans paperwork and they wouldn't deal with me.  So I went over to the office and shamelessly exploited the fact that I went to school with my doctor's nurse, and she got me a signed release pretty quickly.  I don't like pulling strings like that, but I was pretty desperate.  Then I went flying back to the hospital with it, but the doctor was done for the day, so they took it and told me to show up for orientation at 8:15 on Monday.  Whew.  At least I'm going to START orientation.  I don't know why it didn't occur to me earlier to do that, but Krishna certainly gave me the intelligence today.  Jai Nitai Gaurachandra!  From there I ran over to the bank and gave them the name change paperwork, so that will be taken care of too.  Slowly but surely everything's coming around.  I sent off my nurses license yesterday, so maybe I'll have my new one by the end of next week.  I lost the phone number of the girl who called me about the bhakti yoga class.  I am desperately hoping she calls me back.  I must have been brain dead not to write it down.  I did save it in my voice mail, but it apparently clears itself periodically.  I hope she calls me back!! urlLink Email Me

      Went over to the hospital today to do the whole pre-employment health thing.  Was reminded why I was so happy when I left.  It doesn't matter.  What's important is that this job is going to give me the time to preach and be in the community doing devotional service, and that the income generated by this job is going to pay off our bills and get us up to Hillsborough.  It's so easy to fall into that 'me me me' thing.  It doesn't take a lot of effort to get back into it.  I have to continually remind myself-as sorry as I am to have to admit that-that this job isn't about ME.. it's not about what I WANT.. it's about advancing my Gurudeva's mission, and Srila Prabhupada's mission, and ultimately Lord Caitanya's sankirtan movement.  It hasn't got anything to do with me.  We have to accept those things favourable, and reject that which is unfavourable.  This does not mean 'accept those things I want and reject those things I don't want'.  It means what it says.  As it is.  I went and picked up my check today.  Already it seems like things are not doing well.  There's a lot of tension over there.  The weather has been marvelous.  I am very excited about the opportunity to do a little preaching via email.  It's totally enlivening and encouraging to be able to help someone with questions about Krishna consciousness.  It's really what makes all this worthwhile.     urlLink Email Me

      I think making this sweater for Gurudeva is a lot like spiritual life.  It's complicated.  Although the finished product looks so easy, you don't see the hard work that went into creating it.  Each pattern is different and has to be managed seperately.  Sometimes you screw up and have to rip out rows and start again.  You have to start again.  You can't just let it sit there.  So I'm knitting, and listening to his lectures, and praying for blessings.  Then unknitting, ripping things out, listening to lectures, praying for blessings.  And then suddenly you look, and see how the pattern's coming along, and it doesn't look so bad after all.    urlLink Email Me

      Just when I was whining about not being engaged, Krishna's sent me someone.  I got a very nice letter from a lady in Winston Salem who is interested in Krishna Consciousness and who's been looking over  urlLink my site.   It turns out she is in much the same position that I was three years ago.  So I am very happy to be able to help and to be engaged in service.  It's amazing to me how preaching is the best way to fire up my own enthusiasm.  Jaya Srila Gurudeva!   urlLink Email Me

      Fall is here.  Right now it's 55 degrees.  We've got all the windows open and boy am I freezing.  I keep thinking I need to be more austere, but I just get so cold.  Later, after the sun comes up, I'll be out there basking like a turtle.  For now I just want to get wrapped up in blankets.  This shift change is going to be weird for me.  I am going to try and plan my schedule to sleep from say eleven or noon till five, so I'll have my mornings on days I'm working.  Maybe if I'm really ambitious I can go to the beach in the mornings-it'll be quiet, and I can park and walk for a while.  I can go by the Oceanic and park there because they will be closed at that ungodly hour and I can have the beach to myself.  Japa is nice at the beach.  I'd like to have a routine like that, where I do that on my days working.  Days off are another story-I am going to get a little chalkboard or weekly dry erase calendar to post where I'll be every day.  I have to make sure I don't lose the momentum on this.  It's the whole reason I took this job-to have the time to get out there and preach.  Gurudeva's sweater is coming along one sleeve at a time.  The pattern is a bit more complicated than I originally thought.  Not undoable, but you do need to be attentive.  There's a lot going on.  I bought three one-pound skeins of that Caron yarn and now I'm wondering if it will be enough.  Good thing it's no dye lot.  All yarns ought to be no dye lot.  How do they do that, though?  I can tell you this.. being at home with no real engagement going on is boring.  I am doing a lot of reading and hearing, but with me and my ADHD, the lack of people contact is kind of hard.  So maybe that's a good thing-it will help to push me out of the house.  By nature, I'm shy.. though most people who know me will deny that.  I'm not shy once I get to know people.  But to go out cold and preach on a college campus-that's pretty intimidating.  But you know, I think about Gurudeva and what he has to face.  He goes into places that he knows are hostile and unfriendly, and without any fear he just holds kirtans and has harinam all through the town, and takes on any risk without flinching.  I pray that he blesses me with that kind of fearlessness.  You should read  urlLink his diary.   It reads like a movie.  Everywhere he goes, miracles just happen, and people who were so unfavorable to Krishna come around and take prasadam and end up supporting the devotees and facilitating for them.  It's unbelievable.  Of course, there have been some bad things that have happened too-I read about where the devotees were attacked by a group of skinheads and several of them were seriously hurt and had to go to the hospital.  The demonic mentality is still there.  But even after that, he's still fearless.  Even if I wasn't his disciple, even if I wasn't a devotee, I'd still have to admire that.  There are many initiating spiritual masters in ISKCON.  They are all a little different, and have a different mood.  Although the message is the same, they each have an individual personality.  So you have to search and find the one that is right for you.  And the guru needs to look at the student, and decide if this student is right for him.  It's a reciprocal process.  The Vedas say that guru is a manifestation of Krishna.  This means that when the student is serious about learning Krishna consciousness, Krishna personally manifests to the student through the guru, in order to teach and to bring the student back home, back to Godhead.  That's pretty amazing stuff.  Some people search for years, sometimes a lifetime, without finding their spiritual master.  I admire those devotees, who remain faithful nevertheless.  I think that would be really hard on me.  For me, it was the opposite-the very first time I visited the temple, there he was.  That was some very special mercy on me.  I never really had to think all that hard about it, or agonize over decisions.  I don't think that's how it is normally, for most people.  All I can think is that Radharani gave me some personal mercy that day.  I mean, I did consider to myself, is this my guru?  And like Srila Prabhupada said, I looked, and read, and thought, and prayed about it.  But it was more like just looking for confirmation purposes.  I knew right from minute one.  So for every devotee, no matter who their spiritual master is, that spiritual master is Krishna personally manifesting to them in the form of the guru.  So we are always careful to not offend or be disrespectful to anyone's spiritual master.  The attractions are not the same-I don't feel the same towards my spiritual master's Godbrothers, necessarily.  But cognitively I understand, and respect them.  And certainly we wouldn't want to offend those Vaisnavas who are their disciples.  So it's in some ways like a regular family, but then again, it's on a higher platform.  I am not sure if any of this is making any sense, but it is to me, so I'll just leave it for now.    Comments are welcome, as always.  urlLink Email Me

      Gita jayanti is coming up.  Here is my favourite quote from the Bhagavad gita.  You can read it  urlLink here .  It comes from Chapter 2, verse 72, purport:  There is no difference between the kingdom of God and the devotional service of the Lord. Since both of them are on the absolute plane, to be engaged in the transcendental loving service of the Lord is to have attained the spiritual kingdom. In the material world there are activities of sense gratification, whereas in the spiritual world there are activities of Krsna consciousness. Attainment of Krsna consciousness even during this life is immediate attainment of Brahman, and one who is situated in Krsna consciousness has certainly already entered into the kingdom of God.     urlLink Email Me

      Yesterday was my last day on days.  I only have one day off and then I'm going to nights tomorrow, so today is going to be a bit hectic.  I need to cook enough to get lunches in the freezer for about a week or two (this saves me SO MUCH time, you wouldn't believe it) and get laundry done.  The way my schedule's worked out, I'm on one-off one for part of the week.  That won't be happening often in the future!!  It's very difficult to do on nights.  Anyway, we are both still sick-at this point I'm a little better than he is, but not much.  I read the other day that this is supposed to be the worst flu season in 30 years.  Maybe this is the beginning of it.  I didn't get a flu shot this year.  I don't like to get them unless they let me give them myself.  Hopefully soon my fabric and patterns will show up and I can start working on some dresses.  Already I'm getting tired of wearing pants.  Became part of a very nice egroup.  It's so good to have some association.     urlLink Email Me

      I was excited about going to nights next week, but they've decided to put me on days for one more week for management training.  This is the sort of thing someone in charge ought to be thinking about when orientation begins, not when it's supposed to be ending.  I don't like disruptions in my schedule.  There's nothing I can do about it, but it's still irritating.  More irritating is the fact (which, apparently, only I can see) that they have me scheduled for the wrong weekend.  There's a full weekend and a short weekend, and they scheduled me for the full one.  The problem with the hospital is this: you really can't tell anyone the problem, or if you do, it doesn't get addressed, until the time comes and it's happening that I'm there on the full weekend.  Then it will all be a panic and my whole schedule will be disrupted again, when if they'd just listened in the beginning, it could have been addressed before it became a problem. So anyway, things *will* get better and actually, they are.  Soon everything will be normal again, and I'll get caught up on my letter writing, which is sadly behind, and back into everything I should be doing. Jai Haribol!   urlLink Email Me

      I promise, every day's getting better.  By next week things should be back to normal.  It hasn't been easy-but then again, the road to Braj, as I put in big letters up top there, is strewn with thorns.  And sometimes it feels like it's all thorns and no road.  So this is part of the process: keeping on when it seems like everything's going against you.  We are all so conditioned, for millions of lifetimes, again and again, to this material nature.  It's so hard to keep yourself straight.  The aspiration is there-we want to keep going on the road, to keep walking the straight path-but this material conditioning is very strong.  Imagine breaking a habit you've had for millions of lifetimes-not years, lifetimes.  So that's our challenge.  And through the mercy of Sri Guru and Srila Prabhupada, and all the Vaisnav devotees, we can take that challenge and walk on that path.  But that doesn't mean we don't stumble or don't fall, ever.  So then the challenge becomes how to keep going-how to get up, how to keep walking on this thorny road. So we support each other, and look to each other for mercy and understanding, and prayers.  The prayers of the Vaisnavas are very powerful!  It is only through the mercy of the devotees that we become Krishna conscious at all.  So it's a wonderful thing, that we have each other to turn to.   Lord Nrsingadev is very powerful, and has the strength to conquer anything.  My little problems and miseries are nothing in His hands.  He can do it all through His mercy and His power.  Jai Nrsingadev!  Please have mercy on me and let me take shelter of Your lotus feet, and keep me safe, even from my own self and my own material nature.  urlLink Email Me

      I was off yesterday (and today) and working tomorrow, but not Sunday.  This, while confusing, was an effort to get me out of the dreaded 'three in a row' syndrome.  I'm hoping that the new time tract will reflect what I put down for my schedule-ie., two on, two off, two on, three off, that kind of thing.  No single days, no three in a rows.  We'll see.  After all, it's the hospital.    Now that you've completely forgotten this blog is about the spiritual journey, I suppose it's time to talk about the spiritual journey.  "The road to Braj is strewn with thorns."  This is something my  urlLink guru   said during one of his lectures when he was last here.  What does it mean?  Braj, or Vraja, is also known as Vrndavan.  When Krishna appeared here 5000 years ago, He lived in Vrndavan, which is not far from Agra and Mathura in India.  He also went other places, but His most intimate pastimes were in Vrndavan.  Actually, Vrndavan is an eternal place-Goloka Vrndavan.  Krishna brings all of His associates, including Vrndavan, to the material earth, when He comes.  So there is still today in India a place called Vrndavan.  It is a very holy place, where many devotees live.  Although it is a small village there are over 5000 temples in Vrndavan, and everyone there is naturally Krishna Conscious.  The residents of Vrndavan are called Brijbasis.  Now, sometimes people go to visit Vrndavan and they see that on a material level, it is dirty, there are open sewers, trash, bad water, and so on.  Because of this, they question and say, how can this be a holy place?  It is because you can't see the real Vrndavan with your material eyes.  Just like how people say they want to see God.  But are your material eyes qualified to see God?  Can you see faraway stars without the aid of a telescope?  How do you think your material vision can show you God?  First you have to become pure, and then you'll be able to see.  That's what Srila Prabhupada said.  So, the road to Braj is strewn with thorns.  This is a metaphor for spiritual life.  Braj is our goal-to be with Radharani and Krishna.  But the road we walk to get there has many thorns and disappointments.  Not every day is perfect.  It takes determination and perserverance.  When we screw up, we have to keep on going.  Despite the thorns, we still have to walk the road.  So this is my path, and there are thorns all over it.  Sometimes it hurts a lot.  Sometimes I feel like I've fallen off the side of the road.  But we have to keep going, crawling if necessary, knowing at least that this is the road that goes to Braj, even if it's still a million miles away.  Now I said I was going to talk about modesty.  Modesty is one of those universal spiritual truths.  It isn't just about clothes, either, but behaviour.  I have been talking, like I said, with that very nice lady from Israel who's making me some uniform jumpers.  She is an Orthodox Jew, and rules of modesty are very strictly laid down (even to the acceptable thickness of pantyhose) by the rabbis and religious leaders.  Many Christian groups, not only the Amish and Mennonites, also enforce modest dress.  Of course there has been much focus on the Muslim conception of modesty as well over the last couple of years.  I read once an article written about young Muslim women who wear the hijab, or headcovering, and who dress modestly.  They all said the same thing-that by covering their bodies, they force other people, both women and men, to accept and value them based on content-their intelligence and personality- rather than on context, or what they looked like.  These women had a strong sense of self-respect and self-dignity that was really admirable.  It was a great thing for me to hear a young woman in her twenties saying: Look, I'm smart, and I have value as a person.  What I look like doesn't matter, and I won't allow you to make what I look like more important than who I am.  It was really great.  I think women who wear hijab should be encouraged and applauded.  This does not mean I think women should be beaten or arrested for not wearing it (or for not wearing a burqa) but I think that women who do choose to cover themselves should be given great encouragement for it.  We are, at least in the western world, so innundated from birth with this Barbie mentality, that we very naturally assume that only pretty girls are successful, only skinny girls win, only girls who are in the latest fashions are cool, etc etc etc.  This is why we have all these cases of anorexia and bulimia and so on.  I realise this is all a bit convoluted and I am trying to keep it on track, but I have a lot of points I'd like to make here.  There are also different standards of modesty, and what one culture or religious group may see as modest, another may see as immodest.  Yet all are after the same goal.  For example, I may wear a sari with a short choli blouse.  Now, I have most of my cholis made super long because I personally don't like to show off my belly, but there are some I have that are rather short.  And a good number of my saris are fine cotton gauze, which is not opaque.  I do wear my sari pulled up and pinned on my head for the most part-if I am out in the community I might let it down.  So how can I claim to be modest, when I am in short sleeves and my belly's visible (even through the sari)?  Modesty is not just about what you wear, but also how you behave.  Chaste behaviour is crucial.  What good is it for you to cover yourself from head to toe if your behaviour doesn't match it?  So you will see in the community of devotees, and you will read in our books, that free mixing of the sexes is not encouraged.  Women stay with women-men with men.  In the temple room, women are to one side, men to the other.  This one simple thing prevents so many problems.  At first, reading about it, it sounded strange to me, but in practice, it feels good, and right.  So not only modest dress, but modest behaviour.  And it is important to remember, that what one culture may consider modest and appropriate is not modest for another.  But we should all support each other in our efforts to take the focus off our material bodies-because that's what modesty is, isn't it? A way to take the focus off this physical body, and a way to put focus on our true, spiritual selves.  We are modest because sexual attraction is the strongest attraction in this physical body, and it can be a downfall even for people who are very advanced on the path.  So we try to head off that attraction through dressing modestly and modest behaviour, to make it easier on ourselves and also on others.  Sex is a whole thorn bush on the road to Braj.  I still feel like this post is terribly convoluted and confused, but I won't rewrite it, because I know I'll lose something of it if I do.  I will try and be more to the point next time, but a lot of it is just having too much stuff going on in my head at once.  I received a very nice letter from a friend who's blog I read frequently thanking me for being a nurse.  You're welcome. :)  It's nice to hear nice things about nurses and the way nurses really do help people.  The fact that I'm a nurse doesn't automatically mean I'm a nice person, though.  (I *am* a nice person, but that's strictly coincidental.)  I know lots of nurses who aren't very nice.  I love to be a nurse-I don't really know how to be anything else.  Sometimes it's hard, though.  I haven't heard anything about that job from the other day, so I'm going to assume it was just the drugs talking :)  Haven't I written enough for one day?!  urlLink Email Me

      I know I've been focusing on mundane things lately.  I promise to get back to the real deal.  But first I wanted to share with you a little positive feedback I got.  This has been very important to me to hear because I've lost a lot of confidence since I've been out of the hospital.  Working with the IV team the other day was really good for me because it gave me the chance to relearn some skills I thought I had lost forever.  (I placed a 22ga line last night in someone's *thumb*.  I was like.. oh yeah, I rock.  ...I think only nurses may actually appreciate that, but I'm putting it in anyway.)  Anyway, I had lost a lot of confidence over the last five years.  A lot of it was lost right away when I worked in the doctor's office, but that's a tale of interpersonal difficulties best not rehashed.  So last night the following conversation took place: Patient's spouse:  Who's coming on after you tonight? Me: I'm not sure, I think it may be ___________. Patient's spouse:  Is she as good as you are, or do I need to stay the night?  Now, that may not seem like much to you, but it certainly did give me a bit of a glow.  One reason I am glad to be on twelve hour shifts instead of coming in at 11PM is because there will be more patient contact.  I remember that one thing I was very disappointed with towards the end of my last employment at the hospital was the lack of patient feedback.  This is mainly because if you're doing a good job, they sleep peacefully while you're there.  But I remember feeling hurt and left out when someone I'd worked with (or saved their life, even, quite literally) would be discharged and then send flowers and candy to the *second* shift nurses.  They didn't remember us on nights.  It seems dumb, but it still hurt.  Not that I want flowers and candy.  I don't.  But to hear, hey, thanks for what you did, you were great- that really makes a difference.  Maybe I shouldn't be so selfish.  Nursing's not about the money, and we try to be selfless, but it sure does help to hear from a patient that you made a difference.  Even if it's only once in a while.  You'd be amazed at how one little compliment can stay with someone for a lifetime.  *warning* imminent nostalgic anecdote *  I remember back when I was first a brand new nurse, and I had a patient up on the eighth floor that I just didn't feel good about.  I couldn't put my finger on anything specific, but I had a bad feeling.  Eventually it got strong enough that I decided to call the doctor, and since he was already up and making rounds, he wasn't angry at my lack of concrete details, but decided to come up and see the patient.  Fifteen minutes later, the patient was transferred to intensive care.  I still don't know exactly what the problem was, but whatever it was that I couldn't specify, it was real.  The part I remember most about this was the house supervisor.  She had heard about the situation and came up to me and said, "Hey.. you've got good instincts."  I was floored.  To get a compliment from a house super, when I was brand new, was like unbelievable.  I basically floated out of the hospital that day, and as you can see, almost ten years later, it's still very clear and present to me.    So think about what you say to people-not just in a nursing situation, but in any situation you come across.  You can make a huge impact on them without even realising it.  A positive comment-a sincere one-can really light up a person's life.  In my case, it really helped my confidence level and helped me learn to trust myself as a nurse.  These are the little moments that people don't even remember happened, but to the person they said it to, it's priceless.  Of course, the converse is also true-one negative statement, one cutting comment, can really wreck a person.  This is not to say that we should not correct people who need it or give direction, but that we should be careful that our words build up instead of tear down.  There are ways to help people constructively, without needing to hurt them or rip them up.  Learning to do this is a skill, and people who can master this skill are leaders.  Hare Krishna.   urlLink Email Me

      While at  urlLink work   today, I got a part time job.  Yeah, I know that sounds crazy.  I'm leaving details out til it's in cold cash.  Meanwhile, the hours are long and hard.  I am back to wearing a  urlLink cap.   Because Regents never designated a cap, we got to pick one out.  What fun that was!  The one I chose is  urlLink here.   The number is #7014.  Trust me, it's cuter in person.  Today's most frequent comment was: Aren't you CUTE!  Well, yeah.  But I think nurses ought to wear caps.  The reason is that patients love it.  They want us to look like Florence.  For me, that's enough reason.  (Although having it be cute helps.)  When you wear a cap, you look professional, you look traditional, and people know you're a nurse.  They like that.  I am going back to all dresses too-right now some people in Israel are working on making me some nice jumpers that you can't read the newspaper through.  I am also going to get some patterns for some nice modest dresses (I will talk more on modesty later) and make myself some nice white dresses for work.  (Hint: if you make them long enough, you don't need to wear pantyhose.)  I like being a nurse, but I also like dressing up like one.  I like to look feminine and pretty and old fashioned.  And my patients like it too.  So can anyone come up with a reason for me NOT to wear a cap?  (Hint:  talking to me about infection control doesn't work.  I don't work in the operating room.)  I think all nurses ought to wear their caps.  We worked hard enough for it-why not show it off?  urlLink Email Me

      Well, last week I baked a cake, and while I was trying to make it I found that I had a lot of trouble (and pain) while stirring it.  So it hasn't gotten better-in fact, it's gotten worse.  And after struggling through several days of work (I was pushing medications with my left hand, that's how bad it got), finally yesterday I went to the doctor.    To make a long story short, he's not exactly sure what's going on.  He thinks it's a combination of carpal tunnel and tendonitis, but in the big picture, he wants me to go see a surgeon.  So I'm going, probably somewhere around the 20th.  I actually have to call and reschedule it today, because I have to work on the 20th.  He wrote me a scrip for Darvocet that absolutely isn't helping, so I need to talk to him about that today, too.  So far nothing I've taken has helped.    Now, I have a good pain tolerance.  I'm not a crybaby.  In October of 2000, I fell and broke my ankle, and since I didn't have any insurance, I ended up waiting until January 23 of 2001 to see the doctor (the end result, by the way, was that I had to have surgery to put the ankle back together).  I'm not saying for people do actually do things like that- I did a lot of damage to my ankle that otherwise might not have happened.  But what I AM saying is that I'm not a crybaby.  So if I tell you I'm hurting, I really am, and in fact, the orthopedic guy who did my ankle surgery said that he felt that I didn't have enough pain sensation-ie., too much of a tolerance for pain.  Pain is a natural mechanism that lets you know there's something wrong.  Damage to tissues and bones-some process that isn't working properly-the body's response is pain, to give an alert to you (as we know, you are not the body) that something in your body isn't happening the way it should.  This way you know that you need to make some intervention to fix it.  The body is a machine.  It's the finest machine there is, and far better than anything we could ever create, but it is still a machine, a material creation that we use for a lifetime.  It has a beginning and an end, and as we come to learn over time, it's incredibly fragile.  The systems and processes that enable our bodies to function work within very circumscribed limitations, and millions and billions of adjustments are made by our bodies every day that we don't know about.  For example, let's look at potassium.  Potassium is a mineral salt that is vital to our existence.  It enables electrical currents in our body (yes, we produce electrical currents) to run properly.  We take in potassium through foods we eat, like bananas or oranges, and the proper concentration of potassium in our blood is controlled through our kidneys.  The amazing thing about potassium is that it has a very narrow therapeutic range.  The proper blood level of potassium is 3.5-5.5.  It's so critical to our health that if your potassium is 3.2 or 5.8, that's considered a "panic" level, and medical interventions need to be taken before your body begins to not be able to cope.  So constantly, every day, your body is monitoring and manipulating not only potassium levels, but levels of other minerals and electrolytes, and keeping them in proper proportion.  It's pretty amazing, far more amazing than anything we can create, but we have to always remember that our bodies are machines, just like that Jeep I have parked in the driveway.  They won't last forever, and they are prone to breakdown.  So I'm looking at possible surgery on my hand.  Unfortunately, it's my right hand.  If it were my left I think I could do without surgery, and manage things with therapy, splinting, medication.  But I have to have my right hand to work.  I'm a nurse.  You don't want me trying to place an IV line with my left hand.  I don't want to try to do that, either.    Holding my japa beads is also hard.  But I am experimenting with different positions of my hand in my beadbag and ways of supporting my wrist.  In other news, I spent yesterday with the IV team.  It was fun.   No, I didn't place any lines with my left hand.  I did have to have some help to unscrew things now and then.  My technique came right back despite it being nearly 6 years since I have had any real practice on it.    Since Dr. Sharma and I have become friends and are eating Indian food together in the mornings, more people have become interested in why and how I know to cook Indian food at all.  So we've been talking more about Krishna.  When I was with the IV team most of lunchtime was spent asking me questions about what I believe and why I believe it.  So even without me trying, Krishna is opening up opportunities for people to hear His name.  Jai Haribol!  I am still considering trying to make it up to Hillsborough before Tuesday, but on the other hand, I'm taking an awful lot of medication and I don't know that I want to be driving any long distances yet.  So we'll see what happens there.  urlLink Email Me

      Today I met a doctor at work who is of Punjabi origin.  She was very excited to meet me and instantly identified me as "a Hare Krishna".  Her family is Hindu and she personally is very devoted to Durga Ma.  I think she was very surprised to find me, just hanging out at the nurses station, but we had a very nice talk that ended with her saying that we should get together and have some kirtan and some bhajan and some lunch.. lol.. as if a resident has time for any of that, but I am hopeful that maybe we will.  At the very least, now one more person knows there are devotees of Krishna here.  Work is long-that whole 'twelve hours' thing is just propaganda.  It's more like fourteen.  Getting everything done in the time I have to do it (it's eight thirty now and I am cooking chickpeas to make chole for tomorrow's lunch) is pretty rough.  But I am working hard to keep everything in proper order, and leaving the rest of to Gurudeva and Krishna.  Jai Haribol!  Sri Sri Nitai Gaurachandra are the most beautiful and most merciful, and They smile down, refusing to see my millions of offenses and failures.  They are more merciful than I deserve, and I hope that someday I might be able to get just one drop of desire to serve Their lotus feet.   urlLink Email Me

      So this is the last day of the year. Time for some thoughts.    What have I done this year?  1. Settled down after a fifteen year search for spiritual truth and made a commitment to my religious beliefs. 2. Happily celebrated my eleventh wedding anniversary-to the same guy! 3. Had my name legally changed to my spiritual name (Satyavati devi dasi) 4. Moved into the second management position of my career. 5. Went back to school (for legal nurse consulting-I never talk about it, do I) 6. Celebrated the thirteenth year of my sobriety. 7. Learned how to blog and made some new friends doing it. 8. Protested Bush and all that he stands for.   What have I not done this year?  1. Lost weight. 2. Exercised at all (even for a minute.) 3. Gotten pregnant. 4. Overcome any of my phobias. 5. Been arrested.  Not so bad, eh?   urlLink Go have a peek at Sri-Sri Radha-Golokananda.   Scroll down until you see Their smiling faces.  It'll be the best thing you've done all year.  Plans for the Big End of Year Thing: Working.  It'll be the first year in many years I'll even be up to see it happen.  I believe in sleep, even if I haven't gotten that much of it today.

      The hardest thing about working nights is how thoroughly it screws me up.  I'm sleeping weird hours and trying to have a semblance of a normal life otherwise and it just doesn't work.  I mean, I get things done, but at three in the morning.  And it's hard to be motivated to do anything when it's just me awake.  Although Scott's here, I still don't feel like I spend a lot of time with him because a lot of it I'm asleep.  Ran into my old boss in Food Lion yesterday.  She said the administrator of the nursing home (who didn't much like me, btw) got fired and escorted out of the building that morning (yesterday morning).  Was I surprised? Only superficially.. I am a firm believer in 'what comes around, goes around'.  Also, I made a prediction right before I left that the ship was sinking and that the smart rat (ie, me) was jumping off before its tail got wet.  The new administrator-they were all prepared with a new administrator-is someone who's worked there before, so we'll see what happens next.  It doesn't affect me personally anymore, but it's still an interesting thing to watch.  My email program was down for about 36 hours after my mom sent me 16 MEGS of pictures from Christmas in one email.  I look tired in all of them.  Christmas was nice, though-we did it this past Saturday because that was when my sister could come to town.  Next year I think we'll do it at our house. I got my email back up and running (finally) and hopefully this won't happen again.  Well, it's a quarter to three AM and the temperature outside is 60.  I am thinking what I might do is get up, get dressed, and go for a japa walk.  It's a lot easier for me to chant with some concentration if I don't have that big beautiful TV staring at me.  As a rule I'm not a TV person but in the middle of the night I like to put in old Godzilla movies and knit.  So I feel like the neighbourhood is safe enough, at least on my street, and I can go out and chant a little and get some exercise too (though not much because I don't generally walk so fast when I'm busy chanting).

Establish a regular preaching schedule. 7. Stop procrastinating so much.  There's a problem with the comment script.  Can anyone help me fix it?

      I've done a little shuffling around over there on the right hand side of the window.  Some of the links are gone and there's some new ones over there.  One I'd like to draw your attention to is the one that says "Support Gurudeva's Preaching"  This link brings you to my Godbrother Visnujana's website.  He's done a beautiful job in putting together a very nice presentation of my spiritual master's activities and made it very simple for people to help support those activities. People don't really understand the whole 'wandering mendicant' concept.  It's not a real 'American' or even 'Western' mindset, but the concept is very common in Eastern countries.  Buddhist monks go out every day to collect alms from the people in their area, generally in the form of food donations.  In India, this is called madhukari.  The idea is that since these holy persons have renounced everything, they depend on the Lord to provide for even their most basic needs of food and water.  Feeding the sadhus (holy persons) is a meritorious activities, and even in lots of scriptures you'll see it enjoined that one should 'feed the brahmanas'. Srila Gurudeva hasn't got a home.  This is another concept that's real foreign to a western mind.  He travels constantly, and only stays in a place for a few days at most.  His whole activity is based around preaching.  Right now he's in Australia.  Then, he'll be in South Africa for a few days, then to Poland, and then for his annual tour of the US, that lasts a little over a month.  From there, it's back to Poland.  He'll only be in North Carolina for two or three days at most.  Sometimes I try and imagine how it would be to constantly be traveling.  I think I'd spend all my time totally disoriented and confused not knowing where I was.  But he is so focused on preaching that honestly, I don't think he cares where he is, as long as he's engaged in serving Srila Prabhupada and Lord Caitanya. So anyway.  Traveling costs money, and so do all the different activities of preaching-setting up accomodations, making arrangements, paying bribes-in some countries, this is a common and accepted way of doing business!  The Polish preaching tour reaches literally hundreds of thousands of people every year.  Unbelievable amounts of prasadam are distributed-100,000 plates in three days!  That is not a typo or an exaggeration-100 THOUSAND plates of pure vegetarian food, distributed at absolutely no cost.  Something like 92 TONS of food has to be obtained, cooked, offered, and is then distributed.  I can't even imagine this sort of scale.  Prasadam is food that's been offered to Krishna, and it carries amazing spiritual benefit. So many times people have told me how inspired they are by Srila Gurudeva's preaching.  I'm sure for lots of these people, if they knew a way to help make some tangible contribution, they would.  So Visnujan has set this up.  It's very easy and quick with no trouble at all, and I hope that many people take advantage of this opportunity to provide some support for these preaching efforts that are making a very visible and real difference in the world. Finding one's spiritual master is a process that can take lifetimes, and once found, is someone that you have a relationship with forever, eternally.  My personal prayer is to always be Gurudeva's disciple, life after life.  The spiritual master is like a father, but more so, if that makes any sense.  There is, of course, an emotional relationship between biological family, and I love my family very much.  But we come to understand through Krishna Consciousness that since we are all eternal spirit souls, what we consider 'family' relationships are temporary, for one lifetime.  A father is concerned with providing for the needs of his family-putting a roof over head, food on the table, etc.  Without taking anything away from that, the spiritual master is concerned with eternal matters-taking his disciples back to Krishna.  So it's the same thing, only more so.  Does that make sense? Anyway, I wanted to point out the changes I'd made.  Visit Visnujan's website.  It's very nicely done, and I hope everyone considers taking advantage of the opportunity to support the sincere preaching effort that's going on every day.   urlLink ');"> postCount(' ');

      Well, it was only a matter of time before they found Mad Cow disease in the USA.  Now here it is.  Could this be a warning to people not to eat cows?    Vegetarians aren't going to get mad cow disease.  It's so clear.  But people continue to do sin by killing and eating cows, and so they end up participating in all the negative karma attached to it.   If we can just move away from this culture of death and into the mode of goodness, we'd see these things disappear, and the whole world would become more peaceful.

      I love mornings.  I love the sunshine.  Even though it's cold out, I wish I could go sit out there in the sun.  I just might. I wrote a long letter to Gurudeva yesterday.  I hope I hear back from him soon.  I don't write him too often because I know how busy he is with traveling and all the things he has to do.  At the same time, I feel a lot of seperation.  So I write every couple of months or so. I'd like to get a script or something so I can add a comment link to my blog instead of this email link.

      As a nurse, I sometimes have to deal with death.  This is an important reminder.  We always think we're invincible, that it won't happen to us, but it will.   There's no getting out of it.  The best we can do is try to be prepared.  And the only way to be prepared is to understand now, while we can, that we are not this body, that our eternal position is that of Krsna's servant, that we have to approach a bonafide spiritual master for guidance in spiritual life, and that we must always, at all times, remember Krsna.  By chanting  His holy names we can remember Him.  And at the moment of death, through our long practice, we can hopefully chant Hare Krsna.   Death is a pretty traumatic change for the spirit soul in the body.  At that time, the physical body is breaking down, not responding, and we will have to work hard to remember Krsna.  Having already had long practice in chanting Hare Krsna, hopefully we will be able to at the moment of death.   urlLink Email Me

      Had a rough night last night, but I'm finally starting to feel like I'm having a bit of an adjustment to nights.  I can see that some things really haven't changed in five years (both about the hospital and about me) and that I need to keep my mouth kind of shut until my 90 days are up.  I think I must have been Jimmy Hoffa in a past life.  Was I born to be a labour leader?  All my life I've taken up for the cause, spearheaded revolutions (even if they were just revolutions in an office) and put myself out on the line for what I believe to be truth and justice.  I've had to go through a lot of personal anguish for it, too.  But sometimes you just have to do it. North Carolina is one of the few remaining 'right to work' states, which means in a nutshell that if you work at any big company, simply saying the words 'union' or 'organise' are generally enough to get you sent off to the Employment Securities Commission.  Now, being from New York originally, I think the union spirit is just in my blood.  Yes, yes, I know that unions have both good and bad sides.  But I also believe that workers need advocacy and a way to stand up for themselves on their own terms, not just on the terms the company sets up for them.  Lots of different propaganda can be arranged to pacify workers and make them think they have a true voice, but a union is a force outside of the company that requires dealing with. When one major company controls virtually all of a given industry in a geographic area, the workers find themselves at a severe disadvantage.  Forced by economic reality to the one major company, they essentially sacrifice any bargaining power they may have had with their specialised skills.  Are you following me here?  For example, let's say I own Mighty Metal in Dullsville, USA.  My company hires skilled metalworkers.  There is no other company for 100 miles in any direction that hires skilled metalworkers.  The local metalworkers find themselves at a loss-they can either commute 200 miles a day (which, of course, some will do), or they can come to my company and take what I give them.  Because they're not union metalworkers, I can basically set the terms as I wish-how much they will be paid, what kind of benefits they can have, etc.  Smaller machine shops in the area can't compete with the wages I pay, so workers who decide they can't live with my terms have to take a beating in pay and benefits to work elsewhere.  Are you with me here?  Because of the economic reality of having only one major employer that pays anything near a decent wage, these skilled metalworkers are afraid to try and unionize or organize.  Forbidden to do so by the company, they fear losing their jobs, which, even though they aren't great or what the workers actually deserve, are still better than what they can get elsewhere.  This is taking place in America, people.  Do you really wonder why I'm a socialist?  Put the power in the hands of the workers, instead of making them suffer the whims of an economic power.  This is the reality of the world we live in.  Maybe it's time to do something real about it.  urlLink Email Me

      Tired.  Hoping I get adjusted and establish some kind of schedule or routine.  I feel like I've been hit by a truck most of the time lately.  It's kind of depressing.  I know my mood hasn't been so great.  I am going to figure out a way to work around this.  It's just going to take a little time to get straight.  urlLink Email Me

      This flipping the schedule over has me all confused.  I'm sleeping and waking with no apparent rhyme or reason.  I'm hoping I will eventually get situated but right now it's really, really, not good.  This is just another sacrifice on the way to Hillsborough.  Working nights adds several thousand dollars a year to my annual salary.  That money is helping us get to where we need to go.  I'm planning on going to Hillsborough next weekend.  Originally I was going to go up and stay Friday night and Saturday night, but now I think I'll just stay Saturday night.  It's going to be too hard to come home from work and get myself up there.  So I'll go up on Saturday.  Working nights means that even though I am working Monday next week, I can still stay late at the temple for the feast without having to run like I usually do.  So at least that's good.  I am busy lately working on Srila Gurudeva's sweater again.  I had to put it down for a little while because I was having a lot of problems following the pattern, but I am back with determination to it and it seems to be going well.  The thing I am most excited about wth this sweater is that it is a pale peachy colour that will go perfectly with his saffron clothes.  It's an unusual colour to find.  Even better-the colour is a 'no-dye-lot' colour so I don't have to worry if I run out.  The pattern is a pretty complicated Aran but it ought to be very warm when it's done, and the yarn is a nice soft acrylic that will hold up to washing and not give any trouble.  So I sit and knit, sometimes lately at 3AM as I am struggling with my body clock, and think about Srila Gurudeva and his busy schedule, and all the places he goes where it's so terribly cold.  Right now he's in the middle east, which is of course very dangerous lately and even more so for someone preaching Krishna Consciousness.  His travels there are so dangerous that he doesn't even mention in his diary exactly where he goes.  Lord Nrsimhadeva watches very carefully over His pure devotee though, and keeps him safe.  Jai Nrsimhadev!  Jai Gurudev!  So I am hoping that he will enjoy his sweater and that it will help to keep him warm on all his travels.  My keyboard is acting up badly but soon I also need to write to HH Prahladananda Maharaj about the nursing home project.  I got some information on the whole startup procedure.  It looks to me like we'll need to hire a developer.  It seems to be awfully complicated.  I don't have any doubts that  it'll happen, though.. maybe not in Hillsborough, but I do believe it will happen.  Krishna will take care of everything.     urlLink Email Me

      Since I am working today and so not able to be participating in any celebrations (except my own) for Gita Jayanti I've decided on doing a couple of little things (besides blog).  I'm donating a copy of Bhagavad gita As It Is to the AHEC library here at the hospital.  I saw on the shelves they had the Bible and the Koran so it will fit in very nicely there.  Also, I am going to try and distribute some books for the December marathon.  I am not in a situation where I can go out in the public and really do major book distribution (it can be a bit dangerous for a woman by herself) but I am going to try and distribute the rest of the case of Gitas that I have and see if I can't distribute some cookbooks as well.  I received a very nice letter from a bhakta in Indiana who is interested in more strictly following the four regs and he has requested a cookbook so that's very nice as well. It is so important for us to keep the faith no matter what disturbances arise.  Everything that happens to us, Krishna knows about.  Sometimes we have some karmic debt to pay off, or sometimes it's just a test of our determination and faith.  We just have to keep going.  Ultimately, everything we do in Krishna consciousness has eternal standing.  If we don't do everything in this life, we will still come back in the next life and pick up where we left off.  Something my dear Srila Gurudeva wrote in his last diary entry reminds me of this:  When these disciples are sometimes overcome by the strong force of the material energy, I must practice tolerance and patience in my dealings with them, like a father with his children. While in Russia, I learned of one disciple who, in a moment of spiritual weakness, joined the Russian mafia for quick money. Through bad association he gradually gave up his spiritual practices. He lost his intelligence and engaged in many criminal activities. One day he ran away in fear, with the mafia in close pursuit. He managed to elude them for some time, but fearing they might find him, he robbed a bank and let himself be caught. Now he sits in jail in relative safety. Recently he wrote that he is chanting again and asked for spiritual guidance.   So we are not alone in our struggles, and we are neither the first nor the last  have these struggles.  All we can do is our very best to continue to chant, and take advantage of the spiritual guidance we have available to us.  We can read Bhagavad gita.  We can listen to classes and lectures by senior devotees.  We can, sometimes, when we are able, take the association of other devotees, whether tangibly in person or virtually online.  We have many books written that we can study and learn.  We have our japa beads, and we can chant, and thus directly take the association of Krishna through the guru-parampara.  We are never alone. Sometimes it's so easy to feel alone.  I fall into that trap a lot-'oh, I am so far away, whine, whine, there are no devotees here but me, how can I do anything'.  You can even hear it in the first paragraph-my excuse for not going out on book distribution.  But are we ever REALLY alone?  Don't we have Srila Prabhupada with us?  Don't we have Sri Guru with us?  Isn't Lord Caitanya present along with Lord Nityananda when we perform kirtan?  And isn't Krsna Himself present in every Holy Name?  So we are not really alone, not really.  We just feel alone, and that is a trick of material nature to get us to give up.  So now that we understand the trick, we can see through it, and conquer it.  Srila Prabhupada said this:   Don't be afraid of my being attacked by maya. When there is fight between two belligerent parties, it is always expected that there will sometimes be reverses. Your country and the western world is mostly under the grip of Maya and the modes of nature in passion and ignorance, and my declaration of war against the maya is certainly a great battle.  (letter 8/3/67)  Every one of us is under the influence of the external energy, Maya. The best way to get out of the clutches of Maya is to concentrate our attention in the loving service of Krishna.  (letter 11/18/67)  So there it is from the best authorities we have-stay strong, keep the faith, and never stop chanting. Bhagavad gita ki jai!  urlLink Email Me

      Today I have mostly slept, woke up long enough to chant a little.  I don't know why all this sleeping but I can't seem to help it.  I am still in a good bit of pain.  Typing is hard but not impossible.  New links on the right there.  Please take a moment to visit.  Tomorrow I have to try and get a phone number for some devotees in Graham, NC to talk about Gurudeva's spring schedule.  Also, I've announced that I am putting together a Vyasapuja book for him.  I hope some people want to contribute.  Also, I have to learn how to knit again with this hand-I HAVE to get working on Gurudeva's sweater!  The percocet I'm taking really screws me up but nothing's working for the pain except that.  I did manage to brush my hair out myself and got it braided up with a bit of help.  Two braids is easier than one right now.    Otherwise everything is okay.  I wish I wasn't so persistently tired.  Must just be catching up.  urlLink ');"> postCount(' ');

                               Volume 5, Chapter 12                 December 18, 2003 - January 30, 2004                        "Hankering for Home"  Early last December, I was at the airport in Warsaw, checking in for a flight, when I heard someone call out, "Hari Bol!" I looked up and saw that it was a stewardess passing by with a flight crew. I was busy at the ticket counter, so I just smiled back.  I was on my way to London, where I would catch a connecting flight to an Islamic country. An hour later as I entered the plane, I saw the same stewardess, and she greeted me again with a cheerful "Hari Bol!"  "Hari Bol!" I answered. I looked at her badge and saw that she was the chief purser.  After we were airborne she came by and sat on the armrest of the seat directly across the aisle from me. A few passengers raised their eyebrows, but she was not disturbed. "I can afford it," she said. "I've been with the company for twenty years. I'm retiring next month."  "Congratulations," I said.  Her face became more serious. "You know," she said,  "I was married to a Hare Krsna devotee when I was young."  My own eyebrows went up. "Oh really?" I said.  "Yes," she answered, "but he'd left the movement by the time we met. He was a disciple of the founder, Swami Prabhupada. He referred to his departure as blooping."  "Yes," I said, "that's the sound an object makes when it falls into the ocean. When a devotee leaves the movement and falls back into the ocean of material existence, we call it blooping."  "Well he certainly struggled with his decision to leave," she said. "He didn't actually tell me that he had been a devotee until late into our marriage. For years I saw him wrestle with conflicting interests. On the one hand he had a deep interest in spiritual things, but on the other he had an uncontrollable urge to enjoy the material.  "One night we got drunk, and on an impulse he took me to your center outside of London, the place George Harrison bought you. I don't remember much, but when he started to cry in front of the altar, we were asked to leave. It's the only time I ever visited one of your temples.  "As time went on, my husband succumbed to his material passions and started to take drugs. In a desperate move to help him, I got the principal book of your faith, the Bhagavad-gita As It Is from a friend. My husband had spoken of it many times. I must have read that book ten times cover to cover, hoping to learn what had once satisfied the soul of my husband.  "As I learned the Gita I began sharing my understanding with him, wanting to revive his faith. I even memorized certain verses and would repeat them when he was really down and out. As his drug addiction deepened and he began stealing to maintain it, I often searched feverishly through the Gita, looking for passages or words of advice that would turn him away from his decadence.  "But it was of no avail. After some time the combination of drugs, internal conflicts, and pressures of life caused him to go mad, totally mad. I had to commit him to a mental hospital. He has never recovered and is still there to this day."  She had been speaking with emotion, and several other passengers were listening in. They looked as amazed as I must have.  "It was a painful loss for me," she continued, "and I never remarried."  Then she put her hand on my shoulder. "But do you know how I survived that and many other trials in my life?" she asked.  "How?" I asked, almost on behalf of the other passengers listening in.  "The philosophy of the Bhagavad-gita," she said with a relieved smile. "I still read the Gita every day. It's in my carry-on luggage up front. If it weren't for that book, I'd probably be in the same madhouse as my former husband."  "I'll be retiring soon and plan to buy a little house in Wales," she continued. "And you know how I'll spend much of my time?"  "No, Ma'am," I said. "How?"  "Reading the Bhagavad-gita," she replied.  Suddenly the flight ran into turbulence and the "fasten seatbelt" light came on. The stewardess nodded a little to confirm her last statement, and got up to go. As she was leaving, I called out to her. "Ma'am," I said, "can I have the address of the mental hospital? I'd like to try and help your former husband."  She shook her head. "No," she said, "I can't do that."  "Please," I said. "It's important to me. He's my spiritual brother."  "I'm sorry" she replied, and she turned to walk down the aisle. "I wouldn't want to open that chapter of my life again."  When the plane landed and the passengers began to disembark she was standing at the door, smiling politely as we filed out. I stopped and gently tried to encourage her to tell me where her previous husband was, but she wouldn't give in.  "Move on!" a man shouted behind me.  I thanked the stewardess for sharing her story with me, but I walked out of the plane with mixed emotions. I was elated to have met someone who had found such shelter in the teachings of Bhagavad-gita, but distraught to hear how another, a Godbrother, in fact, had failed miserably to do the same.  In a men's room in Heathrow Airport, I changed from my devotional clothes into something more Western and waited to board my connecting flight. I felt a bit uncomfortable, as I had to remove my neck beads and Brahmin thread and replace it all with a New York Yankees baseball cap.  I was on my way to one of the more conservative Islamic states, and in order to understand the country more, I had bought a book on Shariah, the Islamic law that governs strict Muslim societies. As the flight took off and I started reading, some of the laws raised my eyebrows again, more than once.  Shariah states that a murderer must be killed in the same way that he murdered but can be set free if the bereaved family agrees to take some money instead of having the murderer killed.  A thief must have his hand cut off, and if he steals again, he will lose the other hand plus a foot.  A man may keep four wives but cannot keep two sisters as wives.  Women must be fully covered at all times except in the privacy of their homes.  I began to realize the strictness of the country I was entering, and as we were landing, I pushed my Nrsimha salagram deeper into my bag, hoping that if I was searched, the customs officials wouldn't find Him.  It didn't work. After clearing immigration, I approached customs control and was stopped by two women in burkas, the full black dress worn by Muslim women with even the eyes covered by a black veil. The women asked me to step to one side. Then two men in starched white robes came over and asked me to put all my belongings onto a table. As I laid my saffron cloth out they looked surprised, but when I put my Srimad Bhagavatam on the table their eyes opened even wider.  "What is this?" the man asked in broken English.  "A storybook," I replied.  "What is in the shoulder bag?" he asked.  "Not much" I replied, pretending I didn't know he wanted to see it.  "Put it on the table," he said.  I had no choice, and after a few moments they were inspecting my japa beads, and to my horror, my Nrsimha salagram.  "My Lord," I prayed silently, "please forgive me."  One of the customs officials started to smell the salagram. "What is it?" he asked.  I was so distraught I couldn't reply.  "What is it?" he repeated impatiently.  "What does it look like?" I said, not wanting to further my grief by having to refer to the salagram in some mundane way, and in front of the Lord Himself.  "It looks like a stone," he said.  "So?" I replied.  And he put Him back in the bag.  They seemed eager to inspect the rest of my belongings, but suddenly another official came up. "Are you a soldier?" he asked me.  I saw my way out of the predicament. "Yes, sir" I replied with confidence thinking back on my days as a marine. "Lance Corporal Tibbitts. First Infrantry Battalion, United States Marine Corps. My company is on duty in this region."  "Fine," he replied. Then he turned to the other men. "Let him go," he said.  As I walked out of the airport, loudspeakers from nearby mosques reminded the faithful that it was time to bow toward Mecca, and a number of men spread their rugs on the ground to pray. I even saw several cars stop and men get out on the sidewalk to bow.  My contact picked me up, and we drove to the place where I would be staying. As in other strict Islamic states, I noticed the streets were clean and everything seemed orderly. Bars, discotheques, and nightclubs were conspicuous by their absence, and men and women did not mix freely. It was easy to distinguish the two: the men wore bright starched white robes, and a number of women wore dark black burkas, covering them from head to toe.  "Put your baseball cap back on," my host said as we pulled up to his house.  "It's only a few meters to the front door," I said, a little surprised.  "It only takes one complaint here," he said soberly.  Programs were held in the evening in different houses, quietly, behind closed doors that blocked any noise. I was told that programs were not forbidden but any excess would not be tolerated.  During my visit, I favored lecturing more than kirtan. I had plenty to say because I had plenty of time to study. Confined to my room and not able to wander outside freely, I managed to read Teachings of Lord Caitanya from cover to cover in 7 days.  I wasn't used to being inside all day, though, and at one point I became restless, almost desperate. "I'd like to go home," I said out loud to myself one morning.  But then I looked in the mirror and scolded myself. "Home?" I asked. "A home? You're in the renounced order. You should be ashamed of yourself!" Then I imposed a small punishment on myself for my momentary lack of sannyasa dharma. "Tomorrow," I vowed, "I will fast all day."  The day after my fast,  my host came and said that we were going to drive out of town for a program with workers from India. "Laborers from abroad?" I thought. "Sounds like it will be a real simple program."  As we drove through the countryside, I noticed many date trees lining the road. My host turned to me. "Shariah states that you can receive a huge fine for indiscriminately cutting down a date tree," he said.  "Really?" I replied.  "Yes," he said, "and God forbid if you hit a camel with your car. They are a protected species here. And if you do hit a camel, you'll get instant karma. They are so top-heavy, with their long spindly legs and heavy bodies, that they immediately come through the windshield. Many people have died in that way."  "That's interesting," I said.  My host turned to me with a puzzled look. "Interesting?" he said.  "Not interesting in the sense of entertaining," I said, "but in a curious way."  His misunderstanding of my comment only added to the frustration I was feeling from living in isolation, and I was feeling the rigors of my self-imposed fast the day before. "I'd sure like to be in Vrindavan right now," I said to myself.  We pulled up to an old warehouse. "I'll make this real quick," I thought.  I pulled my Yankee baseball cap squarely over my forehead, adjusted my belt, jumped out of the car, and walked quickly towards the entrance before any of the locals would notice me, as was the usual procedure.  As I entered the reception office, I was surprised to hear a wonderful Bengali kirtan tape over the sound system. "Sounds from the spiritual sky," I said to myself. "It's almost like being in Mayapura." I closed my eyes and paused for a moment to take in the auspicious sound.  My host took my arm. "Let's move into the main room," he said. Reluctantly, I tore myself away from my brief moment in the spiritual world.  But what a wonderful surprise was waiting for me! As I opened the door, I was stunned to see a group of 40 Bengali men, many in dhoti and kurta, playing mrdangas and kartalas while chanting the holy names and dancing in ecstasy. It wasn't a tape I had heard after all. It was a live kirtan.  A devotee was singing and the others responded:  "Gaurangera duti pada, jar dhana sampada, se jane bhakati-rasa-sar"  It was Savarana-Sri-Gaura-Mahima (The Glories of Sri Gauranga), a song from Narottam das Thakur's Prarthana: "Anyone who has accepted the two lotus feet of Lord Caitanya can understand the true essence of devotional service."  "Gaurangera madhura-lila" The lead singer sang loudly, "Jar karne prabesila, hrdoya mirmala bhelo tar"  And again came a chorus of voices in their mother tongue:  "Anyone who has accepted the two lotus feet of Lord Caitanya can understand the true essence of devotional service."  With their arms upwards and their eyes to the sky they sang:  "Je gaurangera nama loy tara hoy premodoy, tare mui jai bolihari"  "One who simply takes the holy name of Gaurasundara, Sri Krsna Caitanya, will immediately develop love of God. To such a person I say, 'Bravo! Very nice! Excellent!'"  The men were dancing gracefully, and their faces and movements were full of feeling. They were so absorbed in kirtan rasa that they didn't notice I'd come in.  Suddenly they saw me, and they all dove in front of me, offering obeisances. I stood there embarrassed, feeling unworthy of the attention of men who displayed such feeling for Lord Caitanya.  One of them handed me a drum and I started to sing slowly,  "sri-krsna-caitanya prabhu doya koro mor, toma bine ke doyalu jagat-somsare"  "My dear Lord Sri Krsna Caitanya Mahaprabhu, please be merciful to me, because who can be more merciful than Your Lordship within these three worlds?"  Oblivious to where we were, we dove again and again into the nectar of chanting the holy names for over an hour. Though we were strangers, the joy of the kirtan made us one spiritual family, and we chanted and danced with abandon, as if we had known each other for years.  After bringing the kirtan to a close, I asked them to suggest a subject for my talk. A small chorus of men spoke up. "Speak about Gauranga Mahaprabhu," they said almost in unison.  So I told about the pastime of Lord Caitanya's taking sannyasa. When I got to the part about the barber cutting Mahaprabhu's beautiful long black hair, several of the men had tears in their eyes.  After an hour, I concluded, and because it was getting late I stood up, but they immediately put a mrdanga in my hands. "More kirtan!" they said. "More kirtan!"  "Who has come to enliven whom?" I thought. "These men are very merciful to me."  Again we had kirtan and then relished a traditional Bengali feast, complete with Lord Caitanya's favorite preparation, a leafy vegetable called sak. At the end, I was inundated with Bengali sweets.  In the three hours I spent with those men I learned an important lesson. In their association I became oblivious to the discomforts of being in a foreign land and felt perfectly at home, in a spiritual atmosphere. I realized that although my preferred places of residence, the holy lands of Vrindavan and Mayapura, were far away in India, they are in fact manifested wherever devotees are chanting the Lord's holy names. It was a valuable lesson and one I pray I will not forget.  "When Krishna descended on the earth, He appeared in Vrindavan. Although I am presently living in America, my residence is in Vrindavan, because I am always thinking of Krishna. Although I may be in a New York apartment, my consciousness is there, and this is as good as living there."

      So this is being typed very slowly.  I had quite the experience yesterday.  First, the OR nurse was very nice, but not a good stick.  I had to have 2 operational iv lines, 1 in eadh hand.  Then I got some antibiotics.  When it was time to go, they gave me a little Versed.  Not a lot.  So in the OR first thimg is the shot my hand full of lidocaine.  Now how is it that something that numbs you hurts so bad while it works.  It hurt like hell.  Then they take this big rubber band and wrap it around the hand moving back to the elbow, squeezing all the blood out, then they put on a tourniquet.  At this point he gave se some fentanyl and wooooooo out I went.  So I woke up before it was over, and i was watching the monitors.  I was breathing 10x a minute and my bp was 102/56.  You can't see them working because of how you are draped.  So I was trying to wiggle my fingers and couldn't and I was getting very restless so he said, "Wanna go back to sleep?" and I said yes and he gave me a little more fentanyl.  The anaesthesia was great, recovery was very fast.  I woke up with this enormous club of a bandage snd was getting dressed by 8:15.    Three of my fingers are still numb, which worries me, but otherwise it just hurts per normal.  On Monday they will take the club off.  I just took some more percocet, and I think I am going to get a snack.  Look, a lot of people visit this blog everyday, what is the matter with yall that only 1 person ever leaves a good word?  Yall like vampires and ingrates.  Click on the link and leave a comment for the love a Pete.  It would make me happy.   urlLink ');"> postCount(' ');

      I got home about 2345 and got in the bed about 0045 but I haven't been able to sleep.  I'm nauseous, and I just can't get myself to relax.  I gave up altogether about twenty minutes ago, and just decided to go ahead and get ready.  It wouldn't be quite so bad if my stomach wasn't upset, but I'm NPO and I can't even have any coke syrup on it.    So my options for anaesthesia are: local, IV regional, or (I think) conscious sedation.  I really, really don't think I want to be alert and oriented for this.  Being a nurse, I just think I'd freak out if I heard someone say 'oops'.  You know?  So I am going to ask for some ativan or something.  I don't want demerol.. I just don't really want to hear anything they're going to say.    I know I'm being melodramatic but I just keep worrying.  My wrists are so small-really they are the smallest part of me- just under 6", and I keep thinking that he just won't have enough room to get around and do what he needs to do, or even worse, that he'll nick something accidently because the quarters are so cramped.  I know I am being paranoid.  I get a little bit like this before every surgery, pretty much.  I think this one is worse than my ankle surgery because I had been in so much pain for so many months before that one, and because I keep thinking.. oops my mom is here.. got to go.    urlLink ');"> postCount(' ');

      I went to the local Saigon Market today.  I like this place because very few of the things they sell are in English.  Basically, they stock things from Japan, China, Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia, Mexico, India, and various Indonesian places.  I get all my Indian stuff there (because the nearest Indian store is in Raleigh) and I always like to have an adventure.  It's more difficult now because I don't eat meat, etc., so I have to read labels, but it's always kind of exciting to find things you aren't quite sure what to do with.  (Okay, so my thrill threshold is lower than yours.)  Today I found some spring roll wrappers (these are NOT like the Nasoya ones you buy in the regular grocery store), some Japanese rice seasoning (there is a name for this that I forget) that has seaweed in it, a huge bag of basmati, black sesame oil, tapioca, and a huge economy size Kikkoman Lite soy sauce bottle.  I usually get Japanese rice crackers too, but they seemed to be all out.   I've always been kind of adventurous in food, which is bad for my husband, because he's not.  However, in the 13 years we've been together he's made some remarkable leaps of faith in the dining room.  I like to make a lot of things from scratch-bread, pie, jelly/jam, pickles.. I've even made homemade ravioli and pasta.  For me it's more about the fun of it than anything else.  There's something very satisfying in making a loaf of bread, or canning vegetables.  It's a sort of self-sufficiency thing.  I've made soap too, which is a bit harder and definitely more dangerous if you are really making soap (as opposed to melting down glycerine soap and molding it), because you have to use lye and so on, and the measurements must be very accurate or you're just left with one incredibly gloppy mess.  Of course, I also knit and sew.  I knit MUCH better than I sew, but I am equally enthusiastic for both.  Years ago I also used to do things like cross stitch, crewel, and embroidery, but I've tended to get away from the decorative stuff and into the more 'necessities' like sweaters, socks, and mittens.  Now, you might argue that since you can easily buy these things, it's not a necessity, but again, it comes down to a self-sufficiency thing.  Plus, my socks are really nice and warm.  And there's nothing better than a handmade sweater (if it's nicely made and doesn't look like it's made for Andre the Giant).  Anyway, it's a sunny day, but still cold and quite windy.  I have to work tonight from 7-11, which is almost worthless but I said I'd do it.  It's going to be a long day tomorrow, I think, but I got some good news: the hospital has some kind of discount towards the copayment thing of my surgery, and I am not sure how much that discount is, but potentially this could save us $500.  So I'm going to pursue that tonight and see what happens.  I got my clicker today.  Chant Hare Krishna, and be happy.   urlLink ');"> postCount(' ');

      I have a lot of different things rolling around in my head tonight.  I did get called off from work (low census) but I'm on call until 11pm.  This means that if they get slammed with admissions, they'll call me and I'll have to go in.  At least it gives me a bit of a break.  We watched "The Hunt For Red October" for at least the 65th time tonight.  Besides it being a great movie (based on a great book by a great writer, Tom Clancy), it had great music.  This led me to thinking how many submarine movies have really great music.  It can't be a coincidence.  Basil Polidorous wrote that great anthem that they sing all through Red October ("The Hymn to Red October") and it just has such a majestic, imperial feel to it.  Another great sub movie that happens to have great music is U-571.  While I enjoyed watching this movie, I like listening to it from another room better.  The theme score really got me right away.  To me, music is at least as important as the movie itself.  A third sub movie with great music is Crimson Tide, and at this point I have to assume it's not a coincidence.  If I had to choose one piece of music from a movie for an "All Time Great" award, it would have to be the choral bit from Lord Of The Rings just as they're escaping the Mines of Moria.  I've seen LOTR at least (no bull) 80 times by now, and every single time that music begins, just over the bridge of Khazad-dhum, I cry.  Every single time.  You'd think I'd get immune to it, but somehow, that boy's voice just rips me apart.  I can't even understand it myself.  What key is it in?  Does anyone know?  I've said before, there's not many movies I can watch because of the ADHD.  There are a few, though, that if I like them, I'll sit through them again and again.  Generally I don't like movies that have a lot of sex in them or bad language (with the notable exception of the Die Hard movies, which I absolutely loved because I think Bruce Willis is just so natural) and I don't like violence very much.  My husband is a great movie watcher and basically screens movies for me before I ever get to them.  Sometimes even movies that are considered to be 'great' are movies I just can't get through-like Private Ryan.  Some movies that seem to be very innocuous have a huge, profound effect on me that lasts days or weeks, like Full Metal Jacket, and The Long Kiss Goodnight, which both gave me nightmares for weeks.  And Disney movies I inevitably cry through.  So go figure.  The Indiana Jones movies are a good example of the kind of movie I like.  Lots of action and movement, not a lot of the nasty stuff, a laugh now and then and good special effects.  My  urlLink Guru Maharaj  is sometimes compared to Indiana Jones because of the dangerous places and situations he gets himself into.  He's absolutely fearless when it comes to preaching, and really takes huge risks (like slipping over hostile international borders in the middle of the night without a visa and in disguise) to spread the Holy Name.  His diary reads like a cliffhanger novel.   urlLink You can read it here.    I definitely recommend it.  It doesn't matter if you're a devotee or even a believer.  An adventure is an adventure no matter what.  Although I read a lot, I don't read a lot of fiction.  I am exceptionally picky about what I read, and my tastes have changed over the years.  When I was a teenager I was hopelessly addicted to Stephen King, but as I grew older I don't know if his writing changed or if my taste did.  I think Misery was the last good book I read by him.  I also used to read other gory horror writers, but I sort of just moved beyond.  Here is my current list of people you can depend on for a good fiction:  1.  JRR Tolkien : The Hobbit, The Lord of the Rings trilogy.  What more can I say?  I've read these books annually for about 20 years now. 2.  Michael Crichton : Jurassic Park, Eaters of the Dead (later filmed as The 13th Warrior), Airframe.  I will read anything this man writes.  His style is absolutely addictive. 3.  James Michener :Hawaii, South Pacific, Caravans, Chesapeake, Alaska, Poland.  Everything this man writes is a monument.  Is it fact or fiction?  The lines become blurred.  It's kind of awesome to think how much he must know to write the way he does.  The books are oh so long, but very much worth it. 4.  HP Lovecraft : At the Mountains of Madness, various collections of short stories and creator of the whole Cthulu Mythos.  Quaint and predictable in style (how many wealthy semi-invalid antiquarian men in their early 20's can there be?), they still manage to capture my imagination. 5.  AA Milne :Very few things are better than an afternoon in Hundred Acre Wood with Pooh and Piglet. 6.  Lewis Carroll : Alice, the Duchess, the Hunting of the Snark, Jabberwocky.  Carroll defined nonsense in a Victorian world. 7.  Dr. Seuss : Poetry, story, cartoon, or social commentary?  The works of Dr. Seuss are lyric.  They beg to be read out loud, and over and over.  The illustrations are a joy but beyond that, their simple music bring me a smile no matter how many times I've recited it.  "I meant what I said and I said what I meant, an elephant's faithful one hundred percent."  Even people who hate poetry love Dr. Seuss.  He REdefined nonsense-for the twentieth century.  Made a very nice supper of scrambled tofu.   urlLink Fantastic Foods  makes a lot of great products that are all vegan.  If you find them in your local grocery store, give them a try, because there aren't many options out there for vegetarians and vegans.  Did you know that Morningstar Farms products contain egg whites?  How dare they market as vegetarian!  Anyway, it's very misleading, so always read your labels.

      I hate feeling like an idiot.  I felt like one this morning when the cable guy showed up.  Now, we have sattelite, but we don't get local channels (yet, they say) and you know the Superbowl's comin up.  Being that he's got that whopper of a TV in there, it seems practically criminal to have to go out somewhere to watch the game.  Thus, the cable guy.  Well, I don't know anything about the daggone setup in there.  It's rigged like I don't know what.  You need a manual the size of the NYC phone book to make sense of all the components and the remotes.  There I was, pushing buttons like a complete dolt, and this man looking at me thinking I must be the stupidest person alive.  I got so irritated I had to call my husband at work and make sure there wasn't some kind of secret mojo hidden trap door button setup to push to make it all work, because the cable guy was having a problem.  Anyway, eventually he did get it set up, and apparently there isn't any mojo voodoo thing you have to do, but I still looked like an idiot, and all I want to do now is go to bed.  I spent 16 hours at work last night/this morning.  Maybe it's me and I'm just a bit testy.  On the other hand, even with sleep I don't know how to work those remotes.  Is this just a man thing, or am I a dummy?   urlLink ');"> postCount(' ');

      So we're in a Winter Storm Warning with some freezing rain tonight and it seems some ice accumulations.  Lucky me, I decided I was going to take an office night tonight.  There's snow up in Hillsborough, so I guess I ought to be grateful we don't have that.  Scott's got his new toy, a Rotel AV receiver.  This is a very expensive piece of electronics that I haven't quite got figured out yet.  We've had tons of them and it seems that what they do is take all the signals from all your various other pieces of electronics, like a CD player, DVD player, sattelite box, laserdisc player, etc, and then send the signal out to your speakers.  Now I could be wrong on that.  Anyway, then it can change the way the signal goes to your speakers and run the sound in all different ways.  We've had a few of them-every time we get a new one, it's a more expensive one.  He seems very happy with it.  The system he's created seems very nice to me, but then again, I don't know much about these things.  All I know is that once I learn how to use the remote, he's busy selling something, and I have to relearn it all again.  I don't much care for movies or television, but I do like to listen to music.  He and I have remarkably different taste in music, for the most part, but over the years we've each bent a little and expanded our mutual horizons.  For example, at the moment we've got the Ventures playing.  Now everyone loves the Ventures because they're the classic surf music band, with that twangy Telecaster/Danelectro tremelo tone thing going on.  They've written and performed a lot of good songs.  Probably the best known is 'Walk Don't Run', which was such a huge hit for them that they decided it was worth recording several different versions of it.  Bad move.  The reason everyone liked the song so much was not so much because the writing was so stellar, but because that twangy surf sound thing was so good in it.  Believe me, the Studio 54 Disco version will make you want to burn every Quiana shirt you have hidden in the back of your closet.  And if you aren't old enough to know what a Quiana shirt is, then you aren't old enough to listen to the album anyway.  But all in all, I like the Ventures.  Doesn't everyone?  The whole 'surround sound' thing can cause quite a problem if you're not an electrician.  How do you get the 15 miles of necessary wiring around your room to the speakers?  We've got five speakers in the livingroom and it was a problem on the scale of quantum physics equations to figure out how to incorporate all this cable into our decorating scheme.  The solution was postulated by yours truly with great success.  When we redid the livingroom this summer, we went with a black/white/chrome/aluminum diamondplate scheme.  My idea for the whole room was 'neoindustrial', and we built all the furniture ourselves out of MDF, with lots of black high gloss paint and sheets of diamondplate for the tabletops and fireplace surround.  The wall art is eclectic with a heavy emphasis on New York City-subway photographs, 1930's era street scenes (all in black in white, with black frames) and various bits of things such as landmine markers from Korea ("SAFE LANE"/"MINES DANGER"), a subway car ID plate (7170), a neon Victory dealership sign, and a laminated subway map.  So the idea was to run black PVC pipe around the perimeter of the room, and thread all the wires through that.  It took some work to find black PVC pipe (it's called ABS and isn't code anymore, so it's hard to get) and a LOT of work to get the wiring through and the pipe level on the wall with the cleats and stuff.  But it looks good.  Most people when they arrive say something like "Wow, that's totally cool, but I wouldn't have it in my house."  Thankfully, we both have the same taste and like having every room different.  I wouldn't want diamondplate in my bedroom.   urlLink ');"> postCount(' ');

      I'm working tonight so I can make up some hours for the week.  Tomorrow, before I go to work, I have my preop appointment.  I am getting a little nervous, but I always get this way before I have to have some surgery (who wouldn't?)  I mean, this is my right hand we're talking about, and I'm right handed.  I play more than one musical instrument, and type 70+ wpm.  I spent two years in art school.  You just never really realise how much you actually need your hands until you can't use one.  Try it sometime and see how difficult it actually is to get dressed or cook or eat or drive with one hand.  I learned this when I worked in rehab.  I'd work with people who were recovering from a stroke, trying to learn how to put on socks with one hand.  It's terribly difficult, and folks worked real hard to try and relearn basic things like coordinaton and balance.    Now, I have a good doctor and I don't anticipate any problems.  But still, it's my right hand, and it's making me a little nervous.  I so have to wonder also at the people who come and visit my blog every day or more than one time a day (there are people who do this, if you can believe it) and never leave a comment.  I've made it so easy.  Just click on the link that says "BE PART OF THE REVOLUTION HERE".  It's about interaction, people.  Talk to me a little bit.  Otherwise it feels something like being watched in the shower.  You know what I mean?  Jeez.  In conclusion,  urlLink click here.   Scroll down and feast your eyes.  It will be the best thing you'll do all day.  Jai Sri Sri Radha Golokananda!   urlLink ');"> postCount(' ');

      You ever see those 'sponsor a child' commercials, where the nicely dressed man is holding some poor barefoot ragamuffin's hand as they walk through the sewer and the local landfill?  The kids always have dirty faces and the raggiest clothes and they're always filmed doing something utterly heartwrenching like fighting with a dog over a  moldy piece of bread.  Every time I see these commercials I feel like kicking the television.  These sponsorship people, why aren't they taking these kids and washing their faces, giving them a pair of shoes, a shirt that fits?  I always get the impression that there's some makeup lady behind the scenes smearing more dirt on their faces between takes and going, 'Okay, love, let's try that big eyed pitiful look one more time.'  I've sponsored children, don't get me wrong.  In fact there are a whole host of charities I contribute to regularly, some of which are wholly dedicated to providing hot meals for children who don't otherwise get any.  I think the whole sponsor a child thing is a good idea.  It's the commercials I find disturbing.  They strike me as exploitative and somehow sleazy, and I'd much rather see footage of someone washing these kids' faces and giving them a pair of socks with the money I donated, then having some nicely dressed man walk along in his shiny Italian shoes with some barefoot little kid who hasn't had a decent meal in a month.  In general I hate the television.  Always have, even as a kid.  There's alwas been things I've liked-cartoons, the old Batman series, Hawaii Five O (my favourite show as a kid), things like that.  Paleoworld is one of my favourite shows, and Extreme Earth.  But in general I despise television and have watched as little of it as possible.  In particular I hate the news.  Good news doesn't sell.  It's all about panic and drama and finding the worst parts of humanity to dwell upon and exploit.  It enjoys wallowing in the mud of humanity, and glorifying all the things that are worst about people and human nature.  I just hate it.  Commercials I can generally tolerate, if they're funny, but beyond that, just give me some old Bugs Bunny cartoons.  Call me escapist if you like.  I don't need to know what's on 'the news'.  I don't want to know, either.  If it was up to me, I don't think we'd even have a television.  My husband is a movie nut, so we have not only a very enormous and nice television but a cinema-busting sound system (receiver by Rotel.. ooh la la), but I'm not and have never been attached to it.  I like some movies- I've always been partial to Godzilla, Jackie Chan, Bruce Lee, and lately old Jet Li movies.  I like educational programs, especially things that have to do with geology, plate tectonics, or archaeology.  I liked that movie Airplane!.  I've seen This Is Spinal Tap so many times I know ALL the dialogue.  But in general, I can go for a week or ten days without ever watching television and never miss it.  I wonder how many people could just shut off their television.  Why not give it a try, and see what happens?  Just try one night to not watch ANY television for 24 hours, and see how you feel.  Then let me know about it.  We had an amazingly slow night last night, 10 empty beds and not one admission.  It was kind of eerie.  I'm guessing there's some kind of conjugation of the planets happening there.  Have a good day, and chant Hare Krishna to be happy.   urlLink ');"> postCount(' ');

      More people have called about the stove.  I keep calling them back or whatever but then they don't call.  Some lady called my cell phone THREE times today when I was asleep.  I finally called her back, and she was all haughty, this n that, about it.  I'm like, look, I work nights, I'm sleeping when you call, what can I tell you.  So she said she'd give the address to her son.  I told her to have him come by after 5, when Scott'd be home.  I mean, it's free.  If you don't want it, fine, I'm not all that worried about it.  If you want it, come and get it.  But leave the attitude at home.  I don't HAVE to be giving it away.  What's the matter with people?  I'm going to have an office night at work!  I have to move all my junk from our old office, from which we were evicted, to the new office, which is both bigger and better.  I'm bringing in some nice pictures and a calendar and some other various assorted goodies for the walls.  I have a nice little postcard of Radha kunda in a frame that I'm going to put up.  I ought to just spring for a big picture.  Maybe I will.  I have a 16x20 of it in the bedroom.  It's beautiful.  Someday I hope I can go there.   urlLink ');"> postCount(' ');

      Here's a favourite quote of mine from the Bhagavad gita (you can read it  urlLink here )   Chapter 18. Conclusion--The Perfection of Renunciation TEXT 66   Abandon all varieties of religion and just surrender unto Me. I shall deliver you from all sinful reaction. Do not fear.   PURPORT   The Lord has described various kinds of knowledge, processes of religion, knowledge of the Supreme Brahman, knowledge of the Supersoul, knowledge of the different types of orders and statuses of social life, knowledge of the renounced order of life, knowledge of nonattachment, sense and mind control, meditation, etc. He has described in so many ways different types of religion. Now, in summarizing Bhagavad-gita, the Lord says that Arjuna should give up all the processes that have been explained to him; he should simply surrender to Krsna. That surrender will save him from all kinds of sinful reactions, for the Lord personally promises to protect him.  In the Eighth Chapter it was said that only one who has become free from all sinful reactions can take to the worship of Lord Krsna. Thus one may think that unless he is free from all sinful reactions he cannot take to the surrendering process. To such doubts it is here said that even if one is not free from all sinful reactions, simply by the process of surrendering to Sri Krsna he is automatically freed. There is no need of strenuous effort to free oneself from sinful reactions. One should unhesitatingly accept Krsna as the supreme savior of all living entities. With faith and love, one should surrender unto Him.  According to the devotional process, one should simply accept such religious principles that will lead ultimately to the devotional service of the Lord. One may perform a particular occupational duty according to his position in the social order, but if by executing his duty one does not come to the point of Krsna consciousness, all his activities are in vain. Anything that does not lead to the perfectional stage of Krsna consciousness should be avoided. One should be confident that in all circumstances Krsna will protect him from all difficulties. There is no need of thinking how one should keep the body and soul together. Krsna will see to that. One should always think himself helpless and should consider Krsna the only basis for his progress in life. As soon as one seriously engages himself in devotional service to the Lord in full Krsna consciousness, at once he becomes freed from all contamination of material nature. There are different processes of religion and purificatory processes by cultivation of knowledge, meditation in the mystic yoga system, etc., but one who surrenders unto Krsna does not have to execute so many methods. That simple surrender unto Krsna will save him from unnecessarily wasting time. One can thus make all progress at once and be freed from all sinful reaction.  One should be attracted by the beautiful vision of Krsna. His name is Krsna because He is all-attractive. One who becomes attracted by the beautiful, all-powerful, omnipotent vision of Krsna is fortunate. There are different kinds of transcendentalists--some of them are attached to the impersonal Brahman vision, some of them are attracted by the Supersoul feature, etc., but one who is attracted to the personal feature of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and, above all, one who is attracted by the Supreme Personality of Godhead as Krsna Himself, is the most perfect transcendentalist. In other words, devotional service to Krsna, in full consciousness, is the most confidential part of knowledge, and this is the essence of the whole Bhagavad-gita.    urlLink ');"> postCount(' ');

      The next few days are going to be very hectic.  I have a lot to do and get done before this surgery.  I am not sure when I have to go in for preops (really, how many preops could they possibly need for a fifteen minute surgery that doesn't take general anaesthesia) but I am sure it will probably be at a very inconvenient time.  I also have no idea how much this is going to cost me and how much the insurance is going to pick up, so that will also be a bit of a surprise.  Anyway, I just want to get everything in proper order and then it'll be okay.  I got those Prabhupada DVDs yesterday.  It's very interesting, things are so different now.  But they are wonderful to watch.  I might make more black beans today.  They were really, really good.  All of a sudden so many people are calling about the stove.  It's still in the garage.  First come, first serve.  I don't know who's going to get it, yet.  I guess they will have to talk to Scott to set everything up, as it'll probably be in the evening, and I won't be here.    urlLink ');"> postCount(' ');

      So I got woken up by a phone call at 0730.  I have to go back to sleep.  I have to work tonight and tomorrow, and then I'm going to do some kind of marathon so I don't lose any time next week (I was scheduled for the weekend et al) having this surgery.  It seems inevitable to me that I'll at least lose 40 hours but what can I do? I have to have it done.  If I'm tough I can get back to work after just a week.  I'm going to play with my schedule tonight and see what I can do with it to stretch out my days to give me the most time off.  I don't want to burn up ALL my time because I have to think about Gurudeva being here and the time I will need off for that.  I mean, I can take it unpaid, I don't care, but it's still better to have it paid if I can work it out.  It's 27 out but somehow it looks much colder than that.  I think I'm going to unplug the phone.  If you get a chance, you should really make that black bean recipe, because it came out SO good.  It isn't chili-hot, but the ginger and cayenne make it just warm, and it's more of an afterburn than a present fire, if that makes any sense at all.  It just came out really, really good.  And even better after it sat in the fridge for a while.  I'm hoping that if I sleep until noon or one I won't have any trouble flipping my schedule over tonight.  It's just tonight and tomorrow, and then I'll be off Saturday at least before I get into a three-day marathon.  Rereading the above paragraph, the whole attention deficit thing suddenly becomes very clear to me.  I've known I have it since 87, and I've been on Ritalin since 98, but it's pretty rare that you get to see it right out there bold and beautiful in all its glory.  Imagine having to live with that mess in your head all the time.  It does have its good points, but I'll save them for another post.

      They say you can't catch up on sleep, but I just slept almost twelve hours straight.  Today I have some things to do-laundry, go to Eckerds and pick up whatever the doctor called in for me, get these pictures developed and so on.  It's cold here too-28 this morning, but the sun is shining and I don't feel quite as cold somehow.  I could get back in the bed and sleep some more, I think.  I actualy might do that at some point.  I found a book on how to deal with those vampire people, and I ordered it.  I have to have some relief.  So I am taking all comments and suggestions into consideration and trying how best to implemement them in my situation (supervisor and professional in a hospsital environment).  As Prabhupada used to say, we have to consider time, place, and circumstance.  How I deal with people at work is not necessarily how I deal with them in a different environment, and if I am your boss I deal with you differently than if you are my boss.  Mother Krishna Priya wants me to recuperate at the temple.  I don't think that's going to happen but it's a nice idea.  I could think about it some more and maybe go up there.  If I had an automatic I could drive myself, but I have a stick and I am not sure I'll be able to shift it.  It's a long drive.  On a good day it takes me 2 hours and 15 minutes.  It would be great to spend three or four days up there though.  Maybe, if there's room in the guest house, I really can... I have think more on this.  I'm probably going to go this weekend and buy that clicker.  Have you ever laid in bed so long you're actually sore when you get out?  I don't usually talk about politics in this blog, but I'm voting for Dean.  That's all.  Nuff said.   urlLink ');"> postCount(' ');

      Just got home from Hillsborough.  For only 160 miles away it's a whole lot colder.  I was very glad to have brought my long underwear because it was 19 degrees out at four this morning when I was leaving the Microtel to go to the temple.  And let me tell you, this 'winter weight' sari I have on is for 'winters' in south India, I think.  Anyway I had my big poofy Michelin Man coat and my serious backwoods gloves and my ugly hat, and after mangal aroti was over I actually went outside to chant japa.  It wasn't so bad as long as I kept walking around.  After a while I went into the guest house to warm up my face a little and I sat down (mistake of all mistakes) and fell asleep.  So I missed everything after mangal aroti, but I eventually woke up and had all 16 of my rounds chanted by 830.  I had breakfast with Mandakini and then I drove around for a while to look at the area and see if anything good was for sale.  I drove almost all the way to Roxboro.  I went through  Schley, which is a town (town? intersection.) that's been intriguing me on the map.  Mostly all there was, was cows and an American Legion hall.  I guess we need to do more looking.  Not that I mind cows.  I would like to have a cow.    Anyway, then I went back to the temple and just hung around for a while.  I talked with Ram Ranjana and he gave me a picture he made that I like very much.  It has a (very imaginative) NYC skyline, and Prabhupada's hands, writing that poem he wrote when he first came here about 'make me dance'.  He always shows me his art and he's actually very talented, I think (anyone who can read, write and speak three languages fluently is talented) and every now and then he gives me a print of one of his pictures.  In the library I have a framed picture he did of Radharani.    I heard back from Gurudeva about chanting.  He said it's okay to use a clicker.  Now, he doesn't like clickers for general use (I found this out the hard way) but he is giving me permission to use one while my hand's out of commission.  So I have to go to Office Depot or something and get one.  My surgery will be on the 29th, sometime in the morning.  It hasn't all been scheduled yet.  He's going to do it over at Cape Fear, which is interesting.  Because I'm a hospital employee, the hospital insurance won't allow you to have outpatient surgery at Surgcare.  (Monopoly!) Anyway, the sooner it's done, the sooner it's over with.  It feels like I've been away three or four days, which to me says that I really needed to get up there.  The Deities were beautiful and I took several pictures of them, so I'll be having those developed tomorrow.  Caitanya made lunch today.  She's a really good cook.  One of the things she made was a dish that had cactus in it.  I never had cactus before.  It sort of tasted like a cross between an avocado and a green pepper.  And she made some salsa that was beyond hot.  It's rare that this happens, but I couldn't eat it, that's how hot it was.  Also for lunch was steamies, and rice, and a nice dish with kidney beans, and some soup made with moong dal and vegetables, and salad with avocado dressing, and chapatis, and the salsa, and a subji that had peas and cheese in it.  There was also a drink made with strawberries and I don't know what other kind of fruit in it.  Breakfast was halava, some oatmeal with raisins in it, muffins, and a dish of rice with broccoli and peas, with hot carob milk and a mixed juice that I think had mango in it.  If people only knew how good you can eat without eating any animals, I don't think anyone would.  Not only is it more humane and better for you, it's cheaper.    Anyway, I'm tired.  I only got about two hours sleep yesterday before I left to go to Hillsborough, then last night I was totally wired, so I fell asleep around 11 and got up at 3:30 to get ready to go to the temple.  I had a hard time keeping my eyes open on the ride home.  I think I'm going to sleep good tonight.  So.  Did you miss me?    urlLink ');"> postCount(' ');

      I just got home from work.  Here's what's churning around in my mind right now:  Psychological vampirism:  These individuals often have a histrionic or narcissistic personality disorder and they are constantly drawing attention to themselves. They usually create dramatic situations and then demand emotional support from those around them. These individuals are emotional vampires. There is nothing metaphysical or spiritual in their condition, it is a simple psychological disorder. Yet it leaves the victims of these clingy, whiny people emotionally and mentally drained after dealing with them. These individuals are not to be confused with psychic, psi or energy vampires. (See also "psychic vampire", sense 2.)   I'm going to Hillsborough today for a much needed micro-vacation to get back in touch with my priorities and my real goals.  I'll be back tomorrow afternoon.  If you have any resources on how to deal with the type of person detailed above, please leave me a comment/link/anything.  Thank you.  Hare Krishna.   urlLink ');"> postCount(' ');

      For the last couple of years, I've been volunteering at  urlLink Allexperts.com   in the area of nursing education.  I get a lot of questions about school.  Here's an example of one with my answer.  I think a lot of people either have a very distorted view of nursing (it's not like General Hospital, folks) or they're just looking at all the headlines that say CRITICAL NURSE SHORTAGE PROJECTED TO CONTINUE and think about the dollars they might make as a nurse.  Anyway, here you go:  ...why do you recommend LPN vs. RN? I have always heard that LPN's (at least around here) do all the grunt work, and the RN's get to do fun stuff like push drugs and actually see more patients. In other words, I'm not really interested in changing diapers as much as working with trauma/emerging cases. Any suggestions on this area? Should I get an EMT cert first?   And my answer:  Dear *******  First of all you have to understand that basic nursing IS grunt work.  Nursing, in its most basic essence, is about changing diapers.  If you cannot or will not do these most essential functions, you can never be a nurse.  As a coordinator (charge nurse) of a 30 bed telemetry unit, I can tell you that on an average night I will change two to three beds, and change a handful of diapers.  This is just part of nursing care, and with the shortage of nursing assistants it is falling back on the nurses to provide this basic care to their patients.  In this area nursing students are now required to work as nursing assistants prior to nursing school.  This is a fantastic idea and really gives you a hands on look at the core of nursing: brushing teeth, wiping bottoms, feeding, bathing, and so on.  Rules differ from place to place but as an LPN in North Carolina I hung blood, pushed narcotics into central lines, and had my hands on just as many patients as any RN anywhere, and more than quite a few.  In my opinion, an LPN education is much more process-based, task-oriented and hands-on.  If you want nursing, not theory, an LPN program is going to get you in and out and actually working in half the time of an associates degree, which is the minimum for an RN.  Additionally, in the area where I work, there are many more and many more varied job opportunities for LPNs versus RNs.  To me, this gives the LPN greater job mobility and a greater level of control.  Please also remember two things: one, you do not magically become a nurse the day your license shows up.  Learning to be a competent nurse is a process that spans several years, typically two to three, and in that time you will be considered a 'new' nurse and not every job will be open to you at that point.  Two, the desire to work in a particular area does not always coincide with the availability of jobs in a particular area.  My first love has always been general medicine, infectious disease, and then substance abuse detox.  Currently, I work in Cardiac Medical Telemetry, which is a close cousin with a focus on the heart.  You may very well have to take a job in an area very different from trauma or emergent care, depending on what's open and what the requirements are.  Especially in areas of that nature, some previous floor experience might be preferred or required.  I personally would not want to work in emergent care without a solid background in med surg.    You might wish to get your EMT first.  I would also recommend that before you commit to any kind of nursing education, you visit with or talk to some nursing assistants or nurses currently practicing to see how things really are on the floor.    I hope this has been helpful to you.  Please don't hesitate to contact me again if you need anything else.  Yours sincerely, Satyavati, RN     urlLink ');"> postCount(' ');

      I have  urlLink this  in my head.  It's a good commercial, yes, but two things.  1. When are they going to make a commercial like this for the girls?  and 2. I don't like waking up with it in my head.  I did not sleep very well today.  Last night was not so good.  Tonight pretty much has to be better because I am not sure how it oculd be very much worse.  Tomorrow I'm going to Hillsborough, which will be wonderful, a micro-vacation for me, but I'm just hoping I can stay awake long enough to get myself there in one piece.  I am debating about which way to go and how to time it, because it'll be a Monday which means Raleigh Durham traffic, and I don't want any part of that.  We'll see how I feel in the morning and go from there.  I haven't even packed yet, but really, how much do I need?  Anyway, if I can't get that  urlLink commercial  out of my head, it might be better to just drive off the road.  Not to mention that Scott sings it just perfectly and does so frequently.  Really, what is the point?  What are we saying here?  What is it that guys want anyway?  I'm not exactly sure.  I don't know that the commercial was designed to stand up to this kind of sociological scrutiny.  Anyway, it's funny but on the other hand, on a deeper level, it's kind of disturbing, because it leaves me wondering, what exactly is it that you want/expect, and is whatever that is something I'm okay with, and if I'm not okay with it, then is it my problem, your problem, a sociocultural problem, or should we just have another beer and forget it.    I told you, I'm not expressing myself well today.  I know what I'm trying to say, but it's just not coming out the way I want it to.  urlLink ');"> postCount(' ');

      We need the regulative principles to keep us on the right focus.  Without them, we would be sucked into material sense gratification and losing sight of the spiritual path, the things that are most important in life, that are so easy to forget in this illusory world.  I'm not really expressing myself like I want to today.  I had a very rought night at work.   I am hoping tonight is better.   urlLink ');"> postCount(' ');

      Another first day back, and I've not slept a wink.  I have, though, done some laundry, cleaned the kitchen, made a nice bit of lunch (tomatoes and rice) and, of course, added a whole lot of stuff to the blog here.  Ah well.

      All right, I've made a lot of little tweaks and additions to the site here.  Most of these things I just think are neat, like the people online counter and the homeland security thing.  The stuff labeled 'at your own risk' means exactly that.  I am not responsible for anything you find there, and don't come crying to me if you find something that upsets your delicate sensibilities.  Caveat emptor.  You've been warned.  That being said, I'm trying to promote the site a little bit, which is part of what's behind these changes, too.  So, not everything on here is devotional, but you've been warned, so there aren't any surprises.  I'm  still  sick from that Vicodin I took yesterday.  I don't understand how it makes me so sick when the Percocet doesn't, but I most certainly don't like it.  I have to work tonight so I'm hoping I feel better by then.  I can't take any time off if I'm going to be having this surgery.  Today I need to read, to chant, and to do laundry.  I'd also like to listen to some lectures.  I'm still waiting for those Prabhupada DVD's to show up.  They're certainly taking their sweet time.     urlLink ');"> postCount(' ');

      Found this  urlLink here.   I've been on ritalin for several years now, but it doesn't fix everything.  Adult Attention-Deficit Disorder (Adult ADD) symptoms are similar, but not identical, to those seen in children and adolescents. The basic categories of symptoms in children are inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity. People often refer to the adult form of the disorder as ADD, because symptoms of hyperactivity tend to diminish with age, often taking the form of restlessness or fidgetiness (eg, persistent pencil tapping and/or foot tapping) and difficulty engaging in quiet activities. However, the medical community uses ADHD for both children and adults, and this term is becoming more widely accepted.  Until the 1970s, it was believed that Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) was strictly a childhood disorder, and that children outgrew it in adolescence. Only gradually was it realized that while the hyperactivity component may diminish, the attention and impulsive aspects can persist into adulthood.  Symptoms commonly associated with Adult ADD include:  Lack of focus Disorganization Restlessness Difficulty finishing projects Losing things These symptoms interfere with success at work and get in the way at home or with friends.    urlLink ');"> postCount(' ');

      Yesterday I was driving along very nicely and saw about 500 birds all flying wildly about overhead.  Have you ever seen how they do this?  It's vaguely intimidating, and I got to thinking, why should I be worried about a flock of birds?  Then I started thinking about that movie, "The Birds", and wondering what was REALLY so scary about it?  Why was it so frightening?  I mean, it WAS scary.  But why?  They're just birds.  So I started thinking and here is my theory, make of it what you will: Birds are related to dinosaurs.  I'm not saying evolved from, because I don't believe in evolution, evolution is silly and illogical.  I'll keep that for the next paragraph.  But birds are related to the dinosaurs.  So I'm thinking, maybe it's some kind of genetic collective memory thing.  Even the word 'raptor' means bird of prey, and although most people associate that word with the velociraptors from Jurassic Park, there is a whole category of bird called 'raptors', which include things like hawks and falcons and stuff.  Now about evolution.  It doesn't make sense to me.  I love archaeology and paleontology and all that stuff and I've studied it since I was a little kid (literally, four years old) but evolution is just a crock of nonsense.  Do you really want me to believe, for example, that here's this momma dinosaur and this daddy dinosaur, and they suddenly give birth to something that looks nothing like them?  No.  I don't believe that.  And if that's the case, why aren't we still evolving?  Has anyone ever seen one species change into another?  If you go out and live in the outback and spend all your time stretching your neck to pull leaves off the tops of trees, will your children be born with long necks?  Cmon.  I think it's a lot of propaganda.  This has nothing at all to do with religion or anything like that.  I just think evolution is a crock.  And I don't like the fact that even though it's JUST a theory, it's presented as fact.  You watch Walking with Dinosaurs and see what I mean.  It was a great series and I enjoyed it, but they took a lot of liberties and made a lot of guesses, especially about the social behaviour of these creatures, but everything's presented as if it were fact, and the word 'evolution' or derivatives thereof were used about a million times.  My personal opinion as a grownup is that evolution is illogical, and I'm sticking to it.   urlLink ');"> postCount(' ');

      My friendly neighbourhood orthopod (see previous post) is scheduling me for surgery as we speak.  He's pretty much a straight up kinda guy who doesn't hesitate to tear your butt up for not coming to see him three months prior when you actually had your problem, and he's having no truck with any of this cortisone-shots-and-let's-see-how-you-do-here's-some-Vicodin business.  I did get the Vicodin, but we're headed straight to Cape Fear Memorial for the surgery.  It's kind of odd... they don't use general anaesthesia for it anymore.  I'm guessing it'll be sort of like when they do oral surgery and they just dope you up with Demerol and Versed or something like that.  Anyway, he says two weeks out of work.  It's an occasion either way, and I really have to have this done.  I didn't realise how much strength I've lost in my right hand.  Although I'm right handed (and right brained, which is an anomaly discussed at length in a previous post, somewhere in the archives to your right), my left hand is currently significantly stronger than the right.  I'm hoping the surgery's going to fix all that, but how am I going to chant japa if I have no right hand for two weeks??

      I know it sounds stupid but working that one extra day is pretty rough.  I was all confused most of the night anyway because I started at 11 instead of 7 and it just totally threw me off.  Everything started to go downhill at 5, people were having some problems, and the learning curve for this new cardiac stuff is pretty steep.  We all as a group and me personally have a lot to learn.  On the positive side, I was able to work some miracles with the day staffing and keep them fully staffed (more than I can say for how they do us, generally) and then a whole flock of students showed up.  Even better than that, because I was hanging around trying to wrap up everything, I got to talk with some of them and give them report, etc.  Three (yes  THREE ) of them said they wanted to work in CMTU on nights.  I thought I was hallucinating.  How great is that?  Anyway, they don't graduate til May and wouldn't be legal til sometime in June/July, but just the fact that someone was expressing an interest was very positive for me.  I love to teach.  The thought of having three to precept and bring up is pretty great.  If I had my bachelor's degree, I'd be teaching LPNs right now.  But the thought of having to take statistics is just too much.  Today I'm going to see the orthopaedic surgeon.  Did you know that they are also called 'orthopods'?  Now I am not sure why, but they are.  It's a weird word.  Anyway, this is the same guy who fixed my ankle when I broke it, so I trust him (even though my ankle tends to ache me a lot..but that's really my fault for waiting so long to have anything done to it).  This, however, is a hand, which is even more vital to me as a nurse.  So we'll see what he says.  Probably they'll do a set of films, then a cortisone shot, and write me some prescriptions, and if that doesn't help immediately and immensely, then probably set me up for surgery.  The problem for me is that the pain is really kind of intermittent in that it bothers me for a week or ten days nonstop and then goes away for a couple of weeks.  I don't know.  We'll see how it goes.  Last night I sprung a brand new dish on Scott with very pleasant results.  I made some cheese for a different dish the other day and had some leftover.  So I cut it into little pieces, pan-fried it til it was crispy, and served it in a homemade tomato sauce over Asian wheat noodles.  He actually liked it and ate two plates, which is an event akin to the conjunction of the planets, so I was in seventh heaven.  Here are the recipes: they are both very easy.  The noodles you have to find in your local Saigon market.  Homemade Cheese (Paneer) Put whole milk into a spotlessly clean pan.  It is very important that the pan be absolutely clean to prevent your cheese from having any problems.  I usually scald my pot first with boiling water just to be sure.  You must use whole milk to make cheese.  I have never tried lactose-free milk for paneer, so I have no idea about that.  Generally any quantity less than half a gallon is worthless, so start with at least that much.  You will appreciate using a nonstick pan for this. Bring the milk to a boil, stirring pretty regularly to keep it from burning on the bottom.  Milk boils funny-it sort of foams, so watch it carefully to know when it's ready.  When the milk is boiling, add lemon juice.  For a half gallon of milk I typically will add about a quarter cup of lemon juice.  Sprinkle it over the whole surface, stirring slowly as you do.  The milk will curdle instantly.  Keep stirring very gently for a few minutes, turning the heat off, and let the curds come together.  The whey will be a clear greenish-yellow colour.  Now you pour the curds into a colander lined with cheesecloth (I have a cheese press, which is easier, but the colander will do) and rinse the curds with cool water to get the lemon juice out.  Now you can take the cheescloth by the corners, gathering it up, and tie them carefully together to keep the curds in.  Hang the cheesecloth from your faucet to drain out the whey.  This is going to give you a soft cheese like ricotta.  If you want firm cheese, you have to press it-so you'd need to put the tied-off cheesecloth back into the colander and find a weight to press down on it for an hour or two.  Paneer will keep several days in tupperware in the refrigerator and is useful for many, many recipes.  My Homemade Tomato Sauce Take one 15 oz can of diced tomatoes and puree it in the blender.  Then put the following spices in a mortar and pestle: 5 whole cloves, 1/2 tsp cinnamon, 1 tsp cumin seeds, 1 tsp coriander powder, 1 tsp salt  and grind everything to a powder.  Now in a frying pan put about a tablespoon and a half of butter.  When it's melted and starting to sizzle, add 1 teaspoon of ginger paste or 2 teaspoons fresh grated ginger and fry for about a minute.  Then add the spices and a half cup of the tomato puree and fry for two minutes more.  Your kitchen is going to smell so good.  Then add the rest of the tomato puree and simmer on low for about 25 minutes.  About ten minutes prior to serving, add the fried paneer cubes to the sauce and let them absorb all the flavours.    Offer the fried paneer and sauce over rice, pasta, or Asian wheat noodles to Krishna, and then serve to your happy guests.  Have a lovely day, and chant Hare Krishna to be happy.  urlLink ');"> postCount(' ');

      Two things occurred to me tonight.  One, it had to be a man who invented pantyhose.  (I was right.  His name was Allen Gant Senior.  Pantyhose were first introduced here in North "first in flight, first in pantyhose" Carolina in 1959.)  Second, I ought to make a pantyhose aerobics video.  For Christmas sake, they're like torture.  Of course, being the abundantly blessed woman I am, all my pantyhose are the industrial strength high-tensile radial belted steel control top kind, which makes it even more of a workout.  Seriously, you can break a sweat putting these things on.  Then, at the very last moment, when you think you're finally there, zing! You get a run that looks like the CSX Atlantic Coast Line track running from thigh to ankle.  And so you begin again.  But the fun doesn't end with just getting them on, oh no.  Then you have to actually move about the place and so on.  And they creep.  Have you never heard of pantyhouse creep?  It's a serious issue.  There you are, going about your business without any problem, when suddenly the crotch of the pantyhose is strangling your knees.  Naturally, this only occurs when you are at least 50 yards from the nearest closet/bathroom/office/stairwell/whatever where you can hide and adjust them.  But wait!  There's more.  The last and possibly the most serious issue of wearing pantyhose is the dreaded center seam.  Now, if you don't get those pantyhose JUST RIGHT, or if they creep, that seam is going to create more friction than LA needs to create a day's worth of electricity.  The government's studying this as we speak-whether chubby women in pantyhose can somehow be rigged to a treadmill and the resultant seam chafe friction used to power steam turbines to create a cheap and renewable source of electricity.  Richard Simmons is thrilled-if it's approved, he's got plans for a series of powerplants around the country marketed as women's gyms, with rows of treadmills all rigged to capacitors, and big generator substations out back.  L'eggs is in on it too, with free pantyhose to all members for the life of their membership.  It's potentially enormous.  Bush is pushing it in Congress, hoping he can shut out the Middle East as an international power by eliminating our dependence on imported oil.  You heard it here first.  So all that remains now is for me to get a hold of Peter "Lord of the Rings" Jackson and have him direct my "Pantyhose For Pounds" exercise video.  Brilliant.  (Have a good night, chant Hare Krishna, and be happy.  I'm going to go chant a while and then head off to work.)   urlLink ');"> postCount(' ');

      I said I was going to regret it, didn't I?  Boy am I going to sleep good today.  Gurudeva's group now has 37 members, growing exponetially (I don't even know what that word means but I know it has to do with math and it sounds good), and we got our new stove yesterday (smooth top, Kenmore, very nice) and the new fridge and kitchen floor are on the way.  Our house isn't beat up and gross, but the appliances are 10 years old now and needing to be updated and so on.  You know you're getting old when you can get excited over a refrigerator.  Work was tough and I don't want to talk about it.  We need help.   We need help.   I don't want to talk about it anymore unless you're a nurse who wants to come and work with me on my shift in my unit.  And if you are, please go  urlLink here  and apply, right away.  Tell them you want to work 7P-7A in CMTU with me.  My carpal tunnel syndrome has acted up for the last time.  I made an appointment today with my friendly neighbourhood orthopaedic surgeon, in fact the same one who rebuilt my ankle for me back in 2001 (and hollered at me for walking/working/driving on it for THREE MONTHS while it was broken/ruptured/torn/etc).  I didn't know he did hands too, but the hand specialist isn't free til the middle of February and he's next on the list for hands.  I have to have my hands.  I'm a nurse, for Christmas sake.  Right now it's just the one hand but I expect it will be the other one too after long.  I'll be happy to just have the one done.  How many days do you think I can get off work for this?  I'm so excited about the new stove but I'm kinda afraid to cook on it.  I'm afraid I'll drop something and break it.  So probably best I don't do anything until this evening.  I'm going to make that rajma I talked about.   Meanwhile, I have to get some sleep.  Have a lovely day, chant Hare Krishna, and be happy.   urlLink ');"> postCount(' ');

      I'm entirely unable to sleep today, which I am sure I will regret deeply by around midnight.  Mind you, I  tried  to sleep, but for some reason, it just wasn't working.  It's 57 and sunny today.  I froze all weekend, and now this.  Wrote a letter to Sri Prahlad seeing if there's any news about Gurudeva's spring schedule.  I know it's really early for this kind of thing but we do our schedules SO far in advance, I just have to try.  I don't want to be messing up the schedule at the last minute and I certainly don't want them to say I can't go.  But I doubt I'll have any solid news on his itinerary before the first of March.    I still haven't heard back from Gurudeva yet.  I will probably resend the letter again before I go to work.  Sometimes I think they just get lost in his mailbox-I am sure it has thousands of letters in it every week.  Also, he goes to all kinds of places and different countries, and how good is the access there?  I don't know.  Anyway, I will be persistent and just resend it every couple of weeks until I get a reply.  This happened once before and at first I was in hysterics thinking I'd said something in my letter he disapproved of or that he was angry, but you know, on reflection, I don't think he would hesitate to correct me if I was in the wrong about something.  He can be extremely strict when necessary, and he's very disciplined.  Maybe it was the USMC training.  Is this a lesson in taking mundane things and using them for spiritual purposes?  Anyway, I have to work three days this week, which I suppose will be good when the paycheck arrives but mentally right now I don't want to think about it.  Maybe I'll get to work today and I'll hear that they've hired five nurses to work nights that are all starting next week.  Yeah, right.  Anyway, I can dream.  Janmastami this year falls on Labour day, which would have caused a problem because I am supposed to work that day, but one of my coworkers has promised to switch with me.  I'm going to fix it so that I can be up in Hillsborough for several days just like always.  I love Janmastami.  Speaking of Hillsborough, I'm going up there next Monday for an overnight stay.  I had a free night at the Microtel, and I haven't been there in forever.  Don't laugh.  The Microtel is clean, nice, and quiet, especially on weekdays, and it's close to the temple, and I've stayed there so many times they all know me now.  I always stay there when I go up, except when Gurudeva's here, and then I stay at the house he stays at.  It's nice.  This year will be nicer, because I won't be so freaked out.  By the way, Gurudeva's egroup now has 32 members.    Hare Krishna!   urlLink ');"> postCount(' ');

      I don't feel well today.  There was a brief announcement posted  urlLink here  about an egroup I've started for Gurudeva's disciples.  As of right now, membership's tripled.  Everyone's quiet so far, but I'm hoping the group takes off and does well.  Meanwhile today I've not done much.  I did go to B&N and get myself a nice vegan cookbook (I am not vegan, but vegetarian) and then to the grocery store for some tomatoes.  I cook with tomatoes EVERY day.  Right now there's some fresh cheese I've made draining in the kitchen and I'm planning on making a dish called Rajma with it.  If you want the recipe, let me know. Scott's been caught up in the playoffs, and between time I've just been freezing, dozing, and watching Walking with Dinosaurs.  I love anything that has to do with geology, paleontology, or archaeology.  I was really looking for books about those types of things today, but didn't find anything that caught my eye.  I have to work an extra day this week, so I don't know how much I'll be blogging.  Leave me a comment, will you!  Give a little encouragement.  A considerable number of people read this blog, why I don't know, but only one's left a comment so far.  Just click on the link and leave me a note!   urlLink ');"> postCount(' ');

      I spent a good bit of last night wandering about singing.  Not very loud, of course, because all my people are trying to sleep, but singing just the same.  I like to sing at work, when I'm not so busy that I forget to.  I don't sing very well, but I sing anyway.  It makes me feel like I'm in a more devotional environment than just my job.  Singing is such a huge part of what we do.  Singing, dancing, chanting, eating.  Going out in public and singing or chanting the holy name is called "harinam sankirtan".  This is many people's first exposure to devotees or to Krishna's holy name, and an enthusiastic harinam has brought many people to Krishna.  Besides singing the maha-mantra, my favourite prayer to sing are the prayers to Lord Nrsimhadeva, the half-lion/half-man incarnation that came to protect His pure devotee Sri Prahlad.  Prahlad was a little boy who was very devoted to the Lord.  His father, however, was a demon, and tried everything he could to get Prahlad to give up religion.  He beat him, tortured him, and tried to kill him.  (This was before DSS said you couldn't spank your kids.)  Prahlad kept the faith, and one day, in response to a challenge from Prahlad's father Hiranyakasipu, the Lord manifested Himself right there and killed Hiranyakasipu.  There's more to the story, of course, but I don't really have time to tell you all the details just now.  Anyway, Lord Nrsimhadeva is very protective of His devotees and keeps them safe.  And His prayers are my favourite to sing.  They are some of the first prayers I learned, too.  It's supposed to snow today, but so far all we have is 40 degrees and raining, which equals raw and miserable.  I don't particularly care for snow, having seen enough of it when we lived in NY, but even an inch down here totally paralyses the town.  It's comical but also kind of pitiful in a way.  We can have a hurricane and get three feet of sand in the street, and everyone's back to work the next day.  An inch of snow shuts the place down for a week.  Anyway, I've got a three day weekend this weekend, and I plan on relaxing, snuggling, watching some movies, and doing things around the house.  We're losing yet another nurse at work, which just cranks my stress level up to 11 ("this one goes to eleven.") and I feel like I need to get in some pre-emptive relaxation before I actually have to deal with the loss.

      Well, winter's arrived.  It never gets cold here until January, and somehow it always takes me by surprise.  Last week I was outside in 75 degrees chanting in the sun, and right now it's only 28.    I'm working some extra days in the next couple of weeks.  I'm not really excited about doing it, but I believe in a team mentality and if I am going to ask everyone to work extra then by crikey I ought to work extra too.  I don't want to be a hypocrite.  It still doesn't make working extra any easier.  However, it's only an eight hour shift, and I've scheduled them after two twelves.  This way it ought to feel like a walk in the park, and besides, I'll be able to get some extra sleep and stuff before going in.    We on night shift are at 'critical' staffing, which means 'barely enough people to get the job done'.  The only good thing about this, and I'm not all that sure it's good, is that it means we're eligible for 'critical staffing' pay.  This is a substantial number of dollars per hour over and above overtime (about $7/hr additional).  While this doesn't generate the additional staff we need, it does generate some interest in the current staff to pick up extra time.  I'm not quite sure when critical staffing pay will kick in, but I'm pretty sure it will be soon.  The bigger question is why has it taken this long to get here, but we're in a new department now and I'm not going to wallow in the past.  People often wonder why there's a nursing shortage.  It's not so much that nursing schools aren't graduating people-they're stuffed to bursting.  It's more, at least here, that work conditions have deteriorated to the point where all your experienced nurses are burned out and leaving the field.  Having experienced nurses on hand is crucial in nursing.  When you're a new grad, you don't just magically become a nurse the day your license arrives in the mail.  It takes about a year just to learn how to make sense of things, and then you're still considered a 'new' nurse for about three years.  Nurses learn from each other, the older ones teaching the newer ones, so if you have an area with a high proportion of new grads, they don't get that hands-on mentoring that is so important.  This is frustrating for them, and they don't learn the way they should.  Then they get burned out and go work in another field.  So it seems to be a circular problem.  I don't know what the problem is in other places.  The other situation is that, of course, there really isn't a market here for RNs outside the hospital.  And what if you don't want to or can't work there?  Then you're SOL.    Anyway, I'm hopeful that some aggressive recruitment will be done and we will get some staff with experience, and things will settle down.  Beyond that, I have to try and sleep some today.  First day back is always hard on me.   urlLink ');"> postCount(' ');

      I made it through my 90 days at work.    Lots of changes are coming there soon, as we are becoming a different unit in a whole different division of the hospital.  Change is hard for lots of people, including me.  Someone once told me that having trouble dealing with change is part of my alcoholic personality, but I've been sober almost 14 years now, so I'm not sure if that was just a lotta talk or what.  Anyway, I think fear of the unknown and everything is common to all people.  I think it will be okay, for the most part-I will just be happy when the 'change' part is over and we can settle down to business.  I've got some plans for officially beginning the community preaching effort that should begin next week.  So if you don't hear anything about it, be sure to rag me and keep me accountable.  I have to stick to at least one of my resolutions.    I am anxiously waiting for some Prabhupada DVDs to arrive.  It's a rainy day today and it sure would be nice if they came this afternoon.  I have to get some laundry done and wash dishes and so on, but this afternoon ought to be quiet and it would be nice to have some quiet time.  I'm back more steadily into reading Bhagavad gita, at least 10 verses a day (I read very quickly so this is like half-hour of reading a day).  My husband's a real picky eater and hates most foods, especially vegetables.  But he's given up beef for his new year's resolution (jaya!) and we've worked out a bit of a contract.  He's buying some audio components for the livingroom (again.. we have a better sound system than the local movie house) and in exchange for me not complaining about the massive cost incurred for replacing perfectly good components that we have now, he's agreed to at least TASTE everything I cook for the next two years.  Now this might sound stupid to you, but it's a huge breakthrough for me.  I love to cook.  Cooking is such a big part of our religion-we cook for Krishna, and offer prasadam (food that's been offered to Krishna) to everyone.  Prasadam is very powerful.  It's spiritual nourishment as well as physical, and having him be willing at least to taste is so motivating.  In fact, I think I'll go cook now. :)   urlLink ');"> postCount(' ');

      What aggravates me more than anything these days is people who let their own personal ambitions for glory write their management philosophy.  I don't visualise management as an "I'm the boss, and you're not" thing.  I view it as service, and a responsibility to provide advocacy, establish trust, promote learning and foster teamwork.  Yeah, I know this sounds like a big hooey United Way commercial or something.  But I really believe it.  People who suck up a management party line and trash their peers to get ahead themselves really torque my tail.    We learn in Vedic scriptures that we are all in the position of eternal servant to Krsna.  We all want to be God, but in reality, there's only one God, Krsna, and we, in reality, whether we like the idea or not, are His servants.  So the greatest leader is the one who serves the most devotedly, and we strive always to be humble and to give all respect to others.  We say, 'dasanudasa'-the servant of the servant.  This is our real position-to be the servant of the servant of Krsna.  This capacity of wanting to lord it over others is because we are infintesimally qualitatively equal with Krsna, and since He is the Lord and Master of all, we also have that propensity in minute quantity.  But through the scriptures, we can understand that this is delusion.  Jesus said the same thing-that we should be servants of each other, and servants of God.  He often said that 'he who is last shall be first' and other statements that show the value of humility and loving service.  This tendency towards tyranny over others is something that we have to recognize and eradicate in ourselves.  Leadership is a privelege, not a right.  It's a responsibility, not a higher social stratum.  I feel responsible to my staff to help them become better nurses, to help them find fulfillment in their careers, to educate them, to advocate for them and to help them advocate for themselves.  This kind of mentality means I'm often at odds with high-level management.  That's the risk I have to run to be true to my vision of what my role is.  I am not out to show people that I'm their boss or make them feel stupid or ensure that they spend every minute of every day in acute awareness of my educational and positional superiority over them.  That's just a big nonsense.  It's also bad karma, and promotes nothing but hate.  When we can understand humility and service, we naturally attract people.  The qualities of spiritual life are equally applicable in the world.  When we understand that we are eternally Krsna's servants, and that we are ALL Krsna's servants, where is the question of someone being better than another, or lording it over another?  It's not there.  How can I lord it over someone else?  I too am simply trying to be a servant of my guru, who works hard to serve his guru, Srila Prabhupada, who works hard to serve Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakur Maharaj, and so on, a hundred times the servant of the servant.  This is our real position, and only in this position can we ever find a taste of what real happiness is.  Hare Krishna.  All glories to Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu's sankirtan movement!  urlLink ');"> postCount(' ');

      Today is Ekadasi.  This is a day that falls eleven days after the full or new moon.  On this day we fast from beans and grains, and we try and devote more time to chanting/hearing/remembering.  Today I'm sewing a uniform dress.  It's not actually a dress but a jumper.  The pattern only has four pieces, but I'm no Betsy Ross, so it's enough to make me nervous.  I like to sew, though, even though I'm not good at it.  I have a non-electric Singer machine (the kind you do with your feet, like your grandmother used to do).  These machines are actually still in production by the Singer company.  I bought mine new, and they are widely used throughout the world.  It doesn't do fancy stitches or buttonholes, but it does make a beautiful tiny stitch (about 20-30 stitches to the inch) and has a lovely quiet rhythmic sound to it.  It makes sense when you think of how many parts of the world don't have electricity (still) or where electricity is unreliable, and a machine like this can really revolutionise the process of clothing one's family over hand stitching.  I've sewn dresses by hand, too, so I know from personal experience.   In our country we are familiar with the Amish, who don't use electricity.  Amish women also use treadle machines, but most of them use converted electric machines that can do fancy stitching (to me, a zigzag is fancy.. 'fancy' is relative).  The patterns they use are traditional and simple, but sturdy and just what I wanted for work uniforms.  I'm hoping that in time and with practice I'll get better at it.  Spiritual life also takes practice.  We don't drop habits overnight.  I hear people all the time who tell me they 'can't possibly give up meat/alcohol/smoking/caffiene.'  It's not that you can't.  It's that you won't.  That's the reality of it.  You can if you really want to, and if you believe that you're doing the right thing for the right reason.  Nobody's saying it'll be easy.  It took me weeks to get over the caffiene headaches.  But with practice, and determination, and perseverance, you can.  You just have to get it straight as a priority.  Someone once complained to Srila Prabhupada that he didn't have enough time to chant his rounds.  Srila Prabhupada pointed out that the devotee had plenty of time to eat and to sleep.  It's all a matter of making priorities.  2004 for me is going to be about keeping my priorities straight.  How about you?   urlLink ');"> postCount(' ');

      GOD HATES?  The Rev. Fred Phelps is back in the news. The picketing pastor and host of www.godhatesfags.com is proposing a public monument for Matthew Shepherd, the gay college student, murdered in 1998. The granite marker in Shepherd's hometown will read, and I quote:  "MATTHEW SHEPHERD, Entered Hell October 12, 1998, in Defiance of God's Warning: 'Thou shalt not lie with mankind as with womankind; it is abomination.' Leviticus 18:22."  Phelps, pastor of Westboro Baptist Church in Topeka, Kansas, also hosts www.godhatesamerica.com. Most of all he hates the idea that God loves, and again I quote, "filthy dyk* dogs," "SODOMITES," "dog kennels/pig sties masquerading as churches," and pastors who are "demon-possessed Pied Pipers from Hell."  Not even the lovable "Mr. Rogers" escapes the pastor's wrath. According to Phelps, Fred Rogers "went straight to hell" because of his ordination in the Presbyterian Church and association with PBS.  Phelps also picketed in New York City three times since September 11, 2001, with signs that read "Thank God For Sept. 11" and calling the FDNY a "f*g fire department." Recently he was in Hawaii, the site of the WWII attack on Pearl Harbor, with signs that read "Thank God for December 7".  He especially seems to hate anyone who disagrees with him. His website proclaims:  "[Anyone] believing and preaching that God loves every individual of mankind -- we say, You are going to Hell! Period! End of discussion! God's decree sending you to Hell is irreversible! Hypocrites! How can ye escape the damnation of Hell?!"  Well, at the risk of "the damnation of Hell," I've gotta ask, what does God Himself think about all this? I'll let His Book speak for Him.  "For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life" (John 3:16). (The word translated "world" is actually "cosmos" which includes every created thing and every single person.)  "'Do I take any pleasure in the death of the wicked? declares the Sovereign Lord. Rather, am I not pleased when they turn from their ways and live?" (Ezekiel 18:23).  "The Lord . . . is patient with you, not wanting anyone to perish, but everyone to come to repentance" (2 Peter 3:9).  And, concerning Phelp's obsession with "hate":  "Dear friends, let us love one another, for love comes from God. Everyone who loves has been born of God and knows God. Whoever does not love does not know God, because God is love" (1 John 4:7).  "'Teacher, which is the greatest commandment in the Law?' Jesus replied: 'Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind. This is the first and greatest commandment. And the second is like it: Love your neighbor as yourself'"' (Matthew 22:36-38)  "Let your conversation be always full of grace" (Colossians 4:6).  Yes, the Bible has three or four passages that warn against homosexual behavior (eg. Leviticus 18:22, 1 Corinthians 6:9). And, yes, it has many verses concerning a final judgment day.  But it also includes hundreds of sections that teach "Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It is not rude, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres" (1 Corinthians 13:4-7).  God loves gays and straights, America and Iraq, Fred Rogers and Fred Phelps. He's not always happy with their behavior, but He loves them unconditionally.  So should we.  © 2003 James N.

      When I go to the temple, there are all different kinds of people there. You find Bengalis, South Indians, people from Finland, Estonia, Mexico, Russia, Nigeria, the US, Croatia, Slovenia, Japan, France, Canada and probably more that I can't pull up off the top of my head. This is at New Goloka, which is a very, very small community by ISKCON standards.  Although I sometimes have difficulty communicating with some of the devotees there because of language barriers, we all come together and chant. It reminds me in a way of how the Catholic church spread all over the world and the Latin language was able to bring cultures and peoples together. I went to an Easter service in a Catholic church in Spain. Although the rules were slightly different (we had to cover our heads, wear dresses, and have long sleeves), it was still the same Mass, and although I didn't understand the sermon because it was in Spanish, I had no trouble following the Mass, which was in Latin.  Krishna consciousness isn't about being Indian or looking Indian or adopting Indian customs or culture. Srila Prabhupada likened traditional Indian dress to a uniform of a policeman or doctor. In the west, especially, we stand out because of how we dress. The idea behind it is that people would look at you and know you're a devotee. It's not mandatory by any means and it doesn't make you a devotee.  The principles behind Krishna consciousness are essentially the same as most of the world's major religions: learn to love God and to serve Him. I think it's very significant that in most pictures I've seen of Krishna, He's not black, but blue. Blue is a colour you won't find (in health) on any person on this planet. Therefore it becomes a little harder to be prejudiced or to make material designations. It's not like we're saying Krishna is white like a white person or black like a black person or red or yellow or whatever-He's blue. There's no race that can claim to be blue. I'm not exactly expressing myself well on this point, but maybe you will understand what I mean.  So the goal is loving God and serving God. Whatever means we use to achieve this, the goal is still the same. I never really try to convert people or convince them that I'm right and they're not. I give out an awful lot of information, period. But if people are Baptist, or Pentecostal, or Amish, or Jewish, or Muslim, or whatever, if their practice is bringing them to a point of loving God, and rendering devotional service to God, then haven't they reached the same goal I'm working towards? I can quote the Bible better than most Baptists I know. It really makes them angry (lol). The question would be: are they following the Bible? If they aren't, what good is it? So whatever religious path is chosen, the important thing is to follow it. Like these Muslim women I see around. They are unwaveringly devoted to their practices, and I admire them for that.  Krishna consciousness has spread all over the world. If you look at pictures of Deities that have manifested in different places, you will see that Their devotees have dressed and decorated Them with the personal flair of the culture where they are. The foods, etc., that are offered to the Lord are often locally traditional foods. Krishna consciousness adapts itself to the place it manifests. I don't mean that it dilutes the principles or anything, but that it has to be appropriate to time, place, and circumstance. An example is that in Siberia, it gets to like 100 below zero and stuff. You can't wear a gauze sari in that!  If your goal is to promote your culture or ethnicity that's fine, but I am not sure how that figures into religious practice.  As I think Laura's mentioned I've spent almost half my life (literally) researching religious beliefs. The path you choose is, in my opinion, not quite as important as whether or not it works for you. Whatever religious path you ultimately decide on, if it brings you closer to God, that's all that matters.  I'm not quite sure if this has been helpful. I don't actually know if I understood the issue in the first place. So if I've got it all wrong, please let me know.  Love Satyavati    urlLink      urlLink ');"> postCount(' ');

      I've been hearing a lot about this in the various egroups I frequent and in discussion and so on.  All I have to say is that I personally wouldn't go see it even if I were still a practicing Catholic, as it's far too violent to be something I'd be interested in watching.  I think if it helps people to actually read their Bibles and do what it says within, then fine, but if people are just coming out of the theatre and going to eat burgers or chickens whilst slamming the Jews, then it was a waste of Mel Gibson's money.  The only thing that matters is learning to love and serve God.  However you get there is up to you, as long as you get there, or at least put yourself firmly on the road.    If people walk out of this movie and think it's OK to disregard the Ten Commandments, then all those millions of dollars might just as well have been used to wipe Mel's butt.    Have you heard, all of NC except for us it seems, got snowed in?  Charlotte got like 15 inches of snow.  I certainly don't miss any of that.   urlLink      urlLink ');"> postCount(' ');

      It's a nasty, cold, rainy day.  The pixie to the right there is dead wrong.  I made some corn chowder this morning (mmm) for breakfast and it was just what I wanted.    Today's agenda is mostly focusing on my office and trying to get it a little bit straightened up.  I am not a very neat or organised person (ADHD) and sometimes it seems like no matter how much I'd LIKE to be neat and organised, I just can't be.  But I am going through stuff today and trying to get cleaned up a little bit.  Besides that, I have some laundry to put up.    The incision on my hand is looking less red and inflamed than it was.  At one point I was getting convinced I had an infection (and no, I am not a hypochondriac, because a couple of other people said the same thing).  The thumb really isn't any better.  I have to call Dr. Scully's office today.  That reminds me!  I am supposed to call Kelly The Benefits Girl.  I've been meaning to do this for like a week now and somehow I've just managed to consistently forget.  Also, I need to get a look at my schedule for next week.  Gaura Purnima is coming up, and I know I made some adjustments to my schedule to get some extra days off, but because it's out of my regular routine, I can't remember what days I'm supposed to work.  Honestly, and I mean this.. I am not as stupid as I sometimes sound.  I better go make these phone calls before I forget again.  ***And as a further update:  Scully thinks I am doing too much with the hand.  He wants me to splint it and rest it.  That's not really very practical being that I have to work.  Hopefully it will back off soon and I can just get on with things.  It's starting to get very depressing, and I don't like this at all.   urlLink      urlLink ');"> postCount(' ');

      Every day on my way home I drive past  urlLink this place .  It makes me laugh every time.  Their website isn't very good, but if you look carefully, you'll see the name of the cigarettes they sell are Grim Reapers.  They even have a picture of Himself there on the pack.  This cracks me up.  Some people are offended by it.  The guys at the company (I know one of them, not very well, but we had a conversation one day), say, 'Hey, we ain't lying..'  Castle Hayne, NC, is a very, very small town.  This place is literally like a barn in a field.  Out front they have this UPS truck painted black with a huge Reaper on the side, and it says POISON INC and there's a flashing sign that says POISON.  I don't know, maybe I'm twisted.. I think it's so funny.  Every day it makes me smile at the irony of it all.  Everything should have such truth in advertising.  It would be like naming your malt whiskey "CIRRHOSIS INC".  How come everyone beats on the tobacco industry while Budweiser is out making cute commercials?  I don't get that bias, but that's another story.

      I could write about lots of work things this morning, but I'd like to focus on the preaching that seems to have spontaneously manifested there.  First of all, for the past two nights there's been people asking me to teach them the mahamantra, and sporadic chanting happening in patient rooms (one of which was very close to death).  Last night a copy of Bhagavad-gita was distributed, and someone asked some pretty detailed questions after seeing my tilak.  So I am pretty amazed about that.    I feel very good about wearing tilak to work.  I thought at first I would be very self conscious and uncomfortable, but I'm not.  At my last job, the atmosphere was kind of repressive, so I think maybe I had absorbed some of that paranoia.  But here everyone has been very respectful and cool about it.  Lots of people ask, though, and I am glad for that because it brings up opportunities to talk.  Also, I have a beautiful cloisonne pin of Lord Jagannath that I am wearing on my tag, and I feel good about Him smiling on everyone as I go in and out of rooms.  I think wearing tilak is even more helpful to me than it is to anyone else, because it helps me to focus and to remember what my real priorities are.  So recently I was writing about how after a little while (it took about a year at my last job) people learn about you and then when new people ask questions, they jump in and answer for you.  Remember?  Well, it's only taken four months at this job.  It's so cute to watch people as they talk about Krishna and chanting japa and beadbags and being vegetarian.  I get such a kick out of it.  To hear people talking like this is just the greatest thing.  And people saying Hare Krishna!  Does it get better?  It is all totally the mercy of Srila Gurudeva and Srila Prabhupada, giving me encouragement and help.  I'm not doing anything at all-everything is happening to me.  I am hearing rumours again of devotees here in Wilmington.  I am doing some investigating about it, but I have some misgivings on it, because I think if there were ISKCON devotees anywhere here, someone in Hillsborough would know about it.  It just seems odd to me.  Anyway, one of the respiratory therapists swears she knows someone who is a devotee, and she sent my email and phone number to them.  I don't know.  We'll see what happens.  It just seems so very odd to me, somehow.  I made a mistake at work last night and forgot to turn off a heparin drip.  It didn't result in harm to the patient, but it did result in a procedure having to be postponed.  I'm sorry.  I didn't mean it.  Nobody got hurt.  Things happen sometimes.  I am working very hard at learning more about this cardiac stuff.  One of my big focuses (foci?) is learning how to look at these telemetry strips and actually correlate the squiggles with processes happening in the heart.  I am getting a little better at it.  I was fortunate enough last night to have a float pool nurse that's been working cardiac since 1970.  I've known her for years, since the last time I worked at the hospital, and we sat down with a bunch of strips and talked about them.  I did manage to identify a sinus rhythm with a first degree AV (atrioventricular) block and a PVC (premature ventricular contraction) !!! And yes, I was practically crowing, I was so proud of myself.  And I learned about how to recognise atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter, and what the most common cause of a pause is (a nonconducted P wave).  So I am really excited.  She'll be back working with us on the 17th and we are planning to do more.  It is so great when you have someone working with you that knows so much.  If you just ask them to teach you, they will.  Most people don't take advantage of stuff like this.  When people see that you sincerely want to learn, they really go out of their way to help you.  People like to share their knowledge.  How can you bottle 34 years of cardiac experience?  I have to suck people's brains for this kind of stuff, otherwise I'll never learn.  This is probably the biggest thing new grads are missing out on-the lack of really experienced nurses in the hospital anymore.  I mean, even me, I can teach people some things, like basic stuff (I've been a nurse almost ten years now) but my knowledge is all really general medicine and a little rehabilitation.  I don't have any real specialised knowledge, like cardiac, or dialysis, or intensive care.  I'm just a regular old medical floor nurse.  If I have a talent, it's probably that I can spot someone going into DT's from six miles away in the dark, and I have good instincts for when something's going wrong even if I can't pinpoint it.  But what I do, or more accurately, what I've always done, is find really experienced nurses, and pick their brains.  I get them to talk to me, teach me things.  That's what new nurses should learn to do first and foremost.  You can't learn nursing out of a book-you have to learn how to see, and think, and listen to the voice in your head.  That kind of thing you really need to develop, and a good way to do it is to watch it in action.    Kind of like a nursing guru, I'd say.  Anyway, I'm very encouraged about the preaching efforts.  I feel like everything's going fairly well, and I'm motivated to do more.  Also, I'm back on my welding kick again, and I'm really wanting to learn how to do this tig welding.  I have so many projects and ideas in the back of my mind that I could do if I just had the knowledge and the equipment.  I have to do more research on this.   urlLink      urlLink ');"> postCount(' ');

      Once again, given the nature of what I do for a living, it's time to stop and think about death.  This verse, the purport and the 699 other verses accompanying it can be found  urlLink here.  You can also  urlLink email me  and ask me for a copy.  I'll be happy to send you one.   As the embodied soul continuously passes, in this body, from boyhood to youth to old age, the soul similarly passes into another body at death. A self-realized soul is not bewildered by such a change.    PURPORT   Since every living entity is an individual soul, each is changing his body every moment, manifesting sometimes as a child, sometimes as a youth, and sometimes as an old man. Yet the same spirit soul is there and does not undergo any change. This individual soul finally changes the body at death and transmigrates to another body; and since it is sure to have another body in the next birth--either material or spiritual--there was no cause for lamentation by Arjuna on account of death, neither for Bhisma nor for Drona, for whom he was so much concerned. Rather, he should rejoice for their changing bodies from old to new ones, thereby rejuvenating their energy. Such changes of body account for varieties of enjoyment or suffering, according to one's work in life. So Bhisma and Drona, being noble souls, were surely going to have either spiritual bodies in the next life, or at least life in heavenly bodies for superior enjoyment of material existence. So, in either case, there was no cause of lamentation.  Any man who has perfect knowledge of the constitution of the individual soul, the Supersoul, and nature--both material and spiritual--is called a dhira or a most sober man. Such a man is never deluded by the change of bodies. The Mayavadi theory of oneness of the spirit soul cannot be entertained on the ground that the spirit soul cannot be cut into pieces as a fragmental portion. Such cutting into different individual souls would make the Supreme cleavable or changeable, against the principle of the Supreme Soul being unchangeable.    urlLink      urlLink ');"> postCount(' ');

      Well, I called the doctor's office and left a message this morning before I went to sleep and now I have an appointment for tomorrow.  Something has to be done about the hand.  That being said, I got a new HP Pavilion laptop (see below).  It has everything in it-an 80 gig hard drive, a 3.0 ghz pentium 4 processor, a DVD burner and anything else you can think of.  I know this seems excessive but I use the computer so much, I figure let me get as much as I can out of it.  I could have got a lot more memory and stuff for a bit less money but I really wanted the laptop, so I had to make some sacrifices.  It even has the wireless internet thingy so I can set the house up for that in the very near future.  I had a hard time making a decision about a computer.  Scott found this really sexy looking Sony Vaio that has a flip down keyboard and an enormous wide screen.  We almost got that one, but I couldn't adjust the keyboard any, and that would have caused a huge problem.  It took me almost an hour to make a decision.  And I've come to the conclusion that there is something about me that computer geek guys find very attractive.  I don't know what it is (it happens even when I am not buying something, so it isn't the commission) but I'm not sure if it's a compliment or not.  I think it might actually be not a good thing at all.  Anyway, the new laptop has a VERY cool touch screen mouse thing on it which makes it very easy for me to use.  I also got a wireless mouse but that will probably go with this desktop instead.  It will probably take me a couple of weeks to get everything moved over and arranged properly.  And it smokes Sim City 4.   All that being said, I have to work tonight and tomorrow twelves, then I have a class on Wednesday morning for two hours, and I am working an extra eight hours on Wednesday night.  It's gonna be a long week.  I'm just hoping that it's not so bad.  Gurudeva's sweater is at a bit of an impasse.  I made an error somewhere back there and I have a lot to rip out to get the pattern back where it belongs.   urlLink      urlLink ');"> postCount(' ');

      Camera opens on man and woman in livingroom-he is watching a movie on an enormous television, she is sitting nearby on the floor with a laptop computer in front of her.  The movie is Die Hard-the explosions and gunfire are deafening.  He turns down the system with a huge remote control and looks at her.  He: "So, you're telling me, we bought a $2000.00 computer so you can play a $40.00 game?"  She: "Yeah.  Kind of like how we bought a $15,000.00 theater system so you can watch a $9.00 DVD."  He:  "Yeah."  She:  "So it's just the same, really, isn't it?"  (PAUSE)  He:  "We're a couple of idiots."  She:  "Yeah."

      Three things on my mind today:  1. the amount of pain I am having in this hand is unacceptable.  I slept too late to call them yesterday, but Monday morning I am getting on the phone.  2. I am going to be speaking to a college religion class in the next six or eight weeks.  I've written about this before.  I'm really excited, and even more so because I've been asked to bring lunch.  So! Prasadam distribution ki jai! I am working on the menu.  3. I'm seriously contemplating a new computer.  We were going to wait until my birthday but I am not sure I can wait that long.  We'll see.  Any suggestions on something that might be suitable and not too expensive?  And I really want a flat panel monitor.

      Here are some random thoughts for this morning:  1. I went to Walmart earlier.  It's nice to go in the middle of the night.  There was a man there positively having a meltdown that there were three people in line and only one cashier open.  I don't understand what the big rush was.  Where are you going to go, really, at three in the morning?  I mean, back off the Mountain Dew, you know?  Anyway, I wandered around for a while and spent some money.  2.  urlLink Gardenburger  makes vegan meat-substitute meals.  Now, they're very good.  The problem to me, is actually, that they're very good.  It kind of seems just as bad to eat something that tastes identical to meat if you are avoiding meat for ethical reasons.  I mean, what are you saying here?  "Gee, I'd really LIKE to kill and eat you, but I can't do that, so I'm going to make something that is an identical substitute."  ??? I am not sure if I'm explaining this right, but it seems almost like it's just as bad to be eating something that tastes exactly the same.   I bought a few different ones tonight, and I don't know, I have guilt when I eat them.  Seems to me like it's just too close to the real thing.  I'm not sure if you'll understand that, but it's true just the same.  3. I am having, as far as I'm concerned, far too much pain in this hand.  My thumb, especially, is really no different than it was before, and in fact worse.  I am not sure what's going on with it.  I try to use it and do as much therapy with it as I can, but things like doorknobs and turning the car on are still not happening.  Later on this morning I am going to call and talk to his nurse and see if I can get something for it.  The incision looks great.  I am just not liking the amount of pain I am still having here.  4. I got a call from work around 2 AM.  They didn't leave a message, but I somehow knew it was them (we don't have caller ID) so I called them back.  There are some MAJOR staffing issues this morning.  I talked with the charge for a few minutes, but there really wasn't anything I could do personally, so after a mini-lecture on why not to call my house at 2 AM (that's the death call, or it better be if you want to get my butt out of bed), I decided I was just going to go to Walmart.  I was up and dressed anyway.  It is very nice to not have to be on call anymore.  Eileen, our director, stressed in a meeting last week that me and Christy (the day coordinator) only have shift responsibility-in other words, when we go home, that's it.  That's just how I wanted it.  I can't tell you how awful it is to be on call.  5.  There is this charity drive going on called St. Baldrick's Day.  What it is, is that you pledge to shave your head, and people put up money to see you do it, and all the money goes to support children's cancer research.  Now, being that my hair is down to my butt, I figured a lot of people would put up the cold cash to see me shave my head.  It's a good cause.  I was getting myself all psyched up for it, but Scott said absolutely not no way don't ask again and don't even think about doing it.  After I got over my disappointment, I realised it was probably for the best anyway.  How would I keep my nurses' cap on my head if I have no hair?  Duct tape?  Anyway, that's all for this morning.  Have a good day.  Hopefully I'll sleep through most of it.  urlLink      urlLink ');"> postCount(' ');

      My brain is all full up with words like Wenkebach, sinoatrial, supraventricular and aberrancy.  I sat in that class all day and I actually had to take a nap when I got home because my brain was so full it wouldn't let me do anything else.  I have a feeling that at some future yet to be determined moment, all this cardiac stuff is going to make sense to me.  The key words there would be 'future yet to be determined.'    I've gotten used to feeling like I know what I'm doing.  The bleak reality of not really understanding this cardiac business yet is more than a little unsettling and is contributing to an overall sense of insecurity and unease.  I still know how to look at a patient, and some things you don't need to know in order to react.. but I still have this lingering fear that I'll miss something dumb, or make a stupid mistake.  In order to buck myself up and work on my self-confidence I try and remember the day that I spotted the patient having an MI right before my eyes (and this was before we were a cardiac floor) and got intervention in hand right away.  I did that without any special cardiac knowledge at all, didn't I?  So it's just got to get better from there.   The first lecture of the day was on Supraventricular Tachycardia, given by an extremely knowledgeable cardiologist who was completely and utterly over my head.  I'm very sure that she's very smart, but I didn't understand 10% of what she talked about.  That got my day off to a depressing start.  The next lecture, also given by a very well respected cardiologist, was about Concepts of Pacing.  This lecture I understood without any difficulty at all, so that made me feel a lot better.  The last two lectures were on medications for CHF and ACS, and by then all the ritalin had worn off and I was mostly thinking about what I needed to do with the schedule.  Luckily, I sat through those two lectures last week.    I do have a couple more concepts in my head now than I used to.  Let's see what I've learned.  There are several kinds of heart block: 1st degree, second degree type one (Wenkebach or Mobitz I) and two (Mobitz II) and 3rd degree.  In first and second degree blocks it isn't actually a block as much as a delay in conduction.  We can see this in the length of the PR interval, which will be lengthened, indicating that the conduction from the SA node is taking longer to get where it needs to go.  In first degree block, the PR interval will be lengthened but constant.  In Wenkebach, the PR interval progressively lengthens from complex to complex until finally a beat gets dropped.  Then the pattern starts again.  This rhythm is also known as a grouping rhythm or steps in the snow and follows a pretty predictable pattern.  You might not catch this on a six second strip because of the nature of the rhythm.  I can't remember anything off the top of my head about Mobitz II.. but a third degree block is a true block, where the atria and ventricles are not communicating with each other.  This means you might have an atrial rate of say 90 and a ventricular rate of 40.  This requires pacing.  Other things I've learned today:  any time you have a rate of greater than 160 and a p wave, this is a supraventricular tachycardia.  The BNP, or b-naturetic peptide, is an indicator for congestive heart failure.  A level less than 100 indicates that it's probably not CHF, and a level greater than 400 indicates it probably is.  Inbetween levels can designate the severity of the failure.  BNP has an inherent diuretic effect and in synthetic form is given as Natrecor.  If you are going to draw a BNP on a patient on Natrecor, you have to d/c the drip two hours previous so you don't skew the results.  Symptoms of hyperkalemia include nausea, confusion, restlessness, and abdominal pain.    Don't you just love random regurgitation of facts like this?  Good grief.  Maybe I'm learning something after all.  I bet you didn't want to get a micro lecture in heart block today, but I figure, if I had to sit through it, so do you.  It'll come in time, I suppose.. it's sinking in little by little.  I also learned today that on a telemetry strip, you're essentially looking at what would be lead II on a 12 lead EKG.   urlLink      urlLink ');"> postCount(' ');

      Here is a letter I wrote this morning to a devotee in China who has a friend that is worried that a vegetarian diet isn't healthy:  Haribol,  I would think that in China especially people would be more inclined NOT to eat meat.  Is she worried about protein?  Tofu is an excellent protein substitute.  In fact at least here in the US people eat too much protein.  The increase in protein that the kidneys have to deal with results in calcium being taken out of bones, and this results in osteoporosis, very fragile bones that can easily break.  This is actually a very serious problem here and billions of dollars are spent every year fixing broken hips that are due to osteoporosis, which again is partly caused by a diet too high in protein.  Additionally, the high fat and cholesterol amounts found in a meat-based diet can also contribute to heart disease by increasing the chances for plaque buildup inside of the arteries.  This plaque can block blood vessels and cause strokes, heart attacks, all kinds of heart disease, and possibly/potentially death.  By lowering the amount of fat and cholesterol in the diet (most easily done by removing animal products from the diet, as cholesterol is only found in animal products) people can control their cholesterol levels and significantly reduce their chances for a heart attack or other cardiac disease.  A meat based diet is also ecologically unsound as it requires vast amounts of resources to produce.  For example, it takes sixteen pounds of grain to produce one pound of beef.  This sixteen pounds of grain could be used to feed approximately 48 people.  One pound of beef can feed my husband one meal.  So it is very wasteful in terms of consuming excess resources, both in grain and water, and contributes directly to the global problem of hunger. In the United States alone, 80% of the grain grown is fed to livestock, not people.  If just ten percent of the land now used for growing livestock feed were used to grow grains for human consumption, we could significantly impact the problem of starvation throughout the world. Farming livestock also negatively impacts the environment by creating massive amounts of water pollution.  This is something that here in North Carolina where I live we have to deal with on a very personal level, since there are a high number of hog farms in the area.  These farms stink for miles around as well as make the water unusable. Recently, mad cow disease has been in the news again, as well as particularly in China, outbreaks of SARS being traced to people eating civet cats.  Both of these diseases would not be transmitted to humans if they didn't eat these animals.  Also, in this country at least, meat is very expensive compared to the cost of beans/legumes and cereal grains.  So one can save a lot of money by removing meat from the diet.  A vegetarian diet has also been scientifically proven to increase performance and endurance in athletes.  Despite what the media would like for people to believe, changing to a vegetarian diet actually improved stamina and recovery time in athletes.  So there is no real basis for believing that a meatless diet is harmful to the health.  In countries all over the world, people have been following vegetarian diets successfully for thousands of years.  Many studies have shown that people who live in a country or culture that favours a non-meat-centred diet suffer less cardiovascular, kidney, and gastric disease as well as less cancers.  This is due to a variety of factors-the decrease in fibre, the increased fat, cholesterol, and protein, and also the fact that pesticides and environmental pollutants become concentrated in meat tissues (and are eaten by the person).  At first it was thought that this was simply due to genetic factors, but it was later shown that when people changed to a western, meat-based diet, their rates of all the above diseases and cancers soon matched those of western countries.  From an ethical standpoint, the way most animals raised for livestock are treated is disgusting.  Animals are abused, crammed into cages too small, beaten to death, starved, force fed, bled to death, and subjected to all kinds of tortures and torments before finally being killed.  Even in the United States, which prides itself on being so advanced and liberal, the treatment of animals on farms is unregulated, and horrible things happen all the time.  Animals, especially birds, are regularly mutilated, packed into cages that prevent them from moving at all, have tubes shoved down their throats to be force fed, and are basically driven to insanity by the conditions they are forced to live in.  Despite activist groups bringing this to people's attention, they continue to eat meat and thus allow this cruelty to continue.  By eating a meat-based diet, we participate in this circle of violence.  A great number of philosophers and spiritually advanced people have come to the conclusion that we cannot advance ourselves on a spiritual platform if we continue to allow innocent beings to be victimised and tortured for our own pleasure, and that the move towards a nonviolent lifestyle is absolutely necessary if we are going to make any spiritual progress. This conclusion has been reached by people from every religious persuasion as well as non-religious philosophers.  So for reasons of health, environmental concern, ethical consideration and also to improve one's economic development, a meatless diet is the way to go.  As a nurse I am confident on a scientific level that a vegetarian diet is more healthy than a meat-based one.  My personal experience is that in the years I have been a vegan and vegetarian I have experienced no adverse effects to my health.  In addition, my husband, who continues to eat meat (but not beef) on an occasional basis, has reported that at the times he does eat meat, he doesn't feel well afterwards, and often suffers from stomach upset.  (Why he continues to do it, I don't know.)  So I hope that your friend will take all these factors into consideration when making some decisions about her diet.  And I hope that this has been helpful.  :)  Love Satyavati   urlLink      urlLink ');"> postCount(' ');

      There wasn't the first bit of snow.  It's very sunny and 48 degrees out although it's right windy today.  My hand is STILL hurting me quite a bit, especially in the area of the thumb.  I ordered a brace for it, but I'm just hoping it's going to get better, because this is going to really bite if I went through that surgery for nothing.   Factoid : Wilmington, North Carolina, where we live, has more restaurants per capita than anywhere else in the United States.    People don't cook here.  We do, but most people don't.  Most people around here eat out a minimum of three nights a week, and I know people personally who have never used their ovens.  I'm not quite sure how you can live like that, but they do.  It has to be so expensive.  I like to cook, personally.  I'd say we order pizza twice a month and Chinese once a month.  But beyond that, no, I like to cook.  So the moral of this story is, if you're thinking of opening a restaurant (especially if it's a Govinda's!!!), you will want to move to Wilmington.  It really is a nice place for the most part, except when we're having a hurricane.   urlLink      urlLink ');"> postCount(' ');

      Just finished watching a show about Atlantis.  They presented different theories about where it might be, was it a myth, etc.  Lots of different scientists from around the world expressed their opinions.  I heard things I've heard before-that the island of Santorini (Greece) was really Atlantis, that the Minoan civilisation was really Atlantis.  I heard some things I hadn't before; that perhaps Troy was Atlantis, and that the Minoans eventually settled in Israel and became known as the Philistines of Biblical  fame.  One thing I hadn't heard before revolves around Ignatious Donnelly and  urlLink his book, Atlantis: The Antediluvian World .  The only reason this actually interested me was because when I was younger, one of my very favourite songs was by a man named Donovan (think Mellow Yellow, Sunshine Superman, etc) and called Atlantis.  So I found out tonight that Donovan got just about 100% of his ideas about Atlantis (and thus the body of his song) from that book by Ignatious Donnelly.  All right, so that was kind of interesting.  But what I thought was so strange really was that nobody's ever thought to correlate any of this with the Vedic literatures.  These writings span millions of years of the earth's history, and cover in great detail events and people that were around thousands and millions of years ago.  The city of Dwarka, in fact, in India, sunk into the ocean after Krsna left.  That was 5,000 years ago.  How come anyone hasn't looked here and made these correlations?  So science overall is looking, but not looking everywhere.  Why is that?  Is it ignorance?  Not putting stock in the writings of India versus, perhaps, the writings of the Greeks?  Or is it that the obvious is easily overlooked?  A text that states for itself that it covers X million of years or describes events that happened in X age, which is easily self-dated, may be too obvious for people to believe.  I'm not exactly sure why.  But this is happening quite blatantly, and I sure would like to know what the reasoning is behind it.  Vedic literatures speak of four ages (yugas) of the world, each progressively more degraded.  This age of the world we are in now is Kali-yuga, the most degraded, and the age of quarrel and violence.  In this age people have a shortened lifespan (which will continue to shrink as kaliyug progresses) and diminished physical capacity as well as poor morals and a tendency to irreligion.  Ultimately, at the end of kaliyug, (not scheduled to occur for another 432,000 years), the world as we know it will be annihilated by the last incarnation of Krishna, Lord Kalki, who arrives on a white horse bearing a sword to demolish the evil in the world.  Now anyone who knows anything about Revelation can instantly draw some parallels there.  I won't even bother going into it for you, because it's so amazingly obvious.  Anyway, following Lord Kalki's advent and decimation of the world, the whole cycle begins again, with a Golden age, wherein people have long lifespans, thousands of years, and greatly elevated principles and morals.  It is because of living in kaliyuga that we chant Hare Krishna.  In other ages where people had enormous lifetimes, they could spend the thousands of years needed in meditation, or to perform elaborate sacrifices.  But now, we have at best a hundred years, and we live in a world full of degradation and irreligion.  We aren't as intelligent or as morally upright, and so we are unable to sit in meditation, or perform enormous sacrifices, or to learn all of the Vedas.  For us, we require something simple and easy that we are able to perform even in our downgraded condition.  So Lord Caitanya stated that specifically for us in Kaliyuga, the proper way to achieve love of God is to chant His names:  Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare   This was a special concession to us because of the times we live in.  Anyway, I'd still like to know why no one's noticed this.  Chant Hare Krishna and be happy.  urlLink      urlLink ');"> postCount(' ');

      We're in the middle of a Winter Storm Warning.  We're supposed to get snow by 8AM.  I'm doubting it.  Right now it's 35 degrees out and the radar is clear as can be.  So I don't know what they're talking about.  As per usual, it's 2AM and I'm up.  Today I have to go to a Kronos class.  Kronos is the timekeeping software we use at work.  Then tomorrow, I have an all-day class on cardiac stuff again.  The hospital is really hot on education now that they have this magnet designation.  Today is Siva Ratri.  This is the day when women particularly will ask Lord Siva to give blessings on their husbands.  The best blessing, of course, would be that one's husband become Krishna conscious, and that, as always, is my prayer.  Here are some prayers in honor of Siva Ratri:  Srila Raghunatha dasa Gosvami has composed a prayer in his Vraja Vilas Stava:   muda gopendrasyatmaja bhuja parisranga nidhaye sphurad gopirvrndair yam iha bhagavatam pranayibhih/ bhajadbhistair bhaktya svamabhilasitam praptam acirad yamitire gopisvaram anudinam tam kila bhaje  "I daily worship Gopisvara Mahadeva, who is situated on the bank of Yamuna. That very Gopisvara was worshipped with deep devotion by the gopis. Gopisvara Mahadeva quickly fulfilled their desire to attain a supremely precious jewel in the form of the embrace of the son of Nanda Maharaja."  Sri Sanatana Gosvami has also written in Sri Brhad Bhagavatamrta:  vrindavanavani-pate jaya soma soma-maule sanaka-sanandana-sanatana-naradedya gopisvara! vraja-vilasi-yuganghri-padme prema prayaccha nirupadi namo namaste  "O gatekeeper of Vrindavana! O Soma, all glories to you! O you whose crest is decorated with the moon. You are worshipable for the sages, Sanat, Sanaka, Sanandana, and Sanatana, and by Narada! O Gopisvara! Desiring that you bestow upon me prema for the lotus-feet of Sri Sri Radha-Madhava who perform joyous pastimes in Vraja-dhama, I offer pranamas unto you time and again."   urlLink      urlLink ');"> postCount(' ');

      I'm not working tonight.  The census was 22.  This would ordinarily be a really good thing except I'm having an inordinate amount of pain in this wrist.  I haven't had this much pain before in it, and I'm not sure to be disturbed or what by it.  Anyway, it's interfering with knitting, which means sitting in front of the TV is out, and being on the computer is rapidly becoming not an option, which is really going to limit me for the next eight or ten hours.  If I can't sleep, and I slept good today, this is going to be one long night.  I could go and study  urlLink this  if I was ambitious, but I don't think I'm really up to it right now.  I'm just kind of aggravated.  There's less than ten inches to go on the back of this sweater and then I can get on to the front, but I can't do it if this hand isn't going to cooperate.  I thought this surgery was supposed to FIX this problem, not exacerbate it.  I've been knitting steadily since I got the cast bandage taken off.  Why is it bothering me now?  This is day seventeen post op, I shouldn't be having any problems with it at all.  I even took some Aleve earlier, but it hasn't seemed to help at all.

      Apparently in some parts of NC they had snow today.  I am not sure yet whether or not I'm working tonight.  This depends on the census.  If it's low, they're going to call me off, because I'm coming in late (11) and what would be the point?  I never entertain any actual hope on this kind of thing, but it would be nice.    I've got all kinds of ideas in embryo as it were about things I'd like to write about, but I just haven't got to that stage of fruition yet.  I apologise.  I know I write very regularly here and for me to go 24 or 36 hours or even longer without anything beyond a couple of sentences is really unusual, but I would rather wait and put up something that's at least worth reading (in my opinion-you are welcome to yours) than just write something for the sake of writing.  It's like my synapses are all tangled up in gridlock or something lately.  I think I've spent too much time trying to learn how to read these EKGs, it has me all mudfuddled.  I've got my schedule all arranged and I'll have twelve days off in the beginning of April for Gurudeva's visit.  The nice thing about working three days a week is being able to do physics on the schedule like that and get twelve days off for the cost of only three PDOs.    Anyway, just like everything, this difficulty too shall pass, and things will get back to normal.  I just need to be a little patient.  You do too.  Thanks.

      I actually have a plan for a very nice Valentine's day post, if I have time to do it, but I just wanted to notate a couple of things here.  1. It's the middle of the night again and I've been up all night.  One nice thing about this is that I'm really whipping up on Gurudeva's sweater.  If I can keep going like this it'll be almost done by the end of the month. Then I have to work on Lord Nrsimhadeva's chaddar! 2. For Valentine's day I got Scott those RBH rear channel speakers he wanted, and a box of chocolates.  He was actually surprised, which doesn't happen often as I am way too obvious and can't keep a secret as well as he being extraordinarily perceptive about stuff.  Actually it was a last minute decision on my way home from work. 3. I got a lovely letter from Leslie, who is one of the people who read my blog regularly.  Thank you very much.  I'm hoping to have some time to respond today :) 4.  I'm going to be involved in a couple of interesting little projects at work.  One is a cultural diversity program (I love stuff like that) and another is tracking our admissions to look at utilisation of telemetry.  I'm not quite sure when I'll have the time to do either of these things but being in my position they sort of expect you to do some extra research types of things.    I don't feel particularly well this morning.  I feel like going to sleep, but then I'll be up around noon, and I have to work tonight.  This whole working nights thing is just hell on the system.  I feel quite bad that I haven't been utilising (twice in one post! how often does that happen?) this blog quite properly lately.  I promise I will focus on spiritual matters more consistently.  Seems like all I talk about lately is nursing, and I do enough of that at work.  The blog is for more important things than that.   urlLink      urlLink ');"> postCount(' ');

      I spent all day today in a class all about cardiac stuff.  My brain is pretty full.  I know in time it will get easier, but right now it just seems kind of overwhelming and too much to deal with.  You know, for the past ten years I've said I never wanted to specialise.  I always wanted to be a general medical (not surgical) nurse.  One of the reasons I chose Geriatrics as a unit when I applied back to the hospital was because it was a general unit.  And now, through no fault of my own, I'm a cardiac nurse.  Why?  I never wanted to be a cardiac nurse.    The obvious answer would be, 'well, dummy, if you don't want to be there, leave.'  I've never been one to go for the obvious.  It's too easy.  This must have happened for a reason, just like everything else and every situation I've ever found myself in.  I am not sure yet exactly why, but there's some purpose to this.  Who knows?  Maybe I'll fall in love with it.  Maybe in a year I'll decide I've had enough and go back to medicine.  Maybe I'll do it long enough to get us moved out of here, and then do nothing at all.  I don't know.  It's not that I don't want to be there, it's just that it isn't fitting in with what I thought my plan was.  Maybe that's the lesson itself, hmm?  The plan's not mine to make.  Maybe that's what this lesson is all about.  Only time will tell.   urlLink      urlLink ');"> postCount(' ');

      So the speakers are still really new and we are still in the phase of re-listening to everything we own to see how much better it sounds on the new setup than it did on the old.  Okay, he's right.  They DO sound better.  But he pointed something out that sort of made me sit back and realise how old we are.  There we were, listening to King Crimson's 'In The Court of The Crimson King', which was released, incidentally, the year after I was born.  (For those of you with math skills like mine, that means it's 35 years old.)  Anyway, besides the fact that we even know that such an album exists, I happened to call it an 'album'.  I didn't know that people don't call albums albums anymore.  Now they just call them CDs.  Like (according to Scott) a kid would never say something like, 'Oh, Limp Bizkit has a new album out.'  They'd say, 'Oh, Limp Bizkit has a new CD out.'    It made me feel so old, you know?  My terminology is becoming obsolete.  I'm going to go the way of Betamax.  It kind of made me realise we're really getting old.  Of course, it didn't help that in Best Buy tonight I got '70's Hits'.  Do you know I know all the words to 'The Night Chicago Died'?  In the car on the way home I was singing 'One Toke Over The Line'.  Does anyone besides me even remember that song?  The whole thing with old music is that it brings back memories to you.  The sound quality isn't really as important to me as the nostalgia factor.  For example, about ten years ago (almost) when I was in nursing school, it was my last week of clinicals and we were in PCU (at that time, it was called Post Intensive Care Unit or ICU Stepdown).  My clinical instructor, Regina, and I were in the hallway discussing my patient.  In retrospect, it seems like just about every patient I got throughout all of nursing school was essentially the same-just about to peak in the DTs.  (As a side note, do you know what the DTs are?  This is 'delirium tremens'.. which is basically what happens when someone has been drunk for way too long and suddenly stops-alcohol withdrawal.  They go through the whole nine yards of hallucinations, combativeness, pukeyness, sometimes seizures, and then an amazing case of obnoxious as the alcohol begins to fade and you see the personality underneath.  I can say this.  I've been through the DTs twice, and neither time with the luxury of a hospital bed.  Digression over.)  Anyway, so we were out there discussing it, and she said, 'Okay look.  What you've basically got going on here is a guy who's one toke over the line.'  With perfect timing we both broke out in song and we sang it straight through without stopping before almost collapsing in hysterics.  I don't know, maybe you had to be there, but it's become a benchmark for me.  Anyway, I sang it all the way home and it brought back fond memories of nursing school.  And ever since then, too, bringing people through the DTs has been one of my very favourite things to do as a nurse.  Most nurses wouldn't want to touch that sort of thing with a ten foot pole, but I've always gotten a kick out of it.  But I have limits, too.  The minute they get sober, in my mind it becomes psych nursing, and I'm done.  I don't want anything to do with it once they can make complete oriented sentences.  It's the whole hallucinations and locked leather restraints part with librium and ativan that I get a kick out of.  Isn't nursing grand!   urlLink      urlLink ');"> postCount(' ');

      I just called the sheriff's department on our nextdoor neighbour to report a noise problem.  This isn't the first time I've ever done this, and it won't be the last.  It's sort of like the rotation of the earth by the moon: something that happens and you just can't stop it.  In all fairness I must say the music has been louder in the past and there is a marginal possibility that he may not actually realise that it's loud enough to wake me from sleep despite the fact that I went well over 30 hours with no sleep prior to finally falling asleep.  However, unlike my husband (He Who Cannot Be Roused), I have absolutely no tolerance for this kind of thing.  We live in one of America's most horrific institutions: The Planned Community.  This is capitalism at its finest: a calculated plan to house four families per acre in single-family dwellings.  It's a nice place, but it comes at a cost.  The House Police make Stalin's Russia seem like Disneyworld.  These retirement-age,  self-righteous suburban dictators roll through here on adult tricycles like Hitler observing the troops in review, making sure you've got your crabgrass under control and the height of your fence in strict compliance with The Covenants.  You'd think it was God and Abraham the way they talk about The Covenants, and quite frankly, The Homeowners Association might as well be The Holy Trinity the way these folks wield power.    Anyway, what I'd like for you to imagine is your stereotypical (and I dislike stereotypes, but I'm trying to give you an accurate picture here) late-30's southern redneck boy.  I'm talking drunk at eleven in the morning riding the John Deere mower (on the quarter acre).  Confederate flag flying proudly in the back yard.  Blew a hole through the roof once playing with the shotgun. Takes the Harley out in the driveway, spends five minutes redlining it, and puts it back in the garage four or five times a day.  Had a sticker on the old truck saying 'This Country Was Built By White Men With Guns'. Second wife took off about a month ago.  Do you have the image clear now?  We (myself and the neighbour) had a jolly brawl about five or six years ago when he woke me up one morning beating a labrador puppy with a belt.  He Who Cannot Be Roused was not at home that fateful morning, but I had to call him quite frantic at work to come home before our house (and me specifically) got blown full of shotgun holes.  Despite the fact that we are (damn) Yankees, my good husband manages to get along with this man in a cordial and quite friendly manner.  (That's because, as I said at his job the other day, 'Everybody loves Scott.')  Anyway, I have extremely little tolerance for this loud music in the middle of the night crap.  I'm not one of these people who calls the sheriff screaming or creating a scene.  I don't even want to talk to the deputy, personally, because I'd rather let him wonder which one of his neighbours called.  In a neighbourhood where four houses share one acre, you have to have some sort of awareness that sound carries, particularly the sound generated by bigass Kicker subwoofers.  Now please.  You know what our theatre system is like in this house, and nobody appreciates fine acoustics quite like we do.  But not at two in the morning.     Now, typically the way this goes is that the deputy will come out, the music will get shut off for fifteen or twenty minutes (long enough for me to just barely fall back to sleep) and then it'll start up again.  And then I'll call again.  This pattern gets repeated two or three times, or until about four-thirty AM, whichever comes first, and then, when all real chance for quality REM sleep has been obliterated, the music will cease.  I got a call yesterday afternoon just after I got home from work telling me I needed to come in this morning at 8 AM for a meeting with me, the day coordinator, the manager and the director.  This will mean that I will be at work for one reason or another every day for seven days straight.  I wouldn't say I'm exactly bitchy, but I am tired.  Regardless.  I used to get myself all in a state when I called the cops like this.  Then I got over it.  If it's loud enough to wake me up, it's too loud.  There's probably 50 feet between his house and ours.  It's the middle of the night.  Grow up, shut up, sober up, and let me sleep.  End of rant.   urlLink      urlLink ');"> postCount(' ');

      We just watched a show about this man named Alan Page.  If you don't know who he is, he was defensive player in the NFL.  He grew up in Canton, Ohio, and first played for the Bears.  He had nine consecutive pro bowl appearances.  After he got married, he decided to go to law school, while still playing football.  Despite having to deal with prejudice and racism (see previous post for my views on this) he persevered.  The Bears let him go and he moved to the Vikings, leading the team in sacks and blocked kicks in his first season with them.  He was very instrumental in the Players Association and provided a lot of leadership fighting for players' rights.  Ultimately, he retired from football with a stellar career behind him.  From there, he finished law school, passed the bar, and began in a private practice.  After several years of this, he moved on to work in the Minnesota Attorney General's office.  Deciding from there that he wanted to pursue an appointment on the Minnesota State Supreme Court, he successfully sued the Governor of Minnesota and blocked a lengthening of term of one of the justices currently sitting at the time, and then won a vote to obtain a seat on the bench as a Supreme Court Justice in the state of Minnesota, becoming not only the first black supreme court justice in the state, but also the first person to win a statewide election for same.  Justice Page also runs the Page Education Foundation, sponsoring over 3400 scholarships for highschool students in need to provide educational opportunities for those who would otherwise not have them.  Because of the Foundation, kids have gone on to become doctors, lawyers, nurses, and other professional people.  This man is absolutely incredible.  He was inducted into the NFL Hall of Fame.  He proved he was not only physically talented but incredibly gifted with intelligence.  Through all his stunning success he's never allowed it to inflate his ego or blur his vision, and has always remained true to his vision of helping children through bettering education.  I was just so incredibly humbled, touched, and impressed by this man.  I don't even have the right words to express how awesome he actually is.  I guess you can maybe judge how impressed I was by how well I paid attention through the whole thing, even without my ritalin.  What a role model.  I wish I could be more like that.   urlLink      urlLink ');"> postCount(' ');

      OK.  First things first.  You gotta read this story.  A nurse at the hospital I work at went to New Mexico and got chewed on by a pack of sixteen wild dogs.  It's unbelievable but true.   urlLink Read it here .  Next.  You know what irritates me?  There is this incredible longstanding bias against smoking on television.  Now, okay, you shouldn't smoke.  This is coming from someone who smoked more than 20 years before giving it up (Hare Krishna!).  But the problem is that in between these "TRUTH" commercials about the horrors of smoking, there's incredibly cute Wingman (and the new WingTail featuring a very cute dog) commercials all about beer.  Now, maybe I'm an idiot. But I've never heard of anyone smoking a cigarette, getting in a car, and killing five innocent people because they were impaired.  Why isn't there more anti-drinking stuff on television?  Drinking is worse than smoking in my opinion.  This is coming from someone who has been sober almost fourteen years (Hare Krishna!).  But the point of the matter is, if you're going to bust smoking, then you ought to bust drinking.  Nailing the tobacco industry while letting the alcohol industry get off scot free seems to be suspect in my book.  Someone's paying someone off here.  So.  Moving on to the next bit of rant-a-roni, last night could have been worse.  It could have been better, I assure you.  My hand is NOT really ready for this.  I had no idea how much it was going to hurt to actually write.  For all the typing and knitting I've done, I haven't done hardly any writing, and it hurts to hold a pen.  Plus I haven't had any pain medicine for it in over 24 hours now and that doesn't help at all.  Plus I had cramps and some whiny nurses to deal with.  I can't stand a whiny nurse.  I'd rather have the cramps.   I can't help it when some things happen.  I do the best I can.  That's my job.  But regardless of how well I do my job, some things are going to happen that we don't like.  I can't help that.  Learn to live with it, people.  If you can't handle it, go work at Walmart.  That's what I always say I'm gonna do when I'm grown up and done with nursing.  I want to be the greeter at Walmart.  "Hi! Welcome to Walmart!  Would you like a buggy or a basket?"  See? I can do it.  Actually, what I want to be is a paleontologist.  I keep thinking I'll take some geology classes at UNCW.    Anyway, I have to be back at the hospital in just under four hours for that class.  I'm not working tonight, so that will be not-so-bad, and then tomorrow I have another class all day long, and then off on Friday, and work through Monday.  I am going to try very, very hard to not fall asleep during this class.  I don't even know what it's about.  I just know it must be pretty important for my boss to tell me to go ahead and take myself off the schedule so I can make it.  It's kind of raw and nasty out there today.  It would be a good day to sleep, but I won't get more than a nap in late this afternoon.  I got some tilak from a friend of mine that came from Radha-kunda, which is the absolute holiest place on this planet.  It's pretty amazing.  It smells unbelievable.  I will write more on tilak tonight.  I also got some very nice Deity photos from another friend in Detroit and some very nice embroidered beadbags (I have a fetish for embroidered beadbags.  I am embarrassed to tell you how many I have.) as a gift.  I am going to put together some nice things and send back some presents.  It's so nice to get presents in the mail like that.  I suppose I ought to find something to eat and try to find my ritalin.  I do NOT like working without it.  I should have a note from the doctor that says I don't have to work if I don't have my ritalin.  It just makes life so much easier.  Have a good day and chant Hare Krishna to be happy.   urlLink      urlLink ');"> postCount(' ');

      Oh did I ever sleep good today.  Can you believe it?  I've been assigned to a class tomorrow from noon-2, so I got taken off tomorrow night's schedule.  This isn't as bad as it sounds, because then I work tonight, class tomorrow, off Thursday, class Friday, work Saturday Sunday 12s and then an 8 on Monday.  Oh yeah, the life of a nurse.  Coordinator, no less.  Doesn't it make you want to be me?  Our dog, Bree (short for Aubrey Rose) is a chow/pit mix (are you cringing?) that we rescued back in 98.  She had a broken leg and they would have put her down if we hadn't claimed her.  So she was just a baby (4 mos) and so we had the surgery done and all.  Anyway, at the time we had cats, but they've been gone now for a couple of years and she is very firmly established as The Dog of the House.  She loves people.  All people, any people.  People who want to break in, I'm sure, she would welcome with open paws.  But she hates animals.  And insects.  Birds.  Frogs.  Anything non-human that moves.  Very territorial, she is.  Anyway, the people nextdoor have this black cat, probably not even six months old now, that got in our backyard and was sitting outside our back door.  The dog went nuts, and so after a minute of trying to shoo the cat away, we figured, okay, let's let her have at it.  Well, she went nuts chasin the cat across the yard.  The cat thought it could get out through the fence (major misjudgement) but couldn't, so they went around and around for about 15 seconds and then the cat took off and got over the fence before my lil watchdog could get to her.  Was this mean?  You shoulda seen her with every bit of fur on her whole body all sticking straight up like she was somebody.  And that kink in her tail was so tight it had to hurt.  She was like, Look at me! Look at me! Look what I did!  Normally she does 'perimeter patrols' around the fence every time she's outside.  Now she's got her nose stuffed up against the door trying to get a whiff of that cat.  I got a feeling she's just dying for that cat to try coming in our yard again.    Don't worry, I wouldn't have let her kill the cat or anything.  Bree's got a bad leg.  She's not all that fast, and the backyard is uneven, so she hops-the one leg is 2" shorter than the others.  I just wanted her to feel fulfilled in her role as a protector and guardian.  Let her earn that spot on my pillow, you know?  At least we know what she'll be dreaming about when she's barking in her sleep tonight.  Yall have a good night.  I'm gonna go take on  urlLink New Hanover .   urlLink      urlLink ');"> postCount(' ');

      I'm cleared and ready for takeoff.  Back to work tonight. Now, don't think that just because I say it that way, it means I actually WANT to go back to work.  I am perfectly happy staying home and someday when we're moved and settled and paid off, I'm going to just work part time.  I've never been a feminist.  I grew up wanting to be Donna Reed.  You know, wearing high heels and dresses in the kitchen with my frilly apron and a string of pearls all the time.  Oh yeah.    At least today looks like a relatively decent day for sleeping.  You watch, I won't be able to get a wink.  The dog has taken to sleeping on my pillow when I am not around.  On my pillow.  She's actually too big for it but somehow she manages to cram herself onto it.  I wouldn't mind so much if it was just my side of the bed, or if she moved when I tried to get in the bed.  Rotten thing.  She runs this house, and she knows it.  But she's so   cute!!     urlLink      urlLink ');"> postCount(' ');

      I just got an email from work informing me that I've lost another nurse on nights.  There's a nice 'welcome back' for you.  Just for the sake of full disclosure: every person who comes to this website is tracked.  Did you know that?  I get your  domain , sometimes your  IP address , the  website that referred you here , the  time you got here ,  how long you stayed , and  how many page views you got .  All of that information every time you come here.  So I know that not only are there people who actually read this blog (the meter is set to ignore me, so it only counts actual visits), but there are people who read it  loyally .  As in several times a day.  Quite a few of you.  For some strange reason only one of these people ever leaves me a comment, but in case y'all thought you were anonymous, you're not.    Thanks for reading my blog anyway.  I sure do wish you'd participate, but I just wanted to let you know that I know you're there even though you don't... and that I appreciate you just the same.  Have a good night.   urlLink      urlLink ');"> postCount(' ');

      We took a picture of my hand sans stitches.  Is that gross?  I really wanted a picture with the stitches IN it, but I couldn't manage to take one myself.    Anyway, they told me it was going to continue to hurt for another 4-6 weeks.  Super.  I am hoping that I'm not working on any exceedingly short nights, because as it stands right now, it's only at about 60%.  I'm going to go to bed very early tonight in the hopes of getting up around 1AM and being able to get some sleep tomorrow day, but wouldn't it just be a kick in the pants if I slept through.   urlLink      urlLink ');"> postCount(' ');

      One of the most cliche'd images that comes to my mind when people talk about racism is the vision of the white supremacist sitting at a desk in front of the American flag with a Bible and a shotgun before him.  So many people have used or try to use and still to this day use religion as an excuse for racism and other forms of prejudice, and they're absolutely dead wrong.   I could give you a long list of quotes from the Bible, the Koran, the Dhammapada and the Bhagavad gita (which collectively cover the Judeo-Christian, Islamic, Buddhist and Hindu worlds, a substantial majority of the earth's population), but I decided that it would be much simpler and to the point to simply explain why there's no logical excuse for racism from a religious perspective or otherwise.   We are not the body.   It's that simple.    This material body that we get at birth has absolutely nothing to do with who we are as people.  What's the difference between a living body and a dead body?  Consciousness-the presence of the soul.  Anyone who's ever seen a person actually die (I have) knows that there is a moment of death, and you can actually see that moment when the consciousness leaves the body, and the life goes with it.  The actual 'person' is the spirit, not the flesh and blood it rides around in.  The body is like a Yugo.  It's well made, on average, but fragile, and subject to problems like disease.  It gets old, breaks down.  Sometimes even from birth you get a lemon, that has chronic problems and dysfunctions with it.  It's a body, that's all.  It doesn't make you who or what you are.  In this material world we like to assign everything by material designations: I'm white, I'm female, I'm American, I'm poor, I'm this, I'm that.  What we fail to realise is that all of these material designations are absolutely meaningless in the big picture.  The soul goes through countless bodies again and again, life after life, and the body we get in this life is because of something that happened in a past life.  It's purely arbitrary, and at the end of this life, we'll get another body that might not be anything like this one.  So we make all these designations that really have no meaning at all.  Once we can understand that we have nothing to do with the body beyond riding around in it, we can see that prejudice is a material conception based on false understanding.  It's like judging me because I drive around in a white 1995 Jeep Wrangler.  I'm not the car.  The car can't do anything without me driving it-it has no life or capability on its own.  When I, the soul, drive the body of the car, it does lots of things.  But nobody mistakes me for my car.  The understanding is clear that the car has no power of its own.  Neither does the body-without the spirit in it, it's just a lump of flesh that ultimately decays and deteriorates.  So when we look at people, we have to understand that all these physical, cultural and social differences are temporary.  As spirit souls, we don't have any of these designations-there's no such thing as 'American' souls vs. 'Cambodian' souls vs. 'Russian' souls, or black or white, or female or male for that matter.  The designations are a false creation based upon temporary housing of the soul, and therefore just an expression of ignorance.  With or without prejudice attached to it, the designations are an expression of ignorance.  We also recognise that ALL living beings, not just humans, are eternal spirit souls in different bodily forms than human ones, and that they deserve the same respect and care as we do-hence vegetarianism and the principle of ahimsa or nonviolence.  We can just as easily obtain an animal body in our next life as a human one, or a nonmoving entity such as a plant or tree.  Every living being has a soul.  So anyone can see that prejudice is ignorant behaviour based upon an ignorant premise.  People who try to use religion as an excuse for prejudice are even worse, because every major religious tradition in the world teaches that we are all ultimately brothers and sisters (ha, there I go with material designations) and should be loved as we love ourselves.  Tolerance can be found in both the Koran and the Bible.  Eastern religions recognise the presence of the soul in ALL living things and advocate nonviolence towards all creatures, what to speak of simply humans.  So with just a bit of logic and seeing things as they really are (not as we'd like them to be) we can understand that racism, sexism, nationalism and other forms of prejudice are expressions of ignorance, based only on temporary material nature, and not on the eternal truth of the spirit soul.   urlLink      urlLink ');"> postCount(' ');

      Chapter 2, Verse 11.  The Blessed Lord said: While speaking learned words, you are mourning for what is not worthy of grief. Those who are wise lament neither for the living nor the dead.   Chapter 2, Verse 12.  Never was there a time when I did not exist, nor you, nor all these kings; nor in the future shall any of us cease to be.   Chapter 2, Verse 13.  As the embodied soul continuously passes, in this body, from boyhood to youth to old age, the soul similarly passes into another body at death.

      Last Valentine's day weekend my friend Anne and I took off and drove to NYC.  This was quite an adventure.  Luckily for posterity we videotaped the whole thing and called it Two Fat Women in A Jeep.  Unfortunately, I don't know where the video is now.  I think she's got it.  Anyway, the first thing you have to understand is the transportation issue.  We live in Wilmington, NC, which is roughly 710 miles from NYC.  I don't drive on interstates if I can help it, and I am positively phobic about i-95, so whenever I go to NY, I drive up 17.  Now most people think this takes a lot longer, but it actually doesn't, and the increased safety factor from having me not be out of my mind scared really makes a difference.  The third factor besides distance and driving idiosyncracies is the fact that I drive a 1995 Jeep Wrangler, which has never been classed in a 'luxury vehicle' category.  So originally we had decided to go on January 23, but we had a huge storm here with a total snow accumulation of four inches (you should have heard the guy in the Tarrytown Hilton when I was cancelling our reservations due to "snowstorm").  Seriously this was a bad storm here and work (at the time was the nursing home-Anne still works there) would not let us leave town.  Yes, they can do that when you're in admin.  So we had cancelled and rescheduled for Valentine's day weekend.  We left Thursday night around 7PM.  I always like to drive up at night and back during the day to put me in daylight on the most unfamiliar section of the drive.  I've driven it so many times it's kind of a science, and I know exactly where I ought to be when (ie., if I leave here at 8, I should be at the Chesapeake Bay Bridge Tunnel at 1AM.  This may seem excessively anal, but it's all very carefully planned to keep me out of rush hour traffic on the turnpike and heading into the city.  So merrily we go.  The first problem is that Anne has to pee about every 6.4 miles.  She's a much more leisurely type than I am-I tend to be a bit more torqued on average, and the half-hour stops had me worn to ribbons before we ever hit the NC/VA border.  I am one of those nurses that can go all night without ever stopping for the bathroom (she is one of those nurses that has done that so long it doesn't work anymore) and so by the time we got to the Bridge Tunnel she was grabbing the cell phone and calling local urologists to set me up for emergency dialysis.  We drove pretty steady through the night.  She slept most of the way through Virginia and Maryland, and then we came across the scene of a train wreck with a huge accompanying fire that detoured us through the back woods of Delaware for a while.  It didn't knock us too much off schedule despite everything and we were on the NJ Turnpike by 7.  At this point I had to sleep so we stopped at that Molly Pitcher stop or which ever is the last/first stop on the turnpike, got gas, ate some breakfast, I finally went to the bathroom and I fell asleep for (she says) literally four minutes.  The sun was shining but it was amazingly cold, so we decided to get on with it since we were practically there.  I was born in Inwood, which is way up on the west side (200 st) of Manhattan, and we lived there til I was about 6, at which time we moved "Upstate" to Putnam County.  At the time it was a wilderness-dirt roads, four digit phone numbers, and the nearest stoplight to our house was ten miles away.  It's still pretty rural, but nothing like it was.  I lived there til 1993, after we got married, and moved down here.  Point being, I knew where we were going and so on, so it wasn't exactly like being tourists.  Anyway, we stopped on the Palisades and called work (it was now 9AM) and let everyone know we were okay.  The river was iced up pretty good and I could NOT believe how cold it was.  You really do get thin blood or something when you live in a warm climate.  Then we crossed the Bear Mountain Bridge, and since we couldn't go to the hotel til that afternoon, we drove around to look at everything for a while.  We spent the day just wandering about, stopped at had lunch at the Olympic Diner in Mahopac, and got hard rolls, black and whites, and a couple of Double Temptation cakes at the Homestyle Bakery in Peekskill.  There are no diners in NC.  I'm not sure why. The diner was/is an institution in New York.  You also can't get a hard roll here.  I just two weeks ago found a place that makes black and whites.  It was an ephemeral moment.  So we stayed at the Tarrytown Hilton, which is remarkably well placed right there at the Tappan Zee bridge.  I decided it was a good place to stay because it was so convenient to Metro north and to the bridge and also because it was really cheap.  There is also a very nice diner (see) across the street called the Eldorado, where we ate supper every night.  The following morning we got on the train and headed to the city.  It was unbelievably cold.  Anne is one of those very friendly southern people who likes to tell people she's from NC and has never been here before.  This sort of sent me into fits, but trying to get her to do anything is vaguely like trying to herd cats-it doesn't work.  So I resigned myself to being labeled a tourist for the whole trip.  We were also surprised to find out that this was the weekend of the big anti-Iraq-war peace rally.  We met several demonstrators and did a very nice interview with them on video for our 'documentary'.  Once we got to the city, the plan was to go to Ground Zero via the East Village.  Yes, I know what you're thinking.  Why on earth would we do that?  Because there were places I wanted to go to.  And we were walking, which is really the only way to see the city.  If you aren't familiar with Manhattan, our route covered about 85 blocks, which is by any standard, a very long walk (miles).    We started off down Madison avenue.  At 31 St we found a man laying half on the sidewalk and half on the gutter.  We, good nurses that we are, ran (trundled.  We were dressed like the Michelin Man.) over to him and asked him what was wrong.  He opened his eyes and gave us his name, then said "I'm HIV positive.  I need an ambulance."  (You see how I'm HIPPA conscious, don't you?)  Of course he needed an ambulance. His eyeballs were totally pinpointed.  I don't know how much heroin he did that morning, but quite a lot, and so we hung out and waited til the ambulances showed up, threw our coats over him and so on.  The guy was dressed for a summer day.  It took about 30 minutes for the ambulances to get there.  Lots of people were hanging out of cabs telling us they had called 911 on their cell phones for us.  From there we carried on down to 23 St, watching the riot police come storming in by the busloads to quell the peaceful protest.  There were helicopters overhead and everything-nobody was fooling around.  Once we got there we turned east and headed over to Stuyvesant, and then went downtown past Beth Israel hospital, and over again to Avenue A and Tompkins Square Park.  This isn't the greatest of all neighbourhoods but it was important to me to go there.  This was the first place outside of India that anyone publicly chanted Hare Krishna.  When Srila Prabhupada first came here, this is where he went to hold the first harinam sankirtan.  There is a big elm tree there where he sat, and a plaque commemorating it.  It was kind of an emotional experience for me and I chanted a little bit there.  I wish it hadn't been so cold.  From there, Anne wanted to eat, so we turned onto St. Mark's and I got some lunch from a place called Vegetarian Kitchen and she got a hotdog from a place across the street called Eat Me.  (Only in NYC.)    We warmed up some and then we kept going west on St. Mark's to 2nd Avenue and turned south there.  We walked all the way down to the very end, Houston/Lafayette, that area.  Gosh it's not so good there, or wasn't last year.  We went to the temple there at 26 2nd Avenue.  This was the first temple ever in the United States and where everything  began.  I took some pictures and offered obesiances while Anne went and found a bathroom (again).    Once we left there we headed towards Chinatown.  Over on Grand Street we found a Thai restaurant called Thai Angel and she wanted to have some tea so we stopped and got warm.  We were getting pretty tired at this point.  We had tea and appetizers (very nice fried tofu and taro), and then we set off again west.  We had a good time looking over everything for sale on the street.  I bought a hat because she was wearing mine and it was way too cold to not have a hat.  It's an ugly hat but everyone was wearing one just like it, so I felt okay about being unfashionable.  There was so much stuff for sale and even though it's all just overpriced junk, it's still fun to look.  We walked around there for a while and then finally, headed off down Church St to Ground Zero.  There was (I don't know if it's still there or not) a huge shrine across the street.  People from all over the country and the world had left things, messages, shirts, flags, etc.  It was very poignant to see.  The whole area was quite crowded but very silent, and the atmosphere was very like a church.  The site itself wasn't much-by now most of the mess had been taken care of and all it was, was a huge empty hole.  It was weird to me to see things (like a church not far away) that I recognised from pictures that had been on the internet after everything happened.  On the chainlink surround of the site were several large plaques that had all the victims' names listed (something like at the Vietnam memorial).  There was a man playing 'America the Beautiful' on a flute, which made everything just a little bit eerie.  If I hadn't been so incredibly exhausted by that point I think I could have appreciated it more.  We stayed for a little while and then headed home on the train.  I love Grand Central Station.  We managed to catch an earlier train than we had originally thought and got home at a very decent hour.  The following morning we were going to leave at 8 but you can't do anything on time with Anne, so at 10AM we were out buying bagels and coffee getting ready to leave.  The cellphone rang and it was my husband letting us know that there was a blizzard heading directly towards us and to get the hell out of there.  Naturally this came as a complete surprise to us (I don't watch the news, not even in NY) and so we got in the car and got going.  By the time we got to exit 7 on the turnpike, we were seeing little snow bunnies swirling on the roat.  At exit 5 it was snowing good, and at exit 3 it was just about whiteout.  We were driving so slow I was able to take pictures, and Anne was videotaping.  On the video you can hear on the radio that the whole state of Delaware had just shut down.  We decided after some argument to go on 17.  This was upheld by my husband who said the weather would be worse inland.    For the next 300+ miles we drove 35 miles an hour.  We had to stop several times to get the ice off the windshield wipers, and it was a good thing we had the Jeep because we had to climb snowdrifts to get to gas stations.  Why didn't we stop?  Because we didn't really have any money, and all we had to eat were hard rolls, bagels, black and whites and two Double Temptation cakes.  So we carried on, finding outhouses when necessary, and all the while in the back of my mind was the thought that the bridge tunnel might be closed.  We were practically delirious by the time the snow turned to rain (in southern Virginia).  When we stopped in Virginia Beach at Denny's (after 9PM) we were laughing so hard at stupid things (don't make me tell you about the Thyroid Family) that we about choked on our supper.    We finally got home at 4AM.  My knee was so locked up that I actually fell over when I got out of the car.  I had to walk around for 10-15 minutes before I got back in the car (we were at work).  We left a note saying we had just got in and would not be in that day (Monday.. remember, we left on Thursday).  By the time I got home, got unpacked and unwound enough to get in the bed, it was about 8AM.  The phone rang at 8:30 to let me know the state had showed up and I had to go to work.  I don't know why to this day they made us come in, but you can add it to the list of reasons I don't work there anymore.  We're planning on going back, maybe in May, for a long weekend again, and we've also planned a trip to Charleston (neither of us have ever been there).  But this time we're taking Anne's Explorer.  It doesn't come out as funny in print as it was in life, but the next time we go I'll have audio blog posting so you can share in the joy.  Have a good day.

      I go back to work on Tuesday.  I slept through the night.  For the first time since I've been off work.  Remember I said I wanted to have a garden once we moved?   Well,  urlLink check this out .  I decided to give it a try and see what happens.  I am a tomato nut, so theoretically this thing could pay for itself just in tomatoes.  I ordered three, so that I can plant tomatoes, cucumbers, and corn.  These are the three vegetables we eat most in the summer, and if they perform anything like the pictures they have on the website, we'll have enough not only for us but also to share.  So I'm pretty excited.  It looks simple enough, but everything looks simple when they want you to buy.  If they do work well, I'll probably order another three and then if I install some plant lights I could conceivably grow year round.  Just planting carefully you can grow ten months out of the year here, because you've got cool weather stuff like peas and lettuce that can be planted in September and February.  Collards don't even get good until after the frost-not that I would plant collards.  I don't mind them, but I wouldn't want bushels of them.  But quite a few things grow in cooler weather, like cauliflower and stuff.  And if these things work great, then I won't need a garden, just a greenhouse.  It will be pretty amazing if I can grow corn in a box like that.  We'll see how it goes.  Last year I planted some Anaheim chiles that grew really, really well.  I was very impressed.  It was actually more than I could use.  If I have that 'problem' this year, I'll just have to buy a dehydrator and dry everything.  Most of all I like my fruit trees, but the only ones that have been consistently good are my apples.  I don't think the peach and nectarine are making it through the winter, and the fire ants ate one of my plums.  If I plant more trees, it would probably be figs.  And I've got a grapevine, which will probably start doing something this year, since it's been in a year now.  Scott got three of his new speakers today.  I must admit they do sound better than the old ones, but the old ones were good too.  This is his thing.    Very shortly I am going to be completely decimating my office here.  I need a new (lower) surface for typing/mousing because of my wrist, so Scott is going to build one.  I told him it doesn't matter what it looks like, so he can build it out of scraps or whatever.  I think he said white melamine.  So once that happens, just about everything in this room is going to get tossed out and the whole room redone.  It probably could use painting but I've got so much stuff up on the walls that it almost isn't worth patching until we're ready to move, so I will probably wait on that.  I am not really a very neat person so he will be very happy to have me tear this room out and start over.  He said in the new house I get one room to be messy in.  Maybe it should be a shed in the back yard. :)     urlLink      urlLink ');"> postCount(' ');

        The greatest reputation a living being can have is to be a devotee of Krsna and to act in Krsna consciousness. In the material world everyone is trying to be famous by accumulating a large bank balance or material opulence. There is a steady competition among karmis attempting to advance in a wealthy society. The whole world is turning in accordance with that competitive mood. But this kind of name and fame is temporary, for it lasts only as long as the temporary material body exists. One may become famous as an impersonalist scholar, or one may become a materially opulent person. In either case, such reputations are inferior to the reputation of Krsna's devotee. In the Garuda Purana it is said: "In this Age of Kali, the fame of one who is known as a great devotee is very rare. However, such a position is superior to that of the great demigods like Brahma and Mahadeva. This is the opinion of all spiritual masters."   urlLink      urlLink ');"> postCount(' ');

      I've been knitting since I was six years old.  I don't know how many mittens, hats, scarves, sweaters, socks I've ever made.  I've made them for me, for gifts, for charity.  I don't like to make afghans or blankets, and I can't crochet very well.  But I do like to knit.  So what's this mean, I'm what, nearly thirty years ahead of the trend?  I do take exception with one thing in this article.  Knitting isn't an expensive hobby, or doesn't have to be.  If you want to spend a thousand dollars on some Italian cashmere, that's your business.  You can make a perfectly warm and lovely sweater in wash n wear acrylic for under ten bucks.  You can even make a pair of socks in a fine German wool for under fifteen.  So the whole high-dollar aspect of it is purely the efforts of the knitting industry to make a homely practical craft into something flash and elite.    I'm all for keeping knitting purely proletariat.   Okay.  Time for me to get back to Gurudeva's sweater, which is, by the way, made of a 100% Caron Acrylic in a lovely peachy saffrony colour.  No felting, no pilling, no shrinkage, and extremely warm and comfortable.  Keep your Italian cashmere.  Urban Americans Get Enthused Over Knitting AFP  Feb. 6, 2004 — The December opening of Knit New York, a cafe and boutique rolled into one, shows a revival in knitting as a hobby.  People of all ages, male and female, also young people, are discovering or returning to the favored pastime of their grandmothers.  At Knit Cafe, people are queuing up for courses. Marianne Arroyo taught her 32-year-old daughter Julie there.  "It's the perfect combination between an excellent cappuccino and really interesting classes," she said.  Sarah Dan, who studies at New York University, knits everywhere she goes: class, metro, cinema.  "I did a whole sweater once in a law class," she said.  Dan, who has been knitting for just six months, finds that, although not cheap, it is a gratifying hobby. "It's an expensive hobby, but satisfying and it's a great way to meet people," he said.  Owen Fisher, retired, started to click the needles in 1997 while undergoing cancer treatment. Doctors recommended knitting would keep his discomfort under control while he was receiving chemotherapy.  "I've never stopped knitting since" then, he said. "It frees me from the social barriers. I basically live here, they even ordered my special tea brand."  "Knitting breaks barriers and encourages communication," said Miriam Maltagliati, boss of the knitting venues. She is amazed at the success she has seen with them. "Who could have imagined that, in a city where no one speaks to anyone anymore?"  And she adds: "Yarns are more interesting to knit than they used to be."  "Knitting is the new yoga," said Lily Chin, author of the "Urban Knitter" who works with fashion designers Ralph Lauren and Vera Wang. "People are tired of looking alike," she says. "Knitting can help them express their individuality."  Knitting hobby experts say the stress-reducing activity is gaining in popularity. The percentage of knitters below the age of 45 went from nine to 18 percent between 1996 and 2002.  At New York's Cabrini Medical Center, knitting is recommended to ease pain for people who are suffering under difficult treatment. Sewing, pottery, painting and design all help people who are sick "to feel they are still human" despite the pain, said Helen Carrier, nursing chief there.  Paige West, an anthropologist at the Columbia University, describes people in urban areas as "alienated from the products of their daily work — they never see a material product of their labor."  But knitting helps, she says, allowing the development of a social relationship between objects and people, as well as providing a material byproduct of their efforts.  "People can develop a social relationship with the objects and the people" allowing "some sort of production from which you can see the sensuous item straight away."  It also takes people back to the tradition of their grandmothers, changing the all-too-common scenario from sitting endlessly in front of the computer.   And the trend has not escaped the attention of fashion designers who, from Donna Karan to Giorgio Armani, are promoting it. Some knitters will pay top price for a Malo knitting kit, a brand of Italian kashmir, at $979.  Others of more modest means look out for starter kits at affordable prices. Clothing store Urban Outfitters sells such a kit for $18.   urlLink      urlLink ');"> postCount(' ');

      We're in a tornado watch until 11PM.  I am terrified of tornadoes.  The problem with them is that there's no warning.  At least a hurricane you know is coming.  So I'll be nervous the rest of the evening now.  During Hurricane Fran, we had a tornado very close to our house, about a mile away.  All the trees were snapped off in a path about 40 feet wide.  I guess it wasn't a very big tornado, but to me, it was pretty darn scary just looking at what was left.  Don't get me wrong.  Hurricanes are pretty scary too, and you can get a tornado to spin off of one in a heartbeat.  18 hours of 120+mph winds can be pretty nervewracking.  But most people leave, and the ones who don't, know what they're in for.  Me, I can never leave, because I have to be at work.   Just how it is.  We've been through about six direct hits here since 1993 when we moved in.  At this point, we don't get nervous until the winds are sustained over 125.  And we have a standing agreement that if the storm will be category 4 or higher at landfall, he takes the dog and goes.  You have to be realistic about this kind of thing.  My parents live out on one of the islands, and they're pretty much hardasses, and won't leave.  Now they can stay legally, because they're in the Coast Guard Auxiliary and run a radio hub out of their house and stuff.  I never thought my mom'd get into that, but she has, and now she's become a daggone good navigator.  On sea, that is.  Don't ask her to take you to Walmart.  So they go out and run patrols and do all kinds of things, tow boats and everything else.  They have a 34' Marine Trader called the Christine Ann II, and my father's got an eye on a couple of bigger boats (one was 85', as if they really needed all that boat).  Anyway, they don't leave during hurricanes anymore.  I've stopped worrying about them except incidentally.  Hell, they have more training in this stuff than I do.  There's been another rather large change.  The  Wilmington Vedic Discussion Group  is now the   urlLink Coastal Center for Bhakti-yoga  .  Call it a PR campaign but I think the new name more clearly says what I'm about and will generate some more interest than the other name.  I will have new cards made and so on.  Pretty soon I'll be able to set up a solid schedule for going out and preaching.  It's 55 degrees out and has been raining off and on all day.  Despite the tornado warning, I'm thinking about going out for a japa walk.  I feel pretty good today and I'd like to do a bit of exercise.  We live in a neighbourhood that allows me to feel safe even at 3 or 4 in the morning, so I sometimes like to go out walking and chanting.  Scott's got some kind of loud Gladiatoresque movie going on and really, that's not all that conducive to japa, so it's better if I go out for a while.  My hand's been unusually painful today, so I don't know how much knitting I can get done this evening.  I'm hearing some conflicting reports about actually when Gurudeva will be here, but I'm hoping to get something concrete relatively soon.   urlLink      urlLink ');"> postCount(' ');

      I went to bed last night at nine and got up at one this morning.  So, situation normal there.  Scott said that once we get into our new house and get settled et al, that I am never working nights again.  I think he vacillates between awe at how I function on so little sleep so chronically, and worry that I'm either going to just keel over or fall asleep behind the wheel or something.  Really I can go for weeks and months on like two, three hours sleep a day.  The problem is that I'm not using all that extra time productively.  I have, however, been knitting as much as my hand will allow.  It's best for like half hour or so, then a break.  I am feeling the pressure to get it done-I have the whole back and front to do, so I feel like every minute I have to be working on it.  I decided to withdraw from school because I'm just not doing it.  I'm way behind and I am not in the mindset to do it.  I refuse to feel guilty about it-it's just not something my heart is in.  All the priorities are in a different place right now.  Plus, with all this education they are putting us through at work, how much available space do I actually have in my brain?  I am definitely going up to the temple this weekend.  I was going to go for a few days, remember, but I just don't think it's a good idea with all this medication I'm still taking and all the precautions I have to take with keeping my hand clean and stuff (not that it's dirty up there, because it isn't).  Just that doing everything I need to do is easier done from here.  For the longest time I was looking for an Indian tiffin container.  This is like a series of three metal containers, small round containers, that all stack and fit into a carrier.  Like a lunchbox.  But it has seperate containers for different things.  Well, I couldn't find one, not even on Ebay, which has God knows everything.  But I found something better that's made by Thermos Nissan.  Is this the same Nissan that makes cars? Who knows.  Anyway, they are making like steel Thermos bottles and so on and they have this one that has four round containers that fit into a steel thermos and it's supposed to keep things hot for 12 hours or cold for 24.  So this will be nice for bringing home prasadam from the temple for Scott, or when I go up and spend time there.  Tonight I was watching some DVDs of Srila Prabhupada.  My conception of him is fuzzy, only from books and lectures and photographs, but to see him moving and interacting with people and speaking, is really amazing.  He was so confident always without being arrogant, just very convinced of the reality of his words.  He seemed to be very strong yet very delicate at the same time-sometimes the camera man would focus on his hands and you can see there, like when he played the karatals, that his touch was both strong yet very precise and delicate.  It was fun to see him with the children.  Some people believe that only Srila Prabuhpada should be the guru.  This idea, caled rtvik theory, has been a major source of controversy within our community.  I don't usually talk about things like this here, but I can say pretty openly that I don't buy into it.  It doesn't make sense to me.  How can a society grow and continue to grow if the succession is broken?  The disciplic succession has been going on for thousands and thousands of years.  We see that Srila Prabhupada's guru was Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Saraswati Thakur, and so on back down the line.  This is the disciplic succession.  My guru, HH Indradyumna Swami, is a disciple of Srila Prabuhpada.  It just continues in this way.  Of course Srila Prabhupada is very special, because he brought Krsna Consciousness to the west and founded our Society.  He is like a grandfather to us, grand-guru, and we are grand-disciples.  Of course he holds a special place.  But that doesn't mean that everything should stop there.  Of course it has to continue on.  I think that people need to be very aware though, and use a lot of discretion and serious thought and prayer when seeking for the guru.  It's very easy to be cheated and misled, so we have to approach this very carefully.  All the scriptures say that we should examine the guru very carefully before accepting him (or her) and that the guru should do the same for the disciple.  In this way we can be sure that we are getting the bonafide real deal.  Prayer is a very big part of it, because when Krsna sees that we are serious about spiritual life, He sends the guru to us.  Actually, the guru is a manifestation of Krsna Himself.  When you are serious about learning about spiritual life and ready to commit to it, Krsna Himself comes to you in the form of the guru to guide you back home.  So you need to pray very sincerely about it.  Some people go for years or a whole lifetime without ever finding their guru.  I didn't have this experience-the first time I got to the temple, my spiritual master was there waiting.  So everyone's experience is very different.  I think I am more the exception than the rule, because most people take several years with it at the least.  I think that westerners in general have a problem with authority, accepting authority.  We don't like to do it.  Everyone wants to be the boss.  Unfortunately, that mentality only leads to more problems.  The only way to learn anything is to first of all admit you don't know, and then to listen and do what your teacher says.  This goes with anything, not just spiritual life.  Like when I was in nursing school, you had to watch someone do a procedure.  Then when you tried to do it, you were watched, and corrected if necessary.  You couldn't just go in and say, 'oh, I know how to do that', when you didn't.  Even now if there is a procedure I don't know how to do, I call someone or find someone to show me how.  If I was too proud or arrogant to do that, I could potentially hurt someone through my ignorance.  So spiritual life is the same way.  First you have to admit you don't know.  Then you have to find someone who does know, and that's the guru.  Then you say to the guru, okay, I don't know, so please teach me, and I will listen and do what you tell me to do.  That's what it's all about.  The problem for many people comes when guru says, don't do this, don't do that.  Like guru might say, OK, if you are serious about spiritual life, no intoxication.  People think, oh no! I have to give up drinking? and they don't want to do it.  Or illicit sex.  People don't want to give it up.  Then they turn around and say, oh, this must be a cult, it's very restrictive, trying to tell me what to do with my personal life.  But they're not realising, they wanted to learn about spiritual life, well, this is how it gets done.  You can't just have your cake and eat it too.  And most people don't even realise how things they do are actually detrimental to them.  Or they do realise but they just don't care because they want to 'enjoy' in the moment.  Intelligent people, though, will stop and understand, and obey what the guru says, and later on when they get a little bit more realisation and understanding, they can say, yes, I can understand now that this is something for my own good, although it seems like an austerity, really it makes my life easier and better.  So all these things we do, like giving up meat, fish, eggs, intoxication, illicit sex, all of this at first seems like a terrible trial and austerity.  But later on we can realise that it makes life so much easier, and we are better for it.  And if we know something about other religions or the history of religion, we can also understand that these things are not unusual.  In fact, most serious religious practice will enjoin these same things to one degree or another.  It's just that most people aren't really serious about following religious practice.  Well, I'm not sure how understandable that all was, so if you have any questions, just ask.  In a few weeks I am going to give a talk at the college in a class on religion that a friend of mine is taking.  I'm really looking forward to it.  It's something I've never done before so I am really relishing the opportunity.  Thank goodness I am used to speaking in front of people so I won't be nervous.  I just need to find out if I can have the whole hour or not :)  Have a good day, and chant Hare Krishna to be happy.     urlLink      urlLink ');"> postCount(' ');

      I've been whining for days now about how I haven't been sleeping.  Well it happened again last night, and out of sheer desperation I decided to take some medicine that the doctor had given me to help me with sleeping.  It worked for about three hours, and then I was back up again, knitting away on Gurudeva's sweater (I have the pattern worked out.  Now it's just a matter of pacing it so my hand can handle it.)  So finally I went back to bed around four, and of course my husband left for work at seven.    Well, the medication must have been time release!  I could not get my eyes open for more than ten seconds the whole rest of the day!  I have just now FORCED myself to get out of the bed, and believe me, I could go get back in it and sleep.  I can't stand it!  I go days and days without sleeping and then finally when I take something to help me sleep, it doesn't work until morning.   It's like a big joke, on me.  Anyway.  Here are some directions for anyone who might need them:  How To Leave A Comment  1. Click on the pink link that says 'Be part of the revolution here' 2.

      Click on  urlLink this link here  and look at how beautiful.  They make me want to dance. Nitai Gauranga ki jai!  I made black bean soup for lunch.  It didn't come out as thick as I wanted it to, but it's still goooooooood.  For seasoning, use olive oil, ginger paste, cumin, a little garam masala, hing, cayenne, and a few dried jalapeno bits.  Fry up for a minute or two, add beans, chop 3 plum tomatoes fine, add to the pot, add 3-5 cups water depending on how thick you want it.  Simmer for about an hour or so, then puree.  If you have mango powder, add about a tablespoon.  Otherwise, about two tablespoons or so of lemon juice.  A little coriander would also be appropriate, and salt/pepper to taste.  It'll warm your bones.  As my mother would say, "It's good for you."  Are you wondering about all those little coloured boxes there?  Well, it's actually a weather forecast.  You'll just have to click on it to find out how to read one and whether you can get one for your area.  I thought it was pretty nifty.  But then again, I'm pretty easily amused.   urlLink      urlLink ');"> postCount(' ');

      I didn't sleep again last night.  Today I'm kind of dazed (when was the last time I slept more than two hours?).  I went to the staff meeting at the hospital.  It's definitely not a good idea to drive anywhere near me.  Shifting is a bit dicey with this hand.  I thought they were going to call me in some more Percocet, but I ended up with Vicodin.   As I've said before, I don't generally like television with only a few exceptions.  Anything about dinosaurs or geology is good, and old Batman episodes, and some cartoons.  Beyond that, I haven't got much use for it.  These days, I think the best part of television are the commercials.  Here are some that stand out in my mind:   Current Commercials:   1.   The Wingman commercial .  I wrote a post on this once before, so I won't go into the whole sociological dilemma of it.  The music stays in my head, though.  2.   The Enzyte commercials .  I've written about these before too.  They're just too cutesy to not like.  3.   The Levitra commercials .  These I can do without.  Who really wants to know about Mike Ditka's sex life?  What I'd like to know is how much these celebrities are paid to get on television and say they can't perform without pharmacological intervention.  *Although I must admit it was absolutely fantastic that Mike D. said in that one commercial that baseball as a sport could use some Levitra.  Ain't it the truth!  I hate baseball.  That I'll keep for another post.  4.  T he Office Depot (or is it Office Max?) commercial  with that supply guy who dances around with his little buggy.  I want to work with this guy.  Unfortunately, in most places, any employee that happy would be earmarked for drug testing.  5.   The Fedex commercials .  They have a couple of good commercials going right now.  The one with the guy who's the MBA is good but this new one with 'Drama' is better.  6.  The whole 'TRUE' series from Budweiser :  All of these commercials are good.  My current favourite is the one with the referees spotting the ball and talking about drama on the football field.  There was a commercial way back in this series about a southern guy in a NYC bar, and I think that may have been the first one to catch my eye, because they all said 'How ya doin" and I never really realised til then how New Yorkers say that.   Great Past Commercial Campaigns   1.  The 9/11 Budweiser Clydesdale Commercial   Arguably the best commercial of all time and one that made me cry every time I saw it.  It was sentimental without being soppy and still managed to keep its dignity.  2.  Snickers    Snickers had a run of really great commercials last year or the year before.  There was one where the guy painted the football field with the wrong name (Chefs instead of Chiefs) and one where the quarterback got hit in the head too many times and thought he was Batman... there was a whole group of these that were really funny.  They haven't been as good since then.  Although the recent one with Michael Strahan is kind of cute.  3.  Volkswagen   I think Volkswagen has consistently made the best commercials over the past 10 or 15 years.  Whoever their ad people are, they should never get rid of them.  I can think of several great ones right off the top of my head: the one with the two guys who pick up the smelly chair, the one with the guy singing Mr. Roboto in the parking lot, the one with the music and everything is synchronised to the music (I never could figure out how they filmed that one) and the whole series of new Beetle commercials with the flower power theme.  Volkswagen just makes consistently good commercials.  That's all I have on my mind right now.  Today's agenda includes knitting, laundry, getting in a nap (since I didn't sleep last night) and I'd like to make some black bean soup.  It's sunny out but cold, so I think it would be good.   urlLink      urlLink ');"> postCount(' ');

      Just received the following letter (the FOURTH letter from Gurudeva today-this is definitely a record!).  All I can say is: I always talk about how tough and strict my spiritual master is, but this is absolutely unlimited mercy.  I am totally in awe.  Really.  Like the rollercoaster of events is almost a little too much to understand.  Was it a test from Krsna of sincerity?  Or just burning off a little negative karma with all those tears?  Or what?  I do know this.  Today I learned something about myself.  I don't think I ever really realised how intense or real these emotions are.  If someone had told me I would have busted out crying like a baby hearing he wasn't going to be here this year, I don't think I would have believed it.  But it happened, and it was totally real, totally spontaneous and excruciatingly sincere.  It sort of shocked me a little bit, in a way.  I really wasn't expecting my reaction to be so full-on.  The first time I actually met my spiritual master face to face to speak with him (as opposed to just listening to a class or whatever), it was in Chapel Hill at the Festival of India.  He had just arrived, and I came over, offered obesiances, and he let me put a garland on him.  Then for no apparent reason I just busted out in tears.  I was with my friend Mahamantra and all she could say to comfort me was that it was very appropriate to be a fool in front of the spiritual master.  And certainly I was a fool, and felt very stupid about the whole thing.  Later on that evening, Srila Gurudeva was telling stories (he is a great storyteller.  My favourite story is the one about Kesava the elephant.)  and he was talking about some devotees who were crying upon just having met Srila Prabhupada.  And what he said was that he was envious of these devotees, who already had so much devotion that they were able to cry.  He said, "here they are, and I was just a stone with no feelings."  So that made me feel a little better, after hearing that.  People have asked me how do you develop a relationship with your guruji when he is so far away and you only see him once a year?  It seems to them that it can hardly be possible to actually have a relationship worth anything.  But I don't think it depends on things like time and space.  The guru-disciple relationship is eternal.  It goes from life to life, and I think, once you find it, if you've made the right decision, that mundane physical conceptions like time and location really don't matter much.  Don't get me wrong.  The few days he is here each year are positively ecstatic, and I look forward to it for months and spend the rest of the year in varying levels of seperation.  But the fact that it's just a few days hasn't prevented the relationship from developing.  A guru is like a father, guiding and teaching the disciple (and correcting if necessary) on the path of spiritual knowledge.  There are lots of ways to associate with Sri Guru-by reading his instructions in the form of his books, or listening to classes or tapes, or more personally by writing and receiving letters, and visiting personally when that option is available.  Today really showed me how intense the relationship really becomes, more so than I had even realised it does.  The whole thing is just unbelievable.  Anyway, JAI SRILA GURUDEVA!  He will be here this year after all.    Dear Satyavati,  Please accept my blessings. All glories to Srila Prabhupada.  I have contacted ******** and we will work something out;  perhaps shifting dates with ********.  So be peaceful, it will be alright.

      I got another letter from Gurudeva.  He finally heard back from the people he was supposed to stay with, and the original time he was going to be here isn't good anyway.  So he hasn't made a decision yet, but he said he's going to think about it and in a couple of days make a decision.  He said for me to not be in anxiety.  I guess it was pretty obvious in my letter how devastated I was.  So I am afraid to hope or anything, but maybe something will happen, and he will be able to switch some things around, and come to NC after all.  I'm praying for it.  Otherwise, I'm getting in the car with my tent and my sleeping bag, and going to West Virginia to New Vrndavan.  He will be there for three days.  I apologise for being so ugly in my last post.

      Srila Gurudeva isn't coming to NC this year. This is because he didn't get a reply from the people he was supposed to stay with, after repeated tries, phone calls, emails, and so forth.  I even made some phone calls and let them know he was trying to reach them, so I KNOW they knew. I can't write about it any more because I am too upset and I will say something ugly.   All I know is that I already asked him if he would stay with us once we built our house up there, and I said it must somehow be Krishna's arrangement, and a great blessing for the devotees in Dallas (that is where he will be at the time he should be here), but that it feels like a terrible punishment to me.

      Barring any problems I should be back to work a week from tonight.   I have an appointment for Employee Health next Tuesday, the 10th, at 0700.   I don't think there will be any difficulty.  It makes more sense to me to wait until the stitches are pulled-I don't think it's reasonable to expect that I can be on the floor and keep my hand 'clean and dry'.  Nothing I do in the course of duty is either clean or dry.  It's raining today and I have a bunch of stuff to do around here.  I am supposed to get some pictures developed, but criminy, I can't find the film.  Also on the list is laundry and an oil change.  It won't all get done today.  Scott has to wash my hair for me, because I can't do it with just one hand.   urlLink ');"> postCount(' ');

      Once again I am up in the middle of the night.  This is getting kind of old.  I am NOT sleeping through the day today!  I have a lot to do.  I have to go get some pictures developed, do laundry, and make phonecalls.  I don't think I will go up to the temple for an overnight, but I may go up on Sunday just for the feast.  I so miss being away from there.  I am going to have some days off for Gaura Purnima (I think! I have just totally changed my schedule around) so it won't be too long to wait-just a couple of weeks-and then a couple of weeks after that, Gurudeva will be here!  I am almost out of Percocet, and this hand is still pretty painful.   urlLink ');"> postCount(' ');

      So I got the big bandage off my hand today.  I got to look at it.  It looks pretty Frankenstein.  My whole palm is bruised and there's about 15 stitches in it.  As a nurse I have to say the incision is clean without drainage and no signs or symptoms of infection.  As a patient, it looks pretty gross.  And it hurts.  I told that to the doctor and he said, "Well, you just had surgery!"  (Sometimes he irritates me.)  The stitches come out in a week, but for now I just have a bandaid and some Coban on it.  I decided to cut the fingers off a cheap (50 cent) glove and put that over it because the bandaid was bubbling and peeling.  So the glove holds everything together.  It looks kind of stupid, but what can I say.  At the very least, I can type again with all my fingers (I type 70 wpm) and he says I can drive too.  So I will be at the staff meeting on Wednesday.  I could go back to work if there was a way to keep my hand dry and clean, but I'm a floor nurse-I don't think there's any way to do that.  So it looks like I'm out of work until the 10th.  Tomorrow I'm going to call Employee Health and talk to them.  I have a feeling they won't let me work with a four day old incision and 15 stitches in my dominant hand.  I'm hoping it starts to feel better pretty soon, or I'll be calling for more Percocet.  Even though it makes me itch!  Tomorrow I also have to call my friend the doctor.  She called me and left a message on my cell phone.  She's so sweet.  Maybe we can go to Hillsborough this weekend.  I don't anticipate spending a whole lot of time up there like I had originally planned, but on the other hand, if I can get back to work on the 10th, I will save myself like 40 hours of PDO that I was originally going to burn.  This is good because it means I'll have that PDO time for April.  So the whole Janet Jackson thing, hm?  Was that really necessary?  Does anyone REALLY need to see her boob?  Why can't she just be satisfied with being pretty and talented?  Does she really NEED the shock value of showing off the boob?  Sometimes I think people just do things for no real apparent reason.  Now that I have this bandage off I think I can actually knit.  If I am careful I should be able to manage it just fine.  This is important because I have a LOT to do on Gurudeva's sweater before he gets here.  If only I could knit as fast as I type.  If only the sweater pattern didn't have mistakes in it.  What a wonderful world it would be.  Been rereading one of my favourite books, "The Art of Chanting Hare Krishna" by HH Mahanidhi Swami Maharaj.  This is really a good book.  You can click  urlLink here  to read a review I wrote of it.  This is the kind of book that's good for an everyday devotional.  Definitely worth the money if you have the opportunity to get it.  I've also started on a new book called "Leadership for an Age of Higher Consciousness".  This book is written by my friend Narayani's spiritual master, HH Bhakti Tirtha Swami Maharaj.  I figure I can use all the help I can get.  When I'm finished with it, there's a second volume, but I will have a review posted on my  urlLink regular site  for people to read.  I like writing book reviews.  I think I actually do quite a good job of it, probably because I really do enjoy it.  The weather's been very nice lately.  Maybe this means spring is almost here.  I'm thinking of planting some tomatoes again this year.  We'll see how things go.  When we move to the new house, I'm going to have a REAL garden.  Today was Scott's birthday.  I didn't get him anything, but he just got that Rotel receiver, and so that's qualifying as his Birthday present this year.   urlLink ');"> postCount(' ');

      So Carolina lost the big game.  At least they made a game of it.  Tilak: I normally wear gopi chandan tilak. I have seen some people who have very white/gray tilak (instead of the yellow that the gopi chandan is).  If you know where I can get some white tilak, PLEASE let me know.  Percocet makes me itch.  Unfortunately it isn't handling the pain so well anymore.  I doubt he will give me any more when I go see him today, but this hand is hurting a lot more than I expected it to.  And he knows I have a good pain tolerance!  I sort of think I dislodged a stitch with all I've been doing with this hand.  Today I go get this big bandage off FINALLY.  I am going to ask for a brace for it mostly for protection whilst driving.  Then I'm going to learn to drive with it!  I am hoping to get out of town for a couple days while it's healing up.  My husband does not breathe while he sleeps.  Medical people, what he does I swear is Cheyne Stokes.  Nonmedical people, this is how people breathe when they are trying to die.  It makes me crazy.  He needs a sleep study.  I swear he goes into arrest 20 times a night.  I have to nudge him to get him to start breathing again.  Then he gets mad at me for nudging.  Obviously my sleep patterns are still reflecting work.  I sort of sleep at random these days.   Sometimes feels like all I do is sleep and itch.  I hate Percocet.  Permission has been granted to build a temple in Moscow.   My spiritual master is on the board of directors.  I am hoping to have a seperate donation for the building fund when he gets here.  This surgery has screwed up the finances a little bit.  Not as bad as it could have! Hospital insurance is good.     urlLink ');"> postCount(' ');

      Back in 1985 I went with my highschool senior class to this place called St Gabriel's.  It was a monastery/retreat center out on Shelter Island (in NY).  It was a beautiful place-not in physical beauty although it had that... it was a very peaceful place.  We stayed the weekend in these tiny rooms that just had a bed, a desk, and a sink, and we all ate together in a big room.  In retrospect it was a lot like how it is up at the temple, a monastic lifestyle.  I remember being very taken in by it, and that it made a very big impression on me, that simple God centered lifestyle.  Now, 19 years later, I am closer to that goal and lifestyle than I ever was within the Catholic church.  I did a websearch to look for St. Gabriel's, and found out an arsonist burned it down in 1999.  It made me very sad.  It was a very special place.  Whoever was responsible for that will surely have to pay.  Today is post-op 3, and the percocet isn't working as well as it was.  I'm still hurting a lot.  Tonight is the Superbowl.  We're going for Carolina although neither of us are real Panthers fans-it just seems like we ought to, for loyalty's sake.  Left messages with those devotees.  I am really getting excited about Gurudeva's visit.   urlLink ');"> postCount(' ');

      I got reviewed by The Weblog Review and received a 4.0.  I'm pretty flattered.  Crunchtime is on.  I have 10" to go on the sweater (it goes slow, doesn't it?) and I am waiting til the last possible second to get the Vyasapuja book printed up in case someone sends me a last minute offering.  I still have only the vaguest idea of what I'll be doing next week, once I'm off work-I still haven't decided what day I'm going up or what day I'm going to the house where I'll be staying or where I'll be staying before I get there.  I'm just basically winging it, which is always a bit unnerving.  I thought I had more to talk about, but really there's not much going on.  I'm sleeping at random again, which I hate.  This has to be the worst part about working at night.  Everything else is good.  If I could just get the whole sleep thing down, I'd be fine.  We've decided we're putting the house on the market first of the year, which means there's a lot of work to do between now and then.  So I imagine you'll be hearing a lot about home improvement, landscaping, and other DIY projects as the months wear on.  We still haven't totally decided where we want to go, although Hillsborough is the natural choice.  Montana still has a certain appeal.  I'd be digging dinosaurs out of our backyard.  We talked about at least seven different states yesterday, but we keep coming back to NC, so the odds are stacked that we'll be staying here.  It's allergy time again.  All the pine trees are spawning or whatever you call it with trees, and everything's all over yellow.  I never had seasonal allergies until we moved here, but they've gotten worse every year since.  Many people seem to have that difficulty with this area.  Also, the mold/mildew problem is unbelievable.  At my old job, they're currently in the process of ripping out my office, and trust me, I know exactly how much mold and mildew is under the wallpaper in there.  I haven't had a significant sinus infection since I left that job, and I am pretty convinced that it's all connected.  This part of NC is basically a swamp, and so the consistent high moisture amounts create ideal conditions for mold and mildew.  This is a very strong argument against wallpaper.  I don't think this is a silly or petty issue, either.  It may sound melodramatic, but there's only paper-thin bone between your sinuses and your brain, and every nurse knows someone who's had a sinus infection or tooth abscess that they just refused to have looked at, and bam! next thing you know they've got irreversible brain damage.  So if you're spending eight or twelve weeks of the year (like I was) on antibiotics for sinuses, take a look around your home and office, and see if you can find the cause.   urlLink      urlLink ');"> postCount(' ');

      So there I was, just got home from work, having a bowl of rice and peas, and flipping around the channels.  As you know, I don't watch much tv.  The thought of Scooby Doo was sort of inviting, and so I headed to Boomerang, only to be disappointed by the sudden appearance of Scrappy Doo, which was the worst thing ever to happy to Shag and Scoob.  I mean, who thought of that obnoxious little rat?  Anyway, I started flipping through, and I came across PBS and an entirely bizarre psychedelic type show with five little fat Kewpie dolls in cowl neck sweaters that bounced around (rather in a cute kind of way, but very surreal).  I couldn't come up with any kind of plot or educational value whatsoever, but after about the first five minutes I was positively mesmerised.  It was kind of scary.  Kind of makes you realise why they call it 'programming', you know?  Anyway, all this show needed was a good bit of illegal substances to go with it.  I could not for the life of me figure it out.  Finally I discovered that this weirdness is named "Boohbah" (I thought at first it was some kind of weird Japanese word) and that it's some kind of distant cousin to the original TV surrealists, the Teletubbies.  Here's the official word from the official website:  ABOUT BOOHBAH   Boohbah is an exciting new programme for children, with a format that fosters both creative thinking and creative movement. Boohbah is entirely designed to encourage physical action on the part of its young viewers. It deliberately combines infectious magical movement, for children to imitate, with inset stories for them to predict outcomes.   The design of the show - visually and otherwise, draws upon early concepts in science, maths and art and combines these with ‘televisual magic’ to create a uniquely funny television experience.   The Boohbahs, five magical atoms of power, light and fun travel in their Boohball around the world, from child to child. Fifteen countries are visited throughout the changing title sequence.   The Boohbahs represent the imaginative power and light which allows children to control the screen action by the use of the magic word “Boohbah”, and send presents into an imaginary Storyworld for the Storypeople - Grandmamma, Grandpappa, Mrs Lady, Mr Man, Brother and Sister, Auntie and Little Dog Fido to play with and make a story in partnership with them. We hear the children intervening in the screen action by the sound of their blowing and their use of the word “Boohbah”. This motivates the action and moves the story along. Only Little Dog Fido is not wholly in their control! Children are totally engaged and have a lot of fun guessing which Storyperson will appear and what will happen next.   I don't think you ought to let your kid watch this stuff.  There's just something not right about it.  You watch it yourself and see.  It's just a little too bizarre and not relatable to anything in actual experience.  I don't know what kind of child psychiatrist consults for them, but as far as I'm concerned, this show is purely an excuse for an addict to get high.  I mean I know this sounds a bit harsh, after all, it's just a children's show.  You watch it and see how your eyes glaze over.  Do you really want your kid hopping around squeaking nonsense words?  Sit down and read them a book, for Christmas sake.  End of rant.   urlLink      urlLink ');"> postCount(' ');

      I don't usually talk about politics in the blog.  For the record, I've been a socialist since 1987, first afflilated with the Young People's Socialist League and then later with the Socialist Party of the USA, and finally a charter member of the North Carolina Socialist Party.  I am not active in politics anymore because I have too much other stuff to do, but my dreams of socialised medicine and the disintegration of America's aristocracy are still just as technicolour as they always were.

      Got this in the mail today... good thing I knew what it meant..    Hola, satyavatidd, tu amigo  te invita a inscribirte a Yahoo!  Messenger.   Also, my friend Greg, who's listed in the 'At Your Own Risk' section over there (and I mean that), had a link to this thing at the Bud Light website where you can do weird things with a picture of yourself.  Naturally, this is the sort of thing that instantly appeals to my tiny little mind, so I spent way too much time playing with it and  urlLink offer you the humble results here.   Mind you.. the technology is cool, but the actual result comes out a little scary (I thought) and the female voice sounded just like Peach from Finding Nemo, so I opted for a man's voice with a Scottish accent.  It just adds to the overall sense of being a stray cartoon from a lost Monty Python episode.  Anyway, get a laugh out of it.  Once again, it's 70+, so I'm going to sit outside a while and chant.

      Here is my favourite verse and purport from the  Bhagavad gita .  The emphases are, of course, my own. As always, if you'd like to read the entire 700 verses of the Gita, you can do so  urlLink here.  If you'd like a hard copy for yourself, you can simply  urlLink email me  and I'll be glad to send you one.    Chapter 2, Verse 72    That is the way of the spiritual and godly life, after attaining which a man is not bewildered. Being so situated, even at the hour of death, one can enter into the kingdom of God.   PURPORT   One can attain Krsna consciousness or divine life at once, within a second--or one may not attain such a state of life even after millions of births. It is only a matter of understanding and accepting the fact. Khatvanga Maharaja attained this state of life just a few minutes before his death, by surrendering unto Krsna. Nirvana means ending the process of materialistic life. According to Buddhist philosophy, there is only void after the completion of this material life, but Bhagavad-gita teaches differently. Actual life begins after the completion of this material life. For the gross materialist it is sufficient to know that one has to end this materialistic way of life, but for persons who are spiritually advanced, there is another life after this materialistic life. Before ending this life, if one fortunately becomes Krsna conscious, he at once attains the stage of brahma-nirvana.  There is no difference between the kingdom of God and the devotional service of the Lord. Since both of them are on the absolute plane, to be engaged in the transcendental loving service of the Lord is to have attained the spiritual kingdom.  In the material world there are activities of sense gratification, whereas in the spiritual world there are activities of Krsna consciousness. Attainment of Krsna consciousness even during this life is immediate attainment of Brahman, and one who is situated in Krsna consciousness has certainly already entered into the kingdom of God.  Brahman is just the opposite of matter. Therefore brahmi sthitih means "not on the platform of material activities." Devotional service of the Lord is accepted in the Bhagavad-gita as the liberated stage. Therefore, brahmi sthitih is liberation from material bondage.  Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakura has summarized this Second Chapter of the Bhagavad-gita as being the contents for the whole text. In the Bhagavad-gita, the subject matters are karma-yoga, jnana-yoga, and bhakti-yoga. In the Second Chapter karma-yoga and jnana-yoga have been clearly discussed, and a glimpse of bhakti-yoga has also been given, as the contents for the complete text.   Thus end the Bhaktivedanta Purports to the Second Chapter of the Srimad Bhagavad-gita in the matter of its Contents.    urlLink      urlLink ');"> postCount(' ');

      I just got home from work.  It wasn't so bad, but I spent some time working on the schedule, which always brings out my self-sacrificial mode.  I think anyone who cares about anyone or anything has this in them, but because of what I do, it's kind of a job requirement for me.  What this means is that I have to pay careful attention to the balance between taking care of me, and taking care of the world.  It's very easy to let the world convince me that it needs me more than I need it, and to overextend myself to ridiculous lengths so that the world can take a break.  This is kind of a universal truth, I think-a lesson that everyone needs to consider.  How well are you taking care of you?  It's impossible to invest your energy efficiently into taking care of others if you continually neglect yourself.  So even if you have to force yourself to do it.. you need to take care of you.  Sometimes I find it helpful to make a list of my priorities, and a list of my emotional and time obligations to other people.  Matching up these lists helps me understand where I'm overspending and not spending enough, if this makes sense.  I have found that for my own well-being (and for the wellbeing of those around me.. I can be a right bitch when I'm overextended), I need to be able to say no.  To extra hours, overwork, other people's issues when they become overwhelming.  To whatever, when it accumulates to the point that I cannot take care of myself.  I used to feel guilty about this and sometimes I still do, but in the end, I can take better care of those around me if I take the time to take care of me.  So chant Hare Krishna, and be happy.   urlLink      urlLink ');"> postCount(' ');

      We had one of those horrifically awful nights that once you get through it, you actually kind of enjoy (in a masochistic way, of course) the fact that you've gotten through it.  It was a combination of being short-staffed, getting 6 admissions in an hour, and having some really intense patients.  I saved someone's life last night rather dramatically.  They were choking and had quit breathing, and through some good reflexes and adrenalin, I managed to intervene and get the patient breathing again in under a minute.  We didn't even need to call a code.  This is not nearly as glamourous as it is on television and quite frankly I can do without all the excitement.  It was quite a night.  I had to give some medications I'd never given before (in an emergent situation) and was rather uncomfortable with that, but that old trench mentality kicks in and you just do what you have to do.  The patient was transferred successfully to intensive care.  Trust me, it looks better on television.  I read the following today and would like someone to please explain to me the logic behind it: From an underreported profile of Mel Gibson in The New Yorker (Sept. 15, 2003), discussing his then-upcoming film, "The Passion of the Christ": "There is no salvation for those outside the Church. Put it this way. My wife is a saint. She's a much better person than I am. (But) she's Episcopalian. (S)he believes in God, she knows Jesus. (A)nd it's just not fair if she doesn't make it (to heaven); she's better than I am. But that is a pronouncement from the chair (that she will not be saved). I go with it." [The New Yorker, 9-15-03]   I'm sorry.. am I missing something here?  Someone explain how that thought process actually works.  Thanks, and have a good day.   urlLink      urlLink ');"> postCount(' ');

      It's cold out there this morning.  The sun is shining and I'm sure it'll be warm later, but right now, getting into bed and pulling the covers over my head sounds absolutely delicious.  I'm more tired than I expected I would be, so I'm hoping I sleep straight through till four.    Last night went well.  Tonight I expect it will be more difficult.  If nothing else, the staff will be more difficult.  But I'll worry about it later.  Right now, it's time for bed.   urlLink      urlLink ');"> postCount(' ');

      12.5" of Gurudeva's sweater are complete.  Tonight we watched this show about this guy named Austin Stevens who went to India looking for a king cobra.  He found one.  Then he went to Peru to sail up the Amazon in a canoe looking for a giant anaconda, which he also found.  People are nuts.  I don't watch much television.  Generally, I only watch the Discovery channels and NFL network and Boomerang.  Most of what I watch is documentary and educational stuff-like today, I watched a show about the seven architectural wonders of ancient Rome, which was really good.  I especially like stuff about ancient history, archaeology, and geology, which are actually topics of programs more often than you might believe.   Tonight we also watched Iron Chef, which I really like but rarely watch.  It's just so Japanese, and so dramatically overblown, that it becomes a real entertainment.  Tonight's key ingredient was asparagus, and those two chefs did things with asparagus that ought to be illegal (including making an asparagus-flavoured snowcone, which turned out to be a big hit).  One of the chefs used 30 (thirty, yes) lobsters to steam six white asparagus spears.  The commentator said that the cost of that dish was over $1000.00 (one thousand, yes) dollars per serving.  The lobsters weren't part of the actual dish-they were just used to add flavour to the asparagus.  Blatant consumerism, but it makes good television.  I have a real soft spot for old cartoons, with the glaring exception of the Flintstones, which I never liked.  I love the Fantastic Four, and Scooby Doo, and most of the rest of the old 60's and early 70's stuff.   But I found a cartoon on Boomerang today that really has me in a knot, called Rickety Rocket.  This has got to be the most blatantly racist cartoon I've ever seen.  It dates back from the mid/late 70's and is basically about four black kids living in a space-age ghetto, who built themselves a rocket.  It's unbelievably stereotyped and it's really got me torqued up.  I don't think that they ought to be promoting those kind of ideas.. I don't care if they label it "1979" or not.  It needs to come off the air, period.  Don't we have enough David Dukes in the world already?     Anyway, I'm trying to stay up late tonight if I can, so I can get some sleep tomorrow.  If my hand felt better I could knit some more.  As the night goes on I might be able to.  In the meantime, I think probably best if I just put some laundry in and see how the rest of the night goes.  As I think about it, you could probably argue that most of the old 70's cartoons were racist to some degree.  But I don't think I've ever seen one that was quite as blatant as Rickety Rocket.  What they've done to the really old cartoons-the old Bugs Bunny/Warner Brothers cartoons-is a crime-they've actually edited them for violence, and the ones that deal with WW2 and other nationalistic themes that might not be acceptable in a politically correct world don't get airplay.  I have quite a few of them in collections-ones that deal with Hitler, and show Churchill and kamikaze bombers, and make fun of the Russians.  You'd be amazed at how politically aware these cartoons were of current events at the time.. but then again, they were designed for an adult audience, in a time of war.  They also take on a whole new meaning if you have some idea of the cultural situation of the 30's and 40's-popular movie stars and other pop icons are often referred to; jokes and visual gags that are often missed today by an audience that has no frame of reference for them.  But these cartoons don't get airplay, because of today's political and social situation that makes them incorrect and offensive.  What's up with Rickety Rocket?  That show needs to be off the air.  Period, end of discussion.   urlLink      urlLink ');"> postCount(' ');

      I've been too busy knitting to write, and besides, his writing's more interesting than mine.                     Diary of a Traveling Preacher                       Volume 5, Chapter 14                  January 30 - February 10, 2004                   "Narottam! Narottam! Narottam!"  "Why do you want to visit my country?" the Bangladesh Ambassador asked suspiciously. "We're the poorest people on earth."  "I know, Sir," I replied as I adjusted my Yankees baseball cap, "but in a BBC survey several years ago it was determined that the people of Bangladesh are the happiest on earth. I am curious to find out why the poorest are the happiest. My country, America, is the world's richest, but came in a disappointing seventh place in the survey in terms of contentedness. Obviously, happiness is not synonymous with material prosperity."  "I'm intrigued by your reasoning," the ambassador said. "I'm a Muslim, and the Koran teaches the same principle. I'll make an exception and grant you a visa. As an American, you'd normally have to obtain it at our embassy in America, not here in a foreign country.  "Thank you very much," I replied, for I had been unsuccessful in applying for the visa at Bangladesh embassies in three other countries, and was relieved to have been granted it before leaving the Islamic nation I was visiting.  "I've got one request, though," the ambassador said. "Please come to my residence this evening for dinner. My wife is an excellent cook and she is preparing stewed lamb. We can continue our talk about the illusion of material happiness."  I had to think quick. An invitation to an ambassador's house is rarely refused.  "I'm so sorry, Sir, I have a flight out tonight," I replied.  "Well, here's my card. Next time you come and stay with me," he concluded.  As I got up to leave, the ambassador took a photo guidebook from his desk. He then quickly signed it and gave it to me with a handshake. It read: "To Mr Tibbitts with love. May you find the happiness you're looking for in our beautiful Bangladesh. Mohammed Ilah."  I had no doubt I would find happiness in Bangladesh, but it would be of a specific nature. The former Indian State of East Bengal (known as East Pakistan after the partition of India by the British in 1947) became the sovereign state of Bangladesh in 1972 as a result of the war for independence.  Being part of India's rich spiritual past, it contains many holy places especially dear to the followers of Lord Caitanya. Numerous devotees of Lord Caitanya took birth there and the Lord Himself performed many sankirtan lilas throughout Bangladesh's towns and villages. The capital, Dhaka, was a favorite preaching place of Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Saraswati in the 1930s. He once called Dhaka a second Vrindavan, because it contains more than 700 magnificent Radha-Krsna temples.  I would be traveling to these holy tirthas with a dear godbrother, Radhanath Swami. Months ago, we had met in our travels and discovered that we shared the same attraction to the pastimes and songs of Srila Narottam das Thakur, one of the principle acarayas in our Gaudiya Vaisnava sampradaya, who appeared after Lord Caitanya's departure from this world. We had longed to visit his birthplace, Keturi, in Bangladesh, for years. Our trip was a dream come true for both of us. I would be meeting Maharaja and several of his brahmacaris in Dhaka the next day. My visa had come at the last moment!  As I was packing my bags that afternoon for the overnight flight to Dhaka, I realized I needed a number of toiletries, so I left the apartment where I was staying and took a short walk to a local store just across from a large mosque. On the way back, three young Oriental women ran up to me in apparent distress. Sensing they might be in danger, I instinctively stepped forward to help when suddenly they threw their arms around me and said in unison, "Nice American man need a lady?"  In the split second it took me to realize they were prostitutes, one of them drew closer to kiss me. Yelling out "Nrsimhadeva," I broke free from their grasp and ran down the street in a state of shock that prostitutes would operate on the streets of such a strict Islamic country. When I returned to the apartment, several devotees saw me. One said, "You look like you've seen a ghost!"  "Worse," I said. "Some prostitutes accosted me. I feel contaminated by their touch."  "Take shelter of Haridas Thakur," another boy suggested. "He was also attacked by a prostitute, but was protected by the holy names of the Lord."  I recalled the incident during the flight that evening and prayed: "Dear Namacarya, please give me shelter at your lotus feet and free my mind of any impurity."  At Dhaka Airport I handed the immigration officer my passport and a form all passengers had to complete with their personal details. I was in nondevotee clothes, as Hindus comprise only 10% of the population and there is sometimes tension between them and the majority Muslims. After studying the form for a moment the officer looked up and said, "You wrote that you'll be staying in a hotel, but you didn't mention which hotel. You have to tell me which hotel or I can't let you in."  I was stunned.  I had no idea of the name of any hotel in Dhaka. I stood there for a moment, and then the officer motioned me to a nearby room. Suddenly, an Indian man who was watching us stepped forward and chastised the officer.  "For goodness sake, man, he's a tourist. How is he supposed to know which hotels we have here? Foreigners don't come here often and when they do we can't treat them like this. Let him in through!"  Somehow his words worked and the officer stamped my passport. As I collected my baggage the Indian man walked by and whispered softly, "Hare Krsna. Have a good trip."  Outside the terminal I met Radhanath Swami and 12 brahmacaris from his temple in Mumbai, also all in nondevotee dress. We took prasadam and then sat in a nearby field to discuss our itinerary. We had only 10 days and had to select which tirthas to visit. We decided to begin our journey at the birthplace of Rupa Goswami and Sanatana Goswami in Jessore in the southwest of the country. Our guide, Caru Candra das, the regional secretary for the Bangladesh yatra, quickly purchased our tickets and two hours later we were on our way.  During the flight Radhanath Swami leaned over and said to me, "Maharaja, I have a suggestion. Before visiting the home of Rupa and Sanatana we should first visit Benapol, which is only a 45-minute drive outside Jessore."  "Fine," I replied, not bothering to ask which pastime took place at Benapol. I trusted that Maharaja knew best, as he is familiar with the tirthas of Lord Caitanya and his followers.  As I reclined in my seat, exhausted from the long-distance flight, I reflected on my good fortune to be traveling with Maharaja and his men. "I need it," I thought, "especially after that encounter with the prostitutes."  Just as I was about to fall asleep curiosity got the better of me. I opened my eyes and looked over at Radhanath Swami. "What pastime happened in Benapol, Maharaja?" I said.  "Oh, that's where Haridas Thakur delivered the prostitute who approached him," he replied nonchalantly.  I practically jumped out of my seat.  "What's wrong, Maharaja?" he said, amazed at my reaction.  "I'll tell you when we get there," I said, "but I think the Lord has answered my prayers." I was thinking of a passage from Srila Bhaktivinoda  Thakura's "The Bhagavat: Its Philosophy, Its Ethics & Its Theology":  "Do the spiritual masters, after they disappear, bestow their mercy upon the living entities? The souls of great thinkers of bygone ages, who now live spiritually, often approach an inquiring spirit and assist him in his development."  From Jessore Airport we took a taxi to Benapol, a small village in the jungle. It was dark when we arrived, but Haridas Thakur's bhajan kutir was still open. I almost ran to it and falling down before his murti repeated my prayer for mercy. As I studied the altar I was curious to see the murti of a shaven-headed woman in a white sari, the same size as that of Haridas Thakur.  "That's Laksahira, the prostitute who was sent by a government official to make Haridas Thakur fall down," Radhanath Swami said. "The idea was that soldiers hiding in the foliage would catch them in union and arrest and defame Haridas Thakur. But after listening to Haridas Thakur's chanting of the holy names for three days, Laksahira became purified and surrendered to him. He initiated her and she became a great devotee."  I prayed for the mercy of Haridas Thakur and Laksahira.  That night we slept in a darmsala on the property and I had a wonderful dream. All night I dreamt that myself, Radhanath Swami and the brahmacaris were dancing around the courtyard of Haridas Thakur's bhajan kutir. In fact, I woke up several times, but when falling asleep again would have the same dream. In the morning I awoke feeling purified. For the rest of the trip I never again thought of the prostitutes who attacked me. Such is the mercy of the "soul of a great thinker."  The next day we went to Rupa and Sanatana's birthplace outside Jessore. Like most of the other holy places we would visit, there wasn't much to see. After partition, the minority Hindus were persecuted and many of their temples destroyed. The policy continued after the founding of Bangladesh. Thus, wherever we would go, all that would be left of most tirthas was one or two reminders of the lilas that manifested there. This was particularly true at the home of Rupa and Sanatana. All that was there was a single tree. But when we learned it was the very tree under which the goswamis did daily bhajan, we ourselves nestled under it and had kirtan for several hours. Often a holy place is built up with many shrines and temples to attract pilgrims and impress upon them its importance, but here we had only a single tree on which to focus. As we were chanting in the simple jungle environment, I was thinking that one day it, too, might become a renown holy tirtha. For the moment it remains hidden from the world, retaining a charm rich in Gaudiya history and saturated with mercy. As the hours passed, I closed my eyes and absorbed myself in the holy names at the spot where Rupa and Sanatana chanted the very same names.  Our next destination was ISKCON's large temple a few kilometers away. As we drove there I inquired from Caru Candra why the temple was not built at the auspicious site we had just visited. He replied that the local Muslim authorities would not sell it to us, so ISKCON accepted an offer from a Hindu organization that owned land nearby. It proved to be a better arrangement, because the ISKCON land is situated in the center of 96 Hindu villages. It is a more secure location and we have a captive audience. In fact, when the beautiful temple was opened in 1999 after years of construction, more than one million people from all over the country attended.  Two days later we flew to Rajshahi in the northwest, a short distance from Keturi on the banks of the Padmavati River. As our car rumbled along the dirt roads leading to the isolated village my heart beat in anticipation of the darsan ahead. I was praying that we'd find more than a single tree. I wasn't disappointed. Though Keturi consists of only 40 families (38 Muslim and two Hindu), we were happy to discover a small, walled temple compound just outside the village.  One of Narottam das Thakur's major contributions was organizing the inaugural Gaura-purnima festival, the yearly observance of Lord Caitanya's appearance, at Keturi, with many important Vaisnavas of the time attending, including Lord Nityananda's wife, Jahnava mata. At that historic event, Narottam das Thakur installed six Deities - five Krsna Deities and one pure gold Lord Caitanya Deity. The six Vaisnava devotees currently living at the lakeside temple, built by a pious Hindu businessman more than 100 years ago, told us that Jahnava mata collected water from the lake for cooking for the Keturi festival, and to this day the water is used only for the purpose of cooking. I was unable to discover what happened to most of the Deities - Sri Krsna, Vallabha-kanta, Radha-kanta and Radha-raman. I do know that Vraja-mohan was sent to Vrindavan soon after the installation and the Gauranga Deity was moved to India during the war for independence. I noticed, however, six beautiful salagram-silas on the altar. When I later inquired about Them, the pujari told me They were from the Keturi festival era.  We spent most of the next day hearing and chanting. It was clear that being literally in the middle of nowhere, surrounded by paddy fields, there was nothing to do but fully immerse ourselves in hearing and chanting. The following day, however, a trip was arranged to a small hill where Narottam das Thakur did his daily bhajan. It was a 4km walk through the fields, and I was again struck by the fact that such a tirtha was so isolated. There was only a small stone asana with no inscription marking the spot. Of course, the fact that there was no significant shrine didn't diminish its spiritual potency, so we again immersed ourselves in bhajan and japa, trying to open our spiritual eyes and see the sanctity of the place with spiritual vision.  In the afternoon, we visited the place on the Padmavati where Narottam das Thakur received the special mercy of Lord Caitanya. Once while having kirtan with His associates in the village of Rama Keli, Lord Caitanya began calling out, "Narottam! Narottam! Narottam!" and fell to the ground unconscious. When He awoke He revealed that soon a great devotee named Narottam das would take birth and would be instrumental in carrying on His mission. Mahaprabhu told the devotees that He would deposit his prema (love of God) in the Padmavati, and at a certain time Narottam das would take bath there and attain pure love of God. Years later, when Narottam das was still a boy, he bathed in the exact spot where Mahaprabhu had deposited His prema and immediately he was overwhelmed with ecstatic love for Krsna. Imbued with that mercy, he was constantly floating in the ocean of love of God and was empowered to spread that love everywhere.  As we searched for the precise location of the lila, we came to a small Vaisnava temple on the banks of the river. Inquiring further, we discovered it was indeed the place. The devotee couple and their two children who oversee the temple were overjoyed by our unsolicited visit. Because Bangladesh is a Muslim country, it is rare that devotees visit such holy places. The man excitedly showed us the tree under which Narottam das Thakur had bathed and which the couple worship daily. We paid our obeisances to the tree, had kirtan there and then bathed in the sanctified waters nearby. I had brought a two-liter plastic Bisleri water bottle for the occasion, and after emptying it carefully filled it with water from the holy river.  As we were preparing to leave the next morning, I went to the main temple at Keturi to take a last darsan of the Deities. The pujari was doing a quick puja of the salagrams, and I was surprised to see him simply throw some water over Them, dry Them quickly and place Them back on the altar. It was a simple worship at best. He didn't massage Them in oil, which is customary, or even offer sandalwood paste or Tulasi leaves. When I saw the small fruit plate he offered Them I became disappointed. Just then the superintendent of the temple appeared and I brought the seemingly poor standard of worship to his attention.  He hung his head and said, "It's true what you say. I've tried to impress this on the priests for years but they don't seem to care."  I thought, "These are such important Deities, a part of the pastimes of Narottam das Thakur. They deserve more than this," and decided to take a chance.  "Narottam das Thakur is a great source of inspiration for me," I said. "He's a great preacher and a deeply realized devotee. He's one of my heroes. I often think of him while preaching his message in western countries."  Pausing for a moment and praying for mercy, I then said, "Would you consider giving me one of those salagrams? I'll take good care of the Deity, offering Him opulent worship. And He'll be part of Lord Caitanya's preaching movement in the West, inspiring many devotees."  I was stunned by his reply.  "I've been observing your group closely," he said. "I can see that you are sincere Vaisnavas and that you all have deep affection for Narottam das Thakur. So take any salagram you want. Just indicate to the pujari which one you desire."  I had already chosen the principle salagram on the altar. He was the biggest one, exquisitely beautiful and smooth as glass. He had a big mouth with two enormous cakras inside. A sweeping cakra also came around His side.  "I'll take Him," I said, motioning with my head (not my finger, which is considered impolite in Vedic etiquette).  The superintendent instructed the pujari, who took the salagram off the altar without any apparent emotion. He quickly put Him in my hand. I stood there, my hand trembling, trying to fathom the mercy I had received.  When I went back to my room to collect my belongings for our departure, I showed the Deity to Radhanath Swami, who was struck with wonder.  "He's so majestic," were his first words. "You are so fortunate. You're taking a part of Keturi's history with you. Who is He, which incarnation?"  "Because of His large mouth and cakras, He's surely Nrsimhadeva," I replied. "But because he has that tusk coming around the side, I think He's also Varaha. And from what I learned from the late Viswambara Goswami, of the Radha-Raman temple in Vrindavan, that small cakra inside could indicate that Laksmidevi is present. I think this sila is Varaha-Nrsimha. But let's call Him Keturi-nath, Lord of Keturi."  "That's wonderful," Maharaja said.  "Tomorrow we'll offer Him an elaborate bathing ceremony, with lots of Tulasi leaves and a big feast," I concluded.  Sadly, we then left Keturi, the holy abode of Narottam das Thakur's pastimes. While clutching the precious gift to my heart, I considered that not only our small group of pilgrims had received the good fortune of Keturi but so, too, would many Vaisnavas around the world.  We visited several other holy tirthas in the following days, such as those of stalwart associates of Lord Caitanya like Pundarik Vidyanidhi, Vasudeva Datta, Mukunda Datta and Murari Gupta. We even visited the ancestral home of Lord Caitanya's father, Jagannath Misra, an ancient array of stone buildings in the jungle in northern Bangladesh. But our experiences in Keturi left the greatest impression upon me. After Keturi I hankered to get back to my preaching services in the West. In more ways than one, I had received special mercy - and I wanted to share it with others.  I didn't have long to wait. At Dhaka Airport, while in a lounge preparing to board my flight out of the country, a Muslim holy man approached me. As a security measure, I was dressed in nondevotee clothes and sported a two-week beard. Many Muslims assumed I was one of them, and had been respectfully addressing me with salamalekam (greetings). This particular man pointed to my bottle of special water and said in broken English, "Allah Akbar! I'm very dry. Very thirsty. Please water."  I froze. He wanted to drink from my bottle of water from the Padmavati River where Narottam das Thakur had received prema. Every drop in that bottle was sacred. It was capable of giving more than liberation, it could give love of God. But he thought it was just an ordinary bottle of water. I hesitated for a moment, and several Muslim men looked at me. Obviously, you don't refuse a Muslim holy man's request for a simple drink of water. So I handed him the bottle and he proceeded to drink with gusto. I watched in shock as he guzzled more than half the bottle. He then turned to me and said, "Allah has been very kind to me today!"  "Yes, indeed He has," I replied with a smile.  I thought, "My preaching has already begun. Even before leaving Bangladesh I' m sharing the good fortune of my pilgrimage with others. Indeed, this must be the perfection of visiting a holy place."  gaur amara, je-saba sthane, koralo bhramana range se-saba sthana, heribo ami, pranayi-bhakata-sange  "All those places where my Lord Gaurasundara traveled for pastimes I will visit in the company of loving devotees."

      Just for the hell of it, do something nice for someone today.  So far today I've done two things I really didn't have to do for people, and even though they are both work related, I feel pretty good.  Not in the sense that, oh, I'm such a good person, but in the sense that hey, something I did made someone else feel pretty good.  The things don't have to be big or complicated.  Sometimes things that make you swallow your pride or be a little humble are the best.  I listened to someone today, just listened, while they were upset, and let them be upset, and get over it.  You'd be amazed how much that can mean to a person.  The other person I just thanked.  Not for anything specific, just in general.  And not in a buttkissing insincere way.  Just find something good you can thank someone for.  You'd be amazed how being kind to someone else can really translate into being kind to yourself.  That being said, spring has sprung.  I am going to bask outside today as it is sunny and going to be 70+.  My hydrangeas are waking up, the fruit trees are blooming (except the apples) and the roses are getting ready to pop.  I love springtime.   urlLink      urlLink ');"> postCount(' ');

      I screwed up my schedule and didn't realise I have to work tonight, so that kind of altered all my plans.  I got up early today, though, and I've spent the last couple hours working on Gurudeva's sweater.  I have to take a lot of breaks, but it's coming along-there's only about 20" left on the front, and that's it.  People sometimes ask us why we're vegetarians.  The answer can be found in the  Bhagavad-gita , chapter 9, verse 26.  I've pasted it below.  As always, if you'd like to read the entire 700 verses of the Gita, you can do so  urlLink here.   If you'd like a hard copy for yourself, you can simply  urlLink email me  and I'll be glad to send you one.  Chant Hare Krsna and be happy!  TRANSLATION (CHAPTER 9, VERSE 26)  If one offers Me with love and devotion a leaf, a flower, fruit or water, I will accept it.   PURPORT   Here Lord Krsna, having established that He is the only enjoyer, the primeval Lord, and the real object of all sacrificial offerings, reveals what types of sacrifices He desires to be offered. If one wishes to engage in devotional service to the Supreme in order to be purified and reach the goal of life--the transcendental loving service of God--then he should find out what the Lord desires of him. One who loves Krsna will give Him whatever He wants, and he avoids offering anything which is undesirable or unasked for. Thus, meat, fish and eggs should not be offered to Krsna. If He desired such things as offerings, He would have said so. Instead He clearly requests that a leaf, fruit, flowers and water be given to Him, and He says of this offering, "I will accept it." Therefore, we should understand that He will not accept meat, fish and eggs. Vegetables, grains, fruits, milk and water are the proper foods for human beings and are prescribed by Lord Krsna Himself. Whatever else we eat cannot be offered to Him, since He will not accept it. Thus we cannot be acting on the level of loving devotion if we offer such foods.  In the Third Chapter, verse thirteen, Sri Krsna explains that only the remains of sacrifice are purified and fit for consumption by those who are seeking advancement in life and release from the clutches of the material entanglement. Those who do not make an offering of their food, He says in the same verse, are said to be eating only sin. In other words, their every mouthful is simply deepening their involvement in the complexities of material nature. But preparing nice, simple vegetable dishes, offering them before the picture or Deity of Lord Krsna and bowing down and praying for Him to accept such a humble offering, enable one to advance steadily in life, to purify the body, and to create fine brain tissues which will lead to clear thinking. Above all, the offering should be made with an attitude of love. Krsna has no need of food, since He already possesses everything that be, yet He will accept the offering of one who desires to please Him in that way. The important element, in preparation, in serving and in offering, is to act with love for Krsna.  The impersonalist philosophers, who wish to maintain that the Absolute Truth is without senses, cannot comprehend this verse of Bhagavad-gita. To them, it is either a metaphor or proof of the mundane character of Krsna, the speaker of the Gita. But, in actuality, Krsna, the Supreme Godhead, has senses, and it is stated that His senses are interchangeable; in other words, one sense can perform the function of any other. This is what it means to say that Krsna is absolute. Lacking senses, He could hardly be considered full in all opulences. In the Seventh Chapter, Krsna has explained that He impregnates the living entities into material nature. This is done by His looking upon material nature. And so in this instance, Krsna's hearing the devotee's words of love in offering foodstuffs is wholly identical with His eating and actually tasting. This point should be emphasized: because of His absolute position, His hearing is wholly identical with His eating and tasting. Only the devotee, who accepts Krsna as He describes Himself, without interpretation, can understand that the Supreme Absolute Truth can eat food and enjoy it.    urlLink      urlLink ');"> postCount(' ');

      I didn't know it was St. Patrick's day til my homepage loaded in green.    I've been in the NYC St. Patrick's day parade eight or nine times.  It was always freezing cold and generally sleeting.  Putting a kid through that ought to be some kind of illegal.  I remember the first year I did it I got terrible bleeding blisters.  It's about five or six miles long, I think.  The shoes I had were awful.  Anyway, have a happy.  I wonder what the weather is in NYC today.   urlLink      urlLink ');"> postCount(' ');

      If you recall, a few days ago I was singing old 70's hits and posing questions about the brain's capacity to remember stuff.  Well, I did know the answer all the time, and so I'll share it with you.  (I'm not nearly as stupid as I look.)  The brain's got two hemispheres, left and right.  Essentially, they do different things in conjunction with each other.  One interesting thing is that the left brain controls the right side of the body and the right brain controls the left side of the body.  This becomes painfully evident when someone suffers a stroke and depending on where the stroke occurs in the brain, the body is affected.  Most people don't realise that other consequences of stroke, like emotional difficulty, loss of ability to read, speech disturbances, etc., also depend on where in the brain the stroke occurs.  Anyway, the two halves of the brain control different things.  The left side of the brain is the processor, the linear equations wizard.  The right side is the random, intuitive side.  They work together, but everyone has one half of the brain that dominates the other.  Typically, in a right handed person, it would be the left brain.  In me, it's the right brain, which has been previously discussed and probably explains a lot about why I am the way I am.  The point is that when you sing, you use both halves of your brain.  The left brain remembers the words, and the right remembers the tune.  This is why we sing the alphabet.  It also explains why, if you are trying to learn, for example, to recite something in a language you don't understand, if you sing it, you will remember it much easier than if you simply try to speak it.  So be careful what you sing.. you'll be singing it 30 years from now.   urlLink      urlLink ');"> postCount(' ');

      Briefly, it's been raining now since Sunday night and it's really taking a toll on my hand.  My big focus has to be Gurudeva's sweater, so I am trying to conserve my pain tolerance for that.  I've also been trying to do some other things that don't much involve my hands.  I've been going through my tapes and things of Gurudeva's visit last year and burning some CDs of kirtan, etc.  I have one that's pretty incredible.  If you'd like a copy of kirtan from Indradyumna Swami's visit to North Carolina in 2003, these are available for at least a $5 donation.  All the money raised is going to go to the 2004 Polish Festival tour.  Please think about donating.  The festivals reach so many people and do so much good.  But everything costs money, and it doesn't grow on trees.  So this is just part of my effort to raise some money for the tour.  Just  urlLink email me  and we can set something up through Paypal.  Apart from that, everything else is fine.  I slept way, way too long today, so long I'm just sore and stiff.  Today I'm not going to do anything but knit and laundry and a bit of straightening up around here.  That sweater  has  to get done.  Chant Hare Krishna and be happy.   urlLink      urlLink ');"> postCount(' ');

      In case you were at a loss for what to do with the cheese once you've made it, here's a recipe.  You can get a whole book of these recipes for free simply by  urlLink emailing me  and asking for one.  In this recipe, the cheese is referred to as 'curd'.  It is also known as paneer or panir.  Curd Patties   1 gallon milk  2 teaspoons salt  1 tablespoon chopped fresh coriander leaves  4 tablespoons ghee  ½ teaspoons black pepper  From milk, make curd. Press curd for 20 minutes. Knead curd into a smooth consistency by pressing against counter top or board with palm of hand.  Add coriander leaves and spices to curd. Make 12 balls and form into patties 2 inches in diameter.   Heat ghee in nonstick skillet over medium heat. Fry patties on both sides until golden brown (about 5 minutes).   Offer to Krishna and serve hot - plain or with tomato chutney.    Makes 1 dozen.    urlLink      urlLink ');"> postCount(' ');

      So there I was in the kitchen making cheese, singing 'Precious and Few' like I've been singing it every day of my life.  The whole scene felt a bit surreal, like a movie, in a way.  I have no idea how the human brain can remember things like that.  When was that song a hit?  1972?  I would have been four at the time, and my mom would have been listening to 77 WABC (yes, I'm old enough to remember when people actually listened to AM radio, and when AM radio played music).  So how is it that the brain remembers this stuff?  And how is it that I can remember song lyrics but not a single theorem from when I was in geometry in 1985?  The mind boggles.  And just in case you were wanting, the recipe for cheese (panir) is buried somewhere in a post below.  It cuts better if you refrigerate it a while first.  urlLink      urlLink ');"> postCount(' ');

      The back of Gurudeva's sweater is done and I've begun the front.  This is really the home stretch.  My hand is not good.  I'm posting the most recent entry to Gurudeva's diary-partly because it's so good to read, and partly because it hurts quite a lot to type.  Chant Hare Krishna and be happy.                        Diary of a Traveling Preacher                           Volume 5, Chapter 13                            January 31, 2003                           "A Gift of Grace"  This chapter consists entirely of letters written by, to, or about Lance Ackerman, a South African devotee. His first letter is to Sankarsan Prabhu, a dear Godbrother of mine based in Austin, Texas.  December 1, 2003  Dear Sankarsan das,  I am trying to locate a devotee who taught me a great deal many years ago. He headed up the Temple of Understanding in Durban, South Africa, in 1987. His name was Indradyumna Swami.  He then went on a trip up the Amazon, and since then I have lost track of him. I would really love to talk to him again. He inspired my life at the time and started me on the road to higher consciousness.  I should be most happy if you could help me with this or steer me toward someone who could help me locate him.  Hare Krsna, Lance Ackerman                          ******************  December 3, 2003  Dear Lance,  Please accept my blessings.  Here's a hot link that you can use to e-mail Indradyumna Swami.  indradyumna.swami@pamho.net  Hoping this meets you in good health,  Always your well-wisher, Sankarsan das                          *******************  December 8, 2003  Dear Indradyumna Swami,  I am not sure if you remember me.  I first met devotees in Durban, South Africa, back in 1988. I was lucky enough to stay at the Temple of Understanding and even sat in meditation with you. The year after this I had to undergo national conscription in our defense force. I turned to the temple yet again and went through this as a religious objector, never carrying a firearm and somehow managing to stay vegetarian through out the whole two-year ordeal. I cannot begin to tell you how much the devotees helped me - collecting me on Sundays and taking me to Misty Hills [the Krsna Farm outside of Johannesburg], and then stuffing me full of prasad and sending me back with enough for the week, as well as some to give to all the others in my camp, many of whom had never heard of Krsna.  Whenever I complained about how terrible my situation was in this "war environment" I found myself trapped in, you would laugh and tell me Krsna was placing all these obstacles in my way to make me see that the only way forward in this age of illusion was Krsna Consciousness. You would say the sooner I resigned myself to the truth, the better for me.  When you heard that I spent a lot of time in the bushvelt and had no Bhagavad Gita to read, you gave me a small copy. This fit in the ammo side-pockets of my pants and meant I always had access to the word of Krsna.  When I look back and realize how many blessings Krsna was bestowing on me at the tender age of 19, I now realize you were correct: there was only one real choice for me. Unfortunately, hindsight is always better and not a privilege you have when you most need it.  Unfortunately, I eventually fell back into my material ways and now find myself, at age 35, lost in maya and understanding less than I did when I was 19.  In 1994 I was diagnosed with a disease called cardiomyopathy and am now bedridden and battling for each breath I take. I often thought of contacting you and asking you for guidance, but never have until now.  Recently, when my heart dropped to a working rate of just 17%, the doctors installed a pacemaker. For a while it seemed like the miracle I had been waiting for. However, this was short-lived, and I developed something called atrial fibrillation. The result was that I eventually had to go to the hospital to have my heart shocked back into rhythm.  It was at this point that something happened which told me I had to contact you for guidance. In the hospital my neck beads, which I had been wearing since you placed them around my neck, fell off and left me in fear of demonic powers. It felt like Krsna was deserting me, or perhaps it was me that deserted him?  Now I find myself in a state of depression, wondering about suicide. But my belief in karma will not allow me to do that either.  Please help me. I do not know who else to turn to.  Hare Krsna, Lance Ackerman                          *******************  December 10, 2003  Dear Lance,  Please accept my blessings. All glories to Srila Prabhupada.  Thank you so much for your letter, which brought both joy and sadness to my heart. Joy that you have contacted me after so many years (I do remember you!), and sadness to learn of your severe illness.  I would like to help you, as I can understand that you may be nearing the last stage of your life. Of course, life is eternal, and if we are devotees of Krsna we are simply evolving slowly towards our service in the spiritual sky.  The Lord may be giving you notice of your imminent departure, and like Maharaja Pariksit (who knew he had only seven days to live), you should become very, very serious now about hearing and chanting the glories of the Lord. There are specific duties we have at every stage of life, and the duty of one approaching the final stage is to completely absorb himself in sravanam-kirtanam, hearing and chanting about God.  Should you survive your present ordeal by the grace of the Lord, there will be no loss in such hearing and chanting. It is always auspicious! But if you are to leave your body in the near future, such hearing and chanting is the best way to prepare yourself for death.  A devotee can make a lot of advancement at the last stage of life. I have seen it many times. It is sort of like a sprinter who on the last lap sometimes gets a second wind, which propels him ahead to win the race.  So begin making an extra-special effort to advance towards life's ultimate goal, love for Krsna. Leave behind all other considerations. Just focus on what you know is right and is in your best interest: Krsna consciousness. You are in the most favorable circumstances for doing just that. The Lord knows best what we all need to make progress in Krsna consciousness. So there is never anything to lament.  I am coming to South Africa in January. I will be there until February 28. I would love to come and visit you, wherever you are. We can talk more deeply then.  But know for sure that I'm with you all the way. Somehow you have remembered me after all these years. You can count on me to help you in your present situation.  I look forward to hearing from you again . . . and seeing you soon.  Your servant always, Indradyumna Swami                          *******************  December 18, 2003  Dear Indradyumna Swami,  Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! I would like nothing more than to see you.  I have never forgotten you, because you had such a lasting impact on my life. I knew what you would tell me, so there were no surprises, but to think that I may have your association again leaves me ecstatic!  I am going to immerse myself in hearing and chanting, something which I have long since stopped doing.  I will tell you, it is not the thought of death that scares me, because I understand and realize it is just another step along my spiritual path. What does concern me is the way in which I will die. It is a very painful process indeed. It also makes your arrival seem a very long time away.  I also worry about the effect of my death on those around me - my family, who have been my strength during this period of my life. They are not devotees, or even remotely close to devotees, so I will need to talk to them and explain Krsna consciousness so that they can understand.  I live quite close to the airport and would gladly send someone to collect you. I am afraid I will not be in a position to come to get you personally at this stage. But I long to speak with you!  Just hearing from you has filled my heart with joy and lifted me a great deal. I am going to work very hard to survive until you come.  I am at a loss as to what else to say, so I will just say goodbye and go find my beads and begin chanting.  Hare Krsna, Lance                          *******************  December 24, 2003  Dear Indradyumna Swami,  I am Lance Ackerman's sister. Lance died yesterday after a long debilitating illness. He spoke to me about your forthcoming trip to South Africa, which he was very excited about. He was determined to stay well long enough to meet with you. He was overjoyed to hear from you.  Lance and I have shared a home for many years. I had watched him getting weaker and more reliant on his family over the past few years. Since May of this year he had been permanently bedridden. Throughout all this he lived fearlessly, with love, joy, compassion, and intelligence, even at the worst times.  Recently, however, he became fearful, filled with anxiety and anger. When your email arrived he was about to go back into the hospital. Except for twenty-minute catnaps, he had not slept for weeks. He was despondent, in constant pain and discomfort. But after your letter arrived he slept peacefully for the first time in weeks. He made a remarkable recovery and did not have to go to the hospital. He was no longer fearful or anxious. He was relaxed and said he felt at peace.  He said that for years he had lost touch with his beliefs, but felt he was now on the right track again. He was happy and serene. Your letter gave him great comfort.  I am heartbroken that my little brother has gone. I will miss him terribly. I wanted him to hang on at any price. But I am also grateful that he found an inner peace before he died and that he was able to let go when he was ready, without fear. I thank you for that.  You had a great impact on his life. He tried to describe why he felt so joyful to hear from you, and what sticks in my mind is what he described as your passing on to him a special grace - a grace that touched him at the very end.  With thanks, Gail Ackerman                         *******************   January 31, 2003  Dear Gail,  It was with great sadness that I received your letter.  I was so much looking forward to meeting Lance again after many years. As you said, he wrote to me only a few weeks ago, asking for help in the difficult times he was going through. I am content that I was able to give him solace in the last moments of this life.  His spiritual quest grew more and more important to him in his last days. I suppose this is natural for all of us. That he died peacefully is a sign that he achieved a level of spiritual understanding and satisfaction for which all of us can be proud of him.  Like you, I will miss him. But I am sure that Lance's higher goals have taken him to a place more beautiful than the one we live in now.  Thank you for taking the time to write to me. I appreciate it very much.

      So the blog has reached the 1000+ mark.  This is, I must say in honesty, more due to the people who have linked to me than to any great merit of the site itself.  However, to those few people who do read the blog, thank you.    I have to work tonight, and then I'm off Thursday and Friday.  I am just about finished with the back of Gurudeva's sweater, then I have almost exactly 1 month to get the front done, get it sewn up, and offered.  It won't be all that easy (I am still not 100% with this hand) but I  will  get it done one way or the other.  Something else I am just tossing out in the rare event that someone reading this might be able to help:  I am trying to put together a CD of different people singing  Jaya Radha Madhava .  So if you have any tapes or CDs of anyone (anyone at all) singing this bhajan, please  urlLink let me know  so I can obtain a copy or file from you.  Of course I already have a few different people singing this song but I would like very much to have 17-20 different versions for the CD.  So please look through your old tapes, etc., and let me know.  The sound quality should be as good as possible.  Thank you in advance.    Here's looking for a good night.  I could use one of those.

      Here's a nice recipe for a cold evening: 2 cups cooked black beans (could use canned) 2 cups sweet corn kernels 2-3 plum tomatoes, diced  In a pot put about a tablespoon of oil and fry up 1 tsp cumin, 1 diced jalapeno, some hing to taste.  Add the black beans, corn, and tomatoes.  Fry this for a minute or two then add about a tablespoon of coriander powder, a tablespoon of lemon juice, salt and pepper. Reduce heat to medium and cook for about 20 minutes, until tomatoes get a little soft. Offer to Krsna over basmati or other superior rice.  (Don't use that instant rice crap.  My husband insists on eating it, but it tastes just like sawdust.  You can make good rice in the same amount of time.  Get the good rice.  It's worth it.)   urlLink      urlLink ');"> postCount(' ');

      Every year, my  urlLink Guru Maharaj  spends four months of the year in Poland doing the  urlLink Festival of India tour .   This doesn't sound like a lot, but the scale of it is enormous.  The biggest part of the festivals is the Euro Woodstock festival, that can attract over a  quarter of a million people  in three days.  To organise just one event of that scale is amazing, but the tour spends four months on festivals of varying sizes all through the country of Poland.  Just to make things more interesting, there are often legal and political barriers to the devotees coming and holding a festival in the different towns.  The Catholic church in particular often preaches against the festivals and warns people not to attend.  On several occasions devotees have been attacked and beaten by skinheads or other hostile groups that are against the festivals.  It hasn't seemed to stop the tour in the least, and in fact, in many places it is growing in popularity and eagerly looked forward to.  So the other day my friend Jayasri and I were sitting in the pavilion and talking.  She's a doctor (psychiatrist) finishing up her residency in Virginia, where she lives with her husband Murlidhar.  She mentioned that she has this very intense longing to go on the Polish tour with my Guru Maharaj and just distribute prasadam.  "Just distributing prasadam" doesn't sound like a big deal, until you realise that they can distribute 100,000 (one hundred thousand, yes) plates of prasadam in a day.  (Prasadam is food that's been offered to Krishna.  A plate of prasadam probably would contain four or five different preparations, plus something to drink, and sweets as well.  You can imagine the volumes of ingredients that are needed- 35 tons  for Woodstock alone.)  So as we talked about it, the idea caught hold of me.  I've really been wanting to go to India, more so now that I saw the video of the Panchatattva installation in Mayapur, but something about going on the tour really got my imagination.  And so we decided that summer after next, we'd go on the Polish tour (and, I said, stop in Mayapur on the way home.)  We won't be able to go for the whole four months, of course, but I'm thinking maybe I could save up vacation time enough to get at least a month or six weeks off.  How many hours is that?  Six weeks would be 240 hours.  I think I could do that.  It would be so amazing to go along.  I've talked to devotees that have done it and they say it's just out of this world.    I'm counting down the days til Gurudeva gets here.  He's here in the country now, somewhere, and soon he'll be here.  I'm going to videotape everything, and afterwards it will all be put on a DVD that we can distribute to raise money for the Polish tour for next year.  All glories to the Festival of India tour!  Jayasri and I will be there eventually.   urlLink      urlLink ');"> postCount(' ');

       I was late for the Gaura purnima festivities because I didn't know what time they were starting and so I took a nap when I got there. I am not overfond of festivals on the whole anyway because there are SO many people and everything gets very chaotic and crowded. So mostly we just hung around and had some nice association until the feast. Champakalata, who teaches at the school, was hit by a truck about 5 weeks ago (I didn't know this when it happened) and had some fractures in her pelvis, but amazingly by Gaura Nitai's mercy she was able to dance during the program with Panchatattva (who is the daughter of Apurva and Kamalini). Anyway, I didn't get to see that either, but I am sure it was very beautiful. Campaka has a little bit of a limp but otherwise she is walking without even a cane, although that limp might be more noticable to me than to someone else.  Sunday morning I was up at 0330 and at the temple by 0425. Mangal aroti is my favourite program of the day and I would gladly give up festivals, feasts, classes and everything else if I could just be at managal aroti every day. It is always so beautiful with the temple room so dark and just a few devotees there, very intimate. Their Lordships are so gorgeous-even more so I think than with all Their jewelery and flowers-there is something incredibly sweet in the simplicity of just Them in Their pajamas. As we were all doing bhajana, it occurred to me that this is really what it's all about- just being there, offering prayers and loving Radharani and Krsna, is the most important thing that there actually is. It was amazing to me, because I don't get anything that resembles a realisation very often. Mayapurchandra (Campaka's husband) led the kirtana and of course that is always a big bonus.  The morning class was given by Dhrista prabhu. He is very nice and very advanced but I must say that my favourite classes are those that are given by Mother Urmila. Also, I love how she sings Jaya Radha Madhava.  The whole day was filled with things I was going to do and should have been doing that didn't get done, but we had a very nice time anyway, and I was back at the temple just finishing up my rounds before the kirtan began for the evening program. It was a very nice program with Laksmi Nrsmha prabhu leading the kirtana, which was exceptionally ecstatic, and Garuda prabhu (who is a world religions teacher at Duke or somewhere) gave class. He is really incredible to listen to because he's so very knowledgeable about all different kinds of religions and is able to draw them all together somehow, and he can quote from sastra like it's nothing.. it is just always such a pleasure to listen to someone who is really truly knowledgeable as well as comfortable speaking in front of people, and who can present well. The class went on for a VERY long time because everyone was so interested and asking questions. (So long that I was getting restless... sometimes I hate having ADHD.)  So there we were taking prasadam (outside in the pavillion) and I was actually getting myself psychologically prepared to leave and go home when this howling noise started and went on for about 30 seconds. The next thing you know there is this unbelievable wind and stuff was flying everywhere- garbage cans, plates, twigs and branches, you name it. We all thought it was a tornado and everyone ran inside, and Mother Krishnapriya was saying how it was positively demonic and had everyone chanting Hare Krishna as the lights were flickering. There was also lightning which was very odd because the temperature was rapidly dropping. None of us knew there was this huge weather system moving into the area.  I was really pretty terrified. I found out that the winds were actually over 60MPH last night, and that a lot of people besides us thought it was a tornado because of the sound that the wind made, and lots of trees were down and power out all through North Carolina.  In other news, today is my sister's 30's birthday.  She doesn't read this blog, but just for the sake of being a good sister:  HAPPY BIRTHDAY LIANE!    urlLink      urlLink ');"> postCount(' ');

      In honour of Gaura Purnima, Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu's birthday, I am posting the following written by HDG Srila Prabhupada.  It's a bit difficult with the bad diacritics, but please excuse that.  By His Divine Grace A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupäda Gaura pahü nä bhajiyä goinu, prema-rathana-dhana heläya häräiìu. This is another song by Narottama däsa Öhäkura. He’s saying that “I have invited my spiritual death by not worshiping Lord Caitanya.” Gaura pahü nä bhajiyä goinu. Gaura pahü means “Lord Caitanya,” and nä bhajiyä, “without worshiping.” Goinu, “I have invited spiritual death.” And adhame yatane kari dhanu tainu. “Why I have invited the spiritual death? Because I am engaged in something which is useless and I have rejected the real purpose of my life.”Adhama means valueless things. And dhana means valuables. So actually, everyone of us, neglecting our spiritual emancipation, we are engaged in material sense gratification, and therefore we are losing the opportunity of this human form of body to elevate myself on the spiritual platform. This human body is especially given to the conditioned soul to take a chance for spiritual emancipation. So anyone who does not care for spiritual emancipation, he is inviting spiritual death. Spiritual death means to forget oneself, that he’s spirit. That is spiritual death. So in the animal life it is fully forgetfulness. They cannot be reminded at any circumstances that they are not this body, they are different from this body. It is only in this human form of body, human form of life, one can understand that he is not this body, he’s spirit soul. So by chanting Hare Kåñëa, one can easily understand this fact, and by worshiping Lord Caitanya, following His principles and ways, one can chant Hare Kåñëa and very easily come to the platform of spiritual understanding. But Narottama däsa Öhäkura says on our behalf that we are neglecting this. Therefore we are inviting spiritual death. Then he says that prema-rathana-dhana heläya häräiìu. Spiritual life means to develop real love. Everyone says love. There are so many signboards, so many papers, “love, love.” But there is no love. This is illusion. It is all lust. Love for intoxication, love for sex, love for this... This is going on. So actual love means… Love, this word, can be applicable only with Kåñëa, with God. Because we are created for that purpose. To love means to love Kåñëa. So that is wanted. That is spiritual love. So prema-rathana. I could achieve that transcendental position of love, but I am neglecting. Therefore I am calling my spiritual death. And these things are happening due to my past misdeeds. Due to my past deeds, misdeeds, I have got a type of body. Everyone who has got this material body, it is due to past misdeeds. Sometimes we call pious deeds. Actually, so long one gets this material body there is no pious deeds. Pious deeds means no more material body. That is pious deeds. Otherwise it is to be taken as a fact that even Brahmä, who is the chief living entity within this universe and has got a mass of years as duration of life, all power, still, that is also considered as misdeeds. Because he has got the material body. So we are going deep down and down, one after another, body, by our misdeeds. In the Bhägavata also it is stated that they do not know that by this sense gratificatory process they will have another body. And the body is the cause of material pangs. Because I have got this body, therefore I feel headache, I feel stomachache. I feel this and that. But, as soon as we are out of this material body, there is no more material pangs. It is simply joyful life. Brahma-bhütaù prasannätmä [Bg. 18.54]. Prasannätmä means joyful. As soon as one gets spiritual life. So due to my past deeds, I am missing this opportunity. Apana kara mada seva… And why it is happening? Sat-saìga chäòi khainu asatyera viläsa. “I have given up the association of devotees, but I am associating with common nonsense men.” Asatyera. Asat and sat. Sat means spirit. And asat means matter. So association of material attachment means implication in this material conditional life. So one has to make association with devotees. Satäà prasaìgäd mama vérya-saàvido. One can understand about God only in association of devotees. Therefore we are advocating this Kåñëa consciousness movement, society. Actually, you’ll find, one who comes to this society, by associating a few days, a few weeks, he becomes conscious and he comes forward for initiation and further advancement. So this association is very important. And the, those who are conducting different centers and temples, they should be very responsible men. Because everything will depend on their sincere activities and character. If they are insincere, then that will not be effective. One may come and associate with us, but if we are insincere, then it will be not be effective. But if the devotees are sincere, anyone who will come in contact with a devotee, he’ll change. That is the secret. Sat-saìga chäòi asatyera viläsa. And as soon as we give up the association of these devotees, immediately mäyä will catch me. Immediately. Mäyä is just side by side. As soon as we give up this company, mäyä says “Yes, come in my company.” Without any company, nobody can remain neutral. That is not possible. He must associate with mäyä or Kåñëa. So everyone should be very much serious to keep association with devotees, with Kåñëa. When we speak of Kåñëa, “Kåñëa” means Kåñëa with His devotes. Kåñëa is never alone. Kåñëa is with Rädhäräëé. Rädhäräëé is with the gopés. And Kåñëa is with the cowherd boys. We are not impersonalists. We do not see Kåñëa alone. Similarly, Kåñëa means with Kåñëa’s devotees. So Kåñëa consciousness means to keep association with the devotees of Kåñëa. Viñaya viñama viña satata khäinu. And he says that “I have drunk always the most dangerous poison of sense gratification.” Viñaya viñama viña. Viñaya means sense gratification. Eating, sleeping, mating, and defending. These are called… These four principles are called viñaya. And viñama means dangerously. And viña means poison. If one is simply engaged with these four principles of life, just like animals then it is to be supposed that he’s simply drinking poison. That’s all. Viñaya viñama satata khäinu. “I know this (is) poison, but I am so much intoxicated that I am drinking this poison every moment.” Gaura-kértana-rase maghana nä painu. “And I could not merge myself into the saìkértana movement started by Lord Caitanya.” Oh, that is actually the fact. Those who are too much attached to materialistic way of life, or always drinking the poison of sense gratification, they are not attracted by the saìkértana movement. So at the last, Narottama däsa Öhäkura is lamenting. He’s not lamenting. He’s representing ourself. If one comes to that point of lamentation, that is also very nice. He immediately becomes purified. Lamentation means purification. So he says, keno vä ächaya präëa kichu bali… “Why I am living? I do not make association with the devotees. I do not take part in the saìkértana movement. I do not understand what is Kåñëa. I do not understand what is Lord Caitanya. Then what for I am living?” This is lamentation. “What is my happiness? What is the standard of my happiness? Why I am living?” Narottama däsa kena nä gela. “Why I did not die long, long ago? I should have died. What is the meaning of my living?” So it is not Narottama däsa Öhäkura’s lamentation. Everyone of us should think like that, that “If we cannot make association with devotees, if we do not understand what is Kåñëa consciousness movement, if we do not come in touch with Lord Caitanya and associates, it was better for me to die. And there is no other remedy.” This is the substance of this song.   urlLink      urlLink ');"> postCount(' ');

      People always think of nurses as doing a lot of saving lives and so on.  They don't usually think about all the death we see and actually participate in.  Over the course of my nursing career, which is coming up on ten years now-somewhat experienced, but still a long way to go from a battleaxe-I've seen, and participated in, a lot of death.  It's one of those things you never really get used to, no matter how your perspectives change over time.  In the beginning, as a brand new nurse, death was the enemy.  I used to cry over every patient I lost, and take it personally.  I'd get angry at the patient for dying, even, with this 'how dare you when I've worked so hard to keep you alive' mentality.  Death was failure-it meant that I'd done something wrong or not done something I should have.  I guess I had been a nurse for about three or four months when I had this patient who had terminal cancer.  People throw that 'terminal' word around a lot, but they don't really know what it means.  It means you're gonna die.  Well, we're all gonna die.  When you're terminal, you're gonna die soon.  So anyway, here was this patient, terminal, at that stage where there's not much left beyond breathing.  The whole family's been called in from all over creation and they're all in there, talking and doing all those family things that people tend to do even in the face of death (ever hear laughter at a wake? it's the same sort of thing).  They decide amongst themselves that the patient's in pain, and inform me of same.  Now, when I go in to assess the patient, all I'm seeing is unresponsiveness and a respiratory rate of ten.  The patient is a DNR (do not resuscitate) and I do have morphine IV ordered.  I don't want to give it.  The family's insisting.  I really, really, don't want to give it.  I explain that the morphine has a good chance of decreasing the respirations even further and could possibly induce respiratory arrest.  I explain that the patient isn't showing any signs of pain.  They insist.  I give the morphine.  Four minutes later, the patient is in respiratory arrest.  The family is overjoyed at what they perceive to be a "peaceful death".  I'm in the bathroom, looking in the mirror, saying, "You just killed somebody, do you know that?"  I ended up locking myself in there for a good ten minutes contemplating myself in the larger cosmos, trying to figure out how I feel about it.  Ten years of nursing later, I cannot rationalise that conclusion away.  Death is death.  You push the morphine, the patient dies.  That's murder, any way you slice it, sterilise it, sanction it or give me legal and your momma's ethical permission to do it.  It's death, induced by morphine that I just pushed into a vein.  How can it be anything else?  There's all kinds of arguments about easing pain and comfort measures and assisting people in death and so on.  Oncology nurses and hospice nurses know all about this, and they have a very, very different perspective on it than I do.  I admire them.  I could not do what they do.  I'm not knocking what they do.  I'm talking about what I did in that room ten years ago, and as far as I'm concerned, when I push morphine into someone's line and then they go into respiratory arrest, that's called killing someone.  Later on, as I moved into different areas of nursing and got to see different things, my outlook on death matured.  I began to understand how death can be a blessing or a release from a situation that basically resembles hell.  I was one of those voices saying 'Thank God' when I'd come in to work at the nursing home on a Monday and hear that this resident or that resident had passed over the weekend.  Death wasn't quite the enemy it used to be any more.  My religious perspectives also colour my ideas on death.  I can understand, cognitively, that we are not the body, and that at the time of death, the only death involved is physical, and the soul takes off to begin another life in a brand new body.  I can accept that the soul is immortal, and that nothing that happens to the body affects it in any way.  But even armed with maturity and understanding, I still find it hard to involve myself in it on a personal level.  I very recently had another experience much like the one I had ten years ago.  It brought up a lot of issues for me personally.  I was able to reflect on the difference in my attitude and my understanding of the situation.  Still, though, I come back to the same conclusion I did the first time around:  if you push the morphine and the patient goes into respiratory arrest, you killed them.  I could sit for days or weeks and argue the issue back and forth, both sides of it, probably very convincingly either way.  I understand it cognitively.  But when it's me pushing that morphine, it's a whole other ballgame.  We as nurses, we never stop to think that we literally hold life in our hands.  It looks so clean and neat, doesn't it?  Here's a ten cc syringe, with ten milligrams of morphine in ten  cc's of saline.  It's bloodless and noiseless, but given the right situation, it's the end of a life.  That's powerful.  Really powerful.  Every new nurse ought to learn about this situation and think about it, and really understand what it is we do.  We save lives, yes.  We ease pain and we wipe tail and we teach, and we do our best to help the patient.  What if that is sometimes to help the patient die?  That's a heavy load to bear, and it's worth thinking about and examining.  If it was my mother laying there, how would I feel?  Would I want that nurse to push that morphine?  Would I want to do it myself?  Knowing me, I might.  I might want to take that responsibility on myself, and not give it to another person, who doesn't know my mother, doesn't know how I feel, doesn't have a personal stake in the situation.  I might very well be saying, 'Now, momma, enough of this suffering.  Enough.  It's time to let go."  I might.  If I was, I'd rather take that responsibility myself.  It's one thing if you're convicted about it, and you feel in your heart that it's the right thing to do.  It's another thing if it's a stranger, just another patient of all the patients you've ever worked with, and you've got a family breathing down your neck with who knows what kind of motives in their own hearts.  It's heavy, and I don't even feel like I'm expressing properly exactly how heavy it is.  I have a cordial dislike of the popular 'image' of nurses.  This is the stereotype that gets propagated by soap operas (where all the nurses are busy having affairs with doctors) and porno movies (where all the nurses are busy having affairs with patients) and with countless old school images of nurses from Florence's day, standing with respect when the doctor walks in the room and doing little more than fluffing pillows and taking temperatures.  People have a lot of misconceptions about us as people and about what we do.  Here's a few facts for you:  a remarkable number of nurses have been in or are in abusive relationships.  A statistically significant percentage are codependent, have been raped, have had difficulty with substance abuse including alcoholism.  Nurses tend towards self-sacrifice, self-abnegation, self-denial.  We put our own needs, legitamate or otherwise, behind those of the people around us, however frivolous or unnecessary they might be.  We go twelve or fourteen hours without stopping to pee.  We take abuse from patients, feeling in ourselves and being told by our superiors, that we cannot defend ourselves or remove ourselves from such a situation.  We are victims of violence in the workplace.  We are single mothers, divorced women.  Very, very few nurses I know are happily married.  I am one of them.  We are underpaid, underrepresented.  In North Carolina we're un-unionized.  We work hard doing things that most people wouldn't do for any amount of money, because we believe in our hearts we're doing the right thing.  We save lives, and we sometimes hasten death.  Not all of us are nice people.  Being a nurse does not necessarily make you a nice or a good person.  It makes you a nurse.  Everyone's met an evil nurse in their life.  I had one as my nurse back in 96, who did me a good deal of physical damage because she was angry with me.  Don't ever make the mistake of thinking that just because someone's a nurse, they're morally or ethically superior.    But the great bulk of us are relatively decent people.  We carry a heavy load on us.  Some of us more than others-there are many different areas of nursing, each with its own particular burden and joy.  We find the spot in nursing that we fit, and hopefully we make a successful career of it.  Sometimes, like with me, we find ourselves put into places in nursing we might not have chosen for ourselves, and then we have the challenge to see if we can fit.  I've always said my first love is general medicine.  To me, there's nothing better than bringing someone through the raging DTs.  Of course, once they're sober, I'm absolutely done with them.  At that point, it's psych nursing, and I don't want any part of that.  But that's another story.  I just want people to stop and understand what they're asking when they ask the nurse to give that morphine.  It reminds me of a line from Lord of the Rings:  "Some that live deserve death, and some that die deserve life.  Can you give it to them?  Do not be too eager to deal out death in judgement."  Perhaps not in judgement, but it's still a heavy load to ask someone to take on for you.  Think about it.   urlLink      urlLink ');"> postCount(' ');

      Dear Satyavati Mataji,  Please accept my humble obeisances. All glories to Srila Prabhupada.  We have confirmed air tickets into North Carolina (Raleigh) on the 12th of April and out on the 16th.  Your servant, Sri Prahlada das  I will write a post sometime about Sri Prahlad.  He's pretty amazing.  But for now, I am still resting my hand (attempting to rest the hand, in between working on Gurudeva's sweater) and I need to get a couple of chores done before it gets too late around here.  I have to work tonight.  I'm putting the dates into the schedule tonight.  You can see why I start stressing over this January 1st.   urlLink      urlLink ');"> postCount(' ');

I hope there's no more discrepancy, because I am going to put my schedule in the computer at work tomorrow night.    I am not sure I'll be able to get Gurudeva's sweater finished with all the problems I've been having with my hand.  I will try, but I haven't got much time left now.

      who Dick Dale is?  He happens to be one of the coolest guitar players of all time.  The one who made that reverb surfy double picked tremolo sound so incredibly hip.  Think 'The Ventures' but he taught the Ventures how to do it.  Think every surf band you ever heard.  He showed them the way.  Very talented, and maybe "dated" now, but you'll still hear a lot of his stuff backing commercials and so on.  He influenced every big guitar name from the 60's through today, and he's still doing it.  Most people have never heard his name but can identify his sound instantly.  He did a version of the song 'Pipeline' with Stevie Ray Vaughan.   My personal favourite is 'Misirlou', but he also did a cover of 'Hava Nagila' that would probably make your Rabbi do the twist.  People forget folks like Dick Dale.  If you have the time and the inclination, you'd do well to have a listen to him sometime.

Add tomato pieces. Cover and fry on medium heat for 15 minutes or until tomatoes have become a chunky sauce. Remove from pan and put in blender on low speed for 5 seconds.

      There is now yet another new diagnosis attached to my hand: de Quervain's tenosynovitis.  Don't even get me started.  I am going to be going to therapy and splinting, and as far as can I go to work? We haven't decided that yet.  I don't feel like I am able to do a lot of the physical stuff that I should be able to do, but at the same time I don't feel like I can take any time off now.  (See below paragraph.)  There is also more dilemma surrounding the dates of Gurudeva's visit, but I have emails out trying to get this straight.  It's a good thing I am the coordinator and can fiddle with my schedule.  I might take two weeks straight off just to make sure I'm not missing anything.  All this being said, I'm just tired, and sick of the problems with this hand, and I'm going back to sleep.   urlLink      urlLink ');"> postCount(' ');

       (CNN) -- Sinclair Broadcast Group has ordered its seven ABC stations not to broadcast Friday's "Nightline" that will air the names and photographs of the more than 500 U.S. troops killed in the Iraq war.   They don't want you to know or to realise how big a price we've actually paid, in innocent lives, for a lie engineered by the White House.  There were, and are, no weapons of mass destruction in Iraq.  Iraq was not, and is not, a threat to United States national security.  We have gone to war for purely political reasons and on a false premise, touted by the Executive Officer of this country, while playing on the emotional tenor of a nation that was grievously wounded on September 11, 2001.  Over five hundred American military personnel, and thousands of Iraqi civilians, have died as a result.  Don't buy into the hype.     urlLink      urlLink ');"> postCount(' ');

Then add 1 can of pineapple chunks with the juice. To this, add 1 tsp ground cinnamon, about 10 cloves finely ground, 1 tsp salt, and 2 tbsp brown sugar.

      On Thursday March 11th and Friday March 12th in Oakland CA, about 40 Krishna devotees from the Bay Area were invited to take part in a new feature film starring Richard Gere, Juliette Binoche, Max Minghella and Kate Bosworth. The group of devotees were featured in a scene involving a rousing kirtan held at a Krishna Temple, with a few select devotees also being used in other scenes for the movie. The production will be in theatres by next winter.  Story Background  The film, entitled "Bee Season", is based on the popular novel of the same name, written by Myla Goldberg. In the story, Richard Gere plays the father Saul, who absorbs himself in the study of Jewish Mysticism. His daughter Eliza (played by young newcomer Flora Cross), becomes a national spelling bee champion. This event starts to dramatically alter the family's comfortable existence. Saul soon begins to lavish time and affection on the blossoming Eliza, leaving his son Aaron desperately searching to find a replacement for the connections to his father and his Jewish faith.  First-time actor Max Minghella, son of "Cold Mountain" director Anthony Minghella, plays the part of Aaron. Now Aaron embarks on a type of spiritual vision quest, which leads him to meet Kate Bosworth's character Chali, who is a Hare Krishna devotee in the film. He becomes curious about her chanting the Hare Krishna Mantra on japa beads, and begins to ask her questions about the philosophy. I overheard Kate rehearsing some of her dialogue off-set, and I heard, "There are many names of God. We call Him Krishna". She later takes Aaron to the temple, where they join the devotees for an ecstatic kirtan!  How it all came about  The film crew initially contacted Grantharaja dasa from the Bhaktivedanta Institute at the Berkeley Krishna Temple. He in turn put them in touch with Gadadhara dasa, a recent graduate of San Francisco State's Cinema department. Gadadhara dasa then busily set out to coordinate an incredible mountain of legal and logistical details! Everything from casting to costume design to choreography was amazingly pulled together by this hard-working devotee. He even drove all the way to up to Redwood Valley in Mendocino County to bring a beautiful Murti of Srila Prabhupada down to the film set. On Thursday before the film shoot, he and I prepared an enormous amount of prasadam to be distributed to the film crew the next day. We brought lots of Krishna books to distribute as well.  A week or so before the film shoot, Gadadhara dasa even arranged for Max Minghella, Kate Bosworth and others to meet with Hansadutta dasa, and hear from him all about Krishna Consciousness. They listened with rapt attention for over an hour and a half, being mesmerized by his expert preaching. Later they took Krishna prasadam. It was clear that they were very profoundly affected by his explanations of the chanting, the philosophy and the science of self-realization. On the day of the film shoot, I spoke with Cristina Solletti a legal clearance/Krishna devotee liaison on the crew, who commented, "Until we all got to meet with Hansadutta, no one had ever been able to so clearly articulate to us what Krishna Consciousness actually is. He made it so easy for us to understand the philosophy. It was just amazing".  Devotees on the Set, "Lights, camera...action!"  The actual filming of the kirtan scene was a fascinating experience for the devotees, and a very powerful experience for the film crew. Before the cameras rolled, we were summoned onto the set for a rehearsal kirtan. Locannath dasa from Berkeley did a wonderful job leading our kirtans for the filming, and as soon as we started chanting the Hare Krishna Maha-mantra, we noticed a change in the atmosphere on the set, and in the attitudes of the film crew.  After about two or three minutes of kirtan, the dual-directing team of Scott McGhee and David Seigel (who previously directed "The Deep End") stopped everyone, looked at each other and commented, "Wow, that's really powerful. This is going to be a great shoot!" They later commented, "Your spiritual practice of chanting Hare Krishna is the most beautiful thing we have ever witnessed. Outside of some very basic choreography that we need from you, whatever you naturally do, just go for it. We want you to really let go!" And, that's just what we did. It was completely ecstatic. We actually saw a lot of the crew members chanting and dancing along with us from behind all the props and equipment!  One really interesting thing that happened for the crew was their observation of the natural tendency for the men in the kirtan party to gravitate to the center, and for the women to remain around the outside. They stopped us a couple of times, and tried to get us to evenly mix and mingle the men and the women. One devotee commented, "You can't change nature". I spoke with Kate Bosworth several times on the film set, and she told me, "Wow, I never realized how fun the chanting and dancing could be. No wonder the devotees are always so happy when I see them out chanting in the streets!"  For those of you who don't recognize Kate's name as an actress, she played the blonde surfer in the film, "Blue Crush". I later gave Max and her some japa beads, a book on Kirtan, and then I let her choose which style and color of bead bag she wanted from an assortment I brought from Vrindavan India. Upon this, she commented, "Now I want to go to India!" I encouraged her to definitely go if she finds the time between her many movie projects.  As mentioned earlier, some devotees got to be on the film set for two whole days, because they were cast in some other scenes for the movie besides the kirtan scene. Kuvalesaya dasa, who came all the way up from Los Angeles, was cast in a scene where he meets Richard Gere, who asks him directions to the temple. Other devotees who were cast in small scenes included Laxshmi devi dasi, Krishna Priya devi dasi, Abhaya dasa, and bhaktas Chad, Paul and Ian, who played background pedestrians and car drivers.  "Cut. That's a wrap!"  At the end of day two's filming, several members of the film crew unanimously commented to the devotees that, "Your presence here and your chanting scene has not only been the most fun for all of us, but it has been the most incredible part of the entire movie!" It was truly a wonderful opportunity for us to be able to meet, talk with and preach to this very nice film crew. I saw many of them on several occasions reading Srila Prabhupada's books. They were all very respectful, pious people, and they clearly appreciated the chance to intimately spend time with so many devotees.  We were all grateful for the chance to spread the Holy Names of Krishna through the medium of a motion picture. We can only hope that the editors don't cut out too much of our all-too-brief scenes for this film! In conclusion, I'd like to mention that it was clear to all of the devotees that this event was the direct arrangement of Krishna. We agreed that "we were not the doers" of anything.  As Lord Krishna says in Bhagavad-gita, "I am the ability in man". Ki Jaya!    urlLink      urlLink ');"> postCount(' ');

      AMSTERDAM, The Netherlands (Reuters) -- Body piercing and tattoos make way. A new fashion statement has hit the Netherlands -- eyeball jewelry.  Dutch eye surgeons have implanted tiny pieces of jewelry called "JewelEye" in the mucous membrane of the eyes of six women and one man in cosmetic surgery pioneered by an ophthalmic surgery research and development institute in Rotterdam.  The procedure involves inserting a 3.5 mm (0.13 inch) wide piece of specially developed jewelry -- the range includes a glittering half-moon or heart -- into the eye's mucous membrane under local anesthetic at a cost of 500 to 1,000 euros ($600 to $1,200).   urlLink      urlLink ');"> postCount(' ');

      Pain is bad, but living with chronic pain sucks.  I've done something to my bad ankle.  There I was, just standing in front of the microwave at work, not even moving, wearing Birkenstocks for Christmas sake, when I felt something tear.  It swelled up instantly.  The pain hasn't gone away, and it's been 24+ hours.  I'm not sure what it is-it could be scar tissue, or tendons, or ligaments.  I don't think it's bone.  It could be my imagination (but I doubt it).  Dr. Scully told me if I ever broke this ankle again, I'd need carbon-fiber grafting and stuff.  He really scared me.   All this being said, I have to go back to work tonight, and if it isn't better by morning, I'll be at his office.  I'm not a baby about pain.  I worked and walked for three months on a broken ankle with a 96% ligament tear.    It just sucks having to work and hurt.  Nobody cares when the nurse hurts.   urlLink      urlLink ');"> postCount(' ');

      In Guangzhou, WHO investigators tested samples from the restaurant that employed the 20-year-old waitress suspected to have SARS and where civet cat — a regional delicacy — was on the menu. They found evidence of the SARS virus on cages that held the animals, Breiman said.  "Not only were there civet cats there, but at some point civet cats that were carrying the SARS coronavirus,” he said at a news conference, adding that experts also found “many, many cages” with the virus at two live-animal markets.  Earlier research that suggested a possible link between civets and the confirmed SARS case prompted large-scale slaughter of the animals in Guangzhou and surrounding Guangdong province.  Rodents also are suspected carriers although “there isn’t conclusive proof,” said Breiman who recommended trapping them for testing. Guangzhou is exterminating thousands of rats in a campaign that began after the killing of civets.  The first known case of severe acute respiratory syndrome was recorded in November 2002 in Guangdong, where experts suspect it jumped to humans from civets or other wildlife. The outbreak sickened more than 8,000 people around the world before subsiding in June.   urlLink      urlLink ');"> postCount(' ');

      I'm really chewing on this 'to travel or not to travel' thing.  In the back of my mind I feel like it's coming, soon, but I've made so many bad decisions in my life I tend to look to other people to tell me what I need to do.  Of course, I married someone who believes in absolute independence, and his idea of helping me through a decision is "What do you want to do?"  Well hell, if I knew the answer to that, I'd do it.  So I'm praying and waiting for some kind of a sign, and hoping that things become clear.  At any rate, if I don't go now, I'll be going in January.  Don't worry-the blog will stay the same.   urlLink      urlLink ');"> postCount(' ');

      The sari is an article of clothing that dates back thousands of years.  Essentially, it is one piece of cloth, approximately 44" wide and anywhere from 6 (standard) to 9 yards long.  Saris are made of countless types of material, from cheapest synthetics to priceless hand-loomed silks.  In the past (and still today, if you have the money), embroidery was done on saris using real gold threads and real gold beads, especially for wedding saris, and afterwards, the sari would be burned to reclaim the gold.  India's textiles are some of the finest anywhere, especially in the handloom department, thanks to Ghandi's focus on spinning and weaving as cottage industries.    There are nearly as many ways to wear a sari as there are saris themselves.  Each distinct group and region has their own particular traditional style of folding and draping the cloth.  Modern media has tended to act as an equaliser in this area, and popularised certain styles of draping a sari.  In this way, caste and regional recognition based on the drape of the sari has sort of faded.    Today's most popular sari style is the nivi style, which brings the body of the sari across the front of the body and up over the left shoulder, with the pallu (highly decorated end part) draping down behind.  This style of sari is worn by millions upon millions of women every day.  That all being said, I wear my sari like a Gujarati woman, with the body of the sari coming from left to right behind me, and down over my right shoulder, the pallu spread open across the front and tucked in on the left hip.  I just find it looks better on me.   urlLink      urlLink ');"> postCount(' ');

      I've been taking my sweet time to write about these two days.  Friday morning there were just a few people present to see Gurudev off to the airport.  We were in the livingroom watching Rukmini-priya and Prahlad take care of the Deities.  Udayananda brought out my copy of Gurudeva's diary (he's up to Volume 4 now)- he had written in it for me.  As I read what he wrote, I started to cry.  The whole crying part was inevitable, just waiting for a trigger, and that was it.  I got progressively more upset to the point where I had to leave the livingroom and go on in the kitchen.  I cry easily, but it's pretty rare that I get like this, so worked up that I can't really stop.  I tried to find things to do in the kitchen thinking if I kept my hands busy that I'd be able to calm down, but it didn't help.  After a little while, he came out and called me over, and thanked me for the Vyasapuja book and the sweater, and said that the sweater would keep him warm in the Russian winter.  I got some pictures of him holding it, but I had really wanted to see him try it on, and it was sort of breaking my heart that he wasn't.  I said to him (as I was crying), 'Well, maybe someone will take a picture of you wearing it, and send it to me.'  As he was packing up the last bits, Rukmini priya asked me to cut up some papaya for them to take on the plane.  I really had to be careful because I was crying all over that papaya.  The whole front of my sari was wet.  This isn't your basic crying because you're hormonal and there's a sad movie on type crying, this was some full blown hysterical sobbing type crying.  I don't expect you to understand it, and I'm not excusing it.. I'm just giving you a report of what happened.  After I got the papaya bagged up and given to Rukmini, and tearful goodbyes and hugs for her, I went outside and took some more pictures.  The rest of the girls didn't start crying until after he left.  Me, I was on a bit of a different level that morning.  So he went to the airport with my Godbrother Visnujan and Udayananda, and of course Sri Prahlad and Rukmini (my Godsister).  She is just the sweetest, humblest person, and you can't help but love her instantly.  I hope she decides to come back next year.  To make a long story short, I cried for the next four hours.  I got my stuff all loaded up in the car and left there to go over to the temple, and I was the only one present for the noon aroti (worship).  I kept trying to calm myself down, but it seemed like I just couldn't get a grip.  It was so bad that Bala Gopal das, the pujari (person who was doing the worship on the altar) came out and gave me a note with a nice encouraging quote on it.  I must have looked one pitiful sight.  To be fair to myself, I had also just gone five days with a grand total of about twelve hours' sleep, and any military expert can tell you that sleep deprivation does weird things to people.    After the aroti, it was about 1:00PM, and I came downstairs to have lunch.  I sat with Mother Krsnapriya and Saranam, and had a brief (my very first in three years) conversation with Bir Krsna Maharaj, telling him that Gurudeva was very sorry he missed the breakfast they had scheduled.  After this, we decided that I'd stay at Saranam and Lilasuka's house that night.  I was all for the Microtel, because at this point, sleep and the absolute minimum of sensory stimulation was what I was after, but since their apartment was empty, Saranam insisted I come and stay with them.  I turned out to be a very low maintenance guest-I basically did nothing but sleep for almost fourteen hours.  No need to talk to me, feed me, or do anything to me.  Saranam said I was definitely the kind of guest she liked.  I was so incredibly tired, it wasn't even funny.  I slept through the morning program on Saturday, and even through breakfast.  I don't even think I moved from one position.  On Saturday, I came for lunch, did a few chores/errands, looked at a house for sale out in Lake Orange and came home.  Even though there were two more days left of my vacation, it kind of felt like it was all over at this point.    urlLink      urlLink ');"> postCount(' ');

      Tonight's my first night back to work.  I had a long talk with one of the travel companies yesterday about me travelling, and we've (me and Scott) have pretty much decided that if I don't do it now, I'll definitely be doing it by the first of the year.  Once it got a little real it was kind of scary to me, actually.  I want to talk to some friends who live in Hillsborough to see if I could rent a room in their house, and I'm looking for an assignment at UNC-Chapel Hill, in either med-surg, geriatrics, or rehab.  So my conditions are kind of picky, but something will definitely come up.  What this means is that I actually have to start going through everything and packing everything for the big house move now.  All of my stuff and everything that I can get packed has to be packed before I leave to make it easy on Scott, because he'll end up doing it himself.  So I guess most of my weekends from now until then will be busy doing this kind of thing.  It feels a little weird, but it'll make his life much easier if all he has to do is load boxes onto the truck when the time comes.  I'm nervous about the whole thing, but all we can do is have faith.  So, I slept a lot later than I wanted to today, and I have ironing, dishes, and cooking to do.  So I don't have much time to play online, but I did want to put a word in the blog.  I haven't really written much since I got home.. it's always very depressing to come back after a week like that.   Association with the devotees is so important, and I really feel the lack when I leave that kind of devotee environment and have to come back to everything here.   urlLink      urlLink ');"> postCount(' ');

      DISCLAIMER: Some of these descriptions will be better understood by devotees. If you have a question, please email me.   Thursday was Ekadasi, so this means fasting from grains and beans.  Everyone got up pretty late because of the kirtan from the night before, and so the morning worship was really quite late.  This morning I did a lot of videotaping, and managed to get Rukmini-priya and Prahlad doing the worship of Sri Sri Gaura Nitai and the Salagrams.  They are so incredibly focused and dedicated.  To watch them is really awe inspiring.  She is my Godsister, and she's so very humble and sweet.  He's the same way-it's kind of amazing to think that he's the closest thing to a rock star that ISKCON has.  He's probably one of the top three kirtan performers in the world, and one of the best known of all time.  Besides this, he's very humble and easily approachable, and incredibly advanced.  When he did the fire sacrifice at my initiation, he knew every single mantra by heart, through the entire ceremony, which lasted a good 45 minutes.  That's a lot of mantras to know!  He's just very advanced.. I don't know how better to put it.  Anyway, after they finished the worship, Gurudeva came out and did his worship of Sri Ugra Nrsimha.  This is a very angry form of the Lord, and one has to be extremely careful doing it.  Last year I kept thinking that He (Lord Nrsimhadev) looked more like He was laughing, but this year He looked a bit more growly and angry.  I have a picture of Him peeking out from taking rest that looks just like He's telling everyone to hush and let Him sleep.  It was very moving to watch Gurudeva do the puja (worship).    While all this was going on, there was lots of cooking in the kitchen.  Because of it being Ekadasi, Apurva and Raseswari made scrambled curd and fried potatoes with cheese, and tapioca cakes fried in ghee.  While we took breakfast we watched a video of the installation of Sri Panca-tattva (Lord Caitanya with His principal associates) in Mayapur.  It was a really great video, produced by HH Bhakti Caru Swami (and edited by Babai, who has somewhere the long-lost video of my initiation).  Nitai, Mother Phalini's son, was there, and he's in the video, so that was fun to see.  It all looked very incredible and amazing, and I'd love to go to Mayapur sometime soon.  If Jayasri and I go to Poland in '06, we'll also go to Mayapur, at least for a few days.  Yesterday also Rukmini-priya taught me how to make the most beautiful garlands.  She's so talented, and makes all the clothes herself for Sri Sri Gaura Nitai.  I am taking pictures of Them everyday because Their clothes are so unbelievably beautiful.  She said it takes about two months to make one outfit for Them.  The embroidery is very detailed and fine, and Their clothes are very form-fitted and take many pieces to put together.  Thursday afternoon we went to New Goloka in Hillsborough for a children's program.  Gurudeva went up to see the Deities and then everyone was out on the lawn.  Radhanuga pointed out to me that Gurudeva's socks had holes in them so I went flying off to find some socks.  When I got back, Bir Krsna Maharaj arrived (New Goloka is his home, and he was back from traveling himself) and spent a few minutes with Gurudeva.  I got a couple of really cute pictures.  All the children had a blast and really enjoyed themselves, and Gurudeva did too.  He makes a special emphasis with the children, and gets right on their level.  They respond really well to him, and even the shy ones were laughing and having fun before it was all over.  His memory is amazing.  He was asking them about things he'd talked to them about last year, and even when I had darshan with him yesterday afternoon, I asked if he'd tell the story about Kesava the elephant, and he said no, that he'd told it last year.  How does he remember these things?  After the children's program was over, (about an hour half), he went off to a dinner engagement.  I wasn't invited, so I stayed around at the temple for a while chanting before going back out to Udayananda's house.    When I got back there, it was just me and Raseswari, which was really nice.  It was nice to have some quiet for a change!  I did Gurudeva's ironing, which I actually had to do twice because the iron wasn't working well, and the wrinkles were coming back as quickly as I could get them out.  After working with it for some time, I got the steam thing going, and managed to get everything wrinkle-free with nice sharp creases the way I like them to be.  I also ironed another kurta and dhoti, thinking they were Sri Prahlad's, and that I'd be doing Rukmini a favour, but it turned out they weren't.  Just before eleven, Raseswari and I took a little prasadam, and I sat down to read for a while because my back was hurting and I was tired.  Just at that minute, Gurudeva arrived.  He was really tired.  It was pretty amazing to sit with him, just the 5 of us, so intimately and to listen to him talk.  He enjoyed the supper he had gone to but it was really late, and he said there was no way he could get up at 3:30, pack, do the puja, get to New Goloka for the Bhagavatam class and be ready to go to the airport by 8.  This was upsetting to me because my husband was supposed to be at the temple, and they were going to meet for a few minutes.  Gurudeva asked if there wasn't some way I could get Scott to the house so they could meet, but it being now 11:30, and Scott having to leave the house by 5 and not knowing the way to Udayananda's house, it was impossible.  So I ended up calling home to cancel the plans.  My husband was not quite as upset about it as I was.  Anyway, I knew a lot of people would be disappointed in the morning because Gurudeva was supposed to be giving class at New Goloka, but there was nothing really to be done about it.  What's unfortunate is that the way his schedule's been arranged, there are lots of late nights, and so it skews everything up for the morning.  Gurudeva was really funny talking about all kinds of things for a little while, and then they went inside to make a phone call.  I stayed up for a while, but it didn't take me too long to fall asleep-I think I was out by 2.   I can't believe this week is over already.   urlLink      urlLink ');"> postCount(' ');

      DISCLAIMER: Some of these descriptions will be better understood by devotees. If you have a question, please  urlLink email me.    Today there was a nice morning program at Udayananda's house and then most of the day was spent getting ready for the big night program.  About 150 people are expected, so it's a lot of food.  We did a lot of cooking.  My major contribution was in peripheral stuff like helping to make the salad, setting out the rolls in pans, putting together the lasagna.  There was a huge disaster when one of the lasagna pans collapsed as it came out of the oven, with lasagna all over the oven and floor.  If it had been my house I think I would have cried, but we got it together and cleaned everything up without much of a hitch.  Other people also brought prasadam, and there was more of Haripada and Phalini's killer curd subji as well as cheesecake, chickpea subji, rice, and several kinds of sweets.  There was definitely enough prasadam for everyone to enjoy.  The whole house was packed with people and the kirtan was overwhelmingly loud even as we were still cooking and offering.  Almost everyone had earplugs because it was enough to make your head wobble, and I was constantly in anxiety that one of the altars would get jiggled or (God forbid) knocked over.  At around nine PM a video of Gurudeva's tour in Poland was played and a lot of donations were collected to support the work there-over $7,000!  So that was really good.  Everyone was sort of eating and watching the video and so on simultaneously, which was a bit chaotic because it was so unregulated, but everything went off well.  People began to leave around ten, but quite a few were staying the night and the kirtan went on continuously (and very, very loudly) until 1:30AM.  I didn't get too much sleep because I had to chant my rounds, but I slept until about 6:30 AM.  It is hard to really describe a rip roaring kirtan if you've never experienced one.  It becomes very ecstatic and somewhat out of control pretty quickly if that's the mood, and people are dancing everywhere and anywhere, jumping up and down, with karatals (cymbals) and mrdungas (drums) being played by the dozens.  Everyone's chanting and singing at the top of their lungs, and in a small house, fifty people can make a LOT of noise.  I walked down to the end of the driveway at one point, where my car was, about 125 feet away, and it was still so loud I might as well have been inside.  Everyone was saying how their ears were ringing after it was all over.  A substantial number of people stayed the night, so the line for the shower the next morning was pretty long.     urlLink      urlLink ');"> postCount(' ');

      DISCLAIMER: Some of these descriptions will be better understood by devotees.  If you have a question, please  urlLink email me .  I drove to Sandy Ridge in pouring down rain.  I'm majorly underdressed as I packed for 75 degree Wilmington, not 40 degree Sandy Ridge.  I don't even have a jacket, only a chaddar, and no turtlenecks or heavy shirts, just cholis.  It's a 100 mile drive, but the countryside is beautiful.  Drove through Greensboro for the first time.  There's mountains here.  Prabhupada Village is a devotee community in Sandy Ridge.  Everyone's a devotee, and they're building a nice little temple.  Mother Phalini and Haripada Prabhu have a nice little house and a cow and two sheep.  Their children are very nice and very devotional, and they have a beautiful altar with lovely Deities, Gaura-Nitai and Radha Vinod from Vrndavan.  It's a wonderful peaceful atmosphere and even in the rain the landscape is beautiful.  Unfortunately, I'm freezing.   I slept from 10:30PM to 2:18AM last night, and the sweater was finally FINISHED at 6:30 this morning.  Talk about cutting it close.  Gurudeva got tied up with the plane, and he arrived with Sri Prahlad and his wife Rukmini-priya dd, and a girl named Varshana that is traveling with them this week (like me).  They went straight to the temple, and by the time I got there 10 minutes later kirtan was in full swing.  It went on very ecstatically for about an hour and a half when a spontaneous play erupted about Lord Caitanya's pastimes with the Kazi, who was trying to stop the harinam sankirtan (chanting of Hare Krishna).  Sri Prahlad was the Kazi and Gurudeva played the part of Lord Caitanya.  I must say that when he was reciting the lines, I was pretty blown away.  (Devotees, you can imagine your SG saying "I am the incarnation for this age.. ") and anyway, we were all the villagers and it was really amazing, Jagai and Madhai were saved and in the end the Kazi forbid anyone to disrupt the sankirtan.  Jai!    We went back to the house and Gurudeva took prasadam, and then we all went to sleep, except me, who stayed up chanting most of the night.  I made a vow to chant 32 rounds every day he was here.  I ended up falling asleep sitting up.    In the morning, Varshana and I were up first and got ready.  It's still raining, and cold as can be.  We went to a nice morning program at Vatsala's house.  He has Prabhupada's mrdunga.  The room was tiny but everything was very sweet.  Afterwards we all took prasadam, fresh homemade waffles and fruit salad, and went back to the house to take a little rest and chant before it was time to go to Greensboro.  The sky cleared up a little as we were getting to Greensboro.  There was harinam scheduled at UNC, but it was very windy and still cold, so there weren't many people.  We then went to St. Mary's House, which is a little church, and Gurudeva gave a nice talk.  A lot of people showed up, we had nice prasadam (Apurva is the BEST cook) and the kirtan was exceptionally ecstatic.  I personally was pretty fired up and really enjoyed distributing prasadam to the nondevotees who came to the program.  Gurudev is positively effulgent when he preaches.  You can see how much he really enjoys it and how it lights him up.  He even looks 20 years younger.  After the program, we drove back to Udayananda's house in Graham.  We had a little kirtan and then went to take rest.  I fell asleep sitting up again, in the middle of a round chanting, at about 1 AM, and was up with my rounds done at 2:20, figuring, why bother going back to sleep now?   urlLink      urlLink ');"> postCount(' ');

      Arrived to Hillsborough to find that I'd been completely left out of the communication loop.  No one thought to tell me Gurudeva's schedule, and as a result I'm lost.  He's going straight to Sandy Ridge from the airport.  After a frantic phonecall to Mother Phalini I secured a place to sleep, which, by the way, is where Gurudeva's staying.  So, even better.  I've never been to Sandy Ridge before, but it's about 100 miles further northwest from Hillsborough, past Greensboro by 45 minutes or so.  Tonight I'm staying in the guest house at the temple, and working like mad on the sweater.     urlLink      urlLink ');"> postCount(' ');

      The blog's gonna be thin for the next week or so as Gurudeva will finally be here.  I am about at Defcon 4 running around like a lunatic trying to get everything together.  The Vyasapuja book is practically ready for me to take it to Alphagraphics (should be ready in 20-30 mins), the sweater has 5" to go, and I have to buy videotape, film, and batteries, and pack, and clean out the Jeep.  I got an email from the temple saying he would be giving programs there on Thursday and Friday.  I wonder where we're going the rest of the week.  And I say that because no matter where he goes, unless I'm specifically uninvited, I'm tagging along.  I haven't been in a state of hysteria for the last four months for nothing.  I will keep good notes while I'm gone and probably when I come back I'll spend a couple of days making posts for each of the days I was gone.  I promise to write everything down, as I know from experience that if I don't, I'll forget a lot.  And there'll be pictures, too, this year, so that'll be great.  Chant Hare Krishna and be happy!   urlLink      urlLink ');"> postCount(' ');

      I'm exhausted, wrung out, drug out and beat down.  Purely physiological.. has nothing to do with work.  But it makes it hard to crawl out of bed some days.  Of course, my friend Greg today posted about a woman in Mexico who actually performed a c-section on herself with a kitchen knife and three shots of cheap whiskey, and delivered a full-term, viable infant.  So not only does this raise the bar for the rest of us to shut up and get over it, it now means that HMOs will probably be changing their policies to make this sort of thing mandatory.  You get an allowance for a pint of whiskey, but you have to provide your own knife.  Last night was the full moon.  I hope tonight's a little quieter.

      I read today on Discovery.com that they've found proof that Roman gladiators were vegetarians.  Actually, a lot of scientific studies have been done on athletes regarding vegetarianism, and they've found that athletes who were vegetarians had more stamina and shorter recovery times than non-vegetarians.  I decided to get rid of the tagboard and go back to just a comments section because I think I like the look of the site better without the tagboard.  But I still want people to leave comments :)  Thank you for participating in the Tagboard Experiment.    Today is back to work day.  I work three in a row and then it's vacation and Gurudeva's visit, at long last.  Can you imagine?  And after that, who knows? We are researching the possibility of me taking a travel assignment up near Hillsborough.   urlLink      urlLink ');"> postCount(' ');

      Today had to be the windiest day of the year to date and we were in the windiest part of it.  We actually took the top off the tent to keep it from launching.  I ended up getting quite a sunburn on my face, but in reality I spent the whole day freezing.  I did, however, being the bright girl that I am, wear more clothes than I did yesterday.  Today I wore my favourite brown cotton sari, with lots of warm extras underneath.  A woman in a salwar kameez (this is the outfit you see Indian women wearing, with the long top and the pants underneath) and a dupatta (long scarf) wrapped around her head came up to me and asked me if I was Indian.  I replied I wasn't, and then after a protracted conversation with my friend Krishnapriya in Hindi, turned back to me and told me I was in fact Indian, as she had seen me yesterday in a salwar kameez and today in a sari, and then she told me she was from Pakistan, and very gently suggested to me that I cover my head, 'because it's good.'  Well, it was far too windy for me to try wrapping a wool chaddar (scarf) around my head, but I appreciated her sentiment, and I guess I look Indian enough to fool the Pakistanis if not the Indians.    I also had a further chance to hone my fashion sense and do some further consideration on the whole hip hugger thing.  I'm not sure how to lay out my thoughts in an easy-to-follow format, so I'll try using bullet points.   -Marines : get out of the street clothes and dress uniforms and back in the fatigues.  Just trust me on this one.  Also, if they give you a choice, always go for the black boots, not the brown.   -Big women : just say no to clunky shoes and miniskirts.  Cellulite on calves and ankles is a definite sign that long skirts and pants should take precedence over the miniskirts and the shorts.  Also, no tattoos on the small of your back.. you know, between the fat rolls.  Really, ladies.  Yuck.   -Mullets:  bad for men, suicidal for women.  - Always learn how to walk  successfully in your platform heels/Candies/stilettos before you go out.  Otherwise you look remarkably like an old woman recovering from simultaneous hip, knee, and back surgery.   -If you're selfconscious  about the length of your skirt, it's too short.  - Dressing like a man  does not make fat go away.  It just makes you look fat and butchy.   -Men and flip flops : dangerous ground few can tread.  If your name isn't Biff and you're not carrying a surfboard, reconsider, man, before you do it.  - Microwave tans  are just not all that sexy.  You just look leathered.   -The "Joey Ramone" look is NOT for women.   To emphasise the seriousness of this, I include for your consideration photographs of the Late Great Joey Ramone.  And I love Joey Ramone, and I'm all for tributes, but girls, wear a button or a t shirt instead of trying to go for the whole look.  And if you have a friend who's heading this way, cut them off at the pass.  Do it for them.  Do it for us.         -In one positive note , I saw a guy wearing what appeared to be a kilt made of olive drab fatigue material, with matching green socks folded neatly over the tops of his black combat boots, and a black t shirt.  You'd think this would have been a nightmare, but he pulled it off quite nicely.  I am not narrowminded about fashion.  To conclude my chapter on fashion, let's recap the whole hip hugger thing.  The problem with hip huggers is that women have hips.  It's okay to have hips.  But when you hug those hips, all that fat that women have on their hips (unless you're completely anorexic or completely toned, and even then, you've got fat) gets squeezed out.  Also, even on skinny girls, there's a belly there that gets squeezed out when the hip huggers go on.  The result is kind of reminscent of a sausage.  Or an older man with a belly who INSISTS his pants are the same size they were in 1958.  You know what I mean?  So in conclusion on the whole hip-hugger thing, I'd have to say that unless you're under 100 lbs, or you have hips like a sixth grade boy, don't do it.  I got some lovely henna on my hand, and we also distributed some books, including Bhagavad gita.  So despite the wind and the sunburn and the general financial failure, in many ways the event was a success.  Hare Krishna.

      I spent all day today helping a friend at the Azalea Festival.  This is Wilmington's premier event of the year.  It has about a 60 year tradition and draws over 100,000 people.  Since we were there all day, I got to see the parade and do a lot of people watching in between keeping the wind from launching our tent.  Since I really don't go out a lot, especially to places where people are (like the mall), I saw a lot of stuff today that I haven't seen before, and since I'm me, I have comments.  But first let's discuss the parade.  I consider myself uniquely qualified to judge a parade.  I've participated in hundreds upon hundreds over a ten year period, all over the Northeast.  Let me tell you, they don't do a parade in NC the way they do it in NY.  A New York parade is all about the firemen.  The boys spend all day starching their uniforms and Armor-Alling the trucks, and put on their nice white gloves and march.  Every town's volunteer fire department marches, each with a hired band or fife/drum/bugle corps to provide their music.  All the trucks are in the parade (you should see the mess when someone has a fire during parade time).  There's very little besides the firemen-a couple of floats, perhaps, and some clowns, but it's all about the bands, the trucks, and the boys.  At the end is a fair (carnival) and a 'bullpen' for the parade participants with free food, and all the firemen get rip roaring drunk.  Today's parade was NOT about the firemen.  It was a lot about pageant queens.  Beauty pageants are hot business here in the south.  Everyone with a cause has a pageant and a queen, and a parade brings every last one of them out.  You got your Little Teen Miss Pecan Harvest, your Shrimp Queen, Pecan Queen, Pecan Princess, Watermelon Queen/Princess/Little Miss/Ambassador.. you got your Little Miss North Brunswick County.  You name the event, you got a queen and her whole court to go with it.  And each of these little darlings, even the four year olds, get a crown and a convertible Corvette to ride on (they perch precariously on the roof and wave).  Without going into my whole aversion to the Jon Benet mentality, let me just say that I hate the whole pageant thing, and this parade had far too much of them.  Then you have your religious floats and groups.  There were about a dozen of these.  You'd never see THAT in NY.   There were some nice things about the parade-I quite enjoyed the old cars (I enjoy anything with an old car in it) and the Saddle Clubs, some of which performed quite nicely.  I like horses.  The horses didn't like the parade much.  There were three Saddle Clubs, two of which were immaculately dressed and one of which looked like a group of refugees from the Beverly Hillbillies.  The only thing I didn't like was the fact that they were (all three of them) racially segregated.  I might very well have been the only person who noticed it and almost positively the only person there who cared, but that sort of thing still rubs me wrong.   I saw some llamas pulling a cart.  I never knew they could be used as draft animals, if a cart counts as a draft animal.  There were various little groups of children in shorts  to which I paid little attention beyond remembering my friend Greg's recent post about parades.  You'll have to go to his site to dig up his post, but let me say after watching this parade, I agree wholeheartedly with everything he said.  As a side note, knock-knees and shorts don't exactly mix.  Then you have your dance schools.  The only ones of these I like are the cloggers.  Clogging, if you've never seen it, is sort of like a redneck Irish step dancing, but I like it anyway.  Don't let me forget at least a dozen JROTC groups, all of which I hope learn how to march decently before the graduate highschool.  Rolling Thunder was there, impressive as always with their drill team (they look very nice in their outfits.. do you call them uniforms?) and this year the Shriners forfeited their cute little cars for a little choo choo train that looked like a runaway from Mr. Rogers' Neighbourhood.  It was cute.  I bypassed the rest of the parade.. mostly because I was really, really sick of the pageant girls.  I will make one comment about the few highschool bands I saw: they all sounded better than they looked.  None of them could march or keep a line worth a flip.  On to people watching, and Mr. Blackstone, who makes comments about fashion.  Let me share with you some fashion truths I learned today.  Disclaimer: I am not, nor have I ever been or claimed to be, fashionable.  However.  A blind person could have spotted the following fashion faux pas at 100 yards in the fog:  1.  Anyone more than 10 pounds overweight should not wear hiphuggers with short shirts.  The belly is not meant to hang over the pants, people.  There's nothing sexy about that.    2. Hip huggers ought to be outlawed.  They look like crap on just about everyone.  They make your butt look big, create love handles even if you don't have any, and they just look dumb.  And flare legs were bad the FIRST time around.  3.  Hot pink stiletto-heel boots go with NOTHING.  4.  It will never, ever be fashionable to have 3" of dark roots to your blonde hair.  5.  "Goth" is  supposed  to be anorexic.  Trust me, when you're pushing 275 pounds, it doesn't look 'Goth'.. it just looks bad.  6. Blue nailpolish: no.   7. Kudos to the Amish, who never compromise their fashion principles regardless of their social environment.  I really liked the lady's pinafore, too.  I would have bought it if she'd have sold it to me.  And the bonnet.  Go on, laugh.  I liked the bonnet.  7. The rest of you little tramps, put some friggin clothes on.  I saw girls today wearing skirts that were barely underwear.  It was about 40 with the wind chill.  They just looked stupid, and if I was their mother.. okay... I'm going to stop here and just breathe for a bit.  8.  And if you ARE their mother, shame on you for how YOU look.  I saw you, and no wonder they dress like that.  You've set them a crappy example.  All in all though, it was a pretty good day.   urlLink

      So my mom calls me today to tell me about her doctor's visit.  This is a doctor I know personally and have actually worked with on several occasions, so my responses and reactions are based on actual first hand knowledge of this person, and my experience as a nurse.  MOM: "So I went to see Dr.X.. you know, he reminds me of an unmade bed."  ME: (hysterical laughter, because that's JUST what he looks like) "I saw him last night.  And this morning as a matter of fact."  MOM: "And who dresses him? That tie was awful."  ME: "OKOK, so tell me what happened."  So Mom proceeds to tell me that the good Doctor wants her to start on Lipitor (a cholesterol reducing medication) because her total cholesterol is 240.  Now, that's not all that high.  OK, it's elevated, but not hysterically so, and then she tells me her LDL (bad cholesterol) is in the 130's (not so terribly bad) and her HDL (good cholesterol) is 69, which is incredibly good.  So I ask if he's mentioned changing her diet.  Well, she says, I asked him, but he said no, no need.  Now I go ballistic.  How can a physician prescribe a cholesterol lowering medication that requires monitoring (read: follow up visits) without also prescribing lifestyle changes?!  We go into a long, protracted discussion of diet, and she is absolutely not going on any Lipitor after a lengthy effort at bringing the cholesterol down through diet modification.  (Remind me later to go on again about a vegetarian diet.)  Then she tells me she had a bone density scan.  All right, whatever.  By now I am totally irate about the Lipitor thing.  She reads me the rest of her labs, which are fine.  He wants her to have a stress test.  Why?  Did she have an EKG?  Yes.  Was it normal?  Well, he wasn't really happy with it.  What does THAT mean?  Well, she doesn't know.  Now I'm completely flipped out.  My mother is a staff officer in the Coast Guard Auxiliary.  She wears those Mustang suits and goes out towing boats and running patrols and doing whatever it is they do.. she's in pretty good shape overall.  She knows she needs to quit smoking.  My dad (who is also in the CGA) needs to quit too.  Anyway, I told her if she was really motivated to do the stress test, fine, but that I didn't think it was really necessary.  She has no cardiac history, her blood pressure is fine, and she has no cardiac related symptoms even on exertion.  I told her I want her to get a new doctor.   So.  This is what it's about.. the fleecing of America.  Start people on medication without even attempting to remedy the actual cause of the problem.  Then they require followup and further intervention because of the medication you've started them on.  All this when all the people really needed to do was eat oatmeal and cut out the eggs.  And then it just spirals out of control.. more tests, more interventions, more expensive followups.  People begin to feed into it.. they read volumes into every little pain and twitch, and run to the doctor for everything, looking for more medications and more pills.  By the time they're 70 (if it takes that long) people are taking ten or more different medicines a day.  All this costs a fortune, and feeds into the enormous glut of insurance profits and pharmaceutical profits and needless doctor visits.  Can you tell how angry I am?  This is all dead wrong, people.  Get educated.  Too many people equate doctors with Gods.  Too many doctors equate themselves with Gods.  Get educated, and don't look to medication as a first resort if there is another way to intervene.  Look at lifestyle changes-they are cheaper, healthier, have fewer side effects, and contribute to overall well being.  Don't get sucked in by the hype.     urlLink

      I've begun a new program to get me back reading the way I ought to be.  Every day I am reading two verses of the Bhagavad Gita.  Just two verses, therefore no excuses for not doing it.  Please join me.   urlLink You can read the Bhagavad Gita for free right at this website.   Today's reading is Chapter 1, texts 3-4.  Feel free to leave comments about any realisations, etc.  Getting into the scriptures on a routine daily basis is definitely part of a strong spiritual life.  It's easy to get caught up in material nonsense and get away from it.  This is my effort towards adding some discipline to my life and refocusing my priorities, so I hope you join me.   urlLink

Because if I don't stop and remember it, then I'll get all caught up in what's around me, and I'll feel like I do this morning.  So here's a picture of my Gurudeva, who is very, very high on my list of what's really important.      urlLink

      A Lot of What’s Best about America is ... SOCIALIST  Democratic socialists are vocal in our defense of all Americans (including those with whom we disagree). In our opposition to despotism, totalitarianism and exploitation, we can lay legitimate claim to the American Revolution of 1776. Just as the early American revolutionists believed that the welfare of the people could not be served by a corrupt monarchy, so we believe that the long-term well being of the people of the United States (and the world) canot be best served by capitalism. Unlike the early American revolutionists, we do not limit the involvement in our movement to men of wealth, and we do not advocate taking up arms against the government. Like these early revolutionists, democratic socialists will be successful in one day.  Socialism = Social Security The Social Security program was created long after the Socialist Party proposed the idea in 1901. In those days, retirement and death were often one in the same. A civilized society doesn’t throw old people away if they can no longer work, but supports, respects, and values them. That’s socialist.  Socialism = Job Safety “Safety First.” Sound familiar? It should. But you might not know that it is the motto of the United Mine Workers Union — a union that Socialist Party member Mary Harris “Mother” Jones helped organize. Back in those days, miners supported the roof of a coal mine with their own wood, on their own time. Now you have the right to a safe workplace. That’s socialist.  Socialism = Equal Rights The Socialist Party was calling for equal rights for African-Americans as early as 1932 — long before equal rights became acceptable to the Democrats or Republicans. When black and white sharecroppers banded together in the first biracial labor union, Socialist H.L. Mitchell organized it. In World War II, when U.S. citizens were put in concentration camps, just for having Japanese ancestors, the Socialist Party raised its voice in opposition while the Democrats and Republicans kept silent. When Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. made his famous “I Have A Dream” speech, he shared the platform with two prominent Socialists: African-American labor leader A. Philip Randolph, and Socialist presidential candidate Norman Thomas. When San Francisco dockworkers refused to unload a South African freighter in 1985, socialist and labor activist Bill Edwards organized the action. A civilized society has equal opportunity for all. That’s socialist.  Socialism = Family Farms A family farm is owned by the people that work it, not by some corporate shareholder who has never seen the place. A family farmer conserves soil because the future is as important as today. That’s socialist.  Socialism = Peace Socialists have long opposed senseless killing. Union activist Eugene V. Debs, Socialist organizer Kate Richards O’Hare, and many others were jailed for speaking out against World War I. War creates profits for the wealthy people who make bombs and guns. War has created more than half of the national debt that is bankrupting this country. War kills children, animals, and other living things. Decent societies prevent war. That’s socialist.  Socialism = Full Employment Business needs high unemployment, because the more desperate unemployed people there are, the lower business can force wages. In a healthy society, every able person has meaningful work and no one is discarded. That’s socialist.  Socialism = Public Education People need to be educated if they are to participate in self-government. A free society provides equal education for all, not poor education for the poor and decent for the rich. Educated children build the future. That’s socialist.  Socialism = Health Care Of the industrialized nations, only the United States continues to deny their people universal health care. Access to health care is as much a basic human right as the right to vote — and just as necessary for democracy. That’s socialist.  Socialism = Democracy Socialists support political and economic democracy. We think that a democratically run economy is just as necessary as political democracy. Working people should have a genuine say in the day to day economic decisions, which directly affect their lives — in their workplaces, schools, institutions, and communities. That’s socialist.  Don’t believe it? Take a look... “The strongest bond of human sympathy, outside of the family relation, should be one of uniting all working people of all nations, tongues and kindreds.” — Abraham Lincoln   urlLink

      The description of Nirjala Ekadasi, which occurs during the month of May/June, is found in the Brahma-vaivarta Purana in the conversation between Vyasadeva and Bhimasena.  Once Bhimasena, the younger brother of Yudhisthira, inquired from the great sage Srila Vyasadeva, "O most learned and worshipable grandfather, please hear my request. My elder brother Yudhisthira, mother Kuntidevi, brothers Arjuna, Nakula and Sahadeva, and Draupadi do not eat anything on the day of Ekadasi. They, especially yudhisthira, always tell me that I should also fast on Ekadasi. But I always them that though I know that to fast on Ekadasi is an injunction of the scriptures, I cannot bear my hunger and therefore I am unable to fast. I can give in charity as per my capacity, I can worship Lord Kesava with proper rules and regulations, but I cannot fast. So please instruct me how can I obtain the result of Ekadasi without having to fast."  On hearing these words of Bhimasena, Sri Vyasadeva said, "O Bhima! If you want to go to the heavenly planets and avoid the hellish planets, then you must refrain from eating on both the Ekadasis of each month."  Bhima said, "O great sage! It is impossible for me to observe fast on 24 Ekadasis every year, as instructed by the Lord. What to speak of fasting day and night I cannot even tolerate my hunger for even a moment. The fire of hunger known as ‘brika’ is always present within my stomach, and it is extinguished only by voracious eating. But with great endeavor I can fast only one day in a year. Therefore please instruct me about a vow that I can follow to attain auspiciusness both in this life and the next."  Sri Vyasadeva said, "O King! You have already heard from me about the Vedic religious principles and the duties of the human beings. But in this age of Kali not everyone is capable of following those rules and regulations. Therefore I will tell you abouty a sublime method by which you can achieve great results. This method is the essence of all the Puranas. Anyone who observes the Ekadasis of waning and waxing moons by fasting never goes to hell.  Hearing Vyasadeva’s words, that strongest warrior Bhimasena became frightened and shivered like a leaf on the banyan tree and said, “O grandfather! What should I do? I am totally unable to fast twice a month throughout the year Therefore, O my Lord, kindly instruct me about one vow that awards the most merit and how byh observing it I can achieve all benefits."  Then Sri Vyasadeva replied, "The Ekadasi which occurs during the waxing moon in the month of May/June during the sun’s presence in either Taurus or Gemini Rasi is called Nirjala Ekadasi. One should observe total fast even from drinking wter in this Ekadasi. On this day one should perform acamana for purification by drinking that amount of water in which a single mustard seed or a drop of gold can be immersed. One should place the said amount of water in his palm held in such as way as to resemble a cow’s ear. If one drinks more or less water than this, it will amount to drinking of wine.  "One must not eat anything at all on this Ekadasi, otherwise his vow will be broken. One should not drink even water from the movement of sunrise from the day of Ekadasi until the sunrise on the day of Dvadasi. In this way if one strictly observes this Ekadasi without drinking water then he can attain the results of observing all the Ekadasis of the year.  "In the early morning on the day of Dvadasi one should take bath and give gold and water in charity to the brahmanas. Thereafter the follower should gladly eat with the brahmanas.  "O Bhimsena! Now please hear about the piety one accumulates by observing this Ekadasi. By following this Ekadasi one can achieve the result of following all the Ekadasis throughout the year. Once Lord Visnu, who holds a conch, a disc, a club and a lotus flower in His hand, told me, ‘If a person gives up all varieties of religion and surrenders unto Me and follows this Nirjala Ekadasi which is very dear to Me, he is certainly relieved of all sinful reactions. One cannot attain the supreme destination by giving wealth in charity or attain any benefit by following smarta rules and regulations in the Kali-yuga. In fact, the Vedic religious principles have been extinct in this age of Kali, which is polluted with various faults.  "O son of Vayu! What more can I tell you? Eating is actually prohibited on all the Ekadasis, and even the drinking of water is prohibited on Nirjala Ekadasi. By observing this Ekadasi one achieves the piety of visiting all the holy places. At the time of death such a person is not approached by the fierce-looking Yamdutas, rather he is approached by the divine looking Visnudutas to be transferred to the abode of Visnu. If one gives water and cows in charity after observing this Ekadasi then he is freed from all his sinful activities."  When the other Pandavas heard about the glories of this Ekadasi they resolved to observe it. From that day onward Bhimasena began observing this Nirjala Ekadasi, which became famous as Pandava Nirjala, or Bhimseni Ekadasi. By following this Ekadas sinful activities as huge as Sumeru or Mandra Mountain are at once burnt to ashes. O King! Lord Krsna has declared that any pious activities such as taking bath in holy places, giving charity, chanting Vedic mantras, and performing sacrifices that are carried out on this Nirjala Ekadasi day become inexhaustible.  One who reads or hears the glories of this Ekadasi with devotion goes back to the abode of Vaikuntha. The result one attains by observing the vow of Amavasya conjoined with Pratipada and offering oblations to the forefathers during the solar eclipse is attained simply by hearing the glories of this Ekadasi.

      Well, it's been hot as forty hells all week this week.  But even with that, summer never truly 'arrives' for me until the day I have watermelon for breakfast.  Today's the day. And is it ever sweet, juicy, and cold.  When I was a kid, I hated watermelon.  But nowadays, it's the best thing I can think of for breakfast on a hot summer day. (I eat breakfast at 4PM.  Didn't you know that?)  I went to that meeting this morning.  I think it was basically one of these 'what's wrong with your job' fantasy things.  Just to give you an idea of how nurses are in general: the facilitator of the meeting said at one point, "Of all the things you mentioned, none are your own needs.  You're so wrapped up in everything else, can't you identify some needs for you?"  And that's the problem with nurses.  So I'm going today on just a few hours of sleep, but that's all right too, because I have 5 days off after this.  We have a lot to do with getting the house ready.  I think I'll spend at least two of those days packing.  If I can get someone to go with me this year, I'd like to go to the Toronto Rathayatra.  I would love to go see Their Lordships (I posted a picture of Them recently, so scroll down if you missed Them.)  Toronto is a LONG way away, but it'd be worth it, I think, so I'm hoping to be able to go.  In other news, the diet continues.  Nothing's really changed, though, so I haven't posted anything about it.  I'm hoping that at some near-future moment I'll get on the scale and will have dropped another five pounds, but it hasn't happened yet.  And  urlLink here's an interesting article  in which they try to claim Michelangelo had autism.   urlLink

      Cape Fear won't waive the twelve-month requirement on transfers, despite the fact that I got permission from my director (not my manager, my director) to transfer after six months.  It's not like I signed up to do something and then changed my mind.. the unit was changed out under me.  Can I help it if I don't like cardiac?  So I'm going to look at 4 South and go from there.. in the meantime, we can call this motivation to get the hell out of Dodge.  Aggravated? Yes.  Hysterically so?  No.  Everything happens for a reason, even when I can't come up with the reason it might have happened.  Also, I got a call asking me to stay over til like 11 in the morning for some meeting.  Of course I have to work tomorrow night.  Will I be staying over?  Probably.    I promise you this.. I will never be taking any kind of management position again, regardless of the money, benefits, perks, or anything else.  My life is too important to be messing it up with work.  Priorities, people.. priorities.   urlLink

      I went to Sam's this morning.  This was fun as I don't go often and have never gone by myself before.  It's so appealing to buy things in enormous packages, for some reason.  Unfortunately, there's just two of us, and I, as you know, am on  urlLink this diet  so really, what would be the point?  Anyway I exercised nearly painful restraint but still managed to spend the better part of $200 in there.  Had a long talk with Meredith from American Mobile, who is not nearly as perky as LISA!!!!!!!!!!!! from Preferred.  American Mobile seems a bit more high-pressure, but on the other hand, they have a better housing package, at least for the job she talked me into looking closely (read: applying for) at.  We'll see what all happens.  It's not the military.. I can back out at any given moment until I write my name in blood in that big black book.  Good grief it's hot out.  Is the whole summer going to be this way?  I'm going to have to start looking at the hurricane forecasts early if this is going to keep up.  I got invited to Panihati in Atlanta and also to the NYC Rathayatra with my friend Jayasri dd, but I can't go, because I have to work.  Unless I can get someone to switch with me.. yeah, right.  I'd love to go to Rathayatra though.. we'll see what Krishna has in store for me.  Chant and be happy.  Gurudeva said: "Give your heart and soul to the Holy Names."  So go do it already.   urlLink

      You may or may not have noticed the "Iraq Body Count" banner in the sidebar of the blog.  Here's some background info on it.  The IRAQ BODY COUNT Project  This is a human security project to establish an independent and comprehensive public database of media-reported civilian deaths in Iraq resulting directly from military action by the USA and its allies in 2003. In the current occupation phase this database includes all deaths which the Occupying Authority has a binding responsibility to prevent under the Geneva Conventions and Hague Regulations. This includes civilian deaths resulting from the breakdown in law and order, and deaths due to inadequate health care or sanitation. Results and totals are continually updated and made immediately available on this page and on various IBC counters which may be freely displayed on any website, where they will be automatically updated without further intervention. Casualty figures are derived solely from a comprehensive survey of online media reports. Where these sources report differing figures, the range (a minimum and a maximum) are given. All results are independently reviewed and error-checked by at least three members of the Iraq Body Count project team before publication.  The project takes as its starting point and builds upon the earlier work of Professor Marc Herold who has produced the most comprehensive tabulation of civilian deaths in the war on Afghanistan from October 2001 to the present, and the methodology has been designed in close consultation with him.  Professor Herold commented: “I strongly support this initiative. The counting of civilian dead looms ever more importantly for at least two reasons: military sources and their corporate mainstream media backers seek to portray the advent of precision guided weaponry as inflicting at most, minor, incidental civilian casualties when, in truth, such is is not the case; and the major source of opposition to these modern ‘wars’ remains an informed, articulate general public which retains a commitment to the international humanitarian covenants of war at a time when most organized bodies and so-called ‘experts’ have walked away from them”.   Rationale:  Adversities such as wars and civil wars threaten the survival and dignity of millions of people. The victims of these conflicts are primarily, if not almost exclusively, civilians - ordinary men and women. Civilian casualties are the most unacceptable consequence of all wars. Each civilian death is a tragedy and should never be regarded as the “cost” of achieving our countries’ war aims, because it is not we who are paying this price. One in four killed in the US war on Afghanistan were civilians, and in Yugoslavia the proportion was even higher. We believe it is a moral and humanitarian duty for each such death to be recorded, publicised, given the weight it deserves and, where possible, investigated to establish whether there are grounds for criminal proceedings.  Traditionally, security threats were examined in the context of "state security", i.e. the protection of the state, its boundaries, people, institutions and values from external attacks. States set up powerful military systems to defend themselves. People were considered to be assured of their security through the protection extended by the state. Recent history, however, shows that the states as "protector of people" frequently come to play ineffective if not adversarial roles. They showed no serious interest in documenting and investigating the civilian deaths and their causes. The governments of victor states certainly have almost no interest in doing this during the conduct of military campaigns. Proponents of “modern” warfare also make much of the claim that their weapons are “smart” or “precision guided.” Civilian deaths give the lie to such claims. Recent examples demonstrate that no air-launched weapon can avoid civilian deaths.  The UN Secretary-General has called the world community to advance a new human-centred approach to these problems. As a contribution to this effort, the Commission on Human Security (CHS) first met in New York in June 2001 and held its second meeting in Tokyo in December 2001. The Iraq Body Count project is a direct response to this agenda of Human Security.   The Iraq Body Count project aims to promote public understanding, engagement and support for the human dimension in wars by providing a reliable and up-to-date documentation of civilian casualties in the event of a US-led war in 2003 in the country. The duty of ‘recorder’ falls particularly heavily on the ordinary citizens of those states whose military forces cause the deaths. In the current crisis, this responsibility must be borne predominantly by citizens of the USA and the UK.  It is accepted that war causes many dire consequences for the civilian population even if they are not directly killed or injured in military strikes. They may suffer long-term injury or illness (as a result, for instance of radiation, post-conflict contact with unexploded munitions, pollution due to spillage of toxic materials). UN estimates suggest that a war in Iraq would create starvation and homelessness for millions. A widely-leaked UN report on the humanitarian consequences of a US-led war in Iraq has estimated that the conflict would create two million refugees. (BBC News, 28 January, 2003, 07:38 GMT) People may suffer deep psychological trauma, miscarriage, bereavement, dislocation, and loss of home and property. Destruction of civil infrastructure can have effects which last for generations. These factors undoubtedly cause many further deaths. However, documenting and assigning responsibility for such effects requires long-term “on the ground” resources. Immediate deaths and injuries through military strikes can be pinpointed in place and time, and responsibility straightforwardly attributed to the weapon that caused the death or injury.  This project aims to record single-mindedly and on a virtually real-time basis one key and immutable index of the fruits of war: the death toll of innocents. The full extent of this has often gone unnoticed until long after a war has ended, if at all. One reason is that reports of incidents where civilians have been killed are scattered in different news sources and spread over time: one or two killed here, a few dozen there, with only major incidents (such as the attack on the Al-Amariyah bomb shelter where hundreds of women, children and elderly were incinerated alive) being guaranteed headline coverage. But the smaller numbers quickly add up: and however many civilians are killed in the onslaught on Iraq, their death toll should not go unnoticed by those who are paying — in taxes — for their slaughter. It is to these all too easily disregarded victims of violence that Iraq Body Count is dedicated, and we are resolute that they, too, shall have their memorials.  Methodology:  1. Overview  Casualty figures are derived from a comprehensive survey of online media reports and eyewitness accounts. Where these sources report differing figures, the range (a minimum and a maximum) are given. All results are independently reviewed and error-checked by at least two members of the Iraq Body Count project team in addition to the original compiler before publication.  2.

      We drove up to Roxboro today.  After wandering about a bit, we're kind of settled on the Bahama (pronounced Bah HAY Mah.. this is North Carolina, folks)/Timberlake/Rougemont area.. between Durham and Roxboro.    It's a really nice area, very quiet and secluded.  Probably in the near future we'll be going back to do some more research.  Where we're interested is about fifteen/twenty miles from Durham, and about the same distance from the temple.  It just seems to be exactly what we're looking for.  I found a house I really liked, but Scott said absolutely NO WAY, and you know how he can be, so I hushed, and we'll keep looking.   urlLink

      The Nectar of Devotion is an incredibly beautiful book.  I generally only post quotes from Bhagavad-gita, but today I thought I'd share this with you.  I could have gone on and on, but I'm just posting a taste.  If you have any questions or would like to get a copy of this incredible book, please  urlLink email me  and let me know how I can help you.   In Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, Third Canto, Twenty-ninth Chapter, verses 12 and 13, Śrīla Kapiladeva, while instructing His mother, has given the following characteristics of pure devotional service: "My dear mother, those who are My pure devotees, and who have no desire for material benefit or philosophical speculation, have their minds so much engaged in My service that they are never interested in asking Me for anything — except to be engaged in that service. They do not even beg to live in My abode with Me."  There are five kinds of liberation, namely to become one with the Lord, to live with the Supreme Lord on the same planet, to have the same features as the Lord, to enjoy the same opulences as the Lord and to live as a companion of the Lord. A devotee, what to speak of rejecting material sense gratification, does not even want any of the five kinds of liberation. He is satisfied simply by discharging loving service to the Lord. That is the characteristic of pure devotion.  In the above statement by Kapiladeva from Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, the actual position of a pure devotee is described, and the primary characteristics of devotional service are also defined. Further characteristics of devotional service are described by Rūpa Gosvāmī with evidences from different scriptures. He states that there are six characteristics of pure devotional service, which are as follows:  (1) Pure devotional service brings immediate relief from all kinds of material distress.  (2) Pure devotional service is the beginning of all auspiciousness.  (3) Pure devotional service automatically puts one in transcendental pleasure.  (4) Pure devotional service is rarely achieved.  (5) Those in pure devotional service deride even the conception of liberation.  (6) Pure devotional service is the only means to attract Kṛṣṇa.  Kṛṣṇa is all-attractive, but pure devotional service attracts even Him. This means that pure devotional service is even transcendentally stronger than Kṛṣṇa Himself, because it is Kṛṣṇa's internal potency.  Relief from Material Distress  In Bhagavad-gītā, the Lord says that one should surrender unto Him, giving up all other engagements. The Lord also gives His word there that He will protect surrendered souls from the reactions of all sinful activities. Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī says that the distresses from sinful activities are due both to the sins themselves and to sins committed in our past lives. Generally, one commits sinful activities due to ignorance. But ignorance is no excuse for evading the reaction — sinful activities. Sinful activities are of two kinds: those which are mature and those which are not mature. The sinful activities for which we are suffering at the present moment are called mature. The many sinful activities stored within us for which we have not yet suffered are considered immature. For example, a man may have committed criminal acts, but not yet been arrested for them. Now, as soon as he is detected, arrest is awaiting him. Similarly, for some of our sinful activities we are awaiting distresses in the future, and for others, which are mature, we are suffering at the present moment.  In this way there is a chain of sinful activities and their concomitant distresses, and the conditioned soul is suffering life after life due to these sins. He is suffering in the present life the results of sinful activities from his past life, and he is meanwhile creating further sufferings for his future life. Mature sinful activities are exhibited if one is suffering from some chronic disease, if one is suffering from some legal implication, if one is born in a low and degraded family or if one is uneducated or very ugly.  There are many results of past sinful activities for which we are suffering at the present moment, and we may be suffering in the future due to our present sinful activities. But all of these reactions to sinful deeds can immediately be stopped if we take to Kṛṣṇa consciousness. As evidence for this, Rūpa Gosvāmī quotes from Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, Eleventh Canto, Fourteenth Chapter, verse 19. This verse is in connection with Lord Kṛṣṇa's instruction to Uddhava, where He says, "My dear Uddhava, devotional service unto Me is just like a blazing fire which can burn into ashes unlimited fuel supplied to it." The purport is that as the blazing fire can burn any amount of fuel to ashes, so devotional service to the Lord in Kṛṣṇa consciousness can burn up all the fuel of sinful activities. For example, in the Gītā Arjuna thought that fighting was a sinful activity, but Kṛṣṇa engaged him on the battlefield under His order, and so the fighting became devotional service. Therefore, Arjuna was not subjected to any sinful reaction.  Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī quotes another verse from the Third Canto of Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, Thirty-third Chapter, verse 6, in which Devahūti addresses her son, Kapiladeva, and says, "My dear Lord, there are nine different kinds of devotional service, beginning from hearing and chanting. Anyone who hears about Your pastimes, who chants about Your glories, who offers You obeisances, who thinks of You and, in this way, executes any of the nine kinds of devotional service — even if he is born in a family of dog-eaters [the lowest grade of mankind] — becomes immediately qualified to perform sacrifices." As such, how is it possible that anyone actually engaged in devotional service in full Kṛṣṇa consciousness has not become purified? It is not possible. One who is engaged in Kṛṣṇa consciousness and devotional service has without doubt become freed from all contaminations of material sinful activities. Devotional service therefore has the power to actually nullify all kinds of reactions to sinful deeds. A devotee is nevertheless always alert not to commit any sinful activities; this is his specific qualification as a devotee. Thus Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam states that by performing devotional service a person who was born even in a family of dog-eaters may become eligible to take part in the performance of the ritualistic ceremonies recommended in the Vedas. It is implicit in this statement that a person born into a family of dog-eaters is generally not fit for performing yajña, or sacrifice. The priestly caste in charge of performing these ritualistic ceremonies recommended in the Vedas is called the brāhmaṇa order. Unless one is a brāhmaṇa, he cannot perform these ceremonies.  A person is born in a brāhmaṇa family or in a family of dog-eaters due to his past activities. If a person is born in a family of dog-eaters it means that his past activities were all sinful. But if even such a person takes to the path of devotional service and begins to chant the holy names of the Lord — Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare/ Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare — he is at once fit to perform the ritualistic ceremonies. This means that his sinful reactions have immediately become neutralized.  It is stated in the Padma Purāṇa that there are four kinds of effects due to sinful activities, which are listed as follows: (1) the effect which is not yet fructified, (2) the effect which is lying as seed, (3) the effect which is already mature and (4) the effect which is almost mature. It is also stated that all these four effects become immediately vanquished for those who surrender unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Viṣṇu, and become engaged in His devotional service in full Kṛṣṇa consciousness.   urlLink

      In all honesty, the longer I do this diet, the easier it really gets.  I broke down and ordered the book yesterday (that's what I was doing over at Amazon when I got all into the wish list thing), so I'll finally have a clue what I'm supposed to be doing in the long haul.  I did find out I can substitute the oatmeal with whole-grain cereal, so that at least is a good thing.  Oatmeal's great, but how much of it can you eat if you don't like it to begin with?  So I spent some time in contemplation today in the cereal aisle and came up with some Kashi cereal that has like 9 grams of protein and 10 grams of fiber (and 1 gram of fat) per serving.  So maybe I can switch off day to day.  I bought myself some spinach salad too, so that will be a little bit of a change from the ordinary as well.  To make my life easier I decided that rather than deal with ALL of the weight I want to lose at once, I'm going to break it down into manageable pieces.  So for the time being, my weight-loss goal is 20 lbs, and I have 15.5 to go to meet that goal (as of today). I think I can do that.  Once I get to that goal, it'll be time for a reward.  I think what I'm going to do is hold off on that second piercing until then, and use it for a reward, and then I can re-evaluate and reset my goals again.  And just go on from there.  Seriously, I don't think it's good for me mentally to do it any other way.  It's like when you have to work four in a row-you can't think about it that way.  You have to concentrate on just twelve hours at a time, otherwise you'll be totally depressed the whole time.  Or when you give up drinking (something else I also have personal experience with), everyone knows that in AA you do it one day at a time.  Or one hour, or one minute if necessary.  You can't think about it in terms of a lifetime, or the enormity of it will kill you.  Probably the most difficult thing is exercising.  I just don't like it.  Who does?  Oh yes, I'm sure there are some freaks out there who just can't wait to go burn calories, but let's face it, folks, I'm basically a turtle.  So I will do whatever little I can every day on the stepper, whatever little bit that amounts to be, and call it good.  Eventually I'm sure the little bit will be a bigger bit.  I'm not going to get myself all fanatical about it and I refuse to beat myself up over it.  Realistically, I'm looking at a year to do what I want to do.  Optimistically, nine months.  Either way, it's all good.  I've known some folks who have had that gastric bypass operation, some with really good results and some with really catastrophic results.  For a while I was interested in having it done, but insurance companies don't like to pay for it, it costs a lot of money, and the thought of going forever without a diet Coke was kind of an ultimate sacrifice to me.  Did you know that once you have that operation you can never have carbonated drinks again?  Anyway, it really is a dangerous procedure, but the results can be stellar.  I'll be honest and admit I was jealous watching people lose 90-110 lbs after having it done.  On the other hand, there's a lot of things they can't do henceforth, and I don't know that I'd want to deal with that.  So either way, here I am, and not getting any bypass done, but trying myself to handle this problem.  I've been dealing with it literally my whole life, and I'm really hoping that this will be the answer this time.  I was getting myself into that mindset of 'when I've lost all this weight, I'm going to.." and I don't even want to go that far yet.. I just want to deal with this rationally, realistically, and consistently, until I get to where I need to be.  And my ultimate goal is a realistic one (I admit I also have a secret goal that is absolutely unrealistic, too), so hopefully everything will work out for the best.  All encouragement, motivational comments and etc. are appreciated.  Leave me a good word, will you?!   urlLink

      I've been on my diet for a week.  For those of you who don't know, this is called the Healthy Heart Miracle diet ( urlLink website )and while it is designed to lower cholesterol, it is also good for losing weight.  My cholesterol is good but the size of my butt is not, hence being on a diet.  Why did I choose this diet?  Mostly because it was a diet I felt I was capable of.  I like diets that use words like "unlimited".  Also, because being a vegetarian, the entire low-carb Atkins world is just out of reach for me.  I can't live on cheese.  Maybe I could, but my cholesterol wouldn't be 160 (which it is) when I was done.  So for the first two weeks of this diet you basically eat the following:  Breakfast: "unlimited" slow-cooked oatmeal with 1 cup of fruit and "unlimited" fat free milk Lunch/Dinner: "unlimited" salad made with at least 3 cups of greens and any kind of toppings you want: any vegetable, soy-based meat substitute, beans of any kind, up to 3 oz (daily total) of cheese or 6 oz(daily total) of shellfish, up to 1/4 cup nuts per day, and either 2 tbsp of dressing or "unlimited" low calorie dressing.  It doesn't sound very hard and quite honestly it isn't very hard to do since this is summertime.  On the other hand, I don't like oatmeal.  I like salad, but even salad is getting old.  I've been splurging buying all the stuff I don't normally buy for salads like those neat little baby corns and water chestnuts and fancy greens, but it still gets old when it's all you eat.  To be perfectly honest I have cheated on my diet a few times during the week.  No majors except when I had some fried rice, and even then I got right back on the track.  The other cheatings were when I had a cup of organic instant Thai noodle soup, and how much of a cheat is that when it's 190 calories with 1 gram of fat?  So I am not beating myself up over it.. every now and then I am going to have a little something different.    The diet does expand beyond the salad and oatmeal thing.  I haven't bought the book (yes I am cheap) so I don't know all of what I can have when the two weeks is done, but I figure, maybe I can just do this part of it for as long as possible.  It's pretty easy to stay on track when I'm working, I've found, and a lot harder when I'm home, mostly because I think I get bored.  So I am trying to be really good.   So for the first week's tallies, which include three cheats and no exercise beyond running around at work, I have lost four pounds.     That to me is kind of disappointing for a first week, but on the other hand, what's a good expectation?  So I am considering it good and hoping to possibly increase (it can't decrease) the amount of exercise I get over this coming week, and if I can maintain four pounds a week, then we can call it good.  Regardless of which diet I do, I'll be on it for a long time, so be prepared to hear about this for the foreseeable future.  In other news, if I can come up with the cash, I'll probably go get my nose re-pierced tomorrow.   urlLink

      In honour of me being on my diet for a whole week (I will post the first tallies tomorrow), here is a recipe for something I am not allowed to eat.   Also: if you want to leave a comment, click below where it says, 0 comments (which is what it usually says!)  3 medium large potatoes (peeled and cut in ½-inch cubes)  1 cup peas  ¼ cup minced fresh coriander leaves (or parsley)  1 cup bread crumbs  1 teaspoon salt  1 teaspoon black pepper  1 cup sour cream  ¼ cup ghee or oil for frying  Boil potatoes in saucepan until very tender. Mash and set aside. Steam peas and set aside.  Add spices and bread crumbs to mashed potatoes. Then add peas. Divide the mixture into 12 3-inch balls. Flatten each ball in the palms of your hands to make into patties.   In nonstick skillet heat ½ of the ghee. Fry 6 of the patties on both sides until golden (about 3 minutes on each side).   Add remaining ghee and fry remaining 6 patties.   Serve hot, with sour cream in the side.    Makes 1 dozen.    urlLink

      I'm thinking of getting my nose pierced again, mostly because the piercing I have is so high I can't put a ring in it (only screws/pins).  If I did get my nose pierced again, I'd keep the first piercing with a transparent retainer that you can't even see.  I'd really like to be able to wear a ring sometimes, and some of those cool little India screws that wrap down now and then.  What do you think?  If I do this, it'll be in the next few days, so give your opinion while you can.   urlLink

      If you're in the mood for something really nice, I can recommend a CD to you by a girl named Karnamrita.  The name of the CD is DASI.  All the songs on the album are prayers by women.  They're all in different moods and stages, but all of them are powerful.  One of my favourites is the 'Story of Pingala'.  Pingala is a prostitute who comes to some serious realisations about material existence.  It's not the same without the music, so I'll just write out the translation to the chorus.  It might not hit you the same as it hit me, but to me, it's pretty serious, deep stuff.  "I am such a fool that I have given up the service of that person who, being eternally situated within my heart, is actually most dear to me.  That most dear one is the Lord of the Universe, who is that bestower of real love and happiness and the source of all prosperity.  Although He is in my own heart, I have completely neglected Him.  Instead I have ignorantly served insignificant men who can never satisfy my real desires and who have simply brought me unhappiness, fear, anxiety, lamentation, and illusion."  And the conclusion of the song:  "With devotion I accept the great benefit that the Lord has bestowed upon me.  Having given up my sinful desires for ordinary sense gratification, I now take shelter of Him, the Supreme Lord.    I am now completely satisfied, and I have full faith in the Lord's mercy.  Therefore I will maintain myself with whatever comes of its own accord.  I shall enjoy life with only the Lord.  He is the real source of love and happiness."  And if you're wondering, "Pingala uvaca" means "Pingala said".   urlLink

      An acquaintance of mine is currently dealing with being given a diagnosis of cancer.  How do you deal with that?    We talked for a little while the other night, and basically I set myself up as a devil's advocate, finding positive things in all the negatives she came up with.  Oh yeah, you're saying, how do you find positives in cancer, and who do you think you are to be even trying to understand how someone feels with a diagnosis of cancer?  Well, for one, when I was 27, they suspected I had adrenal cancer.  It came back negative for that but positive for a whole bunch of other stuff, and I am one of these "extremely high risk" people for all kinds of reproductive cancer.  We went about two weeks thinking I did have that adrenal cancer, and I can tell you, in those two weeks, I think I learned a lot.  A lot of heavy thinking, I can tell you.  So maybe I do have a little tiny bit of understanding of what it feels like.  I think in any situation like this, you're really given an opportunity to see what it is that's actually important in your life.  Lots of cancer survivors will tell you that they actually feel that the experience was a gift-they value life and the people around them so much more now.  So what's really important?  Your faith, your family.  The people closest to you.  All the things that money can't buy.  Life is such a gift that we take for granted.  I think about all the days I've spent vegged out in front of the television watching the Snorks or something equally idiotic.  You can't get those days back, and whether you know it or not, there's a clock ticking away, somewhere, and at some point, it will all be over.  So you have to really value every single day, and get everything you can out of it.  Talk with the people you love.. not just talk, really communicate.  Hug your kids.  Understand how petty most of life's irritations are.  Put your priorities in order.    This is one of the lessons of Krishna Consciousness: to understand that material miseries are both inavoidable as long as we stay in these bodies, and also to understand that we are not these bodies.  What's really important?  Understanding who you are, and what is your eternal relationship with Krishna.  Then you can know how to put your priorities in order.  Chant the holy names, develop that relationship, and get out of this cycle of birth and death.  I was going to write a lot more on this, but things aren't flowing as smoothly as usual, so I'll leave it here.  I have to work tonight, and then I'll be off tomorrow.  I'm still trying to recover from the last onslaught (although I'm much better than I was) and I'm hoping we have a better night than the last time I worked.  Tuesday morning I have to be at that interview for the prospective manager, and I do believe I am not going to go to that class on Tuesday afternoon.  I need to just have some time off.  And then I'll be working Friday/Saturday/Sunday.  So that's my week.  Gurudeva wrote me recently, and here is a quote from that letter: "Give your heart and soul to the holy names."

      OK, I'm not ashamed to admit that I saw how a friend of mine reformatted his blog and I loved it so much I decided I wanted to get rid of the whole Barbie bubblegum thing.  So maybe I'm cheezy because I did that, but then again, imitation is the sincerest form of flattery.  At least I didn't use EXACTLY the same template..   And here's another glimpse of my week with Gurudeva.  This picture was taken up in Sandy Ridge, at the house where I stayed.

      Last night set a new benchmark for me in what defines a 'bad' night.  I think at least part of it had to do with the fact that I was exceptionally emotionally fragile because of being so tired, but the rest of it was just a new level of horror.  I got to work at six twenty to find out we had four nurses (we are fully staffed at six).  We had a nurse scheduled to come in at 11 and I was trying hard to find a way to not scatter her all over the floor and not screw up everyone else, so I ended up taking SEVEN patients (the standard is five) for the first four hours.    By nine PM, I'd taken two admissions (giving me a total of NINE patients, unheard of), had one irate patient who didn't like her noisy (sick and delirious) roommate, one irate family member who had a very legitimate complaint, and I'd gotten in a spat with the ED coordinator.  Cue tears.  I must say for the record I am not a crybaby.  In fact I'm one of the tougher nurses I know.  But there I was on the phone crying to the house supervisor between apologising for the fact I was crying.  One transferred patient, two hours, and someone going bad later, I got my ample behind chewed out for no real reason by a doctor.  Cue tears.  Another transferred patient later, I decide to eat, although I don't go to lunch.  I stand and eat my salad whilst answering questions from other nurses and assistants.  It's now about 1:10 AM.  At 4AM, I begin to chart.  I've been at work nine hours now and I'm only just beginning to document everything I've done so far.  I can't think about anything too hard at this point or I get teary.  At 6AM I announce that I will never, ever, work four twelve hour shifts in a row again.  Everyone agrees this is a wise decision.  I'm not bitchy, but I am a bit too emotionally labile.  And nobody likes seeing the coordinator cry.  At 7:28AM I clock out.  I've been at work thirteen hours.  I walk the half-mile (no exaggeration) to my car, sit in it and cry hysterically for fifteen minutes.  Then I drive home.  At 8:10AM I start dreading going back to work on Sunday night.  Everyone thinks nursing's so glamourous and that you make a lot of money and flirt with doctors all the time.  Don't believe the hype.  Sometimes, it can be the worst job on earth.  Thankfully, it's usually only that for twelve hours at a time, and once or twice a year.  I haven't had a time this bad since June of 2001.  That was the weekend I was on call and put in 44 hours in three days.  Maybe I'm good to go until 2007 now.   urlLink      urlLink ');"> postCount(' ');

      Day four and I'm kind of crispy around the edges.  I know the date, but I can't keep track of the day.  I'm hoping for an easy night tonight.  This is the point at which you just begin to get a little punchy.  I sent a very nice, very professional letter requesting permission to transfer to my director.  If all goes well and she says it's fine, I could be out of cardiac nursing in as little as six weeks.   urlLink      urlLink ');"> postCount(' ');

      Two down, two to go.  I normally only work two in a row, so this is really not going to be a whole lot of fun.  I did get some sleep today, versus yesterday, but I don't like that I'm having dreams that feature people I work with.  That just means I'm seeing them too much.  Last night we had five nurses.  I'd just about forgotten how nice it can be when you only have five patients to work with.  We are so pitiful in that respect; we're so used to working desperately short that we don't even remember how nice it is to be just a little bit short  (we are fully staffed at six nurses).    Being on a diet is actually easier at work, though.  I love to cook, and being home just means I have more time to do so.  And cooking leads to eating, and eating leads to.. well, you know what that leads to.  Anyway, I'm all fired up about being on this diet, and I am refraining from posting daily information about how much I'm losing (because I am one of those OCD people who get on the scale every day despite everything the experts say).  I'll post once a week on Mondays how much I've actually lost over the past week.  What I enjoy most about this diet, so far, is that it involves everything I CAN eat and nothing I can't (well, you are allowed up to 6 ounces of seafood a day, but it isn't mandatory), and the fact that I'm getting all exotic on my salads buying stuff I wouldn't normally buy, like those neat little baby corns and bamboo shoots and water chestnuts and so on.  And I bought two mangoes to put in with my oatmeal.  So in a way I feel like I'm splurging because these are things I wouldn't normally spend money on.  I read that some people who've followed the diet have lost a hundred pounds, so I feel pretty encouraged that I'll be able to get where I want to go here.  What I do need to resist are the million and one people who want to tell me how to diet and tell me where this diet is wrong, and modify it.  I'm doing exactly (very much exactly) what it says, and daggone it, if it says I can have unlimited oatmeal then I am going to eat oatmeal for breakfast until I'm full.  There is nothing more depressing than measuring out food, in my opinion.  It just makes you feel so deprived.  But if you just eat the right things as much as you want to, then on a psychological level you don't feel like you're being taken away from.  Dieting is really as much psychological as it is physical.  Anyway, they do say that even though in the beginning of this diet people tend to eat more, but that as time goes on they eat less, because of stomach shrinking (it really does that) and the fact that this diet is so incredibly high in fiber, which fills you up.  The only problem I've found is with working twelve hours, you really only eat breakfast and lunch, so I do tend to get hungry before I go to bed.  I'll be researching some snack options because putting a salad together at nine in the morning is a bit much for me to be contemplating.  Some days even eating a salad at nine in the morning is a bit much.  Who can chew?  Anyway, wish me well, and hopefully by this time next year (perhaps) I'll be much healthier (although I'm pretty healthy now despite it all) and in a smaller size.    urlLink      urlLink ');"> postCount(' ');

      I just called Brian in Human Resources.  This guy is practically a therapist.  We talked about a night position over at Cape Fear, and if I can get an OK from my director to transfer (I need an OK because it's only been six months that I've been working)I can go ahead and apply for that position.  Cape Fear used to be a freestanding hospital, but then it was bought by Columbia and ultimately was bought by New Hanover.  It's a lot smaller and a lot quieter, and the position would be a simple staff nurse position in the med-surg unit.  I'm really excited at how open and encouraging he was about it, and I'm hoping that my director will be too.  I really, really don't want to be a cardiac nurse, and I really, really, don't want to be a coordinator.  So the ball's rolling, and in the mid-range plans, if I really like it over there (and people do) I might just stay there until January, and move to Hillsborough then.  At any rate, things are actually rolling now for my transfer, and I'm going to call the director in the morning and talk with her about it.  If she says it's OK, we can get me an interview over there probably next week.  And although I have to give a four week notice, it'd still be the light at the end of the tunnel.   urlLink      urlLink ');"> postCount(' ');

      What was I thinking putting myself in a situation where I was going to work four in a row?  I'm going to be certifiable by the time this is all over.  I really don't like being a cardiac nurse.  That said, I'm going to work on a transfer.  Yes, I know it's only a couple of months.  But why be miserable for a couple of months if I don't want to be?  Beyond all that, I never wanted to be a coordinator.  I am going to talk to the HR people in the very near future and see what I can work out.    I'm getting cold feet about the whole moving to Hillsborough thing.  Don't ask me why, because I don't have an answer for you.  Maybe being away from Scott.  I've never lived on my own before, and even though I'd be living with people, I'd be " by myself" for the first time since I lived in NJ (which, by the way, was the worst eighteen months of my life).  I can come up with a million reasons why it isn't a good idea for me to go, but on the other hand, I really love the idea of being able to go to the temple more than once a month.  I don't know.  I have to just leave things in Krishna's hands.  I had written to Gurudeva asking if it would be all right for me to worship Laddu Gopal.  This is Krishna as a baby, and He is just adorable.  It's something I've wanted to do for a long time now, but Gurudeva said no, so I can't.  I'm disappointed, but just like anything, a disciple has to be obedient to the spiritual master.  This all comes with trusting and following.  Sometimes it's not the easiest thing in the world, but nothing really good is easy, is it?  One thing he stressed was giving heart and soul to the holy names, so I am going to make a concerted effort to really improve the quality of my japa.  Since I know you'll be interested to know how I do on my diet, I will be posting as I lose weight.  And then someday when I'm quite lovely and thin I will post some before and after pictures.  But for the time being, I'll just be letting you know how much I lose.  I don't plan on having my cholesterol checked anytime soon as the last time I had it done it was 160.  That's all part of being a vegetarian.  But hopefully, I'll be able to report some substantial weight loss in the coming weeks.  Beyond that, I'm just pretty tired, so I think I'll be going to bed.  Of course, I had some fantastic and profound thoughts I was going to write about, but in all the hysteria at work last night (once again, shortstaffed, four nurses because they took one away from us)I forgot it.  Someday I'd like to work in a job where there's enough staff.  Although, on the bright side, I suppose, all this running and sweating is going to help me lose weight faster.  Chant Hare Krishna and be happy.   urlLink      urlLink ');"> postCount(' ');

      I wasn't supposed to go back to work until tomorrow but lo and behold, I'm about to go to work.  This is going to put me working 5 of the next 6 days, so fair warning, I'm going to be right cranky by then, and probably much before.  The weather's getting downright hot.  We are always hell bent to not put on the AC until June, but wow, he might have it on tonight.  I am starting a new diet today.  This one sounds simple enough; you eat oatmeal, fruit and milk for breakfast, and two enormous salads for lunch and dinner with damn near anything you want on them.  It's supposed to cut your cholesterol to ribbons as well as make your butt shrink.  Last check, my cholesterol was 160, so I'm good there, but anything to make the butt shrink, you know?  So considering it all, I'll probably be a little cranky for the next week.  If you want to see the diet.. click  urlLink here .   urlLink      urlLink ');"> postCount(' ');

      Chapter 2. Contents of the Gita Summarized TEXT 17    avinasi tu tad viddhi  yena sarvam idam tatam  vinasam avyayasyasya  na kascit kartum arhati   TRANSLATION  Know that which pervades the entire body is indestructible. No one is able to destroy the imperishable soul.   PURPORT   This verse more clearly explains the real nature of the soul, which is spread all over the body. Anyone can understand what is spread all over the body: it is consciousness. Everyone is conscious of the pains and pleasures of the body in part or as a whole. This spreading of consciousness is limited within one's own body. The pains and pleasures of one body are unknown to another. Therefore, each and every body is the embodiment of an individual soul, and the symptom of the soul's presence is perceived as individual consciousness. This soul is described as one ten-thousandth part of the upper portion of the hair point in size. The Svetasvatara Upanisad confirms this:    balagra-sata-bhagasya satadha kalpitasya ca  bhago jivah sa vijneyah sa canantyaya kalp ate   "When the upper point of a hair is divided into one hundred parts and again each of such parts is further divided into one hundred parts, each such part is the measurement of the dimension of the spirit soul." (Svet. 5.9) Similarly, in the Bhagavatam the same version is stated:    kesagra-sata-bhagasya satamsah sadrsatmakah  jivah suksma-svarupo 'yam sankhyatito hi cit-kanah    "There are innumerable particles of spiritual atoms, which are measured as one ten-thousandth of the upper portion of the hair."  Therefore, the individual particle of spirit soul is a spiritual atom smaller than the material atoms, and such atoms are innumerable. This very small spiritual spark is the basic principle of the material body, and the influence of such a spiritual spark is spread all over the body as the influence of the active principle of some medicine spreads throughout the body. This current of the spirit soul is felt all over the body as consciousness, and that is the proof of the presence of the soul. Any layman can understand that the material body minus consciousness is a dead body, and this consciousness cannot be revived in the body by any means of material administration. Therefore, consciousness is not due to any amount of material combination, but to the spirit soul. In the Mundaka Upanisad the measurement of the atomic spirit soul is further explained:    eso 'nur atma cetasa veditavyo  yasmin pranah pancadha samvivesa  pranais cittam sarvam otam prajanam  yasmin visuddhe vibhavaty esa atma   "The soul is atomic in size and can be perceived by perfect intelligence. This atomic soul is floating in the five kinds of air [prana, apana, vyana, samana and udana], is situated within the heart, and spreads its influence all over the body of the embodied living entities. When the soul is purified from the contamination of the five kinds of material air, its spiritual influence is exhibited." (Mund. 3.1.9)  The hatha-yoga system is meant for controlling the five kinds of air encircling the pure soul by different kinds of sitting postures--not for any material profit, but for liberation of the minute soul from the entanglement of the material atmosphere.  So the constitution of the atomic soul is admitted in all Vedic literatures, and it is also actually felt in the practical experience of any sane man. Only the insane man can think of this atomic soul as all-pervading Visnu-tattva.  The influence of the atomic soul can be spread all over a particular body. According to the Mundaka Upanisad, this atomic soul is situated in the heart of every living entity, and because the measurement of the atomic soul is beyond the power of appreciation of the material scientists, some of them assert foolishly that there is no soul. The individual atomic soul is definitely there in the heart along with the Supersoul, and thus all the energies of bodily movement are emanating from this part of the body. The corpuscles which carry the oxygen from the lungs gather energy from the soul. When the soul passes away from this position, activity of the blood, generating fusion, ceases. Medical science accepts the importance of the red corpuscles, but it cannot ascertain that the source of the energy is the soul. Medical science, however, does admit that the heart is the seat of all energies of the body.  Such atomic particles of the spirit whole are compared to the sunshine molecules. In the sunshine there are innumerable radiant molecules. Similarly, the fragmental parts of the Supreme Lord are atomic sparks of the rays of the Supreme Lord, called by the name prabha or superior energy. Neither Vedic knowledge nor modern science denies the existence of the spirit soul in the body, and the science of the soul is explicitly described in the Bhagavad-gita by the Personality of Godhead Himself.    urlLink      urlLink ');"> postCount(' ');

      British Schools Recommended Education In All Religions http://www.newindpress.com/NewsItems.asp?  LONDON, ENGLAND, April 28, 2004: British school students should be  taught the basics of the country's six principal religions: Hinduism,  Islam, Sikhism and Buddhism, as well as Christianity and Judaism --  states a report by the government's curriculum and examinations  watchdog. Education Secretary Charles Clarke said: "Religious education  plays an important part in our children's spiritual, moral, social and  cultural development." The report also calls on young people to study  other minority religious traditions, (singling out the Baha'i faith,  Jainism and Zoroastrianism), and should also consider secular  philosophies, such as humanism. Pupils should be able to study minority  religions that have a following in their community. The report was  broadly welcomed by all the faith groups. The Church of England  recognized the sensitive handling of this issue. The Muslim Council of  Britain and the Muslim Educational Trust said the report sought to  promote a pluralistic society. The guidelines make it clear that  Christianity, the country's main religion, should be studied by all  pupils throughout their schooling, whilst study of other religions  would be completed in phases from the ages of five to fourteen. Young  pupils should visit different places of worship. Teachers should  promote respect for the differences in peoples, and warn of the  "destructive power of prejudice, racism, discrimination, offending  behavior and bullying." The guidance is not statutory, but many schools  are expected to follow its principles. The report states that religious  education in Britain should be a statutory requirement and that it  should reflect the particular needs of local communities."  urlLink      urlLink ');"> postCount(' ');

This is definitely a motivating factor for further cleaning-maybe I'll find a $50 in the couch!  So give it a try.

      The whole situation with me traveling is still progressing, even though I haven't talked about it.  I have a bunch of references that people have kindly filled out for me, and today I'm going to call Lisa at Preferred.  When she leaves messages on my machine, she sounds like a cross between a cheerleader and a Valley Girl-it's hard to put into print, but it's something like, 'Hey this is LISA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! at Preferred STAFFING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!'  She's so perky, you have to wonder if they pay their employees really, really well, or if they just give everyone good drugs, or if she just had a Triple Expresso Latte from Starbucks that morning.  Anyway, I'm going to call her today.  I spoke with two of my friends who live in Hillsborough, who are devotees and who recently bought a house.  Since it's just the two of them and the house is really big, I asked if they might mind if I rented a room from them for a few months while I'm up there by myself.  This situation works out really well for all concerned-I get to live with devotees and not totally by myself (this was kind of scary for me-okay, go on, laugh, but I've never lived by myself and the idea was a bit intimidating) and also for them it provides a little extra money every month for their new house.  So it's a win-win situation.    After I talk with Lisa I might have a better bead on the timeline but right now I'm looking at late September/early October.  I have to pack up everything I own here, so that it'll be easy for Scott to get everything going, and that's something I definitely won't be able to do overnight.  So once I talk to her, I can start getting some boxes, and going through everything and packing it up.  It will seem kind of weird (and more prudent people might accuse us of jumping the gun-packing before the house is even on the market?) but I just have to have faith in this.  I know that people sometimes leave their houses on the market for months and even years, but Krishna arranges everything, and the desire to live in the association of devotees is a good thing.  Also coming up in my plans I'd like to spend a few days at the temple around Memorial Day.  Living so far away, I really lose out on a lot of things people pick up by intuition and osmosis when they are in the company of devotees.  I especially always notice this when I come home from Gurudeva's visit.  There are a million social and cultural conventions that we pick up almost unconsciously from the people around us, and being here by myself, I don't have that association.  Sort of like being raised by wolves, you know?  So just to be around devotees is like an education for me.  And if I am ever going to be second initiated, I have an awful lot to learn.  So I'm going to write to Mother Krishnapriya and see if I can stay there for three or four days, just for the purpose of learning things.  The altar is in its 15th or 20th redesign.  This time I redesigned it based on some ideas I got while I was in Sandy Ridge.  It's a bit untraditional, but I like it, and it should be an easy enough build.  I chose white melamine.  It happens to be inexpensive, but it also goes with everything and is easy to clean.  The bottom part will have shelves and drawers both in the cabinet, and there's a two-tier top part.  Instead of doors, I've decided on a canopy that will hang above.  The only thing I have left to figure out is lighting, and I already have a few options in mind for that, so it shouldn't be too difficult at all.  Hopefully he'll have it made soon.   This will probably be the only real piece of furniture I bring with me to Hillsborough-everything else will be milk crates and so on.  I won't need very much.  This should be a really good exercise in minimising my life, and hopefully when it's over I'll be able to really reduce all my material stuff and get rid of a lot of things that I will come to realise I don't need at all.    Anyway, the plans really are in the works.  I'm feeling considerably better since I've been on the Tequin, but I'm finding that the cough is still there, just masked by the hydrocodone.  I thought I had it kicked, but last night it came back with a vengeance.  And of course, now I have the whole set of 'secondary' stuff to deal with that happens once you go on antibiotics.. but I'm working on that too.  Have a good day.

      I haven't really written about me lately, mostly because I've just not been in the mood.    So what's new with me?  I'm sick.  That cough I had last week is bronchitis and pneumonia this week.  I'm out of work for a few days and taking antibiotics and LOTS of very strong cough syrup.  It wouldn't be so bad except I am absolutely exhausted all the time.  I got  a breadmaker, about which I am very excited.  I'm having some trouble with my bread not being light enough, so any hints/tips would be very much appreciated.  It's a Magic Chef that I got used, but it seems to work quite well.  I must be screwing something up with the yeast.  I also got a recipe I've been looking for for 20 years now (no bull).  It's for a German raisin bread called Stuten.  I might make it tomorrow.  Growing up, I ate it nearly every day for breakfast with butter and honey.  And in the last bit of new news, I started on Gurudeva's 2005 sweater.  This pattern is much simpler than the 2004 sweater, which was a pretty complicated Aran.  I got the pattern from a New Zealand company called Rare Yarns.  I won't be making it in alpaca, although that's what they recommend, and I think it will be just fine.  I just wish I wasn't so tired, and that it didn't hurt so much when I cough.   urlLink      urlLink ');"> postCount(' ');

      All men are forced to act helplessly according to the impulses born of the modes of material nature; therefore no one can refrain from doing something, not even for a moment.   PURPORT   It is not a question of embodied life, but it is the nature of the soul to be always active. Without the presence of the spirit soul, the material body cannot move. The body is only a dead vehicle to be worked by the spirit soul, which is always active and cannot stop even for a moment. As such, the spirit soul has to be engaged in the good work of Krsna consciousness, otherwise it will be engaged in occupations dictated by illusory energy. In contact with material energy, the spirit soul acquires material modes, and to purify the soul from such affinities it is necessary to engage in the prescribed duties enjoined in the sastras. But if the soul is engaged in his natural function of Krsna consciousness, whatever he is able to do is good for him. The Srimad-Bhagavatam affirms this:   tyaktva sva-dharmam caranambujam harer  bhajann apakvo 'tha patet tato yadi  yatra kva vabhadram abhud amusya kim  ko vartha apto 'bhajatam sva-dharmatah   "If someone takes to Krsna consciousness, even though he may not follow the prescribed duties in the sastras nor execute the devotional service properly, and even though he may fall down from the standard, there is no loss or evil for him. But if he carries out all the injunctions for purification in the sastras, what does it avail him if he is not Krsna conscious?" (Bhag. 1.5.17) So the purificatory process is necessary for reaching this point of Krsna consciousness. Therefore, sannyasa, or any purificatory process, is to help reach the ultimate goal of becoming Krsna conscious, without which everything is considered a failure.    urlLink      urlLink ');"> postCount(' ');

      In continuing adherence to the Army's "light is better" doctrine, even units recently rotated to Iraq have left most of their armor behind.  These include the I Marine Expeditionary Force, which has paid dearly for that decision with an astonishing 30 percent-plus casualties (45 killed, more than 300 wounded) in Fallujah and Ar Ramadi.  The Army's 1st Cavalry Division—which includes the unit in Sadr City—left five of every six of its tanks at home, and five of every six Bradleys.   A breakdown of the casualty figures suggests that many U.S. deaths and wounds in Iraq simply did not need to occur. According to an unofficial study by a defense consultant that is now circulating through the Army, of a total of 789 Coalition deaths as of April 15 (686 of them Americans), 142 were killed by land mines or improvised explosive devices, while 48 others died in rocket-propelled-grenade attacks. Almost all those soldiers were killed while in unprotected vehicles, which means that perhaps one in four of those killed in combat in Iraq might be alive if they had had stronger armor around them, the study suggested. Thousands more who were unprotected have suffered grievous wounds, such as the loss of limbs.   The need for more armor—and possibly troops—erupted as an issue on Capitol Hill last week in combative hearings of the Senate and House Armed Services committees. "We are not structured for the security environment we're in," Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Richard Myers told senators and congressmen, including some angry Republicans. As part of his 2005 budget request, Rumsfeld had originally cut the Army budget by 6 percent. But the Army has identified nearly $6 billion in unfunded requests—and more are on the way. "The costs are going to be staggering," says Sen. Jack Reed, a Rhode Island Democrat who has pestered the Pentagon for months for better estimates.  Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz told the House committee that military operations in Iraq are now costing about $4.7 billion a month—a sum that approaches the $5 billion a month (on average) that the Vietnam War cost, adjusted for inflation.   urlLink      urlLink ');"> postCount(' ');

      April 30, 2004 — George Sternats' first concern on returning home after having surgical staples removed from his abdomen following a stomach operation was to check on his backyard garden.  But instead of gathering some fresh vegetables, the 65-year-old found himself picking up his own stomach that had spilled out when his surgical wound reopened, his partner said on Friday. "He was looking at how many tomatoes were on, and next minute I heard him scream 'Get the ambulance, my stomach fell out'," Cheryl Orme told reporters. Sternats wrapped a towel around himself to hold his stomach in while Orme called an ambulance. "They wanted to know if he had pains in his chest and I screamed at them 'His stomach fell out, he just got staples out from a cancer operation'," Orme recounted.  "What more can you say when your man's stomach's hanging out? Isn't that enough for them to come straight away?" Sternats, from the northeastern city of Cairns, underwent surgery earlier this month to remove cancerous tumors from his abdomen and the surgical wound was closed with medical staples. Doctors ordered the staples removed Wednesday morning and the couple returned home shortly after, Orme said. Sternats was reported to be in stable condition but Orme said she planned to sue health authorities for negligence in removing the staples too soon.   urlLink      urlLink ');"> postCount(' ');

      The fission bomb detonated over Hiroshima had an explosive blast equivalent to 12,500 tons of TNT. A 1 megaton hydrogen bomb, hypothetically detonated on the earth's surface, has about 80 times the blast power of that 1945 explosion.  Radius of destructive circle: 1.7 miles 12 pounds per square inch  At the center lies a crater 200 feet deep and 1000 feet in diameter. The rim of this crater is 1,000 feet wide and is composed of highly radioactive soil and debris. Nothing recognizable remains within about 3,200 feet (0.6 miles) from the center, except, perhaps, the remains of some buildings' foundations. At 1.7 miles, only some of the strongest buildings -- those made of reinforced, poured concrete -- are still standing. Ninety-eight percent of the population in this area are dead.   Radius: 2.7 miles 5 psi  Virtually everything is destroyed between the 12 and 5 psi rings. The walls of typical multi-story buildings, including apartment buildings, have been completely blown out. The bare, structural skeletons of more and more buildings rise above the debris as you approach the 5 psi ring. Single-family residences within this this area have been completely blown away -- only their foundations remain. Fifty percent of the population between the 12 and 5 psi rings are dead. Forty percent are injured.   Radius: 4.7 miles 2 psi  Any single-family residences that have not been completely destroyed are heavily damaged. The windows of office buildings have been blown away, as have some of their walls. The contents of these buildings' upper floors, including the people who were working there, are scattered on the street. A substantial amount of debris clutters the entire area. Five percent of the population between the 5 and 2 psi rings are dead. Forty-five percent are injured.   Radius: 7.4 miles 1 psi  Residences are moderately damaged. Commercial buildings have sustained minimal damage. Twenty-five percent of the population between the 2 and 1 psi rings have been injured, mainly by flying glass and debris. Many others have been injured from thermal radiation -- the heat generated by the blast. The remaining seventy-five percent are unhurt.   NOTE: This information has been drawn mainly from "The Effects of Nuclear War" (Washington: Office of Technology Assessment, Congress of the United States, 1979). The zones of destruction described on this page are broad generalizations and do not take into account factors such as weather and geography of the target.

      An astounding number of people have recently got to the site by searching "Does Macy's tell Gimbels?"  It's sort of an interesting little phrase, definitely a New Yorkism.  If you don't know the history, Gimbels was a department store on the order of Macy's.  My mother used to say this to me all the time when I was a child, as I was (and still am) prone to asking many questions that people would rather not answer.  Here's the actual story behind it:  Although the Gimbels deaprtment store has long gone out of business, this expression is still heard around New York. The by-now proverbial words arose from a friendly, well-publicized and well-advertised retailing war between the two giant New York department stores. The expression possibly originated as a publicity gag, perhaps as a line in an Eddie Cantor comedy skit when a stooge asked Cantor to reveal some dark secret and the comedian replied "does Macy's tell Gimbels?". Actually, Macy's often told Gimbels and vice versa. One time Gimbels ran an ad calling attention to Macy's fabulous annual flower show, heading it: "Does Gimbels tell Macy's? No, Gimbels tells the world!". On another occasion, in 1955, both stores produced signs on their buildings directing shoppers to the other's store. The Gimbels-Macys rivalry was further publicized in the film Miracle on 34th Street in which Macy's directs customers to Gimbels when it doesn,t have a particular item in stock and flustered Gimbels executives, realizing their store has been made to look like "a profiteering money-grubber" have to adapt the same P.R. policy.   urlLink

      So the cops had to come back out a second time.  From now on, I'm going to have them come by and talk to me afterwards.  You can't really hear the whole effect of the music from in front of the house.  Because of the way the houses are set up and the fences and all, the whole effect of everything is funnelled directly to our bedroom windows.  The cop was really nice about everything and I ended up talking to him for about fifteen minutes.  Then, of course, I couldn't get to sleep, so I made a loaf of bread.  I'm having a recurring problem with the bread: the middle top of it collapses inwards.  I remember reading about this in BJ's breadmaker manual, but I don't remember what the remedy was.  So if you know, please drop me a word so I can figure out how to fix it.  I haven't really slept good now for the past three nights.  My original plan was to be out of here by eight-thirty, but I think I am going to try to sleep for a little bit now, and leave at nine-thirty instead.  I have everything packed, so it's just a matter of taking a shower.  I think it'll be okay.  I am very anxious to get everything and Everyone where They belong.  urlLink

      1. I knocked my two front teeth out when I was two years old.  They didn't grow back in until I was nine. 2. I'm phobic about heights, even to the point of not wanting to climb on a chair to reach the top shelf. 3. I've never ridden a motorcycle, despite the fact that my husband has owned two since 1999. 4. The only vegetables I won't eat are brussels sprouts and okra, unless it's fried. 5. When I was a child, people often thought upon seeing me that one of my parents must be Asian. 6. Each of my parents had a major accident with me-once when my teeth got knocked out and the other when I got badly burned.  If that happened today, DFS would probably put me into foster care. 7. I go barefoot whenever possible. 8. One of my favourite subjects is language.  I can read and write fairly well in Spanish and Latin, and a little bit in: German, French, Italian, and Chinese.  I can read Russian and Greek out loud (when it's written in Cyrillic) but I can't translate what I read.  I would like to learn to read Sanskrit-right now I can just pick out a few words here and there. 9.  If I ever do go back to school to get my bachelor's degree, it will be in geology and paleoanthropology, not nursing. 10.I was threatened with expulsion from highschool three months before I was supposed to graduate.  They never did kick me out. 11. I've been a committed Socialist since 1987. 12. I have six tattoos. 13. Before I decided to become a nurse, I seriously considered architecture, interior design, and graphic design.  I spent 18 months in a Bachelor of Fine Arts program before dropping out. 14. I worked as a professional DJ (on the radio) from 1988-1991.  My FCC license is still valid, so I sometimes consider going back to it part-time. 15. When I was a child, I always visualised myself having five children and being a housewife when I grew up.  I always wanted to be just like Donna Reed.  I'm still vaguely expecting this to suddenly manifest in my life. 16. I gave up veal in 1982 for moral reasons, and spent 88-92 as a vegan on a dare.  I didn't adopt my current diet (no meat/poultry/fish/eggs/caffiene) until 2000. 17. I quit drinking on February 19, 1990. 18. The first car that I ever owned was a 1968 Impala.  But my first car that actually ran was a 1955 Bel Air.  It was my primary daily transportation for several years, until my father sold it while I was away at school.  I often wish I had it back. 19. I would very much like to learn how to tig weld. 20. I don't own a single pair of jeans.  urlLink

      Don't even get me started on work.  Let's just say it's like being trapped in a really, really bad movie.  Sometimes I really wonder about it all. Meanwhile, I realised there's email I've meant to answer and haven't in like a ridiculously disgusting length of time (SORRY, Polly!)so I am going to get on that and also we are getting into turbo drive on the house, because the Word has come down from On High: if we don't find The Perfect House by December 31, we're building.  So we have a lot to do around here.  Since I'm not in Charleston right now, I have some time to get things started.    My friend Rangadevi is getting married on August 22.  Her wedding sari and jewelery have arrived at the house here, so I am going to go up this weekend and bring Nitai Gaurasundar, Bala Krsna and also her stuff.  I'm just going for Sunday, though, because there's so much going on at home right now.  urlLink

                         Diary of a Traveling Preacher                        Volume 5, Chapter 18                         June 2 - 12, 2004                        "The City of Scissors"   Our spring tour has been gaining momentum as we travel from town to town in southern Poland. As a result of well-organized publicity we have even had to turn people away at the door at some programs because the halls quickly filled to capacity. It is a bittersweet experience: sweet to see the overwhelming interest in Krsna consciousness, but bitter to see souls turned away after they have waited millions of lifetimes to come to Krsna.  Despite the growing interest, I continue to notice some apathy toward our movement among the general mass of people when we go on our chanting parties. One can easily feel the mood of the public by being on the street. Fewer people take interest in our kirtan parties than previous years, and it is not uncommon to get cold stares and even rude remarks.  I have preached in Poland since 1989, and I have seen the changes in the country firsthand, so I can tell that the present coldness toward us comes from the so-called material progress. Although material progress brings facility and comforts, it is a double-edged sword, also bringing immorality and degradation, mostly because of an increase in meat eating, intoxication, illicit sex, and gambling. A preacher is not surprised though: being versed in sastra, he's prepared for the advance of Kali Yuga.  tvam nah sandarsito dhatra dustaram nistitirsatam kalim sattva-haram pumsam karna-dhara ivarnavam  "We think that we have met Your Goodness by the will of providence, just so that we may accept you as captain of the ship for those who desire to cross the difficult ocean of Kali, which deteriorates all the good qualities of a human being."  [Srimad Bhagavatam 1.1.22]  We decided to decrease our security on the spring tour this year because the hall programs would be much smaller than before, allowing us to give more attention to our audiences. But seeing the animosity of people toward us on the street, we have felt obliged to take measures to protect ourselves in some places.  The local congregation leader in Walbrzych, Trisama prabhu, organized a police escort for our two-hour Harinam through the streets. Four policemen walked along with us, and we even had a patrol car with lights flashing in front of us. As we started Harinam that day, the officer in charge smiled and motioned that we should chant down the middle of the street. People waved at us, and shop owners came out to see the fun. Many good-hearted people enjoyed the "parade," and we got a large crowd at our program that evening.  Nevertheless times have changed, and I often find myself reflecting on the gradual loss of piety among the Polish people and the resentment toward us among some of them. Relief comes, however, at those moments when I see people's lives touched by Krsna's mercy through our efforts to preach. Seeing transformations in people lives is the only reward a preacher hopes for.  An example is a relatively new devotee who lives in Walbrzych. After the guests had left our program, I asked him whether he had invited his parents. He replied that his mother and father were divorced but he had invited his father, who lived nearby. His father, however, was inimical toward Krsna consciousness and had vehemently refused. Thus the boy was amazed when halfway through the program he saw his father sitting in the audience.  After the program, his father came up to him. "Son," he said, "please forgive any misunderstandings I had about this movement. I enjoyed the program immensely. You have my support for what you are doing."  "What about your mother?" I asked.  "Oh my mother has no problems with my being a devotee," he said laughing.  "My mother is very conservative," he continued, "but she accompanied a close friend, on the friend's request, to the Warsaw temple last year for a Sunday feast. My mother was so impressed with the program and the blissful nature of the devotees that she prayed to 'the God on the altar' to please make her son a Hare Krsna devotee. At that time I was heavily involved in drugs and criminal activities.  "Three months later I met devotees and joined the movement, and I gave up all my bad habits. At that time, my mother told me of her fervent prayer. She is so grateful to 'the God on the altar' that she thanks Him every day in her morning and evening prayers."  As our tour went on, I was especially looking forward to our program in Kielce, a moderate-sized town of 100,000 people nestled in a beautiful forested region of Poland. In 1993 we had a small but successful festival there, and I remembered the people as especially pious.  Our congregation members there were eager to have us return, and in recent weeks, they had gone out of their way to put up hundreds of posters. I considered hiring a security firm, but I remembered the warmth of the people, and when I heard of the growing interest in the festival within our congregation, I decided against it.  My decision would prove to be a mistake, however, and almost cost us dearly, for Kali-yuga has firmly taken root in Kielce since my visit in 1993.  I had my first hint of trouble as we drove through the center of town. I saw that many of our posters had been ripped down. This has always been a sure sign of antagonism. When we arrived at the hall two hours before the program, 10 devotees from the congregation were waiting for us. Their faces were anxious.  "Srila Gurudeva" one of them said, "two young men from a right-wing political party just came here and told the director of the hall to cancel our program or be prepared for the worst. They told him we are a dangerous sect and they will stop our festival one way or another. We had to convince the director that we are not a cult. He was obviously afraid of the threats, but he tentatively agreed to let the festival go on."  "I suspected something was amiss," I said, "when I saw all the posters in town ripped up."  "Yes," a devotee replied, "and yesterday the same youths were grabbing invitations from the hands of the devotees on the street. When they threatened violence, the devotees had to stop."  "How many are they?" I asked.  "For now we've only seen two," came the reply.  I paused for a moment. "It's just two local men," I thought, "so we can go out on Harinam."  Before each festival, we have a powerful one-hour kirtan to add a last touch of publicity, but on this day the preparations - setting up the stage and decorating the hall - were late, so Bhakta Dominique, the main organizer of our spring tour, asked that most devotees stay behind to help. Thus our little Harinam party of six devotees went blithely out onto the streets and into the jaws of the lion.  We had only been chanting 10 minutes when we were attacked from behind by several men in their early twenties. I was leading the kirtan party down the street, so I did not notice the scuffle at the back. But then I heard Narottam das's voice above the kirtan. "Let go!" he was shouting. "Let go!"  I reeled around and saw that one of the attackers had wrested the microphone and small amplifier from Narottam. Then the man head-butted Narottam's face, but Narottam was undeterred and grabbed back the microphone and amplifier. The kirtan came to a stop, and we confronted the men.  As soon as I saw their faces I remembered the attack on our Harinam party in Sarajevo, Bosnia, some years ago. As in Sarajevo, the men's eyes were full of hate and their lips were trembling from anger. They stood with clenched fists, ready to attack us at any moment. I also noted that they all wore the same gray-colored t-shirts with an insignia and writing in small print. As I reached for my canister of tear gas, I saw from the corner of my eye a number of other youths surrounding us.  By a quirk of fate there were no Polish devotees on the Harinam. For a few moments our attackers were put off-guard in the heated exchange of words because we were speaking in a foreign language. But just when they motioned to their friends to come forward, Sri Prahald spoke up in broken Polish. "Don't use force," he said. "Tell us what you want."  One man put his face close to Sri Prahlad. "All right," he growled in Polish, "I'm advising you to get out of here immediately."  We had only seconds to decide what to do. "Let's have kirtan," said one devotee, undeterred by their threats.  But as Sri Prahlad and I looked at each other, we conveyed the same thought without speaking a word: "Remember Sarajevo." I won't go so far as to say our exchange was telepathy. Let us simply say it was the result of a camaraderie developed after years of preaching together. It wasn't the first time we had faced such a situation.  In Sarajevo we had initially repulsed an attack by three Muslim men on our kirtan party. Devotees had fought back and smashed one of the attackers through the plate-glass window of a store. But then instead of retreating in the face of a superior aggressor ("Discretion is the better part of valor") we stood defiantly and chanted Nrsimha prayers. Thirty men then ruthlessly attacked us with pistols and knives. The rest is history.  Sri Prahlad and I nodded our unspoken agreement. "Okay," I said, "we're pulling out."  We put away our instruments (but not my tear gas) and started walking slowly in the direction of the hall. But I became suspicious when I saw one of the men walking just in front of us, off to the side, while speaking on his cell phone. He was glancing back at us from time to time. "We're walking into a trap," I thought.  Sri Prahlad took out his cell phone and called Dominique to tell him we needed someone who could speak Polish.  After walking a few more steps, I saw a group of skinheads coming down the street from the other direction. I could see that the man in front of us and the skinheads were speaking on the phone together. The skinheads began rubbing their knuckles and looked around to see if there were any police in sight. I also looked around. There were none to be seen.  Suddenly I remembered my Nrsimha mantra. "Why haven't I chanted it yet?" I thought. At that moment I remembered Uttara, the mother of Maharaja Pariksit, and how she called out for Lord Krsna when she saw a nuclear weapon coming toward her:  Uttarovaca pahi pahi maha-yogin deva-deva jagat-pate nanyam tvad abhayam pasye yatra mrtyuh parasparam  "Uttara said: O Lord of lords, Lord of the universe! You are the greatest of mystics. Please protect me, for there is no one else who can save me from the clutches of death in this world of duality."  [Srimad Bhagavatam 1.8.9]  In a fraction of a second another thought raced through my mind. "Here is the difference between a pure devotee and me," I thought. "She remembers the Lord at every moment, and I forget Him at the slightest hint of danger."  And so I chanted the mantra for the first of many times that day.  Just then Dominique came around the corner and asked what the trouble was. Sri Prahlad pointed out the man in front of us, and Dominique courageously approached him. Because Dominique was dressed in ordinary clothes and carried an air of authority, the man with the cell phone seemed a little taken aback. Apparently it caused him to call off the imminent attack of the skinheads. Our Harinam party quickly turned the corner and walked a few meters more to the safety of the hall.  "That was a close one," I said to Sri Prahlad.  "Too close," came his reply.  Dominique soon returned, and we discussed the situation. The main problem was that earlier in the day these men had told the director of the hall that they would return to disrupt our festival. Obviously, next time they would come with their friends and sympathizers.  I asked Dominique who they were, and he told me they were part of a Christian-based political party with radical views. They believed that Poland was only for Poles and the only religion in Poland should be Christianity. In recent years, the party has attracted many young men, who propagate and deliver their message with force. In areas where they are strong they do not tolerate public demonstrations contrary to their ideology.  Apparently Kielce is their party headquarters, and the local people rarely, if ever, hold outdoor public functions out of fear of them. More than once they had attacked such programs, resulting in bloody fighting and chaos.  "I suspect they were the ones behind the attack on our festival program in Tomaszow a few years ago," Dominique said.  I looked at my watch. The program was to begin in one hour. Considering that we had no security whatsoever, I proposed that we cancel the event. It wasn't worth the risk of injury to our devotees or guests. We would be far outnumbered. Dominique thought for a moment and suggested we notify the police of the situation. I reminded him how unreliable the police had been in Tomaszow. Dominique then suggested we hire a reliable security firm to protect us.  I thought for a moment. "It sounds reasonable," I said, "but I want 15 security men here in 30 minutes, or we cancel."  Dominique went into action. It was easy to inform the police, but finding 15 professional security men in a town the size of Kielce in a few minutes would be almost impossible. Generally, security firms want at least three days' notice. Dominique called seven companies, but they either were closed by that hour or didn't have the manpower available.  Time was of the essence. People, eager as always for our show, were already arriving, and the hall was filling up. I knew that it would be an easy job for the thugs. All they had to do was show up as they did in Tomaszow with baseball bats, smash a few people and cars for three or four minutes, and then run for it. I looked at Dominique. "You've got five minutes more," I said.  He called the last security firm in the phone book and explained our problem. The man in charge said he could be at the hall in 20 minutes with 15 men. But we'd have to "pay a heavy fee."  Dominique looked at me. "I've got a firm," he said.  "How much will it cost?" I asked.  "Twelve hundred dollars," he said.  My eyebrows went up. "Twelve hundred dollars!" I gasped.  "But the show will go on," Dominique said, "and that's what's important. I'll raise the money from the congregation. Don't worry."  I paused and thought for a moment. Many people had already come, and we had a reputable security firm to protect us. "Okay," I said, "let's go for it. But I want all of our children out of here now. Put them in that van and take them with some of the mothers to a safe apartment. We'll pick them up after the show tonight."  I didn't want to take any chances. I knew how determined a group of fanatics can be.  We waited anxiously for the security firm to show up, and we locked all but one of the three entrances to the hall. Now that we were determined to go on, devotees busied themselves with last-minute preparations, but all eyes were turned toward the street where the men would come from.  As the hour approached, one fearless devotee stayed out on the sidewalk in front of the hall, distributing invitations. I saw a group of men surround him ready to fight, just as the first of the security vans arrived. By Krsna's grace two policemen on street duty saw the potential trouble and broke up the situation. The devotee quickly retreated into the hall.  The men on the security team were all huge and mean looking, with enormous muscles. They gathered and took quick instructions from the head of the security firm. He was a well-dressed man, and I breathed easier when I learned that he was in charge of the anti-terrorist force in the region. The men all took strategic positions around the hall. Three of the biggest stood shoulder to shoulder in front of the entrance. Some of the guests who arrived at that time laughed at the display of power. They were unaware of the situation and probably thought it was part of the act.  When 10 of the troublemakers assembled on the other side of the street looking toward us, I saw the security men fidget a little - not from any fear, I thought, but bracing themselves for a fight.  A devotee sensed my concern. "Don't worry," he said. "They're used to it. This town is called The City of Scissors."  "What does that mean?" I asked.  "This is the stronghold of that right-wing political party," he said. "Their youth organization is infamous for fighting with scissors. It's their trademark, and they're not afraid to use them, but these security men have dealt with them before."  I walked into the hall and onto the stage. I was surprised to see a full house. Of course, considering that all our previous programs had had full houses, I shouldn't have been surprised. Still, the trouble brewing had made me think that attendance at the program would be sparse, but the people knew nothing of the potential danger.  For added safety, we had the front entrance to the hall locked and secured. If there was to be a fight between our opposition and security, the guests didn't have to know about it.  In the meantime, Sri Prahlad had a quick meeting with as many devotees as he could muster and showed them a small stairwell leading up to a metal platform above the stage. "If trouble comes," he told them, "all the women should immediately climb up there."  We then started our opening act, a bhajan, but I could hear tension in the voices of the devotees. I noticed that unlike other festival bhajans, where the devotees' eyes were serenely closed, all the devotees had their eyes wide open, looking at the audience.  After the bhajan, Keli Cancala dasi came on to perform an Odissi dance. As she began, I took the opportunity to slip out the back door to see what the situation was outside.  I was not surprised to find a number of the political youths facing off with the security men. Although the security outnumbered (and outsized) them, they were unfazed and determined to break up our festival. One of the security men motioned for me to get back in the hall. Stepping back slowly, I watched several of the youths try to force open the locked entrances.  At that moment Dominique came out. One particularly tough-looking youth, apparently their leader, recognized him from the previous encounter on the street. He pulled an invitation out of his pocket. "I demand that you let me in," he said.  "No way," Dominique said, and he motioned to the security men to remove them. The youths conferred with each other for a moment and then left, obviously with another plan in mind. As they left, one of them stopped in front of Dominique, who stood there fearlessly. The youth slid his hand across his own throat in a threatening gesture.  "We know who you are," he said, "and we will get you. We'll be back soon, and this time nothing will stop us."  Suddenly Narottam appeared from behind and said I had to come quickly, as it was time for my lecture.  "My lecture?" I thought. "How will I lecture in this frame of mind?"  As I came back in the hall, the director approached Dominique and said he had to unlock all the entrances. "Rules and regulations say they have to be open at all times," he said. "I just can't leave them locked any longer. There are too many people here."  The fact that all the entrances were now open made me nervous. I had seen how those youths had tried to force open the same doors to get in, even in the presence of the security team.  As a precaution, I stopped by the dressing room on my way to the stage. I took my CS gas from my bag and carefully placed it in my kurta pocket. Then I grabbed a wooden axe handle and hid it under my chaddar. I kept my running shoes on.  I walked onto the stage and sat down on the seat provided. As I adjusted myself, I wondered if any spiritual master in the past had ever ascended such a holy seat armed with weapons at the ready.  As the translator and I adjusted our microphones, I saw a security man take his position near the stage, just two meters away from me. As he sat down, his eyes scanned the crowd and the three open entrances.  Despite all these precautions, I knew that only the Lord could protect us from the imminent danger. I closed my eyes and joined my palms, and I slowly recited a prayer, as I usually do before beginning my lecture. But this time, instead of calling on the mercy of the acaryas, I called on the mercy of Lord Nrsimhadeva:  durgesv atavy-aji-mukhadisu prabhuh payan nrsimho 'sura-yuthaparih vimuncato yasya mahatta-hasam diso vinedur nyapatams ca garbhah  "May Lord Nrsimhadeva, who appeared as the enemy of Hiranyakasipu, protect us in all directions. His loud laughing vibrated in all directions and caused the pregnant wives of the asuras to have miscarriages. May that Lord be kind enough to protect us in difficult places like the forest and battlefront."  [Srimad Bhagavatam 6.8.14]  Then I prayed silently to Srila Prabhupada to give me the ability to focus on my lecture so that the people who had come would have the same opportunity to understand the philosophy as those who had come to our previous festivals.  The audience of 150 people listened respectfully as I began my lecture. I explained the importance of the human form of life in being able to understand spiritual knowledge. I slowly developed my talk to explain that we are not these bodies and how the soul transmigrates to another body at death. But as I continued, I began losing my concentration, remembering the threat of the angry young man to come back with his comrades. At one point my focus went from the lecture, to the open entrances. It was only with great effort that I forced my mind back and continued speaking.  Several times, as my translator was repeating what I had said, I had to bring my mind back to my lecture. "Stay fixed," I would tell myself. "This may be the only time these people ever get to hear the absolute truth."  When I finally came to the end of my talk, I felt I had not done my duty well, but as I stood up, there was thunderous applause from the audience.  After our theater group performed, Sri Prahlada led the audience in a session of meditation on the Hare Krsna mantra. But he also appeared apprehensive. Instead of closing his eyes, as he usually does in the session, he kept them wide open.  The program was coming to an end. On the suggestion of the security men, we had kept our acts short so we could finish the festival before dark. They told us that the youths would most likely return under the cover of darkness. And because we had upstaged them, they would be doubly angry and eager for revenge.  As we sat down for the last kirtan on stage, I looked at my watch and saw I had only 10 minutes before the designated time to finish. Then suddenly Dominique appeared and told me that prasadam was late and I'd have to chant for at least half an hour.  I started kirtan slowly, but the people could not contain their enthusiasm, and I had to pick up the pace. Soon they were clapping wildly and chanting loudly along with us. Some even got up and danced in the aisles. A number of children came right to the front and began dancing blissfully back and forth.  Within a few minutes the hall became Vaikuntha, the spiritual world. I marveled at the mercy of the Lord: while danger swirled around us like an ominous whirlpool, Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu was busy delivering these people by the sweetness of His holy names.  sarvatara bhajatam jananam tratum samarthah kila sadu varta bhaktan abhaktan api gaura candras tatra krsnamrta nama danaih  "The news broadcast by the saints is that all the avatars of the Lord are indeed capable of delivering Their devoted followers who worship Them. However, Sri Gauracandra delivered both devotees and non-devotees alike with His gifts of Sri Krsna's ambrosial names."  [Srila Sarvabhauma Battacarya, Susloka Satakam, text 42]  Devotees and guests dove and surfaced in the nectar of the holy names, and for a few moments even I myself forgot the danger at hand. But when the kirtan ended, I remembered the advice of our security. I thanked the people for coming and asked them to move quickly to the entrance hall, where prasadam was being served.  As the guests took prasadam, the devotees quickly packed our gear and put it in the vans. Within minutes we were ready to go.  The security team seemed on red alert as the evening sky became darker. Several times they pointed to their watches, indicating we should finish quickly. Although there was a relaxed and joyful mood among the guests, the security team was anxious to move them on. Word came that there was an unusually large assembly of unruly men gathering on the city square a hundred meters away. "You must all leave now," the chief of security said to us.  Most of the guests had left by that time, and I asked the devotees to quickly clear the hall. Dominique sent a van with three security men in it to pick up the children and women at the apartment, and when they arrived, all of us jumped into our four vans and started to pull out. Darkness was descending.  The security team escorted us in their cars to the city limits. When we reached the road to Warsaw they turned back. We were then on our own. But at that moment, I realized that in fact we had never been alone - not even for a second. The all-merciful Lord had been with us the entire time. Otherwise, how had we escaped certain injury and defeat and tasted the sweetness of victory and success?  yatra yogesvarah krsno yatra partho dhanur dharah tatra srir vijayo bhutir dhruva nitir matir mama  "Wherever there is Krsna, the master of all mystics, and wherever there is Arjuna, the supreme archer, there will also certainly be opulence, victory, extraordinary power, and morality. That is my opinion."  [Bhagavad Gita 18.78] www.traveling-preacher.com Official website for Diary of a Traveling Preacher  urlLink

      Day people just don't understand the whole working nights thing.  It's kind of hard to explain just how thoroughly this wrecks your life.  Especially this week with the on one off one thing, I'm really feeling it.  I have to go back now and work tonight and tomorrow night, and then finally I'm off.  And am I ever ready.  You just can't get any kind of sense of being off when it's only one day off.  This is a real unique thing to nights.  When you're only off one night, you can't flip your schedule over.  So in my case, anyway, I end up mostly sleeping, because my body's so confused it can't figure out what I'm doing.  When I have stretches off, it's generally at least a couple of days before I can start to get settled back into a day routine, and to really make the change back over, it takes between a week and ten days.  So don't think that it's an easy thing to work nights.  I don't think I'll ever be working nights again.  I wouldn't enjoy New Hanover in the daytime, but when we get out of here, I'm going to find a setting I can live with, and get myself firmly situated on days.  It's an extra 10K a year at least to work nights, but quite honestly, for what it does to you, it's not worth it.  It didn't bother me so much before, but trying to make any kind of advancement in spiritual life, it's about impossible.  Your whole life is turned upside down.  On top of that, twelve hour days make life nearly unmanageable for the days you have to work.  Yes, I know that on the one hand, you'll never get a six day stretch off working eight hour shifts, and you'll never get twelve days off for the price of three, but on the other hand, on a day you have to put in twelve hours, you really end up with only two or three hours in which to live.  For example, on a typical day, I get home at 0845.  I try to be to sleep between 0930 and 1000, and if all goes well, I can sleep until 345PM.  Then I have to get up, shower, eat breakfast, make lunch for me, and make dinner for my husband.  He comes home about 430(if he isn't running late on an install) and on a work day, I usually manage to spend an hour and fifteen minutes with him (between cooking, eating, putting on makeup and getting dressed).  Usually about 545 I leave for work.  I work all night and again come home about 0845, meaning I've spent fifteen hours between work and travel, and I do it again.  So I understand that hospitals have adopted the twelve hour shift as a way to staff more with less, but the byproduct of it is that for however many days you work that week, you have virtually no life.  They've managed to convince a lot of nurses that it's worth giving up your life for four days off a week, but as far as I'm concerned, I'd rather work the eights and have some kind of regulation to my life, which I have absolutely none of now.  The only way I can really cope with this is to say that this is just the austerity we have to go through and endure to get ourselves closer to the temple.  I can tell you this, once we're up there, I'm not going to do this anymore.  There are more important things in life than work.  urlLink

      This on one/off one business is tearin me up.  I have like six or seven days off coming up though, so I really shouldn't be whining.  I had moved my schedule around to do this because Anne and I were supposed to go to Charleston this weekend.  Well, I had a feeling it was going to fall through, but it's because Anne is sick.  So we won't be going anywhere much, but there is plenty to do here.  My mission, and I have no choice but to accept it, is to throw away as much junk as possible.  Trust me, when you live in a place for ten years.. actually eleven now.. you get a lot of junk.  We are both at the point where we are just having faith that the right house will manifest itself.  I found a nice one last night in Prospect Hill, but Scott also found one on the Flat River.  So we are still having options.  I'm not all that worried.. everything will come together as it ought.  Here is a quick recipe I made yesterday for some wontons.  I am posting it because Scott really liked them, which surprised me.  Satyavati's Wontons  You need: about two cups of mixed: julienned hearts of broccoli and cauliflower, cabbage, and carrots.  (You can simply buy a bag of Broccoli Slaw or Rainbow Salad and be done with it). Ghee Egg-free wonton wrappers (I got mine in the Saigon Market.  They freeze well.)  Melt a little ghee in a pan, then add: 1 tsp cumin, 1/2 tsp fennel, 1/4 tsp turmeric, 1/2 tsp hing, 1/4 tsp chili powder, 1 tsp garam masala, 1 tsp mustard seeds.  Let this cook for a minute or so til everything starts to popping.  Add the julienned vegies and stir fry with a little salt and pepper for a couple of minutes, until they get just a little soft.  Don't overcook them.  Remove to a bowl.  Lay out several wrappers.  Put about 1 tsp in the center of each.  Wet the edges and fold over.  Press to seal.  They now look like pierogi.  Repeat with as many wrappers as it takes to use up your filling.  Melt a little ghee in a pan and pan fry on both sides for 3-4 minutes until golden brown and crispy.  Drain on paper towels.  Offer and serve.  We had these plain, as is, but they would be good with a nice tamarind dipping sauce.  urlLink

      I'm just tired and strung out.  My work schedule is really hectic for the next few days.  If all goes well Anne and I should be going to Charleston the end of the week but I have a feeling it's going to fall through.   We're going buck wild looking at houses and so on and I've already begun investigating some employment.  It's really too early to do anything yet, but the jobs are out there when I'm ready.  Personally, I'm ready.   The Decision has come down: we're buying, not building.  So if you know anyone who has a house for sale, here's what we're looking for: 2000+ square feet, preferably 60-150 years old (will consider a new house if it fits our needs), eat in kitchen, hardwood floors, large room suitable for a theatre, garage attached or detached, front porch a must.  Two story is preferable but again will consider other options.  Must have at least two acres, preferably 5+.  Dirt road a plus, as secluded as possible.  Within 35-40 miles of Hillsborough, NC.   Price range: ideally under 175K.     Let me know if you hear anything.  In the meantime, please chant Hare Krishna and be happy.  urlLink

      TRANSLATION  The holy name, character, pastimes and activities of Kṛṣṇa are all transcendentally sweet like sugar candy. Although the tongue of one afflicted by the jaundice of avidyā [ignorance] cannot taste anything sweet, it is wonderful that simply by carefully chanting these sweet names every day, a natural relish awakens within his tongue, and his disease is gradually destroyed at the root.  PURPORT  The holy name of Lord Kṛṣṇa, His quality, pastimes and so forth are all of the nature of absolute truth, beauty and bliss. Naturally they are very sweet, like sugar candy, which appeals to everyone. Nescience, however, is compared to the disease called jaundice, which is caused by bilious secretions. Attacked by jaundice, the tongue of a diseased person cannot palatably relish sugar candy. Rather, a person with jaundice considers something sweet to taste very bitter. Avidyā (ignorance) similarly perverts the ability to relish the transcendentally palatable name, quality, form and pastimes of Kṛṣṇa. Despite this disease, if one with great care and attention takes to Kṛṣṇa consciousness, chanting the holy name and hearing Kṛṣṇa's transcendental pastimes, his ignorance will be destroyed and his tongue enabled to taste the sweetness of the transcendental nature of Kṛṣṇa and His paraphernalia. Such a recovery of spiritual health is possible only by the regular cultivation of Kṛṣṇa consciousness.  When a man in the material world takes more interest in the materialistic way of life than in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, he is considered to be in a diseased condition. The normal condition is to remain an eternal servant of the Lord (jīvera 'svarūpa' haya — kṛṣṇera 'nitya-dāsa' [Cc. Madhya 20.108]). This healthy condition is lost when the living entity forgets Kṛṣṇa due to being attracted by the external features of Kṛṣṇa's māyā energy. This world of māyā is called durāśraya, which means "false or bad shelter." One who puts his faith in durāśraya becomes a candidate for hoping against hope. In the material world everyone is trying to become happy, and although their material attempts are baffled in every way, due to their nescience they cannot understand their mistakes. People try to rectify one mistake by making another mistake. This is the way of the struggle for existence in the material world. If one in this condition is advised to take to Kṛṣṇa consciousness and be happy, he does not accept such instructions.  This Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is being spread all over the world just to remedy this gross ignorance. People in general are misled by blind leaders. The leaders of human society — the politicians, philosophers and scientists — are blind because they are not Kṛṣṇa conscious. According to Bhagavad-gītā, because they are bereft of all factual knowledge due to their atheistic way of life, they are actually sinful rascals and are the lowest among men.  na māḿ duṣkṛtino mūḍhāḥ  prapadyante narādhamāḥ  māyayāpahṛta jñānā-  āsuraḿ bhāvam āśritāḥ  "Those miscreants who are grossly foolish, lowest among mankind, whose knowledge is stolen by illusion, and who partake of the atheistic nature of demons, do not surrender unto Me." (Bg. 7.15)  Such people never surrender to Kṛṣṇa, and they oppose the endeavor of those who wish to take Kṛṣṇa's shelter. When such atheists become leaders of society, the entire atmosphere is surcharged with nescience. In such a condition, people do not become very enthusiastic to receive this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, just as a diseased person suffering from jaundice does not relish the taste of sugar candy. However, one must know that for jaundice, sugar candy is the only specific medicine. Similarly, in the present confused state of humanity, Kṛṣṇa consciousness, the chanting of the holy name of the Lord — Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare/ Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare — is the only remedy for setting the world aright. Although Kṛṣṇa consciousness may not be very palatable for a diseased person, Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī nonetheless advises that if one wants to be cured of the material disease, he must take to it with great care and attention. One begins his treatment by chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa mahā-mantra because by chanting this holy name of the Lord a person in the material condition will be relieved from all misconceptions (ceto-darpaṇa-mārjanam [Cc Antya 20.12]). Avidyā, a misconception about one's spiritual identity, provides the foundation for ahańkāra, or false ego within the heart.  The real disease is in the heart. If the mind is cleansed, however, if consciousness is cleansed, a person cannot be harmed by the material disease. To cleanse the mind and heart from all misconceptions, one should take to this chanting of the Hare Kṛṣṇa mahā-mantra. This is both easy and beneficial. By chanting the holy name of the Lord, one is immediately freed from the blazing fire of material existence.  There are three stages in chanting the holy name of the Lord — the offensive stage, the stage of lessening offenses, and the pure stage. When a neophyte takes to the chanting of the Hare Kṛṣṇa mantra, he generally commits many offenses. There are ten basic offenses, and if the devotee avoids these, he can glimpse the next stage, which is situated between offensive chanting and pure chanting. When one attains the pure stage, he is immediately liberated. This is called bhava-mahā-dāvāgni-nirvāpanam. As soon as one is liberated from the blazing fire of material existence, he can relish the taste of transcendental life.  The conclusion is that in order to get freed from the material disease, one must take to the chanting of the Hare Kṛṣṇa mantra. The Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is especially meant for creating an atmosphere in which people can take to the chanting of the Hare Kṛṣṇa mantra. One must begin with faith, and when this faith is increased by chanting, a person can become a member of the Society. We are sending sańkīrtana parties all over the world, and they are experiencing that even in the remotest part of the world, where there is no knowledge of Kṛṣṇa, the Hare Kṛṣṇa mahā-mantra attracts thousands of men to our camp. In some areas, people begin to imitate the devotees by shaving their heads and chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa mahā-mantra, only a few days after hearing the mantra. This may be imitative, but imitation of a good thing is desired. Some imitators gradually become interested in being initiated by the spiritual master and offer themselves for initiation.  If one is sincere, he is initiated, and this stage is called bhajana-kriyā. One then actually engages in the service of the Lord by regularly chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa mahā-mantra, sixteen rounds daily, and refraining from illicit sex, intoxicants, meat-eating and gambling. By bhajana-kriyā one attains freedom from the contamination of materialistic life. He no longer goes to a restaurant or hotel to taste so-called palatable dishes made with meat and onions, nor does he care to smoke or drink tea or coffee. He not only refrains from illicit sex, but avoids sex life entirely. Nor is he interested in wasting his time in speculating or gambling. In this way it is to be understood that one is becoming cleansed of unwanted things (anartha-nivṛtti). The word anartha refers to unwanted things. Anarthas are vanquished when one becomes attached to the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement.  When a person is relieved from unwanted things, he becomes fixed in executing his Kṛṣṇa activities. Indeed, he becomes attached to such activities and experiences ecstasy in executing devotional service. This is called bhāva, the preliminary awakening of dormant love of Godhead. Thus the conditioned soul becomes free from material existence and loses interest in the bodily conception of life, including material opulence, material knowledge and material attraction of all variety. At such a time one can understand who the Supreme Personality of Godhead is and what His maya is.  Although māyā may be present, it cannot disturb a devotee once he attains the bhāva stage. This is because the devotee can see the real position of māyā. Māyā means forgetfulness of Kṛṣṇa, and forgetfulness of Kṛṣṇa and Kṛṣṇa consciousness stand side by side like light and shadow. If one remains in shadow, he cannot enjoy the facilities offered by light, and if one remains in light, he cannot be disturbed by the darkness of shadow. By taking to Kṛṣṇa consciousness, one gradually becomes liberated and remains in light. Indeed, he does not even touch the darkness. As confirmed in Caitanya-caritāmṛta (Madhya 22.31):  kṛṣṇa — — sūrya-sama; māyā haya andhakāra  yāhāń kṛṣṇa, tāhāń nāhi māyāra adhikāra  "Kṛṣṇa is compared to sunshine, and māyā is compared to darkness. Wherever there is sunshine, there cannot be darkness. As soon as one takes to Kṛṣṇa consciousness, the darkness of illusion, the influence of the external energy, will immediately vanish."  urlLink

      Someone just left a message on our answering machine (we never answer the phone) for "Satayvia".    With this in mind, let me offer a pronunciation key for the general public.  My name is not hard to say.  All you have to do is actually look at it: Satyavati.   Here are two common and both correct pronunciations for my name: SOT ya VAH tee SUT yuh VUT tee (Punjabi/American pronunciation)   There is also a third correct pronunciation that changes the stress on the syllables: Sot ya vah TEE,  but that is not the way Gurudeva said it, so when my name is written with diacritics, it indicates the proper stresses.  (Diacritics are extra markings used on a Roman alphabet to help with pronunciation.)  I hope this has been helpful.  It does take a little practice, but there's no reason anyone should ever be calling me Satchee, Sacajawea, Stephanie, or Satayvia ever again.  Thank you and have a good night.   urlLink

      Jai Sri Sri Radha Golokananda!  Jai Sri Sri Nitai Gaurachandra!!  Jai Sri Sri Nitai Gaurasundar!!   Before we've even put the house on the market , the people across the street from us have said they want to buy our house from us as soon as possible.  They're giving us the price we wanted after initially offering us ten thousand less than what we asked, and they've also said they will rent it to us (for the same as our mortgage) for as long as we need.  So this has just kicked everything up a notch, hasn't it??  We've just moved into overdrive.  At first my reaction was: 'I can't believe this!'  but you know what?  I CAN believe it.  I have told Scott all along that Krishna was going to arrange everything for us.  I don't know all the motivations in his heart for wanting to move, but for me, all I've ever wanted was to be close to the devotees and to Radha Golokananda, and to be in an environment that will help my spiritual life, not hinder it.  And it looks like Krishna is clearing the way for everything to happen.  Now, of course, this is all unofficial.  I'm grown up enough and have had enough disappointments in life to not believe a thing until all the paperwork's signed, sealed, and delivered, but this is a really encouraging start.  I can't imagine being able to be at the Sunday Feast EVERY Sunday.. being able to be at mangal aroti more than once every two months.. being around the devotees all the time.. without having to drive for two and a half hours every time.    So the people across the street are making some arrangement for our house to be appraised.  We just have to get everything straightened up, because it's kind of messy in here with everything getting ready for the painting/packing/new bathroom floors thing.  So we can get that handled, and then we can just take the next step.  I do want to point out that Krishna isn't some pizza delivery boy that you call up and tell what you want and then He brings it.  It doesn't work like that.  If you sincerely desire to please Krishna, and make that your priority, then He gives you all facility to do so.  Krishna's God.. there's nothing He can't do.  But He doesn't HAVE to do anything, and our position is not that we order Him around.  We're His servants, not the other way around.  But if we try to please  Him , He makes it possible.  urlLink

      I just got back a little while ago from Hillsborough.  Here's some initial thoughts day by day:  SUNDAY: I got up to the temple about 4:15 and found out that I couldn't stay in the guest house because Krsangi hurt her foot and was staying there.  So after the feast et al, I went down to the Microtel for the night.  I got a new book called Servant of the Servant by Tamal Krsna Goswami Maharaj.  It's really good.  MONDAY:  I moved out of the Microtel and into Mandakini's. This is the first time I've stayed in her new house and it's really nice.  The kids are really cute.. I am just not used to kids once they're big enough to locomote independently.  They sort of turn into people at that stage and I'm just not good with it.  Rasaraj, the middle son, is just so cute I could eat him with a spoon, though.  We drove up to Roxboro looking for a piece of property we were interested in but couldn't find it.  It's a really nice area though.  I went to the evening aroti and that was really nice too.  I like mangal aroti the best, though.  TUESDAY: Mandakini and I stayed up late because I was talking her ear off so I missed the entire morning program (I am a lazy conditioned soul).  Instead, we drove Mother Tulsi to the airport and then we went to the Indian store.  We bought a bunch of stuff, different kinds of pickles, and then we went back to the house and Mandakini made kitchri and we had pancha-pickles.. lime, bitter melon, green chili, red chili, and mango.  (That's probably like a devotee joke because pancha means five.. ok so it was a bad devotee joke.) Anyway all the pickles were really salty but some were pretty good.  Then we went again to the evening aroti and that was really nice.  WEDNESDAY:  Today I was at mangal aroti and the whole morning program.  I helped Mother Cintamani make garlands: I made one for Radharani, which was really special.  Then after prasadam I ran back to the house, changed, packed the car, and came back to help in the kitchen for Raj bhoga (noon offering).  Because I'm not second-initiated, I am not allowed to actually cook or touch the stove, but I cut vegetables for steamies, set out the rolls, and rolled chapatis.  The chapatis weren't round, but they were paper thin, and I was figuring if I had to choose between thin or round I'd go for thin.  I was in the kitchen with Caitanya and Rasa-sundari.  I didn't do a lot but it was really hot and I was kind of overwhelmed with it all.  There's a lot to do-eleven different preparations-and the clock is ticking because everything has to be very punctual.  There was tamarind chutney, chapatis, steamies, sweets, salad with dressing, nectar drink, rolls, a tomato 'omelette', rice, and I think two different subjis.  It was a lot.  After prasadam I went Ebaying with Rangadevi and we got her wedding sari and also some jewelery.  So there's plenty of time and she can see if she likes it or not.  Then I had to run home.  All the way it's rained.  I am pretty tired, so I think I'll be getting to bed early tonight.  There's more I have to write, but I will keep that for later on.  Chant Hare Krishna and be happy!   urlLink

      So Jimmy Kimmel decided to pick on Detroit in one of his monologues, and made a few jokes about the big city.  The network who runs his show decided to pull it, and he had to make a huge public apology for it.  Bill Parcells, the NFL coach, referred to some "surprise" plays as "Jap" plays, and had to make a huge public apology for it and the NFL considered fining him despite the fact that he said both before and after the offending phrase that no disrespect was intended to anyone.  Now you all know I am not in the least a prejudiced person.  But I do question the current atmosphere of political correctness.  It's almost become stifling.  How do you reconcile the right to be honest and having the freedom to say what you're thinking, and the fact that if anything you DO say offends absolutely anyone, you can't say it?  So where does the line blur between honesty and diplomacy, between being able to say what you think regardless of how anyone feels about it, and being publicly shamed, censored or even losing your job for it?  How does it all come together?  This country started because a group of people decided that the King was an idiot.  They weren't allowed to say that out loud, so ultimately they fought a war and made sure that in the new laws, you had the right to say that the King was an idiot.  Of course, they then decided that all rights were only for free white men of legal age.  Maybe that's where the problems started.. I don't know.  All I know is that we do a lot of crowing around here about how free we are and how we can say and do whatever we want, as opposed to those backwards uncivilised savages in every other corner of the globe who repress women and don't allow free speech and have censorship and don't let the public express themselves without fear of reprisal.  And amidst waving flags and the strains of the national anthem we pat each other on the back and talk about our ethical, moral, intellectual, political, social and obviously financial superiority over everyone else on the face of the earth.  And then Jimmy Kimmel's show gets pulled and Bill Parcells gets a public spanking.  So is it me who's confused, or are we operating under rather a dangerous double standard here?  Help me out, because I'm just not getting it.  And don't you go assuming or thinking that I condone prejudice or discrimination in any form, because I don't now, never have, and never will.  That is not what I'm saying here.  I'm saying.. where do you draw the line with "political correctness" and when does it become an impingement on your basic right of free speech?  Think about it before you answer.  urlLink

      Sometimes I wonder if people realise how insulting they really are with some of the questions they ask.  Don't get me wrong.  I love to answer questions about Krishna Consciousness and give people information about what we do and believe.  But really, sometimes, I often think, if I was asking YOU this question you're asking ME, would you be insulted?  How would YOU react?  People just say some really unbelievable things sometimes.  I sometimes put it off as ignorance, but on the other hand, sometimes I think it's just plain ugliness.  One of these days I am going to turn the tables around and start asking people the same questions they ask me, and see if they get themselves in a huff over it.  I have found that, in general, most people I talk to haven't done any real thinking about what they believe or why they believe it.  They've never really pondered the serious questions about life or looked to their faith to provide the answer, and questioned when there was no viable answer forthcoming.  I got into this conversation the other night with someone who'd never really done any deep thinking about the fundamental questions of life.  I don't think I can believe without examination.  Certainly there are things that I don't understand.  Krishna consciousness can be very metaphysical and there is a lot of it that goes over my head, yes, but that is more of a lack of understanding on my part rather than the answers not being there.  In the basics, all the questions I ever had about 'life, the universe, and everything' were answered for me once I really began to understand the philosophy.  And there is a lot more philosophy than my little brain can handle.  Women are best at devotion, anyway, more so than philosophy, but I think it's important that the real basic questions get answered: who am I, where was I before I was here, where am I going, why do I have to do this, how do I get out of it, and suchlike.  When we talk about incarnations and expansions and portions of plenary portions.. that gets way over my head.  But I consider that stuff to be really less important, to me anyway, in the long run.  Krsna is the Supreme, and our position is to serve Him and love Him.    Anyway.  Back again for another night at the grindstone.  I'm tired today.  The past couple of days we've had some unpleasant surprises from the ER-things they 'forget' to mention until the patient is on the floor and it's just about too late to do anything about it-and unless we had a spat of discharges today, we'll be full tonight.  Well, it happens, I suppose, but I'm just a bit on the irritable side.  I might be a little hormonal.  I can never tell.  I'm going to Hillsborough on Sunday for  FOUR DAYS .  It's going to be downright wonderful.  Then two weeks from today, we're going to Charleston, unless Anne bails on me.  I've never been, so I hope that it all works out.  If you have some time, you can listen to all kinds of devotional music  urlLink here .  Real Player will be needed, but you can download it free if you don't have it.

      The thing I hate the most about working nights is never knowing what day it is.  I know the date.  Today's the tenth.  But I can never keep the day of the week straight.  People do tend to think you're crazy, high, or just a little weird when you look at them very earnestly and say, "Wait! What day is it?"  Their first answer will always be not to give you the day, like you asked, but the date.  "No, I know that.  What DAY is it?"  Then they look at you again like you're crazy (nurses especially are great for this.  We assess people all the time for how oriented they are-to time, place, and person.)    But you know.. it isn't really our fault.  We go to work on one day and go home on another.  Is it any wonder that when I wake up I can't always remember what day it is?  All I know is that I have to go to work.  Again.  Actually, I have a long stretch off coming up.  I'll be spending four days in Hillsborough hopefully undergoing some intensive learning.  I know I've cried a million times before how hard it is for me to learn and advance in any way being here all by myself.  This will be really good for me, to specifically go up with the idea and purpose of learning some things.  Mother Krishnapriya has it all set up for me, so it should be really good.  I'm going to go up on Sunday and come home on Wednesday.  (Ha! I knew those days, didn't I!!)  Then, a few days later, Anne and I are going to Charleston.  At least we made plans to go.  With Anne, nothing's set until it actually happens.  I am also going to put forth a proposal that on the one hand is going to eliminate these long stretches off, but on the other hand is going to make my life a little easier in other ways.  I feel like it's detrimental to the unit that I only work three days a week.  We really need a presence around more than that.  My proposal is that if we can get enough staffing, that I move to working eight hour nights-from 7PM to 3AM.  This would cover the busy time, and put me on the unit five days a week instead of the current three.  I think it would help a lot.  I mean, let's face it, the way I'm setting up my schedule these days I might be gone for six or even seven days at a time.  That really isn't in the unit's best interest.  I know, I know, you think I'm crazy.  I am going to think about it a little more before I throw this proposal out.  But I do think it would be better for the floor.  I wouldn't mind getting off twelves either.  They just suck your whole life up for those days.  Then by the time you've recovered from them, you only have one day left before you have to go back to work anyway.  We'll see how it goes.  Let me meditate on it a bit.  Have a good night.  It's hot out there.  Chant Hare Krishna and be happy.  urlLink

      Chapter 12. Devotional Service TEXT 8  TRANSLATION   Just fix your mind upon Me, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and engage all your intelligence in Me. Thus you will live in Me always, without a doubt.  PURPORT   One who is engaged in Lord Krsna's devotional service lives in a direct relationship with the Supreme Lord, so there is no doubt that his position is transcendental from the very beginning. A devotee does not live on the material plane--he lives in Krsna. The holy name of the Lord and the Lord are nondifferent; therefore when a devotee chants Hare Krsna, Krsna and His internal potency are dancing on the tongue of the devotee. When he offers Krsna food, Krsna directly accepts these eatables, and the devotee becomes Krsna-ized by eating the remnants. One who does not engage in such service cannot understand how this is so, although this is a process recommended in the Gita and in other Vedic literatures.   urlLink

      BOSTON (AP) -- Transit police will begin randomly stopping riders on Boston's subways and commuter trains next month to search their bags and packages, a procedure transportation officials say was largely prompted by the March 11 train bombings in Spain.  The new policy is set to be in place for July's Democratic National Convention, MBTA Police Chief Joseph Carter told The Boston Globe for a story in Tuesday editions. It will include explosive-sniffing dogs and all 247 uniformed Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority police officers, he said.   So what will be next?  Let's just dismantle the Bill of Rights while we're at it.  Now, for no apparent reason except that someone doesn't like your face, your skin colour, what you're wearing or the fact that you accessorise poorly, they can search your stuff.  Where is the ACLU on this?  We are one step closer to being that which we've (apparently) been fighting against for the last 60-something years.  Land of the free?  You really think so?  urlLink

      I had more crazy dreams last night.  The predominant feature of last night's dream was a sense of somehow being in some branch of the military, and having to get on a plane by riding on this conveyor belt system through a very narrow and low-roofed passageway (in the dream, for some reason, I was thinking, this is just like being a fish)and you actually had to lay on your back and go in feet first.    I have absolutely no idea what that means.  I had a record number of hits on the site yesterday.  I'm not sure if everyone found what they were looking for when they got here, but thank you anyway.    When I started writing this blog, it had a mission and a purpose.  After a while, the blog just became part of me for its own sake.  It seemed to take on a life of its own.  I do try to keep it oriented to what my original plan was, but I go off now and again in digressions and rants.  This is basically just a well-rounded view into my life.  I mean, my life isn't exciting by any means.  But I like to share it anyway.  I used to keep a paper journal, but for me, this is so much easier and more fulfilling.  I like the pictures.  I like the ease of it (I actually type faster than I write) but most of all I like the interactiveness of it-the fact that other people are reading it and believe it or not, coming back again and again to read it, even though they never leave a comment.  There are blogs I read every single day.  I've never met the people face to face, but I feel as though I have.  It's strange how you can develop a relationship with someone like that, or something that feels like a relationship, just from reading their thoughts and views.  For that reason, I'm not really crazy about the 'news' type blogs.  I am much more interested in people on a personal level.  Anyway, that's just how I feel about it.  You might think this is nuts.  Have you ever seen the commercials for that thing called a "Chillow"?  This is a water-filled pad that you lay on your pillow, and it stays cool so you don't have to flip your pillow 25 times a night looking for the cool spot.  Well, I decided to get a couple.  So far Scott is kind of afraid of his ("I'm afraid I'm going to wake up with a stiff neck from the cold") but I absolutely love it.  It squishes down your pillow some because it's pretty heavy (you put 80.. yes, eighty.. ounces of water into it) but it feels really good on your face.  You'd be surprised how cold it actually feels, when all it is, is room temperature.  Through the night, though, it does tend to get warm, but after you've been off it an hour or so, it cools right back down.  So if you've ever considered it, I'd say go for it.  Especially in this heat.  Although, you have to remember, it picks up the ambient temperature, so if you have no air conditioning and it's 105 outside, your Chillow isn't going to be cold.  I bought a book called "General Paleontology" and my plan for today is to be able to spend at least one hour reading it in between all the other crap I have to do.  Now, that may not sound exciting to you, but it's been my favourite subject (along with religion) for my entire life.  My mother will vouch for this.  By the time I was four I could name all the geologic time periods in order.  So yes, to answer your question, I've always been a little weird.  Beyond that, Scott wants to paint the office next week and that means everything has to come down.  I don't like doing this stuff.  I haven't got anywhere to put things number one, and number two, I just don't like doing it.  But I will at least make a dent after lunchtime today.  I promise.  We've been watching American Chopper pretty consistently since it began.  I'm starting to think that their fame and fortune will ultimately be the death of that show.  Last night they had on Cousin Keith, whose role seems to be to take on Pop's position when Pop can't be around.  What a jerk he turns out to be.  Vinny and Mikey should have taken him out back and had a prayer meeting with him.  (You might have to be southern to actually get that..)  Those two (Vinny and Mikey) are my favourites anyway, anymore.  The show's changed a lot since the beginning.  I think as they continue to be famous and household names, that they won't really be able to sustain the show.  The other "American" shows, as far as I'm concerned, are bombs.  Especially that American Hot Rod.  That guy Boyd is a jerk too, and I wish he'd wear something else besides Hawaiian shirts.  And how twisted is it that is wife AND his ex-wife both work for the company?  That sounds like something for a therapist.  Anyway.  There's the sum total of all my television watching over the last year or so.  Of course, I do watch cartoons.  Have a good day.  Chant Hare Krishna and be happy.  urlLink

      I found a new way to spell my name today (as if the one I have doesn't confuse them enough):  Sathyavaadi .  I kind of thought that was cool.  Transliterated Hindi, Bengali, and Sanskrit (I imagine other languages of the subcontinent as well.. India has like 1200+ languages) have really, really loose spelling.  This used to confuse me, until I just got used to it.  You can find the same word spelled in multiple ways, and it can get kind of ticklish until you realise they are all saying the same thing.  Throw in the diacritics (special marks that help with pronunciation) and you've really got chaos.    As far as my name goes, people here have a really hard time with it.  You should hear the things I get called.  Someone called me Stephanie today.  Trust me, there are a lot more complicated names than Satyavati-or, if you prefer, Sathyavaadi.  Although they are different spellings, when pronounced, they're practically identical-generally you don't hear the 'h' in a 'th' combination.  And the way I write my name includes diacritics over the last A and I-in this spelling it's simply included by putting in the double A.  Interesting to me at least, but I'm not expecting you to get all excited over it.   urlLink

      I'm really struggling to express myself lately.  There's been a situation that I want to talk about, but I can't find a good way to put into words.  So I suppose I have to just sit on it a while before it'll be ready to come out.    In other news, I had some really weird dreams last night.  When I say weird, I am not kidding.  We're talking getting married to Al Borland (yeah, the guy on Tool Time)-but then at the last minute running away and NOT getting married.. why?  Because I was still married to my husband.  Okay.  If that isn't weird enough, there were some aggressive Japanese androids in it, and we were all in a church, but also we were at my parents' old house in New York.  And my husband was there.  There were more weird details like all the guests were people I work with, and some nice old cars, and I was wearing just the most beautiful dress that looked a lot like a nightgown but was simply stunning.  It was cream coloured plain batiste cotton and was off the shoulder, with long sleeves flared at the wrists with long points that came down over my hands (not sharp points, rounded, but you get the idea), a fitted bodice (and it was a dream, because my bodice was decidedly better looking than it really is) and a wide skirt with a deep double ruffle (about 6-8" each), slightly trained in the back, and I wore at least one petticoat under it, but no hoops.  (I could draw you a picture of it, that's how clear it is in my mind.)  Also, I was barefoot through the whole thing, and for some reason spent a lot of time running up, down, and away on marble staircases.  I woke up going.. "What?"  Yet another change on the home-shopping front.  We've gone back to the "Make A New House Look Old" plan.  I have a feeling that this is really going to cost us considerably more than the "Fix Up An Old House" plan, but we found a layout that really suits all our needs.  We have some weird requirements for a floor plan.  The dog isn't allowed in the kitchen or dining room.  She has to stay in a fenced area, too, because she can be so animal-aggressive.  So when we look at floor plans, we have to determine how well she will be able to get around the house, and what her access to different areas is.  Also, Scott will be putting in a real live theatre in the next house modeled after a 1930's movie house, so he needs a room with certain proportions and proper window placement.  I'm not really allowed to have anything to do with the decoration, etc., of this room, because it's his, but I have offered some suggestions just about colours and styles.  He's in charge of that.  Also, I have some really specific needs in the kitchen.  You know my obsession with creating a 1930's kitchen down to an authentic old stove and refrigerator.  I don't know if you can imagine this but in the next house, there won't be any built-in cabinetry or anything like that.  Everything will be in free standing hutches and Hoosiers-a real copy of your great-grandmother's or possibly your grandmother's kitchen.  And it'll be an eat-in kitchen, so it has to be big.  Of course like everyone who's ever lived in a small place we'd like a big bathroom, and in this house we're going to have a dedicated guest room/suite, and we still need a library and a temple room (upgrade from this house!) and another room where I can put my sewing machine and so on.  So we have some pretty specific needs.  Combine this with the fact that most of your really old houses were set right on the road, not back from it, and it becomes almost easier to just go ahead and build.  So now we've moved on to the search for property, and we're looking for about five acres to do it with.  Hopefully we'll find something affordable that we can work with soon.  In all other news, I'm supposed to get this room ready for paint today, but I'm not quite sure how to go about it yet.  Where do I put everything??   urlLink

      This is the story of how I became a devotee.   Before 1985, I had of course heard George singing My Sweet Lord (I remember hearing it on the radio when we still lived in the city, which would have been prior to 1975.)  I first participated in the maha-mantra in 1985 when I was, of all places, in Catholic highschool. It was during an art class when I was complaining of having a creative block, and my teacher suddenly said, "Well, get up and dance around, and sing Hare Krsna." I wasn't so surprised by this because we all thought he was weird anyway, and so we all got up, and he sang it for us, and we sang it too. And we danced around. What was weird was he wasn't a devotee.  I also worked with a girl who was a devotee, who gave me some books. She invited me to go to some meetings up in the Catskills, but I declined. She was kind of weird, and unfortunately that had a bigger impact on me than the Chant and Be Happy that she gave me, and than the picture (that I know now was Prabhupada) she kept on her desk.  I decided to leave the Catholic church two weeks after graduating highschool. I didn't have any plan for my spiritual life or how I was going to pursue it; I simply knew I didn't want any part of the Catholic church. I got involved in abusive relationships, developed a pretty serious drinking problem (at 17), ended up dropping out of college and coming home wth absolutely no plan and no future. So I decided I was going to 'find religion'.  I started, in 1988, with 'pagan' religions and got nowhere. Then I moved into Islam, but I decided I was getting more out of their art and architecture than anything else. I went back into Christianity and looked at all the small sects and things. Went to the Salvation Army Church. Got into the Mennonites and 'headcovering' churches like Charity Christian Fellowship. Decided to try Judaism for a while, but just couldn't get into it. I studied everything I could get my hands on. I sat and talked to Mormon elders and JW missionaries who came to my door. I thought for a while I might like to be Amish, until I one day realised that it was their lifestyle and not their theology that I found so attractive. I explored Shinto, Taoism, and Buddhism; Theravada, Mahayana, Tibetan, reading the works of the Dalai Lama and studying the exquisite devotional art traditions of Tibet. I never got into Zen because it just seems a bit too much like algebra to me. This search was continuous-from 1988 through 2000, from one to another without any stopping in between.  I found the Hare Krishnas online in 2000. Remembering highschool, I went and started reading. I didn't understand a thing I read! It seemed to me that they must be crazy! But somehow or other I kept reading. There was a picture that had a particularly strong draw for me; it kept bringing me back again and again to read more. (This picture is of Sri Sri Radha Ksira-cora Gopinatha in Toronto. Specifically it was Radharani who brought me back.)  After a while I spoke with some very nice devotees who were able to clear up some of my confusion.   I helped out with a webpage they were building (I transcribed the entire bhakta handbook and most of the recipes in Adiraja's cookbook for them) and while I was typing up the information and translating it into HTML, I finally began to understand. Suddenly it was all crystal clear. It was as if I was reading the information again for the first time. And I realised that all the answers I had ever had questions for, were right here in front of me.  It was about that time (summer 2000) I began to chant on a regular basis. In around December of 2000 I got involved in the Dharmapatni group and started emailing with Mandakini, who lives in Hillsborough. Even though I was chanting and convinced about KC, I was still afraid to go to the temple. It was a very spur of the moment decision on Easter Sunday 2001 that I decided to drive up, completely without warning, out of the blue. When I got there and met Mandakini, she said, oh you won't believe, a very senior devotee is visiting today for the very first time ever! I had no idea when I left the house that anything special was happening that day at New Goloka, but as it turns out, that day was Indradyumna Swami's first visit to the temple there as well as mine.  So basically by the end of that day I was ready to move into the temple. By that time, I had a pretty good grasp on things, and even knew the Nrsimha prayers and Srila Prabhupada's pranams, and the Panchatattva mantra when we were having kirtan. I had never experienced anything before personally, but from having read and heard (totally through books, tapes and the internet) I was able to feel pretty comfortable with things as they happened, and had a clue what was going on. So it felt familiar. Everyone was so friendly and wonderful and I was really engaged in the kirtan and seeing the Deities for the first time in person. I didn't want to go home and I think I even cried thinking that I did have to go home. (If I hadn't been married, I would have stayed.)  Over the next 6 months I was chanting and praying really hard and finally came to the point where I wrote to Maharaj a very long letter (with basically the story of my life in it) asking for him to accept me. And he did. There is sort of a weird situation also attached to that-Mandakini really wanted me to talk to Bir Krsna Goswami before I made any decisions, which I also thought was a great idea, but it seemed like every time I came to the temple, he wasn't there. It happened so frequently that it almost became like a joke, and to this day, I've only had one very short conversation with him, and that was this year. This was really part of me coming to the conclusion that Krsna was pushing me in a specific direction insofar as finding the spiritual master. In my whole life, I think some of the most sincere praying I've ever done were those months prior to coming to the temple, when I would sit outside in my swing and chant and really beg, please let me know if this is the truth, I have been searching for so many years now and I really, really need to find out what's real. So when I came to the temple and found Maharaj there, also for the very first time ever, it seemed to me to be kind of an explicit statement from Krsna, here you go, here's your answer. That's how I took it, anyway.  I was finally initiated on April 24, 2003.   urlLink

      My diet's been sabotaged by the twin demons of WHITE PIZZA and BREYERS CREAMY CHOCOLATE.  I'm working on pulling it back together here.    Last night at work we had a good night.  I had an office night, amazingly enough.  But when I got there I got a call from the big boss, who wanted to know, could I stay late in the morning for a meeting in her office?  Well, naturally that kind of thing freaks me out and makes me paranoid.  I spent all night in varying degrees of worrying about it.  It didn't help that it was first-day-back and I was going on just the barest minimums of sleep (like today: 3.5 hours).  Anyway, she was late coming to our meeting and I just about fell asleep in front of her office, but once she got there we had a really good talk discussing everything behind my wanting to transfer, and what the outlook is for getting that fixed, and might I want to stick around until the new manager comes in and see if that doesn't change things.  Well, you know, I don't really have a plan right now about transferring, since the one place turned me down flat without even an interview and the other really hasn't got a position available.  So my plan-and-contingency-plan is now no plan at all.  So I guess I am going to be sticking around, at least for the time being, and I guess whether I want to or not I'm going to be seeing how things change when the new manager comes in.  I got a call from Meredith at American Mobile, who says that Duke has my application in their hands.  I have a weird feeling I'm not going to be travelling after all.  Not because they won't want me, but because we just have a lot to do here and I can't really be here and there at the same time.  I do think I'll end up there before Scott does, but in a different way than we had originally planned with travelling.  I had fleetingly entertained thoughts of going to Detroit for Rathayatra, but I don't think Scott will want me jumping on a plane to go there.  I'm going to Charleston for a couple of days end of this month with Anne, and the plane tickets to Detroit are about $250.00.  That's probably money we should be saving at this point.  Maybe I can go next year.  Where I'd rather go is Toronto, but we'll see how it all works out.  One other thing I mentioned was that I was willing to work weird hours and shifts.  Specifically, 7PM to 3AM.  I wonder if that'll ever come about.  I think that'd be just slam bam perfect for me at this point.  Only time will tell now what's going to happen with everything.    There are some neighhbourhood kids running around in our yard today.  I feel like someone ought to tell them and their bare feet that our lawn is home to the third largest colony of fire ants on the planet, but on the other hand, if they want to run around in our yard badly enough, they'll find out eventually.    urlLink

      A 300-pound black bear was found dead Tuesday after it wandered onto Interstate 40 near Rocky Point and was struck by a vehicle.  It was the second time in about two weeks that a black bear was killed on the interstate in the region. A 2-year-old black bear estimated to weigh 175 pounds was found in the median near Wallace on May 15, about 20 miles away.  N.C. Wildlife officials said Wednesday that black bears are roaming around this time of the year for several reasons, including that young males born in early 2003 now are being driven out of the mothers’ home range to make room for other cubs.  Mark Jones, a wildlife black bear project leader, said there are about 7,000 black bears in the coastal region and about 75 of the animals are killed each year in vehicle collisions. He said it’s not clear how many have been killed this year.  The two men said N.C. Wildlife is working with the state Department of Transportation to build underpasses under new roads to provide safe crossings for bears and other wild animals.    urlLink

      The title of this post really refers to two things.  One, I'm about to launch into a three-day stretch at work, and two, we've officially begun to pack for the move.  Yes.  I know this is crazy given the fact that the house isn't even on the market.  We're doing it anyway.  Everything will be boxed and ready to go long before this house is sold or probably even considered by the first buyer.  I'll just be keeping out enough stuff to live with.  The story with yesterday's interview is a little more disheartening.  It turns out the position isn't a real position-it's what they call an 'overhire' position.  This is when they deliberately hire more people than they need, counting on attrition of new grads to bring the ultimate number back where it ought to be.  So the manager (who, by the way, I worked side-by-side with when she was a coordinator up here on six) isn't sure she wants to put an experienced (expensive) nurse into a position that could potentially be an overhired position that she really doesn't need but will still have to pay for.  Can't say as I blame her.  However, despite the fact that we went ahead with the interview, it means that I'm staying where I'm at for the time being.  I will, however, continue to look on the postings and see what comes up.  The situation with the potential new manager is looking good.  They're making her an offer, and hopefully she'll accept it.  Maybe things will change once she comes in-who knows?  I certainly won't like cardiac any better, but maybe all of the surrounding features that have been the real driving force to get me off the floor will change.  I don't know.  I certainly don't know the reason (cosmically speaking) that I'm being kept on the sixth floor for the time being, but there must be one.  I don't like it very much, but there isn't a whole lot I can do.  For now all I can see to do is be patient and see what happens.  Either way, we won't be here a whole lot longer, certainly any longer than we have to be, so I'm not in a complete panic over it.  Things will work out.. they always do.  The day looks rather gloomy today.  This year's hurricane season is supposed to be exceptionally active.  Here's what  urlLink Dr. Gray  (the guru of hurricane forecasting) has to say:   Information obtained through May 2004 indicates that the 2004 Atlantic hurricane season will be an active one. We estimate that 2004 will have about 8 hurricanes (average is 5.9), 14 named storms (average is 9.6), 60 named storm days (average is 49), 35 hurricane days (average is 24.5), 3 intense (category 3-4-5) hurricanes (average is 2.3), 8 intense hurricane days (average is 5.0) and a Hurricane Destruction Potential (HDP) of 100 (average is 71). We expect Atlantic basin Net Tropical Cyclone (NTC) activity in 2004 to be about 145 percent of the long-term average. The probability of U.S. major hurricane landfall is estimated to be 40 percent above the long-period average. This late May forecast is based on a newly-devised extended range statistical forecast procedure which utilizes 52 years of past global reanalysis data.    So now is a good time to get ready for hurricane season.  We have another six months to go.   urlLink

      NoI 2: One's devotional service is spoiled when he becomes too entangled in the following six activities: (1) eating more than necessary or collecting more funds than required; (2) overendeavoring for mundane things that are very difficult to obtain; (3) talking unnecessarily about mundane subject matters; (4) Practicing the scriptural rules and regulations only for the sake of following them and not for the sake of spiritual advancement, or rejecting the rules and regulations of the scriptures and working independently or whimsically; (5) associating with worldly-minded persons who are not interested in Kṛṣṇa consciousness; and (6) being greedy for mundane achievements.  NoI 3: There are six principles favorable to the execution of pure devotional service: (1) being enthusiastic, (2) endeavoring with confidence, (3) being patient, (4) acting according to regulative principles (such as śravaṇaḿ kīrtanaḿ viṣṇoḥ smaraṇam [SB 7.5.23] — hearing, chanting and remembering Kṛṣṇa), (5) abandoning the association of nondevotees, and (6) following in the footsteps of the previous ācāryas. These six principles undoubtedly assure the complete success of pure devotional service.   urlLink

      Bhagavad-gītā As It Is 18.48  saha-jaḿ karma kaunteya sa-doṣam api na tyajet sarvārambhā hi doṣeṇa dhūmenāgnir ivāvṛtāḥ  TRANSLATION  Every endeavor is covered by some fault, just as fire is covered by smoke. Therefore one should not give up the work born of his nature, O son of Kuntī, even if such work is full of fault.  PURPORT  In conditioned life, all work is contaminated by the material modes of nature. Even if one is a brāhmaṇa, he has to perform sacrifices in which animal killing is necessary. Similarly, a kṣatriya, however pious he may be, has to fight enemies. He cannot avoid it. Similarly, a merchant, however pious he may be, must sometimes hide his profit to stay in business, or he may sometimes have to do business on the black market. These things are necessary; one cannot avoid them. Similarly, even though a man is a śūdra serving a bad master, he has to carry out the order of the master, even though it should not be done. Despite these flaws, one should continue to carry out his prescribed duties, for they are born out of his own nature.  A very nice example is given herein. Although fire is pure, still there is smoke. Yet smoke does not make the fire impure. Even though there is smoke in the fire, fire is still considered to be the purest of all elements. If one prefers to give up the work of a kṣatriya and take up the occupation of a brāhmaṇa, he is not assured that in the occupation of a brāhmaṇa there are no unpleasant duties. One may then conclude that in the material world no one can be completely free from the contamination of material nature. This example of fire and smoke is very appropriate in this connection. When in wintertime one takes a stone from the fire, sometimes smoke disturbs the eyes and other parts of the body, but still one must make use of the fire despite disturbing conditions. Similarly, one should not give up his natural occupation because there are some disturbing elements. Rather, one should be determined to serve the Supreme Lord by his occupational duty in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. That is the perfectional point. When a particular type of occupation is performed for the satisfaction of the Supreme Lord, all the defects in that particular occupation are purified. When the results of work are purified, when connected with devotional service, one becomes perfect in seeing the self within, and that is self-realization.   urlLink

      So I got to my parents' house today and the first words out of my mother's mouth were not hello or how are you, but: "You look like a Jew.  You look like a Hassidic Jew."  To which I replied, "Well, this scarf came from Jerusalem, so that's a pretty good call."  Now, first off, before you go any further in this post, you have to get past any idea that this post is any kind of prejudice.  It isn't.  All right.  Carry on.   So my mother was referring to the scarf I had on my head.  Lots of cultures and religions cover their women's heads.  In fact, basically anywhere you go around the world, you'll find this: in Christian, Muslim, Jewish and Hindu communities alike.  I don't know off the top of my head about Buddhists, but I don't think it matters to them.  Anyway, I wasn't really making a cultural or religious statement by wearing a scarf on my head.  I like how it looks.  At the same time, it is considered a modest statement (and if you're Christian, at least, a submissive statement) to cover one's head.  So I win on all three counts, even though I'm not a Christian.  Which brings me to my next point.  Why limit yourself to one culture or one stereotype?  I was born in New York City, which is itself an amalgam of so many cultures, I can't list them all.  Why not just take what you like from where ever you find it, and put it together?  That's what I do.  I'm as likely to wear a Bengali sari as I am an African daishiki, or a Mennonite cape dress, or a Kuwaiti jilbab, or an Israeli head scarf.  I'm just as likely to be wearing some rag of a denim dress I got at Walmart.  The point is, I wear what I like.  I pick and choose from an unlimited array of styles and statements to make something uniquely my own.  People, for some reason, find this unnerving.  I think it upsets them that they can't find a way to categorise or stereotype me.  I refuse to be stereotyped.  People miss out when they limit themselves.  Have you ever had some serious Jewish home cooking?  How about Greek pastries dripping with honey?  Germans can cook, too.. I spent twenty years looking for a recipe for a bread called "studen".  I finally found it, thanks to a lady from Bavaria.  Have you ever had basmati, golden with turmeric and fragrant with ginger and spices?  Or hot chilies, pickled in mustard oil and spices, hot as fire and incredibly flavourful.  How about even in our own country?  Have you ever had okra, fried til it's just golden and perfect, or bagels straight from Manhattan with cream cheese half an inch thick?  Have you ever eaten Cajun food?  Have you ever had grits?  If you grew up in the south, have you ever had farina, which is the Yankee version of grits? Have you ever eaten something you can't even identify, and said, "Damn, this is good.  What is it?"   When you limit yourself, the only one who loses is you.  There is a whole huge world out there, and so many things you won't ever have the opportunity to learn or enjoy, if you don't take a step forward.  So me, despite the fact that yes, I might be a 'fashion 911' and I might be considered weird or whatever.. I have always tried to explore outside my own little world, and take from what I've found those things I like the best.  On any given day, I might look like an Anglo east Indian, in a sari, or maybe a Mennonite housewife, or a Hassidic Jewish woman, or perhaps a Muslim woman.  In reality, I'm a sixth-generation American, Gaudiya Vaisnavi, chanting Hare Krishna, detached from other people's perceptions of me, and doing it my way.  I don't care what you think of me, and I promise you, you'll never find a stereotype I fit.  You can't categorise me.  I follow my Guru's instructions, and I follow the rules and regulations of my spiritual practice.  But don't try and fit me into some pigeonhole, because you can't.  There's worth to be found and good to be had everywhere, if only you can get past your own self and your own fears to look.  Which is why I said right in the beginning that this post isn't about prejudice.  It's the farthest thing from prejudice: it's looking at all cultures, races, practices, and civilisations equally, and taking from each to create something that is above and beyond, that can't be categorised, and that transcends everything to be uniquely yourself.  Let go of your fears and give it a try. urlLink

      I went to see my beloved doctor yesterday.  Unfortunately, he was slammed, and I ended up having to see his NP.  I don't like female doctors, and an NP or PA fits in the 'doctor' category for me when I am in the 'patient' category.  So it didn't make things really easy for me.  Since I have no gross neurological deficits and my EKG showed normal sinus rhythm, the determination is that I'm stressed out (surprise!) and she told me to 'go have some fun'.  What?  WHAT?  Send me home with an anti-inflammatory for a headache that 800mg of Aleve can't fix and an order to go have some fun???   Now you look here.  I went in there and told her I was completely stressed out.  I told her what my life was like at this current moment.  I explained everything-that I'm not sleeping, that I'm strung like piano wire.  Go have some fun???  What I needed was something to take the edge off until things slow down a little.  I swear, even when you know what you're talking about, you can't get what you need.  I did get a refill on my Ritalin prescription.  And I ordered some kava-kava.  It was a damn sight more expensive than a 30 day scrip for Xanax or Ativan would have been.  On the other hand.. well, I don't know if kava is addictive.  Future studies will probably show that it is, and then the FDA will start growing it themselves or something.   I'm kinda pissed that I have to do this myself and they couldn't give me a simple scrip to get me through the most stressful time I've had since Scott and I were seperated.  Yesterday's house inspection was the equivalent of pushing bamboo under my fingernails.  We haven't heard anything from them since, so maybe they are going to change their minds about buying the house.  Strangely, Scott is cooler at this point than he has been through the whole endeavour.  I just want someone to give me a bit of a break and let me breathe for a while.  Everything's been going awfully fast, and now I just want it to be done with.  If the house isn't going to sell now... this means.. we have to go through this crap all over again. urlLink

      I made this recipe today with apples that came directly off the trees.  I also made it using a loaf pan instead of a pie pan.  Use what you like.  I was kinda stressed out at the time and initially it was going to be a cobbler, but it became a pie.  First get your apples.  About six or so, depends on how big they are.  Peel them and cut them into pieces.  Put lemon juice on them and they won't brown.  Then make your pie crust.  Don't over-handle it or it'll be tough.  Fannie Farmer has a good recipe.  Basically, two cups of flour, third cup of ice cold water, half cup of shortening.  Use butter.  It makes a difference.  Half teaspoon of salt.  Cut your butter in and then add the water.  Mix with a fork til you get a dough.  Divide in half.  Roll out the bottom half, lay in your greased pan, prick with a fork and bake for about six minutes at 350.   Then load up the apples.  Every time you put in a layer of apples, sprinkle cinnamon and brown sugar, and dot with butter.  Repeat this until you get the pan full.  At the very top, dot with butter, sprinkle over a few crushed cloves, and then drizzle (SECRET INGREDIENT!) about three tablespoons of maple syrup over.  Roll out the other half of your pie crust and seal.  Prick the top so steam can get out.  Bake at 425 for ten minutes, then reduce the heat to 350 and bake for about 40 more, until it looks done.  Let it cool and offer to Krsna. urlLink

      I think all this stress is finally catching up to me on a physicial level.&nbsp; Last night, I ended up coming home from work because I was having some persistent dizziness.&nbsp; Not just, 'ooh, head rush' dizzy, but 'ooh I think I'm about to fall over' dizzy.&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, I've had a persistent headache behind my right ear for about three or four days now that isn't responding to large quantities of Aleve.&nbsp; I really debated for a while going down to the ER and letting House Staff have a whack at me.&nbsp; They would have admitted me, no doubt-I could practically tell you what kinds of orders they'd write.&nbsp; It would have been one enormously expensive workup, is a fact.&nbsp; Instead, I opted to come home, and today, after the inspection is done, I'm going to go over to Kramer's and see what he can do for me.  Personally, I think my body is just saying: 'hello, there's a truckload of stress in your life, you're not sleeping, you're freaking out, it's time to calm down or we do it for you.'&nbsp; This whole house thing has been really hard on me.&nbsp; Unlike Scott, who is the Marlboro Man and reminiscent of the Black "Taint but a flesh wound" Knight, I acknowledge when my body isn't doing what it should be.&nbsp; He's terrible like that.&nbsp; No mercy whatsoever, not for himself and certainly not for me.&nbsp; I used to get sick a lot when I worked at the nursing home.&nbsp; We later found out it was because of the incredible amounts of mold and mildew in the wallpaper (I haven't had one respiratory infection since I left there), but at the time, when I'd get sick, I'd be desperately ill, and he'd be saying: "Quit whining!&nbsp; It's just a cold!"&nbsp; On more&nbsp;than one occasion that 'cold' was pneumonia.&nbsp; So you see how he is.&nbsp; This attitude of his is really not very good.&nbsp; He inherited it, and it's been known to kill-by the time Mr. Macho admits he's sick, it's too late to do anything about it.&nbsp; And he doesn't believe in preventative health care or checkups.&nbsp; And, on top of this, is the prevailing mentality that I'm not a nurse, I'm his wife.  So I've got some challenges there.&nbsp; Me, I am not a crybaby.&nbsp; Don't forget I had a broken ankle for THREE MONTHS before I went to the doctor.&nbsp; And I'm not talking some hairline crack, either-it was a 96% ligament tear and the bone fragments were an inch away from the distal end of the bone that had broken.&nbsp; I walked, worked, and drove on this for three months with nothing more than tylenol, an ace bandage, and a limp.&nbsp; I had to have surgery to put it all back together.&nbsp; So I don't buy any accusations of being a crybaby.&nbsp; At the same time, I understand the need to acknowledge when my body is telling me something is wrong.  So something's going on.&nbsp; The obvious answer is the incredible amount of stress I've been under for the last couple of months.&nbsp; Scott's been under stress too-he isn't sleeping very well.&nbsp; But he doesn't want any help for that, stubborn thing, so he can just handle it himself.&nbsp; Me, once it's interfering with work, I'm going to get things addressed.  I anticipate being out from work at least for tonight if not for a few days. urlLink

      A kid got chewed up by a shark down in Carolina Beach yesterday.&nbsp; That's about twenty miles or so from here.&nbsp; According to my mom, who is a lot more up on the news than I am, the local media is doing the big hush-hush thing about it so that the local tourist trade doesn't see any negative impact.  Now I'm sorry.&nbsp; That's just wrong.&nbsp; People need to know this kind of thing.&nbsp; If some teenage kid gets gnawed on in three feet of water (which it was, three feet of water), people have the right to know.&nbsp; Now not to mention that off all the piers around here, the fishermen are chumming.&nbsp; Chumming the water, with people swimming right there.&nbsp; Now, am I the only person who saw that Discovery Channel commercial that says a shark can smell ONE DROP of blood in the water from half a mile away?&nbsp; Would it not make sense to keep the chum well away and downstream from the swimmers?&nbsp; Am I missing some kind of logic that says it's okay to toss bloody fish guts in the water with the kids on their inflatable tubes and their body boards?&nbsp; Who's in charge of this crap?  Not even to mention that there's at least two or three drownings every year in the rip.&nbsp; Are they really making that information well known?&nbsp; Do people actually know what that little red flag means on the beach?&nbsp; Rip currents are deadly, and there's a huge history of drownings in this area due to just that.&nbsp; Why isn't this stuff more publicized?  You know the answer to that as well as I do.&nbsp; Money.&nbsp; I keep getting flashbacks to "Jaws", where the mayor didn't want anyone to know what was going on.&nbsp;   Then you have the opposite camp, the group of people that uses things like this as an excuse to go kill sharks.&nbsp; Let me just voice my opinion on this one time.&nbsp; Once you get in the water, you forfeit any superiority you might possibly have had on land.&nbsp; There's no difference between you, a grouper, a baby harp seal, or a five hundred pound tuna.&nbsp; You're lunch.&nbsp; A shark doesn't discriminate.&nbsp; And once you step into their world, you have no right to complain or to expect special treatment.&nbsp; Get out of the water.  All that being said, it still isn't fair for the political powers-that-be to withhold this kind of information or water it down in any way, shape or form.&nbsp;   Tourists, educate yourselves.&nbsp; We live at the confluence of the Cape Fear River with the Atlantic Ocean, just off the Gulf Stream.&nbsp; The water here gets into the mid-eighties, bringing sharks.. and hurricanes.. straight into Wilmington.&nbsp; The rip currents are vicious due to the river's currents, and both boating and swimming can be treacherous.&nbsp; Be warned.&nbsp; Because nobody else is going to tell you, it seems, besides me. urlLink

      The essence of all advice is that one should utilize one's full time -- twenty-four hours a day -- in nicely chanting and remembering the Lord's divine name, transcendental form, qualities and eternal pastimes, thereby gradually engaging one's tongue and mind. In this way one should reside in  urlLink Vraja  [ urlLink Goloka   urlLink Vrindavana   urlLink dhama ] and serve  urlLink Krishna  under the guidance of devotees. One should follow in the footsteps of the Lord's beloved devotees, who are deeply attached to His devotional service. PURPORT Since the mind may be one's enemy or one's friend, one has to train the mind to become his friend. The  urlLink Krishna  consciousness movement is especially meant for training the mind to be always engaged in  urlLink Krishna 's business. The mind contains hundreds and thousands of impressions, not only of this life but also of many, many lives of the past. These impressions sometimes come in contact with one another and produce contradictory pictures. In this way the mind's function can become dangerous for a conditioned soul. Students of psychology are aware of the mind's various psychological changes. In Bhagavad- urlLink gita  ( 8.6 ) it is said:  urlLink yam   urlLink yam   urlLink vapi   urlLink smaran   urlLink bhavam  tyajaty  urlLink ante   urlLink kalevaram   urlLink tam   urlLink tam  evaiti  urlLink kaunteya   urlLink sada   urlLink tad - urlLink bhava - urlLink bhavitah  "Whatever state of being one remembers when he quits his body, that state he will attain without fail." At the time of death, the mind and intelligence of a living entity create the subtle form of a certain type of body for the next life. If the mind suddenly thinks of something not very congenial, one has to take a corresponding birth in the next life. On the other hand, if one can think of  urlLink Krishna  at the time of death, he can be transferred to the spiritual world,  urlLink Goloka   urlLink Vrindavana . This process of transmigration is very subtle; therefore  urlLink Srila   urlLink Rupa  Gosvami advises devotees to train their minds in order that they will be unable to remember anything other than  urlLink Krishna . Similarly, the tongue should be trained to speak only of  urlLink Krishna  and to taste only  urlLink krishna - urlLink prasada .  urlLink Srila   urlLink Rupa  Gosvami further advises,  urlLink tishthan   urlLink vraje : one should live in  urlLink Vrindavana  or any part of Vrajabhumi. Vrajabhumi, or the land of  urlLink Vrindavana , is supposed to be eighty-four krosas in area. One  urlLink krosa  equals two square miles. When one makes  urlLink Vrindavana  his residence, he should take shelter of an advanced devotee there. In this way one should always think of  urlLink Krishna  and His pastimes. This is further elucidated by  urlLink Srila   urlLink Rupa  Gosvami in his  urlLink Bhakti - urlLink rasamrita - urlLink sindhu  ( 1.2.294 ):  urlLink krishnam   urlLink smaran   urlLink janam  casya  urlLink preshtham   urlLink nija - urlLink samihitam   urlLink tat - urlLink tat - urlLink katha -ratas casau kuryad  urlLink vasam   urlLink vraje   urlLink sada  "A devotee should always reside in the transcendental realm of  urlLink Vraja  and always engage in  urlLink krishnam   urlLink smaran   urlLink janam  casya  urlLink preshtham , the remembrance of  urlLink Sri   urlLink Krishna  and His beloved associates. By following in the footsteps of such associates and by entering under their eternal guidance, one can acquire an intense desire to serve the Supreme Personality of Godhead." Again  urlLink Srila   urlLink Rupa  Gosvami states in  urlLink Bhakti - urlLink rasamrita - urlLink sindhu  ( 1.2.295 ):  urlLink seva   urlLink sadhaka - urlLink rupena   urlLink siddha - urlLink rupena  catra  urlLink hi   urlLink tad - urlLink bhava - urlLink lipsuna   urlLink karya   urlLink vraja -lokanusaratah "In the transcendental realm of  urlLink Vraja  [ urlLink Vraja - urlLink dhama ] one should serve the Supreme Lord,  urlLink Sri   urlLink Krishna , with a feeling similar to that of His associates, and one should place himself under the direct guidance of a particular associate of  urlLink Krishna  and should follow in his footsteps. This method is applicable both in the stage of  urlLink sadhana  [spiritual practices executed while in the stage of bondage] and in the stage of  urlLink sadhya  [God realization], when one is a  urlLink siddha - urlLink purusha , or a spiritually perfect soul."  urlLink Srila  Bhaktisiddhanta  urlLink Sarasvati   urlLink Thakura  has commented as follows upon this verse: "One who has not yet developed interest in  urlLink Krishna  consciousness should give up all material motives and train his mind by following the progressive regulative principles, namely chanting and remembering  urlLink Krishna  and His name, form, quality, pastimes and so forth. In this way, after developing a taste for such things, one should try to live in  urlLink Vrindavana  and pass his time constantly remembering  urlLink Krishna 's name, fame, pastimes and qualities under the direction and protection of an expert devotee. This is the sum and substance of all instruction regarding the cultivation of devotional service. "In the neophyte stage one should always engage in hearing  urlLink krishna - urlLink katha . This is called  urlLink sravana - urlLink dasa , the stage of hearing. By constantly hearing the transcendental holy name of  urlLink Krishna  and hearing of His transcendental form, qualities and pastimes, one can attain to the stage of acceptance called  urlLink varana - urlLink dasa . When one attains this stage, he becomes attached to the hearing of  urlLink krishna - urlLink katha . When one is able to chant in ecstasy, he attains the stage of smaranavastha, the stage of remembering. Recollection, absorption, meditation, constant remembrance and trance are the five items of progressive  urlLink krishna - urlLink smarana . At first, remembrance of  urlLink Krishna  may be interrupted at intervals, but later remembrance proceeds uninterrupted. When remembrance is uninterrupted, it becomes concentrated and is called meditation. When meditation expands and becomes constant, it is called  urlLink anusmriti . By uninterrupted and unceasing  urlLink anusmriti  one enters the stage of  urlLink samadhi , or spiritual trance. After  urlLink smarana - urlLink dasa  or  urlLink samadhi  has fully developed, the soul comes to understand his original constitutional position. At that time he can perfectly and clearly understand his eternal relationship with  urlLink Krishna . That is called  urlLink sampatti - urlLink dasa , the perfection of life. " urlLink Caitanya - urlLink caritamrita  advises those who are neophytes to give up all kinds of motivated desires and simply engage in the regulative devotional service of the Lord according to the directions of scripture. In this way a neophyte can gradually develop attachment for  urlLink Krishna 's name, fame, form, qualities and so forth. When one has developed such attachment, he can spontaneously serve the lotus feet of  urlLink Krishna  even without following the regulative principles. This stage is called  urlLink raga - urlLink bhakti , or devotional service in spontaneous love. At that stage the devotee can follow in the footsteps of one of the eternal associates of  urlLink Krishna  in  urlLink Vrindavana . This is called  urlLink raganuga - urlLink bhakti .  urlLink Raganuga - urlLink bhakti , or spontaneous devotional service, can be executed in the  urlLink santa - urlLink rasa  when one aspires to be like  urlLink Krishna 's cows or the stick or flute in the hand of  urlLink Krishna , or the flowers around  urlLink Krishna 's neck. In the  urlLink dasya - urlLink rasa  one follows in the footsteps of servants like Citraka, Patraka or Raktaka. In the friendly  urlLink sakhya - urlLink rasa  one can become a friend like  urlLink Baladeva ,  urlLink Sridama  or  urlLink Sudama . In the  urlLink vatsalya - urlLink rasa , characterized by parental affection, one can become like  urlLink Nanda   urlLink Maharaja  and  urlLink Yasoda , and in the  urlLink madhurya - urlLink rasa , characterized by conjugal love, one can become like  urlLink Srimati  Radharani or Her lady friends such as  urlLink Lalita  and Her serving maids (manjaris) like  urlLink Rupa  and  urlLink Rati . This is the essence of all instruction in the matter of devotional service."  urlLink

      Seems like for some unknown reason, Scott and I have got past that wave of terror about the whole house thing that we had last week.&nbsp; After we went and saw Mark, our cute, but rather young and nervous lawyer, we came home and had a word of prayer.&nbsp; Somehow or other, that bit of a talk we had has managed to get us through all our fears.&nbsp; I'm here to tell you, by the time we got out of Mark's office, I was ready to pitch the whole thing, but Scott was having none of that.&nbsp; He just has a more well-developed sense of ethics and morals than most people, including myself.&nbsp; It doesn't matter to him if the agreement is spit and a handshake-he's not going back on what he said that day about selling them our house for X price.&nbsp; It wouldn't even matter to him if they were trying to rip us off or scam us-he is going to stand by his word.&nbsp; I admire him for this, and I love him for it, but I do think it gets his feelings hurt with unhappy regularity.&nbsp; So we've decided that if for some bizarre reason we ever find ourselves masochistic enough to want to sell ANOTHER house.. I will take care of it.&nbsp; I'm just more of a hardass in some ways, despite the fact that he rules the house and I'm a completely submissive person when it comes to him.  Anyway, now that we've gotten past the cold feet, the contract's been signed, and all we're waiting for is the lease contract.&nbsp; The closing date is August 16, and we'll have a six month lease from that date.&nbsp; In that time we need to choose and buy property and have our new home built.&nbsp; I don't think it'll be that big of a deal.&nbsp; I've found four pieces of property that fit our requirements.&nbsp; One is just a couple of miles from the house we couldn't buy.&nbsp; So probably within two weeks of us closing, we'll be out looking at property, and getting all that underway as quickly as possible.&nbsp; We have already chosen a floor plan and a builder, and have even worked out most of the details of what we'd like and not like in the new house.&nbsp; If all goes according to plan, I should be up there with the dog in late November.&nbsp; Scott will come up on weekends and bring stuff up slowly, and finally move up in February.&nbsp;   We're both getting really excited.  urlLink

I just finished talking to the cops.&nbsp; They can't do anything with him not there, unfortunately.&nbsp; But if I'm willing to call them the minute he gets home, they will be happy to come out and give him a final warning.&nbsp; The tickets from there start at $100.00, then $300.00, then $500.00.&nbsp; Oh, how I would love to see that happen between now and the time we get out of here.&nbsp;   In the meantime, I have to suck it up, but this is some evil bad karma here, and Cracker is going to get cheesed before it's all said and done.  urlLink

      I got called a "cold hearted hussy" last night by the family of one of my patients.&nbsp; The reason?&nbsp; Enforcing a hospital policy that states visitors may not stay overnight in a semiprivate room.  Cussing me or any nurse out does not get you one bit closer to getting what you want.&nbsp; We are not impressed.&nbsp; The hospital is not the Hilton.&nbsp; We are not here to give you 'what you want'.. we are here to provide quality medical care.&nbsp; If you get in the way of that, you need to go.&nbsp; The hospital is not the Hilton-we are not here to facilitate your drug addiction or your fetish.&nbsp; If you are well enough to have sex in your hospital bed, you are well enough to go home.&nbsp; We take care of between four to seven other patients just as demanding as you are, so your request for chocolate ice cream is going to be prioritised along with everything else that nurse has to do.&nbsp; Someone in respiratory difficulty is going to be seen to first.&nbsp; Don't expect it to be otherwise.  We are doing the best we can.&nbsp; Abusing us is not going to make us respect you any more or move any quicker.&nbsp; Abusing us is just going to piss us off.&nbsp; Have a little respect for your nurse, and understand what our goals and priorities are.&nbsp; We don't cuss you out for peeing on the floor or tearing your IV out.&nbsp; Don't cuss us out for doing our jobs.  urlLink

      I'm tired and not sleeping well.&nbsp; But life, as it does, moves on regardless, and we are still looking at closing on August 16th, and moving on with things.&nbsp; After long discussion and thought, I had to get past the denial, and admit that the beautiful, incredible, magnificent house and property we went to go see was just too expensive and too intensive a project for us to take on.&nbsp; The house had some major structural issues, and despite the fact that the property was absolutely gorgeous, the price put everything way out of reach.&nbsp; Not to mention that in all seriousness, once you start talking about ground floor joists, you're basically talking about knocking down the house.&nbsp; So&nbsp;it looks like a decision's been made: instead of make an old house new-make a new house old.&nbsp; We're going to buy some property, put a new house on it, and then make that house look like it's been there for a hundred years, without the termites and the roly-poly floors.   It won't be QUITE the same, no, but I think it's the best solution we can come up with that satisfies everyone.&nbsp; Besides that, with building, we're able to get things exactly the way we want them, and make sure that we each have the things that are important to us.&nbsp; And we'll have the security of knowing that everything's new, nothing leaks, and there aren't any termites under the floor.&nbsp; And maybe, if we have a really interesting little piece of property, I'll find some good areas to dig-and who knows what then? urlLink     And  bonus points  if you know what book I've quoted in the title of this post.

      We have an appointment tomorrow to go see the lawyer about the whole selling-the-house thing.&nbsp; I heard a rumour that once they buy the house, they're going to get rid of my beloved apple trees in the front yard. &nbsp; I love my apple trees.&nbsp; In all the years I've had them there, I've never sprayed them or used any kind of pesticide.&nbsp; I don't fertilise them, either.&nbsp; I just go out and ask them to make some nice apples for Krishna and Radharani, and off they go.&nbsp; Yeah.&nbsp; I know you're thinking, 'all right, she's psychotic..' but I'm just saying.&nbsp; So there are my apple trees, two of them, a Granny Smith and a Jonathan, giving up a bushel of apples between the two of them, perfect, wormless, bugless, bruiseless,  organic &nbsp;apples.&nbsp; And they're both dwarf trees, so to get a yield like that is incredible.&nbsp; But they're going to rip them out.&nbsp; And it's breaking my heart. &nbsp; First of all, why would you rip out a living tree if you didn't have to?&nbsp; Second of all, a fruit tree?? A tree that does nothing but provide you with really good apples for pies, sauce, drying, and eating fresh?&nbsp; Apples in a basket are a wonderful gift and always appreciated.&nbsp; Everyone loves an apple, especially a Granny Smith apple.&nbsp; Birds like to sit in the trees, and rabbits come at night and eat the apples that have fallen.&nbsp; They give nice shade even though they're dwarf trees.&nbsp; Why would anyone want to rip down these trees?&nbsp; I think of all the things anyone could do, except possibly rip out the rosebush I have on the side of the house, this is the worst thing I can imagine.&nbsp; It's really breaking my heart, and I mean that.&nbsp; After all these years that those trees have totally unselfishly done me right every time, their reward is just to get ripped out.&nbsp; I know you think I'm entirely nuts and so on for this, but I don't care what you think.&nbsp; Those are my trees, and we have had a relationship, and I feel like I'm letting them down. &nbsp; Scott is going to ask that they wait til we're gone to take them out, or at the very least, until they stop bearing.. and he's going to suggest that instead of just cutting them down, they get moved into the back yard.&nbsp; We can't protect them beyond that, no matter what we do.&nbsp;  &nbsp; Where ever we end up, the first thing I'm going to do is plant two apples, two pears, two figs, two grapevines (Concord, not muscadine), and a lot of gardenias.&nbsp; You can do that even on a quarter of an acre-in a space that small, you can have a micro-orchard, if you plant dwarf trees.&nbsp; I'd also like to plant blueberries, if the land will support it, and even here, in pre-urban Wilmington, I have wild blackberries.&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; It just occurred to me that maybe we could dig these trees up ourselves if they want them out, and carry them with us.&nbsp; Why should we let someone else rip them out and burn them up?&nbsp; We could prune them back hard once they're finished bearing, and dig them up, wrap the roots and bring them along, and replant them where ever we go.&nbsp; I don't know if they'd survive the transplant shock, but it'd be better than just letting someone cut them down.&nbsp; My mom has a spruce tree that she carried down from New York with her, to Kure Beach, North Carolina, because she refused to let it go, and it's in the front yard just growing like a weed.&nbsp; It's actually been moved twice, because they lived in Carolina Beach before they moved to Kure Beach.&nbsp; So there you go.&nbsp; There's a good idea.&nbsp; That makes me feel better. &nbsp; If you're wondering, I'm not going into details about the house we went to go see.&nbsp; Let's just say it didn't work out, and I had to get myself through some denial to admit it was out of our capacity to sucessfully manage.&nbsp; We are still vacillating between buying and building.&nbsp; There are a couple of houses we still need to investigate before we make a definitive decision. urlLink

      Had to call the cops again tonight.  Our beloved neighbour, Cracker*, was playing his music really loudly-as you know, a normal occurence.  I had just finished calling the cops when he fired up the  leaf blower .  Mind you, it was 2AM.  Why would one be running a leaf blower at that hour?  To blow the dust off the four-wheeler and the Harley!  This truly sent me over the edge as it ran for about ten very long, very loud minutes, and I sat on the front step barefoot and in my nightgown, eating an apple (organic, pesticide-free, from one of my apple trees in the yard) til the cop showed up.  I explained in a (relatively) rational manner that this is a VERY close-laid development and that a leaf blower just isn't appropriate at this hour of the night.  I even mentioned that I work nights and completely understand the being up all night thing.  The cop was a little surprised about the leaf blower, and agreed entirely.  Meanwhile, Cracker, seeing me talking to the cop, was busy rolling all the recreational vehicles, both two and four wheeled, into the garage.  After I'd finished my soliloquy, the cop did go over, park, and spend some time in prayer with him.  So although it won't do any permanent good, and Cracker's just as dumb as he was before, I still feel some sense of justice.  We've been living here almost eleven years.  Cracker has too.  I can tell you one thing, where ever we DO end up, it's going to be quiet. (I am still afraid to say anything about The House being THE House until we actually walk through it.. superstitious me)  In the morning (it IS morning!) I'm calling the real estate people to see if we can get a tour of The House on Sunday.  I am still in some shock and how quickly everything's moving here.  It doesn't quite feel real yet.  We've lived here for all but ten months of our married life.  There's a lot here, and even though I won't be sorry to leave Wilmington, and less sorry to leave Cracker, there's still a lot in this house, and the stress meter is completely redlined over the whole thing.  Some people move every year or even more.. I don't know how they do it.  *name changed because I'd prefer not to admit living next to someone like this  urlLink

      Sent off an application to Person Memorial Hospital in Roxboro today.  Cross your fingers, say a prayer, and give me your blessings, please.  There's a lot of pressure coming down from outside to get the house sold and closed in an enormous hurry, as in two weeks.  No.  That's a bit too much pressure, and I'm not liking it.  Things here are stressful enough.  We're getting a bit snappish around here and I'm not liking that either.  I've discovered Launchcast Radio by Yahoo.  They have this incredible Big Band station that I'm just eating up.  I love Big Band music.. Cab Calloway, Duke Ellington, Louis Armstrong, Tommy Dorsey, Glenn Miller, Doris Day.. and Judy Garland always makes me cry.    And I think I have some kind of a stone trying to pass.  Not a kidney stone-I had my gallbladder out years ago, so I'm thinking it's some kind of common bile duct stone or blockage.  Hurts like hell.  I'm hoping it passes at some not too distant point.  Or at least goes away.  We're going to make an appointment to go look at the house possibly next week or week after.  We really need to get inside to see if it's going to work for us.  Also, we need to get a lawyer.  Things are moving very, very quickly.  Holidays in the new place is looking more and more like a reality now, unless this house for some reason doesn't work out.  Again.. prayers and blessings are requested.  Chant Hare Krishna and be happy.  urlLink

      So we went house shopping today.  First of all, don't trust Mapquest.  We would have been in Tennessee following those directions.   First we went to the house that I've had at the #1 spot on my want list (on Highway 86).  No good.  It's in a terrible location.  We got a call from a very nice real estate agent named Heather, but we were so far out in BFE that we couldn't get cell reception.  Sorry, Heather, but thanks for calling. Then we found the property that was 8.72 acres in Prospect Hill.. I thought it was a nice area, but Scott was making jokes about Leatherface and so on.. so we kept going, and then we found the house on Badgett Sisters Parkway (the 3000 SF one I talked about the other day) and that just wasn't working for us.  So then we were going to find the property with the little schoolhouse on it, but good grief we drove halfway to hell and couldn't find it.  So we decided to go for the last property, which is in Oxford, NC.    We were having some trouble finding the property, so we stopped at the Law Enforcement Center in Roxboro.  I went in to ask for directions, and lo and behold they were going to have one of the cops give us an escort out there so we didn't get lost (have you ever??).  He was eating lunch, so instead, they printed me some directions from Yahoo and gave me their number, and said if we got lost, to call, and they'd send someone out after us.  Have you EVER???  So we got out there.. it's about eleven miles outside of Roxboro.  The mailing address is Oxford, though.  The area is extremely quiet, no streetlights, and it's all farms-horses and cows.  We found the house and I about had a stroke.  It's just absolutely beautiful-built in 1897, 2100 SF with a workshop, a garage, and a barn, on twelve acres.  The house is white, two stories, and the barn is red.  The land is pasture but also has trees on it, and it was just picture-postcard perfect.  Of course, we didn't go in, but we did take some pictures.  I was absolutely raptured over it all, and all the way home I just kept thinking about what it might look like inside.  Tied to all this was some anxiety-what if the house was sold before we were ready?  I just had to think to myself.. don't be attached, it's just a house.. there are others, and Krishna will get everything arranged for us.. even if it takes months..   ..so we got home, and our neighbour across the street, the one who wants to buy our house, came over and said they'd like to close in TWO WEEKS.  I thought it'd be mid-August at the earliest, but it seems like everything's going much quicker than we ever expected it to.   JAI SRI KRSNA!!     urlLink

      Today, my beautiful yellow and blue dining room is painted over white.  And the kitchen has a new lino-tile floor.  It isn't our house anymore.. it's someone else's.. they just haven't paid for it yet.   Weird things continue to happen.  The house is mad at us.  Tomorrow, we go house-shopping.  We found a place in Yanceyville that's almost 3000SF and on ten acres that is looking like it's the prime candidate despite it not being the hundred-year-old farmhouse I've been dreaming about.. we will see if we like it once we see it.  urlLink

      WASHINGTON (Reuters) -- Nurses in U.S. hospitals about 40 percent of the time are working long shifts that raise the risk of medical mistakes such as giving the wrong medication or the wrong dose, a study released Wednesday said.  The likelihood of a hospital nurse making a mistake was three times higher once a shift stretched past 12.5 hours, according to a study published in the journal of Health Affairs.  The study, led by researchers at the University of Pennsylvania, tracked 393 hospital nurses and found about 40 percent of their shifts exceeded 12.5 hours over a four-week period.  Extended nursing shifts are growing more common as hospitals struggle with a shortage of registered nurses. Working more than 40 hours per week or working unscheduled overtime also made errors more likely.  The researchers called for fewer long shifts and less overtime. "Routine use of 12-hour shifts should be curtailed, and overtime -- especially that associated with 12-hour shifts -- should be eliminated," they wrote.  Data on the impact of long nursing shifts have been limited, although many studies have linked sleep-deprived physicians to medical mistakes, the study's lead author said.  "There are over 50 studies of physicians' work schedules, but we have never looked at our largest group of health-care providers, which are registered nurses," Ann Rogers, the study's lead author, said in an interview.  Medication errors Rogers, an associate professor at the University of Pennsylvania's School of Nursing, and colleagues reviewed logbooks from 393 registered nurses throughout the country who worked full time in hospitals. The study analyzed data from 5,317 shifts over a four-week period. The longest shift lasted 23 hours and 40 minutes.  During the 5,317 shifts, there were 199 medical errors. Most were medication errors such as administering the wrong drug or the wrong dose, or giving medication later than scheduled. The study did not assess the impact of the errors on patients.  The nurses also reported 213 near errors, cases in which the nurses caught themselves before they made a mistake.  Working overtime raised the chances of making at least one error, regardless of how long the shift was originally scheduled to last, the study said.  In most cases, overtime was not scheduled in advance, Rogers said. On average, the nurses worked 55 minutes longer than scheduled each day. One-third of the nurses worked overtime every day they worked during the four weeks.  The research was funded by the federal Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, a philanthropy devoted to health issues.  The Institute of Medicine, an independent organization that advises the federal government on medical matters, also has recommended easing nurses' schedules, including limiting their workday to 12 hours.  urlLink

      I worship Govinda, the primeval Lord, who is adept in playing on His flute, with blooming eyes like lotus petals with head decked with peacock's feather, with the figure of beauty tinged with the hue of blue clouds, and His unique loveliness charming millions of Cupids.  PURPORT  The matchless beauty of Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Lord of Goloka, is being described. Kṛṣṇa, the all-pervading cognition, has a spiritual form of His own. The form of Kṛṣṇa is not a fanciful creation of imagination formed after visualizing the beautiful things of the world. What Brahmā saw in his ecstatic trance of pure devotion, is being described. Kṛṣṇa is engaged in playing upon His flute. That flute by his enchanting musical sound attracts the hearts of all living beings. Just as a lotus petal produces a pleasant sight, so the two beautiful eyes of Kṛṣṇa who causes the manifestation of our spiritual vision, display the unlimited splendor and beauty of His moonlike face. The loveliness that adorns His head with peacock feather figures, the corresponding feature of the spiritual beauty of Kṛṣṇa. Just as a mass of blue clouds offers a specifically soothing, pleasant view, the complexion of Kṛṣṇa is analogously tinged with a spiritual dark-blue color. The beauty and loveliness of Kṛṣṇa is far more enchanting that that of Cupid multiplied a millionfold.  urlLink

      I've never been a big fan of 'fashion'.  All my life, I've basically done what I want to do and worn what I want to wear, regardless.  As a result, I don't recall ever being 'fashionable' according to anyone's standards but my own.  Now, I wouldn't be caught dead in a mullet, in hip huggers, or in flares.  But who knew hair scrunchies were out?  I found this out last night. Of course, I had a scrunchie in my hair.  But I think was what made it worse was that the next comment was along the lines of, 'Well, you're old, so it doesn't really matter.'  OLD?  OLD?? Me?? Am I really old?  Am I?  I'm not THAT old.  Certainly I don't look as old as I am.. most people think I'm about 24.  But regardless, I'm getting old enough to be bothered by 'you're old' comments.  And on top of that, I didn't know scrunchies were uncool.  When did that happen?  Is living in the south taking its toll on my fashion radar?    Well, when I think about it further.. I've always done whatever I wanted to do when it came to fashion.  I wore a black tea-length dress to my senior prom in an age where EVERYONE wore floor-length pastels.  (This was a Catholic school, no less-they looked at me as if I were Jezebel herself that night..)  I got my ears pierced multiple times ten years before it was 'in'.  I got tattoos before tattoos were passe.  When I met my husband I was wearing black and white saddle shoes-with neon green laces.  And here in a remote corner of North Carolina, I've been dressing like a Gujarati woman for the last several years now.   Not to mention that it nearly got my ass kicked on one memorable occasion.  I buy native clothes from Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and New Delhi.  I actually own Amish dresses, and have worn them.  So what's fashion to me?  Does this make me a fashion 911?  It might, if you consider going against the trend to be a crime.  My husband, the inveterate individualist, isn't fond of me wearing saris, but I do it anyway, because I like them.. I like how I feel when I wear one, I like how they look.  I wear long Amish dresses and aprons.  I wear Islamic versions of salwar kameez, and Indian versions, because they make me happy.  I don't much care for what's hot and what's trendy.. I never have.  So why am I bitching?    Probably because "it doesn't matter, because I'm old.. " I'm not THAT old.. am I?  urlLink

      Through the mercy of lots of people, someone's working for me tonight.  I still have to go back to work on Friday to a class, but at least I'll get some sleep before then. I'll NEVER do this again, I can guarantee you that.  Our new manager started today.  After I come back from my days off, I'm going to set up a meeting to sit and talk to her about the state of the union as it were.  We need to discuss some pretty heavy stuff.  The people across the street have the money for the house.  Next week they want to walk through and then, if all goes well, in four to six weeks we'll be closed.  Then we can get onto the stressful-yet-enjoyable business of choosing a new home.  The quicker this all goes, the happier I'll be.  I can't wait to get out of Wilmington and out to the country.  If Krishna allows it, we'll be having the holidays in our NEW house this year.   urlLink

      Due to some scheduling problems at work.. we have someone out on FMLA.. I am now working Thurs/Fri/Sat off Sun work Mon/Tue/Wed off Thurs class on Friday.    Yeah, I DO get screwed.  That's 72 hours scheduled in 7 days.  In reality, given my actual work hours, that's like 84 hours actually worked.  THIS is why I don't come in and work extra when they call me.. because I grind myself half to death on the days I DO work, and I become so exhausted I have to have those five days off or I can't do it again.  Once again last night, they gave us a float nurse and half way through the shift ended up taking her away from us.  Why do I continue to do this?  I guess because I have to, for now.

      Scott just got his hours cut at work from 40 to 25 a week.  He's pretty upset about it, which of course, I don't blame him.  But on the good side, this development isn't putting our house in any imminent danger, and in reality, there's nothing to worry about.  I know, I know.  It's still upsetting.  But he can go on unemployment if he wants, or pick up another part time job, or whatever.  It'll be okay.  We're on our way out of here, one way or another, even if the people across the street bail on the house, and it will all be okay in the end.  These are all just tests of faith.  I haven't felt very well for the past couple of days.  Back in 98, I had some surgery done.  One of the things they did was a procedure called a 'presacral neurectomy'.  What this is, is basically a pain management technique they use for endometriosis.  The procedure is that they isolate the spinal nerve that goes to the uterus, and then cut it, so that you (in theory at least) have no sensation and thus no pain.  I'd have to say overall that the procedure was successful, but the human body is a great thing, and I have developed quite a lot of what's called 'collateral' sensation, where other nerve fibres pick up the impulses.  So even despite all this very invasive, very radical pain management, I've still been taking 1200mg of Aleve every four hours for the past two days.  On the good side, though, if I hadn't had that surgery, I'd probably be needing Dilaudid.  So if you're ever considering this procedure, I'd say go for it.  I've been uncomfortable, but I haven't been incapacitated, so it's all a matter of degree.  My bread is still collapsing in the breadmaker.  Despite using various recipes, I still can't figure out exactly what I'm doing wrong.  It tastes fine.. it just looks like someone punched it on the top.  Doesn't anyone know how to fix this??  I'm going into another one of my 6/8 stretches.. three on, two off, three on.  Then I have like five or six days off again.  I sort of like this schedule.  It's like having a mini-vacation every two weeks and I get to go away all the time.  I am not sure how long it's going to last, though, because the new manager's coming in.  She's already in orientation, but I don't know how long it will be before she hits the floor.  I'm hoping for big changes, but hopefully not too much on my schedule.  I'd like to work eights, but gosh it's nice to be away from there for five or six days at a time.  And it's so nice to be able to go to the temple and not feel pressured to come home right away.  With the tent and all my camping gear (I just got a self-inflating mat to go under the sleeping bag.. luxury!) I can do it practically for free, too, although I just found out I have a free night at the Microtel for whenever I'd like it. I might take that one around Janmastami.  We'll see.  In the meantime, please send happy thoughts my husband's way, and chant Hare Krishna.  urlLink

      TRANSLATION For one who explains this supreme secret to the devotees, pure devotional service is guaranteed, and at the end he will come back to Me. PURPORT Generally it is advised that Bhagavad- urlLink gītā  be discussed amongst the devotees only, for those who are not devotees will understand neither  urlLink Kṛṣṇa  nor Bhagavad- urlLink gītā . Those who do not accept  urlLink Kṛṣṇa  as He is and Bhagavad- urlLink gītā  as it is should not try to explain Bhagavad- urlLink gītā  whimsically and become offenders. Bhagavad- urlLink gītā  should be explained to persons who are ready to accept  urlLink Kṛṣṇa  as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. It is a subject matter for the devotees only and not for philosophical speculators. Anyone, however, who tries sincerely to present Bhagavad- urlLink gītā  as it is will advance in devotional activities and reach the pure devotional state of life. As a result of such pure devotion, he is sure to go back home, back to Godhead. urlLink

      Tonight I decided I would cook for everyone at work.  I didn't get everything on the menu done, but here's what I made: Chole (curried chickpeas) Rajma (sort of a Punjabi chili, but without the traditional cheese) Fried Seasoned Okra with Coconut Gauranga Potatoes (cooked in sour cream) Moong Dal (soup of mung beans, tomatoes, and spices) Rice with peas Here's what I didn't get made: Bhandghobi alu subji-fried cabbage and potaoes with tomatoes and spices Tapioca Lemonade Pineapple Chutney  I love to cook.  I wish I had more time, but this afternoon I didn't get up until 3 (instead of 2) and so I just couldn't get it all put together in time.  However, to my credit, I made all those dishes in just over an hour and a half, and I'll be feeding probably eight people with it, I guess. Krishna's prasadam ki jai! urlLink

      Despite the fact that we think we personally aren't responsible for the diminishing of the earth's resources, we are.  So in the spirit of putting an end to the madness, here is something you can try.  A solar oven is cheap and easily made out of things you probably already have in your own home.  You can get extremely high tech (village-size baking ovens with parabolic reflectors that track) or extremely low-tech (a car windshield reflector, a plastic bag, and a black pot).  The point is, they (both of them, equally well) will work.  And every time one is used, it's that much more wood, gas, oil, coal, or other fuel that isn't being used, isn't being paid for, and isn't polluting the environment.  I was interested to find out that solar cookers can be used on overcast days and virtually throughout the year, as well.   This also makes a super science project for kids as it's cheap and easy to do, and really, it would make an interesting project for kids to do anyway, because when they're done, they can make brownies in it.  And let me say in today's litiginous society:  kids, get your parents to help.  There.  Anyway, if you're at all environmentally conscious, it's worth a look.  Seriously.  Think about it.  I'm going to make one next week, and I'll document the whole thing, and let you know how it turns out.  The link is  urlLink here.  Let me know what you think.

      I was wrong about my schedule.  I'm working Friday/Saturday/Sunday.  So that means I definitely have to call the doctor's today.  I was really sick last night.  The medications they gave me aren't doing a thing.  Meanwhile, today, we have to go to the lawyer's office and sign some papers.  This means we don't actually have to be present at the closing.  I'm kinda glad about that.  This whole process just has me in a complete knot.  I'll be glad when we can move on to the second half and start in with the begging for money/choosing the property/arguing with the builders part.  Whatever they call me in for this headache, I hope it has refills.  Seriously we are both looking forward to getting the house built and getting out of here.  I think it's going to be a lot better than when we moved in here.  He knows so much more than what he used to know in terms of building and fixing and so on, and he's really psyched for all these things he wants to do-coffered ceilings and wainscotings and nine inch baseboards and so on.  Me, I'm thinking more about what colour should we paint things and is five acres really enough.  We'll see when we go look at the property.  Hurricane Alex is now the strongest hurricane ever recorded north of 38 degrees, sustained at 120 mph.  TD 2 has dissipated, so right now there's nothing of note to be concerned for in the tropics.  I wanted to go to the beach today, but the heat index is going to be over 110, and I'm just not up for that.  Instead I think we are going to go to Wilmington Architechtural Salvage and see if there's anything good to be had there.  In particular I am looking for a kitchen sink with legs.  If I have to get a brand new one it's going to cost a fortune.  I'd rather have an old one anyway.  I saw part of Hellboy last night.  It looked kinda goofy.  I wasn't really feeling well enough to sit through it, though.. it was one of those nights where I really had to just get up and wander from place to place aimlessly.  It was pretty awful.  In other news there isn't really much other news.  I keep thinking I had something I wanted to write about, but then I can't remember what it was.   urlLink

      I got a lot done today.  I got four big chunky tires (moved up from 215 to 235 at the tire guy's insistence:  "It'll look SO MUCH better..") on my Jeep.  Scott called me a redneck for having the white letters on the outside.  Should I have had them on the inside?  Am I really a redneck because of it?  Doubts persist.  Then we went to the bank and got him put on the checking account after a very long time with it just being me.  Long story not worth repeating.  It's fixed, anyway.  Then I called the termite people and they're sending us a copy of the warranty on the house.  Yes, you need a termite warranty.  I guess maybe you don't have to have it, but if you don't, how can you be sure you have no termites?  Even if we have termites, we're insured, now.  So that's okay.  And Sears is coming on Monday to look at the heat pump, just for a check up.  It's pretty geriatric, but it's working just fine, so I don't anticipate them having to do anything to it.   My head is killing me.  They prescribed Skelaxin (a muscle relaxer) and Midrin (for migraines).  It isn't working.  I feel like a wuss but I am going to call again in the morning and tell them that.  What can I say.. I can't help it.... it makes me very ill-tempered to have a headache like this at work.  And I have to work the whole weekend.  Wait.  No I don't.. I have to work Thursday and Friday.  I told you I never know what day it is. urlLink

      One of the hardest things about working nights is knowing what day it is.  Before you put this off as me just being a fruitcake, think about this: I go to work on one day and come home on another.   That being said, today's Wednesday.  The general plan of the day for today is for me to get some tires put on my car.  After that, we're going to the bank and FINALLY (after about six years of procrastination) getting Scott's name put on the checking account.  Don't ask.  It's a long story.  I also have to make a few phone calls for house stuff.  Tomorrow we have to go to the lawyer's and sign off the paperwork.  The buyers were around last night and everything is still looking like it's a go.  I just want it all to be done, already.  I'm really looking forward to the whole house-building process.  It's so much fun, and this time it will be even better than the first time we did it.  Scott's excited too, and he's already planning furniture and stuff he wants to build.  We are both really psyched to get out of Wilmington.  Choosing a property of the several we have on our list will probably be the most difficult decision we have left.  Between the two of us, we have the whole house basically planned out.  I've always had a huge problem with nursing uniforms.  They aren't made to fit me and the fabrics are too thin.  Additionally, I don't like straight skirts, and the skirts themselves are never the right length.  For about the last year or so I've been trying to find someone to make me some dresses.  I even bought some patterns, but I haven't gotten around to actually making anything (not to mention my sewing skills are a shade over mediocre at best.. I can make a nice apron, but a dress won't be nearly as good).  Anyway, I finally found a very nice lady who is going to make me some uniform dresses.  I have to buy them one at a time because I'm budgeting myself rather strictly these days, but I am looking forward to getting a few.  I so prefer to wear dresses anyway, and patients/families really do respond better to a nurse who looks more traditional.  If you'd like to see her website, it's  urlLink here .  Yes.  Remember I said I couldn't be stereotyped?  The humidity's dropped by about 35% in the last 36 hours.  Yesterday we had typical 'day after a hurricane' weather, with a huge drop in the humidity, blue skies, and a beautiful breeze.  The Atlantic is heating up, though, so it isn't nearly over yet.  I have a feeling we may see more than just a nudge from a storm this year.   urlLink

      We're supposed to be closing on the house two weeks from today.  We still haven't heard a word since the inspection.  Today, I called State Farm and got the scoop on what happens with our homeowners' insurance, and got that all ready to go once everything (if everything) becomes official.  Yes, I'm nervous.  Scott is cooler now than at any time previous to this.  But I'm all psyched to get out of here now, and I don't want to wait what could be a whole nother year to do it.  I guess we'll see what happens. urlLink

      The storm is strengthening a lot sitting out there over the Gulf stream.  Winds are up to 60 and they are saying it may reach hurricane strength before long.  However, the good news is that it looks like it's going to sit off the coast and not come ashore.  I've been through enough of THOSE scenarios to not believe it til I see it, but it's still some good news.   Everyone in Wilmington is an amateur meterologist.  We have to be.  When you live in an area like this one where hurricanes are like relatives you hate but have to have over once or twice a year, it does you well to know a bit about them.  So you could be sitting in the grocery store and hear people discussing subtropical lows, wind speeds, and the relationship of the jet stream to the forecast track.  It's almost kind of eerie.  Plus, Jim Cantore (from the Weather Channel) is in town.  They  (the Weather Channel) own a condo here somewhere, I heard.  It wouldn't surprise me any.  Here's a basic tip: TWC does not show up in your neighbourhood unless they think you're where the action's gonna be.  Especially if it's Jim Cantore.  Isn't he cute?  But he must be bored to death, because right now it's sunny and breezy.  There's clouds up there, but nothing major.  I'm sorry if you're bored with all this weather talk.  I'll post some pictures from Fran so you understand my intense interest in this kind of thing. urlLink

      We're in our first tropical storm warning of the 2004 Atlantic season.  TD One is just offshore and will land within the next 36 hours with winds up to and possibly over 40mph, depending on whether any additional strengthening occurs over the warm Gulf water.  Also, with fifteen days to go til closing, we haven't heard a thing from our buyers since the inspection.  I have a very bad feeling about all this, but it could just be paranoia on my part. urlLink
