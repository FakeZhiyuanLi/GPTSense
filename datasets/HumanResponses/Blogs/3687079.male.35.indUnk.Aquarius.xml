      The UK/USA hands soveriegnty back to Iraq then, after so long.  Lucky they intervened then or there could have been a whole lot of killing over there. Well done guys and it's great that you handed the reigns back after everything was hunky dory again. A good job well done.  Who's next? Watch out Fidel.......

      And so England are knocked out of a major tournament on penalties again. If you don't like football/soccer then turn off now, becuase that is what this entry is all about.  We didn't play well, but we surely did not deserve the fate which was dealt us. It seems that some unseen hand is behind all things in the football world and moves against both the English and Newcastle teams almost in unison. Watching my national team is so much a parallel of watching my home town team ,that it does become scary on occasion.  Suffice to say a dodgy refereeing decision cost us our place in the tournament and this was followed by a dramatic penalty shoot out where our talismanic captain, David Beckham brought his current slump in form (probably because of his personal problems) onto the pitch.  I really feel for Becks. So many English fans berate him and I have no idea why. Jealousy perhaps? I don't know, but they do expect too much of him - he is only a man and very young man at that. He stood up and was brave enough to take a penalty and he missed. It will haunt him forever and that is not a ridiculous exaggeration.  **********************************  Glastonbury weekend this weekend, but the line up is shite - Paul fucking McCartney??? is that a pisstake?? surely it must be, but Oasis too - jesus H christ!!?! totally awful and I hope it rains all over those people with such pathetic taste. Next year I may attend a festival with my wife, but we'll have to work it all out way in advance.  ***********************************  The Libertines new album, imaginatively titled 'The Libertines' will be seen as one of the most important albums of all time when it sees release in a few weeks. This band will be legends and they are surely the real deal.   Teetering on the brink of disaster and genius brought about by writer, Peter Doherty's incredible talent, they deserve to be taken more seriously than any guitar band in the last 25 years.  Doherty has tried so much rehab to kick his crack habit, but he hasn't managed it so far and he is the genuine tortured genius. He was jailed a while back for stealing another band member's guitar and selling it to fund his habit. It's tragic to watch such an aware and able young man struggle to free his life from the hell of drug use and abuse.  Ironic then that he and his band claim the title of 'libertines' - free men and proud men. The freedom they talk about though is a freedom of the spirit and the mind and if he ever achieves a free body as well, then it will be a glorious day. My thoughts are with him as he battles with his addiction.  Forget the drug addled nonsense of previous rock icons, Doherty outdoes them all with his sheer artistry, unquenchable thirst for debauchery and the devil's own ear for a tune. His words touch me and his tunes make me move my feet. Long may he reign.  He posts bizarre messages on his www.babyshambles.com website and surfs the internet a lot. A fascinating man he is.

      Our Prime Minister, Tony Blair, is under fire. Why? I hear you cry.... after all isn't unemployment really low now? isn't inflation under control? aren't we all a lot better then we were? yes, but.......  This is Great Britain, so I am told. This is the land where 75% of the population still genuinely believe that we are a global superpower, ruling the waves, being at the centre of everything and quite simply, we are better than everyone else.  Better than the uncultured, simple Americans, better than the downright neanderthal Australins, better than the arrogant French, annoying Germans and slovenly Italins. This is Great Britain - the jewel of the civilised world - right? wrong!  All the arguments in our country are currently centred around whether or not we should integrate more closely with Europe or not. I can't see why anyone thinks we should not integrate fully - free trade with the rest of Europe, a common currency, freedom to live and work anywhere withing Europe is a fantastic symbol of freedom which has arisen from the ashes of a divided continent which was only recently carved up in two World Wars and a Cold War. This is an amazing achievement, yet so many oppose it in this country.  They oppose it because they are small-minded xenophobes and they are inherently racist. They distrust the smelly Euro-people and fear that our country will lose its identity and be swallowed up inside a huge Republic of Europe. Nonsense.  If we leave Europe then who do we trade with? America and Japan? oh yeah sure, we'll just ship it over and it'll be with you in like two months sir. If we leave the EU then the rest of Europe will not take it well, they will impose tariffs upon our goods and force us out completely and who could blame them? After all it is what so many Brits crave.  All of those who currently live and work in Europe without the need for visas or governmental permission would be forced to get a visa or return home and do you really think the French, Spanish or Germans would look favourably upon us if we walk out on them? No chance, my Europhobic friends.  At the top of this pile of backward-looking xenophobes, we have the UKIP and more worryingly the BNP , who prey upon the fears stirred up by nonsensical media stories and half-truths which circulate in the form of rumours. Our press is obsessed with tales of immigrants swamping the country and asylum seekers looking to take over.  The fact is, more people wish to leave this country than enter it. Just ask 10 people at random what they would do if they won the lottery tomorrow and most will tell you that they would immediately move to warmer climes and to a place which has a better standard of living.  My message is a simple one. Ditch the xenophobia, you stupid bastards and look forwards. Britain is no longer 'Great' and never shall be again.

      One of the first things I did when I posted my first ever blog a good few years ago now, was to give a rundown on who I was and what I was and unveil all kinds of unnecessary information about myself and those I cared about. This blog will not contain any personal information like that after this post.  I am 35 years old and a man who is engaged to be married in October to my beautiful and wonderful finacee, Kelly. She lives in Las Vegas for another couple of weeks, after which we shall be together  permanently  - and I mean permanently. We will never part.  I work and I have my own business and I don't consider either of these things to be worthy of inclusion to an outside reader.  What I will talk about in this blog is life in the outside world, books, music, sport, politics and things which I need to get off my chest. A blog, for me at least, is a cathartic outlet for the thoughts which overload my mind on most days. If I drain them out and pour them onto these pages then everything will be rosy.  And without further ado..............on with the show.
