      This is really going to blow up in Jim Duquette's face.   I'm not sure how much Mets fans have thought about this, but we've seen players like Kris Benson before.  There are reasons he wants to play in New York, and they certainly aren't the right ones.  His wife is openly a sex fiend porn star in training who parades their sex life more freely than copies of The Village Voice.  You don't think the New York media is going to have a field day with the adventures Kris and Anna Benson have?  Oh, the PR nightmares in the wings!        Now, I'm not one to care much about what players do off the field as opposed to on, but we've seen this happen too many times before to turn a blind eye.  Kris and Anna Benson are not only going to get caught up in the NYC night life, I'm sure they'll make headlines when they're discovered in some of the seedier and more unsavory venues in our fair metropolis.  Think this won't affect not only his pitching but his status with the club?      Further, we know Benson's character is questionable.  He didn't start throwing like a stud until his name popped up in trade talks.  This is not another type of player the Mets have.  We're trying to get away from the country club prima-donna atmosphere that led to our current decline, not enhance it.      The attitude we need more of is in the kid we sent packing.  Ty Wigginton, while not a superstar in his numbers, is someone who would do anything the team asked him to do gladly.  If Art Howe asked him to sell hot dogs between innings, he'd have flung off his cap and dashed out into the stands slinging overpriced weiners.  He was just starting to come into his own as a hitter also.  A real pro's pro who a team with upcoming hitters like Reyes and Wright can build around.  People say his pace to go for about .275 with 20 homers isn't great for a first baseman or third baseman, but let's be realistic here.  That's about middle of the pack when you take into account the entire league and not just the Thomes, Pujols, and Bagwells.  Throw in his hustle, spirit, and leadership and you have a great supporting member for any playoff contending cast.  Well, had.      Scott Kazmir I was never wholly opposed to trading.  There were questions of his health and work ethic along with whether or not he had the frame to be a starter.  Thing is, he was a lefty with bounds of potential.  What I was wholly opposed to was using Kazmir in the wrong trade.  You can't refuse to include him in Carlos Beltran and Alfonso Soriano, then turn around and swap him for Victor Zambrano.  I don't care what "Pitching Guru" Rick Peterson says.  "Pitching Guru" Rick Peterson isn't going to be here forever.  I don't know of many pitching coaches not named Leo Mazzone or Mel Stottlemyer who spend that long with any one team.  Further, you think he's going to stick around when Art Howe is run out of Queens?      You know it's a bad deal when even a teams own sportscasters are hard pressed to talk up a trade.  Save for the Bill Daughtys and Matt Loughlins of the world, the New York media isn't doing a good job of making Duke look like a winner here.  Well, he clearly isn't.  Are Benson and Zambrano good pitchers who vault this rotation to one of the best in the league?  Yes.  Are they worth Scott Kazmir, Matt Peterson, Ty Wigginton, Justin Huber, and Joselo Diaz?  Absolutely not.      Look at what has made the Braves and the Yankees so good for so long.  They started with a firm and large base of home-grown talent BEFORE using farm chips to cash in on big trades and only made those trades when they had real shots at winning.  The Mets are too erratic in who they want to emulate.  One minute they want to be the 1999 Yankees, the next they want to be the 2003 Marlins, and so on and so forth.        So, what now?      Last night's loss really hurt.  Seven games back, on a night when Trachsel really wasn't pitching that badly.  Kind of reminds you how important Ty Wigginton's bat really was, especially on a team where Jose Reyes hasn't yet proven he can stay healthy and David Wright hasn't yet proven he's a middle of the order hitter.  You aren't going to win with Jason Phillips and Joe McEwing starting games.  Gerald Williams replacing Wiggy's spot on the roster?  Yikes.      The trade deadline is not yet here, so Duke may have something up his sleeve.  He may still prove he is the maverick who stole away into the night with Richard Hidalgo for David Weathers and Jeremy Griffiths as opposed to the niave sleepwalker who sold the farm for magic beans.

        Kris Benson, Victor Zambrano to the Mets       So, a team six games back and in fourth place in the National League East looking forward into a three game series with the first place (15 wins in last 20 games) Atlanta Braves decides they are going to sell the farm in hopes of a pennant.       The Casualties    Ty Wigginton, Matt Peterson, Justin Huber, Scott Kazmir, and Jose Diaz      Okay. We've given up two of the top pitching prospects in Major League Baseball and a productive proven major leaguer who can play just about any position on the field for two somewhat proven hair-under-30 pitchers who suddenly turn our rotation from good to one of the best.      One thing many commentators over this trade are forgetting, one of the many things, is how badly Art Howe manages his pitching staff. Having a staff as strong as the Mets do now is certainly a boon in a tight race, but a manager who pulls his starters after 100 pitches in favor of a questionable at best bullpen kind of blurs the lines here. Another valid point here is that Wigginton was a formidable six-hole hitter that could not only leave Wright comfortable in a seven hole, but also keep Cameron down in the order where he has been producing markedly better.      Victor Zambrano, although a pitcher with great stuff that managed to win on a bad Devil Rays team, gives up far too many walks. Place those walks on the worst defense in the NL. That makes for a dangerous combination. The last thing this Mets team needs is more baserunners. "Pitching Guru" Rick Peterson believes he can turn Zambrano into an ace, and he has worked wonders in the past, but this is quite a roll of the dice to take at the cost of number one pitching prospect Scott Kazmir.      Kris Benson has been called the Jeff Weaver of the NL (well, as of last season). His excellent string of starts after his name came up in trade talks only does more to make me question his fortitude and heart. While I think he could be a good pitcher and his deal, over Zambrano's, makes me cringe less if they can sign him to the long term, I still think it's foolish to rush and get Benson now as opposed to waiting until the offseason to sign him. Listen. Benson's agent knows the bind the Mets are in right now, as far as the Mets HAVING to sign him long term. He can use this leverage to makes the Mets overpay for him, giving Wilpon even more of an excuse to tighten his pursestrings when the winter meetings roll around. Benson, in the offseason, is NOT going to have huge bidding wars for his services--not in a free agent class alongside of Pedro Martinez et al.       What of the future now? What of  The Plan ? Sure, we have a young and unproven David Wright, whom I like, and an injury prone Jose Reyes... but how can you so quickly mortgage the future  AGAIN  for a postseason run that most fans accept as a lost cause? Was this a ploy to sell more tickets?      Ty Wigginton, while overrated by Met fans, has the potential to be a very solid player. A very necessary player on a team like these Mets. He could've been an every day player, playing first and the outfield and filling in for Reyes every time he gets hurt all while hitting in the .265-.285 range and swatting a respectable 25ish homers a season. Will he turn into another Jeff Kent? It's possible, but I'm not so sure. His production is something to certainly not overlook this season though. David Wright, in the midst of a pennant race, cannot realistically be expected to step up and replace Wigginton's numbers. That's both unrealistic and unfair. He was a tough one to lose, but for a frontline pitcher in an aging staff, I can accept his loss.      Matt Peterson and Scott Kazmir are hard pills to swallow being lost simultaneously. Two top prospects, both very young and both pitching well in the minors, are chips you want in your pocket. If not to hold for your own use being brought up, to use in marquee player trades. Let's be honest here, Zambrano and Benson are good players, but neither inspire the fear in opponents like Randy Johnson, Carlos Beltran, or Barry Zito. Jim Duquette just showed how he is certainly not ready to take the reigns as GM of a large market team. He got the taste of a potential post season drive and took one of the worst plays out of the Steve Phillips playbook.      Let's be honest with ourselves here, this Mets team cannot take the NL East. Especially not right now with a hot Braves team that hasn't seen a finish below first place since 1990. Further, you are making these trades six games back with a three game series against the Braves staring you in the face.       Analyze the market. Sellers are making out like bandits. Hell, the D-Rays and the Bucs just vandalized the Mets. If management had thought with a level, sober head and, at the risk of disenchanting unrealistic fans, traded a Glavine to Boston for prospects, we'd have even more chips to cash in this winter to really make a charge in 2005.       Now, all this talk aside, we have to look around and see who is in the clubhouse now. We do have one of the strongest pitching staffs in baseball and we have two relatively young arms who could, Lord willing, lead this Mets team a long way for a long time. We've still got a young duo of Jose Reyes and David Wright with high ceilings and a good young bat in Kaz Matsui. These trades are indeed ugly, I'm not going to deny that, but it may not be the end of the world.      Regardless, I am quite tired of the mistakes of management with this team. They make promises, then make the same mistakes that they've been making again and again. If they're looking for a model to win by, look across town. Don't look at their recent moves, look at the moves that got them to where they are today:   Derek Jeter, Bernie Williams, Jorge Posada, Andy Pettite, Mariano Rivera, and so on... all started in the Bronx. All were given a chance, a long chance, to make a difference.  THEN  you move on and acquire the veterans. Do you think our neighbors would allow veteran players to dictate who to and not to sign and/or trade for? Come on. The Mets need to decide whether to, pardon my French, shit or get off the pot. Don't mortgage your future for mid-range players, don't hunt in the bargain bin when the A-Rods and the Vlads are on the table for the taking, and certainly don't tell the fans one thing and do the opposite.      So, Fred Wilpon, what of " The Plan " now?
