      While sitting in the Gallery (a.ka. "The Freak Show") today for lunch, I re-visited an idea that I've often pondered... my need for a license to kill.   First off, before we get ahead of ourselves, there are some practical matters to consider:    A) Where do I apply for this license?  Can city hall help me or do I need to appeal to a higher authority like the lame duck U.N. or Roy's Bait, Tackle & Arms shop?    B) As various countries have differing opinions of what is a humane way to die, what method will I be forced to employ?  Perhaps it's my American upbringing and those darn Hollywood types who infused me with a love for Chow Yun-Fat movies, but I do so love the idea of dual wielding 10.mil silver handguns while diving off a 3 story building only to land on the back of a truck speeding down a small street, shooting at my attackers (never pausing to reload because as we all know, real guns never run out of bullets!) while some sexy female stereotype makes not-so-vague sexual innuendos in my direction... I'm getting ahead of myself.  The point is, what type of holy vengeance do I deliver upon the wicked?  C) Do I supply warnings, or is a simple "tap tap" to the back of the head sufficient?  I'm not in this to cause pain, in fact it's the alleviating of pain, specifically pain to myself and everyone else who must endure the condemned's very existence, that I'm trying to rid the world of.  I can accept the sanction of a warning system, but I don't want it to be like every other system that has so many chances for redemption that the fear of the original system is null and void. (Read here as "Lawyers will have no say in this process".)  Now, on to the fun part.  The real meat and potatoes of this subject, just who would be selected for early retirement.  1) The guy/girl who insists on listening to his "walkman" (I use that term loosely, because as I see it if you're head phones are larger than the speakers in my living room, I have a hard time accepting it as a personal listening device.) who walks around public places, blaring his/her music at such a high level that glassware vibrates off shelves, cats/dogs run for the hills, sidewalk cracks begin to separate in to canyons due to the driving bass that has the power to move earth and stone... but I do thank you for the latest rendition of DMX's sure to be a hit "Hey Yo F$@#, I Be All S&$@ F%#@ on Your Biz Nitch".  Really, does this person have a mother or anyone who is going to miss their presence?  2) Morbidly obese people.  I don't want this to turn into a beautiful people only culture, because God knows I wouldn't last two seconds.  But those people who consume daily the entire weeks food rations for a village in the Sudan need to be put down.  I don't think many will argue with this one, after all I'm trying to save a village here!  Oh, and if they even attempt to get onto a plane without purchasing at least two tickets, they have to ride in the cargo hold.  Seriously, have you ever tried to fly anywhere with Sloth-zilla's fat rolling onto your seat, while it secretes some mucous that slowly and surely eats away at the cloth, your skin, the arm rest in-between you two... it's not a pretty sight.  LEARN WHEN TO PUT THE EXTRA LARGE VALUE MEAL DOWN PEOPLE!!! Oh sure, you ordered a diet coke with that triple bacon cheese burger and large fry... but you didn't mean it.  3) The d-bag (if you don't know what this means, that's okay, it's a colloquial saying amongst my clan.) who insists on making jokes throughout lectures, business meetings, public executions, etc.  You know the type I'm talking about.  So starved for attention they insist on annoying the living hell out of those forced by circumstance to listen to their idiotic outbursts.  I heard once that Cambodia was actually experimenting with this as a form of torture, so thank you Cambodia for furthering my argument.  This is the guy you just want to bash over the head with the nearest blunt object, as if his very voice pierces your brain like a knife... Oh how you all want him dead... Don't deny it!!!  4) Those who can not think for themselves.  This is an obvious one for anyone used to reading  tFST  and to those who know me personally.  But for those drones walking around through life like human cholesterol, simply clogging up the arteries of commerce, school and government, please do us all a favor and form a lemming cult and find a cliff.  That's all for now folks... Don't worry, I'm sure there are more but those types were the most readily apparent at lunch today.  Just imagine what I could come up with over a whole week! lol    A Public Service Announcement:  We've had some fun here today making light of death and the bringer of death, namely me if I had a license to kill.  I hope all those reading know this was a joke and I would never actually act out these scenarios because A) of all that Catholic guilt and B) despite my lobbying they just won't issue the damn license!  ;-)  Peace Always My Friends... (And I do mean it... Peace  Always  My Friends...)

      Okay, so for those I may have scared with my "plot of Apocalypse Now in your future" comment of what my ethos is, I figure I should start to explain a few things.  Instead of defining it outright like some Power Point lecture, I'm going to discuss some areas of my life and how I live it and from that we'll be able to develop a working understanding of the true nature of my insanity... err enlightenment... right class?  So, to start I'd like to approach one of the core elements to every decision... whether done consciously or subconsciously, each of us demonstrates the idea of  Measured Risk .  What does measured risk mean?  Quite simply it describes  that no action is worth doing if the possible reaction does not outweigh the benefits gained by said mentioned action .  Ergo, will the fun gained by going out tonight instead of studying be of greater benefit to me then possibly failing my test tomorrow?  Every decision made, should use this simple formula.  Now before the masses jump all over me for the obvious flaws present in this theory, there are exceptions, corollaries and addendums to all rules, but over all this is the basis for most decisions of logical, free thinking beings.  Practical example time...  The other day a wet behind the ears streetwalker freshman stumbles into a lecture hall filled with 150 students, intent on mastering entry level physics, 25 minutes late for a 50 minute course.  The non-native English speaking professor is doing an admirable job of keeping the drooling masses engaged with his examples of physics in every day life.  Suddenly the nirvana of velocity, speed, direction and displacement is shattered as Betty Boop in her stiletto shoe's thuds down the stairs to the very front row, crosses in front of the professor, in front of the overhead projector thus showing her colossal shadow on the wall, collapses into a chair that began to scream uncle the second her enormous mass (Another physics area of study: large heavenly bodies and their inability to squeeze into mini-Lazy Boys) settled into the cheap cloth ass receptacle.  Not two seconds later, she's waving her hand back and forth (in front of the overhead mind you!!!) and promptly informs the physics sage that "I need a syllabus!!!!"    Now, here comes the part where Measure Risk comes into play.  Will the joy I get from promptly getting up from my seat, walking down to the Venus de Jell-O in her should-be-a-crime-against-humanity-short-skirt-for-someone-her-size, forget my and all pure gentlemen's rule of never ever raising a hand against a woman no matter how much facial hair and/or size she may have on you, and begin to pummel the hell out of her with any of the sides of beef she seems to have wedged in her back pocket... does that joy outweigh the inevitable pain I will be in when she proceeds to collapse onto me thus crushing the very life out my body, but leaving enough in limbo so my trial in abstentia will find that should I ever revive from the coma I'm so thoroughly enjoying, that I will be sentenced to 3 years for aggravated assault against the protected wildlife species of the Urban Yeti?  See the decisions that are made in just a split second in my mind?  You too can experience these beautiful scenarios a-la-Alli McBeal if you only learn to see everything as a decision of Measured Risk.  (Please note I could not stand that receptacle of poor jokes and shallow drama called Alli McBeal and the mere fact it won awards proves the fact that the devil is alive and well and loose upon our fair world.)  So what was I talking about?  Oh yeah... Measured Risk.  What are some exceptions to this?  One may be helping your fellow man despite the possible setbacks it will cause you.  Another could be the much needed and often ignored  "Oh Screw It" corollary  that states  "Every so often, it is imperative that all caution be thrown to the wind and one must, with reckless abandon, stay up past midnight."   (Note: the "stay up past midnight" part can be exchanged with whatever you so desire, but for me just making it past 11 is in and of itself a big enough deal to fall into this corollary)  Amazing... truly amazing the power of higher reasoning.  Peace Always My Friends... ;-)

      Okay... I need to get this out.  Please listen up folks and really try to grasp what I'm saying.  There is no arrogance in this, it is simply the truth and the world needs to understand it.  I am far from perfect.  As such, I am not THE God, but I am A god.  The mortals of this world have been placed here for my amusement, but more importantly, for me to help.  This world will be a better place when those who can not think for themselves (and there are quite a few of you... raise your hands... DO IT NOW!) buy into my ethos and start living it.  What is my ethos?  Soon my friends... soon you will know. ;-)  Peace Always My Friends...

      What an amazing weekend.  I traveled out to Notre Dame to witness the Irish succumb to the pressures of playing before a packed house.  Lord knows most Irish men have trouble performing under pressure.  Despite the MSU win, the entire experience was enjoyable.  Perhaps most notable was the journey to and from South Bend, IN.  Picture this, two highly energetic (and slightly mental) people driving for 10.5 hours over 640 miles across barren turnpike.  Inevitably, things will happen & conversations will ensue that would not normally be introduced in the confines of our daily lives.  And yet, here we are, cruising somewhere through Western PA when the question is asked, "Define your perfect woman?  Purely physical here, not personality, brains, etc.  Just body."  WARNING WARNING WARNING... DANGER WILL ROBINSON!!!!  Loaded question alert!!!  Answering this question in any shape or form will result in immediate and long lasting scorn by the interviewer.  As I see it, there are three possible courses of action.  One is to give what appears to be the correct response of "Well Hun... it's you."  Easy, right?  HA!  Oh little brain, how little you know.  This answer results in being told you are "just saying that because you have to" or you are not genuine in your response.  I pity the poor sap who actually DOES think his girl friend is the perfect woman physically for him.  Oh wait... that's me.  Damn.  The second response is wrought with even more peril, as you let your "other" brain do the thinking and respond with your mental image of a certain porn star you have thing for and accurately recite her dimensions, assuring your woman that you're okay with the fact she's not her and never will be, so long as she's willing to attempt the things your favorite fan of the not so silver screen attempts.  ... ... Okay, with this response you need to just throw yourself from the vehicle which is now currently traveling 85 down the Ohio State Turnpike and pray the tractor trailer that hits you does the job quickly, because if she gets her hands on you she will ensure you are alive as she slowly tortures you over the next millennium.  Not a pretty picture.  The third, and in my opinion wisest of choices, is to reach some sort of compromise, such as starting off with, "That's a tough one Hun.  You're damn close... damn close!  I guess if I had to, mind you HAD to, I'd say the following..." and then you give a FEW examples that do not stray to far from the form the succubus has chosen that day.  That way you're saved from the flogging of being called a liar (Despite your belief she is the hottest thing ever... hell that's one of the reasons you date her!) and the never ending torture of describing a model so far from your girlfriends form she now feels inadequate.  Ahh... such is the tight rope called a relationship.  Peace Always My Friends... ;-)

      Moving a girlfriend in has to rate up there as the number one cause for breakups in an otherwise healthy and strong relationship.  My girlfriend and I have by all accounts a very healthy and loving relationship, she doesn't tell me how to play video games, I don't offer advice on her choreography.  So why is it that any attempt at helping a person during a move is seen as an attack on their very being?  For instance, I say: "The bed frame is bent, here I'll straighten it out." She hears, "You are a worthless and weak individual.  If if were legal in this state I'd have you euthanized."  Anyone else disturbed by the translation of my offer to help?  I guess one realizes that there comes a point when the situation is so badly muffed up (yes, I said "muffed up"... just can't seem to shake that 80's lingo) that the only course of action is to retreat with all possible haste.  So it was last night, I ran like Custard wished he had, tail between my legs, that beaten dog look on my face.  The kicker was, when I announced my intentions to leave, the incredulous look on her face and the words "Why are you leaving?" almost made me cry in frustration.    Why am I leaving?  Hmm... I'm just spit balling here, no real conclusions mind you... but could it be the fact I've watched your vampiric fangs grow 2 inches in the last 30 minutes?  Or the fact you were reaching for that lead pipe while I was bent over fixing the draws in your dresser?  Or perhaps it could just be the sight of dogs, cats, mice and other vermin avoiding your house like the plague... animals sense evil!!!  Yeah... take your pick hun.  ... Ahh... but I still love her... after all, who else can come to the brink of bludgeoning me with a blunt object and pull back?  Must be love... ;-)  ... Peace Always My Friends...

      Ugghh... hangovers really bite.  No new news there.  So here I am, creating my first "blog" on what is my 23rd birthday, recovering from a wicked hangover, wishing I was still at home in bed (preferably next to a firery red head...)  Why start a blog now?  Beats the hell outta me, I tried Alka-Seltzer Morning Relief but that didn't work... maybe writing will.  I'm sorry, this is really lame, I'm a tad off my game today, but I promise to get better at this and actually put some mindless dribble up here that will eventually ensure you get no work down at the corporate office.  Have a great day and Peace Always My Friends!

      You know... I'm really beginning to dislike people.  Not some people mind you, but all of them.  Well I guess that's too broad of a statement, how about we say I dislike all people but those I like?  Does that make more sense?    Walking through the Gallery today (I know, I know, why do I even bother going there?  It's only going to upset me!) and it occurs to me we need some sort of Carney Rule.  For instance,  "Those possessing highly unusual traits such as severe obesity, larger than the Divine Proportion (Phi) limbs and/or appendages (this can include but is not limited to lips, eye brows, bad hair cuts, tumors, etc.), ridiculously poor taste in fashion or any other characteristic that will invoke stares of curiosity and bewilderment, are not allowed into public areas during high traffic times.   That was just a rough draft, mind you my final law will most likely include far more degenerates in it's scope, the spirit of the new code is found within said mentioned draft.  The  ridiculously poor taste in fashion  statement would probably kill off at least half the population of the Gallery at any given time.  Seriously, at what point does that orange Huston Astro's jersey circa 1973 appear to be a good look?  Or the 6 inch HIGHLY painted nails with your torn white t-shirt, freakishly tight jeans and stilettos trying to contain the rough mass of an African elephant... What zoo keeper let you out in the wild that morning?  Does anyone else see these things and wonder if there is a God?  I mean, I know He's there, but sometimes I think His attention is turned elsewhere, like his new project world, of which I was clearly supposed to be on.  An obvious second addendum to this wonderful new legislation would deal specifically with those emitting noxious fumes in the guise of... well frankly in no real guise just the fact they're dirty, vile wastes of otherwise perfectly good human flesh.  Nothing makes me want to gag and subsequently pummel the ever-loving funk outta someone then when I enter an elevator only to be assaulted by the waif of burnt hair.  I'm so sorry you have a quaff of unmanageable hair, but if you can not operate that straightening iron without some measure of restraint, we're just going to have to take it from you.  And regarding those who when they walk by decide to leave you with a lingering attack of their last meal... beware, your days are numbered!  I am calling you out and the next time I can smell the baked ham from last night on you, I will deem it my civic duty to publicly mock you all the way to the shower!  Now I didn't mean to go off on a rant there, but this new law would raise the quality of life for those striving for perfection, like myself, and help segregate the Morlocks to the under-dark where they belong.    Whew... glad I got that off my chest.  Guess it's time to go volunteer at a soup kitchen or something to help neutralize the bad karma I just levied on myself.  Peace Always My Friends...

      Been a while, but fear not little brains, I have returned... and with a vengeance.  I have been quietly observing society and have added some new people to my list of those who can not think for themselves and therefore are eligible for forced natural selection.  1.  Those who use the term metrosexual.  This is a new term that has sprung up in the past few months that is... well I'll  urlLink The Word Spy  handle explaining it:  "(MET.roh.sek.shoo.ul) n. A dandyish narcissist in love with not only himself, but also his urban lifestyle; a straight man who is in touch with his feminine side. - metrosexuality n."       What completely retarded and scorned by women asshole came up with this one?  Does this not reek of some poor schmuck, a la the TV show Average Joe, who was oft times confused for someone of a homosexual nature by women he was in fact actually attracted to?  (This is actually beginning to sound like someone I know... hmm... damn!)  WHO THE HELL USES  dandyish  IN A SENTENCE?      One can find this word infiltrating daily conversations, such as "Oh look at that guy over there!  Is he gay?  Nah, probably just METROSEXUAL."  What... the... hell?  Do we not have enough terms to describe sexuality as it is?  Let's see... heterosexual, homosexual, bi-sexual, transsexual, try-sexual (Yeah, can anyone explain that one to me?  Either you do... or you don't... get it?) goat-sexual, Jackson-5-sexual, etc.  As you can see, metrosexual is only going to confuse the youngins' of today's world by offering them yet another avenue of possible molestation by a former pop star.  2.  Anyone from Jersey.  Now this may seem overly harsh and all I can say is... good!  I mean it to be so, as we don't like your kind or your stink.  If I find out any of you are breeding wit' our womens over here, I'm gonna organize a rally or something.  Seriously, what have Jersey-ites ever brought to the table for those not from the "Garden State" (Garden my ass... have you ever smelled Newark?) besides loud mouths, over opinionated mental midgets, obnoxious women (come on guys, what's worse than seeing an absolute biscuit, then only to have her open her mouth and ruin the fantasy with a Jersey accent?), bus accidents on the AC expressway, hypodermic needles on the shore (It's a flipping  beach  you fargin ice-holes!)... and lest I forget perhaps the most egregious offense... Chicky.  Hang your head in shame Jersey, for you unleashed upon the world the most scary of all horrors, like a Pandora's Box of modern era, the otherwise peaceful states of this great union are now susceptible to the horrors mentioned above.  May God have mercy on your souls...  3.  Mouth Breathers.  For those who have yet to achieve that elusive evolutionary step of breathing through your nose, beware!  The constant  schuch... schuch... schuch...  of you breathing is backing me into a corner and soon I will have to lash out as any animal would.  As evident by your lack of mastery in the oxygen imbibing arts, I am led to question your ability to master other seemingly mundane actions.  Are you able to chew food with your mouth closed?  Probably not as it's your only venue for air to enter your system, and Lord knows how I'd hate for you to either suffocate or choke.  Can you perform ridiculously complex hand gestures such as oh I don't know... say shaking another person's hand?  Just think of all the hand-eye coordination involved... are you sure your brain is getting a enough oxygen through your mouth to support such massive calculations?  What about wiping your own arse?  I am becoming extremely vexed at the notion of a poor mouth breather such as you wandering around aimlessly, pants around your ankles, wads of toilet paper in each hand, drool running down the side of your face, eyes begging someone to help, whilst screaming  "I'm DONE!!!! Anyone?  Someone?  Please?"       Really... your parents should have loved you a little more and taught you the good sense that dirty arses and mouth breathers go hand-in-hand... I mean it seems quite apparent to me that the two notions are synonymous.  4.  Disgustingly Old Chinese People.  You know the ones I'm talking about, they look like the Crypt Keeper with a walker.  Usually they're so hunched over that when they run... HA!... stroll into you they hadn't even realized you were there.  Most of the time... But every so often amid the stream of curses and hexes in Mandarin that seem to be coming forth I notice a gleam in the eye that can only be the last remnants of higher reasoning... Those bastard-o's knew I was standing there!  Shame on you disgustingly old Chinese people... sullying the good name of the not-so-disgustingly old Chinese people who care nothing more in life than to sit and read their newspapers, pick their noses and speak in a language that not even they themselves understand... have you no shame?  And it's a wonder no one likes playing ball with your genetically enhanced athletes anymore... it's just no fun when one team is playing dirty.  Walker my ass...  Well that's enough for now... ... ...for now.  Remember, all said here is in jest (except maybe for the mouth breathers...) so laugh, be happy and drink all the POM your stomach can handle.  As for me kiddies, I'll be making some more wacky observations, till next time, this is Cha saying, "Beware the Man..." ;-)  Peace Always My Friends...

      Truly it has been far too long my friends.  But fear not, assuage the children's trembling (leave Jack-O! out of this), lock away your daughters and prepare for more deeply philosophical and trite remarks.  I am back!  How do I pick up the pieces and fill those famished minds in on the past few weeks of life in Cha-Land?  Well for starters, one of our frequent readers felt  the need to give me a wonderful gift this Christmas season (and I do mean CHRISTMAS...) The gift was a copy of the  Guide to Metrosexuality   Ha ha... very funny.  But for all my joking, there are a few helpful tips found within those pages.  Once I have made enough daily constitutions, I will give a complete review to be sure.  So, now on to what you've all been eagerly awaiting... the rant.  1. What's wrong with "Merry Christmas!"  I mean really, have I so offended you that you wish to drop dead on the spot, only after delivering your final blow of rage directed my way for issuing you, what I take to be, a wish for good health and times this season?  Seriously you are a black hole of holiday cheer!  You're inability to accept a harmless wish of good fortune is so moronic and juvenile if I were only allowed to frap you in public I would.  "Oh, but I don't celebrate Christmas, I'm  insert faith/belief/football team here "  WELL LA-DEE FREAKIN' DA!  I am supremely happy you have found some vehicle of faith, I just don't prescribe to  your  beliefs... and remember, they are just that,  YOUR  beliefs, not mine.  So by wishing you a Merry Christmas, which again in  MY  belief structure is a very kind and goodly thing, I am wishing those kind and goodly things upon you, REGARDLESS of what or who you worship.  So if you choose not to believe in Christmas, simply ignore me!  Are you that devoid of common sense and rational thinking to realize this?  Now normally I do not engage in battles of wit with people like you, as it goes against my code of attacking unarmed individuals, but in this case I'll make an exception and enjoy the flogging I'm going to rain down upon you.  On that note... Have a wonderful New Year! :-)  2. You.  Do you know how annoying you?  Seriously mate, you're like a case of genital warts, always there, flaring up at the most inopportune times, always causing embarrassment... A regular pain in the arse.  I don't like you.  Just being honest. ;-)  3.  Ringworms.  Have you ever met a good one?  So you get past the fecal matter they happen to emerge from, and what do you have left?  A shit dwelling parasite!  Oh yeah, that's something I can warm up to!  Why on Earth did these things evolve?  I have a hard time conceiving of a positive that can be applied to their existence.  ... Hark!  I have thought of a good reason for their existence... which leads me into my next topic.  4.  Information System Majors.  Sure, I know you're sitting there scratching your head asking yourself, "Isn't Cha one of  those  types?  Yes, while I am an IST major, I am  NOT  an IST major, and if you say that I am I will have to whine and complain in a very nasal voice!  The type I'm talking about are those iPod loving cess pools of geekdom who walk into a room and immediately seek out those like them to immediately discuss the latest class action law suit they're launching against Apple or Microsoft or  insert hopeless cause against big business here .  HOW GIVES A FLYING RAT'S ASS!!!  And I quote: (The names have been changed to protect the dorky)  "Hi Mary.  Hi Morty.  Look what I got for Christmas. (She shows a mp3 player) Oh that's nice Mary, but I got an iPod.  Oh Morty, they are so addictive, I wanted one but knew I would never be able to put it down at the expense of hygiene, food and basic bodily functions.  Correct Mary, I too have let myself go, as evident by my continual bouts with acne at age 22 and the fact I'm 150 pounds over weight and no woman has ever seen my dork.  Speaking of which Mary, as I have an iPod, will you have sex with me?  Yes Morty I will... but I get to wear the head phones."   That's how it played out folks, I was there, just sitting in class trying to not catch anything.  How does it relate to ringworms?  These people deserve them.  I know that sounds harsh, but at least it will keep them in their own rooms and not out in public.  Well that's about all for now... I'll try to keep the updates more frequent, but until then my advice for the week.  If it's been itching and burning for more than three days... it will probably burn and itch for another three before it gets better.  Peace Always My Friends... ;-)

      WTF!  Seriously little brains, what is going on in there?  Hello?  This topic is getting it's own post.  1. Diets.  For love of God and all that is holy in this world, please listen very carefully to what I have to say.  All of this Atkins, Mediterranean, South Beach, Raw Foods, Vegan, Macrobiotic, French, Breatharian Diet stuff is not healthy for you!  I'm serious, this isn't my usual joke, well not entirely, but listen to me folks, this stuff has to stop.  Anything in excess is bad, therefore the Atkins is bad, the Vegan is bad, the Raw Foods is bad... see where I'm going with this?  So in response to all the idiotic diets currently surfacing, I'm going to add a few of my own that are no more beneficial or less toxic to you than those listed above.  Some of these have come up in conversation with friends family, some are purely off the cuff, enjoy, eat and be merry!  a. The "Defecate to a Slimmer You" Diet - this one is pretty simple, with the possible inconvenience of finding yourself more than 10 yards away from a private bathroom.  All one has to do for this diet to work is to consume wickedly large amounts of fiber everyday.  Remember Saturday Night Live's add for "Colon Blow"... this is what I'm talking about.  Your body will be passing so much stuff it won't have the time to break down the fats, carbs, nutrients, proteins or anything else for that matter.  But then again, you won't have anytime to do anything such as work, go to class, date, finish writing the missing stories of Chaucer's Canterbury Tales, etc. as you will be chained to your porcelain throne. ... but you'll look marvelous!  b. The "Tapeworm" Diet - Kurt and I discussed this the other day, but original credit must go to Charles O'Connor Jr. as he thought it would be great if he ingested a tape worm to help him lose weight.  I can see this being a big one in Hollywood.  "My  insert starlet's name here  don't you look fabulous!  What's your secret, are you on the worm?"  It's great for that busy individual who has no time for exercise, diet, etc. as the worm does all the work for you.  All you do is eat what you normally do and watch yourself wither away to thin-ness!  It's done wonders for the Zulu Tribe of Africa for years, and now this latest craze is hitting our shores.  Amistad beware, a new ship has landed from the Ivory Coast carrying far more than anyone bargained for... a parasite in the bows of all those aboard!  c.  The "OMG I Look Like That" Diet - this one requires you to hire a morbidly obese person (see any of my previous posts) to follow you around for the rest of your life, and every time you reach for that piece of cake, cheese burger, tub of lard, etc. they say something to the effect of "FEE FI FO FUM... I REMEMBER EATING THAT TOO!"  Thus scaring the ever-lovin' ... out of you (this can also lead to the "Defecate to a Slimmer You" Diet).  If that doesn't work, the giant Jack's Beanstalk intruded upon will proceed to eat in front of you thus turning your stomach so bad it will be a miracle if you can ever look upon food the same way without imagining the massacre you witnessed previously.  This diet does rely upon a weak stomach and a fear of objects larger than you to work effectively.  d.  The "Cha Saved My Life" Diet - this one is my personal favorite as it involves me publicly mocking you.  Much like the "OMG I Look Like That" Diet, this too involves another person.  In this case I follow you around during the day and just berate you up and down for your disgusting appearance.   I would relent my barrage during those moments your trying to get your game on, meeting the boss, telling the officer why this lunatic is riding on the hood of your car, etc. but if you continue to ignore my assault then I'd have to step it up... for your own good of course.  So those were just a few things off the top of my head... Talk to you later folks.  Peace Always My Friends... ;-)

      Picture this scenario: You're visiting a friend in Europe, when all of a sudden terrorist kidnap you and scurry you off to their secret lair (most likely in a run-down industrial part of town as Hollywood wishes us to believe all terrorist hide out... why hasn't the FBI caught on to this?  Anyone?) where they tie you to a small wood chair.  It's at this point that scenes from Resvour Dogs start flashing through your head and all you can think is "DAMNIT!  I just got this ear pierced while I was in Denmark!"    The terrorist start by freaking you out with instruments of torture: a car battery charger with steel wool connected to the terminals, hot iron pokers, maybe some insects of the venomous sort, Barbra Streisand music... all geared to making you break.  But what is it exactly they want?  You're just a college student backpacking from hostel to hostel damnit!  As the no-neck Neanderthal moves your way fist raised, poised to strike he utters the words you've been waiting for: "You will tell me everything I wish to know... or you will beg for death." GREAT, thanks Turbo, COULD HAVE SEEN THAT ONE COMING YOU DOLT!  What's your freakin' question?  Why am I here and not sucking down drinks on the Casa Del Sol?  "Ah, straight to the point my American friend.  I desire the information that is most guarded, most protected by you infidels.  With this bit of information I can successfully infiltrate your life and be able to answer questions that your own friends will be convinced I am you. ... ... I desire to know... YOUR MOTHER'S MAIDEN NAME!!!"  Suddenly a moment of panic, the first real terror you've known since being abducted seizes you and you can feel your innards turning to jelly.  MY GOD!!! You beast, why with that information you could successfully call up my credit card companies and get my account info, you could apply for a new social security card, or login to change the courses I've enrolled in back at Basket-Weaving State U!!! And let's not mention the countless websites I've used my mother's name as either my password or my security question for when I forget my password.  YOU HEARTLESS CRUEL BASTARD!!!  Now relax kiddies, no reefer toking wankers were harmed during the making of this scenario, but the principle is sound.  What is the most prized possession we American's have when it comes to our identity?  It used to be our Social Security number, but I'd wager it's shifted more towards our mother's maiden name than anything else.  Hell with some basic dumpster diving and a mother's maiden name you could successfully apply for a new social security number!  Think about it for a second: Would you rather someone know your mother's maiden name or your email password?  It's easy to change the email password, but you're gonna have a hard time changing her maiden name.  Just something that occurred to me.  Peace Always My Friends and remember... Keep safe the knowledge that drives this country... Mom's name before dad got her drunk enough to say "yes"!

      Greetings & Salutations Friends!  This post will be controversial... I can hear the comments now.  But I want to stress this from the outset, the opinions contained within are my own and I am not advocating your situation is the same or even remotely close to what I describe.  Now, some of the views presented here are a rehash from a conversation with a friend not too long ago, but for most of you this is new material…and that material is the subject of children.  Granted, I'm only 23, so a serious conversation regarding the raising of children may seem a tad premature, however for those who know me I'm more like 23 going on 30 and as such I feel my views on the subject are justified in that I have witnessed many individuals and made a case study out of them.  While my observations are not complete and I do recognize there are situations that will render this conversation null and void, I challenge you the reader to look closely at my argument and if you need further proof of my words, please come down to Philadelphia any day of the week (whether school is in session or not is of little consequence...) and observe the youth of today.  I was recently asked if I was terrified of having children, and the answer is a resounding yes.  Not for the reasons that any 23 year old should be terrified of having children, but because I fear that 95% of the youth today are destined for greatness in some Burger King management position.  Why you ask? The best way to put it is that all kids are inherently little shits. They're stingy, they're mean to other kids, they haven't developed higher reasoning functions yet so you can't talk to them like a normal person, they cry for no reason and expect you to care!  They want and want and want but what do they give? Love? Oh that's sweet... BARF!!!   Seriously, kids don't do a thing but cost you your money, your time and your sanity. Then they grow up, and all you do is worry about them, thank you no. See I was like that till I was about 9, then I realized how much a burden I was on my parents and I stopped asking for stuff. I never asked for anything for my birthday, Christmas, etc. I did my own homework, I didn't get into trouble, I studied… I was a real bore. But my parents never had to worry about me. But there is no guarantee my child will be the same way, and by the time I realize they’re like every other little chit, it will be too late to give him/her away. Nobody wants a 9 year old, how do I unload that on someone else? Fake my own death?   Mind you this is a commentary on your individual family, friends, etc. I feel this way about all children. Weird because I used to think I'd be a great father until I realized I can't stand kids… hence my impending vasectomy. I realize this all sounds pretty harsh, but the way I see it, on top of all that other stuff, everyone else out there is having kids left and right with no regards to how those kids will be raised and if they'll ever be productive members of society. I figure instead of having kids myself, I'll just straighten out everyone else's botched child raising skills and turn their experiments gone awry into useful human beings.  Right now most of you are saying, “Oh that will change once you have kids…” or “You can’t imagine that feeling when you see your newborn…” Yeah, OKAY!  Parents HAVE to say that, and not for the emotional well being of the child, they say it for their own sake so they aren’t constantly reminded of how goofed their lives have become because suddenly… it’s not their life anymore.  The parent’s needs, wants, desires become completely subservient to that of the child.  Again, I fail to see how this is a good deal for the parents?  Is anyone able to step forward with an explanation?  No?  I didn’t think so.  Kids are great… when they’re not your own.  Take my little cousins for example.  I love when I see them at a family member’s house.  They’re very excited and like to play around; everyone there watches them and laughs.  Occasionally I’m so motivated as to pick one up and play around for a while.  And inevitably one will take a toy from the other… it is at this point all hell breaks lose.  Quite literally, the hounds of hell break their chains, jump the river Styx and begin a journey to the surface… Screaming all the way.  Why is this necessary?  Come on, it can’t be fun for the kid crying either, and we all know it sure as hell isn’t fun for those forced to endure the pain of a ruptured ear drum.  Why do we hold adults to a different standard?  Next time your in your board meeting and something doesn’t go your way, shit your pants and begin to scream till your bloody red.  See if you’re called “cute” or if you’re kindly escorted from the premises and told not to return.  Are children the ultimate expression of love between two people?  I suppose they could be, but I know I’ll love my wife enough not to cause her nine months of back pain, water retention, forced sobriety and unusual food cravings.  I also will love her enough to recognize that I am completely inept at training of children and thus am destined to spawn the next social leper.  Seriously folks, I can’t train my damn dog to stop going through the trash, how am I going to handle a being that will be able to out think me by the age of 12?  Can’t anyone see the immanent doom that would accompany me having offspring?  HELLO!!!! I’m thinking on a larger scale here, I’m trying to help out the world for God’s sake!!!  Could I be any more altruistic?  Shesh… kids, can’t live with ‘em… can’t sell them on E-Bay.  Well folks, until next time remember, if you do have kids, leaving a bowl of water, a bag of Cheerios and putting on Sesame Street does not take the place of a trained babysitter.  Peace Always My Friends!

      So the other night my roommate and I were talking, as roommates are apt to do, about relationships and the roles that guys play in said mentioned social contracts.  A lot of focus has been given to those males who exhibit less than positive social traits, such as the jerk, the muscle head, the Armani Exchange fashion d-bag… etc.  But what about those guys who are good boyfriends, but still just as good to poke fun of?  In an effort to expand the worlds understanding of good boyfriends, I felt it was necessary to help categorize guys into certain groups, so women know exactly what they’re getting when they sign on for the proverbial “ride”. (Interpret that however you see fit…)  Case Study 1: The Baggage Handler (Also known as “The Skycap”) – This is the guy who women with excessive amounts of baggage flock to as if he were the last bag of testosterone on the planet.  Why are women, with problems so massive that any guy would have simply given up and run off into the woods to live amongst the animals, attracted to this gentleman?  Because Baggage Handlers are notorious for not seeing the impending doom that waits just over the next horizon, and as such think to themselves, “Well this isn’t so bad… we can handle this!” HA!  It is usually at that precise moment that the meteors begin to fall from the sky, the seas boil, the rivers to turn blood… I’ve seen it a thousand times.  It’s really quite tragic.  So inevitably, the Baggage Handler suffers an on-the-job injury and is sidelined for the rest of the season, forced to collect workman’s comp in the form of ex-relationships, girls brought home from bars, etc.  It is during this rest period the Baggage Handler rebuilds his game in order to go back to work, carrying the weight of his girlfriends past experiences with him until such a time as his back gives out again.  It’s a vicious cycle…   Case Study 2: The Missionary (Sometimes referred to as the Jimmy Carter Boyfriend) – While Skycaps may not be able to see impending doom around the next bend, Missionaries actively seek out doom in an effort to help those unfortunates.  Missionary work almost always starts with a friendship, usually a friendship that has developed rapidly over a relatively short amount of time (think here of that new girl who game to your school that no one really talked to you, but for some reason you were drawn to her and quickly developed a strong and fast friendship.) and at some point in that friendship you uncover a myriad of past experiences that have helped shape, mold and in most cases scar the interest of your desire.  It is at this point the Missionary says to themselves, “I am good for this individual.  I would never do those things to her, I truly love her for who she is, with all her past troubles, they don’t bother me, and I can show her a better, happier world.” (At this point “A Whole New World” made famous from the Disney movie “Aladdin” usually starts playing the background somewhere… it’s a strange coincidence but it has been observed by the scientific community and currently CERN is investigating…)  And for a time, all is well in the cosmos.  The two enter a loving and lasting relationship that is fulfilling to both.  The woman is given unadulterated love, and the Missionary find purpose and meaning in his love by helping her work through her past demons.  But as with all religious callings, the Missionary is not the instrument of his own destiny, and must answer the call of a higher power.  The Missionary will inevitably be drawn at some point to another trouble soul, not for lack of love of his current calling… far from it!  He would gladly sacrifice his dignity, physical & emotional well being to save them an ounce of pain, but therein lies the problem.  There are no more pains, no more problems, the original sad case has realized that life is good and is happy about her station… the Missionary’s work is over and he must move on.  For those who thinks this sounds cruel, remember… the Missionary is only answering to a higher power, and who are we to question the wisdom of that power?    Case Study 3:  The Surfer (Often referred to as “Brah” or “Dude”) – Even the most secure and steady of relationships will at some point encounter troubled waters.  This is just a fact of life and should not be fretted over as the inevitability of it all calls for an individual who can deal with the issue at hand and make sure the relationship survives the shark attack.  Women are, by nature and I do not mean this as a derogatory remark, are emotional beings.  This is one of their strongest assets, but in a relationship when a monster wave has just hit, those emotions if left unchecked can be extremely detrimental to the cause.  So what makes the Surfer so trained to deal with these situations?  It’s really a quite simple philosophy; an ounce of prevention goes a long way in keeping the relationship healthy.  I’ll explain.  The Surfer knows that his partner is most likely the be-all-end-all and would not ever risk losing her.  It’s like finding that perfect pipe to surf, an elusive gift from nature and it is to be cherished.  But does the Surfer patiently wait in the water for said mentioned pipe, never surfing another wave until the pipe comes?  Obviously no, and just like the real athlete of the same name, our Surfer, while undyingly loyal to the ying to his yang, realizes that a little flirting here and there with other chicas keeps his game sharp and makes he still feel wanted and appreciated.  The longest of relationships tend to result in both members taking the other for granted, by surfing, the Surfer is fulfilling that undeniable male need to feel wanted, and realizing just how good his partner is, and leaving her would be a mistake of colossal proportions.  The Surfer does this effortlessly, and makes no attempt to work his game.  Rather, it is just his personality that allows for harmless comments and remarks to float out there that would, coming from anyone else, be misinterpreted by the fairer sex as overt strives into the garden of femininity.  The insecure woman may misinterpret these actions as attempts to land another surfing spot, but they are greatly mistaken.  Once both parties realize the other is not going anywhere, this Surfer has successfully unlocked the gates to nirvana and will enjoy the rest of his days in perfect bliss and harmony.  That's about it for now, Peace Always My Friends and remember ladies, he's probably going to screw up and be a mystery to you at times, but that ain't nothing compared to what you put us through. ;-)

      As a friend of mine is want to say, "Goddamn!" it has been a while my friends.  I do apologize, but my life has been going through many changes of late.  For those who may not know I graduated, I am moving to Hawai'i and I have developed a third nipple.  ... Wait scratch that last one.  After graduation, my numero uno partner in crime and all things shady, and I decided to take a little road trip.  I thought it would be a nice start to the blogging season (I'm working full time now until I leave for Biloxi, Mississippi) to share with you my journal entries from the road trip to end all road trips.   Disclaimer: The contents of this journal were events that occurred usually after vast consumption of alcohol.  If the event described was done sober, there is also a fair chance it was recorded while under the influence of spirits and as such, all entries must be taken with a grain of salt.  That being said... enjoy!   Day 1: Well we're off.  Marco and I on the open road.  First stop his parents house.  God we're such pussy's.  Can't even start a road trip without hitting up are 'rents for food.  Day 2: We just left Clevland and the Rock n' Roll Hall of Fame... ehh?  The girls at Gloria Jean's Coffee liked Marco's rendition of Michelle Branch.  Everyone in Cleveland is either really, really, REALLY nice or just gay... I can't decide. 5:16 PM EST - We just left Notre Dame... great soap in their bathrooms, truly the mark of a spectacular university.  Day 3: Today we hit up Chicago.  "Hey look, there's that building over there." Good one Marco... truly staggering the intellect we're exerting on this trip.  Whoever said the top of the Sears Tower was a good place to pick up chicks is full of shaite.  The Hancock Building "Big John" was our first stop.  Why did they name a building Big John that also has "cock" in it's name is a mystery to me?  Is no one in Chicago as immature as me to see the jokes that can be made out of this one?  The public library was nice, but we could have done with out the smelly dreads dude.  There's always gotta be one... damn Rastifarians!  Tonight we're going to paint the town red... or white, whatever works.  Day 4: So do you have one of those "I came to Chicago and decided to break up with my girlfriend and move to Hawai'i" gifts?  No?  Okay I guess a thermos will do.  So last night the Gap "guy" told us to go to "Hogs & Hunnies", but guess what?  They aren't open till Wednesday, silly fagget.  Remember not to take advice from guys hitting on you from behind the Gap counter... guess it's time to find a new stock broker then... damn it.  So back to our night, it ended up okay because we then found a bar called "North Beach" and met Jean. 	Drink One: We took our Chaser pills, Marco's face is numb and I'm losing function of my legs.  We decide to play pool.  Games 1 & 2 go to Marco... is that dance 	really necessary buddy? 	Drink Two: We're getting louder.  Marco starts throwing quarters around.  Our flirting with Jean and the African Princess is escalating.  Holy Shaite, Jean actually 	does know all the lyrics to REM's "It's the End of the World"... I'm going to marry this woman.  Goddamn these drinks are good (20 ozs of Jack and Coke baby!)  	Game 3 mine, Marco took Game 4... Okay Stripes, you rule.  Time to go.  We take a cab to Division Street. 	Drink Three: Bootleggers gives us our third drink for three.  They're hurting for business tonight.  We need food, stat!  Some pizza joint, whatever... freakin' ass at 	this point would suffice.  "We should go to a bar that's got some food... you know... like bar food."  Brilliant Cha... brilliant.  George W. reads quotes from me and 	says "Man even I don't sound that stupid..."  No bar food here, pizza will do. 	Drink Four: She-nannigans... this place is dead.  We attempt to buy two homely looking girls drinks & end up offending the 400 lb bartender.  Time to go! 	Drink Five: Mother's Too is the bar.  2nd round of Chaser pills.  Some talkative slowmo is hitting on me, I think Marco is getting jealous.  We decide to hustle this 	one pool table.  "The one's a  insert slur here , so you know he likes to bet!"  I can never run for president... ever. 	Drink Six: We crank call an old acquaintance of Marco & Mine... BONG!!!  Queer guy still talking politics... time to go!  Cab ride to strip club, the freaking place is 	closing early.  We're left with no choices at this point... Escort Services.  Chicago... great town... expensive hookers.  (Should be a bumper sticker or something...)  	$300 per hour, per girl??? F'dat!  Time for a smoke to clear our heads.  Hold up... two sisters on a road trip heading east outside of our hotel smoking... Thank you 	God!!!  Cherish you are so ours... oh yeah... good night to you too.  Tease.  Marco asks the concierge where we can get some "escorts" (read here as "Where's 	the red light district?")  He doesn't seemed nearly as amused as we are... f' him.  Blig-a-dee-blam... we're out. Day 5: Following morning, Operation Get Out of Paying $60 for Parking fails despite a marvelous performance by Marco with his new Bohemian friend.  Over pancakes and bacon we overhear a disgusting conversation.  Marco fake throws up & offends some bitch.  Are we still drunk?  It's been a blast Chicago, but I think it's about time we head back east.  We've got about 14 hours of driving to do today, let's roll!  Illinois, Indiana, Ohio and about half of Pennsylvania go by okay, then we met Trooper Lhf.  (No that's not a typo... how the freak can you have a name without any vowels?)  Decides to give us a speeding ticket.  F'ing man always coming down on us.  (Side note, things to do when waiting for the dick to bring your ticket back: 1) List the things you're going to tell him off for when he gets back.  2) Make erratic movements like diving for something under your seat... see if the trooper freaks out.  3) Switch seats with whoever was driving, see if the guy with the really cool hat notices.  4) Go Turret’s on his ass, the claim you'll get the ACLU on board if he gives you any crap about your stress induced disorder.  5) Peel out from your parked position after the dude gives you your ticket, see if he has the balls to follow.)  Make it the rest of the way home without event... what a trip.  Well that's the long and short of the trip.  I'm sure there are some items I forgot to record, if they're of note I'll post them.    Peace Always My Friends and remember, you too can have fun in a strange city, just remember to burn your fingertips off with acid so they can't identify your handiwork!  Until next time keep playing with matches! :-)

      Oh he's back and with a vengeance. So what you ask could possibly spark my ire on this a most beautiful of days? Well, while is related to the Gallery in that it was in a store that resides within said mentioned walls of scum... the Gallery itself is not the source of my discontent. Let me start from the beginning...  As I stood in line waiting to purchase three cards for this upcoming weekend's celebrations (Mother's Day and my brother's birthday), I was struck with... a vision? An epiphany? No, perhaps a cosmic clarity describes it best... yes I like the sound of that. Cards... birthday cards... holiday cards (Father's Day, Mother's Day, Arbor Day... whatever...) etc... ... (So now the frame of mind is setup... prepare yourselves for the cosmic clarity that was bestowed upon me...) ... ...           ...                     ...                               What the fuck?   I mean REALLY... what on Earth does a card do? Let's break this one down shall we?  Let's take the aforementioned holiday cards... in this case Mother's Day. Why do we as a society feel obligated to patron stores built specifically around the model of selling recycled pieces of paper that contain some of the most gross exaggerations ever pushed upon the people of Earth ("Oh Mother... you're love is that which brings the sun to bear upon the faces of those who yearn for your compassion..." etc. etc. etc...) Who the freak are we sending a Mother's Day card to? Shiva? The Blessed Mother? An androgynous form of God Him/Herself? Do you think God sits up there in heaven in just a rage of fury when he reads this cards? People don't pray to God with the fervor that they so easily send to others via the United States Postal System. Ever wonder why you never heard of any great greeting cards writers? (Because they're obviously disgustingly gifted at their craft... making someone you could give a rats ass about feel like you actually care for them OR perpetuating the belief that you walk around worshiping the receiver of your card on a level near divine) Why no great card writers? Simple... God's pissed! He probably strikes them down a regular basis. Some dude walking down the street... just emailed off his latest catchy card text (that more closely resembles the speech from a eulogy than a wish for good health)... when BLAM!!! Freakin' lightning bolt up the ass... I've seen it a thousand times. Why do you think I don't have any card writing friends? Because I don't want to be near them if they piss the Big Guy off like they're so apt to do.  Why can't we simply write a letter to our loved ones on those days which normally "require" some sort of card? Seriously, have you ever found a card that said exactly what you wanted it to? No and if you have go suck Desert Eagle because you're too weak minded to imagine anything better than a Hallmark card. Would you not rather receive a nicely worded and truthful letter/note that says "Mom... What can I say? I love you. You don't, as Hallmark/American Greetings/etc. would have us believe make the world revolve around the sun... but you did make sure I was a success in life because you cared enough to show me... not just tell me... but show me what is good and what is right in this world. For that and all the other things I never even knew you were doing to make my life the wonderful experience it is... Thank you!" Now, was that so hard? And who's mother wouldn't appreciate something as heartfelt and genuine as that? Every mom wants that... but here lies the real sickness affecting us as Americans... deep down inside, no matter how poetic, how truthful, how believable your note/letter is... some part of us will feel slighted, even a tad miffed, that we didn't receive a card. "(Inner voice saying) Wow, they really wrote some beautiful things... what couldn't they have written that on the inside of a card though?"   But are cards the real problem here? Is it truly Hallmark that is chanting the evil incantation, drawing forth the fiends from the depths of hell into our lives? I think it goes deeper than that... I think the true cancer lies in the holiday itself. What is Father's Day/Mother's Day/Groundhog Day if you don't live up to the ideals and meaning of those most sacred of secular holidays each and every day of your life? If you never speak to your parents, or even care to check if Punxsutawney Phil sees his shadow, why would you mock them one day a year with your obvious lies and blatant attempt to reconcile your own conscience with a piece of crap card and well wishes?   Well, I've wasted enough of your time for now. Until next time remember, always check your shoes before putting them on in the morning... freakin' spider, I'm still walking with a limp... mutha ... Peace Always My Friends!

      Ahh... the local morning news.&nbsp; Here in Biloxi, MS it's always an interesting show.&nbsp; The general format goes something like this:  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Top National Headlines (1 min)  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Top Local Headlines (10 mins)  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Run down on those busted for Meth (4 mins)  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. Minutes from the last city council meeting (3 mins)  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5.&nbsp;Sentencing notices for murders, usually associated with MS rather lose carry laws. (2 mins)  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6. Rest of the show is filled with fluff stories, all of which are disturbing to a Yankee like me.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Ever see Deliverance?)  I watch this show with masked bemusement each morning while I get ready for the day's activities, but today I viewed the program with a more discerning eye and I noted a few things.&nbsp; Most of what I'll talk about actually relates to the national stories, but I'll cover them here as well.   For Local Stories:  1) What's with all the meth labs down here?&nbsp; Every other day the 5-O are busting another group of MS Delta rejects who get caught either a) blowing themselves up or b) peddling their wares to some undercover officer.&nbsp; The group that falls into section a I have nothing to say about except "Keep up the good work!" but to those in section b I have to wonder how you could sell your cheap high to the police with such staggering efficiency.&nbsp; According to reports down here, I'd be hard pressed to find a cop who isn't carrying meth on him, from a bust earlier that night of course.&nbsp; "Officer, I know you pulled me over for speeding, but just outta curiosity, got any meth on you?&nbsp; And if so what's the asking price?"   For National Stories:  1) KFC and their number one supplier are in trouble again.&nbsp; Evidently PETA sent an investigator in with a hidden camera (one has to wonder why anyone would let these guys in anywhere... they're always sneaking those pesky little cameras in... Oh I'm being told they were undercover... damn tree huggers, getting smarter every day.)&nbsp; The super sleuth was able to film damning footage of workers hurling chickens against a wall, stomping on them, and at one point one working reached up and removed some feathers exposing one hen's breast. (Both are claiming it was a molting malfunction.)&nbsp; Obviously the authorities are upset over this video footage, and while I totally agree it's distasteful and stuff better off not spoken about at the dinner table, what really are we upset about?&nbsp; The chicken, like most beings that walk this planet including those around you, lack the higher mental processing ability to exhibit sentience and therefore are unaware of what's happening around them.&nbsp; They are driving by basic needs and instincts, not a desire to please their mate, impress the boss in order to get a raise, etc.&nbsp; So whether the chicken dies by electrocution, having it's neck snapped, being crushed under the heal of a Dickie boot, does it really matter?&nbsp; I'm not being cruel and insensitive, I'm just drawing attention to the fact we seem more concerned with the final moments of a freakin' chicken then we do the lives of those living around us.&nbsp; I can just see PETA's new advertising campaign, "In 2003 President Bush authorized troops to invade Iraq, killing our babies for nothing other than boosting his ego.&nbsp; Perhaps more egregious, President Bush has allowed poultry abuse to thrive.&nbsp; Please vote for Kerry, a big lover of chickens."&nbsp; (Try to keep that ad on the down low... I was granted a private screening of it with Michael Moore and Barbara Streisland and they made me pinky swear not to tell!)&nbsp; Have I made my point?&nbsp; So a few chickens have to die, but I'll be damned if I give up my finger lickin' good!   2)&nbsp;One of President Bush's daughters was caught on tape sticking her tongue out to a group of reporters.&nbsp; Why the hell was this on the NATIONAL MORNING NEWS?&nbsp; Have we lost all sense of humor and feel the need to show an individual, no matter how prominent (and let's be brutally honest... how prominent are the Bush daughters?) having a little harmless fun?&nbsp; I mean come on it's not like she was drunk or high at the time!   So what's it all mean?&nbsp; I think the news is a constant reminder of how far out of whack our priorities have become.&nbsp; Seems to me we're all more concerned with the appearance of our national leaders than their performance, we'd rather hear meaningless fluff stories than actually discuss a topic that matters to the welfare of our fellow man, and life has become to trivial that the good someone does will always be overshadowed by the negative actions of a few.&nbsp; Just my thoughts...  So until next time remember the great words of Van Wilder "Don't take life to seriously... you'll never get out alive."&nbsp; Peace Always My Friends...

      Have you ever sat in a class full of individuals and realized beyond a shadow of a doubt that the human brain is at last finally classified as an endangered species?&nbsp; It's not that I am possessed of some supreme intellect (I'm still waiting for my certificate...) but I do think that the basic human thought patterns have changed somewhat over the millennium.&nbsp; For instance...  &nbsp;  1. The military used to be a bastion of cold hearted neutrality.&nbsp; If one didn't like a situation, one had two options: a) suck it up and make due or b) suck it up and make due.&nbsp; But today because of the thoughts of others, words like "fair" enter the minds of some and suddenly people think the military gives a hoot about what they want.&nbsp; I mean... if the military actually cared what you wanted we wouldn't be wearing polyester uniforms!!!  &nbsp;  2. Basic Terminology: Down Friday - refers to every other Friday which is an off day from work because you spent an extra hour each day the previous two weeks at the office.&nbsp; So now that we have that out of the way, here's a conversation from earlier.&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp; Person 1: "So what's going on next Friday?"&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp; Person 2:&nbsp;"Oh I do believe it's a down Friday."  &nbsp;&nbsp; Person 1: "Great, so what will we have due in class?"&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp; Person 2: "Nothing... it's a down Friday, as in there is no class."&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp; Person 1: "So when is the test?&nbsp; Saturday or Sunday?"&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp; Person 2: "Have we ever tested on the weekend?&nbsp; Or have we ever had class on  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp;weekend?"&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp; Person 1: "Well... no... so will the test be that Friday?"&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp; Person 2: "NO!!! WE'RE OFF FRIDAY... NO CLASS... NO FREAKIN' TEST EITHER!!!"&nbsp;  And this was from the most seasoned person in our class... Staggering... truly staggering.   Oh I know I seem a tad harsh in my assessment of the brain's de-evolution, but I'm rather disturbed by the prospect of this being "it".&nbsp; Have we reached the evolutionary glass ceiling?&nbsp; At what point does rationality over ride common ignorance and allow those around us to break through the shield of mental stagnation that has kept so many of us from realizing our potential as functioning, happy individuals?&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Perhaps I'm a dreamer, perhaps I hold people to too high a standard, but maybe I just see something better within all of us that if we only allow it to escape this world, OUR world would be so much a better place.  &nbsp;  I suppose over the next few days I'll make my posts about what I mean specifically, but if you have ideas, please forward them along.  &nbsp;  Until next time, remember that even though I'm far from home... I can still make you all miserably happy while I'm here. :-D  &nbsp;  Peace Always My Friends...
