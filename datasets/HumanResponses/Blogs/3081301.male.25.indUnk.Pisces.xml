      About a month ago, a friend of mine named Lauren was beaten by this guy friend of hers.  I had felt a rage inside of me that I had not felt in ages.  I was going to kill him in the slowest, most torturous fashion I could think of with whatever instruments I could think of (hatchet, staple gun, etc.).  Unfortunately, Lauren did not want me to do anything to him because she didn't want me to go to jail.  She also said that if I retaliated, this guy would feel vindicated in what he did in the first place.  But because I care so much about this girl, my anger would not be so easily sated.  I decided to write a poem about what I was going to do to him.  This is for you, Austin O'Malley:  SAFE  You think you're a man You think you know what a man is Oh yeah, you're a big man You scared her to death With your hand around her neck Oh, what a great big man you are You punched her in the face And busted her lip Yeah, you showed her who's in charge But there's just one thing That I want you to know Just who in the fuck are you?  So tell me now How did it feel? To feel her life wilting in your grasp It's so unlike any power That you've ever known You could kill her anytime you want  Are you proud of yourself Did you run off and gloat 'Cause you showed her you were the boss But as big of a man As you think you are There's always someone bigger  I've never pretended to be a saint I've been a sinner my whole life And there's one more sin inside of me Me and you and this knife  Tell me how brave you were When you had taken total control Don't tell me I don't want to do this I've already sold my soul  There's nothing left for me to save Given it up to make you pay How do you want it, standing up Or on your knees so you can pray  No God can save you now You've sealed your own fate I don't want to hear you're sorry I'm afraid it's much too late I know you wish you could take it back That's something I wish too But since we can't go in the past I guess this will have to do Do you know how fear tastes? I bet somehow it's not as sweet But to see your blood running down you neck Now that's a tasty treat  I know I probably won't get away with it Who says that's even a concern All that matters is that I take my time So you get what you deserve I know you're probably wondering What business is this of mine Let's just say that when it comes to her I've never met someone so kind  That's something I don't understand What could she have done to make you put your hands On her neck and squeeze And make her say pretty please  Let's get something straight I don't want to hear your side I've had enough of this little chat Now it's time for you to die  I know she probably didn't want me to kill But hindsight sees things too late I've nothing to throw away My whole life has been a waste At least my heart was in the right place I only wanted her to be safe

      Women.  An age old quandary, to be sure.  The only thing I know is that I know jack and crap about them.  The beginning of any relationship is a poker match that never fails to frustrate at least one of the players.  It's no surprise that most marriages don't last.  Imagine having to deal with this bullshit 24/fucking/7. On second thought, don't.  You'll get an aneurysm.  Which, if you're married, you are probably wishing for one right about now.

      My last post blasted women. Today, I will heap some praise. It just so happens that one of the best bands today is led by a woman.  The Distillers are fronted by Brody Dalle (she's a woman in spite of her name), a more kickass, less drugged out version of Courtney Love. Brody was married to Rancid frontman Tim Armstrong until she divorced him for one of those nameless Queens Of the Stone Age guys.  Unlike Courtney Love (who dumped that annoying pissant Billy Corgan for Kurt Cobain), Brody doesn't feel the need to latch onto someone more famous than herself or her last significant other. The Distillers bury anything that Hole has ever done, even  Live Through This  (the Hole album Kurt wrote).  Also, while discarding her husband in a shitty fashion, at least Brody didn't kill or have him killed like other certain untalented smackwhores. While this is hardly a ringing endorsement for Ms. Dalle as a woman, I'm merely putting things into perspective.  So, to sum up, the Distillers are kickass (even though they cancelled a show I was supposed to go to and didn't find out until I got to the club because Brody had a problem with her throat most likely due to gargling too much cock) and Courtney Love is a fucking mess that makes the wastebags in  Trainspotting  look like Wall Street tycoons.  I guess I didn't really have anything nice to say, after all.

      The word of the day is tired.  I'm fucking tired tonight. Tired from busting my ass at work and only hearing that I don't do enough around the house. Fuck this shit.  I am also tired of women (for the most part). I am mainly tired of being made to think I am at their mercy (which, more often than not, I am). I am tired of  feeling too depressed in my down time from work to do anything other than wait by the phone like a patient lapdog.  Why do I even put up with this bullshit?  Oh yeah. Now I remember.  I wasn't always this big a pussy. I often miss not giving a shit about anyone but myself. I was the biggest hardass I knew. Now look how the mighty have fallen. And I must have fallen really hard because the notion of rising again is nowhere in sight. Damn it.

      Where in the fuck is Surge? You know, the Coke version of Mountain Dew? The soda that makes other sodas taste like piss when compared? I was just in Iowa (hailing not so proudly from Illinois) and I was sure that some po-dunk fucking convenience store or gas station would have it. But alas, I was wrong. What is wrong with the world today?  2 minutes later...  I just visited the Coke website. It seems that Surge is gone. Mello Yello has taken its place. I am mighty disappointed by this treachery that Coke has befallen me. They still sell Tab, even though it is known to cause cancer. What was so bad about Surge? Did it kick too much ass for any one person to handle? I'll be the judge of that. I have consumed quite a large serving of Surge in a short amount of time and I'm fine. Fucking cock-gargling pieces of shit at the Coca-Cola HQ. Add them to the list of groups that need to be killed.

      I know what you're thinking. What happened to that bile-spewing psychopath we have come to know? Well, even the best of us have one weakness. Luckily, I only have one...unlike most of you pathetic fucks.  Today brings with it a new rant. Something has to be done about the WB.  Have you ever seen a network filled with so many boring shows? Even CBS, which was once only for geezers over 60 with shows like  Murder She Wrote , is edgier thanks to  CSI  and  The Handler .  These pussies at the WB are canceling the only show they have with any balls at all:  Angel . I admit that I am a fan of the  Buffy the Vampire Slayer  universe. What started as just wanting to watch Sarah Michelle Gellar run around in tube tops, grew into a real respect for the show that allowed me to watch it even after she went anorexic had no tits left.  After  Buffy  ended, I was left with only 3 T.V. programs:  Alias ,  The Sopranos , and  The Shield . Not coincidentally, these 3 shows kick the most ass (literally) of any that still produce new episodes.  Angel  satisfied my fix for demon killings and gore and vampires and zombies: all the makings of classic television. And now, it is going away because a bunch of bloated, self-important honkies don't think it fits in with the rest of their programs. They're right. It's not wholesome, safe, vanilla, cowardice bullshit. It is so unlike anything else that is out right now, it boggles the mind why anyone would want to remove its original flavor from the airwaves. And isn't variety the fucking point? Who the fuck wants to watch the same channel all day with the same show continuously?  Can anyone tell me the difference between  Dawson's Creek ,  Gilmore Girls , or whatever other bullshit the WB shoves down the throats of all of us non-teenage girls? Well, if they need something shoved down  their  throats, I've got just the thing.  So, to sum up,  fuck the WB  and the collective horse they rode in on. Let us rise up and slay this monster of industry! Let your voice be heard! Unless you are one of those teenage girls* who actually watch the horseturd programs on the WB, in which case your throats still have my cock down them so no one will hear you anyway.  *Let it be known that all the teenage girls I have referred would be, in fact, 18 & over.

      I haven't been very serious in my writings, as of late. I have used insults and humor to mask, as well as distract myself from, what has really been going on in my head. I have been completely enamored by this girl. Meeting her and being around her for these past few months has shown me that my life was a self-imposed rut. Though younger and occasionally even crazier than I am, she had convinced me that I had been holding on to my past and using it to prevent myself from moving on and pursuing happiness.  The problem is that once I figured all of this out, I found that she was what had made me happy. She made me want to break out of the numbed, reclusive stupor I had been in for the past two-plus years.  Some things in my past I can not ignore. I have been hurt to the point of wanting to end it all. I've been betrayed within what I thought was love. I had sold my soul to another a long time ago. I was not going to go through that again, not without knowing she felt even somewhat the same way about me.  I have spent the last two months attempting to decode things she has said to me to possibly come to some kind of conclusion. I never could.  The last time I had spoken to her was the night she and I were supposed to go to see the Distillers concert a month ago. I wanted to tell her that night but it seemed that she was bothered by something, so I figured it wasn't the right time. Two days later, we were supposed to go see a movie together but that never came to pass. I called her house and she wasn't home.  After many attempts to contact her, she finally called me just over two weeks ago, leaving a message that she was sorry that she had been "sort of missing". I called her the next day at 2:00 in the afternoon and she apologized further but said that I had woken her. I apologized in turn. She said that she would call me when she woke up. She never called.  I have tried to call her or write her e-mails, anything to make contact. Finally, two days ago, I sent her a text message from my cell phone to her e-mail saying that "I really liked you". The past tense was used to perhaps draw her out. She responded with a message back to my phone, "Forgive me but who is this?". I figured since my message came from my phone and that I didn't disclose my own name in the message that she really didn't know who it was. I replied with my name. I have heard nothing after that.  There are times when I am on pins and needles waiting for any kind of response. There are other times that I'm just glad I finally have this monkey off of my back. The only thing I know for sure is that this girl, Lauren Falasz, means a great deal to me; more than I will ever care to admit.  So if anyone who knows her reads this, please tell her that Dave misses her.  Hopefully, this is the last sappy thing I  ever  write.

      It is astonishing what passes for music these days. The pop music scene is a total fucking mess. Every band sounds the same. It's getting to be how it was 15 years ago, when hair metal ruled (stupid pun, yes?). It took a no-frills, no bullshit band from Seattle named Nirvana to change the landscape of music for, what we thought was, forever.  Every day since Kurt's been gone, every thing has deteriorated and stagnated to an alarming level. Even bands that were once unstoppable have either broken up or gotten old and crappy. They include:  Metallica (let's face facts, they suck now) Guns N' Roses (who knows if they still even exist) R.E.M. (let's replace our drummer with...a big piece of shit) Faith No More (5 guys who hated each other, I dig that) Pantera (the 2 new bands that were spawned from their demise are shitpieces) The Misfits (surprisingly enough, had 2 good albums without Glenn Danzig...well, that's over) Screaming Trees (singer Mark Lanegan still kicks ass) A Perfect Circle (followed up classic debut with a festering ass boil) Soundgarden & Rage Against the Machine (Audioslave just ain't got that swing) AC/DC (every fucking song is the same now...bad)  We have lost many soldiers in the fight against shit music. But hope still remains. We still have:  Sonic Youth (shitkicking 20 plus years and counting) Lacuna Coil (the best band most have never heard of) Entwine (the 2nd best band most have never heard of) Type O Negative The Distillers Nine Inch Nails Henry Rollins (be it solo, Rollins Band, or Black Flag - he's still the man) Rob Zombie My Life With the Thrill Kill Kult (songs are all about sex, drugs, and the devil; need I say more) Black Label Society  So you see, there are options when it comes to listening to music. It's just that turning on your radio is not one of them.

      Here is a new word to put into your vocabulary. I read that it was a new line of beanie baby, but I think it sounds better as a nuts reference:  Pluffies  "I'm going to kick you in the  pluffies  if you don't stop playing that fucking Usher song over and over again, bitch!"  Also, I think the term "fluffernutter" should refer to someone who is worth nothing more than that person that keeps guys' dicks hard on the sets of porno flicks.  "Quasi-fag punch" may just be the greatest insult ever, even better than one that this 10 year old used while in a fight with another pre-pubescent assgargler: cockmongerer.  "Dave Matthews is a  fluffernutter , not to mention a  quasi-fag punch  and  cockmongerer ."  Anarchy, hate. I'm out, whores.

      I haven't seen a movie with as little story, as there was in  Van Helsing , in a long time.  I would probably have to say that it is one of the most ill-conceived pictures since  Timecop . There was actually a moment while I was torturing myself with this colossal shitbomb that I almost wanted to change theaters to see the Olsen twin movie. Not since I was tempted to walk out of  Queen Of the Damned  to see  Crossroads , have I been so full of regret in my movie choice.  Aside from Kate Beckinsale being hot, there is no point in watching this lump of crap.   Coming soon... People Who Should Be Killed Part II

      I was flipping channels before  The Shield  came on (as everything else on TV is dung), and I saw MTV's Making the Band. In what way is this rag tag group of talentless, non-instrument playing dirtbags a band.  Furthermore, what does Pluffy Daddy know about music, much less a band. Isn't he the guy who danced in Biggie's videos, occasionally muttering shit under his breath? If you are going to make a band, don't be pussies about it. If I were to create the greatest band the world has ever known (using people that are currently alive, obviously), it would be the following:  Drums: Raymond Herrera from Fear Factory  It would have been Nick Menza, formerly of Megadeth, but I have no idea if he's still alive or not.  Bass: Jason Newsted from Voivod  Since I don't think you need to have a great bass player, just someone to take up space and get the crowd going, Jason's your man.  Rhythm Guitar (as every band should have 2 guitar players): Kenny Hickey from Type O Negative  He's the lead guitarist in that band, but his playing is not exactly demanding. A perfect fit here.  Lead Guitar: Zakk Wylde  If you need to ask why, you are retardo.  Singer: (tie) Cristina Scabbia from Lacuna Coil Chris Cornell from Audioslave  The 2 best rock vocalists today for their respective genders. Once again, if you have not heard Lacuna Coil, stop being such a lazy jagoff and get on it.

      These bastards, or at least the patrons, at urbandictionary.com are a bunch of fucking Nazi pricks who think that they are soooo clever.   Well guess what, kiddies? You are pretty original. Nothing is quite like those brilliant definitions you geniuses come up with for already existing words. Just as no pile of dogshit is exactly alike, you guys are very original.  Here in The Zero, we will come up with our own words or, at least, words that not every one and their piss-stained grandmother knows about.  So, the word for today is:  Cockblister  Because the blister I got on my dick from fucking all your sisters is more enjoyable than reading your retarded meanings of every day words like this one from obvious Rhodes scholar Alex Forbes:  Ocean      deep(words,thoughts,poems, and literature)      " Dog, that poem is ocean"  That is so fucking brilliant, I think I may shit myself. Better yet, I'm going to shit ocean in your mouth, Alex. How's that for deep, you fucking clownass?

      Throughout the mid-'80s and '90s, the Utah Jazz were the most annoying team to watch play basketball. One reason was the greatly pesky shitass named John Stockton. That dirty fucking bastard. He is the all-time NBA assist leader because he played for 36 seasons, not because he is any good.  The other is Karl Malone. I hate this cocky prick. Another guy just hanging on for dear life for some personal glory. He's second on the all-time NBA scoring list, one spot ahead of the great one himself, Michael Jordan. If Jordan had kept playing continuously instead of retiring twice, he would have passed Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and left Malone's dead ass in the dust.  It gives me great pleasure to know that Stockton will never win a championship because he is the most annoying little shit to ever lace on high tops. However, Malone is still dragging his carcass all over for my new team to hate: the Lakers.  Is it just because of Malone that I hate the Lakers? That would normally be enough, but that is not the case.  Shaq: "When not missing any shot that isn't a dunk, I like to do a shitty job rapping and acting in assorted commercials." Thank Christ that someone finally said enough with the movies.  Kobe: Who is the most notorious criminal athlete in L.A. other than O.J.?  The only person I like on that team is Gary Payton. And that is only because he has no desire to be there. He should purposely play shitty just so that Karl Malone can never get a ring.  Anyone who likes Karl Malone is just kidding themselves about their obvious homosexuality. So, don't be gay and hate Karl Malone like every other red-blooded American.  As a side note, 87% of gay guys hate Karl Malone as well.

      As this is going to be the last blog I do for at least a while, I figured I should go out with a bang. I am self-imposing a lengthy leave of absence but there are going to be some guest complainers to take up the slack. Now, let's quit fucking crying and kill some assholes:   1. J-Lo ('nuff said)  2. Karl Malone, er, the Lakers except Gary Payton  3. Aerosmith, Rolling Stones, and Kiss (they've had their time, now something drastic needs to be done)  4. Lars Ulrich (you've heard Metallica's last 3 albums and let's not forget the Napster fiasco)  5. Insane Ass Clown Posse  6. Ja Rule, Ludacris, and Mystikal (I'm unsure which is which)  7. Whoever's idea it was to get rid of Surge  8. The executives, producers, actors, and directors associated with the WB  9. John Elway (it was bad enough when he was playing and now he's on a fucking commercial; at least before there was a helmet covering his horseface) 10. Axl Rose (this way we don't have to wonder if Guns N' Roses still exists) 11. All the Osbournes except Ozzy 12. Dave Matthews (my apologies for forgetting him the first time around) 13. People who use the word "Tootles" 14. French Canadians 15. Last and most importantly, Owen Wilson  I hate Owen Wilson with a fiery passion. He's not funny. He's the same dumbass in every movie. God, I hate him.  Well, that's it. Until my undoubtedly inevitable return, fuck off.

      Since none of the new team members have grown the nuts to complain on this blog, I guess I have to step in. Although I have no complaints. I'm really just here to gloat and laugh.  Karl Malone has lost again. Muahahahahahahahaha!!!!!  All I really have to say is that it couldn't have happened to a bigger asshole. I sort of feel bad that Gary Payton couldn't have won, but if it weren't for his shitty play, Karl Malone might not have lost.  So, thanks Gary. You did just what I asked.  To sum up, all things have come to pass exactly as I predicted and Karl Malone is a chump.

      Up until now, I have neglected to bitch about anything that most people would consider "important".  I have never mentioned just how much I disliked our current presidential regime or how ineffective I've found it to be.  Well, thanks to  Fahrenheit 9/11 , I don't have to, for the most part.  Anyone with any doubts as to whom they will be/will not be voting for this November (or people who cannot think for themselves, i.e. Texans) should hit theatres immediately to be able to make an informed decision.  There are people out there (here) who are being led blindly with no idea of the hidden agenda of their often duplicitous commander-in-chief. On the other hand, a lot of so-called informed people also say that Michael Moore has an agenda of his own. Of course he does. Is it just his imagination that the world has deteriorated over the last four years? Who wants more of that?  Bush hangs his hat on the war in Iraq, the supposed "War On Terror". All the while, he is ignoring the main problems here at home: poverty (though, not in the Bush house), unemployment, and the completely bogus Patriot Act. Now, now, some of you might be saying that the Patriot Act is a good thing. It keeps the terrorists from attacking us. Ask yourself this one question, though. What evidence is there that the Patriot Act is doing anything other than inhibiting our freedoms, especially freedom of speech? Hell, I wouldn't be surprised if I got a "visit" in the near future for writing this. Whatever. This was the kind of talk that led to America being born over a bicentennial ago.  I hope that people thinking that everything is okay, just want to see the movie to see what the controversy is all about. I want those people to pay close attention to Flint, Michigan resident Lila Lipscomb (I'm going to refrain from making fun of this name, in order to not deflate my message). I'm not going to say why but I hope that viewers go through the same cerbral process this woman did during her struggle. And then see what a great job you think Bush is doing then.  Ignorance is bliss, people. The fact that so many think everything is hunky fucking dory is because they don't have a fucking clue as to the reality that surrounds them.  Also, I realize that this was more of a soapbox moment and there was no real anger or humor contained in this post.  Tough shit. Go see  Fahrenheit 9/11  and don't be a dumbass come November.  I, hereby, get off the soapbox and smash it into kindling.

      I have realized that, as many people that I have met over the last 25 years (dear God, it  has  been that long), that I have never met someone named Brian that wasn't an uber-tool.    What's that? I lack evidence. Is your name Brian and claim not to be a shitlick fagwoman? I haven't met you, so I guess I should reserve judgment before calling you a raging bitchtard. But if you need proof, click on the title of this article and check out this cock-kneading swallowhog. And since this is my forum to say whatever the hell I want...fuck you, Brian and fuck all other Brians everywhere in your silly billy goat asses.  In fact, I would like to start a petition right now to eradicate the name Brian from every language and replace it with this:    Fuck-Brian    No wait...    Fuck-brian. There's no point in capitalizing such an unimportant word.    So please feel free to tell this particular fuck-brian and all other fuck-brians you know exactly what you think of their sad, pathetic, shaft-longing homo-cracy.    I guess I feel a little bit better now.
