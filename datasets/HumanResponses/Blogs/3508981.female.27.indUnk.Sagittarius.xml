      Well well well...here we go again.  I had been feeling a little strange.  I was due for my period and yet nothing.  I just had this weird nagging feeling.  I'm sure Mike, my husband of five and a half years, thought I was absolutely crazy.  How could we be pregnant?  We had been so careful...always using contraceptive gel. Who knew that 94% effective would not slow down his little swimmers?  I decided to test.  Sure enough, two pink lines and we are pregnant.  It has been a whole 24 hours since the discovery of our fornication.  I cried at first...how could this have happened?  After careful consideration I have come to only one explanation, it was by the grace of God that we are in this boat again.   We have two other children Dakota, 3, and Sierra, 20 months, and they are really special kids.  Sure, I would love to sell them in a garage sale every now and then but most of time they are really great.  I hope this new pregnancy is a good thing for all of us.  I worry about Dakota, he is autistic and hard to deal with sometimes.  He can be very destructive when he's angry and he is hard to please at times.  I worry about Sierra, who is very independent and feisty...I worry about her being a middle child and falling into the stereotype.  I worry about Mike who is reconsidering his dream of medical school because we may never be able to afford with three college funds to start.  I'm worried about me, my health is not perfect.  I'm a diabetic and my sugars are higher right now.  And I worry about this new little life growing inside me.  I had two miscarriages prior to Dakota and so I sweat every ache and pain. With every cramp or twinge I run to the bathroom looking for any signs of blood.  I know this is normal, but so stressful.  I am going to try very hard to get my sugar under control, watch what I eat and exercise regularly.  I am also going to try, try, TRY...to be less moody and irritable than I was with my last two pregnancies.  I was such a bitch to my husband last time. I was accusing him of messing around with someone else because I was so unhappy with myself.  I am surprised he didn't file for divorce.   So these are my personal goals for the next nine months.  I am hoping this blog will help to decrease any tensions that may arise in the near future between my family and "the ogre".  Stay tuned...

      This is my last post to this site....I had to have a D&C yesterday because of what they called a blighted ovum.  I am devestated and angry.  I guess I wans't meant to have this miracle in my life after all...punishment for being such a terrible, awful person.  Who know's what the future will hold for me?  I just hope someone out there is looking out for me, just a little.  Perhaps someday...

      Well, it's been a while since my last entry.  I have had a lot happen regarding my pregnancy, at least from the emotional aspect of it.  I went for my ultrasound last week and all they saw was a gestational sac.  They said it might be too soon to see so they sent me home with two lab slips, one for that day and one to be repeated two days after.  So I left there feeling doomed.  I thought this pregnancy was over before it really even started.  My hcg level on Wednesday was over 3000 which I am told is really good.  Then on Friday it had only risen to over 4000.  Dr. Howitt said that it could be something or nothing.  I never had the bloodwork with my last pregnancy but the same thing happened.  I went in and they said it was too early to tell anything and sent me home.  So, my next ultrasound is for tomorrow.  She said we should be able to see the baby by then for sure.  I am hoping and praying everything is fine.  My biggest fear is that they will just see the empty sac again.  I pray with all my might that things are okay.  Mike, Nan and Michelle are the only ones who know the truth right now and how scared I am.  I just didn't want the whole world knowing that I could be having another miscarriage.  However all three of them seem optimistic that things will be ok.  I have all the pregnancy symptoms...fatigue, breast tenderness, backaches, headaches....yet by now with both Dakota and Sierra I was really sick.  I have not felt anything like that really.  Maybe an occasional bout of nausea, but definitely no vomiting.  That scares me to no end, however makes me hope that it stays that way should I continue on this emotional rollercoaster.  I just can't wait until tomorrow at this time.  I will at least no something, good or bad.  All I know is that this waiting and the uncertainty of not knowing is killing me.  Ugh!!! Ugh!!! Ugh!!!

      These hormones are the absolute worst!  I am so emotional over the silliest things.  I was taking Dakota to school today and we had to stop fpr a train.  I acted overexcited to get them to be interested in it.  We were the second car in line so we had a good view and as the train got closer and they saw it, their little faces lit up...smiling with their eyes wide and gasping, ooo and wow!  Well that did it for me.  I was sobbing right there in traffic.  I must have looked like a phyco.  I was just so happy that my kids were happy.  They are not both happy at the same time anymore lately and it takes alot to please them.  After the train passed I said to Dakota, "Wow, that was fun huh" and he said without missing a beat, "yeah it was".   I cried even harder because it hit me that he is now speaking in complete sentences.  Yesterday he asked his sister if she wanted to color and she said yes.  "Here ya go" he replied as he handed her a crayon.  And then this morning he was vacuuming for me and I said "Thank you Koda" and he said "Welcome".  He sure has come along way in a year.  I'm so very proud of him.  Sometimes I am not a very good mom to him for I lose my patience with him easily.  But I hope he realizes I don't mean to be so mean.  He is my bestest little dude and Sierra is my bestest woman.  I love you guys so much...it makes me cry.

      Pregnancy hormones are beginning to kick in.  I'm feeling kinda sad tonight.  I saw Dolly today and this weird feeling came over me.  I have always admired her, my husband would say I'm obsessed although I really am not.  I couldn't help but cry about it.  I can't explain this fascination I have with her.  I thought to myself how much I would love to meet her and how my chances of that are really very slim.  So i just got pretty down.  Weird huh?  My kids are so sweet.  They fell asleep tonight in my bed, both of them at the same time.  It was such a beautiful thing to see them snuggle up.  They really are best buddies.  I'm so glad they get along together and rely on one another as much as they do.  It makes my eyes tear up.  We have a stray cat outside that I see every few days.  I put out handfuls of food for him even though I know I shouldn't.  I just can't stand to see him be hungry.  I hope I can provide him a little happiness, however small it is.  He is pretty scared of me.  I talk to him from the window and he immediately runs away.  I hope he is doing ok out there.  I am just really down tonight.  Only symptoms I have of being pregnant are sore boobs, tiredness, cramps, and the attractive zits on my face.  You gotta love it.  I keep thinking this pregnancy isn't healthy as the last two because I am not feeling very sick at all.  This baby was an accident but I have grown to love it just as much as I do Dakota and Sierra.  I fear should anything happen to this  baby that Mike will not want to try again.  My heart aches for that day should it come.  I am trying to think positive...Nan was completely ok with her last pregnancy but sick with her first two...please let this all be normal.  I will find out Wednesday at my ultrasound appt. I guess.  I wish I could just shake the eerie feeling I have.  I suppose I am just tired and I should go to bed.  I would love to end this day as soon as possible. Boo Hoo Hoo...

      Have my first ultrasound on the 16th hope it goes well.  I have been thinking I have an ectopic pregnancy.  I have these weird pains on one side of my tummy and then a little while latter I have the same pains on the other side...haha.  So I am just going nuts thinking about all the things that could go wrong.  But I must be positive.  The girl next door had her baby this past week and I felt so excited for her...and all I could think about was holding my new little baby.  Soon enough, but I must be patient.

      Today I had my first feeling of nausea.  It lasted about three seconds and then it was gone.  Phew!  I was so sick with my first two kids I am hoping this one will be different.  Nan says when she was pregnant with Bernie, she was hardly sick at all. I have always tried to pattern my life after her so I guess I shouldn't deviate from the path now.  Haha!! Here's hoping.

      Mike says I'm nesting.  I cleaned the kitchen today, and I don't mean like usual.  I moved all the appliances and wiped down everything.  I got rid of some stuff and cleaned out cupboards.  It looks so nice and yet kind of empty.  I just figure I should do it all now rather then wait.  With my other two pregnancies, by my six week mark I was really sick.  Vomiting, headaches, bloated, all the uncomfortable signs of pregnancy.  So I am trying to get ahead of the game.  All that's left is my bedroom closet, hall closet and bathroom cupboard's.  Than I will be ready to fight the battle of morning sickness.  I think it is just effective and very intelligent planning or is Mike right...could I be nesting so soon?

      These are the names I thought were really nice when I was searching Babynames.com last night.  I am sure my mind will change a million times between now and February.  But here goes... Girls:                   Boys: Candace                  Parker Olivia                   Preston Noelle                   Noel Madison                  Hunter Kelsea                   Collin Kyah                     Collier Jadyn                    Cole Jolie                    Brandon Faith                    Cullen Felicity                 Logan Brooke Alexis Chloe Gracie  Mike and I agreed on most of these but I am waiting on a list from him.  Since this is our third and last child I want everything to be perfect...especially the name.  I want an unusual name like Dakota and Sierra, something that will sound nice with them.  This is the hardest choice to make...ugh.

      I keep having to remind myself that I am actually pregnant.  I really don't feel it yet.  I have the occasional cramps and today I had one of those nasty headaches, you know the kind that even Tylenol can't touch.  I feel pretty good tonight though.  Plus, I have been feeling so tired.  I slept all the way to Oswego and back today on our way to pick up the kids.  Poor Mike, he had no one to talk with, it is such a boring drive.  We spent the weekend cleaning out the basement.  I was so exhausted by the end.  But at least that is done now.  Plus I went through all my baby clothes.  I made piles to keep and piles to save for Tessa, (my sister-in-law who is due with her first baby in October) and a pile for Nan's garage sale.  I forgot about some of the outfits, they were so cute.  I really am hoping for a boy this time and Mike wants another girl...I wonder...hmmm.

      My Dr. finally called back today, four days after I took the blood test.  She said my sugars are really up there, 9.4, something I already knew.  She was so nice to me and didn't make me feel bad.  I really like her.  But I am on a mission.  I want to get them down as fast as I can.  My baby's life depends on it.  I am going to make some serious changes in diet and excersise.  I am going to limit my carbs to 180 a day, which was fine by my nutritionist a few years ago.  I am going to eat mainly veggies and some meats...not sure if I want to venture down the vegetarian road yet or not.  I have time to decide all that.  I am going to go to Curves everyday if it kills me.  I will get up extra early to do it.  I am also going to ask Dr. Howitt for the medicine right away for the morning sickness that way I have it if I need it.  I am going to try this mind over matter approach this time, may not work but I am sure going to try.  So I have a lot on my plate. I can do it.  I just have to remember it is for my babies...the one growing inside me now, the two who need their mom and my hubby, who couldn't handle the little monkies without me.  Ha!

      I'm almost ashamed to say it, but I keep forgetting I am pregnant.  I am so busy with our daily routine that I think to myself every so often, I'm having a new baby.  I keep daydreaming of what it will be like when he/she is born.  Will my kids really like having a new baby around the house? I really believe this child will complete our family.  I told some more people today, mostly Cody's teachers, and they were so excited for me.  They have become part of our family...it will be hard to say goodbye to them in September.  I hope they will come back to see the new baby and to see Cody and Sierra too.  We will surely miss them.  This weekend the kids are going to their grandmother's house and Mike and I will be alone.  We have a lot of cleaning to do, mostly the basement.  And I will spend a lot of that time going through all the old baby stuff.  I will enjoy it.

      It's official!  I am pregnant again.  After waiting two more hours this morning I broke down and called the office.  It took them another half an hour to call back.  As I was talking to the nurse I remembered how I hated going there last time.  The staff was all new from the first time I was there so no one really knew me and they treated me like I was a first timer.  Today the nurse was cold and acted as if she couldn't be bothered to call back with the test results.  Only when the receptionist called back to schedule my fist appt did I hear any congratulations.  Oh well.  I go for my first appt on June 18.  I will be almost 8 weeks.  I asked to come in as early as possible because of my prior history with the miscarriages.  I was glad they accommodated me.  I think I also have an ultrasound that day too but I can't remember exactly.  I will have to look it up through one of my old journals.  Anyway, I am slightly confused as to my due date, the first nurse told me Feb 6 and the receptionist told me Feb 4.  I guess I will know for sure when I go in.  I am so excited and can hardly believe that I go in a little over two weeks.  Mike has been absolutely wonderful.  He was so sweet last night when he came home from work.  He told me about two girls names he thought were nice, Annica (not sure of the exact spelling) and Brianna, both of which I do not care for.  But we have a lot of time to think about it.  Dakota was so cute this afternoon.  Earlier I had told him I have a baby in my tummy and he was hugging it and kissing it and telling it, "I love you baby".  So when I picked him up from school he ran over in front of everyone and hugged me and said "hug baby".  I was so embarrassed because I had not told anyone there.  I wanted to wait a while on that.  So I shrugged it off and pretended he hadn't said anything like that.  He really likes babies and so does Sierra.  I know they will both make an excellent big brother and sister.  I sort of want a girl this time...I think girls are so much easier than boys.  However, part of me would like to have another little boy around.  It has been so long since I had that.  Either way I will be happy with this blessed bundle of joy.

      I had my blood test this morning to confirm the pregnancy...and I waited and waited and waited. It is 10pm and still nothing!  I would like to have found out today.  But what can I do?  Usually my Dr. is really good about getting back to me.  Maybe she found some unusual results and I am dying of some horrible disease.  Maybe there was just not enough time in the day...who knows.  I just want to have this confirmed so I can get officially excited.  I am so tired tonight.  I guess I will go to bed now so that tomorrow will come sooner and possibly so will a phone call. UGH!!!
