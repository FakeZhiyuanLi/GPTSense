      If  urlLink Ralph Nader  had not run in 2000, Al Gore would be in the White House and we would not be at war in Iraq.   urlLink Billions of dollars  would have been saved which could have been used to improve the lives of poor and disadvantaged Americans, kept public schools open, etc., etc.   urlLink Breaking free  of our current two-party monopoly on politics would probably render great benefits, yes. Is the cost we're now paying, however, even remotely worth Nader's having run? Especially since alternate-party sentiment appears to be less than it was in 2000? Is voting to "make a statement" a responsible action when the outcome causes such suffering and waste?  Voting for the lesser of two evils is not a pleasant choice, but consider that the lesser of two evils is LESS EVIL. In this world, sometimes less evil is the best we can do.

      Binary. 0/1. On/off. Half empty/half full. Black/white. Yin/Yang.  Democrat/Republican. Liberal/conservative.  Election after election tallies very close to  urlLink 50/50 . Minus a small minority who vote outside the Dem/Rep lines (and minus the huge number who don't vote at all), the United States is repeatedly showing an even split between Democrats and Republicans. Which means a couple of things:  1) Regardless of who wins, HALF OF THE VOTERS AT ANY GIVEN TIME ARE  urlLink UNHAPPY  WITH ELECTION RESULTS and feel their viewpoints are not being represented.  2) When a candidate states that "the people of this country want X", that's not true. Do not believe that candidate.  urlLink HALF OF THE VOTERS  WANT X AND HALF OF THEM WANT Y.  Imagine taking the oath of office for the Presidency of the United States knowing that basically ONE HALF of those who cast votes voted against you. I would think that a President under those circumstances would want to find a way to, if not win over, at least give some credence to the viewpoints of that half of the citizenry.  Take my viewpoints, for example. Like many other American citizens, I feel that the war in Iraq is making the U.S. less secure by increasing hatred for our country in the Islamic world. Like many other American citizens, I feel that tax cuts help the wealthy buy more expensive  urlLink SUVs  while more of the poor end up on the streets. Like many other American citizens, I feel that the so-called "Patriot Act" is a gross violation of the freedoms that our predecessors fought and died for and is taking us in the direction of the Nazi  urlLink Gestapo  or the KGB.  Rather than acknowledging these opinions, the President just leans over the podium and, in the manner of one speaking to rather slow children, gives the equivalent of  urlLink "You're just wrong. Duh."  Well, I sure feel marginalized as a citizen. I'm sure lots of other folks do as well. About half of us, in fact.

      Might as well make a grand statement about the crux of it all:  FOR CERTAIN THINGS THAT REALLY MATTER, WHY DON'T OTHER PEOPLE THINK THE WAY I DO?  Right. So what got me thinking along these lines?  I'm an ex-fundamentalist Christian. I won't bore you with the details, but I was once a Christian and now I'm not. I do think a lot about Christians, however. It's a hobby.  [My wife and I were perusing the Bible shelves at  urlLink Powell's Books  the other day. Upon hearing me explain the difference between the 1909 "First Scofield" Bible and the 1917 Scofield Reference Bible another customer remarked that we obviously knew a lot and asked for some help. She appeared shocked when we commented, "It's a hobby."]  Anyway, I was a Christian from about age 8 to some forgotten point in my early 20's. I grew beyond that belief system, so I've been on both sides of the fence - I now can't see how a rational person could embrace a conservative Christian faith any more than I couldn't see then how a rational person could NOT embrace it.  [So what's the "it" I'm talking about here? It's not the spectrum of Christian denominations, many of which accept alternate beliefs. (Saying one is a Christian is almost as vague as saying one is a human.) I'm referring to the specific Christian belief structures which state that there is only one truth and that each of us will be tormented and punished for eternity if we do not accept God's Son Jesus Christ (who is Himself God) as our Lord and Saviour and turn our lives over to Him.  You may be familiar with this doctrine, but in case you aren't, let me repeat:  a) there is only  urlLink one truth , so all other religious views, including other Christian sects, are fatally incorrect and will result in  b)  urlLink eternal, never-ending torment  for those who do not turn their lives to Christ.  That's the core of the "it". There are other interesting points such as the acceptance of the Bible as God's complete and perfect revelation to man. I'll probably touch on those other points some time in the future.]  So, there's the problem. I don't hold these beliefs, but lots and lots of other people do. This isn't some "we all have different paths" dilemma. This is all of those other people saying, to quote the band Utopia, " urlLink Everybody else is wrong ." And will suffer on and on forever and ever. These "other people" aren't just guys in white shirts and crew cuts passing out tracts in Pioneer Square, either - they're hep youths with  urlLink aluminum-clad Bibles , grooving to the evangelism stylings of "Growing Pains" star  urlLink Kirk Cameron . And lots of other very mainstream-looking people.  Thinking about myself and about the multitudes of Christians out there, I'm just left with the following:  THERE MUST BE SOMETHING SERIOUSLY WRONG WITH ALL OF THEM, OR THERE'S SOMETHING SERIOUSLY WRONG WITH ME.  Or, maybe we're all just dreaming...

      We must be dreaming. How else to explain our often opposing and contradictory beliefs, optinions and actions? (Stay tuned...)
