      I am back- Miss me??  SO, I have been back over a week now and haven't done an entry! I wish I was still on vacation! It was so nice to be away for 16 days. Florida was beautiful! We decided not to go to Disney. We ran out of time. If we could plan our trip again we would have spent a whole lot more time in central Florida. We only had 3 days. Not long enough, especially when its 87 degrees. Anyway, we endured 3 days of driving to get home. It was great bonding time for me and my son. He is such a good rider for a 2 year old. I think I got more cranky then him! We had pillow fits, made a tent (to my husband's disbelief) and played, played, played. We also took naps. It was LONG! But we made it. My husband's grandma is so sick. It was difficult to see her like that. She is normally so feisty. My husband was able to tell her he loved her and she responded. That made it all worth while. We know we will see her in heaven and are grateful for that.  SO, now on to everyday life, I can tell you my vacation makes me want to be a stay at home mom. But can't for now, life will go on. At least I have some good friends to work with (most of the time &#61514 ;). My son has decided it was time to potty train. YES! POTTY TRAIN! If you read my other entries regarding the subject I am terrified!  On Wed. of our vacation we went to meet my husband's cousin's family from Ft Myers. We drove the hour back to where we were staying and he was dry. So I thought he would be very wet in the morning.  Wrong, dry and he went in the potty! Yeah! Anyway that day traveling we were at a restaurant and he declared he needed to go, so we went, and he did go! SO at every rest stop he went. Like 4 times that day, and 3 the next. We kept the diapers on just in case. Anyway, it's been a week, and we are starting all the way today. BYE DIAPERS (AS she screams "am I ready for this!?!?") He is very proud of himself being a big boy and all. We shall see, my mom is like "you put a diaper on him and your in for it." I don't know why I am so scared of this. I guess it makes it easier on me in the LONG run. But I fear pee going all over in a Walmart, or restaurant. You know the thoughts! Anyway, Deep Breath, I can do this, everything will be fine!  So here it is… my son LOVES PIZZA! We refuse to say the word at home, hide the tv screen during pizza commercials etc. Otherwise he yells "pizza mama pizza, I want…" If you ask him what he wants for dinner, even giving him two options that are not pizza he still says pizza. We went to a buffet restaurant the other night and before we even looked at the food, I said what do you want. He answered pizza. I guess that's when the madness began. At Walmart, walking down the pizza isle to get bread he began to chant "PIZZA, PIZZA, PIZZA" very loud. He was quite upset when I told him we would order it and not be getting it here. We then left to go get lunch, and I said do you want nuggets, he said "mama what about pizza?" I told him we would have it for dinner. I don't know why or what has caused this, we had pizza that night and he ate a whole piece, and I am talking big piece. HE is 2 and already sold out on pizza! I have always been a particular eater, but my son will only eat chicken nuggets, bologna, fries, cottage cheese, ice cream, fruit, and pizza. Nothing mixed up, no vegetables, hardly any meats, maybe some mac and cheese on occasion. I am thinking the poor kid is starving. This last weekend he hardly ate anything I fixed for meals, (lots of Bologna from the fridge), so on Sunday night we got him McDonalds nuggets and fries. HE ATE ALL 4 nuggets and ALL the fries! He is only 2 and I am not happy with his pickiness. Oh well, he will live I am sure, as long as I keep packs of bologna in the fridge.

      HOT: Good Morning! I am on vacation!! Yeah! We have spent the last week in Georgia with my husband's family. His grandparents even got to come spend the week with us. It was relaxing and fun. We had great weather. They live in the mountains which are so beautiful. We drove from Iowa the day after Christmas. It took us 18 hours! We did it all in one day!! My little 2 year old was so good. He wanted out the last couple hours though. He fell asleep and we kept on. I had a horrible tooth ache the whole ride. My poor husband had to do most of the driving cuz I was in pain. I think the antibiotic that I was on inflamed my gums. I stopped taking it and it stopped hurting. Whew!  We got to see my husband's sister's family. She just had a new baby boy. He was so little and cute. NO MOM, IT DIDN'T MAKE ME WANT ANOTHER ONE! All it took was some spit up all over me to kindly remind me babies are work. My husband's brother was there and they have two kids also. My son had a BLAST playing with them. My son got very attached to his grandparents and great grandparents. It was a good time of bonding for them.  Yesterday we drove 13 hours to Central Florida. My husband's other grandma is ill and we are about to go visit her. It is 75 degrees out already and only 12:00. The high should be 87 today! HOT! When we FINALLY got here last night my son said "I want Papa, and Mammie." We had to explain we would see them in a couple days.  We are staying with my husband's aunt. She has 2 horses, 9 goats, and a mama pig with 4 piggies. We went out this morning to play with them. My son was in shock. He lead a horse around the pasture. We tried to catch a piggie but they run FAST!  My husband finally gave up. They are only 2 weeks old and so cute.  We will be leaving here Thursday morning with hopefully stop at the Animal kingdom or Magic Kingdom before that. We are planning to drive up through Alabama with a stop at my husband's grandparents house. His  parents will be taking them home that day so we will see them one more night.  They were very excited that we would be able to see them yet again. It's hard to live so far away from family. It sure makes for a long drive. I am guessing it will take 30 hours to get home to Iowa. It sure has been fun, but I don't even want to get in that VAN! Hope it's warm where you're at. I know it's freezing in Iowa. We might go swimming in the ocean here! Yeah Florida. Did you know the ground is covered in black sand, and the trees have moss on them? I am learning all sorts of things here. Happy New Year!

      This weekend is going to be a blast! I have tons to do. My Birthday is Sunday and I am looking forward to celebrating at home. This week has gone by fast. How come it seems, I want to get so much more done then I take time to do? I wanted to bake cupcakes, yeah right! The weeknights always go by in a blur. I honestly can't wait for it to be light outside at 8:00. It always seems like I get more done in daylight.  The snow is melting-I can almost hear it scream. I know I am glad to see it go-sorry for those of you that actually LIKE it. (Crazy people!)  My son is growing up so fast! I went and got his 2 ½ pictures done and what a difference. He is actually talking now. Like sentences! Not just words! It is incredible, it surprises me how much he has changed. He is a good little boy. Potty training is coming along well. He is still struggling with poopie. The other morning we were getting ready for church and my husband decided to show my son how to sock fight. AT LEAST HE USED CLEAN SOCKS! My son at least likes to fight fair. I was getting ready for church and my husband and son were running around like crazy hitting each other with a sock. (or in some cases 2 socks). My son came up to me and said "here Mama" and as soon as I touched it he hit me. SO what am I to do but join in.  We had a great time. However 2 year olds don't know when to stop! SO we were late for church. OH well, the family moments were well worth it!

      Okay so you ask, did you fall off the planet, why haven't I done an entry? Don't know, really I love journaling! Just haven't had the time to put it on the computer. Well a lot has happened since my last entry. GO Figure!  My son is almost potty trained! YAHOO! He now has the #1 thing down to a science and has even done the #2 thing for several days in a row! This morning he was even dry, which totally surprised me since he had a lot of poop at 10pm last night. This is week 3 of the training and there is NO turning back now. I will tell you it has really gone pretty smoothly. He still has an accident a day, he gets playing and forgets to tell us in time. But I can deal with that. When we are out he does really well. We now know where all restaurants have bathrooms. But better that then the latter.  SNOW is everywhere here. There has to be at least 20 + inches out there. We continue to get hit weekly. I honestly can't see the road across the street because they have plowed it up SOO high from the parking lots. This morning actually felt warmer to me, maybe we got to double digits!  My husband just got hired at a really great company. We are thrilled. He has worked for them as a temporary employee for the last 3 months. They called him in last week and said we want to hire you. SO that means he is now the warehouse manager, has better pay and full benefits. YAHOO! Only thing is, he only gets one week of vacation each year for the next 2 years. SO sorry family members down south, it's gonna be a while before we see you again. Good thing we had a long vacation recently.  Well I will do better at journaling. My son continues to do CUTE stuff and you all are missing out on the information. He still loves Pizza. Had to go last night, he ate 2 big pieces, which were cut into 4 pieces, plus a whole lot of cottage cheese. Crazy kid!

      Wednesday already! WOHOO! I planned to do an entry on Monday but got hit with the stomach virus. Didn’t do much but sleep and you know what! I went to work for a couple hours but had to give in and go home to bed. My son was so cute; he wanted to play with me really bad. I told him “Mama’s tummy hurts, I am sick” he said “me too mama, I sick” and grabbed his tummy. It was cute; however it didn’t stop him from jumping on my bed!  Yesterday went by quickly. My stomach was sore, but not sick like the day before. Oh course now my sinuses are acting up. But I would much rather deal with that then the other! I went to bed pretty early. I woke up at like 3am to my son crying for a drink. My husband was last to bed, with my son, and neglected to put a cup in the fridge. (BUMMER) So I stumble around the house in search of the cup to wash and refill. Half asleep, when all of a sudden I notice one of our cats is in the house! (We have two OUTDOOR cats) I am like wake up husband, why is Cali (are cat) in the house?? It freaked me out, the movement, and oh it’s the cat. He said something about seeing a mouse and that he let both cats in. OH great, a mouse, all winter we have been mice free. (We rent a house, that has lots of places those things can get in, so we have to be very careful and alert). Now it’s SPRING and there is a mouse. ANYWAY I have a HUGE phobia for mice!  I didn’t get to talk to my husband before he left for work about details, like where did you see it, where did it go… you know important stuff! So this morning I am all jumpy. Anything moves or touches me and I’d jump. Of course, I am watching everywhere, every step, in case the cats got him and he’s lying dead somewhere. My son wakes up and runs like a crazy man through the house, I am thinking GREAT, now the mouse is going to run too! Don’t want to go home, I did find out the little mouse was by the computer, so SORRY won’t be doing entries at home until the critter is caught! GO CATS! I’ll let you know when the trouble ends. One thing is for sure, the cats know he is there, but do they care? I had a crazy dream that the cat’s made friends with the mouse just so they could stay inside the house. (They used to be indoor cats, until my son was born) I know it crazy, but I just want the thing OUT OF MY HOUSE! Anybody got any ideas?

      Man, can't believe I have not been online since Thursday! I missed you all! Friday was incredibly busy. I took my little sister "R" shopping with my son for all that fun Easter Egg hunt stuff. We hit 5 stores in 4 hours. We were truly worn out at the end of the day but we did have a lot of fun! I have to make 4 baskets for the drawings so that always proves challenging. The ages range from 6 months to 6th grade, of course each basket is by different ages. Problem is when you shop you have got to keep straight how many items you have for each one. ANYWAY, the kids loved them, we showed them today.  Friday night we got my husband a new computer game so I have been letting him play some. We also had a young adults get together which turned out to be rather fun. Saturday we clean house (JOY) and filled 300 Easter eggs. My son and I watched a couple movies while my husband played. We saw that new Bugs Bunny one (stupid if you ask me) and School of Rock (EVEN DUMBER). But it worked for background music and the occasional laugh.  Today was busy with church. We went out with a bunch of friends to Ryan’s. (My son did not have any more stomach attacks--Thank you GOD!) I made it to my 4:30 appt on time and after evening church my son and I headed to McD's for some play time! It was fun, I never realized how competitive he is though. He wanted me to play air hockey, but every time I scored he got mad. Finally he wouldn't let me have either puck, and I was left defenseless. Needless to say, he won! Good quality time, I LOVE IT! Early my husband and son played ball outside. It was beautiful today. I feel like even though we were busy, that we did get a lot of time this weekend with him. Tomorrow night we start infant swim class, can't WAIT!  This is my son's 3rd session. He loves it and it makes us have one night each week that we concentrate on him and not all the other things in our lives.

      Warning the following entry may be too much for some:  Tonight we decided to go back to Best Buy. Had to get my husband a computer game. Of course that just means we are going to have to share better. Well anyway by the time I picked up are son and got home to get my husband it was getting late. My mom informed me the our son had several loose #2 today and that it was NO FUN cleaning him up, since he still can't figure out how to sit on the toilet. (HE LIKES TO STAND). Anyway we go out to eat at a buffet, so we all can get something we want and it's fast. My son keep saying he had to go potty, so my husband and I took turns. I went first, then 10 min later he said "I go pee pee BAD" so my husband took him. Well about 10 min's after that he again said he had to go. (You'd think we'd get a clue he had to #2) Anyway my turn again. In the bathroom we go, he is standing there and he pees (again), I said are you sure it's not poopie, right then grab and throw on the toliet. He has it BAD. Luck I got him up there with minor amount of spillage (sorry). So he's going, all of a sudden he wants to see it, flush, back up on the toliet again. Then he starts getting the giggles. Every time his little body makes the sounds (you know gas) he starts to laugh, and laugh. I am trying to be serious, yeah right, next thing I know I am laughing at him. Then someone else comes in. I am like GREAT! I hear a mom and her little girl. They hear my son doing his number and laughing each time. Soon the little girl start to giggle, and then the mom too. By this time I have LOST Control and the other mom calls out. STOP laughing or else will NEVER STOP.  Her daughter was laughing and couldn't go. Anyway got it all under control. My son jumped off all excited! He did it, and made it mostly in the potty! The other mom told my son "GREAT JOB!" at least she understood. He was all proud, we go back into the restaurant and he is proclaiming he poopied. I was like "lets go!" I had to change him and quickly get out of there. I did not know it was possible for that much #2 to come out of such a little body, it still makes me laugh. I guess tonight we made a memory. Not a typical memory but one none the less. My son did a good job and we had a great laugh. Okay, don't think I am strange. Just know that it was truly funny and laugh!

      One more day of work and it's the weekend for me! I have fridays off and I love it! Lots to do this weekend. I am in charge of a huge neighborhood egg hunt. Got to do some major shopping for that. It will be fun and hey, it's not my money!  Well, honestly I try to spend at little as possible for the best stuff. Can't believe I only have a week and a half left before the hunt. Tonight we have my 2 little sisters with us. "H" is in 2nd grade and "R" is in Kinder. We are taking them to McDonalds and then to church. My mom cleans new houses part time in the evenings so we get the girls. It should be fun, my son LOVES them, he calls out there name all the time. Crazy, he wants to go to there house. Which he is there 4 days a week. Of course they are in school too. Spring break this week so he is very excited to play with them all day. By the way my son did end up sleeping all night WAHOO! Of course it was in our bed, bummer, but oh well at least we got some shut eye.

      When I got home at about 7 from a class I was suppose to have my son was up. He is SO ready to play. It is now about 9:45 and he is not the least bit interested into sleep. Maybe I will get some rest tonight, my hubby and I might have to take shifts! By the way no one was at my new ESL information meeting. I was planning to volunteer to help those in need to learn english, also hoping to improve my spanish. Very disappointed, I killed almost 2 hours after work on that side of town for the class and NO ONE was there. Kinda frustrating, I was REALLY pumped up about it too. Bummer, the leader will be hearing from me in the morning that's for sure!

      Well last night was WONDERFUL! We had such a great time. We went to a great resturant and then to see Hildago.  Great Movie too! Over dinner I shared with my husband my entry yesterday. We talked about the past 7 years and memories. It was neat to see what years stuck out in both of our minds. Then we talked about goals for the next 7 years. Where we might be and what we might be doing. It was a lot of fun and I am thankful we were able to celebrate.  Our son was out cold when we went to my mom's to pick him up. She said he didn't have a nap and that at about 7pm he just knocked out. He slept until 6AM. Nice, just talked to my hubby and he said my son is already asleep again. IT'S ONLY 5:10 PM. No nap again today. It has been very nice outside, and he has been playing very hard.  Maybe he will sleep till morning. More likely it will be 3 AM and I'll have to convince him it's still time to sleep!

      Today is the day 7 years ago I walked down the aisle to become MRS. ____. Boy, it just seems like yesterday. I had just turned 20 years old, was dreamy in love to a tall dark handsome 23 almost 24 year old man. The first year, as most newlyweds, we were so mushy in love. You know where you think you have to touch all the time. The second year we started lighting up a bit. We had a great couple to hang out with and did a lot of traveling with them. Then we all decided it was time to think about kids. We went of the pill and soon after THEY announced they were pregnant and we were not. They had there little girl while we waited. It was hard yet exciting for are good friends. They entered a new stage in life we just made ourselves busier with ministry. They moved away, still another year passes. My husband worked a lot of temp jobs, which can be very frustrating. Finally after 2 years of trying to get pregnant I went to the doctor for an UTI. Well, I did have a UTI but she also announced I was expecting. I HAD KNOW CLUE! My poor husband was waiting in the lobby. The doctor told me several times that I was indeed expecting. I still cycled for 3 months during pregnancy! I went out and told my husband I had this UTI and oh yeah...she said I am pregnant! He was like "are you serious?" I started of course to cry (hormones already going). He was so excited, he ran around the parking lot yelling. Finally we were going to have a baby. New stage of life, baby shopping, doctors visits, more visits, more visits, I got gestional diabetes, classes, classes, visits and finally it was the day. I was induced and had my little baby BOY 6 hours later. Now life is totally different. The first 5 years of are married life was way easier then with a child. But our son adds so much to our lives too. It's a good exchange. Our son is now 2 and a half years old. He loves playing with balls, and music. He plays the drums (just like dad) and the guitar anytime there is music on. Tonight we are going out to celebrate. Dinner and a movie alone! Never thought we would have to struggle for alone time, but you do. We are doing well; we might drive each other insane some days but we always manage to make it through. We have a son to raise together and NOTHING will take us apart from each other or from raising him together. I can put up with irritations; it's just part of who I am. We can deal with financial hardships and times where my husband might not have a job. Good and the Bad that's the way life is... but we have each other and someone much bigger then us to see us through.

      Crazy busy day! Had a lunch meeting after church, with some people I work with. It was fun but SOO exhausting! We ended up taking too much time and I was late for another meeting I had with a couple kids. They went home before I got there. Now I feel bad, had to cancel last week on them because of meeting, two weeks in a row. Oh well, such is life! Now it's time to go back to church, nursery duty tonight YAHOO, maybe I can sit an relax. Sometimes it's only my little boy, other times I am not that fortunate.  My son is doing better potty training today. It seems like we have been at this thing FOREVER. He does good for several days and then yesterday he had like 4 accidents! What's bad is that he knows he did wrong and he LAUGHS about it. He will come running in and say "I PEE" Great one more mess to clean up. Oh well at least to day has been accident free! YAHOO! Gotta Go for now!

      Did I tell you what my son did the other night? Probally not, noticed time has gone by. Work has been busy. Well the other night we were all 3 in my bed.(Seems to be happening a lot lately) My husband was totally out and very tired. He started to snore-- I mean really LOUD snore. I looked over at my son who is laying there looking at the ceiling. The next thing I know my son looks at me and started to make these funny snoring sounds. I looked at him and started laughing, I was like daddy's loud huh? He was like unhuh, and started making up more imitations of his daddy's snores. It was so funny, next thing I know he's got me going to. We laughed our heads off as we copied my poor husband who was in dreamland. Finally, I pushed my poor husband enough to wake him up, so we could all go to sleep. SO FUNNY! What a 2 year old will do when you least expect it

      Hey bloggers- I did it, talked my husband into buying me a computer for my anniversary! The computer we have at home was SOO sorry! Actually this latest one didn't even have a modem to connect online! I had to do everything at work, which wasn't good. SO I asked him for a computer! But of course we have to share. Right now he is sitting next to me and bothering me cuz he wants to play a new computer game. I set up our Great new system and am loving it! Gotta figure everything out of course. It will be worth it!  Now I can actually start viewing more web sites. We even got a very nice printer, I am way to excited about my new toys! I am horrible though. My poor hubby had already ordered me some way to expensive flowers, I asked him to stop the order so we could use that money to go out Monday. He was so sweet and told me about them, and stopped the order. We are going to go out for dinner and a movie instead. Much more fun then flowers! But that's just me. Looking forward to spending more time online

      This morning when my 2 year old son woke up he rolled over, smiled at me and let it rip. It like GREAT he’s only 2 and they sound like there coming from a man! What will I do when he reaches his teen years! But let me confess, it’s partly my fault. SO here comes the confession… My husband hates “wind breaking, tooting, farting, gas” or whatever you call it. I will not lie, and you shouldn’t either…we all do it. Well, sometimes I do it more then others. My motto is if you are in public you find a safe polite place, BUT if you are at home with your family you just do what you got to do. My husband can not STAND it. It makes me laugh at his reaction, and after 7 years he has adjusted somewhat. While I was pregnant it was the worst. I told my husband I was praying for a very gassy child, and then we could both go sit on his lap and fart. He was like NOOO! Well the Lord heard my ornery prayer and now it is coming back to haunt me. I HAD A BOY! What was I thinking when I said that. He listens to his dad, and he doesn’t always side on my side when we horseplay.  Such as last Saturday, (Saturday’s are the worst…we play to hard) my husband owed me several paybacks for things that I had done to him. Namely…um throwing ICE COLD WATER (Ice cubes included) over the shower curtain… etc. Well I had done that (several times- different days of course) and not got paid back until last Saturday. I had locked the door… I am not stupid. BUT my husband was pounding on the door saying he needed to use the bathroom (we only have one) so I finally say FINE and open up. Watching the hands the whole time… the minute I put down my guard- SPLASH, and as I am yelling he comes with another cup- SPLASH! Now I am like Revenge is MINE… but here is out son helping his DAD. GREAT I guess I need another child, so it will be even. (NOT YET!)  What’s funny is that he has never got me back before. He said I told too many people about him screaming like a girl and it got me. So I gotta come up with something new for the revenge…anybody got any ideas?

      Here is little information about myself. I have been married 7 years on Monday. I have a 2 ½ year old little boy and LOVE being a mom.  Last night I was coming home from work. My hubby called and asked if I could swing by and pick him up. He works downtown, and parking is horrible, his work gives out bus passes so he normal rides to work. Anyway, I almost forgot, I jumped on the interstate at the last minute and fought through traffic to get to him. I pulled up and he is all in a good mood. He says he is getting excited about our anniversary. I am like okay, he’s like what are we going to do?  We had already discussed this several times! MEN! So I patiently go over the scenario again.  We head to my mothers to pick up our son. When we arrive we find our son covered in snow and his hands are bright red. He has been playing in the snow, building a fort. I have 4 young siblings, ages 9-4, and they have been teaching him snow games.  I want to go home, and not sit around and chat. We have to get the car seat and I had asked my husband to get it on are way in. We get ready to walk out the door, and my husband jumps up from the couch where he has been sitting and is like I have to get the seat. This continues my irritation with him. He had been sitting there while I got our son all ready to go. I thought it was already done. SO I showed him some of my frustration with words. Now he is started to get irritated.  Then he drives. It’s not a good idea for him to drive when I am already irritated, especially my van. He is always picking on me about hitting corners. Guess what he hit a corner!! I couldn’t resist, comments were made… of course he claims it was snow he hit, not curb. WHATEVER! You don’t lift like we did with snow!  Then we decided we needed to get garbage bags. My husband mention a couple other things we needed to get, but it was beginning to snowing again so I was like it can wait. We ended up stopping at a Family Dollar which is very close to our house. My husband pulled into to parking place and hit the curb with the tires. Remember I’m irritated,  NOT a good move! So I get out to get the garbage bags, and to check out the front of my van, giving him the evil eye the whole time. UNTIL, WHAM it happens, I fell straight down on my butt. It was like my guardian angel saying “Stop being SOO Mean!”  I was of course embarrassed, my husband is looking at me trying not to laugh. I am mad, hurt, and humbled. I stood up slowly, I could feel that a trip to the chiropractor would be necessary. I crawled back to the van, opened the door and told him he could go get them, I wanted to go home! (This was a bad idea) My poor husband wonders into the store with NO IDEA where the stupid bags are, I can see him in the window, back and forth, back and forth. Finally he comes out, he is now upset, and I am just plain GRUMPY! He tells me that I am irritating him, finally we are on the same page. I tell him “fine I won’t say anything” (yeah right, look at this entry, I am a talker).  As we pull into the drive I noticed where I had shoveled earlier in the day had melted to the rocks. My husband guns the van up the drive, which probably wasn’t necessary, so I made a little comment about the rocks flying, and opps, he went from irritated to plan mad. Needless to say, last night was not a good night, he always apologizes to fast. You know when your still to mad, and you KNOW it was mostly your fault anyway!  My husband hardly EVER gets mad. He is a very calm natured person, and very slow (he’s from the south) which is what sometimes gets to me. I am a on the go, lets do it now, type person.  I sometimes feel bad for the poor man. He puts up with me! But I guess that’s what part of Love is…putting up with each other even on the grumpy days!

      Well, I am finally doing it... writing a post. I have been checking out several sites for several months now and have been a silent observer. I am taking the plunge!  I think this is a cool way to express feelings and life happenings. I am a very busy person so I will do my best to keep my entries current.  SNOW, that's what I see outside my window. Lots, and lots of SNOW. I thought it was almost spring. I really want it to be spring. I like it to be light out when I come home from work. I am able to accomplish SOO much more. When it is dark it feels like I have to go home to do the basics and go to bed. Spring will come someday, after 16 inches of snowfall go away.

      WARNING WHAT I AM ABOUT TO SHARE MAY BE HARMFUL TO YOUR HEALTH! EXPERIENCED WOMEN WILL UNDERSTAND!  Okay so I wake up Wednesday am with my son throwing up in MY bed. You know the feeling, when you are sleeping and you think "I think he is throwing up?" so you sit up still sleeping, grab the garbage pail and stuff it under his mouth. STILL IN THE DARK, can't tell where the mouth is but somehow you get it. SO HUSBAND WAKE UP! Finally after saying his name 3 times my husband comes to and hits the lights! It could have been worse... let's just say I am sure glad there was no left  overs in the fridge for lunch the next day!  SO I then realized that it's on me, and all over my little boy. So I take him to the Bathroom. Let me just say, this is the first time my son has been old enough to realize what was happening, and he didn't like it. (FLU SHOTS WORK GREAT) I then try to convince my son to do what is necessary in the toilet... yeah right! He tries to swallow (SORRY), which totally grosses me out. I am like yucky, spit it out. ANYWAYS 3 rounds, while my husband, bless his heart, cleaned up the bed. I stayed home from work the next day. Gave my son a bucket to do his duty in. Mistake #2, he doesn't want to go in the bucket either! (AHH!) He ate just 2 bites of dry toast and some water, needless to say it ended up on the living room floor. Where was the bucket you ask? In my son's hand "my bucket" was all he said... no yucky allowed in it I guess.  I had been on the phone to my Mom, needing a little encouraging. SO while I am running him to the bathroom, (I had drop the phone in the process!) I went and told her "can't talk bye" Ran back to the bathroom and GREAT... the diarrhea! Remember last journal? Standing at the potty... doing his duty all over the floor. By then I am like.... DEEP BREATH I can do this. One mess at a time! I did survive, and was thankful when someone told me... at least you only had one child to deal with. THANK YOU GOD!  I commend all of you parents with more then one child, and pray you don't have a day like mine.

      Okay so it's been awhile again since I have updated. Maybe it's cuz I am too busy or nothing exciting has been happening to journal about. I am horrible I admit. Love to journal, hate too. It's a win/lose case.  Okay pass the complaining. I had a good Birthday we had a blast at HuHot grill. It was definitely an experience. This past weekend was good. I would say we did a lot of fellowshiping. We had 2 couples over for games and pizza Friday. I have realized that sometimes I want to invite a bunch of new people to do things. (I am VERY SOCIAL) Anyway, we have the regular group of friends, the one's we  have been doing stuff with for years. Then we all grow up and some of them don't. I find that we are the only one in the group with a small child (minus one single mom with twin 5 year olds). Anyway, all of a sudden, I want to hang out with new people. I love my group of friends, don't get me wrong. I just want to hang out with some other people sometimes. I think my group is thinking I am snobby or something. The last two weekends we have been invited to play games and we have not gone. We had already made plans with other people. I felt kinda bad, but then found out they were up until 3 in the AM. Parents can't do that! Plus we all used to go out to lunch every Sunday. Well, it is easier with a two year old (who needs a nap) to go home and eat. SO we didn't go to lunch yesterday with them either. After the PM service we went with some young parents to McDonalds and had the most fun.  I don't know, I guess it's all part of life and that we will have to balance it somehow. I like to plan ahead; they do things with a call that day. I feel OLD!  My son is still struggling with poopie. My mom called the other day and was like "um Brandie your son pooped all over the floor… 7 piles(thanks for the details mom) and I walked in and he was picking it up and putting it in the toilet." I said at least he was trying to clean it up. She said "when I got after him he started to cry and put his HANDS in his mouth!" Great is all I kept thinking… he likes to stand and pee, he doesn't want to sit on the toilet, he wants to stand and poop too! PRAY for my sanity, at least he doesn't poop everyday, so I have some breaks! Poopie STINKS!

      Okay- I have been told to update! I have been SOO busy. I worked on the computer all Friday and wanted to do an entry... but good thing I didn't cuz I barely had time to do all that needed to be done. We had our Spring Bash. This is a big event I plan for kids 1st thru 6th grade. It's an overnighter, and a lot of work. But I can honestly say everything went off without a hitch. There were 79 of us in attendance, and we had a blast. We first went to a middle school gym for games, then to the church for pizza, and finally to the skating rink for a private party. I got all of them asleep about 3 am. Did I sleep?? Yeah right, everything kept going through my head, I couldn't sleep for anything. Plus the hard floor didn't help much either! So the rest of the weekend I spent trying to catch up and get ready for my trip.  I leave in the morning for Springfield, MO. I haven't been there for several years and am planning to have a great time. I am attending a children's conference. (yes, it seems my life is filled with conferences lately) I will be gone until Saturday and unable to be online during that time- unless the hotel has connections. I plan to soak up all the information and to relax- hey, this is pretty much an all expense paid vacation. I will miss my husband and son though. I have never been that far away for this long a time. I have been preparing them both for my trip. Not sure my 2 year old gets it yet, but he will. Tonight I have to finish packing and go to infant swim. We want to have at least an hour of family time before I leave. My husband is unable to attend, due to his job being fairly new. This weekend we didn't have much family time, so I plan on enjoying there company tonight. I will try to write if I can. Hope all is well in your neighborhood.

      It is a beautiful Saturday! Yesterday it hit 87 and I live in the MIDWEST! I had to turn the air on in my car. Here I am thinking....what am I going to do today. My husband is still gone until later tonight. It's just me and my son. I went and bought a new television this morning. However, it's to big for me to carry in the house, so now I feel like the van is not usable. I am tempted to go get the car at the church. My husband birthday is tomorrow and I got him the TV. It's a 33 inch. We have been using a 19 inch the last 7 years, so this is going to be a big change! Now I am going to shop for a entertainment center, uh- I forgot to measure the hole in ours and it's not big enough! (BUMMER!) Oh well maybe I can find one for a decent price!  My son is into saying good bye to everything. Like when he flushes his pee or poppy he yells BYE PEE/POPPY! My father just made him a rocking horse and now he has to give it a kiss and tell it by before we leave the house. He also is finally realizing that when I say OW I mean it really hurt. Like an elbow is the eye is not funny. Yesterday we were rough housing and opps he hit me hard. My son was like "you okay mama?" and then he started to kiss my head where he hit me. It was so cute! Then he hurt himself and had to kiss it too. I don't think I taught him that, must have been my mom. I am just thankful he is realizing that I don't like it when he hits me (even on accident) in the face. I guess it just shows me my little boy is growing up!

      WAHOO! The mouse is dead! (feels funny celebrating death- but YAHOO!) Tuesday night my husband wakes me up to say Cali (our cat) has the mouse. It's like almost 1 in the morning. I was like Great- roll over to sleep. NOO- he had to give me every detail. He says- do you think I better shut the bedroom door- she's playing with it- OF COURSE! Then I hear him talking to the cat, encouraging her not to lose it. I was honestly thinking- can't wait to get online worry free again! She finally put it out of it's misery. I AM SO EXCITED!  I went to work and guess what, the dsl was down! I was SOO bummed out. It still was out today, but should be up soon. I kept saying I want to go home and get online. So here I am FINALLY! We had a busy couple days at work, getting ready for a big conference. I am glad I don't work tomorrow. Me and my friend are going on a girls night out. Can't wait- my husband will be at the conference. We are thinking about seeing 50 First Dates...anybody see it? Wondering how nasty Adam Sandler is going to be in this one. We are wanting to see a funny stress free film. Any suggestions?

      Okay, it’s been way to long since I have done an entry. I must confess, Saturday evening I was starting an entry and my pesky mouse made an appearance. I asked my husband just to turn the computer off, that I wasn't going back over there! Of course the cats came in and went straight over there. We are hopeful the pitiful thing will lose its life soon, or just leave my house. I have a major problem with those types of things, and am not trying to be offensive in anyway!  This entry may get lengthy because it's been awhile. I went to the chiropractor on Friday. I had never been before, but knew I needed to go. He found several problems, and boy did I feel better afterwards. My hip is already back out, and I honestly have to say I am sorer since it popped out of place. I go back tonight and am hopeful I will be less sore this time. Swim class is also tonight, so maybe the warm water pool will do my body some good.  We had a great Easter. Saturday we went to my mom's house and had a hunt. My son got really into it this year. He picked up to many, and we had to put some back out in the yard for the other kids. He was running and grabbing like crazy. My mom had hid a basket and my son was so cute. I helped him see it, and he whispered "it's mine?" I said yep and he ran over and grabbed it out of the bucket it was in. He was ALL excited running around with it.  He didn't want to wake up on Easter Sunday. We kept telling him that their are eggs everywhere, he didn't care. Finally he agreed to go cuddle with me on the couch while dada got them. (We had church to hurry for) When we went into the living room, he started to wake up real fast. We had fun watching him pick up the eggs. He wanted to open every one of them and touch to thing inside, and then close it back in there. We got him cars, and little dogs...not a lot of candy. The other hunts provided enough. We then went to my Grandma's house for lunch and yet another hunt. (BOY am I glad Easter is over!) He got several outfits and several eggs. We had a good time and my son jumped on the trampoline for hours. We were all very tired when we left there at 6pm. We went home and took a nap. Usually we don't take naps that late in the day, but we were tired. My son did not get back up, I tried to wake him up at 8pm but he just kept falling back to sleep. He slept until 7:30 this morning. My husband and I watched "Good Boy" which if we new our son was going to be sleeping; we would have rented something else. It was a cute family movie, silly but fun. I know my son will enjoy it.

      Is it Tuesday already?? Can hardly believe the days are going by so fast! I love it that it's light out at 8:00!  Well I survived the weekend. Sunday the kids in church drove me crazy with those branches! I wanted to tell them to throw them away- but didn't think the lady that bought them would like that to much! They got them before my class- so that means they were using them as swords for fights, smacking each other with them- and ALL SORTS OF other annoying stuff! SO being the GREAT teacher that I am- when they came in for my class, I made them all put them along the back wall- and NOT TOUCH THEM! I did use some of them to adlib part of the lesson- but NO BOYS GOT TO HOLD THEM UNTIL THE END! Phew! Sunday was crazy, I had to be back at church at 3 which only gave me 2 1/2 hours at home. I then skipped evening service (SHH!) to go to dinner with my sister and family for her birthday. She is 22 now- crazy! My dad and other sister were there. It was fun- kinda, we went to a chinese buffet that was CROWDED! My husband missed the dinner- he had to play drums at service. But my son and I went. One thing that is weird is my dad's new girlfriend has 3 boys! My dad didn't want anymore kids, (he has us 3 girls- the youngest 21), and that is one of the excuses my mother uses for leaving him. I like this women though- just strange seeing my dad with 3 young boys- I think they are like between 7-12 years old. I don't even know all there names. They have been dating since before Thanksgiving and I have met them 2 times! Hoping to get to know them better this Sunday at my grandma's for Easter. (Hmm... wonder if I should buy them something??)  Last night we had infant swim- last week it got canceled. My son had a blast, and my sister has my niece in the class too. My niece is 3 1/2 and was SOO funny- she didn't want to get her hair wet. When the teacher dunked her in the water- she screamed and cried "my hair!" My son had fun- still trying to get him to kick his legs and move his hands at the same time- but that would mean he would have to let go from me or dad. He did go under water several times, and jumped in to the pool- to us. Not bad for first class again- since January.  My son is trying all sorts of new things out- like he doesn't want to come home at night from my mom's. So he throws a bloody fit. The other night he got mad at my husband and began to count "1, 2, " (we count to three) I was like great! Tonight my mom stopped by- bad move. My son had a fit leaving there and here she comes knocking at my door. Of course my son wants to go- my mom's young kids are in the car! So my son went with her- I ran to Target and bought some Easter stuff (FUN!) I went over there at 8:30 to get him and he was all in pj's ready to stay the night. It's a school nite, my mom is like, he's attached (I am thinking- HE"S MY KID). Once in a while is fine- but I don't want him to get in a habit of staying over night every night. (My niece does that to my grandma- it's annoying!) Anyway- he wouldn't give me a kiss or hug- he wanted the kids. Finally at 9:30 he decided he wanted to go home. I was glad- I only get him for like 4 hours in the evening on M-Thurs. and I like to spend time with him. Do you think I am being to harsh? He was over last Friday nite- didn't stay the night, but the weekend before he did, and after this weekend he gets too, we have a conference to attend. I think moderation is good, just afraid I might be overreacting, a little. Oh, well time for bed.

      Tonight I am tired. I had a fun filled day. Started out with the hunt. It was cloudy and windy cold! (thanks a lot weather guy!) We got to the park at 8 am and boy was it cold! we bundled all up. People had gloves on to put out the eggs. I thought- something is wrong with this picture! The sun came out, but the wind didn't stop by 10 am when the kids came. Over all it was a Blast! Their wasn't as many kids as last year (and it rained then) but all the kids left with bags full of candy. My helpers were terrific! We started at 10 and were packed up and ready to go by 10:40. I didn't do any of the work- except oversee everything, and blow the whistle. It was wonderful- go volunteers! I'd say the Hunt is the easiest activity I have ever done.  My grandma took my son home after the hunt. We unloaded at the church, and went home for a nap. Which didn't last to long- but gave me a boast. We took a little boy out to a Fun Center (video games etc). He won a contest we had a few weeks ago- and this was his prize- his choice. SO 2 1/2 hours of chasing my son (grandma dropped him off) and playing games. That in itself is a need for a nap. Anyway, it was fun and the boy had a blast. He kept saying this was one of the funnest days. Egg hunt, and video games. He felt pretty special which is good, he needs that, his family recently filed for divorce.  I have been working on my lesson all night. I have to add something in for Palm Sunday. They got Palms branches to give to the kids, which I just found out about, and have to figure out something to do with! Top is all off we SPRING Ahead tonight! AHH- one less hour of sleep to add to my tiredness.  My husband keeps yelling for me to come watch the new Funniest Home Video Show- it has my son entertained too so it must be good. I keep hearing them laugh, so I guess I will finish up what I must and go have some family time. Night all!

      It's Friday nite and I just got home from a big event my husband has been working on. It is called the 3 band night. My husband and some others have been planning this since Jan. They got the bands, the sponsors, and a lot of food donated. It is an outreach to teenagers- 3 bands and food for FREE! SO tonight is the big night! He is so PUMPED UP! They really are having a terrific turnout, at least 200 kids. That was the goal. When I left they were jumping around yelling, so I'd say it's a hit. My son loves music and was very popular with the youth. He had his guitar and was jammin down the aisle. All the kids were watching. Then my son thought he was big stuff, started walking around giving teenage boys HI FIVES. I was following close behind, he pushed me away! I guess I was cramping his style! GOOD GRIEF! The guy in charge even said his name up front, and told the kids to check him out! They did and my son came home zonked out. This thing won't get done till 2 am or so after its all cleaned up. SO we came home. We have a big morning ahead and I want to be alert! The EGGHUNT day will finally arrive. Everything is packed in the van. The signs, the stakes, the eggs- I still have to make a sign (if I can) and pick up bags at the store in the morning, for those kids who forget to bring something to put the goodies in. Today was busy, but yet relaxed. I had done a good job at trying to spread things out this time. I even had time to put my budget together on this computer and get my son's haircut! It is SOO cute by the way. Another reason he thinks he's a stud muffin. Now that he's 2 1/2 we had to do a style. I even bought stuff to put in his hair. (I am a stucker I no) Now his hair sticks up in front- only in front through. Like the big boys. How come kids grow up so fast?! Not sure if I like it!  Well that is my day in a nutshell. Gonna visit a few sites and hit the hay. Hope you have a great weekend!

      April Fool's Day! One of my favorite days. I get an excuse to play tricks on friends! Yeah, I had fun! The gals at work were thankful the hours were over today. They began to get jumpy on me. I made sure there phones were unhooked, printers unplugged. I even volunteered to pick up lunch and brought them back only part of there orders. (The rest was in my van) I taped one poor girls coat sleeves closed- that didn't work good though, it was 57 degrees out and she didn't put it on! (BUMMER) I was busy thinking all day! One of my friends came up with covering the bottoms of the computer mouses with labels that said "APRIL FOOLS" I got in on that and had a blast.  My husband has lost his cell phone and needs me to get off line to call it! Sorry guys, I can't even say I took it as a joke. So my entry will be short tonight.  Hope you took the time and energy to enjoy this FUN day- share with me your pranks!

      Today I feel that  I got the most done I have in a long time. I cleaned out my garage (which looks better then when we moved in), my front porch, living room, bathtub and am almost done with my son's room. I am planning on cleaning the basement, and the rest of the house Monday. SO much for a day off! I am planning on having a garage sale next weekend, and am quite excited. It is making me clean like a mad women.  Last night we went to the movies and ended up seeing "Sherk 2". I was VERY impressed- esp. cuz I didn't even like the first one! We were suppose to be meeting a bunch of friends to see "The Day after Tomorrow" but when we got there it was SOLD out! We figured if we went to Sherk they should be out about the same time. WRONG- we left the movie and here are all are friends standing in line to go to the 10. They didn't get tickets in time for the sell out either. SO they convinced us to go to the 10 also. My 2 year old was with us! I will have to say he did pretty good. He was great at the first movie, but drank to much and had to go potty like 15 times during the second!!  OH my nightmare came true! We were in Walmart yesterday with my sister and niece. We ran out of room in the cart and let the kids out- BAD move. When we FINALLY caught them, I put my son in the cart. He started wailing, and then all of a sudden said, MAMA PEE PEE BAD! and then it happened...right there...and he was wearing cotton short, so it didn't hold much! I was like STOP!! Luckily a worker was walking past and I was able to grab him, and my sister was there to stay with the dripping cart. We rushed half way across the store to clean up. IT was NOT FUN! But I survied, it was the first accident in a public place. I guess I can say I can stop worrying about it happening because it did.

      We have been having crazy weather here. Storms, storms, storms! I feel like we are living in the basement. Last night I came home to the tornado sirens going off yet again. This is the third time in the past week! So off we go, at least we have a television and couch down there. But all the lighting means I can’t turn on the computer! The forecast is for clear dry weather YEAH! Maybe some of the flooding will go away.  I had my tooth worked on Friday. It is still throbbing! Part of my molar had broken off so I now have my first temporary cap with plans for a root canal! YUCKY! I hate having work done on my teeth- that’s why it broke off. It’s been at least 7 years since I have gone. I do think I found a good one this time. Scary!  I started watching my eating and cutting back. I am going off the weight watcher plan. Today has been the hardest. I think the reason I need to lose weight is that whenever I think about food I eat. Even if I am not hungry. Like right now, I am not hungry, yet I know that there are chocolate brownies upstairs and so I want one. I have not had one, and I WILL NOT GIVE IN TO THE TEMPTATION!  I brought to work lots of healthier chocolate things knowing it was someone’s birthday. HMM somehow it hasn’t worked in my mind. My stomach is saying your fine, but it the mind power I have to overcome. Sound crazy? I do need to take off some weight and I am not using up points on a brownie. There, now that’s out in the open.  I didn’t want ANYONE to know I was watching what I ate, but you know me and my big mouth! Anyway, I had to express this so now I did. If I lose weight I will let you know otherwise DON”T ASK :)

      Well we just got back from Florida. Florida you say…was that planned? NO, my husband’s grandma passed away last Wednesday. We both were like, what do we do. She had been ill for a while now. We ended up running around, getting stuffed packed. Then we found out the funeral would be Friday- so on the plane we went Thursday evening. Those days are a blur. It was nice to meet a lot of the family, just stinks under those circumstances. We ended up staying until Monday night.  My son actually rode the horses this time at his great aunt’s house. He loved it! He rode as someone led of course. (He’s only 2) This is the first time he was old enough to understand flying. The last time we flew was before he hit 2. (Full fare price) Now that he is almost 3 he loved it- he kept saying “go high mama”. He did good, esp. with it being late night travel, we ended are flights after midnight both times.  I still didn’t get to see a gator. OH Well- next time we are going for fun. The one thing that was nice is it forced us to go, we weren’t planning a trip until Christmas again, Grammie and Papa (my in-laws) didn’t like that idea very much. We were able to visit with them and my husbands siblings and there families. Glad to be back home. Not expecting anymore sudden trips. I am going to try to rest over Memorial Day weekend. My teeth are hurting today, I see the dentist tomorrow. Hopefully he can help that. We are taking a bunch of kids to the zoo Saturday. (I know we are crazy) Maybe I will have time to get my house in order and do up all that laundry! I am beginning to go nuts in all the clutter. Bye for now, I will do better I promise!

      Okay- you might ask WHERE YOU BEEN?? Well like the rest of you I have been busy- too busy to turn on the computer. Actually my son gets upset when I play with the computer instead of him, and he had really bad mommy withdraws after I came home from Springfield. SO I had to take a break. I sure have missed my entries! There is so much to tell it’s going to take a few entries to catch up.  Right now I want to complain about something! If you are watching two children one is 2 the other 3 and you know it nap time… do you A. let the 3 year old go outside and play with an adult while the 2 year old cries and screams?  B. make them both lay down to rest? or C. let them both go play? Okay- to me B or C is acceptable.  But A. is what happened to my son. I wonder if I lead the person to believe that he HAD to have a nap. Oh well, nothing I can do about it now. I am thankful that this person could watch my child on short notice. Last night at are last swim class a girl got hurt. Her little brother jumped on her head- from the side of the pool and gave her the WORST bloody nose. I had never seen a child bleed that much from the nose! My son kept pointing to his nose the rest of the night and would say “OHWEE” it really bothered him. I think it bothered me too! YUCKY!  This past weekend we went to Chucky Cheese and out to see the movie “Mean Girls” (interesting movie- good- but interesting) I took my friend C out, we had fun and my son loved it! My husband was at yet another retreat! He asked me Sunday what we had to do this weekend- I told him not much- he said good cuz the last 4 weekends he has been at overnighters. One he did at our house with the guys when I was out of town- but the rest were big deals.  My conference was exciting. I learned a lot- almost overloaded. I am still trying to absorb all the cool stuff I was taught. We started in classes at 8:30 had a lunch break- on site- more classes- finally dinner break- which wasn’t long enough- then back for service at 7 till 9:30 or later. It was tiring but a good time. Glad to be back, trying to get back into the groove.

      This past week has been crazy I made one call and the next thing I know we are out looking to buy a house. We looked at like 10 of them, of course in my mind they became one big house at the end of the day. Right near the end of our search we found it- the house. So now we are in the process of buying it. It is way bigger then the house we currently rent. We have a 2 bedroom house this is a 4 bedroom! This new house also has a 4 - seasons porch and a skylight in the bathroom. Major perks for me! And my husband like the 2 car garage too. ANYWAY it’s nerve racking- are stuff is at the underwriters and should be out on Mon. 2 years ago we began this journey and back out of a bad deal. Plus wow, this house is WAY better then that one. But still I just keep waiting for them to say HA- you can’t have it. We have already been pre-approved, but I really don’t trust that. So we are waiting, and waiting.  Not only are we buying this house we are selling are 2nd car too. My husband has been blessed with a company truck, so are 2nd car just sits in the drive most of the time. So tonight we have to get that all cleaned up and hopefully sell it to this sweet lady in the church. THEN we gave are notice to are landlord, and he wants to bring people through as early as uhhh-NEXT WEEK! So this weekend it is CLEAN CRAZY! Closets, the rest of the basement, garage everywhere. YUCK!  Oh and wait this weekend we kick off one of the biggest events of my year! A FAMILY CRUSADE! Yep Sun-Wed nights we have services with me making sure everything runs smoothly. So I also have to –this weekend - go shopping for the final supplies!  I honestly have know idea HOW this is all going to get accomplished but I am sure going to work my tail off to do it!  My father and I talked this past weekend and I got suckered into watching his pup. He is a Chinese Sheir pei who is really quite a good dog. He likes to sleep in our bed which is SO annoying. We kick him out of course, but last night he wouldn't stop yelping and barking until we opened the door! This dog is way stuck on my hubby. He follows him EVERYWHERE. He won't even let me walk him unless my husband is right there next to him. But THANK Heavens the doggie goes home this weekend! My son and husband are WAY too attached. My son continues to say “mama ask papa jimmy if we can buy it?” I am like NOOOO!!  Any more exposure could be bad for us! Bye, bye,  “buddy” (that’s the dog’s name)

      Okay- so I have not been remembering to journal. SORRY Summer is SOO busy, I hardly turn the computer on, except at work.We just got done with camps around here, so I have been quite busy with data entry.  When fall comes I will do a lot better. Just a quick update... hmm let's see... this summer I spent a week at camp with 4-6th graders, we got some new furiture, so we have been rearranging, and I have lost 36 pounds. Camp was a blast, hardly any sleep but the services were awesome. I had a peanut butter facial, and had to put my face in flour to get bubble gum. (I WON the one) All were new experiences for me, but of course the kids LOVED it, so it was worth it. New furiture was a blessing, didn't realize my sofa was that bad! We didn't have to pay a penny either which was even cooler. My husband's job has proven great benefits once again. We not only got a sofa but an intable, book cabinet and a couple other things. I have added walk and watching to my life. I try to walk at least 4 times a week 2 1/2 miles and I watch closely what I food I intake. I have been doing this for 12 weeks tomorrow and have lost 36 pounds. WOHOO! I have also been blessed with a coworker losing weight, so she is giving me great hand me downs. I feel like a kid again! No I really have loved it. My job requires me to wear skirts or dresses, which is fine but when you lose weight those cost a little bit more. Plus I plan to lose a lot more... and I don't want to buy much until I hit my goal. SO it's great to have hand me downs.  My son is growing like crazy. He will be 3 this month. He is all about spiderman. We plan on getting him a Spiderman bike and the little guy has been waiting all summer for his birthday. If you say what do you want for your birthday it is a spiderman bike. The other day he very cutely said "mama can I have 2 presents?" he then said "spiderman bike and bob" He also likes Bob the builder. It was so cute. Of course his party will be Spiderman this year, it's not like it's everywhere! HA! We actually took him to see the movie.. it had a couple violent scenes which when we covered his eyes he fought us. He enjoyed it just as much as we did. CRAZY!  Little kids pick up on things. My 1st cousin is being sent to Iraq on the 18th and we had his going away party Sunday. He will be gone for 18-24 months. My son and I have now began praying at bedtime for him. When we get to his name I tell my son he's in the army and he promptly responds "fight hard?" and I say "yeah he's going to go fight" and then he says "he die?" and I say "no, that's why we are praying for him" We play army men all the time and he always has men that die... so when we pray for my cousin he puts fighting and dieing together. Of course his guys jump back up in 2 seconds after dieing but then again that's a 2 year old.

      I have not written in a while. &nbsp;I was at my grandparents this weekend! It was a blast, I was picked up halfway to their house at our "meeting stop" and then we drove to their home. I caught a frog there, read for a while, etc. &nbsp;On Saturday morning I woke up, had a big breakfast, let "Frogger" go and got ready to go a few states over to my aunt and uncle's house. We drove there; I slept the full 4 hours or more there. &nbsp;We had a lot of fun at their house, we went to a few shops, that were really fun and cool. I stayed the night with them, along with my grandpa and grandma. My cousins and I played all the next day, until we went out to eat, dropped off my aunt, uncle, and cousins and went home. I made sure I had all of my stuff packed, and then my grandparents took me to Texaco to meet my mother. My mom took me from there to Subway, we ate and came home. &nbsp;Last night I slept with the family dog, and woke up early because she was throwing a fit (she needed to go outside) and here I am. All ready for school! -Christa

       Change is not always a bad thing! My site here, is undergoing some slight changes. It is not all that bad... REALLY! Its better with my mothers help.       So, I have been kinda busy. My sis, mom, and I watched a movie last night; it was pretty good! Quality time with the girls. :chuckles:  VB camp ended yesterday, so next week its just regular practice, for the JV at 8:00-11:00am.  Umm... What else shall I tell you? How about, that I am having some really weird dreams?? Last night I dreamt that I was trying to type Hola to a friend in this game, and it came out looking like this...  Me: Jaeo Friend: Huh!? Me: Ack! Friend:! Friend:! Me: Al olha Friend: !  Lets just say, that my dream ended when I finally was able to type:  Me: HOLA!

      Okay, well... What shall I talk about? How about VB again? No, tired of that? Okay. How about what else I did today? Okay, I will start there.  When I woke up, My mother was gone. I went into the master bed room and woke up my step-father, to ask where she was. He told me she went to my sister's house to help with her baby. So my step-father took me to VB practice. When I got home, I cleaned my entire room, reorganizing it again. Then I took a long, warm bath. While I did that I read a book, I borrowed from my brother's room. While in the bath I was told that I had a doctors appointment and we are leaving at 2:15! It was 1:15, so I got dressed and did my hair.   Now you are all caught up, basically. I ate, and used the rest room, and watched a little TV but that is irrelevant.  Well I have to get going so I won't be late to my Doc. App.! Bye!

       Yesterday I wrote a little about, what I would like to do when I am older. I also wrote a little about volleyball. Today I had volleyball early again, and my muscles hurt horribly!  Today I would like to talk about... Hobbies. I really enjoy the following:      Late in the afternoon, watching the sun go down while some of the nocturnal animals come out. Watching the birds fly to there nests as fast as they can to feed there screeching babies. Really anything having to do with nature! Just being around wild life. Especially with a camera.    Taking long, warm, bubbling baths with soft smelling candles, and a good inspirational romance novel.    Cleaning my room, and re-organizing it.     Looking through old documents, I have kept and remembering the past. Even reading past journals.    Writing journals, poetry, stories, and skits.     Okay, so there is a few of the things I like to do. There is my short journal for the day!

         Wow! I haven't written in a while. My mother has been trying to get me to log on, and journal. But my excuses to not do it are dwindling so I decided, " Heck, why not!?"  I have been doing volleyball camp this week, and I registered for my high school yesterday. The Volleyball has been great, but my muscles are not doing so well. I am in a lot of pain... It could be because A) I haven't exercised in a few months, or B) I am just lazy and doing all of this work is just weird!? I think I like the first answer better though.  I wanted to tell you all what I would like to do in the future. Here is my list:

      About 6-7 months ago I developed some sort of blood cyst on my left leg. I had thought it started from an ingrown hair but that really doesn't matter. The fact is that my husband kept bugging me to have it looked at so I finally went to the doctor and she didn't know what it was and referred me to a specialist. I went for an appointment last week and then had the small cyst removed yesterday. During the process, he found another small cyst on my neck and removed that as well. What is totally amazing to me is that I was out of the office in less than an hour and back to work. I joked that it felt like a drive-up surgery - although the level of competence was very high.  We've got some changes going on with Christa's care and although it's a bit anxious, I have hope that it is for the best and that Christa will find that she is receiving everything she needs for a complete recovery.  Jen is looking so beautiful in pregnancy and I am so excited about being a grandmother. Her baby shower is coming up in April (April 24th) and then the Lamaze classes will begin. She has asked that I assist the birthing coach (I'm not sure the real term but this is a professional woman who helps *parents* in the delivery room) and it brings back all sorts of memories of when my mother was in the birthing room with me.

      Had a pretty good weekend. My oldest moved from her Grimes home to Ankeny (a bit closer to us) and Denny was at his Father's so it allowed some much needed quiet time for Christa. Was able to get a lot of laundry done. Spring break is over for the two younger kids and so they are back in school this week but my husband is on his this week. Last week was a bit rough for him in trying to get finals done and such. I see all that he's trying to accomplish with school and working and dealing with me and the kids and sometimes I feel sorry for him. Poor guy! He's doing great though.

      I had a fantastic birthday! My husband and kids took me out for lunch and brought gifts and a balloon. My oldest daughter had my favorite scent delivered to me via a potted shrub (plant that blooms - gardenia), my middle daughter created a beautiful memory book with photos and poetry and my son gave me a huge warm fuzzy by telling his father he wanted to spend the evening with me instead. My husband gave me my favorite PC game called Tropico2 - Pirate Cove (I get to play a pirate and ravage lands and sail the high seas for treasure - mostly I get to rule my little paradise island however I want - finally I can control something!!!). I also received a Thomas Kinkade puzzle which I am almost finished putting together. Jen also got me a popcorn popper and a Grandmother's memory book for me to share with my forming grandbaby. I am so excited about that lil bugger forming in her tummy it's getting hard to contain it.  We went shopping at Babies R Us for her shower and I was amazed at all the excited "new" things they have out for babies now. Some of the stuff seemed downright silly though. Nothing like spoiling the new mommy and baby! When my children were little we didn't have little jiggle seats so I had to take the baby carrier and rock it with my foot. I was able to keep "baby" content AND build up my leg muscles!!! Here's her baby shower registry on the web: click HERE.  Things have been busy at work. Our annual District Council is coming up and since I am the District Secretary's secretary, I am the one to keep notes on the entire event. This year is going to be really hard as they are trying to vote out my boss. It's so hard to see him come in to work day after day and do his best (he's a fantastic boss, hard worker and great manager) and see how he is being (not so covertly) ousted. I can only pray that God is watching over the entire event and His will is being done. I care about all the people in the office and I can understand why all the decisions are being made... but it doesn't mean I have to like them or even that they are being done correctly or in the right way. Personally (of course, no one asked MY opinion) I could have come up with other ways to have handled this situation.  We are all busy planning the baby shower and then we will be on to planning our June Wedding. This will be a very busy Spring! Hope to see you all in the coming months!!!

      Had friends over last night for my birthday celebration. She and her husband brought over delicious Spaghetti Pie and wonderful garlic bread as well as Marble cake with Scooby Doo stuff. I love Scooby Doo! She also got me a Scooby Doo glass some M&amp;Ms and some Asian hair sticks (I had been looking for them for my wedding with no luck). I feel really blessed to have a friendship with Brandie and her husband Eric. My boss had called and invited me and my husband out for dinner and we'll try to find time next week or the week after for a nice get together. Am looking forward to going to my mother's today to visit with her... it seems ages since we've had a chance to sit and chat.

      We were dumped with quite a bit of snow here in Iowa but the warmer weather has it melting and the ground is pretty soggy. The family and I went to Cutty's for Wednesday Family Night and enjoyed swimming and talking. We finished our night with a rousing game of Traditional Mah Jongg (Dave's mom sent it to us from California - bless her heart). As we begin to understand the game mechanics, we are enjoying ourselves more and more. It is interesting learning different cultures and I'm looking forward to meeting Dave's mother and brother when they come from California for our wedding in June.

      Things are progressing well for my oldest daughter's baby shower. We went out last weekend and picked up the paper products and decorations and peanuts. Just need a really good punch recipe that is easy and cheap (coughs). Been working on the wedding invitations, folding, cutting &amp; addressing the envelopes. I only wish I had someone who could build a pagoda for my back yard (and someone else who could supply the wood!) and I'd love to have my pond in by then. Money just doesn't want to agree with me. Still fighting with the Child Support people in trying to get the money they took away from me. Doesn't look like they care. But life goes on and I'm sure everything will be fine with or without a decorated back yard. As my Xanga friends told me, people will be too busy looking at the happy couple to worry that there is nothing else to look at... yeah right!

      Things are going to start getting really crazy at work for the next 2 weeks. April 26th-28th is our annual District Council and this year they are trying to re-organize how the district office functions. Though I appreciate that the organization that I work for is trying to be efficient and is trying to stay with the times, I'm not so sure I agree with the methods they've used in coming to their decisions. What it boils down to is that they are trying to eliminate my boss' position and possibly my position and farm it out to full time pastors throughout the state of Iowa. Since it is our jobs to screen potential candidates for new ministers, my boss and I take this position very seriously - especially in light of all the recent and past allegations of religious molestation issues. It is my fear that "farming" this position out to a full time pastor who is already very busy with his own congregation might mean that this very important piece of the Secretary-Treasurer's job could be overlooked or mishandled. What really concerns me is that the Superintendent and some of the other high level ministers in the state already act as if the (all minister) vote has been cast and my boss has been cast out. For the past several months, the Superintendent has not copied my boss on important information, nor has he shared information that my boss should be in on. It has left me in a very awkward position as well as left my boss in the dark. In any case, the upcoming meeting will be very interesting. I pray that whatever scheme has been hatched to destroy the State of Iowa's ministry credibility be stopped, that God's will be done for this religious organization and that a plausible reorganization and a above-board plan be told. What this means for me in the upcoming weeks is that I have quite a bit of work to do to prepare for the meeting and then I will be very busy during the meeting taking notes as I am the secretary in charge of dictation. Thank goodness I will know first-hand what is going on. I will also get to see who is saying what for and against my boss. Although, I probably don't need to know that.

      Had a very busy weekend but was able to catch up on some sleep. I actually slept in until 10 am on Saturday. WOW! I haven't done that in so long that I can't even remember when the last time was. (Course, I had to take a sleeping pill to help me do that) Christa went to spend time with her Grandma Patch and Denny was at his dad's. Jen spent the weekend at my house though. Although I had Friday off, I spent most the day running around catching up on errands and driving around. Saturday was spent sleeping and working on my hobby (a dragon puzzle). I've also been working on my wedding invitations... I hope to be sending them out soon. Dave and I have been asked several times about a WEDDING GIFT REGISTRY and so we finally went to TARGET and registered. We also registered at AMAZON. If you are interested you can visit the sites at the links.&nbsp; (links de-activated)

      Just got back from the library with the family. Christa had decided she wanted to join the youth group at our church and we want to support her efforts to be a part of positive programs. We dropped her off and the rest of us was able to spend quiet time reading. It was nice. Looking forward to the 3 day weekend as our boss has decided to allow us to have Good Friday off - it's about time seeing as how I work for a religious organization and it is a religious observance! Denny will be at his dad's this weekend and I believe Christa is spending time with her grandparents so this will allow my new husband and I some much needed *us* time. We are going to go out on a date Friday! Woohoo!

      The weekend went fairly fast. There are times when I feel pulled in all directions. I wonder if God knew that 2 hands weren't going to be enough?! I suppose it's more that there was just so much to do and I didn't feel I had enough time to do it. I had wanted to check out a trade show for modular homes and didn't even have a chance to check to go. I did get the shower invitations done and I was able to get some HTML (web changes) done on another site. I finished my church stuff and I successfully stayed sane this weekend! That was a doozy!!!

      How was your April Fools day? Mine was crazy fun. A co-worker, "B", and I put labels on the bottom of the computer *mice* at work that said "April Fools!!". This effectively made others think their mouse had stopped working. One worker actually rebooted their system 2 times before they figured it out! haha "B" also tried to get me by unplugging my computer's printer and telephone. She also pulled out all my staples in the stapler, put tape on my chair and taped up my bookbag, AND the last straw was when she hid the straw from my drink!!! hehe Unfortunately, I caught on to all these gags and nothing got me by surprise (let's just say a lil birdie told me some of them - and for that, she got hers too!)  I got my husband and oldest daughter really good... I told them I received the results back from the doctor and that he felt the cyst on my leg was originally caused by a bug bite. Said bite had become infected and the skin had grown up around it. The reason it had become infected was because said bug had deposited a lil something under my skin (a baby bug) YUCK! They fell for it big time!! GROSS!! I really wish I could have seen their faces.  After work on Friday, I went over and helped my oldest daughter re-arrange her apartment and sort through boxes. She has a nice place (albeit smaller than she's had before) and it should suit her and her baby well. I love that it's on the bottom floor in a bit of a secluded alcove and safe from tornados and high winds and rain.  For all the friends &amp; family who reads this... mark your calendars for Saturday, April 24th! That's Jen's baby shower. She has a link on her journal for the baby shower gift registry. We will be sending out cards on Monday.

      Wow, has it been that long since I've updated my journal??? Shame on me! I suppose if I was real honest, I would tell you that I have been on an emotional rollar coaster this past month and that the upcoming wedding has left me quite panicked. I realized that there was just a month left and I hadn't really done anything to get prepared. Well, I'm down to a couple of weeks and I'm still a bit anxious but it's more that I want people to feel comfortable and happy when they come here. I'm the ever-hopeful hostess - hoping that people will enter my home and feel at-ease and peaceful. I work very hard to set people in the right frame of mind because I don't like feeling uncomfortable or out of place. I am looking forward to meeting his family, quite a few are coming in for the wedding.  Jen has been over several times helping with landscaping the front and back walkways and I must say it is a vast improvement! Ever seen a pregnant lady with a hoe? Let me tell you, just stand back! I was worried about my fingers a couple of times... hehe. I've a few other things I'd like to do over this weekend to help bring an atmosphere of comfort and tranquility. Nothing fancy by any means and it is mostly just cosmetic (non-expensive) things...but boy do they make a big difference. It just says, I care about the things I have. I picked up a self-propelled hand mower for Mother's Day and the kids have worked hard (mostly Christa) on keeping the lawn up. I am so appreciative of that. It really makes a big difference. Although we don't have quite a full acre of land, it sure does take quite an effort to keep it all up.  We finished up our last Lamaze class last night. Jen says she is ready to have this baby. She aches now and feels there is just no more room for it to move or grow. She has until July 4th (they say)... boy, do I remember the last month! UGH! M-I-S-E-R-A-B-L-E... she is still beautiful in pregnancy though. She is carrying all in the front and has a lower heart rate (which is counter-productive since one means girl and the other boy!). We met with the Doula and I felt really comfortable with this woman. She is experienced in child birth and will be a wonderful asset in the delivery room. For those who do not know what this is, she is a trained "helper" to assist the mother-to-be and coach with the delivery who can be a go-between with the hospital staff in making sure that the family's wishes are met. Although she can't make decisions, etc., she can help the family stay informed of what is happening.  Denny and Christa's last day of school was yesterday and they are now officially summer delinquents! YIKES! Christa is looking for a summer job and is trying to get her permit for Driver's ed. She basically has one shot at taking the exam today in order to start her class next Tuesday. If she fails, she will have to take the class at a later time (not through school) or next year. No pressure at all there, Christa!!! They will both be going to a wonderful non-religious camp at the end of June for a week and are really looking forward to that.  I am so happy for my husband. He just got a job as a senior framer for Michael's Craft store in Ankeny. He will be working full time and have benefits. His schooling will be cut back for the time being to part time. He had to go through 3 interviews (and competed against another applicant) and really hit it off with the framer manager. He is excited since this position is in the field of art and required an art background. The pay is better than his prior position as well. Actually, this will be the first job he has held that will actually utilize his art schooling. I'm so proud of him!!!

      Started looking at my site and thought I really wanted something a bit more graphic based and less ... hmmm... plain. As I began to look into how to make the site more user-friendly and more pleasing to the eye, I realized just how uneducated I am in all the new ways to build web sites. I have been brain-fogged ever sense! Certainly having ComfyCorner has been a wonderful hobby and it keeps me busy and I love it. There are times when I have so many dreams of where I want the site to be and then I realize I just don't have the knowledge to get it there and certainly not the moola to dish out. Since it is a non-profit site, seems silly to pay someone to spruce it up. After-all, it is MY hobby. So, I try not to get discouraged and I remind myself that it doesn't have to change all at once, that I can make small changes here and there and be happy with the little things that make it unique and all MINE.  As to what is happening in my world, I have been going to Lamaze classes with Jen and am quite surprised at how different things are in the birth room now then 20 years ago when I gave birth to her. Who would have thought they would allow a birthing ball (exercise ball) or Jacuzzi bath or for a woman giving birth to squat on the hospital flour or to be on all fours while giving birth!? We are a long way from laying flat on our backs with our feet up in those cold metal supports and having no familiar faces in the room with us. I would have loved to have a popcicle or a tape of my favorite songs or even.... well, there's no sense me thinking back to all the things I didn't get that she is getting now. ENVY is a wasted feeling. hehe  Going to take a trip down to see my mother for mother's day and I'm taking her mother with me. Then it's back home to do my church bulletin and straighten up my house. I can't believe how quickly the wedding is coming upon us. All the landscaping I had wanted to do will not be done and there is no sense worrying or stressing about it. As it stands, I am hoping to have some decorative rock and rent a tent with chairs. I pray that we are able to have someone come mow the grass. It is so bad that when the cat goes out, he almost completely disappears!!!

      Phew, last week is finally over. The big meetings at my job did not go well and they voted my boss out. It was really hard for me to deal with but my faith is such that I know my boss and his wife will be blessed. He is a wonderful Christian man and is a faithful man of integrity. I was flat-out shocked by some of the events during the meeting and felt I was smack-dab in a nightmare. It is so difficult to see innocent people hurt like that. Hurt by people calling themselves Christians. I suppose it really made me begin to look at myself.   My husband, son and I went to see a movie on Friday called "13 Going on 30" and it really got me thinking about the choices I make. I realized that no matter how I am treated or what I may go through in life, how I present myself and how I behave really display my character or nature. As a Christian my character or nature should be of God. As I began looking at my character, I realized that I wasn't all that I could be. I want to be MORE. BETTER. As we make our journey in life, we may take a wrong path and need to take another path to get back on track. I suppose that this weekend was my way of making that adjustment. It was time for me to get back on track. Time for me to "come home".

      The wedding was wonderful and his family was everything I could have hoped for. I really appreciated his mother and step-father and the warmth they shared with each other and extended to me and my children. His brother and brother's fiance were wonderful as well! They had so many great stories and lots of pictures to share. It was a fantastic time! Make sure to check out the wedding album&nbsp;(when I get it posted)&nbsp;for all the fun photos. I'm sure there will be plenty added as I get more from others who took photos as well.   Four days after having the big event, I arrived at work and was called into the Superintendent's office and was told that I no longer had a job. Since they had voted my boss out of office, my position was being eliminated as well. I was saddened by the news as I really loved my position there and hurt that they couldn't have kept me working there. But I had a feeling they would get rid of me. The good news was that they didn't FIRE me and told me they would give me a good recommendation (though I won't use them - I will be using my prior boss and my lovely co-workers). They took me out to lunch and gave me a $25.00 gift card to a really nice Italian restaurant as well as 4 weeks paid salary (plus the rest of this last week) after my showing the office manager all my current work projects.   I will really miss working with Rev. Kyle Anderson and his wife Cheryl. They are truly two wonderul people of God. Brandie and Katie are two great co-workers whom I have had the awesome blessing of working along side for the past three years. Countless times, when it was almost unbearable to deal with dogmatic and legalistic attitudes, these two woman made me laugh and helped me see that not all of God's people looked at life through such narrow ways.   We come across so many "religious" people in our lives and many of them have such persistent views on Christianity, it was and is such a real blessing to me to have met some fantastic men and women who live their lives not only in a REAL relationship with God on the inside but honestly and humbly showing it on the outside. With no gimmicks, no show and no lies.   After 7 years of having left my own business, I have decided to try my hand at it once again. There is a peace that comes in knowing I am in accordance with a greater plan and yet a fear that I may fail. By all means, if you know of anyone who needs typing, transcription or secretarial work done, send them my way!!! I have over 21 years of experience in the business world with medical, insurance and legal knowledge. I am also a notary public and can do web design, development and maintenance. (a short plug for my business...)

      As the wedding day approaches, I find myself calming down. I am actually looking forward to meeting Dave's family! As all the major preparations are now complete, there is really nothing for me to stress over so I am now just doing last minute straightening up around the house (we DO have to live here afterall) and making sure the weather doesn't ruin any of the new landscaping. I keep praying for a decent day (no rain and cooler weather - upper 70's and breezy) on Saturday and hope that God blesses us... but if there is a greater need elsewhere it won't be because God is punishing us or isn't blessing our marriage. I see His blessings everyday.  Things are calm at work. I'm just waiting to find out whether I will still have a job once my boss is let go at the end of July. It would be really nice if they would just say, we will no longer need your services at the end of July - at least then I would know for sure what is expected. I really love my job too. I love knowing that what I do is helping in the scheme of things within the kingdom of God. I may not be called to preach or even teach the Gospel but I am good in an administrative role and I love talking to potential candidates and getting their paperwork ready. I enjoy working with our ministers and churches as well. We have such a wonderful group of men and woman who have a heart after God. I am really blessed to have met some of them. Certainly, there have been some that I don't have the same views as, but even the disciples did things differently. God didn't create us all to be robots! He gave us beautiful differing personalities.  Dave and I have really had a chance to see each other on different levels this past several weeks. It is usually rather difficult for second (or more) marriages to act like first ones especially when one or both partners have established lives. So, with the loan for home improvements well in progress, Dave and I have had a chance to really do some upgrading and add some of OUR personal touches to the (my prior) home and get some things that we have wanted and it has felt a lot like what newly married couples get to do. We felt almost silly last night with shopping for some of our items until I explained that a lot of couples when buying a new home or their first home do the same thing. This is OUR first home together and we should take the time to make it just right for US. It's allowed us to see each other in roles other than just friends and I'm glad to say we are doing just fine with it. An established friendship really has a way of making everything else just fall into place.  Christa and Denny have been given a 5 day all expense paid trip to camp this year by the family program we are involved in - they have truly been such a blessing to our entire family. This same program gave us extra food at Christmas as well as gifts!! They are both really excited about the camp idea as they will get to go horseback riding, swimming, boating, etc. Although they've been sent to camps in the past, this is a secular one and not privately owned. I think they will have greater opportunities for adventure. The other advantage to this camp is that they will both be going together so won't feel so isolated and lonely, yet it is big enough that they can still be "away" from each other if need be.  Well, everyone, hope you are all doing well. Take care and talk to you soon...I hope.

      As the wedding day approaches, I find myself more anxious. The big things such as landscaping (what I could get done with the money available) is complete and the house has been cleaned. Now it is just the last minute set up of wedding stuff such as the cupcake tree design, flowers, etc. We may find ourselves baking 72 cupcakes right before the wedding since no one seems to want to do different flavors than chocolate and vanilla. Ah well.  As the end of my boss's term comes closer I am feeling much more as if my job will be ending as well. Nothing concrete has been said, just a feeling I have from things said in done in the office. With Dave having a full time job, it makes me wonder if it is time to think of a different job path. Summer is always an interesting time with having both kids home from school. So there are a few adjustments and me shuffling trying to make sure everyone is getting along and me staying at work. Plus there is the added pressure to my brain due to the atmospheric changes which cause migraines. All this and the wedding coming next week is causing a bit of stress... but I'm hanging in there. I know that the majority of what I fear for next week is just meeting new people as most of the people coming next week are Dave's family. Plus, the attention will be focused on us. YUCK!

      For as long as I remember I've been the one making the money, paying the bills and being totally responsible for kids and all that being a single mom entails.&nbsp; Even before being single, I seemed to be the responsible one.&nbsp; When my third child was born and my (first) husband and I decided that I would stay home, it wasn't long before I had my own business going and I was making as much money as he was.&nbsp; I've just never been the stay-at-home&nbsp;type of person.&nbsp; My entire ambition in life has not been to be a stay-at-home mom.&nbsp; Don't get me wrong, I have a lot of respect for women that stay at home and take care of their children.&nbsp; I've just never seen myself in that role.&nbsp; Not that I don't think I'm a good mom, I'm just someone that had always needed to satisfaction of something MORE.&nbsp; Now, with the birth of my grandchild and the loss of my job, I'm finding myself in a position that I haven't been in for 12 years.&nbsp;&nbsp;Once again, my husband is out making the money (though I still handle the money just because that is something I'm good at and I like to do - not that my husband isn't good at it.&nbsp; He's equally efficient and qualified in that department) and I'm staying home.&nbsp; Although I have&nbsp;started up my transcription&nbsp;business again and have placed ads, I've not had any "bites" and am looking at the possibility that the economy may not be "ripe" for my business this time around.&nbsp; I don't plan on giving up on this avenue as yet but I still find myself in a position&nbsp;that puts&nbsp;me in unfamiliar territory.&nbsp;   It's the big switch...&nbsp;My husband had been going to school full time and&nbsp;worked part time while I was out working full time and now I'm staying home&nbsp;working part time and he's out working full time.&nbsp; Interesting how life has a way of doing an about face.&nbsp; What's even more interesting is how personalities&nbsp;and responsibilities change with the switch.&nbsp; I'm seeing my husband in a&nbsp;different light once again - it's nice.&nbsp; So, although it's a bit scary and a little difficult to get used to at times, it's also wonderful to know that I can spend time with my grandson and catch up on things that I've not been able to do in a long time.&nbsp; I'm also finishing up some work for a client - that job will end the end of this month.  All in all, I really never saw myself as staying at home AFTER my kids were raised.&nbsp; Sure, I could see staying home while they were young... but your mind begins to think differently when you know they are getting older and no longer need you the same way.&nbsp; My husband and I already discussed if we wanted to have a baby (he's not had children of his own) and we both agreed that my children were HIS children too.&nbsp; So, my mindset was that I would continue to work until I retired or something else come up.&nbsp; So, here I am trying to adjust to staying home and NOT working full time.&nbsp; Time will tell...  &nbsp;

      The weekend seemed to fly by.&nbsp; Went out with Brandie and Eric on Saturday night.&nbsp; We went to a Mongolian restaurant (the Hu Hot Grill) and then to see the movie, I Robot.&nbsp; Wow.&nbsp; I really liked this movie.&nbsp; Of course, I'm thinking it's a prequel to the Terminator and Matrix type movies.&nbsp; NOT saying they are LIKE each other but more the story lines co-exist.&nbsp; In other words, just how did we get from human-run to computer-run?&nbsp; Just when did humans allow robots to take over?&nbsp; This movie seems a logical reference to go from.  Sunday was filled with church, an after the church on-the-grounds picnic and then my husband was baptised at Big Creek (which is a part of the man-made Saylorville Lake) near Polk City, Iowa.&nbsp; Another couple and their two children also got baptised and I was able to get the entire event captured on video.&nbsp; I must say that he was much more bold than I.&nbsp; My baptism was more cloistered in a church setting where he was in front of complete strangers in a public forum.&nbsp; On of the bad things about this is that people where screaming and laughing and yelling and it was harder to concentrate and really focus on what was happening.  Today is the first day that I am officially watching my new grandson.&nbsp; He turned a month old Friday and is staying awake for longer periods of time.&nbsp; He's such a sweet lil guy.&nbsp; Not fussy for the most part and certainly NOT picky.&nbsp; My daughter really is a very lucky person.&nbsp; I recall my lil babies screaming because they didn't have that SPECIAL pacifier (the one I accidently lost).&nbsp; He does seem to have his nights and days mixed up though and tends to want to sleep from around 6-7pm until 11-12 pm.&nbsp; That 5 hour break would feel wonders or be better utilized at say 12-5 am... but there is no reasoning with a one month old...&nbsp; I keep trying, for his momma's sake.

      As a parent you quickly realize that you are responsible for&nbsp;teaching your children all about life but in the end, the interesting thing you discover is what&nbsp;your kids eventually&nbsp;teach you.&nbsp; In this particular instance, once again, my oldest has introduced me to a much easier way to do&nbsp;journals through my website.&nbsp; Thank you daughter dearest!&nbsp; I hope this will encourage some of my faithful readers to actually leave me comments... encourage me and/or tell me I'm full of it... ha!

      Went to my 20 year class reunion last weekend. Hmmm... what to say about that... Let's just say that I took a small trip back in time and am awefully glad I am where I am now. I really do like who I am now and all that I've accomplished since I left high school. I'm a different person with different goals and ideas.   I was thinking back to some of the dreams I had for my life. One of those was to travel around the United States on a motorcycle and get odd jobs to pay the way in restaurants and such. I had such high hopes of really viewing the world first hand. Not only seeing it, but tasting and feeling it too. I also wanted and had saved up for a cruise for my graduation present. If my wonderlust failed, I also dreamed of working in a high rise as some important executive but I didn't much care for that dream much... too confiining.  Where am I now? I never took that cruise. I found out I was pregnant at the age of 17 and I used my money for furniture, a car, and a downpayment on an apartment. I never did travel the world on the back of a bike... nor have I really ever went very far from home. In fact, I live just 5 minutes away from where I grew up and my kids attend the same school I graduated from.  Do I regret it? No. I don't. I had moments when the kids where younger when I hated being tied down (my first husband can surely attest to that - poor guy! Of course, that might have been because I was left home caring for them by myself for the most part without his assistance) but for the most part, I love that I've accomplished something greater than flitting from one place to another. I've created a family environment. A place where people feel comfortable and relaxed (at least I hope so). I'm actually friends with my kids as well as a parent (tip: be a parent first and foremost) and they know they can come to me and talk to me about anything.   So, I'm sitting there (at the reunion) watching some of these people and thinking, "Hmm, you haven't changed at all. You're still as stuck up as ever!" or for the most part thinking, "Wow, you have really changed for the better! You are so nice and sweet and approachable and I can tell you really care about your family." I was pleasantly surprised that almost every single person I ran into had actually grown up in the past 20 years and was nice. Unfortunately, there are still stuck up witches in the world and our class didn't escape it's share. I just don't have time for people like that.  Anyway, it's nice looking back and seeing where you've come from and how much you've grown and changed AND it's even better when you are happy about the changes within yourself. YEAH!

      Well, it's been a while. My oldest daughter had her baby and I've been really busy helping her take care of him. He was 9lbs, 9ozs and was 20-1/4 inches long at birth. His APGAR score wasn't very good and they worked on him a bit to get him breathing okay. He was born with a "dimple" on his tailbone that had to be x-rayed. Fortunately, it didn't go all the way through. So, he'll be fine. He developed jaundice after coming home and had to be put on the blanket 24 hours a day. Let me tell you, it is no fun trying to pickup, feed and change a baby while he's hooked up to that thing. He wasn't eating real well either and lost a bit too much weight.   But all is good now! He is off the blanket and his jaundice count is back to 0. I believe his highest count was an 18 (25 would require hospitalization). His weight is up to (at last count) 8lbs, 13oz. So the doc is still monitoring that until he is back up to birth weight. He would only eat 1/2 an ounce or so at a feeding and wanted to sleep all the time at first. Now he's up to about 3 to 3-1/2 ounces a feeding and he's actually awake sometimes and playing.  What this means for me... with the baby staying here is that I'm not getting a whole lot of sleep. UGH. But, he's way too cute to complain too much. My daughter and I try to trade off as best we can but she requires more sleep right now due to trying to heal from her major "blow out". hehe  The nurses on the delivery room floor were calling her super and wonder woman because she delivered that baby without any sort of medication. No pain, numbing or anything. AND, she stayed in control (only lost focus two times but quickly got refocused again) despite poor Nate's head getting stuck. The doc had to come in (after about an hour of pushing) to turn it about a bit . His poor little head (or big head!) had several bruises from the ordeal.  I'm doing fairly well after having lost my position. I've been busy with the baby but have been typing for a college professor in my spare time. The worst of it was when my computer crashed and I lost all my files and pictures. I was heartbroken. It's taken me almost a month to get everything back up and running. I'll never be able to bring my pics back though (those that weren't already loaded on the web). I also lost a whole bunch of recipes my aunt sent me to add to the recipe zone and I'm so upset about it. She had to have taken quite a bit of time and effort to type them all on my forms and then to have my computer delete everything! I am so sorry.  I've got quite a bit of catching up to do with the web site and with work so I had best get moving. BTW, I bought a laptop computer to replace my baaaad pc and I'm so in love with it. HP, you rock!

      Was hit with a migraine on Saturday that pretty much flattened me.  Last month, I had been hit hard and this month was its twin sister, Esther!  (Don't ask me where I came up with the name - I just thought of it)  In and out of it with pain medication, sleep and running errands for kids the past couple of days.  Middle daughter has been and continues to be busy with daily volleyball practice and my son had to get glasses.  He is quite handsome in his new specs, if I do say so myself.  Would like to take a trip to the fair but am not sure when it will happen; if it will happen.  The continual migraine is understandable (it jumped from my left to right eye on Monday) as I awoke to rain and it's been raining off and on throughout the day.  I usually have problems when the barometric pressure changes or shifts.  Other than that and trying to keep up to date on the website, things are fairly normal around here.  Life is always hectic and crazy and something HAS to go wrong in my world or it would be too boring.  I didn’t decide that.  I think someone upstairs came up with that plan.  Me?  I’d prefer a simple no-hassle, no-nonsense, NO crazy-stuff-happening-in-my-life plan!

      Nice softball game today with USA against Australia.  I'm not a big sports fan but I just happened to turn the channel and noticed the USA team beginning a softball game against Australia.  Caught the drama of how they were big competitors since 1996 and how each olympic game against each other there has been some sort of upset.  Of course, that drew me in.  Most likely the reason why I kept the channel still was the memories of watching my oldest daughter playing softball.  She pitched a bit in her time.  Even further back than that is the memory of going to watch my cousin, Rhonda, pitch games for her school.  This past week, her father past away from Cancer.  He was a very healthy man, one of the healthiest of his siblings.  At sixty-something, he was thriving and it was a shock when he went to the hospital for a slight stomache upset 2 weeks ago to hear that he had an agressive form of cancer.  A week later, he was being taken off life support and refusing to eat.  The next night, he was gone.  I'm not particularly close to my father's side of the family.  The most we see each other is, sadly to say, at funerals or such events.  But it doesn't stop the memories of when I was growing up and watching my cousins and Dad's family.  Life moves on and people change, mature, and grow up... but family is family and that never changes.  It doesn't matter how often you see each other or how often you talk, you'll always have them as family.  So, I watched the USA win in a mercy ruling against Australia today and let the memories wash over me.  Memories are great.  Families are great.  I need to get out more and mingle with mine.  Give myself more memories for the years to come.

      Whoever had the bright idea that having children would be FUN never took into account that they are very VERY expensive!  Sure, they are fun when they aren't yelling at you because you didn't wash their clothes despite the fact that they forgot to put the dirty items in the laundry room and despite the fact that you told them you wouldn't HUNT them down.  Sure, they are fun when they aren't leaving dirty dishes in the living room for the dogs to spill on to your freshly cleaned carpet and sure they are fun when they aren't trying to kill each other because one of them accidently crossed their eye at the other the wrong way.  I mean, come on, they are fun when you don't have to drag them kicking and screaming to somewhere, anywhere, they don't want to go.  Afterall, somewhere around the age of TWO, they suddenly become the higher authority in intelligence and we no longer have a clue about anything.  So, sure, they are fun.  When we get to buy them braces and pick out the fun, pretty, EXPENSIVE new colors and when they suddenly have 20/40 vision in BOTH eyes and MUST have the lattest fashionable glasses (after all, they can't wear just ANY OLD THING!), and they are even more fun when you are trying to find lost doctor records for immunizations!  OH YEAH... kids are a lot of fun!  Then they are a royal pain in the butt when it's time to sit down and cuddle and watch a really good family movie.  Why?  I knew you would ask that!  Because they always want the best seat in the house.... Okay... that wasn't the truth.  There really are good times in between all that yelling, fighting, DEATH THREATS and good old fashioned whoop'ns!

      I don't know about you but I've always had a problem with guilt.  I've forever felt guilty at not being the perfect mother.  I'm 38 years old and am still trying to be Mrs. Brady!  It certainly doesn't help when a child expects things like big houses and cars for birthdays and college funds at graduation, etc.  There was a time when it was normal for the husband to work and the wife to stay home with the family.  When it was affordable to save for college and weddings and vacations and the like but it's coming to point where the average married couple (in my opinion) must both work outside the home and a savings account is a dream not reality.  This doesn't mean that those in their 30's still don't have some sort of complex about wishing they could do it all or have it all.  I'm sure there are those that didn't get pregnant when they were 17 and haven't gone through a divorce and their life is just peachy-keen, but for the rest of us who have struggled through financial hardships and bad choices, life just isn't what we dreamed it would be.  No matter what I do, no matter how much I try to be a great mom and do fun stuff with my kids and teach them right and all that is honorable and true, I still have this nagging feeling in my gut that tells me I'm a lousy parent.  After all, I don't have a college education waiting for them when they graduate (my oldest is working her fanny off with scholarships as we are writing this), I don't have a car for them when they turn 16 and I certainly don't have a clue how I'm going to pay for my two daughters when/if they decide to marry.  I can only pray that they decide to elope!  Truth be told, I don't have anything to offer them financially at all.  So, if financial stability is the bar to measure my motherly influence, I've failed miserably.  So, let's look at emotional stability then...  I've been married three times.  Yeah.  That's a good lesson for them to learn.  If at first you don't succeed, try, try, again!  The religious and for-family fanatics love telling how divorce is the number one killer in children's self esteem and emotional stability.  I really provided them with a good role model in that one, yes?   I failed at teaching them that happiness doesn't come in another person, it's from within.  If you can't find happiness within yourself, you will never find it with another person and that the first lesson in loving another is loving yourself.   Unfortunately, it's a little late in the game for me to try to teach them now.  This should have been something they learned at an early age and was raised seeing.  Then let's look at the mental stability factor, shall we?  I have migraines.  They are unpredictable and the medication leaves me mentally incapable of coherent thought and reasoning.  I have chunks of my life that are missing and/or slept away.  My time during a migraine is spent either drugged up or miserable in pain with nausea and frequent trips to the bathroom.  The medication leaves me groggy and steals my memory.  I'm slowly fading from my family's life.  I'm certainly not someone they can mentally count on if I'm in the throes of a migraine.  So what is there left?  Love.  Some would say that love is an emotion.  I disagree.  Love is an action.  Love is saying that no matter what you do or say, I'm going to love you.  To me, love is a verb.  I CAN offer this.  It really is the ONLY thing I have to give.  It's not only saying I love you but showing them that I'm there for them.  Yet when it boils down to it, love isn't always what YOU think but what the recipient thinks.  You see, no matter how much I KNOW I love my children, they may not think I do.  They may feel totally different.  Maybe they measure love based on financial security or emotional stability or even mental stability.  Maybe, just maybe saying I love you or hugging them isn't enough.   What then, does a mother do?  When she gives the only thing she has to give, and it isn't good enough?  I really don't know the answer to that.  That's the dark side of guilt, I suppose.  Because no matter how much I try, no matter how much I expend myself being the best I can be, it won't ever be good enough if the bar of my success as a mother isn't based on love alone.  If, when everything I do is based on the action of love and yet my actions aren't measured by that standard but instead on a different scale, I will forever be found lacking.  In this scenario, I will never be good enough, never measure up.  How does someone reconcile to this?  How does someone feel good about who they are and what they've done if their shortcomings are forever paraded in front of them?  What if they didn't even feel those shortcomings were a fault?   I certainly don't feel that a parent's measure of greatness is based on financial, emotional or mental stability although these are important aspects of a child's life.  Certainly, a child's well-being will be enhanced with these aspects present.  No, I've always felt that a child's most essential ingredient to a well-balanced and happy life is the involvement of love from a parent - preferably both parents.  So why is it, that I am forever walking the dark side of guilt?  Why do I constantly feel as if I'm not measuring up or not good enough?  I just don't know.  Why is it that I can stand on the outside of a situation and share these things and logically state all the obvious and yet when it comes to my own life and my own situation, I feel this hopeless since of guilt that I haven't done a good enough job with my own children?

      So my son and oldest daughter are sitting on the couch early in the morning seeing who can blow the biggest bubble with gum.  It's a HUGE competition and they are both competitive people.  So they are getting quite aggressive and blurting out different words and such on how big their bubbles are when  my son suddenly yells out something about bum bubbles.  Now, let me tell  you, this had the entire house laughing, especially when my grandson (who had been slurping away at his bottle) decided to release some gas and I reiterated that bum bubbles sure was a good word for it.  Then, I lift up my grandson to help him burp and his mother looks up and starts laughing that he is such a "man" with his plumber's crack showing!  Oh brother!  This gets us all laughing harder.  What a wonderful start to our trip to the Omaha Zoo.  Nate slept all the way there along with his grandma (coughs) and so the trip over was uneventful as far as I was concerned.  The zoo was fabulous, as usual.  Course, it's only the 2nd time I've ever been there.  But, it wasn't a disappointment.  The only thing is... it's too much for one day!  My favorite part was the underwater section.  I loved the penguins and sharks.  There was one in particular that had his eye on my son... kept following him around.  I told him he must have looked awfully appetizing.  He ended up taking home a stuffed shark as a reminder of his "little buddy".  Obviously he's never seen the movie JAWS!  All the sleep Nate had during the trip out and back and all during the day had the little guy up most the night and guess who got to take care of him?  Yep, you got it... GRANDMA!  Hehe.  I just love that little guy.  He's so adorable.

      There's a photo of a little girl around 7 or 8 wearing a blonde wig and staring forlornly out the window.  The feelings that rise up in me in looking at that picture bring about sadness and a feeling of deep loneliness.  I remember being that little girl and wondering where my mommy was going, if she was coming back and whether I would ever feel happy again.  I don't know what made me be such a sad little girl.  Not really.  But I remember thinking that if I put on her wig (she was a hairdresser and spent hours working on the wigs to create beautiful masterpieces) maybe she wouldn't feel so far away.  I grew up feeling alone and lonely which is rather odd since I come from a very large family.  I do know that it was never really anything that my family did wrong, it was more how I perceived things.  A family member once told me that I tended to keep to myself and that they didn't want to overstep my boundary.  It made me realize that somehow I'd created a wall around me that shouted STAY AWAY and not many people know how to get past it.  Then there's the fact that I don't know how to be any different.  I am a rather private person in some ways and yet completely open in others.  I suppose it's dependent upon what I CHOOSE to tell and what I am not willing to talk about.  Truth be told, I still feel like I'm that lost little girl at times but I'm not lonely or alone anymore.  I don't feel isolated or afraid.  I've come to appreciate and like where I am and those that have actually stuck with me through the long haul.  Those people that decided I was worth being friends with despite the wall and privacy issues.  Friends like Lynette (whom I've known for 25+ years), Brandie, Katie and Dave who finally got the ring on my finger, and believe it or not, Dennis (who knows me better than I'd prefer at times).  These people have believed in me, encouraged me, strengthened me (and, at times, some of them have even totally ticked me off too) and were there for me and are still for me when life throws me to the wolves.  It's to them that I run to for comfort and I know that I can depend on to be held.  Thanks for comforting this lost little girl!
