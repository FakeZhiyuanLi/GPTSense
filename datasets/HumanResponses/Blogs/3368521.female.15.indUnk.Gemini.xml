      So, i have just thought of a topic! Diets. So many young people go on diets because they are quite large. But, then once they hav become a reasonable weight, they still think they are fat and carry on dieting. Therefore becoming anorexic (sorry about the spelling). I think that every person is made as they should be, and dieting is a waste of time. people should be content with themselves though, because that is how they were meant to be. The peer pressure though is unbearable for teenagers like myself, and i personally think that it is all due to TV and magazines, though I do enjoy them loads!!!! Dancers are pressurised to be not too thin, but not too large and therfore have to be perfect which is almost impossible!  One of my friends at school thought up a funny diet which i think is erally clever. It goes along the lines of this!(i credit it to Rosanna)  1)any food stolen from another persons plate has no calorific value 2)food eaten during the preparation of food such as licking food off a spoon or a knife has no calorific value 3)foods that are the same colour have the same amount of calories, chocolate is a universal colour and contains no calories  there is more, but you can guess how it goes, n i cant remember them! This has been helped by Rosanna, and i thank her!!!!! I think it is a good diet to go by, except for the loadsa choc, not even i cud eat tht much chocolate, and i do eat a lot! laterz until i think of a weird subject to write about!
