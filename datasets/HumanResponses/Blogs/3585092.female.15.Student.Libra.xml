      today i have started my countdown. what am i counting down for u may ask? JaPaN! on the 24th of september i will be on a plane on my way to japan for 14 days! i can't believe it! while i'm there i will also be spending my first birthday away from home :) !!!!! i can say a few things in japanese, like " minasama, hajimemashite" that means " pleased to meet you" & "namae wa amelia desu" which is "my name is amelia" i can't wait! i'll be staying with a japanese family while i'm there, & i'm going with my friends stef, emily, possibly teil, corey, liz & a girl i knew from primary school called kim...not really that good friends with her but oh well... my friend emily has also started to organise a small club that will promote the trips to japan. itz run through an organisation called C.I.F.A, which acts as more of a charity program kuz the only way it gets its money is through ppls membership. this would be great kuz the more ppl who join the club, the better it is for C.I.F.A kuz they r sponsoring the club :) & then more ppl will go to japan :):):) so it's great for everyone.  eww...nearly vomitted just then....GROSS!  94 DAYS!

      my god!!! i must have the longest lasting mutated cold/cough/wateva the hell else i've been infected wif than anyone else i know! it started about 3 weeks ago when my friend joanne first got her sickness...i cought a slight cough from her but other than that it was fine. then my family started 2 get this stomach bug thing & for a while i was immune to it, that is of course until my lil sister coughed her god damn lungs out all over me! then my slight cough had turned into this fully grown mutated cough! i'd have cough attacks & wouldn't eat because my stomach hurt that much! then my friend julia cought & cold & ta dah! here am i am now sniffing & coughing. now yes it is just a cold but the point is i never get sick & i hate wat they have given me!  now onto a lighter note! today i'm gonna go watch the football with my friend julia & hopefully lee will be allowed to kum as well after the incident. then we're gonna go back 2 julia's place & watch hour after hour of scary movies while we stuff our faces with all sorts of foodz that are bad for us :):):):):) the last time julz & i went to the football i asked her if she would still be my friend if i had sum sort of mental disorder & she told me yes....i decided to put her to the test. so i grabbed the newspaper next to me & rapped it around myself & then tore a piece off & started to eat all while i was screaming out 2 one of the players "hey jason baby do you love me?" she ended up moving half a dozen seats away & just looked at me...but even after this embarrassing show she is still talking to me...so all in all my test worked & yes, even if i was mentally insane she would still be friends with me :)   *p.s: sorry bout the pesimistic blogs lately...i have alot going on...but that can wait for another entry

      sat in health 2day, had a teacher tell us 2 write down a positive note on life...i couldnt help but laugh out loud wats the big thing about life though?? it isnt all that great...i mean u have parents who bug the shit outta u tellin u wat do or wat to be, peers who, even if it was only once, don't ever let you forget your faults or mistakes, stupid ppl who tease you or ppl you know for how they may look, the clothes they wear, the ppl they like or even for no reason @ all...who wants to live in a world like that?! then we are always told on what's the kewl thing...god damnit i'd rather be dead than kewl! who wants to accepted (not liked but just accepted) by ego-dolls who will do whatever the knew "in-thing" is?! everyone knows that they don';t even like each other! they sit there bitchin bout everyone (including their so called "friends") because they aren't like them! who wants that?! i'm just tired of life & everything in it

        laying there contempt with your surroundings your unaware of people like me the blessed ones that pass you by  are the only ones that you wish see don't bother to look further inside the illusion is all you know let the mind be controlled and satisfied by what dillusive eyes do show no need to look for scars or bruises you have no care for those and mesmerized by beauty you continue the life you've chose hope you soon will see the darkness shadowing all means hope you open your eyes before your swallowed by the dream   steal this poem & ur dead
