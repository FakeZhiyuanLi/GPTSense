       Here it is ladies and gentlemen, the first installment of  Movies that don't suck!   So I'm rumaging through the junk my cable company likes to refer to as "channels" when I happen upon a little drama called  The Shipping News . Now I'm a Kevin Spacey fan and he was the star so I figured what the hell. Man, what a great movie! Now you have to like dramas, and there's no action whatsoever, unless you count walking along the frigid Newfoundland coastline during winter, action. However, the movie somehow manages to make you give a shit about this guy, played by Kevin Spacey. He's a desperate idiot who manages to latch on to this hyper bitch named Petal. Yeah, you heard right, Petal. I mean who in their right mind would even date a chick named Petal. Its like those guys who break the fucking surface ice on lakes at 6am to jump in and swim and then wonder why they catch fucking pneumonia! Anywho, I digress. The poor bastard manages to get Petal pregnant, and wammo bammo a little girl is born.    Now we skip forward a ways. Petal lives in her own bedroom, pause for dramatic effect, ...her OWN bedroom! On top of that, her own daughter calls her Petal, not mom. I tell you what, if I ever have a kid and he or she calls me Chris or Christopher instead of dad, daddy, father, or even fuckhead in a moment of stupidity, I swear I would.... Where the hell was I anyway? Oh, Petal runs off and leaves the guy and his little girl, big fucking surprise you twit, but it gets us to the meat of the movie. You see the guy has some roots in this Newfoundland town. So he goes there thinking to get his shit together once and for all. There he meets this rough old bag he is related to and starts down the road to not being a dipshit. Seriously though, this is a damn nice movie with beautiful acting by all and a great message that I can relate too. Here it is, "Even an unlucky dipshit can find his place in the world, and it might not be so bad once he does."  Thanks for putting up with me, I'm you host Spanky Yankmaster, er... Christopher Arthur.

       I sold my Magic Online collection yesterday. For those who don't know what that is it is an online version of the popular TCG Magic: The Gathering made by  urlLink Wizards of the coast . It has been plagued by glitches since the introduction of version 2.0. It sucks too because I really enjoyed playing it. Oh, well, just goes to show kiddies, if you make a good game and then administer it like a bunch of trained monkeys you get what you deserve. I had a bit of a problem with one of the online administrators so I reported it to the powers that be. They answered and basically said, "Sorry, our administrators are gods and you suck.". So I dropped them like a rock, since I can't drop a bad habit.

       I suppose I should introduce myself in this first post. My name is Christopher Arthur, but if you looked left you already knew that. I'd like to welcome you to my blog, my first blog. In case you're wondering I love Spiderman. Always have, always will. I loved him through the clone saga and through the death of the Green Goblin. So you can imagine how happy I was when Sam Raimi made the first movie. Then multiply that happiness times 500 when I actually saw the movie, and it was excellent! Therefore I chose this template from the official movie site, link on the left.   I am currently employed at Wright State University in Dayton, Ohio. I like working here, but I really want to be doing something else. I have always been interested in fringe hobbies like RPGs, comics, miniatures gaming, and video games. I would really like to be involved with them instead of what I am doing. So imagine my pleasure when I found out that a local game shop, Howling Wolf Studio, might be hiring programmers! It turns out that they are not quite ready for that level of commitment, but they did offer me a little project by project work. I'm still waiting to hear from them about the particulars of it.

       What a crappy day. I had to have my PC upgraded to Winblows XP from Winblows 2000 and it required wiping my hard drive and installing from scratch. Thank you Macroshaft! This of course meant that my entire programming environment was shot to hell and left for dead. So for the last 2 days I've been fending off rabid supervisors who absolutely positively cannot wait another fucking minute for the shit they want. Good God in heaven! Let me spell this one out for those 3 people who may actually read this:  I H-A-T-E M-Y F-U-C-K-I-N-G J-O-B!  That's all I'm really trying to say. It reminds me of my favorite Weird Al song, Albequerque. To quote, "Keep your tray table up, and your seat in the full upright position". Life is a bitch, good thing I got my helmet at a young age! Oh, well, what do you care anyway. So have a nice fucking day, and don't forget to bend over so they can get the rod up there easier!

       It's time for the first installment of  Wednesday Night TV Reviews!   On Wednesday nights I like to watch Smallville and Angel on my local WB station. I enjoy both shows greatly, but occasionally one or the other or both are a bit off their game. Such was  NOT  the case in last night's episodes. Smallville introduced us to a high school kid who could see the death of anyone he touched. When he touched Lana for instance, he saw her on her death bed as a old woman with a devoted man standing next to her. As the vision went on we see her pass on peacefully. However, this is Smallville after all. Not everyone in Smallville is so lucky as to have such a peaceful death. The coolest part of the show is when the poor tortured kid touches Clark Kent, the future Man of Tomorrow himself. The image is of the wind fluttering a red cape with a large, and highly familiar, 'S' printed on it. Nothing else makes much sense, but as the kid articulates, "Its like you have no end. Like you go on forever.", or something to that effect. The entire episode is, IMHO, very well written and executed. I continue to be impressed with the growing acting abilities of Tom Welling as well as the incredible peformances turned in routinely by John Schneider and Michael Rosembaum. Watch for the heart wrenching final scene hinted at in the promos for this episode.     Now what kind of introverted uber-geek genre fanatic would I be if I didn't watch Angel? I was interrupted during Angel this week by a very important conversation with a good friend, yes I do have a few of those. I caught bits and pieces if the first half and then saw the remaining half after the phone call. Wow, does Charisma Carpenter look good after her pregnancy or what!!? Unfortunately, she is only guest starring in this episode and as those of you who have seen it know, she won't be returning. Charisma has decided to spend time in mommyville for awhile. Hey, not enough people take parenting seriously so I say good on ya! The story was beautiful. Surprise! The big bad ain't who ya thought it was, but I have to admit I like Lindsay as a bad guy. The actor who plays him is great and the fight scene with Angel was inspired. I felt like I was watching a good Hong Kong martial arts movie with all the kick ass wire work. Yes! Anyway, the episode was the best I've seen in a while. Hate to see ya go Cordy, but all the luck I can send your way Charisma. The big question is, "What's next?", I guess we'll see.    So I give both Angel and Smallville 4 1/2 stars out of 5. They were great, but they've both been greater. Here's to a bold fashion statement for Clark and a warm heartbeat for Angel, till next time, Goodbye!

       Just thought I'd check in today and let you all know I'm alive and well. I just found out my tax return is gonna be much larger than I thought! Yeeha, baby! Gotta love it when things work in your favor. God knows it happens so infrequently in these days of war.    Valentine's Day is this Saturday and I have absolutely no idea what to do for my wife. Its hard because her birthday is March 2 nd  so... I think I may just try to take her out for dinner someplace nice. Well, anywho, I guess that's all from the wonderfully purplexed mind of your favorite chowderhead. So I hope whomever reads this has a good day and leaves the bitching to me. God, knows I've gotten good at it.

       Its rough, but its there. I've had a story rumbling in my head for quite some time now. So there's the first scene. Its a thriller/horror with some other slashes thrown in for fun. Hopefully I'll write some more later.

       The headaches were becoming more frequent since that day in the park. Apirin was a joke to them. It took away the stabbing of the pain, but left the dull agony like someone bashing his head with a lead pipe. There was nothing for it but sleep now. Sleep always made the pain go. He washed his face with cold water and brushed his teeth, but he moved to quickly standing up from the sink. A throbbing began behind his eyes like a raging beast trying to escape the confines of his skull. He staggered from the blinding white out of it. Slowly he regained his composure and slid into his sheets. They were cold and inviting, just the way he liked them, but he could not enjoy their luxury. He closed his eyes and sleep pounced upon him.   He was awake suddenly! Images jumbled in his groggy consciousness. The moon full like tonight. A girl, fourteen maybe fifteen. A cornfield. The dark figure of a man. Oh, God! What had he done to her! The tears welled up as his mind began to sort the collage of frightening images. He gagged at what he saw. Tonight's pizza began to seem like a mistake. The smell of sweet perfume, fruity in the midnight air. It mingled with the earthy scent of corn growing in a field. He saw the breath of the figure silouetted against the moon. He stood over the girl like a promise of evil, and a smile crept across his face.   The lurching in his stomache became uncontrollable as he emptied it on the floor. The screams! Oh, God, he retched again, but nothing was left. It felt like he would spew out his stomache to quiet the images. The blood! He ran to the bathroom slipping on his own vomit. He lay prone in a puddle of his own internal juices and let the tears come. What kind of sick twisted bastard dreams that kind of thing! He could still smell the corn. He could feel her skin as the figure... Jesus! The thoughts became incoherent again as he wept openly and uncontrollably. In the back of his mind a thought took form. He had felt what the figure felt. Arousal, pleasure. Oh, God.   Meanwhile, as the moon looked down on Troy, Ohio, thirty miles from where Jason McKeever lay weeping, a dark figure slowly dug a hole just deep enough for a petite fourteen year old girl. As he finished his job, he slowly raised his head to the moon, and in a rough voice whipsered, "The watcher has awoken. Too bad." Methodically he went on with his task, and in a cornfield just ouside of Troy, terror had been born.

       Back in the day, in high school at the fabulous South High School in scenic Springfield, Ohio, damn I can't seem to find the  &lt;sarcasm&gt;  tag. Oh, well. I always dreamt of being an author like J. R. R. Tolkien, Stephen King, Peter Straub, or Arthur C. Clarke, but I just never seem to have the time to really sit down and write. It really gets to me every once in a while which is, of course, why I'm writing it here. I had the most incredible daydreams of a hardback novel with an illustration by  urlLink Michael Whelan  and my name plastered on the cover. Oh, man, it sends tingles down my spine and brings tears to my eyes.   These days I just can't seem to do much of anything. I always seem to be tired and restless at the same time. I was watching TV the other day and I saw some kind of info show about sleep apnea. I seem to have more than my share of the same symptoms so I'm going to go see my doctor in a week or two. Let's hope it's treatable.   The friend I mentioned having a phone conversation with during Angel last week was at my house last night. We've been friends for something like eleven years now. Amazing, God, I'm starting to feel old. Once upon a time I wanted to start a hobby gaming shop with him, his name is Jason, and another friend of mine, Shane. None of us ever seemed to have the startup capital available to us though. Then there's  urlLink Howling Wolf Studio , a hobby gaming shop that has a store in London, Ohio and now in Swingfield as well. The place is great! That means that we wouldn't stand much of a chance in this area though. Not much room in that market for competition.   I can hear you all wondering, "What kind of stuff does he write, anyway?" Well the short answer is speculative fiction. I don't like the pigeonholing of science-fiction or fantasy. I like to write whatever the hell I want into my stories. If you've ever read  Running with the Demon  by Terry Brooks, you've got the idea of what I like to write. Mixing elements of fantasy and sci-fi right along with everyday things paints a much more vivid picture in my mind than writing about some arbitrary world I made up and drew a map to illustrate. Don't get me wrong, though. I'm a sucker for a good map in a fantasy novel. I love Terry Brooks, J. R. R. Tolkien, Tad Williams, George R. R. Martin, and, to some extent, Robert Jordan. At the moment I'm reading Terry Brooks' new Shannara book while I salivate over the release of  A Feast for Crows , the latest in  A Song of Ice and Fire , by George R. R. Martin. Not to mention, like most of the fantasy fans in the world, I am also ponderously sloughing through  The Wheel of Time  series by Robert Jordan.    Well, I suppose I should get back to the job that pays the bills,... barely. So, until next time... goodbye.

       My wife wants a dog for her birthday. I love dogs so I thought I'd go ahead and get her one. We went to the petstore at the mall the other day, I know, I know, I see you make the sign of the cross at the screen after reading, mall pet store, but hey I live in Bum Fuck Egypt. We got what we got. We looked at this awesome little pup, God, she was cute. She was a Shih-tsu Bichon. Unfortunately we didn't have the money to buy a dog quite yet. Waiting on my tax return for that. I get to upgrade my horrendous piece of shit computer too, whoopee!   I've been trying to get this job programming for a local hobby gaming company called Howling Wolf Studio. I hadn't heard anything back from their Corporate guy for weeks so I called yesterday. It sounds like I may have some part time work! Hopefully it will roll over into something permanent. I'm really tired of my current job and want to make a change, but these damn glass shards keep slowing me down.   Don't forget to tune in tomorrow for Wednesday night reviews! Thanks for loaning me your eyeballs, till next time,... goodbye!

       I sit at my computer and read today's entry into Wil Wheaton's blog and I begin to ponder the deeper questions of life. Things like, "What did happen to Wesley Crusher after he left the Enterprise?" Seriously, though, I find myself at a point in my life where I want more than I have, but find the way to get what I want paved with large shards of glass. Evey step I take is painful and I'm losing blood as I go.   If you've ever read Wil's blog and surfed the site a bit you've seen the page of wishes he put up. So here are some of my wishes for my life:      Write a book  - I know Wil had this one too, but its true, so...    Work from home doing something fun  - obviously, if I was writer this would be granted as well    Be involved in a good sci-fi movie  - acting, writing, cutting wood...I don't care    Meet Arthur C. Clarke    Meet Chef Emeril Lagasse    Meet Tad Williams  - I've traded a few emails with Tad, but I'd really like to meet him. Seems like a cool guy    Meet Wil Wheaton       Well, there we are. Maybe I'll get lucky and Darkly by Moonlight will evolve into the novel I wish it could be.   I stayed up late last night to watch  Final Destination 2 . What a mistake. Not the movie of course, the staying up late watching it. The movie was ok I guess. I mean if you believe that people just pretty much explode whenever anything hits them or crushes them. There's this one scene... SPOILER ALERT ... where this fifteen yeear old kid gets crushed by a plexiglass window at a constuction site and he just explodes. I mean he basically just falls apart, which is, of course, bullshit. The human body is much more resilient than that. Oh, well, the movie basically makes up for the lack of ...um, ... well, anything by applying gore in ample amounts. Oh, but make sure you watch the begining to see some random chick's tits. I mean she isn't even the star, and their really nothing to write home about, but they are definitely a high point in this flick. I give it 1 1/2 stars with the extra 1/2 for having the audacity to show tits for absolutely no reason whatsoever.

       So its time once again for the Wednesday Night Geek Club to convene! Last night we had a brand spanking new, and in the case of Smallville spanking is the correct term, episode of both Smallville  and  Angel! I love that. So without further ado, here is my take on the Smallville episode I like to call Spankville!   Tom Welling once again shows his progress in growth as an actor. He has a couple of scenes unlike anything he has done on Smallville as yet. In one scene he is "gettin' jiggy with" the very cute girl he met up with on a field trip tour of Luthorcorp headquarters in Metropolis when his father walks in on them. Oops! Tom has the best jaw dropped surprised deer in headlights look I've seen in a long damn time. It was beautiful to see Clark Kent so out of sorts. Its also the scene that earns this episode the nickname, "Spankville".   Other than a tad bit of character development this episode is the typical Smallville of the first and second season where a meteor rock powered bad person threatens Clark and the inhabitants of Smallville. Eventually, of course, Clark saves the day. I mean he will eventually have the big "S" on his chest after all. The funny part is that the actors portray their parts so well, and the scripts are so well written that even though the episodes are formulaic you can't seem to be upset at the repetativeness. I still jones for smallville around Sunday every week. Ah, behold the power of good writing! Oh, and for my male readership I should mention that Clarks love interest in this episode is a bit the hottie. She is cute and sexy in a strange sort of way that seems to have something to do with her smile.   Around 400 years ago a very pretty vampire named Darla sired the epitome of evil in this world. His nom de plum was Angelus and he was  bad , but while trying to have a snack one night he was cursed by a gypsy. Now he fights the good fight against others like him as Angel, the vampire with a soul! I am such a fucking geek, I swear. Is this show the greatest thing on the air or what?! I mean hotties, ass kickin', hotties kickin' ass, and did I mention hotties? This episode adds a new one to the mix, or rather it re-introduces us to a previous hottie. You remember the werewolf girl Angel helped a few episodes back. So Angel gets stuck trying to figure out how a bunch of kids are being sucked of their life force. He goes to the television network's offices where he runs into a giant egg, yep I said egg, which turn him into a puppet. A puppet. I mean a muppet looking made of felt, puppet. Angel, the vampire here (its much funnier if you hear me say it with Kermit the frog's voice, I swear)! Oddly, even with the funky puppet, is that a dance, premise, the episode works well. Angel ends up with a date and the end...oh, yes the end. You know its a beautiful thing when something pays off that's been running for a long time in a series and last night something major finally paid off. I won't tell you what happened, but if you see previews for next week's show, you'll figure it out.   Well that's that I guess. Tune in next week when I take my monthly shower and sing rubber ducky!

       I know, I know. I haven't posted here in like 7 days! I'd like to give a good excuse, but the only one I have is that I've been busy and a bit lazy. I know I suck, but like 3 people might actually be reading this anyway.   So I emailed the guy I've been trying to get a part-time job from. He hasn't called me or emailed me to let me know anything so I dropped him an email today to jumpstart his engine. I don't see how anything gets done over there at all. I've seen snails with more fire in their asses!   I think maybe its time for another installment of  Wednesday Night Reviews  'cause its such a witty and creative name! Check my next post for it.

       My wife started watching MTV obsessively here recently. She's always been a music fan, but we fell into this kind of lull where we didn't really do that much. She came out of and began watching MTV again. What I don't get is that its still called MTV even though they don't seem to play any   music fucking videos   anymore! Oh, and the 4 videos they do play, they play over and over and over and over, ad infinitum. That's right folks, its so maddening that I busted out the high school latin.   So our friend, Jason, was over a few weeks back and we happened to catch music on MTV instead of Newlyweds and Newlyweds Dark, when this crazy video comes on that sounds and looks like Queen had kids. Now anyone who knows me also knows that I  love  Queen. So anything that seems remotely condescending to the image or sound of the band makes me angry. I thought that the band, The Darkness, was poking fun at the over the top antics Queen used to display on stage and in their videos. After a little research on the internet, I found that this is not the case. So, finally, after some angry time I can sit back and enjoy the video. I mean I'll get to see it like 6 times a day, and since MTV only has videos on 4 hours out of any given day...

       I don't know if I've ever mentioned it, but I like to read Wil Wheaton's blog. Not just because he is the champion of the geek, but because I truly enjoy it and find that I tend to agree with him more often than not. Today, I agree with him emphatically. This whole gay marriage situation has me pissed off. I mean, just who does the President think he is anyway? This is the United States of America not some third world country ruled by a pissant dictator. Who is  he  to tell me or anyone else that I can't marry a man if I damn well want to. Good God, what the hell is happening to the world when the President of the United States pays more attention to some innocent citizens getting married than to the men and women he sent to Iraq dying on a daily basis. I have only one thing to say to you Mr. Bush, that's how you'll be addressed come November,  KISS MY ASS , and stay out of my personal life!   Wil Wheaton tends to be a bit more expressive than I, so  urlLink here's the link  to his take on this mess. God, I'm angry today. I mean, I'm not even gay and this pisses me off to no end. We're willing to accept a party machine frat boy in the highest office in the land, but a few harmless homosexuals will end society as we know it. Makes me want to smash something!

       I'm sorry about the lapses in updates to my blog. The last lapse was due to an overabundance of malaise which kept me glued to the couch. This last lapse in due to something much more sinister and sad. My wife has a birthday coming up on March 2 nd  and she had asked for a puppy. She had always had sogs as a kid, but none of them was actually hers. They were family pets that didn't belong directly to her. So she wanted a puppy to call her own. Truth be told I've wanted a cute little canine for myself since my first dog, Fluffy, was heinously taken from me due to the deprecations of the dastardly bitch queen and her hench-younguns. The full story reserved for publication at a later date.   So after my eye doctor appointment this last Friday we went out to the illustrious Clark County Humane Society to see what they had. What they had was the cutest little shepard mix pup we'd ever seen. He was brown with black muzzle markings and those personality melting liquid brown eyes that puppies are infamous for having. My wife couldn't resist his nefarious charms and, frankly, neither could I. We were lost in the grip of the "puppy". God, I love that feeling. Anyone who knows me will tell you that I have a special place in my heart for just about any animal and the animals know it. Dogs and cats take to me as if I were one of them, a fact I revel in daily.   Saturday became a giddy place with endless fields and a burbling brook where a boy and his puppy can run forever. I know it was Heather's puppy, but he was a great little guy. Heather named him Rama. By now you've probably realized that I keep referring to Rama in the past tense. Parvo. It seems like a harmless enough collection of vowels and consonants, but its meaning to dogs and their owners is profound. Its a virus with symptoms much like the flu. Its deadly, and hard to treat. Treatment involves five days in a cage with an IV drip. All that for a 50/50 chance to live. I have to wonder what fucked up thing I did that my kharma could be so goddamned bad that a puppy had to die. I've seen enough death in my thirty-three years, I don't want to see any more. I hate death. Its a filthy bastard with jagged teeth and an insatiable appetite.   FUCK HIM  !   I suppose you can see that I'm upset. My wife was, and is, worse yet. I guess I have to stop, the screen is getting blurry and I feel like smashing something. Until the filthy bastartd takes me, I'll be here.

       Here we are once again with  Wednesday Night TV Reviews !   Smallville has begun to up the ante once again as Lex begins to delve into his father's top secret endeavors. Eventually this will bring him face to face with Clark Kent and his wonderous secrets once again. I have to gush a bit here because I really like Michael Rosenbaum and damn if he doesn't get better and better on this show. Speaking of better, Tom Welling turns in another performance with flawless facial expressions. At one point in the show Clark is forced to lie to Lana and Tom Welling's face tells the tale perfectly. If you couldn't see that the normally straight laced Clark is lying in this scene you'd have to be from Mars and not accustomed to human mannerisms. The story in this episode is obviously a lead in to a story arc which has been hinted at in previous episodes. Clarks blood is being used to bring back the dead and Lex is on the trail of his father's secret experiments. To top it all off, Clark finds out it is  his  blood doing the deed, and while he isn't happy about the circumstances, he can't deny the benefit to mankind. This is the kind of quandry that makes this show worth an hour of your time every week. The future Man of Steel is here today in the person of Clark Kent. The show brings out the nuances of Kal El's personality in ways the movies could only drool about. I feel I should be clear here,  WATCH THIS SHOW  you won't regret it. Trust me, would I lie to you?   On to the second best hour of television on Wednesday night, Angel. Last night's episode found our gang in a pretty nasty bind. Fred, everyone's favorite overly-cute-but-still-somehow-sexy brain has become infected with a particularly virulant parasite. Now the shit hits the fan as all the boys kick ass and take names to find the cure. Watch for Lorne kicking the piss out of Eve, that scene alone was worth my time. This episode is what is good about Angel. Gripping, suspenseful, and with payoffs galore. By the end you'll be screaming and ripping out your hair due to the nastiest plot twists this show has seen in quite a while. SPOILER ALERT, normally I try to not give spoilers but this is one I have to include. Fred dies. There I said it. Yep, she dies, and in her place comes a bad ass demon. Life is horrible. Poor Wesley, he can't seem to win. First he pisses off his best friend by stealing his son and delivering him to his greatest foe, now he finally gets the girl he loves more than books and poof, instance demon. Fred's body is still around, though, so you never know.   Until next time, goodbye. Oh, and even though it really isn't geeky in any way, watch Gilmore Girls. Its an incredibly good show. You'll be absolutely amazed that you like it, but you won't want to ever change the channel!

       After years of speculation and fan fury, Peter Jackson has not only brought the greatest fantasy epic ever written to the big screen, but he also managed to win the big prize! On Oscar night he took 11 of the gilded statuettes home to New Zealand. This tied the record for the most Oscars taken by one picture and firmly planted Jackson in the cash cow box of movie directors. The films have brought in $3 billion worldwide, yes I said BILLION. New Line is laughing it ass to the bank while pointing at Disney who scoffed at the idea and shopped the films to a new studio, OOOPS!   Michael Eisner is a moron, welcome to losing your job soon Mike. Between this and the whole Pixar contract debacle, Mike is sure to be out, and I say good riddance to bad rubbish! Maybe without him Disney can become the place we all remember. A place where smiles are more important than the bottom line.   How about that Sean Penn guy! Finally winning the Oscar I feel he's deserved for years. After four nominations he walked away with the brass ring. Good on ya, mate! Let's see you match that win soon. That's the thing about winning an Academy Award, once you do it you strive to do it again, and that means more kick ass acting for fans like me to enjoy! God I love the movies!   Oh, and how about that Charlize Theron. Wow! From one extreme to the next. In monster you can barely recognize her. She's downright nasty in that movie, and then she shows up at the Oscars looking like the poster child for pretty. Unbelievable. I haven't had the pleasure of seeing the movie, but some critics I respect and tend to agree with say it was great. Obviously Charlize Theron gave an awesome performance.   This is where I have to say my peace. I love that Bill Murray was nominated and that Tim Robbins won, but I feel that someone or several someones were left out. Sean Astin gives one of the best performances I've ever seen as Samwise Gamgee and we won't even talk about Vigo Mortensen as Aragorn. Good, Lord, but that man is good. He was good before that role and now people will notice. Here's to seein' ya at a future award's show collecting for best actor, Viggo! And to Sean Astin as well.   Well, I think I'll stop it here. Till next time, goodbye.

       I just spent 3 hours configuring my programming environment so that I can run 2 things together which should have been designed to work together in the first place. I should explain the office and how things work, or more directly to the point,  don't  work. My boss is the Assistant Director of the department I work in, she is the supervisor of all the IT developers whether they be COBOL or Java people. Directly under her is a guy whose new job is guiding our efforts at complete system changeover to SCT. His old job was kind of a facilitator and DBA. Also under my boss are all the other developers and I. I answer to 3 people who are the project leads for 3 different ongoing projects. Once upon a time in the good ol' days these project had synergy. They are all web application projects. Each one serves a slightly different purpose. One of them is a student oriented set of small services, did I mention I work at a university? Another is a similar set used for faculty and staff. Then the last one is an administrative set of services.   When we started all this out 4 years ago, I was hired for my experience in Java. Everyone else that works on the projects is from a COBOL background. I started off by saying we needed a set of internal standards to guide our development. Basically I wanted a set of architectural guidelines to keep us all on the straight and narrow. For those of you who are non-programmers, what I mean by architectural is how we put the code together to do what we want. There are a plethora of correct ways to build a modern piece of software. Object oriented programming is like putting together a building by sticking blocks that do certain things together. This block may have a door and another has the stove. It doesn't matter where the stove is as long as it works. Same idea with Java.   Rut ro, Raggy. Looks like I got off my point a bit. I guess all I'm really saying is that if they would have listened to me I could have been doing something productive for the last 3 hours instead of trying to make everything work together like it should anyway. Its like this with every new project too. Each one has this little glitch that takes up my time because some crappy piece of code is buried down in the annals of object land. Makes me want to scream some days.   Today is my wife's birthday. Thanks to what happened with her puppy, her birthday is guarenteed to suck. I wish there was something I could do, but how do you make up for what happened? I realize that I'm being awfully vague about the puppy thing, but I didn't want to mention what happened again. My wife occasionally reads this and I don't want her getting even more upset.   Once, I wanted to become a writer. An author. I wanted to write fantasy/science fiction novels that would catch the wonder of people everywhere. Now I just want to do something other than what I do currently. I miss writing. I used to write constantly in High School, but I stopped in college because I was so busy. Now I want to start up again, but I don't know if I'm any good. Probably not. Oh, well, maybe I'll get lucky and happen into something great.   Stick a fork in me, guys,...I'm done.

       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The World Wall stretched out before him. An impenetrable mountain range formed at the end of the Great Wars by the dark god himself. Unfortunately, the dark god had been enraged by the breaking of his armies and the chaos which had ensued. He had been so close to winning the world once and for all that even the elves had given up hope. In the last days of the Final War the evil armies of the dark god had given in to their base desires. The chaos they unleashed was not what the evil lord wanted. His dreams of ruling the world of Allyria were shattered. In his rage he decided if he couldn't rule the world he would simple destroy it. Fool.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lord Robilar had been the dark god's chief general in the Final War. He had watched the evil armies swarming across the lands of his fellow humans as well as the elves, halflings, and even the dwarves. The world of Allyria had trembled with the marching of hundreds of thousands of twisted souls. Fire and ash were all they had left in their wake, and death marched with them in their unending slaughter. Robilar had always be a bit reserved, but when the blood began to flow he secretly reveled in it! The rush was unlike anything he had ever felt. Even the tender carresses of a beautiful woman paled in comparison. During those wonderful days he had been given the name he now possessed among his followers, the Red Lord. Oh, how he missed those days!  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the dark god had realized the folly of his armies he had been incensed. He released plagues to put them back on track, but like the Red Lord could have told him, no matter what organization an orc belongs too, at the end of the day, it is still an orc. Rape, pillage, plunder. These are the only words an orc understands, or cares to learn. When the plagues didn't work the evil one simply shattered the world. Robilar had been there when the god's fist struck the ground at Kathur Field. It had taken the application of all his power to withstand the shock as the earth split and the world broke. The chaos of that day was indescribable.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lord Robilar had awakened to find a broken Allyria. His beloved world had been shattered by the fist of the dark god. He found himself trapped behind the World Wall with the remnants of his army. The World Wall. Back then it had no name. The first of the dwarves his men had encountered had related their name for the new mountain range. They had revealed to him that the mountains went on for thousands of miles, thousands! He could never march an army through that! To the north lie the Boiling Sea where the dark god raged and caused the waters to boil. To the west and south lie one of the great rifts, so wide the other side could not be seen. To the east, the World Wall. He was trapped like an animal. His desire to rule would have to be satiated by this horrid piece of sun blasted desert he found himself locked within. He was rightly and truly trapped, but if he ever escaped...

       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I talked with Joel over at White Tiger Inc. a company located in London, Ohio. He is the resident computer guy over there and lo and behold, I get to prove myself for a part-time job. You may be asking why I want to work for these guys so badly. Well the truth of the matter is very simple, I like the way the man who owns the company does business. Simple, straightforward, and with flare. George, the man at the top of the totem pole, is a regular guy with his paws into everything. Music, movies, gaming, even pet supply. The gaming aspect of his suite of companies is what drew me to the place to start. There are several business ventures all run out of White Tiger Inc.'s modest one floored set of offices. There's Howling Wolf Studio, a gaming shop, White Tiger Inc., a screen printing shop, a sign making shop, a pet supply store, and soon to be others. George is a one stop proprietor.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Presently the computer services are being developed by one man, Joel Brown. In our initial meeting I found that I kind of like Joel. He's easy to get along with and personable. I actually have a bit of trouble with first meetings. I often don't feel comfortable with people right away. To top it all off, I was wearing a shirt and tie in what was obviously a casual environment. Ce la vie. I could see from the decor that I really want to be one of the staff there. Now comes the long and grueling part where I get to prove myself and get up to speed on the software Joel uses, Filemaker Pro.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hopefully I can make myself indespensable to Joel and the others and secure my place at the watering hole in White Tiger. I sincerly hope so. I sorely want to work for a company I can believe in, where my coworkers don't stare at me blank faced when I comment on how ridiculous it is that Frank Castle wear a black shirt with a stark white skull on it. I mean it would so stick out like a sore thumb. Not to mention when I ask for the day off to go see the new Spiderman movie! To guys like me things like that are   events   not just movies. We go rent the first one and watch it right before we go to the theater. We're the glassy eyed guys staring into space mumbling incoherently about how that's exactly how Doc Ock should look after the movie.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wanna go into work and bust my ass while joking with everyone about last nights episode of Smallville, the best show on TV. I want my employee discount so I can get another Blood Angels Predator and a new Rhino for my Death Company squad! I want to be feared throughout space as the fiercest Blood Angels army in 10 parsecs! I want the Empire of Iuz to tremble at my approach and the wizards of Thay to dread my foul name. I want Doctor Doom, Spiderman, and Reed Richards in my living room. Oh, yeah, and I want it all to be part of my   job  !!!

       Sometimes I get down, just like anyone else. I think about my life and where I wanted to be when I hit 33 and to tell the truth it isn't here. I have a great personal life except for the lack of friends at this point, but I have a wife that I love and three cats that are fun. This is a great time to be a fantasy/science fiction fan, and gaming always cheers me up. The problem is my professional life. Back in high school at the famed and glorious, sarcasm of course, South High School in picturesque, sarcasm again folks, Springfield, Ohio, I had dreams. I wanted to write. I wanted to find a career involving the great loves of my teenage wasteland of a life. I wanted to do anything which got me the hell out of south side Springfield! Natives will understand.   What I really wanted, and still want to this day, was to be an author. To write books of imagination and wonder. I wanted people to quote my name as their inspiration for whatever. I wanted to work as my own boss, doing what I want when I want. None of that has come about, but I still hope for it all. I got out of south side Springfield even if I still haunt the town on and off.   So what's really wrong, you may ask, and rightly so. I have a wife I love and who loves me. I make $40k dollars a year, not a mint, but respectable. I have had wonderous friends. So what is it that sucks? My job. Simple, isn't it. It never ceases to amaze me how a job can ruin your life. No matter how good things get, the wrong job can make it all taste bitter somehow. So, naturally I fight back. I try to get other jobs, but thanks to inaction on the part of our current President, my jobs are increasingly shipped to places like India. I like India, I think its an incredibly rich nation with an interesting history and varied cultures. The artwork and religous symbology is phenomenal, but I want my fucking job opportunities back, damn it!   I'm rambling about mostly nothing, I know. Its just that I was hoping against hope that this thing with White Tiger would take me away from the world of student data and dumb ass managers who don't have a fucking clue what's going on in the real world! Well, maybe ther is a chance that might still happen, but its not overly likely. White Tiger probably doesn't have enough cash flow to maintain both Joel and I, we're expensive. Obviously, as evidenced by this blog, I still dream the dream of the wordsmith. Hell, maybe I'll get published eventually, who knows.   Thanks for indulging me in a brief foray into the wilds of my consciousness, until next time...

       Sweet! I was on the way in to work this morning when I heard none other than Verne Yip from Trading Spaces in an interview with a local radio station! He's here in Dayton for our Home and Garden show, but he announced that this is his fourth and   final   season with Trading Spaces. He taped about six episodes. For those of you getting ready to cry, don't, you see Verne is about to become much  more  visible than he was on Trading Spaces. Drumroll please...   Verne has been tapped to be on NBC's new show called Design Intervention! It will air soon and is still taking applications for homeowners to participate! The show will design entire homes instead of just one room, and with Verne doing the designs you know the show will be a hit. So make sure to watch and tell your friends about it too.   On a more sombre note, I'd like to take this time and webspace to observe a moment of silence for the tragedy which has unfolded in Spain. For those of you who haven't been following the news several bombs erupted on their train system killing hundreds of people and wounding even more. The scale of the attacks was not quite as large as 9/11, but the results are just as devestating and my prayers are with the survivers and the families of the less fortunate.  &lt;insert silence for however long you think is appropriate here&gt;    Once again, I am your neighbor, till next time...goodbye.

       It's just sad. While our troops are caught in the middle of a neverending fight against terrorism what are we doing here at home? We're fighting over whether gay couples have the right to marry, that's what. In a throwback decision which reminds me that some people are permenently stuck in the stone age the California supreme court has suspended gay marriages in San Francisco. I just don't get it. From a christian standpoint I...still just don't fucking get it! I'm christian, but I find it hard to believe that God would hold something against someone which could not be helped. I mean its the height of idiocy to believe that someone would  choose  to go through hell on a daily basis, but that's exactly what we are supposed to believe. Being gay is not a choice, its the way homosexuals are wired. Its part of their fundamental make up. They can't change it and neither can we. So get over it already.   I'm not saying I'm perfect. I was a teenager in the late eighties and I'm just as guilty as all of you about saying things like "fag" as a derogatory statement. The difference between me and a lot of the people out there in the political world is I met a few gay people and I got over it. I realized that gay people are just people. They just don't see things the same way I do. I can deal with that. As a matter of fact, I kind of like that. I don't want people to all be the same that would be fucking boring. I enjoy diversity. I love learning about the history of different areas, especially India and Egypt. I think that american culture is one of the most interesting subjects there is. The way the different subcultures interact is incredible to think about. So I am all for gay marriage because I simply don't see what the problem is. My wife gets health insurance, dental, and vision from my employer. A gay person's lifepartner gets...nada, zip, and ziltch. That is simply not fair. It's like withholding benefits from my wife because she's diabetic, she is and they don't.   I want to make sure eveyone who may see this gets the point, so here it is in no nonsense easy to read print:   I want gay marriage put back on the books in San Francisco and I want the government to recognize gay marriage everywhere in the US,   NOW  !     That's about as simple as I can make it. Till next time... goodbye.

       Ok, so I read Wil Wheaton's blog every day. I guess that makes me a true geek, after Sunday's post to his blog I feel inferior and unable to measure up to the geekiness of the master. Check it out  urlLink here . You're looking for the "i shit a piece of &pi;" entry. Go on...I'll wait.   Wow. I thought I was a pretty big geek there, but I guess I do not have the stuff to keep up with Wil! Unbelievable. Pi day. Whew.

       Saturday proved to be a somewhat religious experience for me. My father-in-law decided to take my wife and I to see  The Passion of the Christ , Mel Gibson's controversial new movie. I should mention that the reason, Stan, took us to see this movie was in order to help save our souls. My soul was saved years ago. I believe in God and I believe that Jesus gave his life for me. Like most people in today's society I don't tell every single person I meet that I'm a born again Christian. Frankly, its none of their business. I can hear the murmurs already, "But Chris, you...well, cuss!". Yes I do. Nowhere, I repeat, nowhere, that I have ever seen does the Bible prohibit cussing. It says to not take the Lord's name in vain. Occasionally I slip, and I appologize for it.   The point I'm getting at is that my in laws are very nice, sometimes even wonderful,...flawed people. They think that if you don't follow their  exact  way of thinking, you're evil. I mean actually evil, not just a sinner. They think that D&D is evil. They think that Yu-Gi-Oh!, yep, is evil. So they think that because I play D&D and I like Yu-Gi_Oh, well, then I can't be as good as I seem can I? And as for my wife...that's a long story, but needless to say they are not convinced of her goodness either.   So, what about the movie? It was an incredibly involving and wonderfully crafted motion picture. It was true to the source it was taken from, the Bible, and it was insanely violent. There were times that my wife and I winced at the portrayal of the roman guards who beat Jesus mercilessly. And we want to see Dawn of the Dead! The acting was great, but I had no doubts that Jim Caviesel, hope that's spelled correctly, could do the job. I saw him in  The Count of Monte Crisco  which I loved. As Jesus, he is inspired. As, I suspect, were many of the people involved in the picture. I came away with a new found respect for my Lord and Savior. Before the movie, I knew what kind of torture and hell, Jesus had gone through, but I never  saw  it. Believe me, seeing is understanding. If you think you would have done the same thing in Jesus' shoes, go see this movie and quit kidding yourself. You wouldn't.   I give this movie the highest rating I will ever give a movie. If you are Christian, go see it. If you aren't, go see it. Maybe you'll begin to understand. I don't expect to convert you, only show you something interesting. Whether you believe Jesus was the Jews' prophesied messiah or not you can't deny his bravery and conviction. That is what makes this movie great.  I beg you, however, to NOT take children under 13 to see this movie!  The violence is graphic, and while the story is true, the level of gore is too high for youngsters.   Another day passes, another dawn awaits. Until next time...goodbye!

       Sometimes as fans we don't quite realize what the stars we love go through to be their likable selves. As a case in point I present Wil Wheaton. Because of his blog we get a look at what we seem to be to the stars. Wil sees us as people not much different from himself. He has been lucky enough in life to be famous and he embraces all that he has been. He admits to a little frustration and exhaustion with the rabid fans, but also reveals that he tries hard to give that 150th augraph as much attention as the 1st. For this reason, I think, Wil Wheaton has taken on a level of stardom that is relatively new in the world. That of the approachable human star. Tad Williams, the author of several incredible novels is another of this new kind of star. I love the fact that I live in these times, when these talented individuals  feel  and are not numb to what we, the fans, see in them.    With all that said, I guess I should write about myself in this post. I haven't really given any potential readers any kind of real background or insight into the animal that is Chris. I'm a fanboy. I really am. I love good fantasy and science fiction. I think Spiderman is the greatest super hero of all time, but am rather fond of Superman and Green Lantern as well. I enjoy action, comedy, and even dramatic movies. I am a freak for anything with vampires or werewolves. I love to read about the unexplained. I have read Nostradamus' prophecies and wish to read in more deapth about Edgar Casey, the Sleeping Prophet. I saw the  Passion of the Christ  and was extremely moved by it. I am christian, but not stupid enough to think God hit on everything in the Bible. I believe in a creative evolution in which darwinian evolution occured, but was guided by God. I am a Java programmer working for an up and coming midwestern university, and... I hate it. I am married to the only woman I've ever loved, and thankfully she likes many of the same things I do. I have a life filled with blessings that I have trouble seeing because theres a load of shit in my eye. I'm occasionally angry and frustrated because I was promised I could be President, but no one mentioned the millionaire prerequisite. I like to try to believe in the inherent goodness in people, but I still remember growing up in south side Springfield, Ohio. I want to write novels and work from home, but Uncle Sam and President Bush just let the corporations ship all my potential jobs overseas and watch my dreams fly away. I want to believe there is a peaceful solution to terrorism, but then bombs go off and I realize that radicals are not interested in peace, just bloodshed. I want to wake up in the morning and rush to go to work 'cause I love it. I want to find a way to end this run on paragraph gracefully.   Everybody promised us elevation to new heights, but they forgot to mention it would be expensive and fucking  hard ! We of generation X aren't lazy, just disgruntled. Rich frat boys like Bush get to be President while we get to be underpaid and scared for our futures. No social security for me even though I still have to pay taxes for it. My entire job market is being shipped to India and other countries so I am stuck in a job that pays me about $20k less than I'm worth. My stress levels are high enough to kill a freakin' moose, and Bush wants me to vote for  him ! Not likely, Georgey boy. Ranting can be cathartic, though.   So, anyway, thanks for the time.

       A friend of mine sent me this article this morning:    Easter Bunny Whipped by Pa. Church Group    Thursday, April 08, 2004   GLASSPORT, Pa.   — A church trying to teach about the crucifixion of Jesus performed an Easter show with actors whipping the Easter bunny and breaking eggs, upsetting several parents and young children.       People who attended Saturday's performance at Glassport's memorial stadium quoted performers as saying, "There is no Easter bunny," and described the show as being a demonstration of how Jesus was crucified.   Melissa Salzmann, who brought her 4-year-old son J.T., said the program was inappropriate for young children.   "He was crying and asking me why the bunny was being whipped," Salzmann said.   Patty Bickerton, the youth minister at Glassport Assembly of God (search), said the performance wasn't meant to be offensive. Bickerton portrayed the Easter rabbit and said she tried to act with a tone of irreverence.   "The program was for all ages, not just the kids. We wanted to convey that Easter is not just about the Easter bunny, it is about Jesus Christ," Bickerton said.   Performers broke eggs meant for an Easter egg hunt and also portrayed a drunken man and a self-mutilating woman, said Jennifer Norelli-Burke, another parent who saw the show in Glassport, a community about 10 miles southeast of Pittsburgh.   "It was very disturbing," Norelli-Burke said. "I could not believe what I saw. It wasn't anything I was expecting."     Ok, so they thought the performance wouldn't be offensive. What?! Are you insane?! I swear I think that people are getting dumber. I think evolution is working backwards! What could possibly be    NOT    offensive about mercilessly whipping the Easter Bunny!!?? Ok, people, Mel Gibson is an oscar winning actor and director. He felt that the violence in his movie  The Passion of the Christ  was a necessary story element, and, incidentally, I agree with him. Until I saw that movie I didn't really understand what kind of hell of the flesh Jesus had gone through, but the visceral images Mel gave us made us understand. For that I am in his debt. That was the reason he put the insane amount of violence in the movie, so that people like me could finally understand at least a little what Jesus went through. However, whipping the Easter Bunny in front of four year olds is just plain irresponsibility. I think those poor morons should be arrested! Think of the anguish and therapy some of those kids will have to go through thanks to the stupidity of these wastes of human DNA.   Just breath, Chris. It'll be alright. Its stunts like this that keep me out of organized worship. I believe in God. I believe Jesus died for me. I believe. That's what matters. I don't go to church on Sunday because the churches are filled with idiots like these that think they know everything about right and wrong, but never take anyone else's feelings into consideration. Here's a really good example. My wife has a son who is currently in the custody of her parents, a long story best left for another time. Her parents are devout churchgoers. Her mom wanted us to go to their church this Easter, something I have no problems with if, Heather, my wife, wants to go. Heather soesn't want to go. For years her parents told everyone what a bad girl she was, and truthfully, she wasn't the model of goodness. So now, if she goes to church there she gets bombarded by people who mean well, but drive her crazy. Now her mom is angry. She is jealous because we go to my family functions at Thanksgiving and Christmas. So she wants Easter. I should mention that I see my family at Thanksgiving and Christmas, and thats all. I love my family, but we're all busy with our own things. We see Heather's family once or twice a   week  . Slight difference. So I don't get to see my family this Easter and we aren't going to church or to see her family either. Great. Thanks, Joyce.   Maybe next week I'll have some Wednesday night reviews. I think the shows are out of reruns. I only have six more episodes of Angel to review before it goes off air for good, bastards. It seems that the shows I really love always get cancelled. Oh, well, see ya, and Happy Easter!

       You ever have one of those days where you just want to be sitting on a beach in seventy-five degree weather sipping a frozen margurita and mulling over whether or not to have a steak for supper? More directly to the point, do you ever have a day you don't?! Me neither! So I'm sitting at my keyboard wishing with all my concentration that I could just be a writer or program something  fun  for once, but of course when I come back to reality I'm still just a lousy little web app programmer at a midwest university. Some days are made for daydreaming and the rest are made for thinking up good things to daydream about.   I guess maybe I just want something simpler. I mean the amount of work I have to do just to get an input from the user into a persistant area is insane. I don't even want to talk about the e-payment app I did for Wright State last year. Hell I still update that thing pretty often. No, I think I just want to do something interesting and fun. Like write novels. I have all kinds of daydreaming ideas. I guess its time to get off my ass and do something about it though, eh. Laziness is the dream killer. The sleeper shall awaken. Fear is the little death. Oh, &lt;cough&gt;, excuse me. I had some Dune stuck in my throat.   So I'm rambling at my keyboard at work writing something on this blog when I realize that I have absolutely nothing to say. I bitch and moan on this damn thing all the time, but I have no complaints at the moment. Nobody has pissed me off all that much. I guess I'm just tired of bitching about the same 'ol things. Huh, isn't that interesting. I have no desire to bitch. Its a breakthrough! Oh, well, I guess its time to end today's spectacle of a madman in training. Enough raving today, lunatic.   So I guess I'll see you next time, and don't forget that Smallville and Angel are  both    new   this week, or &lt;dripping-sarcasm&gt; fresh &lt;/dripping-sarcasm&gt; as the toad network likes to put it. Sheesh, hey, don't buckle those shackles so damn tight this time. I almost couldn't get free last time!

       When I was a teenager I had a problem with depression. My life was pretty shitty and I tended to dwell on it because I had no control over the problem. My father had gotten involved with a women named Joyce who I thought at the time was the anti-christ. Truth be told I wasn't far off, but the world hasn't ended quite yet so she falls somewhere short of spawn of the devil. Joyce hated me because I was a threat to her beloved little boy, Artie. She lavished her attentions on him and didn't want me to get any attention from my father so Artie could have it. I could give examples, but this isn't really my point so I'll move on.   Back in those days the depression was like a living thing. A determined darkness out to make my life worse by making me not give a damn. It was like being packed in cotton, nothing really ever touched me. I became distant and cold. I looked at the world through a fog that kept the evils at bay. But, like any other addiction it was a temporary fix. Eventually the fog would thin and the pain would hit. It was a catch-22 because the pain would make me want to put up the fog again. I think a lot of the negative portions of my personality were formed during those blurry intervals when I just couldn't bring myself to give a shit about anything.   I bring this up now because I can feel the darkness stirring. The fog is gathering and I've tried to keep it away. I'm married now, something I never thought would happen. I love my wife. The problems are my friends and my job. The problem with my friends is the lack thereof. My best friend and I have grown apart in attitude and in friendship. I can't watch the downward spiral of another friend. With him goes just about my entire circle of friends. On the job front, I just can't fucking stand it anymore. I want to call in every single day, but I can't afford to lose a $40k a year job. I feel trapped by the job and I can't stand it. Just like when I was a teenager, the darkness in my soul responds to these feelings and begins to rise. Some days I just look in the mirror and hate what I see. Other days I just can't seem care. Its affecting my mood now and my wife has noticed. I tried to keep it under control and not let it out, but it just won't cooperate.   I tend to feel a little better when I vent. That's why I put out this entry. I know that this can't last much longer, but I feel like I'm about to explode. I need to find another job or start role-playing again with a new group or I think I'll lose my frigging mind. Maybe I'll just take a vacation for a week to just veg and get some things done around the house. Yea, that should help.

       As you may have guessed from my post yesterday, I was in a H U G E funk. It never ceases to amaze me how a good piece of news or two can totally alter your mood. This afternoon I checked my Yahoo! page to see if Wil Wheaton had made any new  urlLink post s and sure enough he had. It turns out his friend Kris, who is battling cancer, just got the cancer-free tests back! I tell ya, even though I don't know Kris from Eve, I feel so much better knowing that she is responding to treatment. It's strange that a piece of news mostly unrelated to you can put things right back into perspective. Life  is  good. Anyhoo, everybody take a moment to smell the flowers, life is the longest thing we have and it could be taken at any point. Enjoy it for God's sake. No,... better yet, enjoy it for  your  sake.    Usually I try to think up something witty, but mostly just end up putting something utterly inept here. So today I'll let Kris' good news shine as my closing statement.

       Anyone who may have read this blog knows that I occasionally take a cue from  urlLink Wil Wheaton's  blog as to what I write about. Wil's entry today is a vivid description of a nice spring day at home. Just reading it made me feel all warm and gooey inside. I love that about Wil. That he can make you feel exactly what he is feeling. That is the one thing I've always said about writing. The greatest compliment you can get is when someone tells you that they felt exactly what you wanted them to feel while reading a scene. That's the power of the pen, baby. Its a beautiful thing.   So on to the topic at hand, spring days and pets. My wife and I have three wonderful kitties. They are Nefi, Moo, and Chewie in order of age. My wife had Nefi when I started dating her four years ago and we acquired Moo shortly thereafter. Chewie is more recent. I love them all. Nefi is a bit of a loner as far as human interaction goes. She doesn't seem to want to be around us all the time. She's also a bit lazy and  fat ! Moo is a people kitty. He loves people. Especially me. By design, I'm ashamed to mention. I liked Moo so much when we got him that I spoiled him to make him my kitty. My wife gets mad at me for that, but I love him! Chewie is just now coming around to the joys of human pettings. He has becaome an attention hound lately. He's big, pudgy, and  furry . He has very long fur.   Anywho, I have to get back to my training here at work, so... Till next time...

       Sometimes I am so moved by the news that I feel like I'll burst if I don't write about it somewhere. The shitstorm erupting from Abu Ghraib is just one of those stories. When the abuses first began to see the light of day the first thing I thought about was that experiment that a professor ran years ago to simulate a prison. He took several students and assigned them roles of guards or prisoners. The idea was to see how perceived roles affected behavior. The professor took on the role of warden. Before too long the guards were physically and mentally abusing the prisoners. This only took a few days! Normal people who would never act this way in regular life had become animals in just a few short days. The professor himself was so caught up in the role of warden that he didn't stop the experiment right away when things got out of hand. The prison of Abu Ghraib  is  a prison. The guards are really guards and the prisoners are actual prisoners. So imagine the possibilities.   We don't have to imagine, we have photos. That's right, they took pictures. Pictures of everything from physical abuse to forcing prisoners to masterbate in front of female guards. They even took pictures of themselves having consentual sex. I once heard that Sadam Hussein was searching for Babylon so he could rebuild it. I think we found it for him, but instead of arabs commiting attrocities it was us. When you look into the abyss be careful it isn't looking back. People in glass houses, after all, should not throw stones.   In case I was too dry in the presentation of the above I would like to go on record as saying these filthy low-life criminals need to be prosecuted for their crimes. There is absolutely no excuse for this kind of behavior. If it were up to me, I'd throw them to the Iraqis after their courts-martial. Who'd be laughing then, you wastes of flesh.

       Today I had a bit of a revelation. I complain quite a bit about my job and how much I hate it, but I don't think the job is the problem at all. I think the job is just fine actually, except that it underpays by about $20k per year. I think the real problem is me. I want to be on the edge of new technology. I want to be throwing around XML and SOAP messages. I want to glue disparate systems together. I don't necessarily want to be on the  bleeding  edge, but I would like to occasionally catch a particuarly violent arterial spray. Things you don't get while working at a university. Unless you're faculty and you are inventing the stuff. I'm not, faculty, that is. I'm a lowly IT Java programmer who makes $40k a year. In the corporate world that would be a joke or more precisely, an insult.   I found out the other day that one of my coworkers, a great guy from India, was hired on making $5k more per year than I. I have mixed feelings about that. On the one hand I'm happy for him, he just bought a house and started a family a short time ago. On the other hand I feel betrayed because I've been here for 4 years. I've invested 4 years of my professional life using outdated skills that will do nothing for landing me a more lucrative job. I guess maybe the job is partly to blame, but I think the job is the same, its me that's changed. I want more, lots more. I want fun and challenge, not boredom and politics. I think I made a mistake not going to school for the field I loved, writing. I can't go back to school for financial reasons and that really pisses me off.   I never seem to have time for the things I love any more. No role playing games, no warhammer 40k, no good television(now that Angel is gone), and no more friends. All my friends are gone. New ones seem to be coming much slower than before. The center cannot hold. I find myself in a perpetual state of daydream where everything I try could work, but then reality intrudes and there's the dark again. I take what solace I can from others doing well, like Wil Wheaton. My wife doesn't understand why I like Wil so much, but its really simple. Here's a guy who fell into a place where most people languish for life. A former child star that has found a new niche in the world and is becoming successful on  his  terms. I admire, Wil. I liked his portrayal of Wesley Crusher and I find that I like the man Wil became. Most importantly, though, I like how liking him makes me feel. I don't think I can explain it better than that.   Well, another deep message hits the electron highways. 'Till next time...goodbye.

       Sometimes I wonder just who is running the television networks. I heard today, actually I heard three days ago, that Star Trek: Enterprise is getting renewed due to fan support. Dramatic pause, and puzzled look. Cue picture of David Boreanaz in Angel attire. However, a much better show, Angel, gets canceled  despite  fan support. The words, kiss my lilly white freckled ass, come to mind. I mean please, Angel was a much better drama. Don't get me wrong here, I love Star Trek in all its incarnations, including Enterprise, but, let's face it, we've been there before. We did that. We can't really boldly go to the same place over and over can we? There are better Star Trek premises out there I know it.   Angel was smart and funny. It was more than just a conglomeration of secondary characters from Buffy. It grew and exceeded our expectations. But most importantly, it had another good season or two left in it. I'm disappointed in the WB for canceling Angel while at the same time I am proud of them for Smallville. Smallville is a fantastic spin on the Superman mythos. The writers are incredible and the acting is top notch.   I guess what I'm really trying to say here is I...hate...sauerkraut! Ah, nothing like a little disjointed comment to make the readers say, WTF!! Anyone who actually got that in-joke gets two gold stars on the geek bar! Anyhoo, I guess that's all from geekland, until next time... goodbye!  (another allusion to something wow, two in one post)

       urlLink Yahoo! News - Complaints Over Cell Phone Service Abound      Here's the link to the article I mentioned in the previous post.

         I was reading my healines on My Yahoo! when I came across an article on the state of cell phone service in the United States. The article was well written and somewhat informative, for example, the cell phone industry ranked 39th out of the 40 rated industries in customer satisfaction. It beat the cable industry, but who couldn't? You could take your customer service calls with a tin can and string, and staff your centers with convicts and end up with better customer service than the cable industry!       Verizon Wireless was ranked number 1 in the cell phone industry in customer service, but as the article states it was number one in a "lackluster field". Its like saying you're the number 1 surfer in Montana. Then a representative of Verizon had this gem to say:               Asked about the ranking, Verizon's Rabe said, "Compared to what? Lands' End? You have to compare apples to apples. I wouldn't compare the customer experience of dealing with a complicated technology with buying a shirt. It's just a whole different challenge.           Customer service is customer service whether you're buying a shirt, a cellphone, or a fucking car you dipshit. When I call your customer service line I expect to be treated like Land's End would treat me not like the guards at Levinworth would treat me. This is a perfect example of how these rich bastards think of the rest of us. Just because they can afford, or more to the point charge to their expense accounts, exhorbitant fees for their cellphones and jet plane rides they think we should all take it up the ass and shut up about it!         The really bad part of this is that some of us want to use our cellphones as home phones. With the proliferation of high speed internet options like DSL and Cable modems we don't need the antiquated bulky home phone any longer, but thanks to the gouging we get from cellphone companies we can't get rid of the damn things. My wife and I use Cricket as our cellphone provider. It has its drawbacks, but for $50 a month we can make unlimited calls in our local area which encompases everyplace I might want to call. The drawbacks are significant, however, bad signal, holes in service not reflected on the coverage maps, and the catch-all bad customer service for which the industry is known. I should mention in Cricket's defense that they did exchange a phone that was buggy.      'Till next time..., goodbye.

         I'm feeling a little more confident about my marketability these days. I got a call from a recruiter for a nationally known IT consulting firm yesterday. I have a phone interview today at 5:45 pm. The fact that he's willing to interview me makes me feel a little better about things. I thought that I was screwed since I have not yet completed my degree. I guess four years of development experience is equivalent to one year of college course work. It makes me feel better anyway. Hopefully I'll get this job and it will pay significantly more money. I guess I'm not feeling particularly talkative today so I guess that's it.      'Till next time..., goodbye.

         Today on his blog, Wil Wheaton, posted a fragment of another blog which was a story of a woman and her two sons and how they came together because of a fluke renting of Star Trek: The Next Generation. Because of a group of stupendously idiotic hackers, Wil's site has the comments turned off. So I can't post this there. I have to put it here and hope by divine providence he might see it. I've read a lot about Wil on his blog for the last few months and my wife gets mad when I mention it to her because its all I talk about. The truth is that I found out that Wil is a normal human being. He has hopes and dreams and he wants to be a father to his stepsons of whom he is tremendously proud. I find a bit of me in him, and I guess I'm not nearly the only one. His books are selling like crazy and his voice acting career seems to be gaining steam. But, I find that part of me still sees him as Wesley Crusher, boy genius of the starship Enterprise.      I remember the night the show debuted. My dad and I had made popcorn and we sat expectantly in front of the TV waiting to hear those famous words, "...to boldly go where no...". My dad had always been a fan of the original series and we watched it every weeknight when I was a kid along with episodes of M*A*S*H. Consequently I grew up with a sense of wonder and anger at the world's seeming inability to get along. Every week my dad and I would sit and watch Captain Picard, Commander Riker, Lt. Worff, Lt. Commander Data, Chief Engineer LaForge, Counselor Troi, Dr. Crusher, and, my favorite character, Wesley Crusher. My eyes would glass over and I would be lost to Gene Roddenberry's view of the future. I shared those years with my father and I cherish them. My dad passed away when I was twenty-one, twelve years ago. As I write this I can barely keep the tears from my eyes. I wish for those days like no others. I miss my dad more than I can say, but when I see those uniforms and hear that commanding voice say, "Make it so", I remember. I know that a lot of people have been moved by Star Trek in the past, but for me Star Trek is a reminder of good days. So when I see that Wil Wheaton is doing well, I feel good, because he and the others of the starship Enterprise gave me some of my fondest memories. So thanks Wil, Johnathon, Marina, Gates, Patrick, Michael, Brent, and LaVar. Thanks for giving me a way to remember my dad in good times and not the way he was near the end.      'Till next time..., goodbye.

         I just got word this morning that I'm being sued. Fucking beautiful. I'm thirty-three fucking years old and I'll never be able to buy a fucking house at this rate. I have no money and no way to get any more...its enough to make any sane man go fucking postal! If it was just me I had to worry about I'd quit my job and remove the money from my retirement, something I apparently can't do while I'm still employed here! It's  my  fucking money! God I hate this fucking world sometimes.      My wedding anniversary was this last Sunday, ask me what we did. I PLAYED A FUCKING VIDEO GAME WHILE MY WIFE WATCHED!!!! We couldn't even afford to go out to dinner!! I'm a computer fucking programmer, this shit isn't supposed to happen to me any more! What the fuck do I have to do, make a deal with fucking Satan?! Not that I ever would. I am so tired of the fucking rat race because its full of..., fucking rats.       Sometimes I just wanna scream. I live my life right and do what I feel is the right thing and it all just blows up in my face. Meanwhile, drug dealers and murders get away scott fucking free and Catholic Priests are buggering the shit out of little boys and they get a slap on the wrist and rehabilitation. What is wrong with the world?! Oh, well, I guess that's fucking life. Eventually I suppose I'll get through it. I'll be eighty-five with no money and only memories of good times, but I'll live. At least I have my wife, she's the only thing making it worthwile anymore. I feel the darkness barking at my heels. It wants a hold again, but I don't quit anymore. I don't give in. Fuck the world, fuck the bill collectors, fuck the capitalist dogma, and fuck me...everybody else does.      'Till next time..., goodbye.

         I sat in my office this morning brooding over my life as of late. My car, the only one we have, broke down two weeks ago. It was the latest in an incredibly long string of horrendous luck my wife and I have had lately. It appeared to be the radiator at first. I mean the radiator had a big swell with a nice spraying leak. So a friend of mine, Kevin, offered to help me fix the damn thing. Unfortunately, as many of you know, car parts like a radiator are prohibitively expensive. And forget about getting it professionally done. The keyword there is "professional", and they get  paid , but not by me. So one beautiful morning, while I was supposed to be at work, we ripped the rusted and forlorn looking thing out of the front of my car and off we skipped to the junkyard.       Lo and behold, the junkyard had the radiator I needed! I jumped with joy and giggled, on the inside. I mean these are some burly guys here. This may well be the twenty-first century, but jumping and giggling with a little golf clap could still get you a world class ass whippin' in some places. Home we went to install my very nice looking radiator. Yah, it...didn't fucking work. Either something else was wrong or the radiator we got was bad. Woo hoo! I love it when plans fall apart like a well set up building demolition. So there I was, and am, with no car to drive to that magical place I like to call hell, but is actually referred to as "work" by my colleagues and supervisor.      Which brings me to the point. Sort of anyway. Why is all this happening now, and most importantly why does it get me down? I've been much poorer than this in my life and still been happy. I see janitors and Wal-Mart slaves that all seem to be happy with their lot in life. What makes me different? Then I had an epiphany. I wasn't really doing anything I loved. My life at home is good. I have a great wife and four very cool fun kitties. I enjoy being home, like most people I suppose. Its work that I hate. Not just work in general, though. I hate  my job . I had always wanted to be a writer, but I chose to go to school for something that would make me some money, I have to chuckle a little here since I make dick. This is generating a ton of  low level stress which in turn is making it hard for me to enjoy anything.      Isn't this grand, I've become Dr. fucking Phil. I know what's wrong, but now comes the big question. How do I fix it? While I make dick for my job what I  do  make is more than I can make at any lower level job, therefore I'm stuck. Oh, well, fuck it. I've decided to not worry about it so fucking much. I guess I'll just try to write while driving my friend's car back and forth to hell. They say every dog has his day. Too bad I'm not a dog.      'Till next time..., goodbye.
