      hi. this is my first post.....yay!!! anyway, i'm a HUGE fan of Linkin Park and i just went to their show on the 22nd of June. best day of my life! i'm in the lpu so i got to meet the band which was the coolest thing ever!!! anyway, here's what happened during the day. first i met up with the other lpuers at cityhall mrt station at 4 or so then walked to the venue which was the padang. there were already so many people there so we quickly joined the que. we were sitting on the stinkin' grass for so long i managed to make a new friend - jolenne. then, i noticed that the lpuers who got into the meet and greet session were not in the que but were standing somewhere in the front so jolenne and i joined them there. i met some malaysian lpuers and we all quickly became friends. we were standing for quite a while when some of the girls said they want to go to the bathroom so they went to look for one and i was left with platinumscorpion(forgot your real name!) and alan. we waited for a really long time before they came back and we went to the meet and greet counter to sign in.  waited and waited for a very long time and it even started to drizzle a little but luckily did not rain. finally, a lady told us to go que up in another place while she started checking our names off a list. we waited some more and i was entertained my none other than magic man syafiq. showed me some tricks and then who could have guessed who i saw? mtv vj denise keller!!!!(for those who are not in singapore you might not know who she is!) she came over to us we were filmed for mtv use. here's what was said: denise: what are we here for? us: LINKIN PARK denise: what do we wanna watch? us: BREAKING THE HABIT!!!!! it was so cool then after that, i managed to get a picture with her. then somemore news people came over and we started shouting take picture! take picture! then mark from lp newscaster came over and picked alanvoon and ipporek to do the newscaster episode with the rest of us in the backgrond. he kept on taking picures and a few days ago, i checked the lpu website and found my picture there! so cool! then, it got dark and we were finally taken to meet lp. it was so cool! they are really cute in real life. especially mike! anyway, first in line was brad so here's i put my poster on the table to get signed and then i said "this is for you" coz i got him a b'day keychain of his b'day, 1st december. he said "thanks" and read it. then he said "i didn't know queen mary of scotts died on my b'day!" i just laughed and took a picture of him before going on to mike. he's so cute!!! and he was smiling such a nice smile i almost melted. anyway, he signed my poster and i gave him the keychain. his b'day's on 11th february. he said "thank you" and stared at it a while before putting it in his bag and smiling at me. then was phoenix. he said "what's up?" and i just stared at him, totally awestruck that he was talking to me. he looked at me and then said "nothing?" and i just nodded. so stupid!!!! anyway he signed my poster and i gave him the keychain of his b'day. then he said "thanks. how did you know my birthday?" i just laughed and he laughed. then was joe. he signed my poster and then i gave him the froggie stuffed animal since he likes froggies so much. he looked really surprised and said "thanks". then was rob. he was really quiet. he signed my poster and i gave him the keychain. he said "thanks". that's when i remembered : I DIDN'T TAKE A PIC OF MIKE, PHOENIX, JOE AND ROB!!! OMG!!! i jsut turned around and snapped a shot of brad, mike, mark(newscaster guy who was filming the meet and greet), phoenix and joe. then i tured to rob and took a pic of him! phew, that was close. then was chazzy. he looked really tired. he signed my poster and i took a pic of him and left. OMG!!!!! oh shit. my sis wants to use the com so i'll continue the rest another time. for now, bye!

      so after i left i went to meet the rest of the lpuers and guess what? the security guards didn't lead us directly to the venue as stated, they led us to the ENTRANCE of the Padang. holy shit they made us rejoin the que so we were last in line. but that didn't stop us. once we got into the venue, the tallest guy from the lpu pushed his way through and we followed him behind. we were stepping on peoples feet and stuff  and they were cursing at us but we didn't care. in the end, we got somewhere in the middle. oh shit. i'm telling you, my sis needs to stop using the com. peace.
