       urlLink    Volley 5:  Mike.  I return with the weakest sauce yet.  I know.. I know.. all in the name of the game.  But they didn't leave me much to work with to tone it down.  Bonsai, the wonder cat, has the powers to turn anything into cuteness, so I relied on her.  Dave, your serve.

       urlLink    Volley 4: Arzhang Well Dave set me up so perfect with this one and at the risk of being deemed psychotic I went ahead with it. Where there is love there is inevitably hate and evil. That is the dichotomy I went with. I have shown how corporations and lies can jeopardize our health and well being under the mere defense of ignorance. I've also illustrated the lies and agendas that propel people to kill and no I'm not equating the two figures shown. I've also shown the discrimination under the guise of righteousness and the people we have lost to that discrimination (see top right corner). The good and love side is more subtle but has some things youâ€™ll have to find on your own!&nbsp; urlLink

       urlLink    Volley 3: Dave (again).  Arzhang and I each took a bonus volley as Mike is away for the weekend.  Here's my reply to Arzhang's "life" experience and life in general.  I went with a putrid orange color (hope it doesn't bring back bad memories Zhang - jk) with tons of texture.  Life is dirty, life is messy, and it can suck (e.g. my volley!)...but there are also beautiful things embedded in the chaos (see if you can see them).  I of course noted 'life' to continue the theme, but brought up 'love' as a new addition.  All in all, everything is "worth preserving."  If you want the full-res image (and not the just larger version that you get you clicking the image above) try  urlLink here  [note: 1.89MB]. &nbsp; urlLink

       urlLink    Volley 2: Arzhang  I got inspired by my terrible 24 hour flu bug and created this.  Going along with the whole "worth preserving" theme I came up with the simple notion of "life" and medicine.  It sort of felt like death is upon you when you are puking your guts out and you realize that life and health are worth preserving.  You will noticed the sunflower now has a viral center.  The same little shits that did me in yesterday.  Die!!&nbsp; urlLink

       urlLink    Volley 1: Dave.  Arzhang asked me to begin round 3.  I dug a bit and decided I wanted to start it with a theme.  I played with a lot of my old photography, and inevitably picked "worth preserving."  I found a greviella flower from Aussie that looked amazing as a B&W.  It just made me think of all the beautiful little things (and I was trying desperately to avoid the dark and angry imagery that came in prior rounds).  Did make it dirty, I rather like the crud on top.  Added some other texture elements and will cast it off to see how Zhang responds.&nbsp; urlLink

       urlLink    Volley 9: Mike's.  The weakest attempt yet.  But, I had a few other things to worry about and we wanted to get the last one done so we can start a new.  Perhaps upon first glance it looks harmless, but look deeper and you will see what I mean.

       urlLink     Volley 8: Arzhang.&nbsp;The&nbsp;other pictures in the series seemed to focus on choice and the ambiguity in it.&nbsp; However, we failed to&nbsp;illustrated the abysmal&nbsp;choices that have been made in the past despite a plea of undeniable logic by our leaders.&nbsp; The top of the picture depicts capitalism at its worse with the oil fields.&nbsp; This ultimately fuels&nbsp;our&nbsp;disgustingly shallow pop culture as depicted by Britney.&nbsp;&nbsp;Ultimately this is masturbation (see Britney) since it only serves to&nbsp;propel and self-satisfy the rich and powerful.&nbsp; Meanwhile,&nbsp;the rich and powerful sensationalize&nbsp;their propaganda&nbsp;and force the proletariat to sacrifice for their ultimate vision of the world through fear of destruction and corruption of all.&nbsp; The world, ironically, as both see it contains beauty and harmony as seen by the red rose.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In short I tried&nbsp;to show the&nbsp;stupid choices we have made as a human race and the struggle to maintain our own greed.&nbsp; urlLink

       urlLink    Volley 7: Dave.  Mike's idea of "seeing clearly" ..ahem, cleary applied to 'vision' and 'choice.'  They are separate yet very connected ideals.  This was getting a bit deep for me, so I just played with vision graphics and threw in our great and established door symbology for 'choice.'  Don't know that we need to pick a specific theme for these things...can follow one pretty well.  ;)  What you got Arzhang?&nbsp; urlLink

Why not use my disability as an advantage.  Not sure if I did or not.. I'm not that deep.  But here it is, for all to see.

       urlLink    Volley 5: Arzhang.  Going with the whole door theme the real question becomes what is behind the door.  The fact is we have a choice.  We can either look behind the door or fear it so much that we ignore it.  Whether it is a popstar who doesn't shy from being a "good girl" to a religious icon to knowledge itself each one of these requires picking a door and ultimately deciding to go through it for better or worse.    Technically, the caustics in the image were composited in Adobe After Effects.  The remaining elements were brought into Photoshop.&nbsp; urlLink

       urlLink    Volley 4: Dave.  I couldn't get over Mike's image...it was pretty incredible.  But what most resonated with me was what might be behind the door (I wouldn't go in the door).  I played with shadows, blending, lighting effects, and finally decided on focusing on that idea.  I highlighted only the door from Mike's volley, and then just added "some possibilities."  Weak return, but let's see where it goes.&nbsp; urlLink

       urlLink    Volley 3:  I saw Arzhang's image and thought about printing crap loads of them out and splattering it around town.  Instead of doing that... I took my new camera and went around the back streets of Nampa looking for places where I would post the picture.  Found this little whole of an alley and took a few shots.  Converted to black and white (planned that all along), did some cool level tricks and added the poster.  It was missing something yet, so I went to Corbis.com (don't tell Billy G) and grabbed an image of homeless people and added it in.  Did some "color" correction and wah-la. Volley returned.

       urlLink    Volley 7: Arzhang's image seemed to focus on copyright and an eerie 'big brother' feeling, using the whole "he is watching" symbolism.  The police car was good reinforcement.  I wanted to divert from this.  Looking back at previous volleys, my mind took this path through the forming art: focus and definition, tranquility and perhaps serenity, how easily it is changed, violence and our objectification and obsession with it, then how we manipulate the system for positive outcomes. =)  With all this, I thought of 'choice' and its repercussions.  I tried to illustrate a couple sides of that theme.&nbsp; urlLink

I took a series of pics with my new camera and pieced together this piece.  I had to do something that was a bit "happier".  That, and I had to give Arzhang a challenge.

       urlLink    Volley 4: Dave's Reply. Arzhang's modifications left me thinking one thing (and anyone who knows me knows that I do enjoy my Stargate) -- the combination of pyramid / explosions / and light eminating left me think of only one thing. I had no choice, try the DVD (kidding, more than likely isn't in stores).&nbsp; urlLink

       urlLink    Volley 3: I noticed two black triangles in the background that resembled pyramids.  Coupled with Mike's great lighting on the sign, I decided to go crazy with the lights and make black pyramids shooting light into the air.  This in turn reminded me of the Middle East and so I put the flame on one of the signs.  It symbolizes the destruction that we and others are causing over there.&nbsp; urlLink

       urlLink    Volley 8: Mike.  After some weak sauce moments on my last two volleys, I decided to start thinking about what madtennis is.  This is what I came up with.  I thought I was done, then I inverted the whole creation and the results was quite cool.  I played around with that version a bit more then the power flickered.  I took that as a sign that it was not meant to be. Enough, just post it.

       urlLink    Volley 7: Arzhang  I decided to take the themes Dave presented in his work and expand on them.  This past week we lost a great scientist and I think his work encompasses a lot of the themes Dave hit on.  It is not difficult for one to imagine that the discovery made by Watson and Crick could easily lead to abuse, inappropriate manipulation and ownership.  I also wanted to hit on the theme of deception and distortion to evoke fear.  It's in MCP's hands now.&nbsp; urlLink

       urlLink     Volley 6: Dave.  This piece began with a lot of emotion, mostly reflective of my fight with my cable company (and I kind of lost motion once the anger subsided, also it was hard to work on w/o access to the Internet and imagery).  Don't really have much to say about it, everything is in there as text.  I did do most of it intentionally (i.e. the unfinished black space on the bottom left, the darkness, the faceless guard, etc).  No real other comments though, on to Arzhang.   Had to link it from my site, as I'm still w/o Internet and don't have access to  urlLink Hello .  The full-size image is big (1.42MB), just as a warning.

        A new idea for us tech geeks with web pages.  How about doing movie reviews on our sites.  If we all see the same movie we can rate them from 1 to 5 stars and if we are inclined write a review.

        3rd Time's a Charm?  I got a no from University of Washington's MD/PhD program for the second year in a row.  It seems like three majors, 5 years of research, and near a 4.0 isn't enough.  I guess not coming from a large school like UW, Harvard, et al kills you.  When you buy a TV I bet you'd be more inclined to buy a Sony over some generic brand just because of the name even though the generic one is exactly the same or better.  Well I'll just have to try again because I really really want to do it, but it's almost getting embarrasing.

        Interview with the star of iChicken      What convinced you to star in iChicken?  Well I really love my iPod and when I saw those ads I said to myself, I know I have better moves than that.   Does it bother you when people say they can’t tell it’s a chicken or thing it’s blob?  It doesn’t.  I’m happy with my body and I’m not afraid to show it off.  So I have a furry tail.  Who cares.   If you could meet one person who would it be?  I would have to say Steve Jobs.  He’s sort of a hero to me.  Anyone who’s behind something as cool as the iPod has to be interesting.   These day’s there’s a lot of pressure on young stars to always look their best and they often get pressured into doing things they don’t want to do.  Have you ever experienced any of that?  Yes, I think we all do.  I was approached by playboy to do some stuff but I declined.  I’m not going to sell out.  I’m proud of what I have.   What’s the wildest thing you have done?  Okay, this one time at chicken camp… Just kidding.  I’m always in control.  I’m a cool bird.   iChicken has it’s critics who say it is lame or that it isn’t well done.  What do you have to say about that?  I think they need to get a sense of humor.  It was done for fun and we all hoped folks would get a good laugh out of it.  Those folks that bash me should ask themselves if they could do better and quit complaining.   In your free time who do you like to hang out with?  Well I gotta give props to  urlLink Funk Masta MCP .  Good times.   Are there any plans for a sequel?  I guess anything is possible.  I’ll have to talk to management about it.  We’ll have to see how folks respond.  We have other talent as well that might like to get involved in other projects.   Rumor has it that creators of iChicken enjoy eating chicken.  Does that bother you?  No they were very kind to me.  You know, I really don’t feel comfortable about talking about it.   Really?  No comments?  I said no comment.   Anything?  Ok.  This interview is over.   (Waddles off the set.)

       Well I attended my first caucus yesterday and boy was it a blast!  Yeah, yeah I know what you are thinking, "How can a caucus be fun?"  Well it was!  We started by forming groups around who we liked best.  I went for Dean.  Next if we had below 15% of the total attendees, we could try to sway the undecideds and other unviables to come to our camp.  As it turned out, John Reuter who was for Sharpton, convinced all the Sharpton folks to go for Dean.  Also, he and others helped get the Kucinich folks.  Together we had 21% of the folks for Dean which was a very high percentage for Idaho.  John Reuter is going to be an Idaho delegate and Ron Torres was an alternate delegate.  Many asked me to go but the convention falls on the day of my friend's wedding so best man duties take priority.  Good times though.  I encourage everyone to try it out.  It is surprisingly fun!

         4/5 Stars Well I went and saw The Butterfly Effect tonight.  I wasn't expecting too much especially since I don't think Ashton Kutcher can act very well.  I was pleasantly surprised.  The story was quite disturbing and the more you thought about it the more you appreciated it.  Basically the story revolves around someone losing his memories and having the ability to change reality by going back in time and doing things differently.  Going along with its chaos theory theme, seemingly small changes can have a dramatic impact on the lives of others.  If you could go back in time what would you change about your life?  How would that change effect others?  Is it better to meet someone and have that ruined, or is it better to have never met someone at all?  These are all philosophical questions that stem from this movie.  I would go into it with an open mind and don't be super anal about he acting etc.  It's the themes that are key.  Really good flick I recommend it.

        Well I must admit I was a bit bummed when I found out that Wes Clark dropped out of the race.  He seemed charismatic and is obviously a brilliant guy.  John Kerry just doesn't excite me.  He criticizes Bush but actually voted for much of the things he criticizes Bush for.  Clark was someone different.  We wasn't a Washington guy.  I'm no big fan of the military but I think it is telling when someone from the military comes back and passionately argues against war.  Even better when he offers alternative ways of achieving the objective.  Here's a guy that knows what its like to send people's kids into battle and he knows it isn't pretty.  I wonder what would have happened if he participated in the Iowa caucuses.  Perhaps we would be talking about him instead of Kerry.  At any rate, I think the democrats lost a great candidate yesterday.

         STAR WARS PROJECT BEGINS!  Well I decided to go back to my old reliable film buddy Issac Hunter for a project of this scale.  Isaac was the first actor I had when I first got my video cameras and we have done a lot of videos and special effect projects togther.  Mostly they were just crazy videos but were really great memories.  We both decided we wanted to do a video that would top everything and show off our current skills with film making/acting.  John Reuter also signed on to the project and will be serving as the evil vilan.  The story is still in the works but we are deviating from the college theme and going to a politcal one.  It seems more appropriate being an election year and all.  This picture shows off the new lightsaber technique we are going to use.  Stay tuned for more on the movie!

         Happy New Year!   This Saturday was the first day of Spring.  This is the Persian new year called Norooz or New Day.  To me this makes a lot more sense than having new years in January because spring symbolizes life and a new beginning to things.  At any rate I hope everyone's year goes well.

         I got into Emory University School of Medicine (MD) and the University of New Mexico MD/PhD program.  I'm so thankful, every school that I have interviewed at this year (so far) I have been accepted to.  The folks at Emory and New Mexico were some of the nicest folks I've seen.  I think Emory and the University of New Mexico should get some kind of reward for treating their applicants with respect and courtesy.  Emory's letter actually had a hand written note wishing that I would come to their school.  Yes someone cares about me as a person!

                A "perfect" streak.  I was lucky enough to get into every school I interviewed at.  OHSU sent their accpetance letter today.  So, as if any of this makes any sense, you can get accepted to some schools yet not even get interviewed by others.  Perhaps this process isn't random but it makes about as much sense as an underwater hair dryer and is a lot more unfair.  To be fair here is a list of places that rejected me or that I declined to interview at (I've also listed schools I've been rejected at multiple times)  The bolded schools were my top choices:  Baylor College of Medicine 2x Charles R. Drew University of Medicine and Science David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA George Washington University Sch of Med & Hlth Sci  Harvard Medical School 2x Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine 2x Keck Sch.

          Kill Bill  I was a bit uncertain after seeing Kill Bill Volume 1 what I though of the movie.  After seeing Kill Bill Volume 2, however,  I'm convinced that both movies are amazing.  Tarantino's film, although extremely violent and a bit over the top at times, is so detailed that one can't help but be amazed.  While the first movie was primarily an action movie, the second one slows things down a bit and shows the more human side of the characters.  They are more complete and we get the back story of Uma's character the Bride.  Pai Mei the Kung Fu master is hilarious.  If you can stand the violence this is a must see.

        urlLink   Did anyone see the news conference with Bush?  It was embarrasing.  He was asked at least three times in one form or another if he made any mistakes, and not once did he admit anything in the slightest that he did wrong.  At one point the president was completely, (and  I seriously mean completely), stumped.  He could not think of the biggest mistake his administration made when he was asked.  I know people in office don't like to admit when they are wrong but we are talking about serious issues, issues that need to be fixed or else more people may die.  Clinton was blasted for not fessing up to the whole Monica ordeal.  Why isn't that same quest for admitting mistakes not taken by the Republicans that bombasted Clinton?  It seems like a double standard.    Bush stumbled for about a minute saying how the reporter caught him off gaurd and how he probably wasn't as alert as he should be.  Alert?  Sharp?  Isn't that what a leader is supposed to be?  It seemed as though anything but the talking points was a real struggle for him.  I think there is value in having someone being able to think on their own in this rapidly evolving post 9/11 world.  It was a sad site to see.  From Rhodes Scholar to this.  I know there are a lot better Republicans out there.  This event was just amazing.  Sad times indeed.  In my opinion, we need a change.

Bill started strong with an amazing 4 strikes in a row only to tank at the end.  The second round belonged to Slash Master Fallahi who scored a 147.  Team Peck showed dominance in the third round with Cassie scoring a 147.  The game was complicated by the fact that one of our lanes was possessed by a "phantom" according to the pin monkey.  After a pin got jammed in the bowling apparatus we were told of a phantom that haunts lane 1 of the Nampa bowl.  We scoffed at first but started to believe that evils spirits were indeed at work when pins were falling for no reason.  Urban legend?  I think not.  We will have to study this further.

          I am Sick.  Friends, I have witnessed the most disturbing set of images I have ever scene in my life.  The beheading of Nicholas Berg was beyond words and I am not even going to post the link to spare you the horror.  The animals that did this are not humans.  The beheading was not swift with a sword, rather it was a slow cutting of his head with a knife, Berg screaming helplessly as the abundance of blood drowns out his screams.  These animals have the arrogance and complete blasphemous cockiness to say Allaho Akbar, "God is great" as they cut this man's head.  That Allah is not the same Allah that I know.  That "Allah" they chant to is the devil himself.  The only relation these folks have to God is to be the exact opposite, pure evil.  Reactions to the beheading on the site I visited called for Nuking the entire Middle East.  All Muslims were deemed many four letter words.  I have always been a Muslim and I do not run from my religion.  People on that site were calling to kill me and my family.  They wanted blood for the blood spilt.  I say enough.  To portray an entire people and religion based on animals that are the complete opposite to it, IS evil.  For once I wish all peoples would actually follow their religion and embrace unity and peace.  No religions preaches this.  We are in troubled times indeed.

        My Decision, Mein Kampf   If you would have told me that a graduate with three majors graduating with top honors, a 90% on the MCAT, and 5 years of research would be rejected from every single choice school he wanted to go to I would have laughed outright in denial.  Denial is my reality.  I was always raised to think that doing your best and working your hardest would be rewarding, not only for your inner self but also for your future.  What I wasn't told was how all this depends on whether or not people will actually LOOK at what you have done.    Growing up I saw my share of racism with my family being from Iran.  Some were more gruism than others but you can never erase those memories and they motivated me to try to make a difference.  I never thought that I would experience a more subtle but equally degrading form of discrimination.  After performing poorly on the MCAT I was reject by over 20+ medical programs (I lost count after 20).  I retook the test relunctantly knowing that everything I had done was overshadowed by one stupid reading comprehension section.  When I got my new scores a great burden was lifted off my sholders.  I was in the 90th percentile and in science I was above that.  Surely this would mean that I would have a shot at my top schools for an MD/PhD program.  Surely places like UCSF, UCSD, and Stanford had to take notice.  I was right up there with them as far as everything.  The reality:  I didn't even qualify to submit a formal application to UCSF, Stanford told me that students like me infuriate them, and UCSD rejected me despite letters from two alums of that school.  I turned to the University of Washington, the only other school in West (where I wanted to be) that had the research I was interested in.  Indeed, 5 days after my interview I was accepted to the MD program.  Yeah right, the MCAT is just one factor.  Reality:  It is THE FACTOR!    I  anxiously waited for the news from the dual degree program.  My rejection came several months later with no reason.  The director said I should do research, perhaps try a summer research experience.  It was obvious my application as not "looked" at.  What else COULD I have done?  I'm only a recent undergrad; how can I have more than 5 years of research experience.  It was obvious that the thing at play here was merely where I was from.  Idaho = incompetence.  Need more evidence?  There has NEVER been an Idaho educated student accepted to that program, EVER.  I felt a feeling that I hoped I would never feel again, discrimination.  So, am I being overdramatic?  How would you feel having to wait 2 years to go to a school that wasn't at the top of your list, in a city you don't like, and to the wrong program!  I have a deskdrawer filed with over 40 rejection letters.  Did I have other choices?  Yes.  I got into 5 medical schools and 1 MD/PhD program.  However I have a specific area of interest and want to stay in the West.  Call it stupidity or ambition.  What does that leave me with?  I want a school that is established, has a program I want, and has some reputation.  I'm sick of being treated this way.  There was no "choice."  There was only one viable option.  The University of Washington is the anti-Albertson College.  It is almost the exact opposite of ACI.  The people treat you like a number, it is huge, and has a huge reputation nationally.  Alas my "decision" is to go to the University of Washington and reapply for the third year now to the MD/PhD program.  I guess it is irony because I don't like coffee, rain, or dogs.  But no need to worry I will spend my first day in the beautiful city of Moscow, Idaho.  I guess that's what I get for going to school in this state, having to stay even longer in it!  When I bump into numerous people they ask, "So, are you excited to be going to medical school."  How do I respond to something like that?

       CALDWELL, Idaho -- The Associated Press is reporting that a green Mazda 626 has been cleaned.  The vehicle is said to belong to one Arzhang Fallahi.  "I never knew my car could fit five people," remarked Fallahi.    In fact the car can fit five people and the trunk has sufficient space to hold various items.  While no one can be certain what sparked the cleaning frenzy, the shock was evident.  "Cleaning is like torture for you," commented Fallahi's shocked mother.  Mother Fallahi had been commenting for months on the abysmal condition of the poor vehicle.  Among the contents found in the vehicle were a biochemistry text, half a dozen or more fortune cookie fortunes, and a birthday card addressed to one Mr. Zach Hagadone.  It is speculated that the massive amount of paper collected from the car will bring back enough money from recycling to fuel the vehicle for up to a month.  One can only hope that such things will repeat themselves and that the car will always remain a vehicle for five.

         I don't remember a movie that has brought me closer to tears than this.  Sure many will call it a propaganda film and attack the facts.  Despite this, the crux of the movie remains factual. The Saudis get preferential treatment and the American people (and the world) get screwed for it.  Moreover, Bush et al. are sending the poor (and those without prospects) to do their dirty work.  They get rich while poor people kill other poor people.     Michael Moore is first and foremost an amazing filmmaker.  Many of the clips in the movie are things we have seen before yet the way Moore blends them together is masterful.  Being a news junkie I can tell you that many of the clips Moore uses are commonplace (i.e. inarticulate Bush, simplified world view etc) yet he weaves them into an elegant tapestry of emotion.  What really made the movie were the emotions it took us through.  At the beginning, we are given a funny look at Bush: the 2000 election and the mishaps on the ranch.  Everyone laughs.  Then 9/11 hits.  A masterful use of audio here gives perhaps one of the most eerie accounts of 9/11 that I have witnessed.  As the movie goes on and the enormous ties between Bush and the Saudis are made, you realize that even the people that blast the movie cannot defend against everything.  Even if they refuted half of everything that was said (and I think the facts are pretty solid in the film don’t get me wrong, but people will try to trivialize the film), Bush still deserves to be kicked out office in November if not outright impeached.  For me, I was moved by the grandmother in Iraq in agony and tears after the US bombed their family’s house.  She was one of thousands upon thousands of Iraqi civilians that have died (and don't get me wrong Sadaam was a bad guy) at the hands of the US.  I heard the woman speaking in Arabic over the translation and the words of God that she spoke reminded me of my grandmother and family in Iran.  You know Iran, the other member of the Axis of Evil.  Through the tears and death, I wonder how many 9/11's we have caused.  And for what?  This is one of Moore's central points.  He convincingly shows the overwhelming connections of the Bush and Saudi family and shows the corporations running to eat out of the feeding trough that has become Iraq.  No mistake should be made about this; these corporations are not out to rebuild and make a better Iraq.  They are there to make money.  Halliburton et al. gets ultra inflated contracts while Iraq and the US get screwed.   By the end of the film Moore keeps it coming with a mother that has lost her son in the war.  I won't give away too much but needless to say I can't imagine a single dry tear in that theater.  At the very end we are left with the image of our leader, bumbling like an idiot unable to put together one simple quote, sending the masses to their slaughter for nothing more than selfishness and blatant ideology that their world view is correct.  Fear is a powerful tool indeed.  The theater erupted in applause after the film and rightfully so.  The film is a draining experience, like intimate horrible news on steroids.  We see a unique view of the world in which we live in and that is the inherent and admitted bias of the film.  Still it is a refreshing and sobering look at what we have become and the opportunity to do good in the world after 9/11 that we have squandered.  I quote our illustrious film maker when I say, "Shame on you Mr. Bush!"

         Another night at Nampa bowl with plenty of action.  We were joined this time by Ron Torres.  Mike started with an abysmal showing which continued throughout the night, although he managed a strong comeback at the end.  Mike's low score in bowling was made up for by his high number of fouls.  The foul king gained no fewer than 3 fouls in a row.  Cassie, who was recovering from a cold, showed signs of her illness, but managed a few strong rounds.  Much to her dislike, the nickname Cassaroll and Cassabowl were quickly ruled out.  Constance seemed to be the choice nickname but we'll see if it sticks.  Slashmaster Fallahi had a very strong showing and continued strong for the night.  Bill had a poor showing which was only matched by the newcomer Torres.  Sarah was quiet tonight but pulled out a few solid games.    We were all schooled, however, by a person in our neighboring lane who we shall call "Pimp".  Pimp was an ambidextrous bowler and managed to bowl a 200 in his first game.  We have much to learn about the ways of the lanes.  Until next week!  Read the  urlLink Foul King's  account.

I even learned of a program called pandora which "stresses" the system.  Apparently when NASA wants to test their 1024 node computer cluster they run a full intensive simulation with pandora just to push the machine to the limits.  After a long simulation they deem the computer operational.  The most interesting thing I discovered, however, is that we are the only SGI Tezro owners in the entire Pacific Northwest.

         Well congratulations are in order for Matt and Lindsey on their wedding.  The adventure started bright and early at 7AM as Matt and I helped set up.  A little while into setting things up, hunger took the best of us.  McDonald's it was as we quickly ordered some high carb food.  We then went to the church and got in our tuxedos.  I would like to officially apologize to all women who have ever had to wear corsets.  This is the closest thing we come to it and boy is it a challenge to get dressed.  After snapping a bunch of pictures and making sure Matt did not see his bride, it was time for the wedding.  In the hall I had to give one last hug to Lindsey to wish her well.  The emotions ran high as the father of the bride and various bridesmaids started to tear up.  Lindsey started getting misty eyed but held it together.  I escorted Holly, Lindsey's 8+ month pregnant sister to the alter.  I made sure to walk nice and slow because if we tripped it would be best man down for sure.    The ceremony went on perfectly.  I always feel truly happy when good friends can find true love in this crazy world of ours.  I felt the same at Mike and Cassie's wedding.  In short, it inspires hope in me.  I made the toast speech without fumbling or ending with a Hagadonian "and all that." I just looked back on how long I knew Matt and how happy I was for both of them.  After that it was off in the limo for some pictures.  We hit the Boise Train Depot first to take some pictures.  This was a natural spot since this is where Matt proposed.  We took a variety of pictures (gallery to come soon) of everyone including some cool ones for the groomsmen giving the Bill Clinton political thumbs up.  A craving for champagne led us to go to Winco.  I jumped out in my tuxedo along with two other groomsmen and two bridesmaid.  Arm in arm we pranced through Winco to pick up some bubbly(I stuck with soda).  Avoiding eye contact with the masses of confused shoppers we made it out.  Back at the limo, we circled a while basically hanging out.  Afterwards we headed back to the church were Matt's ride was treated to some wedding style graffiti.  All in all an amazing wedding for some amazing people.  Congrats you two!

       A departure from the norm caused for quite a stir in the group.  Nampa Bowl was full and so we had to migrate to its sister, the Caldwell Bowl.  Much to our dislike we had to pay up front for the shoes.  Mad props to Mike for spotting us some cash.  We arrived just in time to catch the end of a pre-teen party.  Of particular note was a girl of no older than 13 years of age sporting a playboy shirt.  Sigh.  Slash Master Fallahi had a dominate first game and ended strong with a high of 146.  Through some divine intervention for his kindness in spotting us shoe money, Mike schooled us all with a 160.  Bill suffered an abysmal first round of 77 but came back strong.  Sarah was strong and consistent throughout as usual.  Cassie, while giving the Slash Master a scare for brief moments trailed slightly, only to have some very strong frames.  Of particular note tonight was the Caldwell equivalent of our idealized bowling god Cephalot.  Cephalot is a man which hails from the Nampa bowling lanes sporting a wrist brace and none other than a mullet with the shine of a god.  His finesse was challenged by one very, shall we say, round gentleman whom we shall call Tubs.  Tubs is of the Caldwell clan and despite his round physique had the grace of a bowling legend.  Perhaps we may someday see Tubs versus Cephalot.  Oh that would be a thing of beauty.  Good times had by all tonight.  But don't take my word for it.  Hear what  urlLink mikecpeck  has to say.

         I will never forget the time I stood in a bread line in Iran shortly after the Iran-Iraq war.  I was quite young back then but remember vividly the soldiers getting out of the jeep with their machine guns.  The people at the bakery were stunned as these soldiers forced their way to the beginning of the line, took their bread and left.  Needless to say the sheer FEAR kept us all in line.  Resistance to them would surely lead to being hit by a bullet.  Over the past several days I have been listening to the endless tributes to Ronald Reagan and his legacy.  There are many things people cite, including the being the great communicator and the famous phrase “tear down this wall.”  I started thinking about the masses of people that felt compelled to pay tribute to this man, a man whose politics I don’t agree with.  I started wondering what George W. Bush’s legacy would be?  By default any president that was in power during 9/11 would have that be his legacy.  However it is how we dealt with times of hardship and change which form legacy and ultimately greatness (or infamy).  As I thought about this more, I struggled to come up with a definitive item, one concrete thing that could define his presidential legacy.  On Saturday, I marched in the Old Fort Boise Day parade in Parma Idaho.  I marched for the Canyon County Democrats, holding a banner in front of one of the candidate’s cars.  Needless to say we were not welcome.  Many expletives were yelled at us and some even threw candy at us.  As I was belted in the back of the head with what felt to be a tootsie roll or jolly rancher, it hit me what Bush’s legacy ultimately would be.  What drives people to hate someone not of their belief so much that they would want to inflict harm on someone by throwing candy at them?  How bad has it gotten that we must FEAR to express our views because those views are deemed un-American, un Republican/Democrat, or anti-patriotic?  I am still of the optimistic notion, having traveled and lived for brief periods of time in other countries that people, although not directly willing to admit it, like America.  They like what we stand for and like that we can march in parades, express our views, and challenge what we feel we need to challenge.  They like the hope and inspiration that America inspires.  My cousins in Iran ask me tons of questions starting with, “In America, how is…”  They want to learn more and deep down they are pro-American.  Enter the world post 9/11.  The once optimistic United States has turned it’s focus from innovation and open debate to terrorism, all the time, every time.  Our main export is not optimism but FEAR.  Fear that we will die, or you will die, or you must help us make them die.  Terrorist.  Terrorist.  Terrorist.  9/11.  9/11.  And God Bless America.  The Bush legacy in a nutshell.  Now some may view this as harsh or over simplified.  Perhaps it is, but explaining every thing I have seen this administration do is beyond my allowable web space.  I ask, how are those kids that viewed us with such optimism, how are my cousins, now viewing us?  Has our shining beckon of freedom gotten brighter in a world UNITED behind peace, optimism, and hope?  Or have we fallen into the darkness of cynicism, obsession, and secrecy.  Well when the bough breaks, the cradle will fall, and it has fallen.  It has fallen into the darkest realms of pseudo democracy where open debate is seen as weakness, war is seen as necessary, and questioning is seen as treason.  Too extreme?  I listened to John Ashcroft today on CSPAN (basically raw news data for folks like me with no life).  He was grilled on why he was not disclosing a memo discussing the handling of prisoners and definitions of torture by our country.  He argued that HE did not feel that it was the right thing to disclose.  However illustrious Mr. Ashcroft is, the fact remains that his opinion and thoughts are NOT law.  By law and the constitution one must either claim executive privilege (which is from the president) or must cite a specific statute.  Period.  Ashcroft did neither.  He felt it enough to merely say that he didn’t feel it was right.  The information he would give may help the terrorists evade interrogation.  Further, Ashcroft has been quoted as saying that we must not ask questions of the war until after it is over.  This sort of logic reminds us all of much darker times in our world’s history (you draw the comparisons).  The point is that Ashcroft was using FEAR, in this case fear that the terrorist may get useful information, yet by law and the constitution he must exercise one of the two mechanisms if he is not willing to disclose information.  The falling cradle will fall into an abyss of peril if transparency, law, and precedent are trivialized by one man’s “opinion” especially if  that opinion is hinges on exploiting fear.  We must not get on an airplane because the terrorist might be planning their next big attack.  We must be careful of trains.  We must be weary of middle easterners.  Now these are natural reactions to some extent after 9/11 but there are limits.  I could get in my car and get in an accident.  I could get in a plane and have turbulence knock me out of the sky.  I could get E-coli.  I might be suspected of being a terrorist!  (damn I need shave, and fast!)  On 9/11 our world did not change so much as our attitudes towards it.  There were, and always will be terrorists and people that hate America.  We will likely be attacked again and we will do everything in our power to stop that, but certainty is never guaranteed.  We can either blame all our society’s ills on the events of 9/11 (heck our ex-college president blamed our financial crisis on 9/11) or we can give the terrorists the symbolic middle finger, become even more prosperous, and advocate what they fear most, peace and understanding of beliefs different than our own.  We can either talk about terrorism all the time or we can start becoming more optimistic and inspire hope in our friends from other countries.  There is a distinct difference between jealousy in something and inspiring hope.  I think the path we have taken thus far is clear and THAT ultimately will be Bush’s legacy   When our government constantly tells us to be fearful or weary of this and that democracy runs the risk of becoming dictatorship ruled by fear.  When we go to war on the premise of FEAR of mushroom clouds or bioagents we are risking more than just mere emotions.    As for me, although I don’t have to deal with bread lines, I would proudly march in another parade advocating a cause I believe in and FEAR getting hit by candy.  At least it is better than the FEAR of getting hit by bullets.

         A record 6 games were played this week.  Slash Master Fallahi had spotty games with one abysmal round of 94.  The average was 121 for the night.    Still, all of us were put to shame by the bowlers in the next lane.  Key among them was a person we shall call "Bowling Girl."  With finesse and ease she bowled a 206, schooling even our best showing of the night.  After we stopped drooling over the abilities of the bowling goddess we quickly focused our attention to stubby, a pin with its head knocked off.  Apparently this was never seen before by the pin monkey.  What crazy bowling force could knock the top off a pin?  My money is on our power house bowler Mr. Peck.  Because of this oddity, the pin monkey let us keep stubby.  We proudly stood next to him for a photo (to be posted soon).  Oh, great times indeed.  Perhaps we should take classes and really get good at bowling!  I want to gain consistency and form.

         In the Last Samurai we are shown a simple village where the people take pride in whatever they do.  Life is hard but everyone enjoys life through discipline and respect for themselves, others, and nature.  Things are slow and peaceful.  There is a certain elegant simplicity in that way of life.  In a way, I wish we could be more like that.  A few weeks ago I attended the Albertson College graduation and it was surreal to think how fast a year has past and how much things have changed.  After the ceremony I saw a former friend with her significant other holding hands.  This person had probably not gone a month without making out with someone.  When I think about it, I get incredibly depressed.  I feel that way not because of any inherent jealousy but because, just like with Britney and the rest of our pop filled culture, I feel like I am seeing a loss of innocence in our society, a loss of introspection and simplicity.  What does it mean when you can't be alone and always need someone?  What is the meaning of a relationship if you don't give time to really get to know yourself?  Where is the pride and self respect when you jump and smother someone at the drop of a hat?  Ultimately, how can you love someone else if you haven't learned to know and love yourself?  Do people even think about these things anymore amongst the email, traffic, and partying?  Indeed we are in the Britney pop generation and it is an abnormal thing to think such things.  On a subconscious level we are told we must look a certain way, act a certain way, and have certain relationships.  If not, we are out of the norm.  The once innocent self-proclaimed virgin from Louisiana has turned into a sex symbol vixen for the masses of testosterone jacked males to drool over.  Girls whose parents approved of Spears are now seeing their daughters dress like trashy hookers.  College students claim they have outgrown such pop tart fad and ideology but have they?  How many girls dress in provocative clothing to attract men?  Do you think that clothing is influenced at all by our illustrious pop tarts?  How many people truly take pride in what they do instead of saying their job or school sucks?  These same people say go with the flow, be open about things.    In fact the new adult Britney now advocates self expression, openness, and creativity.  But in what capacity?  The perfect figured Britney tells her ordinary fans to drink Pepsi, a sugar filled elixir that does more to hurt people and induce obesity than make them feel better about themselves.  Heaven forbid she advocate drinking fruit juice, that would be too boring and strange.  That’s just not “cool.”  It is not profitable to have Britney advocate making a difference in your community.  Self expression and openness is just another marketing tool to push and sell sex.  A look at most pop lyrics now will have you wondering whether it is a song or sex tape.  Expression and openness (as is being marketed to us) is not thought, innovation, and, cultural exchange.  Rather, it has become a vessel to sell and exploit sex and cheap thrills.  If you are sexy you are cool.  If you are buff you will get chicks.  And if you get chicks you will be happy.  If you are not, you are a prude and are BORING.  And girls, spend even more time on your hair because you really need a man (see former friend above).  Our Pop saturated culture has led people to fear being alone.  Maybe if we were alone, we would realize how asinine things really are and not invest so much in it.  Loneliness is worse than death or at least not profitable.  Enter the tabloids.    Every day feeding us with an ever constant stream of crap about this person dating this person or this person sleeping with this person.  Oh and by the way, our state has the most children living in poverty and half a dozen people were killed in Iraq.  But hey, Jennifer Lopez just got married!  Let’s all take pride in that!  The internet is filled with utter junk mail.  Find a mate!  Find a man or woman to make you happy.    Oh, and we must strive to be stars.  American Idol, The Apprentice, Last Action Hero.  We can't be ordinary we must always reach for the extraordinary.  We will strive for that ONE day where things will turn for us.  That ONE PERFECT day where we can finally live the life we want.  Never reflect on the past your cheeseburger is getting cold!   Most will live and die but never find that day.  Sometimes I just wish we had a simpler life.  I just wish we could all stop, slow things down, and stop looking for that ONE perfect day, opportunity, person, experience, adventure etc.  Still what we tend to overlook amongst the perfect images/pitches that bombard us is that even on our worse days, those experiences will  ultimately steer us to better ones.  At the very least we will be alive.  Consequently the quest for the perfect day is futile. Because ultimately, just like the cherry blossoms, they are all perfect.

       After yet another delcious meal at Que Huong the gang headed out to bowling along with new comers Alan and Ben.  Mike was experiencing the "Que Huong Effect" but managed to pull out a few strong rounds.  Cassie was amazing yet started to slip after a few bad frames.  She pulled back though to finish out strong.  Bill and his insane bowling managed to get his ball in the other person's lane.  I've never scene that one before.  Nice work Starsky.  Sara did well all along it seemed.    The phantom seemed to be upset having swallowed every ball at one point.  Luckily with enough balls in its gut it spit them all out.  Arzhang Slashmaster Fallahi lived up to his reputation slashing his way to a 152 in the last round.  Good times.

         Francis Crick, the co-discoverer of the structure of DNA, died Wed July 28th of Colon cancer. Crick and James Watson discovered the structure of DNA which later earned them the Nobel prize and ignited a revolution in biology. Their discovery, among other things, fueled the $30 billion biotechnology sector and has been responsible for numerous advances in medicine.  Crick in his later days went to the Salk Institute in San Diego and was studying neuroscience. He saw consciousness and the brain as the next big frontier, something that I completely agree with.   It is incredible to think that such an elegant discover could forever change the face of biology. The study of DNA has such far reaching implications, both positive and negative. Crick's work, like Einstein, has the potential for enormous good or unspeakable evil. The path we take is up to us.

We also got to go back behind the machines and take home some free bowling pins.  Can you say shooting targets!?

       Today I got to have a lunch/meeting with Katrina a sales rep for SGI.  It was a really interesting conversation about a lot of things.  She immediately recognized that Idaho was not a state being taken seriously by other schools as far as research goes.  I automatically get respect for people that can see through all the political BS.  Since she is a rep for the entire west coast she covers all of California, Washington, and Oregon.  I must admit I was a bit surprised when she said UW was almost at the very top of all school for all federal funding not just NIH.  SGI is kind of a sad story.  They used to be amazing but anymore they are down to servers mostly.  These servers run on their flavor of Linux.  These Altix units are the newest rage and at Siggraph they are going to present a new graphical version with a partnership with ATI.  The really neat thing about their clusters over other Linux clusters, is the shared memory and high bandwidth.  She was really impressed with the Apple Xgrid system as well.  To give props to Mike, she did mention the biggest weakness of traditional Linux clusters is support.  This is why people still go with SGI.  Since SGI is a company behind a Linux cluster people can call SGI and they support the system.  With other sources, you need to call perhaps Redhat or some other ambiguous entity.  Sure there is the open source community but often academic institutions are strapped for computer scientists so support is crucial.  An interesting cultural thing I noticed was that she said SGI was doing a lot better on the East coast.  People out west are a bit more adventuresome I guess as far as cluster computing goes.  My prediction is that unless SGI evolves rapidly they may be at serious risk of being destroyed.  The advent of Linux, and UNIX systems like OS X threaten them greatly.  Still they have traditionally been the graphics gurus and still have some of that old reputation left.  Perhaps the partnership with ATI will help them since it will be the only system available that supports multiple graphic pipes and they are still a pioneer in real time graphics capabilities.  At any rate, it is always nice to talk with people on the front lines of the computer industry to see how things are evolving.  One thing we both agreed on was that Microsoft is evil.  In fact some schools she said in California are nearly Microsoft free and many academic types use Macs.  My guess is that Linux will be the power computing backbone of the future.  I think Mac is making serious progress and they still might have the best shot at hurting Microsoft on the home computing front.

         It is so great to have my aunt and uncle in town.  Today they went to Yellowstone but they will be back in a few days where I'm sure we will have a great time.  My uncle is my dad's brother and he's probably one of my favorite people in the world, a sort of hero of mine.  He is always in the best of spirits and is even in a similar field as me, pharmacy.  My aunt is also super nice.  Both of them live in Germany and it was really nice to talk to them about Germany and the mood/politics there.  Both my aunt and uncle are extremely educated but are not in academia.  My cousin Anita (who is also my favorite) is 13 and she attends one of the most rigorous schools in Berlin.  At dinner, as is usually the case with me and my extended family, we talked politics.  I asked about what Germans thought of Bush.  Now we all hear reports about how the US is unpopular but man you need to actually hear it from folks that live there.  The utter disgust with which Europe views the US under Bush is nothing less than extraordinary.  They said that Europe marveled at the US under Clinton but now it is the opposite.  My uncle travels a lot for business and even in other countries the US is seen as a laughing stock.  Even my 13 year old cousin was laughing at how "stupid" Bush was and says everyone there says the same thing.  Anyway it will be great to talk to them more about things as they are very well traveled.  More important than all the interesting stories and political talks we have it is just plain nice to see them!  At any rate I just thought I'd share some folks of the Fallahi clan since no one really gets to see my extended family at all because they are spread so far away.

        I just watched Bill Clinton's speech at the Democratic National Convention. The guy is absolutely amazing. He is the most charismatic speaker I have seen and a damn bright guy. I turned to all the news stations afterwards and even Fox News was going gaga over his speech. I even heard a Fox News reporter say "He is good!" I don't understand how we can go from him to what we have now. The Republicans could have done a lot better. The democrats could do better as well I suppose. Kerry. Sigh. I'm of the mind, as one comedian once said, to go to Clinton's door with a cigar and say "stick it wherever you want but please come back!"

       I spotted Daisy from Que Huong at Costco.  I naturally did what any in our Que Huong clan would do, I followed her to see what she was getting.  What goodies would she be putting into the cart.  Yet, for all my asinine reconnaissance my encounter with Daisy was truly moving.  When she saw my mom and me she immediately gave us hugs and we could see that she was quite upset.  She immediately told us how her mom had an advanced stage of cancer that was undetected before.  She had tears in her eyes at this point and said she was going to close the restaurant in a few weeks while she took her mom to Vietnam.  I know the trip will not be one of fun.  She was very worried that business would not return when she reopens the restaurant after she comes back.  I reassured her that my friends would always be there.  I'm not sure how everyone out there feels but that place holds a special place for me.  I'm thinking of giving her a card signed by us regulars.  Also I was thinking it would be cool, and I'm thinking Bill might be good for this, to have a bunch of ACI kids come when the restaurant reopens.  I think it would be nice to give something back to such a nice lady.  An almost identical situation happened to my grandfather and it is a devastating ordeal.  Let's do something special for our Que Huong!

       Spiderman has the Green Goblin, Superman has kryptonite, and I have the stomach flu.  Yes Friday was truly a hellish day.  I woke up not feeling so hot with a churning stomach.  I called my parent's at work stating that I thought I was going to be ill.  Having nearly died from a stomach flu as a baby and having an incredibly debilitating ordeal with it as a freshman in college they rushed home.  Shortly after I began throwing up.  I didn't want to take any chances so I rushed to the doctor.    I was feeling better but shortly after we got there I started throwing up again.  I got an injection of anti nausea medicine, a blood and urine test.  Shortly after that I threw up again.  By this point I was so incredibly dehydrated that I insisted that I needed to get an IV just as I had my freshman year.  In a strange coincidence the doctor treating me was an alumna from UW, go figure.    At any rate the nurse butchered my arm trying to get the needle in but still couldn't.  I was getting worse so the doctor alerted the hospital that I was on my way.  My folks helped me walk in the door but I was too dehydrated and drained and literally collapsed.  My dad had no choice but to pick me up ER style and carry me to the emergency room.  The nurse immediately gave me an IV.  They gave me no fewer than 3L of fluid (that's over 6 lbs of liquid if you are keeping track).  Yes when you have the stomach flu it sucks to be skinny (damnation).  They also gave me some antibiotics to try to kill the little shits that were doing this to me.  They drew some more blood to check my organ functions which all came back as normal (thank goodness).  I lacked pain so they ruled out appendicitis.  I was so incredibly dizzy and weak from the drugs I barely remember coming home.  I haven't thrown up since and can keep down liquids and simple foods.  Yeah!  I'm feeling a lot better this morning but I never want to go through that hell again.  Blah!

       Not to toot my own horn but I went and looked at the 10 finalists for the DNC ad competition.  I was not on there but worse than that most of the entries violated the rules!  I was so darn scared to use any copyrighted footage or music that it really forced me to use a limited selection of material.  Imagine my surprise when I see entries using music from U2!  Worse than that they have stock footage used that I'm almost sure they didn't secure the rights for.  Heck if it was this open I would have had so many more options.  The showings on the site are incredibly horrible as well.  Unlike moveon.org these ones lack any charisma.  I'm a bit pissed because I should have just used any darn footage I wanted and come up with a really cool video.  I hate copyright!!! Argh!  I'm with Moore on this one.  The Democratic party, based on the videos I've seen is a wussy party, but they are better than the alternative.  Here is the link for the  urlLink videos .  You may have to register.

       The 9/11 commissions report comes out today and it will be an interesting thing to study to see how we can improve our national security.  Yet again, it seems as though the Fair and Balanced news station Fox is using the findings to attack Michael Moore.  The other day I heard a report that said the commission's findings dispute a claim Moore made in the movie about the Bin Laden family terrorist ties.  To me the way it was presented was completely misleading.  If you actually WATCH the film (and I have twice) Moore never says that Bin Laden's family members in the US were terrorists.  The farthest he goes is stating that some of the family members attended a wedding of Bin Laden's son.  Some may argue that the FBI cleared these people; they were good to go.  Is this the same FBI that just days before had the biggest security breach in history, the same one who claimed mushroom clouds and WMDs?  Given that they were cleared Moore's point still holds.  The question Moore brings up is why preferential treatment was given to the Saudi's?  Was it because Bush et al. Had a vested interest in them.  This isn't some conspiracy theory conjecture but goes down to the simple business concept of a conflict of interest.  Personally, I have no sympathy for the Saudi's as they are an oppressive corrupt government.  But I also don't stand to make any money off of them.    Heck they were destroying Mosques after 9/11 but I didn't have any government escorts protecting my family.  The point is that people like to use Moore as a punching bag because it is easy to cast him as some wild propagandist.  Sure the movie comes from its own angle but so far most if not all the facts that I have heard in dispute are things that aren't directly stated in the film.  At best, they are conclusions people make given as fact.  If you haven't watched the movie don't try to claim the facts are out of whack because those facts in contention are likely not even in the film.

Our group was quite large this time and newcomer Audi had an amazing last round.  Bill managed a few strong rounds along with Mike and Cassie.  Sarah managed to fall on the floor of the bowling alley only to get up and give hell to the pins.  Nice work done by all, the Slashmaster needs to pull it together though.

       I know what you are all thinking, it is a Monday and you went bowling?  Yes I did!  Matt and I had a bowling showdown at the ol' Nampa bowl.  Slashmaster Fallahi was in fine form slashing to a 156 in the second round and dominating all three rounds.  Matt had difficulties adjusting to the new environment of the Nampa Bowl so it was a bit unfair.  He narrowed the gap at the end but still failed to take out the Slashmaster.  Lindsey watched from the side lines and acted as a cheerleader but alas no amount of cheering could help the struggling grad student to "engineer" a strike.  Nice game all around.  Good times.

        They say that a lot of culture is seen on porches in America.&nbsp; Whether it is a nice cool night breeze or a casual sipping of beverage with friends, there are many memories that are forged there.  &nbsp;  My friend John Reuter had his 21st birthday and so Ron Torres and I ventured up to New Meadows to visit him.&nbsp; Much to my delight Mr. Zach Hagadone was also present.&nbsp; He has to be one of the coolest guys I have met except the fact that he doesn't keep in contact very well.&nbsp; As we pulled up to the porch Reuter gave us a traditional welcome of beating Ron up and throwing me to the ground.&nbsp; To many this may have seemed crazy but if you know Reuter you would understand.&nbsp; I greeted Zach with the traditional hand shake and scolded him for not staying in contact.&nbsp; We sat there for a few hours.&nbsp; Some drank, but mostly it was just conversation about what was going on with our lives and the world.&nbsp; As I sat on that porch with my friends it hit me again how much I was going to miss them when I go off to school.&nbsp; It wasn't the alcohol that brought us together; it was a certain unspoken understanding.  &nbsp;  We ventured to McCall to a local bar.&nbsp; I had not been to McCall before but it took me all of ten seconds to get the lay and feel of the land.&nbsp; This place had pretentiousness written all over it.&nbsp; It was beautiful but more importantly knew that it was beautiful.&nbsp; The shops seemed to be catered to tourists; the ornate ice rink symbolized the wealth in this relatively small town.&nbsp; The bar we went to was quite large consisting of multiple floors.&nbsp; It sat on the edge of a lake and as we arrived, the lights reflected from the surface of the water.&nbsp; We made our way through the bar and many of the people and attitudes I saw reminded me of my Boise adventure.&nbsp; Although the difference here was that the wealth was palpable.  &nbsp;  We sat on the docks as some in the group, mainly birthday boy and Chris drank way too much alcohol.&nbsp; I just sat there quietly enjoying the company.&nbsp; A loud ruckus started to form behind us and we suddenly heard splashes in the water.&nbsp; Everyone's attention turned to the group behind us when Zach casually mentioned, "Whoa that's a naked woman swimming."&nbsp;  &nbsp;  That's right the bimbi had reached there critical alcohol intake level and were stripping naked and jumping in the lake.&nbsp; Some of the water splashed on us and Zach remarked, "That is naked woman water."&nbsp; Indeed it was.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  What would drive people to act like that is beyond me and I don't even want to try to explain it.&nbsp; At any rate, it did happen and when they denied Chris’ invitation to humiliate John we made our way out of the bar.&nbsp; Zach and I were the first out and stood waiting for the others to come out.&nbsp; Some of the aforementioned individuals were stumbling about so it slowed the group.  &nbsp;  Yet, one of the most memorable and comforting moments that night was when I was standing there waiting for our group with Zach.&nbsp; Whenever I exit a bar I always have the same insecurity that I am somehow abnormal and that I don't quite fit into this crazy generation of mine.&nbsp; What was I missing, why was I acting so darn lame?&nbsp; As I turned to Zach he shook his head and I knew he understood.  &nbsp;  As the night wore on and the alcohol continued to flow the prospect of morning brought about the realization that I had to come back home.&nbsp; As an exhausted Ron and I made our way to the car, despite all that had gone on, I couldn't help but long for more time on that porch in New Meadows.

        With limited resources the government must choose who to go after when they do something wrong.&nbsp; We should target those who pose the greatest risk to society.&nbsp; To go after an elderly woman in a sea of corporate crime, who made a proportionally trivial mistakes, is just beyond me.&nbsp; Some say that we have set an example and that now other corporate CEOs will think twice before doing insider trading.&nbsp; Because if Martha can get caught so can you.&nbsp; Really, or are they just laughing their asses off that they didn't get caught as they sip champagne at their latest multimillion dollar party.&nbsp; I'm thinking you Tyco executives!&nbsp; Was this the battle worth fighting when there are infinitely worse cases out there.&nbsp; Why make an example out of Martha Stewart.&nbsp; Is it because she is so "sweet" so people will know that no one is safe.&nbsp; Granted, but how many lives did she destroy.&nbsp; How much did she hurt society, let's think practically here.&nbsp; She wasn't in the same league as Ken Lay et al.&nbsp; Let's not even go into Haliburton.&nbsp; Everyone agrees that Iraq has to be rebuilt but to exploit the death of soldiers with outrages contract prices is ridiculous.&nbsp; Why aren't we going after them with the same fervor as we do Martha?&nbsp; I'm waiting for a response US government, and especially from our illustrious Dick Cheney.  &nbsp;  It's sad indeed when we pick the seemingly trivial battles.&nbsp; Whether it's going after an elderly woman for a minute amount of insider trading or raising hell because there is a cross on a city shield.&nbsp; Why don't we pick the battles that truly make an impact on society.&nbsp; Why aren't we putting as much passion into fighting the myriad corporate crooks?&nbsp; Why aren't we blasting the blood sucking corporations in Iraq (and yes we do need them to rebuild but come on at least be somewhat scrupulous about the contracts)?&nbsp; Should the ACLU spend so much time and money fighting a county in California for having a cross on its logo shield or should they spend that money to combat truly racist and unfair practices in the work place.&nbsp; Perhaps it is as simple as we just love to fight no matter what the scale.&nbsp; Maybe it was more convenient to go after Martha&nbsp; because she wouldn't fight back as hard.&nbsp; Perhaps it is more complex than that but I will end it there.&nbsp; Whatever the case, it's a sad time indeed.&nbsp; Where have our priorities gone?

       The Slashmaster was having an off night but managed to get a few good rounds in.  The real story of the night was Mike bowling a group high of 183!  Bill also had a phenomenal game of 170.  The women of the group didn't do so hot tonight perhaps because they were angry at Mike and Bill being distracted by some, how shall we put it, "skanky" young girls in the lane next to us.  Apparently these girls weren't scared of showing more skin than clothing, smoking like a chimney, and drinking like a sailor.  The alley had some weird folk today who were drunk and awfully loud.  The riff raff harassed us a few times tonight but we just ignored them. At any rate good times and congrats to Funkmasta MCP for a great game!

       A lot of folks have been bashing Moore for factual errors in Fahrenheit 9/11.  Even I thought that some places had to be false like the part where he mentioned that Bush was sleeping the night before 9/11 on fine French Linens.  Well leave it to Moore to defend himself.  He has sited tons of facts in dispute.  Check it out  urlLink here .  Also the sources he has are pretty diverse, and yes he even has a source for Bush sleeping on French linens the night before 9/11.  Although many are angered by the various implied statements Moore makes, Moore and Lion Gate Films still stand by their assertion that there is not a single factual error in the film.  Indeed the citations of his research are quite impressive.  But even in the worse case scenario, if there was a factual error in the film at least no one was sent to die because of it.  Oh, was that out of line?

       Was it all just a dream?  In my 23 years on this planet was I not part of this generation?  My friend Ron Torres and I decided to go see Anchorman on Friday and then went to downtown Boise to hang out and people watch.  A masochistic exercise to be sure, but nonetheless incredibly interesting from a sociological perspective.  Whereas Anchorman was a fictitious comedy, the comedy we observed that night was real.  Here we were two ordinary guys.  We put little to no attention on our appearance and walked the streets of Boise.  The cornucopia of people was mind numbing.  The girls all seemed to dress identically.  No sleeves and ample cleavage.  The pants were either extraordinarily tight or the skirts dangerously high.  The males were dressed in either khaki shorts or faded jeans with dress shirts or tightly fitting shirts to show off the "guns."  As we walked the street it appeared to be a matrix of consistency.  Everyone was dressed the same, the attitudes were the same, the atmosphere implicit.  The atmosphere was sexual.  The attire of the girls begged guys to approach them while the flirtatious approaches by both sides ensured a hook up or at least a good one night lay.  Ron and I sat at the corner of a bar outside people watching, wondering what it were these people did and why we didn't fit in.  Needless to say not a single unknown person so much as made eye contact with us, but we didn't even try.  As we watched, the sounds and smells of the night enhanced the overly pretentious mood of our bastardized culture in the U.S.  The smell on the street was a mix of hot dogs, alcohol, and perfume coupled with a slight hint of animalistic sweat and pheromones.  A small music group stood on the corner playing the drums in a constant but erotic beat.  Girls were grinding against guys swinging their hips in a blatantly sexual manner as the guys fondled them.  Next to us a girl was discussing her guy problems to her other girlfriends.  Her large diamond ring and Gucci bag reminded me and Ron of our place in this pretentious microcosm.  The conversation was self centered, the clothing self indulging, the entire attitude extravagant.  I immediately remarked to Ron how that one Gucci bag could likely feed a small village in Africa.  But international politics were not on the agenda this evening.  What were these people thinking?  What was the other girl across from us thinking as she was kissing her boyfriends bare chest as he stood there without a shirt.  What were the girls in ultra short skirts and low cut blouses doing?  Perhaps it was all in good fun.  A fun end to a hard week of work.  But where did they work and more importantly how much were they contributing to society proportional to their extravagant drinking and clothing habits.  Perhaps they were trying to live a dream, find true love, someone to have a connection with.  Indeed the blowing of cigarette smoke by a certain typically dressed guy, in a girl's face was sign of affection.  Perhaps this was a hidden code that I had not picked up on in my years.  This guy would get the girl but what I came to realize is that deep down, despite the girls being incredibly attractive, I didn't want them.  Ironically, I wondered how many of these cigarette smoking kids I would later have to treat for cancer as  a doctor.  The same folks not saying hi would ultimately be who I would have to help.  But such is the way of love of something greater than you.  Ron commented that perhaps these people felt unloved and were desperately trying to find someone to love them.  I immediately commented that these were among the most fortunate and "loved" people in the world.  They had food, clothing and shelter yet felt sorry for themselves; why they couldn’t find someone to hook up with.  The real problem was not a sense of being unloved but rather a sense of being unappreciative.  But again, this was not a night of perspective and introspection.  No one was concerned about the countless poor and homeless in most of the world.  The world my fellow youth lived in was much different.  How would the night end?  The clothing, the flirtation, the erotic dancing had to lead to some end.  Indeed many of these folks would hook up tonight.  They would get what their attire begged.  Perhaps if I worked out and dressed “cool” I could have the same.  I could use my brain to pick up the countless apparent bimbi that pranced around.  Still as I struggled to get a hold of what my generation was all about I realized I needed to study them more.  I would need to sit back and observe the meat markets, the in-depth pseudo culture of the “entertain us” Nirvana generation.  Still I left that night knowing that when I woke up in my bed I wouldn’t be saying that I wish this was just a dream.

       Well since I don't officially work now and am getting rest before the grind of med school, I decided to get some things done.    I started the morning busting out the old violin.  It's been a while since I played and it was nice to meet the old fiddle again.  I've been working on the Mendelssohn violin concerto in E Minor which is really quite difficult.  At one point my old violin teacher said it was her dream that someday I would be able to play it.  It will take a while though but progress is being made.  Next I managed to wash two loads of laundry.  I need the practice.  After that I was off to the post office to mail off some things for Matt and Lindsey's wedding party in Iowa.  It was off to KFC after that for some good ol' fashion fried chicken.  When I paid they asked for my name and I knew this was going to be interesting.  I waited in the corner waiting for the butchering to begin.  I got up when they called something that sounded like Tarzan.  I quickly made it to Edwards where I went to see Spiderman 2.  As a bonus I won a free popcorn using my special movie card.  Score!  The previews were too numerous and I've seen all of them before.  No A Cinderella Story previews (darn!) for this film, just the standard Bourne Supremacy, I Robot etc etc.  Spiderman 2 was amazing.  It may be one of the best comic book movies I've seen.  Incredible character development is unusual for a film of this kind but they really went all out.  As an added bonus the effects were seamless and awe inspiring.  If you don't have money now definitely see it at the dollar theatre.  Anyway pretty relaxing day.  Plus Kerry chose a running mate that will help him beat Bush!  Good times.

Enjoy the comfort of the white house Bush et al. for you won't have it for long!

         Well we had a grand old time at my house celebrating the fourth with Bill, Sarah, Mike, Cassie, and Ben.  We had a Persian dinner followed my some good old fashion fireworks.  Mike had to try his new camera out on the fire display and so Starsky and Hutch (Arzhang and Bill respectively) went to work.  As you can see Bill is literally a man on fire!  Check out the pictures here:  Gallery  urlLink 1   urlLink 2   urlLink 3

         This was indeed a historical moment - Saddam before a court being accused of his many crimes.  The story was sad on so many levels.  For one, who was in charge of that court?  Saddam looked far more in charge than that naive young judge they put in there.  Who's brilliant idea was it to have a judge in there that would tolerate so much insolence from Saddam.  Also, the airing of the tape frustrated just as many as it seemed to please.  Those frustrated said Saddam looked too comfortable.  Those pleased said he was getting what he deserved.    Perhaps the most sad thing about all of this is how somewhere down the road this "human being" was abandoned, led astray on a path towards the demise of himself and thousands of others.  From childhood Saddam was trained and ordered to go steal chickens.  At a young age, thus, he was shown that actions don't have consequences.  A politcal atmosphere made it so that he could come to power.  After he murdered thousands (and believe me he went to war with Iran so I hate this guy as much as any one) he still doesn't feel that there should be consequences.  He feels he has done nothing wrong.  He remains defiant, arrogant, and steadfast.    The part I remembered most yesterday was when they read all the things Saddam was accused of doing, including the mass murder of thousands of people.  In a brief moment, with all the arrogance for a split second forgotten, I could see a small watering of the eyes.  Perhaps this person, at some point was human and compassionate.  Now nothing can save him, the consequences have caught up.  It all makes you wonder how many other young kids are stealing chickens, not realizing that actions have consequences.  Perhaps the ultimate legacy of this war will not be the Saddam we captured and brought down but the new one that we may have created.

       A rather hostile encounter with a pudgy legged bowling lady at Nampa forced us to move to Caldwell Bowl tonight.  Slashmaster Fallahi had some problems in the beginning but finished with a strong 150 tying Bill a.k.a. "Hutch".  Sarah did quite well through out finishing second place overall behind the Slashmaster.  Cassie managed to beat the Slashmaster in one round much to her enthusiasm.  Mike powerhouse Peck had difficulties tonight.  It seemed his mind was elsewhere, perhaps on a new purchase (of a Canon Rebel digital camera) he had recently made.  Good times!

       I presented my tips for the MCAT to a group of pre-med folk today at Albertson College. There were a ton of people from the University of Washington and WWAMI so it was nice to get to see them. I talked about how to prepare for the MCAT. Upon Kendra's request here are the books I read to prepare for the verbal reasoning section of the MCAT:  Stupid White Men Brave New World Fahrenheit 451 The Communist Manifesto  Afterwards the book of discussion for my interview at UW was Nazi Doctors. Disturbing to say the least, but so is applying to medical school although the advising is a TON better now. I'm sure ACI will shine in the future. Good luck!

       Well tonight was fun but sad. It was the last time we would all go out for our traditional weekly bowling. Alas I have to move next week and this is a tradition I will sorely miss. The night was great fun. Bill had some incredible rounds but the rest of us were pretty mediocre. I managed to get an unreal number of 9s which was kind of frustrating but I think I am starting to get a feel for form even though I haven't mastered it. We went for ice cream afterwards at Cold Stone which was really great.  I must admit it was a bit nostalgic to think of all the memories and people in that bowling alley. So many people: Cephalot, Tree Trunks, Sweaty Randy, Helen, Pimp, Bubba, Bowling Girl, McVeigh. I'm sure I'm missing some too!  Now I'm sure there will be lots of bowling alleys but there will not be any quite like the Nampa Bowl and surely there will never be as cool a bowling group as Mike, Cassie, Bill, and Sarah. I can only hope that we will meet up some day and all bowl together again. I'm thinking if they visit, we can get together some weekends and bowl.  Moving is bittersweet because you have to give up the things you are familiar with and enjoy. The sweet part is that I have a bunch of really great friends that I have shared great memories with and will continue to do so forever. So, for at least a while, this is Slashmaster signing out.

        Well if Dave can post articles about skin care products, I can post one about this. I bought this really nice shaver the other day, the Norelco Cool Skin 7735X.  For those of us who have to shave you know that it can be an irritating ordeal especially if you need to shave very often. Being of foreign decent and having a beard, uh, not too hot of an idea.  Razors get closest but kill your skin and often cause bleeding. Electrical razors are good but don't get close enough. This new shaver I bought dispenses lotion so you don't get any razor burn and it shaves pretty darn close because of the lotion.  Your skin also stays really cool instead of getting hot like with razors or other electrical razors. Plus it can be used completely wet in the shower or completely dry. I think it's a pretty good deal especially if you need to shave frequently.

        It appears that Steve Jobs underwent surgery for pancreatic cancer. It was a very rare form that was caught early so he should be just fine. The memo he sent Apple employees can be found  urlLink here .  I love the P.S. he put at the end of the memo:    PS: I'm sending this from my hospital bed using my 17-inch PowerBook and an Airport Express.

       My aunt and uncle were in town and the past two days we have been grilling up a storm.  My uncle taught me the ways of how to properly cook kabobs.  It is truly and art to be mastered.  Perhaps one day I will learn the ways of the master.  The photos show some of the highlights.  I will have a photogallery of their visit posted soon.
