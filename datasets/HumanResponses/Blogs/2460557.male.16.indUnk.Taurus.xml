      Hart's Rant of the Day: Fat Chicks-By A3  Ok so first off, im not going to apologize for what im about to say. I dont give a rats ass if your fat or if your mom is fat so shut it. I dont hate fat people; a lot of mine are lard asses. So dont bitch to me or Mark about your glandular problem. This is meant to be a rambling story. What im gonna talk about here is fat people who a) are simply fucking lazy and then bitch about being fat or b) people who are fat and think they are skinny.  Alright group one: fat lazy fucks. Dont get me wrong being lazy rules. Im lazy all the god damn time. Doing shit fucking blows. But you know what I dont do? I dont spend my day cramming Big Macs and bags of Cheetos by the fucking bagful along with drinking root beer and then complain that im fat. Shut the fuck up if you do this. It is your own god damn fault you look like lard is dripping off you. This stupid ass whose suing McDonalds needs to stop jacking himself off all damn day, he needs to haul his fat ass to the gym and work off the fucking fat. Too bad if Americas standard of beauty is for skinny chicks. Be fat and love it for all I care. But dont go expecting to have wild sex every fucking night.  Group 2 are fucking disgusting. You all know who im talking about. Its those stupid fat chicks who think “Yeah! I do what I want! I can wear a thong!” and they do so. FUCKING STOP. Your not making any body hot for you, you look disgusting. Its simply fucking revolting to see a fat chick in a thong, with the fat dripping out. Bleech. Or with the belly shirts when it looks like it took 3 illegal immigrants to shove their lard form into that damn tube top. Like what are you expecting? The fucking beauty standard to suddenly change and some ripped latino throw you down right there in the mall and butt fuck you till you bleed? Here is a tip: ITS NOT YOU DUMB FAT FUCK. GO TO THE GODFORSAKEN GYM AND WORK OFF THAT DISGUSTING SHIT DRIPPING OFF YOUR SIDES. YOU PEOPLE MAKE ME CHOKE ON MY OWN BILE. YOU ARE THE REASON I AVOID THE MALL. HOPEFULLY YOULL EAT YOUR WAY INTO A HEARTATTACK and they can bury your fat ass!   In conclusion, fat people have 2 choices. Stop their fucking complaining and be happy with taking a shit on the toilet while eating ice cream by the gallonful. Or fucking do something with their life to make sure their not fat. There im done.  by the ever-famous-uber-cool   A3

      John's Rant of the Day: Saddam Hussein  Recently we have captured the leader of Iraq Suddam Hussein. Will capturing him really change anything?  I believe that nothing will change. Some people are saying "Now that Saddam Hussein is captured terrorist attacks will be less organized." But Saddam has been hiding under a rug for the past few months. But actually terrorist attacks are more organized than ever.  Also since Saddam Hussein was captured violence has increased. "US forces shot dead 11 attackers who ambushed them in Samarra, northwest of Baghdad, in an upsurge of violence in restive Iraqi towns and as debate raged over the fate of captured former president Saddam Hussein. ( urlLink Yahoo! News - Deadly violence rages in Iraq after Saddam Hussein's capture ). In a separate attack, approximately 30 Iraqis began firing on a unit returning from a weapons cache, the unit returned fire killing one of the attackers."  People also have been saying that "Now that we have captured Saddam Hussein we will finally have some questions answered." HA suck for people who think that, because guess what? He isnt talking!  Yeah thats aboot it

      The lyrics for Stairway To Heaven   There's a lady who's sure all that glitters is gold  And she's buying a stairway to heaven.  When she gets there she knows, if the stores are all closed  With a word she can get what she came for.  Ooh, ooh, and she's buying a stairway to heaven.   There's a sign on the wall but she wants to be sure  'Cause you know sometimes words have two meanings.  In a tree by the brook, there's a songbird who sings,  Sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiven.  Ooh, it makes me wonder,  Ooh, it makes me wonder.   There's a feeling I get when I look to the west,  And my spirit is crying for leaving.  In my thoughts I have seen rings of smoke through the trees,  And the voices of those who stand looking.  Ooh, it makes me wonder,  Ooh, it really makes me wonder.   And it's whispered that soon if we all call the tune  Then the piper will lead us to reason.  And a new day will dawn for those who stand long  And the forests will echo with laughter.   If there's a bustle in your hedgerow, don't be alarmed now,  It's just a spring clean for the May queen.  Yes, there are two paths you can go by, but in the long run  There's still time to change the road you're on.  And it makes me wonder.   Your head is humming and it won't go, in case you don't know,  The piper's calling you to join him,  Dear lady, can you hear the wind blow, and did you know  Your stairway lies on the whispering wind.   And as we wind on down the road  Our shadows taller than our soul.  There walks a lady we all know  Who shines white light and wants to show  How everything still turns to gold.  And if you listen very hard  The tune will come to you at last.  When all are one and one is all  To be a rock and not to roll.   And she's buying a stairway to heaven.

      Hart's Rant of the Day: Why George Bush ought to Die  Lately, I have come to truly look forward to getting out of highschool and college and into the world of Law and Politics primarily because of one person. George Walker Bush. This man is the epitomy of the low-class-piece-of-shit president. Hes not educated, hes a fundamentalist christian (sorry mike, john), he is ugly, hes misinformed, and he....is a republican. On education, the public has already seen his blatant stupidity. "we need GOODER education for all the young peoples in this glorious land." hahaha...i always laugh when i hear that quote. Also, in every single one of his speeches, he appears to me to be a trained monkey, squeaking (and ?sqawking?) for more bananas. The stupid bitch...even his speech writers have to dumb up what they write so it sorta seems like he cares about the country (and that he wrote his own speech...which of course he didnt). As a declared fundamentalist baptist, George Bush really scares me. What "fundamentalist baptist" means is...he believes that every word in the bible is the complete truth. If fundamentalists would at least admit the fact that the bible has been poorly translated from Greek, Hebrew, and Arameac into Latin and then English, i might actually accept them into "my idea" of society. However, they dont. And therefore are not the kind of people that i wud take seriously...ever....unless of course they are burning people at the stake in the name of God...or...as in Mr. Bush's Case, MAKING HOLY WARS TO TAKE OVER THE PROMISED LAND! It all started with a great excuse to make war...the destruction of the world trade center. For all i know, bush is paying taliban to blow things up so he can take over the entire MIDDLE EAST. Whatever god is telling bush to blow people up and kill his own citizens does not deserve to be worshipped. GEORGE BUSH IS AN UGLY MAN....yes he is. Also, a president should not be misinformed, or taken the advantage of by his cabinet and other advisors. his assistants obviously have realized how dumb he is and are taking the advantage of him. (whisper: HEY LETS BLOW UP THIS COUNTRY (iraq) TO TEST ALL OF OUR NEW WEAPONS AND COMPLETELY IGNORE THE NUCLEAR THREAT TO OUR COUNTRY ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WORLD) Finally, Bush is a republican. This in and of itself should make half the country...well more than half...(gore won majority of votes) HATE HIS FRICKING GUTS. he wants to kill the trees....TREES MAKE OXYGEN WE NEED THEM DAMMIT...hes against gun control...WE NEED TO CONTROL GUNS U STUPID BITCHES...THEY KILL PEOPLE...and he is anti-abortion...HOW WUD U LIKE IT IF U GOT RAPED AND U HAD TO HAVE THE KID OF UR RAPIST?!?!?!?!?!   George should just lay down and die....  Here are some quotes from ur fellow students on the subject:  youknowwho417: i hate bush more than a cat hates a bathtub full of cold water.  DMcT846: george bush's thanksgiving escapade in Iraq was nothing more then another photo op!!! the bastard!  EVANGELI0N pilot: George Bush blows the penis off of your grandmother.  SockerAnGeL62: George bush can kiss my naturally white ass  youknowwho417: i hate bush more than a zombie squirrel hates rotten nuts.  Cat0607: i think he looks like a monkey...only w/ less hair   dropdedgorgous4: well hes so dumb he choked on a pretzel watching a football game  Hrogndzeln: "He should of died on that pretzel. Man, that would be the way for him to go. Someone assassinate him!"  wow...looks like no one likes him

       urlLink Weekly World News : BARBECUES will no longer be a regular stop on the campaign trail if a leading sociologist has his way. The expert says only vegetarians should be allowed to run for public office -- including the presidency!   "Bone-biters are too aggressive, too prone to physical violence and too quick to pick a fight," declares Dr. Anthony Weltz of Cleveland.  "In short, they're unsuited to public office -- and unfortunately, that includes our current President George W. Bush, an unrepentant carnivore with a well-known affinity for Texas steak.  "By contrast, vegetarians are much more placid, nonaggressive and empathetic toward others. They are the ideal people to lead this nation and pursue the goal of world peace."   Such a criterion, if imposed, would trim the current field of presidential contenders considerably, leaving only Democratic Congressman Dennis Kucinich, an avowed vegetarian, as a possible commander-in-chief.  "I'm not in the business of endorsing particular candidates, but Mr. Kucinich's public statements about Bush's reckless invasion of Iraq -- which is swiftly leading our nation to ruin -- certainly indicate a far less belligerent mindset," the sociologist says.  Dr. Weltz, himself a longtime vegan, argues that people who chose a vegetarian diet tend to be more sensitive and humane. Moreover, the very act of eating animal flesh promotes a more primal, bestial mentality.  "You are what you eat," Dr. Weltz explains. "When you routinely rip apart animal flesh with your teeth like a jungle predator, the most base and primitive part of your brain is activated and takes control.  "Restricting oneself to a vegetarian diet ensures that the most civilized part of the brain -- the part responsible for agriculture, art, barter and great cities -- comes to the fore."  Dr. Weltz points to the many examples of great vegetarian leaders, ranging from India's Mahatma Gandhi, a universally revered man of peace, to famed women's suffrage crusader Susan B. Anthony.   "In addition, many great thinkers, including Confucius, Leonardo da Vinci and Henry David Thoreau were vegetarians," Dr. Weltz reveals. "A body that's meat-free means a mind uncluttered by savage impulses."   The expert says people often try to play "gotcha" with him by pointing out that Nazi warmonger Adolf Hitler was also a vegetarian.   "That's a misconception. Hitler only pretended to be a vegetarian as part of his public image as the 'spiritually pure' father of his nation," Dr. Weltz insists. "In reality, he was a bone-biter from way back and he loved his bratwurst and beer as much as any other German."  I just found that pretty interesting....perhaps true?

      Rant of the Day: Why the Oprah Winfrey Show Suxorz my Nutsorz  Dear Fellow Raleigh Charter Students,            I am sure that in one of your many telelvision watching ventures, you have come across the so called "opray winfrey show." This disgusting example of "entertainment" makes me want to retch every time i see it. First of all, ya know how oprah has this thing with getting ugly people, putting them on her show, and saying they are beautiful. This pisses me off, simply because THEY ARENT BEAUTIFUL. hey oprah, i have an idea, lets take a 400 pound tub of lard lady and tell the blunt truth. "you're an ugly bitch and its ur own fault that ur dripping over the sides of the chair ur sitting in so go drown in ur own vomit, or eat ur self to death." Im sick and tired of these shows that are aired over and over again....the exact same thing happens every episode, just new faces on the characters. episode 1: im so glad u had ur epiphany bla bla bla bla bla.... UR a true american hero.....episode 2: u r truly beautiful inside, and a hero to everyone of us......episode 3: yada yada yada im giving away all my money to u beautiful people who suffer for others.........ARGH I WANNA KILL MYSELF ALREADY.......the end

      What we did at Mikes house:  After the party on Sunday Kaj, Hart, Mike, and I all went to Mikes house, this is what we did:  1. We started out making a song using Mikes awesome computer program called...I forgot. Well any way, the song kicked ass, and we didnt even finish it.  2. We went out side and burnt some of Mikes old clothing. We found a stick on a tree (go figure) and we pulled it off and tied one of Mikes pants to it. We then swung (is that a word?) it around in circles having a great time.  Then Mike said "Hey this is this Asian mans house, and he has a pool in his front yard, lets throw this torch into it." Hart, Kaj, and I all though it was a great idea. So like idiots we all ran down the Asian mans drive way, and threw the torch into the pool. Kaj then yelled "Quick! We have been I.D." (I doubt we were) so we then ran back to Mikes house.  3. Things slowed down, and Hart, Kaj, and I played Halo for about an hour. That was grand fun, it was Kaj and Hart vs. Me (I beasted them). After that grand fun, we went down stairs and had a milk shake (good stuff).  4. Kaj, Hart, and I were tired of sitting around, we wanted to burn some stuff. Kaj saw some toilet paper sitting around and said "hey lets burn that" and we all agreed it would look cool. We also took a tennis ball with us. Mike decided that we should hit a flaming tennis ball around so, Hart got a skate board, Kaj got a baseball bat, and Mike had a crappy tennis racquet, I had nothing.  We doused the tennis ball in gas and set it on fire, it looked kinda cool (just a flaming ball). Mike then tried to get it into the air, so Kaj could hit it, but the ball had burnt a hole in the racquet (we were night high so we laughed at this). Mike some how got it into the air and hit it to Kaj. Kaj (who has sucky aim) hits the ball and it hits me in the pant leg, and for the first time we saw the ball bounce. It was facking awesome! When it hit the ground some gas would fall off, leaving a fire trail. The flame then went out and Mike then doused it in gas and lit it again. This time we couldnt get it into the air, so we kinda played soccer with it.  Now the freaking awesome part. We set the toilet paper down, and rolled it along a little and doused the tail in gas (we also soaked the cardboard that the toilet paper is on). Mike threw a match on it and the whole tail lit up, it was like gun powder in action movies. The flame went all the way up until the roll and when it got there we started to kick the roll around. It burnt down and the tail of the toilet paper left this big black line. Mike kept saying that his parents would be pissed, so I said (while night high) "lets take off our clothing and put gas on it and say we were framed." That idea didnt work, so we walked to the house and found some foot soap, Mike said "lets wash it!" We all knew it wouldnt work, but we did it any way. Mike rubbed it on the black line until no foot soap was left. This didnt work....there was now a big white line. So Mikes dad would ask "Mike! Did you make that big black line out there?" and Mike would respond "Are you racist! Why didnt you notice the white line?" Haha night high rocks!

      For the rest of this post Mike K= Mike Kelsey Mike= Greg’s Friend Dad= Mike, my dad Greg= my brother  This past weekend fucking rocked! It all started after school in Friday when Mike K and I got picked up at school and then we went to my house to get packed for the snowboarding trip. We got packed and headed out the door, to snowshoe!  First Mike K and I did some of our home work, until the sun went down. Then everyone in the car (Mike K, my dad, Mike, Greg, and I) except for my mom played a drama type game where one person says one word and then the next person says another word and so on. The story we made was:    We then sat back and slept for the rest of the trip (except for my dad who had to drive). We got there and watched South Park, the episode where Chef's parents talk about the lock ness monster, grand indeed. After that fucking awesome episode we went to bed.  The next morning my parents and Mike go and get their rental gear, and then we were ready to head down the mountain. Mike and I decided to go to the terrain park (jumps and crap). There was this big jump that I decided to jump off of, I underestimated its size and messed up my ankle. I slowed down just before I went off and landed really hard on my left ankle. It was really hard for me to do a right turn, but eventually got used to the pain.  Mike and I got to the bottom and ate some waffles, then back up the mountain. We actually decided to go to the other mountain (silver creek) because they have a better terrain park. Mike and I spent the rest of the day there working on some tricks.  We got home and ate some dinner then headed out to “teen night,” which is a cheap way to get teenagers to spend their money (totally kicked ass). The girls were all up onz me... Sorta. We then went home and fell asleep.  We then woke up and I had no more pain in my ankle, then we went to silver creek. We did more tricks and got a whole lot better. Now Mike and I can do: Indy, Mute, Stale-fish, Roast beef, stand still 180, stand still shifty, 50-50, and board slide (just cant finish it without busting our tailbones on the rail).  And the best part was the trip home. We got packed and took everything down to the car, loaded it up and got in. My dad tried to start the car but was unsuccessful. My brother then said “Maybe the battery is frozen.” Every on in the car cracked up. So we (Mike K, Mike, and I) teased Greg about it. Then Mike K then said sarcastically to Greg, “My shoe doesnt fit any more, maybe it’s frozen!” Then Greg said “Actually that could happen.”  Again we cracked up. We got the car fixed (kind of) and then drove off. It started to snow hard and we decided to pull over to some random Virginia hick hotel.  The next morning we were off and a few later the car broke down again because of the batteries. So Mike K, Mike, Greg, and I, went to CVS so we can buy a magazine and maybe a DVD. Greg and Mike bought a DVD and then wanted to stay in the store, but the bitchy store clerk yelled at them because they are teenagers and have a bag to which they can steel stuff with. It was actually a very funny thing to watch.  My parents got a new battery, so we then headed home… and now Im here… typing this.  Funny Quotes:  Mike (Greg’s friend)- “West Virginia is a different state?! Im sorry, Im from Canada.”  My dad- “I once had a car…” (he was about to start a story, then my brother said) Greg-“You had a car!?”  El Fin (or la?)

      ok guys i havent written a rant in a looooooong time so im a liddle rusty but this liddle one should suffice. i dont have much support for my argument tho.  ya know who i hate? those stupid conservative bitches that have been brainwashed by the government. ya know? the ones who come into elps and lecture for 45 mins on random shit that they didnt think up. First of all, her first mistake was being a conservative. girls...if you are a woman, NEVER FUCKING BE CONSERVATIVE!!!!!!! iTS SELF DESTRUCTIVE DAMMIT!!!!1111!!!!!!!11    here is why: 1: Conservatives are against change and rights and fluffy things like that soo right off the bat you women are being abused 2: 99.99999 % of Conservatives are fundamentalist christian. do you know what that means? following the bible 100% of the time. This means that all you women must always bow down to your husbands wishes no matter what he says cuz god says so. sounds fun eh? 3. Conservatives are bitches when they are women and everybody hates them.  ::deep breath:: alright now to break apart that stupid bitches arguments. "i think O.S.H.A. sucks cuz they are nitpicky." ok good thinking lady. yes they are nitpicky at times.  but would you mind fucking thinking about what you are saying? we are in a recession lady! dont you fucking realize that the government has to cover their damn ass cuz all you fucking conservatives are trial lawyers and suing for bullshit like "that dentist forgot to wear a rubber glove and i got a cold. GIMME 100 million dollars!!!1!!11" right so i won that argument you stupid whore. Next, she said something about how big lobbying corporations are made up of voters so bribing people is ok. wow you are a stupid bitch. Do you honestly think that UPS when they pushed to pass legislation that would make their employees work longer asked their people if they approved? they certainly didnt ask the guys who have to drive the brown trucks to give shit to rich people (like me). o but wait those cool black dudes in the brown suits are VOTERS so its ok. god damn i wanna kill people like you. well, not really.         everything in this rant obviously from the very ignorant standpoint of someone who did not work on capitol hill for 7 years. hats off to you lady. but your still a stupid conservative bitch.

      I was bored so I asked people to tell me some stories...Kind of a contest. The rules are as follows: 1. Must be a child type story (doesnt need to be for children) 2. There really isnt a 2, I'm just going to say some crap about the stories...just read and you will see.  Mikes story: In the land of the ancients, in the third age of the world, there lived a humble man, alone. He did not have kin, nor wife, nor children, and thus he jacked off his humble penis often As one day he walked through the meadow of the Wedoe, contemplating his troubles, a bearded negro approached him. He spoke to the dark man: "Why douth thou approacheth me, colleage?" for in those days, all men were colleages. The negro spoke slowly, and with much effort, and his beard shook as he spoke thus "You owe me three fitty." And thus said the humble man, "I have not three fitty, for I am humble" And the negro looked at him, and vanished, and in his place stood a terrible creature, at least the height of the tallest of the village buildings, and he was the loch ness monster. The humble man yelled in humble fear, and was soon-after humbly eaten.  What John has to say: Mike gets +12 points for talking about a sexual body part He gets -4 points for taking something from South Park He gets +35 for using the word "colleage" more than once Final score -74, F (not an average) Notes: Dude come on you totally said "three fitty" (man come up with your own weird way to say an amount of money)  Bekkas story: There once was a man from Bandu, Who fell asleep in a canoe. He dreamed of Venus, And played with his penis, And woke up with a hand full of goo.  What John has to say: Bekka gets +83 points for saying Bandu (such an awesome place) She gets -3 points for saying "goo" (you could have said something like poo and then the reader would say "what the fuck!?!?!") Final score +1, C (not an average) Notes: It was really Close to a F  Micas story: There once was a boy named john, he was a nut.  The end.  What John has to say: HOLY SHIT -3 POINTS FOR NOT CAPTILIZING MY NAME Final score N/A, F (not an average) Notes: I dont know why I bothered with this one  Petrs stroy: There was a gay guy named John Haltertop, and he liked males. Not just ordinary males, gay elephant males. However, he couldnt find one anywhere, so he went searchin, but all he could find was his fat gym teacher. so then he was wondering, and he was like “Man I could just go to the zoo.” And he did, and there he jumped the fence. Except he didnt read the sign that said it was the fence to the jail next to the zoo. so he was walking, and walking, and he couldnt find an elephant. So then he stopped where the inmates played and asked for directions. They told him to go to the showers and maybe he'll find one there. So he goes, and there a guys soap falls on the floor. John Haltertop bends over to pick it up, and we all know how the rest of that story goes. The End.  What John has to say: ... Final score .... Notes: Give Petr $12 tomorrow  The winner is....Bekka!

      ok here is a funny quote.  right so bekka feiner and i were talking about how she wants to hook up but shes very picky about who she hooks up with. therefore, i suggested that she just have a party, get tipsy, buzzed, or drunk and hook up with someone. just to get the sexual frustration out of her. the following conversation ensued.  MrBubbles6965: i think thats a great idea sWeeTaRt11887: nope MrBubbles6965: y is it not? sWeeTaRt11887: because sWeeTaRt11887: first off sWeeTaRt11887: i am not getting drunk MrBubbles6965: and y not? sWeeTaRt11887: because i don't like feeling out of control of my own body or judgements MrBubbles6965: you've never gotten drunk have you sWeeTaRt11887: no, but i don't want to try it MrBubbles6965: hahahahahahahahah sWeeTaRt11887: why is that funny? MrBubbles6965: its so naive of you sWeeTaRt11887: why? sWeeTaRt11887: i know the risks involved of getting drunk sWeeTaRt11887: not only physical risks but what could happen if i lose my judgement sWeeTaRt11887: not only that, but we're underage MrBubbles6965: HAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHHAHAHAHHAHAHAH sWeeTaRt11887: and i don't care how funny yu think it is sWeeTaRt11887: that's my opinion and it's not changing  she has some good points but once she drinks...she will realize that its not that big a deal and worth it. i think. w/e

Johns going with bethany which im sure bethany will not regret or anything............hah....ha.....yea. hahahha w/e she seemed pretty damn happy that he said yes and then ran away to his carpool. theme of prom: manhattan 1920s. prohibition. sounds kinda stupid since you cant have any moonshine related props. w/e the gangster aspect has quite a bit of potential. maybe i should bring my tommy-gun with me...damn it would be sweet to have one of those. anyway...righto....liddle more than a month til the rush concert!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ive been reading up on some of the cds and my interest has been piqued. im probly gonna check out their sucky 80s and 90s music just to see whats up with em.

      John, Kaj, and I just got back from the Rush concert. It was honestly one of the best experiences of my life. Those 50 year-old guys rock out way better than of the young lames these days. Blink 182? SHIT compared to this performance which was the empitomy of perfection. Neil Peart had a crazy ass drum solo complete with cow bells and a spinning circular drum set. That man is severely talented. Can anyone YOU know keep the beat to xanadu chuck your drumstick 20 ft in the air, still keep the beat with both your feet on pedals and one free hand, catch the drumstick and keep going. NO. Alex and Geddy were crazy. Lifeson was just railing on his guitar during the encore performance: Limelight. It was crazy. Of course, geddy was rocking throughout the concert hopping from bass to keyboards/synthesizers while keeping the vocals going. O yea, nothings better than seeing white-boy 50 yr old man Geddy walk over to neil and jump with his 3 foot vertical on the big notes. hahaha. Anyway, in conclusion, the concert fucking kicked ass. Mike, John, Kaj and I are all going to the Frampton/Styx concert soo all yall better be going if its gonna be anywhere as good as the Rush concert. I guarantee if it is, it will be a life-altering experience.

      WOW. John and I are extremely fucking excited right now. For those of you who dont know, E3, or Electronic Entertainment Expo is goin on right now. Now this my friends is the holy mecca, gold mine, moment of euporia, for the videogame world. www.ign.com , my favorite videogame website is posting full coverage of the event. therefore, when i came home and got online john imed me and i realized that videogame history was in the making. on ign.com i found streaming videos of all the most anticipated games. Halo 2, Legend of Zelda, Metroid 2, Viewtiful Joe 2, Starfox, RE4. Lemme tell you i was about to shit in my pants. All of these games look fucking beautiful and are each their own masterpieces. Now, the icing on the cake. Nintendo DS. a new handheld system. it has the graphics capabilities of a Dreamcast (fucking kick ass system) and two back lit LCD screens to boot. Complete with a microphone for voice recognition/command software and live talking over the internet. one of the two screens is designed to be used similarly to a pda for drawing and typing. It looks fucking tight and will revolutionize gaming. o by the way, nintendo anounced their new console. Called Revolution cuz its gonna revolutionize gaming. I cant wait. wanna know why? cuz im gonna be crapping my pants til it come out.

      Want to get back at spammers? Order stuff. Seriously.  Go to every spam site that comes in your email. Make sure you strip out the code that tells them what your email address is. (Open the source code for your email, strip out the address of the generic website, i.e. www.SpamWhatAm.com, and enter it manually into your browser.) Order cases of penis powder, viagra, herbal this and that, 0.039% mortgages, whatever and charge everything to a bogus credit card, giving them a fictious person and address. Or, if you want, use a real person, like:  George W. Bush  1600 Pennsylvania Avenue  Washington, DC 20500  USA  phone: 202-456-1111  email: president@whitehouse.gov  Make up a credit card number. (Here's one: 4268-4976-6194-6633; it means I AM THE POOPY HOOFD; hoofd is Dutch for head.)  If you are charging stuff to Bush, make sure the expiration date is 01/05   Most of the web sites will verify the credit card automatically and find out the VISA card is bogus and just reject your order. Just keep trying. This will annoy the credit card companies, who will bitch to the spammers, and may shut them off to keep their system from overloading with bogus political protest orders.  Some might send an email to the White House saying George W. Bush's credit is no good.  Some of them might actually ship the stuff BEFORE processing the card. (Unlikely, but cool.)  At a minimum, you will have clogged up the spammer's invoicing and credit system with bogus orders. At a maximum, well...  And, if enough people do it on enough websites , it may be enough to get mentioned in the papers.   Email this to every blogger you know.   Yippie!
