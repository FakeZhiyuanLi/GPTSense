       urlLink    Last night was Kelly's going away extravaganza.  She'll be heading off for the Peace Corps on Tuesday but is heading home to Paz tomorrow afternoon.  She'll be in the Eastern Caribbean for 2 years, so we had a get together at the Gates' house to swim, play b-ball, chat, talk about the world's oldest dog, eat pizza, and listen to Rilo Kiley.  After that we headed to the Triple Crown Pub for ping pong, shuffleboard (both of which Kelly kicked all of our asses at) and fellowship.  Michelle got kicked out for not being 21. Again. :( Sorry Michelle.  I tried side tracking the bartender by asking how much the apple cider is by the pitcher but he kept on asking.  I tried.  Well what more can be said?  Kel will be tremendously missed but we're excited to see how she'll grow and impact others in another country in the same way she's impacted and been a part of our lives here.  Hurry back Kelly!

       Transatlanticism   by  urlLink Death Cab For Cutie    The atlantic was born today and i'll tell you how...  The clouds above opened up and let it out.   I was standing on the surface of a perforated sphere  When the water filled every hole.  And thousands upon thousands made an ocean,  Making islands where no island should go.  Oh no.   Those people were overjoyed; they took to their boats.  I thought it less like a lake and more like a moat.  The rhythm of my footsteps crossing flood lands to your door have been silenced forever more.  The distance is quite simply much too far for me to row  It seems farther than ever before  Oh no.   I need you so much closer [x8]   I need you so much closer [x4]  So come on, come on [x4]

       My first blog post.  How fantastic.     I got back yesterday morning (my birthday) from Jason and Winter's wedding in Seattle, WA.  It was a fantasmagreat time.  I arrived last Wednesday night and then Josh, Kallie, Whitney and I met up with Jason and Rachel and took the hour drive out to Winter's house.  We stayed at the beach house down by the water on Wednesday night.  Thursday we woke up and then Matt, Brenda, Purg and I went to the ferry to catch a ride to downtown Seattle.  We were late and they stopped running the foot ferry, so we took the ferry to Port Orchard and enjoyed a nice meal at a pub and walked around the city.  Purg found a Filipino restuarant and couldn't resist.  There was a cat the size of Garfield at a frame store.  We then met up with the rest of the crew and went out on the Mitchell's boat for a few hours.  It was nice to just sit around and talk to people - do some catching up.  We then went back to the house and had pizza and a bonfire.  The guys then went to the hotel to sleep.  Oh ya, and thursday morning a bunch of the guys took naked freezing cold showers outside of the beach house because we couldn't take them inside.  Friday we hung out, then went to the rehearsal at the same port where the boat was, then to a real nice rehearsal dinner at a golf course.  Then back to the hotel for bonding time (naked sauna time when we all sat around and talked to Jason, great.) and sleeping.  Saturday was the big day and it was cloudy right up until Winter walked down the stairs and the sun began to blare down on us.  It was hot. so very hot.  After the wedding we danced and ate and drank and were merry.  Then we cleaned up and went back to the beach house.  More hanging out.  Sunday we all got ready and had a bar-b-que when Jason and Winter got back to the house.  After the bar-b-que we took the ferry to downtown Seattle and hung out around there all night.  Purg, Matt, and I wanted to stay out at night, so we took the extra car (Jason's) and stayed out talking until about 3am.  We then drove back to Rachel's parents' house to crash.  Monday we woke up to an incredible breakfast from Rach's mom and then headed downtown to go to the Experience Music Project.  The EMP was closed because of the Governer's Convention so we were going to go take the monorail down to the Mariner's game.  All the cheap seats were sold out, plus they closed the monorail because they were worried about terrorists.  So we ate in the food court and watched old people dance.  From there we drove down to the fish market and watched the flying fish.  We all were very tired from the weekend's activities.  Red Robin was our choice for dinner because Purg had been craving hot wings which they were out of.  They sang happy birthday to me but didnt' believe it was my birthday so only gave me a little thing of ice cream when some little kid got a huge brownie sundae.  We rented Cheaper by the Dozen and went back to Rachel's.  The DVD was scratched and it took us FOREVER to watch the movie.  Which ended up not really being worth the time.  Paramedic?  No, but i could use a pair-a-knees.  OH! MY LATTE!  Only funny parts of that movie.  Woke up at 5am on Tuesday morning and headed to the airport.  I caught an early flight back to SD, got a ride home with Kel, did some work, had a smoothie and chatted in my courtyard with Kel, went to Bread of Life (BOL), then came back here for a party in my honour.  People left around 12:30am (thanks folks, especially those that work the grueling 9-5'er).  I got some SWEET gifts too! Wine, citron, a great book by Gorey, and 4 shirts from Threadless!  My friends are fantastic.  Kelly and Renee had a heat competition in which they covered themselves with as much clothes and blankets as possible in our hot apartment - first person to give up loses.  Kelly lost. This morning I met with Fabrice and Burak about the company and money and CMS and such.

      I have had an EXTREMELY eclectic 24 hours.  Yesterday morning Fabrice and I had a meeting with Kathy Foster to discuss a website for her wedding photography at Starbucks in La Mesa, then we traveled to the offices on 30th street for 4 hours to discuss a game plan for the project proposal to Gerardy Photography.  If all goes well there it could be a really nice big project - and good portfolio piece.  At 4pm Maurice showed up and gave us a couple projects for the San Diego Urban League and Willie Morrow - a guy that made a bunch of money by making hair care curling gel like 20 years ago.  At 4:30 I went home and then Whitney picked me up to see the Metallica documentary in Hillcrest at 5:30.  At 8:00 we got out and went across the street to Corvette's for Aaron's b-day.  After that Whitney, Stef, and I went to Wintson's in OB for a raggae concert.  This morning I woke up and took Eric to work, drove out to Leigh and Tiana's work and then dropped Leigh off at the airport, went home for lunch and walked around with Stef and Renee for a bit, then picked up 4 ex-african missionaires and drove them to Puerto Nuevo, Mexico for a reunion they are having this weekend.  Crazy huh?

      I'm so frickin' stupid.  During my lunch break (al beit that it is 3:45pm) I decided to watch the final episode of Friends that I've had downloaded for months.  What bad timing for me to watch a TV show about a group of friends moving on with their lives, leaving people behind, having to face the future, etc.  I should have stuck with my traditional lunch-time Simpsons episode. :(

Not to go in to my own personal feelings - haven't really started in on those yet via Internet blog - but I'll just say I thought from all the thinking I've done about her leaving recently that I would do better than I did.  No bauling or breakdowns, but it hurt to see her go.  And how  extremely  coincidental - Blink 182's song  urlLink "Miss You"  just came on my iTunes.      *sigh*

       urlLink    We were all depressed about Kel leaving so we decided to crash the Gates' house and use their pool and TV for the day.  We headed over there at about 3:30pm or so, swam some, had spaghetti and breadsticks for dinner, ate ice cream, then watched the documentary Out Foxed.  We left around 10:45pm - good stuff.  I think we all just wanted to be around friends and enjoy company with each other since so much is going on with people leaving and our lives changing.  So it was nice to relax and do that.

      Renee and I are the only ones around City Heights this weekend.  Eric and Tiana are at a wedding with Jenn and Scott, Stef is in Kansas, Gwen has left, and of course Kelly left a couple weeks ago.  Yesterday Renee, Whitney, and I went to the Triple Crown Pub and played ping pong for a couple hours then ordered pizza and watched Equillibrium.  Today I worked on my photography portfolio - which is turning out really cool - then I found out that we didn't get the project with Gerardy Photography.  Suck.  Renee and I went to Rite Aid around 8pm then went to her place, made banana milkshakes, I ate some left over Indian food of Jenn and Tiana's (sorry about the flower plate - it said it was oven safe!!!), then watched some bad WB shows and then watched The Jerk.  The Jerk saved my evening.  Such a funny movie!  What fun and entertaining times are ahead for David this weekend?

      Currently listening to:  Blink 182 - Miss You  I've been working this morning since 11:30am or so.  I've got all the layouts done for the new CT66 project we started 2 days ago.  I think we'll have this thing done REAL quick. Which is good news.  Tomorrow we'll find out if we get the project with Gerardy Photography.  It's a real big project and we'd be set for a few months if we get it.  We'll be getting an office, an intern, and I'll get to start paying off my debt.  I sent a quick rundown of the haps to Kelly this afternoon and just got an e-mail back! I'm surprised because I thought I wouldn't hear from her for 4 weeks or so.  Surprised=happy.  I'm currently working on a photo portfolio to put up online.  Then I'll work on this blog - make it more... me.  It's so stock now.  But at least I'm doing something.  Looks like I'll be going to LA this weekend with Whitney to hang out - she met one of the writers of Scrubs and because I'm a little bit of a fan of the show we're supposed to go hang out and find him.  I'm also going to Newport Beach on Sunday for Jeff and Allison's wedding.  I'm glad I get to go.  It's 5:54pm on Thursday - you know what that means?  Time to start the weekend.

This is the same house/couple that woke me up at 4am the first week I was living in this apartment to the sounds of the beauty of lovemaking. I considered calling the cops on this one but the girl got in her car and took off... although I think I heard the guy get in his car and leave about 15 minutes prior.  Perhaps there is treachery, misleading, mischief, and... umm... sinning... afoot?

      Let's see if I can remember what all happened over the weekend.  I have a tendency of forgetting what I've done after I've done it.    Friday - Fabrice and I drove up to Escondido for a meeting with potential client Gerardy Photography to discuss the project for a couple hours.  It turned out to be a larger project than we had originally thought - but that's good if we are granted the contract.  Friday evening/night Jenn, Scott, Stef, Renee and I went to JB's house - Jenn's co-worker - in PB for Yuccafest 2004.  Basically it was a PB party.  I really didn't want to worry with sleeping there so I caught a ride back with Renee and Stef to sleep at mi casa around 2am.  Saturday - Woke up around 11 or so and longboarded to the B-house then made my way with Renee and Stef back to PB to hang out at the beach for the afternoon.  We all just laid around and soaked up the sun, played some football in the water, and I tried my hand at boogie boarding.  We ate at Taco Surf - good burritos - then headed home.  I spent Saturday night at home on my computer and watching SNL.  Sunday - I watched the kiddies in the nursery during the service and then went to Saigon Restuarant for lunch to have my first taste of Pho (pronounced Fuh).  Special Combination #23... mmmm.. really good.  After feeling like we'd worked out (Anya, David, Tim, Eric) I went to Tim's house and played Xbox for a while then we went to Hazard Center - Mann Theater which used to be Madstone, no longer indy movies... booo.... - to see The Village.  It wasn't what I was expecting but definitely worth seeing.  And notice that Shamyalan (spelling?) himself is in the movie at the end - the man holding the newspaper.  Great addition if you catch it.  From there Tim and I went to David and Eric's place in Point Loma to grill some barracuda they caught yesterday on a deep sea fishing venture.  A few other guys showed up later on and we had a 4 on 4 Halo-fest.  Left there at 2am.

       urlLink Tore through Punta Gorda, Port Charlotte, and Sanibel  - I have family in Pine Island, Fort Myers, and Orlando.  Sanibel (Captiva city) is only a couple miles directly west of Pine Island where my uncle has 350 acres of palm plantation.  They're out of town, but my cousin is there tying everything down.  Captiva apparently has been hit worst with 160 homes gone, 160 more damaged.  They expect this to be as big as Andrew and it doesn't look like it will be out of the north east until Monday night.  More to come...

      I've finished 5 water studies for today.  If you didn't read my explanation earlier - basically I've wanted to combine the music that I love with some sort of visual experience.  Drawing inspiration from Bill Viola, these are just short studies in making something as simple as turning on a faucet or watching water boil interesting, exciting, and almost exhilirating just by speeding up/slowing down the footage and adding music.  Like I said though, they are just studies, fairly pretentious, but who knows what they may lead to.  Here they are:   urlLink 1 - Faucet: Music by Tristeza   urlLink 2 - Shower head: Music by Air   urlLink 3 - Toilet: Music by Mogwai   urlLink 4 - Sink drain: Music by Clinic   urlLink 5 - Boiling pot: Music by Dredg

      I finally saw Garden State tonight!  Eric, Tiana, Michelle Golden, Christie Hatch and I went to the Landmark Theaters in Hillcrest and saw the 7:30pm showing. It was definitely good.  Lots of interesting connections.  I won't say anything more just in case you haven't seen it - but I liked it for sure.  I put Styrofoam Plates on here because there's a big part of Garden State that deals with his relationship to his dad - couldn't get more lyrical than this song by DCFC.  I'm working on 4 more water studies.  They'll be done before I go to bed.

      Written by: Ben Gibbard Performed by: Death Cab for Cutie Album:  The Photo Album  There's a saltwater film on the jar of your ashes; I threw them to the sea,  but a gust blew them backwards and the sting in my eyes  that you then inflicted was par for the course just as when you were living.  It's no stretch to say you were not quite a father but the donor of seeds to a poor, single mother that would raise us alone.  We never saw the money that went down your throat through the hole in your belly.   Thirteen years old in the subsurbs of Denver, standing in line for Thanksgiving dinner at the Catholic church.  The servers wore crosses to shield from the sufferance plaguing the others.  Styrofoam plates, cafeteria tables, charity reeks of cheap wine and pity and I'm thinking of you,  I do every year when we count all our blessings and wonder what we're doing here.   You're a disgrace to the concept of family.  The priest won't divulge that fact in his homily  and I'll stand up and scream if in the mourning remain quiet,  you can deck out a lie in a suit.  But I won't buy it.  I won't join the procession that's speaking their peace, using five dollar words while praising his integrity.  Just 'cause he's gone, it doesn't change that fact: he was bastard in life, thus a bastard in death.

      I was part of the security on stage making sure John Kerry didn't get hurt at a concert and he said "I told George Bush I wanted to win, but the reason wasn't that I wanted to be President, but because I wanted this to be over so I didn't have to worry about all of you getting hurt anymore - so why don't you all move back a few steps?"  I asked "us too?" "yeah, why dont you?" So the security guards and I jumped over the fence that was set up in front of the stage and sat on the floor. Then I was in charge of setting up a laptop to show Beauty and the Beast to a group of new PLNU students.  I couldn't get all the windows on the desktop to go away and this new freshman kept telling me it was bugging her because i couldn't move the cursor so I told her to go back to high school.  I finally got all of the windows to go away and she came over and said she was the reason it worked and then started putting her butt in my face so I couldn't see the screen - so I looked at the other vertical TV on my right and she got angry and went back and sat down on the ground with her HS friends.  We watched the movie - which turned out to be ET 2.  In this one ET was a tough biker (think Harley Davidson) and a big metal robot was after him - kind of like Short Circuit.  The robot kept throwing weaponry at ET and it would slam through his body but ET could regenerate his stomach and it just made him more mad.  I got up and left the Kerry speech/concert/movie watching and went on a walk on the beach of Sunset Cliffs with Kelly and Miciah.  We came to the "wailing wall" and I climbed up it while I watched starfish fall off the side.  they landed back in the water and were colored really bright pink/purple.  I got to the top and started to take a nap but kelly and miciah left me and kept walking.  I told kelly if you're in an airplane you can see all the starfish on the coast.  I then got a phone call and had to go to the house.  At the house I met a guy that ended up being a super hero and called himself The Boxer.  He wore red and a big mask.  I found myself to be a super hero too - we had to keep this a secret from each other - and I didn't have super powers but I was supposed to save people from cyclones and tornadoes.  I found The Boxer at my house on 20th street and listened in on his cell phone conversation to his evil super hero boss when I got another phone call from my mom.  Apparently there was a cyclone in Iowa and a tornado in Ohio.  How was I supposed to save anyone, I don't have a car?!?  So I rode my bike back to the house and talked to my mom.  She said I should hurry and I told her my problem.  She said she would give me her cell phone and some money to ride the train.  So I put on my black ski jacket and started to think about riding the train to Iowa first to save the drowning child from the cyclone.    Then I woke up.

      This afternoon I rode to the office on 30th street to pick up a check from Sulic, deposited the check, and rode back - made it in 30 minutes! Not bad - the office is about 2 miles away.  Eric and I headed out to the Wrights' house around 7:30pm until 11:30pm for a Halo party.  We had a couple games of 16 players - 4 Xboxi (that's the plural form of Xbox) - 4 TVs - and lots of cookies and pizza.  Kathy hooked it up with the goodies again, of course.  She's everyone's mom away from mom.  We then went to the house where Jaimie is currently staying and sat around for an hour or so and talked to her and Tiana.  Then back here for The Daily Show and... writing in my blog.

      I left the apartment around 7:30pm and rode Renee's bike to the B-house to watch Pieces of April (starring Katie Holmes... mmmm) with Stef. Apparently Tiana and Eric are watching a free movie somewhere and Jenn and Scott got kayaks and are at Humphrey's.  After Pieces of April - which is a pretty good movie, starts off slow but has a good ending - I decided we needed to get out of the house.  I suggested going to Lestat's coffee house down the street from my apartment.  We arrived and Stef got some tea, we found out about a back patio area that was full so we found a couple seats up front.  Seated around a table was a man, probably in his late 30's, overweight, tattooes of swords and other medieval weaponry on his body, very very short shorts, a tie-dyed shirt, with a girl that is probably 18 or 19 years old, "goth" style, lovingly caressing his chin(s).  They were seated for a few minutes until they left and a couple other girls, much more "preppy" sat down with one other guy, and then another guy with spikey blonde/green/blue hair and a dog collar sat down.  A skater/punk rocker was across from us by this time, probably in his mid-30's, reading a book.  Stef and I were chatting away, minding our own business, until a guy walks through the door (I actually saw him earlier riding his bike around the block) wearing a HUGE metal chain around his neck with a masterlock on the end.  He did not use this lock to chain up his bike - this was for pure accessory.  He walks up to the man that was reading, that has since put the book down, and says (very loudly for some reason, almost yelling) "Who's book is that?  Can I see it??" The man let's him see it, hesitantly.  "What's it about??"  "Fantasy"  "Really? Cuz the girl on the front looks like a Tero"  "Nope, she's a *insert some weird name* elf"  "Here let me show you a picture of a Tero, I think she's a Tero"  - he proceeds to open his backpack and takes out a book.  I believe this book to be some sort of book of mysticism and spirituality, in which he finds a picture of the Teros.  "See? She's a Tero"  "Nooooo - those are coneheads"  "Nope, see, she has pointy ears like them - they live in the middle of the earth.  And these right here," he flips the page, "this is the race I'm from".  The guy with the spikey blonde/green/blue hair sitting next to him becomes intrigued and looks over.   "Want to see a picture of Satan?"  To which the collared high schooler replies "No thanks, I've met her."  "Her?? No way - Lucifer is a guy"  "Nope, sorry, I've met her."  This goes on a for a few minutes until he finds the picture of Satan, his wife, and father.  Apparently Lucifer's father also tried to over-throw God and was thrown out as well.  By this time I'm listening intently and look over to Stef.  We laugh a little bit and are completely intrigued.  Out of nowhere we notice the reading skater come back with a box of latex gloves, alcohol swabs, some silver medical equipment, a marker, and a bag of rings.  One of the girls on the couch (preppy girl #1) gets up and they mark her to get her belly button pierced.  While the guys on our right are discussing Ishtar and how "sorry if this offends you, but Ishtar looks like a bitch" she suddenly is lying on the couch getting pierced.  The conversation on my right moves to how the lock-necklace bike rider believes even though he has offended his god he's "not evil, you aren't evil, really, I just think you're messed up, you're really a good person.  You aren't evil"  "I never said I was evil"  "You aren't evil".. etc.  Everyone begins to leave one by one for one reason or another and suddenly Stef and I are left with the mysticism bookman and the piercing skater.  We look at each other, I decide what just happened would be IMPOSSIBLE to be topped tonight, if ever, and we leave Lestat's.  I just loved being able to see the difference in people, their beliefs, discussion, and character.  It was beautiful.  Diversity and oddness at its finest.  Sometimes I get too comfortable in surrounding myself with people that think, react, and speak in basically the same way as me, and I forget that there are so many other views, reasonings, and experiences out there.  Thanks Lestat's.  Oh yes, and we also learned 1) that the first Jews were called Foogulrots and they lived underground and 2) the first king of Britain was a Satanic-cult-leading-peasant-blood-sucking vampire.

      I'm listening to a great band I found last night on Music Plasma - they're called TV on the Radio.  I dig 'em.  Surprised I never heard of them actually.  Last night Tiana, Eric, and I went to Bread of Life (BoL) and then sat around the Basileia House for a few hours and ate cookies.  We left and came back home to await the arrival of Bonnie Baker.  Bon found yesterday she got a job in the computer lab on PLNU campus and had to be here today to fill out applications and such.  So she left Redding in NorCal around 3pm and got here around midnight.  We stayed up a little while and watched The Daily Show and then fell asleep.  Well ok, Bonnie fell asleep and I stayed up another 2 hours because I found Music Plasma.  I really like that site.  That's how I found TV on the Radio.    This morning I woke up, did a little bit of work, then Bonnie and I went to Wendy's for chicken sandwiches and a frosty, then to campus to fill out her forms.  She got her room and has the BEST room in Finch.  A corner room with a great ocean view.  I'm jealous.  I've been here working on the Siemens CT66 project for the last 5 hours.  How you like that?

      This is a dream I had a couple nights ago:  There was a field that had a line of pilgrims sitting cross-legged by a campfire with a few slaves, and behind them there was a flock of sheep with wolves that were herding them - then there was a big industrial mill/building on the hill that was made out of brick.  Someone decided to pump arsenic inside of the building which made all the hamsters in the building run through tubes and some die.  The ones that didn't die ran out the front door and around the side of the building where they followed a road to Florida.  I went inside the building after they left and found a way downstairs to a subway system that had two sides - on one side my Dad was waiting in line behind a big pane of bullet proof glass for the next train - we had to hurry because of the arsenic - and I just waited on the other side.  I decided to go down a hole and slid down a rope ladder to wait for him.  When he got on the other side of the tunnel/tracks we met up with some people in an underground restaurant and they all ordered meat, but I decided to have the vegetarian neatloaf instead.

      I worked on my site for most of yesterday - until 7pm or so when Chelsea and Renee came and picked me up.  We then traveled to People's Market in OB to get avacados, tomatos, and limes for some guac.  We then played ping-pong and pool for an hour or so, listened to some Sigur Ros, and ate the guac.  At 11:30pm we decided to go to Vegas.  We figured it out and we would be able to drive there, stay for an hour and a half, then drive back and be in San Diego in time for church this morning at 10:30am.  Well it took us too much time to get ready so we lost all time in Vegas - so instead we sat around, listened to hip-hop, and played adult Truth Or Dare. We decided Truth or Dare was made in Elementary school, but there needed to be an adult version.  We fell asleep around 3:00am and then went to church this morning.  I rode Renee's bike because we were running late and I had to help out with the kids.  2nd week in a row.

      Well I haven't been home to Oklahoma City since last November, so I was due for a trip to the motherland.  I arrived at 8:30pm this evening after a day of traveling through Dallas (DFW).  Nothing too exciting except the flight attendant spilling Bloody Mary mix on my laptop while I watched Dogma.  At first it still worked and just smelled like tomato, now it's not working and sounds like it's sizzling.  I got the guy's employee number and such, so if I have to get anything worked on it will be paid for by American Airlines.  Now what to do? Apparently the thunderstorm I have been hoping for is coming in early - possibly tonight around midnight - so now I'm going to call Kris, watch The Daily Show on my parent's HUGE HDTV and then see if I can't take some sweetness pictures.

      Every Sunday night the Wright's have anyone interested over to their house for Simpsons.  Yes, even though it's on Fox.  Tonight Tim Chung made Korean barbecue and it was awesome.  Eric and I brought home some extra potato salad.  Mmmm.... We all watched Simpsons, the olympics, and Miciah sing "Row Row Row Your Boat" on his mini-karaoke.   urlLink Here is a video  - how cute is THAT?  And he did it all night long.  Tim also gave the sermon today at church.  It was very relevant and from the heart.  Good job Tim.  He gave an example of himself not standing during God Bless America at an Orioles game, and how that relates to a different polis than the standards America states as being "correct".  Tim leaves to go back to Duke on Friday for his final year.  It was great getting to know him this summer.  We'll miss him, but he'll be back.  He loves us too much.

       urlLink     We went out to Solana Beach tonight to a house that Jeff Kane is housesitting for.  We had a little bar-b-cue and then decided to do a gift exchange with random objects we found around the house.  This is the picture from after the gift exchange.  Bonnie, Rachel, Kelly Tirril, Leigh, Kane, Erin and I.  After this we played Baulderdash.
