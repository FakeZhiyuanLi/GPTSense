       A couple of songs i really like  "Goodbye To You" by michelle branch  Of all the things I believe in I just want to get it over with tears from behind my eyes but I do not cry Counting the days that past me by  I've been searching deep down in my soul Words that I'm hearing are starting to get old Looks like I'm starting all over again The last three years were just pretend and I say  Goodbye to you Goodbye to everything I thought I knew You were the one I love The one thing that I tried to hold on to  I still get lost in your eyes And it seems like I can't live a day without you Closing my eyes till you chase my thoughts away To a place where I am blinded by the light but it's not right  Goodbye to you Goodbye to everything I thought I knew You were the one I loved The one thing that I tried to hold on to  Ohhh yeah It hurts to want everything & nothing at the same time I want whats yours and I want whats mine I want you but I'm not giving in this time  Goodbye to you Goodbye to everything I thought I knew You were the one I loved The one thing that I tried to hold on to The one thing that I tried to hold on to  Goodbye to you Goodbye to everything I thought I knew You were the one I loved The one thing that I tried to hold on to  We the stars fall and I lie awake Your my shooting star   "Fallen" by sarah mclachlan  Heaven bent to take my hand And lead me through the fire Be the long awaited answer To a long and painful fight  Truth be told I've tried my best But somewhere along the way I got caught up in all there was to offer And the cost was so much more than I could bear  Though I've tried, I've fallen... I have sunk so low I have messed up Better I should know So don't come round here And tell me I told you so...  We all begin with good intent Love was raw and young We believed that we could change ourselves THe past could be undone But we carry on our backs the burden Time always reveals The lonely light of morning The wound that would not heal It's the bitter taste of losing everything That I have held so dear.  I've fallen... I have sunk so low I have messed up Better I should know So don't come round here And tell me I told you so...  Heaven bent to take my hand Nowhere left to turn I'm lost to those I thought were friends To everyone I know Oh they turned their heads embarassed Pretend that they don't see But it's one missed step You'll slip before you know it And there doesn't seem a way to be redeemed  Though I've tried, I've fallen... I have sunk so low I have messed up Better I should know So don't come round here And tell me I told you so... [2X]  "Possession" by sarah mclachlan  Listen as the wind blows from across the great divide, Voices trapped in yearning, memories trapped in time, The night is my companion and solitude my guide, Would I spend forever here and not be satisfied?  And I would be the one to hold you down, kiss you so hard, I'll take your breath away and after I'd wipe away the tears, Just close your eyes dear  Through this world I've stumbled so many times betrayed, Trying to find an honest word, to find the truth enslaved, Oh you speak to me in riddles and you speak to me in rhyme My body aches to breathe your breath, you words keep me alive,  And I would be the one to hold you down, kiss you so hard, I'll take your breath away and after I'd wipe away the tears, Just close your eyes dear  Into this night I wander, it's morning that I dread, Another day of knowing of the path I fear to tread, Oh into the sea of waking dreams I follow without pride, Nothing stands between us here and I won't be denied  And I would be the one to hold you down, kiss you so hard, I'll take your breath away and after I'd wipe away the tears, Just close your eyes dear  "Building A Mystery" by sarah mclachlan  you come out at night that's when the energy comes and the dark side's light and the vampires roam you strut your rasta wear and your suicide poem and a cross from a faith that died before Jesus came you're building a mystery  you live in a church where you sleep with voodoo dolls and you won't give up the search for the ghosts in the halls you wear sandals in the snow and a smile that won't wash away can you look out the window without your shadow getting in the way oh you're so beautiful with an edge and a charm but so careful when I'm in your arms  ::Chorus::LyricsCafe.com:: 'cause you're working building a mystery holding on and holding it in yeah you're working building a mystery and choosing so carefully  you woke up screaming aloud a prayer from your secret god you feed off our fears and hold back your tears  give us a tantrum and a know it all grin just when we need one when the evening's thin  oh you're a beautiful a beautiful fucked up man you're setting up your razor wire shrine  ::Chorus::LyricsCafe.com::  {repeat chorus} Taxi Ride by tori amos  Lily is dancing on the table We've all been Pushed Too far I guess on days like this you know who your friends are Just another Dead Fag to you that's all Just another Light missing on a long taxi ride taxi ride  And I'm down to Your last cigarette and this "We are one" crap as you're invading This thing you call Love - she smiles way too much but I'm glad you're on my side, sure I'm glad you're on my side still  You think you deserve a trust fund Just because you Want one Sure you talk the talk when you need to I fear the whole world is starting to Believe you Just another Dead Fag to you that's all Just another Light missing in a long taxi line taxi line  And I"m down to Your last cigarette and this "We are one" crap as you're invading This thing you call Love - she smiles way too much but I'm glad you're on my side, sure I'm glad you're on my side still  Lily is dancing on the table We've all been pushed Too far today Even a glamorous Bitch can be in need this is where you know the Honey from the Killer Bees +I'm glad you're on my side sure I'm glad you're on my side sure I'm glad you're on my side still  Got a long taxi ride Got a long taxi ride  "Don't Tell Me" avril lavigne  You held my hand and walked me home I know While you gave me that kiss it was something like this it made me go ooh ohh You wiped my tears, got rid of all my fears, why did you have to go? Guess it wasn't enough to take up some of my love cause you're so hard to trust Did I not tell you that I'm not like that girl? The one who gives it all away  [Chorus:] Did you think that I was gonna give it up to you, this time? Did you think that I was somethin I was gonna do and cry? Don't try to tell me what to do, Dont try to tell me what to say, Your better off that way  Don't think that your charmin the fact that your arm is now around my neck I got you in my pants I'll have to kick your ass and make you never forget I'm gonna ask you to stop, thought I liked you a lot, but I'm really upset Get out of my head get off of my bed yeah thats what I said Did I not tell you that I'm not like that, the one who, throws it all away  [Chorus] Did you think that I was gonna give it up to you, this time? Did you think that I was somethin I was gonna do and cry? Don't try to tell me what to do, Dont try to tell me what to say, Your better off that way  This guilt trip that you put me on won't, mess me up I've done no wrong Any thoughts of you and me have gone away  [Chorus] Did you think that I was gonna give it up to you, this time? Did you think that I was somethin I was gonna do and cry? Don't try to tell me what to do, Dont try to tell me what to say, Your better off that way  Better off that way I'm better off alone anyway   "My World" avril lavigne  Please tell me what is taking place Cause I can't seem to find a trace Guess it must have got erased somehow Probably cause I always forget Everytime someone tells me their name It's always gotta be the same  Never wore cover-up Always beat the boys up Grew up in a 5,000 population town Made my money by cutting grass Got fired by a fried chicken ass All in a small town: Napanee  You know I always stay up without sleeping And think to myself where do I belong forever In whose arm the time and place  Can't help it if I space in a daze My eyes tune out the other way I may switch off and go in a day dream In this head my thoughts are deep Sometimes I can't even speak Would someone be and not pretend I'm off again in my world  I never spend less than an hour Washing my hair in the shower It always takes 5 hours to make it straight So I'll braid it in a zillion braids Though it may take all friggen day There's nothing else better to do anyway  When you're all alone in the lands of forever Lay under the milky way On and on it's getting too late out I'm not in love this time, this night  Can't help it if I space in a daze My eyes tune out the other way I may switch off and go in a day dream In this head my thoughts are deep Sometimes I can't even speak Would someone be and not pretend I'm off again in my world  Take some time, mellow out Party it up but don't fall down Dont get caught sneak out of the house  Can't help it if I space in a daze My eyes tune out the other way I may switch off and go in a day dream In this head my thoughts are deep Sometimes I can't even speak Would someone be and not pretend I'm off again in my world  Can't help it if I space in a daze My eyes tune out the other way I may switch off and go in a day dream In this head my thoughts are deep Sometimes I can't even speak Would someone be and not pretend I'm off again in my world  vertical horizon Echo  Echo, echo... We come, we go-woah No I don't want to be just another Echo, echo...  Everywhere I go There's something I really need Everyone I know Is someone I want to be Even though I don't really know me  I better pick it up Before I let it slip away I better stick it out Before I take another day Into mouth Everything I say fades out  Echo, echo... We come, we go-woah No I don't want to be just another Echo, echo...  Can I open up your eyes? Only when the clouds break? Can I feel the light? Even though the world shakes Every night, You're my quiet satellite  Can I hold you close? Do her out of focus And everything I know I don't even know this It all falls through I'm here and I hear you  Echo, echo... We come, we go-woah No I don't want to be just another Echo, echo...  Do you hear me? Do you hear me? Cause I need to, just to reach you Do you hear me? Coming clearly? Am I hollow? Just an echo  Echo, echo... We come, we go-woah No I don't want to be just another Echo, echo... Echo, echo... We come, we go-woah No I don't want to be just another Echo, echo...  "Shackled"  For so long my life's been sewn up tight inside your hold And it leaves me there without a place to call my own  I know now what shadows can see There's no point in running 'less you run with me It's half the distance through the open door Before you cut me down Again Let me introduce you to the end  And I feel the cold wind blowing beneath my wings It always leads me back to suffering But I will soar until the wind whips me down Leaves me beaten on unholy ground again  So tired now of paying my dues I start out strong but then I always lose It's half the distance before you leave me behind It's such a waste of time  ::Chorus:: 'Cause my shackles You won't be And my rapture You won't believe And deep inside you will bleed for me  So here I slave inside of a broken dream Forever holding on to splitting seams So take your piece and leave me alone to die I don't need you to keep my faith alive  I know now what trouble can be And why it follows me so easily It's half the distance through the open door Before you shut me down Again Let me introduce you to the end  ::Chorus::  Though you know you care  ::Chorus:: And my laughter You won't hear The faster I disappear And time will burn your eyes to tears

      "Circle" by Sarah Mclachlan  There are two of us talking in circles and one of us who wants to leave in a world created for only us an empty cage that has no key don't you know we're working with flesh and blood carving out of jealousy Crawling into each other it's smothering every little part of me What kind of love is this that keeps me hanging on despite everything it's doing to me what is this love that keeps me coming back for more when it will only end in misery I know too many people unhappy in a life from which they'd love to flee watching others get everything offered they're wanton for discovery Oh my brother my sister my mother you're loosing your identity can't you see that it's you in the window shining with intensity What kind of love is this that keeps me hanging on despite everything it's doing to me what is this love that keeps me coming back for more when it will only end in misery...

      "Fumbling Towards Ecstasy"  All the fear has left me now I'm not frightened anymore It's my heart that pounds beneath my flesh it's my mouth that pushes out this breath and if I shed a tear I won't cage it I won't fear love and if I feel a rage I won't deny it I won't fear love Companion to our demons they will dance, and we will play With chairs, candles, and cloth making darkness in the day It will be easy to look in or out upstream or down without a thought and if I shed a tear I won't cage it I won't fear love and if I feel a rage I won't deny it I won't fear love Peace in the struggle to find peace comfort on the way to comfort and if I shed a tear I won't cage it I won't fear love and if I feel a rage I won't deny it I won't fear love I won't fear love I won't fear love.

      "Fear" by Sarah Mclachlan  Morning smiles like the face of a newborn child, innocent, unknowing.  Winter's end promises of a long lost friend. Speaks to me of comfort  But I fear I have nothing to give. I have so much to loose here in this lonely place. Tangled up in your embrace There's there's nothing I'd like better than to fall. But I fear I have nothing to give.  Wind in time Rapes the flower trembling on the vine And nothing yields to shelter it from above. The say temptation will destroy our love. The never ending hunger  But I fear I have nothing to give I have so much to loose here in this lonely place Tangled up in our embrace Theres nothing I'd like better than to fall But I fear I have nothing to give. I have so much to loose. I have nothing to give. We have so much to lose...

      Time by Sarah McLachlan  Time here, all but means nothing, just shadows that move across the wall They keep me company, but they don't ask of me they don't say nothing at all. And I need just a little more silence And I need just a little more time But you send your thieves to me silently stalking me Dragging me into your wall Would you give me no choice in this? I know you can't resist, trying reopen a sore  Leave me be, I don't want to argue I'd just get confused and I'd come all undone If I agree, well, it's just to appease you Cause I don't remember what we're fighting for  You see love-- a tight, thorny thread that you spin in a circle of gold You have me to hold me a token for all to see captured to be yours alone And I need just a little more silence, and I just need a little more time The courage to pull away there will be hell to pay the deeper you cut to the bone  Leave me be, I don't want to argue I'd just get confused and I'd come all undone If I agree, well, it's just to appease you Cause I don't remember what we're fighting for  Time here, all but means nothing, just shadows that move across the wall They keep me company, but they don't ask of me they don't say nothing at all.  Leave me be, I don't want to argue I'd just get confused and I'd come all undone If I agree, well, it's just to appease you Cause I don't remember what we're fighting for

      Trainwreck by Sarah McLachlan  Your love in all it's finery Tear up the darkness all around me Until I can breathe again Until I believe again  Cause I'm a trainwreck Waiting to happen Waiting for someone to come pick me up off the tracks A wild fire born of frustration Born of a world, oh, that gets me so high I've no fear at all  But your eyes like midnight fireflys Light up the trenches where our loves lies Until I can see again Find my way back again  Cause I'm a trainwreck Waiting to happen Waiting for someone to come pick me up off the tracks A wild fire born of frustration Born of a world, oh, that gets me so high  I've no fear at all To fall so deep into you Loose myself completely In your sweet embrace All my pain's erased  And your mouth, it's all that I wish Mercy of your lips, just one kiss Until I can breathe again Until I can sing again  Cause I'm a trainwreck Waiting to happen Waiting for someone to come pick me up off the tracks A wild fire born of frustration Born of a world, oh, that gets me so high  I've no fear at all To fall so deep into you Loose myself completely In your sweet embrace All my pain's erased

      "I Will Remember You" by Sarah McLachlan I will remember you Will you remember me? Don't let your life pass you by Weep not for the memories  Remember the good times that we had? I let them slip away from us when things got bad How clearly I first saw you smilin' in the sun Wanna feel your warmth upon me, I wanna be the one  I will remember you Will you remember me? Don't let your life pass you by Weep not for the memories  I'm so tired but I can't sleep Standin' on the edge of something much too deep It's funny how we feel so much but we cannot say a word We are screaming inside, but we can't be heard  But I will remember you Will you remember me? Don't let your life pass you by Weep not for the memories  I'm so afraid to love you, but more afraid to loose Clinging to a past that doesn't let me choose Once there was a darkness, deep and endless night You gave me everything you had, oh you gave me light  And I will remember you Will you remember me? Don't let your life pass you by Weep not for the memories  And I will remember you Will you remember me? Don't let your life pass you by Weep not for the memories Weep not for the memories

      "Full Of Grace" by Sarah Mclachlan  The winter here's cold and bitter, it's chilled us to the bone. We haven't seen the sun for weeks, too long, too far from home. I feel just like I'm sinking, and I claw for solid ground. I'm pulled down by the undertow, I never thought I could feel so low, and, oh, darkness, I feel like letting go.  If all of the strength and all of the courage come and lift me from this place. I know I can love you much better than this: Full of grace, Full of grace, my love.  It's better this way, I said, Haven't seen this place before. Where everything we say and do, hurts us all the more. It's just that we stayed too long in the same old sickly scheme, and I'm pulled down by the undertow, I never thought I could feel so low, and, oh, darkness, I feel like letting go.  If all of the strength and all of the courage come and lift me from this place I know I can love you much better than this: Full of grace, full of grace.  I know I can love you much better than this.  It's better this way.

Everywhere I go There's something I really need Everyone I know Is someone I want to be Even though I don't really know me  I better pick it up Before I let it slip away I better stick it out Before I take another day Into mouth Everything I say fades out  Echo, echo... We come, we go-woah No I don't want to be just another Echo, echo...  Can I open up your eyes? Only when the clouds break? Can I feel the light? Even though the world shakes Every night, You're my quiet satellite  Can I hold you close? Do her out of focus And everything I know I don't even know this It all falls through I'm here and I hear you  Echo, echo... We come, we go-woah No I don't want to be just another Echo, echo...  Do you hear me? Do you hear me? Cause I need to, just to reach you Do you hear me? Coming clearly? Am I hollow? Just an echo  Echo, echo... We come, we go-woah No I don't want to be just another Echo, echo... Echo, echo... We come, we go-woah No I don't want to be just another Echo, echo...

      "My World" avril lavigne  Please tell me what is taking place Cause I can't seem to find a trace Guess it must have got erased somehow Probably cause I always forget Everytime someone tells me their name It's always gotta be the same  Never wore cover-up Always beat the boys up Grew up in a 5,000 population town Made my money by cutting grass Got fired by a fried chicken ass All in a small town: Napanee  You know I always stay up without sleeping And think to myself where do I belong forever In whose arm the time and place  Can't help it if I space in a daze My eyes tune out the other way I may switch off and go in a day dream In this head my thoughts are deep Sometimes I can't even speak Would someone be and not pretend I'm off again in my world  I never spend less than an hour Washing my hair in the shower It always takes 5 hours to make it straight So I'll braid it in a zillion braids Though it may take all friggen day There's nothing else better to do anyway  When you're all alone in the lands of forever Lay under the milky way On and on it's getting too late out I'm not in love this time, this night  Can't help it if I space in a daze My eyes tune out the other way I may switch off and go in a day dream In this head my thoughts are deep Sometimes I can't even speak Would someone be and not pretend I'm off again in my world  Take some time, mellow out Party it up but don't fall down Dont get caught sneak out of the house  Can't help it if I space in a daze My eyes tune out the other way I may switch off and go in a day dream In this head my thoughts are deep Sometimes I can't even speak Would someone be and not pretend I'm off again in my world  Can't help it if I space in a daze My eyes tune out the other way I may switch off and go in a day dream In this head my thoughts are deep Sometimes I can't even speak Would someone be and not pretend I'm off again in my world

Guess it wasn't enough to take up some of my love cause you're so hard to trust Did I not tell you that I'm not like that girl? The one who gives it all away  [Chorus:] Did you think that I was gonna give it up to you, this time? Did you think that I was somethin I was gonna do and cry? Don't try to tell me what to do, Dont try to tell me what to say, Your better off that way  Don't think that your charmin the fact that your arm is now around my neck I got you in my pants I'll have to kick your ass and make you never forget I'm gonna ask you to stop, thought I liked you a lot, but I'm really upset Get out of my head get off of my bed yeah thats what I said Did I not tell you that I'm not like that, the one who, throws it all away  [Chorus] Did you think that I was gonna give it up to you, this time? Did you think that I was somethin I was gonna do and cry? Don't try to tell me what to do, Dont try to tell me what to say, Your better off that way  This guilt trip that you put me on won't, mess me up I've done no wrong Any thoughts of you and me have gone away  [Chorus] Did you think that I was gonna give it up to you, this time? Did you think that I was somethin I was gonna do and cry? Don't try to tell me what to do, Dont try to tell me what to say, Your better off that way  Better off that way I'm better off alone anyway

      "Building A Mystery" by sarah mclachlan  you come out at night that's when the energy comes and the dark side's light and the vampires roam you strut your rasta wear and your suicide poem and a cross from a faith that died before Jesus came you're building a mystery  you live in a church where you sleep with voodoo dolls and you won't give up the search for the ghosts in the halls you wear sandals in the snow and a smile that won't wash away can you look out the window without your shadow getting in the way oh you're so beautiful with an edge and a charm but so careful when I'm in your arms  ::Chorus: 'cause you're working building a mystery holding on and holding it in yeah you're working building a mystery and choosing so carefully  you woke up screaming aloud a prayer from your secret god you feed off our fears and hold back your tears  give us a tantrum and a know it all grin just when we need one when the evening's thin  oh you're a beautiful a beautiful fucked up man you're setting up your razor wire shrine  ::Chorus:  {repeat chorus}

      "Fallen" by sarah mclachlan  Heaven bent to take my hand And lead me through the fire Be the long awaited answer To a long and painful fight  Truth be told I've tried my best But somewhere along the way I got caught up in all there was to offer And the cost was so much more than I could bear  Though I've tried, I've fallen... I have sunk so low I have messed up Better I should know So don't come round here And tell me I told you so...  We all begin with good intent Love was raw and young We believed that we could change ourselves THe past could be undone But we carry on our backs the burden Time always reveals The lonely light of morning The wound that would not heal It's the bitter taste of losing everything That I have held so dear.  I've fallen... I have sunk so low I have messed up Better I should know So don't come round here And tell me I told you so...  Heaven bent to take my hand Nowhere left to turn I'm lost to those I thought were friends To everyone I know Oh they turned their heads embarassed Pretend that they don't see But it's one missed step You'll slip before you know it And there doesn't seem a way to be redeemed  Though I've tried, I've fallen... I have sunk so low I have messed up Better I should know So don't come round here And tell me I told you so... [2X]

      "Possession" by sarah mclachlan  Listen as the wind blows from across the great divide, Voices trapped in yearning, memories trapped in time, The night is my companion and solitude my guide, Would I spend forever here and not be satisfied?  And I would be the one to hold you down, kiss you so hard, I'll take your breath away and after I'd wipe away the tears, Just close your eyes dear  Through this world I've stumbled so many times betrayed, Trying to find an honest word, to find the truth enslaved, Oh you speak to me in riddles and you speak to me in rhyme My body aches to breathe your breath, you words keep me alive,  And I would be the one to hold you down, kiss you so hard, I'll take your breath away and after I'd wipe away the tears, Just close your eyes dear  Into this night I wander, it's morning that I dread, Another day of knowing of the path I fear to tread, Oh into the sea of waking dreams I follow without pride, Nothing stands between us here and I won't be denied  And I would be the one to hold you down, kiss you so hard, I'll take your breath away and after I'd wipe away the tears, Just close your eyes dear

      "Goodbye To You" by michelle branch  Of all the things I believe in I just want to get it over with tears from behind my eyes but I do not cry Counting the days that past me by  I've been searching deep down in my soul Words that I'm hearing are starting to get old Looks like I'm starting all over again The last three years were just pretend and I say  Goodbye to you Goodbye to everything I thought I knew You were the one I love The one thing that I tried to hold on to  I still get lost in your eyes And it seems like I can't live a day without you Closing my eyes till you chase my thoughts away To a place where I am blinded by the light but it's not right  Goodbye to you Goodbye to everything I thought I knew You were the one I loved The one thing that I tried to hold on to  Ohhh yeah It hurts to want everything & nothing at the same time I want whats yours and I want whats mine I want you but I'm not giving in this time  Goodbye to you Goodbye to everything I thought I knew You were the one I loved The one thing that I tried to hold on to The one thing that I tried to hold on to  Goodbye to you Goodbye to everything I thought I knew You were the one I loved The one thing that I tried to hold on to  We the stars fall and I lie awake Your my shooting star
