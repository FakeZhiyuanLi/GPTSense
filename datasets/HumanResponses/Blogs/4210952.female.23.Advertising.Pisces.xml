         This morning at my office seems to be so long... I feel a little bored of this job. Fortunately, everything will be finished on friday ! The point is there is nothing to do... Main part of the staff is on holidays, so days are too much calm. I would rather being in a rush. More funny. I like to have some stress in my professional life. I like working in the emergency. It's better than staring at the clock all morning long, waiting for freedom ! I know that I will miss some people I met there. First of all : Val, my colleague which is here on afternoons. This girl is really nice. (Well, Val, I know you're gonna read this post, so believe me, it's quite sincere !). She's fun, always dynamic, always smiling, talking and laughing ! I like people like that, who enjoy life. I think it's a good way to go ahead. I met some very cool people in here, but some are really pissing me off (sorry for that) and have always something to complain about. Maybe they think as we're are poor hostess we don't have a brain, we're not abble to think ??? I hate this idea ! Nevermind, I have to put in my head that being an hostess is not really a job for me. I think I'm going to have a sleep this afternoon, I'm tired... I'm going to lose my mind in my dreams... I love that ! I'm feeling nostalgic today, that's strange... Not really sad, not really happy... I'm bored. I just wanna come back to my home, go to bed and put my thoughts off ! That's all. There are days like that... It will be better tomorrow !

          The sun is not shining today, rain doesn't want to stop... Bad weather for summer. In Toulouse, we're not used to have such a bad weather during summer. Pretty sad day. I don't like it. Nevermind, I'm alright ! I spent the evening and the night with my Max, it was cool. Watched a DVD, Phonegame. Pretty bad movie. We drunk some white wine, smoked a lot of cigarets, and talked about us, about life. It was fun. Today is off for him. So good ! I had to wake up to take my job at 8 A.M, had a coffee, a shower, kissed him and drove to my office. Here I am, looking trough the window, typing on my keyboard everything's coming to my head. We're going to spend the day together, I don't know what we're going to do with this bad weather. Maybe some shopping... like a old couple of lovers ! Maybe just stay together, have a drink with some friends in order to change the world once again, with our words, our thoughts. My mom has been surprised last week end when she joined us at the beach, and when she discovered I had a boyfriend... She had a wiered behaviour. In fact, I didn't want to tell her I was with Max, cause I don't know how our story's going to be. It's only two weeks we know us. My mom told me : "You could have told me you had a boyfriend !" It was funny ! I know there's no matter with her concerning my personal life, she's pretty cool with this, but I know that once she would be back from her holidays, she's going to ask me lots of questions, and I'll probably answer her : "Well, mum, please don't be so curious, I don't wanna speak about it  right now..." Arrrrf, I'm sure this going to happen ! I have the possibility to spent few days with some friends of mine at the ocean, but I don't know yet if I'll go. I had plan these holidays before meeting Max, and now that I'm feeling good with him, it's hard for me to take a decision. I think I'll go. It's going to be pretty cool. And as I worked all summer long, I will enjoy spending 4 days far from Toulouse, with cool guys. In september, I will be in Paris for a job, I'll be an hostess for the Car World Fair, and if I'm still with my cute boyfriend, it's gonna be hard for me to be far away from him during      like a month ! Life is life ! I know, there are   worst issues in life than that ! I know, I know.

         Monday morning... 9.00 A.M... typing this post from the desk of my job... feeling a little bit depressed and sad after this wonderful week end at the beach. It was... wonderful,paradisiac... Sun, beach, friends, my cuty boyfriend, I was feeling so good, I wish I could have stayed there with Max (cuty boy) some more days, enjoying life... with him. That's amazing, we know eachother for only two weeks, but this week end has made us becoming clother, it was really great... I can't believe what's happening with him... At the begining, I was not planning to have a big love story. But now, I'm changing my mind. This situation is a little bit terrifying me, but nevermind, I really want to try something with him, even if maybe it won't work between us, even if... Well, I had a such wonderful week end that all my thoughts are for these great moments we had together. Swimming, kissing in the sea, walking hand in hand in the sand, (stereotypes of lovers, I know, I know, LOL), dancing all night long in a club, telling one eachother some sweety words, it was so good. He is so much nice with me, he takes care of me, he loves kisses and has a great power of seduction on me. I didn't think it was possible after two weeks to speak of Max like I do, but life is beautiful (do not forget that, guys !), life is full of surprises, everyday can be so incredible... I'm on another planet, i can't say i'm in love, but I think I'm begining to have some feelings for him (Oh my god, is it me speaking ???!!!). I don't want to go to fast (I'm afraid of heartbreaking, LOL), I need to know him more, and I know that the begining of a story is always so much fun, but I'm going to do my best to have a nice relationship with my cutyboy, I know I want it. You must think I'm in love while reading these sentences full of beautiful words. Maybe I am... Maybe I'm not. In fact, I know I'm afraid of love. Love means feelings, and feelings can also mean sadness and emptyness. I don't wanna cry. I don't wanna be sick... crazy of love... No, thanks ! At the same time, I don't want to lose him because of that fear. No, thanks ! I hope I won't be disapointed, I hope he's quite sincere with me, I hope I can let my feelings grow, I think I can. I have the choice between living our story without thinking too much about it, or I can also refuse to involve myself in it. My choice is done. Guess what I'm gonna do ? I'm gonna live, I'm gonna feel free, and then we'll see !   It's time for me to go...       See you !

            Hi everybody !   Funny day today... We're on friday morning, it's like 10.30 AM, and I'm totally out !!! I had a very hard night, went out with some friends, it was cool, we first had a drink at the Florida, a caf√© well known in Toulouse (Place du Capitole), and then we went to a club, we danced a lot on the floor (hip hop music, so cool !), we drunk some vodka with fudge (hmmm...), and after that, I came back to home with my cuty boyfriend, and I can tell you that the night has been very short (don't imagine anything, we just slept, slept !) ! It has been so hard for me to wake up this morning, I couldn't manage to do it !!! The fact is I feel like I'm on holidays, but I'm not !!! I have to work, but summer for me is the period I really prefer so I feel like enjoying these beautiful sunny days, as well as these crazy drunky nights, but I have to be cool cause business is business ! To finish with it, I was late to take my job, and I hate it ! I'm often late in the context of my personal life, my friends are used to wait for me, they know I'm like that, so they don't try to change me anymore (thanks, guys !). But being late is a thing you can't deal with in the context of your job, that's not funky, this sucks ! So I'm not proud of me, really, I feel bad, even if I stop this job within a week. I expect me to be more serious in the future, I'm gonna work on it, I have to. The week end is not far for me, I quit my job at 13.00 PM, and I'm waiting for it like kids are waiting for Christmas !(LOL, what am I saying ??? Sorry, maybe some rests of vodka...) Well, I'm going to spend my week end at the beach, with friends and cuty boy :-) I think it's gonna be alright !     urlLink www.blogger.com  : In fact this concept is crazy !!! I'm just amazed to think that I'm writing some parts of my life (pooor life, LOL) and that people from all over the world have the possibility to read it ! That's really really crazy, men ! The point is I'm not even persuaded that one person has already surfed on my little skinny blog... maybe I should stop it... No, in fact no, I'm going to go ahead, and I'm sure that if someone find my blog, one day, he or she will ad a little comment or maybe just a "Hi girl, how are you ? Here is my blog blablabla..." It would be very great ! So, understand ? IF SOMEONE HEARS ME, PLEASE LET ME KNOW IT !!!   Boys and girls from all over the world : it's time for me to say good bye.      GOOD BYE

        Hi everybody !      I'm really happy to introduce myself to you, and a little bit stressed of writing my first post !   Well, let's get started ! First of all, I'd like to thank Valeria, my job's collegue who has showed me this extraordinary website ! A last thing before begining to talk more about me, I'd like to tell you that my english is not perfect (I think you've already seen it !), but I swear I'll try to do my best, so please don't be shocked by grammar and vocabulary mistakes ! English is really a language I enjoy to speak, and that's why I think blogger can be a good way for me to improve a little bit my level...   So, my name is Soraya, I'm 23 years old, I live in the south of France, in a very beautiful city called Toulouse ( "the Pink City" ), and for the moment I'm working as an hostess. I finished my studies last year, I obtained a Mastere degree in advertising in the Trade School of Toulouse in december, and since february, I'm looking for a job in an advertising agency, but it's really hard for me to find it in Toulouse, so I decided to do some little jobs until I find the job of my dreams... I learned English at school, and I went several times to England, Canada and USA, but it's been a long long long time (more than 2 years) that I didnt' move from Toulouse to travel, and I'm really really really missing it !   Now that you've learned some more stuffes about me, it's time for me to surf on blogger.com, cause i have everything to discover on the website...    See you soon !
