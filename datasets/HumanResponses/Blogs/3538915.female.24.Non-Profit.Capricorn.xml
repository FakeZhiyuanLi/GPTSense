      Well, Shawn went out today to get some stuff from the store and ended up getting new tires on the van -- he had a blow out. Now is it just me, or does our van have an uncommonly high number of blow-outs? It just seems strange to me that we have so stinking many. Oh well, anyway, he wasn't hurt and besides sitting on the side of the road trying to get the jack under the van for over two hours, none worse for wear. I guess I should just be happy about that (and happy about the fact that it wasn't me 8 months pregnant this time.) So anyway, even though we're off from church tonight, here we sit at the church. I think that's pretty sad that we couldn't find anything more interesting to do than to come up to the church and play video games on the computer. How sad our lives have become. We went to Columbia yesterday just to hang out and eat some BBQ. I thought it was gross, but Shawn liked it, I guess. And then we tried to go see some old friends but no one was home, so we just came back home. Let's see, that's about all that's happening with my life.  The newest (and grandest) idea that I've come up with is a drive-in movie theater. It would be wasome good. And it would only take probably 100,000 dollars to get it started. Pocket change, I'll get started right away. Christian has gotten into the Wiggles and so now we have all those silly songs running through our heads constantly. The newest one is one with the Crocodile Hunter on it. It's actually pretty good. Now that's how truly sad my life has become. I went bowling with our ladies group Friday night. It was fun, but it made me miss all the fun we used to have on our team. Very bittersweet. It's okay here in Lancaster, but it's not the same.  Anyway, that's all for now.

      Well, here it is a Saturday and I'm sitting here with nothing to do. I went yard-saling this morning and didn't find a thing that I wanted. It makes me so mad when they put out these big signs that say "Huge Yard Sale" and "Don't miss this one" and then you go and it's all junk. I have enough junk, I wanted to find something I couldn't live without. I did find Miss Priss a toy that had a baby swing and a high chair and a bassinett. And you push the remote control and the little baby cries and swings and stuff. It was pretty cool, but she was totally uninterested. Oh well, maybe one day she'll appreciate it. I also found one great pair of pants that would make me look all cool and young and hip and stuff. Except for the fact that I have too much lard in my gut and it squished out over the top and was just really disgusting. It was like a sausage in the casing. Very disturbing stuff. So all in all, it was a wash. But there's always next week.  I just looked down at Miss Priss and she has orange marker all over her face. Apparently, it tasted pretty good. Thank goodness for non-toxic......

      So I guess since everyone else is doing it, I should too, huh? Well, I really have nothing to say. I guess I'll get better with this as time goes on, huh?

      Well, we have finally returned from the wonderful wanderings in the wilderness...or something like that. It was certainly not without it's excitement. Like I caught the van on fire while we're driving down the interstate doing 70 miles an hour. That was fun. Or the fact that we got lost going....EVERYWHERE. I think I'd take the toxic death-inducing flames over that any day. Anyway, we have decided (without much discussion) that from now on vacation will be just that...vacation. Not frantically trying to see everyone and be everywhere and do everything for other people that you will end up making mad anyway because you missed something. I don't know if that made any sense or not, but I only got a total of 12 hours of sleep the whole entire "vacation" so who can blame me for rambling? And so now, here I am getting ready to have the kick-off for VBS and already, I've made the other director mad at me because of...well, who knows why. I guess I forgot to do something or I don't know what. Anyway, it's going to be a thrilling week.
