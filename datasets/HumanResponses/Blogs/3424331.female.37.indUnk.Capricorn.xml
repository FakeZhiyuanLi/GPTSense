But this is the news of the day I did my weigh in and I was 168, today am 164 I still have 50 pounds to go but its a start. L and G havent given me their weights yet. Ok G just gave me hers shes at 151. And she wants to loose 20. And L is at 157 and she also wants to loose 20. And so we are off like a herd of screaming turtles.

      Thank you Herb for your comment. Its kinda nice to know that other people are feeling the same way. Today's topic is....lets see..Some peoples children!! Ok do you folks have the slightest idea how your "lil darlins" act when you arent around!? I hear language out of kids mouths that would make a sailor blush! And I mean children under 13 btw. I see then throwing rocks at cars driving by on the street. And can you please teach them to actually put their trash IN a trash can?! OK OK I'm done ...for now.

      I was just walking Max and I wonder....WHY IS IT THAT PEOPLE WITH HUGE DOGS LEAVE THE POOP??!!!! OMG I see piles that look like a person dumped there! Why? Seems like the bigger the dog the less the owner is willing to clean up after it. And in the Arizona heat, it smells very bad and then theres all these flies all over it. Its just gross. PICK UP AFTER YOUR DOG OR DONT HAVE A DOG!! sheesh....

      Well a couple of people I havent seen lately ran into me and commented that I am lookin like I am losing weight! So that is a good thing. Bad thing is I dont feel like I am....But I am still doing the low carb thing. Gotta go shoppin today cause I threw up before work today and realized that since I ran out of food and have been living out of the 76 that Ive been living on beef jerkey for 3 days.

      Well I've been looking at some of the other blogs. Is it me or is this blog thing mostly bored school kids? And I am sorry but some of you need to pay more attention in English class!!! Your spelling is horrible. But anyway saw some that were pretty good, mostly from Australia (go figure). I have a friend in Australia haven't spoken to him lately tho. But Good God I need a life! All I do is work, walk the puppy, play EQ, and sleep. No wonder I can't find a guy to hang out with.

      Well here I am sitting at work keeping on eye on our veterans and thinking. Thinking about the one that got away again, thinking about why my life is where it is, which is basically nowhere, and thinking what can I do to change the way I'm viewing things right now. I wonder where that girl went who  felt that she was worthy, felt that she could handle anything, and knew that she was loved. Why do I feel now like nothing I do Is good enough? Men don't stay, and I know that it is something I have done or not done. I am not skinny enough, smart enough, charming enough or something...Even the ONE from my past that I wanted more than anything to have love me back has stopped making time for me. I am simply sick and tired of being alone. I don't want a husband. Just a date now and then...Why am I not good enough just the way I am? Anyway nevermind, I am just getting some stuff off my chest I'll get over it.

      I gave Max to a friend tonight. And I am torn up about it. I think he will be happier there because someone will be home with him 24/7 but I also think I did it because I don't want the responsibilty. And I REALLY hate feeling like I gave up. Hoping venting here will make me feel better. But he looked happy when they walked off and I see her almost everyday so I can check on him. Sheesh...ok....shutting up now. I am just trying to convince myself I did the right thing and only time will tell.
