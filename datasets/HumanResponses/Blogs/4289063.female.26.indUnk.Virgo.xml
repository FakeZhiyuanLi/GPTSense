      First dates should be filled with laughter, in my opinion, so why wouldn't we begin at a local comedy club? We met up, and the fool let me drive, and of course I get us lost, but this was foreseen, and I had a backup plan. My friend lives in the area and was patiently waiting for the call so she could redirect us to the club. He wasn't very impressed with my driving I noticed, "allegedly" I almost hit a curb. We arrive and are seated right up front....Which wasn't the best idea I have ever had. The comedian found out it was our first date so he dedicated a small portion of the show to our humiliation, which was very generous of him, don't you think? We laughed our butts off, though. After the show we met up with a few of my friends for some drinks. All and all, it was a good time.....Worth repeating, I think.

      Okay, so I have finished getting ready for my concert and I have approximately 1.5 hours until the limo arrives. How do I kill the time? By telling you all about tomorrow's date. You see, there is this boy (they're all boys to me) that I work with, whom I swore I wouldn't date. There are two reasons why I didn't want to date him 1. Because I told everyone that I don't date people I work with (which is a b.s. reason, I know, but it's an easy excuse to get people to back off). 2. Because this particular boy has a reputation within our company that I was trying not to associate myself with. So why are we going out? Because one drunken afternoon we shared a wonderful, definitely in the top 3 category, kiss. We have good chemistry as he put it. Besides I haven't had a date in 2.5 months, and did I mention that kiss?!!! Anyway, I will let you all know how it goes, wish me luck!

      Okay, so here I am, reading my friend's blog ( just trying to keep up with her busy life ), when up in the corner, virtually screaming at me......  get your own blog  !!! ( it couldn't have been any worse if they had double-dog dared me).    which brings us together, my blog and I. Here is where I write what I am thinking, as I am thinking it....Which incidentally may lead to rambling. If it gets confusing follow these steps 1. Slow down 2. Back up 3. Read over in an Australian accent. If that doesn't help: rinse and repeat. okay, now that you know nothing about me, let's get started.... before you get yourself into this blog thing too deeply there are a few things you should know... I. Things I do not appreciate A. Stupid people. Not necessarily uneducated, but ignorant; in fact, my favorite (and currently misplaced) T-shirt reads: I will try being nicer if you try being smarter. B. Spiders. Okay, that's too limited. I hate anything with more than two legs that is not on a leash. C. Being chased. Be it in a game of t.v. tag or by some creepy mentally disabled guy in a local walmart (more on that later), I don't like it. In fact don't even stand behind me, if I can't see you, you are a threat and I may have to react. D. When my mom wants to learn me how to do something...Like worsh the clothes. II. Things I do appreciate A. A captain morgan's and ginger ale. Anytime, any place. B. Waking up and wondering where I am and how I got there. (this may have something to do with II A.) C. A good laugh. Which isn't hard to come by, considering I can find humor in just about any situation. D. Getting a phone call by someone offering a ticket to tonight's sold out Kenny Chesney concert completely accommodated with a to/fro limo. (just got the call 30 seconds ago!) III. My biggest regrets A. Marriage. I was young and stupid, hey we all make mistakes right? B. Giving my 8 year old daughter her own cell phone. What was I drinking? C. Tracking down an old high school flame via the internet, which in turn lead to a crappy 2.25 year relationship. Hind sight is 20/20.  okay this is enough for now, while you take this all in, I have a concert to prepare for.....Have a nice day!!
