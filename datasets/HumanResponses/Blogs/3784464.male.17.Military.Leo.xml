      OK, THERE'S the news about Iraq, after the sports section.  Gotta hook them in before you bore them to death with real news.

       urlLink CNN.com : "Cassini races toward Saturn orbit Cassini races toward Saturn orbit  Cassini will shoot through a gap in Saturn's rings on Wednesday night and become the first spacecraft ever to orbit the giant planet about 930 million miles away from Earth. 'Everything appears to be right on track,' said Robert Mitchell, Cassini program manager, at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. Cassini has spent seven years making a 2.2 billion-mile journey to study Saturn's atmosphere, magnetic field and weather."  Isn't today June 30th?  Isn't something supposed to happen in Iraq today?  And this is the headline on CNN.com?  Does anyone else notice something is wrong?  WE ARE SUPPOSED TO HAND OVER POWER TO THE IRAQI PEOPLE TODAY.  Not that the average american cares, it doesn't have to do with their stock portfolio, or the price of gasoline, or how good life in the US is.  I'm watching CNN Headline News now, and one of the stories in the first half hour--the time deddicated to real news that affects the world and the country--is SPORTS.  Sports matters SO much more than world news.  The latest football scores are more important than the Lacy Peterson trial.  Typical American...  Knowing all the stats of the 1985 Super Bowl than how to do basic algebra.  Wonder why we're so behind in the technological world?

      Myst last couple of posts have been responses to news and the like (genetic super baby isn't quite news, but eh..) and I think that's how I'm going to update most thigns.  My life is pretty damn boring, but I love the news and satire, so I think that I'm going to just keep doing that..."reflect" on the news.  If something interesting happens to me though, I'll post it in here.  Like today, Don and I went to Presq Isle and went wandering around at black rocks.  It was a hell of a lot of fun.  We discovered this pretty neat vertical shaft, that's just cut in the cliff.  We were looking in this part of the rock that was a crack, and it looked like it opened up in the back, and we could see light.  So we climbed to the top and looked down, it was really cool.  It's really neat how formations like that are created in cliffs.  I'll post pictures once I take some.

       urlLink Slashdot: News for nerds, stuff that matters : "Saeed al-Sahaf writes 'From Fox News/AP, the Supreme Court has ruled that the COPA (Child Online Protection Act), passed in 1998 ostensibly to shield kids from Web porn, is probably an unconstitutional muzzle on free speech. This is not quite like 'striking the law down' because the court simply said a lower court was correct to block the law from taking effect, since it likely violates the First Amendment, and sent the law back to a lower court for trial. The American Civil Liberties Union and other critics of the antipornography law said that it would restrict far too much material that adults may legally see and buy, the court said.'"   I mean COME ON.  Pass the damn .sex extention already.  I don't understand why a lot of people want it changed to 'protect today's youth' but a few interent router owners don't think that it's necessary, and that it would disrupt interenet traffic everywhere.  I think that they don't want to update their browsers.  Oh, and they're money hungry bastards.

       urlLink XTC LYRICS - Dear God : " XTC LYRICS  'Dear God'  , hope you got the letter, and... I pray you can make it better down here. I don't mean a big reduction in the price of beer but all the people that you made in your image, see them starving on their feet 'cause they don't get enough to eat from God, I can't believe in you  Dear God, sorry to disturb you, but... I feel that I should be heard loud and clear. We all need a big reduction in amount of tears and all the people that you made in your image, see them fighting in the street 'cause they can't make opinions meet about God, I can't believe in you  Did you make disease, and the diamond blue? Did you make mankind after we made you? And the devil too!  , don't know if you noticed, but... your name is on a lot of quotes in this book, and us crazy humans wrote it, you should take a look, and all the people that you made in your image still believing that junk is true. Well I know it ain't, and so do you, dear God, I can't believe in I don't believe in  I won't believe in heaven and hell. No saints, no sinners, no devil as well. No pearly gates, no thorny crown. You're always letting us humans down. The wars you bring, the babes you drown. Those lost at sea and never found, and it's the same the whole world 'round. The hurt I see helps to compound that Father, Son and Holy Ghost is just somebody's unholy hoax, and if you're up there you'd perceive that my heart's here upon my sleeve. If there's one thing I don't believe in  it's you...."    That's a good song.  From the title it seems like a bible beating song, but if you read the lyrics, you find that it's about a man who has lost faith (kinda like myself) and realises that if there were a God who loves and cherishes all of humanity, that there wouldn't be any wars or disease or murder or hate.  Or wars about God.

      Oh man, just got done with 5 hours of iSketch.  What an addictive game!  iSketch is this really cool game that you play online, it's like online pictonary.  I'm not really sure why it's so fun, it just it.  I mean...playing for 5 hours is insane.  Chad was pissing me off while playing it though, he had the "I rock at everything" additute that I hate.  Not just in him, but anyone.  When people think that they're the best...  It amazes me how many people still use IE.  Even though most people are told OVER and OVER and OVER that IE has security holes, people still don't switch to something with a little better security.  It's almost as bad as how easily people fall into social engineering attacks.  They just want to trust and don't think to question if what Bill Gates was shoving down their throats about how good Windows is, to actually think for a moment that Microsoft is nothing but a bunch of greedy bastards.  Fuck them.   and fuck the RIAA while you're at it.

      I wonder why Kehra is mad at GS...  I really wish people wern't fighting in CC, it just takes all the fun out of it.  I go there to get away from it and be with people who don't care what you look like or think, they like you for being yourself and chatting as you really are.  That's the CC that I first came to, and that's the CC that I hope to always go to.  I know that change is unavoiable, but I wish that the changes were for the good, not for the worse.  The Myst fan base has always been friendly, ans supportive of one another.  That's why I like it.  Unlike other fan bases, Myst people are friendly, and everyone want's to help one another.  There's none of that "HAHA you suck, I beat Uru first!" stuff, no one is a sore loser or a bigot winner.  Mom went in with Joyce agian tonight, Joyce got a call that John probally won't make it through the night.  That's really sad, I wish that there was a chance for him to get better, but this is pretty much the end.  I'm wondering how Joyce and her family will afford all this, she works at the Thunder Bay Inn still, she can't be making all that much.  I really wish there was something that I could do to help, but I don't have an income of my own.

      Ok, seriously.  What the fuck is so awesome about Counter-Strike?  I'm at a LAN party, and it's all we've been playing for the past few hours.  Sure, CS was fun 5 or so years ago when it came out, but there's sooo much better online multiplayer shooters out now!  Unreal Tournament 2004 or whatever.  I'v read nothing but good things about it.  Or Halo for the PC.  The online multiplayer is just plain awesome.  But, all anyone want's to play is: Counter-Strike.  Oh, and don't even think about telling someone that CS is boring now, because they'll get all offended and mad and challenge you even though you know all they do is sit in their parent's basement playing CS.  Or telling them that 'all we ever play here is counter-strike' because that will usually get the response of 'No we don't, we play other games.'  Sure, granted that other games  are  played here, but, for the most part, guess what game is played.   Counter-Strike.   I think people need to play some of the other, better, slightly newer shooters out there.  It's really  boring playing aginst three or four people who do nothing but play this game.  All the other people here (except Max, go Max!*) are playing CS, and either getting pissed because they died once, or yelling and laughing much too loudly because they killed someone.  Let's play some Battlefield 1942 or something!  REALLY people, get out and play some better online shooters.  -Tom, not playing CS.  *Max is playing Diablo II, an awesome game.

      Life is boring, really.  In today's world, all of us are forced to conform all through school, that we usually end up getting rushed into college (or the military) and jobs that we really aren't ready for yet.  We are told to "Sit down and shut up, we're learning about WWII agian" all through school that we forget what really makes us individual: asking questions.  Sure, we can ask questions like, "Who was the man at Stalingrad?"  But if we ask the important questions like, "Did the man at Stalingrad enjoy looking at rainbows?" we are told to stop asking such silly questions, that we are more adult than that.  But the thing is, if the important questions are drilled out of us so soon, are not each and every one of us the same?  Every time we are told to be quiet, a small part of us dies.  Never stop asking the important question:  "Do you know what it feels like to be happy?"

      Sometimes I wonder if it would be easier to lose my virginity if I were female.  Think about it: males are always thinking of sex, and who gives it to them?  Female's.  If I were a girl it wouold be much easier to lose 'it' before I ship out.  Although I could try that approach, "I'm leaving for the Navy soon, want to help  me finish something before I leave?"  I just hope I'm not that one guy who's never fucked before.  I just realised how sexist and perverted this sounds.  Oh well, if you're offended, go have sex and, trust me, from what I've heard, you'll forget all about it.

       urlLink Slashdot: News for nerds, stuff that matters : "Dept. of Homeland Security Says to Stop Using IE Internet Explorer Posted by CowboyNeal on Friday July 02, @11:51AM from the warning-is-years-late-in-coming dept. LWATCDR writes 'I have been saying this for a long time but now it is offical. From Yahoo News: 'The Department of Homeland Security's U.S. Computer Emergency Readiness Team touched off a storm this week when it recommended for security reasons using browsers other than Microsoft's Internet Explorer.'' In related news, rocketjam writes 'According to Wired, the widespread Internet Explorer security exploit last week and CERT's subsequent recommendation that IE users should consider switching to another browser has resulted in a large spike in downloads of the Mozilla Organization's Mozilla and Firefox web browsers.'"  Finally, someone other than a few 'grassroots' users are saying that IE sucks!  To top that all off it's the "Department of Homeland Security" saying everyone should switch.  I'm just waiting for badges that say "Best Viewed in FireFox" to come along.  It's kind of a long hope, but it's there.  Everyone, PLEASE switch to Mozilla or FireFox.   urlLink Mozilla dot Org

       urlLink Slashdot: News for nerds, stuff that matters : "Auto Manufacturers Running Out Of Unique IDs Technology/IT Posted by timothy on Thursday July 01, @04:27PM from the hence-the-stupid-car-names dept. wakebrdr writes 'Y2K all over again? A story in today's Detroit News explains how the vehicle ID numbering system (VIN) will soon run out of unique numbers. According to the article, a member of the Society of Automotive Engineers says, 'Longer codes would require a major overhaul of computer systems that would dwarf the challenges and expenses spawned by the Y2K computer dilemma.' Golly, if it's that serious maybe I should start stocking up on MREs and ammunition in preparation for the day the assembly lines come to a screeching halt.'"   Everything is finite, and I guess it's finally showing.  Maybe if there's no more numbers, they'll stop making new SUV's which no one needs!  That's a fat chance, but I can hope.  I think that we can use this to our advantage, comparing the finite number if VIN's to the finite amount of oil avaliable.  I'm guessing that by...I'll say 2016 for good measure, that the earth will be out of oil, unless we do some SERIOUS rethinking on how we use it.  Think of it: a LOT of people today drive SUV's, which most of them don't need.  Almost everything you use has plastics in it.  You're probally reading this on a monitor encased in plastic, using a mouse made of plastics for navigation, and plinking away on a keyboard made of: you guessed it!  Plastic!  The basic structure for plastic comes from oil, so that means that you better go easy on that keyboard!  You never know when you can't afford a cheap one anymore!

      Well, my first online campaign that I'll be DMing is about to come underway.  Jordy picked a Human Sorcerer for his race/class, GermanShepherd is still undecided as to wether or not he want's to play, I still need one more person, and I'm counting on Chad to play because we'd need a fourth.  It's gonna be odd playing on nothing but chatroom's and AOL Instant Messenger, but I'll have everyone use their webcam so we can at least see one another.  That and to confirm dice-rolls.  Not that anyone would cheat, I'd just think it'd be more like playing around the kitchen table..heh...  I'm hoping all goes well, as if it does, it will be super fun..

      Well, that's it, I've finally figured out why blog's are fun.  They just are.  I used to have the thought of "why have a blog?  It's just internet clutter" but I think I'v gotten over that.  Or I'm a hypocrit.  I d'no.  Yep.  So I registered this 'log a .tk name.  http://www.thphox.tk/  So you can now type that in for all your needs.

      Well, it's finally hit me.  I'll be 18 in just 10 days.  Does this really look like someone who's about to turn 18?       I'm kinda excited, I'll be able to buy pr0n for the first time witout a fake ID, but I hope I don't turn out to be that one creepy old guy...  Anyways, I'll still need a fake ID to get Mega-Pr0n, but hey..what can ya do.  I think I'll order something from an infomerial also.  More than likely, the first and last time I will in my lifetime...something to do.  I'll finally be able to call Miss Cleo, oh wait, she was shut down (dammit!) so scratch that idea.  Maybe I'll go somewhere and stay in a hotel room, or go to Canada, or...I have no idea...  If anyone has ANY ideas about what to do on my 18th birthday, I'll do them.  But, please, make them be something I have to do once I'm 18.  If you're lucky I'll even post some pictures...if you know what I mean...  Ok, since the title of this post is "Thoughts about my birthday and something about a Snaffel" I suppose I should say something about a Snaffel.  Hey, if you drink snapple, and don't really care to participate in the 'Snaffel', then, PLEASE SEND ME CAPS!!  I would, simply put, LOVE to have something that has the snapple logo on it!  I'll re-imburse you somehow for postage, I have a Gmail account, so maybe I'll give out some invites, or I'll mail you a little piece of beach glass from the shores of Lake Superior!  Just send me caps!  Please?  Wait..what did I mean...?

      Well, I just changed the name of my blog from "Sounds Like Pepper" to "The Mind of a Dungeon Master" so I think I should actually start posting some things about my D&D games.  Haven't done a game in a while, so there isn't much D&D stuff to say.  Other than I got my t-shirt last monday, so I'm pretty happy about that.  It's super geeky, it's a reprint of the 1987 internation convention logo, red on a yellow shirt.  I love it..  Family Guy is on, and I'v never seen this eipsode.  Peter is trying to teach Chris about his history, it's super fun.  "Holy crap!  I'm black!" - Peter

The one directly above this one (or below if...yeah......) is a comparison of the tune "Magical Trevor" from weebls-stuff, http://www.weebls-stuff.com/, and the one and only Ran singing his...'adaptation'  Listen closely, and put away that damn Mad mag!
