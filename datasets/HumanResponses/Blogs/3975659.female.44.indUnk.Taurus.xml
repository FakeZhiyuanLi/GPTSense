      So, I met someone interesting on an edating site. Just my luck, the guy turned out to be a psychologist who&nbsp;specializes in couples counseling. The irony of it! He is also the author of not one, but two books on love, and achieving successful romantic relationships.&nbsp; Let me just say that, at first I thought this is what God had in store for me after a bitter divorce and eleven years of dating, thank you Lord!&nbsp; I thought: this is what it's gonna take to turn this old stubborn girl around.&nbsp; We met, and he was nice to look at.&nbsp; Not drop-dead gorgeous by any stretch of the imagination, but nice looking in a granola-crunch kind of way.&nbsp;&nbsp; We seemed to hit it off, and to my surprise, the conversation was mostly lively, even if it was punctuated with a few uncomfortable silences here and there, which immediately prompted him to jump into couselor mode,&nbsp;and ask those&nbsp;seemingly harmless&nbsp;questions that are&nbsp;carefully&nbsp;designed to provide insight into the depth of my very soul.&nbsp; Ahhh, not playing that game, I thought, and gave him my best trick answers!&nbsp; We met twice, first for coffee (always good for a quick escape) and then for dinner at a carefully selected Mexican restaurant.&nbsp; How considerate, I thought, when he suggested we try a restaurant&nbsp;in my part of town-- he's nice to think of all the hours I must spend driving back and forth to work, about 50 miles a day.&nbsp; Lest I hold that impression for too long, things took a turn for the worse, when, after a nice meal, he pulled out a discount coupon (carefully cut out of the local paper) and handed it to the waitress, right before my eyes.&nbsp; I realized in an instant I was&nbsp;a "two-meals for the price of one"&nbsp;kind of deal.&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't know why, but my thoughts turned to his cats.&nbsp;&nbsp; Those poor cats.&nbsp; Beware of a man that has lived alone for ten years and constantly talks about his cats.&nbsp; This&nbsp;person's desire to connect romantically with another human being was limited&nbsp;by his inability to move beyond&nbsp;a particular&nbsp;repertoire of possibilities.&nbsp;&nbsp;How is it such a&nbsp;small&nbsp;symbolic gesture could&nbsp;make me feel at once absent and negated?&nbsp; My dissapointment must have shown, for when we parted ways, he left in a haste.&nbsp;&nbsp;He gave me a&nbsp;perfunctory hug outside the restaurant (I couldn't help but notice how uncomfortable to the touch it felt), and he briskly walked away towards his car. I was left standing in the parking lot, more than a few feet away from my car, watching him walk away.&nbsp; It reminded me of a movie scene, the one where she then&nbsp;turns around slowly and walks to her car,&nbsp; puts the key in the ignition, and drives away into the comfort of absolute darkness.

      Another blank page... A friend told me the best way to overcome writer's block was just to start writing. Stream of consciousness-style.&nbsp; It doesn't have to make sense, it just IS.&nbsp; I've been staring at a blank screen for days now, wondering what I will write.&nbsp; Nothing makes sense, nothing comes out right.&nbsp; Could I be paralized by fear?&nbsp; Why wouldn't I be able to do this? I've always risen to the challenge and now I feel like I am on the brink of collapse! I like to think I am the one that comes to aid others, the rescuer, or at the very least, the provider of sometimes sage advice, and a kind word or two.&nbsp; But I am utterly unable to treat myself in the same way.&nbsp; Why do I put myself in this situation?&nbsp; It is completely by choice!&nbsp; I could go about quietly, staying put, not making waves, choosing to step just slightly outside of the lines, wanting to color in full bloom, when I could have wandered slowly in between the blue-gray aisles, watching my toes, so as not to stub them in an unclaculated move.&nbsp; Ugh.&nbsp; My stomach reminds me I am on a deadline. I WILL produce, and I will make it worth the wait.
