      I have been having a fun time helping out with planning Carmen and Chris' wedding. They are going to get married in Vegas! I'm so stoked about it. When they first mentioned this to me I had visions of Carmen in a sequinned bustier dress, Chris in a powder blue tux, and an Elvis look-alike blessing the union! Far, far from that!    They are getting married at the Venetian Hotel and it will be absolutely lovely. Tres chic infact with a bit of out of the ordinary flair added.    Instead of your usual boring paper announcments, they are sending out minature quarter bottles of champagne to the guests. What better way to invite to a celebration than with a bottle of bubbly? Below is a sample of the "mock-up" with the already approved label.     I took the picture and designed the layout. The orchid is one that resides in a window above C&C's toilet in their home! Absolutely stunning picture if I do say so myself! Then I spent countless man hours on the perfect layout and verbage, printed them all up on nifty ink-jet static cling plastic (like for window decals), and voila! It seems that C&amp;C had their own special sparkling wine bottled just for the occassion!    I'll post the finished product as soon as we decide on how to dress the bottle. I kept poor Carmen up way past her bedtime to show her my idea on how to present the bottle. I'll have to search for a clever way to mail these too. This is so fun! Maybe I should send one to Martha. Afterall, she may want a tasty libation while she's doing her time in the slammer!    This is truly a good thing!       urlLink      Carmen and Chris' Wedding Announcement       urlLink       Sample "Dressed" Bottle
