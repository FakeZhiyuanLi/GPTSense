        Though Fox Molder of the X-Files is such a hottie in my book...his "Trust No One" logo is not good relationship advice. I know, I know..."What did that have to do with relationships to begin with, Mom? " Well, hell...I'm still a woman and he's one fine man, besides I did have a point! The "Keys to a  GOOD  relationship" are: Love, Communication, and Trust. Don't worry, by the time you're my age you'll have no problem remembering those three. In my case I never learned to trust. I lived by the "trust no one" logic, not because I thought the government was really hiding secrets about life on other planets mind you. I was never given the opportunity to learn to trust. It was just the little things. Things that I'm sure you will take for granted and I'm glad for that. If all I can give you is the chance to grow and know you can trust your Mom, then I have reached my goal. In order to trust someone you have to be able to trust yourself. Well, in my case I had to learn not to trust my parents. I couldn't depend on them to get me to school on time, even though my private school didn't have a bus rout...parents had to drop off their kids. They would frequently forget to pick me up and the pressure on me by the school and Church people made me hate myself. I started to loose trust in myself because of this. Like it was somehow my fault. A child cannot be blamed for their parents faults! Don't you ever let anyone tell you otherwise. I tried to talk with my youth director about these things, only to hear that I needed to just talk with my parents more. They didn't hear me. I was alone and reaching out the best way I knew how for help only to be patronized. My parents at that time didn't want to hear me...they would've just rather forgot my existence(This is just one reason why people shouldn't stay together for the sake of the kids...but that's a whole other post). So it  shouldn't  have been a surprise when I moved out on my own at 18. I don't ever want that for you, baby girl. The world is a hard place, especially for young women. I am not perfect, but I promise to be the best mother I know how to be. I will prove myself trustworthy! Don't be afraid to trust people and don't let it destroy your world when you're let down. Trust yourself! Know who you are and what you are capable of. Only then will you be able to trust someone in the intimacy of a relationship.

        Baby girl,  Get yourself a man whom you can laugh with, can dance with. Someone who will sing right along with you in the car no matter how horrible the both of you do or don't sound. Find yourself a man who can deal with your sense of self and your independent ways. DO NOT CHANGE for  any  man. Though you might think that's what  he  wants, he will loose his respect for you if you conform...and if he doesn't then red-flags should go up, because that won't be the last change he has you make. Remember, every woman should watch  Sleeping With The Enemy  at least 20x's in their life. It's a must! Finally, find yourself a man who can talk to you while you're pooping and laugh with you when you fart. For that my dear, is the secret to a long relationship...Can you feel free to fart on your man or not?

      Last night as I sit studying and then reading my new book as a reward for patronage, I couldn’t keep my mind from drifting.  I love my husband and my children more than any language could ever hope to express.  My thoughts were disturbing to me.   I found myself pondering the “whys” and the “sighs” that my life has so recently been filled with.  True that happily ever after is hard damned work, but sometimes I wish things were simpler.  Between the late hours studying and waiting for my husband to get home from work…to the long days of school and child rearing, I have no time for the things I love.  I have found that rewarding myself with a good book after a long studying session makes studying not to horrid, but…just…but. It’s hard to put my finger on the exact words, for it’s more of a feeling.  A horrible tearing, really, right around my breast.  No…I’m not having a heart attack, more of a heart ache.   Have you ever felt under appreciated?  I know if there are any other mom’s reading this, then, yes.  The only consoling I get is as I’m floating off to the land of nod.  Don’t get me wrong, I am truly grateful for the tenderness of it.  I just feel wounded.  That’s it!  Wounded.  For all of my trying and all of my hard work, I don’t feel as if it matters to the ones that I wish it too.  (Sigh.) Now the question is: How do you heal a wound such as this?

      The Rogue and I just about have the back yard demolished...It will be finished my this night.  It has to, we set up our one free giant trash haul for tomorrow.  They told us it would be picked up anytime between 6am and 6pm tomorrow.  My poor old man, nearly killed himself with all the work I've had him do.  It's my duty as a wife and a good woman to be his slave driver...I think.  At least that's what I'm hoping the judge said.  LOL...That's my side of the story anyway.   I just wanted to thank every body for their input in my little debate.  Everyone seems to have some very valid arguments and I will have to keep them in mind.  It's just good to know that we are all thinking about these things, at any rate.   Well, I have some research I have to do for another debate in that class.  I will present some of the ideas I got from everyone to my group for that debate.  In a sense we are playing "devil's advocate"...In that we are drawing names to decide which side of the argument we are on.  I don't want to keep re-iterating it, but I think it's good to sometimes look at something from the other person's point of view.  It makes us...Well rounded.

      I thought, I would get the ball rolling for this weekend by posing a question and hopefully get some feed back.  In my grandmother's time, good and bad were as plain as black and white.  Now-a-days though, many people would argue that there are various shades of gray and the whole black/white, good/evil criteria is no longer in effect.  I, being who I am, disagree and still believe as my grandmother does.  There should be no in between.  But, obviously, just because one person believes something doesn't make it right...But just because we don't believe in something doesn't mean it isn't real.   So then, who wants to take a crack at this?  I would like to remind you all that this is just a friendly debate, so no haters, please.  I believe we are all civilized enough to post our opinions without tearing down someone else.

      Do you ever wonder about the things that we think?  I found myself wondering about them just last night and this morning between classes.  Personally, I live in a different world than other people.  Call it an alter ego, if you will, but I fantasize about immortality and fighting vampires, wizards and elves, and faeries and kings.  If I were to be anything but human, I couldn’t tell you what I would choose.  A combination?  Yes! There is another creature that has been lost to us over the ages due to lack of knowledge.  There is another race that was above all the others and yet similar.  They are what Legends were all about.   Prologue 	The sun was just beginning to set over the amber soil of the red man’s state and creatures were stirring to life.  Creatures that lived for the twilight hours.  Creatures of the night.  Bats, wolves, owls, and other beasts woke in search of prey.  Mother Nature’s balance was once more being up held.  This was Ardra’s favorite time of the day… or night as it was.  It is true that she also loved the sun risings, but sunset had a magic all of its own.  The sheer beauty of it alone would make one forget about the dangers that lurked behind every corner once the sun’s last bit of energy was robbed from the soil.  Dangers that Ardra knew all too well.  Dangers that she had to confront constantly, as is her duty. 	She knew she should be making preparations for the up coming counsel, but over the centuries Ardra has learned you have to stop and smell the roses.  Most of the preparations were already done.  Damia had seen to that.  There was no better friend than Damiana.  Ardra smiled, there would never be anyway to completely thank her close companion.  She’s the only person living in a solid form who knew her for everything she was.  With a heavy sigh, Ardra stood from her porch swing and looked around.  The sun was now set and preparations or not, there was still much to do.  It was her responsibility to summon the heads of counsel for their tri-century court.  Many things had been brought to her attention, many things that required an iron hand and an unbreakable courage.  She closed her eyes and the smile was gone.  Another war loomed in the distance.  After so many lifetimes it was still quite a burden.  A burden only she could bare.  Alone.      	Druce awoke when the last of the sun’s great power was gone.  True that he could have risen before it fell, but it left him drained.  And he had not been successful in his agenda for the previous night nor had he fed properly.  He walked out of the broken down house all the while undoing his safe guards.  Before he took that first step outside of the house he sought outside himself to check the immediate area for danger.  Once he was sure that nothing was out of the ordinary he went in search of prey.  This would be an unlucky night for some poor, unfortunate human.  Hunger beat at his very soul.  If he even still had a soul, he dared not to think on it.  Druce was too tired to even soar across the country side.  Deciding to conserve energy by walking so as to not loose control and allow his blood lust to devour the first passer by.   	It had become so hard to exist the last few hundred years.  The pact that his people had made with the Legends was very strict and moral.  After centuries he felt himself being drawn away from that path, but…anything for Ardra.  The vampire Kingdom would never have bowed to another.  It bowed for Ardra.  He bowed for Ardra.  If he truly could feel it was because of her.  She breathed life back into this bleak shell of an undead King.  It was through her that all the immortals were kept in line.  There had never been anyone else capable of such a thing.  In his mind’s eye she was on a pedestal of admiration.  He was nothing to her though and he never would be.  Druce did a mental shake, he was on the counsel and the pact truly made life better for his people.  That was what a King was there for, wasn’t it?  To make his people happy?  Was it fair that he could not be happy also, with them?  He forced air in and out of his lungs and with a heavy heart he started walking again.  Anything for Ardra.  Anything.   	The lights of homes and businesses alike glittered in the distance and the scent of warm blood filled his deadly senses.  He was very near the city now and hoped to find several beggars out tonight.  He must still honor the pact, even though the demon within was screaming for sustenance, begging him to slake his eternal thirst.  The nights of innocent victims were gone and it wasn’t that Druce missed those days.  In fact, it was a relief to his conscience.  Those were the days with horrible guilt and the remembrance that his humanity was teetering on the edge of extinction.  Druce still couldn’t be certain that his humanity hadn’t already shriveled to dust many centuries ago.  He couldn’t discount that his new found feelings weren’t simply a renewed hope for his people.  Either way he was their King and he would do whatever was necessary to ensure the continuance of their race.  Was it even a good idea to allow his race to continue on?  This was not the time for him to second guess himself.  The tri-century court was nearing and there was much to do.  Some of his people had denied the pact from the beginning and were now planning a revolution.  More to the point, Druce feared the revolution was already underway.   	He strolled through several allies, not bothering to conceal himself.  Then he came upon three drunken vagrants and once more was filled with a since of hope.  The pact would not be broken this night by him and no innocent would come to an early grave.  Three vagrants would allow him to sate his appetite fully and keep the good citizens free from hell’s doors.  Come the day of the counsel he would be able to hold his head up high and meet Ardra’s intense glaze with complete confidence.  Well, almost complete confidence.  It will be his fault that his people have strayed from the pact.  Druce accepted that and whatever chastisement that he would receive from Ardra.  Just to be near her would be enough.  The years spent apart from her counsel were always dark and empty.  Druce was dark and empty.  Alone.

      Hmmm…I’m not really sure I should even be posting this, but it’s what I do.  I like to visit the blog sites and read them.  I get bored late in the night waiting for my old man to come home.  I do not comment on every site, but when I do I don’t always know exactly how to respond.  Therefore I leave a poem.  What’s the big deal, if you didn’t want people to comment on you blog, then you can make it so that they cannot.   Another point I’d like to make is, I like…no…I love a good argument.  So by coming here and leaving me some kind of stupid comment, I have to say, “I’m a little disappointed, young lady!”  (It has to be a girl, because the comments are too juvenile to have come from a man)  The internet is a funny thing, isn’t it?  We get the feeling of empowerment, by not having to use our real name.  Be an adult and at least leave a name and if you want an argument, that’s cool.  I find they make life more interesting.  I don’t expect everyone to agree with me as I don’t agree with everyone either.  So just to make my point, you can no longer leave anonymous comments on my site.  Oh, and for the record, not all vampires have to hide from sun light.  I don’t dress up as one or pretend I’m one.  Though I may be a little crazy, I ask you…who isn’t?  However, I do like to dress up as one on Halloween and scare the beeheebees out of people like you, LOL!

      First off I’d like to say wish every man a Happy Father’s Day…may it be lazy and fun.  I thought I’d a few questions and I’ll try not to be too long winded.  My name is Devona…it’s just like Devon with an “uh” sound at the end.  I am a 25yr old Libran female, if you’re into astrology; I am a Libra III with Aries rising.  Also, note that I am of Scottish descent.  The Rose clan to be precise.  Their motto: constant and true is a good analogy of my personality.  So it’s no surprise that I love all things Scottish and Celtic.  I also love vampires.  There is just something so seductive about their dark, sexual energy.  It oozes from their glowing eyes and dripping fangs, along with a little fear of the unknown.  But really that’s what is to tempting about them isn’t it?  We’re not supposed to be attracted to something that scares us and tempts us in such an evil light.   Well, to keep from wandering from the point, I was researching all the different types of vampires one evening and came across the boabhan sith.  It was the best of both worlds, a Scottish female vampire.  If anyone is interested I have a link in the title bar of one of my previous posts, “What is a boabhan sith?”  It gives a little short history about the little that is known about these creatures.  Please feel free to leave a comment and I’ll try my hand at some more research at the college some time this week between classes.   Again, thanks to everyone who has stopped by and please leave me a comment.  I just love interaction.  If you do leave a comment, I’ll ask you to leave an address to your site or blog and I’ll check them out.

      I find myself posting a lot of my favorite authors this morning.  Maybe it’s the rain that puts me in this mood.  The dark sky makes me think about all the scary movies I watched when I was younger…Dracula and Noferatu.  I have mentioned two wonderful authors already…Christine Feehan and Maggie Shayne, but I didn’t mention my first bite of the proverbial vampire books.  My mother-in-law, who is always sending books my way, lent me When Darkness Falls by Shannon Drake.  It was the first romance I have ever read all the way through.  Why you ask?  Well, it was about a Scottish vampire…two of my favorite things.  I’ve read all of her vampire series so far and thought others would enjoy too.  I’ve got a link to her site as well in the title bar.  I will try to make it a habit if my favorite authors have a web page to post their link when I write something wonderful about their books.  By the way, if any one has read any of the three authors’ series, leave me a comment on how you like then or didn’t.

      I just recently finished another book.  And, who’d have guessed it was a vampire book?  He he he…I fell in love with the smart-assed loner of a vampire who was the main character.  It took me about a page to get into the book but it was worth it.  The rest of the book kept me wondering what was going on…what did Amber’s dream mean?  I had to continue to find out and I couldn’t put it down.  The unfortunate thing was that I started, yet another series backwards.  A dear and close friend, my mother-in-law lent me this book that she just bought and I read it with in the week.  The title of this post is linked to the author’s web page.  I will, however, mention that some may not like the entire context of the site.  I will just link it to the vampire book area, because I don’t agree with some of its contexts either.  Please forgive, I didn’t write the site, but it’s worth checking out because of the books.

      Maybe, it was the fact that it was after three in the morning that made my deck play so badly.  We’d just finished tweaking it.  I have this unblock- able wizard deck but it wasn’t mean enough.  It played fast enough, but I didn’t have anything to bump up my wizards or help me gain life.  Well, we added some more artifacts and creature enchantments, hoping to make my unblock-able wizards even more evil.  In the end…rogue wit’s sun burst deck kicked mine and bill dog’s assess.  That totally stink!  I’m going to have to go back to my elfish rage deck and just kill them with my huge trample elves.  Maybe tonight my wizards will come through for me.  I’m hoping that Rogue wit just got a really good draw.  I’ll find out at our friendly tournament tonight and let ya know.

       I woke to the sounds of thunder, crashing with a hellish force.  Startled, I sat up in bed, only to realize that it was after 9am!  Thinking that maybe the clock was messed up because of the storm, I traipse to the window expecting to see the night sky.  To my surprise, or maybe not such a surprise, it was daylight, but storm weather daylight.  I peered out the window into the dark and foreboding skies.  This is Oklahoma and we’re still in tornado season.  Hmmm…come to think of it we’ve only had one or two good tornadoes so far.  Not good, but what the hell!  I love storms…they seep sexual energy and excitement.  Too bad my old man was sawing logs…would’ve like to ravish him in the rain.  LOL

      I would just like to respond to the person who chose to remain anonymous that posted a comment.  I stopped by and checked out your blog...out of courtesy, I thought I'd leave a piece of myself behind.  I am after all a poet.  I don't recall leaving any type of spam...I left my blog site,   thinking   that you might return the favor.  I'm sorry you're so stuck up that you can't differentiate between the two.  Tisk, tisk...what kind of world are we coming to when people forget their manners?

      The boabhan sith pronounced:  bo(long O)-vun she The boabhan sith is a Scottish vampire.  Some say that they used to be elves and are now cursed.  Actually, there isn't that much that's known about them except for the basic tale.  Which you can read by clicking on this entry's title.

      If you're into good vampire stories then I've got a wonderful author for you.  Christine Feehan and her Dark Series.  I'm anxiously awaiting her lasted in the series.  All of them had me on the edge of my seat and reading every where I went.  I just couldn't put them down.  Even when I did put them down, I found myself fantasizing about the main characters in most of the books.

      The wind did blow  In the house of death As his head was cradled to me  The final blow As I took his breath His essence like sweetened tea  I hung my head And wept in despair For the life he now must lead  He’s now undead I just sit and stare At this life that I’ve just bled

      Some times...I just hate the world wide web.  I need to get started on my son's and daughter's halloween costumes if I'm going to have them done by October.  My little girl really wants to be a mermaid.  The only patterns I can find for them are either really ugly or hoochi-mamma-style, and I can't do that to my daughter...not to mention I would have no idea how to down-scale the pattern.  So I'm asking...Does anyone have any easy ideas for a pretty mermaid costume that's suitable for a little girl?

       Harvest time is coming  I  feel  it in the air  Though it is not close enough  &nbsp;I see it sitting there  And feel its breath  Upon me, as I stare at Heavens bliss  I sit and wait, not silently  My voice echoing in the mist  Neal down on her blanket  Set your voice adrift  Fall will hear you calling  Her entry with leaves-a-falling  And you shall hear me calling  My voice echoing in the mist   It’s been raining here for days now.&nbsp; I suppose that is what has me in such a good mood.&nbsp; It’s like my skin, my energy, my very soul stirs with electricity as each drop of rain falls from the sky.&nbsp; Rain is a very moody weather.&nbsp; Most find it dark and depressing, but that is because they don’t know my secrets.&nbsp; The rain’s secrets.&nbsp; They don’t feel the vibrations in the storms.&nbsp; The music as the wind howls and the soothing caresses as the rain drums on the soft soil.&nbsp; I can almost hear the earth rejoicing as its thirst begins to slake.&nbsp; I can smell autumn in the air!&nbsp; Halloween is coming!&nbsp; My favorite holiday!&nbsp; Now don’t go thinking I’m some sort of Wiccan-witch-devil-worshiper…far from it.&nbsp; Halloween is just a time when adults and children alike can pretend to be someone different.&nbsp; The air is filled with a spookiness that makes us smile…and maybe gives us a good scare.&nbsp; I can smell the pumpkin seeds as my mind conjures up memories from Halloweens long past.&nbsp; I’m so excited.&nbsp; Halloween party at my house…you’re all invited!&nbsp; Just remember costumes are required!&nbsp; I think I’ll be Velma from Scooby Doo this year; my daughter wants to be a mermaid.&nbsp; Does anyone have any idea of what they’re going to be this year?&nbsp; I’d love some ideas as people keep asking us what they should dress up as for this year’s party.&nbsp; Let me know…I’m already starting to decide what new decorations I’ll be getting and putting up.&nbsp; I’ll have to take pictures of the place when it’s finished and post them for everyone to enjoy.&nbsp;  PS…  Thanks to all who wished me luck…I feel I did well on my finals.

        In some one else’s mind I see me  I see me as myself, and Who I’d like to be  And who I used to be Thankful, God is kind Thankful He loves me  My path is getting shorter As I see my goal’s in reach Life is hard to teach A life I’m walking out on, yet It clings on like a leach Two more years of which I speak  Oh and then, what joy will come What a weight shall lift that day When I’ll have time to sing And I’ll have time to play They will surely hear me say Hurray!

      I'm always amazed by the stupidity of some people.&nbsp; Or maybe it is their "brilliant personalities?"&nbsp;  During closing arguments in my debate, a girl from the opposing side stepped up to bat.&nbsp; Well, I have to admire that at least.&nbsp; Few people have what it takes to get up and make an idiot of themselves.&nbsp; I have never heard such a load of bull!&nbsp; She totally misconstrued everything that was said and what was more her arguments were extremely weak.&nbsp;  The topic being debated was the one I mentioned before...the power of the president in foreign policy.&nbsp; She was of course on the "pro" side, who were trying to prove that the president didn't have enough power.&nbsp; We were on the "con" side, who were  proving  that the president had too much power.&nbsp; (LOL...I suppose I am a little biased)&nbsp; We were using the constitution to prove the limitations of the presidents powers and how he abuses them.&nbsp; Bla bla bla, I know you all&nbsp;don't want to hear the boring details.&nbsp;  I'll get to the point.&nbsp; At the end of her horrible argument she said, and I quote, "Now that I have convinced you that Bush needs more power in the foreign affairs  thang ...I know ya'll'll vote for him."&nbsp; (Tee-hee...and some giggles)  Needles to say...I didn't have anything to say after that because I was amazed at what she had just spoke.&nbsp; I just wish I could have tapped the whole thing...I will remind you all that I do live in Oklahoma and yes, some of us do have an accent.&nbsp; Hers was the worst red-neck-hick-ti-fied one I have had the unpleasantness of hearing.&nbsp; It made the entire thing laugh-a-ble.&nbsp;  So I ask...how do you argue with that?  Anyway...back to the books...one more final test tomorrow!&nbsp;&nbsp; Then I'm done for three weeks!

        This is my finals week!&nbsp; I am not going to be posting until probably Thursday, but I will try to post a comment here and there in between now and then.&nbsp; I'm starting tomorrow out with a bang.&nbsp; Debate time...our last debate is 8am tomorrow and I will get my final exam for that class (which is a take home that will be due on Wednesday).&nbsp; I will be taking a lab test either Tuesday or Wednesday and I will have my Anatomy and Physiology II final on Thursday.&nbsp; Amongst all of that I will have one final lab (just a lab not a lab test) and a Quiz in government to get done.&nbsp; Yeah college!&nbsp; (again with the dripping sarcasm I know, sigh)&nbsp;  Wish me luck!

      I was looking at pictures of Strawberry Shortcake and then Barbie and stuff on the web with my daughter...when I came across this horrific characterization of the blonde doll we know and love.&nbsp; Even my daughter said, "It's yucky!"  ...just thought I'd share.

      Why is it that when I have studying to do...there is always something good on television.&nbsp; Yet, when I don't have shit to do they're playing  Leave it to Beaver, Little House on the Prairie,  and  Golf. &nbsp; I mean, come on, we have cable and there isn't anything to see?&nbsp; Most of the day is spent listening to SpongeBob Squarepants and Blue's Clues anyway, but come night time you'd think they'd show more interesting programs.&nbsp; Oh well, I suppose I should be studying anyway.&nbsp; It's just so damn hard to pass up  The Clash of the Titans! &nbsp; Especially since Perseus is so hot!&nbsp; I'm just a sucker for the classics, hehehe.

        Sitting in my class room  Nervousness sits in  The student’s eyes reflect sheer doom  As our professor  waltzes  in  &nbsp;  Are you  ready ?  He asks, to take the test  The air is heavy  As we try our best  &nbsp;  I nod my head  And try to be brave  A review? They said,  Sweating like Hebrew slaves  &nbsp;  The teacher Okays it  While questions we ask  He tries to explain it,  But its test time at last  &nbsp;  Two to the hallway  To expel their lunch  Nothing to say  As our eye brows did bunch  &nbsp;  With ten minutes left  We can now use our notes   My  notes I had left  At home, that’s no joke  &nbsp;  Were there any A-makers  As our tests we passed in  It’s been dubbed a  window-maker   By some of the men

       Okay, is there anybody who likes  Love At First Bite , with George Hamilton as much as me?&nbsp; I'm sitting here watching it thinking...it's one of the worst movies  ever  made.&nbsp; Yet, I  love  it!&nbsp; It's like looking at a bull dog...it's so ugly it's cute, type of thing.&nbsp; My favorite part is the dance number!&nbsp; I usuall watch most of it, but somewhere around the car chase at the end I end up turning.&nbsp; It's just one of those movies you have to turn to when you see it on.    Man, I'm such a dork, hehehe.&nbsp;

        Wow!&nbsp; I’m just so excited I can hardly stand it!&nbsp; My step-sister is pregnant!&nbsp;  I have been feeling worn down and sick with a head cold for a few days.&nbsp; My class this morning was going to watch a video that wasn’t even going to be tested on…so I missed class and took a benedryl to ease my aching head.&nbsp; I was lying next to my husband thinking about getting up and starting the day, when the phone rings and decides for me.&nbsp; I answer and my step-mom asked how I would like to have a new cousin for the kids to play with.&nbsp; I have to admit, I wasn’t completely awake and it took a minute or two for it to register.&nbsp; My step-sister is going to be a wonderful mother.&nbsp; I know she’s wanted kids for a while.&nbsp; Wow, just wow!&nbsp;       They were calling to get the name of my doctor and that kind of thing.&nbsp; I was and am still in shock.&nbsp; I think it’s ebbing though, because I just can’t quit smiling.&nbsp; My kids have many cousins, but they never get to see them.&nbsp; Mostly because my side of the family can’t stop arguing to get along for five minutes.&nbsp; That and they’re all much older than my kids and aren’t very interested in playing with a 2 and a 4 year old.&nbsp; This is just so wonderful.&nbsp; My step-sister isn’t going to be able to get rid of me now; I’m going to be at her house all the time.&nbsp; And…I fully intend to be doing some baby-sitting for her.&nbsp; Wow!..I’ve got another niece or nephew on the way!&nbsp;  I just can’t wait.&nbsp; She just got married back around St. Patty’s day and they just got a house up here in the same town as me.&nbsp; Headache or not…I am totally pumped.&nbsp;  I wish her well and that God will bless her child and keep them both safe.&nbsp; She’s a wonderful person and I’m very lucky to have her as a sister.&nbsp; God, I can’t wait to go shopping for the baby. &nbsp;

         As the sun quietly sinks behind me  I realize how my life ought to be  And I ponder how it could’ve been  Had I taken the road of things not seen  &nbsp;  Though I think and I wonder  I am not sad I’m a mother  Two babes so dear  Who make it clear  To me, why I’m here  And not another  &nbsp;  Now the struggle makes me cold  For them I still am bold  My precious girl and boy  My precious pride and joy  &nbsp;  I sit back and watch them  Holding close and teaching them  How things ought to be  How much they mean to me  What it means to be free  To know life as a priceless gem  &nbsp;  The beauty in their eyes  My worried mother sighs  Oh, how I love to hold on  To my daughter and my son  I hope one day they’ll know…  For them this all was done

       I was thinking and am a little peeved.&nbsp; The United States of America doesn’t have a national language, like I had previously thought.&nbsp; It hadn’t occurred to me that English wasn’t the national language, but as it turns out we just don’t have a national one.&nbsp; Apparently, “we” don’t want to piss off our neighboring countries by adopting a national language.&nbsp; Yet, our neighboring countries aren’t doing the same.&nbsp; I guess besides the fact that immigrants choose to move here and live here in “our” land and refuse to speak the language here…but if we moved to Germany or France (etc.) we’d have to learn their language.&nbsp; Nobody is worried about offending us.&nbsp; Anyway, my point is…if we aren’t going to adopt a national language, then I think we should quit forcing our schools to teach 12 years of English on our students.&nbsp; Don’t you think?&nbsp; I mean we aren’t teaching Spanish from grade school up, but we have English class as early as pre-school. &nbsp;  Hmm…I was just wondering, anyway.&nbsp; That’s my opinion and I’ll get of my soap box for today.&nbsp;  *smiles*  &nbsp;  P.S.&nbsp;&nbsp;  Don’t get me wrong…I’m not saying that as a nation we shouldn’t learn to speak another language besides English.&nbsp; In fact I think that it would be beneficial for us to do so. &nbsp;I encourage my daughter to speak Spanish, as we watch Dora the Explorer, but I just don’t think that we should have to conform to another country’s ways when it must not have been too good over there in the first place.&nbsp; If it was better there they wouldn’t have come over here.&nbsp; How can we placate them like we do as a country?&nbsp; It’s not beneficial to them either.&nbsp;

       I was looking up pet lizards and how to take care of different types and I came across the blue-tongued skink.&nbsp; I am just going to have to save up for one of these babies.&nbsp; Isn’t he beautiful?&nbsp; God, just love reptiles…and if my husband wasn’t so freaked out by them, I would have a snake.&nbsp; Alas, I won’t push the issue…but he’s got to deal with lizards.&nbsp; I have two annuls…thanks, impart to our friend—pitch4K (or whatever alias he’s using now).&nbsp; I love my annuls, Aillen and Arawn, but they aren’t the kind you pick up and pet.&nbsp; Annuls are small lizards that eat crickets and hide in leaves.&nbsp; Easy to take care of, but they are fast little suckers and easily frightened.&nbsp; Hence, I can’t pet them.&nbsp; I talk to them like an idiot though…the same way I talk with my cat.&nbsp;  So anyway, I can’t even remember how I did it, but I talked my man into letting me get a big lizard.&nbsp; He knows how much I would just love another cat…or dog for that matter, so I can have a big lizard to pet.&nbsp; Yeah!&nbsp; I’m going to have to start looking for names for my soon to be pet.&nbsp; I’ve got the tank and everything, but a water dish ($10) and a light bulb ($8).&nbsp;  So…does anybody know any good lizard names?&nbsp; That is, excluding God Zilla or Reptar.&nbsp;

       Okay...Wednesday at my government class we had a guest speaker.&nbsp; Mr. Something (can’t use his real name), who is an Oklahoma City Police Officer.&nbsp; I was rather surprised at his mannerisms.&nbsp; One of my older brothers is a cop (same area) and he’s nothing like this man was.&nbsp; My brother is very quiet and (for lack of a better description) proper.&nbsp; This man was both funny and serious at the same time.&nbsp;  Let me set the scene.&nbsp; The class room is quiet, like always, and waiting for the teacher to arrive.&nbsp; About 5 minutes before our teacher arrives the officer does.&nbsp; He walks in with all the confidence of a King and sets his hand outs on the table next to his tag-a-long bag.&nbsp; He then proceeds to set this giant BONG on the table and tells us we have just enough time to hit the communal bong before class.&nbsp; Now, I’m totally freaked out and am laughing hysterically.&nbsp; The officer smiles and lifts his hands saying that he was just kidding.&nbsp; He just wanted to make sure that we were all awake.&nbsp; After that, yeah, we were all awake.&nbsp;  Needles to say, I now know how to keep from getting a DUI and know way too much about my rights as a citizen.&nbsp; Who’d have thought that police officers could have so much personality?

      I was wondering today.  Pondering over a dream.  Feeling a bit more myself today.   I dreamed that I was somewhere deep in a forest.  A forest too beautiful to exist, with bubbling brooks and sparkling streams.  I believe there was a small cascading fall near one of the ponds.  Magical.   Mystical .  I felt as if maybe I walked with the faeries, yet I saw no other around.   It was a strange dream.  I swear I could feel the thick moss on the bottom of my feet, like moist fleece socks.  The wind felt cool on my face and in my hair.  I was myself, but not.   Sometimes I was looking at myself through my minds eye…I speculate.  Other times, most of the time, I was seeing through myself.  First person.   I walked.  Following trails and some sense of where I needed to go, I went.  From time to time I paused to touch something: a smooth rock, the cool water, a velvet petal.  My dream was so rich in sensations.  I knew when I was where I needed to be.  For I just stayed and breathed.  And I breathed deeply.  That was all.   I woke up wrapped in my husbands arms…safe and warm…loved.  I lay there in bed for quite sometime before I found the strength to start the day.  And I found the strength in his arms.  I could breathe deeply in his arms.   Dreams are funny things.  I very rarely remember one with so much detail.  I recall only 3 other times in my life when I did.  Even then they were more nightmares than a  dream .  I can’t shake the images from my head.  So easy to forget them in the sticky fog that is “waking up,” but I remembered it.   So…what does it mean?  I don’t know, but I am feeling more of myself today.

      Broken! I'm broken inside A pain I can't hide Maybe, I don't want to  Tears!  They still stain my cheeks Are bound to be 'round for weeks I cannot escape the truth  Pain! In my heart, my soul Betrayal darkened me like coal I believed you I believed you  Why?  Can anyone give me a   good   reason why?  Why someone can brake your heart over and over?  Why do I still choose to give them the benefit of the doubt, only to be disappointed...every time?  I guess I should expect it by now, but I just keep hoping that maybe...maybe one day they'll prove me wrong.   Not much more to say...I have to pick up the pieces now.  I'll probably keep on letting her break my heart.  I can't do any other but to love her...family is supposed to stick together, right?  Sorry, grampa...I don't guess I was strong enough to keep my promise to you.

      Okay…here I go again, delving into politics when I have no business to do so.   I have another debate and I loved the input I got last time I posted about one… So here goes:  Does Bush have too much power in the United Nations?   It seems a touchy subject, because as I search for answers…there’s not much to look up.  I’ll be doing a lot more research this weekend.   Hopefully , I will come up with some good reasons  why  he has too much power over the UN.  (That’s the side I got put on/names out of a hat) So…good people, not that politics and weekends were meant to be spent together, but what do you think? Oh, and if anyone knows any other sites besides CNN.whatever, that would give me a better low-down on the goods…I’d be mighty obliged.

      So, it is Friday night…What is everyone doing?  For a soon to be 26yr old, I’ve turned into an old fart!  I’ll check to see what’s on AMC’s Friday Night Fright Night, and probably do some reading and writing.  That’s just about it.   I was just wondering what everyone else is going to do to pass the time.   Anybody out there?

      Well, I am officially the worst mommy on the planet.  I got up this morning at 8 and got the kids up.  I get them something to eat, a fresh drink, change my son’s diaper, put clothes on my naked girl, and search for something for me to wear when I get out of the shower.  I have to leave at 9:30 to get to the college at 10am.  I spend my morning at the lab reviewing for my lab test and then taking it.  This took me to 11:15am.  I now have about two hours before my class at 1pm.  Knowing that I wouldn’t have time to go home and do much more than turning around to go back, I brought a book and stopped by to speak with a counselor.   Bla bla bla…yada yada yada…and some more BS.  I got to see the counselor I wanted and was mostly glad to see her.  Some of the classes I need to take are already full up after only 2 days of being open.  She tells me not to worry, because they are going to try and start another of the pharmacology classes because the others were full.  But she doesn’t know  when  they’ll open it or  if  it will even be opened.  Bla bla bla…not to worry because I can just take an extra couple of classes that I’ll need for my BSN and Masters.  I’m thinking, God, I’m already a semester behind from where I wanted to be because they added more classes.  Now I have to wait  another  semester.  I was hoping to start the nursing program in spring, but now not until next fall!   So anyway, my day is just getting better by the minute, right.  So I go up to the third floor where my class is (taking the stairs, because I’m trying to stay somewhat fit for all the damn reading I’m doing).  I go into my room with an hour still before my class starts.  I pop my book out and start reading Maggie Shayne’s  Two By Twilight .  Part of her vampire series that I’m so fond of.   Now, I have to leave class about 30min. early to get back home so my husband can leave for work by 3:30pm which is when my class is suppose to get out.  I have to stop by the store today as well and get more diapers, some milk, bla bla.   Okay, I get home right…the house is more of a wreck than it was before I left.  The bed isn’t made and the only thing that kept me from loosing my mind is that the trash had been pulled.  Well, dear heart leaves for work.  *kiss*kiss*bye*bye*   Then it really starts.  My son wouldn’t quit screaming, I found out why when I finished picking up the house and go to change his diaper.  He has diaper rash, great.  Poor thing, no wonder he wouldn’t quit.  Then my daughter messed herself, which she’s really to big to be doing and then they both start fighting and just…just being a four and a two year old!  I yelled at them and sent them into their rooms..."and the quilt washes over me."  I am  SO  ready for bed!

      Sometimes, when we aren’t thinking about it and we aren’t concerned with it…it arrives.  Sitting up last night with my wonderful husband, I realized my life couldn’t be better.  So what if we’re struggling, so what if times aren’t the best, so what?  In my life I have a wonderful and caring husband.  In my life I have two wonderful and good children.  I have a small family and a house to call my own.  I’m fortunate, very fortunate.   I have to sit back and wonder what I did to deserve this…I don’t remember being an angel.  It’s great that God doesn’t care about that.   I’ve run all week long, doing crap that had to get done.  The weekend was supposed to be without tedious house work.  Didn’t quite turn out like that.  All in all, it hasn’t been that bad.  The world didn’t end because the house isn’t sparkling.   Mid-terms are coming up already and I need to go enroll for the fall semester.  I’m just not looking forward having to deal with those stupid counselors they have me speak with.  They just frustrate me.  Not only do I have to work up the courage to go down and speak with them, I also have taken to writing down any questions that I have so they won’t ignore what I ask and change the subject.  How do they even get hired?  Hmph!  I guess I shouldn’t get so upset with them, but I usually come home with tears after having to deal with their “procedures.”  …Ah, but to be out of school in two years will be reward enough!  I’ll thumb my nose at them and never go back, I’ll be going to OU for my BSN and Masters.  I think I’m even beginning to let myself be persuaded to go for my PhD in nursing later.  We’ll see, I’ll cross that bridge when I come to it.   I needed last night, badly.  It was a reaffirmation of my love for Kirk as well as my children.  I guess when you’re with someone for so long it becomes difficult to remember, why.  Why are we with them, again?  I laugh, but it’s really not a laughing matter.  You know they say the number one reason for divorce is money.  And believe me it’s been tight around here, if not non-existent at times.  I hope the old adage is true about families being closer due to hardships…because it’s been a struggle.  There have been many tearful night while trying to figure out, how are we going to make it through the next two weeks on $80?  But you know, God didn’t let me down, even when I let Him down.   This is the reason I’m going to school…for my children, for my husband, but mostly for myself.  I want to offer my children a better future, small joys, the little things.  I want to be on equal standing as far as my pay check and my husbands pay check (I’m for an equal income house-hold).  Mostly, I just want to be able to not worry about paying the bills or putting food on the table.   Well, I guess I’ve been long-winded enough.  I’m not sure what I was hoping to do by my posting this but…here it is.   Through heart ache and pain Your tear drops like rain I stand and I love you My thoughts might be heavy So many burdens we carry Still, I stand and I love you I know it’s been hard Life throwing its card Still, I stand and I love you You never will know The love that you sow Sprouted roots where I stand and I love you

      Well, now…I had said that I wasn’t going to be on here this weekend.  Hmph!  Like that kept me away.   I had fun last night at my sister’s house.  Sister…she’s my step-sister, but she called me sister all the same.  It felt great!  I am so lucky for knowing her.   Anyway, lots of people showed up and we played a game called cups.  I am really good at flipping them onto their tops…that is until it was my turn and people were yelling at you to miss it.  I still didn’t do to bad and as for the yelling, I was doing it to the other team as well.  It was all in good fun.   I just thought I’d open up the forum for some good 4th of July stories…

      Okay, I almost didn't believe this myself, but my mother-in-law doesn't lie.  Did anyone know that Jewish Humor is a college class that you can get credit for?  How...What...Why?  Why?  Can you imagine the need for that credit.  I can't.   And who determines your qualifications for teaching such a class?  I need to change my major...Wonder if I can get my PhD in that!  I mean, why be a nurse if you can teach Jewish people how to be funny.   Do you think that they sit around and critique Seinfeld all day?   I just had to say, "Oh, my!"  Thought that this was worth sharing, and I'm glad my mother-in-law filled me in.  What are our colleges coming to these days?

        I just took the Geek Test (which is linked to in the title) and didn't even make a high enough score to in the Geek Tendencies...which is the lowest score they had. This is one test that I didn't feel bad about flunking. My husband is taking it now...I think he's going to get an A+! That's just scary...and it's scary that I know he would pass it...LOL, he's such a geek!  Now, had it been a Dork test...LOL! Take the test and let me know how you all did...

      Okay...so did every body hear about this? We're going to have foreign assistance in our election process! Am I the only citizen who is appalled at this! That is infringing on my rights to a secret ballot! The reason for this is because of the last fiasco in the election of president George W. Bush, you know, all the re-counts and such. You know...with the horrible voter turn out that election year, half the people bitching about a re-count probably didn't vote anyway. This is such bull-shit. I don't want to stand for this, but really who am I to make a stand. Alone. We as a people, a nation of the free should stand up and say, "No, f---ing way!" I don't remember voting on whether or not I wanted assistance to vote. I'm not at all comfortable in having some foreigner breathing down my neck as I cast my vote. Voting being the most important right as a free citizen. I am sooo very pissed off and every citizen of this great nation should be too. We should all just go on a "voters strike" and not show up at the polls come this election day. Making our government listen to us! We are the leading nation of the free world! We don't need foreign fucking assistance to vote. We've been doing this how long? I have a theory. The people whose ballots were messed up...are the same damn people who refuse to look over their tests when they're done with them. It's humiliating! If they can do this...what's to stop them from pressuring us to vote one way or the other? If you give them an inch they'll take a mile. It sounds far fetched, but not so far fetched that it couldn't happen. If we let this continue it will be interpreted and re-interpreted to meet the needs of those who are being voted for and not the needs of the voters. This is just bull-shit and we all need to be writing our congress-men/women and the president! We have to tell them we will not stand for this! It's invading our right to privacy.  I've added a link to an article better explaining what is going on.  Just click the title.

        My niece just IM'd me to let me know that she has started a blog. I am rather quite excited about this because she has a very different angle on the world even at the young age of eighteen. Her writing is not what I expected from her, but in a surprisingly good way. It's nice to be able to have many ways of keeping in touch. These blogs are records of our lives, our mind-spewings, our grief, our happiness, our ideas, our disappointments, and everything we want, wish, or hope to be...or maybe not to be. Fifty years from now someone will be looking back at our ramblings and try to decipher our cultures peculiarities. Anyway, I'm so happy that we have another blogger that I can call friend...and hope everyone else will stop by and make her feel welcome!

       Winding streams through forests thick A shiny moon amongst the stars I follow the path as I admire a stick Far away from houses or cars  A breeze sways the trees And it slaps me in the face Fatigue is in my knees As I travel through this place  I will reach my goal Though I may be alone God save my soul Men can only break a bone  I will endure I will finish my quest I will endure, I will pass life’s test

       	 		 		 Over the next week, I will be making paper mache ghosts with my two children.  This is part one...I will keep a log of it.   Mache Glue: 1/2 cup flour 1/2 cup water Mix until runny Then add 2 cups of boiling water and 2-3 tbs of elmer's glue Each layer of paper mache should dry at least over night and each project should have at least 3-4 layers on it.  Make sure you wipe excess paste off of the one inch strips of news paper before applying them to the surface of your project. 		 		 		 			 urlLink     			 				 			 urlLink DSCF0839 			 			Originally uploaded by 			 urlLink boabhan sith .

        This is my very own recipe for chili, but be warned! It will burn a hole through you stomach and make your nose drip while you desperately stuff your face. "It's better than good, it's grrreat!"  1 pound of your choice style hamburger meat 1/2 pound of your choice: shrimp, chicken, deer meat, or steak 2 cans of red kidney beans 2 cans of diced tomatoes 2/3 cup of chili powder 2 tbs of cayenne pepper 1 tbs of minced garlic 1 tsp of salt 1 tsp of black pepper 1/2 cup of Masa flower 1 onion 1 bell pepper 2 (or 3) big chili peppers 4 jalapino peppers 4 cayenne peppers  Brown all of your meat. Poor kidney beans and diced tomatoes into crock pot (juices and all). Chop up all of your peppers and your onion. Add the peppers to the crock pot. Add browned meat. Add all of your seasonings. And cook for at least 4-5 hours starting on high and readjusting it to low as the peppers start to soften. Stir occasionally and add more Masa flower to desired consistency. I like mine thick. Serve in a sturdy bowl...this chili ain't made for Styrofoam bowls! Add cheese and salsa if desired and eat with chips and crackers. Just one more thing...you should take some pepcid about an hour before you eat! Enjoy!

        A small child sits up abruptly in her bed.  The darkness threatening to choke her once again.  She calls out, “Mom!”  No one answers the first call so she calls out again, “Mo-om!” “Go to sleep!”  Is the reply she hears from down the dark foreboding hall.  She can’t go back to sleep.  Is it death she wonders?  How can it be anything other if she feels dead when she’s asleep and that scares her.  The darkness scares her.  She pulls the covers around her and makes sure to tuck herself in the sheets well so that nothing can slip into the bed.  So scared of the monsters that are just within reach all around her that she doesn’t dare move.  Fear has her frozen in its grip.  She calls out once more, already aware of what the answer will be.  “MOM!”  It took everything she had to over-come the fear gripping her to call out into the night.  To alert her unseen monsters of where she was, hoping that she would be saved.  “GO-TO-SLEEP!”  Sleep will not come back to her this night.  Anxiety hits her as she lays in the haunting darkness alone.  Too young to realize that monsters aren’t what she sees on television or reads about in books.  The real monsters are flesh and blood just like her.  She cries.  As quietly as possible, she doesn’t want to draw attention to herself until the light of dawn comes to save her.  This was an every night occurrence.  At some time she starts sleeping with all the lights on or during the day.  Though it was bad for the small child’s health, it was much worse on her in the dark.  Years pass and she becomes a teenager.  Though she is still afraid of the dark, she can now push it to the back of her mind and find some semblance of a restful sleep…with all the lights on.  The memories of monsters unseen and yet so close in the dark forever haunting her frail spirit.  To survive she had to push them to the farthest corners and deepest recesses of her mind.  Never to be thought about again, until the moon rose over head and the sun said it’s good night.  She had never progressed far enough to trust anyone.  She was still the small child in the dark calling out for her mom.  A mom, who didn’t want to be bothered.  I still sleep with a night light on to this day…

        I can’t seem to get that Fingers eleven song out of my head: One Thing.  I can relate to it too much tonight.  “Restless tonight, ‘cause I wasted the light…if I traded it all, if I traded it all away for one thing, just for one thing…wouldn’t that be something…”  I wonder what provoked his spirit into writing the soul wrenching lyrics? My little sister and I have a very unusual relationship.  She called me tonight…I’ve been crying.  I’ve actually been doing a lot of that here lately.  I’m tired of excuses…I don’t have any good ones.  Millions of people go through the hell we went through as children.  Millions of women go to school full time and take care of their children full time as well as being a full time wife.  Millions of women don’t crumble under all of this immense pressure.  Why should I be any different?  My sister called because she had been crying the other night.  She thought I should know.  I should know that the one brother…the one male role model that I had to look up too when I was young and alone, when we were young and alone, no longer cares for us.  He apparently had to watch us too much when we were younger and it makes him not want to talk or see us now.  He’s twelve years older than us.  In a medical family he was the only one of us who chose a different profession.  He chose to become a cop.  He’s nothing!  What kind of a cop lets bad things happen to his little sisters?  What kind of a cop can then turn his back on us because we were too big of a burden for him?  We were nobody’s burden!  We were children!  Just children.  My hands tremble even now as I’m writing this down.  I loved him.  I still love him and he has ripped my heart in half again.  All my life all I have ever wanted was family.  I gave myself selflessly to them and have only been used and abused on their part.  They treat me and my little sister as worthless.  Our own mother…she doesn’t care.  It hurts to have my daughter ask about granny and I have no answer, because I will not teach my prejudice of her to my children.  Out of all seven grandchildren, my two are tossed aside.  I am afraid of how this will affect them as they grow older and can realize the biased attitude toward them…simply because they are my children.  My oldest brother was the one man I looked up to.  We're not all given the responsibilities that we wanted, or even needed, but we all have to deal with the ones we were given!  How can someone hate to be a little girl’s hero?  He used to be my hero.  At twenty five, going on twenty six, I don’t guess I should still need one.  I find that it hurts all the same.  The fact is that he didn’t have to watch us all the time.  What little I remember from my childhood I remember that we were always alone.  How can he place the blame on us just for being born?  I don’t want his pity!  He can keep his ‘poor you’ looks to himself.  I don’t want anything from him but to see my niece and nephew.  The world wouldn’t have missed much if my mother kept her legs closed.  I know she didn’t want me or my little sister.  How could she?  Maybe they pushed us off on my older brother and sister, but it couldn’t have been for more than the first couple of years of my life.  How can he blame us for that?  How do you stop the pain of such knowledge?

       As I was preparing my daughter to go to her grandparents house for the night, we (the adults in the room) were carrying on "adult' conversations. Mostly, it was men bashing...my poor father had to sit shyly on the couch keeping his mouth shut as to not draw attention to himself. Among the man bashing we were also discussing the baby my step-sitter is going to have. I'm so excited. My daughter is excited as well. She let Megan know that Megan was going to have a girl for her to play with. That's my daughter, very outspoken. Wonder where she gets it? *wink* Well, my daughter then tells us that she is going to have a baby in her belly (also a girl, hehe). To which my reply was, "Not until you're 45, young lady." My step-mother told her she had to have a husband first and I'm nodding my full agreement on that one. Apparently my daughter didn't like the idea, because she responded as such: "No! I do not want a husband!" They learn so quickly. :)
