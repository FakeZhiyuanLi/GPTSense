NO! NOT THE TURTLE!...i'm so messed up...anyways, i like drama too, i know what you're thinking "gosh she's such a drama freak" but i assure you that i am not because if i was, i wouldn't know how to operate a computer. stupid drama kids always bringing down the panda race...  yeah...you'd think that with this wacky blog i'd be really outgoing, right? no! i'm shy as hell when it comes to my talents so i've decided that this blog will be my way to be a prick and show off...how i'm going to do that i do not know...how the hell do you show people you can sing through a blog? a singing blog? that's gotta suck!anyways...  this is getting much too long...but i guess i still have to tell you about my day! oh joy! ok so i forgot that i had to go to work today--i usually work tuesdays through thursdays--so it's seven o'clock and my mom walks into my room and of course i decided to sleep in my bra and undwear the night before and she's all like "karolyn, don't you have to go to work?" and answer with "psh, i don't work on fridays" showed her didn't i? WRONG! "oh...i thought you were going to work today because of tech theatre" ..."shit!...thanks mom"  so i get to work and my boss is late...i could have been sleeping!!! grrr...anyways, we got nothing done with the computers we were working on.  at 11 my boss and i got some chinese food thanks to JHS--my employer-- and then i went to tech at 12.  at tech i ended up sorting fabric and cutting it into long tattered pieces...wtf?! yeah, well, i was asked to go see three movies today! ancherman, raising helen, and spiderman2...and by three different groups of people! go karolyn! oh wait,  DON'T  GO KAROLYN BECAUSE  SHE  DECIDED TO  STAY AT HOME  AND BE A BASTARD! grrr...so yeah, i'm off to find an online version of Gates of Fire because i have to read the damn thing by monday...suck ass  -Karolyn
