      Yesterday I went to the final of the 'Wraak van Brabant', which is a pop-prize for bands from the 'county' I live in: Brabant in The Netherlands. My ex-band mate  urlLink Wilm  played his last gig for  The_inaxy  and guess what? They won in the Rock/pop category. Another cool band I saw was  Linked . After the gigs I went into Tilburg town to see some mates and drown some... Ice-Teas. Had to drive of course...

      Today I had a football tournament. It was weeks since I played, so Now I'm hurtin' all over the place. And that's just the physical pains. But hey, I'll live. I guess. We finished third. After trailing 2 to nothing in the final game(3/4 place play-off) we scored another couple of goals, three to be precise;).

      Went to see this band with a mate of mine at the University campus Eindhoven. The band was called  Wealthy Beggar , and they rocked. Opening act was Fair Play Committee, and they were pretty ok. Just not as seasoned as the beggars. They even played a song I know.. Can't remember it though, let alone the title:) Update: 03-06-2004, just listened to the  urlLink pinkpop  gig on the net, and found out which song it was:): 'How does it feel'.

      Today I had another interview. I was supposed to meet up with a guy from the agency, which introduced me to the company I was applying at. I got there in time (of course), but was surprised to see that there was another applicant (for the same function) who was going to travel with us. It was a 1 hour drive, so a bit strange.. But hey, I seen stranger things:) We got to Hilversum, where the service part of the company ( urlLink Thomson Grass Valley ) is based. In Hilversum we made a D-tour, and arrived at the company 20 mins. late. No biggy since it wasn't my fault:). The interviewer first explained some stuff about the company and only then got to talk to us apart. I think it went pretty ok, although I always need some time to gain my selfcomposure it seems. That's the thing which f***s up most my interviews. The job profile seems interesting enough: Maintaining (including repairs) the full media setup. This includes cameras and all other broadcasting stuff. It would mainly involve Thomson equipment, but also some third-parties equipment. Location of the job would mainly be Hilversum Media-park. But also at other sites of for example regional broadcasters. So my conclusion is: it went pretty ok, especially pointing out my good point-> my interest for the broadcasting branch.

      Today/Yesterday.. ok make it sunday I saw  urlLink Incubus  Like I posted in an earlier log I wasn't to sure that they would live upto my expectation of the best band in the world. Because since the first show I saw them, they never got to grip me like they did that first night. And the new CD wasn't costantly in my player, unlike all the previous albums which I own. Ok, so we arrived at Ahoy, payed the usual astronomical high prive to park the car, and went in. Had a look at the Mech, pretty cool:) the book  urlLink white fluffy clouds  is brill! The opening act was pretty cool, got a cool FREE sticker at the end of the gigs. Then it was 9 o'clock.. and me mate said:'I think it's time, Rog'... That's when the Megalomaniac intro began to play:D after that it was A Crow left the Murder, same as the CD! They played songs from nearly all the albums, except enjoy:( which is always a shame. And they didn't play the Warmth, but I had expected that. But at same point in time it was Pantomime time, and what i saw there caught me totally of guard! It is Brandon holding a *** guitar!??? the guy can't play that, he can't!! But damn me he did! And the song after(I think) was Here in my room.. and Mikey(I love mikey!) played the keyboard! I didn't know he could do that! Is it coincidence or is he really my (unofficial)soulmate. 'Cos I been learning to play the piano lately aswell:) Next was a drum solo. Brandon and Ben started playing along on some percussion with Jose on the drums of course:) and then he did this amazingly fast solo type thingy, which lasted for ages. Ben also did a bass-solo, very cool and funky.. and then it was nearly over.. apart from the encore, which started of with the song I had kinda been waiting for: Sick, sad little world. And it featured Mickey in a totally cool guitar/piano solo:D and then it was time for are you in!? great song that is. then the time came for them to call it a night.. and It was 11 already. I think a 2 hour gig by the best band in the world is definately worth 30 euros:D so I decided to buy a cool T-shirt which I saw someone wearing. Of course that one wasn't on sale, so I left with just a CD.. Featuring a very cool live version of Sick, sad little world:D This was my night with incubus, and a few other mates.. A totally cool experience.... again:D

      Tonight's the night! The big concert, albeit not as big as the one by  urlLink Incubus  in the Melkweg in the year 2000. The opening act will be hundred reasons from the UK. Probably a better opening act than the opening act in 2000 (Queen Adriana; Spooky!). We will drive of to Ahoy, Rotterdam at 6pm:). Let's hope they Rock my pants of once more!

      Yesterday went all the way down to Susteren (mid-limburg) about 45 mins drive.. normally.. The weather was shitty as you can expect when you plan a BBQ, but still had a good time with Anke, Raymond & Sam. Afterwards we saw the movie, The Big Lebowski. which was still pretty cool.

      Finally I saw Troy yesterday. A pretty good movie. Good story, but how can it not be, since it is millions of years old:). Brad Pitt wasn't up to his standard I thought; well I just like him better when he plays modernday emotions. Before that I went to have a meal at a friends place, asparagus.. mmmmm. And afterwards we had a few drinks at the student bar.

      Finally I managed to see some jazzz:) I went with Maurits tonight. I had to drive again, because he had broken his car while trying to mend it today:)(don't laugh!) But that's ok, I was very cheerful as I should be. Because there is absolutely no reason to be cheerful. So we saw a spot of jazz and then met up with Mau's girl. It was already decided(coincidently?) that we were going to see a movie As well. The one which appealed most to us was 'The day after tomorrow'. Pity it was very, very bad. It was a good idea (the new ice-age thing) but that was about it. After this we saw a little more jazz, and got back home.

      So off to Braga it was, via Porto and Dragau stadium (which is situated next to the Motorway we drove on). We arrived at the campsite, which was again close to the city (walkable now even) and not full-up yet. In the city of Braga there was a festival with it's high point on the day of the Latvia match, called St. Jao's(?). I still don't know for sure if it's celebrated all over Portugal. So it was a nice atmosphere already when we went into town for a restaurant. During dinner the TV was on and the POrtugal-Spain match was on of course. The Portugese won (1-0) and the streets were full of cars blasting their horns, and people dancing on the street. The next few days we did a few cultural things: visit the Dom Jesus, Guimaraes.. and of course we watched the next England game on a big screen in the city centre. It was against croatia (won 4-2). The day of the match of Holland against Latvia, we spend the whole day in the town amongst Orange people. And again we walked to the Stadium together. This time me and Mabel bumped into a guy selling tickets. So we bought 2 for 75 euros, and went on into the stadium. The atmosphere during the game was a bit strange, because it depended on another match aswell. But the autcome was good for Holland, so there was a party on the stands as they went through to the next round. Now we had to walk back to the campsite, which would lead us through the city. As we came closer we heard the sqeaking sound of the plastic hamers, which we had already seen being sold on the street. As we went through the city we got hit on the head with them more and more. We already knew that that was a custom on this day, but the amount of people who actually did it, was amazing. And we were walking around in our Orange kit, so we got hit extra often.  The next day it was raining during the time that we had to pack. And packing a tent into a car when it rains, is no fun thing. The consolation however was that we would be unpacking in the Algarve, which would normally mean sunshine? We had a little drive to the south of Portugal, and headed for a town called Albufeira. This is a very touristy town, especially visited by English people. We arrived just before the match England-Portugal, and could sit down to watch it starting with the second half. Good and exciting game. England lost 6-5 on penalties. Before this we had put up the wet tent, which dried in half an hour after setting it up:). In the Algarve it was a time for partying and beaching, so we did plenty. On one particular day me and Rob where playing with a mini-football on the beach. We got so tired of running in the loose sand and in the water that at the end I collided into him toes first with great force. It must have looked totally dumb and we couldn't stop laughing, but it hurt like hell. My toes where swollen the next 2 days, this next to the sunburn I got of course:). Although you paid close to 3 euros for one beer, compared to 75 cents in the mountains, Braga and Porto. The final day of the week it was Quarter final time for Holland. we went to Faro early in the hope to maybe score some tickets, and to collect the tickets for Rob and Maurits. In Faro we wanted a drink first, so got some seats close to the 'dutch square'(place where the Dutch people gather before a match). Here we got talking about what to do if we couldn't get tickets, and during this conversation we got lucky as the people sitting next to us had one to offer. We where happy and got hunting for the 2 nd  ticket we needed. We found it pretty easy:). This time we got both tickets for a total of 125 euros, still not bad I think. We got a bus to the stadium this time, as it was a pretty long walk. The match was bad, but very exciting. Holland was victorious against the Swedes at the penalty shoot-out (0-0 after extra time) and would take on Portugal in the semi's. we went back to the car, and got back to the campsite... eventually. Not to much partying this time, as we were all exhausted. The next day it was off to Lisbon as our trip entered it's final week...

      Saturday, june 12th we started our trip to Porto from Eindhoven. It was going to be a vacation where we were going to follow the Dutch team. Two of us had tickets to every game except the Czech game. We arrived in the afternoon on Sunday, and got right to the camping. There were still places available and the site was right in the centre of town. So we where well pleased with it. The city is absolutely beautiful. And it has a few Port brewery type places, of which we did one tour (with tasting afterwards).The first evening we went to the first pub we saw for a meal and the England game (lost 2-1 Against France). The first few days we stayed there, untill the match of Holland against Germany at Dragau stadium. We walked in the Orange march to the stadium, pretty cool. And the 2 of us who had tickets (Rob and Maurits) went into the stadium. Me and Mabel went for a walk around the stadium and met a few greek guys, and a guy from Al-Jazeera tv. The greek guys stayed to look at the game with us. And the Al-Jazeera guy gave me his email (Job-possibility in Quatar??). The game ended 1-1 and we went into town to party. Next day we left Porto for the peace and quiet of inner Portugal. We arrived in the beautiful Serra da Estrela. A mountain area with a highest point (Torre) of 1993m. We had a mountain-bike trip, a walk trip and so on in this beautiful area. Here we saw the next matches. First the English against the swiss (won 3-0). Next the dutch team played (lost 3-2 against the Czech republic). The day afterwards we where going straight on to Braga. But that's a story for week 2.

      We decided to stay in Albufeira for another day, as it was great weather we could go to the beach and the plan was to see the dutch boys train. But they arrived home late the previous evening so there was no training. So the day after we did go to Lisbon. At the camping there were again enough places, so we could find a place easily, and go into town. Lisbon is a nice enough city aswellbut the first evening we couldn't find any real nice bars, and we even got lost in some obscure little streets. The day after we first went to the expo'98 terrain. Here there are lots of fun buildings and waterfalls and so on. Me and Mabel went into the Oceanium, a big Aquarium with all kinds of seafish in them. It was divided into seperate tanks to represent all the different seas in the world. After this it was pretty late already, and we had to find a Ginsha bar (a local liquer which we HAD to try). We found a few, and it was time for us to eat. After strolling around we finally found a restaurant which our Portugal book suggested. It said that it was very good food, for a small price, and it was correct:). When leaving the restaurant we bumped into a guy wanting us to come into a 'fado-bar'(Fado=Portugese songs) and had a few ginsha's there (costing a lot more then at the special Ginsha bars. Next day it was Semi-final day, Holland-Portugal. First we travelled to the stadium to get the tickets for ROb and Maurits. Me and Mabel had already decided to see it in a local pub, so we weren't even gonna try to get tickets. We walked through town the whole day, and after parting company with the stadium guys, we started looking for a nice spot. We found it close to the main square. After a while a couple of Spaniards joined us, and we started talking and sharing sangria. But the Portugese Sngria wasn't up to their standards. So they asked to make some 'real' Sangria. Much better of course:). I heard afterwards that he put a half a bottle of vodka in it, next to the wine, and some other liquers. That's probably the reason why I felt a bit drunk that night, and a bit very bad the next morning. Portugal beat Holland 2-1, so no final for us, and we had already decided to go back to Holland if they went out. We didn't do a lot except for hang around the pool the next day, and have a good breakfast. In the evening we went back to Holland and after a 25 hour drive I arrived back at my appartment tired and broken, but with a lot of good memories. On Sunday I saw the Final of Euro2004, but Portugal my #3 team from now on didn't win:(.

      Last Friday (July 9 th )I was on the plane to England again. This time from Cologne to Liverpool via EasyJet. The flight was pretty ok. Exciting during take-off and landing, but boring during the flight, as usual. We arrived in Liverpool, hired a car and drove to my uncle in Barrow (lake-district). Saturday we visited the lakes, which wasn't too good because of the weather. And in the evening it was time for the party. My uncle had been married to Val a few days before in Las Vegas. The party was nice, meat & Tatty pies and mushy peas:) and of course plenty of drinks. Afterwards I went out with my cousin (Phil) and his mates and stayed at his girlfriend's (Jill) house, because it was a bit of a nuisance to drive past my sleeping quarters first. Sunday I went to a 2 nd  division rugby match between Barrow and Workington. Barrow won and remained top of the league. After this we had another solid English meal in a local pub. Monday it was up early to get back to Liverpool. I did the driving this time. I thought it pretty easy to remember driving on the other side of the road, and having your gearbox on the other side of yourself. At the airport we had a delay which lasted for a good 1 1/2  hours, but that didn't really matter it was a nice weekend in England again:).

      Tuesday the 13 th  I had my 2 nd  interview at  urlLink Thomson . I spoke with 2 persons, of which one was very enthousiastic, and the other wasn't really. I had a feeling afterwards that this was largely because I have been out of the field for about 2 years. But I got a call for a third and final interview. This will be monday the 2 nd  of August. Meanwhile I got a few other interviews, like TTIEurope (in half an hour) and ASML. Hope I get something soon now, the job-market looks to be clearing up now:).
