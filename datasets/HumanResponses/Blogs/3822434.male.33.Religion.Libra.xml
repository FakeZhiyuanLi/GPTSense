       urlLink Modern Disciple Magazine - June / July 2004 - Duvall    The attached is an interview with Josh Caterer, lead singer of a great band named Duvall. If you haven't heard Duvall before, you can hear one of their songs at  urlLink Asian Man Records . Caterer was the lead singer and creative force behind The Smoking Popes, which was another very cool band. In the late '90s, Caterer was found by God, and (as he says in this interview) he realized that he couldn't be a musician in exactly the same way he was before. That began a process of searching out how to be faithful to his Lord, and the vocation his Lord had given him. From what I'm seeing and hearing, he's doing that pretty nicely.   Anyway, this interview has some really interesting thoughts from Josh Caterer on being a Christian and understanding how to live out your vocation in the world.

      Dr. Donald Bloesch has just completed his seven-volume systematic theology, titled  urlLink Christian Foundations . This afternoon I completed the fourth volume,  Jesus Christ: Savior and Lord . It is a highly recommended read (as were the first three volumes). Particularly striking to me was the book's final paragraph. It serves to wrap up his thoughts on the exclusivity of Christ as the only way of salvation, but it also summarizes the entire volume. More to the point, though, it is a great expression of what the work of the church is in this foreign world:    In its witness the church should not press for a return to a monolithic society in which church and state work together to ensure a Christian civilization, for such an undertaking would only draw the church away from its redemptive message and blur the lines between church and world. Neither should the church withdraw from society and cultivate little bastions of righteousness that strive to preserve the ethical and religious values handed down from the past. Instead, the church should witness to the truth of the gospel in the very midst of society in the hope and expectation that this truth will work as the leaven that turns society toward a higher degree of justice and freedom. The church cannot build the kingdom of righteousness, but it can serve this kingdom by reminding the world that there is a transcendent order that stands in judgment over every worldly achievement and that the proper attitude of leaders of nations is one of humility before a holy God and caring concern for the disinherited and the oppressed.    That is the pilgrim life I'm after. Not only could I not have said it better, I clearly could not have said it that well. Thanks be to God that Dr. Bloesch could.

       urlLink God is Still Speaking - The United Church of Christ    I mentioned that I am a pastor; my church is a member of the United Church of Christ, a liberal mainline denomination. The link above is part of the United Church of Christ's "Still Speaking" campaign, which is an attempt to be more culturally relevant. Honestly, it wouldn't be hard to be more culturally relevant than the UCC has been previously, but I don't think this is the answer. The reason is that the people who produced this page have fallen for the same traps we always fall for: we're so out of touch with the culture that we don't really know what people are doing and thinking, when we try to talk to people we move too quickly away from personal ethics into political policy, and we cannot grasp that the policy statements of the Democratic party are not gospel.   In case you don't go to the link, the purpose of the page is a restatement of the 10 Commandments (which are, of course, much more culturally relevant when you only refer to them as "The 10 Cs"), contrasting what "Our Culture Thinks" with "Perhaps God Says" (today's not the day to ask why we are afraid to be more forceful than "perhaps", although given the way this piece turns out, maybe that's for the best).   It begins moderately well:   OUR CULTURE THINKS have no other Gods before me is “nice” unless it’s Super Bowl Sunday or the Final Four.   PERHAPS GOD SAYS you shall neither worship your car, your “ice,” or your wide-screen.   Again, I'd say this is fair, but not great. Is this really what our culture thinks? At any rate, this is a reasonable statement of some of the "gods" of a materialistic society.   However, the engine starts to hiccup unpleasantly pretty quickly, as we consider the second "C":   OUR CULTURE THINKS you shall not make for your-self an idol except for Madonna; Starbucks; X Box; Nike; Chief Wahoo, et al.; the American flag; and Wall Street.   Madonna? Is this cultural relevance? "Chief Wahoo, et al."? If you aren't saavy to the UCC party line, this is going to require a little explaining (unless you are a Clevelander or a more serious baseball fan): The mascot of the Cleveland Indians is a fellow named Chief Wahoo. Plenty of people have pointed out that he's a bit too much of a caricature for comfort in these more sensitive days. But the UCC has made ridding the world of the evil Chief Wahoo their white whale. Is there anyone,   anywhere  , who is making Chief Wahoo an idol? I doubt it, although I'd love to hear from those of you who have chosen to find your identity in Chief Wahoo if you are out there.   There isn't much hope after that, as we move into making the "10 Cs" about politics (since there are, evidently, no personal applications to the commands "you shall not take the Name of the Lord, thy God, in vain" or "you shall not steal").   It is undeniable that evangelical churches have consistently been beholden to the Republican Party, but that does not mean that the proper corrective is to have the same relationship with the Democrats.   Incidentally, this morning I learned that the National Association of Evangelicals has drafted a document calling for "thoughtful and sustained evangelical engagement in political life", including a more thoughtful relationship to both political parties in America. Here it is, if you want to read it:  urlLink For the Health of the Nation: A Call to Civic Engagement .   Engagement must be something more than catch phrases and a political party. It's hard work, requiring learning where someone else actually is, and then going to that place. It requires listening, and translation skills, and patience. That's probably why we do so little of it.

      I'm alternating between expecting that no one else will ever read this (in which case it will exist to be my storage place for items of personal interest) and wanting to give some basic information to anyone who does stumble in here.  So, in the hope of the latter option...  I am the sole pastor of a Christian congregation in the west suburbs of Chicago, Illinois.  This congregation is an older one, both in terms of its history and its current demographic.  My hope for this congregation is that we will grow in our ability to interact with the communities in which we find ourselves.  I don't know if anyone from my congregation will ever read this blog, but I hope that it will serve that goal in some sense whether they do or not.    There are two types of communities which I have in mind for our congregation to relate to more fully:  We are in this western suburb, and the nature of the community around us is changing (amusingly enough, it seems to have been making two distinct changes - there seem to be both more wealthy people in our community, and more recent immigrants from Europe - and we don't seem to be connecting with either group).  I'm firmly convinced that if the church isn't being a part of the social fabric, it's not entirely being.    At the same time, we have a theological community which we are a part of, but we've not related to it for many years, as it went off in directions we don't appreciate.  Now, our address is still in this neighborhood of the American Christian Community, but we don't know anyone on our block, and we don't really know the people on other blocks all that well either.    If you haven't already figured this out, I'm not an isolationist.  I don't really think that the people here are isolationists, either, so I'm trusting that they will be interested in learning new ways to be principled participants in our communities instead of just backing out of them.  And that's what I'll be doing here, more or less.  I hope you find it useful, and i hope that if you have something to add which will improve it, you will.

      If you are reading this, I hope that it will ultimately prove useful, thoughtful, and helpful.  I do not know how regularly I will update this blog, but the purpose of Pilgrim Life is to make note of things which I think are significant for those Christians who understand this life to be a pilgrimage.  Or, at least, I expect that they will be things I think are significant.  I don't expect it to be political, nor do I expect it to be bubble-pricking.  I hope that what finds its way here is constructive more often than destructive, and I hope that what gets built here is a view of the world which oozes with the hope of the resurrection.
