We went in the sea with our beasty body boards. Me and Amy were floating about talking about getting a kebab afterwards, then got fuckin destroyed by this huge fuckin wave well funny.  After getting changed in front of  people (sooo many people saw naked grant ass):p we went back to Amys dad and played the best game of man hunt in the world, you heard *but man hunts a kiddy game* FUCK OFF. i ended up stuck under lorry for sooo long waiting for somebody to walk past so i could stab them in the ankle with a screwdriver.
