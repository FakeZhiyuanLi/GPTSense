      Gonna be a tough meet for me tomorrow.  im in 7th for both my events, which means ive gotta step it up and kick it. kick the shit out of it actually.  my ever so lovely supposed friend is 3 tenths behind me in 500 free.  if i dont beat her, there wil be some problems.  its my senior year, i really want to go to regionals.  my swimming career has been pretty fucked up at this school, so im looking forward to finishing strong and showing all these whores on my team that im not who they thought i was.  no holding back anymore.  gonna let it all be known.  ... could be interesting

      I suppose...  Well, i imagine school will start back up again.  thanks for the break *SNOW*! just about 6 months to go until im graduated.  then my whole world could change.  im interested to see how things change when i go to college.  curious and scared of what could happen between the boyfriend and i.  afraid it might end, but not so sure that would be a bad thing.  i think i might need to experience life outside of him, so much of me is devoted to us and well, him.   change is supposed to be good, right?

      so heres the story... i meet this guy my freshman year.  i fall in love immediately, but i think there's no way anything can come of it.  come that June, he and i are together.  that august, we broke up, but I'm deeply in love and terribly hurt.  we were, he was just moving too fast, and he got scared.  we get back together. and things are good, but he breaks up with me again, and again, and again.  and that 4th time, when i thought all was lost, and i actually was starting to get over him, we got back together. and we made up with a bang, we had amazing sex, and i was no longer a virgin.  i cant honestly say that i was ready for that, but i didn't stop him, so it was my fault.  after that things were great for a while.  but something happened along the way.  and somewhere down the line i think i fell out of love.  even worse i think I've fallen in love with someone else.  someone so close and still so far away.  someone that knows me inside and out, but still doesn't know anything at all.  i will always love that first man.  and i don't know what to do really.  because i so enjoy my time with him, and i care so deeply for him.  but its different.  and he feels it too.  its weird, because while its so different, it all feels so right still.  why is love such a strange and complicated thing ....

      So last night at Districts, it was just  wonderful.  i swam really well, came in 7th and dropped time in both events. so im going to districts and i plan to drop even more time.  it was a great night full of hugs and kisses and reunions and just great really.  evilness prevailed at glory days.  that was quite exciting to say the least.

      I am so scared. I know you’re not my guy. I know it so well. We’re just not meant to be. I think you know it too. We were good for some time. I think my heart broke too much; I never fully healed. I don’t want to be without you, but I cant stay with you, not like this. Not when I feel so differently. I feel like I’m leading you on, stringing you along this ride because I don’t want to be alone. Truth be known, I’m terrified of flying solo. To make matters worse, I honestly believe I am in love with someone else. Someone so perfect, so amazing. I’d drop everything to just spend a minute with him. But what if that is wrong too.

      we had our yearbook party, our final one which means gift exchange!  jess and i cheated to get each other.  so i went to get hers yesterday. and i got her UNDERWEAR from where else... victoria's secret.  the best!  and i got her some girly stuff and crabby patty gummies.  she got me the coolest thing ever.  its mostly dorm stuff.  i got a rug! yay! and a dry erase board with kick ass magnets. a bonsai tree! (i love love love it). and fun good smelling candles. and cant forget, starburst lipgloss.  she left a lovely note on the dry erase board for me.  yes, this was the greatest gift exchange ever. we had to eat kfc though.  which i hate.  it will never be as good as bojangles.  plus the msg is bad.  yes it is.  meshellie and i went online to find out exactly what it did.  that was fun. i wanted my subway though! bonus: we found swimmer me!
