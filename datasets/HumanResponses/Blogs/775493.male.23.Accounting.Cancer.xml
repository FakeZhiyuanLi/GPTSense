      is anyone noticing a theme on this blog?  at least from me and justin, there seems to be a lot of "i hate my job" mentality going on lately.  i've been doing a lot of thinking about this subject these days and am trying to come to some sort of conclusion as to what type of work is going to make me/us happy.  the problem is - i am at a complete and total loss.  i am slowly but surely working my way down a checklist of things i know i  don't  want to do.  but i could easily continue down that road for the rest of my life.  now we are both at a point where we may be forced to make decisions regarding our next career moves and something is holding me back.  do i take the easy way out and just continue doing the same kinds of corporate bullshit jobs that i've been doing?  in the end, that may not end up being the easy way out, but for now it definitely requires the least amount of thought.  or do i make up my mind that enough is enough and go in a completely new direction?  obviously, at a glance, the latter seems to be the more appealing option.  the problem is, i don't know what new direction to go in.  considering i've been trying to answer this question since the time i had to pick a major in college, i'm starting to think that i'm never going to get this one figured out.  i guess i'm just starting to realize that if i'm going to spend half of my life doing something, it should probably be something that i can feel good about.  i thought i felt good about rr donnelley at first, but now that i'm probably going to have to leave there, i don't want to end up somewhere else where i'm constantly worrying about getting fired.  justin busts his ass day-in and day-out putting in insane hours only to get ridiculed for trying to hang on to some shred of work/life balance.  he's working harder than i've ever seen, and his superiors still aren't happy.  we barely see each other, and when we do, our conversations are consumed by negativity that has been festering within us all day at work.  since we've moved here, i'm starting to realize more and more how true it is that corporations care about numbers, not people.  why would i want to spend half my life working to support an entity such as that?  so i can cash in a 401k at age 59.5 and start living my life when i retire?  i can't feel good about living my life that way.  i want to enjoy life NOW.  we shouldn't have to fill our days with mind-numbing monotany so that we can have a paycheck to go spend on more gadgets at best buy.  there is something that is very sick about that system and i've decided that i need to break free from it.  that probably sounds extremely cliche or like a line right out of "office space", but i really believe that it's true.  hopefully, i'm not the only one...

      C-List Celebrity Sighting!!!  Last night, we were at this unbelievable house in Toluca Lake (this section by the Hollywood Hills).  Bunch of actors/singers/what not young people pretending to be something they are not, and who is standing behind me?   Kato Kaelin.  WTF?  My friend Dave said, "Hey, it's weird that you are only popular because someone you know killed two people."  I am not sure if Kato heard him.  But I will give a big thumbs up to the fake bosoms that were in abundance last night!

      I was washing clothes today, and there was one dryer that just finished up.  I waited about five minutes, and no one came to the laundry room.  So I removed the clothes and put them in the basket that someone left on top of the machine.  I was just finishing up putting MY wet laundry in, when the lady who owned the dry clothes comes through the door.  I'm like "Sorry I had to move your clothes, community laundry is a bummer.  I wasn't sure when someone would come for them."  She says (all snotty and pissed) "the dryer was still warm, it wasn't like they had been sitting there for 30 minutes."  What was I suppose to do?  I am not wasting my Saturday any more than I have to.  If you share a laundry room, then set a timer and stay on top of things.

      blog:  welcome new members.  the blogspot address where we are currently hosting does not allow you to post pictures.  unfortunately, you have to post pictures somewhere else and create a link to it.  if our blog becomes cool, we will post pictures in the near future (i'll figure something out).  check out brendan's link.  by the way, if you have a link that you'd like to post, you can click the hyperlink button while you're creating your post (it's a globe with a little chain underneath; same hyperlink button you'd see if word or excel) and paste the web address.  just make sure to type some text in between the carrots to name your link.  example:   ENTER THE NAME OF THE LINK HERE    therefore, creating a link that users can click instead of copying and pasting.  just an fyi.  also, click the little graph at the bottom of the blog to see our webstats.  someone from belgium visited.  that's just awesome.  gg www.  :  justin

      Dear Diary-  I had my first blog experience today.  It was sort of like wetting myself for the second time.  If you remember, Diary, wetting myself the FIRST time was a scary thing.  The second time, however, was a series of emotions: pressure, pain, curiousity, release, warmth, and a few minutes later, a calming chill.  Love, JOE    Anyway, thanks for the invite on this Justin and Katie.  I still hate George W. Bush.  Can you post pictures on this blog thing?  I have some of me at the anti-war/occupation protest in Hollywood last Saturday.  B.F.F.

      I'm taking Katie's threat to heart. I must admit this whole blog thing is new to me, but all the kids seem to be into it. I don't have too much to bitch about work wise, but if you haven't heard Bob Edwards has been essentially fired....that's bitch worthy.   So while I figure out something more worthy to post check out this link:   urlLink sloganator   If you're not familiar with the sloganator, it was this "make your own campaign poster" thing on the Bush '04 webpage. Who would have thought that a bunch of smart-ass kids would use it for evil? So it's gone, but this sentimental portrait of it's short life is sure to bring a tear to your eye.                             -brendan

      lol.  i totally know that "conservation" ad.  it makes me want to quit my job and become a scientist.  speaking of my job, i just got back from mendota.  i got to see gigantic printing presses and bindery equipment.  (and wear these sexy yellow toe caps on top of my shoes).  i liked being in the plant except for dodging the fork lifts.  but overall, it was a good trip.  i didn't take any pictures because i didn't want to blind the press operators and cause some sort of catastrophe.  plus some of those dudes were REALLY scary looking.  being there made me nostalgic for central illinois.  i saw a farm & fleet commercial and part of WEEK 25 news.  it really took me back!  (joe & brendan - i'm sure you can appreciate that!)  alright - gotta go!

Four forms and two hours later I think I've finally got it figured out. Word of advice to all of you Illinois residents, if you ever leave the state and seek employment elsewhere, make sure you do it at the end of the year so you're not filing in two states.

      Yesterday I went up to Alsip and the Wilhelm CD got mastered.  I thought that finishing the project on the celebrated anniversary of the day Christ was executed had a certain poetical connotation (of which I do not know the meaning).  So now it's done and all that is left for me to do is layout the artwork and get it all to the reproduction guy in time for the  APRIL 30th CD RELEASE PARTY SHOW .  Which I am hoping all who can drive the distance will attend.  Because this fucker was expensive.  And we need to pay for it.  I am starting to think this is way more expensive a hobby than fishing.  Even with buying a boat.    Soon the Wilhelm website will have some songs up.  There is only a front page now and no reason to go there.   But I will blog to fill in anyone who may give a whipstich.  Perhaps I can get a critique of the hasty and haphazard design.  I'd better figure out what the hell I am going to talk about on the radio today.  Perhaps just a public service warning of "don't eat the easter eggs that have been in the yard all day."

Remember that next time someone comments on the time change...they could just be trying to avoid complex thought.    "Looks like someone has a case of the Mondays!"

      Katie -  Grow my own food... make my own clothes... do my own dentistry... treat my own scurvy.  My guess is that would severly suck.  And cut into the tv watching time.   Most jobs that most people (who don't have connected relatives) get in their early twenties blow.  The thing is, do those jobs get you anywhere else?  Or are they just an unconnected series of activities?  Given my choice, I'd rather not work at all. Because I am basically lazy.  But at least I don't work for absolutely no money (as I have in past), for people who do not give a shit how good or bad of a job I do (as I have in the past; guess where?), destroy my nerves, work with people I hate (uh, hmmm...) or force me to do something I am morally against.    So I guess the hard part is to figure out what color your  urlLink proverbial parachute  might be and how hard you are willing to work and how small of a salary you are willing to accept.  That's the hard part.  But spend some time to figure out how to get there because you will most likely not open the paper one day and go "that's it!"  You'll probably have to meander through something else you don't really want to do first.  And nobody ever said work was the way to anything but a paycheck anyway.  The thing I like most about my job is that I hardly think about it when I am not there.    -s

      i like the montana compound idea.  my absolute ideal would be to be 100% self-sufficient by growing my own food, making my own clothes, etc. that way i wouldn't have to be so hopelessly dependent on "the man".  but that would probably end up being more work than just sucking it up and becoming a yuppie.  i guess we're all screwed no matter what so i should probably just deal with it.  on another note, wanna see something that sucks?  this is two blocks from where we live!   urlLink pot bust   why, oh why, did i not know about this sooner???

      You're not the only one, Katie. To take it to a very basic level, work sucks.  You HAVE to find something you want to do and do it.  It's such a bummer at this age range, because you want to make the best decisions for you and your future, but have nothing to base them on.  Does that make any sense at all?  sorry.  The system really is tough to work against; I wanted to work like a waiter job for a month, save up, go surfing for a month, go back to waiting tables for a month, back to surfing.  After a year of that, if you wanted to get back into the "regular working world", your resume is MESSED up and pretty much unacceptable.  What are we to do?  Start a compound in Montana?  As long as there is some good smoke up there!  Agreeing with wasting our young life working, I sold cars for about 6 months.  The money was AWESOME.  I had NO free time to write or record music (the reason I moved to CA).  I worked every weekend, ALL weekend, and every holiday.  I decided that at 24, I AM NOT WASTING WEEKENDS, HOLIDAYS, and FREETIME.  In the words of Jon Bon Jovi, "it's my life".  I am not here to spend it doing things that do not interest me.  But, like you said, just ask yourself "what do I really want to do?".  Then start sending annoying postcards every week to the people who do that particular thing.  Bug them, pester them, get your name into their head.  Tell them you are interested in their field blah blah blah.  After a while of this, they will have to contact you just to stop the postcards!

      Flight Problems- I was flying back from Bloomington to LA.  I left Bloom. at 6pm CST, and got home at 5am CST.  This is too much travel time.  My flight from O'Hare was cancelled, then I got put on standby for the next flight, which was forever later.  I made it, luckily.  Airlines can really piss you off sometimes.  BUT, while I was home for the wedding of a good, childhood friend (instead of a bad one), at the reception, everyone (but I) was very drunk.  Fast forward a few minutes, and you have Bestman grabbing Groomsman 1's ass (and Groomsman 1's wife's ass) simultaneously.  Groomsman 1 punches Bestman in the eye, splitting head open.  Groomsman 2 and Usher 2 try to restrain Groomsman 1.  Groomsman 1 punches (and cuts) Usher 2's face, and breaks nose of Groomsman 2.  Usher 1 (me) watches on in disbelief, as "country" friends beat each other up at mutual friend's wedding.  sweet.

      kill bill vol. 1 is a really good movie.  i've heard people say the stupidest criticisms about the movie.  ignore them all.  rent this movie.  would anyone be interested if i tried to add an rss feed to the blog?  rss is a new way to syndicate news over the internet using xml.  i could add a feed to the blog, and we would get news updates whenever we visited here (instead of actually navigating to yahoo.com for news).  leave your feedback if you care.  as i figure out if it would be feasible for us to visit bloomington-normal soon, i'd just rather say that people should come up here to visit us.  want to hit a cubs game?  come see us.  want to see concerts?  come see us.  is that wrong?  in all seriousness, i would like to go to central illinois soon.  it's been a long time since i've been there.  i'm sure it would be fun.  except for all the tornados...  peace :)

      Ever have the Internet go down?  For four days, my broadband wasn't connecting at home, and at work they stopped allowing us to surf online.  So, I was SOL for a while until I could catch SBC Communications.   They said it was that Sasser worm or something that disrupted the whole WWW.  Even Apple computers (me) were affected by the slowness of all the PCs.  Boo.  Done, fixed, back up, and the Blog looks good Justin.  You are a hard worker.  I was watching NOVA on PBS the other night, and it was awesome.  I learned that over the past 3 million years, our magnetic field has switched back and forth from magnetic north, to south, to north and so on.  It does it every 200,000 years or so, and right now ours has been getting weaker for some time.  In the past, it starts to get weak before it switches.  So, in conclusion, it appears our magnetic field will be switching relatively soon.  Wanted to give everyone a heads up on that.  Listening to Squirrel Nut Zippers, that was a classy group.  Coming back to B/N next weekend, AND on June 10-14.  Justin, Katie, do you have any reason to be down in Normal anymore?  Probably not.  But in case you are having holiday down there, just call.  Work sucks.  I love the hours, brand new office, great location, work with my girlfriend (that is usually good!), my friend is my manager, but I am not doing well right now, and the job is tedious and boring.  What is next?  Who the hell knows?    Dave (one of my roommates/best friend) is going to FINALLY try out for Finch in the next few weeks.  The outcome will pretty much determine everyone else's road.  Our band, connecticut, has been on hiatus I guess, for the past four months.  It sucks, I am paying for a practice space that I have used once in the last two months.  And you know I am a frugal gentleman, and do not like to waste money.   UNLESS IT IS ON MOTORCYCLES THAT KICK!!!  LOVE, joey nafs

      for those of you not familiar with the tunes listed on the left side of the blog, please check umphrey's mcgee and sound tribe sector 9.  i've been grooving to both of these bands for quite a while.  umphrey's is playing dates all over the country pretty soon.  plus, they're playing at bonnaroo.  sound tribe sector 9 is just unbelievably amazing.  i am definitely still in the process of improving on this concept.  supposedly, blogspot (our currently blog host) will be adding more features in the future for a small fee.  personally, i think we can avoid that.  does anyone have a good, reliable amount of web hosting space?  does anyone have a domain that they're not using right now?  there are some areas where you can upload pictures, but it would require us to use a different blog host.  therefore, we would lose our posts, etc.  and everyone would have to set up new usernames.  and that would be lame...  gg rambler.  peace.

      seriously, these guys love cutting heads off.  Why?  Why can't they just shoot the people? Or not kill them at all? I don't know if you have seen any video of these guys, but it is nasty.  Jaw dropping.  hopefully, this will make corporations want to pull out of the Middle East, but alas, most are not even flinching.  Good news is that Fahrenheit 9/11 comes out of Friday, June 25.  It is going to be awesome.  And speaking of awesome movies, go see "Napoleon Dynamite".  The funniest movie I have seen in a very long time.  Apparently it is only in six theatres nationwide, so maybe it will be hard to catch, but if it opens wider, GO SEE IT!  I am telling you right now that you won't be disappointed.  A very funny character trait, is that Napoleon doesn't curse.  He gets really mad and says "heck, gosh, dang-it, flip, and flippin'".  Unbelievable.

      Well, it takes a lot for me to admit this, but the Bonnaroo music festival defeated me.  After hundreds of dollars spent on camping gear, tickets, gas, food and lodging, Justin and I left Bonnaroo early.  Why?  Not because the music wasn't good, not because we couldn't take the crowds, and not because we don't love camping.  It was, in fact, the blistering sun, ungodly heat, and a nasty case of sun poisoning.  Now, I am well aware that this type of weather is to be expected at this type of event.  However, I have never before experienced what it feels like to literally be BAKED by the sun (no pun intended).  Now, this wasn't your typical "I'm going to try and get a tan by not wearing sunblock" type sunburn.  This was 100 percent unpreventable.  You all know that our Irish asses don't spend more than a minute out in the sun without protection.  In fact, if we had done that at Bonnaroo, we'd probably be dead.  Let's take Justin as an example.  He was wearing SPF 30 sunblock on his back under his shirt.  Over-cautious you say?  Try again.  After an entire day of cowering from the sun under a canopy, the sun penetrated not only the canopy above us, but it also burned our skin through our clothes and SPF 30!!!  To say that Justin and I were burnt to a crisp is an understatement.    We were definitely borderline miserable by day 2, but it wasn't until the reddish-purplish sun poisoning rash starting appearing on Justin's legs that I started to get really alarmed.  Even I started getting rashy on my ankles and thighs.  So between the severe sunburn, the 100 degree heat indices, and the constant fear of dehydration I began to fear for our safety.  By Saturday afternoon, I was convinced that if we didn't get ourselves out of that sun and heat, one of us was going to wind up unconcious.  But the worst part of it all is that so many of our favorite artists were playing nearby, and we couldn't even step out from under our sun canopy to go out and enjoy what we went there for.    Two reasons why Bonnaroo sucked:   1) There were way too many cool things going on at once, so no matter what you were doing, you were ALWAYS missing out on something cool.  2) The only thing worse than not going to Bonnaroo at all, was being there so close to the action and still missing out on everthing because of the sun and heat.   After three days at the festival, we caught only a couple hours of live music.  Our activity was limited to the hours of the day that the sun was not out.  And by the time the sun went down, we were so exhausted that even the night time shows were hard to enjoy.    Lessons learned: 1) Redheaded Irish people have no business camping in a field in Tennessee in June 2) I can drink 3 gallons of water without peeing any of it out 3) Justin and I are both pussies  I am sad and disappointed by this experience to say the least :(  Keep rockin' Katie

      So, ol' dead Reagan was laying about 6 miles from where I work.  The line for traffic was sooooo long.  I didn't have to sit in the line, but if you wanted to see a box with a flag laying on it, be prepared to wait in line for a bus for 7 hours, then another three to walk around the corpse.  What?  Why?  That seems like a waste of time.  I almost got mad because it seemed these people just did it for the story: "I went to Ronald Reagan's funeral!  He-uk, he-uk, he-uk!"  Yeah, sweet move dingleberry.

      well, maybe I will be on TV this fall.  I just had an interview at NBC, for this reality show about living luxuriously with Paris Hilton's mom.  I would live in New York some of the time, and "travel to exotic locations around the world."  It is sort of like a reverse Simple Life.  Plain people go and live in the lap of luxury, and see how it is.  The casting people said I fit exactly what they were looking for, because I had grown up poor, on a farm, and then moved to a bigger city.  Wish me luck!  Oh, the working title is "The Hilton Project".  WORD.

      okay, eight days and counting until we leave for  urlLink bonnaroo  and the excitement is mounting.  i've spent the day reviewing accounts from those lucky enough to have attended last year's festival and the year before.  the consensus seems to be that it is an awesome life-altering experience (as long as you come prepared). i've created list after list of essential items to bring along, but it's inevitable that i'll forget something.  (any of you seasoned campers feel free to offer up any tips for braving the tennessee heat for four days - besides "bring water!" - duh.)  i am so looking forward to the experience of hearing new music, making new friends, and enjoying summertime!  camping with 90,000 hippies may not sound like a great time to everyone, but i can't wait!!

      the new los lobos album is pretty sweet.  it's called "the ride".  this band has been around for so many years, and it's really good to see them getting out and producing the music that they've perfected.  it's also extremely refreshing to see a band really sticking to what they know best; i don't imagine a techno album coming from them anytime soon.  read the review from the onion's av club; follow this link.  --  urlLink read more  --

      hello all in blog land.  i'm frequently updating the  urlLink live music blog  in order to get it looking professional.  anyone that would like to contribute, please email me (my friends that like music; i'm staring at you).  it's definitely not meant to only encompass jambands; that's just all i know right now.  ideally, it would cover many genres (my friends that like other genres; i'm staring at you).  let me know if you'd be interested in writing a couple posts a week.  that's all that i ask.   urlLink email me .  in totally unrelated news, check out this great interview of michael moore by bill o'reilly.  too funny to watch in my opinion.  i really do love what michael moore stands for right now.  he's not backing down.  i honestly think he's trying to do this for the greater good and i love the fact that bill o'reilly can't confront him directly on the issue.  --  urlLink read more  --

      it is just me, or am i crazy in thinking that teresa heinz kerry was married to the man behind heinz ketchup (obviously before john kerry).&nbsp; is she?&nbsp;&nbsp;i haven't looked it up or anything, i just thought i'd see who would weigh in on this thought.   update:&nbsp; yes, she is the heir to the heinz ketchup fortune.&nbsp; remember when they tried green ketchup?&nbsp; eww.&nbsp; (note:&nbsp; i never actually tried it)&nbsp;  urlLink [read more]        And she is independently wealthy, to the tune of $550 million, from her first marriage to the late senator John Heinz, heir to the ketchup fortune.      i'm excited, as i've learned that i will be taking a trip to the tri-lakes area in indiana sometime late in august.&nbsp; i probably won't try water skiing though; i'm a total wimp when it comes to that sort of activity.&nbsp; plus, i don't like the idea that someone else has control over where i go and how fast i go.&nbsp; i like to be in control of my own destiny.

      i'm toying with the idea of switching over melody to funkytown to a new platform.  i think that could be cool.  if anyone thinks that would not be a good idea, then let me know.  other than that, i think that  urlLink moveable type  is the way to go.  i need to make sure of how many others i can say are allowed, but i think this is a much more powerful way to publish a blog that people will enjoy reading (as well as blogging).  anyways, let me know what's up...    more to come later hopefully.  i've got to finish the end to point break.

      now playing:  outkast - ms. jackson    considering how early i went to bed last night, i would consider this sleeping unbelievably late. so, i need to buy a new computer and i have many options obviously. this computer that i'm typing on right now was built by mark and i. the problem is, it has almost always had some problem with it. so, i'm definitely considering buying a packaged computer from dell or compaq. i'm just not sure anymore, because having a prebuilt computer means that it comes with so much garbage on it. i guess worse things could happen. but, i'm thinking that if i bought a prebuilt computer, i could transfer my 40 gigs of mp3's over pretty easily. does anyone want to weigh in on this? what should i do? i want to decide pretty soon, because one of my hard drives is failing. i hear  urlLink clicking noises  that a power user should never hear. maybe i'll just buy a new hard drive instead. how big? as many gigs as my pocketbook can handle.   update: i bought a new computer; problem solved.

      well, it's been a while since i last blogged. i mean, we've definitely been trying to put our blogging skills to some good use by starting up the  urlLink live music blog . the idea behind it is to create a reputable news source for the best in live music. basically, post information about all the bands that we love best. if you're interested in getting some plugs for your favorite bands, send me the links. or, blog them here.   i'm definitely still working on this blog. i'm working to get some new people recruited that actually like to post. i understand that this can be daunting for some people. i also believe that blogging will be the email of the future, as this writer does (read  urlLink this ). if you know anyone that has something to say on the world wide web, let me know.   now playing:  kraftwerk - we are the robots

      it appears as though other bloggers throughout the world have this same problem as the bloggers on melody to funkytown.  that's definitely unfortunate.  at any rate, i think we can all work through this.  work through the pain.  have you seen fahrenheit 9/11 yet?  please weigh in on how it made you feel.  my inlaws, clearly conservative for their entire life, went to see it this weekend.  not likely it will change their vote in november (and not likely it will matter much in illinois), but nevertheless good to see people broadening their horizons.  by the way, tomorrow is my birthday.  i accept paypal donations.

      so, i just saw two great  urlLink umphrey's mcgee  shows.  man, i love this band.  i'm telling you...if you like music, you like  urlLink umphrey's mcgee .  too bad the same cannot be said for their crowd.  something about the crowd just sucked.  could it have been the idea that too many show up to these shows in a drug-induced  urlLink stupor  and end up ruining a good time not only for themselves but the people around them.  maybe.  maybe i'm getting old.  that's probably a more likely situation.  but i don't like to think that i'm getting old.  too old to enjoy drunk people throwing slices of cheese at a band that they love to sing along with?  yes; that i can say with the utmost certainty.  it's really unfortunate.   at any rate, read my review and weigh in on how you think it sounds.  as always, i welcome all feedback on the blog and how you guys think it's looking.  now playing:   phish - you enjoy myself

      well, after much thought, i've decided to keep my eggs spread between different baskets. i will be working as hard as possible to get these blogs going. right now, i've got the config setup for  urlLink the leftorium .  i'll probably start updating this blog at some point in the future, but i definitely like the domain and i wanted to register it before it got snatched. after all,  urlLink theleftorium.com  is much better than theleftorium.usa, or whatever it could be called.  i'm actually really excited about the  urlLink live music blog , probaby more so than any of my ex-web hobbies (no, not porn). i'm working to recruit whoever's interested (and whoever can think they can post a couple times a week) to add content to the site. my dream would really be to rival that of  urlLink jambands.com  or  urlLink jambase.com , but with content from all over the musical spectrum. i'd definitely like to start getting more content on there. i know i keep posting this, but i definitely want (and need) some help.  urlLink email me  if you're interested.  anyways, i thought i would ask for some input on the new site layout, etc.  what do you think of the colors?  lime green too  urlLink limey  for you?  [edit:  follow the link, not a bad movie, but i didn't see the entire 100% of it].  point of my story is, i've registered the domain of melodytofunkytown.com. i will be transferring this site over to the new address within the next week or so. everyone will need to update their bookmarks. this will allow me to have more flexibility on the site and to post some  urlLink google ads  (as seen on the  urlLink live music blog  and about every other webpage currently being published - i love how unobtrusive they are). at any rate, click on them to help me pay for the web hosting.  hope everyone is having fun doing their own thing. i miss all my friends spread out across the globe (otherwise known as the u.s., although i do have one friend that's NOT currently living in the continental u.s.)

      I may be crazy but while on hold today to alert Verizon that I’m moving I’m fairly certain I heard Muzak versions of "Mambo #5" and Ice-Cube’s “It was a Good Day”. I guess it could have been the Isley Brothers tune that was the beat for Ice Cube, but I’d prefer to think that Verizon knows what the kids like. Bottom line it brought delight to an otherwise wasted 30 minutes. Plus, nobody I know got killed in South Central L.A. Today was a good day.

      is anyone noticing a theme on this blog?  at least from me and justin, there seems to be a lot of "i hate my job" mentality going on lately.  i've been doing a lot of thinking about this subject these days and am trying to come to some sort of conclusion as to what type of work is going to make me/us happy.  the problem is - i am at a complete and total loss.  i am slowly but surely working my way down a checklist of things i know i  don't  want to do.  but i could easily continue down that road for the rest of my life.  now we are both at a point where we may be forced to make decisions regarding our next career moves and something is holding me back.  do i take the easy way out and just continue doing the same kinds of corporate bullshit jobs that i've been doing?  in the end, that may not end up being the easy way out, but for now it definitely requires the least amount of thought.  or do i make up my mind that enough is enough and go in a completely new direction?  obviously, at a glance, the latter seems to be the more appealing option.  the problem is, i don't know what new direction to go in.  considering i've been trying to answer this question since the time i had to pick a major in college, i'm starting to think that i'm never going to get this one figured out.  i guess i'm just starting to realize that if i'm going to spend half of my life doing something, it should probably be something that i can feel good about.  i thought i felt good about rr donnelley at first, but now that i'm probably going to have to leave there, i don't want to end up somewhere else where i'm constantly worrying about getting fired.  justin busts his ass day-in and day-out putting in insane hours only to get ridiculed for trying to hang on to some shred of work/life balance.  he's working harder than i've ever seen, and his superiors still aren't happy.  we barely see each other, and when we do, our conversations are consumed by negativity that has been festering within us all day at work.  since we've moved here, i'm starting to realize more and more how true it is that corporations care about numbers, not people.  why would i want to spend half my life working to support an entity such as that?  so i can cash in a 401k at age 59.5 and start living my life when i retire?  i can't feel good about living my life that way.  i want to enjoy life NOW.  we shouldn't have to fill our days with mind-numbing monotany so that we can have a paycheck to go spend on more gadgets at best buy.  there is something that is very sick about that system and i've decided that i need to break free from it.  that probably sounds extremely cliche or like a line right out of "office space", but i really believe that it's true.  hopefully, i'm not the only one...

      I was washing clothes today, and there was one dryer that just finished up.  I waited about five minutes, and no one came to the laundry room.  So I removed the clothes and put them in the basket that someone left on top of the machine.  I was just finishing up putting MY wet laundry in, when the lady who owned the dry clothes comes through the door.  I'm like "Sorry I had to move your clothes, community laundry is a bummer.  I wasn't sure when someone would come for them."  She says (all snotty and pissed) "the dryer was still warm, it wasn't like they had been sitting there for 30 minutes."  What was I suppose to do?  I am not wasting my Saturday any more than I have to.  If you share a laundry room, then set a timer and stay on top of things.

      Dear Diary-  I had my first blog experience today.  It was sort of like wetting myself for the second time.  If you remember, Diary, wetting myself the FIRST time was a scary thing.

Love, JOE    Anyway, thanks for the invite on this Justin and Katie.  I still hate George W. Bush.  Can you post pictures on this blog thing?

      I'm taking Katie's threat to heart. I must admit this whole blog thing is new to me, but all the kids seem to be into it. I don't have too much to bitch about work wise, but if you haven't heard Bob Edwards has been essentially fired....that's bitch worthy.   So while I figure out something more worthy to post check out this link:   urlLink sloganator   If you're not familiar with the sloganator, it was this "make your own campaign poster" thing on the Bush '04 webpage. Who would have thought that a bunch of smart-ass kids would use it for evil? So it's gone, but this sentimental portrait of it's short life is sure to bring a tear to your eye.                             -brendan

(and wear these sexy yellow toe caps on top of my shoes).  i liked being in the plant except for dodging the fork lifts.  but overall, it was a good trip.  i didn't take any pictures because i didn't want to blind the press operators and cause some sort of catastrophe.  plus some of those dudes were REALLY scary looking.  being there made me nostalgic for central illinois.  i saw a farm & fleet commercial and part of WEEK 25 news.  it really took me back!  (joe & brendan - i'm sure you can appreciate that!)  alright - gotta go!

      i'm watching david letterman.  he had a piece called "george w. bush pretends to be interested" and this hilarious clip of some event bush was at where he's nodding his head along with this totally boring weirdo.  so funny.  lucas is eating right now.  i gave him two scoops of food.  i should post some pictures of him soon.  along with towelie.  i want to see that new rock movie.  the ads on the el make me want to (as well as do a year of biodiversity and conservation in greenland).  i'm out.  :  justin

      Bought a motorcycle last week.  It is cool.  I like it because I can ride between cars during traffic jams (it is legal in CA).  I ate too much food last night at Cheesecake Factory.  I ate a Hawaiian pizza, then one of my friend's mom's fish tacos, then a piece of Dutch Apple cheesecake, and washed it all down with two glasses of merlot and three diet cokes.  (time to puke)  My little sister was marching in Washington DC today (for women's rights).  That is awesome!!! It is really hot here, like 92 today, and the evening is STILL too warm.  Atleast it is dry.  I just started to read Al Franken's LIES AND THE LYING LIARS WHO TELL THEM.  Anyone else get their hands on this lil' chestnut?  Hugs and Kisses, JOE

      Yesterday I went up to Alsip and the Wilhelm CD got mastered.  I thought that finishing the project on the celebrated anniversary of the day Christ was executed had a certain poetical connotation (of which I do not know the meaning).  So now it's done and all that is left for me to do is layout the artwork and get it all to the reproduction guy in time for the  APRIL 30th CD RELEASE PARTY SHOW .  Which I am hoping all who can drive the distance will attend.  Because this fucker was expensive.  And we need to pay for it.  I am starting to think this is way more expensive a hobby than fishing.  Even with buying a boat.    Soon the Wilhelm website will have some songs up.  There is only a front page now and no reason to go there.   But I will blog to fill in anyone who may give a whipstich.  Perhaps I can get a critique of the hasty and haphazard design.  I'd better figure out what the hell I am going to talk about on the radio today.  Perhaps just a public service warning of "don't eat the easter eggs that have been in the yard all day."

      Katie -  Grow my own food... make my own clothes... do my own dentistry... treat my own scurvy.  My guess is that would severly suck.  And cut into the tv watching time.   Most jobs that most people (who don't have connected relatives) get in their early twenties blow.  The thing is, do those jobs get you anywhere else?  Or are they just an unconnected series of activities?  Given my choice, I'd rather not work at all. Because I am basically lazy.  But at least I don't work for absolutely no money (as I have in past), for people who do not give a shit how good or bad of a job I do (as I have in the past; guess where?), destroy my nerves, work with people I hate (uh, hmmm...) or force me to do something I am morally against.    So I guess the hard part is to figure out what color your  urlLink proverbial parachute  might be and how hard you are willing to work and how small of a salary you are willing to accept.  That's the hard part.  But spend some time to figure out how to get there because you will most likely not open the paper one day and go "that's it!"  You'll probably have to meander through something else you don't really want to do first.  And nobody ever said work was the way to anything but a paycheck anyway.  The thing I like most about my job is that I hardly think about it when I am not there.    -s

      i like the montana compound idea.  my absolute ideal would be to be 100% self-sufficient by growing my own food, making my own clothes, etc. that way i wouldn't have to be so hopelessly dependent on "the man".  but that would probably end up being more work than just sucking it up and becoming a yuppie.  i guess we're all screwed no matter what so i should probably just deal with it.  on another note, wanna see something that sucks?  this is two blocks from where we live!   urlLink pot bust   why, oh why, did i not know about this sooner???

      You're not the only one, Katie. To take it to a very basic level, work sucks.  You HAVE to find something you want to do and do it.  It's such a bummer at this age range, because you want to make the best decisions for you and your future, but have nothing to base them on.  Does that make any sense at all?  sorry.  The system really is tough to work against; I wanted to work like a waiter job for a month, save up, go surfing for a month, go back to waiting tables for a month, back to surfing.  After a year of that, if you wanted to get back into the "regular working world", your resume is MESSED up and pretty much unacceptable.  What are we to do?  Start a compound in Montana?  As long as there is some good smoke up there!  Agreeing with wasting our young life working, I sold cars for about 6 months.  The money was AWESOME.  I had NO free time to write or record music (the reason I moved to CA).  I worked every weekend, ALL weekend, and every holiday.  I decided that at 24, I AM NOT WASTING WEEKENDS, HOLIDAYS, and FREETIME.  In the words of Jon Bon Jovi, "it's my life".  I am not here to spend it doing things that do not interest me.  But, like you said, just ask yourself "what do I really want to do?".  Then start sending annoying postcards every week to the people who do that particular thing.  Bug them, pester them, get your name into their head.  Tell them you are interested in their field blah blah blah.  After a while of this, they will have to contact you just to stop the postcards!

      Flight Problems- I was flying back from Bloomington to LA.  I left Bloom. at 6pm CST, and got home at 5am CST.  This is too much travel time.  My flight from O'Hare was cancelled, then I got put on standby for the next flight, which was forever later.  I made it, luckily.  Airlines can really piss you off sometimes.  BUT, while I was home for the wedding of a good, childhood friend (instead of a bad one), at the reception, everyone (but I) was very drunk.  Fast forward a few minutes, and you have Bestman grabbing Groomsman 1's ass (and Groomsman 1's wife's ass) simultaneously.  Groomsman 1 punches Bestman in the eye, splitting head open.  Groomsman 2 and Usher 2 try to restrain Groomsman 1.  Groomsman 1 punches (and cuts) Usher 2's face, and breaks nose of Groomsman 2.  Usher 1 (me) watches on in disbelief, as "country" friends beat each other up at mutual friend's wedding.  sweet.

      Ever have the Internet go down?  For four days, my broadband wasn't connecting at home, and at work they stopped allowing us to surf online.  So, I was SOL for a while until I could catch SBC Communications.   They said it was that Sasser worm or something that disrupted the whole WWW.  Even Apple computers (me) were affected by the slowness of all the PCs.  Boo.  Done, fixed, back up, and the Blog looks good Justin.  You are a hard worker.  I was watching NOVA on PBS the other night, and it was awesome.  I learned that over the past 3 million years, our magnetic field has switched back and forth from magnetic north, to south, to north and so on.  It does it every 200,000 years or so, and right now ours has been getting weaker for some time.  In the past, it starts to get weak before it switches.  So, in conclusion, it appears our magnetic field will be switching relatively soon.  Wanted to give everyone a heads up on that.  Listening to Squirrel Nut Zippers, that was a classy group.  Coming back to B/N next weekend, AND on June 10-14.  Justin, Katie, do you have any reason to be down in Normal anymore?  Probably not.  But in case you are having holiday down there, just call.  Work sucks.  I love the hours, brand new office, great location, work with my girlfriend (that is usually good!), my friend is my manager, but I am not doing well right now, and the job is tedious and boring.  What is next?  Who the hell knows?    Dave (one of my roommates/best friend) is going to FINALLY try out for Finch in the next few weeks.  The outcome will pretty much determine everyone else's road.  Our band, connecticut, has been on hiatus I guess, for the past four months.  It sucks, I am paying for a practice space that I have used once in the last two months.  And you know I am a frugal gentleman, and do not like to waste money.

      for those of you not familiar with the tunes listed on the left side of the blog, please check umphrey's mcgee and sound tribe sector 9.  i've been grooving to both of these bands for quite a while.  umphrey's is playing dates all over the country pretty soon.  plus, they're playing at bonnaroo.  sound tribe sector 9 is just unbelievably amazing.  i am definitely still in the process of improving on this concept.  supposedly, blogspot (our currently blog host) will be adding more features in the future for a small fee.  personally, i think we can avoid that.  does anyone have a good, reliable amount of web hosting space?  does anyone have a domain that they're not using right now?  there are some areas where you can upload pictures, but it would require us to use a different blog host.  therefore, we would lose our posts, etc.  and everyone would have to set up new usernames.  and that would be lame...  gg rambler.  peace.

      funny thing about that porn stuff, most of the cities that porn is produced in (Canoga Park, Chatworth, Van Nuys) That is all right around my apartment.  You see porn stars at the grocery store, and I sold a car to the owner of Exquisite Pleasures, Inc.  A porn production company...he gave me some freebies!  Word.

Good luck with that buddy!  I want to get that ROCK AGAINST BUSH Vol 1 CD.  anyone have it?  I heard it is good AND is selling well.  F Bush in the f-ing ear.

      seriously, these guys love cutting heads off.  Why?  Why can't they just shoot the people? Or not kill them at all? I don't know if you have seen any video of these guys, but it is nasty.  Jaw dropping.  hopefully, this will make corporations want to pull out of the Middle East, but alas, most are not even flinching.  Good news is that Fahrenheit 9/11 comes out of Friday, June 25.  It is going to be awesome.  And speaking of awesome movies, go see "Napoleon Dynamite".  The funniest movie I have seen in a very long time.  Apparently it is only in six theatres nationwide, so maybe it will be hard to catch, but if it opens wider, GO SEE IT!  I am telling you right now that you won't be disappointed.  A very funny character trait, is that Napoleon doesn't curse.  He gets really mad and says "heck, gosh, dang-it, flip, and flippin'".  Unbelievable.

      Well, it takes a lot for me to admit this, but the Bonnaroo music festival defeated me.  After hundreds of dollars spent on camping gear, tickets, gas, food and lodging, Justin and I left Bonnaroo early.  Why?  Not because the music wasn't good, not because we couldn't take the crowds, and not because we don't love camping.  It was, in fact, the blistering sun, ungodly heat, and a nasty case of sun poisoning.  Now, I am well aware that this type of weather is to be expected at this type of event.  However, I have never before experienced what it feels like to literally be BAKED by the sun (no pun intended).  Now, this wasn't your typical "I'm going to try and get a tan by not wearing sunblock" type sunburn.  This was 100 percent unpreventable.  You all know that our Irish asses don't spend more than a minute out in the sun without protection.  In fact, if we had done that at Bonnaroo, we'd probably be dead.  Let's take Justin as an example.  He was wearing SPF 30 sunblock on his back under his shirt.  Over-cautious you say?  Try again.  After an entire day of cowering from the sun under a canopy, the sun penetrated not only the canopy above us, but it also burned our skin through our clothes and SPF 30!!!  To say that Justin and I were burnt to a crisp is an understatement.    We were definitely borderline miserable by day 2, but it wasn't until the reddish-purplish sun poisoning rash starting appearing on Justin's legs that I started to get really alarmed.  Even I started getting rashy on my ankles and thighs.  So between the severe sunburn, the 100 degree heat indices, and the constant fear of dehydration I began to fear for our safety.  By Saturday afternoon, I was convinced that if we didn't get ourselves out of that sun and heat, one of us was going to wind up unconcious.  But the worst part of it all is that so many of our favorite artists were playing nearby, and we couldn't even step out from under our sun canopy to go out and enjoy what we went there for.    Two reasons why Bonnaroo sucked:   1) There were way too many cool things going on at once, so no matter what you were doing, you were ALWAYS missing out on something cool.  2) The only thing worse than not going to Bonnaroo at all, was being there so close to the action and still missing out on everthing because of the sun and heat.   After three days at the festival, we caught only a couple hours of live music.  Our activity was limited to the hours of the day that the sun was not out.  And by the time the sun went down, we were so exhausted that even the night time shows were hard to enjoy.    Lessons learned: 1) Redheaded Irish people have no business camping in a field in Tennessee in June 2) I can drink 3 gallons of water without peeing any of it out 3) Justin and I are both pussies  I am sad and disappointed by this experience to say the least :(  Keep rockin' Katie

      So, ol' dead Reagan was laying about 6 miles from where I work.  The line for traffic was sooooo long.  I didn't have to sit in the line, but if you wanted to see a box with a flag laying on it, be prepared to wait in line for a bus for 7 hours, then another three to walk around the corpse.  What?  Why?  That seems like a waste of time.  I almost got mad because it seemed these people just did it for the story: "I went to Ronald Reagan's funeral!  He-uk, he-uk, he-uk!"  Yeah, sweet move dingleberry.

      well, maybe I will be on TV this fall.  I just had an interview at NBC, for this reality show about living luxuriously with Paris Hilton's mom.  I would live in New York some of the time, and "travel to exotic locations around the world."  It is sort of like a reverse Simple Life.  Plain people go and live in the lap of luxury, and see how it is.  The casting people said I fit exactly what they were looking for, because I had grown up poor, on a farm, and then moved to a bigger city.  Wish me luck!  Oh, the working title is "The Hilton Project".  WORD.

      okay, eight days and counting until we leave for  urlLink bonnaroo  and the excitement is mounting.  i've spent the day reviewing accounts from those lucky enough to have attended last year's festival and the year before.  the consensus seems to be that it is an awesome life-altering experience (as long as you come prepared). i've created list after list of essential items to bring along, but it's inevitable that i'll forget something.  (any of you seasoned campers feel free to offer up any tips for braving the tennessee heat for four days - besides "bring water!" - duh.)  i am so looking forward to the experience of hearing new music, making new friends, and enjoying summertime!  camping with 90,000 hippies may not sound like a great time to everyone, but i can't wait!!

      now playing:  outkast - ms. jackson    considering how early i went to bed last night, i would consider this sleeping unbelievably late. so, i need to buy a new computer and i have many options obviously. this computer that i'm typing on right now was built by mark and i. the problem is, it has almost always had some problem with it. so, i'm definitely considering buying a packaged computer from dell or compaq. i'm just not sure anymore, because having a prebuilt computer means that it comes with so much garbage on it. i guess worse things could happen. but, i'm thinking that if i bought a prebuilt computer, i could transfer my 40 gigs of mp3's over pretty easily. does anyone want to weigh in on this? what should i do? i want to decide pretty soon, because one of my hard drives is failing. i hear  urlLink clicking noises  that a power user should never hear. maybe i'll just buy a new hard drive instead. how big? as many gigs as my pocketbook can handle.   update: i bought a new computer; problem solved.

      it appears as though other bloggers throughout the world have this same problem as the bloggers on melody to funkytown.  that's definitely unfortunate.  at any rate, i think we can all work through this.  work through the pain.  have you seen fahrenheit 9/11 yet?  please weigh in on how it made you feel.  my inlaws, clearly conservative for their entire life, went to see it this weekend.  not likely it will change their vote in november (and not likely it will matter much in illinois), but nevertheless good to see people broadening their horizons.  by the way, tomorrow is my birthday.  i accept paypal donations.

      well, after much thought, i've decided to keep my eggs spread between different baskets. i will be working as hard as possible to get these blogs going. right now, i've got the config setup for  urlLink the leftorium .  i'll probably start updating this blog at some point in the future, but i definitely like the domain and i wanted to register it before it got snatched. after all,  urlLink theleftorium.com  is much better than theleftorium.usa, or whatever it could be called.  i'm actually really excited about the  urlLink live music blog , probaby more so than any of my ex-web hobbies (no, not porn). i'm working to recruit whoever's interested (and whoever can think they can post a couple times a week) to add content to the site. my dream would really be to rival that of  urlLink jambands.com  or  urlLink jambase.com , but with content from all over the musical spectrum. i'd definitely like to start getting more content on there. i know i keep posting this, but i definitely want (and need) some help.  urlLink email me  if you're interested.  anyways, i thought i would ask for some input on the new site layout, etc.  what do you think of the colors?  lime green too  urlLink limey  for you?  [edit:  follow the link, not a bad movie, but i didn't see the entire 100% of it].  point of my story is, i've registered the domain of melodytofunkytown.com. i will be transferring this site over to the new address within the next week or so. everyone will need to update their bookmarks. this will allow me to have more flexibility on the site and to post some  urlLink google ads  (as seen on the  urlLink live music blog  and about every other webpage currently being published - i love how unobtrusive they are). at any rate, click on them to help me pay for the web hosting.  hope everyone is having fun doing their own thing. i miss all my friends spread out across the globe (otherwise known as the u.s., although i do have one friend that's NOT currently living in the continental u.s.)

      I may be crazy but while on hold today to alert Verizon that I’m moving I’m fairly certain I heard Muzak versions of "Mambo #5" and Ice-Cube’s “It was a Good Day”. I guess it could have been the Isley Brothers tune that was the beat for Ice Cube, but I’d prefer to think that Verizon knows what the kids like. Bottom line it brought delight to an otherwise wasted 30 minutes. Plus, nobody I know got killed in South Central L.A. Today was a good day.

      the news program i watched after this speech (because we accidentally missed it) talked about how barack obama would definitely have a good chance at a solid run for our first african-american president. obviously, this would happen after john kerry's second term. but, lest we forget about hillary clinton and the clinton's quest to rule the world. i can definitely see an interesting primary race in 2012 between obama and clinton.  --  urlLink read more  --
