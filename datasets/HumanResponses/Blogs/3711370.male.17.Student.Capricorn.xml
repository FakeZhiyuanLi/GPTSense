      Well i wanted to give this blogger stuff a shot so bear with me. I'll figure out this stuff sooner or later. Anyways here goes...  Man the Friendship Tournament in Oregon was really cool. It was more than cool....IT WAS FRICKEN AWESOME!!!! I loved every second of it.   The team (Team Revolution) met at the Amtrak train station in downtown Seattle. Around 12:45 pm i believe and everyone seemed super excited. Not the whole entire team was there, Chris' family and Rachel's family drove down there so it took them half the time it took us on the train. Basically all the older players (me, Tyler, Danielle, Daetan, Chris, Jon Marc) had to cut weight. It was grueling. After Danielle came back from Athens (good job girl) she gained all this weight, 9-10 lbs at least! So she was in super duper overdrive A WEEK BEFORE WEIGH-INS. Ten pounds is a lot to lose in a week. Jon Marc and I have been dieting together so we didn't worry too much, except on the day of weigh-ins. Chris lost the most weight i think...and Daetan...well...he didn't check his weight at all *shakes fist* So when everyone boarded the train, Tyler, Marco, Danielle, and I began spitting into bottles. (yeah i know it's gross, but you gotta do what you gotta do you know? =D) We did this for 3-4 hours. What a time that was. The parents were eating in front of us, Daetan (who had to lose 10 lbs) was eating a burger, Fungai was chowing down, and the lil ones were eating their damn candies. Hahahahahaha the funniest part on the train was Jon Walter's stalker. It was a short scranny little kid with BLUE HAIR who came up to him and wanted to play his GBA games. Silly Walter was scared enough since he didn't know what to do. After the long ass train ride we arrived in Portland.   Damn...Portland is the fricken gay capitol of the WORLD. I know it's like discrimination towards gay ppl but i didn't feel all too comfortable when there's like 4 gay guys sitting around you...it just isn't cool at all. With all the spitting we did, we lost about 1-2 lbs at most. Which isn't bad actually, ppl usually lose a 1/2 lb spitting into a bottle? Yeah i think that's right. The team went to Embassy Suites to check-in, get the keys to our rooms, leave our stuff, then leave to the convention center. The convention center was pretty good size. Even the rings were of decent size also (10x10?) Pretty darn good. Weigh-ins.....since Chris was the first to get down there, he weighed in first. He told us that the scales were heavy and we didn't have to strip down, so i guessed we didn't have to worry too much. i weighed in at 128 and my cut off is 127.6 so i was fine. Afterwards the team went out to eat @ Tony Roma's (goooood foooooood). I had a steak (I always have steak night before a big tourney), baked potatoes, french fries, and fried onions...mmm mmm good. Tyler, Danielle, and Daetan had burgers. Jon Marco had "All you CAN EAT" ribs and Chris had..well...i forgot....haha. We shared the food when it came. It sucks when your food comes late and your team has to wait on you to eat. Frustrating....*rawr* It was Jordan's 10th B-day today, but we celebrated on saturday. He had ice cream, cute kid. THe team messed around for a bit afterwards then went back to the hotel where we ate a bunch of CHOCOLATE CAKE WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!   Premonitions are really funny. Especially premonitions about your fights. The night before i dreamed about fighting a hell of a match against some foreign guy in the finals. Sure enough i did fight a guy from a foreign country and it was a hell of match. One that many ppl will remember of me....  It was competition day. I did my morning routine: wake up, take a bath, put on my uniform, then warm ups, pack my gear, all the necessities (food, CD player, etc), and went straight down to breakfast. It was around 9:45 when i came down. I saw my parents and i hugged them of course and gave my dad a big hug since it was Father's day. My family drove early in the morning. After breakfast, the team when on the monorail or whatever you call it down to the convention center. There weren't that many competitors there at all, but hey...you still got to take it seriously. I  was determined, i listened to my CD player most of the time (some Finch, Yellowcard, Matchbook Romance, Authority Zero, The Adicts, all punk) to get me pumped up WOOOOO! I fought against Moses which was easy. I didn't care too much for that fight so i won't talk about it in detail. My final match against Haiti was extremely mindblowing.   Three, 3 min rounds it was. A long ass time for a match. The crowd was loud especially the guy from Haiti. I kept my cool, but damn those guys can yell loud. My team and the Haiti team had a lil "brawl" of their own, whoever can cheer the loudest. So it was the first round and i almost scored a head shot off the bat. Very close. The guy faught awkward which threw me off a little but it was all right, i was in control. I scored the first point with a double kick. Team Revolution screamed their asses off throughout the match along with my other fans from other TKD schools in WA (which made it all the better). It's weird how politics play in the sport of TKD. There's always someone out to mess you up, and those someones were the score keepers. They all of a sudden gave Haiti a point for not throwing a kick? What the hell is that? Giving Haiti a point for just lifting up his leg? C'mon now....man that really irritates me, when you know you are superior to your opponent. First round was 2-1 (the one point for Haiti i have no fricken clue). Second round was crazy too. I did my usual powerup (DBZ STYLE) and the guy comes after me in the middle of it. The hell was he thinking? You can't disturb someone while he powerups...that's against the rules you Haitian dumbass! Sheesh. Surely enough we started to brawl for the first 30 sec. He got tired easily, but so did i. Not as fast as him, but i was still tired. I scored with some kicks on the inside, breaking away doubles. I DID A FRICKEN QUADRUPLE KICK TO THE GUY AND NO POINTS COME UP FOR ME! Politics man i hate it. End of 2nd round 4-3 me. Third round was killer. The crowd stood up on it's feet for both of us fighters. To hear the crowd chanting my name and yelling out U-S-A really got me pumped. Coach Jake told me "Christian, his head is wide open, take the shot, it's right there staring you in the face man...." Coincidently my dad also told me the same exact thing a couple days before to use it...weird isn't it? One minute thirty left and i had to do something. The guy was out of breath. I threw my fast kick to the face as fast and with as much confidence as i could and i nailed it. My dad  almost fell out of his seat he was jumping so damn high. The crowd cheered louder for me and Team Revolution also. It never felt sooo good to have your foot in someone's face. Hahahahahahahahhah. THat kick was the dagger. It sealed my win and i won...7-3.   Afterwards i got a Friendship Tourney T-Shirt (ppl at school saw it, super tight) and went to the Nike Factory store. I got Nike Cortez's (hahaha Jon Marc), a shirt and shorts. I killed a good $80. After the Nike store we went to the mall in Portland and ate CHinese food!!! YAY I LOVE CHINESE FOOD. Jon Marc's family, CHris' family, and my family all went home together as a pack.   What a great Sunday for me, and an even greater Father's day for my dad..........
