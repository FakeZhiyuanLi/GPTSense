      I have been experiencing some difficulty posting on other blogs, and while losing a post to cyber oblivion isn't always a great loss, I did really want to add my two cents to some commentary on one of  Rodney Croome's   current campaigns and actions ,  Write to Latham and Roxon . Its possible my post was simply too large and the site wouldn't accept it. Nevertheless, I've decided to post it here instead, because it brings up some important pragmatic points as well as engaging a little in the queer theory side of things, which is something that has been conspicuously missing, I think, in lots of 'insider' commentary. The sum total usually appears to be 'not all of us  want  to get married!'. Apart from any other problems I, and others, have with such a statement, it is also a reductionist point of view and actually plays into the argument that an issue of gay rights (I'm still to investigate more fully the overlap between gay rights, marriage, and human rights) can be concieved within a  utilitarian  framework. Surely it is laziness and  political passiveness  that bridges the antithetical liberalist notion of 'rights' with some kind of utilitarian calculus.  My intended post to the  Write to Latham and Roxon  thread was as follows:    I have written to both Howard and Latham, though I anticipate Roxon's immunity as 'just the messenger' even at the same time I reject it.  I whole heartedly agree with Doug Pollard regarding the creation of a national, permanent, centralised GLBTI council in Canberra. In fact, the idea seems so obvious I wonder why I've never heard it before (never been that active in the gay community, though, so I'm not sure if its an old idea or not, perhaps I should look into it). I haven't been in the activist game for long, but I'm happy to do what I can for such a worthy, and needed, endeavour.  Labour's reversal has indeed left many of us wondering where on earth to send our votes, but I suggest that spiting Labour by voting Liberal may not be the most coherent response. Despite Labour's atrocious betrayal of not only the GLBTI community, but also the secular, liberal, democratic model of government we are supposed to have in this country, I still believe they are far more likely to move on the issue in the future than the Liberal party, and voting Democrat or Green anywhere but in the Senate really just increases Liberal's chance of a fourth term.  IMO, a strong Democrat and Greens presence in the Senate is at the moment our best option by far. All you need to do is read some of the Hansard debates by Liberal members over the past week to see that no Liberal Senator deserves a single, solitary GLBTI vote.  I have been meaning to find out if the Senate Committee is still going to report or not. Does anyone know?  Matt Currie - you present a relevent argument, and I believe it has merit and certainly a place in the debate. However, I take a more pragmatic, somewhat less esoteric/academic approach.   The gay rights movement itself, as you point out, is not a unified one, and what exactly the gay rights agenda should push for varies from person to person. Inclusion into �classic� heterosexual institutions, such as the �family�, are seen by some as objectives of dubious value. This is true even of the struggle for same-sex marriage. However, the legal advantages and practicalities of marriage (in taxation, government benefits, intestacy, criminal testimony, insurance, hospital visitation, etc.), as well as its capacity to translate the concept of �gay love� into a language heterosexuals can understand �and thereby be forced to reconcile� is for some reason enough to pursue it .  Conversely, some argue that gay marriage will actually contribute to gay invisibility and oppression by inculcating homosexuals into the mainstream, thereby undermining �the goals of gay liberation�  � which is in most cases a struggle for sexual liberation and freedom from the trappings of institutionalised power relationships and role conformism.  While the latter opinion is certainly still in evidence, gay men and lesbians who choose to reject some aspects of �gay liberation�, those who dismiss the liberationist�s strict repugnance for private sexuality and have personally rejected or grown out of the liberation-through-promiscuity edict of the movement, the reasons for marriage have become mostly pragmatic. Any political statements two men or two women marrying each other may convey, though capable of lessening the bitterness of past institutionalised repression, has become a secondary concern.  In this respect, and for those in favour of gay marriage, the gay rights agenda seems to have moved past attempting to indoctrinate the masses with the fact that we exist, and instead have begun to focus on the integration of the gay identity to become a less radical aspect of (dare it be said) normal society. Indeed, the integration of homosexual unions into law, where it has occurred (the Canadian and American examples are the most well known to me), has not been the result of a judicial or legislative specifically pro-gay agenda, but rather a matter of basic civil liberties extending to more of extant society in general.  To this I would add that a war of numbers has no place in a human rights debate. Even if only 1% of gay people wanted to get married, it is still a matter of equality that is worth pursuing.  I suppose, though, to be fair, you're not arguing against gay marriage, but rather are questioning the self-conceptions that wanting gay marriage may illustrate. I suppose its an all or nothing situation; can we really want gay marriage and yet be conservatively resistant to an evolution of the gay identity that may eventuate when it is achieved?  Individuality is within the person, not the sexuality.

      If any reader's haven't quite connected with why I'm so bitterly upset about what happened in parliament last week, read  this . It might help.  I'd also like to direct your attention to  this , a rather long but well-worth-the-read opinion piece that expresses perfectly many of my own thoughts, feelings, and reactions to the  Marriage Amendment Bill  itself. I've been far too angry to write anything convincing or articulate of my own since it happened, so it was especially good to come across. I only wish there was an email address for the author because I would love to get in touch.

      I have become more than a little annoyed at the apparent lack of mobilisation on behalf of gay rights organisations and supporters (such as the  Victorian Gay and Lesbian Rights Lobby ) in responding to the government's tactics of last week. Really, though, its more likely I am projecting my frustration undeservedly. I don't know what they could do given the impecably passive and incontravertable immunity of the government on the issue. Boy, being screwed politically sure is demoralising. And we were screwed so badly it will probably take some of us a long while to get back up again.  I did feel bad for the members of  Rainbow Labour  though. Labour's treacherous backflip must have been bad enough, but for the Shadow Attorney General Nicola Roxon to have attended and spoken at an anti-gay rally in Canberra, which she later described as ' fantastic ', must have been truly mortifying. I have been eagerly awaiting their response, and was not disappointed. Its currently on the site's  index page . What a kick in the teeth.  I have also experienced some (probably unreasonable and self-indulgent) frustration at the lack of commentary I have heard on the issue from most of my straight friends and family. The government has just outlawed me from ever marrying and no one has anything to say about it? Not even a simple 'shit aye'. My anger is, obviously, bursting and unchecked. Heck, the way it was reported by the media I wouldn't be surprised if not all of them knew.   In an attempt to focus all these feelings more constructively, I have been thinking about my first project.  My partner, Adrian, and I are going to make some t-shirts and possibly bumper stickers. The slogans so far (with the item in [squre brackets], usually some form of rainbow flag, being on the reverse side of the tshirt version) include:  AMOST A CITIZEN [FLAG]  MARRIAGE = WMD             [rainbow ?????s]  INVISIBLE            [FLAG]  EXPENDABLE [FLAG]  ANGRY                             [FLAG]  NO_SILENCE                       [FLAG]  I AM REAL           [FLAG]  NO MORE HOMOPHOBIA IN POLITICS [FLAG]  The idea of creating angry t-shirts isn't exactly original, I know, but I really feel the need to do  something . Plus, I'm sick of the issue's invisibility. Most people I've talked to about this idea have responded very positively and most have even already pledged to buy one, which is very encouraging. At the moment I am thinking of simple black cotton bonds-esque t-shirts with smallish, understated rather than overstated, text. Since Adrian is a graphic designer I'm sure he'll come up with something funky.   The good thing about t-shirts is that they're so public. The people you meet are likely to read them, and they might be people who wouldn't normally think about these things. Its also a way of making more visible the number of people who support gay rights, whether straight or gay. One thing I really want to produce with this project are a bunch of tshirts for straight people to wear (if they're uncomfortable with people being unsure of their sexuality, that is - and who could blame them because being gay can really suck sometimes). I suppose the idea is like a less-confrontational, non-religious version of the  Rainbow Sash Movement , in which  wearing a rainbow sash to church  doesn't signify sexuality, but rather support of accepting sexual diversity. We're having a meeting on Thursday to discuss sponsorship options and look at the costs involved. Will report on the outcomes of that meeting later next week.

      The other night I arrived at the  Australian Democrats'  recent  Sexuality Issues news page  where a few mp3 recordings from parliament were available ( Senator Bartlett 1  &  2 ,  Senator Grieg ,  Senator Stott Despoja ,  Senator Cherry , and  Senator Ridgeway ). The recordings were from 12 August when the Liberal and Labour parties were about to agree to a guillotine motion on debating the Marriage Amendment Bill before it was passed*. This meant that the Bill would be debated for only 3 and a half hours. Given that there were 19+ speakers, this was clearly not enough time, and the time that was available had already been allocated to multiple Second Reading Speeches by those in favour of the Bill. Basically, opposition to the Bill would not be heard at all.   [Greens' Senator Nettle's speech on the matter can be downloaded  here .]  Even more distressing, this farce of a democratic process occured  after  it was decided -by the Labour party- that the formation of a Senate Committee Inquiry set up to report on the substantive issues of the Bill, both legal and social, was required before the Bill was re-entered to Parliament. That Committee had finished recieving public submissions on the 30th July, and was working on its report at the time of this debate. The guillotine motion made the Committee's actions utterly moot, and I can only assume that it was abandoned.  The Democrats and the Greens were outraged. I was absolutely LIVID. My initial shock at the government's move to legislate against same-sex marriage (even before the issue was in motion among the greater gay and lesbian community in Australia) had been lessened when Labour decided the matter should be debated more fully by the creation of the Senate Committe Inquiry. I saw it as my chance to participate in the democratic process, and submitted a 7,000 word legal research paper arguing against such legislation on the grounds that the maintenance of such a conservative satus quo, in any jurisdiction, was possible only where basic human rights were not adequately protected, as is the case in Australia. This mitigated the ability of lesbians and gay men to appeal to any binding legal principles.   Given the extraordinary  prima facie  presumption in favour of basic human rights, such as equality, by liberal minded people (and this is, supposedly, a liberal democracy), this is a real problem. The situation begs the questions: is anything that is legal therefore morally defensible, and is anything that is not enshrined in the law necessarily unworthy of our consideration?  So in the face of the Committee, and therefore my participation, being ignored, I sent my submission directly to Mark Latham and John Howard. The following note preceeded it:   Dear Mr Latham/Mr Howard,  It is difficult for me to describe the feeling of being so completely, deliberately, and unnecessarily silenced in the sham of a democratic process that led to the passing of the Marriage Amendment Bill. I therefore submit to you the document I had submitted to the Senate Inquiry you, in your arrogance, decided was not worthwhile. Please read it - you cannot pretend that you don't need to listen to gay and lesbian complaints against the Australian political and legal system and still believe you adequately represent all Australians.  I urge you to respect the differing opinions of the thousands who took the time to be involved in the democratic process of the Committee and read some other submissions received by the Committee that you have also ignored.  Sincerely, James R K Griffiths    * Full Hansard of debates on the 12th August is available  here  if you wish to read everything that was said on the matter. If you have never used a Hansard document before I will soon be adding a "How To" section on that very matter, but in brief, approach the body text with the search function in Acrobat Reader, Word, or your browser (depending on the format you choose to download), looking for, in this case, "Marriage Amendment". Don't just start reading it and hope to come across what you're looking for; individual Hansard documents are hundreds of pages long and most of it will bore you to tears and possible apoplexy ... in this case the debate begins on page 26,105, which is page 167 of the pdf you will be able to download. WARNING TO GAY MARRIAGE SUPPORTERS: I suggest any controlled breathing technique to remain calm while reading this document.

      I have decided to try my hand at web-based publishing in order to focus my desire to engage more purposefully in gay rights activism. I intend to use this website to track the development of my ideas, record my accomplishments large and small, and maybe even to garner a like-minded audience and effect change in this serious area. The focus will be largely Australia, as that is where I live, but I am also very interested in the development of gay rights in other countries around the world.  I will therefore construct this blog in such a way as to serve four main purposes:  1)    To provide me with a 'focus space' for my own personal reflections in the area of gay rights;  2)    To plan and record my own forays into gay rights activism;  3)    To collect in one place, and therefore provide to others, a quality archive of news related to gay rights drawn from other sources; and,  4)    To provide a source of inspiration and education in the promotion of gay rights. This will also include a space for other individuals who feel passionately about gay rights but are not necessarily members of, or volunteers in, gay rights organisations.
