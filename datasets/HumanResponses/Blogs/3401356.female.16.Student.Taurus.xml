        okay so i am not a reject persay, i am not popular but i do not get picked on or laughed at (although i feel like i am most of the time i am sooooo paranoid), but going to school in one of the richest neighboorhoods around and listening to the pretty people complaing about what car to buy gets on my nerves,i am not going to lie and say that i am friends with the popular kids in my class, because i am not( me going to the movies with gary... what a laugh)but most of them know my name but only because i am known as the smart girl or the good girl, i am not really all that smart( i am preety sure that i failed my geometry exam to day) i am preety good. i am not complaining because i do not have a big fancy house or a red convertable, because i am just glad for what i do have( as corny as it sounds). i have to go catch up later

        ... i am really tired of all the high school drama,especially the drama in band,orchestra,chorus, i am not even in these classes but have friends that are and let me tell you more things happen in those classes and it gets talked about for the longest time... i hear about it all the time. time to talk about what is my "so called love life"i used to like this guy, we will call him guy #1, he was so funny and we have piano class together and he is always 'flirting " wiht me my best friend thinks he likes me, because he always hugging me and rubbing my back, holding my hand, tickling me, etc. but i don't think he does and i am not in denial, like jess says, i just think he acts like to all his friends,adn i am pretty sure he is way too good for me, he is rich, kinda popular, and really amart and i sometimes thimk he only talks to me because there is only 5 people in our piano class and i am the only one who does not have a stick up thrie ass. the sweetest thing he has ever done for me ws one day i was kinda down in 3rd(piano)and that nite he called me for the first time because he wanted to know if i was upset, i thought that was really sweet... and on my birthday he called me to wish me a happy b-day. anyways,even if he did ask me out i don't know if i would because then our friendship would be over,and i do not want that to happen...lately things have changed between us and not for the better.. there is now a space between us, it kinda makes me said... but i think it is kinda because bravo co. people keep coming in our class and he would rather talk to them... it kinda hurts, but them i get jealous quickly...
