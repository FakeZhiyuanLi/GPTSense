      Oh man am I exhausted. For the past week, everything was crazy man hehe. On Wednesday, slept over Tahir's place with Anthony and we stayed up 'till 3 watching How High. We basically played Super Smash Bros. Melee and Soul Caliber 2 the whole day. Thursday, we went to Six Flags from 9AM to 10PM. We met up with the other people from Grant and it was fun. Seeing everybody, well not everybody, was fun but kind of weird because they have changed dramatically from the last time I saw them. Friday was a chill day and I'm happy I had that because if I didn't, I would be dead right now. Saturday, at 9AM, I had to go to Birmingham for the Cancer Walk thing. I feel bad that my mom had to donate 80 bucks just so I can get the 100 dollars for donations.. I hope I can pay that back to her somehow.. So then Saturday was crazy man. We had water fights, constantly really, walking, talking, beachball, volleyball, dancing on Jessica and Raul's part haha! Jeez how can they stand listening to (Jook Gal Remix and Culo!) for basically the whole night?! It was fun though.. Jessica is so pretty =)     SUNDAY   - We had kareoke and I was  so  ready to sing (Usher - U Got it Bad) OH MAN FUKIN MC man.. Right when I was supposed to go up, we were out of time. Bastards. Then we finally slept!!! OMG FINALLY SLEPT. It was around 2. BUT! Around 4:30, I woke back up because of people talking outside. And I looked around.. and nobody was around me. I was like WTF! Went back outside and found out everybody didn't sleep. I had 2:30 of sleep woot! Hehe. We went walking and talking and stuff till 4AM I think where me, Carli, and Jessika slept on the tables. Like when you sleep in class? We were sleeping like that since JESSICA had to go in her humongous tent with that guy she barely met lol. OMG I was so ready to sleep. Then I slept for 2 hours on the table then went into the tent with Raul and Stephanie. I wonder how we fit 4 people in that tiny tent!! Me, Raul, Jessika, and Stephanie.. oh man that was crazy  LOL!  Woke up at about 8:45 and we went to the ending ceremony. Waste of time but we got Icee's so that was okay. We took our last lap and we took pictures. I took a picture with the humongous panda! LOL! Retarded panda lmao. Then we all left and Shirley drove me home. Thank you Shirley!! Took a shower.. then rested for a bit. At 12:30, Yulan picked me up and we went to KFC and went to Northridge. OMG no time to rest! We spent a lot of time at the Sam Goody playing video games and the Apple Store going online for free LOL. I bought 2 pretzels form Auntie Anne's and that was  goooooooooooooooooood..  I want more! Then went over to Yulan's house and we watch the Kenshin movie and another Jackie Chan movie. And Orianna taught me how to make a turtle! It was cool hehe. Then went back home and went online for a bit and downloaded CULO!  LOL!  Then sleep comforted me.. And now concludes my humongous blog. I left out so many details. I'll show pictures later.. peace

      So I've succumbed to Blogspot.com. Oh how horrible --;; I was trying to edit this layout so I don't need this banner up there. I got so far.. that I was tired of doing it. So laziness took over. So the days.. the days.. the days have passed by quickly and slowly. Yesterday, me and my friends from Grant went to Six Flags. T'was a fun day and night. Andrea didn't buy me funnel cake --;; Damn you! I had no more money.. Enough money to be in debt with Anthony lol. Thanks a lot for the 2 bucks Anthony, you kept someone from starving to death. WoOT! Hehe. So anyways, we're seniors everybody!! (Those of my grade lol) And we have one more year to go. I went to graduation because of Knights and Ladies. Oh yeah, and tomorrow I have a Cancer Walk to go to because of Knights & Ladies too. Great huh? I've only gathered up 50 dollars when I'm supposed to have at least 100. Just great everybody! I love it. Oh yeah, you can't see my sarcasm there lol --; So the whole day tomorrow.. from 9am to 9pm.. I'll be at school. Walking and running and playing around with my friends from Knights and Ladies. And for that 100 dollars? I  will  get it. I swear to you! I need it desperately. Anybody want to donate money for a desperate person trying to donate to the Cancer American Society?  LOL!  Ahh.. how I miss blogging. And in another 3 weeks, I'll get tired of it. Great lifespan isn't it? Okay, time to plan out how I'm gonna get that extra 50 bucks.. Out.
