      Thorn in my side: Repressed anger was perfectly okay with me  Psychologists agree that the problem with most people is repressed anger. They behave a certain way because they're repressing something. I never thought I had any repressed anger, that I was perhaps the only person in the world who was incapable of repressing anything.  And I was good with that.  Now this whole thing with my family has dredged up all sorts of things from my past--stuff I was long past, stuff I can't do anything about anyway, stuff I can't change.  Yeah, yeah, my parents decided to relive their youth the minute they decided I was old enough to watch my sisters, which was when I was eleven, and went off and played bingo six nights a week. Yeah, I never got to go out with my friends because I always had to take care of my sisters, yeah, I never had any money because I couldn't babysit for money, because I had to watch my sisters for free and didn't get an allowance.  Yeah, this lasted until I was eighteen.  At the time it didn't seem all that bad, after all, I shuttled my sisters off to bed and stayed up and watched whatever I wanted on TV and slammed myself into bed two minutes before my parents came in the door.  I got to stay up and write and imagine and plan and pretend I was on Broadway. It was okay.  But now I have one psychopathic sister and one so self-absorbed that she shoved off her pyschopathic sister's fake suicide attempt onto someone else because she couldn't be bothered.   And a counselor who, in pointing out that Heidi's psychopathia is not genetic, but a by-product of failing to bond with absent parents, made me very damned angry.  And it's coming out everywhere.  I'm glad that my kid isn't going to go off to a life of criminal sociopathy because of anything I might genetically pass on to him, and that I am not going to someday lose my mind and start stealing social security numbers. That is a huge relief.  But it never once occurred to me that when my parents left me to care for my sisters they were five and seven years old.  I turned out okay because I had a childhood with them. My sisters did not.  How could these people have been so blind?    All right, so not everyone who experiences a "disruption in the bonding process" during early childhood becomes a dangerous psychopath, but almost all psychopaths have had that disruption. I look at my little five year old son, and I think, 'how could they leave a five year old in the care of an eleven year old every night?'  This sweet child, how could I even consider leaving the house every single night?! I don't want to miss a moment!  So out comes the anger. And lots of it. I can barely stand to watch my parents shower my son with affection and attention they denied their own children all of a sudden.  I am not jealous, I am angry. Where was all of this all those years ago? Maybe I would have had sisters like other people. Maybe Heidi could have become the lawyer she should have been and Nancy wouldn't consider taking my phone call a courtesy.    And I can't do a thing about it. I should just get over it. The fact that it's all coming out now is making me angry. The fact that I can't just put it nicely back the way one can never refold a map the right way makes me angry. Being angry at all makes me angry.  I find myself angry at innocent people. At Mark because he...well, for no reason, really. At dear Thomas because he still won't tell me why he chose to try to keep his engagement a secret from me when it was so obvious anyway. At his fiancee Nancy, who has chosen to hate me regardless of a year and a half of concentrated effort on my part to befriend her and earn her trust that I'm not sleeping with her man.   At my work, who legitimately deserves it, but I've been able to control it because of the whole they-give-me-money-for-not-much-work thing.   So much anger, all at once! And all for something that didn't seem so bad in the '70s!  I got the duvet cover on, by the way. I am very proud of that.  And the owner of my company actually told me he liked the latest thing I wrote and I was to inform comma-less Harriet and machine-writer Robin that they were to use my copy.  So there is some good to outweigh the bad.  But I really still thing there's a lot to be said for repressed anger.

      Thorn in my side:  Human decency, or, lack thereof, also, duvet cover installation instructions, or, lack thereof  Has anyone ever tried to install a duvet cover? It even looked like it would be hard to do in the store--imagine trying to stuff a pillowcase that's thirty times larger than you are.  But I thought I'd try it.  There were a few unexpected surprises. For one, I really thought that the thing would be sewn up on three sides, open on one, with some sort of zipper or buttons or something for closing up the patient once you got the thing installed.  You can imagine my shock when I discovered there was only a tiny opening at one end with two buttons on it--far too small to fit the duvet in without ripping it to shreds. Mark and I looked at each other, and then Mark wordlessly left the bedroom.  I thought I would turn to the Internet for installation instructions, since the box helpfully came with none.  All I could find were humorous pieces about how difficult it is to install a duvet cover, but nothing in them which shed any light on how to get a 9 x 9 duvet into a 3-foot opening.  I look at all the stores, I look at the pictures of duvets with covers on them, and I think, "somebody knows something...but they're not talking."  I imagine a secret society of insiders who have The Knowledge.  Nobody's sharing. I bet the Fab 5 know, I bet Kai can whip one of those puppies on in two seconds flat. But alas, I am female and have a sense of style, so they would have no interest in my case.  And I think, is there no more human decency?  Speaking of human decency, or lack thereof, my psychopathic quasi-suicidal sister got outed, and not in a good way. She planned the whole "suicide attempt" in order to bilk my parents out of money. Terrible thing to discover about one's own family, but it's better than not finding out.  (See post one for sister's suicide saga.) My parents are having a hard time with the news, but I think they do believe it.  So I didn't save anybody's life the night of the 14th. I've spent the last two weeks trying to convince my parents not to hand over their life savings to a psychopath, and have been met with every sort of reaction from suspicion that my motive in keeping them from being bilked is for my own financial gain, accusations that I am being a prima donna because my youngest sister is the focus of attention, that I was trying to prove my parents were stupid, anything except that I was trying to protect them from falling into the grasp of a diagnosed psychopath so they wouldn't end up completely impovershed in their old age. My only motivation. Protect parents from predator.  The only  reason I even tried to prevent my sister from killing herself in the first place is so that she wouldn't hurt my parents, and because it was the Right Thing to Do.   You know what I think?  This, coupled with a couple of other incidents with some other people, has led me to believe that human decency is so rare that people cannot even recognize it anymore.  Everyone sees conspiracies in everything. I guess you could say it was my own lack of faith in human decency which led me to uncover my sister's plot. Even I couldn't take a suicide attempt at face value! But I have recently been told that gestures of friendship I have made towards someone were met with suspicion and revulsion--"why would she compliment my two-dollar Target earrings? Why does she notice my outfits? What's she trying to get? Why do they always invite us to things?"  This person was incapable of recognizing overtures of friendship, because she automatically assumed there was an ulterior motive.  What is WITH people these days?   Yes, I notice two dollar earrings, if I like them. I don't withhold a compliment if I suspect something wasn't expensive, what a thing to say!  I compliment people when I genuinely like what they're doing or wearing, because I know I enjoy compliments myself, and would like to be able to give that feeling to someone else. If I think someone looks slobby and can't seem to understand color matching or personal hygene, I shut up.   I make overtures of friendship towards people I like because I like them.  I steer clear of people I don't like. And because if I waited for people to be friendly with me I'd end up living alone with six dozen dachshunds.  It is so sad to me that people cannot even recognize who is a friend and who is a foe anymore.      I understand, it's true that there are psychopaths in this world who are friendly and nice and are out to bilk every last dime out of you ("cashews," my friend Dave calls them--nuts who are trying to get cash out of you) and you have to be careful in this world, but I think it may be possible that there are other people out there who also believe that someone just genuinely wants nothing from you but to be your friend, and to have a freind in return.  Isn't there?

      Thorn in my side:   Hail Britannia  I am a lifelong Anglophile. The first chance I had to get out of this country, I headed straight for London. When I went on my honeymoon, there was no question. Back to England. I am proud to have been raised to drink tea with milk and raise my pinky. I speak and translate British-English.  I can do no fewer than six different British dialects. But since I came to work for this company, which appealed to me because of its British sub-persona, my tastes are becoming more continental.  A stoic, bespeckled 27 year old by the name of Harriet, and Robin, her dead-on lookalike for Veruca Salt's father in "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory" boss are the cause.  Harriet has never heard of a comma. Robin is the only human being I know who can write copy that reads like it was computer generated.  And they don't seem to know how to say "Hello" in under 25 pages. These people are *righteous* about their incomplete, run-on sentences, too It is *their* language, they should be the authorities on how to use it.  Sometimes their sentences are so convoluted even they have lost track of what they were supposed to be talking about.  It is my job to edit them into something that resembles readability. Not that it matters. I ship boxloads of punctuation over to the UK, and they never seem to open the package.  Final printed material comes back to us that is exactly the same as it was before I spent hours untangling it.  Our company's material is off the Fleish-Kincaid Readability Scale, and there's nothing I can do about it.  Everyone here knows that no one will read this stuff. It's unreadable. The collateral material that is going into my portfolio looks like the Rosetta Stone, only somewhat less understandable.  I am essentially editing and re-writing, literally, for my health. Hail Britannia.  To make it worse, I realized the other day that I couldn't even enjoy the latest Rowan Atkinson movie. And I have always adored Rowan Atkinson, unless he got naked and showed his skinny hairy behind on worldwide TV.  Now whenever I talk to Robin or Harriet, images of Rowan Atkinson's hairy skinny behind pops into my mind. I tried to replace it with Hugh Grant, but he's too skinny, too.  The point is, I shouldn't be thinking about famous British backsides every time I talk to my colleagues. But they talk like they write, and so my mind wanders.  I have comma-less Harriet and Veruca Salt's dad to thank for that.  It's not "whilst," Harriet. You're writing high tech collateral material, not iambic pentameter verse. Not that you bloody know what Iambic Pentameter Verse is. Maybe I'll switch to coffee for awhile.  So now my father is not speaking to my husband, because my husband Mark defended my position about their open-checkbook policy towards my psychopathic sister. Or, at least we think he's not talking to him. It's hard to tell with my dad. He could just be being really quiet.    Luckily my friend and highly patient German teacher Thomas imparted a bit of wisdom, albiet from an unexpected source. "Your story is nothing new," he told me, in his softly accented, quiet, unassuming way. "It's in the Bible. A few times."  Thomas is a religious man, but not fanatically so. He wasn't trying to give me a lesson in religion or suggesting that I turn to God for answers. He was just stating a fact, when we met for quesadillas and something, anything, with alcohol in it.  "The Good Child is often overlooked and scorned in favor of the Evil Child."  I thought about this. I know my Biblical commentary. I've read everything Jonathan Kirsch ever put on paper, and most of the stuff in the bibliographies. I thought about Jacob and Esau, and then how Jacob pulled the same stunt on his own kids.  Thomas was right. Thomas usually is. Unfortunately, the Bible is a bit short on information about how to cope with it, but I think maybe the point is there: This is nothing new. I am not alone. There's nothing much we can do about our parents. It's hard to watch, but I can't do anything about it. Not unlike watching a train wreck. And my sister is the biggest train wreck of them all.  But it's nice to know: the overlooked Good Child usually is okay, except for a couple of biblical daughters who got needlessly sacrificed. And it's happened before and it will happen again.  I'm not alone historically, and I am not alone literally, either. Thanks, Thomas. A few words go a long way. Harriet and Robin could take a lesson from you.  I can look at the bright side. At least my parents aren't British.

      Wednesday, January 21, 2004.  Thorn in my side: My family.    Welcome to my blog, my pyschopathic sister tried to kill herself a week ago tonight, I saved her life and today I am the family's pariah.  Still with me?  All right, if you can take that, you can take anything else I might write.    Somehow I felt I ought to be sharing all this, and what is going on. Maybe it's a cautionary tale, maybe it's interesting, maybe its a comment on what society has become, maybe I'm just whining.  At any rate, welcome to Rosenthorns.  So, let's get back to this sister's attempted suicide thing.  My sister is a psychopath. And I don't mean that in the colloquial sense, the way we used to use the word "terrorist" to describe an energetic two-year-old, but don't anymore.  I mean, she is a severely ill psychopathic woman.  She has caused my entire family nothing but pain for all of her adult life.  She stole from my parents, lied to everyone she ever knew, cost me every old friend I ever had with whom she came into contact, stole my SSN and took my name, ruined my credit, cost me at least two major corporate jobs when I failed the background check, and cost me thousands of dollars in additional fees when I tried to buy a house. She poisoned my dogs.  She has never had a long term relationship with another living soul, but has created some very imaginative boyfriends. Real boyfriends can be identified by their restraining orders against her. This is not a colloquial psychopath, this is a clinical psychopath.  Last Wednesday night, I got a call from someone I never heard of. "Regarding your sister," was all the message said. I almost didn't call. "God," I thought. "she ripped someone else off and is now coming after her family for the money."  But I did call. It was the Right Thing to Do. And Pam always does the Right Thing.  The voice on the other end of the phone told me that my sister has been threatening suicide, and earmarked the next day as the day she would do it.  My other sister had told this person that our sister is a pathological liar and that she should ignore the messages. However, if she felt that she needed to, she should call up our sister Pam, because Pam always Does the Right Thing.  I told this person that there was at least a 60% chance that my sister was lying, but because the next day was our parents' anniversary, I thought it would be best to at least attempt follow through. After two harrowing hours on the phone with a completely inept San Francisco Police Department, they broke into her house and found her chock full of Valium with a plastic bag over her head and two suicide notes.  Apparently nobody in our family can say anything in less than two pages.  She was "detained" and then promptly lost by the SFPD for another two hours, while I tried to track her. The ineptiude of SFPD is epic, but that's another Thorn in My Side.  Anyway, now it's a week later. My parents, who never were particularly good decision makers, have come rushing to her aid with open arms and checkbook. They mortgaged their home and are paying her way through everything while my sister continues to lie to them.  They are supporting her rather extravagant lifestyle while she gets "help," though most psychiatrists agree that psychopaths are beyond the help of their profession.  They have practically canonized her, constantly speaking in glowing terms about how she is going to get job training, how she is going to make good on all her debts, how she is going to get better and has such a bright future.  I raised a point. "Um," I said, "Can you afford to be supporting her to the tune of $2000 a month?  Is there a reason she has to stay alone in her three-bedroom apartment in North Beach with a view of the bay that costs more than my home mortgage?  Do you have any time limit for this open-checkbook policy? Do you have any expectations of her?"  I explained to them there was a difference between helping and enabling, and that they were not doing anybody any good by supporting her lifestyle so that she can go out and lie, cheat and steal some more with no end in sight. I explained that help would entail a plan, with an end-date, a budget based on what they could afford, and a list of expectations.  My parents angrily told me that they would pay for "as long as it takes," informed me that I have no compassion, and told my sister that she should not talk to me because I am "hysterical."  There's another aspect to this little tale.  I have a five year old son.  My husband and I really feel that a five year old really shouldn't be subjected to a psychopath who has already shown she is dangerous to herself and to others, and let's not forget that she poisoned our dogs, not once but twice, with what two sets of vets think was some kind of detergent. My parents insist my sister is of no danger, and that I am being horrible. The words "Child Endangerment" seem to mean nothing to them.  Meanwhile, some of my other friends have been very critical of my actions in preventing her suicide. Here in San Francisco, we are very politically correct, you see, and we are allowed to do with our bodies what we please. I am apparently a fascist because I prevented my sister from doing what she pleased with her body.  Still others have criticized me for saving her because she is so useless, she's caused nothing but pain, she wasn't worth saving, and now I've caused my family more because I had to be a hero.  I am not a hero. I did not save my sister for her sake. I saved my sister so it wouldn't hurt my parents. There's an irony, huh? I am not a willing victim, as someone suggested. I did the Right Thing. I know I did.  But damn it all, it is awfully lonely.

      The Waiting Game  I have a lot of faults, but the biggest among them is impatience. This is particularly egregious because I also have no patience for other people who are impatient. I'm always telling people, "calm down, there's nothing you can do about it," or, "take control of it and make a plan and follow through, don't just wait around for something to happen," or the one I've been repeating a lot lately to the various male friends in my life: "No, you aren't having a midlife crisis, you have a lousy job. They aren't mutually exclusive."    But when it's my turn to wait, there is nothing that can console me. And right now I am doing a lot of waiting. I'm up for a really good job that is so perfect for me you'd think God heard my prayers. It is in Fremont, it is in my industry, my boss would be in Germany,so I would have to use my German, especially when I traveled there on the company dime, and I would be working while all my superiors were asleep nine hours away. It  just doesn't get any better than that, except that it also pays considerably more than I'm making right now.  They've told me I am the candidate. They have told me they will be sending me an offer letter. Twice now. And so far, no letter has appeared.  The offer was to be contigent upon passing a background check, anyway, which won't be complete until probably tomorrow, or Friday. But I wanted to have at least something on paper that says "you liked me. You really liked me."  I am a theatre geek, I need instant gratification, instant approval. It's why I hated radio and TV.  It doesn't help to know that if I got this letter, there's nobody here to even give notice to until next week.  But I am impatient. As my sister Nancy wrote in her often family-bashing blog, the sign of a true Depper is to be riddled with anxiety, spitting adreneline and desperate for someone other than myself to blame. That sums it up pretty well, except that I am not blaming anyone else. I am impatient because I am impatient. (It suddenly strikes me as funny that Nancy, in her vitriolic attacks upon her own family, points out that she is desperate for someone else to blame because she is a Depper; effectively blaming someone else for the fact she is desperate for someone else to blame.)  I wait also for Thomas, suddenly terribly paranoid and acting like a trapped animal, I can almost see him pacing in his cage. I want to tell him this, but it would do no good. Thomas builds his own cages and he is very good at it. He's also really good at tossing the keys beyond his own reach. That's his neurosis. But I wait for him to calm down and be normal again, wait for him to return to the sweet and gentle man I learned to love like a brother. Wondering if he ever will, or if I can get used to him being as touchy as he is about absolutely everything. And he's probably waiting for me to calm down and get this stupid letter from this company that is dangling it before me like a piece of carrot cake just out of my reach.    I hate waiting.

      Psychopathia--The Gift that keeps on giving  I should have seen it coming. After all, Mark's mother has done it twice, and she's a psychopath, too. That's something Mark and I have in common--we are genetically related to psychopaths who insist their problems are our fault. And we look at each other in amazement at the sheer gall of it all.  When Mark's mother sent the letter five years ago informing Mark that she still wanted a relationship with him despite the fact that he was a horrible person and she a hapless victim, Mark ignored it. He started ignoring her soon after she was committed for trying to kill him when he was a child. Back then they had places for people like that.  So I think I will do the same from the letter I got from my sister today, which informed me that I am a very sick woman in desperate need of psychiatric help and medication, for the sake of my husband and innocent son. She wrote with such dramatic compassion that Mark couldn't help read it to me with his best Hal J. Todd Oral Interp style--a reference only San Jose State Theatre grads will get, but I don't guess anyone's reading this, anyway.    Good God, she's good. Manipulative, well spoken, and can really convince you that the problem is really you. I could actually fall for this stuff, I can really see how people fell, hook, line and sinker.  She's better than Mark's mother, though she doesn't know how to use a comma, either. Mark's mother is a piker compared to my sister Heidi.  I think I'll keep the letter as an example of just how manipulative a true psychopath can be.  I don't think I'm angry anymore. I don't think I'm anything. I tried to muster up some emotion about getting this letter, but it rang false. My provincial parents are just raw meat for this bloodsucker, and I can't do anything about it. I just can't worry about it.  No, instead I need to worry about other people's lives. Dear Thomas, you dear sweet man, you've really managed to mess up your life, haven't you? It's painful for me because I'm helpless to stop you; it's like you've traveled back in time, you know what's going to happen to the Titanic but insist on boarding it anyway. You're a mass of raw nerves and I can only even recognize portions of your personality.  I wish I could help you. It frustrates me that I can't. All I can do is wait and hope you don't get swallowed up completely.    This entry is not much for structure, but I'm really tired and don't feel like being terribly witty or literary right now.  But at least the score is Psychopaths-0, Pam -1.

      In praise of Geese and their contribution to middle class sleep cycles  It started with a duvet cover. And I lay upon it, and I said, That is Good.  So I added a Baffle Box Goose Down Featherbed for the full sleeping-inside-a-marshmallow experience. And it was Good.  Mark did not admit the goodness of all these goose feathers, but he was taking his time getting out of bed.    Friends added to our newfound fascination. Frank (the father of Jacob's best friend Franklin), an enormous, shaven-headed man with an infectious smile and a personality that fills a room from the doorway, looked me straight in the eye. "You gotta get 300 thread count sheets," he confided. "You gotta pay  attention  to thread count." He placed his emphasis on the word "attention."    "We're very into thread count," his wife Lori added, confidently. Oh, my God, they were right.  I was sleeping better, even through all this strife.  On Saturday, it was Mark who saw them first. Goose down pillows. I wasn't even going to say anything, after all we've spent on geese and thread counts. But there it was, right before my eyes: Mark was *testing* these pillows right in the middle of Costco.  He was literally  leaning over the bin  and putting his head on them.  They were the same maker as our featherbed, and they were $39 each, for the King-sized.  The same ones at Linens n' Things were $119, which were a few more Things than I wanted to spend on Linens.  You guessed it. They went in the cart.  I fell asleep last night trying to imagine how many goose feathers I was currently sleeping on. How many geese.  How do they get these goose feathers, do they pluck them and let the geese grow new ones?  Why geese instead of ducks, or, seagulls?  I drifted off into a marshmallow sleep, where I proceeded in my latest series of anxiety dreams about innocently doing something that makes my friend Thomas think I'm a raving lunatic.  All right, so goose feathers can't cure nightmares. But they're a dream to sleep on.

      Dear Thomas,  I am writing this to you here because I can no longer write to you for real. But over the course of the past two years, I have become so accustomed to the practice of beginning each day with typing "Dear Thomas," that my fingers ache if they don't feel that pattern.  There is so much I would like to say to you. But I can never say them, and you don't want to hear them. And I know that you will never find this blog, so I can write them here and at least they'll be expressed.  Thomas, I dreamed about you before I ever met you or knew you existed. I dreamed that one day I would have a dear friend with whom I could walk and talk, meet for coffee, exchange e-mails, share secrets, have fun. I didn't want a partner, or a lover, or an affair. I wanted a friend. And then there you were, and you made me so incredibly happy. I felt so much joy in your company because it meant that my fondest, deepest wish had finally come true. . But who knew that it would so abruptly end?  I guess it ended four months ago, but it's taken me this long to realize that it wasn't a mood, it wasn't a phase, that it was permanent.  And now you have the nerve to say it wasn't personal.  How can shattering my heart  not  be personal? And without even so much as the slightest tender mercy of an explanation.  Do you think you are the only one who can feel pain, Thomas?   Yes, of course I know that you are dropping me because it's  easier  to drop me than to fight with Nancy about it.  And yes I know that it's symptomatic of a larger problem.  It has been so maddening to watch you over these past few months, gaining weight at an alarming rate, complaining about your terrible relationship; you must have been thinking if you put a ring on her finger, it would stop the fighting. If you dropped a dear friend, maybe  that  would stop the fighting. If you dropped all your hobbies and lived only for her, maybe  that  would stop the fighting. And you must now think, If you buy a house, that will stop the fighting. If you marry and have children, that will stop the fighting. You would do anything to stop the fighting, but nothing works, does it, Thomas? In fact, it gets worse. And you resent it more because nothing you have given up gives you the payback you want. You have chosen, stubbornly, to live this life, which can have no end except for lonlieness and destruction. It has already begun, and it began with me. Or perhaps earlier, I don't know. Except that I do know you have isolated yourself from everything that does not meet her approval, which is most everything you ever enjoyed.  And because I love you so much, it kills me to know that this is the fate to which you have sealed yourself.  To be terrified to step out of her view for more than two minutes, clutching your cellphone for dear life, waiting for her to call you to tell you what you must do next.  Such a brilliant mind, Thomas, such a loving and dear heart, completely controlled and dominated, completely without independent thought. Or if you do still have them, you must surpress them, for fear they might cause another fight.  But you know what? I would accept you this way. I would silently watch you become alarmingly heavier and heavier, I would dance at your wedding,  I would continue to love you and support you and listen to you anyway, because that's what good friends do.  I would continue to be the one beacon in your life, but you won't let me. I thought you had the ability to recognize a true and stable friend. But your ability to recognize anything has become so clouded with the desperation to end the fighting by doing anything at all, no matter the cost, except the only sensible thing you  can  do, that you don't see loyalty, you don't see heartbreak, you don't accept love or caring.  You don't even have a sense of your own self worth. Once you asked me plaintively, "Do you think I am that weak? Do you think I am that low?"  The answer is yes to the weak, no to the low. Because, my dear Dr. Thomas Loecherbach, I will love you until the day I die. I will always be your friend. I do not allow anyone to say anything negative about you in my presence, even when they are outraged at you, or are simply trying to make me feel good by painting you in a negative light. I don't let them do it. I think you are a wonderful man, and it has been a privilege to know you. I will never desert you, even though you will not allow me in your life. I am resolved to love a ghost. Your fate is a life of abject misery, a life you have chosen for yourself. Mine is to love a man who will soon be a distant memory.  And this started out as a dream coming true. How bloody ironic.  I miss you, dear Thomas.

      Sadness. Traurigkeit.  It has been a few days since my last post, but since there is no one chomping at the bit to read my whining I suppose deadlines hardly matter.  I am home alone today, which is about the worst place I could possibly be, because "alone" and I don't always get along.    I got the job with Force, which is good news, provided we don't all get laid off in three months when Solectron sells it. I start on the 15th. I gave notice last Tuesday afternoon.  By Wednesday morning, a flash flood had come and destroyed most of Adax.  Now some would say this is some kind of karma happening, some physicalization of a clean sweep, a washing away of pain and frustration, and, in the literary sense, I suppose it is.  But in the physical sense it is very different.  I only wanted to leave my company. I didn't want to see it destroyed. I didn't want to see my co-workers walking around in a daze as years of work floated in the lake. I didn't want to see it torn apart; I didn't even want to see the horrible crazy owner sitting, staring into space because two days after he buried his father in an Adax teeshirt, Adax was under a foot and a half of water. Nobody really wishes harm.  But see all those things I did. And it makes me sad.  I've been off of work since I made it out of the flood on Wednesday morning, spending money as though I had no budget, and tomorrow I'm supposed to go back to work. I can't imagine why. My furniture is not usable, my files are pulp. I'm not sure why I'm wanted there, except maybe to remind me of the karma.  But surely there can be no karma in my estranged friendship with Thomas. I do not believe I did anything that would actually make me deserve the pain I'm in now, and I've been doing some serious self-examination here.  I've done nothing but provide that man friendship. I've done nothing to cause his fiancee harm, though the only reason I don't like her is because she rejected any possibility that I might be a friendly sort.  But here it is.  How does one ever know if a friendship is real?  At what point do they say, "Okay, this person isn't going to suddenly change personalities and decide I am no longer worth anything in their lives. This person isn't after anything, this person isn't lying to me, doesn't want to cheat me, and only wants to share my life as a friend"?  And then, after you've reached the point of acceptance, that they're not going to do any of those things, what happens when they do?  Thomas is there, and then he's not. And sometimes he's there and he's not at the same time.  Thomas is cold and can inspire great intimidation. Thomas is a warm, wonderful and loving man who earned a piece of my heart with his quiet dedication and daily e-mails.  Thomas opened up to me. Thomas damned me for knowing about him. Thomas won't answer my e-mails unless they're school related. Thomas invites me to coffee and encourages me to keep writing e-mails that aren't school related.  Thomas comes with me to see Mark's play and even comes to our party. Thomas pretends past conversations never took place, Thomas won't discuss the play.  Thomas has no time to get together, Thomas goes to political events twice a week. Thomas has time for a walk in the afternoon. Thomas forgets to tell me that he doesn't have to take a day off without pay every two weeks now.  Thomas is friendly and nice. Thomas is cold and heartless.  All at once, sometimes sequentially, and all of it new.  Thomas marked me down.   The e-mails that say how much I mean to him--are they null and void?  Why should I put up with this? Thomas asks me to be patient. I wonder what I am being patient for, exactly. But I can deny what was once my dear friend Thomas Loecherbach nothing.  Once you've determined that this person is a real friend who would never kill you slowly with little tiny stabs, then bandage them, then stab you again, you start to love them. You find a safe place in them. And when the knife pokes start coming, you don't believe it's real. You don't believe it will last. You don't understand what happened. And you think if you can stick it out, if you can survive this, you'll have your friend back.  I wonder how long one should believe this?    My fingers so automatically type "Thomas" because they have every day for two years, that they like the familiarity of the sequence. I loved the familiarity of the friendship. And I want it back. Is this my karma for something else? Do I deserve this?

      I think it's just about done. I don't understand it. But as I am waiting to find out if Thomas is about to go into a real estate deal he doesn't want, or if he's just been swindled out of $10K by a crooked real estate agent, i just discovered something quite by accident (well, the search wasn't by accident, but actually finding something was) that absolutely floored me.  Nancy--Thomas' fiancee, who has told him she has three engagement rings prior--was divorced in Connecticutt in 2001. She was already involved with Thomas at the time.  Back in the days when Thomas used to talk to me, he only spoke of her previous engagements, and his reticence to become a fourth. He never mentioned a previous marraige, even when I asked him. That means he was lying to me back then (for what purpose?) or...he doesn't know.  More likely he does know and didn't want to tell a married woman that he had been involved with a married woman.  Perhaps he even caused the divorce.  That sure answers a lot of questions, doesn't it?  Total openness one day and the angry secrecy the next. Or even now within minutes.  I haven't seen Thomas now for three weeks. In two weeks, I may never see him again. He won't meet with me. And I cannot be president under those circumstances.  And he won't discuss it.  Of course, he is involved in what is sounding more and more like a shady real estate deal right now, which is a lot of pressure, I know, plus his car broke down earlier in the week and he's relying on Nancy for transportation, and he's been positively ghastly to deal with, so now is not the time to bring it up, so I stay silent. But now I know why he is buying the house (if he bought it) under his own name. Because he knows he is marrying a woman who cheated on her husband. Probably separated, though. Because he knows that the relationship is bad to begin with. Because he knows that 90% of all second marraiges fail. My heart aches for him.  It hurts, to lose this friend. It's an ache that won't go away. And now to know the truth--and to keep it silent--but still not know what any of it has to do with me, is agonizing. I know he is no saint. I know what he's done now. But I love him all the same. He rejects my offers of help on one hand and then turns to me for it with the other.   I really love this man, even though he has been nothing but horrible to me for almost six months now. He was wonderful. He earned my love.  Then inexplicably turned against me. With no feeling. With no mercy. Why should I love someone like that?  And worse--now I have to be president of the German School. and work closely with Thomas, which will be quite a trick for someone who won't even speak to me, who is someone who once pretended to love me for reasons that are also unknown to me.  Good God, Thomas. Talk to me. Have some mercy. I am not owed an explanation, but I am worthy of one. I have been a good friend to you. Why are you doing this to me?

      Dear Thomas,  I wonder how you are this morning.  I wonder why you called me twice on Saturday. What did you want? I did not call you back. I didn't want to get upset when I hoped you were calling to ask me to coffee after the teachers' meeting and it would turn out to be some inane question about the school or to ask me what I thought of today's class.  What do you care what I thought of today's class. If you valued my thoughts you would still be my friend.   You know what? I have spent a lot of time lying on my face these past two days, because of a back injury. And it occurred to me in that time, that all you ever needed to do was say six words to me that would have lessened my suffering. "Pam, I'm sorry I hurt you."  But you never did. You never even acknowledged the possibility that you may have hurt me.   And then it occurred to me that you might not even realize that you broke my heart. You will not even allow me ten minutes to talk.  But you continue to send German lessons for free. And you called me twice on Saturday. Why? Do you enjoy repeatedly stabbing me? Either be my friend or leave me alone.   I intend to put a stop to the German lessons. You  will not accept my money and you don't want my friendship, and the last thing I want is to be in debt to a former friend.  I'd rather just pay someone.  Besides, I don't want you to teach me German unless we are also friends. And we are not.  Or rather you are not.  If you have any original thoughts left, Thomas, if you are still even remotely capable of thinking for yourself, please look beyond your own nose for a moment and see that you hurt me.  See that you sent me over 5000 e-mails in the past two years, telling me how much I meant to you, gaining my trust, gaining my husband's trust, and that we both believed you were a true friend to me.  And then you suddenly dropped me without so much as a word of explanation or warning, and then, as if that wasn't painful enough, had to drive the knife in me one more time by telling me it wasn't personal.  Oh, so it was a business decision. You dismissed me like a servant. That's comforting.  Thomas, for God's sake, open your eyes. You broke my heart. You earned my trust and then you abused it. You are capable of doing such things. Other people besides you can have feelings.  I remember how you said, talking about a girlfriend you had, whom you really loved, who left you without explanation or warning, leaving you devastated for years, "No one could know my pain."  Well, Thomas, you're wrong. Someone can.

      Dear Thomas,  Why do I always ask your permission now to do things? Why do I apologize for mentioning that I have injured my back? Why do I ask your permission to talk to you? The answer is simple, and I would tell you, if you'd only let me. So I will tell you here.  Thomas, I have never in my life seen such profound changes to a person in such a short time as I have seen with you over these past few months. These changes have affected me, whether you meant them to or not.  I am simply trying to figure out how or if I fit into your life with these changes in you that have made you almost unrecognizable to me.  Almost, but alas, not enough. You are not a stranger to me, though I wish you were. You seem aware of the changes yourself, but seem either blind or indifferent to the effect they have on the people who love you. I know your mirror does not lie to you about the physical changes in you--surely you cannot have missed the extra fifty or so pounds you've put on.  You are terribly, profoundly unhappy. You are despairing. And my broken heart goes out to you. I can only imagine what your parents are going through.  I know why these changes have happened. It is simple. You are swirling, circling the drain, as the paramedics so charmingly called it. You are in the unenviable position of being madly, passionately and obsessively in love with a woman you cannot make happy. Nothing you do makes her happy. As I wrote before, you have given up everything and everyone you ever cared about, in the logical thought that if you removed any potential causes of fights,the fights would stop, and then she'd be happy. And then you'd be happy. It is a logical thought path, except for the one fatal flaw--it doesn't work. For one thing, no one is responsible for anyone else's happiness, and for another, tying your own happiness into your ability to make someone else happy is a recipe for abject failure. So you are both desperately unhappy. I wouldn't take it personally, Thomas. Nothing you can do will ever make her happy. It's just the way she is, it has nothing whatsoever to do with you. After all, you aren't her fourth fiance for no reason.  If I could, I'd give you advice. I would say, "stop worrying about making her happy. You can't do it and neither can anyone else. Actually, we are all responsible for our own happiness. If marrying her and buying her a house and all that makes YOU happy, then do it. If dropping me as a friend makes YOU happy, do it. But if you give up the things and people you love in order to try to make someone else happy, you will fail, and then you will be even unhappier, because then you will be left with nothing.  So do what makes   yourself   happy, and let her do the same.   But, since you have decided to change the parameters of our friendship without informing me what the new parameters are, you leave me only two choices. The smarter choice would be to tell you to go to Hell, or rather, go home, because it's one and the same.  The idiotic choice is to see where and if I fit into these new parameters.  I am taking the idiot's path.    So I ask questions. Drop sonar. I have learned that it is okay to talk about German school with you. I have learned that it is okay to talk about home buying with you. I have learned that you want to continue to teach me German without pay,(but I think Nancy will one day soon convince you that I am using you.) I have learned that it is not okay to meet in person. It is not okay to even  ask  to meet in person. It is okay to discuss what is going on in my life, but it is not okay to discuss what is going on in yours.  It is okay to send each other some political stuff, but that I should not expect a conversation to arise from it.  I have learned that it is all right for you to put me down as an emergency contact should anything happen to you, but it is not all right for me to ask what I am supposed to do should (God forbid) such an emergency actually occur. This is the new world order, as I see it, from my annoying questions to you about what I can and cannot do now.  Friends do not put such one sided and bizarre restrictions on each other. So the conclusion is obvious. You are not my friend. But the problem is, I am still yours. And will always be. So I take the crumbs. As soon as I know which crumbs I am allowed to pick up. And the only way to find out is to ask. I am an  idiot,  you see. I don't know any better. I choose to put myself through this agony. Just as you choose to put yourself through yours. The difference is, I am choosing to do it because it is all I have left of you, and having you as part of my life once made me very happy. You are choosing to do it because it's all you have left in this horrific relationship of yours--the obsession to make someone else happy.

      What is with me, anyway? I just spent a week in Munich, and came home with a German flu that "wasn't covered" by the American flu shot, that is gripping me with the same ferocity with which Thomas grips me and won't let me go.  Or rather, I can't seem to untangle myself.  Everywhere in Germany that I went, Thomas was there. He was in every sign, every overheard conversation, every cup of coffee, every television show. I couldn't shake him. I wanted to shut out the sound of the German language from my ears, just to give me a break from every sound whispering "Thomas, Thomas, Thomas."  And I know, deep in my heart, that things can never again be the same. Now I know the whole truth. Now I have that missing puzzle piece, my opinion of this man has totally changed. Now I understand him. Now I have my deliverance, of fully understanding what happened.    I understand now.  Once upon a time, Thomas loved an American woman who left him without a word of explanation or warning.  Heartbroken, Thomas shaved off his beard and moved to America and vowed that no one would ever hurt him again. And he's made an art of it: he has repeatedly gotten involved with women who aren't really available to him. Married, separated, obese, career-obsessed.  He's made them close, intimate friends, sometimes more than friends. Then he systematically dropped them without a word of explanation or warning, breaking their hearts...our hearts...before his could be broken again, doing to these women what was once done to him.  One in the series of unavailable women was Nancy. A married woman who must have shocked the hell out of him by suddenly becoming available and moving to California. That wasn't supposed to happen. She was supposed to get dropped with the rest. But she had a secret weapon or two. One, she saw what Thomas did. And she saw that the more these women in his life cried, the more they asked him to come back, the more they tried to understand, the more careless and distant he became.  But if these women told him to go to hell, to get out of their lives, that he was a selfish asshole, he became contrite and sweet and pliant. He begged them to come back.  And so Nancy began to threaten. Weekly. She was moving out. She would fight him. She would threaten to leave, to move back to Connecticutt, and he would give her whatever she wanted.  And plus, she had the goods on him--he was an adulterer. He would cheat with a married woman.    But now Nancy's game is up--she let it be known that she fears divorce above all things, and of course now we know why--because she's a divorcee herself.  So the minute Nancy marries Thomas, he will lose interest in her, because the threat is gone.  That is really sick. The whole situation, my part in it as one of the stupid women who really thought they had a friend, Thomas' intolerable cruelty, Nancy's manipulation...it's horrible. And I just watched him do it to someone else.  One of the women who told him to go to hell was a woman named Melly, who ignored his phone calls and e-mails for close to two years, as he begged her to resume the friendship after he cut her off.  Finally after two years, she broke the silence to tell him that she was getting married. They spoke, and she invited him to her wedding, which is this coming Sunday.  She told him how much it would mean to her if he was there. And of course you know what he did. He refused her.  This is a horrible man, once cruelly treated and now repeating those actions done to him over and over.    I know it can never go back to the way it was, because it never WAS the way it was. I understand it all now. But it seemed so real, and I think it was, I think the feelings were genuine when they happened, but I couldn't see the inevitable coming.  And I miss it so much. It's hard to let go.   On Tuesday he was over, borrowing some car seats I promised him in February, but I was too sick to see him. I could have come out, but I really didn't want to. Instead I watched him through the window slats as he talked to Mark. They look so much alike. Conversing outside his car. Smalltalk. Both with other things on their minds.  And he grips me. From a distance. He is everywhere. He is in the trip I can no longer tell him about, he is in the phone that does not ring, he is in this language that he put in my head, he is in the stories, he is in the truth, he is everywhere. Is there no place I can go that he is not?  Do I want him gone? Or just the pain? The pain of being hurt, the pain of being stupid, the pain of trusting someone who was absolutely not to be trusted?  What do I want now?  I don't know. But as more time passes the less I feel for him and the more I feel for the past. A past that cannot continue into a future.  And I feel empty. Or, really, emptied. From giving love to someone who didn't deserve it.

      I have been overcome with a complete revulsion. The thought that I will see Thomas tonight..in my home..is too much to bear.  He has made his newfound hatred of me apparent, finding fault in everything I say, finding something to get offended about in the most innocuous of statements, purposely withholding any friendliness whatsoever and keeping his mail strictly school related.  I stopped sending him anything at all about what I am up to, because he never acknowledges it, and never says anything at all about himself, even if I ask such top secret, highly invasive questions like, "So when do you get back from Istanbul?"  It is clear, his transformation is complete. He hates me because Nancy hates me, and it is so much easier to let her think for him than to have his own opinion that might be different from hers. And Nancy hates me for no reason at all.  These aren't nice people. I guess I have come to this conclusion. I feel a little sick to my stomach at the realization, because I still have such warm and pleasant memories of a sweet and loving friend, of good conversations, quiet sunsets, and quiet devotion.  And it all evaporated, and only the memories remain.  Now there is this really ugly person left--judgmental, hateful, spiteful..and tonight I have to welcome him into my house, into my HOME, when all I want to do is forget he ever existed, to wipe those memories of two years of happiness.  The sad thing is, I don't hate him back. I don't like him very much right now, and probably will never like him again, but...I love the man. That just doesn't turn off. It would be so much easier if I could loathe and despise him. But I just don't.  Now if I could just figure a way to get him out of my life forever. But that would mean leaving the German School, and leaving a lot of people high and dry. Thomas would not think twice about doing it; in Nancy's Machiavellian thinking, it doesn't matter how much you hurt other people as long as you get what you want. And that's Thomas' philosophy now, too, apparently.  But it isn't mine. I haven't changed a bit. I still hold to my principles, no matter how painful. I don't hate. I don't quit. And I believe that everyone gets what they deserve.  And I know what Thomas will get.  That would bring other people a delicious pleasure, knowing that his retribution is a life with a shrew he himself didn't want, forcibly cut off from having any close friends, bowing to her every will.  But it brings me only deep sadness and no pleasure at all. Schadenfreude is not in my character, I guess.

      Almost a month since my last post. And I am still gripped. I can't get away. Thomas isn't even in my life anymore. He's not the little voice on my shoulder, he's not my gentle companion watching summer sunsets, he's not in my e-mail Inbox, he's not moving in the same circles. Yet there he is. He isn't worth this constant melancholy. My time ran out and he coldly moved on, without care of my feelings, and having none of his own.  I thought we had worked it out about three weeks ago, but Nancy is really putting the squeeze on him. There was a dinner last Saturday we were all supposed to attend, but Nancy decided she didn't want to go, and Thomas was noticibly uncomfortable there alone.  But he goes to things alone all the time.  The reason Nancy didn't go is because I was going to be there. And Nancy has taken off the mask and now openly despises me. She is going to make it really difficult for Thomas to do anything that might involve me. And it is working. Since she finds fault in everything I do or say, there is no hope that that can ever change. And she must complain--because now all of a sudden Thomas is finding fault in everything I do or say, and now it's to the point where we can barely even talk to each other anymore. Now Thomas thinks of me the same way that Nancy does. I have no fight with this woman, I did nothing to her, but she destroyed the friendship by making me not worth the trouble to Thomas.  Does he truly feel nothing? Does he really feel no loss of me?  I feel his loss everywhere. I don't know how I am going to get through the school year, with him at my side as my partner in running the German School. My guess is that he will bolt very early. Maybe this will be merciful.  Even my passion for German is tainted, cooled, and I cannot let that happen. I was interested in German long before I met Thomas. But I am starting to care about it less and less.  In fact, part of my melancholy is in NOT having anything beyond family and job to care about. No goals, no ambition to reach, just day to day living.  I would almost rather fight with Thomas than have him be absent from my life.  But I don't get that choice.  Traveled to Germany last month, am going to Chicago in a week or so for Supercomm. Maybe he is not in Chicago. "Why did I have to meet you, love you, why can't I rid you from my mind?"... Was the two years of real bliss worth these last six months of agony?  At least I have the memories, the e-mails. But I guess the answer is no, it wasn't. And that's really sad.  If you're out there, Thomas, and you read this somehow, (I don't know how you can, unless this somehow turns up in a Google search attached to your name, or my name, somewhere, and right now, you don't turn up there) you have to know that you walked away in disgust from someone who really loved you. Perhaps that was the biggest mistake I ever made in my life, trusting you, loving you. Believing you when you said how important I was to you. I heard your tales of all these lost female friends of yours, all of whom seemed to suddenly become demanding of you after a couple of years and then finally, irrationally, decided to drop your friendship. I knew even then that it was a pattern, that the one common denominator in all these women who suddenly became irrational and demanding was YOU, but I was so arrogant, I thought that I would be different. I was just stupid and naieve, what did I know of men like you, who do such things to people, maybe even not aware of doing it? But I so believed in you, in an improbable but friendship that brought me happiness, I was blinded to the obvious.

      Now this is stupid. This week has been so strange so far. It started with my caterer at V urlLink ienna Bakery  telling me he couldn't understand my secrecy about the event, it's all over the Internet that there is to be  urlLink an acquisition of Force by Motorola.  I told him, "look, it's okay if the Internet tells you, but if I tell you, I'm sharing a jail cell with Martha Stewart!"  Next thing you know I'm buying platters and doilies and balloon arches and renting big platters and samovars and pushing really hard to get checks written (Motorola is on Oracle and Force is on SAP and they don't have compatible cost center numbers, but everyone is really good at passing the buck around here.) This is especially easy since we discovered that at the moment, nobody actually has a boss.  Meanwhile my sister Nancy, who caused so much grief over the years to my family, keeps a blog here too. I follow it once in awhile because it is usually so damned funny. She may be a heartless bitch when it comes to the family (she refuses to meet Jacob, for example, because she "doesn't feel ready to be an Aunt") but she's a good writer. Her entry introduced me to one of the  urlLink funniest websites  I've seen in years, and I was up half the night laughing until I cried. It's not politically correct, but sometimes you just have to have a sense of humor. (Look, I drive a Prius, I recycle, I say "African American" even if I am not totally sure the descendant of African to whom I am referring is actually American or not, I vote Democratic, I was moved to tears by Barak Obama's speech at the Convention on Tuesday night, so how DARE anyone call me politically incorrect because I find the butchering of the English language on foreign-made products hysterically funny. I'm not berating anyone, I just think the end product is funny. And, by the way, while I am on this rant, using a pronoun to describe a group of people is GRAMATICALLY correct, it has nothing to do with POLITICAL correctness. They, they they.)  There, I feel better about that. I guess I'm really stressed about,well, the concept that I have to put on a tremendous party for the people who will probably lay me off when it's done, no matter what a good job I do. It' s a little bit like having to arrange my own funeral because there's nobody in the family competent enough to do it. The weird thing, is, I want to do a really good job. I want to knock their socks off. I want to stand there serenely in a beige suit with a painted silk scarf and have made it look like I can do the equivalent to a wedding for 100 guests in a week all the time. They'll never see my callouses, or, with luck, they'll never see my insomniac stress ravings on my blog, maybe my eye won't twitch. Maybe I should try to get some sleep.

      Insomnia.  It's the middle of the night. That's not even the worst part. I am having a stress and panic attack.&nbsp; I am in the middle of preparing for what is surely the largest and most important event that I am personally in charge of in my life--the events surrounding Force's acquisition by Motorola--and I have this now.&nbsp; Finally someone is giving me oodles of money and telling me, "you don't even work for us yet, but here's a few thousand bucks, go out and create one hell of a rollicking good time for 100 people. You have 48 hours. GO." And unsaid, "we're watching. If you do a good job, maybe you'll get to keep your job. And then again, maybe not."  I feel like I'm on "The Apprentice."&nbsp; You never saw  their  midnight panic attacks.&nbsp; Maybe it was just me.  I've been reading. 3 of the 4 Dan Brown books, even though I realized halfway through the second one that all the books are exactly alike; Nancy Drew for adult conspiracy theorists. So I thought I'd try something more imaginative--I never did read the Harry Potter series, and I thought it was about time.  But the monkey on my back won't go away. Thomas seems almost like a fictional character to me now, someone I just read about in a book, a character that you really thought for most of the book was a really good guy but turned out to be not so wonderful in the end. A character that you read about and think, 'I never would want to meet that guy, he's too dangerous, a potent mixture of sweetness and vulnerability, intellect and drone, selfish bastard and unfeeling cad wrapped in a delicious sugar coat.'&nbsp; But he will soon be back. He will soon be able to hurt me again. I have to somehow cut off that possibility. I have to find the strength within myself not to ever fall into his trap again, to keep hating him and his evil girlfriend/fiancee/wife/whatever, because if I ever stop, he can hurt me really badly.&nbsp; And I think the only way I can do that is to get away from the German school. And there is really no way out.   No wonder I am having a panic attack. I am a mouse in a maze, and I cannot see which path will lead me away from the traps.&nbsp; Do a good job, maybe get laid off anyway. Take the presidency, Thomas can hurt me. Don't take the presidency, I'm no better than he is, a promise-breaker, a committmentphobe, and, worst, an outcast there.&nbsp;   I feel my super burrito from La Pinata sitting on my stomach like a rock.&nbsp; I  so  need advice.

      The original title for this blog, way back in January, was "Rosen Thorns," about the thorns in this Rosen's side.&nbsp; It seems this whole year, now it's more than half over, has been about one particular thorn.&nbsp; I have cried almost every night about it. I have been to therapy about it. I tried to travel away from it. Massage it out of my system. Work it out. Hate it out. But nothing is working, and now I am getting angry.&nbsp; I have always been resilient. I got over losing my sisters, my parents' idiocy, a car accident, becoming president of the German School. I have gotten over losing friends to death, to childbirth (Pam has a kid? Woops, she can't hang out with  us  anymore!) to moving away.&nbsp; But I cannot seem to get over Thomas Loecherbach. I have been taken down by a mild-mannered German engineer who wears short sleeve dress shirts on purpose and actually uses the front pocket.&nbsp;  &nbsp; I try to be philisophical about it. I mean, look, it was bound to happen.&nbsp; I knew it was over that night in the Spanish restaurant.&nbsp; When Nancy showed off her engagement ring, and I thought about how three weeks earlier Thomas was telling me he was coming to the end of his rope and was seriously considering ending it, I knew that someone I loved very much had either just made the biggest mistake of his life, or, someone I loved very much had spent the better part of two years lying to me.&nbsp; Either way, I knew I was no longer of value to Thomas.&nbsp;Or maybe I never was.&nbsp;And to find out about it that way wounded me in a way that is taking a very long time to heal. &nbsp; I wish I could explain all this to him. But you know, what's the point. I keep telling myself, as I repeat these imaginary conversations,  he doesn't care about you. He wouldn't understand anyway. He already hates everything you haven't even said yet, what makes you think he'd listen to you now? Pam, he doesn't care about you.    &nbsp; If I were a different sort of person, I might be vengeful. I might break my promise of secrecy. I might let him know that I know Nancy was married when she got involved with Thomas. Hell, when I think about that now, it's so obvious.&nbsp; But no, no matter how many lies I've been told, no matter what promises have been forgotten, no matter how shabbily he treats someone who genuinely cares for him, I will not betray a trust.&nbsp;  &nbsp; Now I just want this thorn to go away. He's in Istanbul right now and I am still haunted. He's everywhere.&nbsp; In September I am going to have to see him every week. Right now I can work hard and teach myself to hate him, tell myself he's a lying, self-centered adulterer, but as soon as I see him, it melts away. Then I have to work up building those defenses again.&nbsp; I really, really just want the thorn in my side to go away forever, so I never ever have to think about him anymore.&nbsp; I will love him forever. But I just don't want to think about it.

      Well, I  guess  it was a success. I thought everything looked really pretty, and I achieved  my  goals. Whether or not anyone else cared less is debatable.  You know, that's the thing about me--I like feedback. I like to to hear some applause if I do a good job, I like to be criticized if I'm off-base. At least I know where I stand.  On Monday everyone sort of moved like sheep, not really sure if the message was "Welcome to Motorola, you're fired, go eat a Danish" or not.  People really were as glum as the day.  I guess I can't blame them. At least for the week that I was putting the party together,  I was able to push it to the back of my mind that Motorola doesn't really need me much after the end of the month.  Others probably aren't so lucky.  So there was no feedback at all, not a thanks, not a 'good job,' not a 'that really sucked.' Nothing.  But at least I feel in my mind I did a good job, and I have pictures to prove it.  On Wednesday, Thomas called me. You could have knocked me over with a feather. We talked for two and a half hours. (Yeah, Nancy's in Ecuador.) It was our first "normal" conversation in the year 2004, and it almost made me think I have a friend in him again. But then, I can't let myself think that, or I will be setting myself up to be hurt again.  After all, I still don't know if he is married, and I do know that he would not have called me at all if Nancy's watchful eye was not two time zones and three thousand miles away.  I must be wary, I cannot get my hopes up, because they WILL get dashed. I have to work on having no expectations.  I have been interviewing for jobs, just in case. I had one last week, for a place called Immersion Technologies.  Their products were somewhere in the middle of a high wow factor (adding the sense of touch to the computer experience) and a "My God, this is the stupidest thing I ever heard."  To top it off, I instantly hated the hiring manager.  I mean at first glance.  She was this stuck-up, standard-Macy's-career-blouse-issued woman with a turned up nose and permanently pursed lips who never smiled and who kept insisting (without a smile) that her job was to help make the computing experience  fun .  I wanted to ask so desperately, "Okay, so now your phone is on buzz mode, and instead of getting one single buzz when it rings, you get two pulses from someone you know. So now you know who you can't talk to at the moment. This is fun....how?"  When she went into virtual slapping matches and tactile emoticons (a heartbeat pulse for "I love you") I almost ended the interview, but when she asked me if I had a typical German personality, that was it. I would not work there if it was the last place on earth. It has "dotcom" written all over it. It reminded me of interviews in 1999 where everyone kept asking me, "Have you seen our game room?" Which of course translated, in 1999 speak, into "You are never leaving this building."  Thank you, NEXT!
