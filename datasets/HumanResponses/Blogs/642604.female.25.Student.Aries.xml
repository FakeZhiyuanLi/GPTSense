      So I accidentally put up my Snow Day away message and a friend out in California just IMed me to ask how it was possible we were having snow?  I had to explain that I had put up that one by mistake and that it was right next to my I'm out message... but by the time I got the message she had already called her mom to ask her how she was enjoying the snow... I make havok even when I don't mean to...

      Okay, so you know who you are, let me go please!  I am so tired of this run around and you are breaking my heart... I don't know what the fuck else to say?  Why is it that you keep coming back and making these promises that things are going to be different this time, WHAT IS DIFFERENT THIS TIME???  In the end you go back and I stay here and I don't get to have you.  Do you understand you are breaking me?  Do you understand what it's like for me?  I don't even get any time at all to try and get over you and just when I think maybe I can do this all by myself you fucking swoop in again and do this!  LET ME GO!

      And this is Josh... figures...  Timid and attractive, the Rabbits of the Chinese Zodiac tend to act more like bunnies, whether they like it or not! This Sign is extremely popular and has a wide circle of family and friends. Its compassionate nature leads it to be very protective of those it holds dear, but where romance is concerned, the Rabbit's sentimentality can lead it to idealize relationships. The sweet, sensitive Rabbit often ends up giving more of itself to a partner than is realistic or healthy. The good news is, when this Sign goes off-balance, the Rabbit's core group of friends and its stable home life help bring it back to center.  The Rabbit is a rather delicate Sign that needs a solid base in order to thrive. Lacking close, supportive friends and family, the Rabbit might just break down in tears at the first sign of conflict. Emotional upsets in this Sign's life can even lead to physical illnesses. Rabbits dislike arguments and other conflict and will try anything to avoid a fight; this results in something of a pushover nature. Rabbits can also lapse into pessimism and may seem stuck in life -- often to mask their insecure natures. Rabbits tend to move through life's lessons at their own, rather contemplative pace; it's a waste of time to become exasperated with this Sign's seeming disinterest in facing its problems and conquering them.  With the right partner -- meaning someone whose high principles won't allow it to take advantage of this sensitive, giving Sign -- the Rabbit can make an incredibly loving and protective partner or family member. Rabbits love to entertain at home and always make sure their house is comfortable and tastefully-furnished. What Rabbits need most is a stronger sense of self-worth and the security that comes with it. Their discerning natures, coupled with some hard-won assertiveness, will help these happy creatures go far.  The most compatible match for a Rabbit is the Goat or the Pig.

      This is my sign:    Daydreaming all afternoon sounds heavenly to the Goat. This creative, esoteric Sign needs plenty of time alone in which to feed its Muse. Goats are generally most comfortable in their own minds (which other, more linear-thinking Signs may have trouble deciphering). This Sign makes a great craftsperson or artisan, or perhaps a teacher of New Age studies -- any occupation that allows its mind the full range of freedom. Goats tend not to be very well-organized, precluding many more dry business endeavors. In fact, Goats tend not to be very materialistic in general, finding plenty of riches in their own imagination. However, especially when in love, the Goat can be quite a lavish gift-giver.  Perhaps it's that artistic temperament that so often causes Goats to feel insecure, but the result is that these high-strung creatures need to feel loved and admired lest they start worrying incessantly. For this reason, Goats tend to have a hard time with romance; anyone who couples up with a Goat must know, this Sign has a sensitive streak a mile wide and can be subject to bouts of anxiety over seemingly inconsequential things. Goats need plenty of love, support and open reassurance from their lovers. If a relationship is marked by conflict, the Goat will often pull away -- either physically or simply by retreating into the safe haven of its imagination.  If the romance is going well, however, Goats won't hesitate to tell their partner what they need -- and they can be quite insistent about it! This Sign will definitely return the favor, however; the Goat has a luxurious side that delights in indulging a lover's every wish. Appearances are also important to the Goat, which may explain why these folks can spend hours primping and posing.  Goats would be well-served by learning to relax and let others run the show from time to time. Once they can be certain that their friends and lovers won't be gone when the Goat returns from its daydreams, life will be a field of daisies.  The most compatible match for a Goat is the Pig or the Rabbit.

Your heart is really too big for just one person, which is why you often seek comfort in the arms of unsuitable partners.  Since the public eye is impossible to escape, you've turned it to your advantage by trying to make the world a better place."

      So Eric and I were planning on going clubbing last night.  I was all excited about it on Friday night and even when I woke up yesterday morning.  But then I went to this huge flea market with Jess and by the time I met up with Eric to practice for this audition tape at three something I was exhausted and so not looking forward to that night.  I was going back and forth about telling him and finally I mentioned that maybe we could do something that wasn't so expensive or time consuming and I was waiting for him to be all sad about it, but turns out he was trying to think of a way to say something about it to me.  Cracks me up.  So we ended up going to see Pirates of the Carribean... which was so much fun... and when we were leaving we were SOOOO excited about the fact that on a Saturday night we were going to be in bed before three or four a.m.  How retarded are we?   Most people get all excited about going OUT to bars and clubs on a Saturday night and we were so excited to be skipping that.

      So last night was a blast.  I was a bit worried simply for the reason that I was taking out my friend Bret from work with Toni and Ryan.  Now he met and got along with Toni last weekend but they were both plastered out of their minds therefore I had no idea if it would work when we were all sober.  So I picked up Bret, picked up Toni and then we went to get Ryan and thus far all is good.  Then we get to Clarendon Ballroom and there is a line down the block (small block - but still a block) and when we finally get to the door the bouncer teases Bret about being newly 21.  Awww... I love that kid so I felt kind of bad but I don;t think it phased him much.  Anyway, so then we're told that it's gonna take 30 min to even get up on the roof bar so we're kind of bummed out, but we decide to go try anyway.  We get up right away, might have had a little help from Toni showing some cleavage.  So we get up, start drinking and Bret is cracking jokes left and right, we're cracking up.  I think he may now know more about Toni and I then he ever wanted to because when we get drunk we talk about personal things WAAAAYYYY too much!  Anyway, so the female bartender was flirty with me :) and made Toni EXTREMELY jealous :)... sorry Toni but the truth hurts.  Ryan seemed to be having a good time too.  So eventually Toni and Ryan go to find a bathroom and when they came back they decided that we needed to go downstairs because it was cooler inside and because the band at the time they were down there was playing Sublime.  So we go downstairs and they are now in an 80s kick doing covers of Def Leopard and Guns and Roses and they also did a punkish cover of Glory of Love from the Karate Kid.  Toni, Ryan and I were having a blast, not so sure about Bret so then it became the whole "oh my friend isn't having fun" thing and I worried about him for a while.  Finally I was getting tired and we got the hell out of there.  So today I am talking to everyone and I guess Bret had a good time but Toni and I decided he's so damn entertaining that he needs to come out with us again.  Woohoo!  Everyone got along which is the part I was most worried about, therefore I found last night to be a COMPLETE SUCCESS!!!

      So now they are beginning prosecuting those who download music illegally... so does that mean that they are going to hit every single user?  Unreal.  These guys are ridiculous, they need to go back and look at the fact that if they would get rid of the high prices for music maybe we wouldn't download so much.  You know?  Or if I could just buy one song as opposed to a whole cd I don't want it would be cool.  That's one of the reason I think this new iwhatever program (can't remember the name) where you pay a buck a song, it would significantly help the music industry instead of hindering them.  I could go for that.

The guy who just won the Tony award for best actor is an actor in Hairspray... and he's up on stage thanking John Waters for creating such wonderful characters for men to play.... I HATE JOHN WATERS! I HATE EVERYTHING ABOUT HIM! I wonder if this actor has seen a little movie called Pink Flamingos.... if so he would never be saying this... WHATEVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!! [ Sun Jun 08, 09:31:21 PM | Erin Trost | edit ] I hate it when I get sick because I get like ten times more irrational and emotional. It's like last night I wasn't sure I wanted to go out because I was sick and feeling like shit. But I had promised a friend (hereafter known as sad friend) who was upset that I would go out with her so she could get plastered. So when one friend (hereafter known as ex-roommate) calls on Friday who I haven't seen in a while calls me and tells me she wants to go out, I say I can't because I promised sad friend I would go with her. Then my sister wants me to come out clubbing which sounds like fun and I keep thinking I can take sad friend cause she likes that club and she would have a good time and then I could hang with my sister and her friends. Then I talk to my other friend (hereafter known as... fuck it, Eric) on Friday and essentially tell him I am going to this club and I am taking sad friend. So he assumes I am already going and just want him to come along, anyway, he says he will call me Saturday. So finally Saturday rolls around and around seven I decide I do want to go out that night because I am restless despite my nagging cold. So I wait to hear from sad friend. Meanwhile all along I am getting IMs from my sister begging me to come and I keep saying probably but I have to talk to sad friend or Eric first. I am beginning to get nervous around nine because I haven't heard from any of them so after trying Eric once more and after Caitlin calls Eric because she really wants me to come out, I decide to try sad friend. I call sad friend who states that she was going to call me... (WHEN????) and we would go out next weekend. FIRST OF ALL, SHE BEGGED ME TO DO SOMETHING! SECOND I CANCELLED PLANS FOR HER! AND THIRD SHE'S MAKING IT SOUND LIKE SHE'S DOING ME A FAVOR BY RESCHEDULING FOR NEXT WEEK! I just say fine and hang up. So for another hour I wait around and hope someone will call cause in all honesty I don't want to drive to D.C. by myself. I finally retire myself to bed and I am sad for the rest of the night because I was doing someone a favor and got screwed out of a Saturday night because of it. So I wake up this morning feeling even worse than last night, no matter how much I do what I am supposed to this cold is getting worse. And Eric calls, it's like two in the afternoon and I have to be somewhere at five. I decide that it would be better to stay home and after finding out that he went out to the club with another friend of ours without calling me I was a little hurt. So I say I'm not going out with him, hang up and sit for a few minutes. Then I start to realize that fuck it, I do want to go out. So I call him back and he's already turned off his cell phone. I leave him a message. Then I feel even worse cause now I want to get out. I don't hear from him and try him a few more times. Then I call and say I will be done with this thing I have to do tonight around 8 if he wants to meet me for coffee. Then I don't hear from him, and I figured I wouldn't cause he never checks his cell phone. Anyway, so now I am at home feeling bad because I was angry at Eric for no reason and it was just displaced anger from sad friend. I was completely irrational in my sadness and the fact that I spent all day wallowing in my own misery I created. Now that I have had a moment to reflect I think I should be angry at sad friend still, and I am. And I've just called and left Eric yet ANOTHER message on his cell phone to let him know I was sorry for being angry at him even though he had no idea I was angry at him... it was a long rambling message, but I feel better now. And what's worse was if I had just gathered the courage to go out on my own last night I could've met them all there but because I was feeling sorry for myself I screwed myself. On top of it all, once again I made way too much out of nothing. AHHH!!!! There, I feel better.    [ Sun Jun 08, 04:09:32 PM | Erin Trost | edit ] So I was flipping through my magazine and it had a short blurb on the upcoming Young Hollywood Vanity Fair Cover Shoot, which has people like the Olsen Twins, Amanda Bynes, Mandy Moore, etc. Anyway, what I found so humourous about this was that it told that Hillary Duff, who annoys the crap out of me and I've only ever seen her in commercials (imagine what she could do if I saw this show on Disney she's on), brought her boyfriend Aaron Carter (Backstreet Boys' Nick Carter's little brother) to the shoot. And some girl there had recently broken up with him and people were screaming and crying because he was there and then Hillary threw a fit cause he was asked to leave. These three kids involved are aparently only like fifteen years old. OH MY GOD! This just reminded me what rejects we all are at fifteen and on top of that what even bigger rich and famous kids are at fifteen. All I have to say is... I feel for the other girls who had to be there. I bet Mandy Moore was wishing she wasn't a part of young hollywood at the moment.

[ Tue May 20, 01:56:54 PM | Erin Trost | edit ] So anyway, I just saw Bend It Like Beckham this weekend and I absolutely loved it! Everyone should go see this movie. It's a fun movie about this indian girl living in England who wants to play on this girls soccer team. Her parents, being completely rooted in Indian culture, forbid it despite her efforts and despite her talent. She plays anyway, lying to her parents at every turn. She falls for the coach who is played by Jonathan Rhys Meyers, he is great in this character. I've seen him in both Velvet Godmine (EWAN!!!!!!) and The Magnificent (sp?) Ambersons. He's a great actor but I loved him most in this! Anyway, just go see the movie!   Erin

It's likely that you don't want to be told what to eat or how you should spend your POINTS. The more choices you have, the better you're able to stick with it.

Thank god that love triangle fued thing is over.... for now.... [ Sun May 11, 12:51:17 AM | Erin Trost | edit ] So I started Weight Watchers two days ago. And it's not so hard I've noticed except for I've gone over my alloted points both days. Now the first day I had the excuse of the fact that I didn't sign up until after lunch and had already eaten too many points to salvage for the dinner I was eating at mom's house that night. By the way I am doing Weight Watchers Online because I cannot plan my life around meetings and such. So then yesterday I was doing so good, I even had 18 points for dinner which is plenty, I had drank more than my share of water and I snacked on an apple (which I never do cause I'm not a huge fan of apples) so we go to happy hour and I have planned out how many beers I can have but the problem is, when you get drunk everything goes out the window. I didn't drink over my share of beers but there were two shots and then there were appetizers. I only had a little of this and that but when I came home to calculate my points they had skyrocketed through the roof.... oh well.... I start monday with a clean slate of points and then we'll see....

More specifically, Galileo proposed that the earth went around the sun rather than vice versa.   It sounds stupid now to an American with free speech and separated church/state functions, but Galileo had to officially renounce his scientific discoveries under threat of death."   ONE OF MY FAVORITE SONGS COMES TO MIND:  Galileo  Indigo Girls   Galileo's head was on the block  The crime was looking up the truth  And as the bombshells of my daily fears explode  I try to trace them to my youth   And then you had to bring up reincarnation  Over a couple of beers the other night  And now I'm serving time for mistakes  Made by another in another lifetime   How long till my soul gets it right  Can any human being ever reach that kind of light  I call on the resting soul of Galileo  King of night vision  King of insight   And then I think about my fear of motion  Which I never could explain  Some other fool across the ocean years ago  Must have crashed his little airplane   How long till my soul gets it right  Can any human being ever reach that kind of light  I call on the resting soul of Galileo  King of night vision  King of insight   I'm not making a joke  You know me  I take everything so seriously  If we wait for the time till all souls get it right  Then at least I know there'll be no nuclear annihilation  In my lifetime I'm still not right   I offer thanks to those before me  That's all I've got to say  'Cause maybe you squandered big bucks in your lifetime  Now I have to pay  But then again it feels like some sort of inspiration  To let the next life off the hook  But she'll say, "Look what I had to overcome from my last life  I think I'll write a book"   How long till my soul gets it right  Can any human being ever reach the highest light  Except for Galileo god rest his soul  (Except for the resting soul of Galileo)  King of night vision  King of insight  How long  (Til my soul gets it right)  [Til we reach the highest light]  How long  (Til my soul gets it right)  [Til we reach the highest light]  How long

It also displays a warning about downloading pirated music. Another program under development, called "silence," scans a computer's hard drive for pirated music files and attempts to delete them. One of the executives briefed on the silence program said that it did not work properly and was being reworked because it was deleting legitimate music files, too.

"Readers desperate to know what happens to Harry in his latest adventure have already been given some tantalizing clues.   Last December, a private U.S. buyer coughed up 485 dollars a word for a synopsis of the fifth book that Rowling offered for a charity auction in London.   "Thirty-eight chapters ... might change ... longest volume ... Ron ... broom ... sacked ... house-elf ... new teacher ... dies ... sorry," were more than enough to generate vigorous bidding."

It was the longest I've been out yet but I woke up around 2 in the morning and my dog and Leigh's dog were both laying all up against me, protective. Despite my confusion and lack of sense it was so cute. They were worried. But I will tell you I am damn tired this morning... I've had no rest.    [ Thu May 01, 08:58:30 AM | Erin Trost | edit ] Because you have to have an account (even though it's free) to get onto the NY Times Website, I thought this would be easier...   All I have to say to this is AMEN! Damn Republicans. Someone the other day said to me something that I found amusing and true. We were discussing the innerworkings of why I love the gay community so much when I am not actually gay... of course we were drunk at the time so it seemed like the most IMPORTANT conversation in the world and finally this friend turned to me and said (so eloquently with the slurring speech).... the reason I have such strong emotions and rally around the gay community so much is because I must love being a fag hag and without a gay community I can't be a fag hag.... SO TRUE!!!! Anyway, here's the article about an issue that has infuriated me the last few days. How do these people become leaders of our country??? But that's a whole different argument.   G.O.P. Hypocrisy  By DAN SAVAGE    EATTLE — Gay groups are trying to turn Senator Rick Santorum into the next Trent Lott. It's not going to work. Mr. Lott lost his post as Senate majority leader because he said something he wasn't supposed to. Mr. Santorum, who holds the No. 3 position in the Senate leadership, was only repeating what many Republicans have already said.   After telling a reporter that he likes homosexuals just fine — provided we refrain from engaging in homosexual acts — Mr. Santorum came out in support of laws against sodomy. A right to privacy, he said, "doesn't exist in my opinion in the United States Constitution" — for gays, straights, anybody. He then compared homosexuality to bigamy, polygamy, incest and adultery. Too much freedom — allowing gays and lesbians to live openly and without fear of arrest, for example — is "antithetical to strong, healthy families," he said. Homosexuality may not be as bad as "man on child, man on dog, or whatever the case may be," he said, but ——   At this point the reporter broke in. "I'm sorry, I didn't think I was going to talk about `man on dog' with a United States senator," she said. "It's sort of freaking me out."   She wasn't the only one. Gay groups called for Mr. Santorum's head, while antigay groups like the Family Research Council, once headed by Gary Bauer, rushed to defend him. But Mr. Santorum needn't worry about his leadership post. Unlike the former majority leader, Mr. Santorum didn't slip up and say something in plain English that every good Republican knows must only be said in code. Unlike Republican appeals to racist voters, Republican appeals to homophobic voters are overt. During the 2000 campaign, Alan Keyes appeared on the same stage as George Bush and denounced the "radical homosexual agenda" that he said was destroying the American family. Candidate Bush, now President Bush, failed to respond, even though his running mate's daughter is a lesbian.   But gays and lesbians are more than just sons and daughters. We're moms and dads, too. My boyfriend and I adopted a son five years ago, and we plan to adopt again. As more same-sex couples start families, it's going to be harder for Republicans like Mr. Santorum to say we are somehow a threat to the American family.   As much as it may dismay Mr. Santorum and his defenders, there really is no word other than "family" to describe the three people who live in my house. When it comes to marriage rights, gays and lesbians are willing to play semantic games. We will use awkward phrases like "civil union" and "domestic partnership" so long as we can get what our families really need: the rights, responsibilities and safeguards of legal marriage. But two adults who love each other and are raising children together? What are we if not a family? What other word is there for us?   In our culture, homosexuality is discussed only when it presents a problem — for the armed forces, for closeted gay students in high school, for those who imagine gays are undermining society. Rarely is homosexuality credited with the creation of something positive and lasting. Desire brought my boyfriend and me together. And it's simple desire that brings most couples, gay or straight, together. Responsibly acted on, this desire is a good thing in and of itself, and it can often lead to other good things. Like strong, healthy families.    Dan Savage is editor of The Stranger, a weekly newspaper.

      Posts from Monday, February 24, 2003: [ Mon Feb 24, 02:27:13 PM | Erin Trost | edit ] And here is the piece that Erin thought would be fun to analyze: Carmen's Prelude [ Mon Feb 24, 10:58:02 AM | Erin Trost | edit ] Hi Erin,  I was glad to see that Nora Jones, won all those Grammy's. I thought of you and how much you like that song. What did you think?  JoAnn   My response:  Oddly enough my heart wasn't in the grammys. I didn't watch them. I did, however, go back and take a look at all the winners. I was thrilled Norah won for everything, sad that Dave Matthews lost to No Doubt and thrilled that Eminem won another grammy, I love it when he wins cause I feel like these people who claim that he is nothing but trash have to stand up and say that musically he is an amazing talent, whether you actually listen to him or not is a different story. It gives me hope that these people who are running the music industry out there are trying not to be biased just because they don't like a certain artist's views or type of music. The funny part is, off of Norah's album, the song that she kept winning for is my least favorite off of it, but I was glad that her album kept winning, it's so good. I had the chance to see her this past summer and she was just captivating...   Erin   [ Mon Feb 24, 10:31:28 AM | Erin Trost | edit ] I love this song. I think maybe because it's not often you don't hear things from this perspective:   Breakable  Fisher   Do you always have to tell him  everything on your mind?  You know that too much  honesty can be so unkind.   Everytime you throw him to the floor,  Why are you surprised to see  He´s breakable?   You always try to find  what´s holding him away from you.  But do you ever see your anger  standing there right between you?   And everytime you throw him to the wall,  Why are you surprised to see  He´s breakable?   Tell the world that he´s breaking your heart.  Go tell the world,  nothing´s ever your fault.  Go tell them all....   And every time you throw him to the floor,  Why are you surprised to see  He´s breakable?  And every time you push him to the wall,  Why are you surprised to see  He´s breakable?   Breakable... breakable....    [ Mon Feb 24, 09:56:14 AM | Erin Trost | edit ] So I officially applied for college again... now comes the anxiety... I applied for Spring semester of 2004 and so I have no idea how long it will actually be before I hear but I must admit that suddenly what I was confident about without a doubt has completely changed to a underlying fear that something will go wrong and I won't get in. I hate this part.

FINALLY! I swear I keep watching because every once in a while the show catches my interest again but I cannot wait till its over! Finally I can give up watching a show I watch mostly out of tradition... now if only Friends will take the hint... OH AND Buffy is probably over after this year because Sarah Michelle Gellar doesn't want to resign. Now that will make me sad. I still love that show to this day... Angel better get better because it's the only substitute I've got... how sad is it that I am totally addicted to teen television? Damn my sister. If it hadn't been for her wanting me to tape that Dawson's Creek premiere back when it first began I wouldn't have gotten into that or Buffy which happened to come on right before... NOW LOOK WHAT HAPPENED!

      Posts from Saturday, February 01, 2003: [ Sat Feb 01, 10:37:49 PM | Erin Trost | edit ] So my car is in the shop and I have been trying master the stick shift ever since. I think I finally have it but yesterday, Friday, was scary because I took the very first turn I have to make after leaving my house too fast and I spun out. I came within 4 feet of hitting another car, which doesn't seem like that big a deal, but it is when you're spinning and spinning and you just see this parked car coming closer and closer and all you can think is PLEASE don't let me get in another accident, especially in someone else's car. But after that I was good to go. AND the day before that I got run off the road by some bitch in a van! So tonight, after tenative plans fell through because of Toni getting sick, I had to go to 7-11 to pick up cigarettes and I decided it would be a really good idea to just keep driving... so I drove for like 90 minutes or so... and I have successfully improved on first gear. As much as I would love to say that I mastered it, I have not. I still squeal or stall sometimes but not nearly as much as I have in the past. I am quite proud of this achievement, even if you are not! So what else has happened lately??? Um, I just scored a ticket to Mam Mia in NYC when I go on my trip in March. I am very excited, now all I want to do is go see Mama Mia and I will be very happy. We'll see how well that goes. Oh but now Friday is on and I have lost my concetration on whatever I was writing anyway. [ Sat Feb 01, 10:26:03 PM | Erin Trost | edit ] RESPECT MY AUTHOR-I-TIE!

      Posts from Wednesday, January 22, 2003: [ Thu Jan 23, 12:03:37 AM | Erin Trost | edit ] It just amazes me how things seem to all hit at once, I had my issues with Bank of America which resulted in me having to close my checking account with them because I was fed up, I got really friggin sick and on top of it all I got in a car accident which will result in me charging at least 250 dollars (my deductible) on my credit card... could life please hit me with something else? All I can say is thank god for Bill Walsh... don't know what I would do without him :) This week has gone SO MUCH BETTER than last, except for that whole sleeping in too late thing yesterday, but I have already been forgiven of that... thank god. All I need now to make this week perfect is for a massive snow storm to hit tomorrow, resulting in NO WORK on Friday... but we all know that I was lucky to have gotten one day called off earlier this winter, guess I can't ask for much more. RIght? Oh well. By the way, I hear they are cracking down on music file sharing again... BIG SHOCKER!!! So for those of you out there... beware! By the way, just bought the highlights from the new cast of La Boheme on Broadway... they all rock... Go check it out! But I am warning you, it's all Italian and it's all opera... Here's the link: Baz Luhrman's La Boheme Well time to go hang out with the roommate...

      [ Mon Jan 06, 02:43:59 PM | Erin Trost | edit ] So.... I WENT TO SEE PHISH at Hampton this past weekend. I wish I could've afforded each night but unfortunately I only had tickets for Friday night. It was all good though, they were right on and I had the best time. The trip came complete with no traffic to Hampton, a hotel room right across the bridge (not as close as I wanted to be but for as late as I made the reservation... excellent), a truck outside the hotel with a giant lobster on top, a cheesy merman triton kind of statue by the hotel sign, a beautiful view of the bay and the aircraft carriers and more phish fans than the eye could see. How much better could it get? I had a blast, i loved it! They opened with Tweezer, they ended with Tweezer, they closed the second set with an incredible version of Possum, it was just so good! I'm psyched and ready to go again, bring it on!

As usual, just click on my results to go get your own! By the way, I cannot stand West Side Story, but since it's based on Romeo and Juliet and I love that story, I guess I can handle the results...

First off, there are so many people I still need to get gifts for... there are so many bills and medical bills I am trying to handle.... and on top of it I got a Christmas bonus and still I am completely in the hole! What can you do... but I hate looking at my bank account, it just makes me sad right now.

      Posts from Monday, December 02, 2002: [ Mon Dec 02, 04:38:58 PM | Erin Trost | edit ] Yesterday was World AIDS day. No wonder they played 'And The Band Played On' like a million times yesterday. I watched it once... I had forgotten. If you ever want to see me cry myself into ridiculous dry heaves put on that or the Laramie Project. Both movies break my heart and you have never seen me break down like I do when I think of all the bullshit that goes on that I just don't understand. I want to know for christ's sake how people can be so goddamn ignorant and cruel and I just don't understand how people can turn away from other people just because of who or what they are. Human Rights geared toward Gay and Lesbian rights, as many of you know, is my thing. Everyone has a thing that they are passionate about. My old roommate's was Feminism, my best friend's is Racism and mine is Human Rights. I have never understood how just because someone is gay they are looked upon differently, if they had done something to you personally, assaulted you or what not, fine.... but to just hate someone because of what gender they choose to be with? Bullshit! I have many gay friends and they are no different from any of my straight friends... I don't understand why people see it as being different at all. It pisses me off to no END! Okay now I am seriously working myself up into a frenzy. OH! And I was told the other day, since I can't give blood I wasn't aware of this, if you have had sex with a same-sex partner you CANNOT give blood. Okay, maybe back in the 80s when we were just learning about AIDS and what not, I could forgive this, but not now! Not today! Not when just as many straight people in the world have AIDS or are HIV positive as the gay population. So basically that means that if I could give blood and hadn't had an AIDS test in a long while and probably know less about the quality of my blood cells that just because I am straight I could give blood over my friends who have quality blood, who have been tested recently, who are in MUCH BETTER HEALTH than I because they are gay. BULLSHIT! Glad the Red Cross or whatever who just a few months back and still might be starving for blood are so anxious to turn things around. COME ON PEOPLE! Unreal. Whatever, I am done ranting now... I need a cigarette to calm myself down.... [ Mon Dec 02, 04:12:01 PM | Erin Trost | edit ] Sometimes I think it seems as if I only call on my friends when I am moving... and maybe I do... but it's just because I SEEM TO BE MOVING ALL THE GODDAMN TIME!!!!!!!! Hey, but on the upside, I just found out that everyone gets a pay raise for the new year and the lowest percentage you can get and this is if you suck HUGE is 10%! NO ONE GIVES THAT MUCH AS THE LOWEST!!! AND my Christmas bonus... that's right folks, you heard me right... standard christmas bonus... is going to be at least a week's pay... I LOVE MY JOB!!! Plus I got to terminate two people today... well at least I was involved... making the world a much better place for borrowers :) I am like Superman... or woman or whatever... I'M JUST COOL! NEVER FEAR, ERIN IS HERE! Okay so now I am acting retarded but it is merely off of the high of MORE MONEY FOR ME!!! And my boss and owner is so cool, I love him. I love my job! Okay, done now... perhaps I will post one of my more cynical statements later.

[ Tue Nov 26, 04:16:53 PM | Erin Trost | edit ] A friend of mine just called me to see what his friend could do to ensure he passed a drug test. I find this funny. Sadly due to people who have floated in and out of my life I knew exactly what to tell him... but the thing I told him that was the most important - GO TALK TO THE PEOPLE AT GNC, they know what they are talking about and most of their business comes from people trying to pass drug tests... but the one thing I can guarantee you all, if it's a hair test... there is no getting around it, so don't even try. [ Tue Nov 26, 03:46:35 PM | Erin Trost | edit ] Well so it has been sooo friggin long since I have posted. I don't even know where to begin. I went to NYC two weekends ago and trudged around in the rain for hours on end but I loved it! I miss it so much! I WILL, mark my words, move back there either to go to college or right after college. I need to be there, I feed off of the place. I just finished reading through Caryn's blog. That girl cracks me up! I love her! I had honestly forgotten what a cool person she was until starting up bells with her again this year. Reading through her blog inspired me to take a break from my new job and write whats going on. I missed blogging. I have been so busy though. I kept trying to blog a while back when i first started my new job to let you all know how much I love it but unfortunately I just couldn't seem to get the thing to work... uh oh... one of the state pages is about to cause my whole Internet Explorer to shut down... I'll be back in a minute  [ Tue Nov 26, 03:38:56 PM | Erin Trost | edit ] Hi

The bitch is in the office and giving me the runaround ON MY LAST FRICKIN WEEK! As if I have any clue as to what the other people in charge of shows I DON'T WORK ON are doing... COME ON! Now I have to investigate all this crap that I have no clue about and people are tired of answering my redundant questions because they are all like can't this wait till next week when the others are back? Well one would think so since those shows are far off. But no, the woman who is in the damn office for a total of five hours a week and has NO FUCKING CLUE as to what goes on in this office feels the need to stick her nose in and tell us all what to do. I AM SO GLAD THIS IS MY LAST WEEK!

I guess they are in trouble for not making enough phone calls and I shouldn't go over and talk to them. But it's all good. I understand, I have just never had anyone tell me I was being a distraction at work. They didn't seem to mind either, but now I must leave them to their sales corner to do their work. :)

At first I thought it was slow and not all that great but by the end I adored it. It reminded me a great deal about how Wendi and I are. Kind of the whole different paths thing but whenever wherever needed we would be there. I love the fact that I have a friend like that. She is my family and I adored this movie for the simple fact that, well except for the sleeping with rock stars, we're just the same. Every group of girlfriends should see this movie. [ Wed Oct 02, 10:32:39 AM | Erin Trost | edit ] Possession   So I had a chance to watch Possession (Gwenyth Paltrow and Aaron Eckhardt). It was good and I liked it but it wasn't all it was cracked up to be. It was a story about a romance that happens between two people as they track down clues on a romance between two very dead poets. It's interesting and I think it moves very well, I guess what I found so freakishly annoying is that the romance between the current day people is really nothing but a vessel to weave the story of the passionate romance these two lovers shared. Anyway, it's a good video flick.

      Posts from Tuesday, October 01, 2002: [ Tue Oct 01, 04:34:26 PM | Erin Trost | edit ] FREAKS!!!   Okay, so I love anything to do with movies, music and television. It is hard for me to find something out there I don't like and maybe that's why I get so pissed off so easily at people who are so damn critical of the mediums. But anyway, so I am sitting there reading through the various boards of the television shows at Television Without Pity. I am a lurker, I never post because I just don't care THAT much, so I am doing my normal lurker thing. My latest obsession is QAF so I am paying particular attention to those boards. So I read through the spoiler thread about how season 3 will kick off in like March... so long... DAMN SHOWTIME TO HELL!!! But anyway and then I jump over to the spoiler discussion thread to see what people are saying... HOLY MARY MOTHER OF GOD! There are some really angry people out there, I cannot get over how terribly upset they are over one little tidbit of information. I guess I would agree with them that the first season was the best and the second season, unfortunately, declined in comparison. I would also agree with them when they say that the writers (CowLip) are not surrounding themselves with honest people if they believe their show is only getting better. But Jesus CHRIST! There are some really angry people out there. Fortunately I find them good for a laugh but I just cannot believe how angry and stressed some of these people are. They sit there and berate the show, the writers and then berate each other if they have a difference of opinion with the majority of the posters. It is entertaining to read through. Someone on the board came up with the word "asstacular" and suddenly I was reading post after post about how brilliant this guy is. Now I have to admit normally I read through this guy's posts and he is quite smart, you can just tell with how he weaves dialogue but for him to be praised over and over for coming up with a juvenile word like "asstacular" just makes the whole experience all the more amusing! There are people over on those boards claiming to cancel Showtime and some are throwing out how much they hate the show and have hated it since the end of the first season... okay, well fine. So hate it. So that's fine. I don't care... but if you hate it so much, why are you still watching it and why haven't you cancelled showtime? I just find it all humorous! :) [ Tue Oct 01, 02:26:13 PM | Erin Trost | edit ] I fuckin hate some of the arrogant asshole sales guys here... CANNOT WAIT TO LEAVE!!!

[ Tue Oct 01, 11:46:54 AM | Erin Trost | edit ] Wedding Story (cont.)   So anyway, we go to the reception and get seated at this table with these fun people. We meet Bill and this guy we called the preacher and Bill's date (can't remember her name). At first Beth and Bill seem to be chatting it up and hitting it off (the guy showed us where he got bit by a shark - it was a real bonding moment) and the next thing we know Liz is bored with talking to the preacher guy cause he's all boring as hell. So we all eat and then the bar inside FINALLY opens up and the bartenders (who didn't have Malibu rum outside when Beth asked for it) had picked up a bottle of Malibu just for her. We walked in and they remembered us right away and had the bottle ready for her. We finally made it out on the dance floor, after singing into our spoons and harmonizing on Shania's From This Moment. We actually harmonize quite well together, especially when spoons are involved :). So we're out dancing and Bill comes out to join us and the next thing we know Liz has monopolized Bill completely. Beth and I just have to laugh, it always goes this way! So after seeing Marshall time and time again and having a blast on the dance floor I am exhausted and we completely lost Liz to Bill, Beth and I decide we are not going to go out afterwards as planned but go back to the hotel instead. Liz on the other hand decides to go out. So when At Last comes on, I get all depressed, I just can;t hear it at weddings without getting sad for whatever reason, but I don't want to be depressed so I excuse myself to go have a cigarette. Beth comes out to join me after the song is over and we head home. We get the sweetest cab driver... so sweet. He opens our doors and talks with us the whole five minutes back to the hotel. Nice older gentleman. We get back to the hotel and change immediately. I am all psyched because Beth wanted to see QAF, but unfortunately we only got the one showtime channel so she couldn't see it. Too bad. It's such a damn good show. So we start out watching SNL and then decide to retire to our beds and then watch Trading Spaces and the next thing I know the girl is asleep and I am fading fast. WE ARE SUCH PARTY ANIMALS! Next thing I know, it's morning, breakfast arrives, Liz is home and we all veg for a while. We drive home, no traffic and get back in two hours. It was a blast and the trip was so much fun! But I have to say, unless I have another engagement like a wedding, I am not going back to DE anytime soon. :) But congrats to Marshall and Karin. Couldn't have happened to two nicer people.   :)  Erin [ Tue Oct 01, 10:25:58 AM | Erin Trost | edit ] What am I listening to?   Today I am listening to the vocal stylings of Maren Ord. LOVE HER! She has great songs and I can't get enough right now. I highly reccomend her to anyone who wants a nice ballad sound. She's great for work and her songs are just beautiful. She's contemporary and would fall under the category of pop, although she;s NOTHING like Britney Spears. Go check her out and give her stuff a listen.   Erin

      Posts from Monday, September 30, 2002: [ Mon Sep 30, 04:47:58 PM | Erin Trost | edit ] The Wedding Trip  So get up early Saturday, my cable modem is down, can't get the directions to Liz's sister in law's house, can't get the directions to the hotel... pissed off! So jump in the shower, call Cox and find out there is an outage and there is nothing to be done, pack, call Beth to make sure her modem is working... get her cell phone voice mail, leave message. Drive to Hallmark. Liz calls, can't find invitation and her cat has gotten out so she might be a little late. Beth calls, I can get online at her house! Go to starbucks. Meet nice lady and discuss the benefits of Soy Milk. Get in the car. Drive to Beths. FINALLY find directions and also get directions to hotel. Go to Liz's sister in law's and pick her up. All is good till we are well into Maryland and realize, no one has the invitation, no one knows what the church's name is and certainly no one knows their way around Wilmington. So call Toni and aparently now the Gods are smiling down on me because Toni finds the invitation and gives us all the info we need. We get to hotel and cannot check in so we walk around and find out that NOTHING is open on Saturdays and NO ONE lives in Wilmington on the weekends. Dead city. Would never recommend Wilmington, DE to anyone... Wilmington NC on the other hand is a whole different story. So FINALLY find a sub place and have the BEST subs but are full and then walk back to hotel. We check in. Order wine. Start drinking and getting ready. Go walk to wedding. Liz and I are both wearing shoes that hurt after about fifteen minutes, fortunately the church is only three blocks from hotel. Wedding is LONG and church is not airconditioned. Even though the weather is beautiful outside, inside it is hot AS HELL! Anyway, wedding is GORGEOUS! Marshall gives all three of us a big hug when we walk in. We are so excited for him! We go to our seats and run into same girl we ran into earlier in elevator after checking in and again in coming back down to lobby with her boyfriend. Paula and Kent. We sit through long ass boring (no offense) wedding and then go back to hotel. We drink more wine and kick up our feet. Then decide we should go to reception. Wait for hotel driver who takes us to beautiful manor style house for reception... OH TIME TO GO HOME... Will finish the story later.  [ Mon Sep 30, 04:38:51 PM | Erin Trost | edit ] Thursday and Friday  So Thursday... what happened on Thursday? Um, Thursday I FINALLY booked a hotel room for PHISH. All hotels are booked, took me all morning... I think nothing really happened this day... and Friday was pretty much the same. I hung out with Toni all night watching television and QAF. Did nothing spectacular. Had fun though.  [ Mon Sep 30, 04:29:50 PM | Erin Trost | edit ] Wednesday   Well back to the week... So Wednesday rolls around and hello, boring as hell day... the slow turtle like time left at old job begins. DAMMIT! But whatever. So get through the day, nothing eventful happens. Finish up work, get ready for class. Go to class and Leigh calls me on the way, asking me when exactly I was going to tell him that we GOT PHISH TICKETS!!! AHHHHHHHH!!! WE GOT THEM!!! Aparently the time the server timed out it just didn't show me the screen but the SALE WENT THROUGH! We got Phish tickets! I was yelling into the phone I think. I was on a high. I called my dad and was all excited, that's when he told me he was just going to get them for me for Christmas anyway! So nice! But it's all good cause now he doesn't have to spend so much money! It takes everything to get through class and afterwards I go meet up with Leigh and Kelly. WE WILL GET KELLY A TICKET! SHE IS GOING WITH US! But LEIGH AND I HAVE TICKETS! So yay! Anyway, so I hang out for a while and then head home. Of course I walk in the door and find someone (who's name I will not mention) in a comprimising position on the couch with a guy... nothing X rated, not even R, maybe PG13... but always an annoying and awkward moment for me when this happens. So these two "people" are coming up with lame ass excuses as to why they are in this position and I, not really thinking say 'hey "guy" don't worry about it, this is nothing' or something along those lines. That's all I was gonna say but aparently "said girl" thought I was going to say more and SNAPPED at me. I laughed. So then I go into my room and change cause I am frickin tired! And I get ready for bed and the next thing I know "said girl" comes into my room asking for a cigarette. She's all hyperactive on speed (not REALLY!) just on a natural high and I am all tired! Too funny. [ Mon Sep 30, 04:15:43 PM | Erin Trost | edit ] So Saturday Night...  So Saturday night, after NOT getting Phish tickets... (this is still 9/21) I meet up with Eric around 10 PM at Borders and head out to Nation. Dressed in red (after all it was the Red Party). Since it's a gay club I highly expected to be around gay men all night, what I didn't expect was to be one of like 9 women. And it was fairly obvious by the way they were probably all straight girls there with their gay male friends, same situation I was in. We had the best time. Got drunk, danced, had a blast! What really shocked me were the straight guys who would come up and just totally invade your space. Oddly enough I didn't mind when the gay guys did it, maybe cause I wasn't threatened, but when the straight guys came up I almost felt annoyed! It was way funny! We had THE BEST TIME! But we didn't get out of there until around 3 am and by the time we got home it was LATE! So I crawl into bed and decide to NOT set the alarm because I know I'll be up by 1pm at the latest! WRONG! WRONG! WRONG! So the next day I roll over and decide I should probably get up because it is probably around 1 in the afternoon... UM NO! 5PM! What the hell! I jump out of bed, realized I wasted the ENTIRE day and freak out because now I have to try and go back to sleep in like six hours. NOT GONNA HAPPEN! So I watch Charmed since I am staying away from the Emmys. Not all that great, pretty bored, finally go to bed and CANNOT SLEEP! So I pull out QAF and start watching it and try very hard to sleep again. NOTHING! Needless to say the next day I was drinking caffeine all day! Which leads you right back to Monday.... [ Mon Sep 30, 04:05:45 PM | Erin Trost | edit ] Back Track  I completely forgot about the weekend before (9/20,21,22)! So Friday rolls around and I am feeling really good and I go home and Toni is getting ready for her date. So I agree to watch the dog and hang out at home. I had a big night the next night and I wasn't too excited about the idea of going out two nights in a row. So I curl up on the couch with some DVDs, Panic Room, Kissing Jessica Stein, Death to Smoochie, etc. I am doing fine, loving spending the time alone... until a certain someone calls. I think all of you know who that FRICKIN certain someone is. So we talk for a while about virtually nothing and when we hang up I am all depressed over talking to him and so what do I do? Grab the Gin and pull out Bridget Jones. Everything seems to be getting better, I am drunk after 6 straight up shots of Gin and the movie is making me feel better about life... only I forgot one thing... at the end of the movie HER GUY MOVES BACK FOR HER! Whatever... needed more Gin. But eventually I went to bed because I needed it and because I had to get up early to get PHISH tickets! So... Saturday morning rolls around (Toni didn't come home so Erin got up early to walk the dog) and then stayed up to get the tickets. At 10 on the dot, I get up and start calling ticket master and getting on the website. Well I think I finally get through on the website and come to find out that the server timed out... no biggie, there are three shows and I still have plenty of time. WRONG! I finally get through on the phone and they have me on hold for 15 minutes before they tell me it's the wrong phone number and I need to call a completely DIFFERENT number. BASTARDS! So I get on and start calling them. Finally get through again online and come to find out that all tickets are sold out. I decide to continue trying on the phone because maybe there is a hope in hell that I can get them still. So after the "line is busy" line over and over agian I give up around 11:30 p.m. (1 hour and 30 min after I started). So I try Cheap Seats or Event USA or whatever it's called... tickets are starting at $600. So then I go on ebay... again, starting around $500-$600. So I give up. I'm not going to Phish. I am sad and since I have been put in charge I have let numerous people down.... [ Mon Sep 30, 12:23:50 PM | Erin Trost | edit ] Tuesday 9/24/02  Tuesday, I wake up... get stuck in traffic... late to work... again... call JoAnn to let her know I am going to be late... we discuss how traffic sucks and that I am eternally late to that office even if I were to leave like four hours before I had to be at work SOMETHING would stop me from getting there on time! I happen to mention (as a side remark) that maybe I won't be working there much longer. I don't truly mean it because again I have put no stock in the fact that I might actually get a new job. She and I laugh. So then I get in... FINALLY!... and get an IM from Jess saying I've got the job! No interview, no resume, she is just hiring me! So right away I yell scream and dance with joy before handing in my official two weeks! YAY!!! So all of this goes down and then I head to the Cardiologist... And YAY! They fit me with a heart event monitor... for CHRIST'S SAKE! It has got to be THE most annoying thing I have ever had! So I wear it and whatever but I have to continue to wear it for the next 30 days! WHAT FRICKIN LUCK! [ Mon Sep 30, 12:18:18 PM | Erin Trost | edit ] Monday 9/23/02  Monday I get a cryptic IM from Jess saying that I absolutely need to call her when I get home that night... well what is my first thought? Some major crisis going down. I am all panicky cause it's only around 2 in the PM and I am stuck waiting till 7 to make sure that she is okay. So I get home, call... no answer... more panicking.... then she IMs me to tell me to call her in 10 min. So I do. No crisis, but she may have a possible job for me... but I don;'t get my hopes up because I am never getting the hell out of CMG. Right? And besides things like this don't just fall into my lap....

She's got a low sultry voice that can sing a soft jazz song like no one else. If you don't check her out you'll have no idea what you are missing.

No wonder I have been pissed off when I go to bars all the time. :) So that is why the bands can get away will calling themselves things like the "Dave Matthews Cover Band"... it's all coming together now... the wheels are turning!

I dig this album but I have to admit my favorite Ben Harper album is Fight For Your Mind! That cd will probably always be my favorite, with my all time favorite Ben Harper song Opression! I think you can hear it on his website if you click the link. I love Ben Harper and the Innocent Criminals. The biggest treat in seeing him was a couple years back (3 maybe?) when Ben opened for DMB at RFK and then returned to the stage during Watchtower (the encore.) It was probably the best version I had ever heard... as Dave Matthews is now highly aware of :) Go check them out though, they are definitely worth a listen.

Although I can't ask for much because they did an unbelievable version of Bartender and a full band Dancing Nancies directly into Warehouse. I was going nuts! And with whatever condition I have now, I wasted all my energy on Dancing Nancies and Warehouse. After that was over I had nothing left in me but it's Dave so I kept standing and kept going, but I will be honest, I felt like I wanted to collapse the entire last half of the show. I am so weak it's killing me. But I didn't want Jen to know that I wasn't having the best time so I tried to keep a smile plastered on my face when really all I wanted to do was crawl in bed. And because I have no emotional stability I found this sad enough to cry over but fortunately held back the tears till I had dropped everyone off. And this was rather difficult since we had to sit in the parkinglot without moving an inch... literally... no one moved AT ALL by the time we even found my car... which was a whole 30 minute ordeal anyway complete with some guy yelling out to Jen that she had a nice ass. Let me tell you boy, even though I know you'll never read this, you had no effect on her at all in fact I think she found you slightly repulsive so I would try a whole different approach if I were you. But once I was alone I broke down into tears out of pure exhaustion and frustration for being so exhausted on a night I wanted to forget that I am sick and have so much energy. Even now I tear up just thinking about how badly I wanted to enjoy last night like I have past shows and the only reason I couldn't fully do so was because I felt like I was dying. I am such a reject. Oh and now Toni has walked in the door loud as shit and I am not angry at her but I feel like shit right now and she's so loud and I have no right to go tell her to shut up because it's 11 in the morning and none of this is her fault. But anyway, back to the end of the show. What you are was the closer and it rocked! Awesome! It was fantastic! Some didn't like it but I really loved the intro to this, sort of an India feel if you ask me. But whatever. Anyway, so I have to go take the stereo away from Toni now so I can make this cds for my friend at work. Cheers.

It appears that this will be the finale to a great summer of Dave shows. Of course I still have more concerts to look forward to this year because I never stop! I think I still have Blues Traveler with DC Sessions (free concerts always rock!), I have John Mayer coming up sometime in the next couple of months at Constitution Hall and of course I am constantly checking all the local venues and my favorite little band websites to see who is coming when and where. Just can't get enough music. I am a friggin addict! I have spent all morning now scouring the Walther Productions Page just hoping for a glimpse of Deep Banana Blackout or The Recipe! I am going crazy not having my fall concert schedule not planned out yet! But to get my Jam Band fix... OH DEEP BANANA BLACKOUT JUST CAME ON! Way too coincidental for me!... I am listening to the Jam Band Radio which I connect to through jambands.com. For those who like Moe., Deep Banana Blackout, Phish, Gov't Mule, etc. this is definitely for you! So while I figure out what other concerts I can head off to this year I will still be enjoying those I still have booked... LIKE TONIGHT!

So I just talked to my boss about possibly moving into the meeting planning side of things since the meeting planner for our company is leaving in two weeks to go to another job. He gave me the whole "well... it seems like a good idea... but...." speech. So basically I got my answer. He won't do it. Whenever he does that kind of thing it means he won't do it. So if my position now is where he wants to keep me it is definitely time to move onward! I thought I might be able to move more within the company to the position I have wanted since I started here but in the end it doesn't appear to be going that way at all. Too bad.

I thought this moment would never come today! [ Tue Jul 23, 03:19:24 PM | Erin Trost | edit ] The Smoothie King   So recently, and I blame my mother entirely for this, I was introduced to the Smoothie King. It's located right next door to Quiznos and Starbucks in the new part of the Main Street Shopping center in Fairfax. So I have a limited run for lunch today, one hour. I got stuff to do at the office so I try to make it as quick as possible. So I run all the way out to Centreville to a store I need to go to and then I come back through to Fairfax City. Well the trip from Merrifield to Centreville and into Fairfax took 30 min total, which is really good. So everything seems to be going well. I should probably just go back to Merrifield but I am craving a Smoothie. So I walk in and notice it's kind of busy but I think I've got 30 minutes and it will only take 10 to get back to the office... so I place my order and think I have just enough time to run next door to Quiznos and get a small smoked turkey (my favorite)! So I do! I come back in and look around to notice that the line has hardly changed. The same people that were in the front when I left to get my sandwich are still in the front waiting. 30 MINUTES LATER I finally get my drink and have to speed race it back to Merrifield. But all is well i think, I sit down, start eating my sandwich and then take a nice long sip of my Angel Food Smoothie... IT'S GRAINY! I've gotten this thing so many times in the past and it's always had seeds and such but it's never been grainy! I waited 30 minutes for a grainy smoothie! But in all fairness the girl did give me a punch card which none of the other employees have ever done when I've been in there. I liked her, but I am still angry at how long it took and how it just wasn;t good at all! They better not make a habbit of the graininess or they might just lose me as a customer! (As if that is any kind of threat!)  [ Tue Jul 23, 03:11:38 PM | Erin Trost | edit ] Odd Todd Musing   Odd Todd wrote to the fishstick company! Oh it cracks me up!   Fish Stick Story and reply!    [ Tue Jul 23, 12:14:04 PM | Erin Trost | edit ] New Idea!!!   Since my last post was all weird I decided to tell everyone as often as possible what is in my cd player (or on my spinner -- Spinner!!!) and let you know what I think! Since I am a freakin music hound anyway, it seems mildly appropriate!   In My CD Player Now:   Earlier I was listening to Dave Matthews Band's Busted Stuff!!!!  AWESOME!!! I don't really feel the need to go into this cd all that much since if you ever read my blog you would know that I have been talking about it non-stop since I bootlegged it before it's release... AND YES I STILL BOUGHT THE ALBUM TO SUPPORT MY BAND! I WOULDN'T TAKE MONEY FROM THEM! But in my opinion this is probably my favorite studio album since Under The Table and Dreaming! I love it! I just can't get enough of it. Now don't get me wrong, except for the Chicago Live CD, I have them all and love them all but this in particular has just risen to my best expectations. Probably because of Grey Street, Bartender and Grace is Gone which were my favorite lillywhites as well and now I love them even more!!! I HIGHLY recommend this album!!! Stop what you are doing right now, go to the store and BUY IT! It's just that good. And no I am not saying that because I am a freakin dave fanatic!   A Little Later... I was listening to Indigo Girls' 1200 Curfews (their double live disc). I dig it, I definitely have my favorites and I think I have just worn out track two on disc two (Galileo)! It's the chick acoustic rock sound for those of you who live in a hole and don't know what the Indigo Girls sound like! It's been around for a while but if you are a fan of the Lillith Fair sound and you like live discs I highly recommend this one as well!   And Now... I am listening to The Calling's Camino Palmero! I love it! I love this guy's voice. And this is one of those few cds that I have (much like Busted Stuff) where I like every single song on it. I didn't go out and buy it for Wherever You Go, which is still a great song, it wasn't until I heard one of their songs (maybe on Smallville??) called Thank You that I just loved this band. I went out and bought the CD for that song alone and ended up loving the whole thing. I have completely fallen in love with Unstoppable too. Someone told me this song is playing on the radio now, which is great, but we all know I never listen to the radio so I have no idea... I literally cannot say one bad thing about this CD... except are we sure that voice is coming out of that scrawny kid??? But if you like bands like Lifehouse, Vertical Horizon, Greenwheel, Remy Zero, that kind of thing you'll really like this CD.   That;s it for now, still working on The Calling....    [ Tue Jul 23, 11:38:56 AM | Erin Trost | edit ] Cool Link   For anyone interested in joining a cool bookclub without leaving the house... OH I LOVE THIS SONG!!! Sorry, I am not very good at blogging when music is on! Here's the link!  Book Crossing   "If we had this night together, if we had a moment to ourselves, if we had this night together than we'd be unstoppable!!! LALALALA!...." I really do like this song! For those of you wondering what I am listening to... at the moment it appears to be The Calling's Unstoppable. I love this entire cd! Wow, I am way off subject now!   For those who want to visit my own personal bookshelf (which I actually created a month ago but has somehow screwed itself up and lost my original book review - there was only one - so I created a whole new membership and wrote in a new book review and released a new book into the wild!) go here....  My Bookshelf   That's it! [ Tue Jul 23, 11:32:12 AM | Erin Trost | edit ] Last Night   So a friend, who will remain nameless, calls me last night to tell me that his sister's ex-boyfriend (who aparently is heavily into drugs) would not leave the house despite her insistance. They have a son of 2 years old together and have been living together for a while. Aparently she called the police and even though he is NOT on the deed to the house and even though he is up for drug charges in court today the police wouldn't do anything. They said as long as his stuff was there, even if it was just his toothbrush, he didn't have to leave, he had every right to be there. So this friend of mine calls and asks me to help him out. I then call another friend. We all meet up the other friend's apartment. We then drive ourselves to her house and we are ready for whatever might go down. Aparently upon hearing we were coming the ex called his brother to come over because he wanted to rumble??? I don't know. But the guy's brother was like "I don't feel like fighting" and didn't come. Fortunately before any of us met up at all my friend called the ex's parents and asked them to help intervene. So by the time we got to the sister's house the parents had come and gone and took the ex with them. It was a totally weird situation and I was all ready for the worse to go down. I realized how loyal I am to my friends (which is a good thing... kind of) but it completely blindsides me. I got so lucky last night. It could've been so bad with cops and what not had the guy still been there and had a fight broken out. Of course I watch too much television and would've half expected to be dragged down to jail till it was all figured out. I don't know, but anyway, it turned out to be pretty uneventful, of which I am glad. We sat and talked with my friend's sister for a while and then returned to our homes.  [ Tue Jul 23, 11:07:44 AM | Erin Trost | edit ] Speculation   There has been quite a bit of speculation as to how I am doing with my current roommate "situation". I don't really feel the need to actually comment on it to most of you since it's not necessarily fair to my roommate and since we obviously have issues to work out just between the two of us. But to give you an idea of how I am now, I'm fine. I'm happy. I'm okay. And despite what has gone down recently, I am surprisingly okay with the situation now. Try to remember, this is not really just one person's fault, it's both of ours... and I am beginning to think it's more of a clash of personalities and a lack of understanding more than anything else... but again, thanks for your concern!

      Posts from Sunday, July 21, 2002: [ Sun Jul 21, 11:28:58 PM | Erin Trost | edit ] My Weekend   Friday night I went to see Road to Perdition... AWESOME! Visually beautiful, great story, amazing acting, I can't really even write anything about this because I am just so thrilled with it. Visually it is like American Beauty, which makes sense since it was directed by the same guy... just breathtaking... and oh my God I love Paul Newman.... just great.   Saturday day I fought with the cable guy.... he pissed me off and didn't fix the problem. That's two cable guys in four days....   Saturday night I went with Leigh and Amy to see the DC sessions. Not overly thrilled with the bands but I still had a good time. Sister Hazel played which was the highlight of the night. It started with Jackstar (I think that was the band's name) and they sucked. They were completely out of tune and the girl was either sharp or flat of the pitch the whole time... and their songs sucked. What mother told them they could sing??? Jesus. So then Ebo comes on, who is from Fairfax I guess. They're actually not all that bad, just not the kind of band I could listen to for hours on end. So then Sister Hazel comes on and they're not bad at all, in fact they have good sound, good tone, good harmony... only problem is I know a total of 2 of their songs and I am so hot and being pushed around by drunken crowd surfing crack smoking cheerleaders... no offense... so thank god, after we hear Sister Hazel's first radio hit from way back, you know the one that goes "Hard to say what it is I see in you, wonder if I'll always be with you..." Amy decides we can go.   Sunday day... fight with the cable company on the phone, work on English paper, write and watch Mike Meyers on television all day... that's about it....   :) [ Sun Jul 21, 11:18:22 PM | Erin Trost | edit ] DAVE in Hershey!!!   Leigh just called me from Hershey PA where he is, and I am so jealous here, at the DMB show right now... He called me twice, once during Two Step and once during Grey Street! I love this kid! My two favorites and he called so I could hear both! YAY!   "She feels like kickin' out all the windows and setting fire to this life... she could change everything about her..."   "Celebrate we will, cause life is short but sweet for certain, hey we climb on two by two, to make sure these days continue...." [ Sun Jul 21, 11:15:31 PM | Erin Trost | edit ] Cheerleading???   So I had this dream last night that I went back to high school at my age now (23) for a fifth year... not quite sure why since in my dream I had graduated already the first time around just like before. And for whatever reason I joined the cheerleading squad. I don't remember much of the dream but I do remember that at one point after practice I went out to the parking lot and I couldn't find my car anywhere, I must've looked for hours. Aparently the high school parking lot was THAT big. So anyway, I am searching and searching and I finally remembered where I had parked. So I find the car. Then the next thing I know I am at practice and this girl and I are having an argument. Then the next thing I know I overhear someone telling this other girl that I am totally mean and that they don't want me on the team. And normally these are the kind of dreams where I get all upset and whatever but this time I just don't care. I'm like... they think I'm a bitch??? Whatever, fine with me. So I go to the coach and quit the team. The coach tries really hard to get me to stay but I say no thanks. Then I am on my way out to the car and even though it's the beginning of the year prom is like that weekend but I've decided not to go because I think that I've already been to enough proms in my first four years of high school and I don't really want to hang with a bunch of kids. I decide to just hang out with my friends at a party they are having that weekend. So as I am walking to my car to go home from the weekend this girl on the squad comes running up and hands me this invitation to the cheerleading after prom party she throws every year. I tell her I quit the team and she starts to cry saying it's all her fault and she's so sorry and she really wants me to stay. But I tell her it's for the best, I never really liked cheerleading all that much anyway. She says that I need to go to her party anyway, that she really wants me there. So as I am driving home I stop off at this dress store and just buy a gorgeous dress (cause aparently I am suddenly rich???). I think about who I can call and for whatever reason I decide that I will call my agent and just have him set me up with someone last minute... (I have an agent???). So I am there at my apartment getting ready and there is a knock on the door and when I open it my prom date is standing there... it's Joey Lawrence (why???)... I am utterly disappointed... I know the night is gonna suck and I am trying to get out of going. When we get to the prom I am all embarrassed because of my date and I think that everyone is gonna laugh but all these obnoxious teenage girls just go nuts over him and he is so happy... I realize that I need to just get out of high school all together right then because I don't want to be someplace that worships someone like Joey Lawrence.... so anyway we go in our limo to the girl's house who is having the party and just as we are ringing the doorbell I wake up....   It's totally weird, I don';t know where any of it came from and I am still baffled at the whole idea. But I wanted to write it all down because I always remember my dreams but they're not always as insane as this one. :)

      Posts from Thursday, July 18, 2002: [ Thu Jul 18, 07:54:44 PM | Erin Trost | edit ] AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHhhhh -- That's all I have to say about that...... [ Thu Jul 18, 04:08:17 PM | Erin Trost | edit ] John Q and New Best Friend   So over the last two days I have managed to sneak in two movies between all the fighting and backtalking... most of you know what I mean.... So here is what I think:   New Best Friend  Well, it was interesting... I kind of liked it. Hadley (I LOVE THAT NAME) was played by Meredith Monroe who most know from Dawson's Creek fame. She was not only stunning in this, which she never was on DC, but she played all sides well. She played the bitch against the genuinely nice girl very well and I was impressed by her. The story is about these three girls who are best friends and rich and live in this house together at Colby (I believe this was the name) College. They befriend this poor student and basically turn her from rags to riches... at least as far as her look went. The roommates were played by Domique Swain who is quickly becoming the queen of Independent films and Rachel True, of The Craft fame. Well basically the girl they befriend (Mia something or another) ends up in the hospital with an overdose and it is suspected that she OD'd at the hands of someone else. So Taye Diggs comes in and investigates everyone, including the boyfriends of the three main girls (Scott Bairstow, Oliver Hudson, and some other guy I recognized.) It's an odd movie, but I liked it. I think part of what I liked about it was that it showed all the characters in a poor light except maybe Taye Diggs and Scott Bairstow. None of them were completely good people, least of all the girl they take in as their friend who ends up trying to play them hard core. It might be worth the rental for you.   John Q  I really liked this movie, but OH MY GOD did it break my heart! It is just so damn depressing and even when it's happy it's depressing. Basically this is about a guy who can't seem to get a break but he loves his family very much. Esentially he finds out one day that his son will die without a heart transplant and even though he's agreed to do it his insurance won't cover it. So even though he basically sells off EVERYTHING he and his wife own he still doesn't have enough money to cover it and he finds out that they are going to release his son. So he takes a gun and grabs the heart surgeon who was working on his son's case and holds him as well as some other odd ball characters hostage. But in true Denzel form (that is, until Training Day came out) he still remains the hero even though he's holding up a hospital emergency room. Everyone cheers for him. Basically the movie is all about trying to get his son the heart transplant. It's a good movie, I would rent it, but just remember that it will break your heart...

      Posts from Wednesday, July 17, 2002: [ Wed Jul 17, 11:57:19 AM | Erin Trost | edit ] The Rest of The Weekend...  And on to part 3....   So finally we drop Leigh off in Arlington, I then drive Kevin home and then Eric. I get home myself at 5:15 and have 30 minutes before I have to get back in the car to drive and meet Leigh. So after having a cigarette with Toni, showering, shaving and changing I was out the door in 30 minutes. I went by the bank and headed to Arlington again. Leigh drove this time, thank god, I was so tired of driving! We got into Clarendon, exhausted, and stood in line at IOTA to get in to see Pat McGee. We got there around 6:30PM, we stood in line till like 8:00PM. We were towards the front though. We sat there the whole time listening to this guy in front of us going on and on about Pat this and Pat that... maybe he knew him, I don't know and after awhile I was just annoyed. So Leigh and I talked for an hour and a half and then finally got in. We were expecting more than we saw. It was tiny. The place was so very small. We originally staked out a place against this random wall in the middle of the room. I started drinking (despite the fact that I wasn';t going to) and we waited. Andy from Earth To Andy came on and played some acoustic stuff. This girl next to us was either a die hard fan or a friend of his because while everyone else talked through his performance (they were rude) she just stood there mystified. Leigh and I felt kind of bad for her. So then he finishes and Leigh says he wants a cigarette so we look around and no one near us is smoking. We see some people in the far corner of the room smoking and make our way across the floor to them. So we stand there and immediately make friends with the guys around us. We start talking about the band (Pat McGee), Dave Matthews, Jam Band festivals, Widespread... we all click. Then the band comes out and they hang over by us for a little while. We realize we're next to all their friends and family. Due to our new location we got to interact with them when they weren't playing and it was such a much better location since even though we were off to the side we were right up against the stage. Since the place was tiny they were only like five feet from us. It was way too cool. Leigh and I had the best time. They played incredibly and their friends were so much fun. Everyone was so into it! I have to admit I had a much better time that night than I did the night before at Dave... blasphemy, I know. So they played for like three hours straight and by the end of the night we were flying high on energy. Finally we took off when it was all over. The band was going into Georgetown and had invited those who remained in the audience to go but Leigh and I were SOO TIRED! So I got home around 1:30 AM. I crashed hard. The next day I woke up and went to lunch with Mom and Nancy at Flat Tops... SO GOOD! Then we went to Foxes Music and then played music back at Nancy's house forever. Mom bought me so much stuff!!! Then I went home, pulled out the guitar and began to reteach myself. My fingers are now killing me. But I have to say it was one of the best weekends I had ever had! I just had fun! But now back to reality where I am sitting here at work on a Wednesday wishing the weekend would come!  [ Wed Jul 17, 11:32:43 AM | Erin Trost | edit ] VA Beach continued....  So, after the concert ends we all sit around on the lawn for a while admiring how soft the grass is and noting how trashed the place is, someone likens it to the mall on Earth Day. We finally make our way to the parking lot thinking we're going to be there for a while. But we actually got out of there quickly (by quickly I mean it took 30 min instead of the 90 it takes to get out of Nissan or RFK.) So we start driving and I am so hungry since it's like 11 and I haven't eaten since 2. At first everyone is like "go to McDonalds." I kept saying we should find a waffle house or a dennys or someplace I could get breakfast. They didn't like that idea till we started driving... suddenly everyone wanted breakfast and everyone was on the lookout for a place to go. We drive past our hotel because I knew I had seen a bunch of retail plazas past our hotel earlier. We find a denny's and go nuts. We're way too excited over cheap breakfast food. So everyone orders meat, except me who orders basically eggs with cheese and hashbrowns. OH! Grey Street just came on while I'm writing this... YAY!!!! "She says nothing of what she thinks..." Anyway, so we eat and Kevin tells us this passionate tale (he's really drunk still) about Vanilla Coke that has Leigh and I rolling and when Eric gets back from the bathroom he retells the whole story for him, which keeps me laughing all over again. The food tasted so good. We go back to the hotel, exhausted... Eric and I go up to our room and I decide I want a cigarette so I go down... "Oh there's an emptiness inside her and she'd do anything to fill it in, and though it's red blood bleeding from her now, it's more like cold blue ice in her heart, she feels like kickin' out all the windows and setting fire to this life... she could change everything about her...." Sorry. Anyway, so back to the story... so I go down and hang with Leigh and Kevin for a minute since they are in a smoking room and then head to the front desk to ask for shampoo since their sign says if you forgot anything, ask at the front desk... they don't have shampoo. So I go back up to the room and Eric and I are watching Iron Chef. I finally fall asleep before I see who wins. I wake up in the morning and Eric has to wake me up twice before I actually get out of bed, he, magically has found shampoo in his travel case. But it strips my hair completely but whatever... so we go outside and it's raining. I go wake up Leigh so that we can jump his car. He tries to get Kevin up. We all hang out and wait for Kevin to GET THE HELL UP!!! He finally comes crawling out and they check out of the hotel as we did earlier. So then we try to jump Leigh's car. It won't work, we try a couple more times and nothing.... so then we do everything we can to figure out what to do, we finally find a phone book and there isn't a single Chrystler dealer in the area so we would;ve had to drive to Suffolk, Norfolk or Chesapeake. Leigh calls AAA and I am looking over some buildings and notice that there is a sign WAY in the distance that looks like a Chrystler sign. So Eric and I decide to drive down and see. We take orders for breakfast because at this point we are starving and we jump in the car and drive off. We find a Dodge dealership, a Merchants Auto Center and a Chrystler dealership... we are so proud. We call Leigh to tell him about them all but that the only one open on Sunday is Merchants. We get breakfast and by the time we get back Kevin tells us that Leigh has already gone with the tow truck guy and they are stopping at Merchants. So we get in the car and go to Merchants and wait for Leigh. He has to leave his car down there because they can't get to it till the next day. We get in my car and take off for home. We sit in massive traffic, not to mention the rain... did you know you can see the roads better in rain if you are wearing polarized sunglasses??? I didn't. We stop off for gas at a gas station that is ten miles off of 64 and three out of the six pumps aren't working... then we get back in the car and we head to Richmond so that we can eat at this diner that Eric loves. (We used to go there all the time when he was with Bobby but he never gets to go anymore...). Finally we get back on the road and Eric drives.... [ Wed Jul 17, 10:57:55 AM | Erin Trost | edit ] VA Beach   So after having a restful evening at home ALONE!!!! on Friday night I got up on Saturday, packed, picked up Eric and met with Leigh and Kevin at their apartment. We programed cell phone numbers and everything seemed peachy. Leigh, being the brilliant guy that he is, printed two copies of the directions and gave me one. Everything seemed to be perfect... we went down 123 with no problem, hit 95 and of course hit some bitch on a cell phone as we were merging on... well we didn't actually hit her but we had to deal with her. Eric, in the passenger seat, and her had an all out war as far as symbols and yelling goes. Kind of funny, but definitely not a good way to start the trip. So I get on the cell phone and call Leigh to make sure he made it onto 95 since he hadn't ever gone the way we took him and since he was behind us and we couldn't see him. He had. Things were good, we were cruising down 95, both cars were doing well, and the evil cell phone bitch had gotten off the road at an early exit. Then all at once we hit traffic and we hit it hard.... and we stayed in it off and on (mostly on) the entire way to VA Beach. At one point on 64 I actually pulled over to the side of the road and told Eric to get the hell in the drivers seat because I couldn't handle it anymore!!!!! Five minutes after he got in and started driving he was pissed off. Eventually we had to stop for food because we were going to kill everyone on that road we were so frustrated and hungry. So we get back in the car and I go to sleep. The next thing I know we're getting onto 264 and we're almost there.... I slept through the tunnel traffic!!! So we get there and we're about to turn into our hotel parking lot when Leigh (who had previously called to tell me he made it to the hotel 10 min before we got there) called again to say we needed to go get beer because his car wouldn't start. Damn. But we think it just needs a jump which we can do later so Eric and I go get beer. We get to the hotel, check in (it's not God awful but it's so very much worse then I expected... of course I am used to being in really nice hotels for work), and then we have to turn around and leave right away for the concert. We get there and have to park all funny because they let too many cars down that row. But whatever. We go find a friend of Leigh's who is hanging with this very cool chick and everyone clicks and has a good time hanging out in the parking lot. Then we all decide to go into the concert and we all hang out on the lawn, again having a good time. I am not drinking since I am not allowed to till I get this test done... (of course I ruin that the next day but whatever) but everyone else is getting plastered and it is hysterical... so Norah Jones comes on and she just rocks! Her voice sounds exactly like her cd, I was just so impressed with her. It was nice to finally have a really good opening act (although nothing beats Ben Harper a couple of years ago) and Leigh tells me then that Dave Matthews will take the stage at like 8:05 PM. He's drunk, he doesn't actually know this but he is sure he is right... 8:05 rolls around and no Dave. HAH! Anyway, so Dave comes on and I'm all psyched and the whole time I've been saying how I want them to play three songs... Two Step (everyone knows this is my all time favorite Dave Song), Grey Street (My new favorite Dave Song) and Watchtower (my favorite cover that Dave does). They kick off the concert with Grey Street! I went ballistic! I was so excited and everyone in the group was like "Erin, you have to be so excited over this!!!" I so was. So then they do a few other songs, excellent as well, and then one of Leigh's friends asked me if I dance and I said I don't because I suck but if they play Two Step, I'll go nuts! Leigh turns to me when that song ends and says, "they're going to play two step next...." he was actually just telling me this so that I would be pissed off when they didn't play it next (remember Leigh is drunk and his logic is completely skewed!) And suddenly those familiar notes float up through the air.... IT WAS F*$KING TWO STEP!!! I went insane and hugged Leigh! And anyone who knows me, knows I don't hug unless I'm drunk... which I so wasn't. They jammed on it forever and it was SO GOOD! I couldn't get over how amazing both Boyd and Carter were... INSANITY!!!! They were just so into the music that every time you caught a glimpse of them you just felt their energy. Then they did some other good ones through the show, Raven, Grace is Gone as well as many others, and they just rocked on both Jimi Thing and Ants Marching... again it was insane how good they were! They just went on forever. So then they leave the stage and they stay off for a really long time, I think I burned my thumb on my lighter from holding it for so long... So then they come back on and kick right away into Watchtower. Well it was all over for me... I heard them all and every one I wanted to hear was just played so intensely and so amazing. They played on Watchtower for quite a while and it was just brilliant! But then they were done. I don't think I've ever been to a Dave concert where they've only played one song during their encore. We were all kind of left shocked. They were so good so we couldn't really feel disappointed but we were left feeling slightly unsatisfied... it was weird... the concert was so good but we didn't know what to think with only one song in the encore... [ Wed Jul 17, 10:15:29 AM | Erin Trost | edit ] Update on Burger King   Again, I needed to grab something quickly yesterday so I went out to Burger King during my lunch hour to get a veggie burger... again I pulled up and gave my order (Not hard, veggie burger, Plain with ketchup; and a diet coke) and again they repeated it back to me... again I pulled up to the window... but this time I almost took the food and left but I thought... maybe I'll check. So I asked before they handed me the bag, "that is a veggie burger right?". Her response? "No, it's a double whopper with cheese." WHAT???? She gave me attitude when I told her that wasn't what I ordered and she was like "Well, what do you expect?" I was like, what if I was allergic to red meat??? Then what??? She didn't know what to say. Needless to say, I got my veggie burger...

Love never ends, as for phrophecies, they will pass away, as for tongues, they will cease, as for knowledge, it will pass away. For our knowledge is imperfect, but when the perfect comes, the imperfect will pass away. When I was a child, I spoke like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child, when I became a man I gave up childish ways. For now we see in a mirror dimly, but then face to face.

So last night on the way home from the gym I'm starving and thinking that I cannot wait to cook my vegitarian pizza so I decide to just swing by Burger King and grab a veggie burger. I order it plain, no cheese, we go through all the motions of repeating it back to me so that I've made sure the order is right and then I pull up to the window. I check the receipt, vegi burger, and I begin to drive off. The thing is hot, which would make sense since they had to make it plain and that always requires them to cook it on the spot, so I wait a few minutes before unwrapping and starting to eat. I didn't pay ANY attention to what I was eating, I put my faith in the fine employees of Burger King... BIG FREAKIN MISTAKE!!! Bastards that they are had managed to not only give me the vegie burger the way I ordered it but they DIDN'T GIVE IT TO ME AT ALL. I had taken two bites and was like, something isn't right, so while driving on 66 I open up the sandwich to realize that I had eaten MEAT! RED FREAKIN MEAT! AHHHHH! I'm only like five minutes from home but I just begin to freak out completely, images of dead cows in the slaughterhouse come back to me and I can't seem to gain control of myself. I throw the rest of the sandwich out of the window, by the way my apologies to anyone it may have hit, and then drive at lightening speeds to my house. I then fling open the front door, run inside and quickly learn how to be bulemic (sp?), okay well that's a lie since we all know I've gotten good at making myself throw up when I drink too much... BUT DID YOU ALL KNOW THAT IT'S HARDER TO THROW UP WHEN YOU'RE NOT DRUNK! Oh it was way too gross, but I got it all out. I think I actually got it all out and then some. I don't how people make themselves throw up on a regular basis, I still hurt from it... my throat, my stomach, this all reminds me of when I had that messed up stomach virus for three months straight and couldn't keep anything down, but at least then I wasn't MAKING myself do that... my stomach decided to do that all on it's own. So finally I get it all out, I jump in the shower, I feel absolutely disgusting and not just from being at the gym, from the idea that I ate meat, and then proceed to not only use mouthwash, listerine tabs, and brush my teeth six times over but I drink salt water and gargle it. I think I'm finally recovering now but it's been over twelve hours since I ate it... I then proceeded to eat a piece of pie and was starving again by like midnight last night, woke up hungry, have been hungry all day, and still shiver every time I think of it. All of this because of some damn employee at Burger King who is either an idiot or did it on purpose to be funny... I SO WANT TO CALL THEM AND REEM THEM OUT! BASTARDS!

      Fridays move so slowly around here... it's killing me!  By the way, I received an update that Erica (my little friend from the American Idol audition) has moved past the second round of auditions and right about now she should be done auditioning for Paula, Randy and Simon.  Hopefully I'll hear soon as to how she did.  I am so friggin proud of her!

      Day 4 – Audition Day  So I wake up at 3:30 AM and after getting ready I make my way down the streets of Chelsea just praying for a cab to drive by cause I am exhausted and my feet are already starting to get blisters from the shoes I had stupidly decided to wear.  I am a genius!  As I am walking down I run into a police barricade with three or four policemen up on horseback and one standing between and on the outer sides of each of them.  I try to pass through but they are rounding up hoodlums and despite the fact that I am the most preppy looking person on the street I guess they think I look like the hoodlums because they tell me I can’t pass.  I guess a club had let out cause they were telling everyone to move away from the club and go home.  I asked if I could pass on the other side of the street since there wasn’t any police activity over there and one of the cops told me he didn’t care since they weren’t on the other side of the street.  Great police work!  So I cross the street and head down to my destination.  Once I get to the Javits center everyone is already awake and moving around.  Apparently it had started to rain around 3 AM which had acted like a wake up call.  Everyone was sleepy and tired but the singing had already started.  People were warming up left and right and driving me nuts already.  Caitlin had changed and packed up her stuff already.  So I sat down on the eggshell foam thing we were going to throw away and just waited.  Not long after I showed up Erica and her dad showed up and Erica just fell asleep on the eggshells again.  The rest of us tried to cope with the fact that we were up at 4 AM.  Caitlin, being the good sister that she is, walked down to Mobile to get us hot tea.  So anyway, basically a lot of nothing happened.  Finally we were called around 7:30 AM to move in line around the barricades.  We wove in and out till we reached the front door of the Javits Center where we were led through the halls and into a large room where about 5000 chairs were set up.  We filed in.  We then had to wait through hours and hours of nothing, although Nigel (the Executive producer of the show) gave a really good speech and run down.  He also was sweet enough to say that just because you weren’t picked today didn’t mean that you weren’t talented or worth anything but the producers you were auditioning in front of were looking for specific things and if you didn’t have those things then you would be told you were not what they were searching for… fair enough.  Everyone around got nervous and started freaking out if they had picked the right song but Erica, Caitlin and I just sat there tired and ready to sleep.  Nigel also said you would be going in front of one producer with two other auditionees, you would take turns singing and then the producer would tell you to go or stay.  He said that you wouldn’t be able to hear the people auditioning for any of the other 11 producers.  Remember this fact cause it was a huge lie.  Caitlin and I listened to people practice around them and we hummed to ourselves.  I had my olive oil and it was funny to see all the little things people did before they sang.  Some were myths I knew didn’t work while others had very good ideas I might steal now.  Oh, we were also told by Nigel there would be 10 to 12 producers auditioning us at one time depending on their lunch breaks.  So imagine our surprise at 11:30 AM when we were not far from auditioning and they told us they were taking a 30 min break for lunch.  COME ON!  Erica quickly called her dad to see if he would go get food for her, Caitlin and me.  By the time he got there though the place was already packed so we forwent lunch.  This was better anyway.  We didn’t need anything screwing up our voices.  But Caitlin and I had waited all day to have a cigarette and decided we were going to have one.  See the difference between Caitlin and I and all the other auditioners (with the exception of Erica) was even though we were taking this seriously we kind of like our lives so if we didn’t get in we would be just fine.  So we get back from lunch (or break for us) and they start moving people again.  We get in shortly, go stand in line and wait to go into the room.  Now I thought we were going to be in a room on our own with the producers or at least separated by large barriers… I was so wrong.  When I walked into the room I was immediately divided, Caitlin went off with another group and Erica, Jen and I were paired off.  Nigel took us over to our producer and had us stand and wait our turns.  The group before us was finishing up and they were all told to go home (in a nice way) and I knew right then that this was not a talent audition of any kind.  You see there were 12 stations in one large room and eleven other people were going to be belting our their songs at the same time you were at their stations.  There was no way the producer you were auditioning for would even be able to hear your audition.  Jen went first and she changed keys every five seconds and her tone was not good.  I felt bad for her knowing she’d be cut immediately.  Erica sang and was perfect, she was exactly what they were looking for and I was grinning knowing she would move on.  When I started, the key to my song was I knew I would be able to show what a strong singer I am even when I sing softly and then move into the belting part.  When I started I couldn’t even hear myself because of the eleven other people singing at the same time.  I knew the producer couldn’t hear me and then by the time I hit the belting part I had just given up and even though it was a good audition I didn’t look like the girls they were picking and I was a bit turned off because they weren’t looking for talent they were looking for characters on a television show.  I should have known this but somehow along the way I had just assumed they would at least fake the fact that they were looking for talent before anything else.  I finished up and he looked at Jen and I and said sorry, you’re not what we’re looking for and then looked at Erica and told her they would like her to come back for a call back.  I was so happy for Erica.  I think our whole group ran the gamut of emotions as Jen immediately burst into tears, Erica was flustered because she was so excited and I was like eh… I had a good run!  I was laughing on my way out while Jen was following me crying her eyes out.  When we got out to the loser area I felt bad for all the girls that were basing their whole worlds around it.  I waited to see if Caitlin was coming out.  She came out and told me that she had heard me across the room and that I had sounded really good.  She said that when she saw me walking out she didn’t care anymore and even though she had a good audition she didn’t have the heart.  I told her I was all excited cause I was waiting outside for her to not come out so I could find out she had made it!  How cool would that have been?!  So anyway, Caitlin comes out and is also laughing.  We, at this point, just want to go home.  Right before Caitlin came out Erica came out the wrong door and the camera crew was following her around everywhere, it was hysterical.  I told her she had to go somewhere else, she was so flustered though she didn’t know what was going on.  I eventually told her again to go upstairs and this time she listened.  In the meantime Stefan, Tiffany, Corey, and Adrienne all came out and no one was upset, we were like well, what are you gonna do?  When Caitlin came out she wanted to tell Erica how proud she was.  So we went upstairs to where the callback people went and she told Erica how proud she was.  Then we left.  And it was about time.  All we wanted to do was get to the hotel.  Needless to say the rest is boring.  We got food on the way home, went back to the hotel, booked a train out that afternoon, packed up and came home to regale our story for everyone who wanted to know.  All I have to say is Erica got in and she fully deserved it.  Now I expect to see her on the show and making it all the way to the end!  She could win it all.  She has that x-factor and I wish her the best of luck.  I on the other hand am now focused on getting my tape for Berklee together because I want that more than anything… far more than I ever wanted American Idol.  So don’t be sad for me, I didn’t want it badly enough I guess and I wasn’t the least bit upset when I got cut… it just meant I got to come home to you all :)

      Sorry to say, I did not come back even having a shot at being the next American Idol... don't be sad... I'm not... read on about my weekend....   Day 1  Friday night I left work and drove immediately to meet Caitlin and Eric so that Nancy could drive us to Union Station.  Packing for this thing was a nightmare because we didn't know what we needed to bring.  We had sleeping bags, blankets, water, food, clothes, chairs, pillows and bags of stuff to entertain us.  You see the only thing we knew going into this was that we were to start lining up on Saturday at noon and all would be turned away after that.  We didn't know if we would be allowed to leave the camp site once we received this mystical "wristband" the website kept talking about.  We were also given a list of rules stating that if this wristband was tampered with at all we would turned away or cut immediately. The rules also said if you were to get in line before noon on Saturday you would automatically turned away and cut.  So we managed to carry EVERYTHING onto the train and store it.  We sat separately since there was not a spare seat on this Friday night train to NYC.  Once there we emerged from Penn Station New York and up onto the street.  There we took in another cigarette and decided to catch a cab since we had no idea where we were going.  Once we loaded everything into the cab I told the driver to take us to the Chelsea Star.  Well when the cab driver pulled up in front of the Chelsea Hotel I explained this was not it.  I dug in my bag for the address and finally he delivered us to the correct address.  Let me explain what I saw.  There was a blue door with the address number on it.  That was it.  It was just a blue door.  We were thinking maybe it would be better to just sleep on the streetsâ€¦ but alas we called up on the intercom, lugged our stuff up a large flight of stairs, as there was no elevator, and we ended up being pleasantly surprised by the atmosphere.  It was a hip â€œloftâ€� sort of feel.  At first the manager scared us by saying things had been screwed up in the blackout the weekend before and they were full but then he explained he had a room for usâ€¦ I still donâ€™t understand why he felt the need to tell us they were full unless they were trying to say how lucky we were.  So we went up another flight of stairs to the room where it was even cuter.  I was very impressed and the feel of the room was very stylish and very roomy.  I would highly recommend it in the end.  So anyway, we went out to the terrace (you canâ€™t smoke inside NYC buildings anymore unless itâ€™s your own place) and had a couple cigarettes before the terrace closed and then Caitlin and Eric went looking for cold water.  The air in our room hadnâ€™t been turned on until we got there so it was burning up.  I, on the other hand, went up to the room and waited for them.  When they finally returned later they mentioned they had walked around the block to see what was there and guess what?  Penn Station was across the street.  We took a $7 cab ride for nothing!  So we went to sleep that night with a game plan for the following day.  Day 2  At 9 we all woke up and began taking turns in the shower.  Well the shower head was adjustable by height but it wouldnâ€™t stay up high so we learned how flexible we could be. And believe it or not I broke the damn thing at one point, which actually made it easier for me to use but then Eric fixed itâ€¦ dammit.  We walked to get breakfast, only bringing a bag of water and snacks and chairs with us this time.  We had a good breakfast and we headed down to the Jacob Javits Center to see what was going on.  The rules said no one could start lining up till noon so we figured we would be waiting across the street and in a mad dash we would all be running across the street to line up.  But when we got there we found out that the whole line had started the night before.  Technically the street where you originally lined up wasnâ€™t on the property so it didnâ€™t count.  We got in line behind what must have already been almost three thousand people.  We immediately began to meet people.  Adrienne â€“ from PA, a single mom at the age of 21.  Jen and Tiffany â€“ friends from PA, Tiffany worked a hourly job (I didnâ€™t much care for her) and Jen who was recently married and had two kids.  Erica and her dad â€“ Erica was a drop dead gorgeous 17 year old who had missed the L.A. auditions and was in from San Diego.  Her dad had taken a job in Boston and had moved from the family.  She had been out doing college searches and her dad agreed to come with her to the auditions.  Fatima â€“ from NJ.  Stephan (which he pronounces Stefan â€“ or Steph-on) Jones who is a model for Ford Models.  Look up the website if you want to know what he looks like.  He lives right across the state line in Jersey and was hysterical.  â€œTO THE WINDOW!!! TO THE WALL!!!â€�  So we wait in this line for what must have been close to three and a half hours.  I got sunburned big time.  We finally get in, set up camp and relax.  OH!  And while we were in line we heard a rumor that once in with a wristband we couldnâ€™t leave.  So we sent Eric scrambling for things we needed.  He had to drag back a suitcase and a huge bag.  I felt so bad.  Once he left to go get it we spoke to someone who had already set up camp, received a wristband and had come out and she said you could come and go as long as the people around you would let you back in line.  We knew this wouldnâ€™t be a problem since we had already established a friendship with them.  We tried to call him to tell him that he didnâ€™t need to get our stuff but he had left his phone off.  So he lugs it back and we take it all into the parking lot, get our wristbands and get in.  We sit around and Caitlin and Eric go get lunch/dinner.  They come back, we hang out a lot more, and it starts.  Everyone begins singing at the top of their lungs everywhere for everyone and especially around those of us who donâ€™t care.  Finally Eric goes back to the hotel and Caitlin and I decide to go to sleep.  Mind you, itâ€™s quiet hours according to the American Idol staff but the news crews are still running around and so everyone is singing for them.  Plus on top of that before quiet hours, this one girl starts up this disco line thing and itâ€™s in the main aisle way so the only way to get through is to dance down it or they wonâ€™t let you through.  It was hysterical.  So getting back to when Caitlin and I tried to go to sleep.  We are on hard concrete and we canâ€™t fall asleep and it was just killing me.  But we finally fall asleep.  Day 3  We wake up to singing, of course, and we are told we will probably be moving to camp inside so they can open up more room in the parking lot for the new arrivals.  So for a while we wait around Eric brings us doughnuts when he comes back to the camp site.  I finally tell them to move stuff without me if they move us inside and I head back to the hotel for a shower.  When I come back I am in a much better mood and Caitlin goes back to the hotel.  We sit around a lot, Caitlin and Eric had gone to K-Mart the day before and had picked up this pole thing so we rig up a tent.  They go get lunch.  We eat.  The day is boring.  I finish my entire Rolling Stone Magazine.  Eric and I take a trip to K-Mart later to pick up foam padding to sleep on that night and better pillows.  When we get back Caitlin tells us they just gave an announcement that they would be waking us up at 4 AM.  This sucks since I have to do my hair with a curling iron or it will look like crap.  So we decide I will be getting up at 3:30 to go back to the hotel.  We go get dinner.  We get back and sit for a while.  Then Erica says she is going to sleep at the hotel with her dad and Caitlin tells me I have to do the same, that she will not accept anything else.  So I pack up as much as I can to get back to the hotel and go sleep there.  In the midst of the day, by the way, I am getting phone calls from family and friends asking whatâ€™s going on.  I say nothing, they donâ€™t believe me, Iâ€™m like would you like me to tell you what I read about in Rolling Stone because thatâ€™s the most excitement Iâ€™ve had all day.  So I get back to the hotel, go to sleep.  And I am using Caitlinâ€™s cell phone alarm since hers is louder than mine.  I wake up at one when I think the alarm is going off and I am cursing the world cause I am thinking itâ€™s the alarm.  Eric wakes up and is telling me it is not at all 3:30 and he has to get up to find out what time it is.  Itâ€™s only 1.  Good thing it was her stalker or I wouldâ€™ve given her a piece of my mind.  But she couldnâ€™t help that.  Then I wake up later cause I am cold and wake Eric up again to get the blanket.  More to come about Audition Day soonâ€¦.

      Fun Fact of the Day:  If a statue in the park of a person on a horse has both front legs in the air, the person died in battle. If the horse has one front leg in the air the person died as a result of wounds received in battle. If the horse has all four legs on the ground, the person died of natural causes.

      I had a really good day today, joking with Jeff all morning (I love that kid... er old man... he is four years older than me), Kim's last day (so sad but FREE LUNCH!!!), possibly my least favorite loan officer of all time is getting fired (IT'S LIKE CHRISTMAS!!!), a staff meeting about boogers (you had to be there), Happy hour with Beth and Jen (the gorgeous girls in my life who just flatter me to no end), three movies bought for only 30 bucks, a frap from Starbucks (totally cheating!), and more importantly I get to round out the night with the O.C. at 9!!!!  What a good day!!!

      I went out with my girls from CMG... I miss them so much sometimes.  Of course they are just as fun and as beautiful as ever and I totally pale in comparison but I just have so much fun with them!  I don't know why we don't do it more often... oh right cause Jen has a boyfriend and Beth and I are busy as hell (although I found out tonight Beth has a new man she's trying out... good luck sweetheart!)

It's just as well since she will be gone before the week's up anyway, assuming things go the route of all the other receptionists.  Our reception department is a friggin revolving door.

      I friggin cannot get enough of this song:   Cold Lyrics " Cure My Tragedy "    Remember all those times that we used to play,  You were lost and I would save you. I don’t think those feelings will ever fade,  You were born a part of me. I was never good at hiding anything, My thoughts break me, Do you understand what you mean to me, You are my faith.  Won’t you cure my tragedy, Won’t you cure my tragedy. Don’t take her smile away from me, She’s broken and I’m far away. Won’t you cure my tragedy, Won’t you cure my tragedy. If you made the world a stage for me, Then I hope that you can hear me scream. Won’t you cure my tragedy?  When I sit and think of the days we shared, And the nights you covered for me. Every little thing that I ever did, You would stand by me. Every time you cried it would take my wind, My heart would break. If I could be strong like you were for me, You are my faith.  Won’t you cure my tragedy, Won’t you cure my tragedy. Don’t take her smile away from me, She’s broken and I’m far away. If you made the world a stage for me, Then I hope that you can hear me scream.  Can you hear me scream?  Can you hear me scream?  Won’t you cure my tragedy, Won’t you cure my tragedy. Don’t take her smile away from me, She’s broken and I’m far away. Won’t you cure my tragedy, Won’t you cure my tragedy. If you made the world a stage for me, Then I hope that you can hear me scream.  I can’t take this anymore, I can’t feel this anymore. Won't you take and give her pain to me,  Cause my whole life I made mistakes.  Can you hear me scream?  Can you hear me scream?

      Seriously now, you have just hurt me.  I don't know what else to say to this.  You have picked up on me being out with a friend... or a good aquaintence rather... one night and you have turned it into something ridiculous and unheard of.  As much as I love the kid you've picked up on you couldn't be more wrong and now all you are doing is hurting me with these nonsensical accusations.  I have tried to explain that this friend or aquaintence of mine or whatever you want to call him is just that and really you have no idea how ridiculous the notion of us being together really is, and you won't listen.  I am so tired of this.  And on top of it all, even if it was more or even if there was someone else it would be none of your business as I reiterate... WE ARE NOT TOGETHER!  So since I  know you check this and I am not going to call you till you are calm and maybe even, God forbid, rational about this, you should not call me as I will no longer be listening to your voicemail.

      What is it about the need to profess your true feelings for someone when you know they are about to move away?  I so don't get it.  What are you going to expect them to cancel all their plans just to stay with you?  If they were going to do that they wouldn't be leaving in the first place.  It's stupid, pointless and definitely the result of someone seeing too many romantic comedies in their day.  And so let's say the person is flattered but doesn't feel the same way, there are three ways this scenario can go.  A) The person tells you thank you and that's all they say other than maybe... I'm flattered... and you're left wondering what's really behind that thank you.  B) The person says they love you but they are still moving because who would cancel major plans just because of three little words?  And if they did they would resent you for keeping them from something that might have been a dare to be great scenario or maybe they move anyway and you try the long distance thing but it really doesn't work out.  Or there is C) You tell them and they laugh at you.  Now where in all this did the person doing the professing think they were going to come out on top?  So I can proudly say I've never done this and never will but to all of you out there thinking about it or who have already done it (and I know who you are) stop the next time you think it's a good idea.  Stop before you make a huge mistake.  Because the thing is you may think you'll kick yourself if you don't do it, but you'll be kicking yourself even harder if you do.  Go drink a beer, hang out with those of us who aren't crazy in love and can actually think straight and pass the fuck out because in the morning things will look a lot more clear and you'll be glad you took my advice.

      "Stuff this in your pipe and smoke it Trost.  (First take out the Peyote, hippie.)  http://www.msnbc.com/news/945950.asp"  "Jeff... sweetheart.... this hostility from you is really throwing off my chi.  I am so proud of you first of all for actually reading something other than the sports page and second of all it's so nice that you can feel so passionate about something.  Because I can see that someone becoming Governor of a state we don't even live in is important to you, I will support your efforts entirely.  It's just so darn cute.  And your efforts to use your word "bullets" against me just make me more concerned that you are riddled with anger problems and perhaps we need to turn those "bullets" into "flowers" and maybe turn that frown upside down.  I'm here for you if you need to talk."  "That is just like you damn hippies to be all supportive and what not of those who want to crush your minivans like bug.  Arnold will turn California into a meathead’s paradise where we can all live free and walk around naked quoting Terminators 1-4 and Conan.  What a world we are about to live in."  "I feel your anger and support you, I believe in your dreams and want to encourage you to never ever give those up because without dreams we would simply be pod-people roaming the earth.  Dreams are what make us thrive and make us believe in a world where we can live in harmony.  Whether that world be run by Arnold or whether it be run by flower power, it's important to keep believing in yourself.  Kudos to keeping that dream alive... I support you in all you do.  And really, was cursing hippies necessary?  They're people just like you."  "It is a proven fact that Hippies have tails at birth.  These tails inhibit normal neurotransmitter function to the brain and thus creates the dirty, flower power ideas that roam in their empty drug infested brains.  I will be standing at the gate of Venice Beach and no VWs or solar powered cars will be allowed in.  SMOKE THAT HIPPIE!"  "I do not wish to fight you.  I accept your ideas and will take them into consideration... peace be with you."  "Don’t even try your hippie mind tricks with me.  Now go forth and prosper….. doh!"   ~Jeff and Erin's emails at work (yes, this is what I do all day)

      "It was pretty much an ordinary day, but it was just nice.  I don't know why, I didn't do anything special but it was nice.  And when you're manic depressive and feelings basically get the better of you all the time, nice is a pretty amazing feeling.  I love everyone tonight... and no I am not drunk... so thanks to everyone who helped make the day so nice." ~My away message on IM  I don't know if it's the beautiful weather or if it was the hot chai but it was a really great evening.  I didn't do anything special or spend time with anyone special but for the moment I am just so happy being in my own skin and that hardly ever happens.  I know I can be bitchy and I know I have a temper like a tornado but in the end I am a good person.  I hide behind sarcasm and witt but I'm working on it.  Most of you know why I do it, why I built up this wall so quickly but trust me I am working very hard to tear it down.  Cause I like the days when I can be honest and not worry that people will hurt me, I like the days when I can feel the need to tell someone how much I appreciate them instead of just cutting them off at the knees so that they don't get too close.  I love that each person I know, despite their faults and mine, has brought something new into my life.  I like that, despite what everyone thinks, I can forgive so easily.  I love that, whether you see it or not, I am a hopeless optimist and a die hard romantic. I like that I try so hard to be friends with people, even when they don't want to reciprocate because it means I see something in so many that is worth having in my life.  I like that once in a while, even though I don't hear it back often, I can be honest for a moment and tell people how much I like having them in my life.  I like that I have the ability to step outside myself for a moment and really see my thoughts (this is why my therapist doesn't think I need therapy anymore cause I just analyze myself) and my faults for what they really are.  I love that I am so passionate and feel so intensely that most of the time I have a really hard time thinking before I speak or censoring my reaction to things.  I love that I still dream like a child, that I still have all the hopes and ambitions I had when I was five, that I never gave up on those silly ideas that started almost twenty years ago.  I love that I am high drama, not my life but me, because it goes back to reacting so quickly and so outwardly to anything I feel.   I love that I don't give up so easily on people and that I keep trying until someone has to literally just say stop, and even then I don't give up quickly.  I love that I care about everything.  I love that I have a family who encourages me no matter how many times I screw up, they believe in everything I do.  I love that music can dictate my mood and that there is something out there like music that I can build my life around, because how beautiful is that?  How amazing is it to know what you love and what you need to be around?  I love that I can take the time to sit down and write out my sappy thoughts and not be afraid that others will read them.  And most of all, I love feeling content and nice just because at the end of the day I know that no matter what anyone else thinks I am a good person, I do care about each and every one of you and I think about you all the time... no matter what you think of me.  Now, I am going to get my dog and head outside for one last cigarette before I go to bed because there is nothing more amazing than night time at this time of year.  Good night.

      So first of all I have to comment on last weekend since I have delayed it for so long.  Went to two dave shows... one on Saturday night and one on Sunday night and both were fun but Sunday was a blast because my cousin who I rarely get to see and adore came.  We saw the very beginning of Isabel hitting VA Beach on Monday morning when we prepared for our trip back.  After dropping off Susan (cousin) at the Norfolk airport we made our way back and despite the oncoming weather and many detours for different reasons we made great time.  By the way, DMB closed with an amazing two step on Sunday night!  Weather was perfect that night in VA Beach, so glad it waited till the next morning to kick in!  Tuesday and Wednesday were normal days at work  Thursday was the onset of Isabel, because of schools being out and the possible oncoming weather we got out at 12... nice.  Packed up Tobey, went to mom's, lost power at 6, ate by candlelight, put a puzzle together by candlelight, tried to set up my sister's computer for a dvd but her batery died right away, talked to people who made it sound like power might be on at my apartment, packed up tobey again and drove back to Manassas around 9.  Had power and watched dvds till I fell asleep.  Friday, woke up to Kim calling to see if work was going on since she didn't have power.  Called Jess and found out we were opening at 10.  Went into work, they bought lunch for everyone who showed up and then got out at 3:30.  Friday night I drove out to see someone and came home by 10:30.  Exciting so far huh?  It gets better...  Saturday, spent the day doing nothing... had plans for that night... person backed out on me by leaving a message on my cell phone and never gave a reason so after calling around and trying to find friends to hang with and finding they were all already out and about I decided to drink myself into a stupor.  And when Erin gets drunk and sad it's never a good thing... fortunately Bret took a moment to cheer me up which was a nice surprise.  Sunday... I woke up LATE!!!!  Got in my car and went over to my dad's to feed the birds and fish and then headed to Borders to pick up a new pilates dvd.  I've been using the same one for over 4 months now and it's no longer challenging for me.  We'll come back to the dvd later.  Then when I got home I decided for some reason to be productive.  I had set the challenge of cleaning the entire apartment but never got there.  I decided since my room is friggin huge I needed to take better advantage of it and decided to create more open space.  So I started by clearing off my shelving unit next to my bed and moved it out of the way and then decided to shift my entire bed into a new direction and push it way up against the wall.  Doesn't sound so difficult right?  This is what I thought.  My mattress is made of air, it's a select comfort and is much like the nautilus mattress you see advertised... it's all air.  Seemed like it would be a piece of cake.  Wrong.  My bed frame is cast iron.  Cast iron is heavy... it took me like half an hour and tons of bruises to move the bed but damn did I feel like I accomplished something when it was done.  Then came the restructuring of the shelving unit and the deep cleaning of my room.  I moved the stereo, moved the lamps and then picked up EVERYTHING.  I currently have a massive pile of clothes to be ironed (they've been on the floor of my room for weeks) and clothes to be laundered.  Well by now the laundry is almost done, the ironing hasn't been touched however.  Because after the room was cleaned I decided to wash the sheets and blankets on my bed, threw those in and decided it would be a good time to clean my bathroom.  Went in there and picked up (deep cleaning will happen tomorrow).  Then got the bright idea to do my pilates so I could then take a much needed shower!  I figured it would be a bit harder but not by much, I didn't get the advanced pilates or anything.  Now that it's over and I struggled through the whole thing can I tell you I HAD NO IDEA HOW MANY MUSCLES I HAD IN MY STOMACH, ARMS, and LEGS!!!  They all hurt, every single one of them!  Oh my God I am in pain!  Taking a shower even hurt.  Well this put me right in time for the Survivor rerun which Ben kindly told me about yesterday!  I missed it the first time cause of the power outage in Fairfax.  So I watched it.  It was good stuff!  Picked my favorite team right away and have decided for right now I was correct in chosing them!  OWWW my arms hurt from typing this.  Now Leigh and I are trying to decide which Phish shows to hit this upcoming season!  See, what an exciting weekend but damn was I productive.  Dishes got done, cooked dinner, did pilates and my room looks awesome!  I couldn't ask for more!  By the way, Bill's (my uncle) house is just fine!  A couple leaves scattered in the front yard and that's it.  Isabel hit Nags Head hard but thankfully took pitty on my uncle's house.  Also my uncle is making an amazing recovery!  YAY!!!!  I will go down next weekend or the weekend after.  I feel bad for Hatteras and the rest of Kitty Hawk.  Also my dad's boat is fine, didn't get touched.  So for once everything seems to be going well and I am grateful for that!  Now I think I am going to bed to prepare for the full week of work I have waiting for me.

      I am going straight to hell... some of us know the reason why....  By the way I made it through Isabel, it was such overkill anyway.  Went out to mom's yesterday, packed up tobey and took him with me.  I figured if I lost power at least I could actually hang out with someone other than my dog.  But the thing is the more I talked to people on the phone after we lost power out there I figured there was a good chance I still had power at my apartment.  So I packed up my dog yet again and drove back to the apartment and have been hanging out with lights and dvds ever since.  My cable modem and cable television finally came back on so now I am completely back up and running.

       Site of the Day:    urlLink Musicnotes.com   This site won't help everyone but for those looking for sheet music quickly for almost any popular instrument... this is the one to go with....  It has the option to not only mail the hard copy or you can download the music right there to your computer and instantly have it for print.  This kind of thing saves you when you are desperately trying to record an audition tape for a certain school and the song you were planning on just isn't coming out right.  So you run to the computer and look up a completely different song and record it and it comes out AWESOME... not that many people have this problem.... but still.  It's worth a look for all you amatuer singers, pianists, and guitarists out there....

       Site of the Day:    urlLink Reflect   This is for all the chicks out there, or even the guys if you're interested.  This site is awesome, I use them all the time.  You can customize all your own makeup, face wash, etc.  They ask you a bunch of questions but I can't say that I have ever received a product that wasn't perfect for me.  You just go to the website and customize whatever product you would like and then give over your credit card and it's arriving at your house within a week.  Granted it's not instant gratification but if you are as busy as I am this is definitely the way to go.  And to be honest with you the prices are not any worse then hitting the makeup counter at the local mall even with the shipping (which there is none if you order enough.)  So check it out, see what you think and once you start you'll also began receiving emails about all the great deals they offer or free gifts they're giving away with certain purchases.  Just check it out and see what you think!

       Site of the Day:    urlLink BuyMusic.com   Most people know about itunes for apple users, however in light of the recent troubles with Kazaa and other file sharing programs new alternatives need to be found.  This is a site I have to come to use as a PC user (itunes for PC users will be released later this year but until then this is the best alternative) to download cheap and legal music.  You can download by song or download by album.  I have recently purchased three albums at $9.99 each instead of paying the $12.99 to $18.99 they would've cost me in the store.  Songs I believe are anywhere between $0.79 to $1.79.  I personally love this site, although I enjoy itunes much more and will probably switch to them when the PC version comes out.  Just go to the website and read the step by step processes.  You can download the music, open up a program such as Windows Media Player and burn your cd right from there.  It's cost effective and more importantly it's legal!  The RIAA will not be coming after you for using this one.  And in my opinion the best part is you can download and have it right away without having to even get in your car.  Couldn't hurt to check out and unless you are addicted to the space consuming jewel cases with the liner notes it is a nice alternative.

       Site of the Day:    urlLink The Smoking Gun   I have decided I am going to start putting up cool sites I find.  Today's cool site is The Smoking Gun.  They always have very interesting articles for example as many know I am a true fan of Survivor, God only knows why, and there are many interesting (and incriminating) facts on several of the cast members of the upcoming Survivor season.  But even if you dislike the Survivor show there are all kinds of incriminating discoveries on various people.  It's not a useful site but it is entertaining.  So if you're bored, check it out.

       Site of the Day:    urlLink itunes   The Apple music store finally made a windows version and it's awesome.  All singles are $0.99 and most albums are anywhere from $9.99 to $14.99 depending on the album.  I love this far more than buymusic.com.  The difference is the layout and since it's a downloadable program it gathers all your mp3 files and becomes it's own player and it's own cd burner as well.  Check it out and be on the lookout for the new napster coming out as well.

       Site of the Day:    urlLink Charlotte Martin   Charlotte is as Anna and I refer to her "a sane Tori Amos."    She's great and a huge talent but right now you can only get her cd with around four songs on it.  I think she's well worth it.  I highly recommend checking out  urlLink Amazon's  used cds for smaller releases like this.  You can get them far cheaper than you can even on  urlLink buymusic.com's site.   Granted you have to wait longer to receive it since buymusic is instantaneous download and amazon is shipped but I think it's worth it....  A while ago I heard her on some radio station and she was singing her "I'm normal please date me" song which cracks me up and then when I saw her last week when she opened for Howie Day she impressed the hell out of me.  Especially since I had no interest in seeing either of the bands playing before him.  I only wish she had gone on before Howie Day instead of Jump, Little Children who I was not all that impressed with.  So anyway, I would check her out... it's a chick and a piano and she's friggin talented.

       Movie Reviews:    urlLink School Of Rock   This movie was cute but it wasn't terribly funny.  I have to admit that the kids made the movie far more than Jack Black did, which is unfortunate since I love Jack Black.  It's about this guy, Dewey Finn, who gets kicked out of the band he put together because of his lavish ways while playing onstage.  Now I have to interject and say a nice surprise was to see that Adam Pascal was fronting this band.  For those of you who don't know who Adam Pascal is, he is a very talented singer who has taken Broadway by storm... he owned and made famous the role of Roger in Rent and he also kicked off the role of Rodames in Elton John and Tim Rice's AIDA.  He's done a small performance in the great movie SLC Punk although he doesn't sing.  But here he is singing in a movie and I LOVE IT!  That being said... now back to the slightly lame movie.  So Dewey gets kicked out of the band and he has to pay rent.  So his roommate is a substitute teacher and after leaving for work one day Dewey takes a call that a prep school needs a substitute on an emergency basis.  Of course Dewey poses as Ned (the roommate) and goes to substitute.  He's bored out of his mind and these kids are uber overachievers.  So he hears them in their music class and of course a couple of them are prodigys and he gets the idea that he wants to go up in the battle of the bands that his original band was preparing for, using these kids.  So he gets his kids together and they spend their days learning rock.  He teaches one of them how to use her larger than life annoying personality to become the band manager, he teaches some of the non-musical kids to be security and groupies.  He engages one kid's talents to do the light show and create a multimedia presentation, he teaches one kid with stage fright because she's worried that people will laugh at her because she's fat that talent supercedes weight.  It's got a few hidden good messages and you find yourself smiling through the end but I have to tell you the laughs are few and far between.  I love Jack Black but he needs to just stick to doing ensemble work when there is someone else to help carry the movie.  Just my opinion.    urlLink Underworld   I dug this movie.  It's basically the continuation of a war that has been raging for centuries between the Lycans, which is another name for Warewolves, and the Vampires.  Celine, a vampire, is the main character of the story and she discovers that the Warewolf leader that she thought was killed according to Vampire lore is very much alive.  Celine discovers that the Warewolves are stalking humans to turn and place on their side.  She finds they are stalking specific lines of humans and one of these is Michael.  Celine, played by Kate Beckinsale, is beautiful and is quite the poster child for goth while Michael, played by Scott Speedman, is gorgeous and is a confused human who is bitten by one of the Lycans.  Celine and Michael have an instant attraction and Celine keeps Michael safe from the Lycan clan as well as Kraven the leader of the vampires who wants Celine and therefore wants Michael dead.  The plot itself is not that revolutionary but it's just a fun and beautifully done.  It's a ton of action and more fight scenes then dialogue but I have to say it was just a fun movie and I very much enjoyed it.

      I struggle a great deal with the tangible in life and with the ability to sometimes feel too much.  I can't always comprehend why reality is, well simply that, reality.  I find myself retreating into my imagination because to be perfectly honest sometimes life is too overwhelming.  Someone once told me that I was too delicate for my own good.  I don't have the appearance of a delicate woman, I don't have the shape or the size to fit that mold and the saying was let go.  But for whatever reason I am revisiting the moment in which this was said to me and I think I finally understand.  My heart, be it not shown very often, is too delicate for my own good.  Not to be taken literally of course, it beats over and over again healthy and somewhat new, but I do not handle heartache very well.  Perhaps then, I am a complexity in and of itself.  Perhaps then I am not the right vessel for this "heart" simply because I am a beacon for the dramatic, I begin what I simply cannot end.  My "heart" can not handle the situations I rapidly throw myself into or simply attract by the personality I've adapted.  Perhaps this is why I shelter it so often or hide it from so many.  Perhaps this is why I push away when someone begins to affect it too greatly.  I'm not sure of the reason or the end result but I do know that I follow a pattern I wish I could reject.  Reality can be too overwhelming for me, too painful to endure.  I find myself wishing for the simple and in my imagination the simple is proactive and for all purposes... real. ~Erin

      "I dreamed we were there. The plane leapt the tropopause, the safe air, and attained the outer rim, the ozone, which was ragged and torn, patches of it threadbare as old cheesecloth, and that was frightening... But I saw something that only I could see, because of my astonishing ability to see such things: Souls were rising, from the earth far below, souls of the dead, of people who had perished, from famine, from war, from the plague, and they floated up, like skydivers in reverse, limbs all akimbo, wheeling and spinning. And the souls of these departed joined hands, clasped ankles, and formed a web, a great net of souls, and the souls were three-atom oxygen molecules, of the stuff of ozone, and the outer rim absorbed them, and was repaired. Nothing's lost forever. In this world, there's a kind of painful progress. Longing for what we've left behind, and dreaming ahead. At least I think that's so. ---from Angels in America: A Gay Fantasia on National Themes, part two, Perestroika by Tony Kushner.     "In this world, there's a kind of painful progress.

      Okay so I know it's been a short while since I last actually wrote anything.  I've been busy as many of you know.  I was intending to go to Boston this weekend and put some of my anxiety to rest but unfortunately for me the snow made it impossible to make it there and back in a timely manner so here I am at my computer on a Sunday when I should be on my way back from Boston.  Telle est la vie.  But I guess the new plan is to make the run next weekend.  I feel bad cause I have to completely rearrange plans but I need to see my new home.  I am honestly getting very scared right now and my anxiety attacks are coming on a regular basis.  So I think going up there and seeing my new home and where I'll be living will be really great for me and maybe help to calm my nerves just a bit.  So I will try and keep up with this thing a little better to keep you all informed of this major change in my life.  I know that people have been complaining that there haven't been too many updates recently and this is their everyday link into my life.  So I promise to try harder.

      So let me tell you about last night... Tyla's parents came into town and took all of us out to dinner at a fairly nice restaurant and it was a great change of pace from my rice and noodle dinner I have been living off of lately.  I actually got to have salmon again.  They were the nicest people.  And I got to hang out with John and Abby again whom I met last week and they were fantasticly fun!  Then there was Tyla's roommate Meghan and her boyfriend Jeff.  The cool thing about Jeff is that he is actually from Annandale Virginia and so we discovered we knew many of the same people and that he was best friends with someone I went to church with forever, Dana.  It was nice to be able to talk to someone about things I knew about as opposed to just listening to people go on and on about things and places I've never had any knowledge of.  But anyway, so we go back to Tyla's apartment and drop off Meghan and Jeff and the rest of us make our way to the BU area of town.  We head to the Whitehorse which was fun and then left to go to The Kels, also fun.  At the Kels Tyla meets this guy, Kevin, who claims to know someone Abby knows and we're chatting with his friend and him and it's obvious Tyla likes the boy.  The next thing I know we are leaving and I hear we are going to this party that Kevin knows about.  Whatever.  So we drive Kevin to his car and Tyla decides to go with him, so we're driving now behind him in Abby's car to someplace that he says is like 2 blocks away.  Next thing I know we're pulling into some chinease restaurant parking lot and we're turning around.  We drive around and finally Kevin pulls into a store 24 and he is on the phone while John and I are in the car next to him and Tyla and Abby are in the store.  We both have our windows down because despite my quitting smoking I suffer set backs when drinking.  And low and behold Kevin is telling whomever he's talking to that he's on the way but has no idea where he is going and he's going on and on to some girl that he only wants to hang out with her.  So we go finally to this house and we pull up and get out.  Abby, John and I are sketched out right away but we go in against our better judgement.  I find a bathroom and when I come out everyone is outside and I go out and it is decided we are leaving.  So then we drive to Abby's friend's house not far from where I live.  At this point I am thinking that I am going to stay at Abby's house that night for lack of having something easier to do.  So we're at this friend's house and we're hanging out drinking, having a very good time but it is getting very late so we decide to go.  John, who is driving Abby's car, agrees to drive me home so as we're driving home I finally check my watch for like the first time that night and it's 4:00 in the morning.  God help me, so I roll into bed and fall asleep and then wake up sometime around seven a.m. craving water but instead I roll over and fall back asleep thinking I'd sleep a couple more hours... then I wake up at 2 in the afternoon and other than talking to Eric and my Mom on the phone I basically spend the whole day in my pajamas reading magazines and watching television.... productive day I guess....

       The Grind   So I watched The Grind yesterday because lately I have found myself obsessed with all things Adam Brody, the least of which is The O.C.  (See previous posting from before seeing the show when I ragged on what I thought was going to be another 90210 deal.  But it's so not and I am hooked.)  Anyway, so Adam Brody is in this movie, he is Dustin, best friend to Eric.  Eric is played by Mike Vogel (also in MTV's Wurthering Heights and I also believe the new version of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre).  Eric is on a mission to get noticed, he is an exceptionally good skateboarder in the midst of mediocrity and with no sponsor.  He involves his best friends (one trying to go to college, one trying to get away from a girl's father, and one who seems just psycho and willing to follow Eric anywhere) in a scheme to get noticed by following pro skater Jimmy on his tour.  By the way, Jimmy is played by Jason London.  So anyway, they go on this road trip and get shot down time and time again but continue on their way to gain sponsorship and go pro.  I thought this movie was very funny and it was just fun in general.  It was slightly generic and very predictable but I laughed most of the time and the music playing throughout the movie was great.  Anyway, for those of you who have coulrophobia... be very worried because there is a whole scene with people in a school of this nature.....

      So I finished my first day of school... technically it was just orientation and I bailed before it was even over.  I got the packet of stuff I needed to know for my entrance exams and for my entrance audition and decided to take the T home.  I managed to make it through yet another day without a cigarette but it was pretty difficult today.  I saw everyone outside the main building smoking where I used to smoke and I wanted one so badly I had to go across the street and buy a pack of gum just so I had something to chew on.  But it was driving me crazy.  Anyway, so there isn't much to tell, at one point today it felt like spring weather, but it wasn't really since it was just barely above 30 degrees but in comparison to the weather we've been having it was gorgeous.  Then of course I come out of one of the meetings for orientation to find it snowing and that the weather dropped significantly.  Damn it.  And it's just dropping from there.  I hear we'll be back below 0 soon enough.  Anyway, I need to get back to rehearsing and then get to bed, I have to get up early in the morning.  Wish me luck!

      They are saying there is a really good chance we  might get above 32 degrees tomorrow but if we don't we won't see the thirties again until maybe next thursday and that's a big IF!  On top of that we're looking at setting records again but dropping around 40 degrees in a couple of hours time on Tuesday evening to go back down below 0.  SOMEONE, ANYONE, GIVE ME A GOOD REASON WHY I MOVED HERE???????????!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

      I just made the best rice ever!  And I managed to cut the vegitables without a cutting board and a decent knife (all of this was before I looked over and remembered that I had the chopper which I completely forgot about).  Since, aparently, we only have one frying pan and one spatula (sp?) I managed to fry an egg with butter on one side of the pan while making grilled onions and peppers on the other side with a little oil.  Then I was able to get all the water out of the pot without a lid or a strainer AND finally was able to mix it all up in the pan without the rice searing itself to the pan itself.  I feel so proud... and a little sad... I miss my good knives, my multiple pots and pans, my cutting boards.....

      I think I dreamed about three or four different people from Carteret last night, it was the oddest thing.  I remember dreaming about planning Robin Truba's wedding, she was renewing her vows but she wanted it to be better than the first time around.  At some point the cops show up and pull Bobby from their back seat and he tells me that he's been wrongfully accused (I don't think it was ever determined what for) and because of this my sister has to drive me down to the police station where on the way back we have to stop off at a bank where Crossett works because aparently she's having some secret affair with him and she's thinking of leaving her husband for him.  But when inside, even though I am outside waiting and pissed off about it cause it's cold (even though it's a summer outdoor wedding I was just planning) I can see Caitlin crying and freaking out which makes me believe that Crossett was telling her that he loves his wife (whom aparently he got married to just before showing up to work) and wants to end the thing with Caitlin.  I don't know what happened because the next thing I know I am back at the wedding which is just beginning and I am taking pictures of all the bridesmaids.  Sherrell was one of them and she kept wanting to look at the pictures of her while she was up there during the ceremony.  I kept telling her to go away and I would show her after the ceremony was over.  I can't remember anything after this, I think I finally woke up....  Peapod delivers this morning between 10-12 and I need to be awake for it!

       urlLink What Theme Song Are You?    Independent Woman   You could fit right in with Charlie's Angels themselves. When "Independent Woman" is cranking, your smooth and powerful groove announces your entrance to any event and nothing can get in your way. Maybe you're balancing school, sports, and a job. Or maybe you're seriously thinking about your career. Any way you slice it, you are a modern woman. When your song comes on the car radio, you turn it up and tell your passengers to hang on—you have a statement to make and a song to sing. You're a lass with sass, and plenty of sauce. Some of your girlfriends might not understand why you pay your own way on dates sometimes. But it makes sense to you. You can't be categorized by the usual labels. Hey, you've got your priorities straight and being dependent on someone all of the time is not one of them. And while strangers might be surprised enough to say, "Girl I didn't know you could get down like that," no one else is, 'cause you've proven your righteousness time and time again.

      You know what the coolest thing about living in Boston today is?  All the football news isn't about the Redskins or Joe Gibbs, it's about the Pats... and you know what else is cool?  It's okay for me to love a team that's not the Redskins, since we all know my feelings on them, and I do happen to like the Patriots... SO BRING IT!  I have to go watch the game soon and actually cheer for my home team :)

      Ah, so if anyone reads this and then talks to Susan P tell her that her heated mattress pad is the BEST GIFT EVER!  I was so warm last night and I loved it!  I was so comfy I went to bed at 11 p.m. (everyone stop your shock, I went to bed before midnight) and I didn't wake up until noon.

      2004 Oscars running tab (Just cause I'm bored and have nothing else to do):  (Billy Crystal should always do the Oscars....)  Catherine Zeta-Jones looked beautiful and very un-pregnant, I just hope I have as much money has her when I need to lose the fat after a baby Best Supporting Actor - Tim Robbins (Mystic River) loved the end of his speech about all victims of abuse getting help!  (And by the way, the commercials during the Oscars are very much outshining the Superbowl's commercials... what do you have to say about that?)  Love Ian McKellan - hate the hair cut Love Return of the King - my favorite front runner, although I love all the movies this year  Angelina Jolie - still one of my favorite actresses - looked amazing... and happy for once Art Direction (they should do this during the pre-awards show - I know they all deserve credit but your average viewer doesn't give a crap - I hope my mother never reads this....) - Grant Major (LOTR Return of the King) Three guys speaking... don't care... get off the stage  Billy Crystal and small man hiding behind him... ROBIN WILLIAMS!  Love him.  Cracking me up! Best Animated Feature - Finding Nemo (I am writing this before they announce the winner so I could be wrong...) I WAS SO RIGHT!!! HAHA!!! I AM A GENIUS!!!  Love Andrew Stanton - loved him playing Crush.... Loved that movie... I need to buy that movie....  Missed a few things... Pizza came....  Rene looks great - Costume design - LOTR Return of the King  In case anyone was wondering... this pizza is really good  Nicolas Cage looks... like he always does Saw Master and Commander on the plane to L.A., it was okay... decent, Russell Crowe is always really good but I am really glad his arrogant ass wasn't nominated this year  Chris Cooper - weird guy - good actor Best Supporting Actress - Rene Zellweger (Cold Mountain) was her dress cutting off her circulation?  Cause she sounded out of breath the entire speech  Tom Hanks... love him... love him... love him... Is this a tribute to Bob Hope to the Forrest Gump theme?  Interesting... and a tear jerker....  LOVE OWEN AND BEN TOGETHER!!!!   Best Live Action Short... again... who the hell cares.... Two Soldiers....  Alan Silvestri worked on this?  I love him... amazing movie composer.... Haha!  First guy to get kicked off stage with music... AND... the other guy never got to speak... and did he do some mention of war or something... I hate that....  Still Owen and Ben... still funny... Best Animation Short - Harvie Krumpet (don't care) Oh he thanked his boyfriend... I love that....  Liv Tyler has looked better Allison Kraus looks awesome, sounds awesome, Sting looks and sounds awesome and I assume is actually playing the instrument in his hand and not just moving his hand around next to it... not quite sure what it is... it looks like a ukelele (sp?) but not.... (song from Cold Mountain) Okay... another song from Cold Mountain... and sung again by Allison Kraus... with Elvis Costello (not singing) and some chick doing harmonies.... very pretty but if I wanted to hear all of this I would've bought the soundtrack.... but definitely the first time (at least that I can remember) that mechanism was fit into a song... and stood out... and sounded bad.... mechanism is just not one of those words you put in a ballad Annie Lennox - Into the Mist (LOTR - Return of the King) - beautiful song, beautiful voice, ugly woman....scary woman  Mrs. Billy Crystal... so funny....  Will and Jada Pinket Smith - beautiful and beautiful Special Effects - LOTR - Return of the King  Jennifer Garner - Looks awesome... too bad the new boyfriend isn't around cause he's way hotter! Running through winners of scientific and technical awards.... boring.... did it on Valentines Day... how lame  Jim Carrey is on the stage at the Oscars... have I missed this before???  Oh my God, he's talking about his sister having sex...  ok, I usually find Jim Carrey to be funny but he seems nervous and like a fish out of water on this stage...  Oh.... Breakfast at Tiffanys.... I love Audrey... my favorite movie... whoever this Blake Edwards is... I now love him because he was somehow associated with Breakfast at Tiffanys.  Bill Murray... funny... introduced nominated film Lost in Translation  Scarlett Johansen (sp?) looks fantastic... best makeup or something.... LOTR - Return of the King Again, two guys babbling... don't care... bored... get off the stage  Sandra Bullock and John Travolta dancing onto the stage - Sound Mixing - LOTR - Return of the King Normally I would say I don't care much about this but the truth is I am studying composing and sound mixing from the composer's aspect in Intro to Film Scoring... so this is kind of interesting to me... especially since we just finished studying the music and sound mixing in the first LOTR movie Sound Editing - actually Sandra and John are kind of amusing together - again, this is a category I find slightly interesting... Richard King, Master and Commander - Far Side of the World...  Billy Crystal - It's official, there is no one left in New Zealand to thank.... :)  Julia Roberts looks awesome... as usual  Oh it's the dead people reel.  I hate to say it like this cause the reel always brings a tear to my eye but still, you can't go through an Oscar show without the dead people reel.... okay is this a dead people reel of Katherine Hepburn... what about all the other dead people?  Where are they?  Aren't they just as important?  "All my life I've stayed at parties because I didn't know when it was time to go...."  I like that line.  I like Kathryn... I don't know why I've always compared her to Audrey, probably because of the last name, but I do like Kathryn.... okay aparently there will not be more of the dead people honored....  Oprah... Goddess and future president... and a woman I wish I knew... introducing Mystic River.... and just reaffirming my faith that she is one of the most articulate women I've ever heard speak  Diane Lane and OH YAY - JOHN CUSACK!!! LOVE HIM!!!  And he looks adorable... as he always does...  Best Documentary Short Subject - Chernobyl Heart  Naomi Watts and Alec Baldwin - Naomi looks great... haven't decided my opinion on her though... Alec is one of the best actors I think... he can play almost anything.... Best Documentary Feature - The Fog of War  President of Oscar Association.... messing up his speech.... boring.... move on.... New Dead People Reel...  Gregory Peck, Wendy Hiller, David Hemmings, Hope Lange, George Axelrod, Charles Bronson, Michael Jeter, David Newman, Ron O'Neal, Art Carney, Elia Kazan, Leni Riefenstahl, Karen Morley, Buddy Ebsen, John Schlesinger, Stan Brakhage, Ray Stark, Andrew J. Kuehn, John Ritter, Hume Cronyn, Buddy Hacket, Michael Kamen, John Greggory Dune, Robert Stack, Alan Bates, Gregory Hines, Jack Elam, Jeanne Crain, Ann Miller, Donald O'Connor.... phew.... that took some effort to do that so quickly....  Tiger Woods and Caddyshack Gopher takeoff commercial... quite humorous... I like it...   Sting and Phil Collins... this should make good South Park material later.... Ooooh Best Original Score... I love this category... Howard Shore better win, that's all I have to say.... WOOOHOOOO!!!!  HOWARD SHORE BABY!!! LOVE HIM!!!  BERKLEE ALUMNI!!! LOVE IT!!!!  And that was before they had a film scoring department.... none of you know the kind of pressure film composers go through... as much as I love the idea I don't think I could do it.... I would crack under the pressure.... they, if they are lucky, might have two weeks to compose and entire film's music....  Pierce Brosnan and Julianne Moore... ehhh... like them.... Film Editing - LOTR - Return of the King  Jamie Lee Curtis... dad's probably gone to bed but if he hasn't he might be very happy right now because it looks like Jamie's boobs are about to pop out of her dress.... Mighty Wind's A Kiss At the End of the Rainbow... nominated Song.... Eugene Levy and Catherine O Hara.... playing their characters Mitch and Mickey.... I liked A Mighty Wind... I kind of like this song... it sounds like something I might sing my kid to sleep with.... if I had a kid.... little William or little Arden.... in my big house with my recording studio in the building next to the house on my Malibu Beachfront lot... oh right, we're talking about the Oscars... not my fantasy world.... I didn't know that Annette O'Toole and Michael McKeon had written this... that explains why I saw them at the Grammys with Eugene Levy... Annette looks gorgeous by the way... much better than she does on Smallville... although I love her on that too.... Bellville Ron de Vu?  I have no idea how to spell this - from the Triplets of Bellville (animated film) fun song... never heard it before... not sure who is singing it.... ok.... I hope this doesn't win.... just cause as much as I like the tune I don't understand a word she is saying and I hate that because I think she is singing in english... it would be one thing if she were singing in french....  Oooh Will Ferrel and Jack Black are coming up!  yay!  Oh a shot of John Cusack giggling at Jack Black on stage... priceless... love him  Oh my God I am cracking up!  Jack Black and Will Ferrel singing the words to the song that cuts off your too long speech... oh this was too funny... Oooh I am crying that was so funny... love them.... Best Original Song - Into the West (LOTR - Return of the King) Howard Shore (YAY!) and Annie Lennox and some chick I don't remember..... Fran Walsh, that is her name.... oh the bastard music director tried to not let Fran Walsh speak... asshole.  Also, I loved that Annie Lennox thanked Michael Kamen... another amazing Film Composer.  Charlize actually doesn't look as good as she normally does.  I think it's the fact that her hair looks like a frizzy triangle Best Foreign Language Film - Barbarian Invasions.... haha... the woman who is speaking is happy LOTR wasn't an option for winning that category...  Uma Thurman and Jude Law.... Just get Uma off the stage... I just want to stare and listen to Jude... what is this category again?  Who cares.... oh Jude is going to leave the stage... wait... Jude... I love you... Come back!.... Cinematography (sp?) - Master and Commander And by the way, what the freak is Uma wearing... did she lose all fashion sense when she and Ethan called it quits?  BRING JUDE BACK!    Tobey Maguire is coming up!  My dog's namesake!  Or not actually my dog anymore.... ok, now I'm gonna cry, I miss Tobey so much.... think of happier things... God Dammit!  Okay, better now, kind of...Jude Law, Jude LAw, Jude Law, Jude Law.... goddammit, now they are shoing a commercial about a lost dog taking a trip across America and finally getting home to it's owners.... DAMMIT!  How is this supposed to make me stop crying?  BASTARD TELEVISION!  I miss my puppy....  Alias and the Practice are all new next Sunday... that makes me a bit happier....  Sophia and Francis Ford Coppola (probably butchered that name too) father and daughter team... playing off of The Godfather... Okay, Sophia should never be a public speaker Best Adapted Screenplay - LOTR - Return of the King  TOBEY!!! Not crying... Tobey Maguire... not my dog... I love his voice... I don't know why but I do.... Introducing Seabiscuit... loved that movie... although Tobey looks bad with the red hair....  Tim Robbins and Susan Surrandon - Love them as a couple - love them both individually... Best Original Screenplay - I do know that LOTR will not win this as they are not nominated :) - Sophia Copola (Lost in Translation)  Nic Cage, I don't think I have ever seen him look that happy before... and her father is so proud!    Okay, this is when the thing needs to just wind down... it's done...  I like this photo commercial with Martin Scorsece (butchered that name)   Tom Cruise... with Nicole Kidman right in the front... nice.... I think Tom is a great actor, like his movies, do not like him.... Best Director - Peter Jackson (LOTR - Return of the King) Awesome!  So excited!  I love him!  I loved the movie!    Adrian Brody... no kissing Halle Berry tonight... like his acting... don't know what else I think about it... haha, restraining order jokes are funny.... loved the binaca move... Adrian is good at making fun of himself... ok I like him.... Best Actress - Charlize Theron (love her!)  So happy for her.  I haven't seen the movie yet but I have heard nothing but good things about her performance.  Oh, and I like it when they tear up... although the Halle Berry crying fest was possibly WAY too much!  Oh!  I loved her speech!  That was the best speech!  I teared up too much when she thanked her mom... if I ever won an Oscar or Grammy or what-have-you I would thank my mom the same way....  Nichole Kidman looks wonderful as usual.... Best Actor... I want Johnny Depp to win although I know someone else will get it.  Ben Kingsley will probably get it, or Bill Murray, oh... Jude Law wouldn't be so bad either but as much as I love him I sitll want Johnny Depp to get it over him... WHAT IS WRONG WITH ME?  And Sean Penn was good but I didn't think he was amazing... he kind of paled in comparison to how good Tim Robbins was. Best Actor - Sean Penn - okay so the guy has been nominated four times.... oh JUDE AND JOHNNY ARE STANDING FOR HIM!  I love it!  I love them!  I guess it's okay that he won.  I find it endearing that he didn't write a speech and at the same time annoying... you at least need guidelines, just a few notes... then there aren't any awkward pauses...  Steven Spielberg (butchered name?) - I just love him.  This man could come out, tell everyone to fuck off, and I would still love him.... Best Motion Picture - LOTR better win.... that's all I have to say.... WHOOOOHOOOOO I WIN!!!!!  They took the gold!  11 Oscars that night!  Tied the record with Titanic and Ben Hur!!!  Love it!!!  Love the movie!!!  So happy they won!  Now I feel vindicated that I stayed up and watched this whole award show all friggin night....  Have they had the winners flood the stage at the end before?  Did I just miss this in past years?  Interesting...  Well whatever... goodnight... I am going to bed....

      So funny thing... last night started out a simple night, I was going to go see Passion of the Christ with friends and that was it.  Cheap, simple, easy...  So then as I am getting ready to go out Colman calls to says that the movie is sold out so maybe we'll just go grab a beer somewhere.  Okay, still can be simple and easy.  So I grab the T to Fenway and order a cosmo... Vodka used to be my devil drink but lately I have gone back to it with no problems... so that right there was the first mistake.  So three cosmos later and I am hammered... beyond hammered.  I don't know what happened.  I have never ever had the problems I had that night over three drinks especially three Cosmos.  I guess we ended up at a party after aparently I talked to Tyla on the phone.  I stayed at the party while the guys I came with left.  I don't remember the party, I don't remember the cab ride home and I don't remember getting into bed last night.  The few blurry moments I think might have happened (and I am not even sure about that) feel like a movie I watched and forgot.  It's insane.  It's almost like someone spiked my drink with something although I am about 99% sure that didn't happen.  Three drinks... had dinner before... someone explain why I cannot remember my night and why I have the biggest nastiest bruise I have ever had on the side of my arm.  Then of course there was the hangover all through work and I was opening.  The worst of it was it was the first time I was actually working with the store manager who just returned from leave.  AND... I had to lie and tell her I was getting a cold.  I went home and now I am in bed still nursing my hangover at 10:18 at night.... God help me....

      I watched the SATC from two weeks ago (the one before the finale) and there is this moment when Carrie looks at her friends and says the quote below.  So of course this makes me think of you and because I am a glutton for pain I call... in case you weren't aware... you're a prick... just thought I'd remind you one more time.

      To those of you who are doubting yourself and wondering if anyone out there loves you... and you know who you are... I do.  I have loved you since we first became friends back in high school and I will love you forever.  We're friends, best friends and that will never change in my heart and my mind.  So stop friggin doubting yourself and start focusing on your amazing qualities and everything that makes me want to be around you. I adore you and even when we don't talk and even when we don't see each other you are on my mind.  You're my family, you may not be blood but you will eternally be part of my family and I adore you.  Always remember that.

      So today is a good day....  I clearly aced my quarterly exam today in Ear Training, I correctly answered the solfege question in my harmony class (which is 9 times out of ten answered incorrectly to put it in perspective for you) and my three o'clock ensemble was cancelled.  So here I am watching movies and hanging out till I get ready for the party I am going to tonight.  By the way, I want to know who put this one together... we're dealing with a beach party in Boston in the middle of February.  It's not like I am going to wear my flip flips on the T in February.... looks like I have to plan for this one.  Oh and one more thing.  I just finished Runaway Jury and I really liked it.  Of course I always like John Grisham movies.

      Questions people have been asking me:  1) Do I like Cambridge: Yes I like Cambridge very much.  It's a bitch living by mass transit and away from my friends and school and work but I love my condo so it makes up for the rest.  2) Do I have friends?:  Yes I have a few, not many, but there is Tyla who reminds me of a younger Toni and there is Mike who cracks me up, plus I love hearing his girl problems.  Mike is good with the one liners.  Then there is all the people I am meeting through them as well as Erika who I work with.  I think I am going out with her this week for the first time.  She's gonna show me around.  Truth is I have a lot of school friends who I talk to in classes and hang with in between but don't ever see outside of the school setting.  3) Am I cold?: Not so much anymore.  4) How is school?:  Fine.  Some classes I am bored in and some fascinate me.  Needless to say that midterms are coming up and that will pretty much be the first indicator of how I am doing.  I have a quarterly exam in my ear training class on Friday which I need to study for.  Maybe I'll also go use a practice room for the hour before....  But I love everything I can put my hands into at this school.  I forgot about all the resources.  It's amazing what I have access to and the things that I do in class.  Got my first gig this past week.  5) How were the grammy's?:  Fantastic, miss the warm weather the most.  6) When am I coming home?:  March 15 - March 21 will be the first time I am home  7) My question for you!:  When are you coming to visit????  :)

      These are very edited pieces from my journal and with the parts I took out (due to feelings I feel should not be available for everyone to read) I didn't mention in this about all the people we had all met and seen people like: Rob Thomas, Madonna, Prince, Shannon Elizabeth, Dale Earnhardt Jr., Melanie Griffith, Antonio Banderas, Quincy Jones, and so many others.  I can't think back that far right now and I need to get back into my homework anyway.  2/7/04  - 3:37 AM  So I have been fairly worried about this Grammy trip for a while now.  Things just seemed to go wrong all over the place and the closer it got the more I wanted to cancel.  But because it was a gift there wasn’t really an option for that.  So anyway I spent the entire week before telling all of my professors that I would be gone for classes and where I would be and their excitement got me excited so I was very much looking forward to it.  Then on Wednesday Susan called to confirm that she was in fact going to come with me and Wendi called to confirm she was going to drive to meet me on Saturday.  So everything seemed to be going well.  I went to bed that night and set my alarms although I tossed and turned till about three in the morning.  I finally fell asleep knowing that my flight left at the crack of dawn but also knowing that it was going to be a long flight and I could sleep then.  So don’t ask what happened because I don’t know but the next thing I knew I was hearing Sam’s alarm across the hall going off (the same alarm that annoys me every other day) and I woke up to check the clock.  It was funny cause I felt so rested and thought how strange that was.  I had set my alarm so that I would wake up at 6:15 AM at the latest.  I looked at the clock and it was 9 AM.  I freaked out.  My flight had left about ten minutes prior.  I’ve never missed a flight in my lifetime.  So anyway, I called the airline and got put on hold, got online and told Pandy to tell Jess to get online right away.  She told me to get off the phone, call the taxi and just go to the airport.  I have never in my life rushed so much.  I threw everything in the suitcase, shut it up tight and walked out.  My taxi came and we rushed to the airport.  I spent 40 bucks on that taxi which pisses me off because there is no need for it to be so expensive.  Anyway so then I get to the airport, go to US Airways and they tell me that even though the flight was booked through them there is nothing they can do because I was flying with United.  So I have to go downstairs, find a shuttle and take it over to the next terminal.  I get to the correct terminal walk inside only to find out that the escalator there is broken and I didn’t want to walk to find another so I simply dragged my heavy ass bag up the stairs to the second floor.  I found United and they were very nice but they couldn’t get me on another flight that was going direct to L.A. till late that night.  They were able to book me if I changed planes in Chicago.  So I took it, called Michelle to tell her not to wait at the airport for me as originally planned and I would call her when I touched down.  I called Susan just on the off chance she wanted to fly with me from Chicago and she tells me the weather is getting really bad and that they may delay my plane.  So anyway, it’s like 10 AM and I wait around the airport for two hours till my plane boards.  The first flight was fine but it was delayed just enough to have my freaking out about making my connector flight.  Then I got to Chicago to find out that Susan had decided to come with me and that she was waiting at the gate.  I had to go from Terminal C to Terminal B which is a mad dash at O’Hare.  Finally I met up with her, we got on the flight which was half empty and I was able to sit in Economy Plus which is a bit bigger than regular Economy along with Susan.  We got to watch Master and Commander, which I liked, and soon enough we were there.  Once at the airport I called Michelle who told me the taxi would be $50 or we could take the shuttle for $15.  We opted for the shuttle.  So anyway, back at the hotel we go down to the bar to get a drink and we end up eating dinner there.  Eventually Michelle and Jill’s sister Susan come and join us.  We drink and talk until finally we all get tired and go to bed.  	So Friday morning Michelle calls at about 9:30 AM and tells me she is going downstairs to smoke and eat breakfast.  I make a mad dash to get ready and go down to join her.  We have breakfast and other Susan and Robin come down to join us.  We decide to go over to Macy’s Plaza and shop.  Susan and I decide to walk over while Robin, Michelle and other Susan go by town car.  Once over we run into Michelle.  We shop and… well they shopped and I watched.  Then on our walk back we notice the Aveda Hair Salon and I need a trim so I ask the woman at the front desk how much and she tells me $40 and I can get in right away.  So I tell Michelle and Susan to go on without me and I wait.  I speak with the woman doing my hair while she’s washing it and she asks me why I am in L.A. and I tell her that I am going to the Grammy awards and particularly that night I am going to the MusiCares Award dinner for Sting.  So she cuts my hair and then styles it up (like my hair dresser at home does after a cut for the same price so why would I think anything is wrong with this) and by the way, I like the cut and hated the style.  So I go to pay the bill and the woman tells me for the cut and the style it will be $70.  This is crazy cause I never asked the woman to do it but I suck at speaking up and hand over my credit card.  During all this they are trying to get me to schedule an appointment for Sunday, I am already thinking no way in hell since I hate the style.  So I hand over my credit card and it declines.  Which sucks cause I am thinking I have $100 left on it.  I then hand over my check card, which declines.  So I have to call Susan (who had already offered to pay for my style) to come down and pay for it.  She does and I am way embarrassed because this has never happened before, plus it was more than I said I wanted, plus I didn’t even like the style I had paid extra for.  So she very happily does and we walk back and we stop at a deli and she buys me lunch and I am feeling incredibly down and sad at the time.  Not to mention the guilt and embarrassment of having to have my cousin save my ass.  So we walk to the hotel room and we are talking and I am just down and sad and finally Susan says she wants to go walk around more so I call Mom and leave her a message to see if she can put more money in my account and I call Jess to bitch.  I feel better after talking to her and then Mom calls back to say she’ll put $100 in the account tomorrow. 	So 5 rolls around and I go downstairs to meet everyone and we take a limo over to Sony Studio Picture Lot for the Sting dinner.  So after walking the red carpet and having our picture taken (they think that pregnant Robin is Kelly Clarkson) we go to the silent auction.  There we see Laura Liney.  So then we go back outside to stand by the carpet till they let us into the main studio the event is being held in and we see Nile Rogers, Elton John, Hugh Heffner and seven or eight playboy bunnies, John Mayer, Sting and his wife Trudie and their oldest child, Patricia Heaton, and maybe others I can’t remember right now.  So we go in and we see amazing AND I MEAN AMAZING performances by Elton John, Rufus Wainwright, Dave Matthews, Black Eyed Peas, Tony Bennett, Mary J Blige, John Mayer, Wynonna, and a couple others I cannot remember.  We also see Bob something or another give a great speech (he helped to found Band-aid) and Dustin Hoffman give great speeches about Sting.  Oh and of course the finally was Sting performning two songs finishing with an amazing disco-esque version of Send Your Love.   It was very cool.  Oh and I got a fabulous gift bag which I was happy with.  2/10/04 – 6:21 AM So back in Cambridge now.  Needless to say I will make this brief because I am sick and laying in bed and I have no desire to type for hours on end.  On the day of the 7th Wendi drove into town and we went to Hollywood.  We got to see Gramman’s Chinese Theater and then we just walked down Hollywood.  It’s a pretty seedy place.  I loved seeing Wendi again.  So anyway, later we’re at the Ivy in Santa Monica which is slightly disappointing because I want to go to the one in Beverly Hills but whatever.  So I get the Caprese Salad and water just because I am not hungry.  But anyway, so we are leaving the restaurant.  So Robin heads back to the hotel and I go with Susan B., Michelle, and Susan to the Polo Lounge in the Beverly Hills Hotel.   So the next night we went to the Grammy’s.  We went through yet another fiasco with the limo and finally got dropped off in the front.  We came to find out that we were never going to walk the red carpet and when we were dropped off we walked over to the front of this other building.  We were just standing there when we realized the pre-award show grammy’s were being given away inside.  We saw more stars up close there than if we had walked the red carpet.  We saw Annette O’Toole, Michael McKeon, Quentin Tarrentino, Sheryl Crow, Tony Bennett, and suddenly I am blanking on everyone else we saw walk right past us.  We also saw a ton of people at the grammy’s themselves, Sharon Osbourne walked right by me as did so many others.  The Queer Eye for the Straight Guy guys were sitting right in front and behind us.  Anyway, so then we moved on to the after party and at this point I am starting to feel very sick, I had felt scratchy all day but at this point I am really starting to feel bad.  So I go back to the hotel, go to bed and sure enough when I wake up in the morning I am hit with a full cold and it just gets continuously worse through the day.  So here I am sitting in my bed after missing another whole day of classes because I was basically incapacitated.  Now I don’t feel any better but I have to gear up for tomorrow because I cannot afford to miss any more classes or work.

      I hate it when you feel like someone might be upset with you and they won't talk to you and you have no idea what you did.  You don't want to ask because if they're not angry and they're just having a bad week it might piss them off if you ask and you don't want to seem like that chick who is always like "Are you mad at me?"  I hate it when people ask me that when I am not actually angry.  But it is getting to the point where I want to ask and I keep holding out to see if I am wrong but this person is proving me right everyday... so the big question is... WHAT THE HELL DID I DO?

      Okay so it's Saturday morning and I have to go to work in a couple hours and it dawns on me.  My life up here in Boston sucks.  For a while I liked it, for a while I convinced myself that I was having fun and building some sort of foundation but now I've pretty much hit a wall and if I wasn't so determined to finish my schooling I would come home in an instant.

      Two Indie films that are maybe worth a look... depending who you are...  CAMP Camp is a story about kids going to a drama camp.  It's based on a camp the director used to work at that hails students who are now some of the most recognized actors.  It has tons of musical theater in it, Sondheim is heard throughout.  In fact Sondheim makes his own little cameo at the end of the movie.  Basically it's advertised as being about a composer who wrote one of the world's most popular musical and has since fallen from grace and has not produced anything since.  He is the special guest director for the summer.  But really the story follows the main characters and one more closely than the others.  Vlad is the fish out of water type, he is the only straight guy (at least that's how it's portrayed) and shows up at the auditions singing Wild Horses with his guitar in hand while every other student is in line warming up to sing whatever show tune they prepared.  It reminded me of the halls of the voice department at Berklee.  Anyway, the stories all follow the kids and everything they deal with when faced with the dreams of making it in show business.  The one girl, I can't think of her name, who ends up singing The Lady's Who Lunch in the middle of the show was incredible.  She, to me, was the shining star throughout the whole thing.  Vlad was annoying and just when I thought they had flawed him so entirely that he was real he says and does the stupidest things and ruins his character for anyone watching.  But despite the annoying characters and trite story lines, those who love musical theater will enjoy the numbers both arranged and original pieces.  SHATTERED GLASS I remember when this went down so when I saw it at the video store I picked it up.  It's about Steven Glass, the New Republic writer who, it was found, had fabricated almost all of the stories he had written.  The movie gives little backstory as to who Steven was and keeps more with explaining how well he was liked and how much his stories were revered all at the age of 25.  You grow to like him even though if you know anything about the character going into the movie, you know where this is all going.  You watch the meeting where he informs he is writting a piece on a teenage hacker who hacked a company titled Jukt Micronics and the twist in his story was that the hacker then ended up being hired by the company.  If you can't beat them join them mentality.  The only problem to all this was that Steven fabricated every word, every fact, every minor detail and what's even worse than this is that he knew how to manipulate the fact checking system by providing detailed notes he had to create and get his story pushed through even after going through editors and fact checkers.  The kid was basically a pathological liar and he was losing grip.  You actually feel bad for him after a reporter at Forbes online had discovered Glass's error.  It was only after Forbes called The New Republican for facts and details that the magazine began to get a clue.  You watch as Steven's editor tries to protect him and believe the kid just believed a bad source.  You are almost begging for Steven to confess just so he can end his web of lies.  You felt tired watching him try and make up a new lie every time an old one was blown apart.  I have to say that due the emotion evoked both Steven Skarsgaard and Hayden Christensen did an excellent job.  Others in the movie are Steve Zahn, Rosario Dawson, Chloe Sevigny, Hank Azaria, etc.  So that's it thus far, check back later, I have more movies to watch....

      I think I want to start a new recurring contest in my blog:  THEME MUSIC INSERTED HERE (This is not the title):  TODAY'S BIGGEST FREAK ON THE #1....  This contest is made up of players who don't even know they are contestants... and if you want to play you have to make sure you are on the #1 bus when I am and you have to be on somewhere between the Newberry stop and the Throwbridge stop (I think that's what the stop is actually called - it's the one at the intersection of Mass Ave, Putnam and Mt. Auburn) in Cambridge.  The other qualifications are that I have to see you and you have to be... well in all honesty friggin weird or just way cool, but just so you know weird will win this contest over cool any day!  TODAY'S BIGGEST FREAK ON THE #1 IS....  KICKING SINGING GUY I saw you on the bus this morning when I got on at Mt. Auburn around 9:40 AM.  You were sitting in the back of the bus.  I didn't pay much attention at first as I was at a good place in my book and anxious to delve right back in, but you didn't let that stop you... you were determined to pique my interest.  As I sat there and read Digital Fortress I noticed movement out of the corner of my eye.  I remember at this time my MP3 player had begun the live version of In Your Eyes and your movements seemed to be in time with the drums.  I then took a better look out of the corner of my eye and noticed you too were listening to music and your movements, which were becoming larger and larger till you almost hit the woman next to you, were those of one mimicking playing the drums.  I then turned back to my book as I must admit although not always as animated as you I am used to seeing such movements due to my current status as a student at Berklee.  Drummers are everywhere.  I think it was the next part that put you over the top and led you to win today's title.  When I heard the loud singing at first I assumed it was part of my own music as I had turned it up pretty loudly and was very interested in my book, so much so I didn't even consider the sound.  But the second time was brilliant on your part, that flat howling noise you made caught my attention... congrats... it was so obnoxiously off key and so bad that I think I decided I had never heard anyone sing so poorly in my life... but the clincher was that you clearly thought you were the best singer in the world.  But this next part (despite what I might have just said) is what won you the contest... the standing up at no particular time pretending to have a microphone in your hand and jumping with some sort of sound escalating from your mouth (assuming it was singing) and making us all remember that we are glad that Bret Michaels was not only good looking but had a voice on him...   Sing on my freakish friend... sing on indeed!

      Is it sad that I am already wishing the next two months were up so I could come back home....  Monday - Got in, mom and Caitlin picked me up at the airport, went home, hung out with my mom and with Nancy and rehearsed for the funeral.  Tuesday - Woke up, dropped off mom at the church, sat in rush hour traffic still at 10, got to Carteret to pop my head in for Joann's last day, said hello to everyone, left, went back to the house, hung out with mom, Nancy called, went to the funeral home to rehearse, got freaked out by the casket (closed thank god), tried to fix the high end synth the funeral home had, rehearsed, went back to the house, fell asleep, got ready and went back to the funeral home for the visitation and then for the funeral.  Sang my song, finished the funeral, went back to the house and talked to the many many people who came back.  Wednesday - Woke up, went to the gravesite, sat through the short ceremony at the burial site, went back to the house, ate brunch with the whole family, went to Murphys in Olde Towne Alexandria for St. Pattys Day, met up with Eric, walked the streets, drove Eric to his office, went home, napped, went to see Hildalgo with Lucky, came home, went to bed.  Thursday - Hung out with Jeff  Friday - Picked up cousin (Jen) at Papa's, took her to Lucky Brand and bought jeans with my discount, went to Foxes Music Co., went by Leigh's old house in Arlington, went to Long John Silvers, dropped Jen off, went to meet up with Leigh at Borders (HATE WHAT THEY DID TO BORDERS), went to Carteret, hung out with everyone, went to happy hour with Bobby, Meghan, Burt, Mike, Mike's friend, Pandy, Bobby's friend and Stacy.  Had a blast, left before most of them, went home, met up with Eric, went to Jess's, all three of us went to Freddie's in Crystal City to meet Eric's newest interest.  Listened to God Awful kareoke while drinking, went home, went to bed.  Saturday - Went to lunch with Joann, hung out with my mom, went to dinner with Dad and Sue, went home, hung out with Eric, went to bed.  Sunday - Woke up at the crack of dawn, get to Dulles, say goodbye to my mom, get in the wrong line, get in the right line, try to find my drivers license and realize that my purse is in my mom's car, find a pay phone, call mom's house collect, no answer, try to remember her cell phone number, can't, try to call my phone collect, call won't go through, ask one person for change, call my cell phone in my mom's car, no answer, ask another person for change, call my cell phone, mom picks up and said she had already turned around and was coming back, went outside to wait for her, in tears, wanting a cigarette, can't because they're in my purse, mom finally pulls up, get my purse, in tears say goodbye, go running back in, stand in check in line, get to the front and attendant tells me I have 5 minutes to check in, I tell her to check me in, tell her I have bags to check, says she can't check them, I very strongly (and by strongly I mean I let my temper get the best of me and most of you know how bad I can be when I let that happen) suggest she check my bags since I still have 5 minutes to check in, she checks them and gives me some pass to get through boarding but mentions that I will have to run and get my actual boarding pass at the gate, I go to the security line which is easily a good 150 people or more long, I ask the woman in the back to help me out since I don't have time to wait in the line, she basically tells me it's not her problem, she mentions maybe trying another checkpoint, I find a security guy at the front of the same line I was just at the back of (NO WAY I'M FINDING ANOTHER CHECKPOINT!) and sweetly ask him if there is anything he can do, he ushers me through the staff line which is only 5 people long, run to the shuttle, ride it to the terminal, run to the gate (fortunately right around the corner) and nicely ask the woman checking boarding passes at the door how I get my boarding pass, she gives it to me and I get on board.  Get back to Boston, call Back Bay Coach, get home, change into PJs and get into bed... haven't moved since... and all I keep thinking about is how much I don't want to be here and I almost wished I had missed my flight and had to stay another day... but instead I'm here.  I know I have to make the best of being here but I miss D.C. already and I haven't even been back 24 hours.  I just have to keep telling myself that May is right around the corner... and hopefully muddle through with the few friends I have here.

      This is the song I will be singing at the funeral:  When I am down and, oh my soul, so weary;  When troubles come and my heart burdened be;  Then, I am still and wait here in the silence,  Until you come and sit awhile with me.   You raise me up, so I can stand on mountains;  You raise me up, to walk on stormy seas;  I am strong, when I am on your shoulders;  You raise me up: To more than I can be.   You raise me up, so I can stand on mountains;  You raise me up, to walk on stormy seas;  I am strong, when I am on your shoulders;  You raise me up: To more than I can be.   There is no life - no life without its hunger;  Each restless heart beats so imperfectly;  But when you come and I am filled with wonder,  Sometimes, I think I glimpse eternity.   You raise me up, so I can stand on mountains;  You raise me up, to walk on stormy seas;  I am strong, when I am on your shoulders;  You raise me up: To more than I can be.   You raise me up, so I can stand on mountains;  You raise me up, to walk on stormy seas;  I am strong, when I am on your shoulders;  You raise me up: To more than I can be.

      My grandfather died on Friday morning (March 12, 2004).  Daniel P. Dodd.  It's been an odd couple of days and I don't really wish to comment on my emotions because in too many ways I haven't even begun to grieve and I am feeling everything from anger to immense sadness.  Unfortunately much of the anger is manifesting itself through selfish comments but I'm getting through it...  The funeral is Tuesday.

      Okay, for the last couple of nights I have been hearing little noises in my room and finally last night I caught a glimpse of the damn mouse but it was dark so I wasn't sure if I had made it up in my head but tonight I am 100% sure I saw it.  And now it is back behind my television cabinet nibbling on something... I guess this is payback for laughing at my friends when they had mice problems.  BUT COME ON!  I don't need this during finals time, I'm already not sleeping enough.

      You know what I have come to realize?  Everyone that I know in this city is more or less alone.  Some have one or two friends but most of them are feeling lost and confused and wishing like hell that they were somewhere else.  Did we put too much emphasis on this city?  On this school?  Did we leave our comfortable worlds assuming that we would end up making a new comfortable world?  We were all idiots if that is what we thought.  So here we are in Boston, Cambridge, Allston, wherever wishing that life were a little bit more like it has been in the past.  Sadly, knowing that almost everyone is in the same boat as me, makes me feel that much better.  :)  Your misery is my joy.

      "Free my heart so my soul may fly, free my mind from my worldly wants and desires, I look towards heaven with my arms open wide, take my hand come and take my hand."  Someone said at the end of our session today that it was like one might feel after a good session of yoga.  All I can say is for the first time since I got to Boston I remembered why it is that singing is something I have to do, I need to do because it feeds my soul, my heart.  Sounds corny doesn't it?  It wouldn't if you had been there tonight.  Seven of us crowded in a room, singing our hearts out, blending together, it was amazing.  And to think I didn't even want to go to the makeup class to begin with, I almost blew it off.  It was one of the most self satisfying experiences I had ever had.  We all had an energy, we all were in synch and I just can't even begin to put the experience into words.  I wish our normal class time was like this.

      Some news of the day:  Skid Row has a new drummer and a new singer and they are back on stage performing.  (Someone tell me why they don't just change the name when half of the band - including their infamous frontman - is nowhere to be seen.)

      I have to tell you I absolutely love the Office Max commercial with the dancing afro guy.  I don't know if it's the song they chose or the way the guy dances but every time it comes on I stop whatever I am doing and watch it.  By the way, I got a new cell phone.  Same number, cooler phone.  Yay!

      Um, so I have to tell you that I love Burger King's Chicken Caeser Salad.  It's just good.  So after running some errands today and going back to work I stop off at the drivethru and clearly state that I want a Chicken Caesar salad.  They repeat it back, it comes up on the little screen thingy... so I finally get back over to the office in Herndon and deal with a few matters before I can get to my salad.  The first thing I notice is it's a garden salad... which is fine I just had to get rid of the onions and other things I didn't want.  Then I open up the little pouch of chicken to put it on the salad and it's shrimp.  I have nothing against shrimp at all but A) I didn't want it and B) no offense but I don't want shrimp from Burger King. It lived up to my first instincts about it and was absolutely gross.  So now I've eaten about 1/3 of the salad and I've tossed it, now I guess I'll just eat my string cheese and drink my diet coke.  If Burger King is always saying you can get everything your way why is it that I constantly get things their way and nothing like the way I ordered them?  Explain please?  Do we all remember the two veggie burger incidents in the past?

      So Toni text messages me today with a one word message... Moterin... it's enough to get that stupid song stuck in my head.  I text her back and call her a bitch and get a text back with an evil laugh.  So then I tell bobby and receive three emails throughout the day with lyrics from the stupid song...  Everyone SUCKS!

      I am an impulse buyer.  I will admit to the flaw in my otherwise perfect makeup :)  So when I see something I want it right then.  I have been reading awesome things about Gmail for the last couple of days and I have been worn down to the point where I want an account.  The problem you ask?  Gmail is still in testing phase and is not open to the general public.  Well then why adverise so highly?  Why have every single tech website tell you how amazing Gmail is and then it's not available to you when you want one.  I WANT ONE NOW!  I feel like that spoiled little bitch that was on Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory... the one who went down as a bad egg :)  I want a golden goose that lays chocolate eggs!  Actually... I settle for a simple Gmail account...

      Jay-z : Dirt off Your Shoulder  This song will always remind me of the seedy bar near Harper's Ferry in Boston when Tyla, Abby and I were dancing and the guys kept trying to come dance with us and we kept having to push them away.  When we say go away... we mean go away... God that bar was sketchy now looking back... but at the time it seemed like a really really good idea.  Go figure, we were drunk.  No Doubt : It's My Life This song brings me full circle back to Carteret.  Plen and I were obsessed with this song.  Of course it was playing at his house that fateful Halloween Night... myabe that's why I don't like it nearly as much anymore.  Hoobastank : The Reason The song I obsessed over after a certain ex called me to tell me about a certain current girlfriend for the first time... I kind of got a little bent out of shape.  Thank god I got over that fast.    Outkast : Roses Rob, better known as Yaley, singing this randomly throughout our Ensemble finals.  Baby Bash : Suga Suga Christmas shopping at Macy's... don't ask.  Okay that's enough for today Michelle Branch : Breathe Sadly, it reminds me of fat women trying on clothes far too small for them... oh it was so gross...  Five for Fighting : 100 years Driving home from HFStival and finally listening to the lyrics and deciding this was one of the most depressing songs EVER!  Cause guess what... I'M NOT 15 ANYMORE!  Howie Day : Perfect Time of Day Where to begin?  9:30 club and hearing him on the radio for the first time and being so very very proud.  It was about friggin time.

      So I went out last night to Rock Bottom with Jeff and Beth.  Fortunately for me they got along very nicely as I hate introducing two people who don't know the other whatsoever and wondering the whole time if they will get along or hate one another.  They got along great.  We had planned to only stay till about 8 so that we could take 66 home when it wasn't HOV in Arlington.  We showed up around 6:15-6:30.  Beth and I had a beer before Jeff even got there and he went on to buy more and more for us all evening.  We had a great time and by the time we checked the time it was 9:30.  I had had too much beer and I am glad Beth just decided it was time to take off.  So we all go our separate ways and head home.  Here's the problem.  I was drunk.  I woke up this morning with a hangover from hell which eventually turned into just a headache (not as bad as the Vodka episode months back - it's posted somewhere in the Feb or March archives).  So now I hurt.  But there is work to be done so I keep moving along.  Well sometime yesterday after hearing that Phish was breaking up I sent Jeff (work Jeff - not Jeff who I went out with last night) an email joking about how devestated he must be.  He hates hippie music.  He writes back something somewhat funny, not as good as usual but whatever, which I receive today.  I try my hardest to think of something funny to write back but my head hurts too much and there is no way.  So I proceed to tell him so.  He then tells me he's hung over as well.  I tell him I am a sucker for the $1 beers, especially when someone else is buying, he tells me I am an economist and understand a bargain when I see one...  So the conclusion is that really I was just helping out my country last night.  I mean, that's all it was.  I didn't drink too much because I am a lush, I drank too much because I needed to help boost the declining economy.  As Jeff (work) has pointed out... I am a true patriot!

      So most of the time when I go outside to have a cigarette here in the Herndon office I end up talking about Cicadas because that's the topic everyone always brings up.  So today I go out and there is this girl from another office sitting there looking worried and I am keeping to myself when she asks me if I am familiar with Pugs.  Uh yes.  She proceeds to tell me that she recently purchased a very young pug from a breeder who assured her it was a pure-bred.  She paid a price she had found to be common among pure-bred pugs and thought nothing of it.  Then her friend sees her pug and says to her it doesn't at all look like a pure-bred, it looks like it might have been crossed with another form of small dog.  So now the girl wants to know and can't find the breeder's phone number and is worried she might have paid too much and she just wants to know what kind of dog she has.  She assures me she loves the dog and doesn't want to give it up but she just doesn't know what to do.  Um, what am I supposed to say here.  So I assure her that it is probably a pure-bred and that sometimes they look a little different then they do on television.  So she's gotten whatever she needed to out of her system and goes inside.  It was random.  Oh, and just to add, the women from this other office who always come out and ignore me completely are standing there when a cicada comes over and lands right on one of them who just flips out and starts screaming.... I feel vindicated.

      Hey guys, after receiving a courtesy call from Leigh yesterday (who was just about in tears! - okay well not really) I thought I would post this here.  Phish is breaking up.  They are done. They've gone as far as they can.  It's a sad day for Phish Phans everywhere!  I've posted the official announcement by Trey below.   urlLink Announcement

      So I have come to rely very much on my VH1 internet radio.  They don't repeat songs and even though I have one favorite I can listen to almost any kind of music.  Since Spinner/Netscape Radio finally let me down I have come to put my faith in VH1 to get me through the workday (even MTV's online radio pales).  So what am I supposed to do on a day when the VH1 site is down and I can't get into it?  I can't get my radio fix!  I can't find out what's new, who's singing with who, who sings what song... instead I am now stuck listening to Staff favorites on MTV.  The radio gets me through work at a nice pace... today is going to be very very slow.

      Did anyone else see it hail last night?  I was hanging out with the Kimble - Jutras clan last night on Grumpies back porch when the rain started coming down in buckets (while we were trying to grill in the backyard) and the thunder and the lightening and the wind... AND THE HAIL!  What was going on with that!  Needless to say it was still a good time and Bret got to see everyone before hopping a plane to Spain tonight.  Also - added a couple new blogs.  One to point out in particular is an old friend or rather kind of sort of friend is hich hiking his way around Central America right now.  Anyway, I love reading his website/blog.  It kind of puts things in perspective, you know?  Anyway, Alan sent me the link yesterday when I was bored out of my mind and ready to beat the guy I kind of/sort of work for.... Anyway, it's a good read.  Mike's Travel Log.  It's under the Blog Links.

FireDancyr7: yep, that would be the one crabbie3: i didn't know i had to threaten, i just figured it was a given. FireDancyr7: it kind of sounded like a threat FireDancyr7: sort of like... now that my girlfriend is best friends with Beth she'll tell her everything you ever say about ANYONE! crabbie3: are you planning on badmouthing me. FireDancyr7: alan, I have never said anything bad about you  FireDancyr7: other than HIGH SCHOOL crabbie3: haha, nice disclaimer at the end.  :-) FireDancyr7: I find I have to put that in more and more these days FireDancyr7: besides I know who I can say what to about who FireDancyr7: I can't say anything to you that will get back to Toni, can't say anything to beth that will get to carri and then you, can't say anything about people you don't know to other people you don't know cause it will get back to people you don't know FireDancyr7: get the point? crabbie3: not really, but i'm gonna say yes just 'cause that looked like it took a while to type.

      Added another link.  Musicplasma.com allows you to search the discography of your favorite artist and also allows you to find out what other artists you may or may not have heard about have a similar sound.  On a Jay-Z kick?  (Clearly I am.)  Find out what other artists have a similar feel and sound and then who they sound like and who they sound like and the list goes on and on and every artist has an instant discography listed.  I love this site.

      So this weekend I went to HFStival which I don't think I've actually done in like five years.  But anyway, the point is that despite having the most eclectic mix I've ever seen (Violent Femmes, POD, New Found Glory, Papa Roach, The Cure) they through Jay-Z in the mix, which to be honest was my driving force for going in the first place.  And oh was it worth it.  He was amazing, he controlled the crowd.  It's unreal to see the entire field of RFK filled with back to back people doing whatever it is the person onstage tells them to do.  (We were up in the bleachers as I am entirely too old to be down in the crowd now.)  He ran the show, he was the reason so many people were there and since he wasn't even the second to last act, he was third to last, The Offspring and The Cure lost out on a large portion of the crowd.  Although there were 60,000 people there so I am sure SOMEONE stayed around to watch :)  I was wondering what songs he was going to pack into a thirty minute show and he managed to do bits and pieces of every popular song, interact with the crowd, and make every single fan out there happy.  I was so very impressed by him.  (Especially since he did Public Service Announcement - which I love).  So I could talk about the other bands because Cypress Hill, Violent Femmes, POD, Papa Roach, Jah Works... they were all good, they were all on their game, and even though I didn't stick around for Offspring and Cure I am pretty sure there is no way they could've given a better performance than Jay-Z.  I am told the only rival to his performance at HFS was Eminem a few years back... I wish I had been there for that one.

      I am having a difficult time remembering that technically I am supposed to answer also to the guy who will be the boss of the girl or guy that will take my place going back to school.  It's not that he's not a nice guy or that I have any problem telling him what's going on, I just keep forgetting and resorting back to my old boss who is the boss of the one I keep forgetting... not that she minds.  But I do feel kind of bad.  This is kind of a confusing post isn't it?

      I have decided I hate secrets, not other people's because that's fine, but I hate my own.  Most of them have come out or else I've outed them but there are still a few that linger, what I think, who I see, what I do... and the worst part is those secrets are not a result of me wanting them to be unknown but other people involved who for one reason or another don't want things to be known... confused yet?  I just needed to bitch?  Anyone else?

      So you know what I hate more than anything?  I don't mind listening to your problems, I don't mind giving you advice, I am here for my friends, family and co-workers whenever... except at one particular time... HAPPY HOUR!  I am not a licensed professional counselor, and we all my stance on marriage so I AM NOT A GODDAMNED marriage counselor.  And I refuse to play either WHEN I AM HANGING OUT AND DRINKING BEER.  Come on!  Time and place... people, time and place.  So here's a no name version of what happened...  I get to happy hour and find out that this one friend of mine from work... we'll call him Bitch, invited this other guy from work, which is fine, we'll call him Miserable.  So Bitch tells me Miserable is coming out and I am fine with that, on occasion I have been told that Miserable can be fun.  Friday was not one of those days.  So as I am hanging out with other friends from work now known as Pandamonium, MR.IWANNACIGARETTE, KEEPEROFSHADOWS (I am stretching here but I am trying to start each word with the first letter of their name), Bitch and well, I got nothing so we'll call him Bert.  Miserable walks through the door.  Miserable wastes no time in coming up to me when I ask him how he is telling me that his marriage is falling apart... MISERABLE PISSED ME OFF RIGHT THEN.  How are you in a bar does not really mean how are you!  Miserable then proceeds to go on and on about said marriage and then confides in me that Miserable's wife thought at one point that Miserable and I were having some illicit affair... WHAT THE F!  Again, I have to say it cause I am still in shock and gagging... WHAT THE F!  Just one more time because if you knew who I was talking about you would say it too... WHAT THE F!  Okay, so done with that.  Anyway, I laugh, and let it go because what the hell do you say to that?  So the night continues and I think I have dodged the bullet of dealing with Miserable for the rest of the night till he then tells me he feels like we're friends and he can confide in me.  He then tells me that he is in love with someone he can't have.  One more time.. WHAT THE F!  Why, you ask?  Because he's married, so? you ask, I mean after all his marriage is falling apart... BECAUSE she's married.  Great.  So skip to the end of the happy hour because it all goes on like this for hours... and Pandimonium who is now seeming kind of down wants to go dancing... well fine.  So we go to another bar and Miserable is going to back out but in the last few moments someone else convinces him to go.  So he tails us over to the next bar.  Now I feel for the guy and he's pretty nice so I am not going to protest but I was so close to being rid of him.  We get to the other bar and he proceeds to ruin my night further by bitching some more and then on top of that proceeds to go on about catching young things and taking them home for a one night stand.  MR.IDONTWANTACIGARETTE convinces him to go hit on some chick and we watch as Miserable stands behind her for a while like some sick stalker and then backs out.  He then comes back to the table to go on and on about how he's just not that kind of guy, he's sensitive, sweet, caring, he wants a girl for a lifetime not a girl for a night... WHAT?  WHAT?  WHAT?  What are you a goddamn girl yourself!  Jesus Christ I wanted to smack the shit out of him right there and tell him that he better find himself a "homely" one, to put it nicely.  But instead I just smile and say, that's really great of you.  He then proceeds to tell me how great I am... WHAT THE F!  Finally after Pandamonium and I ditch him to go dancing he comes and stands there in the middle of the dance floor talking about his whole issue again... WHAT THE F!  After ditching him over and over again, telling him I had to go here and do this and then turning right around after he followed me... he decides he's old and too tired to hang out.  Thank God.  So this concludes this part of my dramatic night, there was more but it'll have to wait for another time.

      News of the Day:  GO SEE TROY!  Actually don't go see just because I told you to.  I loved it, thought it was friggin fantastic, but those who listened to all the hype before the movie are having more difficulty enjoying the story.  I had heard mixed reviews before going and the person I went with didn't love it nearly as much as I did... and no I didn't just love it for Brad... although damn he looked good.  It was an excellent story... those expecting an exact playout of the Illiad have another thing coming but if you just go to see a fun movie, this is definitely it.  By the way, the Spiderman 2 preview was very cool.  Can't wait for that one.  Also, most of the time I could care less about Boston, let's be honest, my heart just isn't there anymore, not like it used to be.  But today I am so very very proud of Massachusetts.  There are same sex couples marrying all over the state from what I understand today and I have to admit when I read the following article I teared up a bit...  urlLink Same Sex Marriage   This is my town and I am kind of jealous I am not there today to witness such an amazing and groundbreaking moment: "The city of Cambridge, a liberal bastion that's home to Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, opened its doors to couples at midnight, and remained open until about 4:30 a.m. Monday."  Michael Moore is getting rave reviews at Cannes for his Fahrenheit 9/11  There is a movie premiering at Cannes that has unsimulated sex scenes... um, it's not groundbreaking... we've had them before... I think they're called... now what was the word... oh right... PORN!  We premiere porn at Cannes now?  Um, I realize that due to my recent experience with the show back in August should leave me to be supportive... but really I've lost all interest and could give a shit who wins.  I didn't even watch the second season before I went to audition for the third.  It was a fun trip to see what happened and I had a good time so I regret nothing but still...  "Dee Law has been a diehard fan of Fox's runaway hit American Idol since it started three seasons ago. But as the show speeds toward its May 26 conclusion with three songbirds left, the 40-year-old Pennsylvania homemaker couldn't care less about the outcome. A Clay Aiken fan, she lost faith in the process after making a shocking discovery last year: No matter how often she tried, she couldn't place her vote. " ... Um, you're 40.  You're a Clay Aiken fan (not discounting that as I like his voice... but uh, you're 40.)  Once again, I repeat you're 40.  And if you are so upset that you feel the need to talk to a reporter in the newspaper about your vote not counting and actually ADMITTING TO TRYING TO VOTE FOR TWO HOURS STRAIGHT... need I remind you that you are in fact 40.  Get a friggin life!  YOU'RE 40!  Um... it's Catholic School... what the freak do you expect?  God I hate stupid people.  urlLink Girl Sent Home   By the way, I pulled most of these articles from the ever popular Drudge Report.

      So since the game was cancelled and neither of us had anything better to do but go spend money, Bret and I took a trip to the mall.  I think this was the first time since high school I have gone to the mall looking for nothing in particular to buy.  Anyway, at one point I dragged Bret into Sephora where I marveled that I couldn't find a single thing to spend my GC on.  AND I also found it interesting that someone would spend $20 on BELLY BUTTON LOTION!!!  I don't give a damn if it tastes good, why would anyone buy belly button lotion?  Jessica Simpson went from virgin extrodinaire to married sex fiend marketing BELLY BUTTON LOTION!!!!

Also, took a final tonight and pretty sure didn't ace that one so guess who is livid and pissed off... THAT WOULD BE ME!  This is going to fuck up my 4.0!  Damn it.  Anyway, the reason that I actually signed on to write something down is because I saw a bumper sticker while I was waiting for the bus earlier and I wanted to post it here.

      Erin's Music Updates:  Um, they are making a musical about John Lennon.... called Lennon.... is everyone running out of ideas now?  Christina cancelled her tour due to overused vocal chords....   ***By the way I WANT THE GREY ALBUM!!! CAN ANYONE GET IT FOR ME????***  iTunes is talking about digitizing out of print music from old records... that is a huge feat and one that would keep Apple sitting on top of all the music downloading franchises out there.  I don't want to talk about Michael Jackson anymore....   I am so buying one of these:  The technology is quite simple: The music fan goes up to the touch-screen kiosk after the show and buys the keychain drive with a credit card from a dispenser alongside the screen. Once that's done, the miniature drive is inserted into a slot in the kiosk, and the recording - stored as MP3 files - is loaded onto the device's 128-megabyte hard drive. That is enough space for 110 minutes of music.

      This song keeps popping up in my life the past two weeks.  But I am glad because as random as it comes around it is very welcome.  Ever since I first heard this song way back when and bought my very first Jeff Buckley cd I have been obsessed with the song.  For whatever reason, despite it's not so uplifting lyrics it has this amazing ability to just calm me and make me okay with things once again.  It's really amazing the power music has over me that one song can change my whole mood.   Hallelujah Jeff Buckley  Well I heard there was a secret chord that David played and it pleased the Lord But you don't really care for music, do you? Well it goes like this : The fourth, the fifth, the minor fall and the major lift The baffled king composing Hallelujah  Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah...  Well your faith was strong but you needed proof You saw her bathing on the roof Her beauty and the moonlight overthrough ya She tied you to her kitchen chair And she broke your throne and she cut your hair And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah  Baby I've been here before I've seen this room and I've walked this floor I used to live alone before I knew ya I've seen your flag on the marble arch But love is not a victory march It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah  There was a time when you let me know What's really going on below But now you never show that to me do ya But remember when I moved in you And the holy dove was moving too And every breath we drew was Hallelujah  Well, maybe there's a God above But all I've ever learned from love Was how to shoot somebody who outdrew ya It's not a cry that you hear at night It's not somebody who's seen the light It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah  Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah...

      This is my public apology for being the absolute lamest person I have EVER met over the last two weeks.  I apologize for ruling the tools and not even trying to hide it.  I apologize for being THAT GIRL and you know which one I am talking about.  I apologize for reading into things too much.  I apologize for actually finding myself giddy at times.  I apologize for getting worked up over absolutely NOTHING.  I apologize for sounding like a complete and f-in moron.  I can't get over myself and my f-in issues that really aren't issues at all.  But rest assured I am done.  I am over it.  I will never speak of it again and we will just let it go because if I have to hear myself bitch about my f-ed up "situation" which really isn't even a "situation" at all I think I might have to cut out my tongue or something.  Gross right?  Well you'd be thinking the same thing if you were as lame as I have been.  Even though this might sound a bit humorous I am actually being 100% serious.  You have no idea how f-in pathetic I have been again recently and I am so done.  I'm over it and if I am really not I will be soon.  It's time to stop being THAT GIRL.

      My tattoo represents Love, Life and Faith... 
     
    
</post>

<date>24,June,2004</date>
<post>

     
      It has been asked several times today what my tattoo stands for.  I got it for the purposes of my family's herritage but here is what I found on the internet:  The Trinity Symbol: Definition: The triquetra (often, triqueta) is a tripartate symbol composed of three interlocked vesica pisces, marking the intersection of three circles. It is most commonly a symbol of the Holy Trinity (Father, son, Holy spirit) used by the Celtic Christian Church, sometimes stylized as three interlaced fish.   This symbol predates Christianity and was likely a Celtic symbol of the triple Goddess, and in the North, a symbol of the god Odin. Triplicities were common symbols in Celtic myth and legend, one of the possible reasons Christian beliefs were so easily adopted by the Celtic people. The triqueta makes an ideal Christian symbol. It is a perfect representation of the concept of "three in one" in Christian trinity beliefs, and incorporates another popular Christian symbol, the fish. It is sometimes enclosed within a circle to emphasize the unity aspect.  In Wiccan and Neopagan belief, the triqueta symbolizes the triple aspected goddess (maid, mother, and crone). Some Christians have protested this "appropriation" of the symbol...however, ironically enough, the original Christian fish symbol was derived from an early symbol of venus, one representing female generative organs- making the triquetra perfectly appropriate symbol for a Goddess revival. The triquetra is also considered to represnt the triplicities of mind, body, and soul, as well as the three domains of earth- earth, sea, and sky.  The Celtic Knot: The ancient Celts believed that life was "anam turas", a "journey of the soul".  It has been suggested that the interlocking knot patterns found in Celtic art represent this journey and exemplify the interconnectedness of all life.  The Celtic knot is always made of one long, interlocking, never-ending thread --- the thread of life, and symbolizes man's continuous quest for spiritual growth and rebirth of the soul.  While Celtic in origin, the knot can have universal significance and meaning for all.  The Heart: Hearts are a rather recent addition to Celtic symbolism. Hearts as symbols of "love" date from the later medieval period but have become an established part of the contemporary Celtic repertoire in the last decade of the 20th century.

       urlLink    This is the inside of my tattoo but it is what my sister got alone without the knot around it.  Guess I have to give her credit for finding that symbol cause otherwise I would've had the cladagh with the heart, crown and lame ass hands around it instead of the cool heart and trinity symbol... okay I will stop with the tattoo now... I just like playing with the pictures&nbsp; urlLink

      Ahhh, well I got it done.  I went right after work yesterday and when I got over there I talked to Caitlin who was supposed to come sit with me.  She said she was going to try and get over there very soon but since she's a nanny this summer she had to wait for the parents to get home.  So I go in and I wait around, talking to Anna the tattoo artist and the rest of the people there, smoking cigarettes and just hanging out.  Of course what they don't know is every five seconds I'm thinking it's not too late to walk out the door, I hadn't paid for anything.  So then Anna admits that she didn't think I was coming back today and I told her I am seriously freaked out but when I commit to something I always follow through.  So finally it was time to go and Caitlin wasn't there but whatever.  So we went in and she showed me the stencil of the knot,heart,trinity thing she had come up with which was what I wanted previously but with the knot behind the heart and the trinity sign.  Anyway, the point is it looked very cool and I'll get a picture of it up here soon. Maybe today.  So I go in and Anna is so nice and we're just chit chatting and she knows I am freaking out so she tells me when she is going to start and tells me to let her know if I want to break at any point.  Oddly enough it wasn't that painful and I had a lot of outline work done.  Everyone had told me before that it would hurt so badly and it was more irritating than anything else.  I was also told that the shading would never hurt as badly as the outline but the shading for me was far worse.  I think it's because the outline work took so long and is ALL OVER THE TATTOO unlike many of my friends by the time she got to the shading my skin was so sore and iritable.  But it was finally over and as I was walking into the parking lot, Caitlin showed up.  Wasn't that nice.  The parents of the kids she watches didn't show till late.  So anyway, the tattoo  ended up hurting more after the fact then it did while it was going on.  My back is very sore right now and it's starting to dry out.  But I'll get a picture up later.

       urlLink    This is a really crappy picture I drew just to give an idea.  Trust me it will look SOOO much better than this.  But I was never one to be skilled at freehanding in Windows Paint.  And besides... the heart is crooked, the trinity sign it too thick and the knot is really not a knot at all is it?  But whatever you get the general idea.  Hopefully I will have pictures to post tomorrow.&nbsp; urlLink

It's why there are so many now cause I am playing.... So anyway....

      By the way Jeff is a tool.  Pandy and I are emailing back and forth and Jeff happened to be caught in the crossfire because both of us were replying to all.  No big deal.  And now the poor baby is bitching cause he wants us to stop.  Get over it.  I just don't get it.  When did we get so old that we wanted to set aside fun for work?  I swear to God.  I watched Nip/Tuck last night and part of the story line was all about getting older and what you can do so that physically you don't look it.  I could kind of care less about the physical aspect of growing up, I don't necessarily give a shit about looking older since most of my friends are far older than me anyway.  But I do care about acting older.  I don't like the responsibility of it all and I certainly don't like the opportunity to have less fun and when we do have it our willingness to set it aside for more grown up matters.  Maybe I have a Peter Pan complex.  Maybe I'm just too scared to grow up for fear of finding out my life was meant for very little... I don't know.  But since I am on such a philosophical kick right now I will add once again this one little insight... Jeff is a tool.

      I am in the midst of reading this particular book called Down and Dirty Pictures:Miramax, Sundance and the Rise of Independent Film.  So far it's good but it's definitely shattering my perfect image of Redford.  They have good things to say about him, yes, but they definitely have their opinion of what he's done to damage the subject as well.  But you think they rip at Redford?  Try how bad they go on about Harvey and Bob Weinstein.  They make those brothers seem like they should be wielding axes as they walk around their offices in New York City.  I haven't finished the book but if you have any interest in the subject it's actually a pretty fascinating and candid book.  The author definitely doesn't sugar coat or hold back opinions if they show someone in a negative light.

      ...to avoid being a tool.  By the way click on the title of the entry to see how a "tool" is defined.  #1 - Don't drive around a piece of crap that says "VGY PWRD" cause basically you're telling me right then and there that if I become a vegetarian I can drive a piece of crap and look like well... a tool.  (I so wish I had had a double quarter pounder with cheese and bacon and ham and pork to throw on his windshield.) (this is the only one not related to a certain person I am gearing all of these toward)  ***DISCLAIMER - this has nothing to do with vegetarians JOANN this is only for that damn car I was stuck behind at lunch today***  #2 - If you can't do something, admit to not being able to do it.  Don't sit around and tell others that you can do something just because you think it's cool to be able to do it. I'm pretty sure that no one is the greatest soccer player to live, can play perfect Chopin on the piano, wrote the best great american novel ever, can calculate any number known to man in an instant, can cook better than my boy Wolfgang, can cliffdive better than professionals, can win the Indy500, can sketch better than Davinci, can read an entire collection of Shakespeare in a day, and won six Oscars for one role just because the critics loved them that much!  SHUT THE F UP!   #3 - Think things through.  Don't go around telling people about your sorority hazing experiences because a) those of us who didn't join and never would join a sorority think you probably had to buy your friends anyway (not that that's the only reason to join) b) don't tell people about people drawing fat circles on you to conjer up sympathy because really you're just giving me a visual that is gonna make me laugh at you for years to come c) you're just advertising reasons for those of us who hate sororities to REALLY hate your sorority cause they let you in!  #4 - Just because someone is telling a story that you think would coincide with one of your own DOES NOT mean you should jump in there and offer up your story.  Sometimes?  Yes.  All the time?  No.  And by the way, don't be one of those one-upper tools either... EVERYONE hates those.  #5 - No one likes a breast pump.  Not even for those of you who have dared to have children.  No one likes a breast pump pulled out for the world to see whether you are going to use it or not.  Put the breast pump in a hidden place and only take it out in public when you are locked in a restroom stall.  Besides... I'm sorry, did you actually have breasts?  I must've missed them.  #6 - Just because you are married to someone I work with (who I don't even talk to) does not give you the right to just butt in and talk to me.  It could cause me serious pain in the end, like I don't know... say wanting to bolt so badly I forget my wallet in a rest stop... which would make me basically hate you for the rest of my life and knowing if you ever gave me any reason... I WOULD END YOU!  (I threw that in for Mike... not that he ever reads this)  #7 - Don't laugh.  You possibly have the most shrill annoying laugh anyone has ever heard.  Do you take joy in knowing that slowly you are shattering ear drums all over the world?  #8 - Now this right here is a gift... this is a moment when I will tell you something that will really give you the upper hand and put you on your road to recovery... DO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCE BEFRIEND OTHER TOOLS!  First off, you married one, you're already a moronic tool.  You annoy the crap out of me therefore you are the toolbitch from hell.  But to befriend two of the biggest tools EVER TO WALK THE EARTH?  You have got to be the supreme ruler of all time TOOLS!  #9 - Learn your opinions don't matter.  I don't care.  If you said you loved Dave Matthews Band I would gladly give his music up for the rest of my life rather than actually have something in common with you.  In my case, ignorance is bliss.  Let's keep it that way.  #10 - Accept you're a poser.  Accept you are a loser.  Accept that you need to learn to be the happy housewife with your tool husband and your tool kid and your tool friends and you must never never come out of the house again.  We already have to deal with the husband... isn't that affliction enough?  Haven't you all punished the rest of us enough?  Stay inside, embrace delivery, online shopping, sunrooms, etc... NEVER EVER STEP BEYOND YOUR FRONT DOOR AGAIN!

      Okay so Friday started out as a normal day.  Came into work, did some work, listened to Reagan's funeral... and bided my time before getting to leave the office for the day.  Finally around 1 I took off for the corporate office to meet up with everyone before heading over to the Carteret Bowling Party in Centreville.  From the moment getting to the bowling alley we were drinking, this at 2 mind you.  There was sips of rum and cokes, full glasses of beer, two tequilla shots, and did I mention the asti?  So after getting liquored up there and I am sure making a fool out of myself.  I remember at one point making some comment about a guy I thought was gone but who was actually bending over to pick up a bowling ball.  I was damn embarrassed about that.  I remember discussing the person I referred to as Mr. Miserable in a previous post with the girl we think he's been seeing... and the shocking part is she was kind of cute.  She must be damn hard up if she's trying to get with Miserable.  Jen, Pandy and I were out of control but God was it fun!  I remember at one point having discussions with Mike, Bert, and Jeff but really I just remember the drinking.  I didn't black out if that's what you're all worried about, I can remember being there the whole time I just can't remember small details.  I remember cheering for Bert.  So then I know I need to sober up before making the long drive home (long being fifteen minutes).  So I agree to go to Happy Hour with Jess, Michelle, Eric, Mike, Bert, Pandy, and whoever else was invited.  Oh Kim was there too.  So we head over to Glory Days and I have already called my friend Eric to tell him I would meet him at Jess's around 9 that night.  It was seven, I would stay for an hour and leave.  Simple.  Easy.  Wrong.  So I just kept drinking and eating at happy hour.  I talked to people I had never met before.  Anyway so eventually Pandy, who is responsible, has to leave.  So she goes and I keep drinking.  I call Eric (my friend) and leave him a voicemail letting him know I won't be there at 9 and that he can come over to Glory Days if he wants.  This was about 8:30.  I remember arguing with Bert and Mike over their comment that every woman wants to change something about the man that they are with.  I disagreed.  I didn't say most women didn't want to but my point was that not ALL women were out to change the guys they were with.  I remember arguing with Mike over whether or not he was a player and somewhere in this I argued with Michelle too over whether or not Mike was a player.  My side of the argument is that Mike is too nice a guy to be considered a player.  This is the truth by the way.  So anyway, this is where the conversation itself becomes a bit hazy agin, I am not nearly as drunk as I was at the bowling party but you have to remember I am still drinking.  So at one point it gets on the subject of how generations differ and how what was taboo for the generation of the majority of people sitting around the table is not taboo for my generation unless you are considered a prude.  Somehow the topic of my burnt nipple came up.  So then Carolyn is all like "I want to see it" and everyone else is cheering this at this point too and I'm like no.  So they won't stop giving me flak about it and Bert jumps in saying no one can see it because it's a "bert" nipple.  He saved me.  So then Carolyn keeps insisting and finally I'm like what the hell do I care.  But it's not like a flashed everyone mind you.  Carolyn came over and I moved my shirt and bra so that if she was looking over my shoulder she could see but no one else could.  That was the end of that.  She did touch it which I thought was funny but that was it, it was over.  So then I start hearing Carolyn talk about her boob job and I'm like Oh Shit here we go.  Needless to say that she was quite proud.  So eventually after much conversation and after Bert has finally agreed with me that not EVERY woman wants to change her guy and after we've listened to drunk mike go on about this and that.  And after I've joked about Bert not being allowed to hear and see certain things going on at the table without my permission, we are instructed that enough people have left and Bert and I need to move up to the end of the table where Carolyn, Scott, Michelle, Eric, Chris, Todd, Derek and other people I didn't know were at.  This was where it got interesting.  So we're sitting up there and at first Bert sits next to Carolyn and she tells him to move because she wants to sit next to me.  So we switch seats.  I can't remember the order of events here but needless to say at one point Carolyn pretty much flashed everyone and her boobs were not only right in my face but in Bert's as well and Mike had a pretty good view himself.  And we're not talking quick flash or tease we're talking they were out and she was proud.  I was cracking up at Bert and Mike's faces.  Then Carolyn wanted me to feel... um... okay.  So needless to say because it does nothing for me I did.  It was interesting from a straight female perspective because I have never been one to grab boobs and so to be quite honest I have never felt a pair of fake ones before.  They're much harder for those who want to know, not really soft to the touch.  Anyway, none of this has phased me much at all, if nothing I am more or less laughing at the guys reactions.  I've been in more interesting sitauions before... this was nothing.  So the night continued.  At one point I remember Mike telling Julie that he would "take care of her" and Michelle was encouraging it.  Julie gave Mike her phone number.  I remember at one point having to finally explain that Bert and I were actually not together at all and that it was a big joke.  There were definitely some disappointed people there at that point which I found even funnier.  One lady in particular seemed sad that we weren't a real couple.  I just didn't feel like dealing with another Carteret rumor circulating or I would've let that one go on longer.  Fortunately I know that Bert is a smart guy and understands it's all a joke.  All of the rumors have been jokes but I am not always sure if the other person involved in the rumor knows that.  Which is unfortunate maybe because Bert and I have a lot of fun with it and I can't do the same with others cause I don't know if they think I am serious or not.  But now I am off track.  So finally after listening to Michelle explain that she doesn't need to show her boobs but that hers are real and fabulous I decide it is definitely time to get the hell out of there.  I get home that night and there is this message from Eric written on the driveway in some of Austin's chalk... guess he didn't get my voicemail.    So anyway, wake up the next day and Eric shows up and we are just waiting on Jeff so we can drive over to the office.  Yeah so I told him 6:15am, at 6:25am I called just to make sure he wasn't lost.  I couldn't get a hold of him.  I tried again at 6:30am and told him we were leaving.  So no Jeff.  I was just a little pissed at him.  I got over it though.  The boy doesn't owe me a damn thing and so quickly I got over being upset and decided I had nothing to get upset about.  So we get to the office and we wait around and everyone shows up... except some of the people who claimed the night before that they were going to go and Mike. Everyone tries calling Mike, no answer.  Finally we have to leave without him.  No Jeff.  No Mike.  Pandy and I grab seats in the back not far from Jim and Jess.  Eric is in the front, where Bert and his wife are sitting mind you, and Michelle is in the front so we feel we're safe.  No.  Eric comes back and sits next to Jessica. And what we didn't notice was that Tom and his wife were sitting a couple of rows in front of us as were Bob and his wife.  Oh and wouldn't you know it... they hit it off.  They all loved each other.  TOOLS!  Oh my God Tom's wife is the most annoying woman alive.  Sorority loud mouth freak.  No offense.  At one point Pandy and I were cracking up because she pulled out her breast pump on the bus.  WHO DOES THAT!  As far as I know she didn't use it but God knows I wasn't looking too hard.  I was trying to hide from it all.  Pandy and I giggled about random things like my new band's name "Clitoris Sky", various office hi-jinx, her addiction to her cell phone, Mike's inability to wake up on time, and whatever else we could think of.  We cringed at the jokes and comments that Eric felt the need to make behind us and we viciously tore apart Tom, his wife, Bob and his wife (to ourselves of course.)    So we get there and we head straight for food because we're both a little hung over and need grease.  We eat at the Hard Rock Cafe in the Taj.  We hit Roulette and at this point I am with Kim, Pandy and my friend Eric who won't gamble yet.  I'm like WHHHAAAATTTT!  So I win at Roulette.  Head over to Craps.  Loose about sixty bucks.  At this point I have lost Eric and Kim but Bert and his wife find us.  We decide to leave the Taj which is boring and rundown and head for the Borgata.  We taxi over.  I did try and find Eric and Kim before leaving by the way.  So here is where I have to recommend the Borgata to everyone who is going to AC because most of Atlantic City is trash and pales in comparison to Vegas but the Borgata can hold it's own.  It's still not a Vegas hotel but it's close.  So we go looking for a Black Jack table but we're only seeing $15 and $25 minimum tables and I am just not that good.  So I am forcing Pandy to gamble at least once before we leave so she and I hit the slots while Bert is trying to get in on a $15 table.  Next thing I know Bert and his wife are passing by saying on the other side they are opening at $10 table.  We head over and Bert and I play Black Jack for a couple hours while Pandy and Bert's wife look on.  We had an f-in fantastic table.  Everyone was laughing, helping each other.  I went up and down but I didn't give a crap.  Bert was up most of the time.  I had expected to lose the full $200 I brought and was even ready to take out another $100 to lose if need be.  That was all money I could afford to kiss goodbye.  But I had a good time and I walked away from the table with $75 so technically I only lost $125.  Not bad.  Anyway, this part is getting boring for you I'm sure.  We head back over to the Taj to meet up with everyone before going home.    So we get back on the bus and thank God Eric went back to go to sleep or I would've shot someone.  Pandy and I continued to rip apart the Tools yet again.  We got a hold of Kim's Vanity Fair and drooled over Beckam for a while.  G-DAMN he's hot!  Then there was a blank bumper sticker ad inside the magazine that said "I 'heart'" and then you had to write something.  So Pandy and I wrote TOOLS and cracked up about it for hours.  At one point Tom's wife said something and I said a little too loudly "SHUT UP TOOL!" and that once again provided entertainment.  OH!  I didn't mention the nuclear power plant!  Holy cow!  LARGEST BONG EVER!  Haha!  I totally forgot about that for a second there.  Oh Pandy makes me laugh.  So needless to say we get to the rest stop and we go in to get food and when we come out, because Pandy and I are rejects, we are giggling every time we see Tom's wife.  Tool.  There was inappopriate touching between a certain owner as he helped Pandy off the bus... GROSS!  So anyway I am inside getting food and I pay and as I am putting my food in a bag and waiting for my friend Eric and Pandy Tom's wife comes over and starts talking.  I am in such a rush to get the hell away from her that I bolt.  This part will be important in a minute.  So we get back on the bus, eat, watch XMen-2 and finally we arrive at home.  Pandy and I have now decided to just go home and not go out.  So I pick up my purse and notice it is extremely light.  Hmmm... no wallet.  I paid for food in DE and it's not on the bus.  Must be in DE.  I must have bolted so quickly from the TOOL BITCH that I left it sitting there.  So we call and I am all freaking out more or less because my social security card is in there and not for any other reason.  I could've cared less about the money or the cards. I just was freaked about the social.  So finally we get the woman at the DE House (By the way WORST REST STOP ALONG THAT ROAD!  I WAS PISSED WE STOPPED THERE ON THE WAY TO ATLANTIC CITY AND EVEN MORE PISSED ABOUT STOPPING ON THE WAY HOME!) and the woman let's us know that she has it and it looks like everything is in tact.  So they're sending it to me and I'll have it on Wednesday.  So that's about it.  Everyone go pick up the new single by Clit!  :)  Threw that in there for you HO!  So there you go.

      So I am a friggin good cook when I want to be.  Forget the incident last night with the not placing the oven rack more in the middle when I went to broil the steak.  My half was a little burned yes but in actuality I didn't mind.  I'm that girl that purposely burns her hotdogs over an open flame because I think they taste just that much better.  I got that from my mom.  But since I don't have a car right now... or a wallet... which I will explain momentarily, I had to make myself lunch today and since i was out of just about everything... I had to actually cook my lunch today.  I broiled some salmon last night with a little olive oil and a little lemon pepper... and I just finished it... OH MY GOD it was good.  Salmon is easy I know.  But I am always in awe when I don't screw up a dish.  You are talking to the girl who managed to almost close her mother's throat after putting two cups of Baking Soda in her sugar cookies... (DAMN COSTCO'S LARGE CONTAINERS!)  I am thinking I need to make a chicken dish tonight.  Maybe some chicken parmesean without the pasta...

      I find it interesting that many of the news articles I have read surrounding Reagan's viewing in the Rotunda feel the need to mention that many of the onlookers and those who came to pay their respects were not dressed in formal attire.  Some of the articles attack those who waited in lines for three, four, five hours just to glimpse the coffin were in shorts, tee shirts and sandals.  Does it matter?  Are we so superficial that we feel people need to come out only if they own a suit and tie?  Shouldn't we honor the president no matter what we wear?  Granted I don't feel that anyone should have shown up in anti-Reagan attire and as far as I know no one did.  But shouldn't we feel proud that the masses showed at all?  Shouldn't we revel around the idea that so many wanted to pay their last respects to a former leader of our country?  Granted I have my political opinions and as many no I am not by any means a supporter of the Republican party as a whole.  But Reagan was an elegant man who, when he spoke, made you believe he wanted the best for not only the country but for each individual. Say what you want about the national defecit but Reagan himself was a great man.  I feel people should stop worrying about what those who showed up were wearing and feel glory in the fact that they showed up... period.

      Oh my Lord I am still dying of laughter.  I had to post this so I could remember it for years to come....  So it starts with this from Jeff after I asked him how he could translate this German text I sent him: "Deal is a German name.  However, the original spelling was Deihl but when the Deal clan came over to the U.S. in 1789, there was a split within the family. Those going up north to New York and Massachusetts kept the original spelling those who stayed in Georgia and Texas changed the spelling to the more contemporary D-E-A-L."  Then I have nothing to say really so I write: "Your dad's hot. :)"  And he writes: "You're disgusting. "  And I write: "Haha!  But the remark was effective.  Don't worry, I'll leave him be, after all he's much too old for me, not that I know his age but you know since you're like a million years older than me yourself he's got to be ANCIENT!"  And he writes: "Im in my 20s."  And I write: "What is up with you today?  Are you upset?  Should I just leave you alone today?  No digs at me, no witty retorts, no sarcasm..."  And he writes: "Why would you think I am upset? I give you a piece of American history with the division of the Deal/Deihl family and you come back with a need for sarcasm.  I don't get you Trost! Here I am trying to educate you and all you can do is demand some sort of witty response.  I'm not some droll whore who just spits out witty remarks anytime it is demanded or paid for.  Humor is an art form my dear, and I will not prostitute my art for the amusement of those who do not respect it!"  And I write: "I am so sorry.  I am such a bitch to assume you were in a bad mood because I keep getting short one liners that aren't even funny.  I think I've been listening to Pandy too much when she says you are boring and quiet now :)  I felt sad at the idea that the only person who could match my wit other than Mr. Jutras had died somewhere on the inside. Here you were trying to share you've become, the mature older adult with adult responsibilities who's looking onward to marriage and kids, and I felt the need to make you feel bad for it.  It was very wrong of me. Perhaps now we should be discussing things such as genealogy and maybe it would be a good time to begin discussion such literary works as Goethe's Faust and how it has effected the world of modern day medicine? What did you think of Anna Karenina really?  I would love to know your theory on whether an odd perfect number actually exists.  It is fascinating all the adult conversation we could have.  Again I sincerely apologize from looking beyond the fact that I could learn so much from you.  I hope you will look past mistakes made and help me to grow into the kind of wise philosophers you now associate with."  And then he responds with: "I might be old but I am not deaf....even though you wrote that and didn't say it... but I'm sure you said it out loud first, but I'm not blind either(just senile) and I am pickin up on your sarcasm here.  #1 Pandy is blinded by my beauty and doesn't initiate many conversations"... "I don't know why but for some reason I prefer to stay out of the conversations she has with herself. #2  Anyone who doesn't find my genealogy interesting obviously has never learned anything of the rival was of 1814 when the family was at all out war and incest was at an all-time high. #3   Who is this bitch Anna Karenina? #4   Does an odd perfect number exist? Why yes it does.   #5  I can still at least count to 5, and hasn't lost all of me breain cellz yet. Lastly,  name anyone in this office that produces any stimulating conversations for more than 2 minutes.  The closest thing we have is your girl Pandy but she always puts a perverted spin on everything and you know I am a delicate flower."  (Edited to save the feelings of others who might read this...)  Oh and I am still laughing.  That Anna Karenina comment killed me!

      I have this friend who is in love with this guy.  She's been married to him for a while.  Here's the problem.  The guy is no good, he's cheated, told her it's over, cheated again, rinse, lather, repeat... you get the point.  Now, once again he is claiming that this time will be different and once again I can see she is starting to hope and believe him again and once again the girl is gonna get hurt.  Everyone can see it but her.  I know love blinds you, I know you go deaf and dumb as well but it doesn't make it any less painful to watch it happen.

      Would you date someone who was 67 if you were 25?  Older than your parents, younger than your grandparents, and 42 years separating your ages.  Could you do it?  Could you do it for love?  Could you do it for money?  Just a thought.

      Alcohoroscopes  ARIES  Drinking style Impulsive Aries people like to party and sometimes don't know when to call it a night. Their competitive streak makes them prone to closing-time shot contests. They're sloppy, fun drunks, and they get mighty flirty after a couple tipples. Getting Aries people drunk is a good way to get what you want out of them, should other methods fail. Aries can become bellicose when blotto, but they will assume that whatever happened should be forgiven (if not forgotten) by sunrise. They can be counted on to do the same for you -- so long as you haven't gone and done anything really horrible to them last night, you sneaky Gemini.  Trademark cocktails Aries, born under the hot-stuff planet Mars, is the ruler of spicy food and red things -- and for balance, astrologers recommend they eat tomatoes, onions, olives and greens. That's right, Aries, you were born under the sign of the bloody Mary. Aries also rules grapefruit, and they've been known to kick back a salty dog and a sea breeze or two. For extreme hotcha, try a concoction with cinnamon liqueur in it.  Drinking buddies Marlon Brando, Lawrence Ferlinghetti, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Al Gore, Thomas Jefferson, Elton John, Eric McCormack, Rosie O'Donnell, Sarah Jessica Parker, Reese Witherspoon   My Response: ARIES ROCK!  Loved this, cause sadly it’s just true.    Competitive? Check.    Sloppy and Fun drunk? Check.    Flirty?  OH MY GOD YES, EMBARASSINGLY SOMETIMES!  Didn’t you know everyone wants to get with me when I am drunk!?  J  Do things I shouldn’t do when drunk?  Check.    Do I think it should be forgiven come morning?  Check.    Forgive what others did the night before?  Half the time I can’t even remember… so check.    Have to disagree with the Bloody Mary… after the Vodka Night in Boston… um no.  I’m sticking with beer and gin.    Cinnamon Liqueur?  No.  Gross.    And then we get to the drinking buddies?  Um, why do the Aries guys make out in this situation? SMG, SJP, RW and well RO’D but still… and I get Fat Ugly WEIRDO, No idea who Ferlinghetti is, um former VP who claimed to invent the internet, DEAD GUY, Gay Guy, and Plays a Gay Guy on TV?

      Would they be so bold as to hit us the same way they did once before?  Sadly, we'll just have to wait and find out.  Maybe it's just a hoax, maybe it's just an idle threat, and maybe there is no way for any of us to know for sure.  Scared yet?  I am.

      Not like I was really involved in politics back then but I liked Reagan.  I know I know, republican, but he really made you believe what he was saying, whether it was the actor in him or not, I liked him. I know I am late in posting this since this happened on Saturday - but it was a sad day for all.

      Okay, so maybe not bronzed and beautiful yet... but getting there.  So for all of you out there who have been going to tanning salons for years... keep your mouth shut!  I have always wanted to go but I have this serious fear of doing things I've never done before alone.  I don't have any problem trying things with other people but when it comes to mustering up the courage alone... I just don't.    So finally I decided after buying my new Bronzer at Sephora and going nuts on all kinds of other makeup to make myself beautiful (haha!) I desperately needed a tan so that my skin will match my face without having to spend 10 minutes blending the bronzer every morning all over my neck and ears.  Pain in the ass.  For those of you who have a natural glow or for the guys who never have to go through this kind of stuff... just shut up.  I research and find out there is a tanning salon right around the corner from where I am working for the summer and I consider it but when I drove by I decided against it.  I just couldn't bring myself to walk in amongst all of the regulars claiming to not know a damn thing about it.  And there are several embarassing questions I would have to ask in order to understand the process.  I have no shame most of the time but in weird circumstances like this I seriously freak out.  Go figure.  So I know that Pandy goes to a tanning salon and decide to ambush her with question after question about lotion, time, tanning beds, price, what to bring, do they care if you are naked, etc.  See, didn't have any problem asking her.  She answers every question and then goes on to say she is tanning the next day at lunch if I wanted to go.  I say what the hell.  This is my oportunity to find out if I not only like it but I will have someone there to hold my hand.  So we get there and Pandy and her friend are ushered back to their rooms all the way around the corner and in the back. I am left with the woman attendant.  The woman, who was very nice, kept saying I had absolutely no color at all... well thanks... isn't that why I am here and didn't I just say I was a first timer.  Do you really need to make me feel like crap because I HAVE NO COLOR?  Would you like to see me cry now.  Anyway so I say that my friends who do this on a regular basis have told me I should go in for 10 on my first try.  The woman says, I would feel better if you only went in for 7.  I say fine.  Fortunately Pandy has already given me lotion, so I purchase a package for 100 minutes total and buy some eyewear.  Not a bad deal.  Then the woman shows me to the room which is right in front of the front desk facing out to the window front facing the parking lot.  She flips a bunch of buttons and says this does this and this does that... and I just smile and nod although I couldn't for the life of me see what she just did.  She's like we clean our own beds when we're done.  I said okay and then she says there is the solution.  I, still trying to focus on what buttons I am going to have to press, cannot process what she just said and when I hear solution I'm like SOLUTION FOR WHAT!  I already have oil, now I have to put on a solution too.  Thank GOD I put two and two together before I actually decided it would be a good idea to spray myself down.  I go into the room and as I am shutting the door I hear her say don't forget to lock it cause sometimes we forget who is in what room.  Okay.    So I take off all my jewelry, all my clothes and start putting on the lotion.  I give one more look to the solution and tell myself one more time that it is the cleaning solution for afterwards.  Then I hit the switches and hope something happens.  The bed turns on and I get in.  There is a face tanner but I am terrified to press any of the other switches for fear of electricuting myself or something.  It's insane I know.  So I am laying there thinking of everything I have and need to get done for the day.  And before I had gone in the woman had mentioned that if I get too hot or itchy I need to get out cause it means that I am burning.  So every few seconds I am literally asking myself the question... do I feel itchy, do I feel too hot?  As if I wouldn't notice.  So then all of the sudden I hear this noise and I realize it's someone in the room next to mine probably cleaning off her bed but for whatever reason it makes me question whether I remembered to lock the door or not.  I couldn't remember, so I spent the remaining five minutes questioning whether or not I should check the door.  I mean if someone did open it up I would be there lying naked for the whole waiting room and passersby outside to see.  But if I got up I would lose a moment of my seven minutes.  So basically I just kept looking over at the door every few moments and then looking back up and looking over and looking up.   So finally I finish up and get dressed.  I clean down the bed.  Go out and thank the woman.  I walk outside and find Pandy and her friend who both went in for like 17 - 20 minutes hanging out in the parking lot.  It aparently took me that long to get aquainted with everything that my seven minute tan took far longer than theirs.  Whatever.  So I say goodbye and head back to work.  The whole time home I'm flipping through my schedule in my head to figure out when I go next... addiction anyone?  So I am eating my lunch back at the office when I lean on my hand and realize that I smell really friggin good.  The lotion smells really good and since I am covered in the lotion... I SMELL REALLY GOOD!  I insist upon telling everyone this throughout the day.    Anyway, to make a long story short, despite my idiot ideas and fears, I really liked it, it was kind of relaxing.  I imagine it is what it's like to be placed in one of those water tank thingys except here you're getting a tan while you do it.  So once again if it hadn't had been for someone else I would still be sitting here at my desk wondering about something I could've been out there enjoying... story of my life.    Now if I could only conquer my recent aquisition of stage fright, everything would be fine.

      So we're all sitting around with hangovers right now... (Alan, John, Toni and I) and sounding like morons for example Toni just said she wanted a "watery batch" and we all busted out laughing because no one has a clue as to what she meant.  And I really wanted to write on here even though I have nothing to say.  I have the giggles and I am cracking up at everything and anything.  By the way, I finally saw Get Shorty today... I liked it... and this you care about.  Murphys was fun last night, although our waitress cut off Toni and I can vouch she wasn't drunk enough to be cut off... this of course caused tension.  Then we came back to Alan's and he and I went and sat out in the garage last night in the dark smoking cigarettes and avoiding all the automatic light sensors.  So yeah, this was a boring post and it's about as scattered as my mind is.

      I woke up early this morning around 4am With the moon shining bright as headlights on the interstate  I pulled the covers over my head and tried to catch some sleep But thoughts of us kept keeping me awake Ever since you found yourself in someone else's arms I've been tryin' my best to get along But that's OK There's nothing left to say, but  Take your records, take your freedom Take your memories I don't need'em Take your space and take your reasons But you'll think of me And take your cat and leave my sweater 'Cause we have nothing left to weather In fact I'll feel a whole lot better But you'll think of me, you'll think of me  I went out driving trying to clear my head I tried to sweep out all the ruins that my emotions left I guess I'm feeling just a little tired of this And all the baggage that seems to still exist It seems the only blessing I have left to my name Is not knowing what we could have been What we should have been So  Take your records, take your freedom Take your memories I don't need'em Take your space and take your reasons But you'll think of me And take your cat and leave my sweater 'Cause we have nothing left to weather In fact I'll feel a whole lot better But you'll think of me  Someday I'm gonna run across your mind Don't worry, I'll be fine I'm gonna be alright While you're sleeping with your pride Wishing I could hold you tight I'll be over you  And on with my life  So take your records, take your freedom Take your memories I don't need'em And take your cat and leave my sweater 'Cause we have nothing left to weather In fact I'll feel a whole lot better But you'll think of me  So take your records, take your freedom Take your memories I don't need'em Take your space and all your reasons But you'll think of me And take your cat and leave my sweater 'Cause we got nothing left to weather In fact I'll feel a whole lot better But you'll think of me, you'll think of me, yeah  And you're gonna think of me Oh someday baby, someday

      I am beginning to think that all of my entries on this should start with something like I am the biggest idiot or moron or lame ass or whatever random cutdown you want to insert here.  I should start by saying that my life is one big giant mess and no matter how many times I try to make it better or fix it just so I end up screwing it up even more.  I try so hard to appear to everyone like nothing matters, nothing gets to me but it does.  Everything does.  I think the best word to describe me is broken or breakable.  I'm just going to lay this out there.  No one gives a shit.  I mean really.  People say they do, they say they care and I am sure in the moment they say it they mean it but when you are always aware you are never the first person on anyone's mind... well the first part doesn't end up meaning too much.  I'm so tired of being tired and sad.  I am so tired of crying and I am even more tired of being hurt every second of everyday.  Why do I care?  What's the point?  People say I am negative, it's not real, it's just a shield, a way of protecting myself.  I'm possibly one of the most optimistic people you'd ever meet but you don't know that because I won't let you know that.  I'm sad.  I'm pathetic.  Most of all I'm just so fragile.  I don't feel like I really belong anywhere nowadays and it's a hard feeling to shake.  People always say you make your own happiness and your own pain... well I am trying to avoid the latter and do the first but I find it impossible.  I can't.  So the question is, what's wrong with me?  Why am I so f-in easy to toss away?  And I am, cause I do it to myself.  I don't matter, I can't matter, I don't let myself matter.  And as for myself?  Look at me.  I was with two of my cousins this weekend and the whole time I just kept thinking why didn't I come out morally sound and with a good outlook on life?  I try so very hard to be what other people want and I somewhere in all of that I lost myself.  I keep telling myself I'll figure it all out and one day everything will just click.  I tell myself to shake off things that shouldn't bother me but do and I can't.  More importantly I tell myself to just be happy and the truth is I'm not so sure I know what that is.  Some of my friends hurt me and I don't know why, some of them are wonderful and I wish I could focus on them only.  Some of them expect too much from me.  I used to think I belonged here and not up in Boston... but I think now I am wrong.  I don't belong anywhere and that fact just breaks my heart.  Everything is breaking my heart.

      "Yes but at least you have Jeff and Pandy to distract you.  I've got email.  Whatever.  We both have it bad today.  Think anyone would notice if we just left and went somewhere fun?" (from me to Bret after discussing who has it worse, him over in Corporate or me over in Herndon.)  "jeff and pandy are so far away...im stuck down here in 200.  i say we run away to....i dont know, but somewhere where it doesnt rain as much. perhaps seattle"  (from Bret to me)  "Haha.  St. Louis had good food :-)  Other than that... I got nothing.  OH!  I have it.  Let's go buy a little shack on the beach in Hawaii and  eventually you'll become a world renowned surfer and I'll sing in the  band that plays in our kick ass parties at night and we'll be the most  popular people on earth.  Then you'll take off and fall into drugs and  drinking and I'll marry some abusive guy and eventually when I get the  strength to get out I'll come find you, as you are obviously still  living in the shack, and I'll build your confidence and you'll quit  boozing and the drugs and go on to win the greatest SURFING TITLE EVER! " (from me to Bret)  "hahaha...that sounds like a deLIGHTful plan.  can i bring my car to  hawaii?  im gonna need somewhere to sleep in case i have to temporarily  rent out the shack to buy drugs "  (from bret to me)  "Haha!  Of course.  But eventually you'll sell the car when you are in  your darkest moments for some crack.  But secretly I will buy it back  for you when you start to progress in our own version of rehab.  But I  will not give it to you until after you win the championship.  Then  we'll all be walking back to the parking lot to take my new BMW which I  bought from the money I inherited when my ex-husband mysteriously died.  You will begin to head for my car and we'll all be laughing and some  random ass freak will offer you a beer and you'll smile and say "DON'T  DO DRUGS!" with a thumbs up sign cause you are THAT cool.  Then you'll  see the car.  You'll cry.  I'll cry.  Everyone within a hundred miles  will cry.  :-) "  (from me to Bret)  "wow, you need to option this script to a production company and turn  this bitch into a movie.  i want jeff to be there as the old washed up  surfer who teaches me some important life lesson. "  (from Bret to me)  "Like the Karate Kid mentor?   I have to admit this would be THE BEST  MOVIE EVER! " (from me to Bret, copying Jeff this time)  "ahh yes...i think jeff would like the mr. miyagi role.  you have learned well young grasshopper"  (from Bret to me)  "I will gladly play an americanized, hunk of a Mr. Miagi.  I picture the  movie starting off with a meeting between me and bret as he is waking up  on the beach at 4 am after a 4 day coke spree and I am out surfing on my  own, getting all spiritual and sh*t and I take bret back to my house on  the beach (that in real life would be a 2 million dollar property but  somehow the lonely old man can afford it) and nurse him back to health.  Midway through the movie Bret gets too cocky and tells me he doesn't  need me anymore blah blah blah falls for the wrong woman blah blah blah  blah.  Then at the end of the movie bret is coming to terms with the  fact that he is a coked out a-hole and I find him in some parking lot  and tell somehting along the lines of "you had happiness all along but  couldn't see because of your blind fury to be the best.  Surfing is  about you and nature not the speed, not the rush.  Then I pound his face  into hamburger meat and we get his traps all hulked up and wins the big  meet in the end.  Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh. "  (from Jeff to Bret and I)  "Whoa.  First of all you just basically exited me out of this story and since it’s my story that’s not an option.  Bret has to succeed in the end for it to be the perfect 80’s surf story"  (from me to Bret and Jeff)  "i dont quite understand how the pounding my face into hamburger meat  really helps the plot here...but other than that i think we have  something here.  except that i want to fall asleep with my crack pipe  being really hot and burn jeff's house down...twice.  i think that will  add a certain element to the story "  (from Bret to Jeff and I)  "Now that I can work in.  :-) "  (From me to Jeff and Bret)  "I pound your face because you and Erin split up and you fall asleep with  a burning hot crackpipe in your hand and wake up next to Ben on the  beach with an empty jar of ranch dressing laying next to the 2 of you.  So I need to smack you back to reality and then you get back together  with erin and win the big meet.  The movie ends with us surfing together  at dusk so you can barely make out our images as the sun sets with Erin  singing her hit song 'wind beneath my rings.'"  (from Jeff to Bret and I)  "right, but as we surf off into the sunset, someone comments that it  appears 4 mountains are floating way too close to shore...then they  realize that those are just our traps seated atop two massive  individuals who then surf to shore and eat them because they need some  quick protein "  (from Bret to Jeff and I)  "STOP IT BRET! You had me mountains.  You had me at moutains." (from Jeff to Bret and I)  "Um, Bret broke up with me sometime last year and I feel it would be too difficult for me to work with him in a romantic situation.  It’s too much of life imitating art.  So I feel I need to just step back out of respect of the new friendship Fret and I have finally been able to form after all the tears that were spilled and direct the picture.  Maybe I’ll cast Pandy in my place.  She’ll have to lip synch to my voice at the end." (from Erin to Jeff and Bret, copying Pandy)  "And of course there will have to be an 80s montage of Jeff bringing Fret back to competitive status."  (from me to Jeff, Bret and Pandy)  "Pandy will now be referred to as peaceful-booty.  She gets it."  (from Jeff to the rest)  "I’m sure she does.  Will there be a piano scene involved?"  (from me)  "the only piano scene will be one where jeff and i take a break from surfing and smash a piano to pass some time...then pandy will of course be so excited by this that she will not be able to control herself... "  (from Bret)  "And start tying up hippies with the piano cords as we round them up and take them off to our Island of Arnold for reprogramming.  From there they will be fed raw meet and gunpowder as we mold our army of Trap soldiers TO RULE THE EARTH! The only thing that can stop us now are those lousy kids."  (from Jeff)  "Yes and that's where the "happy strong booty" comes into play.  I will rip my clothes off right then & there and scream "do me because I love violence"." (from Pandy)  "Very good happy-strong-booty.  I see you are finally becoming one of us."  (from Jeff)

      When my second cousin Cora was younger a statue was to be commissioned of a little girl and so this artist in the St. Louis, MO area asked his friend, my first cousin once removed, if he could use his daughter (Cora) as a model.  So this statue, also titled Cora, is now in the Botanical Gardens there and has been sold over and over again.  Anyway, so cut to current day and Cora is about to get married, her reception is being held in Don Wiegan's house (which is the house/studio I took all the pictures of below).  The house is unreal, it was brilliant, I loved it immediately.  It used to be a slaughter house a long while back but he has built onto it and slowly transformed it into this amazing studio and house.  I just can't even begin to explain what an effect it had on me. So anyway, my first cousin once removed, Evan, arranged for us to go by and see it since it was Cathy's and my first trip to St. Louis and we've always heard about this statue and plus my mom and Babs wanted to see it as well.  So on our way out to Jill's after the shower we stopped by.  Anyway, I linked his website to the title above.  If you want to read up about him and his accomplishments click on the title of this post.

       urlLink    This was the first time I discovered what Route 66 (which that entire song is about) looked like.  It's that road over on the right of the picture.  It was pretty lame.  I didn't get a picture of the sign like a wanted though.&nbsp; urlLink

      Posted a first chapter of a new story on More Than YOu Think I Am.  Don't know how long it will stay up.  I tend to go back and forth on whether I like it or not.  The link is over to the left side of this page.  I welcome any and all feedback.  Just comment in the comments section underneath my post.  See what you think.

      "I am in love, I am.  So shoot me.  No, seriously, just do it.  Because the other is worse.  Because being in love is breaking my heart.  You are breaking my heart.  So I am handing you the gun.  Don't worry about where you hit me because nothing could possibly hurt as much as I hurt right now.  Seriously, just do it." ~Ryan

      Verse 1: And I just feel so used today So empty and tired of this day So alone and so terrified That everyday will feel like this And if I just keep going Keep telling myself I’ll find my way out of this I can make it through another day.  Chorus: But sometimes it’s hard to breathe And I don’t remember how to live And I’m scared I never will And I won’t write songs about the rain And I won’t be obvious about my pain So don’t look too closely And let me lay broken.  Verse 2: And I don’t want to go away And staying isn’t something I do well I just feel so let down No one here to pick me up I can’t get my feet  Underneath me, on solid ground I can’t make through another day  Chorus  Bridge And if I fell too far Could I find my way back? And if I cry out loud Would you know I was sad? Would you notice at all?  Verse 3: Please don’t get me wrong I get through this somehow, somewhere I always seem to But it just gets harder every day Make it all go away Break me, bend me, I’m broken I can make it through another day

      Okay, I'm just gonna throw this out there for a particular someone who I think has read a previous entry of mine and feels it was too long and boring for their tastes....  a) not that this is my excuse but I was drunk when I wrote that Faith Restored post so you can bet your ass it's gonna be long and rambling... I didn't even know I had written it till the next day when I took a look at some of the photos on my blog.  b) It's MY blog so I am going to f-ing post whatever the hell I feel like  c) I leave the shit up there so I can come back months later and laugh at myself  d) IT'S MY BLOG!  e) F U!  f) and if in the future I choose to write another long passage and it bothers you that I've done so... whether I am drunk or sober... skip over it or don't read it at all, no tears will be shed from my eyes if I come to find out YOU didn't like what I posted or better yet didn't read it at all.  g) I AM MAKING THIS LONG JUST TO PISS YOU OFF  h) It's MY BLOG!  i) I could keep going through the whole alphabet  j) I'm actually not upset... just retaliating...  k) You can think whatever you want about my posts, my life, my emotions at the time which I do willingly spill... not always but sometimes... but don't begin to pretend that you know me or can categorize me from what you read here.  l) IT'S MY F-ING BLOG!

Every time I get up enough nerve to do the stupid thing and go down and see what the heck he is barking at he stops and there is nothing there.  He is really starting to FREAK ME OUT!

      I am not a huge fan of this one but I wrote it about a friend who died back in high school and again I just found it recently so I wanted to post it before I forgot it.  I can't remember the last time I saw your face Or heard your voice Or made you laugh  I can't remember Taking a walk Talking till dawn Writing you a letter  I can't remember Hearing you sing Holding your hand Watching you cry  I can't remember Seeing you drunk You being out of control Hearing you yell  I can't remember Missing you much Thinking I'd never see you again Wondering if you cared  I can't remember Saying goodbye Turning away Letting you go  I can remember Laughing aloud Smiling till it hurt Feeling loved

      I wrote this back in high school and recently came across it again:  Vince's Heart By Erin Trost  I had given you my heart I had given you my soul You took my innocence It was out of control.  But I’m not complaining No, I wouldn’t dare I know that you loved me I know, I was there.  I loved you so much I couldn’t see straight I loved you too much And I learned too late.  What happened when I left Please tell me what went on? I was out of sight and out of mind In fact I was almost gone.  I came home early And I rushed to see you I know I saw you hug her And I saw you kiss her too.  What happened to me I was gone in your heart? I guess you didn’t love me I should’ve known from the start.  I ran home and cried I didn’t know what to do The only thing in my mind Was the image of you.  Should I forgive and forget Or should I just let go So many answers I just didn’t know  But you said you were sorry And you kissed me goodbye See I couldn’t lose you I would rather have died  So I took you in And I never learned That you were a fire And I had been burned.

      If ever you are feeling like you're tired And all your uphill struggles leave you headed downhill If you realize your wildest dreams can hurt you And your appetite for pain has drinken its fill  I ask of you a very simple question Did you think for one minute that you were alone And is your suffering a privilege you share only Or did you think that everybody else feels completely at home  Just wait Just wait Just wait And it will come  If you think I've given up on you you're crazy And if you think I don't love you well then you're just wrong In time you might take to feeling better Time is the beauty of the road being long  I know that now you feel no consolation But maybe if I told you and informed you out loud I say this without fear of hesitation I can honestly tell you that you make me proud  Just wait Just wait Just wait And it will come Just wait Just wait Just wait And it will come  If anything I might have just said has helped you If anything I might have just said helped you just carry on Your rise uphill may no longer seem a struggle And you appetit for pain might all but be gone  I hope for you and cannot stop at hoping Until that smile has once again returned to you face There's no such thing as a failure who keeps trying Coasting to the bottom is the only disgrace  Just wait Just wait Just wait And it will come Just wait Just wait Just wait And it will come Just wait Just wait Just wait And it will come

      I feel as if I just lost two hours of my life...  I saw the Village and it was horrible.  I think maybe it would've been okay had it been marketed as a love story and the shock value had been taken out of the whole scenario.  But if you think it looks good from the previews... DON'T GO SEE IT!  You will be so disappointed.  I'm not the only one...  "The Village... my opinion... DO NOT SEE IT!  I'm going to sleep now in hopes of forgeting it completely." - My away message  "yeah so the village kinda sucked.. off to bed... nuh night" - Nichole's away message  "The Village sucked my ass..." - Bret's away message

      When I was five my piano teacher decided I needed to start voice lessons.  So I did.  I can't remember why at the young age of five Lynn, my piano teacher, believed that I should but to everyone it seemed like a great idea.  At six my mother took me to a dinner theater to audition for a local rendition of The King and I.  I got the part.  At seven it was The Sound of Music and due to the ages of the kids and work hours for minors the Von Trapp children were cast to two different actors for every part.  But shortly after this happened we received a phone call and preferred me over the other girl by so much that they wanted me for every night.  So I performed, the youngest of all the actors, every night for a long run.  But I won't bore you with any more of my resume.  I've been singing for as long as I can remember.  I never went through the phase of wanting to be a doctor or a lawyer, I wanted to be a singer.  I had dreams of Broadway from the very first musical my parents took me to and the dreams were just made that much larger every time they would take me to concerts and to other musicals.  Special trips to large cities were planned just to catch whatever musical was coming around.  My parents never discouraged me so I didn't ever want to be anything else.    The older I got and the more I was told that I was above and beyond the best singer my age the more my attitude and cockiness grew.  When I was very young and we had first moved to D.C. from N.C. I, at age 8, believed nothing could stop me.  I was good, I was the school soloist, I was praised non-stop in church, I was acting in musicals, I was the best of the best.  So when my parents told me of an audition in D.C. they asked me if I wanted to go for it.  Of course I did, I would go in there, wow those people and call it a day.  Then I could go home and tell all my friends that I was going to be in a National Touring Company of Les Miserables and from there my fame would grow.  I had it mapped out.  After standing in line with hundreds of other kids and listening to their mothers tell them they were the best, I was ready to show them exactly what they wanted... me.  I had never been fearless till that moment.  I had been in dance recitals, piano competitions and recitals, I had sung in front of large crowds, I always had lead roles in the plays I was in... how could I possibly know what stage fright felt like.  I felt myself shrink the moment I stepped in front of the panel.  I felt my attitude and bravery shrivel up.  I screwed up the timing of the song, I screwed up the words, I screwed up the entire audition.  Before I could even finish the small part they wanted every girl to sing, the panel of judges cut me off and I was asked to stop.  This wasn't the plan... this was not how it was supposed to go.  I went home and cried my eyes out knowing that I could never show my face again.  I began to have doubts of my ability until auditioning for a very select choir where I was once again praised and given solos.  This continued and eventually so did my auditioning.  With church and school and even local theater I was a big fish in a small pond.  No one my age could belt like me or understand harmony like I could.  I was good at it.  Once again I began to believe that this could work, I would sing for my career.  I continued to head downtown for large auditions.  Les Miserables came around again and I thought, why not?  Rent came around and I went for the audition.  Both times I got past the beginning stage and with Rent sang in front of numerous people in one day.  But eventually before even getting a real call back I got booted.  It was my lot in life.  I would get further than 75% of the world of singers but eventually I would fall short.  Weddings became my thing.  They were easy.  Everyone always wanted the same songs, I learned the popular love balads of the time knowing they were the most requested.  I would get up, do a song or two and get paid for it.  I did well.  I was still getting praised, still believing that I was one of the best.  But my previous doubts would come back to haunt me.  I never got stage fright again until after a battle that waged at the end of my junior year of high school.  Up until then all emphasis was placed on my voice.  Showchoir at Chantilly High School during high school years was the thing to do.  I'm not just saying that because I was a "band geek" persay and my world revolved around singing, I'm saying it because it was true.  It was like a freak of nature event.  Popular kids, the ones everyone wanted to be, were in showchoir, guys and girls.  It was such a big deal that eventually three showchoirs were created, but the best and the brightest were in Touch of Class.  We did real dancing, lifts, drops, one guy for every girl, we were a serious show to watch.  Costume changes, scenery changes, we were our own little play without a plot.  I was in Touch of Class when one of the two choral teachers, my junior year, began to hint that I might want to watch my weight.  Now, other things that have nothing to do with my voice or performing were going on or had taken place in my life and my weight was beginning to suffer because of it.  I didn't care a lot of the time and things that had been important in my life seemed trivial.  But one thing I never took away from, one thing I always put 110% into was Touch of Class.  It was my escape, my release.  After the one encounter about my weight had passed I slowly forgot and my confidence returned.  Then came the competition in Disney World.  On the side of the main competition there was a competition for soloists but each school could only enter two.  We had auditions.  I auditioned.  I got more applause than any other.  Trust me, I'm not being cocky when I say that I was in.  I sang my heart out and those who hadn't heard me, heard me that day.  There are three panelists, not students, who decide the two to compete.  Trust me again when I say I know I was in.  But funny that when the list came out I was a runner up, I wasn't going to compete.  I knew that the score sheets were passed out to the student after the decision had been made so I went to my instructor and asked if I could have my score sheets.  He put me off for a week and a half giving me different excuses every time and then finally told me he wasn't doing that anymore.  It was all very hush hush and very secretive.  So I stood by watching two of my friends compete in the competition and not me.  I never said a word to them or made them feel bad but inside I knew it was because they were a size 2 and I was a size 12.    Then came the big one.  We had a big show at the end of the year which was a major attraction so much so that we had to perform three nights in a row just to appease those who wanted to buy tickets.  Jazz and Pizzaz.  The elite jazz band and the elite showchoir.  And don't get me wrong, I wasn't hidden, I was given a solo song all of my own, I had backup singers and everything.  But I was asked to not be in certain performances due to the costumes needed for them.  So unlike those who might not be in a song due to their solo being right after I was not in songs because I was fat.  Then suspiciously I didn't get in to the choir again after having an excellent audition for the next year.  I was devistated and heartbroken.  I was fat.  I was so fat that I got kicked out of showchoir.  Our showchoir was beaten year after year at Nationals by showchoirs with much fatter people yet somehow for me to be not in the single digits of sizes made me a throwaway.  So I moved schools.  Desperate, maybe, but I didn't not want to be in a chorus at school and I certainly didn't want to be in a chorus under the same man who had revealed to me that weight was in fact everything.  So I switched schools.  Don't feel too bad for me cause it was the best thing that could happen.  At my new school I wasn't the fat girl in the chorus I was the girl with the kick ass voice in the chorus.  I was back on top.  Except now in the back of my mind I knew I'd never make it as a singer cause I wasn't skinny enough.  Now for most girls this would be enough to make them anorexic... and how I envied those girls.  But other things were happening in my life that were far more important than school chorus and again my weight was getting worse.  I couldn't get control of it.    Then there was school, jobs, all the while I sang like it was the only thing I was meant to do but really I knew my life was destined for Administrative Assistants.  Who wanted someone who didn't finish college and really had never persued another interest in life other than music.. and writing but that is a whole different story.  I kept doing weddings and the occasional appearance in church but that was it.  I never rejoined the choir at church after high school because I had a new life that involved new friends and new boys and the choir just seemed like another scheduled thing to take away from my new life.  Singing got put on the back burner only to be brought out occasionally.  Then one day I got it in my head to reapply to Berklee College of Music.  I don't know why or what put the idea in my head but I got online, filled out the application, sent in the money and waited.  Finally it came, I was in.  After applying on a whim, after talking about going back to school for journalism or English Literature, I was going back to school for music.  Singing to be exact.  AND I was moving to a specialized school in Boston to do it.  This was serious.  Did I believe in myself so much that I knew I could get back on top or was it that I just needed a change?  I didn't dwell on that concept for too long, I just packed up and moved.  My first semester was easy as far as classes go, I made Deans list with no problem.  Music was in my blood.  I just got it.  I didn't understand those who had to struggle much like math wiz's can't understand those of us who actually found calculus a little difficult.  But the problem came in the singing classes.  My stage fright had resurfaced.  I would sing the songs beautifully but my performance lacked because I was boring to watch.  I didn't move, I didn't let people see that I felt the music I just used my voice for it.  Well that's great if I were planning to do jingles for the radio but for someone who wants to perform it's not acceptable.  My teachers were encouraging, they loved my voice, but my performance was critiqued often, especially by me.  The worst of course were the classes where we would have to perform and then watch ourselves on video the next class and critique ourselves.  Every time I caught a glimpse of my weight I would cringe.  It's all I could focus on.  All I could see.  All of my new friends were skinny and pretty there and I was fat.  As far as I was concerned they had everything they needed and I would lose out to them every time despite my voice because they were skinny.  I came home this past summer and I never wanted to go back.  Slowly, after spending time with close friends and family and after being given a reason financially to stay, I began to question if I really wanted to go back to school.  I began to talk to friends, family, co-workers I trust, and asked what they would do.  Every single one of them told me I belonged at that school in Boston.  So after talking to a few specific people who's opinion I value a great deal, I changed my mind of staying for me, I decided to go back.  But still I wondered if it was the right thing.  Then tonight I went to a concert.  Josh Groban.  Now many of you are probably laughing because I am known for the Phish or the DMB shows but music is music and I love it all.  I watched him, not dance, not do crazy faces or jumps or acrobatics, I watched him sing.  He walked from time to time, played a few instruments, but not once did he use some gimic.  And no offense to Josh but he's no heartbreaker.  He doesn't have a rebellious stage ego and he certainly isn't model material.  But his voice makes him attractive, his voice and his ability make him adorable.  He didn't dance.  I don't dance.  He didn't wear revealing clothing.  I don't wear revealing clothing.  He sang mostly balads.  I sing mostly balads.  His best work is something your mom might listen to before you would.  So is mine.  The point is he is everything I am.  He's just a singer.  My faith has been restored tonight.  I can do this.  My voice IS the most important part of a career in singing.  I am almost excited to go back to Boston and work on it some more.  For the first time in a long time I know where I am supposed to be.  I am supposed to be in a world surrounded by music, it doesn't matter if I don't have many friends, it doesn't matter that I might not have a social life when I go back.  I belong in music.  I belong anywhere where they can teach me more.  I belong anywhere where my grades are dependent on singing a song.  Just a few days ago I was saying I don't belong in Boston, that I don't belong here either.  Maybe.  But I do belong with music, with singing.  I belong anywhere where they can teach me how to feed off of music.  I found that strength once again to leave everything I love behind to further my dream.  It's the most important thing I posses and I will be damned if I am going to give it up.    I never believed I would be anything other than a singer and till the day I die I never will.

      I have done pretty much nothing this whole weekend.  Now it's 5:55 PM and I am wondering where it all went.  Friday night we went to Murphys, Saturday during the day we went shopping, Saturday night we went to the Waterfront, Sequoia to be exact (and we saw Ben Stein there) and now it's Sunday night and after having done virtually nothing all day I sit here wondering where the day went....
