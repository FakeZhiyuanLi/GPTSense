      I'm ending today with a grand total of 152 inches. Add that to my whopping total of 0 inches from yesterday and that still leaves me at... 152 inches!  At least I was able to scan and post everything. Better than nothing, and I've got some new ideas. I can feel a definite shift in my attitude after one day spent working on more art, so this is definitely a good thing.

             For a project in drawing class we had to take self portraits and are going to draw from them. The instructor told us to print out lots of copies to experiment on before we moved to drawing paper. I thought these might look interesting, all mixed up together. I like the look of pieces of myself cut up and layered. I'm thinking about using one of these for a collage background when I'm finished drawing on them.  And because Oscar can't help but be a pest:

         Pen and Twinkling H2Os on Watercolor Paper  This image is cut out around that weird shaped border (hard to measure inches). The paints I used look like they have tiny bits of glitter in them, and don't look so hot in the scan. They look much better and not so splotchy on the actual paper.   I want to really get into art journalling for this challenge, and have realized that it won't happen if I have to work out of a book I'm made. I get terrible "White Page Stage Fright" and can't do anything without worrying about having to pull it out of the book. So I'm going to do loose pages and then bind them all into a book at the end of the challenge. I like the shape of this page, so I might do more like this. I think they might look interesting interspersed with regular square pages.

         Oscar is a lousy model. If he's awake he sticks his nose on the lens or pokes it with his paw. Or he does this:

      Oh, and one more thing:   urlLink

      So the first day is over and done and my total number of inches completed is... 0. I worked all day on the website, adding people to the database, fixing things. I cannot use  urlLink Movable Type  to power the site for the next challenge. It just takes too much work to organize everything. I'm looking into  urlLink Expression Engine , and submitted our name for a free copy and I really hope we get one.  I have high hopes for tomorrow. There are only a few more things I want to tweak on the website and then hopefully it'll pretty much run itself. Then I'm going to attack my "studio," which unfortunately looks like this right now:     Eeep!

       Hello to anyone coming over here from  urlLink Moleskinerie  (thanks Armand)! I thought now was just as good a time as any to publicly declare my massive crush on  urlLink Moleskine Notebooks . I have a Pocket Sketchbook that I use as a daybook. I put everything in there: appointments, school assignments, phone numbers, movie tickets, post-it notes, sketches, quotes, and I even draw and journal in it too. I loved it when it was new and pristine, but after starting to fill it up, I love it even more now that the pages are stuffed and distended, maximizing use of the elastic strap. It's small enough so that it fits perfectly in my purse, along with a zippered pouch (filled with scissors, glue and pens) I bought from  urlLink boygirlparty.com . So whenever I come across something I want to keep I just whip out my Moleskine and paste away. Oh Moleskine, where have you been all my life?  Some pages from my notebook:

      Most of the things I've been working on are part of bigger pieces, so my inch count is way down. No fear, I'll make it up when I finish them. This photo is from drawing class, using one of the photos of myself that I showed here previously. I had a little trouble at first and was worried I wouldn't be able to pull it off, but after getting one eye done I figured out that I just had to take it a little slower and really take my time to get the shape right before I did anything else.       I'll finish this piece at least by Monday, because that's when it's due in class, but I'm hoping for a little bit sooner. We're supposed to create a tattoo on the skin, and I'm still doing some sketches trying to figure out what I want those to look like. This is 24x18, so when finished it will come out to 424 completed inches.
