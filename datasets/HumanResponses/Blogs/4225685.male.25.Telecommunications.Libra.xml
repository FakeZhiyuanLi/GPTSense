      A few years back I collaborated with Skinnycha (I'm now going to officially change his name to Crackhead because it's much more suiting). We organized a graduation party for the local high school. We came up with some bullshit company name and had his uncle bankroll us. It wasn't anything spectacular but we put a lot of effort into it. We had a friend design a website and we made flyers that a couple of friends passed out at the school. A pager number was even used as an event line, so people could call for inquiries. We had a venue picked out, djs to spin, a chinsy ass laser, lights, and smoke machines. The set up would somewhat resemble a rave but we planned to play hip hop as well. Anyways, on the day of the party, we had a couple visitors while we were getting everything ready. Two pigs. I mean two RCMP officers. It was like they were playing "good cop, bad cop." The bad cop was saying shit like, "you know if kids bring drugs in here and someone dies, you're liable." I was like, "yeah, I know." He kept on using other lines of intimidation but I didn't fuckin' budge. I was playing the asshole kid who knew it all, cause I didn't give a fuck. I don't think he liked that. The good cop seemed embarrassed by the way his partner was going about things. He was apologetic, but I was already pissed and pretty much had enough. Our conversation ended and they left. Before they left though he informed me that they were gonna set up shop out on the street that led to our venue. I didn't give a fuck, what are you still trying to scare me, go ahead. So our party begins and a few people start showing up, this however would be the only people that would attend. The RCMP pretty much locked us down. They had a couple cops patrolling the parking lot, and a road block set up on the street that led to our venue. They were turning every car load of kids away. I guess the kids were getting busted for carrying booze but I also found out that the cops were telling people that our party was canceled. Fucking sons of bitches. I hate them. I wish eternal perdition upon all their lives. WHORES. We then found that they had almost the whole fleet hanging out at the gas station a half a block away. I really think they should be spending their time much more constructively. Like maybe, out catching real bad guys. You know.....the guys who commit home invasions, the token perverts, the smut peddlers. Not a couple guys trying to provide an outlet of fun for the local high school's graduation. It was funny, cause the cops did a walk through our party and you could just smell the oozing arrogance. Like they were the shit, because they'd shut this party down. Pompous assholes, I'll fuckin' remember this. It wasn't all negative though, I had one guy give me the "head nod." The "head nod" is an action that lets you know that you threw a good party. It's him saying "awesome party man, thanks for organizing it." Another person was actually verbal about it with Crackhead. He was flying on E, so maybe that's what influenced his comments. I always wondered exactly how the cops found out about the party and why they were so stringent with us. Apparently a few parents informed the cops. They thought it is was gonna be a full blown, all night, rave. Instead it was a full blown, all night, disaster.

      So I was over at my friend's yesterday and we started watching the Olympics. They were showing a repeat of the Men's All Around Gymnastics. The camera panned to this American athlete named Paul Hamm. This was the first time I've ever heard of him because I really haven't been paying too much attention to the Olympics so far. The commentators informed us that prior to this competition he had contributed to just winning the Silver with the US Men's gymnastics team. He also has a twin brother named Morgan Hamm who was a part of that team as well, and was watching in the stands. The commentators, Al Trautwig and Tim Daggett, were bigging Hamm up. They were letting the viewers know that Hamm is the current world champion and that the chances of him winning the gold were great. You definitely felt that the expectations for him were incredibly high. Hamm was next to do the vault. You know, the exercise where the guy does a full on sprint, jumps off a springboard, pushes off a horse, and then does some crazy ass flip. Yeah, well that's the one I'm talking about. Hamm performs his routine but is unable to stick the landing. He completely lost his balance, falling off of the mat and almost into a judge's lap. All you could hear from Trautwig and Daggett were moans and groans. It was like the United States was about to go into a state of mourning. The words used by these articulate commentators were "disaster" and "dreams shattered." Paul Hamm's life was over, go home size up a noose and hang yourself. There is no way you can come back from that.....no fucking way. Listen you faggot ass drama queens. If I wanna hear that much fuckin' turmoil I'll quit my goddamn day job and watch soap operas until I sob so much my eyes start to bleed. So take your self induced melodrama and cram it down your throat. At least I won't be able to hear you breathe. Anyways.....where was I.....oh yeah, these guys weren't even giving Hamm any sort of chance. After his fall he went from first to twelfth. Could this guy even place for a medal? The commentators didn't think so. He had two more rotations, one on the p-bars, and one on the high bar. Dude fuckin' killed it (this is the only time I will ever use dude in a fuckin' sentence). When he was on his last rotation, the high bar, he was the final competitor to perform. He needed a 9.825 to tie with first place holder Kim Dae Eun. Hamm got a 9.837 and finished with a overall score of 57.823. He couldn't fuckin' believe it, the astonishment on his face was priceless. He had won the first Olympic All-Around title for the USA in a 100 yrs. It just goes to show "it's never over till it's over." How's that for fuckin' drama NBC?

      It was late at night, some of us were drunk, and all of us were hungry. We decided to hit up Dennys. We were all sitting inside except for one. His name is Mac. He was completely trashed and did not want to come in. Mac had been drinking Smirnoff prior to arriving at Dennys, and when Mac drinks Smirnoff, let's just say the vodka doesn't agree with him. Thus meaning he becomes intolerable, intolerant, belligerent, and completely hostile. In addition the guy is a fuckin' Scotsman, so not only do they like to build things and pound sheep with their gum boots on, they like to drink......lots. So we were sitting at a table that was right by the front window. You could see out onto the street and you could see Mac out on the sidewalk pacing back and forth. He would occasionally look in at us with a disgruntled facial expression. It was like he could smell the pungent odour of his own shit and was angry about it. That's how he looked. Obviously once in a while when his mood started to teeter from "really fuckin' pissed off" to "pissed off" he would flip us off. He would also do this "thing", where his whole head would cock back then jerk quickly forward finishing with some noise he made which I can't really explain. Anyways he decides he's gonna come in. During his travels he passes a group of Asians sitting about 15ft away from us. He then comes up with the brilliant idea to slap one of the guys in the head. Yes, that's what he did, he slapped a complete stranger in the fuckin' head. The other guys that were sitting with him were distraught and surprised. When they did realize what had happened they motioned to get up. Lucky for Mac the guy he slapped waved them off, they just proceeded to glare at us while Mac arrived at our table. Now if I remember correctly my friend Sonya said something like this (while covering her mouth) "what the fuck......did you just see that......Mac just slapped that guy in the head." The rest of us couldn't believe it but noticed that the entire table of Asians were staring us down. As this "stare down" concluded Mac just looked at us and then took off again. Retracing the route that he had just completed. We believe he went into the washroom because we could hear banging and crashing. I left to check on him and found he had ripped the paper towel dispenser off the wall. Vintage Mac. I return to our table. At this point Skye decided that he was going to make a phone call. He made his way to the pay phone which was conveniently close to the washroom and front door. He threw in a quarter and called PMcG. We couldn't see Skye though because there was a 20 ft dividing wall in the way but we did see the group of Asians get up and leave. All of a sudden we heard a thump on the wall followed by Skye screaming our names......"Goto, Manny, etc.....etc!" He was even screaming for people who weren't even there, fuckin' drunkass. I really think Skye should of dropped the phone to try and intervene instead of yelling at PMcG on the phone. PMcG really didn't know what the fuck was going on. Anyways, me and Spixican bust over to where Skye was and see that these group of Asians are pushing Mac out the frontdoor while trying to beat his ass at the same time. We follow and everyone meets on the sidewalk out front. Apparently I was flailing my arms and legs at these guys but I don't remember this. Everyone calms down.....well sort of. We had a short conversation, let me paraphrase.  Me- WHAT THE FUCK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Him- wat men....he slap me in head! (translation- what man.....he slapped me in the head) Me- WELL WHAT THE FUCK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  He then took a glance at my partner but noticed at eye level he was only looking at Spixican's midsection. Then he looked up and saw Spixican's face. He looked at his cohorts and they decided to leave. Thanks Mac your the fuckin' best..... asshole. I hope Lina reads this.

      Feb 24/2002 - Canada's Men's Hockey Team Wins Olympic Gold  When I watched the game, I was over at a friend's house with a group of people. Canada had just won and I was on the verge of tears. There was no way in hell that this party was going to stop, so we decided to see what was going on downtown. We left in two vehicles but before we got on the highway we had to make a short pit stop at Wongers. We picked up his Canadian flag, the thing was gargantuan . When we arrived downtown we began to cruise Robson St. It was fuckin' packed, people were swarming and cars were moving slower than people. Honking horns, drunk bystanders, and my favourite.....the RCMP. Mental note: my friends + booze + driving + cops = STUPID FUCKIN' IDEA. So we're driving down Robson at .3 km per hour when my friend decides he's going to sit out on top of his car with his legs flailing through his sunroof. I decide to join him. He was the bearer of the Canadian flag and was swinging it back and forth. It was so big it was taking out people on the sidewalk and cars in oncoming traffic.....it was fuckin' dope. All of a sudden we pass a group of cops and one of them yells, "HEY get down from there!" Or maybe it was "HEY put that flag down!" I don't fuckin' remember. The only thing going through my mind at that point was.......alright hereeee weeeee goooooo. We disregard what the cop yells at us and continue on. Unfortunately for us the RCMP had their little friends, the plain clothed cops. These are the guys that pull us over. Although for some reason, I wasn't in that car anymore, I found myself following in my other friend's van. We were a few car lengths back and able to watch the scene unfold. One cop tells my friend Skye to get out (who wasn't driving in the beginning but seemed to be driving at that point). The conversation sort of went like this.  Cop-Have you been drinking son? Skye-Man.....I can't even see your face!  Well, that was easy, the cop shelled out a DUI for Mr. Skye. While this happened my other two friends riding passenger in that car (Gorilla and Skinnycha) were out on the sidewalk surrounded by the Narc looking motherfuckers with earpieces. Gorilla was ripped out of his tree. When you add the fact that he was a 240 pound roid monkey who resembled Vin Diesel at that time, he can look rather imposing (now, he's a 280 pound roid monkey). Especially when he starts punching the walls. Skinnycha is beside him and if I can remember correctly he was probably lipping off all the cops. Now a rather large group of cops are trying to surround Gorilla and Skinnycha. Obviously they approached with caution because there was a belligerent monkey beating the shit out of the walls. Lucky for them they were able to calm him down. I don't remember if they cuffed Gorilla but Gorilla did have something interesting to say to the cops. It went sort of like this, "just.....just......umm......don't call my parents.....please." HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH. I'm sorry. That's just fuckin' funny. I mean think about it, when a 240 pound roid monkey who looks like he can benchpress you with one arm using his pinky says, "just.....just.....umm.....don't call my parents," you have to find the hilarity in that. Anyways while all this is going on, Skinnycha who looks like a miniature version of Ghandi minus the turban is begging the cops to arrest him too. What do the cops do? Well, they arrest him obviously. The more the fuckin' merrier. So we got Ghandi and a Gorilla in the back of a police cruiser, an impounded vehicle and thousands and thousands of fellow Canadians having a great ol' time passing by. I love it. I love my life. Fortunately they didn't get thrown into jail. The cops just dumped them outside the police station and we picked them up. We then went on the search for the impounded car and then headed home. An eventful night I thought. Can't wait for Canada to win it all again.

      We had our hockey windup last Friday. Shaune, a teammate of ours hosted us at his lavishly furnished condominium. The night didn't start there though, it actually started at my place. A few of my friends showed up and felt that it was a must to begin drinking. Burfag, started pouring drinks, and the first drink he poured was straight Crown Royal. Mmmmmmmmm, you're such a smart tarbender. My other two friends winced in pain as they watched him pour and they started calling for a mixer. The only thing I had in the fridge that remotely resembled a mixer was......fuckin' orange juice. Now I mean, OJ and Crown Royal don't really go hand in hand and the fact there was more Crown Royal than OJ in these fucking drinks made it incredibly disgusting. The words that were ringing through my head were..... awesome.....this is just awesome. We left my house and hit the liquor store. Our name for the hockey team is the Olde Englishmen. This refers to the 40oz bottles of eight percent malt liquor called Olde English. Since we are the Olde Englishmen it would be fitting to drink Olde English. So we go to the liquor store and pick up a more than satisfactory supply. I also happened to bring with me a beautiful Stella Artois glass. Perfect for pouring eight percent malt liquor into and then chugging within seconds. I'm a fuckin' genius. We get to Shaune's house, everybodys mingling and the OEs are cracking. Good ol' Stella had become the house whore and was pretty much on everybody's lips. Before I could even muster the strength to blurt "I'm fuckin' hammered" there was no more fuckin' OE and everybody was.....well..... hammered. It was a goddamn gong show. Apparently my friend Skye decided to start drinking some more Crown Royal.....straight. They had purchased a two six of CR that I forgot about. This would deliver a fatal blow to Skye's entire body, punishing him for the next day. Now just to cut this story a little short I'm going to skip to the end of this incredible night. We're all out on the street trying to figure out how the fuck we're all gonna get home. We have a couple of other teammates trying to convince us to ride with them but we don't want to cause they're hammered as well. So finally being the rocket scientist that I am, I get fed up with all of the waiting and tell Skye (who was bent over dry heaving at that very moment) to give me his keys. He does. I take his keys start up his car and ask if anyones coming. Burfag trys to remove the keys from the ignition but I remove his hands from the car. I ask one more time if anyones coming. Burfag then says "I'm not driving with you, you're fuckin' drunk." With that I just take off and leave all of them to walk (which they already decided that they wanted to do). The funny thing is, while I was almost home I went through a yellow light. I didn't fly through it, I just coasted through, but guess who came around the corner just after. Mr Policeman. I came up to a 4 way stop to turn left and he whipped up on my right and took a good look at me. I proceeded with my left turn and he kept going straight. Close call. He should of arrested me and thrown my ass in the drunk tank. I know I'm a fuckin' idiot. I promise I won't do it again.
