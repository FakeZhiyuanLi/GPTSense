Meet mummy go "Ding Tai Feng" high tea... we ordered my fav red bean paste dumplings, shrimp n meat dumplings, vege n pork ribs noodles (which was suprisingly quite yummy!) hehe very full...  Supposed to go dwn to Cuppage Plaza to look for e security uncle for some "tips" but cant find him... so based on my feelings, i bought h-d for the match of Portugual vs Holland... but so many ppl say Holland will win but i dun like Holland leh... (e players look so weak n girly!) haha n also i hate orange color!!! hahahaha n also becoz my boss mentioned tat he will chose Holland!!! tat makes me not to chose Holland more!!!

A guy tat my fren like... can u imagine e 1st time i "know" him is thru my fren who dragged me along to bio him... (still rem e scene where we hide behind the bustop juz to bio wat bus he take... haha)  but juz when my fren is happily tracking him dwn, he had begun his tracking too...but on ME! (he actualli followed me hm! can't believe ritez?) i was so scared tat i called my fren n told her. she dun believe @ 1st n she actualli call n confront him! He admitted, my fren was sad n me so paisah...  Dun knw hw he finalli got my num n started calling me everyday... @ tat time (sec2) dun knw wat bgr realli mean, turned him dwn, but he nv give up n in fact put in more effort. hehe realli got touched by wat he did.(he will wait for me everyday after class till 6pm @ e bustop as he is in e am session n me pm session) finalli after 2 yrs, my heart melts... hehe     picture of us in school...    As both of us r in e same sch, we meet practically everday in sch n our wkends are either movie or dinner (sounds boring but me feel happy wif him ard) geez ;p ... rem on my 17th bd, he actualli bought me a Esprit watch n a bouquet of roses for me.

Do u believe in fate? After 4yrs, we met again @ another frens bd (e 1st impression: wah he become more yantaoz n fit! hehe) n he started contacting me again... n e "sparkles" juz started all over again. by then i am already working n he signed on wif navy... My wkends will be waiting for him to booked out then will either go for a movie, watch vcd @ his house, cook for him, pack his rm, go shopping, etc     picture taken on my 21st birthday @ my chalet!   Thk u guys should knw tat i m a very stubborn gal who seldom give in, i refuse to give in wat he expects frm me n he will compare me from his ex-gf. I hate ppl who compare me wif some1 else! (esp to my luv rival!)   Due to stubborness n anger, i brought up the break-off again, he refused but i insisted. he finalli give in and guess wat? A few mths bk on his bd, I bought him a GUESS limited edition watch, he returned to me saying tat: " If 1 day when my anger went off, then i can give the watch bk to him n he will always be there waiting for me." (touching ritez?)  I realli cant imagine myself... i was so angry tat time tat i SOLD e watch away! I realli sold it away! onli after tat then i realized tat i regretted! No more watch means there is nothing turning bk for me liaoz! sobsob... Everything is gone... till now, i still regret it but there is nothing i can do. I threw my chance away n nv able to get it bk again... :(   Heard tat he has a gf nw (realli envy tat gal)...... Hope that e gal will cherish a great guy like him... All e best to u, my "fren".....
