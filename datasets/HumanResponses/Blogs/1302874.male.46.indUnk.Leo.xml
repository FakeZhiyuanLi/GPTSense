       The start of my class is two weeks from today.  I have spent most of the day in a state of sheer terror.  I am having so many doubts about performing.  The only problem is the material.  It'll be my material.  What if it sucks?  Surely to God the instructor will tell me "your material sucks" beforehand.  At least then I'd know what to expect. I did not do what I should have today, which is find out more information about the class, where it is, am I really registered properly, can I duck out of this shit, you know, those things. It has been on my mind to ask Linda if she'd be mad if I don't do this.  Earlier today I would have just changed it to something else, by the way.  But when I think about it, she was so concerned that I wouldn't like this in the first place, so she had to have imagined that I might not do it, at some point.  I don't think she'd be mad.  She'd be disappointed, not in me, but mainly because she would have failed at Christmas gift-giving. As I told people about this over the last couple of days, I was reminded by many of them of the funny things that I have said in the past.  Funny thing is, I cannot remember a single one of them on my own.  Trouble.

       OK, here it is, the official template.  I didn't go all fancy due to 1) time constraints and b) lack of technical know-how.  Enjoy.

       We have a dog.  We were going by a Petsmart store today, and saw it, and adopted it.  I cannot believe I have a dog.  I began to think about it.  I love dogs, and I've been around dogs all my life.  This is the first dog I've had since I was in college.  I did not even realize that fact, and it hit me pretty hard.  I could have sworn that I have always had a dog.  This all happened because I wanted a latte from Starbucks.  There's a Starbucks in the Super Target, right beside the PetSmart.  I'm on a first-name basis with the people at the Starbucks. Every weekend, the local animal adoption societies set up out front of the pet store.  This is all on the other end of the shopping complex I work at, so I'm there a lot, and always check out the new dogs on my lunch break.  Linda and I were driving by, and I made the turn for coffee.  She spotted this miniature schnauser right away.  We went over, and spent some time with it.  It's cute, it's really mild-tempered, and it can't bark loud.  The next thing I knew, we were writing the check.    I'm still amazed.  Linda got so excited that she started crying in PetSmart.  We can't pick the dog up yet, though.  The rescue people spay all dogs before they get adopted, so she has to go through the operation on Monday.  They also have to check her for heartworms, and get her up-to-date on shots.  I'm glad of all that, because it's things that we would have done anyway.  They're taken care of.    I admire the people who operate animal rescue organizations like this one.  It takes a lot of commitment on the part of the individual.  It's a last-chance place for some of the animals.  I wish all those people the best.    So, let the pictures commence.  As soon as I get some taken, they'll be on the Internet.  I cannot wait to introduce this dog to the two cats who, in their own minds, have it made.  One has never even been around a dog in her life, other than the one time a friend brought a chihuahua over.  She didn't attack it, but I have never heard a sound like that in nature.  That cat has no tail, so when she gets excited her whole ass gets fuzzy.  This is going to be fun.  This may turn out to be the most expensive latte I ever had.

       I gave up the schedule for today on the previous post.  I got up this morning, went to rehab, weighed, and found that I've lost 19 pounds since the April 23.  I owe that to my new eating habits, and to the exercise.  I also owe a large portion of gratitude to my wife, who has lost 47 pounds since the first of the year.  I tell this to people, and they just shake their heads.  Then they ask for her diet.  You know, I can give out her diet all day long.  I can have her come explain it, define terms, recommend habits, and tatoo it on the inside of their eyelids so that they see it when they sleep.  The fact remains that she is committed.  These people asking how she did it, tell me, tell me, please, are looking for the answer.  The quick way out.  The cure.  (My other blog.)  They don't have the committment.  They don't have the want.  They have not seen the goal.  They have not looked inside themselves and seen what is in there that drives their dreams.    She has.  They will never do what she's done, at least until they discover in themselves the reasons for doing it.  I admire her for what she has accomplished.  I applaud her for the effort it took to do as much as she has so far.  I look forward to watching her accomplish the rest of her goal, because I can see it happening now.  I enjoy seeing the changes and enjoy the celebration as she accomplishes more every day.

       Boy, am I tired.  I went to rehab this morning.  Left the house at 7, only had to go 12 miles.  Took me nearly 45 minutes.  I did the treadmill, the bike, the pro bike (with the different settings to make it harder, like you were really going to ride a bike with your hands  and   feet pumping at the same time) and listened to a lecture on angioplasty that a sixth-grade schoolgirl could have sat in on and then answered the questions.  There were actually patients in the class who did not know what the main purpose of an angioplasty was.  Incredible, especially when you realize that most of them had been through one (or two).  I am the youngest person in the 8am group.  Funny thing is, three years ago I was the youngest person in the group.  Anyway, then I followed this morning's work with 12 hours of solid work at work.  Tomorrow, I have to be up at 6am again, and do the rehab thing again, except that I have to go to work at 10am, so that I can be home by 9:30pm, so that I can go to bed, so that I can be up at 4:30am on Friday to be at work at 5:30am.  This is going to be a long eight weeks of rehab.  But I've lost 17 pounds since the end of April.

        urlLink Google Search: Cory Burell   Cory Burell, a teacher in Texas, wants all of the Christian faithful to move to South Carolina, and then secede from the Union.  That's probably a good idea, in a twisted sort of way.  What does he plan to do with Myrtle Beach?  And of course, then they'll have their own naval base, which needed to be reopened anyway.  And you couldn't pick a better state to do it in, given their penchant for secession from the Union and all.  Ya'll come!

       The beach condo is paid for.  Man, am I ready for a vacation.  Between cardiac problems and fighting killer scorpions, it's been a long time since I relaxed.
