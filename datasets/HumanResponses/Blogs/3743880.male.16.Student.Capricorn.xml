      What pisses me off most about people is when they judge people by what music they like. No, not like in high fidelity...but by telling people they could never understand a type of music and things like that.   This started out way back when I was in something like 6th grade. I had finally gotten a CD player, and one of the first CD's I bought was blink 182. It was like..."Woah," because I had only listened to bubblegum stuff on a pop station before that. I eventually worked my way into the rock scene with other numerous CD's. All my friends, and especially this girl liz, loved Blink. We went to their concert with green day, bought all their cd's, etc..etc... We would argue about songs, and download all their music videos and stuff. It was cool back then.   Present day (2004), I guess the cool thing is to not like Blink 182? People think it makes them look better if they are above Blink 182. They think that if you can listen to pink floyd and DMB, then you can't listen to Blink 182. I don't know about them, but I can claim to have done that a lot. So what if you think it's cool not to listen to them? The plain fact is that their music sounds good so I'm going to listen to it. That goes for everything.  Then comes the other people who claim that no one can be punk except for them. There is this one girl by the name of emily slagel. She claims that she listened to green day as a little kid, and that no one else could have. This makes her   punk  . I didn't buy their CD as a kid, but my dad did, and I listened to it. Does that count? I have news for Emily though. She must like the image of being punk rather than being punk, because I distinctly remember her loving the song, "This I promise you." by Nysnc  A couple more things and I'm done. It's ok to like classical music...admit it.....you like it. I'm not talking about mozart and bach. I'm not to fond of them either. What I'm talking about is movie themes. Who doesn't whistle the star wars theme song? I love all 3 LOTR soundtracks, and the spider-man theme is always growing on me. The passion soundtrack is amazing, and so is the score for Big Fish. If you don't like that kind of stuff fine, but if other people do, respect them for it. Well, unless they like really bad EMO and try to wear buddy holly glasses...in that case make fun of them. Or if they are a white kid wearing their hat slightly sideways and says words like "Fool" or "Owned," or "You got served" In that case beat the shit of them.  My philosophy is listen to what you like. It's simple and works well. (Too bad radio stations can't see that, instead of promoting shitty artists) Give me my own radio station and I'd have twice as many listeners as the Top one in pittsburgh, garunteed.

      Ok I'm bored of ragging on people, so since I got off work early, I'll write about some movies I saw recently. Reviews are gay, so I'll just write what I want  Kill Bill Vol. 2: If you know, or maybe don't know, but this movie is the 2nd half of what should have been one fucking long movie. Anyways they split it in two pieces; this being the better half. To tell you the truth I thought they looked gay at first...it was a woman who did kung fu, none of two are very amusing on screen. But I heard it was good, so I bought the first one when it came out, and got my dad to take me to see the second one (I'm 16, He pays my ticket, he gets me admission). I can see why people wouldn't like this movie, it's much more slow paced than the first one, but in my opinion that kind of makes it better. What was cool, was when Her(the bride/ Beatrice) and Elle went at it in Budd's trailer. Speaking of Budd, he also became my favorite character, making me sympathetic to his eventual death. What pissed me off (in a good way), was that Elle had to kill him...with a snake.  Grossest Part? When Uma thurman pulls out Elle's other eyeball, then proceeds to step on it while the camera is zoomed in. My rating (out of four) **** Go see this movie, but see part 1 first    Miracle What a cool movie. I knew the Americans beat the Russians in hockey like rocky beat the guy up in one of my other favorite sports movies. What I didn't know was the story behind it. Theres no denying its good, but theres nothing special about it. Maybe it seemed cooler to me because I had taken a few hits before I got home and watched it. Oh well, that's about all there is to it. *** It's worth watching  21 Grams This movie ranks up there among with Requiem for a dream and Pi for the weirdest movies I have ever seen. That doesn't mean it's not good though. My English teacher suggested this to me. To give you a little background 21 grams means how much weight you loose whenever you die. It has nothing to do with drugs, although they are used in the movie. The premise of it is that Sean Penn is a smoker, and gets lung cancer..he knows he's going to die unless he gets a heart transplant or something like that. Naomi Watts lives happily with her two daughters and her husband...till they all get hit by a car (driven by benicio del torro). You get background on him too, and you are sympathetic towards him. Since the husband died, they give his heart to sean penn. The little girls die also, but its not important. Sean Penn becomes healthy, Benecio is torn between turning himself in and running, and Naomi Watts just sits at home and mourns. Her and Sean Penn eventually hook up, and then the shit hits the fan. I wouldn't want to ruin the ending..... *** 1/2 Weird   Mystic River  Fuck lost in translation....that was so overrated and boring, this is the real deal. While my favorite movies of all time are LOTRs, this should have won if LOTRs didn't. All of the performances are amazing, and it's a great story, great directing too. Kevin Bacon, Sean Penn, and Tim Robbins were all friends as kids. Tim Robbins gets abducted then, and molested by two men before he escapes. He never fully recovers mentally. Kevin Bacon becomes a cop, and Sean Penn becomes a mafioso guy who owns a grocery store somewhere in Boston. Sean Penn's daughter dies, linking all three of them together as adults. This is probably the best murder mystery movie I have ever seen....not that I've seen that many, and not to jump to conclusions. A little slow paced, but it's not too too bad. Good ending. ****

      rainey and andrea make me want to get my nose pierced, and then shove it in their face. That would feel good  Got my ear pierced on vacation, Dunno why, I just did. In fact I do know why. It was because I'm tired of people thinking I wouldn't do something like that. To show people like her that I am capable. When I showed them they were like.."Oh.." Everyone else said how cool it was or how its faggish. That's cool with me. I'd like to get it pierced in my cartilage too. It would be cool to get some fake ones with the magnets, and stick them all over my nose and body, and be like "How do you like me now?"

      If your too lazy to read my profile, I am 16, and in 10th grade living in Pittsburgh Pa, but not really cause it is a suburb called Allison Park, in which   The Bubble   A.K.A. hampton township. Here (and I don't know if this applies to anywhere else in the world)the girls are very uptight about everything...and what do guys my age want to do? Bone Girls? Well ya, but just get some...maybe even kiss? But no, not in hampton, we just settle for the old "Let's hold hands." So now I present you with a passage from the book of Nick Hornby. The book is called High Fidelity. It shocked me at how true this passage is. Without further ado.......  "Read any women's magazine and you'll see the same complaint over and over again: men-those little boys ten or twenty or thirty years on-are hopeless in bed. They are not interested in "foreplay"; they have no desire to stimulate the erogenous zones of the opposite sex; they are selfish, greedy, clumsy, unsophisticated. These complaints, you can't help feeling, are kind of ironic. Back then, all we wanted was foreplay, and girls weren't interested. They didn't want to be touched, caressed, stimulated, aroused; in fact, they used to thump us if we tried. It's not really very suprising, then, that we're not much good at all that. We spent two or three long and extremely formative years being told very forcibly not even to think about it. Between the ages of 14 and 24, foreplay changes from being something that boys want to do and girls don't, to something that women want and men can't be bothered with.....The perfect match, if you ask me, is between the   Cosmo   woman and the fourteen-year-old boy."  The truest thing I've ever head.

         I guess the prospect of Ocean City, New Jersey is really better than the real thing. It's like "Wow cool, a house on the boardwalk..," But the boardwalk is so-so, and the beach is over-rated. Instead of boring you with my experience, I'll just give you the facts of why it's not that great  1) Music When going to the beach, you picture in your head (At least I do) surfer music (which is ironic, because it has nothing to do with surfing). You'd think with all the artsy beach bums down here, you could at least find a good record shop. I was hoping to find something righ out of "High Fidelity." No such luck. I mean, you have millions of food joints, suglass huts, and   water ice   stores. Although there is one store. It has like a real broad selection. Too add to my disappointment, all the CD's were at least 15$. If it was a double disc it would be something like 35$.  Now I wanted to purchase A DMB live CD. It didn't matter which one. I had enjoyed the   Live in Central Park  .   So to conclude, the only store that sells CD's, is a little store on the boardwalk of OC. Next time I'll save 5 bucks and buy the CD at best buy. Or better yet, I'll burn the CD.    2) My friends In years past vacation has been fun with the family. Well, in years past I was like 10 years old. Girls still kind of had cooties, and your parents weren't that bad to hang out with.  This year I wanted to invite my friends on vacation. At first I went to Adam. Adam is a cool kid, the kind of person you always want to hang out with, and can be relaxed and joke around...you don't have to watch what you say. I asked adam through AIM, but (you think this excuse is lame, wait till you hear peters or vinnies) BUT his sister has a fucking dance recital. His sister is what? Like 12? Tell me you'd rather watch her dance around for 2 minutes, than come on vacation. Whatever, I just don't like it when people beat around the bush. It's fine, I'll just move onto someone else.  Now before I jump to the next person, I'll tell you my reasoning for inviting the people I did (or tried). Matt-going to a clarks concert..thats cool, I would have liked to go too. It's a legitamate excuse...He already had the tickets Ryan-is going to camp with me. Camp is in a whole week. The last thing he or I would want to do is spend another week with each other. Enough said.  Now.....peter...peter,peter,peter. Peter's always been my friend. Well, since middle school anyways. Our whole friendship revolves around us arguing. Now peter. Peter has never had a girlfriend. When I say that, I mean that he never even got the label, never got kissed by someone of the opposite sex. We are notified of this constantly by this. So put yourself in my position, and think about it. He's the logical choice. Invite him, he might get some action, and he'll stop complaining I have asked my dear friend peter to come to camp with me for the past 2 years. He's always had some shitty  excuse like he had a class to take. Something like CCAC (community college of Allegheny County), it was like a computer class. It's undertandable, but he sent his money in both times and never went. Needless to say, he never went to his   class   anyways.  So Peter, how would you like to go? I try not to let myself think that he might go, because it will be the same old excuse he always uses about a computer class. After a week of bullshitting me, he replies that he has another computer class.   This is yet another example of how gay my friends can be sometimes   My final,final last resort is Vince. Vince is an only child. I don't know how weird it would be to go on vacation with vince, but it was worth a shot.  To clue you in Vince's family is a little weird. They live in West Virginia, which is a little compensation for why they are like they are. Everytime his grandma gets a paper cut on his finger, Vince has to make the pilgramage to West Virginia to see her. Anways, this has nothing to do with what I was getting at.  Vince also has what he calls an "uncle." I have a few Uncles of my own, but not quite like his. In fact, he's not vinces uncle. He's some burnout band member who is friends with Vinces dad. Why does vince call him his uncle? I haven't the slightest idea. He supposedly has some band that is   REALLY REALLY GOOD  . According to vince they could have been huge. But they weren't. I guess they are still together, and vince was going to see their concert. He can be such a dush bag sometimes.  I want to keep listing reasons why the vacation can suck, but I'll stop here. So keep in mind what we have learned here.  1.) If you can't bring a friend on vacation, don't go at all 2.) If you're friend claims he has a computer class during your vacation, it is total bullshit, don't believe him 3.) If you want to find music anywhere close to a beach, don't count on finding it anywhere, and if you do-it won't be cheap. Bring you're own music, and burn your CD's 4.) You need a life if you are reading this

      Anyone who is reading this knows what AIM is. It revolutionized/ruined the way people communicate. I for one, hate it, butI am forced to use it anyways since it is the only way my friends talk.  Pro: Easier to talk to people through it  Con: It makes you afraid to use the phone   Pro:Easier to say what you want  Con: 99% of the time it's either something perveted or something someone doesn't want to hear   Pro:You can be anonymous  Con: No one knows who you are   Pro:Better for making plans  Con: They have already made plans with 5 other people that night through AIM   Pro:you can block people you don't like  Con: Chances are they have 4 other screen names they can IM you on, and if they don't, they will make one because they think they are smart.   Pro: All you have to do is type your message and hit enter  Con: It makes idiots out of people, because they think that LOL, BRB, i, ROFLMAO, are real words. Get a Fucking life   Here is a typical profile of some  woe is me  girl who changes her info every 10 seconds because she thinks people read it.

      Bill: Superman stands alone. Superman did not become Superman, Superman was born Superman.&nbsp;When Superman wakes up in the morning, he is Superman. His alter ego is Clark Kent. His outfit with the big red S&nbsp;is the blanket he was wrapped in as a baby when the Kents found him.&nbsp;Those are his clothes. What Kent wears, the glasses the business suit,&nbsp;that's the costume. That's the costume Superman wears to blend in with us. Clark Kent is how Superman views us. And what are the characteristics of Clark Kent?&nbsp;He's weak, unsure of himself... he's a coward. Clark Kent is Superman's critique&nbsp;on the whole human race, sort of like Beatrix Kiddo and Mrs. Tommy Plumpton.

      Camp has to be one of the only places I ever look forward to going to. This past week I went to camp for what will be the last time I will be a camper. (When you get to be 16 or 17 it's your last year). Lets Back up a little bit.  4 Years ago my sisters friends told her about a camp she liked, and wanted my sister to go with her. I went myself without bringing any friends to try the camp out. This camp has many different sessions consisting of one week sessions, two week-ers, and two sessions of family camp (one week I think) each summer. This camp is run by Episcopalian, but it's not one of those we-force-you-to-be-Christian type of things. You get to sing contemporary worship in the chapel every night, which actually isn't half bad because of the songs you sing (my favs: Let it Be, Stand By me, Lean on me, etc..etc..). One again, I'm getting ahead of myself. The camp is in Ohio (yeah I know, Ohio sucks-steeler fans). It's in a little middle of nowhere town called ashtrabula, in a place called conneaut. Oddly enough it's right on lake eerie....strange because eerie is in PA.   First thing you see when you drive in there is a  L  shape of white cabins. There is a fence by the road that separates them from the highway. Behind the bottom of the L of cabins is Lake Eerie.&nbsp; To the left of the cabins is all the other stuff needed for camp......Dining hall, chapel, mac hall (campfires, art stuff, bathrooms, you get the idea), counselors lodge-if you want to call it that, and other essentials.   Camp is located on lake road a.k.a. big long ass straight road. Calvary is near the middle of the road, at the start is the harbor where the camp owns 2 sailing boats they use for electives.   Year 1- Was kind of lost for the first couple of days. Enjoyed camp. Kissed this girl (taylor I think her name was?) at the dance-It was a stupid kiss, well, looked stupid anyways. Didn't really sing any songs or get into much. Adam was my counselor, I liked him.   Year 2- Much better the second time around. Made lots of friends. Started sailing, and loved it.   Story Time:   I had met a girl named Briana and it was the last night for camp. We had held hands and done all that stuff and probably wanted to do more. Anways, It is a well known fact that behind the kaibos (bathrooms, showers, sinks) there is a back exit to both the boys and the girls room. Half of my cabin and some girls from their cabins decided to meet there that night. We did, but everyone pussied out when they got there, leaving me and briana. We decided we couldn't stay outside or else we could get caught. We couldn't go into the boys bathroom, that would be too gross. Too many people went in anyways. So it was determined that we could go into the girls room to try and make out I guess. We went into a shower stall (fully clothed), and kind of gave each other stupid looks like one of us would make a move. But since I'm a wimp I didn't do anything. Just then we heard a rumbling around noise. Briana ran out to see what was going on, and to my dismay it was not her who came into the stall next. It happened to be my counselor Chad. " uh, Hi Chad!"  He must have thought it was funny, and of course I was never punished for it. Chad muttered into my ear the whole time walking back, " your fucking lucky, your so fucking lucky" &nbsp; I kissed her before she got on the bus, I don't really keep in contact with her these days. I really liked chad (not like that, you sicko)   Year 3- Probably the most straightforward year. My counselor was zach hoover (he was so funny, he was actually a stand up comedian I think). No storys on my part for this year. I did meet a new girl (Heh, it was becoming routine) Keri, but she was different and had a great personality. I didn't kiss her, but spent much more time with her. I kept in contact with her through AIM, and.......   Year 4 (this year) - Possibly one of the best weeks of my life. My friend Ryan came, and we both signed up for the elective JC. Junior Counselor. It sounds childish, but is the best thing there is to do there. You do multiple things there like running a campfire, taking care of kids, doing devotions with that cabin (devotions-you talk about stuff before you go to bed).Keri was there, along with most people from last year. We flirted a little I guess, nothing that great, and by the way...she has a boyfriend. He works at dennys. We shall call him andy (and yes that's his read name).  &nbsp; Chad  was my counselor this year. One of the first things he mentioned to me when I arrived was that he remembered catching me two years ago. Moving on, I got JC with Cabin 1. This would be the youngest cabin (ages 6,7 im guessing?). I love the little kids, and they are awesome to hang out with. By the end of the week I knew all of them very well.&nbsp; Then comes friday. Probably the most single exciting day of camp.&nbsp; Everything happens on friday. It was the last day of electives. That included sailing with awesome wind (almost capsizing), and making a tie-dye t-shirt for JC. After that we had the banquet (good food, served by the counselors). All the counselors were being suspiciously nice to me that day. After dinner they had the tribal skit.  Let me explain this too. They divide the camp up into four teams (or tribes). Tigers, Falcons, Dragons, and Panthers. They compete in games throughout camp, and the points are tallied, and the winners are announced throughout the skit. This skits run like SNl ones, and are funny as hell. After the skit one of the counselors Alex took a stool and sat down (Alex runs the JC electives). He said there was something much more important to talk about and that was OCA. The outstanding camper award. As I recalled it was just some stupid award given to a goody goody girl who came to camp all her life. I never really payed attention. Alex pulled out a piece of paper and starting talking about how great a person this guy was. Then he said, this person is a JC. Ok well, there were quit a few JC's. He said this person is amazing with the kids. Ok, well I'm sure everyone is good with kids, nothing new. He said that this person was assigned his cabin and that he couldnt think of a better person for the award. He called my name. He told me he was very glad I got his cabin, and gave me a hug. All the other counselors chanted the We love you ben song (we love you conrad, you know, bye bye birdie?), and everyone shook my hand. I got a bible for the award with my name inside and the session that I won it. Ryan won the award too, along with one other kid.  After that I swear almost everyone in camp came up and complimented me. I had never felt so good. Chad and another counselor John talbot called me over. They said that I was so good with the kids, and that I was an awesome kid. They told me it wasn't just them who had noticed, but everybody. (this means a lot coming from them). After that we had chapel. Every Friday it is an hour long(but still just as fun). Towards the end everybody gets a candle to light. The lady minister called me, ryan, and matt up to light everybodys candle. We proceded back to the cabin with our candles, made a bonfire, and went in to do devotions. Chad gave us all ice cream sandwiches (doesnt that sound gay?)...this is a big thing for camp considering we can't have food in the cabin. Our topic for devotions was our high and low point of the week. He said his was seeing me and ryan win OCA.  After devotions came  Stratego . Note: it is now midnight. To make a long story short it's an almost impossible game, in which only the counselors and 16 and 17 year old campers play. Its top secret, and was so fun. All the guys got out in less than 2 minutes, but there were 3 girls left. Note: the people who have won in the past have become legends, they have done such things as  scaling down the cliff, army crawling by the highway for an hour, smuggling a bike,  the girls plan was faking and injury. It worked. We won. Before I write a book about camp, I think I will stop.

      The second spider-man movie is the best movie of the summer...or year, hands down. It nails everything a good movie should have.  1) Action The movie has action happening just about every 10 minutes...and it's not just some fist fight. I'm talking about fighting that ragnes from the top of buildings to a runaway subway car (which was my favorite part). Since just about 99% of the people saw it opening day, I thought that tobey maguire's most shining moment is at the end of that scene. This is when he's straining all his muscle's and shooting web in order to stop, He's screaming at the top of his lungs and his suit is ripping....good stuff (not the suit ripping, the rest)  2) Special Effects A lot of people said the effects in the first movie looked cheesy...I thought they were awesome, but w/e. When sony said they were gonna make the effects in this movie 10 times better than the best scene in the first movie. I was like, "ok, thats just them trying to get people to go see it." Well, it was that, but only because it was true. Every effect is flawless, and looks completely real. Doc. Ock's tentacles have personality, and give him more depth. Perfect  3) Acting Tobey, Alfred, Kirsten, and James all nail the parts. I always liked all of Tobeys movies but he is perfect in this. He was born to play spider man ........ok enough, if you haven't seen it, see it. If you haven't played the video game, buy it. If you haven't heard of it, get a life.
