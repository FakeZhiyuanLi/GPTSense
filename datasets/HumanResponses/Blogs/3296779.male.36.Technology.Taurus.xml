      Hiya!  Oh, I am quivering with excitement--my first blog entry.  I have nothing to say right now.  Maybe I'll have something to say later.  That's kind of the point of a blog.  To say something, I mean, but I don't want to say something unless I really have something to say, or else it will just be inane prattling, which is what I'm doing at the moment.

      I have finally been inspired to post a blog after reading some  urlLink other blogs  that reported on things I had previously only surmised.  Primarily, the thoughts have to do with the U.S. intervention in Iraq.  A very simple thing to grasp, and easy to believe, is that the U.S. is a bully trying to influence the course of a nation halfway around the world for some undignified, unjustifiable reason.  Explaining this theory, Pres. Bush, the main instigator, must be assigned a motive.  There's no lack--finishing the work of ol' pop (G.H.W. Bush), wrestling for the control of Iraq's oil, a centuries-old Masonic effort to gain control of Jerusalem, etc.  However, it's difficult to take the notion of such motives seriously.  Pres. Bush would have to be a simpleton or a madman for any of those to be true.  If you feel that Bush is a simpleton or a madman, then I suppose you've completed your little circle of logic.  The press has done what it has set out to do.  Maybe you think Pres. Bush is just stupid, that he believed faulty intel reports about weapons of mass destruction (WMD).  If you believe that he purposefully influenced those reports, ordered the CIA to come to that conclusion, then you're back up to the conspiracy theories mentioned in the preceeding paragraph.  Saddam has killed more people than atomic bombs ever have.  When you have an army of thugs and spies killing people on a daily basis, you don't really need chemical or atomic bombs.  It surprises me that people haven't realised that  Saddam  was the weapon of mass destruction.  Estimates for Saddam's body count near 2 million, while 118,661 were killed at Hiroshima and 73,884 at Nagasaki.  We found the WMD and now have it in custody--didn't hear that on the evening news, did you?  Even so, perhaps the reports of WMD were correct.  Perhaps the media has ignored the evidence, and failed to investigate because they are too busy with the sensationalism of bombs and body counts (even Michael Moore slams the press for obsessing on stories that engender fear and uncertainty).  Wouldn't it be nice to know that our intelligence was correct, which would explain how a bunch of chemical weapons mysteriously appeared in Jordan?  Perhaps the Hussein-bin Laden connections existed, even though the press is telling us it didn't exist.  Maybe they are just too busy to follow the trail because 2 more Iraqi children died today when a suicide bomber blew himself up in a market--shame on Pres. Bush for allowing that to happen!  Read some  urlLink real news  already!  Why don't we see  urlLink news stories  about the progress in Iraq?  If things are so bad in Iraq, why are Iranian folk coming there to set up shop?  Why is Iraq's exiled educated elite returning?  Because they have hope.  Because Iraq has far more freedom now than two years ago.  This is the same hope that drove Europeans to America.  My own ancestors came with the hope that they could freely practice their Protestant religion.  When push came to shove, the French came to aid the American revolutionaries in their pursuit of freedom.  How dare they get involved overseas and try to influence the course of a nation!  Oh wait--I mean, thank you, France.  We don't remember France being there for us back then, over two hundred years ago.  Chances are, if democracy takes root in Iraq, two hundred years from now Iraqis won't remember America coming in and kicking out Saddam.  If they do happen to rembmer it, the details will be forgotten.  It won't matter that some Iraqis were tortured in a prison, or that a house was bombed, or that hundreds of American soldiers died.  I'm not suggesting that we should allow torture, bomb houses, and throw our soldiers' lives away, I'm just saying that these things won't matter in two hundred years.  What  will  matter is that Saddam's regime was destroyed and that Iraq found hope.  Maybe Pres. Bush is doing for Iraq what France did for America two hundred years ago.  Maybe he's sane, and taking measured steps to improve the world.  Maybe he's giving hope to a nation that had none.  Maybe the WMD charge was legitimate, and he seized the opportunity to improve the lives of Iraqis and to make the world safer for Saddam's enemies.  We can't save every nation on earth that has a government that denies it citizens rights and threatens its neighbors.  But when that nation has the will and capability to make and deliver weapons that will kill thousands of Americans, our President is obligated to act, regardless of whether you like it or not.
