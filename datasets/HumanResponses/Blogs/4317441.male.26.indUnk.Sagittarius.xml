						   What is there to look forward to, when we should focuson what is already present?  In the midst of transition it is easy to forget what is in front of me. I am an army Company Commander for a basic training unit, which in itself is a all-consuming job, and I am also preparing for my future as a priest/chaplain, which is also energy intensive.  I have a commitment to serve these soldiers . . . and I will fulfill my duty, but now I am trying to integrate my feelings/convictions as a spiritual aspirant. It is weird and at times funny/awkward. How do I yell at a soldier, train her/him on weapons, and promote her/his warrior ethos when I am a pacifist. It is also somewhat uncomfortable to reprimand soldiers and keep a "leader's distance" away from them. Last month I had to tell a soldier that his mother died. I wanted to cry with him, but I felt I couldn't for professional reasons -- that really tore me apart. I wanted to be human but felt inhibited because I "should" appear mechanical. I then began to notice how others put on the masks of machines when on duty . . . it didn't feel human.  This whole process of discernment while performing my army duties has shown that I am far from living an integrated life --- combining the spiritual with the official and still living professionally, humbly, and humanly. This is nothing to feel guilty about, but it compels to fully be who I am . . . to face my limitations honestly and to go forth with love.

						   This is the first Blog I've ever done. Don't know how it will go or if it will be something that will last.  Other thing thing I have started is my discernment process to be a Priest in the Episcopal Church. Met initially 2 days ago and will have a formal meeting today. I am a bit excited. For those who don't know what it is. Discernment is a group process of helping someone discern their calling to serve in the Church community. I have to say calling and not identify who's doing the calling. There are those who say it is God's calling . . . I don't know if there is a God.  For me, I believe that we are called to live to fully be . . To be fully human in an authentic and honest relationship with life, love, and God. In whatever context that it occurs, be it as a preacher, lawyer, Wal-mart cashier, or CEO . . . that, not necessarily irrelevant, but not as important as the calling itself. The way we live our lives is most imperative. Federick Beuchner summarized his writings in " Listen to your life . . . if God exists and is God is taking an active part in the world . . the same God we experience through Jesus . . . then listen . .. listen to what God is saying to you. "  So that's what I'm doing . . . listening and being open to what is said and what is already present.
