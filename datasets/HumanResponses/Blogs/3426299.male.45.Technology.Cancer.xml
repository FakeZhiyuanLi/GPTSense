       I with my family will be going to the TMX Family Day today after SM Cebu shopping. I will post the pictures by next week in my WEB site at: http://www.wilmarguday.homedns.org/ for you to see.    &nbsp;  I failed to update my homepage until now 7/17/04 due to my programming job. Currently I'm updating my payroll program. Also, the pictures taken were not in good quality since my kid (Bon) finger is covering the lens in most of the pictures taken from TMX :). Anyway I have one picture below for you to see...hehehe.

       My brother sent additional pictures and I already uploaded it in my homepage. This time I was not using table for the thumbnails formating instead I arrange it using CSS. I will be starting to update my web site removing table layout starting today.   Update of my MAZDA B2200 Back Glass Broken - My boss ask me how much is the cost. I returned my memo with the quoatation which is 2,500.00. My contact was Vangie and told me that they are located near cor. Katipunan, M. Bacalso St. I'm hoping my company can help....    &nbsp;  Update 07/17/2004 for my Mazda Back Glass:    &nbsp;  I'm glad that my boss pay the glass and I just pay the new glass tinting for my car which cost 3,700.00. See my new back glass below.  &nbsp;

       My brother Noel sent me pictures of my parents and his family in Manila. My parents went in his place to process their US Tourist Visa to go to my sister's place.     &nbsp;   My family was disapointed with the US embassy by denying tourist visa for my parents. This was the 2nd time my question is why? My parents were already old, ages 74 and 64 and if they suspect that&nbsp;they will not comeback to the Philippines they are wrong since only my sister is in the US they just want to visit. Maybe they think my parents are terorist :) over...SHIT USA....

       While working my car is always park outside since no space allocated for me inside my work as parking area. Last May 19, 2004 my car's back glass was broke in the parking area along the street. I don't know how and who did it, I asked the guard and the did not noticed it also. I asked help to the company I work and my boss told me to wait until Monday till my big boss arive fron his trip. Today she email me since my big boss trip is extended. Is it proper to ask them for help? The PDF format letter that I made can be viewed at http://www.wilmarguday.homedns.org/docs/parking problem.pdf.
