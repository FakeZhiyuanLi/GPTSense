      Jose Mourinho insists his  urlLink Chelsea  side can be the one to end England's trophy famine in Europe - even though he likens them to a seven-week-old baby.  Mourinho, whose counter-attacking Porto side beat Monaco to become European champions last season, has started his time at Stamford Bridge with two wins - albeit scruffy 1-0 successes.  While champions Arsenal have started in style with nine goals against Everton and Middlesbrough, critics have poured scorn on Chelsea's defensive dourness.  He asked why no English team has not won the Champions league since 1999.``I don't think I have to answer that question but people from this country should.  ``I think, one day, it will be possible, though, for this Chelsea team to do it. One day.  ``Of course, I want more from my team. We can improve our quality of play but at the moment we are looking at a seven-week-old baby with half the players new and a new manager.  ``I cannot see how you can compare that to a seven-year-old child, like with Mr (Arsene) Wenger at  urlLink Arsenal .  ``They were a fantastic team last season and still are. I cannot say a word against them, but he (Wenger) couldn't win the Champions League.  ``My philosophy of the game is like his - to win and also play good football.  ``If we can play beautiful, we play beautiful - I want people to enjoy it.  Up to now it has been more a case of Chelsea ``winning ugly'' - with substitute Joe Cole's deflected shot bringing all three points at St Andrew's on Saturday after Mourinho switched to 4-3-3 in the second half.  Now they face promoted London rivals Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park tomorrow night, with Iain Dowie's side desperate to atone for Saturday's 3-1 home defeat by Everton after they had the lead.  Mourinho said: ``I saw the game on video and Palace were unlucky. And now they will be thinking they cannot allow another home defeat so quickly. It will be a tough game.  ``But right now we must take care of the baby because he can barely communicate yet.  ``There is so much that must improve. What delights and amazes me is that everybody, every star, is fighting for the team.  ``And we are defending well - although in my opinion too deep against  urlLink Manchester United .  ``Against  urlLink Birmingham  it was much better and we only gave them two chances.  ``We want to play better football, that's normal - but we need time for that and players need to improve their condition because we had just four games in pre-season and the three in the United States were too early.''  Mourinho has told £24million Ivory Coast striker Didier Drogba not to fret over the two chances he wasted at St Andrews.  The coach continued: ``His time will come.  ``He could hide in the penalty area and just wait for a mistake, but like the others he is fighting for the team and making space for people.  ``He has been fantastic and can be  assured  he will not  get pressure  to score his first Premiership goal from  me .''   Even so , Drogba could be rested on the substitutes' bench tomorrow night with Serbian striker Mateja Kezman pressing for his first start.  Celestine Babayaro looks set to replace Wayne Bridge at left-back with the England international hit by a calf strain again.  Damien Duff may also figure, having proved his fitness after a dislocated shoulder with Ireland, along with #10million signing Scott Parker - who was left out of the 16-man squad on Saturday.  Mourinho said: ``I will change some players because this game is so close to the last one.  ``Some players accept it and are better for it but others maybe do not.  ``We have 22 available at the moment but in November, December and January we are going to need them all when there are suspensions, injuries and lots of international call-ups.''

      says the main reason he left Anfield was ambition and felt that had he stayed at Liverpool he would have been left in what he terms as a comfort zone.  Owen said it wasn't a difficult decision for him to leave  urlLink Liverpool  and is looking forward to a new life in Spain. In his most frank interview since leaving for the luxury life of Madrid Owen says he is driven by ambition at playing for  urlLink Real Madrid , who he calls the biggest football club in the world.  Owen said: "Since I was 10 I didn't just want to be a footballer, I wanted to be the   best   footballer in the world. There are still lots of people ahead of me but if you want to get into that bracket, you have to break out of comfort zones. That is a nutshell is why I made the life changing decision to leave Liverpool for Real Madrid.  "I have always had a burning desire to push myself and that is why I was disappointed with some of the  defeatist  reaction to my transfer. I don't know if it is an English trait to settle for what you've got but I was taken aback when the first thing some people said was 'how's he going to get into the first team'.  They didn't say 'fantastic, he's moving to the biggest club in the world.' "I would be lying if I did not admit that I spent a couple of days wondering if I shouldn't just stay at Liverpool. Part of my brain was saying 'just let your career run down, you're safe here. Your family is around you and everyone likes you'. But the majority of me was being ambitious. I had 10 days to make up my mind and for eight of them I felt the drive to better myself as a person and player."  Owen said England head coach  urlLink Sven Goran Eriksson  was a major factor in his move to Spain as he advised him to leave Anfield. Owen said: "The England head coach was among those who said that I would benefit from the fresh challenge. I am proud of myself for making that step out of the comfort zone and going for something that is a bit scary, a bit nerve racking.  Money  never  came into it and is is just   pure ambition  . "I know many of the Liverpool fans will be disappointed but I like to think it is an amicable farewell. "I never had any problems with Rafael Benitez and if the transfer to Madrid had broken down I was ready to resume my career at Anfield. If I was disloyal I'd have gone on a Bosman next summer. "I said to Liverpool that I wanted them to get a fee. OK, maybe it is not as much as they might have got a few years ago, but if I'd had three or four years left on my contract, I might have been priced out of a move."

      Chelsea are sitting pretty at the top end of the table with maximum points but successive wins by a narrow margin have left some unconvinced. José Mourinho has responded by talking in some detail about his thinking on the game  “My philosophy is to try to win and at the same time play good football, no doubt about it,” he said. “If you ask me if I prefer to win 1-0 or I prefer to win 5-0 then 5-0 no doubt.  “If you ask me if I prefer to have a very difficult match like the one we had against Birmingham or if I prefer an easy match then I prefer an easy match. If you can play beautiful, I want to play beautiful. I am not stupid.  “I want to win, I want to score goals, I don’t want to concede goals,” he continued. “I want to win every match and I want to play beautiful. I want people to enjoy it. I want the best.  “What I do not understand is that when I arrived in English football, everyone in my first press conference at Stamford Bridge were saying you know you are coming to a very difficult and tough league. Every match is a difficult match and every opponent can beat you.  “Bobby Robson, my good friend in England said the same thing. He said: ‘José, there are no matches like you have in Portugal sometimes where you beat people easily 3-0 or 4-0 and sometimes Vitor Baia in goal doesn’t touch the ball.’  “In England every match is difficult,” Mourinho agreed, “and now people are complaining because I won 1-0 in a difficult match. You tell me it is very difficult and then a month later you want me to win matches easily!”  “I told the players this morning that one day, when nobody is waiting for it, you will beat somebody four or five-nil.”  The  urlLink Chelsea  manager has on several occasions pointed to the fact that he has enjoyed less time with his players than his rivals but he has found several areas where he is already pleased with the state of his team.  “I’m happy with a fantastic team spirit, it is not normal,” he began. “I think when Silvestre was speaking before Man United’s game against us he was not wrong when he said a team cannot create a team spirit in seven weeks and they will be ahead of us. I don’t think he was wrong in that.  “But our team is a team, and that is just in seven weeks.  “The second thing I’m happy with is that you can see stars, because we have stars in our squad, and you see the stars thinking just about the team and not about themselves.  “For example if Didier Drogba is worried because he is not scoring goals and is receiving criticism, the easy thing to do is for him to stay in the box, somebody create a chance or the goalkeeper make a mistake and for him to knock the ball into the net and say I have scored my first goal in the Premiership.  “But he is not and every star in my team is fighting for the team. This is the second amazing point.  “The third point is that the team is defending well. In my opinion against Man United we defended too deep. Against Birmingham it was much, much better and the opponent had just two goal chances. One because of a mistake by Wayne which can happen. He gave a bad back pass and the second one was a throw-in. You cannot stop a throw-in. Melchiot threw the ball, there was confusion and they hit the post. They had two chances and the team is defending really, really well.  “We want to play better football, that is absolutely normal. We want to have actions in offensive terms and we need time for that. Also players as individuals need to improve their condition and that is improved by matches because our pre-season was very short.”  On the subject of whether people in England sometimes don’t appreciate the defensive side of the game as much as elsewhere, Mourinho put forth some questions.  “Football people in England should  stop  and  ask  yourselves for which reasons is English football not successful abroad,” he suggested. “For which reasons Spanish teams, Italian teams and Portuguese teams win the UEFA competitions. For which reasons the English national team with a top manager and top players go to European Championships and World Cups and they cannot win it.  “You have wonderful football, wonderful players, everything is fantastic here but when you go outside you just cannot do it since Man United won five years ago. You should think about it because it is not normal.” from  urlLink www.chelseafc.com

      ...on equalling Forest's unbeaten recordI think it’s a bonus personally, the big problem in football is when you go on the pitch and you are scared to lose. The advantage of having such a record is you just go on and you don’t worry about that, you can win, and it just helps you focus on the game you want to play. For us the enemy is confidence, and when you have a record like that it's something that helps you go on the pitch and just focus on playing football. Which is not easy.  ...on Cesc Fabregas If this boy makes between 15 and 20 games in the first team at 17 years old, without any injury, it is fantastic. For me he plays like a guy in-between 25 and 28 in the middle of the park, because of his composure and his mental strength. He has great stamina.  ...on coping defensively without Campbell or Vieira I think we can cope. I believe that for example at Everton we looked very solid. Today we didn’t look very solid. That’s maybe down to the fact that Middlesbrough are better going forward. I feel physically we were not as sharp as we were at Everton. Vieira will have a test tomorrow, and Sol Campbell for the first time will train tomorrow. He will not be fit for England in the next internationals. He could be fit for the game just after Fulham. Vieira the same, maybe next Saturday, maybe two weeks later.  ...on Chelsea I didn’t see them (on Saturday), they looked to be efficient at the moment. They are the opposite of us at the moment, we score goals, they don’t score too many goals, but they have a good base to start with. I count them still as a rival. You cannot dismiss the fact, even if you say they will take some time to adapt, they have won their first two games. To go to Birmingham and win is difficult.  ...on substitute Robert Pires To have a weapon like that on the bench is a total luxury, because you know when he comes on he can score at any moment.  from  urlLink www.arsenal.com

      Woodgate a Real departure for Madrid By John May   Woodgate moves to Real  Jonathan Woodgate represents something of a departure for Real Madrid. In paying £13.4m for the Newcastle defender, Real are not reaching for the stars but mining the earth. A player once ranked among Leeds' "crown jewels", Woodgate is not so much galactico as diamante en bruto, a gemstone to be worked and polished rather than the gift-wrapped little something out of Tiffany's that Real normally shop for. Despite being one of England's top defenders, it could be argued that for a variety of reasons, neither Leeds nor Newcastle really saw the best of Woodgate. His career has been dogged by controversy, and niggled by injury, both of which have provided hiccups, blips and interruptions to his upward spiral. Considering he broke into the Leeds team at a tender age, at 24, Woodgate should have played more than a total of 168 first-team games for Leeds and  urlLink Newcastle . He should also probably have won more than five caps for England. Since signing in January 2003, Woodgate has started just 28 Premiership matches and seven other games - less than half the games Newcastle played during that period.  A not unfamiliar picture as Woodgate lies injured But perhaps the interruption that still hangs over Woodgate was that prompted by his court case. Initially charged along with team-mates Lee Bowyer and Michael Duberry for assaulting an Asian student, the prolonged case - which collapsed once - took its toll on Woodgate. A combination of an ankle injury and his mental state kept him out for eight months, while he missed the end of the 2001-2002 season with a broken jaw, sustained in a bout of "horseplay" with a friend. The court case was also a Rubicon for his time at  urlLink Leeds . He was fined by the club for his part in the fracas, then arguably the best defensive partnership in the country was broken up when his side-kick Rio Ferdinand was sold to Manchester United. That was followed by the teeth-gritting requirement for Woodgate to play alongside Michael Duberry, who had given evidence against him in court.    WOODGATE FACTS    17 Oct 1998: Premiership debut for Leeds June 99: England debut v Bulgaria 14 Mar 2000: Charged with causing GBH and affray April 2001: Trial collapses after newspaper article Dec 2001: Found guilty of affray in re-trial May 2002: Left out of England World Cup squad 1 Mar 2003: Makes Newcastle debut after £9m move from Leeds Apr 2004: Suffers thigh injury which keeps him out of Euro 2004 August 2004: Visits German specialist to find a cure   The aftermath of his conviction for affray was even more painful as England refused to consider him for the 2002 World Cup. Woodgate's international career is that of somebody who has been in the right place at the wrong time. He has always had to dwell in the shadows of Ferdinand and Sol Campbell, but somehow whenever a window of opportunity opened, injury prevented Woodgate from clambering through it. As a result, Woodgate joins Madrid as probably the player with the least international appearances. Newcastle fans may not agree, but Woodgate's move to Real may be the making of him.  Camacho has taken a liking to goods Made in England There's no doubt that a fit and focussed Woodgate is a genuine five-tool player and that is what Real have shelled out for. Was it mere coincidence that Newcastle slapped a £50m price tag on Woodgate back in May, principally as a deterrent to  urlLink Manchester United  and  urlLink Arsenal ? Could it be that Newcastle have sold a Woodgate, unhappy at the prospect of a lack of Champions League action, to Real to keep him out of the hands of their Premiership rivals? The Bernabeu is not normally thought of as a finishing school, or Real a club who are happy to pay for potential instead of buying top-of-the-range. But it could prove to be the heated cauldron in which the rough-cut stone is forged into the polished gem.

      Arsenal stand on the verge of history against Middlesbrough on Sunday. The champions will equal Nottingham Forest's unbeaten 42-game run in the top flight if they avoid defeat. The Gunners went through last season unbeaten and started with a 4-1 victory against Everton at Goodison Park to set up another potential landmark. Wenger is unlikely to have Patrick Vieira fit, and said: "Patrick is not ready yet. I don't know when he will be ready, but he is not far away. "He needs a good preparation, and I'm convinced he will come back stronger than ever," said Wenger. Wenger will also be without Sol Campbell, who is suffering from an Achilles tendon injury. "Sol is also making progress but he won't be ready to play for three or four weeks." Jose Reyes came on as a half-time substitute in Spain's 3-2 win against Venezuela in which he set up a goal for Raul Tamudo. Wenger is unlikely to have been too impressed by the fact that both Edu, who was supposed to be resting after his summer involvement in the Copa America, and Gilberto Silva were in Haiti for a friendly with Brazil.  urlLink   urlLink

      Wenger in contract talks Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger is in talks to sign a new contract. Wenger's current deal expires at the end of the season but is keen to sort out his future at the club. "We have started contract talks and I don't think there will be any problems there," said Wenger, who has been in charge since September 1996. "I am committed to the club. I've built a team where we have a lot of good young players and, of course, I want to be part of that." Asked if there was any other job that might lure him away, Wenger said: "Not at the moment, no." Wenger is also keen to persuade Sol Campbell, Edu and Lauren to sign new deals by the end of the year. "We have had interest in Sol but we have never decided to let him go, just like with Patrick," said Wenger. "We don't want to sell Sol, we want to extend his contract and we are not far from doing that. "But it will take two or three more months before we can finalise anything with him or anyone else."

      Rooney admits prostitute visits Teenage footballer Wayne Rooney has admitted visiting prostitutes, saying he was "young and stupid." The England star made the admission after the Sunday Mirror claimed he visited massage parlours in Liverpool. "Foolish as it now seems I did on occasions visit massage parlours and prostitutes. "I now regret it deeply and hope people may understand that it was the sort of mistake you make when you are young and stupid," he said in a statement. "It was at a time when I was very young and immature and before I had settled down with Coleen." Foolish as it now seems I did on occasions visit massage parlours and prostitutes Statement from Wayne Rooney Rooney's agent Paul Stretford confirmed the statement was correct, but said he would be making no further comment. Editor of Everton fanzine, Speke from the Harbour, Mark Staniford, said he was "surprised but equally not that surprised. "I'm more interested in what he does on the football field to be honest. "If he's scoring goals for Everton then that's all i'm bothered about." The 18-year-old Everton striker was rumoured to have been unfaithful to fiancée Coleen McLoughlin in July. Ms McLoughlin reportedly discarded her £25,000 engagement ring at the Formby Point Nature Reserve near the couple's luxury home.

       The 200 million pounds spent by Roman Abramovich on his team has radically  changed  the English Premiership but the pressing question would be :has this done  any  good for the game or it has seriously compromised the competitiveness of the league? You know the case of the rich getting richer and the poor getting poorer.  Roman brought Didier Drogba to a  Chelsea  for a staggering 26million pounds. And yet a team with as rich a tradition as Everton are grateful for a 20million pound donation from an executive member of the club. And they are forced to pay that boy 50 000 pounds a week, money they certainly don't have but money hopefully that will keep the boy at Merseyside.  Those of you who watched the premiership match between  urlLink Chelsea  and a second string  urlLink ManchesterUnited  side missing 9 regulars will admit that sometimes building a team is easier than buying one.  Le Professeur , Arsene Wenger the     urlLink Arsenal   manager admitted that  Chelsea 's spending had unbalanced the premiership.
