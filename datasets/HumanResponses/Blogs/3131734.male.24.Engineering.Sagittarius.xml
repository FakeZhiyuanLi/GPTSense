      Today, I flunked my stupid test, all that i studied was never tested!! All the revision question that the lecturer gave was not tested! WAT THE HELL~~!!! * BURN HIS HOUSE *. However things got better after talking to Gin on Msn, so nice to catch her tonight online tonight. But somehow, it feels that my life is lacking of something. I feel so left out, so lonely. Things are just not going well...is it love that is missing? or is it friends that i am lacking? i really dun know...My knee is not getting an better too...but looking on the bright side...I got hockey again on THURSDAY~~!! WEEE~~!!!....damn i am a hockey addict...Wonder how is my PCHK doing in aus...hope everything is fine with her....And good luck for your Test GIn~~!!! * wink * time to hit back to my books again...before i fall asleep again.

      Happy happy~~!! Today is a happy day for me~~!! hehehe went to meet Changwen and Yingyi for lunch~~!! YingYi wore a super duper sharp and pointy shoe~~!!! Asked her why she wears that and she reply " TO POKE YOU~~!!! " now now that is a violent woman. hehehehe  Bugis Fish and Co~~!! wooohooo...the serving is a little bit too much for me heheh maybe i been eating little lately...but damn the fish and cheap is good man~~!!!! Went Shopping with Changwen then showed him the Addidas Jacket that i liked, was glad to hear him say that the jacket is nice~~!! "Sent" YingYi back to her office...or should i say office block hehehe then continue to Suntec city addidas shop only to find it closed~~!!   Damn~~!! make me walk all the way there, luckily city link mall is just near-by and they have a addidas shop.I think i am crazy over addidas stuff now...hehe time to boycott NIKE...The city link mall should have more variety man~~!! all so limited...then we proceed to FNS...ChangWen saw slippers hehehe and he was thinking " to buy or not to buy " hmmmm....he decided that i shall get it for him in aus~~!! Neh bu!!! hehehehe  Soon after my "daughter" Tingly, came hehehe same thing again~~!! WEARING THE SUPER DUPER POINTY SHOE~~!!! Asked her why...SAME ANSWER~~!! " TO POKE YOU~!! ". What is it with women and their pointy shoe?? and why the same answer to the same question??  hehehehe...walk back to bugis to get the jacket~~!!! Wee $119 well spent~~!! hehehehe Tingly was hungry but she doesn;t wanna eat too much cause we are meeting my schoolmates for Steamboat BBQ Dinner @ Marina South~~~!!! hahaha. So we went looking for a cafe which was in the directory of the building but somehow we just cannot find it~~!!! and Coffee Bean is close for renovation~~~!!! Ended up in Swensen's....hehehe sinful place~!!! Samsaprilla~~!!! That is the name for what we know as Rootbeer, but some how it taste different. Taste like Sarsi and Rootbeer mixed...weird but nice taste. Shared the Banana boat and Tingly has Caesar's Salad that one with big and HUGE onions which she totally dislike...lalalalala she call here never tell the waitress not to put hahaha...Then we went walking and shopping for earrings when she discover she dropped her earring. I cannot imagaine she is that blur man~~!! if i never borrow a stud to pierce thru my earhole which closed, i think she will be happily window shopping. Both a pair of Square earrings hehe which cost only $4...cheap i would say.  Going Window shopping with a girl can be a fun thing, you will see her automatically drift towards a shop which has something that caught her eye. That is what happen to Tingly, we were walking straight then suddenly...she drifted to a pair of slippers~~!! i think the shop is call Xodus or something like that, then she make a impulsive purchased....which she later complain that she shouldn;t have done that...well...Too late my dearest daughter, you already BOUGHT IT. But i would say that it is money well spent cause it is a nice pair of slippers.  Dinner was not bad, had fun catching up with my coursemates and they gave me a Jig Saw Puzzle of a photo that we took together~~~!! how Sweet heheheheh....After dinner all of us went to the "Beach" for a leisurely stroll which i had to leave cause i am meeting my friend Brandon for a game of snooker. When we reach the Mrt Station which i will refused to say which one....Tingly says she has to go, then we proceed to the toilet. " Toilet Closed For Washing ". HAHAHAHHAAH there was the sign outside the toilet~~!!! Well in a moment of desperation, Tingly went to the G** Toilet and releived herself but only to find that after she went in a group of guys game in. Ahahaha luckiy i was watching out for her and she only came out when the guys left, howeverthe group of guys were standing outside waiting for frens hahaha...The expressions on their face was lalalalalla...ehehehe...well at least for the whole day there was this super exciting 10.mins adventure.  Ok time to sleep now it is 3:51 am now, and i got to meet Mr LinKim Chong to expend the vouchers~~!!!   Countdown Days to depart for Aus: 5 days left  Present mood: Delighted~~!!

        Missing Someone~~!!       I could stay awake just to hear you breathing Watch you smile while you are sleeping While you're far away and dreaming  I could spend my life in this sweet surrender I could stay lost in this moment forever Well, every moment spent with you Is a moment I treasure  I don't wanna close my eyes I don't wanna fall asleep 'Cause I'd miss you, baby And I don't wanna miss a thing 'Cause even when I dream of you The sweetest dream would never do I'd still miss you, baby And I don't wanna miss a thing  Lying close to you Feeling your heart beating And I'm wondering what you're dreaming Wondering if it's me you're seeing Then I kiss your eyes and thank God we're together And I just wanna stay with you In this moment forever, forever and ever  I don't wanna close my eyes I don't wanna fall asleep 'Cause I'd miss you, baby And I don't wanna miss a thing 'Cause even when I dream of you The sweetest dream would never do I'd still miss you, baby And I don't wanna miss a thing
