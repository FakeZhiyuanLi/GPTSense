      ...Because Jimmy and I had our first marital fight this morning.  It's about our financial situation.  I don't make enough money to help pay the rent and stuff so he basically threw it in my face.  Needless to say, I ended up crying and telling him if he didn't like it, then he knew where the door was.  So he threatened to watch what I say.  This made me even more upset.  So that's how he left for work; pissed off at me.  I'm not really happy today.  I also have a injured foot.  I think its an ingrown toe-nail and it hurts like a mother!  I went to call into work today bc I can't stand for long periods of time and I waas told I had no choice but to come in.  My shift got changed from 12-6 to 3-6.  So I made a doctor's appointment to get my foot check out at 11:20.  I just recieved a phone call from the assist. manager saying I  had  to come in at 12 - that the cover from 12-3 had to work at her other store.  I told her I couldn't come in bc I had a doctor's appointment and she sighed and was like, "fine, 3 then."  And then hung up on me!!  I swear, I want to quit so bad.  I have someone working on getting me a job at her office so I hope that goes through.  I need to get out of Dunkies.  They treat people like shit.  But anyways...I promised I'd upload some pictures.  So I kept true to my word.  These are what I have right now.  I'm getting more soon...hopefully in the next week or so.  But, enjoy and feel free to comment on them.  I uploaded the pics to my picture site.  To view them, click  urlLink here  to see them.

       ...and I'm an official married woman   It feels weird.  Being married and all.  You think being with someone for 3 years it would feel natural.  But it doesn't.  It feels like everything that we've been through is new again.  It's not bad though.  I'm really happy.  But our honeymoon could've been better...  Our wedding day was just as any young girl would picture it, no clouds in the sky, clear blue skys, nice and hot (well...nice and warm).  The perfect wedding day.  We have some nice pictures which I'm gonna have to upload somewhere.  Our honeymoon was on a cruise to Bermuda.  There wasn't much for us on the way to and from for us, but we managed by sticking ourselves in our stateroom the whole time, lol.  We did go to the casino a few times - spent a $150.  Bermuda was beautiful.  Hot and wonderful.  Clear waters, nice people.  I'll write more later.  I have many errands to run to get re-settled into my home.

       ...1 more day until my wedding   I don't know what to think right now.  I never knew how much work really goes into a wedding until I did mine.  We got engaged a month and a half ago and pulled everything together for tomorrow.  It still amazes me how well we did.  But, we did freak out this morning about the cake.  We never heard from her, so we thought she forgot about us.  I called her this morning and everything's on track and I'm going over there at 2 to make my payment on it.  There is still so much more to do, it feels, but everything is right about done.  I just have to stop over my mother's to get the DJ's # so I can call them and see what's up.  They need some songs from me.  Overall, I think I better log off because I have to run to the bank, go all the way to Brockton to pick up my Maid of Honor (she doesn't drive), go back home to meet my cousin, go out to lunch with my family, go pay for the cake, go to the spa to get pampered with Christina (the MOH), and then go to my mom's house to get some sleep.  Somewhere in there I'm going to get my check from work because my car insurance is due on Monday and I need the check to clear.  ::wipes head::  So yeah.  I'm logging off now.  See you in about a week.

       2 days before I'm married!   Am I scared yet?  Hell yeah.  Do I care, no!  I'm going to make this nice and short.  Today I worked 7 am till 3 and everyone was in a horrible mood.  I got nagged so many times that I wanted to walk out so bad.  I had to bite my tounge from swearing at my manager because she mad fun of me!  Yes, that's how mature my co-workers/boss are.  But anyways, other than that, I went tanning, went food shopping, AND had my final appointment with our wedding coordinator.  I'm such the busy girl :P  Anyways...we're cooking hot dogs and beans so I'm gonna go.  I'll blog more later.

      Hopefully I will use blogger.  I use to swear by it.  My domain doesn't interest me anymore.  Plus, I'm about to start a new life on Saturday.  And to honor it, I want to be somewhere to blog about my life - other than a domain or a journal.  No one will visit most likely, or comment for that matter, but feel free to if you read something you feel you  have  to reply to.  I don't mind.  You'll probably make me feel special anyways.  I'm gonna need to get a layout up for this thing - possibly.  I'll check around and see what I can do.  I'll be back.

      Here it is...chapter 1.  Remember to comment with feedback when you're done.  Thank you.   &&&    Chapter 1   My body jumped as the familiar buzzing in my purse made me grab my cell phone subconsciously.  I held the phone in front of my face and my fingers began to push random buttons.  I had a text message.  I opened the text messaging folder and gasped at what the snippet line read.  I couldn’t be.  I opened the message and finished reading the short sentence present on the screen.   I want to see you again . How could I let this happen?  How could I have even considered what I was doing?  It wasn’t like I was single either.  I was a happily married woman.  I loved my husband more than anyone could ever know.  To any normal person, what I was doing was officially wrong, a sin even.  Under the eyes of God I was in a binded relationship that couldn’t be broken without serious paperwork involved.  Yet I had another man text massaging me, calling my cell phone when he found free time, even emailing me. I know it sounds strange to anyone that doesn’t know the whole story.  If I’m  so  in love with my husband then where did I find the time to meet someone else?  And why did I even attempt to?  But it’s not like that, I swear.  I met him at a Hanson concert a few months ago.  And since then, my life has totally changed.   ------    “Honey, my mother bought me tickets to see Hanson,” I said excitedly.  “The tickets should be here in a few weeks.” “Good for you,” he said with the roll of his eyes. 	Kyle knew how much I loved Hanson.  I made it very clear to him that he was not to try to change my love for the guys.  And I wouldn’t change his love for sports. “At least now this balances out with you going to New York in October,” I said.  “Now I have something special to look forward to.” 	I had been a fan of Hanson since the “MMMBop days.”  My favorite Hanson was like every other girl on the planet; Taylor.  But when young Zac went through puberty, grew taller, and grew more manly, my feelings changed.  For awhile, before my desire for Zac, I thought Isaac was pretty hot; but he just never stuck to me the way the other two did. Alas, it had been my dream to meet the guys and tell them how much their lives as celebrities had helped me surpass so many obstacles over the years.  Two months before I went to my first concert in June of 1998, my grandfather passed away to cancer.  At the concert they sang “With You in Your Dreams” in which I had a difficult time getting through.  I felt the boys love for their fans that night.  It made me respect them even more than I already did.  That night made me believe they truly meant it when they said they cherished their fans. The one thing I always wanted to do was to meet them; to try to convey my gratitude to them being one of the biggest supports in my life.  I sometimes wonder if that is why I’m still a fan today; if I’m trying to hold onto the past.  But I don’t believe it because I know my love for them is as real as their love for me is. “When is the concert?” Kyle asks, glancing away from the baseball game that blares from our TV. “It’s the day before your birthday.  The twentieth,” I said.  He says nothing and turns back to his game. 	I roll my eyes and wonder how I can love this man so much.  I met Kyle three years ago in January of 2001.  His younger sister had offered to hook us up and I agreed; just to see what he was like.  Two days later we became an official couple.  He is Italian, and you can definitely tell it when you visit his grandparents’ house.  I knew the night I met him that he would become my husband someday.  It was something my mother had always told me, “You’ll just know,” she would say.  I never understood until Kyle stepped into my life. 	He was different, and he was definitely not a child.  He had morals, values, and wanted to be taken seriously; yet he wanted to have fun while doing it.  And he isn’t bad looking either.  Standing 6’2” with brown hair buzzed neatly to his head and eyes blue of that of an ocean in New England, he’s something to look at.  I’m surprised when he choose me as his companion.  Compared to my short 4’11” frame, people must think we make an odd couple.  But we love each other, and I guess that’s all that matters. 	Ever since our relationship started, I knew it wasn’t going to be like my past relationships.  Kyle moved in with my mother and me only three months into our relationship.  Three years later, this past March, I decided I didn’t want to live with my mother anymore.  Kyle had been itching to move, but I knew I couldn’t afford it.  But something inside me snapped, and I wanted to make it work.  I wanted to know what it was like to be on my own.  For Christ sakes, I turned twenty-three a month prior. 	Kyle and I applied to an apartment complex down the street from my mother’s condo.  We got approved for the apartment three days later.  Because of the move, my health insurance would be canceled since I wouldn’t be living at home anymore.  At the end of March Kyle and I mutually decided to get married so I could fall on his insurance.  We had two dates in mind.  May 8th or May 15th.  I was leaning more towards May 8th because it would’ve been two years and one month after Taylor Hanson and his wife Natalie’s wedding date.  But that date wasn’t happening; it was Mother’s Day weekend.  After a week of debating, May 15, 2004 was the date etched in stone that was to be when I would become a wife. 	Though there wasn’t a proper proposal, I didn’t really care.  All that mattered was Kyle and me.  On the weekend of April 2nd, I traveled to Maine with my father to visit my family there and to start picking out wedding gowns.  When I returned home my father handed us $60 to go out to dinner and left us bewildered.  So we went to dinner at a nice little Italian place up the street, came home and changed into our scrubs, and began watching baseball.  During a commercial, Kyle stood from his lazy sitting position on the arm chair and started a little speech. “As you know, we’re getting married,” he started off.  “And as you know, there is something that hasn’t been done yet.  I have something I want to give to you that belongs to your family.  They wanted you to have it.” 	He continued with saying that it was an heirloom passed down to my father’s older sister.  After he finished talking, he grabbed my hand and stood me in front of him.  Taking a deep breath, he said “I already know the answer, but it’s nice to hear it anyway.”  I could tell he was shaking as he got down on one knee and looked into my eyes as he asked, “Will you marry me?” in a childish tone, the “Kyle tone” as the game came back on in the background. 	Now I was shocked.  I had wanted for two years to have those words uttered from his lips.  I never thought this moment would happen.  And it couldn’t have been more perfect.  It was how I dreamed of it with Kyle; some sort of sport happening in the background.  It was just the way it was meant to be, and it was nothing sort of what I expected. “Yes,” I said as he prepared the ring for me.  I removed the rings I had already on my finger; an opal he gave to me our first Christmas together, and a tiny heart shaped ring with an amethyst (my birthstone) in the center.  I set them aside as he took the tiny diamond from its case and took my left hand in his hand.  The ring fit perfectly.  That night I called everyone in my family.  It was then that our unity was official.  It was really going to happen.   -------    	I re-read the message on my screen.  I wanted to see him too.  I didn’t even know he was in town.  But something was holding me back to reply to him.  I couldn’t do it to my husband.  But I wanted to. 	It had been a few months since I last saw him, at that concert in July.  It was now October, and the air around me grew chilly as I thought of what to write back.  Finally I settled on  I want to see you too .  I closed my eyes and bit my lip as my finger hit ‘send.’ 	 What are you doing?   I silently scolded myself.  Then a thought hit me suddenly.  Did I really love my husband or had he always been a sort of backup plan?
