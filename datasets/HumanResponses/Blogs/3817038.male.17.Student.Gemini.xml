      Oh man that was some good water.  ok, now that i have THAT behind me i'll summarize the continuance of my day.  Well, the girlsies wanted to go to lunch... i wanted to say goodbye to my people online, but these girls, being very nosy, clambored around the computer to see the messages i was sending. i had to take off without saying anything, which might have bummed a few people out.  i took the girls to Macaroni Grill and i had a pepperoni calzonetta which wasn't too spectacular.  then we played hangman on their paper mats there.  it was movie-themed - i would have totally dominated with "How Stella Got Her Groove Back" but we ran out of time.  oh well... i dropped them off at the mall and headed home.  when i got there i realized it was 3:05 and i was late to piano.  I had totally missed it the day before so i didn't want to get in trouble again.  i called the teacher told her i was running late cause of those girls and hightailed it over to the lessson... on the say i called Serra and apologized for ditching her online again (those dman girls!) i just hope she got the message....   ... yeah, so now i'm sitting here waiting for the girls to call and have me pick them up.   Peace out for now :)

      Good morning :)  last night i took those girls to see Scarry Potter.... Again.... for my THIRD time... i would rather have seen spiderman again but i guess i can do that this weekend.   Then they woke me up this morning at 9:00 cause they wanted to go to Bruegger's Bagels for some breakfast... *sigh* i need a good sleep ;)  Mike called me this morning which is cool cause i haven't talked to him in a long time.... we'll probably get some friends together and find something fun to do.  he's really good at finding fun stuff to do... it'll be good to see all my old school friends again, no matter how weird alot of them are.  Last night, when i was talking to Serra, she asked me a question which, naturally, didnt' go through on crappy MSN :P.  Then when i asked her to reask the question... she refused.  What's the dealioyo?  No worries though, i'm stubborn... i'll find out eventually.  Besides, it's nothing a little *kiss* couldnt' remedy.... guess i got a taste of my own medicine.  ok, i'm off to take these girls to lunch now, i'll have another post later.

      well, this is my first post.  whoopy :D  I haven't really done this before...  i'll start with a summary.  This week has been pretty interesting so far... first thing, i had to serve as an escort for my older sister's Debutante ball ceremony.  The majority of it wasn't that bad... got to wear a cool dinner jacket tux and met some cool people... but during the middle of our outdoor ceremony it started raining and hailing full force all over us - my sister and i (dressed in very nice clothing which doesn't react well to rain ;) ) had to hightail it into the opera house to finish it all up and afterwards had to sit through three hours of painful french opera.  OMG it was painful.  the whole event lasted from 11:00 in the morning till 1:30 in the morning on Sunday. I was happy to see my grandma leave on Sunday (she is SOOOOOOOOO annoying!) and even happier to see my little sister come home from camp that night too.  She has alot of moviegoing to catch up on ;) .   Monday, we celebrated my mommy's birthday.  big 44 :D.  That same day my older sister left to visit a friend in Bermuda.  Yay, i now have the car all to myself :D.  so i took it off to get some cleaning and stuff.  pretty boring. Tuesday, my little sister's friends were coming into town to hang out for the week... a bunch of friends from boarding school.  Since they're all under 16 and don't have their lisense, i have to be their chauffer everywhere.  Whoopeedoo.  One of the friends i used to hate (we're better now), anotehr had a huge crush on me during half the school year, and the other i dont really know.  Hopefully it won't be too disasterous. Yesterday i took them around doing random stuff... the mall, the movies, etc.  I took some time of my own for my piano lesson (once a day for an hour) and to pick up my sister's car (surprise for her graduation).... then they surprised me by saying they had gotten tickets to see Spiderman.  We saw it last night, it was sooooooooo goood, i'll have to see it again asap.  I was really bummed though cause by the time i got back on Serra was going to bed... that reallly sucked.  Today is pretty boring thus far.  Woke up at 11:00 (yay for me) then just came online.  I was trying to have a nice conversation with Serra when all the girls came in, begged me to take them to the pool, then started asking me all these questions about Serra.  Well, i wasn't in the mood to describe to them how i have all these internet friends - i think that kind of news might be traumatizing to them. oh well, i took off and promised to call her later.  After i had dropped off the kids at the pool, i gave her a call.  I'm not good on the phone at all, especially when i'm talking to someone who i've only "talked" with one time before and i know so well from the internet.  When that kinda thing happens i get really nervous and start throwing on this fake attitude and voice.  i hate it when that happens cause it leaves a bad impression on me... i embarrassingly hung up on her a little sooner than i hoped.  now i'm sitting here talking online and making this blog...   ok well that was much longer and more boring than i was aiming for, but now we have somewhere to start from ;).   more stuffs later tonight.
