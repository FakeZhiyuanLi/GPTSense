      My dad is in town visiting. I love it when my dad comes. While I was catching up on sleeptime on Saturday morning, my dad was up rummaging around the kitchen. I could hear him cooking. Before heading out for a wedding that morning, he reminded me to lock the door and I reluntantly stumbled out of bed. As I walked back through the kitchen, I saw a big pot on the stove and a three-part instruction note on the counter:  1. Macaroni in the fridge. 2. Chicken soup in the pot. 3. Reheat the soup in the small pot and put the macaroni, add little salt.  HAVE A GOOD (with happy faces inside the "o"s) DAY! - Dad  Isn't my dad the cutest? Yeah, I'm spoiled. But hey, after not living at home for six years, it's nice to have someone cook. I had absolutely nothing in the fridge, I mean zilch, when my dad arrived. But the house  was  clean. Now, I have a clean house and hmmmm, macaroni chicken soup!!!

       I have been skeptical about starting a blog all summer. I never knew about blogs until a friend sent me his a few months ago to read. I loved it. Then I discovered other friends kept homepages, wedding sites, online postings - seems all so open and personal to me. Very strange that anyone can just look you up and read all about your life and inner thoughts without you knowing.  I would never have one,  I remembered thinking. But as I continued to keep track of my friends through their blogs, I began to entertain the thought of writing one of my own.       The truth is, having an "online journal" is frightening but that's not what's stopping me. The exercise of even putting words down on a page is painful. I use to write tons. I have a drawer full of journals and dairies: records of events, trips, day-to-day thoughts, quotes, verses, prayers...it was endless. When my hand could not write fast enough to keep up with my head, I started typing things out on computer and saving them on disc. Since my grandmother passed away 2 years ago, I haven't been able to write a single word down on paper or on computer. I want to. I tried. But everytime I start, it's as if my heart freezes and ceases to search, I stop thinking, and nothing comes out in writing. I'm completely dry. Or am I just scared?      When all the teachers returned back to school two days ago, it was announced that our theme for this year for our R &amp; D (research and development) time would be:  write it down and make it clear . Habakkuk 2:2 says, " The the Lord replied: Write down the revelation and make it plain on tablets so that a herald may run with it".  Inspired by this verse, our goal for this year is to make things clear. Our school has a clear vision but we need to know exactly how we are accomplishing our mission statement, how we are transforming education and bringing best practices into our classrooms, and how we are measuring profound learning in our students. Our devotional time this year is focusing on postmodern Christianity. Cool. This is going to be a great year. I can tell already, it's going to be different.      The second day back, I took another leap of faith. At the beginning of last year, our staff went through a gruelling 3-day intense design workshop with a phenomenal man, Matt Taylor. Check out his website at  urlLink www.mgtaylor.com  and  urlLink www.matttaylor.com . Matt, an artchitect, and his wife, an educator, started a patented process that helps organizations develop and plan solutions for complex problems at an accelerated rate. Normally, a year's worth of planning and solution development in a company would take place in 3 days with them. Of course, that's what we did. Out of those 3 days, our staff formed into 'action teams' to work together the rest of the year on specific areas we felt needed redefining, exploration,  clarity . I chose the numeracy group. It was a great year, our math group had a lot of laughs and good dialogue (we did some work too!) I was comfortable there but I felt that this year, I needed to be some place else. So I broke up with my math team and branched off to the Master Learner group. It was a tough decision, I didn't know any of the teachers I was about to work with and I was uncertain. But I felt God calling me to go so I did.      Little did I know how much being part of this team would speak to my heart. Our school's vision is to produce  Profound Learning . Our mission statement is to  develop Master Learners . The master learner is characterized by seven habits: person of character, love of learning, independent worker, critical and creative thinker, quality producer, principle centered leader, and collaborative worker. These habits are introduced and taught from the beginning (my job - K!) and developed until graduation in grade 12. During the first hour of the meeting, teachers were discussing graduate profiles and planning a start-off for the year, to have students begin writing their own personal vision and mission statement. I was overwhelmed by the discussion, trying to play catch-up from a year's-worth of work from the team and trying to understand as a relatively new teacher how to fully bring the seven habits to my Kindergartners.      As the meeting progressed, my head was spinning. Wait a minute,  what's the difference between a vision and mission statement?  I asked the teachers, do you all have a personal vision and mission statement? I doubted they did and they're talking about our students developing one - ha! To my surprise, they all just looked at me and said,  y-eah.  Oh, I'm in over my head. I don't have a personal vision or mission statement!   The only time I had written a mission statement was five years ago on a summer project, I was 18. It was also the only time in my life where I felt strongly supported and believed in, I had a spiritual mentor, and experienced living in authentic community with 40 other believers. I was a dreamer. Without them, that mission statement became just words on a piece of paper, tucked away and forgotten. I didn't live it out anymore. What happened? I had so many questions and I spoke honestly and from my heart how I felt at the meeting.      These were prayers and earnest cries from my summer,  God, I want more. Show me your destiny for my life . No, destiny is not even the right word. It implies the inevitable, fate, something that is uncontrollable. My dad wrote me in a card once: A person without dreams is like a bird without wings.  God, plant your dreams in my heart and let me write it down and make it clear! So I can live my life fully the way you've created me to be, to glorify and love you more each day.   Lord, I want MORE .  More  of what you have in store for us,  more  than what I am experiencing right now,  more  of you. I am going to do whatever it takes this year to earnestly seek after the Lord, to look deep into His heart and His Word so I may know Him and find myself firmly planted in His will, in His plan, in His dream for me. And what greater blessing it is to have this prayer and go to work and have my co-workers help me become the best teacher I can be in my classroom but also to help me find my dream so I can be the best person I can be for God. So our team agreed, with the help of each other, to come together on Sept.14 to share our own personal vision and mission statement. And this is the beginning of my journey.       Write it down and make it clear , this blog is in part an act of obedience to this call. It will not always be this long (I did mention I can write tons!) but it will also be a collection of favourite quotes, little thoughts from the day, and probably stories from my classroom to be remembered. It is also a cry from my heart to be connected, to live in honest truth, and to be in authentic community as I seek God's calling for my life. I know it's not so much what I do in life that counts but  how I live my life . The journey is more important than the destination. The process more important than the product. I believe that.      Someone recently wrote, there's something to be said about being at the place where your dream is realized and doing exactly what you have hoped and longed for. As our staff was contemplating how we could change education and teach differently if we did not have to follow the "constraints" of traditional methodology i.e. teaching in grades, a teacher suggested, "If tomorrow we did not have to follow Alberta Learning and curriculum, would we be ready to do things differently? How would we change education?" The truth is, no, we are not ready. But we will be someday and it will happen. Our vision will be actualized. The high school music teacher was telling me about his recent experiences coaching Kalan Porter, one of the five finalist in this year's  Canadian Idol  competition. While there has been much excitement of his success on the competition, he adds at the end, "But we don't want him to win. It's not the right time, he's not ready". A dream that comes true happens at the right time, and it's the journey of getting there that makes it all the worth while.       "We were meant to live for so much more , h    ave we lost ourselves?     Somewhere we live inside.     We want more than this worldâ€™s got to offer ."      -  Switchfoot
