      I propose that we make recommendations on some reorganizations and minor changes to the site. Visually, it does a good job, but I think that the information in it could be presented in a clearer and more intuitive way.

      I would like to start out by agreeing with Shawn and Lindsey that the graphics and aesthetic layout of the site are nice. I think they've chosen very compelling photos, and I do think that the simplicity of the site's appearance meshes well with the O'Neill's minimalist theater philosophy. But I do have some complaints about the site.  Since we've been discussing images....shouldn't all websites have roll-over text/Alt tags that pop up text descriptions of images for viewers with text browsers? (Not that there can be too many of those users, but aren't the Alt tags standard?)  Also, it REALLY bothers me that the round buttons at the top of each page are not displayed heirarchically at all. To me, it is very confusing.   For example, on the Home Page, the buttons for subpages are listed across the top. "O'Neill Programs, National Theater Institute, Director's Bio, Notable Alumni, Alumni Mailing List, & Photo Archive."  If I click on O'Neill Programs, I am taken to that subpage. OK so far. But on the subpage, there is a row of buttons across the top that is identical to the row of buttons across the home page. But the first button now is the heading of the subpage I'm on (O'Neill Programs). The rest are now subpages of this subpage. They are all listed equally across the top.  The way this looks is that the buttons on the top of the Programs Page must be the same buttons that were on the top of the Home Page. Not true. They are a whole new set of options. And the first one is not really an option, b/c that's where you are now.  I really think that websites ought to have consistent options, a way to see breadcrumbs of where you've been.  I also have some other questions related to information architecture, but I guess this is becoming a very long post. Mainly, I would like to see the typos corrected, and I would like to know why information is organized like it is. (i.e. Why is the page on Monte Cristo cottage listed with the O'Neill's programs? The other items listed seem to all be conferences, workshops, etc. Programs.)  I love the Photo Archive!!!!!

      After reviewing the O'Neill website, I feel that the design was well thought out, executed, and appears to serve its purposes.  The main criticisms that I can provide after this cursory glance deal mainly with aesthetics.  The photo collages that appear on many of the pages are beautiful images, however, it bothers me that some are black and white while others are color.  I say pick one and be consistent.  I do agree with Lindsey's previous post that the recurring background circle images are good,  but I see them as just a single element that seems to reveal the artistry of the actual theater and its works.  I would like to see the website strive more to convey the images (real and invoked), philosophies, and practices of this prestigious theatrical institution through design.  As we all become more familiar with the site, I'm sure there will be usability issues, but my first thoughts remain with the aesthetics after all, isn't that what we are usually left with regarding impressions?  The site is pleasant, but I'm sure it can be even better.  SDH

       At this point in time I think the thing I'm most interested in proposing would have to be looking at the information architecture (because I would really like to learn how to do that) or to think of something to add to their website. I guess I might be interested in making recommendations for a slight redesign but I don't think their current website is that far from being great. However, I'm really open to doing a lot of other things but I'm not sure what's available to do at this point. As long as I'm learning it's fine by me. I like to be creative and helpful as long as it's productive :-)

       My first impression of this website is that it started out well. It doesn't try to do too much and end up not doing a very good job. Its simplicity gets its point across and seems to have a similar metaphor as something I read on their "about us" page. It goes:   "The work of The Oâ€™Neill focuses on the script as it begins its journey to the stage. The actors work with minimal props and no sets or costumes, holding scripts in their hands, revealing for the first time the magic of a new play or musical, puppetry piece or cabaret act."   I think based on this metaphor the website could do more with this idea. Playing up the values that is most important can enhance its image and yet still be a professional looking website.     I also think the navigation on the subpages is better than on the index page. Also while the differing alignments aren't that pleasing to the eye they made great use of the images. The images are so great and add a great dimension to the site. It's more human and interactive that way because you can connect with the people performing in the pictures. I also like the artistic circles in the background that remain constant. However, the actual content on the page is so close that it feels cluttered. Perhaps it could use more "white space" in places. And lastly, I think the white boxes that they put text on seems too out of place. Maybe they could use a lighter gradient of the background color on the page to help the box blend in instead of standing out too much. I do however think that further analysis of the site could be very useful recommendations to the O'Neill Theater because they have a very good basic concept going that can be improved upon with not too much redesign in my opinion.

      This is the space that we'll be using for communication, critique and perhaps commiseration :-). Sometimes I will post questions and prompts, but also always feel free to use this space for your own purposes.
