      Dr. Schneider at SMART asked me if I had ever been told I look like A. Benning.  A few times I've heard it but I don't think so.  He says, yeah but you need to see open range...she reminds me of you in that one.

      The other night, drinking of course, Kim suddenly decides she has chicken teret's.  She starts clucking and bocking and crowing cock a doodle doo at the top of her lungs in the middle of sentences.  I haven't laughed that hard since Steve, in pitch darkness, ran straight off the side of the cliff into the river below, we didn't know there was a cliff or a river, until we heard the splash.  Anyway, the next morning, I asked Ron if he heard me come in last night.  He says no, but I heard a chicken.   Her rooster is much better than her elephant.

      I've been forked.  WHO the FORK?  Day tork r jorbs.  Orde do.    Finally I have felt what it was like to walk out in the fresh beachy morning to find....forks packed into my yard and garden.  It was time I was on the receiving end, being a former forker myself.  Clearly this forker was an amateur.  As I was commenting to my neighbor's boyfriend on the fine forking job Leigh had done for me, he says "she didn't do it".  Ironically, this morning, the first person I told was Kim, who acted completely surprised.  On the way to work, I told her I noticed one under my wiper.  The gate guy at NHCP noticed it too, as he waved me on base.    WELLLLL MISSY...the forker has been discovered and duely labeled little forker.  Surely she could not aspire to be a mother forker as she did not know enough about forking to bury the fork, thus ensuring extra difficulty in pulling them out, also ensuring lawn mower discovery.  But, if I had to be forked, I'm glad it was someone worth forking.  Don't sleep too hard kimmee.

      I am doing research on my family tree and this week I'm working on the Barnum family name.  We are descendents of P.T. Barnum of Barnum and Bailey's circus.  Also of Pocohantas, but no one believes me.  Today a patient is talking with a friend of mine.  He says "I know how to say hello in every language of every person I've ever met"...."In Kenya, hello is Jambo".  He says "My great great grandfather was from Kenya.  He sold P.T. Barnum his first elephant".  They named him Jambo/Jumbo meaning hello (Jumbo is hello in Swahili).  Hello, an appropriate name for the first elephant.

      Naval Hospital Camp Pendleton, California.  Marietta tells me the new corpsman (a cutie) is from Phoenix and I should talk to him about my move out there.  With further digging, I find that he is a P.A. and is working something out with the military so he can move into Officer status.    So I stop him one afternoon and ask him how he likes Phoenix.  He just loves it.  Just moved into a great house and paid nothing for it.  Can't wait to get back.    I tell him I'm moving to Avondale.  He says, that's where I live.  I say, I'm going into practice with my best friend out there.  He says, he knows of a new podiatrist who just set up shop across the street from his house.  Her name is Tawnya.  My best friend.

      Another of lifes synchronicities.  I'm pondering, How many people eat popcorn for breakfast?  So, I'm working this morning at the Korean office.  Here I am, a round eye, needing a translator...for all of my patients.  The culture is totally different and very suspicious of round eyes...especially doctor round eyes.  So anyway, the girls are great...still some barriers with language, but they are fluent.  They give me all sorts of korean food while I'm working.  In the past it has been some strange looking melon type fruit.  Tea that smells like toasted bread.  Today a patient brought in a strange rice cake with long bean type items in it.  Of course, I TRY everything and it was excellent.  But I will never know the name of any of these items b/c the girls cannot translate it.    So, later in the morning, I'm smelling something familiar.  Popcorn.  Popcorn for breakfast.  Well how strange...but wow...it's smelling very good.  I love popcorn, why hadn't I thought of popcorn for breakfast.  It was awesome.  On the way home, I'm wondering, how many people have figured this one out.    I get home and a girlfriend drops by....she says, without prompting...  "I had the most wonderful popcorn for breakfast".    What ARE the odds?

      Traffic was, as usual, terrible, on my 4 hour commute to and from L.A. today to work in Dr. Rhee's office.  It has been raining, and Californians do not know that the coefficient of friction is LESS when taking bends at 90mph.  Many accidents....so I cruise through Camp Pendleton as I still have two weeks left here.  Getting sentimental.  Camp Pendleton is this wonderful mass of land, almost untouched, well...the least touched of any property out here by the beach.  There are wild buffalo, foxes, mountain lions, deer, airborne things and slithery things.  And it had just rained.  I opened my window and inhaled the wet greenery and "hay"(most of the grass is brown in the winter time) and it brought me back to walks in the woods.  It is amazing what a fresh note water can bring to the landscape.  I breathed in as deeply as I could.  So peaceful.  A perfect drive.
