						       Went to T.O last night and met up with an  urlLink old friend  for grub and beer. I guess we lost touch for about 4 years maybe talking twice briefly in that time. We're gonna have to make an effort to hook up more often because although we went two completely separate ways, we still had the good friend vibe. It was so good to see him and,laugh, catch up , talk about music , check out girls on bloor and such. I was actually disappointed when I had to call it a night. More beer would have been perfect. I also saw my cuzins while I was down and that's always the best. I gave my cuz Aaron *the famous artist* some much overdue music and we went to my other cuz  urlLink Amy's  pad for a drink. So overall I had a awesome night and a return to the city next week or sooner is a must. Endnote: The Greenroom service is frustrating and confusing. Wicked Pad Thai though.  Peace

						      ONLY YOU CAN PREVENT....          They just added a 24 hr course on forest fires for my 2005 class....very pumped for this part. I believe you actually participate in a controlled burn. I keep getting more excited as the weeks and days pass. Hopefully my friends will come out and visit to see what I'm doing. This will be the best 3 months of my life.

						   My cuz Aaron is the shit. He's a famous artist from Toronto. I think He has a display in the Louvre. I can't find my favorite piece of his but here are some excellent examples of his work.                       If you don't like it I'll tell him and he'll cry.

						      Went to  urlLink fildogs  cottage this weekend. Had a great time, great food and tones o booze. We all had to share a cabin.....the smell in the morning was atrocious. We went to the dump to see if there was any bears eating garbage and sure enough, one was having a feast on some chicken bones and used condoms. We were watching him chow down and he stopped and came up to us, stood on his feet and let out a huge belch. We all screamed in horror as a jimmy hat came flying out of his mouth and hit fildog right in the face. The bear proceeded to approach fil to reclaim his hard earned breakie, took him to the ground at which point aunt jamima and I decided to leave.....you O.K buddy?

						   A little about me then. I'm justin from Oak Vegas Ontario, I also reside part time at the King's Arms. I'm 5'9, brown hair hazel eyes, well built, and I'm hungry for you......Too much??? Ya. This site is mostly for me but if you stumble upon it or are given the address feel free to comment because I need the attention. A  urlLink friend  turned me on to this blog stuff and I'm having fun with it for now so until I get tired of this, enjoy.       I'm looking forward to February cuz I'm going to  urlLink Alberta fire training college  and after I graduate, fildog and I are going on a ski trip to Banff. I hope I don't kill him because we're gonna do some crazy shit. I'm going thru ski withdrawal. I 'm watching warren miller DVD's in the summer, waxing and tuning my skis. Snow is my new blow. Check out my linx section and go to Cory's page. He's my tattoo artist and if your in the market, I strongly suggest a visit to his shop. He's the man!!! Must bounce and get back to work....more crap to come.    Peace
