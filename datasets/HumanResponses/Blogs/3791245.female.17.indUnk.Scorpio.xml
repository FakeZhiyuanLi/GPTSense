Bad. i cant not lift my leg up on its own just like straigh up in the air it hurts to much :(  i say take it off lol break it start off new lol no that would suck evern more tho! bah! but i get to go to the dr soon sometime next week because we dont have any insurence at the moment and my daddy needs it or i cant go... but the trainer told me that i needed to get a bone scan and new xray so they can figure out what is going on with my knee becasue last time they told me that it was my shoes. umm no the shoes are helping me. i went to my other shoes and they are just the same.. they are stupid they are pretty much telling me that i am fine.. cant you tell! thats why i can walk so well and evrything gesh! :)  One thing that i am scard of about stpehan is that the fact that he has not dated anyone but me you know blah blah blah but i like him and i like him a lot and i dont want to lose him because he wants like different people, like you know what i mean and i dont want him to do that it makes me sad because right now i love him to much for him to do that to me i would die from a broken heart! that would be horrible to me and thats the last thing that i want to do, lose Stephan.. i know that if i was him i would kinda want to try new people but im not Stephan i am me and i dont want him to try new people that would hurt me to much but i am on the phone with him right now and he tells me that he wont want to find new people but i dont know if i can totally delieve him i trust him and everything and i dont know i want to believe him but like 99.9% believes him but i still have that little .1% and i dont like it there so he has to convince me that he is telling the truth but this is him telling me this now i dont know what will happen in the future he cant promise me anything..

      I was reading my friends journal and i got bored and i decided to make one, it might be fun for me, and people can know what i am thinking without me having to say it, kinda cool, but then kinda freaky..  My life is pretty boring at the moment... nothing exciting is happening.... not to much happens that is exciting me to. Me and Stephan went to the mall today and i got running shoes and he got is hair rowed and then we went to Scott's. Not to exciting.  My life overall as been okay lately. Not in the best mood tho. Kind of depressed a little bit. But i will get over it, i always do! And i finally opened up to Stephan the other day, like really really opened up and told him everything that was bothering me lately and just kinda broke down.. but i needed it.. i have a problem of not telling anyone anything... i guess that i am scared that people will think that i am wining or they just wont understand..  Stephan is great tho. I couldn't ask for more at the moment, i am as happy as can be. and i like that i can talk to him and not worry about what he is thinking because i already know with out him telling me.. but he sweet, i wouldn't want anything else. Who would have thought that Stephan, out friend Stephan, Quite Stephan, could be so sweet... i guess that people never really get to know him like i know him, and i am happy that i took that time to get to know him... it was worth it overall :) He is great I love him!

      I have not writen in here in a week or a little more... alot has been going on i have no time to do anything at all! i have school till 230 then track till 500-530 then home till 630 then play and then i get home at like 11 oclock and then i go to bed! and do it again! So yes i have been really stressed out!  I have been thinking alot latly and i dont know why so sudden but i have just like looked around the house and all that i can really see is chet. chet is everywhere i cant go anywhere without thinking about him and i have just been thinking alot about it and then i get sad becuase i miss my brother.. even tho we didnt get along the best i still loved him he was my brother and he was always watching out for me yelling at people secretly so that i wouldnt know that he was doing it and just yell at people that were pissing me off or hurting me be he never wanted me to know that he did that and that he cared but i knew sometimes most of the time i didnt and never did find out but i knew that he cared that much to watch after everything that i did so that me his little sis wouldnt get hurt.. :( i just hope that one day that i would be able to maybe see him again and i would never let go of him i wouldnt let him do anything for him to get hurt i would watch after him for once make sure that he never got hurt.. but i know that i will never have that chance ever..  People always try to make me feel beeter by say "oh maybe you will see him in heaven" but you know what that just makes me feel like more shit and more depressed because when you say something like that that when you die you go to heaven or hell and by that theory my brother is in heaven but my mom is in hell because she killed herself.. that is telling me that i would NEVER even in my dream, i will never see my mother again.. so if you are reading this and one day i am crying. do me and favor and dont say that you will just make it all worse.  And people that always say "i would kill myself" that just pisses me off so much i know they dont mean it but just the thought that some jackass made that to be funny? i dont know but someone is stupid because what if someone really wasnt kidding when they told you that and you just thought that they were kidding because people do that all the time and then they really do go and kill themselves because that proves that people really didnt pay that much attention to them and didnt take them seriously enough to be concerned about it.. it just plan pisses me off that someone, even jokingly, would say that. Until one day that someone you know or are related to kills themselves you will never understand how powerful it really is.. so watch what you joke with.. its not funny to everyone.

      I didn't do to much today. I went and spent a buxom of money.  But it was my money so it wasn't as fun.  But that is okay, less stuff that Dad has to pay for.  I went to Dicks and got new running shoes.  I hope that they are good because if they aren't then I am going to be mad because it will be the second pair of shoes that I bought that were not good.  They are Nike Shox.  So they should be good.  There was only one size left and it was my size too! So ha!   Tonight Me, Stephan, Ryan, and I don't know yet are going to the Drive in to see Spiderman 2 and White Chicks.  I hope that they are going to be good.  And I hope that it is not sold out by the time that we get there.  I have XC till 8:15ish and since it is Spiderman I hope that it won't be sold out before we get there! ekkk! I would be mad and I would feel bad, since we are taking other people too, for being late and missing the movie.  But I will run practice fast so that I can leave earlier.  But oh well!   I shall tell you how the movies are when I return!   Song of the day:  Christina Aguilera: Stripped Keep on Singin' My Song

      For those of you that did not know, I recently just got back from Paris.  And it was great fun and I would go back in a heartbeat.. But only for a short amount of time, not for a long time.  I was there for 8 days and we saw everything that we could possible see in 8 days and still have days to ourselves to shop.  I spent at least 300 dollars on clothes for myself and 200 on other people.  The people are nice there!  They are not mean like people say that they are.  They are really nice and most of them know English, so you don't have to slaughter your French =) The food is good too.  Exceptionally the crepes!  They were excellent!  The funny part was the illegal people there selling stuff.  They would be selling stuff everywhere, like by the Eiffel Tower and then cops would come and they would run and hide where ever they could as fast as they could... Just so that they would not get caught.  Quite amusing watching them run around really fast.  But other then Paris everything is goooood, not doing to much. Cross Country open runs have started.  They started yesterday.  Official practice doesn't start till Aug 9th but that is okay it will get me into shape.  IM a little bit soar today but I will have to get used to it and suck it up.    I want to hang out with all the "old" group again.  Just something little the.  Not hang out allll day long with each other just do something little and that's it.  So that I don't get sick of someone or anything.  Like 2 weeks ago when we played volleyball together.  That was fun.  I would like to do that more often.  So if  any of you read this then call me up and we can plan something to do.  Because I carry my cell phone with me now.  I don't leave it at home all of the time because I have a purse now and I can put it in there! Yah for me! I have a purse aren't you proud! Well I am!

      Long time no see, or talk, which ever you prefer... soo yes... i had an okay day today kinda boring really. I Slept horrible. Had to wake up at 7 and go to ACT's. Got home ate. Burned 4 of my fingers on a pan. Naped. Showered. Came to Stephans house (he stayed at my house). Helped clean and rearange his room. Cleaned upstairs in his house. Stephan excidentaly got my ATM card takin away buy putting in my password wronge. Then he called and told me, i told him to hurry up and get home. 45 minutes later he comes home, after i was painicing, while home alone at his house. But he was osrry i forgve him of course. And now i thought about my journal so i thought hey.  But I paniced when Stephan was gone because I have this weird paranoya that I have that is your not right on time that you tell me or what time that I think that you will be home, I panic and I jump to conclusions and I automaticly think that something bad has happened to them. But i geuss that that would be relivent ofter Chet.  Over all in the past like 2 months that I have not written, lol, i have been kinda depressed; but that is getting better now. Me and Stephan talk alot and I now have all that out of my system.  We finally got my Mom and brothers head stone. FINALLY! Jeez! but then Dad brings up to me the other day (i didnt tell you think Stephan, I forgot about it tell now) but Dad now want to know when I want to bury Chet. Truthfully, I dont really want to, I think that it would bring back everything like it had just happened. I dont want that right now. It scares me. But I do know that that could help me in a way kinda giving it a final to it. Not having to walk in my Dads room and then turn and look at the dresser and see him there and panic and then leave as fast as I can. I definatly dont want to start getting depressed again.. I hate that. So I dont know yet on that one.. I shall tell you what is going on at a later date.  I think that I am done now.. after i wrote my book! *as Stephan says :)* I will try to keep you updated at much as possible!

       Havent been doing to much latly. Yesterday me and Stephan hung out with Ryan and played some xbox. Then Kurt, Dan, Chris, and Jerry came over. Then we went to the park and played a little volleyball with some of Chets old old friends. THen we went to Kts house and boxed it up. That was fun. Should have recorded it but I am smart and didnt bring Kts cord. Then I came home and went to bed.       Today hopefully me and Stephan are gonna go and see The Village and then we are gonna go to Dennys.       Have you ever just thought about something for soo long it just doesnt even make sence anymore? Like, where does color come from really? I know you can get some color from plants, the dye in them, but what made those colors? If we only started with one color, where did the other colors come from? If you add a color to the same color how would you get other colors, you cant? Just random wheird things, that dont make sence at all. Or have you ever staired at someone for so long and you notice something that you would never notice before? A simple little thing. An expression that you just fall in love with, or one that you despritly hate. But just that simple little expression could make you want them more and more. Or it you hated it and it bothered you, it would just rip you apart beucase it eats at you. Just the smallest thing in the world like that, but it would do soo much. Just think about weird things like that, random stuff. Its weird, I know, but I do it all the time. It keeps you busy.       You are probly like, where did that come from? Well latly I have been thinking about with I think about most. And I have found out with what I think about most of the time it weird things are. I find myself alot of the time, when Im in the car, I stair out with window and look at everything that I can. Examine the closest that I can that fast. Every now and then I see a house that I have never really seen before. Or houses that I really dont like, because they are soo boring looking. I dont know weird things like that. I know Im weird. But I will just leave it at that and not try to make you think that I am weirder then I already am.        New screen name...BigEm184

      Wow! it has been a week since I last wrote in here. Let me try to remember.   Monday ..ummm...went to Ryans, I think. And I think that that is the day that Dan made up a sweet game with a dog lesh. And then we went and saw God Send in a 1.50 place. I thought that it was going to be a really really dirty place. But, Suprisingly, it wasnt at all it was really clean.    Tuesday ..Stephans kittie had 4 little kitties but 3 of them died. Me and Stephan went to Jerrys house and Jerry and Kurt were painting something on the garage. Me, Stephan, and Kt watched. It was fun. Then we left there and come to my house to see my room. Went to Tomi's house for a little bit. But when Me and Stephan got there (I had to take something to my daddy) Kt and Jerry left, but me and Stephan stayed at Tomi's house for a little bit. Then we went back to his house and I dont remeber anything else.   Wednesday and Thursday ..no memory at all. One of the days we probly started on digging the hole for the pool. Wednesday we only did a little bit. I didnt do anything that day. But on Thursday I worked alot.   Friday .. Stayed the night at Stephans house, woke up at like 10. Left at 10:30 to go to Warped Tour. We got there around 11:40 or something like that. Watched a bunch of bands. Saw Ryan and Jerry. Saw a bunch of people from skool. We went to the other side of the thing and got tons and tons of free stuff. Sicker wise. I even stole a sticker, not on perpose tho. Mostly every stand had free stickers. Then I saw the sticker "I'm sick and tired of white girls" so I grabbed one. Then later I went back to get one for Stephan becuase he wanted one. I grabed one and then guy was like 'hey those are 2 for a dollar!' So I guess i stole a sticker. Oh well! Then we went to Punderson to camp with Stephans family. When we got there, a couple minutes later Steve, Bonnie, and Alysha had to run Jake to the hospital ebcause him and Chad were riding bikes at night. Stephans bike, which he didnt have permission to bring! And Jake was gonna go up this hill to go to the bathroom and didnt see the ditch, hit the ditch and then face planted the ground. Broke his nose and riped his bottom gum really good, and now has 5 stitchs on his lip thing. Sweet sweet.   Saturday ..Still camping. Nothing dematic happened that day. But at night we played this fun game but it is had to explain.    Sunday .. One of the people that we went camping with, their son, was a work and he got stung by a bee and he is allergic, but we didnt have to take him to the hospital or anything his ear was just HUGE! And then we went to Stephans house and we started to work on the pool again. Stephans dad had this sweet idea it, to snow blow the dirt! It worked to. It was hellarious! It was cutting rocks to and flinging them everywhere! But it was great fun! And we got a pool that day! YAY!!!   Today ..Went to stephans house to wake him, came to my house and did nothing. So far its boring kinda. Maybe we will do something later on and it wont be boring any more...  No song.

       Saturday  .. Took Jake and Colton gulfing, kinda. We got there and it was closed for some odd reason, I dont know why, some sort of tournment I am guessing. And of course, Jake forget his money, even thought   3   people asked him if he had it before we left and he said yes! Dumbass! Then went to Kurts house around 530ish. A bunch of people were there like; Me and Stephan, Tomi and Jim, Kt and Jerry, Leah and Joel, Kurt, Dan, Ryan, Spanky, Kd, Kevin, Chris V, Colleen, Kevin, and Jeff. It was fun, I had alot of fun. But I couldnt stay the night. But the lamest thing in the world happened! Okay, we were playing frizby, and it hit the ground between me and Stephan. So we both go after it! On accident, Stephan grabbed it and flug it up really fast, but it was followed by a bucnh of rocks, and they hit Colleens car. She screams AT ME! "get the fuck away from my car". Then later she takes the frisby away, becuase the is the mature way to act. Really.. dont you think that that is extremly lame. Like wow you are really pathetic.   GOD!   But I am not gonna say much about it becuase everyone that is going to read the was most likly there! But when I got home, Chuck had gone to the bar but the rest of his freinds stayed here till about 130 in the morning keeping me awake! Ass Heads.         Sunday   .. I get waken up by Chucks friends out side of my window talking. At like 1030. They were here to wake Chuck up to go to breakfast. Even thought Chuck went to breakfast and they stayed here, and ordered a bunch of pizzas! Then I had to go get Stephan, but I coundn't do so becuase my brother had my car!!!! Then after a while we went to Stephans stepdads house. Then we went to the movies and we saw I Robot. Which was really good. I WANT A ROBOT NAMED SONNY! AND COOL FLOATY CARS! Then after that we just went to Stephan house and messed with his computer trying to get the internet to work correctly!       I was soposed to go to Tim Perko's graduation party, but I didnt and I didnt think that Stephan wouldn't want to. But he never told me where it was, I didnt know if it was at his house or not. Or what time I should come! Dumby! =) But I will give him a card and a little present! Just to be nice.        Humm.. anything else.  I dont believe so!  Lata' Catz!

                So yesterday, I     went to Stephans house and woke him up and took him to Ryans     house.  I stayed at home and i read my book and then I played a     little Xbox.  Then I went and got Stephan.  Then we went     to  find bed bath and beyond.  But we were going to see A    Cinderlla Story at 510 and so we stoped looking and we went to the     movies.  I thought that it was a good movie, I liked it.      Althought, Stephan only liked the Hillary Duff Part ;)  But it was     good.  Then we went and looked for the store again.  And we     found it! YAY! and I bought a plastic dresser thing, the little     ones,  a shoe holder, a pillow (pink one), rugs (green and red),     and a little massager! Then we went to Taco Bell and I ate this yummy     carmal apple pie thing, tasted like the ones that you could buy at the     store, but this one was warm.  Then we set stuff up at my     house.  Went to Ryans after that and played a little xbox with     Ryan, Stephan, Dan, Chas, and Spanky. Met Ryans neice, she is a     cutie.  Then we went on the computer and watched stuff and read     stuff (like Tomis journal entrie)  I only have one responce to     that and its, my name isnt Kurt, I dont invite myself places.      Then I took Stephan home and then came back and strewed with my     computer. Which is gay.  It was telling me last night that I had     an IP change and shit.  I need to take it somewhere. This computer     is cursed.  I would buy another one, but i dont have that much     money left.  And this one is fine, I just need to take it      somewhere for exta help.

      Okay humm..let me think. What have I done in the past 7 days. Humm..I know that I have changed room, painted, hung out with Ryan and Chas and Dan. But I will start from the top.  Sunday..humm I dont exactly remember what I did that day. Oh oh oh. I remember now. Me, Stephan, Jake, and Chad went to Geauga Lake. Ryan was soposed to come to but he had no money. Which made me sad because we could have had more fun. But oh well, he can come another day I guess. But we spent like the whole day in the water park. We only road 2 rides. Well me and Stephan road 2 Jake and Chad road 4. Well first, Me and Stephan noticed that the sky was kinda getting a little bit dark. Jake insisted that it wasnt going to rain that it was just getting dark outside. Wronge. Well we have to wait for them to go on one more ride.So while we are waiting it starts raining. Me and Stephan didnt really think of anything about it and we are like yeah lets take our shirts off so they are dry when we get to the car. Im like yeah that is a good idea. Take them off. and it starts down pouring. Our shirts are soaked. We get to the parking lot and it is like hardcore flooded up to our ankles. can barly lift my feet im to scard to ripe them. We get to the car soaked and I'm like arg (because we are soaked and my car is clothe) Luckly I have an air mattress in the back and Jake and Chad could sit on that and not get my car soaked. But me and Stephan are screwed we just have to sit down. And the car got soaked. But over all it was alot of fun, the water park there is definatly the best ever. Well maybe not ever, just best around here.   Monday...nothing. Then later I was talking to him about my new closet that he was soposed to make me. But instead I got a better deal. I got to trade rooms with my Dad! Wee ha! And I got to paint. I got Orange (which was a todally different then what I has on the strip, it was a real orange on the strip it is red orange on my walls), yellow, and bright green. It looks sweet all together.   Tuesday..Actually panited all of my room. All by myself but with a little help by the great and wonderful painter, Stpehan! Who thinks that he is a horrible painter but he really isnt that bad at all! But he only helped with the trim. I did the ceiling, walls, edges, and all of the second coats.  Wednesday..Ripped up the carpet in my new room and washed the floor so it is now wood. Then we went to Ryans house and Played on his computer. We played X opps and mario kart. And then we watched some Television. But before that I watched Dan and Stephan throw around a ball in Ryans room, trying to break something. Then Ryan was standing on the ball, becuase he is sweet like that. Then Stephan tried to do it and his feet slide out from under his and then slamed into a table and almost hit his head on Ryans fan! It was Great!   Thursday..I had fun yesterday. Yesterday Stephan came over early so that we could move stuff earlier and do more stuff later. But we never started to move anything til about 1ish when Ryan came over and helped Stephan do all the labor. Well I picked up a few little things here and there. hehe I was being a lazy ass. But before that, I was only playing Spiderman 2 on Xbox. Which was fun because I can actually play it and win. So therefore I like it. But I played that for a good hour or so. Which I may go play a little of later. Then after moving we had to go to Stephans house and do some labor and get some money. But the good part is that I got to meet this sweet ass old lady, Stephans hott neighbor, Toothless Ruth. But not only did dshe not have any teeth she was also not wearing a bra! This lady was SEXY! Then we went to my house and Ryan came over and we got food from Wendys and Mike was working and gave us a free sandwhich! Well no first we were going to get a movie at Giant Eagle and then as we got out of the car the guy was locking the door. So we were going to go order a pizza. Georgio's was closed to, and then we wernt to Wendys, and then Video One. We rented The Perfect Score (which reminds me that I have to take it back) and played a little xbox and then watched the movie when Chas got here. It was an okay movie. Ryan is right the Asin stoner was the best part of the movie. The only good part were with him, mostly.  Today..I woke up early to wake Stephan up to go to Ryans house. Also when I was there i did some labor. Then on the way home I almost died. LIke seriously! NO JOKE! This Ground Hog had a sweet idea of trying to run out infront of me! And of course I brake and swerve. Luckly I missed it, but after that I was like laughing so hard that I couldnt breathe. I was devistated that I almost hit the ground hog. But luckly I didnt. PHEW! And well I was panicing Stephan thought that I was going to hit a car, thats why I was freaking out. Silly boy. But about this ground hog, he was like the bravest little guy that I have ever saw. I dodged that thing and he just sat in the road. Probly devistated. And then he ran away after a little bit. But he wasnt movin at all. He was standin right there in the road! Haha what if he died of a heart attack because he almost got hit. Not because he got hit but becuase he almost got hit. And he fell over on the side of the road right there! Hah!  Random.. Me and Ryan were talking about having a really really long blog entrie. How we could talk about a bunch of nothing at all and see how long we can get it. He said he wants to get some to be 2 pages long. I will try it. But this is just a starter one. This is just one to get me started. But it already is ass long. So, Sorry. But I'm getting myself prepared.   Stuff that is bothering me.. I dont really want to talk about it in here becuase I know that people will read it but it has been bothering me soo much. About how I dont really have any friends, girl wise. I know that I have Kt, Tomi, Kd, and Leah. But if we do something together it is always with our boyfriends. I want it to be just us and I want to do something other then just sit at someones house. I have tryed to do things with Tomi but she either cant or is doing something already. Stephan hangs out with Ryan and Chas alot and while he is doing that I am at home sitting and waiting. I want to have some of my own friends that I can do that with. I dont always want to butt in with Stephan and his friends, like I always do. Kt, Tomi, Kd, and Leah do things all the time together. I am barly invited and it makes me feel like a piece of shit without any friends. I only have Stephans friends. Because I know that if I wasnt going out with Stephan then I wouldnt hang out with them half as much. But just to let you know, if this is Kt, Tomi, Kd, or Leah reading this I don't want you to invite me places now. Because I want you to invite me because you want me to be there not because I wrote this. And dont think that I wrote this to get pitty or something, it has been pissing me off since you had your Fab 4. Just becuase I dont have a best friend that is as close as you guys doesnt mean that I cant have any friends at all. But yeah don't invite me to do anything because of this, do it because you want to. Do it becuase you may atcually want to hang out with me.   No song of the day.

      Had fun. Hung out with the friends last night. Went to Jerrys house and kinda played capture the flag but after a while everyone quit, because it was impossible. The other team didn't even know where there flag was, Ken hid it and just told them that it was under a bush... Cool cool. I got bit by something and I have no idea what it was but it hurts bad, and it itches, but if I itch it it hurts REAL bad. And a walked threw a poison ivy patch. Just hope that I don't get more Poison Ivy.   Today we were supposed to go to the beach with the friends but I didn't want to because they were just going to 'hang out' at the beach. Why go all the way to the beach to hang out why cant we hang out closer. Why use gas to hang out at the beach when I don't have to use any at all. So I just said no.   They are going to Ceder Point tomorrow. I want to go but I can't. Because my Dad didn't buy me a pass to Geauga Lake to go to Ceder Point. And plus Ceder Point it to far away. It would take like 2 1/2 hours to drive there. No thank you.    Kinda had a bad day today. At first it was fine thought. Me and Stephan went back over to Ryan's house. Played computer, and best of all we played action figures, lol, not really I watched, Stephan and Ryan played. Then Me and Stephan came here and played XBox all night long. Sounds fun,.. kinda, but I did have fun. Until I was losing and then getting pissed off, because I am a poor sport. And then I come up to go on my computer and it is freaking out, over loading and shit. I JUST FIXED IT THE OTHER DAY! I JUST DELETED EVERY SINGLE THING OFF OF IT! And it is having errors already. I HATE IT!  From then on I have been in a bad mood. When I was taking Stephan home, one thing that he said to me scard me. This is what he said: "How can you go from playing xbox and being happy and laughing and then so pissed off that everything is pissing you off, in less then 20 minutes?" ....My mom was a huge manic depressant, being happy as ever, laughing with everyone and then so pissed off that she would be trying to kill herself. What if that is me in the future.. How do I know that that is not how I'm gonna turn out? How do I know that 20 years down the road that I'm not gonna be this drug addict, alcoholic, pycho path trying to kill my self, if I haven't yet? I don't know, I don't know at all. I could be the opposite. But it still scare me. How would you feel if one of the choices that you make in life could lead to that, dead on the side of a fucking river, just one tiny thing and that is how I would end up? How would you deal with that?  Its a fucking scary ass thought if you ask me.    Song of the night:  Bone Thugs n Harmony: E. 1999 Eternal Tha Crossroads

      I didn't do much today. So I don't have much to talk about. Just to  let you know this computer is a piece of shit never use it. It  doesn't go to the next line I have to push enter and when I want  something bold I have to do it myself or it will all delete. This  computer is a piece I want to throw it out the window!!  Me and Stephan went to Ryan's house last night and Chas was there. Didn't do much at first I watched them do what ever they were doing  on the computer.  Then we went to Giant Eagle and got Butterfly  Effect. I have already seen it, but it was still good. And now Steve  if burning it for me.  I wanted to go to see Incubus at Tower City Amp. On monday but no one  can or wants to go with me. Although I only did ask Tomi and Stephan.  And of course Tomi couldn't go. So I am kinda bummed about that.  But I didn't get my computer working. I gave up on waiting for my  bro and me and Stephan kinda got it, with a little help from Steve.   Song of the day:  NWA: Straight outta Compton Gangsta Gangsta

      Finally writing in here! The movies at the drive-in were good. We saw Chris, Kristi, Dusty, Mindy, and Cory Wright there. We had to jump there car =) But over all the movies were good Spiderman 2 was my favorite though. White Chicks was okay. The beginning was boring and then it started to get good.   I went camping at Geauga Lake Saturday, Sunday, and Monday.  It was fun.  I went with Stephans family.  It was me, Stephan, Jake, Alysha, Sherry, Matt, Bonnie, and Steve.  Me, Stephan, Sherry, and Matt had to sleep in a tent.  Me and Stephan had an air mattress with out a plug thing, so e got to sleep on the ground for the first night and then we went to Walmart and bought a new air mattress.  After that it was fine and I was comfortable. We went to Geauga Lake tons of times and there were no lines at all. Which was good but it was kinda cold sometimes and it rained on Sunday.  But that was okay we were in the water park =)   Some how, I don't exactly know how, but now have poison oak on my face AND poison ivy on my lip! Sweet huh!? It just made my day! But I have to suck it up and take it like a man.  I have 2 weeks or less of this shit! I get it all the time though so I am kinda used to it, sad to say.  Not really that much that you can do about it thought.  But better, if you scratch poison oak it doesn't spread, it only comes out where ever the plants oils touched.  But I don't have it on my body anymore so it wont spread, but the poison ivy may, so I have to watch that.    Went and hung out with some of my friends last night too. That was fun! Me, Stephan, Tomi, Jim, Colleen, and Chris V went out to Quaker Steak in PA.  That was good but I only have 9 wings and it was $10.  So I paid more then a dollar per-wing. But oh well! It was fun!  Then we went to Kt's house, she just got back from Michigan.  I could only stay for an hour though. Which was kinda good because I was dying without my itch stuff.  But we had fun.  We hung out at the lake and then we went to that park and watched Chris Smith and Jerry do back flips. Well watched Chris attempt to do one somewhat, and watched Jerry do a back flip.  =) Chris will get it one day though! KEEP ON TRYN'! Then I came home and watched Howard Stern =) I was bored.  But I have Fun with the friends. Wish that I could have stayed later..     My Mommy always told me that if you say the underbelly of a leaf, then it was going to rain that day... I though of that today when I was out side... and now it is raining...    Song of the day:  Dashboard Confessional: Spiderman 2 Soundtrack Vindicated

      So I woke up this morning and slammed my head on my cd player and it hurt realll good... then i forgot that i had to take Jake to golf and i was to late and Stephan had to take him...  Talked Stephans Dad and Stepmom into lettng me have a hamster :) im happy about that.. i cant wait.. im going to get them today... and me and Stephan already have names for them... hehe...Cheech and Chong :) Even if they are both girls.. that is still gonna be there names!!  Me Stephan and a bunch of other friends are going to the 'magic' lake tomarrow.. it should be fun... but I am deathly afraid of lakes... but we will have to wait and see how I will act.. and if I will go in..  Also.. this has nothing to do with anything at all... but i think that i have the most inconsiderate grandparents that i can think of... OH! wouldnt you think that if you called your grandmas house 16 times and left about 7 messages on there anwsering machine that they would call you back to let you know that they are at home and you could come over...ex-special-ly (cant spell it) if they tell your dad all the time that 'you never call them' and 'why dont you ever come over'.. but no.. they have yet to call me back.. then i thought 'hey, maybe they are on vaction and they didnt tell us' no... they arnt.. my grandpa is online right now... he is home and he is fine.. so i dont think that i want to go there if they dont have the consideration to call me back.. because it is really hard to pick up that phone and call me... assholes....sometimes i just want to punch them in the face... yeah. i know its not a nice thing to say about your grandparents. but COME ON! BE SERIOUS DUDE!   Ashlee Simpson... Shadows
