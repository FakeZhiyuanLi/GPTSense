      Yesterday, my boss calls me up about an hour before I was suppose to be at the store and tells me that my co-worker, the one who was going to take the late shift right after I got off work, decided to take an early vacation and not warn anyone about doing so.  SOOO , I had to take his shift, or else ..I don't know, something bad would happen.. I was so tired by the time was over that I couldn't feel my feet and I had this constant feeling of drifting away. Then, to top off the icing on the cake, I got my cherry by going into work at 11am after going home at 3am.. Not only did I feel weak and grumpy towards   everyone   I also had this constant chill, like if I was cold, only to feel my cheeks and be burning up. A fever perhaps? I think so, I haven't gotten one of those in a while. My body aches, and so I have no sarcastic biting remarks to make except for the ones about me being the weakest person in the world. Stupid body, stupid boss, stupid co-worker. I should take my own advice and kill myself sometime, but alas, I'm also a wimp in that I wouldn't have enough guts to do so. Admirable, no? Yes I think not.

      Today I will discuss how much I hate when people don't correct their typing mistakes. I was talking to a guy about buying a large packet of hide (SWG) and everytime he wrote something down, it had a incredibly stupid grammer or spelling mistake. I winced, literally winced everytime he would keep typing. It got to be so bad that I would start correcting him, and he finally stopped and said, "Dude, you're correcting me wrong, I'm typing the right thing." What the hell? Dude, you got to start English over again, because you don't know what you're talking about. Anyways, that was a minor deal today, I guess the bigger and better of the two was that I got master dancer on one of my characters, which for you that don't know it, is freaking awesome. :D I'm happy, I'm glad, but now I'm going to be bugged by more guys..Joy.

      One of the things that bug me the most, is when a person is in the line to order and they're on their mobile phone. Not only is she trying to deal with the person on the other line, but she's also trying to figure out what she wants to eat. That bugs me, get off the damn phone  or else I'm going to slap it out of your hand with my cash register . It takes me five minutes just to get her attention, only for her to whisper right before she steps up to my register, "Sorry, hold on the girl is being impatient." Uh...no. I'm trying to get my job done, and you're not helping at all you self rightious wench. After she giggles, and says an overly dramatic "Oh yeah, I know.." I give her the brightest smile I can manage after seething. "Hello, may I take your order?" She blinks a few times, and then I realize, she's still listening to her friend on the other line. "Wait wait, hold on, I told you the girl is being a pain." Holy crap lady, if anything, you're the one who is officially the pain in my  toosh . I smile, again, and repeat the question, only for her to go on about fifteen minutes asking me which is better..the chicken? Or the chicken. I understand so much more why people spit in their customer's food. But yes, anyways, enough about that lady. I'm sure I'll have many jerks today at work, but I'll cope. If not, I'll just turn to my old friend  Sui Cide . :D

      Some people just get on my nerves, though I don't normally say anything at the time, and the awful things I think about them just must be written down. For example, there are people that have only one goal in life, that being to be the most fashionable person in the mass of fashionable people. "What exactly is fashion?", I ask myself occassionally only to bring one answer to mind. Fashion is a quota that someone makes and that someone must fill in order to be thought of in a  'higher standard' . Meaning, the person who has to fill that quota is a  sheep . A  sheep  with no real reason but to waste space, or priceless air. If all you are going to do for the rest of your life is to shop, then I beg of you, kill yourself. Do it now, don't waste time, the discount designer clothing store in the sky is calling to you, ignore it's plea and your credit will be discontinued.

      Andre andre andre... How many times do I have to tell the boy that I don't date/have sex with (ps.I don't have sex with anyone so don't think you might be an exception)/or randomly make out with blondes?? You would think he would get the idea after the tenth time of trying to put the moves on me (online, bleah) ? I hate when people don't get it, at the most, on the second try. Not that I understand why he wants anything in the first place, lately I've been so stressed that permanent shadows live under my eyes and I don't stand as straight as I use to. Maybe it's just because I have female reproduction organs?? I have no idea, but recently he's been threatening to grab me randomly on my way home from work and rape me. Yup, the boy has a death wish. Suicidal in every way. I have this neat little bottle, you see, that has inside it a powerful substance that likes to eat at whatever it comes into contact with. Whether it be eyes, mouth, or ..hehe, my personal favorite (I haven't been able to get to this part -sniff-) the penis! :D wootah, I hope he does try it, and I hope his pants are down when he tries too. And his tighty-whiteys off...Which I'm certain he has because he's such a freak. (Btw, I like boxers :D They're sexy.) Agh, must sleep now, too much to do tommorrow.  Don't die, Bye

      Currently this is who I am:  A sixteen year old girl, with dark (real) red hair, with the height of 5'5''. I enjoy drawing, playing swg, and anime. I'm a complete computer nerd, being able to spend mass amounts of time just sitting at my desk and staring at the screen, I only get up to pee, or whatever else I need to do in the bathroom.  In this blogg, I will talk about how stupid boys are, and how it's annoying that their only goal in life is to screw as many girls as they can. Yay, but that's tommorrow, today I want to sleep. Goodnight.
