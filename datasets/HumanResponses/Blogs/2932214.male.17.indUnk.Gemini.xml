      Wow. "Passion" was incredible. You all need to see it, even if you aren't a Christian. The only problem is, it made me think. I've realized that nothing I do will ever come remotely close to what Jesu and teh Disciples did. All I really want is to be remembered. But I feel like there's nothing I  can   do to be remembered. I want to go down in history s someone who fought for his beliefs. I want to become a martyr or a saint or a war hero, bt none of those are very likely. I want to do something for God, but I don't think I can be a minister, I don't feel like "tending the flock" is for me. I feel so, so, helpless. I wish I could've been in that movie, I would give anything to be in a movie that powerful. Maybe I could write a book, or write articles for magazines about my faith, and what it means to be a modern Christian. Crap, I'm spiritually at a crossroad and nieither path is clear. Lord give me guidance. Well, that's all I got, peace. <>

      Well, this is my blog. Woo. Hopefully I'll keep this doohickey all nice and updated...  So Lent is a challenge this year; no cheese, keep kosher, and fast on Fridays. All I can say is don't fast when you work at a restauant, it's hell. I'm tired and hungry, so I'm going to bed now. I'll post one later. Peace. <>

      Some quotes:  Hate the sin and love the sinner.  --Mahatma Gandhi    I like this one, if only I could apply it (Johnson!)  Dreaming permits each and every one of us to be quietly and safely insane every night of our lives.  --William Dement     What if you're already insane?  Do not dwell in the past, do not dream of the future, concentrate the mind on the present moment.  --Buddha     It's gotten me into troouble before but for the most part that's how I live  If man hasn't discovered something that he will die for, he isn't fit to live.  --Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.     I've got lots of things I'll die for so I'm set  When people are free to do as they please, they usually imitate each other  --Eric Hoffer    Damn conformists!  He who hesitates is a damn fool. --Mae West    So true, so true  Ok, my computer slowed down so much that I can't find any more quotes. I'll get more later.<>

      Morgan wanted me to mention her in an entry so I figured I'd make this one for her. Morgan is fun... and maybe a little violent to me. But mainly fun, even when I call her Rachel. <>

      The cruise was good (can anybody say TNA?). The Airline cancelled my flight and I was a day late coming home. That sucked. The TSA (Transportation Safety Administration) sucks. They SEARCHED one my bags! I feel so violated... AND they left me a note saying they did, that's like molesting me and then showing me pictures of it. Not cool. If you want to know how the cruise was ask me. I'm waaaaay to lazy to type it all out here. Peace. <>

      So uhh this Decker thing is despressing me A LOT. Why is Johnson being to stupid about it? The only reason Johnson got Decker fired is because he's a dick. I'm still really, really angry. I don't know what I want to do next year, do I stay at Bexley? Do I follow Decker? Do I do shows out of Bexley? I'm just not sure. I've bonded with these people so much, it's really hard. Man this sucks.  On another note, Michelle is really depressed. I don't think she thinks this can continue, but I'm not sure. It's really hard to do things so long distance, especially now that theater is starting up. That and she keeps posting these journal doo-hickeys that are really creepy. It seems like she's really jealous about everything and that freaks the hell out of me. I can't handle a jealous person. It bothers me a lot. I can't stand a person that doesn't trust me, I mean, if you can't trust the person, how can you date them? ARGH!!! This week has sucked royally.  <>

      I'm so frustrated and angry right now... why the hell would they fire Decker? Do they not want a good theater program? Did some whiny parent complain about him? Or did some piddly sports booster freak out because theater is taking away from their precious little sport? God I'm angry... We students are so powerless, we can never win. Will was right, good never wins, no matter what we do we're screwed to fail. I hate this school. <>

      This update is going to include a lot of pain, anger, resentment and swearing... you've been warned.  I've lost all faith in humanity. Decker was forced to retire, two years of incredible theater and that's what he gets in return? Fuck that. He deserved way more. Well over a hundred people turned up in support of him, that made no difference. The board is only concerned with three things; money, sports and test scores. Gues what? Theater is against all of those. So what do they do? They screw us all over, it was three of the worst hours of my life. Molly, Shani, Will, Andi, Kelsi, Steven, Sudi, Danielle, Adam, and all of you that were at the meeting, I thank you. This is not over, it will never be over so long as one of us it at the school. Will and I are going to each and every board meeting and asking that Decker be rehired. I am also planning a walk-out on the first Tuesday after spring break at around 9:15, I'll hammer out the details later. I'm too pissed, hurt, and confused to do anything now. I wanted to cry with everybody else when thay announced his retirement but I couldn't. I couldn't shed one damn tear. Whats wrong with me? I wanted to, I really did. But no, I couldn't. Something won't let me. I hate that. It's driving me nuts, I'm beginning to think that I'll bever cry again. Oh well, It's the least of my worries right now. I have to make the board listen to the students for a change. Peace. <>

      So this religion thing is crazy. There is a lot of people that accept it no questions asked. They all think their religion is right in all aspects and I think that's a load o' crap. I know this guy, I'll call him Kevin (which is his name, I'm not good enough to hide it) and he thinks Christianity is the only religion and that it's a matter of accepting Christ or burning in Hell forever. I want to hit him. He's all pushy about it, he acts all high and mighty (you cant see but I'm doing that hand thing you do when you say that). He says crap about other religions that isn't true, or is only partially true. It's so... so...  irritating ! Seriously, I'm a stern beliver in questioning your faith and not trusting it blindly. He trusts it blindly. Well, I'm going to stop ranting before I hurt myself... Peace. <>

      Prom. Women love it. Most guys don't get it. I don't get it. It's just prom, I mean, who gives a crap if I go or not. I don't even like dancing that much (or crowded rooms for that matter, but that's my own damn issue). I'm willing to go if said girl is willing to wear a duct tape dress, but nobody wants to do that. Sissies. I did ask Molly Margulies, but I was shot down (ouch). Granted she did have an excuse, but it still sucked. She's the only person I know that would think going in duct tape is fun. Another problem is money, I don't have much to spend. I mean, I do  have  like $1000 in the bank but I can't really afford to spend any of it. If any of you want or know somebody that wants to go to prom Brandon style (cheaply and in duct tape) let me know. Peace. <>

      So... uhhh... I'm not sure what to say. I'm still out of it and I've been thinking (not a good thing, I know). I've been thinking, do any of you know how to tell a person (or persons in this case) how you really feel? I've tried once and so far I haven't even gotten a response... It's bugging me a lot. I mean, jeez, don't leave me hanging like this, I'm dying over here. And another thing... am I the only one who is perfectly willing and eager to fight and die for my beliefs and my friends/family? It seems like everyone I know is unlike me and isn't willing to give their all in every situation. I mean, I either pour all of my available energy into something or I don't use any of it. I'm yet to meet someone that is like me in that aspect. I have a test to see if you are... Ask yourself these questions; 1) Would you give an organ (like a kidney or a lung if possible) to a person you aren't good friends with? 2) Are you willing to die for your beliefs? 3) Do you constantly run yourself into the ground with work, school, and other crap? 4) Would you take a bullet for someone?  If you answered yes to all of these, join the club, you are like me. If you answered yes to three of these, you're pretty damn close...<>

      So my dad is still jobless... that sucks a lot. I have a job but I hate working Friday's. It's bad, I work a lot of Friday's. Hilton sucks. School sucks. Johnson is a dick with too much power. On another note... a few people have been sending me confusing and mixed signals. It's not that I want to make something of it, but it's good to keep my options open. If you like me then just say it, odds are I've been wondering if you do. Besides from my experience, it's better to have the person know you like them than to not tell them and only find out later they liked you (or still like you even though you've pretty much moved on)... well, I'm rambling mainly on recent events and you know who you are so... yeah.

      I'm rambling about love. I mean, it's just one word, in Spanish it's broken up into three very different words. But in English it has one, very intense meaning to most people. But I see love as four distinct things. Romantic, brotherly, family, and friendly. Family is simple, it's the parent-child, cousin-cousin, grandparent-grandchild sort of love. The next one is brotherly, it's the kind that motivates strangers to help one another or that keeps some friends together, for instance Jeff and me. The third one is friendly love. It's the love that keeps good friends together and, for me at least, can bring about the super intesne feelings of loyalty and I'd-do-anything-to-help-you-ness, like between me and Amanda or Chris or most of my youth group. The last is romantic love. Nuff said. Well, I'm out. Peace. <>

      Well, I feel so old. I know that's sad but I do. I mean, Iwas talking about TV shows from my childhood and most (all I think) aren't on anymore. Who remembers Hey Dude? Pete and Pete? Ren and Stimpy? Are You Afraid of the Dark? Gone. They're all gone for good and it made me feel old and nostalgic. I mean, kids these days are either watching crap or crappy versions of what we watched. Teenage Nutant Ninja Turtles is back and yeah, it sucks. Power Rangers were in space for a while and now the big floating head dude is a ninja hamster. Not as cool as it sounds, trust me, I almost cried. And then I started remenescing about old friends that I either don't know anymore or I don't see anymore. Amanda, Amanda, Matt, Erica, Vinny, Sarah, Sarah, Alana... I'm out, but still, thats a lot of people. And all my cousins that I'm closest with are in college and all grown up... what happened to the good old days? We all swore we'd never loose touch, and we aren't... it's just we never see eachother... I dunno, I just feel old. Well, I'm out. Peace. <>

      Dave Matthews Band- A Space Between  You cannot quit me so quickly Is no hope in you for me No corner y’could squeeze me But I’ve got all the time for you, love  The space between, the tears we cry Is the laughter keeps us coming back for more The space between, the wicked lies we tell And hope to keep us safe from the pain  Will I hold you again?  These fickle, fuddled words confuse me Like will it rain today?  We waste the hours with talking, talking These twisted games we’re playing  We’re strange allies With warring hearts What a wild-eyed beast you be The space between, the wicked lies we tell And hope to keep us safe from the pain  Will I hold you again?  Will I hold you...  Look at us spinning out in the madness of a rollercoaster You know you went off like the devil in a church In the middle of a crowded room All we can do, my love Is hope we don’t take this ship down  The space between, where you smile and hide Where you’ll find me if I get to go The space between, the bullets in our fire fight Is where I’ll be hiding, waiting for you The rain that falls splashed in your heart Ran like sadness down the window into your room The space between, our wicked lies Is where we hope to keep safe from pain  Take my hand ’cause we’re walking out of here Oh, right out of here Love is all we need dear The space between, what’s wrong and right Is where you’ll find me hiding, waiting for you The space between, your heart and mine Is a space we’ll fill with time The space between...

      Alright, so things suck right now in the not-being-lonely department.  So I was talking to Amanda today and I was tring to figure out when we can hang out again... August or September most likely. Fuck me in the ass. Unless wither she comes to the shows or I can catch her in between her many trips or family get-togethers it'll be a good five or six months. Well ain't that peachy. I'm not actually mad, I'm just frustrated. I dunno, I spent most of last summer getting over a crush, now it looks like I'll spend most of this one trying to do the same, although with Amanda it'll nevber actually go away, it'll just subside. Either way I'm all lonely and it blows. I'd ask someone out but I know I'll probably just screw up again and that won't be fun, so instead I'm trying for the alone thing again, all I have to do is supress the urge to ask someone out... I'm out for now. Peace. <>

      Ok, so I've noticed two things. All of my friends now are either depressed, horny or both. I'm dead serious, I'll talk to someone and they'll say either "I'm sooo horny!" or "I'm miserably depressed" and I'm like "shit, that blows." And I'd love to help with either of those problems but people won't tell me stuff, they just tell me vague things, which is good and all but still... tell me things sometimes. And then all of the people (and by thet I mean the one or two that I want to talk to and hang out with more) are depressed and loinely and I want to help but I don't know what to do. Argh! So life has been one shitty episode after anopther since early March and I don't see any end in sight. It's getting old fast. I keep telling myself "just get to summer and everything will be alright" and then I remember, all I'm doing this summer is work two jobs and go to Summer School. As far as I know I won't hang out with many people... so all I'm doing is working.  On another topic, I'm lonley. No big deal usually. Bue now I'm really freaked out about asking someone out since I know I'll fuck up agian and end up hurting somenone else and making them hate me. Not a fun thought. So now I'l alone and horny. Someone needs to help me with the horny one, just let me know. Then whenever it comes up I always feel like I'm sounding like an asshole or something, and that sucks too. Alright. I'm out before I make people sad. Peace yo. <>

      So prom was good. Morgan was fun. Marks car (Honda S200, freaking awesome!) was great. The tophat and cane idea is one of the best I've ever had. Next year in duct tape! If you want details, ask me... I'm way to lazy to type it all out now. Ok, on to other crap. If anyone that isn't a girl under 16 or a teeny bopperish girl wants a really good laugh thery should read one of those chick magazines like YM or Teen People. They're really funny! Long live togas! Now some personal messages: Michelle: Be happy Amanda:Don't worry about it, I'm always around. Just let me know. Sorry to bring up the Nate thing if it was a sensitive issue. Toga! Morgan: Prom was fun Andrew: Dos mil! You lazy ho. You lazy lazy ho. How could you almost beat me? I studied man. Psh. I'm out. Peace. <>

      Ok, I've gotta say something that's been on my mind for a while now... Alright, so I really like Amanda. Makes sense. I have for years now. She liked me the whole time I liked her until like 7 or 8 months ago, then she got over it. Shit, that was some crappy timing. Well I didn't get over her, I got worse. I really want to ask her out but I'm afraid to for two reasons. First- I've got the Michelle thing brooding in my mind still. Because of how bad I fucked up with Michelle I'd decided not to date. Well now I'm not sure. I figure I can do better this time and the odds are more in my favor; Amanda doesn't live an hour away, we have more in common (hell, we're practicaly the same person) and she doesn't worry as much as Michele does (No offense Mich). I'm really  really  afraid that I'll fuck up again and end up hurting one of my oldest friends, not a pretty thought. I think that has me most anxious. Second- She has an unbelievably huge crush on some guy named Nate (I don't know who he is so I can't really describe him) and I don't want to ask her out and have this Nate guy do that same thing a little later and leave her in a shitty situation, that sucks, I know. I dunno, maybe I'm just trying to justify me not having enough balls to ask someone out, it's probably thatmore tahn anything else. Oh well. I'll quit worrying about it soon hopefully.

      Ok, so I called in "sick" today and took a day off from school. I really needed it. I slept in 'till 10:00 or so then got up and mowed the lawn. Woo. Then I went to Grinder;s for lunch and Zak and Jimmy came over and ate luch also. Of course, they had to go back to school. Suckers! I then went to the bank and got my oil changed. I went to CVS to buy duct tape and saw Katie working there, none of you know who she is, uhh... she worked at Pizza Plus for like two months and then joined the army. She was fun. We talked for like 5 minutes and I went to the Seminary and hung out with my mom, Jamie and Adrianne. Again, none of you know who the last two people are but trust me, they're cool. After that I went to the McHouse to volunteer (yes, I volunteer at the Ronald McDonald House with my mom) and came home. I started writing a paper but got sidetract in an argument with Michelle. It sucked unbelievably, I pissed her off again, hopefully for the last time. Now I'm writing this and I don't have much else to say so I'm out. Peace. <>

      Here's a recap of my weekend so far with some random comentary on other issues interspersed throughout the post. Enjoy.  Friday- Rehearsals. Darren can't remember his freaking lines. Oh jeez eh? Made fun of Loren and her soccer-ness. Made fun of Molly for having to kiss Andy every 11 seconds. Skipped out early and gave Molly and Steven a ride home. Went home and ate Wendy's. It was good. Whats with their new buns? They're all kaiser roll-esque and that bites my ass. Hehe, Kelsey is an ass-biter. Oh jeez eh? Got a call from Jimmy. He sounded like he was breking up with me or something, strange since I'm not dating him and I'm not gay. Oh jeez eh? Walked around for a bit and walked to BUMC (Bexley United Methodist Church) to see the musical-majigger. It was pretty good. Morgan was good. Dan was funnily crappy, crazy psyco. Hehe, crazy Methys, they so freak-ay. Oh man, Cakes is awesome (not the food, the band). Went to Waffle House with Andrew, Cynthia, Ben and Emily. It was tension filled. Andrew ripped his pants. He patched them with some muffler tape I found in my trunk. I almost crapped myself laughing at him. Emily semed mad at me for some reason, she so crazy. Ben seemed angry at me for some reason. Whateva, can't please 'em all eh? Food was good. I almost choked to death on a waffle. Cynthia tried to kill me. Got a teaspoon of sugar down Emily's shirt, it was hilarious. Went to Cassingham. Andrew's pants were still ripped. It was still funny. Talked to Emily for a while, it was a first, a serious conversation. Good times. Lutheran test! When I say "the force be with you," do you want to (or do you) say "and also with you?" If you do, you're probably either a Lutheran or a psyco... Maybe both. Found out Amanda's bailing out on going to the zoo for some reason. I was pissed. I wanted to go to the zoo with her. Now I have to find  another  time that she's free. She's hard to do stuff with. Grrrrrrr...  Saturday- Woke up on the couch, apparently I fell asleep watching TV the night before. Trippy man. Went to bed for another 2 1/2 hours. Slept a record 9 1/2 hours! I feel so rested! Very exciting if you know my sleep habits (stay up late and wake up early... I usually get like 4-6 hours sleep a night, 7 when I'm lucky). Called people about going to the Violent Femmes that night. Nobody answered. Crapola. Went to my mom's house. Talked to Zak, he couldn't go to the concert. Bastard. Went to Kroger and bought 3 tickets. 1 for me, 1 for Liz and 1 for probably Jimmy. Went to Popeye's with Jimmy and Zak. Jimmy couldn't go to the concert. Little bastard. Called Chris and told him he was going to the concert whether he wanted to or not. He decided to go. Dropped Jimmy and Zak off and picked up Chris and Liz. Steven called and said he wanted to go. Picked him up. He didn't have a ticket but he was planning on buying one off a scalper outside. Shifty. Drove to Promowest and parked. Steven got a ticket for $20, $6.50 less than I payed. Little bastard. Wated ouside for a while. Everyone there was all goth or alternative or crazy or whatnot. It was funny. Got inside and stood in a good spot. Harrased Liz. It was funny. Opening guys started. They sucked a fair amount. Violent Femmes came on. Like 30 people lit up a doobie at the same time. It was trippy (hehe, joke! Get it?  Trippy ! Sigh, I crack me up). They were freaking awesome! Gordon Gano seems to have packed on a few pounds in the last decade but that didn't stop them from kicking ass. I want an acoustic bass! They're so cool sounding! The drummer was hilarious, he kept hitting on the croud and was always jumping around and whatnot. I almost died from the pot/ciggarette smoke but it was worth it. Even though now I think I have a niccotine addiction (twitch). Saw Danielle and Will Lesser (he seemed to quiet and wussy to be there., I think he got trampled). Went to Waffle House then dropped everyone off. Went home. Got online and started writing this entry. Now that I'm out of things to write about I bid you adieu. Adios. <>

      Me sleepy. Me horny. Me liking the promise of warm weather this weekend. Methinks this weekend will kick major ass. Me will tell you about it on Sunday after me has done all the kick ass things me hopes me will do. What does you think of me new way of talking. Does it annoy you like it annoys me? Me is going to stop now. Alright then, this weekend I think I'm going to a show (a musical), a concert (Violent Femmes!), the zoo (I'd better go to the zoo... you know who you are), a movie (The Punsiher, to review it for Torch) and church. Plus homework and rehearsal. This will be a fun weekend. I'm out. Peace. <>

      The hick gene. Some say it is a myth, some say it is real. I am hewre to prove to you that the hick gene not only exists, but that I am a carrier of it. Here are my findings:  Exhibit 1-  Hair. The hick gene is responsable for mullets, rat-tails and the ever feared rat-tail mullet. I recently got a haircut in an attempt to stop the growth of a rat-tail mullet that had me scared.  Exhibit 2-  Nakedness. The gene is responsable for the hick urge to wear as little clothing as possible. I hate wearing shirts (well, pants too. But I have to wear pants or else people get too blown away by my sexy body. Heehee).  Exhibit 3-  Feeshin'. That's right. Feeshin' (fishing for those who don't catch my meaning). Fishing is a vital hick activity. The gene makes you want to fish and makes you think about what fish is edible and what isn't. I know how to clean a fish, I'm not ashamed of that. I am ashamed, however, to admit that when I was on vacation I went snorkeling, while in the water I saw several fish and wondered "Do those fish taste good?" It's scary, I know. That is all I have been able to identify for now. I will continue to search for more evidence about this elusive and powerful gene. <>

      Today China said something about me being a negative "my life sucks" guy and I realized she was right. So I'm going to stop all my bitching and quit yaking about how much my life sucks. I mean, I have it good, so what if some things suck a little, I'm still lucky. I should be happy and instead I'm bitching abuot my dad not having a job and my not liking Debbie that much. Oh well. It happens and I'd better just get used to it. No more whining. If any of you catch me doing it I want you to tell me I'm being a sissy. Ok then, I'm actually writing a paper right now, so I'll write more later tonight. Peace. <>

      Amanda- This one mentions you a fair amount because we've grown up together and I consider you one of the best friends I have, probably because we're the same person...  I've come to the conclusion that I am the most contradicted person ever. I care yet I could care less. I get over things quickly yet I dwell on them for a long time. I'm religous yet I question religion. I'm happy yet sad. I'm angry yet passive. I'm tired yet awake. I'm lonely yet not. I'm stressed yet, yet, ok, I'm just stressed. But the rest is true. Oh well, no sense fighting it. I mean, without the stress and exhaustion I'd be bored. Amanda and I had a converstaion about it on Thursday, she thinks I need more sleep and that I feel like shit when I  do  sleep in because my body isn't adjusted to getting 8 or 9 hours sleep. She's probably right. She's good for advice and talking to. What I think I really need is a few days where I sleep in and do whaever the hell I want to do. Hang out with who I want and stay out as long as I want. I wish. Maybe in June I'll find the time to do what I want with who I want for a few days... hopefully. I dunno, what's the point being all sad or whatever? Get over it. I mean, you only live once, have fun with life. That's how I view life, so why the hell am I so preoccupied about something? I don't even know what exactly is bothering me but whatever it is it's driving me nuts. I feel like something is missing. You know? Like I'm one thing short of complete. And I don't start getting all depressed or whatever until I'm alone, at night, sitting around listening to music or I see ceartin people or I see something that reminds me of someone or something else. I'm fine 90% of the time. It's the other 10% that mess me up. Oh well. It happens.  I want to leave Bexley and do something. Everyone I know has some trip or some event they look back on and say "yeah, that was great." Ok, I have Russia and Atlanta. But I was a little shit in Russia and I need to go back with different people and like 3 months after Atlanta everything fell apart and the whole youth group got restructured. Now there's all these people that, as much as I hate to say it, bug me like nothing else. Sarah is the only one that I grew up with that still goes to Redeemer. Amanda and Little Matt need to come back. Amanda, you need to come back. I knew you too well to have you leave all the sudden. Get your ass back here man. Help me save the Luther League. Next year we lose Jimmy and leave me, Sarah, Heather and Kristin alone. Elaine, I didn't forget you, its just that you never talk and I know jack-diddley about you so I don't really put you in the same group, although you are waaaay better than Graham and them. And then with the exception of Sarah all of the people I just mentioned I never hang out with or know very well. I suppose I do know them well so I don't know what I mean. It just doesn't feel right. I dunno. I guess its just that Brittany is dating Big Matt, Kristin is taking Heather to India on a mission trip and they're best friends now and Sarah and I don't hang out much now that Michelle and I broke up and I don't have much time. I need someone there next year that is like that which is why I'm telling you Amanda, come back. Ok, I think I've confused most of you since almost none of you really know what the hell I'm talking about so I'm out. Peace. <>

      Have you ever had something really good happen-something that you've secretly wished for since you were young-but the problem is you aren't sure if it should have happened because of what it may do to things between you and a person? (although I don't think It'll do much, I can't be sure) I just did.<>

      I'm worried. My dad has decided not to shave until he gets another job interview. That was three weeks ago. He's on the verge of looking out of state. If he does go, which is looking likely, Debbie, Noah and probably Jill would go too. I'm not too concerned with Debbie or Noah, it's my dad and Jill that bother me. As much as I hate to admit it, things just wouldn't be the same without my psyco little sister harassing me. And my dad and I used to be so close. I mean, we used to go bowling every week and see movies and hang out. Before seeing Hellboy this weekend the last movie we saw was Return of the King. That was almost four moths ago. He told me on Sunday that he can use money in his bank account for about another six months beofre things get desperate and that he would hate to have to use the money he has saved up for me and Jill for college. I would hate that too but I would want him to use it. I'm worried nonetheless, three weeks is a long time to go without an interview and I'd hate to have to use my money to support the family but I would. I just don;t want to tell him that because it would only stress him out more to make him think I'm planning on using my earnings to support the family. Especially when I'm already having money problems of my own (prom, the car, etc.)      That's another thing. Debbie and Noah are starting to bother me. Debbie keps trying to mother me, calling me honey and all that shit. I hate it. The only people that have been able to pull that off are friends, and fairly good ones at that. I don't want to sound like a bad person or like one of those little whiny teenagers that has to control everyone but she's always there, I never get any time alone. Not at my mom's, not at my dad's, not at school. I just want to be able to sit around and hang out with my dad or be alone, but no, with her and Noah around someone's always near me. It's driving me insane and they aren't even married yet. Speaking of Noah, he's just like any other annoying little shit 12 year old. He whins all the time, screeches lilke a girl and invades everyones privacy. I'm going to hurt him. Oh well. I suppose I'd better quit bitching. <>

      I saw Hellboy today with my dad. It was actually pretty good. It had a religous side to it that got me thinking... do Christians have pilgrimages? Either way I'm going on one of my own. I'm trying to decide where to go... so far I want to see Augsburg, The Vatican, Westminster Abbey, Jerusalem, The Dead Sea, Nazareth, somewhere in Spain and Constantinople. That way I get an overall dose of every part of Christanity, not just the Lutheran part. I also decided I need to find a good Rosary that I may or may not wear around my wrist. Holy crap, I'm turning Catholic. Really, I'm just looking for places to pray. I really like praying. There's something about it that makes you feel so close to God, it's a great form of meditation. The only problem is, I don't have any places that I really like to pray at. The Seminary is pretty good, so is Redeemer. Problem is, I can't always go there. I need to make somehwere at my mom's that I can go. All I need is a big cross, some holy water quiet. Crap, two of those are hard to come by. I can get a cross anywehere but peace and quiet? Not in my house. I duno, I think I just want to go visit a bunch of sacred places and feel more religious or close to God or something. You know what's wierd? I swear when I find a good cross or something religous I can almost feel something like power coming from it. Sounds stupid, I know, but I swear I can. Oh well. <>

      Ok. For months now I've ben trying to figure out what I am to other people, I mean, I'll ask how someone is and then 10 minutes later I know some giant secret that I can't talk about involing said person(s) or how I always end up accidentally taking over things and becoming the leader guy. It's strange. Well, I figured it out, I'm a giant crutch. I'm not complaining, I like hearing people's problems and all but it seems like everyone I know confides in me or rants to me on a weekly (or at least monthly) basis. As far as I can guess, either people know I have no reason or urge to flap my gums or they figure I'm some loserish guy that won't tell anything to their friends. And as far as taking crap over is concerned, I accidentally took over the student movement to save Decker. All I did was go talk to Johnson when everyone else was losing hope and suddenly we're organized and working on a plan of attack... there's hope in that fight. I dunno, apparently people either see me as an asshole, a drug addict (even though I don't do drugs), a pcycho or as a confidant of sorts. Which is fine with me but it's strange when everything I do is behind the scenes so to speak. I'm never the one that a person calls just to talk to, I'm rarely the one a person wants to hang out with and I'm never someone that gets all the hug-happy affectionate greetings from people. I'm just the guy everyone talks to about everyone else and never hangs out with. Alas! No hanging out for me!<>

      Zak and I stood in my back yard and talked about being older and life in general for like an hour and a half today, it was good and yet so strange at the same time... so now I'm here and these lyrics fit my mood.  Coldplay- The Scientist Come up to meet you, tell you I’m sorry You don’t know how lovely you are I had to find you, tell you I need you Tell you I set you apart Tell me your secrets, and ask me your questions Oh lets go back to the start Running in circles, coming up tails Heads on a silence apart  Nobody said it was easy Oh it’s such a shame for us to part Nobody said it was easy No one ever said that it would be this hard Oh take me back to the start I was just guessing at numbers and figures Pulling your puzzles apart Questions of science, science and progress Do not speak as loud as my heart Tell me you love me, come back and haunt me Oh and I rush to the start Running in circles, chasing our tails Coming back as we are  Nobody said it was easy Oh it’s such a shame for us to part Nobody said it was easy No one ever said it would be so hard I’m going back to the start  Oh ooh ooh ooh ooh ohh (x4)  Wilco-Heavy Metal Drummer I still miss those heavy metal bands She used to go see on the landing in the summer She fell in love with a drummer She fell in love with the drummer She fell in love Shiny shiny pants and bleach blonde hair A double kick drum by the river in the summer She fell in love with a drummer Another & another She fell in love I miss the innocence I’ve known Playing kiss covers Beautiful & stoned Unlock my body and move myself to dance In long liquid flowing blowing glass Classical music blasting That’s still ringing in my ears I still miss those heavy metal bands She used to go see on the landing in the summer She fell in love with a drummer She fell in love with the drummer She fell in love I miss the innocence I’ve known Playing kiss covers Beautiful & stoned I miss the innocence I’ve known Playing kiss covers Beautiful & stoned Playing kiss covers Beautiful & stoned Playing kiss covers Beautiful & stoned  Local H- Bound for the Floor Born to be down I’ve learned all my lessons before now Born to be down I think you’ll get used to it  And you just don’t get it You keep it copacetic And you learn to accept it You know it’s so pathetic  Born to be down I think that I’ve said this before now Born to be down What good is confidence?   And you just don’t get it You keep it copacetic And you learn to accept it You know it’s so pathetic And you don’t  Blink 182- Adam's Song I never thought I’d die alone I laughed the loudest who’d have known I traced the cord back to the wall No wonder it was never plugged in at all I took my time, I hurried up The choice was mine, I didn’t think enough I’m too depressed to go on You’ll be sorry when I’m gone  I never conquered, rarely came 16 just held such better days Days when I still felt alive We couldn’t wait to get outside The world was wide, too late to try The tour was over we’d survived I couldn’t wait till I got home To pass the time in my room alone  I never thought I’d die alone Another six months I’ll be unknown Give all my things to all my friends You’ll never set foot in my room again You’ll close it off, board it up Remember the time that I spilled the cup Of apple juice in the hall Please tell mom this is not her fault  I never conquered, rarely came But tomorrow holds such better days Days when I can still feel alive When I can’t wait to get outside The world is wide, the time goes by The tour is over, I’ve survived I can’t wait till I get home To pass the time in my room alone  Violent Femmes- American Music Do you like amercan music I like american music Don’t you like american music baby I want you to hold me I want your arms around me I want you to hold me baby Did you do too many drugs I did too many drugs Did you do too many drugs too baby You were born too late I was born too soon But every time I look at that ugly moon It reminds me of you It reminds me of you ooh ooh ooh I need a date to the prom Would you like to come along But nobody would go to the prom with me baby They didn’t like american music They never heard american music They didn’t know the music was in my soul baby You were born too soon I was born too late But every time I look at that ugly lake It reminds me of me It reminds me of me Do you like american music We like american music I like american music baby Do you like american music We like all kinds of music But I like american music best Baby you were born too late And I was born too late But every time I look at that ugly lake It reminds me of me It reminds me of me Do you like american music It reminds me of me Do you like american music...  That's all I got. There's other songs but I'm not in the mood to try and find that lyrics (EX: REM- Mad World, Postal Service- Such Great Heights, Mars Volta- Televators). I feel old.<>

           Ok, this week has sucked royally. Between theater, the D I have in FST, the Decker thing, Michelle and I breaking up, secret family loathings and work soap opera I haven't had an exactly stress-free week. Ya know? It's kinda like taking shit, piling it on an already big shit pile and then placing that pile on you at the worst time possible. Right now I'm trying to hold on to some resemblance of sanity listening to mellow, quasi-depressing music (Wilco- Heavy Metal Drummer, Beatles- You've Got to Hide Your Love Away, Coldplay- The Scientist, Incubus- Warning, Weezer- Island in the Sun, Local H- Copacetic, Johnny Cash- Hurt, etc.) in the small hope that it will be somehow cathartic and make me feel better, it isn't. At least the songs are good.      I'm alright in theater and in some of my classes, but when I see some happy couple or do something that makes me think of how much I've grown to hate Bexley it makes me want to start screaming at people and I want to go beat the crap out of something (non-living in most cases, unless it's Dr. Johnson or Brian Schottenstein). I've learned I have implosive feelings, it all builds up inside then comes crashing down on me, rarely exploding out onto others.      I really need to go to church. It always helped. I can go to Sunday school and be with friends (although the ratio of friends to people that I'd rather not be arround is rapidly closing) and not have to worry about anything. I feel so, so, so religiously pure for the rest of the day, like nothing I do is wrong. Then Sunday ends and I go back to school and am surrounded by people that have life way to easy for them and I go back to non-church mode. I swear if it wasn't for theater I wouldn't have fun in school and I never would've known that there are more good people in Bexley than I origionally thought. I haven't been to church in 2 1/2 weeks, I need to go.      There are so many people that I don't talk to anymore and it makes me sad. I have a sunch of friends that I want nothing more than to be able to see them once or maybe hang out with for a day (Amanda, Sarah, Amanda, all of Mike's old gym friends, Berwick people) but I don't have the time and when I do, they don't, or I don't even know how to go about finding them and I don't know what has happened to them. It's quite a strange feeling. The worst one is Amanda, I mean I grew up with her. Church was fun with her. We were so similar, so close. She was so fun. Then her family left the church and I didn't hear from her for like 5 months. Then she showed up one Sunday and it felt strange, she was there but so were four people that she didn't know and it made her seem like some new visitor and not as the long lost member that Jimmy, Sarah, Heather and I saw her as. It was wierd. Now we talk online all the time, but when we do it isn't the same. It just doesn't feel like old times. Everything is so different and I can't tell if it's good or not.      I feel like a horrible person, I do things that are so very un-Christian. A lot of things. My experiences with women has left nothing but a somewhat long, sad trail of hurt and akward conversations. Why can't this shit be easier? All I have to do is survive tomorrow, then I get a weekend. Even though the people I'd really like to see I won't, not that my friends aren't bad, I'm just saying.      I need to cheer the crap up. This mood is getting old fast.<>

      Hmm... well I saw Andy in the hospital this week, he seems to be doing well (or at least as well as a guy with pnemonia in the hospital for a week can be). Either way it sucks and I hope he gets better.  So I figured I was over liking Amanda, then I went to her house today to watch some movies and I realized, I'm not and I'm actually worse off now than I was before. I dunno, what gets me is that it isn't like I don't have other options... I do, I just never have any urge to pursue any once I start to work up the balls to. (For those unaware, it takes me a suprisingly long ass time to get the balls to do anything involving women.) And every now and then she says something about being alone or needing a boyfriend and I want to just ask, but I don't since I know the answer. I dunno, I think I'm going crazy (well, crazy in a new way, not the way you are all familiar with). I don't get it. Argh, this blows my ass. I'm so close to what I want yet so freaking far away. Ah bugger!  Either way I'm ending this one with a quote: Love sought is good, but given unsought is better  --William Shakespeare

      So I can't tell whether I should be happy or sad, angry or not, bitter or forgiving... crap, this is evil.  So Decker's last two shows are tomorrow... that sucks like none other. I know everyone will probably be crying their eyes out and I'll be standing there wanting to but not which is a bad feeling, ya know?  I'm going to kill the crew. They are almost all incompetent and all they do is bitch and talk back to me. Whores.  So I think if I could redo my Junior year I would in a heartbeat... I've fucked up too many times in too many ways... I just want to get away from it, it haunts me everywhere I go.  To the people on crew that have done nothing but talk about me behind my back and go silent when I am around... Fuck you. Fuck all of you. You can all blow me.  I think I'll go yell and throw things now... peace. <>

He's awesome. The drive sucked. Mark blew a tire on the drive over, it was funny.  The plays are good. I've put so many freaking hours into there shouws I wish I was getting paid, I'd be rich. You all need to see the shows. Here's the schedule: Thursday- Mousetrap at 7:30 Friday- Asrenic at 7:30 Saturday- Arsenic at 3:30, Mousetrap at 7:30 Sunday- Mousetrap at 3:30, Arsenic at 7:30  That's all I got for now.

I have spent so much freaking time in the theater it isn't even funny, you'd all better come see the shows...  I'm going to my brother college graduation this weekend, 9 hours in a van full of his crap and no A/C... fun.  Morgan- Why do you hate me? What have I done? Do you know what a bitch you must be if you went to prom with me even though you claim to hate me. Do you know how much that cost? WTF?  I think I'm bout for now, if I say anything else I'd just be repeating old topics (Amanda, money, family, more Amanda etc...) I'm out for now. Peace. <>

      Ok, here's a recap of my weekend:  Friday- Rehearsals. Went to my dad's. Slept.  Saturday- Woke up at 7:30 for crew at 8:00. Spent 15 1/2 hours in the school. Picked up Zak, Chris and Steven to go play Risk at my house. Got molested by Steven and later Chris. Zak got revenge on Chris for me. It was great fun. Went to sleep around 5:30.  Sunday- Woke up around 10:00. Took everybody home at 11:30. Went to lunch and saw  13 Going on 30  (extreme chick flick but she wanted to see it so whateva) with my mom for Mother's Day. Came home and saw  Charlie's Angels 2  with my mom, it sucked ass but there was a lot of t&a so it compensated.  Onto some other points:  I've discovered the two basic formes of chick flicks.    1) The fairly rare woman inherits some children, at least one of them a teenage girl who hates her, and they all struggle and yell until it reaches a teary climax where everyone loves eachother. Bring tissues.    2) Two old childhood crushes who haven't seen eachother in years hit it off and one of them breaks off a wedding to marry the crush.  So I was talking to Amanda today and she said she has something going with a guy named Chris. I didn't know what to say so I asked her what he was like (Well, what I  wanted  to say was "forget him! I'm right here! Pick me!" But I know that chance, well, there never was a chance really so there isn't much I can do). He's got me beat in most aspects except apparently he has a tendency to cheat on his girlfriends... not a good thing. Ah well, I suppose there isn't anything I can do besides get over her but it aint exactly easy. So all I can do is wish her the best of luck. Good luck. I'm out. Peace. <>

I had my first 13-hour school day of the show... rock on!  I took a Spanish test today and it actually caused my physical pain  I messed up a lab in Chem because Chris is stupid  My car is  still  missing a front license plate  Steven and I bought 8 drinks, 40 soft tacos and a chicken quesadilla for crew from Taco Bell... it cost $40.80  Hemmingway is cool  Varnish makes you dizzy (or high as the case may be)  Sheep go to Heaven, goats go to Hell and alpacas go to Jersey  That's all for now... peace <>

      Oh man, It's been a good weekend... allow me to recap it for you:  Friday- School, that sucked but whatever. After school we had a set build (for my theater incompetent readers that's where the crew and actors that don't suck build the set), it was pretty good. We're behind schedule and I'm starting to get a little nervous but oh well. After the build I went and hung out with Zak and Jimmy. Then went home and went to bed.  Saturday- SAT, it was brutal. I can't tell how I did but I can say it sucked my ass. After that test from Hell I went to the theater and worked on the set for three or so hours then went to work. I worked with Micah and Lizzie whch was fun because Micah is cool and Lizzie is both fun and really really hot, ask Kenny, he'll back me up. Worked from 3:45 to 10:00ish and then went to my dad's and went to bed early (for me at least) at 1:30 or 2:00.  Sunday- Slept through Sunday School and just went to church. Had a build from 12:30 to 4:00ish. Went back to my dad's and ate ham n' Beans, cornbread and fried potatoes. Almost puked but they were good nonetheless. Layed around on my ass the whole evening. Now I'm writing this.  I've realized theater makes me really happy. Nothing can piss me off. Nothing really depresses me. Nothing really phases me any. I'm just too giddy. Fun fun.  I talked to Ryan our tech guy today at the build and he's going to getme on crew for Hamlet in the Park at  Schiff Park or something like that. Either way I'm really excited. The show is in mid-June and I may get paid, which kicks ass. Not only that but it's  Hamlet!  The only thing cooler than that is Macbeth. Holy crap that's a great show.  Amanda- What are you doing next Sunday? Everyone Else- What are you doing all summer?  Music o' the weekend: Beck- Loser Modest Mouse- Float On Average White Band- Play That Funky Music White Boy Anything Dave Matthews Eagle Eye Cherry- SaveTonight  That's all for now. Peace. <>

      Moving blows. On the plus side at my dad's new house I can get to the roof from my room so I have a place to go and be one with myself (in other words, zone out for long ass periods of time).   Hamlet  is good. You all need to go out and see it. I'm out for now... nothing new or interesting. Peace. <>

      It's like 2:00 a.m. amd I've been at a bar all night so I'm pretty tired so this will be a fairly random stream-of-consciencesness (sp?) update: If you want an interesting time go to a bar with a bunch of people 10 or more years older than you and sit there and listen to them drink, smoke (heavily) and talk.  Brushfire Fairytales (Jack Johnson) is the best CD ever.  I need to paint my new room at my dad's this week.   Hamlet  is going well.  Debbie is trying very hard to hook me up with some girl named Amanda (ironic).  I am suprisingly tired.  If you listen to track 8 of Snow Patrol's CD  Give Up  at about the 1:30 mark and drive through a BP carwash you get the trippiest soundtrack ever (it lines up like freaking perfectly, I'm telling you, this is some crazy stuff).  I'm out for now. Peace. <>

      So summer school still sucks (nifty, they all had the same first letter!). I went to some bar in German Village with some of the  Hamlet  cast, it was fun. Although they all smoked so I got a lot of 2nd hand smoke in me and I was hocking up fire loogies the whole next day (TMI, I know). My dad got a house in Reynoldsburg so you all have to come over and see it sometime. Uhhh, that is all that is new since I'm not going out and dooing exciting things with people. If you wanna do something call me, seriously, I'm dying over here! Peace. <>

      We had a private tent dinner for all the wealthy blueblood bastards tonight. Halfway through intermission we had a small shower. Nothing bad, the show went on. Not more than 30 minutes into the 2nd half of the show the sjy turns dark and the rain comes in and we hear those three special words- "I'm calling it." Thje show was cancelled before Ophelia died. Funny stuff. Either way I got drenched and got a massive wedgie while cleaning up the set. It was a tad bit painful. Hopefully tomorrow things will be better...  In other news- I might be able to get an unpaid (not good) internship at the Shadowbox (good). That would be fun. That is all for now. Peace. <>

      My hands are black and sore. I have Shakespeare in my mind. I'm tired all the time and don't eat like I should. Yes... theatre is back for me!  To my rapidly depressing friends- Michelle- It's ok, just be happy. I forgive you. Amanda- I'm always around. You can come to me whenever (even though I know I'm not your first choice) Everyone else- Be happy.  Summer school is boring as Hell and bites my pasty white ass! 116 hours more to go untill I'm done.

      Hmmm... I got a laptop from my dad (not new or anything, actually, he stole it from JII right before they went bankrupt so it was cheap... and by cheap I mean free). All it cost me was the $5 charger cord A/C adapter thing. All I have to do is figure out why it wont charge and I'll be set.  I started job number two on Sunday. Outdoor Shakespeare in the Park, it's hotter than balls outside and it pays shit for cash ($250 for a months work) but It's theatre so it's good.  Summer school is dull and draind the life out of me. 116 hours more to go. That's all for now. Adios. <>

      So I celebrated my birthday at my mom's today and I got some good stuff. I got an acoustic guitar so I can finally become a rock god (all I need is to learn how to play, a hit song and some grupies... actually, all I  really  need is the groupies). I also got some CD's and the two greatest board games ever made, Risk and Stratego. I know what you all are thinking... you all are thinking to yourselves  damn, he is so cool for having those games , and I agree. But seriously, you all need to play them sometime, they're fun.  I finished my exams and am now officially a Senior! Although if I had the chance I would prolly go back and redo my Junior year to fix a few (and by a few I mean a lot) of things. But I can't do that so whateva.  I got my stiches out today, which is suprisingly annoying to do. They have to cut the knot which hurt a bit and then the dentist pulled out the thread which feels really, really funky. Either way I'm almost done with the gum graft ordeal. Rock on.  That's all I have for now. Peace. <>

      "Such Great Heights" The Postal Service  I am thinking it's a sign that the freckles In our eyes are mirror images and when We kiss they're perfectly aligned And I have to speculate that God himself Did make us into corresponding shapes like Puzzle pieces from the clay True, it may seem like a stretch, but Its thoughts like this that catch my troubled Head when you're away when I am missing you to death When you are out there on the road for Several weeks of shows and when you scan The radio, I hope this song will guide you home  They will see us waving from such great Heights, 'come down now,' they'll say But everything looks perfect from far away, 'come down now,' but we'll stay...  I tried my best to leave this all on your Machine but the persistent beat it sounded Thin upon listening That frankly will not fly. you will hear The shrillest highs and lowest lows with The windows down when this is guiding you home  They will see us waving from such great Heights, 'come down now,' they'll say But everything looks perfect from far away, 'come down now,' but we'll stay...   Ok, this is more directed at someone than it is a post to everyone. Really, this is because I never really have the balls to say what I want to when I'm around you in person... but it's all good I suppose. Either way you should listen to this song. Oh, and I'm sure posts about (or to I suppose) Amanda are getting old to everyone and I sympathize but deal with it. Peace. <>

      Holy crap, I have a 79.56% in Spanish and she rounded it to a B-... that was a close one.  So I went to Amanda and later my cousin Sabrina's graduation parties on Saturday.Well, Amanda's was more fun, but it was nice to see my cousins again (even though all the ones I like left after like a half an hour). Congrats to Amanda and Sabrina (and Amanda, I'm sure I'll be on campus a fair amount so I'll stop by every now and then to make sure you haven't gotten in  too  mush trouble).  I got some good CD's from my dad for my birthday, now all I need to do is fix my CD player...  So I've watched a lot of stuff about D-Day this week and WWII in general and I can say that Bush is a dumbfuck (yes, a dumbfuck) for comparing Iraq to WWII. He has no clue what he is talking about. WWII (and WWI for that matter) was a one-time sort of war. Iraq was more of a one-sided ass kicking and occupation, WWII was an actual struggle against a clear enemy. Ah well, Bush is an idiot anyway.  Exams are over Tuesday for me so if anyone wants to do something after then call me at my mom's (236-1609)... I'll be bored out of my mind. Seriously, call me and we'll do something-- I'm sure I'll be desperate to get out of the house.  I'm sure I have more to say but I appear to have blanked on what it was so instead I think I'll go to bed. Peace. <>

      So I turned 17 on Thursday and almost nobody noticed... ah well. It's funny, I'm not sure if I'm even having a party or anything officiaL like that. Actually, I'm not even sure I'm getting anything fancy or whatever- hmmm...  My gums are tingling a fair amount and it is driving me nuts. It's this annoying, throbbing tingle that won't go away.  Hmm, what else? LOTR Risk is fun. Andy is finally out of the hopital. Gas is too freaking expensive. Exams are a mixed blessing. I got the summer Shakespeare job. Ok, I think I'm out. Peace. <>

      So I had a gum graft today... allow me to describe how that works... It starts with a local of novacaine (sp?) in my upper right gums by my bicuspid and another local in and around the tear to be grafted. (By the way, novacaine tastes like shit, burns and makes you gag when swallowed. Don't do it, even if it is an accident.) The doctor guy then proceeded to cut the hell out of the tear in my gums to make it more "receptive" to the graft. After the slicing he moved on to the roof of my mouth and cut a section (and by section I mean big ass chunk)of gum tissue out. He was kind enough to sew the hole shut and now I have three stitches in the roof of my mouth. The dentist guy then proceeded to sew the chunk of flesh to the "blood pan" in the tear in my gums. By the time that was over the novacaine had started to wear off and my mouth was beginnning to throb to I went home and took tsome pain killer. On another note, I couldn't help but notice the dentist's gloves were covered in blood, my mouth was pooling blood, the bib thing you have to wear was spattered with blood (noticing a trend yet?) and I was spitting up blood until like 10:00 in the night. Woo. Now I have to wear an upper jaw retainer all the time to protect the stitches and it is a bitch to have. It falls out a lot and makes it hard to chew with.  Well, I must be off but all I can say is don't get a tear in your gums, it isn't fun! Peace. <>  P.S.- Don't forget, my birthday is tomorrow (today for most of you reading this) so wish me a happy 17th!

      Well, almost nothing of interest has happened this week so I don't have much to say. Noah and Jill appear to hate eachother, I've made my threats about crew this year to Shani and I'm low on gas but don't want to pay to fill up the tank. This weekend I have a wedding in Connecticut and the  Hamlet  cast party maybe. I'll write again on Tuesday possibly. Peace. <>

      Ah XBox, is there anything it can't do? I say no. So today we finished sumer school (thank God) and, a;though it will suck not hearing Mr. Barends sarcasm, getting groped by Greg and cheating with&nbsp;Andrew I think the sleep and free time&nbsp;I'll gain will more than make up for those losses. Let my summer begin for it's glorious four weeks of nothingness. Ahhhh freedom. Now all I need is stuff to do... enter Halo. This is by far the best game e ver made, I don't know what it is but I can't stop playing it, I suck, but I enjoy sucking (at Halo, no jokes needed). I have a feeling I'll end up buying Halo and play it on Noah's XBox and then BAM! Another promising young soul lost to Microsoft and videogames. Anyhoo, this post was just to keep me occupied and there probably won't e another one for a while since I leave for a wedding in Connecticut on  Thursday and I won't be doing much until then. Peace, love and Rock &amp; Roll. <>

       Disclaimer- If you aren't a Lutheran and if you didn't go with me to the Atlanta Gathering this will likely&nbsp;mean jack shit to you until about halfway through.  &nbsp; I was reading someone's journal thing this weekend and they mentioned Atlanta and I thought to myself&nbsp;  holy crap, that was a year ago?   I thought it had been longer. A year ago today I was in a hotel, surrounded by 1500 other Lutherans, hanging out with Amanda, Heather, Jimmy, Sarah, Big and Little Matt and our awesome adults (Becky and Kris) completely oblivious to what was going on around me. I had no idea that in two months Little Matt and Amanda would bo gone and Big Matt would be in college and that our group would be changed in a way that bothers me still. About five hours from now (a year ago) I would be knocking on Kris's door with all my stuff ready to leave early to head out for another trip with the family, wishing I could stay for the last meeting in the dome and wanting desperately to make the eight or nine hour drive back to Columbus with the group. I said my tired goodbyes to everyone and told them I'd see them in two weeks, ready for a year of awesomeness. Not exactly. Instead my Junior year was filled with heartache, regrets, stupid mistakes, false hope and theatre. Of those theatre was the best and worst (most of my stress and maor crisis' evolved from theatre annoyingly enough). I look back and say to myself "wow, you fucked up."I never thought it would happen but I find myself thinking,   if I could take this year back and do it again, I would in an instant.   Now here's the part where I bring the whole thing together- I look at pictures from Atlanta and think of all the things I could have done. I find myself wishing I would have fought more in the begining, done less in the middle and been more honest in the end. I look at the past year as one of my biggest successes and my stupidest mistakes. Ok, I lied. This isn't going to wrap it up. I could go on forever but instead I'm going to stop for tonight and go sleep. Hopefully this was coherent because I don't know what the hell I'm typing anymore. Peace? <>

      So there is one thing that has bothered me for a while now- every time I go to Amanda's I turn into this real quiet creepy guy that sits in the corner and looks all sullen and wallflowery. I know I'm not like that, most people do. It's strange, I get there and become an introvert. And then it seems like I'm either pissed off, depressed or not enjoying myself, which I am. It's strange. I guess it goes hand in hand with my inability to say what I really want to say around most people. That and I figured out I still like her, which is bad since It'll never work and I should just give up, yet I can't. Damn wierdness. &nbsp; In other news, I'm all moved in at mny dad's and I've spent my first night there, it's good except my room faces East so in the morning if I leave my blinds open I get blinded. My room is nice, and it feels like me, which is good.  Dracula  is my new favorite book. It's insanely good and creepy. You all need to read it. Other than that my week was slow and rather dull. Maybe next week will bring something new... Peace. <>

      Well  Hamlet  ended which sucks. It was a lot of fun. I'll miss the show and everyone in the cast. Thanks to everyone that saw the show.  Apparently I was a good ASM. Or at least that's what people were saying (most of them were drunk at the time which made it funny to hear). Anyhoo, I had a revelation- High school is pointless. I know I always thought it but I finally realized it. Seriously, all of high school is one exceedingly emotional drama. I mean, everyone worries and panics about the smallest things. Who cares if you don't dress the best. Who cares if you bombed a Spanish test? Who cares if you didn't make the lead in the musical? Nobody. No one if going to look back at your high school career and make some judgement once you get into college. High school is supposed to be fun. Relax people. Enjoy yourselves a bit. What will happen will happen, life will suck at times and will be awesome at others. Just find some people you're good friends with and life will be ok. Now the point- I've decided to simply enjoy my senior year. I'll study and all that crap as needed, but mostly I'm just going to enjoy the total lack of responsibility.  On another random note, I now have like five people that are determined to take me out drinking when I'm in college. It's funny. Peace. <>

      I really like driving at night. I love driving home around 1:30 from Easy Street or Thurman's after  Hamlet  with my windows down and my radio off so that all I hear is wind and silence. It goves you time to think. Ok, it seems that all I could come up with that was even  remotely  interesting was that so I'm done for now... I'll write something better some other time when I'm not so tired. Peace. <>

      I'm still trying to think of something good to write and it ain't comming easy so it'll probably be a while before a good post comes along... sorry.  On another note I'm reading  Dracula  and it kicks ass. I like vampires a lot, they're the coolest of the horror characters. I mean c'mon, the very nature of them is that of extreme sensuality. That and Dracula is very sophisticated and evil... muahaha. Peace. <>

      I was trying to think of something really funny to write but everything I thought of was way longer than my lazy ass was prepared to type so all I'm gonna say is Mr. Barends sucks becuase I was writing a story in Spanish on the chalkboard while he was teaching and he yelled at me... jeez. <>

      Happy belated Independance Day!  Ah dear God... so I missed every fireworks show around this year because I was working at either Pizza Plus or  Hamlet  (which you all still need to see, this weekend is the last run). So my life is very boring. All I do is get up at 7:20, go to summer school. Come home. Sleep or watch TV or something. Go to one of my jobs. Come home. Go to bed. Woo. I haven't seen opr heard from any of my friends in like a week and I keep missing all these things I want to do because of work or moving. On the plus side, after this Sunday I'm completely free, I don't work much because  Hamlet  is over and my dad will be in the new house.  So rather than launch into a big rant I'm going to sum up all that is pissing me off or bugging me in as little space as possible. Here goes: What's going on with Holsclaw? Last thing I knew he wasn't even approved then suddenly he's moved in and everybody is hanging out with him. What the hell happened? What the hell is going on? I'm suddenly completely out of the theatre loop. That bugs me.  People that are happy and not alone can bite me.  I never do what I really badly want to do and then I have to sit and watch what I longed for taunt me.  To Morgan and a few unnamed (mostly middle school) crew people from Arsenic- fuck all of you. You almost ruined those shows... almost.  Uhh, I'm out I think. Peace. <>

      I spent last weekend in New York City visiting my David and his girlfriend, Jamie. It was fun except we only stayed a day, I'd like to go there and hang out for like a week but I don't have the time. We went to a They Might Be Giants concert in Prospect Park in Brooklyn, it was really fun. I then went to a wedding in Connecticut. It went well. Overly emotional but that might be because I didn't know the cousin that was getting married as well as other people did. It's funny, the whole Powell/ Rinell side of my family (my stepdad and older stepbrothers' family which I still consider family since I ignore the step-anything crap) is al the same. Everyone looks similar and everyone seems to study either religion or science. It is really, really... different. On the plus side I discovered three new cousins (one thet I've never met and two from marriage) which means I need to re-tally my family (I think I'm somewhere near 35 cousins and counting) and I also found out I have some fun family... really I found out one of my cousins, Karen, is fun and was the only person I talked to much the entire time.  There's other stuff I'm sure I could write and I'm sure I could m,ake this post more coherent but I'm lazy and I'll write more this week I'm sure. Peace. <>
