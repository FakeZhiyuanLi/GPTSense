      Yes, I seem to have posted my first blog into a cyberspace black hole.  It's nowhere to be found.  This will have to replace it.  Testing, one two three...

      You know how people always say that all the high school dorks and losers grow up to be the uber-successful Bill Gates types and all the popular kids grow up to be fat and pregnant? It might be true in some places, but that's not the way it worked at my school.     I didn't go to a normal public high school as portrayed in movies like Ferris Beuller's Day Off and Can't Hardly Wait. I went to a $16,000 a year private all-girls Episcopalian school in Washington, DC, the most uptight city on the east coast and that's saying something. It wasn't a Catholic school so we didn't have to wear plaid skirts and knee socks (much to the chagrin of subsequent boyfriends) and we didn't let our sexual repression manifest itself through bawdy encounters behind the cafeteria dumpsters. It wasn't the 80's so we didn't have lesbian orgies in the locker room. Mostly everybody just dressed from head to toe in J Crew and waited to get accepted early at Princeton.    The rich popular girls stayed rich and popular through college as far as I can tell, and the dorky math genius losers, of which there were several, went on to get their PhDs in quantum physics or primate pharmacology at MIT. I always knew that I was at neither end of the spectrum, and while I was in school, I remember that I believed myself to be a member of a snazzy subsect of the popular group. But now, with a little self-awareness under my belt, I can safely assure you that I was a dork. Not a nerd, because I didn't have the grades. More like one of the drama geeks, only I always got cut in the first round of auditions so even they wouldn't have me. I was off in my own stratosphere of weirdness, as evidenced by my "unique" fashion stylings.    I don't know why my mother let me out of the house dressing the way I did from 7th grade to 11th (by 12th, I had normalized through preppification). If I had gone to one of those tough public schools, I think I would have had my ass beat every day after homeroom.     Here's a bit of necessary background family history, so that you can understand what a well of misfit garmentry I was fishing from. My grandparents are Polish immigrants who, when packing up to leave their homeland forever, decided that traditional peasant garb fell under the category of "essential life belongings" and couldn't be left behind. Somehow these folk costumes had found their way into our storage closet and now I had a motley variety of sequined velvet vests, white petticoats, and kaleidoscopic headscarves to pick from. I was also going through (and have yet to emerge from) a tomboy phase, where I decided that boy clothes were way cool. Problem was, even though I didn't break 5 feet until I turned 16, my younger brother was still too small for me to skim off his wardrobe. So I started pawing through my father's sweater drawer and came up with some really nifty salmon-colored numbers.    My father is six foot five. There are photographs of me drowning in his sweaters, which I have layered over a frilly Polish geranium-print skirt, cascades of plastic beads my uncle brought me back from Mardi Gras, and a beret. In the winter of 8th grade, I wore a beret to school every single day. I'd rotate colors depending on the day of the week.    Needless to say, the  hormonally charged 13-year old boys who congregated with us on Friday afternoons in the courtyard, hoping to "accidentally" grope Allison Butera's boob while fumbling for an errant hacky-sack, might have found me mildly amusing but they certainly didn't want to date me. Although there was one anomaly - the socially elevated and surprisingly cute James Hoak.    James Hoak was my first official boyfriend. We dated for twelve weeks, which is a long-term relationship by Manhattan grown-up standards. It's funny how gossip whirls around before events actually take place - I was aware that James was "considering" asking me out for a week before it happened. We had never actually spoken, but he was friends with Harry Martin who was dating my friend Sarah, so it was practically fated that we end up together. He called my house one evening and asked me to a movie and I was so nervous (even though I was expecting his call) that I almost peed myself. We went on a double date (with 5th wheel Dan Dickens, whose father drove us all to the movie in the back of his Studebaker) to see something I don't remember. Maybe James held my hand.    For three months, we called each other sweetheart and honey and stayed up late talking on the phone, me curled up under the blankets to stifle my whispers and escape the wrath of my mother. Once, he invited me to his house for the afternoon. My mother dropped me off and met his mother, which was pure torture. His family was way richer than mine and I was terrified that James's mom might osmotically intuit this by talking to mine. The afternoon passed quickly, mosly we just played Sega and giggled nervously. He didn't try to kiss me, though I really wanted him to.    Then one day out of the blue, he called me up and dumped me. He said "this isn't working out" or something equally overdramatic. I was hurt, but more annoyed that I hadn't at least wormed my first kiss out of the whole thing. By the next week, he was dating Brooke Ronhovde who basically looked just like me only with way bigger boobs. I think she's in law school now.
