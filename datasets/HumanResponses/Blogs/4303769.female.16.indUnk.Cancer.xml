      SCROLL DOWN IF ANYONE FROM CAMP IS READING!  So let's move on to somehting happier, because drama should not be my only choice of journal entry. Work was fab today. Libby was working and she is a blast to work w/ and she is so damn fast at everything! Tomorrow I am going shopping and I cannot wait to buy some jewelry, I am such a girly girl sometimes, but hey, after shopping, I am going hiking and fishing and that isn't always girly. It's odd how much I have changed. Okay It is shout out time, I am going to start this fabolous post w/ my camp friends. I recentely went to U of O and had a fabolous time  learning debate and such and making friends. I admit I had my points where I simply wanted to go home, see my friends and give everyone the finger, but hey I survived right? We in the girl's dorn had our moments, Nicki spazzing over losing a debate, me spazzing at Kels for calling me a slacker, Kels spazzing at me for me telling her that question asking incesscintely in a public debate is bad, all of us spazzing before round. Basically we had our tifs, but we all loved each other immensely, we were like a sorority and the wrestlers ( SIGH) our fraternity. I love those girls, honestly the are the some of the meanest ( in any debate) and yet nicest girls I have ever met. And of course my wonderful debate partner Randy, who will Marry Emily, and is so great, and Colling my husband, who CAN spell cake, and Max, my love, who's hand is mine forever, and Nick, dear lord Nick, well I will shout out to him later. But Ya I love those guys so much, the girls a goal met for me. What goal? Getting along w/girls! I did it mom! No fights! ( my mom was seirously proud :D) But ya here goes my little shout-out descriptions....  Kelsey- My lovely Fashsion Goddess, how I miss thee. (Honestly, she is gorgeous) this girl could debate w/ anything and win, and if not she would intimidate the hell out of them. One day she will be president and she will come let me mooch a room in the whitehouse. One day she will also find a   man   ( not a pathetic  boy  named Chris) who will actually be good enough for her and he will buy her pretty things and be Mr Kelsey, the first man of the white house.  Nicole- My favorite! This girl could make Saddam Hussien write poetry and do ballet, she is just that loving and cute. She always makes you feel super happy and can make any bomb turn right back around and go back to where it came from. She makes me smile and I miss her "super fab" hugs. Not to mention her abusive remarks in debate, those crack me up.  Melody- The mom. Melody's laugh is what I miss the most, you could here that laugh from a mile away, I know one time I was asleep and woke up smiling cause I could here Melody laughing down the hall. No Joke! Also she always was there to smile and brighten our day and in a sense keep us in line, no reason why, she just had the power. Not to mention she takes rapids really well and can impale anyone w/ a volleyball. And! She can think the best of anyone, ever that nasty Nate who I cant to dress as a a skanky woman and send to Iraq ( JOKES!)  Niki- what nickname should I destine her w/? The Roomie? My alarmclock? I think she should be the work aholic, that girl would sometimes we up till the wee hours in the morning research, no joke! And boy was she pist when she lost. But she was great, we always did stuff for eachother, she helped me keep track of my keys and once made my bed, and I cleaned the room and let her use my laptop. She spent forever trying to get a guy and then she saw the cute quiet one that we all walked past and she was happy, neat isnt it? She really does deserve best and I hope all the b/s w/ her friends gets better cause she rocks.  That was mostly the girls I was realy close to, the Boys  Randy- My wonderful debate partner. This kid knows what debate is, knows what love is, knows how to put up w/ me, and knows how to do great impersonations, so he has it made. He has come so far in debate and is really smart, I really admire him. No matter what b/s I fed him during those 2 weeks he was still there for me, no matter what. He is such a great person. He is becoming somebody I really admire and I don't think he knows it.  Andrew- The Sarcastic Smart Kid. He is so cool. Defintion of cool? Andrew. He makes me laugh in a senical way, and still feel good about it, isnt that great? I miss his dramatic debate style that makes you want to puke and cry at the same time. He will be the next Terry, except less metrosexual, ok, scratch that, he is nothing like terry except for his cruel jokes and his great debating skills.  Alex- The Coolest Dork ever. This kid rocks my socks. He makes me smile and laugh and he is really neat-o-. He terrifies my computer but I love'm. Not to mention he looks fab w/ hair gel in his hair. He is pretty smart to, which is always a plus, and he brought the wonderful joke of FACE to my life. (tear*) And! He mooched hugs at any point posible.  Collin- My Husband. He can spell cake! Yet sometimes , food falls from above from him. The great thing also is he looks great w/o hair, and he looks so cute when he trys to act mean in debate, waving his fist and such. But anyways, he is a relaly great guy. I love the fact that he is waiting until after high school to have relationships, it show maturity on his part. We will forever share the common bond of being Weezer fans and be forever tyed by the Batman Blanket. Sigh... I miss you my love!  Terry- JOKES! He is the smartest teen I have ever met, it's a shame he only works for $8.00 and hour JOKES! We are so lucky to have gotten to learn all that great stuff from him, I know for one, even though we learned alot of Ted Turner, am a better Public Debater, I hope one day he gets a great job in the white house, or co-hosts w/ John Stewert, or invents the perfect Latte machine...or at the least.... the very least... gets to punch George Bush the face and the swiftly kick him in the nuts.  Nick- My Wrestler. This guys is so sweet, a little racist and close-minded  ( not on purpose) but still super. He is so absolutely gorgeous is not even funny, I love his abs. I talk to him here and there and it's mindless babble, but hey, that's why he was at wrestling camp and not debate right? He will forever work at Wendy's and I will forveer love the day his mind imploded do to Melody's big words and when he told me he would miss me. I Miss you Nick, I hope you got ungrounded!  Max- My Love. He is so super! We email letters the size of my Onbox every other day and he is a super fav person to talk to. I remember finally getting him to sit by me, and "stealing" him from his group. The first night we met I got him to stay let and we play Ouija Board and have been friends every since. He is really great to talk to and see's and brings out a side of me that most people don't ever get to see. He is one of my favorite people that I have come to meet and I cannot wait to email him!  Aww the sayings and memories: "Colin spell cake!" "Where's my keys!!! OMG!!...." On your neck Shannon!" "Damnit..." "Jokes!" A 5 yr old w/ Parkinsons... HA! "You know you are playing the a large cat box right?" "Hoe Bag!" " Bombs/ Porn is Bad!" " Bush is Still a F&%$face" (terry) Terry and his random Chapstick story and his Tanning PANTY LINES! Terry's Anorexic Fatt Butt Randy's Nakedness Blaine and his comments...my goodness Japenese Thunder! The Cheerleaders... Oiuja Sessions w/ Max And everything else that I missed I miss everyone....   Well I think thats everyone!  I have expressed my wonderful love are you happy? I am going to bed, I have a day of shopping tomorrow and I know more drama is going to emerge, it is just one of those kinda weeks where it stalks you like celery. I am going to be so tired tomorrow.... peace, love, and cupcakes Shanny Bannanny

      Ok so first off I have to thank my wonderfuly fashionable friend Kelsey for sending me here blog so I could intern steal the site and make my own! I LOVE YOU AND MISS YOU! Now an update on my life... Currently, living the single life, but that doesn't mean I don't have the drama of boys. Damn them. Robert is still being a pain. Honest to god, wether he believes it or not, he is a wonderful person who I have the upmost respect for and wish he would turn his life around again...but right now he is such a terd! Yep you heard me say it...terd. He has my most favortist hat in the whole world, I adore that hat w/ every fiber of my being and he is to stubborn to give it back. He is doing the macho man thing and saying "I will do it on my time, I don't run on your schedule". Grrr MACHO MEN! Robert if you read this GIVE ME MY HAT! PLEASE!! I have your blue jacket ( which is your brothers) and your black hat and I am holding them hostage. Then, an old friend/ ex boyfriend has come galloping in on a white horse back to my life. Sweet eh? Ya not. He is positvely the most amazing person I have ever met in my entire life, for the part that I have lived at least. Honest to goodness he is positively the closest thing to perfect I have ever witnessed. So why aren't I w/ him? Well when I was w/ him, I got scared, my life was in a downward spiral and I was hitting rock bottom ready to leave home and never come back and I didn't want to take him w/ me and so I broke up w/ him, left home and eventually came back by force. But ya there are some spots I will leave out and fast forward and he is back, and he is w/ a new woman but he still likes me, isn't that fabolous? Do I still like him? I'll never tell...but ya, it is something that preoccupies my mind. I do however miss his company, I mean who doesn't like the company of a close-to-perfect person? Ok I can Bitch for forever longer but I am to tired...

      Lazy day this morning, slept in and did massive laundry. I am so far behind in laundry it is not even funny. My parents, however think me miserably hanging up hoards of laundry is hilarious. A-holes....  But then I had cheer practice, it was kind of frustrating because I did not go to cheer camp, I had better opportunities called college and I missed out on alot. So I am far behind and it is frustrating, but I will buck up and take it as usual. I cannot wait until the first game, I hope to be a flyer so bad.  Ha random thought, the only one who got anything at camp was Andrew and his fab first kiss.  Lucky Basterd.  I saw an old friend/ fling today. I told him about my cheerleading car wash cause his friend Danny was there and he came once and had his car cleaned. First thing out of their mouth? " You should car wash in Bikini's, you would make more money!" Men...pshhh  It was cool to see and old friend though, hope he is doing well. He has great potential as a artist and has a beautiful mind, but I feel as if he wastes it sometimes. But what is a waste if you are having fun? I guess it makes that person happy, so it can't be a waste right. It's hard to put a defination on a waste.  Well I am going to go chat w/ my fab friend Nate, wait for my CD to finish burning, and then vacate to my room to learn my new cheers and GUH do laundry. ~Toodles~ Shanny

      So today I went shopping. I got 2 cute new shirts, tons of new earrings, some pants, a new address book, and some makeup. Also this cute little store asked me to model for them...no joke! They said they will call me 5 days before the show, they will fit me, then 5 days later I come back, model, get 30% of the entire store and get to keep what outfits I model. Isn't that neat-o-? My mom is very excited, she has wanted me to model for years, she got me a modeling gig 6 months ago, but it just wasn't my thing, I am not into fitting a certain look or style or weight. Also I dont like having a job based on my beauty, I would want one for brains or brawn. But hey, it makes my mom happy, I get free clothes, what could one show hurt right? I cannot wait for school, I know once it actually comes, I will hate it, but for now I am in mass anticipation. Cheerleading, debate, and class ruling sounds pretty good to me. I just got my uniform and I cannot wait for the first football game when I get to just scream and yell and do what I do best, be loud, obnoxious, athletic and peppy. Whoop Whoop...party over here! ( aww... I miss Nicole and Kelsey's Dances!) Then my mass improvement in debate will make my confidence at speech tourney's rise and things should just be overall super. But I am going to go to bed and email everyone my new blog. I have cheer practice tomorrow and I need Sleep!
