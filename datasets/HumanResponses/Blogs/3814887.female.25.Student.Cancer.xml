      Well I don't have a ton to report right now. Today has been pretty uneventful as has this weekend. Today is the ultimate lazy day. I have found myself watching 4 episodes of Six Feet Under that I rented from Blockbuster. It is a great show if you haven't seen it. I highly recommend it. Fourth of July was really boring. I spent it with one of my friends. We decided to lay low and cook out at her house. I did get to see the fabulous Boston fireworks though when I was driving on the highway to pick up my boyfriend. At any rate, I'm really sleepy today. My tooth is still aching from the root canal and I had too much to drink on Saturday night and I think my body is still trying to recover. I'm pretty content right now though..even though my boyfriend is snoring.. I think I'm gonna have pizza for dinner..Yum! Ahh.. the randomness of this blog is great. I'm a very random person..in case you couldn't tell...Wll anyway hope everyone had a great 4th and will continue to have a great week... ~Bonnie

      So Friday night...lets see...not too much to update. Lets start with the fact that I am in a foul mood which is no good. I hate feeling pissed off. It does more harm than good.... at least thats what I think anyways. I think this whole blogging thing is turning out to be a good thing though..Its nice to be able to just vent and not feel like you are being judged for it. I guess a lot of times I feel that way... Anyhoo..Frustrations....too many to possibly mention right now. I just can't believe the way this week has gone. I think things are beginning to turn around and then blamo something else hits me like a deer in the headlights. I finally have my computer back...of course last night when I went to pick it up at my dads he dropped the freakin power cord so I couldn't even use it after I got it home. Today I bought one though so its all good. Worst of all things was I got in a big fight with my boyfriend tonight. I'm really upset about it so I figured I would just come on here and get it out of my system. We got in a fight over what our plans are for this weekend. Sounds stupid enough right? Well it turned into this whole huge fiasco and he has now gone to sleep not speaking to me which I think is the absolute worst thing that one person can do to another. I feel totally crummy. Maybe this is an overshare but I'm open person. Well I don't want to really talk about it anymore. I need to either go to sleep myself or watch a movie or something to get my mind off it...  Elations-I had dinner at the Texas Roadhouse...pathetic that is the best thing about my day..i know

      Hi everyone!! So here I am...no longer a blogging virgin. Here goes nothing..My name is Bonnie. I'm 25 years old and in my last(hopefully) semester at UMass Boston. I can't wait to get out and figure out what it is that I am going to do for a living. This blog is a perfect way for me to get some sanity from all the craziness going on in my life and vent somethings via frustrations and be excited about other things via elations. I hope you can at least get a kick out of some of the wacky things that happen to me almost daily.    Frustrations- I am taking six courses this summer in order to graduate. Now that sounds bad enough right? Wrong..this past week my computer crashed. I lost almost everything because I hadn't backed anything up. I'm borrowing my dad's laptop at pres moment. Now after that happened on Tuesday night I cracked my front tooth in three places and ended up at the ER in Plymouth. This resulted in me having to have a root canal yesterday $800..ugh! and going to have a crown put on today. Geez..I guess when it rains it really does pour. But thats enough complaining for now. I have had some good things happen too.  Elations-I got a motorcycle last week. Its a cute little red Honda Rebel. I was prompted to buy it after going with my boyfriend, Jon, to Laconia Bike Week in New Hampshire. I've been practicing riding and am going to a motorcycle safety course next week where I will hopefully earn my license. I'm keeping my fingers crossed. I'm also getting ready to go to Florida next month and am getting excited about a fifteen day cruise that I am taking with my mom in the Mediterranean.  Well thats all the time I have for now. I have to run to my lovely dentist appointment. Take Care~Until later...
