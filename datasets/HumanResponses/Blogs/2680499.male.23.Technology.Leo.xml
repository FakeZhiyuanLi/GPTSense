       Everyday is a new day. This is what I would use to comfort myself everytime I overcome a situation. For now, I'm an unemployed fresh graduate. It's been months and yet I have not found a job. But fortunate for me, I am a happy person and I take things easy.   Well, I have said lots of nonsense. Guess I have to make things short. Better stop here before I bored anyone. Chao

       Sorry for not being attending lately. I wasn't really busy, but I just don't feel writing. Yes, Laziness is my biggest disadvantage. But keep the crap aside. Here's a brief report of my situation now.  Yesterday was damn heavy rain. And it almost rained the whole day. Wasn't a good weather! Today's newspaper reported some trees fell down and some even hit on a car, due to the strong wind.   Today, I have moved my PC from the office to the client office. Not that I've quit my programmer post and work for the client, but it isn't any further than this. We (my senior and I), were told to do the support on the client company until we are ready for the maintenance phase, which is still long to go. But we still insisted to comeback for lunch, coz there is only one canteen and the food is no better than here. But now, I'm in my office without a computer. So, I'm not doing anything but using other computers to surf net (provided the com is not in used). Bad for me. I'm a newbie in programming world. But I don't get much the chance to really write out a program on my own hands. Yet, I'm stuck in the project which I have to stay in the client office. How m I going to learn? What a question.

       I wander y I would come here and spend my time writing about my daily life? Well I don't really know. (That was a very lame starting) But yesterday, after work I drove my way to gym. There was no electricity but I still see ppl coming to do their routines. So, I just joined them. Well, lucky enough the electric came to live 30 minutes after. But unlucky enough, it was raining heavily outside. After the gym I had to drive home. But with the sweat I can't switch on the air-con. So I had to drive with my windows closed and without air-con. Along the way, the screen was getting foggy. And I hardly see what's outside. By the time I saw there's a passenger walking, my car had splashed water to him. Poor guys!!  I've been driving all the way until the high way that leads to my house then I remembered there is a selection that I can turn the blower to my screen. So I did. But that was one unlucky day. Even the high way can get trapped into traffic jam. It was 10 minutes to 7, and I had to rush home to get myself ready ~ coz my friend invited me to go watch the chronicle of riddicks. But with that jam, I was afraid I cannot make it. But luckily, I still managed to get home before 7.30. BTW, I had to said that I hate those assholes that drives off the track and tries to get ahead of the traffic. They are the ones that cause more jam.  8.30 pm. My friend came to fetch me. And we went straight to the cinema. Once, meeting each other, there were about 7 of us, we were ready to go into the cinema. Opinions about the movie:  "Mmmm... I think it is quite OK. More actions, just like Vin Diesel's style. Not quite clear about the story line, but they said there is the first part "Pitch Black" that I need to watch to be able to understand what's going on. Overall is OK. I like the actions though"  After movie, I went back and flipping the channels. Last nite the discovery channel is nice. It was about the spontaneous human combustion. Creepy!! then 12.30 my brother finally is back. And we chat for a while then I went to pass out for the nite.  Now thinking of my life, it seems a little boring. I think I need to add some flavour to my life. Maybe I need to be bad or playful. Well I'll think about this. Or maybe I'll be the party goer everynite. God knows.

       Finally, I'm back again. Pass few days, I've nothing much to write. So, today doesn't mean I have much to write too. Well, today my boss is on holiday, so we are a bit freer (if there is such word) to spend time on here and there. Hmm hmm...  Yesterday, I was walking down the stairs with my colleagues. We were on our way to lunch. Unfortunately, I somehow slipped down the stairs. Gosh!! That's embarrassing, I think. But luckily I did not hurt anywhere. Except, maybe a little on my butt. But that doesn't matter.  As I wish to get slim day by day. I eventually had gone down on my waistline, by doing lots of exercises and food control if u would like to know. I think my weight gets lighter too. But I seem to have this problem that frust me everytime. I don't really want to say this but, I'm not sure if this is called constipation. Coz I really didn't go to the loo for big for few days, but when it comes I can go smoothly. With no "brutal force"!! But what distracts me is that everynight I looked at the mirror. My waist is like expanded a little after dinner + not sitting in the loo. I'm so unhappy with that. Wander if there is a solution with that.  Btw, these days the temperature is rising. Well, I can't really tell if it is rising or not. But all I know is that, I have consumed so many water but still feel the heat in me. That's not rite. Can u imagine finishing one whole bottle of mineral water in just the morning? Well I did that. And its consequence is I go to pee every 15 minutes. I knew that when one has diabetes will have this problem. But my sugar intake is low so I don't think its that. Or maybe it could be hypertension? I've been thinking of these possibilities. But, I still can't be sure of it. My lips are always dry, I'm always thirsty, but I don't sweat a lot, except for sports... I even think of I did not shit for days could be the cause of abnormal water level of my body.  Jeez.... Why would I post something like this today. Must be something went wrong in my head. gotta fix it.. Chao!!!  P.S. my brother is coming back today. With my com =)

       Today its a little early to post up this blog. But I've two days to report. Last two days, I've been to Tawau (a district in Sabah, Malaysia) for some business octane. My colleague from that district came to fetch me. It was an early flight (6.10am) though, I had to wake up at 4.45 am and get myself ready to the airport. So, I was all the way dizzy and half unconscious in the car as my poor mother was the one to send me to the airport. But as I was in the air plane. I was awake for the first 15 minutes, partly because I wanted to taste the drink. But what excited me the most is the beautiful sky. I've been traveling to few places by flight in my life but never seen such scenery before. The clouds are thin and layered nicely. Through the layers of cloud u still can see the main land of Borneo. It's as if The land is covered in mist. Some clouds even moving driftly, just like in some movies that shown the scenery of the moving clouds. But I still couldn't stand the greed of more sleeps so I crashed into dreamy land.  Well, it took only about another 15 minutes to reach Tawau. As well as we met(my colleague and I) we drove our way up to Semporna(another district that's nearby Tawau). That's about an hour distance on the road. On the way, I see lots of palm trees, cocoa and all sorts god I don't know what. As we go, he told me some of the interesting information of the places, like there's lots of crocs in the river and bla bla....  As we finally reach there, we did our work and it was about an hour or a little bit more that we have done everything we need to do. So we were good and ready to leave. But before we headed our trip, he brought me to the nearby rest house, which is placed at the sea side. It was beautiful, we saw some nice sea creatures. We even saw some squids swimming around. Then he told me it takes about 2 hours of boat to reach Sipadan Island from there, What a place that everyone wishes to go.  On that day, we have done 2 districts, which the other district has nothing much to tell, so I'll save time for that. We then headed back to Tawau, and look for hotels for me to settle down for that nite. We finally found one and checked in. Then we said good bye for that day.   It is boring doing nothing in the hotel, I went to the nearby supermarket to buy some drinks and had my dinner right after. Then I headed back to my room and try to watch some crappy movies. Thanks to my colleague, who told me the day before I came, that at nite someone may come to knock on the door and sell some extra services. At that very boring moment, I suddenly had his bad influence infected my mind. I was suddenly waiting to expect for someone to knock. God knows if the price is right, I might have done something silly. But that was a silent nite. Except for the sound of rains at the late nite and some opening and closing of doors. I first was hoping that I could hear something from the next rooms but then that thought faded out and my mind goes blur and so I crashed.  Till the next morning, I was still imagining scenes that may happen when someone knocked on my door.   Hehe..... Bad thoughts!!! I then clean myself up and get ready to meet my colleague again. That morning, he brought me to one coffee shop which sells "instant noodles". The food was delicious, and I can't help loving the "Sotong cake", I don't really know how to put this but I think they meshed the squid and deep fried with flour or potato~I can't tell. All I know its nice. After the breakfast, we went to the client's office in Tawau to start the work of the day. Damn unluckily, there wasn't any electricity. My job deals a lot with electric and yet there is no electric.... Bad day!!! We then waited... And waited... Still not coming then we went to one of my friends shop and took our time to read some newspaper. Time passes slowly, and we had to wait until 2 O'clock in the afternoon. We went back still the place looked dark from outside. But thank god, at least the current came, not fully but at least I was able to switch on the server and do my maintenance. Then we worked as fast as we could, and we were ready to go at 5 minutes to four.  On the way to the airport from the town took about 45 minutes. So, we have plenty of time since my flight is  pm and we started our journey at 4. We had some chat and some orders then we depart at the airport. Nothing special after that. So the story ends here. Today, I have some more works to do, but I've also spent some times on this blog. So, enjoy!!!  Adios.

       Wow!! Last Saturday, I was working in the office for half day. That day, someone in our office had a small celebration. We had a piece of cake each. And the birthday boy offered each of us a drink. Well that day, I did not get the drink coz we have to collect ourselves at his sisters stall. So my colleague and I got it today after lunch.  But what's important to tell is, I went windsurfing on that Saturday. It was very fun although I'm kind of suck at it. At least I did not fall as much as I did the first time. But I can't seem to control the direction. I happened to surf my way to the village close by the surfing point. Bad, bad, bad.... That was no good until one of the workers of the water sport center came to collect my sail and we head back to the center by walking cross the sea. I felt sorry for that guy for troubling him. And that's the end of my windsurfing experience.  Sunday has nothing much happened. As usual, I went out for breakfast with my mom and we went to buy some sundries. However, on that day my grandmother came down from other district and said wanted to visit one of my aunt's house, which she just moved in. So we brought her there. The housing area is still quite new. Many houses are still under renovation.   When I stepped into my aunts house I think it's nice. Everything is designed and decorated nicely. Then we visited the whole house. Everything is just fine and comfortable to live. I wish my house could be like this. Too bad I'm not a very good descriptor, or else I'll tell you how nice it is to be there.  Guess I have to stop here. Nothing much happen today. Just many people have asked me to bring something for them for another colleague in other district. By the way, I'll not be here for two days from tomorrow. Going outstation until Wednesday. So I'll be back to this blog on Thursday. See ya!!

       Well, it's another day here. Today I've been a little quite busy. I went out to the client's office this morning just to update some applications. But never noticing that of all the departments I've never done any updates to one of the department where they really need to use the system. Yet the worse part is that they don't even know who I am and where I'm from... Duh!!!  Then I tried to update for them. God knows that after the first workstation I've updated, the rest were not working at all. Seems like the network is not working at all and not a single have noticed. Besides, I always thought that leaving the PC not doing anything and causes the keyboard get dusty is just a myth. But, today I finally can tell that it's not a myth anymore. Somemore that is in an air-con room!! How could that be possible? I really wonder how long it took to stay the dust on the keyboard until that I could feel eeky about.  Then that morning is over, my job there seems done ~ since I couldn't do anything due to the network failure. Back to the office, I've done nothing much. My computer got hanged a few times, I watched a little "Happy Tree Friends" and here filling my blog. Now I'll be enhancing the system's reports. So lets get busy now..  Chao!!

       Today is just as normal as usual. Nothing happened and life is so peaceful. Well, accept for callings from my client which keeps complaining their workstation can't get into the network. To make things worse, they put the blame on us by saying after the last time we went for maintenance ~ which is last week ~ the whole wresting in the office can't connect to the network. But I don't recall meeting any problems when I was there. Weird!   Therefore, now I have to make a replacement server for them. But strange thing is, the Windows NT is not working probably. It doesn't respond to my first press on the keyboard, but works for the second press. I wanted to blame on the keyboard is lousy but I don't think it is. Pathetic! And because it acted so strangely, which causes I keep pressing the wrong thing so now I've thought of a way to overcome this problem ~ Just press once then press on the arrow left key, which is not used for any purpose in the installation. ;)  Well things got worse now, I just had to press 3 times to get the button function. What the heck!!! Do I have to do this all the way till the installation is complete?? That is killing....   That's all I have to talk for now or else I'll never finish installing that stupid stuff. Later I have to install the Oracle. Just hope It will not do the same thing to me =(   Bye!!

       Working life is never easier.... Well I've found a job and work as a programmer here. But there's nothing much to do for the moment. Just had my lunch and felt so sleepy that I don't feel working. But I can't do that, or else my boss could have fired me and left me jobless. =D   luckily enough, I've got this blog to fill in to pass time. After having left this blog far behind I finally return. After seeing my friends blog is on the web I then remembered that I have one myself to fill... Well let us all hope that I'll be persistent and have more interesting stories to come.   Gotta work now, so that's it. Bye!!
