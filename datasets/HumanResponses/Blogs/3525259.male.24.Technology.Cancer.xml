      I can probably count the amount of "hot" teachers I had when I was a student on one hand. There was one in high school named Ms. Van Howe... but if I met her in a bar today I would probably say something to the tune of "ya she's kinda cute...for a mom." Then there was this fucking bitch of a philosophy teacher at Emory. She was hot like Uma Thurman in Pulp Fiction...that weird haircut with bangs in front. She was such a bitch that every guy in the class wanted to either get medieval on her ass or not get on her ass at all. Thats it...2 hot teachers.  Nowadays since most of us are in the workin world, we know plenty of people our age who are teachers. I mean in georgia you dont even need a master's, you can teach for full salary while you earn it at night classes. So naturally there are some really hot really young teachers coming out of colleges these days.  This is the  urlLink hottest thing I have heard in awhile . A sexually frustrated teacher who did the following: fucked her student at school, fucked her student in her car, and blew her student twice in the classroom. The kid was only 14. She is only 23.       Now I know some of you might think that this is NOT the hottest thing youve ever heard. Some might even go as far as saying it is nasty, sexual deviance, lascivious and lude behavior. But guess what? There are these things called double standards in America and whether you like it or not, this happens to be one of them.  It would be disgusting for a 23 year old guy (me) to fuck a 14 year old student. Dude, that is fucking gross. But the 14 year old guy who is fucking the 23 year old teacher? God damn man, way to take down the mark. You wont get it that good for another 7 years buddy, hope you enjoyed your time.  I think David Lee Roth really encapsulates the feelings of all men who are silently cheering on this young 14 year old walking rite of passage when he says: "I think of all the education that I missed/But then my homework was never quite like this."   Anyone who has ever seen The Graduate, ever downloaded porn from myfirstsexteacher.com, seen Geri Ryan on Boston Public, or has dreams of Ms. Veronica Vaughn late at night knows that there is no fucking big deal about this hot little vixen fucking her student. All she needs is a million dollar playboy pictorial and she can retire and fuck all the little boys she wants. Im sure Katz can point her in the right direction...

      So I was up late last night thinking about how badly I wanted to just fall asleep, when a random thought occurred to me. One of my ex-roommates is still a virgin and is waiting until marriage to release his seed. Not Opdyke, lord knows he's had his shmeckle in more holes than a wheel of swiss cheese. Not Katz because well....katz fucks. Nickdaddy has not had sex and by default has had very few girls over. So what happens when you're a virgin and you finally get married and you get your shit done in 3 minutes and then you want to pass out with the wifey? Youve really never slept intimately with a girl at all... you dont even know what a spoon position is.  What if your new wifey likes to wake up at 6 am to feed the dog and water her marigolds before she runs 10 miles and throws in a load of laundry? That shit would not be cool at my spot... on the weekends i usually dont wake up before my noon sportsbook.com frenzy time.  Here is a factual excerpt from ( urlLink article ): "One of the main effects of conflicting body clocks is loneliness-a partner waiting for the other to surface, or sitting alone into the early hours while the other half of the relationship sleeps. Up to a third of the day can be lost: The urge for love making is mistimed, there is less chance to share problems and opportunities to relax disappear."  AGAINST my better judgement, I read a 10-page article on redbook.com about the different positions of sleeping with another lady friend. (I would also like to say that I was right about these women magazines, they truly do NOT undestand men in their "what men want" articles) Here are the positions of sleep I am most fond of.        The spoon position is classic.... it allows for maximum touching while also giving time to sleep a reasonable amount of peaceful hours at night. Also, waking up in spoon position encourages morning sex.       The tangled up in you position is kinda one of those things you do after some really dank pass out sex. You clearly have to like the person, as well as their morning breath...but dont expect to sleep much using this one.       The cradle position is that cute cuddly thing where you just want to go to bed and dream happy shit. This one is recommended if you just want to have some sweet dreams. Pink sheets are not mandatory.       The Reverse Spoon. Ahhhh, my favorite position. Thats right, I am a needy little bitch who needs to be spooned and not the other way around. Hey, at least it gives the lady a feeling of empowerment right....and you know i am all for that.     Regardless of how you and your partner(s) decide to sleep, the one thing to keep in mind is to DEFINITELY sleep with as many people as possible. Its the only way you will truly find someone who meshes well with your sleeping habits. When youre sleeping well together, lines of communication will be open for many more things. Like anal. Definitely.

      The two worst words in the english language. moving day. Since I have been in Atlanta, I have had to endure 11 moving days.  Louisville --> Freshman Dorm Freshman Dorm --> Louisville Louisville --> Frat House Frat House --> Arbor Hills Arbor Hills --> Frat House Frat House --> Caliber Woods Caliber Woods --> Frat House Frat House --> Arbor Hills Arbor Hills --> Arbor Gates Arbor Gates --> Gables Montclair Gables Montclair --> Virginia Avenue House  10/11 of these moving days were done using friends, a uhaul truck, or some other form of do-it-yourself option where I had to lift chairs, boxes, desks, all that shit... tons of shit every time. FINALLY i wised up and paid for 3 movers to come help me move out. Now, I dont have a ton of shit.... i actually have never really had to buy furniture sets besides my bedroom stuff. I could have done it myself, it would have been slightly cheaper. But the reason I agreed to get movers is because I would have to move my shit plus Katzs shit and who the hell wants to endure that misery again. (our old place had 3 flights of windy stairs)  So the movers show up at 9 am on sunday...stellar. rainy weather, this is getting so much better. here is what they basically look like:

      Yo, thank god its friday. i only have to live at my current location for 2 more days.  So recently it was father's day... a time to tell your dad, or dads as the case may be, that you love them very much and here is a little gift to show my appreciation. Now, I am a daddys boy, mainly because my mother is kind of a big bitch, but mostly because he is a sensible guy, doesnt put unwarranted pressure on me, and overall understands most of the shit going on in my life. i got him a card this year.. i mean not like i have no money, i just think giving gifts outside the normal realm of birthday is insanity.  So I made a little list of all the different kinds of random gift giving situations i could think of.  The best thing in the whole world is called "spoils of war" gifts. Once you break up with someone you loved or were real close with, this is the shit you gained after being with her that you now have full access rights to claim as your own. Could be a birthday gift, could be clothes, could be a poker table... all you know is you didnt have it going into the relationship but you love having it coming out afterwards.  Another type of gift is called the "double whammy" gift. We all know someone who has a birthday on or right around another holiday. Like July 4th, Christmas, mothers day AND their birthday. fucking double whammy. the question is, are you supposed to double the price of one gift, give two average gifts, or give one and just say fuck it, you know you're the fucking double whammy in the group bitch.       I know there are some people out there who give gifts ANYTIME they come back from vacation, a few weeks away, the gas station.... basically they are like trinket hunters and all they do is roll around to shops and if they see anything, regardless of cost or tackiness level, purchase in the hopes of bringing a mini smile to their friend's face. Trinkets are overrated. They are the worst kind of gift because they are usually completely useless and worse, impulse buys being passed off as thoughtfulness.  I have one pro and one con for the wonderful jewish concept of gift giving. Check this out...when I was 13, i had one of the fattest bar mitzvah parties for all my goysha (and non goysha) friends. Even though my parents foot the bill, since a bar mitzvah is becoming a man, people shelled out a ton of shit to congratulate me on a job well done. $6000 in tvs, a new bed, clothes, cash, and other prizes is a fucking dream come true to a 13 year old kid. one of the highlights of my life. good work jews, i like the tradition.  But for every Yin there is a Yang and for every good jewish gift there has to be a downside. And that downside is realized in the concept of Hannukka. 8 fucking days! are you kidding?? sure its great when youre a kid... but once you have kids its like a self-sentencing of 8 presents a year for 20 years. 8 times the long lines during holiday season. 8 times per year you have to think of the things your kid wants. sounds like misery to me but i guess thats why i dont have kids yet.  Finally, Re-gifting is a concept that was made popular on the sitcom Seinfeld. It may seem far fetched, but this shit goes down ALL THE TIME. Say a tragedy were to enter into a family. Someone is sick and friends, family, community members, coworkers, etc all send gifts to wish the person well. No matter what, there are going to be some repeaters in the pile of gifts.... 8 copies of the DaVinci Code, 4 wheels of cheese, 23 candles, and of course an overwhelming amount of product from bed bath and beyond. Of course you dont need all this, so you figure you take it to the store and return it for credit when you need a refill on your apricot mango aloe vera vitamin D ball scrub. Seems sensible--but some families out there just re-gift the shit that someone gave you to someone else. Its tasteless and morally objectionable and i love it.  Have a good weekend! See you on Monday.  oh and ps-- if you havent gotten your ass pounding for the day, you might want to head out to this little  urlLink festival happening in atl .

      Yo, I come from a town that has zero professional sports teams. None. Do you know what that shit is like as a kid? With that in mind, college sports are GOD and professional sports are 2nd tier to me. I mean dont get me wrong, Vicklanta is going to the super bowl this year, and I am going to be hyped because i called that shit early, but I could give a fuck about pro sports other than NFL. Especially NBA. NBA basketball can eat a fat one.  In Atlanta, there is zero support for the NBA team here. I mean, with a stunning 28W-54L season, a losing road and home record, and the only good player Jason Terry hitting right around 40% of his shots, our team needs some serious fucking draft if they want to even think about cracking the top half of their division. The only way they could sell season tix last year was to package them with popular teams who came here.  urlLink Go Hawks !  But my beef is not with the Hawks. My beef is with the NBA Dream Team. In the old days, only college ballers were allowed to compete in the  urlLink Olympic Games for basketball . Although the scores were somewhat pitiful early on, the USA won straight gold from 1936-1976. skipped 1980. lost one in 1988. Then all the rules changed....just when another country (namely Russia) had taken out the USA's historical run on gold, we switched up the rules so that all players, professional and college, could play in the olympics.  Check out this roster for the 1992 dream team: Charles Barkley, Larry Bird, Clyde Drexler, Patrick Ewing, Earvin Johnson, Michael Jordan, Christian Laettner, Karl Malone, Chris Mullin, Scottie Pippen, David Robinson, and John Stockton. Now I dont know shit about NBA, but I do know that these guys were the fucking all stars in 1992.  Fast forward to present day Olympics games. 2004 Olympics being held in the original homeland, the mecca of Olympic sports, athens greece. The world is in a fray, war torn, and threat of terrorist activity on the rise in foreign countries. Big name events are all considered targets...especially with the olympics violent history of kidnappings, bombings, etc. 12 years prior, NBA stars werent even asked to compete in the worlds greatest games. If you ask me, admitting the NBA into the olympics was the worst move ever.  Sure, it was awesome that the entire country supported the baddest ass players from the NBA. I think its a sick team and its awesome that they kicked everyones ass. But with even a hint of danger, which of course is all suspect, NBA players are dropping like flies from the Olympics.  Here is a list of the original 2004 Paycheck Players team: Ray Allen, Tim Duncan, Jason Kidd, Tracy McGrady, Mike Bibby, Karl Malone, Kobe Bryant, Allen Iverson, Jermaine O'Neal. Of these nine, only 2 are left...AI and Duncan. Since then, all other players have dropped out for one excuse or another. Citing terrorist concerns is a fucking cop out and they know it. How fucking greedy are these guys that they cant do something for honor instead of the dollar? After more rounds of invites, even more NBA players declined the nomination. Shaq, Richard Hamilton, Ben Wallace, KG, Vince Carter...the list goes on and on.   urlLink story1    urlLink story2    The Notorious BIG once said: "Either you're slingin' crack-rock, or you've got a wicked jump-shot. Nobody wants to work for it anymore. There's no honor in taking that after school job at Mickey Dee's, honor's in the dollar, kid."  I have no idea how this is pertinent, but the point is, the idea of a dream team died in the 90s. There is no honor in backing down from a challenge so you can eek out a few more mil in the safe confines of the USA. Go to the olympic games and show the world we can still ball like the bad boys of old. pussies.

      You've heard all the terms: pothead, hippie, stoner, cokehead, pusher, popper. These names are just a label used to identify drug behavior of an individual. They are commonplace, generic, everyones doing it...whats the big deal. But I swear to god, out of all the hundreds of potheads i have met, none of them can even come close to the vicinity of the one, the true, and the only: Crackie.  Crackie, as I am labelling her for I have no basis of determining her real name, is my friend Dwellis's neighbor. Let me just give you a little run down of what Crackie looks like. 5'6. brown straight hair, some gray. absolutely no teeth. wrinkled skin makes me think she could be an old 45 or a really old 35. her lip skin is kinda stretched over her mouth since there is no teeth support. oh, one more thing, she looooooooves crack.       Crackie, by profession, is a lawn mower. For $20 she will do the front and the back yard and bag all the nasty clippings. She doesnt really have a business card, I mean this is just a neighborly thing that she is doing as a service. The only problem is, when she comes over the first time and says she will do your lawn for $20 you think its an awesome deal. Little do you know that a week later Crackie is going to need some money and will want to mow your shit again. and again. and again.  Ya see Crackie says she is dyslexic. I would venture to say its probably more 50% having a georgia education and 50% because you are always high as shit on crack, you cracka ass crackie. Because of her condition, she cant write or read, ergo she cant make a lawn mowing calendar, ergo she doesnt ever remember when she mowed the lawn last. Wow. that must be some good ass pcp.  One time Crackie came over and asked dave for 3 dollars. 3 dollars? Her mom was in a bad, bad accident and she doesnt have a car and needed a ride to the hospital and had to pay for gas. I'm sorry but 3 dollars is a fucking joke. I am probably being insensitive and shit, but I think that its fucking crazy that you have so little money and so little worth that you are grinding out 3 dollars by lying to people, manipulating, looking sad, and of course mumbling since you have no teeth.  The only way to get rid of Crackie is to send her to a place where all her friends can have tons of fun, do whatever they want, and have no inhibitions...at least for about 4 hours.

      Yo, this story sucks. I cannot think of a good ending. That is why I dont write short stories. I figured I didnt want to just drop the audience, but i need to scrap this and write something funnier. ===(one excerpt from the scrap heap)=== &clubs;"Hey main, dis here taco is one of the tastiest tacos i have ever eaten main," quipped Sergio. &spades;"Youre right ese, Carla really does something to make her tacos taste real good. &iquest;How does she do it main?" asked Hector. &clubs;"I dont know main, but I wouldn't mind an extra side of sour cream if you know what i'm saying ese." &spades;"Dig it" concluded Hector. =======================================

      (today is a bad hair day. ha ha, what kind of man says that? one with curly ix bitch-- thats who)  Welcome back to Sergio...we now continue with some background. Sergio Hernandez, born Paco Anton&iacute;a Ch&aacute;vez, was born in Cuba in 1972. Forget the fact that he is 32 and hanging out with 23 year olds....not pertinent to the story. Paco was a violent, stir crazy little cuban baby boy. His father was a revolutionary fighting for rights in Havana. His mother was a dirty dirty whore, who scrapped the rent check on selling her cuban destinos to sick perverse american men who thrived on foreign chicks. Paco loathed this behavior and vowed that his mother would suffer for her disobedience and mistrust.  One day, a great Cuban revolutionary was struck down in the capital. The other soldados took leave and returned to their casas for some good rest and a little side of pooont&aacute;ng se&ntilde;or hand. As Paco's father ascended the stairs, he heard loud banging noises coming from the bedroom. Taking two at a time he slammed into the door and was bewildered at what he saw.   Paco standing over his mother and her customer-- bludgeoned to death. NOOOO!! paco's father shouted. WHY DID YOU DO THIS PACO? she dishonored your honor papa. CALL THE POLICE. and with that, paco raised his axe, jumped off the bed towards his stunned father, and chunked him right at the throat.       Paco now vowed he would never be disrespected again. He joined Tony Mont&aacute;na and his gang of Miami hoodlums as an 8 year old. He was street born, street trained, and street deadly. He snorted coke like it was going out of style. He changed his name to Sergio Hernandez to lose the connection to his murdered family back home. Finally, in 1995, Sergio was brought up in the ranks. He would get a new Chevy, a new set of threads, and his own tanning salon to run numbers and bags out of to earn a living.       When Sergio came to Atlanta, he had options of buying a nice house out in the suburbs. He was backed by cash in Miami and had no problems. Instead, Sergio decided to open up shop on Buford Highway. His tanning salon business would be secure in the dirtiest mexican part of town. Although Sergio had plenty of bonitas to choose from, he had other desires. He wanted white chicks. He wanted to do some freaky, freaky deaky dutch bastard crazy shit to white girls. And so he met his mark one day, at Lenox Mall. She was gabbing in her cell phone to all her deephs. He was awestruck. this white girl is my white girl now.  (Sergio Part 3: The Long Voyage Home, will continue tomorrow)

      Welcome back to work everyone. Here is a short story:  "Oh Man this bowl is sooo worth it," I say to myself, as i double fist a bubble and roll two joints for the night. I had just received the wake up call, 10:30 pm sharp, get your ass showered, get crunk, because we are going out tonight. "Where to?" I say. Meet us at Hand in Hand, then we're going to Clairemont Lounge. "Oh..its gonna be one of those nights." fire up again. get into car. peace.  line at hand in hand. lines lines, always lines. get in. hear my name being yelled at extremely high pitch and volume. SHUSTER! wow. need ya at a 2. shake hands with new people, get one of those teaser lap dances that girls like to do. get up and go to bar for drinks. one of these kinda nights calls for a shot of jack and a jack and coke. finish. go to clairemont lounge. driving, smoke joint #2.  pay cover. 10 bucks. i'm buck and i like to fuck. clairemont lounge is seedy as hell. let me set it up for you. RED lights cover most of the ceiling, except in the 8x8 dance floor area...that is dark and strobe lighty. full stocked bar, good drink prices. DJ spins house and funk and trip hop (is that a genre, because it should be). Lots of mini tables and seats in the back to chill, smoke a bliz, brown nose some hoes. Crowd... a mix, a great wide crazy mix. lots of white kids who just want to dance. lots of black chicks who came with their nuggas. lots of single black men dressed like archbishop don "magic" juan.        lotta pimps, lookin for fine jewish girls who tease too much and drink too much yack. the best part, STRIPPERS. but not just any strippers. strippers with the spam bursting from the can. strippers whose last meal was an entire other human being. thats right byatches, clairemont lounge is home to the fucking nastiest strippers alive. but theyre doin what they love, gotta give love to that. ( urlLink read 1st paragraph , google.com claremont lounge if you want more)  so i am chillin at claremont lounge with some yatches. happy birthday. is head mandatory on girls for their birthdays too? katz take that one down for me will ya. anyway. drinking. dancing. avoiding eye contact with blondie and other such messes. i am in a haze. my sober driver FUCKED ME OVER (sorta not really) and left. so now i had to figure out a way to get home. stumbling, mumbling, we roll to late night pizza. no za for me, just more cigarettes. and a diet coke. loud screaming ensues. out of towners bitch about no new york pizza. if we were in new york, this pizza would have been ready as soon as we got here. if we were in new york, it wouldnt be taking a half hour. if we were in new york--Shut the fuck up, this is atlanta. chill with that prada bcbg shit, byatch.  finally, pizza comes. i find out they have called a friend to come pick us up. We wait outside. Hoopty chevy rolls up to curb. i am way faded at this point. mexican 30 year old sketchy man looks up at my face and says: Get In.  (to be continued.....Sergio Part 2)

      Well, the weekend is (finally) here and I am definitely stoked for the high octane activity that will be going down this weekend. First off, me and my roomie jonny mcpot found a dank place in the highlands to live next year. It is within walking distance to every bar we frequent, with options of cab fare under 5 bucks for most. For the out of towners, the best thing about most of these places is that they have outdoor patios. Yo fucks, you wanna walk over to moes and grab some pbr? yo smokey mcfucks, you wanna go not talk to girls at neighbors tonight? hi jon, sometimes when i am all alone at night, i sit on my hand and then masturbate...its called a stranger jon, have you ever given yourself a stranger? whaaaaat?  urlLink I even drew a map .  So that should be pretty fun for the next year. If anyone knows any good decorators, i am toootally looking for one. that would be suuuper.   So this weekend...well friday, tonight, i plan on getting ridiculously fucked up on some of that white widow mixed in with a little bog bubble. roll up about 4 fatties. haul a few shots of goldschlager mixed in with some jack and cokes. catch MARTA. go to see olympic torch. use torch to light up j's. if cowboy mouth were a high school superlative, they would be "Band Most Likely to Get Every Single Person in the Crowd Crazy Jumping Dancing Singing Along" award.  Tomorrow I have no idea whats in store, but I have a feeling it wont matter until about 5 pm anyway... maybe just puke around 6 am. and 8 am. and then go to the pool and pass out until mid day. drink lots of water, take lots of vitamins, and be prepared to not get any numbers on saturday, just take em home to the pad.  I am really bored at work and feeling so braindead via dwellis and his little hobby that i cannot function in a funny clear mode right now. So one last F-U.  Fuck you louisville. You only have one really cool event all year long, the kentucky derby. runner up is of course reggae fest. all of a sudden, i hear from chiu that there is a 3rd activity that (quite possibly) could make a swift run for 2nd place and give the derby a run for its money? Imagine, ANOTHER thing coming out of ky thats cool?  urlLink Its true, and I wish so bad I could be in two places at once .  Have a sweet weekend. See ya back in the office on Monday, byatch.

      Have you ever noticed that no matter how perfect a relationship you have with a girl is, at the drop of a hat you can say one wrong thing and totally fuck yourself over. I know it has happened to any guy... its like you dont want to be watching every thing you say, but some things guys say just do not sit well with girls.  Perhaps the greatest example of this is if a girl asks you a question about her outfit, her hair, if she looks fat, etc etc. Guys cannot stand these fucking questions... we know there is rarely a right answer and that anything dumb we blurt out fucks us for that night. Girls, here is a wake up call. Guys rarely notice the little intricacies you pick at yourself about. I mean, if you are wearing a hot black skirt then by all means, the guy should be forthcoming with compliments... but the little things, the shit you all notice that we could give a fuck about, we could give a fuck about so dont ask.  Guys hate capri pants. Stop wearing capri pants. They are only cute to you and your girlfriends. If your purpose is to impress a guy, do not wear capri pants.       (most) guys hate 80s music. for me, even the mention of going to an 80s night or an 80s party makes me cringe and throw up in my mouth a little bit. because for as many huey lewis and the news and warrant songs as they are going to play, there will be an exponentially larger amount of madonna/cindi lauper shit bubble gum shit music.   If you are a shitty driver, a slower than normal driver, an accident prone driver, or a frequent asker of driving questions while driving, guys are hesitant to step foot in your car. Please ask daddy how to drive a car the right way if you dont know. or just hire me, i will show you my boston-esque skills.  Guys hate Dirty Dancing/Pretty Woman/Princess Bride types of movies. Please dont make us watch those.   I guess the last thing i should say is, guys hate seeing the magazines in the grocery store aisle that say: "50 Things that are Guaranteed to Keep Your Man Happy" First, you know that the magazine is written by mostly women. the list was probably compiled by mostly women, and mostly women were asked their opinion. DOES THIS MAKE ANY FUCKING SENSE? Maxim Magazine aka  urlLink The Bible  has the real articles about what real men really want. Dont consult a womens magazine about guy shit.

      With the odds stacked against them, through segregation, discrimination, and a general disrespect for black men in this country, many have survived and made a successful living in America. Some black guys have reached super stardom and became very very rich. But where there is a rich black man, there is usually a group of white men who figure out a way to make the rich black man suffer for becoming so god damned rich.  (I had made a list of the top 10 examples of this and was going to comment, but now I realize Mike Tyson is just too easy....)  #10-- Mike Tyson #9-- Suge Knight #8-- Ray Lewis  #7-- James Brown   #6-- Puff Daddy #5-- Snoop Doggy Dogg #4-- Kobe Bryant #3-- R. Kelly #2-- OJ Simpson #1-- Michael Jackson  ( urlLink audio1 ) ( urlLink audio2 )     When the name Mike Tyson is ever dropped, the first thing i do is laugh, snicker a little. I mean, I feel like most of America is with me that Mike Tyson is a fucking joke. But lets put that aside for one second... my first memory of the name Mike Tyson came from a Nintendo game. Glass joe, king hippo, Don Flamenco, and other such characters were on a long path to Mike Tyson, the cartoon wonderboy-fighter that could knock you down in a single shot. This guy was a badass and that stuck in my mind.   Flash forward to Feb 1988: Mike Tyson weds actress Robin Givens in New York . God damn! that is the hot girl, ya know, the one from whats that movie called? Who cares... point is Mike Tyson beat the shit out of this chick on several occasions, enough for her to file for divorce and peace out. If Mike Tyson can knock Little Joe down with one punch, imagine a hot model actress with a tiny little frame. Damn, thass fuddup. ps--this was 4 months into the marriage.  All of a sudden, no more Mikey. No one knew where he went, but Duck Tales and Final Fantasy II were coming out and no one bothered to ask. Then again, 3 years later, out of nowhere:  18 Jul 1991 In his hotel room, boxer Mike Tyson rapes Desiree Washington, a Miss Black America contestant . Damn man, is wayne brady gonna have to choke a bitch? what the hell is wrong with you dude? Hitting and raping are not cool, even if you talk like a little bitch, byatch.  From there it is just a downward spiral. 6 years of prison, served 3. Bit a man's ear off. motorcycle crash. bar fight. arrest. knocks out a ref.    2002 speech : (note to media, dont give Tyson a mic, ever. ever ever.) "I'm just like you. I enjoy the forbidden fruits in life, too. I think it's un-American not to go out with a woman, not to be with a beautiful woman, not to get my dick sucked ... It's just what I said before, everybody in this country is a big fucking liar...."   2003 : Files for bankruptcy.    Damn the man, Damn the man .

      Ha-mmer! Ha-mmer! Ha-mmer! Ahh yes, the shouts and cries for one of America's worst pop culture mistakes ever. When Hammer took the stage that night, everyone in the arena knew every word to every song. When he sang "Have You Seen Her" large black women stood on their seats and screamed for  urlLink Stanley Kirk Burrell  to take them away from Louisville, KY and onto a wild circus act of a concert that ended in 18 million dollars of debt. Thats right everyone, my first concert ever was that of MC Hammer in 1991. But i was just 11, a small boy who knew nothing of the wonders of good rock and roll...  (Interesting sidenote to this story is my 2nd concert was when i was 13, 6th row, front and center to smashing pumpkins siamese dream tour...now that was the shit)          This weekend, in Podunk, Tennessee, was the music festival Bonnaroo. I couldnt make it, but i didnt really want to make it either... mudflinging and endless hits of acid in the 90 degree heat trapped in a crowd of yuppie college kids trying to fake being hippies doesnt really interest me. I do not have creative rights to this, but i heard an ad slogan on the radio this morning:  urlLink Bonnaroo-- 80,000 people, 60,000 range rovers . That pretty much sums it up for me....NO INTEREST. But only 2 people died out of 80,000 which (i guess?) is a positive thing right?  One of the little "icing on the cake" reasons i came to atlanta was because there would be a lot more concert events, seeing as how this is a real city compared to my small village back home. my first year here i went to 4 shows, one weekend was Pearl Jam Friday and Beastie Boys Saturday. Vicklanta has this thing called  urlLink Music Midtown  and although the past 2 years have sucked, it has usually been an amazing event for $40 and 3 days of music, drinking, token, and of course little high school girls who need beer from sketchy 21 year old guys.  But my favorite concerts of all time have definitely been Counting Crows shows. Ya ya, Chiu calls them a bunch of whiny bitches. But wouldnt you be whining about life if you had fucked Jennifer Aniston and Courtney Cox and then they peaced out on you?!? (ps-- fuck brad pitt) I have probably seen 5 or 6 counting crows shows and although i dont remember them all distinctly, i had a kickass time at all 5 or 6. one time i even lost my car, dude. As fate would have it, my favorite band is coming to atlanta one last time before they end their 4 year tour.  urlLink my favorite band on my favorite day, my birthday ! i am stoked, i got some lawn seats... hopefully take a little honey out there, sip on some shit (you can bring wine, champagne, whatev), maybe get some birthday head. head is mandatory on birthdays, right?  Anyway, if you feel like actually COMMENTING when you read my shit, stories of concerts would be most appreciated. Its always funny to laugh at those. Peace! g-g-g-g-g gggg unit.

      So I have seen a bunch of movies this past week...  urlLink you can see why . ================================== The Day After Tomorrow-- The plot of this movie is that the world is on the brink of a major ice age and the only person who can save millions is Dennis Quaid. Now, I dont know how you all feel but I think Mr. Quaid should have halted all Hollywood appearances after  urlLink his best movie to date . The movie has awesome special effects, dont get me wrong... it just seems like the director's previous movie independence day, except the aliens have been replaced by a worldwide snow storm. happy ending, son finds dad, son and dad find mom, everyone is happy. The world will go on. Bleh.  Harry Twatter and the Prisoner of Uzbekistan-- Call me a child, call me a loser, but i like this movie and the other two movies. Everyone is saying this one is darker... the only thing dark here is Hermayane's british unibrow. Damn, girl needs to get that shit tweezed. And could ronald grow some balls and try to stick that girl? I mean, when they are home in england from hogwarts and cant practice magic, thats cool... kick game with the mortal chicks. blame it on area codes. but dude, when you have a million spells and a chick that sweats your nuts pretty bad, youve got to give her the spitting dragon.        Raising Helen-- I actually havent seen this one, but I would just like to shout out to Kate Hudson. god damn, you are one of the hottest girls ever. please dump your loser husband so he can return to his failing music career and we can ride out your sugar momma status on our own private island.      Shrek 2-- tight movie, very funny. antonio banderas...if we could only keep you in cartoon form from here on out. but this guy stole the show. cameron diaz, why are you in cartoon form again?!? please begin to make real movies soon. fun fact: this is the second sequel movie Mike Meyers has created where in the first two weeks it outgrossed the entire gross of the previous movie. The first was Austin Powers. If you have not seen Shrek 1 or 2, go see them... just herb it up and youll enjoy. ======================== Sorry I couldn't be more creative, but I have a major case of the Mondays. Yaaaa  PS-- ronald reagan, thanks for dropping out this past week. my government-approved vacation day friday was most enjoyable. sorry to be so insensitive, but fuck it...surprise fridays off are a close 2nd to payday fridays.

      If you are ever on vacation, a concert, a gas station, and you are drunk, high, bored, there is one sport in this world that you can remain competitive no matter where or under the influence of whatever drugs. And that sport, my friends, is mullet hunting. if you google mullet, it returns 400,000 responses. Mullets, which were recently moved off the endangered species list, can sometimes be the sexiest hunting youll ever do. I remember my first mullet....  I was 10. My mother had stopped for gas and gave me money to go pay inside. I head to the counter and the most toothless, septic tank bathing, varmint of a man says to me is dat yer curr? what? isdat chur car? i couldnt answer, i couldnt even understand. i was mesmerized.... crunchy curls up front, long in the back, short on the sides? no way. no one would ever give  THEMSELVES  that style, right? oh but how wrong i was. little did i know,  urlLink its been going on for years....   I can understand if where you are from doesnt issue mullet hunting permits. But in kentucky, where i am from, mullet hunting is similar to fish in a barrel. at the casinos, at the horse track, at the outlet malls, at the ford truck plant.... anywhere there could be some white trash, therein lies a mullet waiting to be found. They have all different varieties of mullets here.         Mullatinos     Femullets     Mullhawks                  When you do decide to go mullet hunting, make sure not to get too close. If a mullatino engages in conversation or worse, drinking tequila with his hunter, the consequences are catastrophic. your hair will lose it shimmer. your teeth definitely fall out. you start fixing up hogs and trannys on grand am coupes. your once acceptable obsession for smart women in tight packages is replaced by femullet chicks who love to open beer cans with their teeth and eat funnel cakes and pork rinds no matter what time of day. your house is sold so you can grab up one of them houses you see on the highway that is cut in half with the words WIDE LOAD on the back. hu hu, wide load, thats cool.  Mullets are a crazy species. They should have been taken out years ago in the coked out, strung out, "hair band" days of poison/def leppard/cinderella/warrant. Unfortunately, the mullet people adapt to whatever musical, or socio economical situation they find themselves in. No one is safe. Because who knows, your kid might have one too.  Hunt the Mullet. Fear the Mullet. Beware the Mullet.

      MIKE:	How long do I wait to call? TRENT:	A day. MIKE:	Tomorrow? TRENT:	No... SUE:	...Tomorrow, then a day. MIKE:	So, two days? TRENT:	Yeah.  I guess you could call it that. SUE:	Definitely.  Two days.  That's the industry standard... TRENT:	... I used to wait two days.  Now everyone waits two days.  Three days is kinda money now, don't you think? ……… TRENT:	Laugh all you want, but if you call to soon you can scare off a nice baby who's ready to party. SUE:	Don't listen to him.  You call whenever it feels right to you. MIKE:	How long are you guys gonna wait to call your honeys? TRENT & SUE:	Six days. ========================== This classic argument between three 20ish "swingers" encapsulates man's greatest mystery... when in the hell are you supposed to call a girl? Whether guys like to admit it or not, we are always worried about what the real answer to the question is. If you call too soon you seem desperate for some action right? If you call too late its as if you werent even interested in the first place. Of course everyone says call when you feel comfortable, but that doesnt work because youre worried about whether that girl has a set "day" amount.  So to solve this shit once and for all, I have devised a calendar that all men (and women) can pay attention to and use to the best of their ability. Just make sure not to leave 5-7 voice mails on the day you're actually calling :)  If you get a girls number on a Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday, you should call on a Thursday to try and carve out some weekend plans for Friday or Saturday.  If you get a girls number on a Thursday, you have to wait until mid-afternoon Saturday to do anything about it.  Here is where it gets a little tricky.... If you get a girls number on Friday night, you have several options.       A) If you were legitimately having good conversation, i.e.  not  this: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Guy:  Hey whats up girl, god damn you look good in that little skirt byatch &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Girl: What? I cant hear you. What? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Guy:  I said god damn i wanna bend you over this pool table and hate fuck you right now &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Girl: Still cant hear you buddy &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Guy:  Can i just buy you a fucking drink and get your number? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Girl: Sure....my number is 404-555-1212 and my drink is a banana cognac, byatch.       And you got her number, got her some drinks, maybe even occupied each others time for over half hour, it is safe to say you are allowed to call the next day and see if she is down for doing some shit...i mean if she was interested enough to spend more than the allotted cheesey time you spend that first time, then its all good. Proceed as if its a green light.      B) If it was cool but not a green light kinda cool, you are absolutely not allowed to call back on saturday. You have to try and arrange a sopranos session on sunday or forget about the number until Monday when you can plan for that week.  Finally, if you get a girls number on a Saturday night then....what the fuck are you doing? Saturday nights are not good for getting numbers. First off, you should already be going out with the Wednesday-Friday crew at this point. Secondly, Saturdays cannot be called until Tuesday/Wednesday... thats way over the time and they know you dont have any interest. Just as a general fucking rule, on Saturday nights, you either take them home from the bar/club/whatever or you dont even bother. No need to stress yourself out over what day to call the Saturday chicks.  I hope this clears up any confusion we may have about the opposite sex. One thing that is of the utmost importance in regards to all phone calls. If you say you are going to call, there is no sin greater in a woman's mind than not calling when you said you were. Unless you tried to bring up anal.... thats definitely worse, definitely.  Peace!

      Well to the 4 people reading this thing, sorry about yesterday... but I did not come into work because of the crazy weekend i had. So Friday night I roll out to a party in the VA highlands. I didnt really feel like going but it was one of those situations where there were definitely going to be free booze, free brews, and potentially hot girls. (side note- why do people even say starts at 9:00 anymore? Everyone knows that isn't gonna happen. I equate 9:00 = 10ish. Hell, even 10:00 = 10ish. So why even drop the 9 in there?) Anyway, eventually the party was a nice size and filled out the apartment pretty well. We got nice and toasty and then went to  urlLink Balls in Hand  in a big crew. The only way to survive and have a chance to talk to other girls outside your table area is to have a big crew in the highlands....a good mix of guys and girls. I (sorry) drove home afterwards and drunk dialed a few people. Then passed out until about 8 am. I had like unbelievable knotted and charred throat issues from all the mixing of beer and liquor and ciggies. So i get up and jet straight into the bathroom to pull the trigger. You know you shouldnt be driving the night before if you wake up and  THEN  puke and then get back in bed. So I woke up again around noon, got directly into my bathing suit, and dove into the pool. Eventually I left with my buddy Keith to go to Biloxi. by 5 pm CST, I was inside the casino trying to get on the list to play $1-4-8-8 hold em. Those of you who dont like cards, kiss my ass.... I have to tell the story for the benefit of those who do. I also played $1-5 7 card stud... i was brand new and definitely made the majority of my money in this game. Keith and I sat next to each other because they opened a brand new table for 10 people. It was fun, we were playing pretty tight when about an hour in, a crazy huge pot happened.  10 players. My down cards were 3clubs/3spades. There was a raise pre flop and four of us stayed in (including my friend). Flop comes A 10 3 rainbow. I figure myself for the best hand by far, I had flopped a set. Bet $4, raise $4, re-raise $4, CAP!!! $4. holy shit, the four of us were betting and raising each other like crazy. Pot is worth $70. Turn comes A. Bet $8, raise $8, reraise $8. $168 pot. I have a full house and am thinking i am taking this thing down to china town. river comes 8 or some non significant card. Bet $8, raise $8. $224 pot. The other two guys at the end of the table turn over AK and AQ. All they had was 3 of a kind. I turn over my full house 3-3-3-A-A. My friend Keith had pocket 10s the whole time. 10-10-10-A-A. He took the whole thing down. mother fucker.  Anyway, after a session from 6pm-4am, we decided to go sleep in the car. Worst idea ever. I was so swassy and swally and nasty from the heat in the car, I felt like I had taken a sweat shower with a nice bottle of sweat shampoo. thrilling thought, yes? woke up at 8, grabbed breakfast, played until noonish. Then played roulette and won all my money back. I walked in there with $300 and walked out with $300. Dead even, minus the free drinks, food, gas money, and giant bacteria culture growing in our clothes, it was a pretty fun time.  Got back in time to blaze up, watch sopranos finale, and pass the FUCK out and sleep through my alarm for work the next day. That was my weekend, how was everyone else's?

      Before I had an actual job, and actual money to pay for shit that I wanted, my priorities on favorite days were all fucked up. Some weeks Tuesday was the best day.. $3.00 pitchers of PBR all night long at Moes and Hoes. Some weeks, Sunday was the best day because of all the NFL sportsbooking options. Hell when I was 11 I thought Thursdays were the best days because I got to fuck around at Hebrew School and eat a Kit Kat bar. But now, without a doubt, Fridays are the best fucking days on earth. And you know what day is even better than Friday? Payday Friday. Pay me, bitches!  "I know you don't smoke weed, I know this; but I'm gonna get you high today, 'cause it's Friday; you ain't got no job... and you ain't got shit to do."  If you dont know that quote stop reading, close the browser, never come here again. How damn good does it feel to geek out of work on a friday at like 4ish and its sunny as hell outside and you have a fat load of cash waiting to be spent over the next 2 weeks. I feel like Dave Chapelle when he leaves work in Half Baked and as soon as he steps outside he's like "FREEEEEE!!!" Of course, I'm no custodian...janitor, if you wanna be a dick about it.  So most Fridays I try to skance out a date with a girl who wants to get hella money spent on her. I mean, she gets to have a good time, I get to have a good time, its a good situation for all parties. When that (most of the time) fails to happen, I turn to any other activity besides a bar. Concerts if there are any, cool shit going on in this town, anything to spend some money and get fucked up and do something different. But some Fridays are meant for doing something chill...something to relax, get a little extra sleep in, because Saturday and Sunday are going to be crazy yo. What is a way that you can do something a little different from the standard weekend and still spend as much money as your heart desires?  Road Trip. And not just any road trip... not a trip into tents and camping and nature and all that shit. Fuck that shit. I am cruising down to where the gulf of mexico crashes into the white sand dunes, to where you can smell the salt in the air as soon as you cross the bridge, a place where dreams are made and shattered in the blink of an eye, where the donuts are warm, the hot dogs are rolling around on an endless loop just waiting for some freeloader to scoop one up on his quick bathroom/snack break, a place where grinding out 3 hours of sleep in the backseat is just easier than getting a hotel room, where the weather doesnt matter and time stands still because there are no clocks anywhere in site. Thats right mother fuckers, I am going to  urlLink Biloxi Grand Casino  this weekend.  Wish me luck! (Although its not about luck in my game)

      I dont know if anyone saw this headline in the news today, but apparently some dude in New Jersey (Cherry Hill-- one of the jappiest places ever) decided to sue over the fact that there exists a concept called ladies night at bars.  urlLink See this.   Here is a little excerpt: The director of New Jersey's Division on Civil Rights ruled Tuesday that Ladies' Night at a Cherry Hill bar and restaurant was discriminatory against men.  Dude, what the fuck is going on in this country? Why would the division of civil rights have any reason to pursue a law banning ladies nights? (that rhymed..tight) Dont they have anything better to do?  Also, who is this idiot? Ladies nights, although extremely uncommon in vicklanta, are the best thing that could possibly happen to men who sue bars over the concept of a ladies night.   Pay attention buddy (and whoever else): more girls show up, more drinks cost less money, everyone wins. he must have had some serious social skill issues to make a hoopla over what i consider to be gods little slice of heaven on a random tuesday night. maybe i am just a p.i.m.p. but i feel like 99.9% of the population is with me on this one.  side rant: Although they are not exactly ladies nights, the biggest fucking scam on college campuses today are these things called crush parties. Basically, two sororities get together and every girl in there gets to invite 2 or 3 guys to this huge drunkfest at a club.  Of course, no girl pays attention to the 2-3 guys part...they invite whoever the fuck they want. guys feel like an invite somehow means they get to fuck at the end of the night.... but, night of the party, half the yatches stay home because they cant wear their Manolo Blahniks with this top and there is going to be a line to get in....and one thing about these emory girls, they definitely  DO NOT  wait in line. so the ratio at the 2:3 crush party has now become 1:7. Moussed up yankees rock their black pants with the fuck me blue shirt in an attempt to find the top 3 yatches and settle down with 1. Little do they know the girl who invited them is having a SATC rerun party at her place and could give a fuck about the mess of the crush party in the first place. Drink prices are skyhigh because instead of having ladies night specials, now everyone shells out $4 for beer and $6.50 for watered down popov and a splash of cranberry. The guys are frustrated because as they shove their way through the testosterone mass huddled at the bar, drop huge tabs on their credit cards, grab a drink for the chick that they just talked to, and scramble back through the club looking for the girl, they realize she has just gone to the bathroom with her 3 best friends now making the ratio in the room 1:11. At the end of the night they close out their tabs, catch a cab with all the guys they came with, drop cash on pizza and late night shit, wack off, and go to bed. God damn, I hated crush parties.

      Atlanta. Hotlanta. Why do people constantly feel the need to fuck with their town names. To solve this mystery and other conspiracies, tune in to Vicklanta. For all the hype of this place being "hot", there is mad evidence to prove otherwise.  Well that was the best intro i could muster....  The weather is great...love it. whats not to love. the last time it rained 2 days in a row here was back when eddie murphy was actually funny.  There are a ton of bars to go to...it would be nicer if the drinks were not 8 fucking dollars, but who's counting?  Sure, I cannot escape the Shiksa-ppeal of these ridiculously pretty, pale, blonde barbie dolls that live here. Who grew up on a georgia education which ranks 47th out of 51 (including puerto rico). Who dont know about all the wonders of the bigger, realer cities, i.e. up in NYC. big shout out to biggie. haha. The girls who sound like they are cracked out worse than Tyrone Biggums and drawl out their words longer than Ron Jeremy. Hey yaaaaaaalllllll. damn, that word is the worst. Girls who list god, jesus, and creed concerts as their top 3 most important aspirations in life. Yatches who go to UGA from their small hometowns, find some doosh in khaki shorts and rip-off ralph lauren t-shirts with the collar flipped up who like to drink burrr and kick some ass, realize they are going to be pulling in just under 6 figures managing their ma and pa's tractor trailer truck farm, and cling to these losers until they inevitably produce a middies-size rock at the age of 21 and get married and disappear.  Damn that sounded like a Rant ala Dennis Miller.  And now I am drawing a blank. This "blog" as the hipster artsy writer types like to call it -- me being an internet whore at work 9-5 -- is inspired to serve as a distraction to all other google.com jockers that roll around the internet looking for entertaining, brainless, and mostly (funny?) shit to read.  Hope you enjoy.

      no not serena williams. not ashley judd or paris hilton.&nbsp;i am referring to the most ridiculous act in entertainment today. a late ticket holder on&nbsp;the poppy teeny hottie girl mickey mouse club train. a girl who walks with her head high and her soul sold to satan aka geffen records. a&nbsp;piggybacker who knew she could market herself to MTV because they actually stooped low enough to market her retarded sister too. the perfect example of why in 2014,&nbsp;america will look back on this day and ask ourselves: why lord. why did we listen to  urlLink Ashlee Simpson .    Here in a photo shoot we see whats really going on in those big blonde heads.        A :(thinking) ugh, bitch, dont touch me   J :(thinking?) i have no idea where i am, whats going on, or who this girl is    7&nbsp;Burning Questions with Ashlee Simpson    ================================    7.   Let me set up this scenario. a hooker, a nun, a Flemish peasant woman, whips, chains, whistles yo-yo's, a circus midget, my grandmother riding by on a bicycle giving me the finger, and a duck. comment.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you so much&nbsp;for having me-- i cant resist&nbsp;a&nbsp;good blog. Ya, I have my new album out in stores now. i really think its gonna be totally awesome you guys. i really just wanted to do something different than everyone else. my producer was great, we totally bonded. i like, really love this album. oh and im not just jessica simpson's sister.    ok....    6. So what hurts worse, selling your soul to satan or selling your soul to mtv?   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, i would have to go with mtv. selling your soul to satan is pretty easy... he is always willing to take on new talent. besides, the word on the street is that once you move out to LA you  have  to sell your soul to someone to be anyone. mtv requires a lot more groveling, ass kissing, meetings for the sake of meetings, and they usually have explicit rights to edit, change, or  (re) write your lyrics as they see fit. there's good and bad, but either way its a whole lotta bling.    5. What is the quickest way to scam tons of your fans into making your album debut at #1?   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh thats easy, just make a reality show. mine was&nbsp;about the difficulties and struggles&nbsp;a pop icon goes through to make an album. how you have to sing, and write lyrics, and work long hours in the studio, and make tons of cash. then you just&nbsp;air it right when the 13-18 age group gets home from school. was that the answer you were looking for?    um, ya...you nailed it.    4. Blonde or Brunette?   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; i love my new hair color... i was sick of being looked at as a little jessica so i did something brash and rebellious on my reality show so everyone would see that i am not just someones little sister anymore. i think it really went well with the fans. theyre all i care about anyway. well that and the cash.       3. Speaking of your fans,&nbsp;shoobie mcvicker&nbsp;calls them, 'mindless peons who wouldnt know music if it slapped them upside the eardrum.' is that who you want listening to your music?   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; thats the irony of this business... record companies used to toss albums like mine in the trash can when they got them in the mail. but&nbsp;once they lost any shred of&nbsp;integrity or self-respect, it was&nbsp;too easy to get the mindless peons to buy whatever we wanted them to. do i wish i could write better lyrics? sure. do i want older people to listen? sure. but do i care who is buying the album as long as its getting bought? not really.    2. Whats better: tuna fish or chicken of the sea?   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; neither, i like red meat because im a rebel. grr.    1. 'You make me wanna la la in the kitchen on the floor/I'll be a french maid when I meet you at the door/I'm like an alley cat drink the milk up, I want more.' what in gods name does this mean?   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sounds like some teeny bopper hanson shit. who said it?   you.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; oh. hmm. no comment.

      Kirsten Dunst is  urlLink single  again. mmm, hear my plea. piiiilllooow tooop. piiilllooow top.  Funny name, funny story, funny  urlLink coincidence .  Things are spicing up in  urlLink Vicklanta .  Something to give you a  urlLink pick-me-up  in life&nbsp;  ===============================  Yan Katz, you get a point for calling that i would have to do this. According to my roomie, there are enough random weird and strange things that go on in kentucky that would necessitate a series of kentucky confessions. with that in mind    Kentuckyism #1   Every single spanish teacher in kentucky is completely and undeniably insane beyond repair. It sucks for the people reading who truly have not experienced the foreign language program in kentucky schools, but i assure you... i will describe it in full detail for the imagination.    Ms. Randolph   &nbsp; Ms. randolph was fucking crazy. i mean, she had no fucking clue what kinda shit was going down in her middle school classroom. she is about 5'6, haitian, speaks french and spanish, and is definitely on some serious prozac. she was so nice and if she had taught any other subject, im sure we would have been sweethearts... but she taught spanish, and when you teach spanish you get fucked with. i remember a few things, memory is fading but... we used to fucking grab a whole box of chalk from her desk and just gun full pieces at each other from across the room. like when we would take a quiz you would just hear it whiz by you and shatter into tiny pieces against the wall. we convinced her all the time to just let us watch a movie. then we would sit in the back and play spades. Ms. randolph eats cheeseburgers too (inside joke).  one time chiu and i had to do a presentation on items in the bedroom. since the only way i learned in school was to cheat off chiu, an oral presentation was going to be a bit difficult. instead of flunking us chiu convinced her to let us go outside in the halls to learn the necessary vocab. of course instead of staying on task we rolled down to Mr. Schmidts for some soda and a little goof off time.&nbsp; anyhoo, michelle stories are more than welcome in the comments section. ella es muy loco.    Mrs. Taylor   &nbsp; Mrs. Taylor was a nice christian lady who was actually fully american and enjoyed  la vida  that espanol teaching provided. She was the sponsor of the Spanish Club at du pont&nbsp;manuel, which in the public school system means no overtime and lots of sopapilla parties. her daughter, bethany taylor, was considered one of the hottest girls running from 1st thru 12th grade. I mean is that possible, to be hot at the age of 8 and 18? 8 year olds dude. anyway, she was about 5'1 and looked like a pear with mr. potato head eyes. big fucking eyes. uhh, im shuddering right now. they still haunt me late at night. mrs. taylor hated me and most of my friends because she knew we were fucking good at spanish, she knew we put forth effort in almost every other subject, and yet for some reason the&nbsp;unwritten rules of the spanish class called for chaos, irrational spanish translating, and lots and lots of cheating and naps. fucking bitch. is manda copsey gonna have to choke a bitch? next    Mrs. Wold   &nbsp;Like Mrs. Taylor, Mrs. Wold was a very conservative christian lady with an extremely blonde and very tight like a tiger daughter stephanie. god damn, stephanie wold. mmm. she is the spitting image of a girls gone wild girl. i could never date her because her name is my sisters name (no, that is not kentucky confession #2.) but you see where im going here. The mother fucking hated us for hitting on her daughter. we all knew she was claimed, but who gives a shit. you get to the daughter you get to the mom. and what a fucking mom she was. mrs. wold was a fucking cunt of a teacher. i can honestly say that mrs. wold probably had the worst professional career of her life when we stepped into her classroom. she was the kinda lady who hated that corporal punishment was banned....but youd never know. instead she just stood there like a fucking bitch with her arms crossed speaking spanish to us like we fucking knew what she was saying. i dont think i could bring myself to hate fuck her, she's that bad. but her ridiculous pouty bitch attitude couldnt hold a candle to the truest and most fucked up spanish teacher of all time:    Roy Crady &nbsp;  &nbsp; Mr. Crady, a legend in his own mind, a man who many men and women fear. let me give you a little background on this shady fuck. he's about 5'8, buzzcut, army moustache, wears sunglasses in class. other job is to work at a halfway house. a halfway house is a place where criminals who are released from jail but are still on probation stay to be monitored. so by day, he teaches 16 year old kids. by night, he barrades and harasses ex cons. wow, good hire move. crady used to have these 5 or 6 assistants in every class. it was like the smartest kids and they usually had to do 1/3 of the workload as the rest of the class. the best part though was he would pull sporadic quizzes and if an assistant missed too many he fired them and picked a new one. i think i got it about half the way through the year and god damn i loved every minute of it. we even got to go out on the 4th floor roof and play sometimes. the best teaching tool in the whole world was of course the latin american hit  Destinos . After a drunk survey at a bar, and calculating odds and accuracy, i would say that 19 out of 20 people who took spanish in high school had to watch  Destinos  at some point. rosaaaario, rosaaario. raquel juga futbol con paco y emilia. despite his crazy vietnam hooker stories and his wrong emphASIS on the wrong syLABble while telling long drawn out tales of bailando con mujeres espanolas, he taught me more spanish than anyone else had accomplished.  Spanish teachers in kentucky are all nuts. its a fact. find me a normal foreign language teacher in kentucky and ill find you a jewish girl who doesnt like louis vuitton.

      So for the record, my knowledge base extends slightly beyond cartoon trivia, bong resin, and fashion commentary...it doesnt go far, but i can hold my own in the math knowledge arena as well. So with that in mind, I figure I may as well write about two cool math related things that could be good for conversation about poker, cards, general proposition betting, etc.    Shuffling cards   Lets say you take a deck of cards. If you could perfectly shuffle the cards by splitting them exactly in the middle and then shuffle in right, left, right, left, etc.... all the way through, there are two types of shuffles. An in shuffle is where you start shuffling left to right. An out shuffle is where you start shuffling right to left.   &nbsp;&nbsp; In Shuffle:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1&nbsp; 2&nbsp; 3&nbsp; 4&nbsp; 5&nbsp; 6&nbsp; 7&nbsp; 8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ==> top to bottom  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1&nbsp; 2&nbsp; 3&nbsp; 4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5&nbsp; 6&nbsp; 7&nbsp; 8 ==> split into L and R  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5&nbsp; 1&nbsp; 6&nbsp; 2&nbsp; 7&nbsp; 3&nbsp; 8&nbsp; 4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (top to bottom)   &nbsp;&nbsp; Out Shuffle:&nbsp; 1&nbsp; 2&nbsp; 3&nbsp; 4&nbsp; 5&nbsp; 6&nbsp; 7&nbsp; 8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ==> top to bottom  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1&nbsp; 2&nbsp; 3&nbsp; 4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5&nbsp; 6&nbsp; 7&nbsp; 8 ==> split into L and R  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1&nbsp; 5&nbsp; 2&nbsp; 6&nbsp; 3&nbsp; 7&nbsp; 4&nbsp; 8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (top to bottom)   The&nbsp;trick or trivia or whatever you wanna do to impress people is to ask: if you could perfectly shuffle a deck of cards&nbsp;by in-shuffling and shuffle another deck by out-shuffling, how many times does it take to get the deck back to its original order? The crazy part is it takes 52 perfect in-shuffles to return it to its original order.  urlLink It only takes 8 out shuffles .&nbsp;  &nbsp;  A followup to this shuffling issue is, lets say youre in a home game and some jackass is shuffling the cards over and over and over. its like he thinks that by shuffling them a ridiculous amount of times it will spread the high cards out. It has been proven that 3/2 log 2   n   (n = # of cards in the deck)  shuffles is sufficient, so for a deck of 52 thats about 8 or 9 shuffles.    ====================   Birthday Proposition   This math problem is basically to try to figure out in a room full of people, what the odds are that two people in the room have exactly the same birthday. When you ask someone to try and think about it, usually they will come up with 1/365 * 1/365 is the odds two people have the same birthday. Unfortunately, this is one of those crazy math problems.   Instead of going at it from same day, calculate the odds that two people will NOT have the same birthday. so in a group of  n  people with  d  being the number of possible days (365),&nbsp;if n=2, the odds that they will not have the same birthday is (d-1)/d. the odds that three people will not is (d-1)/d * (d-2)/d. with n people, it works out from:       or simply put:          This number is really hard to figure out if you dont have a ridiculous scientific calculator, but basically that Q 1   is the odds that n people do NOT have the same birthday. since the denominator is increasingly bigger, Q 1  is heading towards zero as the number of people increases.&nbsp; if you calculate 1-Q  1   then you are calculating the odds of two people with the SAME birthday.&nbsp;Q 1  gets smaller as n gets bigger, which means as more and more people are added your odds become  exponentially  higher that 2 will have the same day.    &nbsp;  If you are really fucking confused right now and you have no idea whats going on, i think you should just download this little  urlLink program i made  and youll see what i mean. (you need to have microsoft access 2000 or better to view)

      7.  sniff test  - when we havent done laundry in awhile, or we just threw some jeans on the floor the night before, the next day if said jeans need to be worn, a guy will lift them to his nose, smell for cigarette smoke, beer spills, and general wear and tear. if the jeans pass the smell test, they go on immediately. (russ rochestie sniff tests his boxers sometimes)   6.  the morning after  - no not that morning after! when guys sleep over at your place they pretty much cannot relieve any bathroom urges while they are there...its impossible. so the next morning, when they say goodbye and shut the door behind themselves to go home, they wait a little 3 second buffer and then all hell breaks loose. long, 8-hour-waiting-to-creep-out farts just go hurling out. its true, bet.   5.  shades at the pool  - guys do not wear sunglasses at the pool to block the sun from their eyes. their sole purpose is to look at girls more discreetly. never in the history of (straight) men has a guy complained about sun in his eyes at a pool, he's really just complaining that he cant gawk at hoes.   4.  saying goodbye  - everyone is all fucked up over how to say goodbye these days. guys sometimes just say later dude and walk out. sometimes we knock fists and say laaterrr. sometimes there is like a little half handshake that turns into some weird game of goodbye thumb war...sometimes a snap is caused making the goodbye real cool before saying see ya dude. the trouble is when one person is going for the handshake and another is going for the fist.  immediately upon seeing the fist, the handshake guys will turn into fist. simultaneously, the fist guy will turn into handshake to accomodate as well. then there is maybe a round or two of back and forth before some lame joke is cracked and the goodbye is extended.       3.  cell phone tact  - i may get murdered for this, i know how much you yatches love talking on your bling blings. but...if you are talking to a guy for an extended period of time and he decides that the allotted time for conversation has been surpassed, he will hold the cell phone away from his ear and proceed to half-hear you until it is time to hang up or until he senses quiet on the other end, a pause for perhaps some air and a chance to hear what he has to interject on the topic. if he is in a room with any other guys in it, be it 1 or 10, he will exaggerate your longwindedness by holding the cell phone away from his ear, rolling his eyes at his homies, and may even hand signal a joke about you without you ever knowing.   2.  silent communication  - girls think that they hold the trophy over this concept that they can have an entire conversation without any words. its just eye movement and head nods, even lips moving with no sound. but, men have the exact same capability... we can communicate very precise and accurate silent transactions in almost any environment. the difference is that when you are out with a group of guys and girls, when a girl gets caught signaling to her friend by a guy, girls will freeze like deer in headlights. guys can be smooth about covering up their signals when they are caught by girls...which leads me to my #1...   1.  lies  - we all tell lies, may as well be honest about it. now i am not talking about big lies, lies that are deep and get you in trouble when the truth surfaces.... guys suck at those lies, girls see right through us. i am talking about the little white lies. guys tell white lies on a daily basis.&nbsp;i cant give any personal examples for fear of getting trampled upon, but just trust me when i say guys have perfected this habit.    CHRISTY: What do you guys do?  MIKE: I'm a comedian.  (More uncomfortable silence.)  LISA: Do you ever perform out here? I'd love to see you.  MIKE: No...  LISA: You should. A lot of comics play Vegas.  MIKE: Well, I'm afraid it's not that easy...  LISA: Why not?  MIKE: There are different circuits... it's hard to explain... you wouldn't understand...  LISA: Well who's your booking agent?  MIKE: (flustered) Oh? You know about booking agents... I don't, uh, actually have west coast representation as of yet...  LISA: Well, who represents you back east?  MIKE: Actually, it's funny you... I'm actually, uh, between...  LISA: What do you do, Trent?  TRENT: I'm a producer.  BOTH GIRLS: Wow... Oooh... Ahhh...  (Mike rolls his eyes at how full of shit he is.)  He may be full of shit, but he's just tryin to get his. take this column with a grain of salt, apparently i generalize too much... all i know is, these are 7 things  ALL  guys do and have done that they never tell to girls.

      So america is in love with ashton kutcher. somehow his crew of punkers successfully pulled off 2 seasons with no one calling them out. its always fun to watch big name celebrities get fucked with, and besides kutchers obnoxious and longwinded comic commentary, the show is pretty enjoyable. But just like anything we see on tv, the idea is to enjoy watching as long as you dont pull punks on your friends as well. Unfortunately, not everyone takes to this and a few months ago, two of my buddies decided to punk each other. Now this story is third-hand, so not all the details are there.    Characters :  Jason Scherr, white male, 22, golf team, from the great state of Tejas  Brian Nixon, white male, 20, golf team, from north currolina  Keith Rourke, white male, 21, golf team, original teller of the story  B.C., black dude, 21, funny dude to smoke with, pledge at the time.  several other large pledges in my old fratty        rourke in blue on left, scherr in tan on right.  (ps--popped collar fanatic KB&nbsp;happens to be furthest left in the back)   Scherr and Nixon live in buckhead, in a phat condo that boasts a projection screen tv, columns, plush rugs, etc. Basically they have some nice cash flow in that place, lots of nice things, computers, tvs, tons of real nice shit. They have been friends since college and we're all in the same frat. Rourke, his girlfriend, scherr, nixon, their girlfriends...theyre all in the same crew, they hang out all the time.   One night they all decide to punk Nixon and the gist of it was that rourkes girlfriend would act like she was cheating on him... with rourkes roommate. they wanted to see how long it would take nixon to confide in rourke that she was cheating. this punk dragged on for like a month... nixon felt so bad about it and yet he could not work up the guff to tell rourke he thought his lady was cheating on him. eventually one night they sprang it on nixon that no one was cheating on anyone and he got punk'd. the problem was, for some reason, the whole cheating thing didnt sit well with nixon... probably something from his past, who knows. he got really upset at them for making him stress about it for like a month. so, nixon decided to take his revenge out on scherr. he would re-punk these punks.   So Nixon grabbed B.C. and told him to get a few more pledges. they were to dress in all black and wear ski masks and the whole bit, dress up exactly like robbers coming for a score. One night when nixon knew scherr was asleep in bed, he had B.C. and crew come over to their condo, he left the side porch door open. So these three guys dressed in all black with ski masks go into scherrs bedroom. and they have some bags with them, they start tossing his cd's and watches, xbox, all of it into the bags.... they are purposefully trying to make a lot of noise but scherr is just not waking up at all. so 2 of them go to lift his tv while B.C. makes a loud ass noise to wake scherr up in the middle of this "robbery."&nbsp;they shine a flashlight at him and scream OH SHIT! he's awake! and then the madness begins.   Scherr is fucking frozen, like he doesnt know what to do. he's in his boxers and there are three dudes in ski masks in his room lifting all his shit. B.C. begins to scream. Get your fucking hands up! where the fuck is your jewelry man? weve been scouting your place for days...where the fuck is it! get on the fucking floor where we can see you. youre fucking lucky we dont kick your ass for waking up little bitch. and on and on, imagine all the things a black dude would scream at you if he was robbing your house. so apparently scherr tries to dial 911 while they are doing all this shit. YO! he's calling someone.... who the fuck are you tryin to call man. the fuckin police?   scherr is like, half crying,&nbsp;just take whatever you want man, take it all...basically all the shit you would say to 3 guys robbing your house, just like in the movies. he's shaking, his face is ghost white. he's soaked in sweat. he cannot do shit, he's helpless to stop it.   after this went on for about half an hour (! can you believe?) nixon pops his head in and he screams: You Got Punk'd! the lights come on, the pledges take off their ski masks, and scherr fucking flips his shit. he was fucking scared to death. he was on the verge of tears it was so crazy, ya know. needless to say, nixon got his punk'd revenge tenfold compared to the lame first punk. and that is officially the last time anyone fucked with nixon again.    ====================  How was everyones weekend? Mine was fucking crazy. i got some yatches number on a friday but i couldnt call it back on saturday because A, i didnt remember her name, and B, the convo was lame but it was a lock. in cases such as these its best to call up on monday (after you get the name through 6 degrees of kevin bacon) and set some shit up for tues-thurs night. on a side note, i did happen to follow my saturday rule though, if anyone remembers that one. thanks to all my friends who officially skanced out on the pink pony and left me and jonny mcfucks to tend to all that other shit. oh and if anyone can somehow get me a digi-copy of karaoke night that would be pretty sweet. peace niggars. booyakasha.

      I bet when you first see that title, you might think i am going to talk about conan vs. letterman and why conan is ridiculously more funny in an infinite amount of ways. Or maybe you think the king of late night is some sexual deviance story about a lonely jewish boy who disappears late night to eek out some play. But no my friends, the king of late night is related to food.... damn good food. So good that as long as you have 2 bucks and a sober d, you are guaranteed a one way trip to heaven. thats right, i am talking about the wonder that is  Waffle House .      In louisville, there are hardly any of these meccas of greasy nastiness. Dennys is the spot. Theres the dennys off breckenridge lane which was good for late night food after a crappy movie. then theres the more upscale one out by chiu and mcalister where they looooove black people. waffle houses are in the south end (i believe) and i can honestly say that before georgia, i had never been to one.  Cut to sophomore year. Now I have a car in atl and can explore at my whim. Of course i was stuck in the bubble, so it took someone else to utter the words: off campus. but asher or katz&nbsp;were always down for that 3 am waffle house run. the best part about atlanta is not just the plethora of waffle house chains to choose from, its the environment that each individual waffle house provides that surpasses any other late night eating station.    The one off Cheshire Bridge Road  -- for those of you who dont live here, cheshire bridge is home to the finest strip of sleazy sex clubs (gay, straight, beastial) in atlanta. there are head shops, 4 strip clubs, taco cabana, and of course what corner wouldnt be complete without a waho. this locale attracts mainly gay or crossdressing patrons, who make loud obnoxious scenes and are definitely the most scary and yet most entertaining to watch. ways to fit in: wear leather, wear chains, dye your hair punk colors, kiss the other guys youre with.    The one off Sydney Marcus  -- this one is kinda lame, in the middle of a strip mall. But, one time katz and i were there and this dude who kinda looked homeless but probably wasnt, was wearing one of those 70s jackets with the patches on the elbows, wrinkled pants, no socks, no shoes. that rule does not apply to waho, EVERYONE gets served there.    The one off Buford Highway  -- as mentioned before, buford highway is the base of operations for sergios tanning salon. many many mexicanos. also close by is the pink pony, so this place gets some spillover from sleazy stripclub men who after a long night of just looking at boobies and vajines decide that nothing would hit the spot more than some hash browns scattered smothered and covered. This is the closest waho to emory, but attracts the most diverse crowd.  I believe the nastiest thing i have ever been witness to at waho is when nick johnson got hungry there. back in his pre-"jesus rescues all" stoner drunken buffoon days, this kid looooved waho. he loves bbq and collards, but he loves waho even more. johnson is the only kid i have ever known EVER to order the t-bone steak and eggs from waho. i mean, it aint exactly ruths chris here...we are talking about grade C- meat, a stick of butter, 2 eggs, toast, and hashbrowns.&nbsp;Despite these heart-stoppers, he didnt hesitate to scream HOOOT DAAAMN! afterwards.  I really havent been to waffle house since i graduated.... i guess i dont really have a sober driver and drunkin donuts is a good substitute. But anytime a northerner came to emory and was oblivious to this cultural phenomenon, it was always fun to induct them into the waho club. you even get a FREE paper hat with your first visit.      misty and reba will smother, cover, and dice you    Have a great fucking weekend!

      I love movies...ever since we got our first VCR in 1987... I even remember our first recorded VHS tape held  urlLink Rad ,  urlLink Ferris Bueller's Day Off , and  urlLink Adventures in Babysitting . Damn those were the days. I would say with the invention of the VCR, plus my dads similar obsession with movies, we racked up about 400 hours or so of unadulterated, commercial-free, movie archives. After this hobby drifted off into oblivion, the movie collection was just memories... new movies were coming out, sometimes 3-5 a week on hbo/showtime/cinemax. i remember we even sat down and for 2 weeks we tallied all the movies on those three channels for like five different criteria and decided that hbo had the best lineup (as it does to this day) unless youre looking for that late night put a sock over it and pass out kinda night.   The video industry kinda got weird... tons of local video stores opened up shop. i just remember even kroger had a video rental place at one time. and they had some damn good deals too, 99c wednesdays and shit like that. somehow out of the dust that settled after this industry developed, Blockbuster inc (founded 1985) came out of the pool and opened up shop all over the united states.&nbsp;To date they have 8900 stores and of course there is no such thing as a franchise, its all corporate.        is this man not the devil himself (CEO far right)   The problem is, there are clearly way cooler video stores... places in atl include  urlLink Movies Worth Seeing  and  urlLink Videodrome . Local shops where the employees are not just&nbsp;droning robots who chant "welcome to blockbuster" and "can i help you find anything today?"&nbsp;and they actually have some respect for the industry and genres and ya know, can actually recommend movies to you based on other movies you rent. These local shops will probably be all but oblivious in the next 10 years or so, but I wish they held the majority of the market share, oh well.   So obviously unless your pakistani friend works at Hollywood Video, you have to go to blockbuster to get all your new releases. What is a consumers biggest pet peeve about blockbuster in the whole entire world ever ever? fucking late fees. i cannot rant or rave about the late fees, since its kinda cliche to, i will just say this... if you google "blockbuster late fees" there are about 50,000 results, all people complaining about blockbusters ridiculous late fee policy. if there are so many complaints, and blockbuster is so corporate, what is the possible solution to all this fiasco?   netflix. mmm, just saying the word makes me smile. i feel like everyone who is on the internet or under the age of 30 knows what netflix is, but in case you dont,  urlLink go here . i personally decided to follow in my fathers footsteps and make a new little hobby for myself. i cant go into it without interpol on my ass, but lets just say it involves  urlLink this ,  urlLink this , and 8 movies at a time for like 40 bucks a month. when i get the little red envelopes in the mail, its like channuka all over again. 8 presents at a time.&nbsp;with one day to ship and two days to return, we're looking at anywhere from 15-20 movies a week coming through my little factory. the best part is: NO MORE LATE FEES! no more mother fucking shitty corporate profit hunting late fees.   so today, the devil came out with a statement saying Blockbuster vows to go after Netflix.  ( urlLink full article )  Unfortunately, this forces me to take action. 2 million people are on netflix right now... and they are expanding their business like crazy. if you live in one of the 40 biggest cities, you can probably get next day rentals. netflix is run on a website, so you have a queue of all the movies you want to rent. you can add, delete, move up and down, anything you want. they get the new releases the day they come out. i had starsky and hutch sitting in my mailbox yesterday and it was released on dvd yesterday. once you rank movies, it starts to give you a whole list of recommendations based on genre, actors, directors. its like six degrees of kevin bacon. my netflix queue has yet to drop below 100. and i already have 200 movies. and they have all tv shows, ie family guy, simpsons, friends, sopranos, whatever. and they have documentaries. and concerts. and foreign films.  So please, from the bottom of my heart to the bottom of your wallet, do not give blockbuster another fucking dime with their late fee shit. you know you hate it, why not just rent through netflix and return it when YOU want to? and if youre really smart, youll cut out that whole buying dvds at target thing all together.

       Krispy Kreme donuts are gods gift to man. Now I understand that this statement may receive some heat...i'm sure there's some random mom and pop store back home in long island that serves up the best donuts on earth. But in terms of corporate america donuts, krispy kreme takes the icing.   The nastiest thing i have ever seen in relation to krispy kreme is by none other than my main jewish media infiltrator Asher Levine. Despite his asinine commentary on all topics, he also has a penchant for these warm, gooey donuts that seem to melt in your mouth. One day me, fucks, and ash were at tortillas (previously gods gift to man before closing time) and we had&nbsp;hauled enough burrito and chips to feed somalia. after drowning mine in red & green, i just wanted to get home to sit on the can, maybe catch up on my summer reading. Asher wants to make a side trip to krispy kreme to haul a few donuts. bro, no way you can eat any donuts after torts. blasphemy. sure nuff, asher bought a dozen and piped down 2 in the car on the way home. is the word  vomitable  a legitimate real word? because thats what it was.   krispy kreme has also come in on the clutch after several rainy music midtown nights. what better sketchy parking lot to be in than a ponce krispy kreme when youre covered in mud and sweat and rain and 10,000 other concert attendees are all trying to skance 1 donut off your fresh hot piping box of 12. or when outkast is about to come on and clouds are just covering the entire sky and you make the call to leave the concert to beat all the rain, go into KK and grab a doz, hail a cab, and as you open the door the sky unloads rain over those idiots who stayed to watch 1/2 of stankonia have to cancel his performance anyway.   krispy kreme has developed many different flavors over the years, but obviously no one can stray from the bread and butter of donuts, original glazed. check out some of these statties:   Every day, Krispy Kreme makes about 5 million doughnuts.   Every year, they make about 2 billion doughnuts.   Every week, they make enough doughnuts to reach from New York to Los  Angeles.   Every year, they use up two Olympic-sized swimming pools worth of  chocolate.  Every year, they use about 1 million pounds of sprinkles.  Collectively, Krispy Kreme's stores could make a doughnut stack as high as the Empire State Building (that's 1,454 feet or 443 meters) in only two minutes.    And with this reputation, this indisputable reign over the donut industry, why mess with a good thing? Krispy Kreme plans on releasing donut-in-a-drink.       Now you can fully experience glazed by getting an iced original kreme, raspberry, latte, or double chocolate. I know one man in the world who would not only eat donuts but also drink donuts if he could.         Krispy Kreme was founded on providing essential hot&nbsp;melty glazed donuts&nbsp;to satisfied southern customers. Dairy queen called, they want their hot eats cool treats idea back. No need to make a vomitable drink concept become your new marketing scheme to make more money. Stick with the original. This blog was absolutely not funny, i am ashamed for writing such blarg.  On a side note, my monday birthday concert was awesome-o and adam duritz and crew rocked out acoustic style. Why dont you come. in. out. of. the rain.

      If you dont know 10 burning questions,  urlLink go here .  If you dont know&nbsp;Stewie Griffin, shoot yourself. or click this  urlLink linky .  &nbsp;  Stewie Griffin, some might say he's just&nbsp;an infant... a little stinky baby who poops his diaper and cries for mommy and candy. He has a crib, he has a teddy named rupert, he avoids potty training like its the plague, and he sneaks off in the airport&nbsp;with no disdain for his safety. Others, though, claim that he is brilliant. a man amongst little crying babies. one who can chew the fat with the good ol' boys in the country club, can develop high-tech conspiratory methods for destroying the earth and/or his mother in the blink of an eye, he even speaks to the family pooch. Vicklanta's own fake reporter had him on the hot seat.  (to be read with stewies voice in mind)  &nbsp;   1.Whats your favorite brand of diaper?   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, first off i would like to say thanks sooo much for having me. it was greeeat meeting brenda in make up. she and i got along  stunningly . i would have to say huggies with the aloe vera... nothing like a good minty freshness on your bum. hahaha. ha. ha... oooh, what a zinger to open it up with.  &nbsp;   2.If you had to have a sexy paaaarty with just 3 people, who would they be?   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, hmmm. women, right? yes of coourse. i guess i would have to go with.... man this is a toughie. definitely vanna white, she has nice arms. i guess Judy Garland in her wizard of oooz days, i just loove that movie. and maybe jane jetson... i kinda have a thing for mothers.  &nbsp;   3.Speaking of mothers, I heard youve made several unsuccesful attempts at her life.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ooohh, hush up you old hound. What mummy doesnt know wont hurt her, right? right?        4.Did you breast feed or has your head always been fucked up like that?   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What was that? How dare you insult me! i'll have you know that i have no biological necessity for that vile creatures "breast milk." i prefer a good scotch or a juice box, whatevers there. As for my head it involves a bizarre bedspring jumping incident that i would rather not talk about.  &nbsp;   5.Who could win in a race of wits, you or brian the family dog?   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First off, let me just say... im afraid brian has some "issues", ya know what i mean? i give him guff all the time for his insaaaatiable drinking habits. sometimes brian is at a 9 when we need him at a 2, ya know what i mean? eh?&nbsp;hahaha. ha. ha. please, i am superior to him in all forms of intelligence. he's just a talking dog for christs sake. and look who his master is. i tell you, my whole family has some serious issues. i...yes, i might be the oonly noormal one.        6.Who are all the babies gaga-ing over in daycare?   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'd have to say that Kirsten Dunst, she's soooo magnificent in spiderman 2. when she gets all wet, oooh, talk about gaagaaaaa. As for the gents, i would say that will smith. if he's into dancing i do a mean robot out at the clubs. even paris hilton complimented me.  &nbsp;   7.Dont you wish you could scream out fuck, shit, bitch sometimes at home?   &nbsp;&nbsp; Well, i dont know who you think youre talking to but i have never heard those words in my liife! i read the dictionary cover to cover, no mention of this shit. shit. hmm, i kinda like it, sounds like a tapioca pudding pie or something...whats it mean?&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;   8.Do you have a favorite between your two other siblings?   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pleeeease man. meg, the depressed socially impressionable teenager just trying to fit in with the pretty girls. or chris, the dimwitted&nbsp;video game playing boob obsessed orca model of his father. hmmm, im going to have to go with pass on this question.  &nbsp;   9.Whose more unoriginal? Cartman or Bart Simpson?   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ooooh, tough one. They are both so original. I guess i will go with cartman, he's original now. bart was original in the 90s.&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;   10. So what kind of inventions are you working on now?   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, i'm sorta glad you asked that... ya see, i am kind of finished with this annhihilator 4000. ive been working out the kinks and, this interview is pretty much pissing me off, hang on let me test it out. Youve asked your last question! prepare to be destroyed!

      Some of you might know that I have this little idiosyncrasy about bands whose name begins with the letter B. I would say I hate about 70% of the bands in the world that begin with B, its just one of those random things. The "Big 3" of the Biggest B Bands in this world are: The Beatles, Billy Joel, and Bruce "Boss" Springsteen. Each of these musical icons have gained mass pop culture street credit through record sales, concert tours, triple platinum albums, etc. etc. But you know what? As far as I'm concerned they can all get bent.  &nbsp;  The Beatles have sold blah blah amount of albums. they have 6 of the top 10 best rock songs ever. blah blah. one time the beatles said they were bigger than jesus...in my eyes, they are smaller than a North American Feather-winged Beetle   urlLink Nanosella fungi  . (yay bug scientists!) they sound like shit. i was born in 1980, why should i be forced to say that some 60's hippie cultural revolution in music (from UK, i might add) should somehow find its way onto my daily rotae? every time someone says, "well have you listened to blah blah album?" yes dude, and i still hate the beatles. even sargent pepp-- yes, even sargent pepper. even lucy in the-- yes, even lucy and her fucking diamonds. i recognize that they influenced bands to this day, but that doesnt change the fact that they lick balls. i hate the beatles. moving on  &nbsp;  Billy Joel is a duss. When I was 10 and listening to We Didnt Start the Fire, i had absolutely no concept of what good music was. uptown girl? fucking 80s style. the river of dreams? makes me want to puke. piano man? ehh, ok, this is obviously a good fucking song. but its better when someone else covers it.&nbsp; the only thing i can think of that is positive about Billy Joel is:&nbsp;        Bruce Springsteen. the boss. how in the world did this dude receive such a bold and B-hating title? Its because people from Jersey/Philly are the only ones who dont realize that Jersey is the armpit stain of america. Nothing good comes from Jersey (sorry tony soprano) except poofy hair, short skirts, hoop earrings, and loud obnoxious gum poppers. the only good song from this guy is secret garden from jerry maguire. it makes the panties drop.  &nbsp;  Now you may think that calling these three B bands out is blasphemous. I just find it necessary to flush out shitty bands from classic rock radio. You may say, whatever, anyone who says these bands suck does not know shit about music. Ha! I recognize their influence but thats where i draw the line. if i am on a road trip in the back seat high and having a previously enjoyable time and this CD is put into the tray, i will never think twice about screaming BUZZKILL and&nbsp;calling these bands the worst fucking bands in the world.  &nbsp;  Other "B" bands on the list     Beach Boys -- american classics? the beatles and the beach boys should go live on an island and play for each other if they are that revolutionary.  Babyface  Bette Midler -- haha, had to  Blessed Union of Souls  Blondie  Bob Dylan -- I mean come on, people who cover his songs are good. he sounds tone deaf.  Brandy  Brian McKnight  Britney Spears -- pure eye candy  Bubba Sparxx -- madden soundtrack is the highlight of his career...wow

       Super Size Me --  This movie is about a fit, normal, health-conscious guy who embarks on one of the most grueling and vile quests... to find out how shitty McDonalds food really is. Yo, we all eat this crap... i prefer wendys or arbys&nbsp;but thats because they have dank baked potatoes and good sauces to throw in there. Obviously eating McDonalds for a month straight will fuck your shit up, but if you go see this movie i bet you will think twice about ever pulling a late night drive-thru move again. fun facts: i used to work at dairy queen, the only safe thing to eat is ice cream there. sometimes the cook would grill the top half of&nbsp;15 burgers and leave it sitting there for 30-45 minutes until someone ordered and they could cook it the rest of the way&nbsp;through. fucking gross.      Fahrenheit 9/11 --  Ahh michael moore. everyone has their take on this assclown, i personally think he is the worst kind of documentary filmmaker because he splices and cuts clips however he wants his point portrayed and does not give any logical solution to the questions he proposes. and yet i still say this movie is definitely worth seeing... it could be half-truths, yes, but i think the main facts from this movie will hold up as the real truth is revealed (if ever). the bush family, who has ties to the texas oil industry, has business partners with Osama's family. bush has appointed close friends to his cabinet to secure the billions of dollars this industry is worth to the arabs and the americans. bush is trigger happy and pre-emptively struck Iraq with no definite knowledge of a Saddam-led&nbsp;terrorist threat to america. i also like how he does not bag on the soldiers for doing their jobs, he shows them in a positive light, perhaps even victim to Bush's agenda. dont go to this flick high, its a good waste of gods gift to man.    Spider-Man 2  --  Definitely go see this one hi. Episode 2 features Doc-Oct and his 6 new robot arms. The movie definitely has some cheesy, comic book dialogue.... conversations between Peter and Aunt May are pretty lame, not really sure why she didnt get it in the first episode with the carjacked uncle. But, special effects are really good, action/fight scenes look badass, Mary Jane looks hot as hell. If you liked one youll like two. I have no idea why this movie was at the top of the box office for so long, but apparently it happens with all comic book movies so why should this be any different. and now, a sexy picture of the lady.        Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story  --  Vince Vaughn, Christine Taylor, Ben Stiller, and of course guest cameos (chuck norris and david hasselhoff in the same flick!)&nbsp;by all their mutual friends. I think this movie was pretty funny, vince vaughn's typecast characters are still entertaining, and having christine taylor as "cleanup" on your dodgeball team obviously cant hurt things. Unfortunately this movie is not even in the same realm of funny as zoolander and old school. Maybe on round 3, these guys will get it working again... You're going down like a sweet muffin!        Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy  --  Will Ferrell is one of the funniest men alive, which is why this movie shoulda coulda woulda been really good. Unfortunately, the script kinda falls flat and although there are some good little one liners that will be repeated an exorbitant amount of times every night out for the rest of the summer, i would have almost rather waited for the dvd to roll out instead. Christina Applegate is so fucking hot. hot hot hot. Steve Carell from the Daily Show was an unexpected co-star whose comic genius equals that of ferrell in this movie. the higher you are, the funnier this is. guest cameos include ben stiller, vince vaughn, and a very funny jack black dropkicking animals scene.&nbsp;       Have a good weekend, i am going to be one old mother fucker soon. Perhaps i will soon have my quarter life crisis. peace,  urlLink niggars .

      1.  Talk about other guys -- i dont care if its just friends or ex-boyfriends or whatever, there is one definitive truth on a date and that is not to talk about other guys while youre on the date with a guy. If it is necessary for the story, thats cool. if it is just extraneous details, no mentioning other boys.  2.  Answer your cell phone -- yo, if you are on a date it is pretty rude to pick up your celly unless its for one of the following reasons. a, you pick up to say youll call back later. or b, its your (jewish) mother and you always pick up regardless of who youre with.  3.  Ask the waiter too many things -- Its cute when a girl plays dumb or is really wondering what the ingredients are. But men by nature do not ask a ton of questions, so naturally we think of needless restaurant questions as an extension of our own ego and become embarassed if our date is asking an insane amount of questions. common ridiculous ones: whats better, dish a or dish b. i bet waiters loathe this question the most.... lady, how am i supposed to tell you what you want to eat more? Also, the popular: ill have the chicken sandwich, but can you put 3 tomatoes on top, slice the onions into 1 inch thick circles, and only put fresh iceburg lettuce on there, oh and can i switch out the fries for the chips and salsa appetizer?  4.  Tell the guy beforehand you dont kiss on the 1st date -- if you say this, well... i guess good for you. making sure the guy isnt doing the date for one reason only. But i do have to tell you, if a girl ever said this to me i would definitely be more hard pressed to have a sweet time than if she hadnt said anything at all. it throws a guy off when you establish ground rules before a chance is even given to make an impression on you. plus, this is the 21st century, get over what your mother told you about being a lady. if you want to kiss a guy kiss him, if not dont. but dont like set limits, leave things open for you to say yes OR no.  5.  Make a big deal over the guy paying -- some women will disagree (kliegmo) but i just assume that if i am taking a girl out then i am paying for it. its my treat and i wouldnt have asked you out in the first place if i didnt expect to pay. if its past date 2 and the girl wants to plan something and pay, i have no problem with that. but when it gets awkward over the paying part, guys take it as a sign that you are not interested in letting them make you happy. its like, they think you think they just want ass and that by paying they will get it. but in reality, they are just assuming the role that was passed to them by society as the ones who pay for dates...its that simple.  6.  Fuck the guy -- opposite of the no kissing thing would be the fucking of the guy on the 1st date. By me saying this i endanger myself and all men who know the girls reading this, but... i dont care how well you spark or how well things click or if you just want to jump a hot guy you go out with for the 1st time. if you fuck a guy on the 1st date, he will just want to fuck instead of go out on dates, and you will have sealed the fate on anything more than being a fuckbuddy. (1st date anal is allowed)  7.  Reveal too much fucked up family info -- If conversation is going really well and the guy asks about your childhood or your parents or your family situation, it would be EXTREMELY advisable to not reveal too much fucked up shit about your family on the first dates. if you have a funny little story that can relate their craziness to something relative, by all means. but a guy will freak out if he finds out your family is fucked up. deep down in the guys brain a little buzzer goes off that one day your fucked up family could be his fucked up family. you have to ease a guy into this idea.  8.  Complain about things related to the date -- If a guy plans a date and really puts time and thought into it, he is not doing it for his own enjoyment, he is just trying to make the girl have a fun time so she will go out again. If a girl complains about how bad the food is, how slow the service is, how the summer is just too stifling, how the concert was bad, how the movie was boring, etc... the guy takes this as a personal mark on his ability to plan something fun. If you dont like the person, you are allowed to end it whenever during the course of the night. But if you dont like the activity, you really shouldnt complain about it until 3 minutes after he drops you off and you pick up your lar and dial all your yatchy friends to tell them about how shitty it was.  9.  Ask the number question -- Yo, until sex is in the picture, it is not cool to blow up a guys spot on this issue. Just like in American Pie, most guys will lie no matter what and then they have to stick with their lie later on about the number. Also, no guy wants to hear early on what a girls number is. if its low, they assume one thing and if its high they assume another. same goes for the girl. wait until the situation is more comfortable and less prone to full out lying to ask this question.  10.  Drag a guy to shit he would never normally go to -- now i know this is sometimes unavoidable, but there is a threshold of pain with guys and it can be reached very quickly with mentions of the words opera, play, broadway, susan sarandon, speaker, womens march, bon bons, ice skating, shopping spree, etc etc... you get the idea. if it is something you are passionate about then hopefully the guy will see that, but if it is just downright misery and you know the guy doesnt want to go to it, why put him through it at all? wouldnt you rather be happy with friends than miserable with a boyfriend?  Comments are more than accepted and encouraged.

      By now, if you are near a city with a six flags establishment (29 currently open), you have undoubtedly seen the commercial where the weird old guy dances around like a schmuck and gets people excited about going to six flags. He doesnt really do it for me, but maybe thats because he looks like a cracked out mix between Sopranos' Uncle Junior and cigar legend George Burns  ( urlLink linky... just in case )                    Theme parks have to be one of the best possible ways to gain some adrenaline, drop a boatload of cash, and if youre hi you know its gonna be a fun ass day.  Before I do a list of top rides that I have ever been on, let me just say one more thing. The pirate ship concept, the idea of the stomach drop, has haunted me since i was a little boy. When i was about 8 i got on a pirate ship and definitely yarled all over the clothes of myself and my fellow landlubbers. it was a sad day in my life since it takes a fair amount of shit to get me embarassed. i tried again when i was 17, same exact shit. there are chronic bedwetters, i guess i am a chronic pirate ship puker. or maybe i am just the chronic, byatch.       List of My Top Rides in the USA (that I have ridden)  (fuck) Paramount's Kings Island, Cincinatti OH   The Beast   Still the World's Longest Wooden Roller Coaster for over 20 years. The legendary Beast still seizes it's prey in it's terrifying grip, roaring through the wilderness on 7,400 feet of track at speeds of over 60 mph through dark tunnels and it's signature twin helix! Consistently named the best wooden roller coaster in the world by enthusiasts everywhere, don't miss your chance to feel the grip of The Beast!       I just love the feel of the wood as my body gets whipped around faster than Martha Stewarts spatula.     Paramount's Kings Island, Cincinatti OH   The Vortex   Get ready for the twisted world view of the Vortex! Scream through 6 terrifying inversions at speeds over 55 mph through 3,800 feet of the most twisted track ever built! The worlds first 6-inversion coaster is still one of the most intense rides around.      Six Flags Great America, Jersey   Superman   The only coaster of its kind in the Northeast! Riders lie down, facing the sky, then fly head-first through tortuously twisted steel track -- diving into highly banked curves, spirals and a jaw-dropping, pretzel shaped, inverted loop.   Height: 115 feet Speed: 60+ mph       Six Flags Over Georgia, Atlanta   The Ninja   The Black Belt of Roller Coasters! Sleek, black trains accelerate to speeds up to 55 mph, trains swing freely from side-to-side a total of 180 degrees through high speed spirals and sharp turns. Height: 122 feet Speed: 55+ mph        Six Flags Over Georgia, Atlanta   The Great American Scream Machine   Stretching 3,800 feet in length along the banks of the Chattahoochee River, this enormous coaster sends riders blurring past beautiful riverside scenery at speeds over 55 m.p.h. In 1973 it was the tallest coaster in the world at 105 feet tall. Still considered among enthusiasts to be one of the greatest coasters in existence, the Great American Scream machine was built as a monument to the era of the first modern roller coasters and the great designers who created them. Known for years throughout Atlanta and the Southeast as a rite of passage, no trip to Six Flags Over Georgia should be considered complete until you've counted yourself as one of the over 40 million park guests to have screamed from the top of this classic coaster.  (42&quot;)        One thing that sucks about theme parks now is this new concept of like a SuperPass or a ExpressLane or whatever the hell creative name they call it. I thought that if you paid a flat fee you wait in line like everyone else. What a fucking rip to charge people additional huge fees to be able to skip the line. I would never pay it, but I am more pissed about the fact that all these theme parks who endorse said program seem to have forgotten the purpose of their thrill park. Its about the fun the guests are having, not how much coin you can make on super slushies and glo stick necklaces. Or, if you just hate lines, lines, LINES! you could just make a million dollars and get yourself one of these:

      Senior year of college. Spring break. 11 of the rowdiest people i know on Carnival Cruise Imagination lines. Me, Viz, Bizzorn, Fucks, Shits-on-floors, Skance, Nickdaddy, Cornhole, Bails, Dooshtin, Grizza. 5 day cruise to several islands, most important stop being ochos rios, jamaica.  We are amped...after staying the night at Greenes palace in Ft. laudy-dady, we roll to the ship and after several drinks on the top deck, we have to check in to our muster stations. Lucky for us this boat is filled with hot women. So we're mustering with some ladies and we realize early on, every single girl on this ship wants to get laid just like every single guy on here. For some reason, cruise ships more than any other vacation spot are the most likely place for that quick week fling.  All guys have used some form of this saying at one point or another: youre never going to have to see that girl again so you may as well go all out. Its a lot easier to say than to do, but on a cruise ship when you have 10 of your buddies to laugh at you if you get denied or rejected, it becomes more of an entertaining game than anything else. And these yatches are playing right into us. Within the first 5 hours on board, we already have two little crews of chicks hanging off our junk.  Some of us are more successful than others. viz is eyeing this girl who looks real good, but they got off on the friendship tip talking about puppy dogs and ice cream. he's pulling tongue all night, thats about it. dooshtin has found himself in the worst situation, trying to make a girl from a cruise become his girlfriend. not smooth. Of course there always has to be a shady move or two.... bailey has decided to hook up with a girl who is there with her parents. she cant really drink on the ship since she isnt 18 yet, and we are all wondering what the FUCK he is thinking. but hey, if matthew mcconaughey can pull it off i guess so can shady-bailey.  so now to the fun part, jamaica. we decide to all go on a 50 man sailboat thingy with plenty of rum punch. it stops off at a waterfall that tons of tourists climb and take pictures and all that isht. we are obviously going to buy pot and wouldnt you know it, I was elected to carry the cash and to sneak the pot on board. Now I am not calling my friends little bitches for making me take the fall if we got caught...but, they kinda were being bitches ya know. so we get hammered. all the people on the booze cruise are a little frightened at our ridiculous behavior but like i said before, we didnt give a fuck... we would never see them again.  We start climbing this waterfall and there is just a huge line of tourists from the bottom to the top making their way slowly up this thing. jamaicans are there to guide and take pictures if any families want to take one home. Of course, with such high profile access to tourists, 90% of the photographers are also pot dealers. so the first guy comes up to our group and of all 11 people, who does this guy pick out of the crowd to try to sell the pot to? you fucking know it. me.  Hey man, where you from?   Kentucky.   oh ya? ive been there--you want some weed?   how much?   30 for this eighth.   no thanks man.   Someone told me before i got there to be patient, you will eventually find a sweet deal. 40 for an eighth, 20 for schwag, 50 for a quarter. sold. he gives me the pot in a little film canister and i throw it in my cargos. back to the ship, i have no towels or bags or anything, were all good and in business baby. cornhole bought the pipe on shore, good to go.  Then we get back off the boat and me, skance, grizza and katz decide to go waverunning. The guys take us right from the ship and boat us over to their little patch of sand where there are like 20 jamaican dudes just laying around all high and shit on the beach. they only have 2 waverunners so we have to take turns. katz and grizza go first, me and skance hang on the beach. hey mon, do you smoke weed? i turn around and there he is.  age: 40ish. gray hair. ice cold pot necklace and some beach shorts. 4 teeth. name: kingpin.       Now before I continue on, those of you who dont know me as well wouldnt know that i have some weird germ issues. like i cant share toothpaste because people rub the end on their own brush and then its like salivay.  i rarely share drinks. using someone else's shower shoes is a big sin. you get the point.  In my face is a big fat joint being handed to me by kingpin himself.  Come in here , he beckons, as he disappears into a little surfboard teepee. not one to pass up an opportunity, i take the gummy, gnarly, semi-nasty joint from kingpin and throw it to my lips. when youre in jamaica and a man with 4 teeth and the chronic hook up is asking you to puff his joint, do you do it? the answer is of course: hell yes. so me and skance are smokin the ganj when skance busts out with the question:  hey man, do you have any crank?   WOAAAH lorda mercy. no mon. none of that here. were only about this , as he picks up his bling and shows lance the nice pot leaf. to make a long story short, lance and i had a kickass time riding the waverunners, kingpin tried to shake us down for cash for the joint plus to give him any pot we bought in jamaica so we didnt get busted by carnival, the whole ship reeked of pot after the jamaica stop, viz remained a virgin, dooshtin did in fact date the girl for awhile, and on the last night when there was a tiki party on the top deck, i remember all of us shotgunning about 4 or 5 beers with tons of people chanting "LANCE, LANCE, LANCE, LANCE" and then skance taking the empties and crushing them on his forehead.  on the last night, the tokers gathered on the back deck and ceremoniously tossed the pot and pipe off the boat into the ocean. ill never forget that gummy joint and of course, my chronic 2002 hookup in ochos rios, kingpin.

      Every Monday I get in here and feel like peter from office space... spacing out for a good hour, trying to collect my thoughts, wandering around on the internet looking for funny shit to talk about. If i find something later, maybe I will post 2...for right now, let me just do some Hodgepodge.  By now I am sure you all have heard of this dude Ken Jennings who is on a 29-day tear of Jeopardy! He is getting close to a cool million in prize winnings. This guy doesnt just eek out the wins-- most of the games I have seen he tags em, bags em, skins em, and sends them home with cab fare. My question is, can the producers of Jeopardy not find one guy or girl in this entire country who is not smarter than fucking Ken Jennings. My 2nd question, conspiracy theory style, is do they really want to? ps--Chiu was on Jeopardy in middle school and he did real well, his only problem was the fact that he had no balls. (no guff, g)       Went to the  urlLink Clermont Lounge  again this weekend. This time I was not with the ladies, i was with jonny mcfuckstick and his buddy from prudential, nascar john. so katz was decidedly anti-dancing...more DIRECTLY: anti-even-trying-to-shake-his-ass-with-hot-girls. But as usual, the seedy claremont was a good time had by all. the "new guy", ya know the one who has heard all about the claremont but hasnt been inside its doors, will not shut the fuck up about how he is getting married and he keeps looking at hot girls and he wants ass still, etc, etc. There is one fine truth in this world: to a man who needs affirmation that he should stick with his current cute fiancee, there is no place greater to gain those feelings than the Clermont Lounge. One look at the strippers there makes me want to go home and fuck  my  wife. so the test tube shot lady comes by....do yaaallll wanna shot? no thanks, we have drinks coming. oh come on, a shot fer eachuya. no no, its ok. not even between my titties? (oh my god lady....  no !, not even between your titties)  Something really amazing happened in this town over the weekend, but i bet 5% of the atliens even know about it. The problem with Atlanta is they have great fucking sports and no one gives a shit about them. I mean they do, but they dont. They care, but there is definitely apathy in the air. This weekend, the Braves played the phillies (#1 NL East) up north and were only two games back after sweeping the Expos in their series. Friday the braves blew a 6-2 lead to eventually lose it in extra innings. saturday and sunday, the braves rolled and saved 2 games respectively to take down the leader in the NL east. Before this weekend, the braves were tied for 3rd with the mets. After this weekend, the Braves are in 2nd place and have  urlLink won 8 of their last 10 games . This is the 13th year in a row that the braves have had a winning season up to the mid-point, the all star game. Look for them to continue to roll to the top and keep smoking teams.  Mexicans are running rampant in this town. Im not sure if thats a good thing :) I think its ok... it comes with good and bad. The bad news is, they probably account for 2 of 3 of my car stereos getting stolen. The good news is, they are getting jobs at the finest burrito joints in town. I love that in atlanta, qdoba is run by three mexicans who dont speak a fucking lick of ingles. in louisville, qdoba is run by a bunch of white middle-class high school kids who dont know the first fucking thing about wrapping a burrito. same with kroger. its sweet. speaking of mexicans, i saw sergio this weekend when i was sober and pool crashing with the deephs. he is not a figment of my imagination, sergio really does exist.  outtie belly buttons occur totally by chance. there has never been a proven reason for outties, and they account for about 10% of the population. Basically outties are just scar tissue that never really fell off after the umbilical cord was cut. outtie belly buttons can be pierced, but only by the best...most will become infected and not work out. plastic surgery is safe and people can get their outties taken care of at any time. i have never hooked up with an "outtie" and i hope to never hook up with one in the future.  granberry. its not cool to request a shoutout. especially on another dudes blog. thanks for the insight and critiques this weekend. i am just prodding you so that you will respond.  Have a wonderful case of the mondays.

      Meg Ryan and Billy Crystal put the topic of faking an orgasm on the map in their 1989 film "When Harry Met Sally."    Sally Albright: Most women at one time or another have faked it.  Harry Burns: Well, they haven't faked it with me.  Sally Albright: How do you know?  Harry Burns: Because I know.  Sally Albright: Oh. Right. Thats right. I forgot. Youre a man.  Harry Burns: What was that supposed to mean?  Sally Albright: Nothing. Its just that all men are sure it never happened to them and all women at one time or other have done it so you do the math.  The idea that faking an orgasm is one-sided is actually quite preposterous. By nature, it is much easier for a woman to fake than a man. I mean, lets look at basic anatomy and you know that a girl doesnt have to prove anything beyond a few moans, a little arching of the back, deep thrusts, fall down tired as hell. If she's really good she can even do a little contraction action to throw the guy off. Women are also generally better actors than men, they pay more attention to detail, and since they have allegedly been faking all their lives, they have some pretty good practice.  In a survey taken of 15,000 website visitors, 70% of women and 25% of men have admitted to faking or acting out their shit with their partner. The low male percent is probably due to the fact that a man's fake orgasm has to be thought out, contrived, planned, and most importantly-- to not get caught.   But why fake an orgasm at all? Women and men have a plethora of different reasons for faking, but the #1 answer by both men and women is: to make their partner happy. Women know that the best way to stroke a guys ego is to make him feel like a fucking master in the bedroom. Most men just want their woman to be sexually satisfied, regardless of their personal pleasure. And therein lies the problem... neither sex is cool with the other faking an orgasm with them. We are both guilty of it and yet we continue to act out our pleasure to make the other partner feel like they are giving some seriously good deep dickin'.  There  are  good reasons to fake... lets say you just downed about 12 jack and cokes and you get home from the bar and you throw on your little hat and start pounding that headboard. the girl is a freak and she is just going fucking nuts over this "d" sex. lets say she doesnt fake it...in fact she is such a porn star that she has 3 orgasms before you even get close to the point of no return. i mean with the whiskey and the sweat and the heat and the screaming, you can't find pleasure for yourself-- this chick is having enough for the both of you and half the neighbors. So you do what any man does. You go wild for about 2 minutes, dig nails in a little, throw it as deep as you can, and let out a little groan...maybe even a shudder for effect. but now its crunch time... you have to get this yatch off your dizzl, go to the bathroom, wrap it up in as many layers of TP as possible, and throw it away deep in the trash can so she doesnt go looking. then you have to come back and pretend you dont have a case of blue balls, spoon positions #1 and #3. it sucks. faking sucks.  VERONICA: You show some bedroom proficiency, and you think you're gods. What about what we do for you? DANTE: Women? Women, as lovers, are all basically the same: they just have to be there. VERONICA: Be there? DANTE: Making a male climax is not all that challenging: insert somewhere close and preferably moist; thrust; repeat. VERONICA: How flattering. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--Clerks Basically half of the men and women surveyed said they would have hurt feelings if they knew their partner was consciously making an effort to fake. 95% of men and women said they would NOT want their partner to fake for them. Since the reason for faking is to make your partner happy, and almost all the people having sex would not want their partner faking, doesnt it make sense that we should all just stop fucking faking?!?   I guess my perspective might be skewed because i am not married nor do i have a lady friend to speak of, but I dont understand why its so bad or shameful for a girl to be like: listen, buddy, you are not hitting the clit. at all. why dont you take me from behind so i can get off instead of this mindless pointless pleasureless sex? or what about: yo, this feels really good baby, but is there any way you can kinda widen your legs a little--ooooooh god, ya, right there, oh oh oh, peace.  If you dont have to fake, hey good work. but for the rest of you, lets just try to sit back and enjoy the sex for the sex and stop trying to hunt down this fucking o-word. if its not working out for you, i think it would be much cooler to be direct with the guy/girl about what is better and what works more effectively. i would much rather have a girl say do it this way than for her to have to fake, go tell all her gossipy friends, etc etc. If everyone stopped faking and started communicating we would probably be a lot better in this world. Thank you, have a good fucking weekend. (no pun intended)

      About a year or two ago, I actually said the following: If I could invest in one thing, even though its not really a tangible investment, I would definitely invest in pakistani humor. Thats right, I happen to find pakistani humor outrageously funny. The inspiration for this little quip comes from a man i have known since 1st grade. His pakistani doctor parents were friends with my jewish dentist dad and since we lived close, went to the same school, it was only a matter of time before i was eating kashi and pad-see-u curry beef. Thanks Imran.  So I dont know if you realize this, but pakistani humor has been on the rise in this country. Sure it started off with a few minor roles, but it has really blossomed into something that adoring fans can laugh and play along with as these "foreigners" experience life in modern america.  Who was the first pakistani, decked out in head garb, strong indian accent, 8 babies, proprietor of his own business, the lord ganesh at his side to grace the pop icon stardom? Thats right, it was Apu Nahasapeemapetilon. This man has taken the lead role as america's most recognizable pakistani dude. His Kwik-E-Mart has appeared in tons of episodes and of course, Apu's quick wit, funny mis-pronunciation of the language, and hard worker vs. lazy american attitude have won him a spot in our hearts.     Since this list is being created on the fly, lets go to our next funny pakistani. His real name is Kal Penn and he was really born in Jersey, but lets pretend for a second that Taj Mahal Badalandabad from  urlLink National Lampoon's Van Wilder  is pakistani. This movie is one of the funniest generation Y movies that has come out in years...and what would it be without the help of the funny, wide-eyed lad from Banglapoor, India whose sole purpose of coming to America was:     "I came here to study the great American art of muff diving. To smack clam, munch rug, dine at just one American pink taco stand! You know, I wanted to, how is it, park the porpoise. You know? I want to take it through the car wash, baby. And get it waxed. I want to wax it. Wax it! You know, and air dry. Air dry that shit, yeah!"  Of course we could never make a list of funniest pakistani dudes in movies without  urlLink Samir Nagheenanajar , better known as samir nagana-nagana- not gonna work here anymore thats for sure. now even though his real name is Ajay Naidu and he was born in Illinois, he has mastered the not-knowing-english sense of humor that makes these characters so, so deep. top line from the movie is a tie between the kicking and punching of the paper jam or: Back up in your ass with the resurrection.     Perhaps this movie shouldnt even be mentioned considering i didnt see it. But i SWEAR that i said the whole pakistani thing before this movie was supposed to come out. So there is this movie called the Guru about an indian dude who comes to american and becomes an indian actor on the american (porn)screen. wow, this plot truly is full circle and stars an amazing amount of funny indian dudes in it.      Listen, I cant think of anymore right now (especially since Fez from 70s show is actually cast as hispanic) but you get the idea... indians/pakistanis are funny fucking people and they are going to be all over the american movie scene soon. i predict it. mark my words, etc etc. There is even a term coined for Indian actors on the big screen. Google it, Bollywood.

       urlLink I caant dooit kaptahn, I doont remembah a thing .  So I have a true confession. Heres the gist. This is taken from my memory so details tend to be hazy.  The last time I was up in NYC me and my boy katz stayed with asher. he lived on 56th and lex. Katz and I are bouncing around late night one night and we go to this little back door club around midnight. So we're vibing right. black chicks are hitting on me as usual. katz is eyeing some little jewish yatch but he knows she aint fuckin and katz fucks so this little chicken isnt gonna be around for much longer. my chick is british and the only problem with her is she is way too into me to be normal. not saying its hard to be way into me... its just, we just fucking met bitch. i dont know you. and i'm in nyc, so sketch factor is just implied. jewish girl hovers over her drink and gabs about how bitchy her mom is and how she talks to her every day, sometimes 4-5 times a day, even though they hate each other. all katz hears is blah blah blah, bl blah blah blah. I give what is known as the international sign for: lets do a lap. aww im sorry can you hang on one second, i have to go to the bathroom. see when girls say they are going to the bathroom, they go in there and talk to each other about the dudes they are with and what they should do. when guys say that shit, they are going to do a lap. to see the other action at the place instead of keeping themselves locked down at one specific vector, victor.  peace ladies. katz, lets see what else we got goin on in hea.  dude. stop. bro.   what?    bro.   what??   i swear to god, i think i see mary kate and ashley over there.   where?    there.   woah.   ya.  Sure enough, Mary Kate, Ashley, and their entourage of bodyguards were at this little shit cafe getting pounded on booze, laughing, gigling, like two little fucking bunny rabbits ready to be devoured and fanged by me and jonny mcpot here.  (move your mouse over this image)  urlLink    (you can tell them apart by their cute little eyes)  So I am pretty cocked and against better judgement I go to the jukebox to think of a kick ass tune I can dance to with Mary Kate. I think she is cuter, mainly because she is a little more emaciated than the other one. oops, i guess i should be more  urlLink sensitive to her needs . (i know my boy dwellis would scrub the milk off with a moustache ride)  So anyway, what better artist than the great  Jon Bon Jovi  Bryan Adams. C22. click click, spinnnn. guitar riff. i got my first real six string down at the five and dime. played until my fingers bled, was the summer of '69. ya, me and katz roll up to the olsen party of 9.  mary kate?   yes.   hey whats up, my names justin this here is my friend trent, we just call him double down.   hu hu hi im jonathan.   hey boys, nice to meet you.   ya so listen we're only in town for the night, we're producing a movie down in atlanta with miramax right now actually.   oooh really, i thought you looked kinda familiar.   aww come on mary kate, youre just saying that....   no really, i feel like i know you from somewhere.   well, i stalked ashley when i was 18 and she was 12...does that count?   what? anyway, dont mind him mary kate. would you like to salsa with me to this fine  bon jovi  bryan adams tune.   aww i would but wouldnt it be much easier if we just hopped in my limo and drove back to the Waldorf.   oh you have a room there too .  and a king size!   ya know what,  maaaybe  after me and my buddy here are done partying for the night, well see if youre still awake when we get back .  uh...uh...ok.   cool, maybe well see you two later.   And with that, I tap katz on the shoulder, bringing him back from his drueling over ashley's little mini skirt, give him a head nod and were off for the door. when we get out in the street, i pull out the cigs, whip 2 out, hand one to him, and light us up. why in the  FUCK  did we leave that bar shuster? dude, like the  urlLink tao of steve  says, "Be desireless. Be excellent. Be gone." After a few puffs katz lets it sink in and goes, booyakasha respect. Lets go get some of that Ray's Pizza dude.  The End

      Hello all you bloggerjockers waiting for words of my weekend. Deephs, there will be no long drawn out punking stories. Dudes, there will be no details. July 4th weekend? clipping nugs, braves day game 10-4 atl, decatur fireworks, hot little jewish girls from mctyeire, top shelf liquor parties, two proud american soldiers, lots of sex (not all me), drunk walks home, suntan, recovery, and now blog.  Why in the fuck do Germans love david hasselhoff. everyone says it, but does anyone know the answer?  urlLink Check this out : Top 5 answers by girls   Why do Germans love David Hasselhoff?   1) “No one knows the answer to this question. It's one of the more unsettling mysteries about the world we live in.” 2) “Do they? Interesting, very interesting!” 3) “Look at his last name, it's as German as Wiener Schnitzel.” 4) “3 things: pecks, Bulge, Talking Car.” 5) “Because that guy on SNL used to say so.”      That guy on SNL is the one and only Norm McDonald. His Weekend Update was the first to coin the now popular phrase. Here is some Hasselhoff background:  Despite his enormous success in television, Hasselhoff's childhood dream of a recording career had, by the late 1980's, yet to be fulfilled. However, that all changed when he recorded "Looking for Freedom," just at the end of the Cold War. The song quickly became an anthem for the German people and it raced to the number one spot on the German charts where it remained for eight consecutive weeks in 1989.  The album, Looking for Freedom, hit the top of the German charts as well, staying there for three months. It went gold and triple platinum in Europe while on its way to becoming Germany's number one selling album of the year. Hasselhoff was named "Most Popular and Best Selling Artist of the Year" in Germany.  For some reason, and I am guessing its because we don't support goobers in this country, Hasselhoff is just way more popular in Euro...specifically Austria and Germany. However, there have been some Americans who take an interest in Hasselhoff's stunning physique and the fact that "No other man has done so much for big chest hair and smooth chatup lines."  One pop culture icon has decided to team up with the other. Bringing the streets of Compton and gangstas of the streetz to his pad in paradise, Hasselhoff and Ice-T are actually neighbors out in cali. Ice-T wants to produce a  urlLink hasselhoff rap album . Hmm, good combo...i can definitely see this being a huge hit. Life is tough on the dirty sets of Baywatch and Knight Rider.  Not even Hasselhoff's daughters can stand their own father: Hasselhoff has just brought out a compilation of oldies called David Hasselhoff Sings America, but says daughters, Taylor, 13, and Hayley, 11, hate his music. "My daughters tell me to switch off my music when I play them my songs," he told German magazine Gala, "and they change the channel whenever Knight Rider comes on. It's embarrassing for them to watch their father in tight jeans and a stupid hairdo chasing gangsters on TV."  I wouldnt say embarassing so much as "throw up a little bit in my throat" downright revolting. What can we as Americans do to rid ourselves of the Hasselhoff phenomenon? I propose that we kill two birds with one stone. Scratch the Ice-T thing. Lets think of someone else who was really popular in the 80s during the Knight Rider era who would be perfect for a worldwide end-your-careers-and-live-out-your-days-in-germany tour?       (good find eh?  urlLink more pics )

      (I blogged twice today i was so excited...read both) Booyakasha, mad respect and big ups to my main mahn Marlon Brando. Youze a cool bloke, especially in the Godfather, the most massive gangsta flick evah.  Also happy birthday to bizorn. Hope you have a great freakin' weekend and have you some fun!  So I sometimes puff and decide to mix together the bombest CD i can come up with for the day. Here is one i did for this July 4th weekend.  01. Blind Melon - Pusher 02. Jack Johnson - Mud Football 03. Phish - Heavy Things 04. Pearl Jam - (beatles cover) Hide Your Love Away 05. track fucked up 06. Ben Folds Five - Underground 07. Incubus - Wish You Were Here 08. The Doors - Roadhouse Blues 09. Led Zeppelin - Dazed and Confused 10. AC/DC - If You Want Love You Got It 11. Beck - Loser 12. Jimi Hendrix - Along the Watchtower 13. Nirvana - Lake of Fire 14. Counting Crows - Murder of One 15. Blind Melon - Change (live) 16. Oasis - Live Forever 17. Pearl Jam - Better Man (live)  The problem with July 4th weekend is that no one ever plans anything to do. Then everyone scrambles to do something at the last minute and it is always semi lame. Hopefully my friend Coren can get his shit together and plan a bomb weekend getaway. Here is the email:   Hey all,      So, you haven't made plans for July 4? Good. If you have, change them. We're heading up to Helen, Ga -- with a trusty band of misfits hopefully -- for some fireworks, beer, lederhosen (remember Oktoberfest?!) and INNERTUBING (which will include all of the above) this weekend.       Helen is a crazy German hamlet in the Georgia mountains. It also hosts a beautiful stretch of the Chata "Rob's-mom's-a" hoochie River. For 3 bucks, you can float down the river, sip fine PBR-labeled beverages and toast this wonderful country of ours. There are also plenty of cool things to do up there regardless.       So, the caravan begins on Saturday and we'll come back at our leisure on Sunday. It shouldn't be too much of a trek. Write back and let me know if you want to go and invite your friends. I've never forgotten a trip to Helen.   Last time I was in Helen, Georgia I was a little pledge. They made all 23 of us drink tons of whiskey and then we all held hands in this long chain and had to skip down this huge hill in the middle of the night. Needless to say the 23 of us were rolling down drunk all the way to the bottom. Fun shit.     urlLink Oktoberfest    urlLink Troll Tavern    urlLink General Guide to an Amster-damn good time

      The other night I was out with dwellis and his zinger of a friend from home at Fontaines. An acquaintance who is by no means a friend of ours, we will just call him KB, came into the bar with a tough meathead i kick asses and take names look all over his face. Then I heard a little giggle and a murmur behind me coming from the bartender. giggle giggle...look...haha...his collar.  Thats right my friends, KB was rockin the popped collar.      The popped collar look is making a tragic come back. I dont know if its a geographical thing, a tough guy thing, a fonzie is cool and i am too kinda thing, but this fashion disturbance needs to be halted, maimed, beaten, and thrown in the attic faster than a redheaded stepchild.  Its happening all over the country. Read what one Penn Business School student had to say about it:  Boys with pastel colored polo shirts, collar turned up in that "I'm-trying-to-look-like-I-don't-care-but-it-took-more-time-to-arrange-this-damned-collar-up" way. -- Charlene Ong, Wharton 2006    excerpt from thirtyfourth street magazine, philly  Thats right Charlene, its a travesty. Check out this coked out, washed out actor you might recognize from waynes world, tommy boy, or west wing.       I cant stress enough the need to get rid of this look. Or at least laugh out loud at the people who are trying to revive it when you see them again in a bar. No hitting a guy with glasses? aww horeshit, this guy needs one in the mouth and one in the stomach.          urlLink Funny article  from another college campus  Some words from the opposing viewpoint... urlLink real intelligent   An Entire urlLink  Online Club  devoted to hating on Popped Collars   urlLink A Little History Lesson  from someone a little older, a little more in tune.  The Fonz was a cool guy. We all know that. But his time has come and gone. People who pop their collars need to let it go. Just let it go, bra.

      So its been about one entire month of blogging. Somehow I have stuck to my guns and written every day but one. Now is where the shit gets thick....it is harder and harder to find things to dish on each day. But imma try. VH1 had a thing called hottest hotties and ya know, i figured i could be david spade-esque and comment on a few of them.     100  &nbsp;Amy Smart  Are you kidding me? 100?! Why dont the VH1 producers re-watch Road Trip and tell me the scene where she initiates a naked porn interview with Breckin Meyer is not one of the best nude scenes of all times    99  &nbsp;Gavin Rossdale  Confession: when i was in 8th grade and this guy was cool, i wanted his hair style pretty badly. didnt really work out for me.    95   &nbsp;Heather Graham  Roller Girl? way hotter than this 95 shit    81  &nbsp;Charlize Theron  She gives Angelina Jolie a run for her money... DSL competition is a lock.    76  &nbsp;Orlando Bloom  From what the women in my office say, this guy is more swooned over right now than the likes of brad pitt.    69  &nbsp;Sarah Michelle Gellar  Fitting # spot, but Cruel Intentions was a hot hot flick... I WANNA FUCK! come on, you cant beat that.    51  &nbsp;Nick Lachey  Does anyone else in this world think this little couple should disappear away from MTV and the public eye in general.    48  &nbsp;Julia Roberts  Whether its the bubble bath scene from pretty woman or the descending the stair scene in oceans 11, julia roberts is hotter than a 48    43/41  &nbsp;Mandy Moore/Katie Holmes  Mmmmm.... this would be my threesome.    38  &nbsp;Kate Hudson     You all already know how I feel....this is blasphemy    33  &nbsp;Gwen Stefani  Had a crush on this one forever. So hot when she is dripping sweat and kicking ass on stage.... no one else does that for me.    30  &nbsp;Denise Richards  Pool scene with Neve Campbell can never be wiped from my memory.    26  &nbsp;Anna Kournikova  Does this girl even play tennis anymore? I just kinda know her as the hot girl from the Enrique Iglesias video or the nice one with the sweet ass who moans when she slams it up.    24  &nbsp;Eminem  This one is random... although I know a ton of white girls who want to fuck a guy named marshall mathers. i guess i shouldnt hate, but this guy would probably say some fucked up shit in your ear while he's having sex with you.    22  &nbsp;Demi Moore  one word: milf    19  &nbsp;Jennifer Aniston  I think Jennifer Aniston is my #1. She is so so pretty, so funny, seems so chill in real life. She tops all these fools below.    17   &nbsp;Cameron Diaz  Definitely my #2. Cameron Diaz is soooo good looking.

      Well, for the people taking crazy pills out there, the reason for  vicklanta  will come to fruition tonight on ESPN at 8:00 pm. Finally after waiting out the entire NBA and half the MLB seasons, football order is being restored to the country. Here in georgia, shit is heating up....      - more and more #7 starter jerseys are popping up at the bling bling malls. - season tickets are completely sold out - the game of ' urlLink throw the jew down the well ' has been replaced by pickup games where everyone wants to be QB.  tonight's game doesnt mean that much for the ATL falcons. i mean, the amount of vick 'face time' is solely dependent on how many first downs he can eek out before they punt and he gets sidelined. matt schaub, rookie qb, should be pretty D though. i saw him in scrimmage, he's definitely better than washed up Ty Detmer.  about this time last year, michael vick was on his way to competing for the top spot of QBs in the league. since playoff games dont count for anything, and the sole purpose is to test out your new talent while getting your old talent back in the zone, vick decided to scramble out of the pocket and got sacked and fucked up his leg. ATLs hopes were shattered before they could even begin. the team fell apart from there, winning 3 games all season without him. When Vick returned to play, at the end of the season, with no real field experience for almost a year, a shaky leg, and a lost season, the falcons went 3-1 (when vick started).  so, what is to come of this season? who knows... the best part about ESPN not having any real game stats to compare vick to last year, he's the biggest wildcard in fantasy drafts this year (i think). he could shine or he could fail miserably. either way, the new coach and new manager and new offensive coordinator are hammering these guys with west coast offense routes. we picked up dez white from chicago. we have peerless on fly routes. a little warrick dunn slot route. he has a lot of tools to win games with... plus the stacking of D in the offseason, hopefully ATL will be able to compete in their heavy division. carolina and tampa bay have both been to the super bowl the last 2 years. new orleans has some ballers in joe horn and duece mcallister; plus aaron brooks has been getting better and better each year.  anyway, tune in tonight. i know i will. now on to more pressing shit...  is this girl on the olympic softball team not the fucking hottest blonde athlete ever? anna kournikova can suck my chocolate salty balls compared to this little vixen.      mmm, its nice...i like to touch. do you want i should touch? thats all i got. if anyone needs the hook up i got that too.

      Alright, so i never talk about work on this thing. ya know, being in the technology field i feel like some of my cohorts would somehow find it... general paranoia based off of THC intake. but today i will describe the deep dark secrets of the government food chain (GFC- everything here gets an acronym)  In the large scheme of things, this place falls under the bureaucracy of the Navy. Its because when US soldiers started contracting all kinds of fucked up VD and other shit that you catch when youre banging european prostitute children, they needed some research and work done on those viruses. it eventually morphed into what it is today, the last bastion of high-tech, high-research focused disease prevention for the US.  So you may or may not know this, but all government employees work on this thing called a pay scale. basically this means that you start at a certain level of salary. then you get promoted into further steps and steps, grade by grade, until you have reached the highest point. all your teachers have the same thing, so thats why they always bitch about not getting paid enough. the pay scale system of course sets up several truths:   1) You will always receive the exact raise, salary, benefits, etc, no matter what your work output is . obviously if you get fired, no dice... but that brings me to my next point   2) No one here gets fired.  It takes so much time and planning and budgeting and calculating to hire full time employees in this particular GFC. so that means once youre hired, youre here for the long haul. deeper implications of this issue, however, means that  NO ONE  gets fired... no matter how less and less you work each year, once youre up there in the payscale chart, youre secure in your job. idiots, uncreative thinkers, conservative politicos who have turf wars, technologically unsavvy IT bosses.... this place is the spot for you. as long as you dont fuck up too badly, youre cool for life. and if you do fuck up sorta badly, then that would be my next point.   3) Everyone at the top who fucks up moves laterally, not down.  Thats right, everyone is just asskissing up the food chain to their boss. Hopefully if they actually do real well, in other words take 100% of the responsibility with 0% of the recognition, then you are in line for a promotion. But since bosses dont like their staff to be at the same level, they will be promoted to a different branch. But lets say you blow the SARS response in hong kong or something.... thats pretty bad, but if youve got enough stars on your uniform, you just get moved to HIV or malnutrition or some other shitty branch chief job where you can fuck up again.   4) Lots of Equal Opportunity Employment going on.  There is definitely one thing the g-men strive for and that would be hiring people of all different races to work here. There are lots of black ladies in and around the office....which is fine by me, black women love me. Usually they are on phone or computer entry detail. Asians are kinda the lab rats or the IT people. indian guys are usually the phD's running the labs. jews are representing at an alarming rate in high up phD double degree crazy positions of knowledge. the man who is in charge of  all  response for bioterror scares in the US is a fellow MOT.   4) Just like in old British times ,  there is a clearly defined and very obvious caste system  at this place. this is my favorite part, because for some reason the only cool people in this whole building are at the bottom of the pecking order.        The bottom of the caste system is broken into two categories... janitors and the like are all 100% african american/asian/mexicano. they can be seen checking out the white bitches that roll in here trying to avoid all contact with floor moppers, chain smoking cigarettes ALL DAY long, laughing, havin a good time, etc. There are also like maintenance people, with that 1 or 2 year degree in engineering. They are cool guys but also invade on the younger 20-somethings with their tales of drinking and cavorting around and avoiding college. these people are really the only ones who have any conversation interaction with me during the day. Sometimes i wish they could smoke out with me just so they realize how crunk the local emory dank is.  Sometimes when i am walking through the hallways on my way to one of four places: coke machine, ciggy, bathroom, an actual meeting, i see these secret whispering sessions going on between coworkers. this place has a lot of dark and quiet little corners where there is no foot traffic for minutes at a time.... plenty of time to plot some crazy shit, bitch about a higher-up, or discuss things 'off the record' and 'out of the ears of those around us.' one time i hooked up with this cute little yatch at work... i know youre not supposed to, but it was all good. the next day my coworker was like wanna go have a talk outside? so we stroll to the outside catwalk and she proceeds to tell me who is getting fired friday... yatch being one of them. i couldnt contain my excited glee well enough, whew it was a close call. it was starting to get awkward for like the whole day... anyway the point is, scary shit is discussed in little voices deep in the sub basement hallways here.  That is basically all i can think of so far. This place is a political fiasco and unfortunately i have no fucking interest. But, i do enjoy my day. i get to blog for a good 25% of it. If you havent entered the world of white collar wonder, just remember-- when there is a birthday party, make sure you get a piece of cake   every time   and of course, wear a rain coat. peace.

      Tight rhymes. Tight crew. Tight haircut. Eminem is a baller, and cant no one fuck with him. But what burns inside his heart? Who does he long for? What is he passionate about in terms of  world philosophy ,  values ,  child rearing ? These are certainly buzz words around em's posse, d-12, the phattest boy band around. but today, we are going to skip those nonsensical and otherwise unfunny interview concepts and cut to the shallow side of a multi-million dollar white rabbit hip hop star.   10. So em, lets cut to some real dirty dirty secrets about your past. where are you really, really from, like dont give us the detroit slum story.       Hey whats up vicklanta. thanks for makin the time. alright man, you want the truth. straight. my real name is marshall mathers. my real mom's name is debbie. but that lady you see in the media, the crazy lady, she is not my mom. i grew up in detroit, but we were pretty much a normal white middle class family. i basically murdered my real family, sold all our shit, moved to the streets so i could make it look real, then built up my skills on the street and signed with dre. he didnt know what hit him, and thats how i am here today.   9.   Crazy. So now that youre all up in the video, whats your next move.       Well as you know my boys d-12 put out a new album, i just been promotin that right now. i was thinkin of doin more movies, trying to expand my roles there. as you all know i dont sell out to product labels... but just this once, ive also been signed to do a new fanta theme song because that current shit is wack.      8.   Speaking of new albums, i have always wanted to know... why does it take so long for rap groups to come out with new albums. why cant you just cut one a year like rock groups?       The answer to that one is pretty simple.... we do it when we run out of fucking money. Bling costs money. Jags cost money. Rims and tims cost money. hoes cost money. my hoes cost a lot of money...wish i could just kill these hoes. listen man, when you smoke the chronic all day and sit around in the pool and go to parties and vip your shit out, why the hell would you cut a new record. you just put it out when you need a uh, how do you call it, a rejuvey.   7. So what does brittany murphy taste like?       vanilla ice cream with cherries on top  what about christina aguilera?       cinammon apples   6. If you had to shoot one rap star in the face right now, who would get the bullet?       50-cent, for real. i know it may not kill him but someone needs to slap him upside the head. that mother fucker talks his mouth off too much. im all about the dollar who the fuck is 50 cent       5.   Does the US Olympic Dream Team stand a chance this year?       I dunno man, AI dropped that 3 ball buzzer beater to turn things around. But they did get smoked pretty badly. If theyre strugglin to keep up with the teams that arent even in it, hell no they got no shot. you know what sport i like? hockey. ive been trying to get my crew to roll out to Red Wings games but apparently, black people dont enjoy hockey. ive never understood that, ya know, being white and all.   4. Could have fooled us. So lets do some word associations.        Jigga.  pussy.       Puffy.  maggot.       Dre.  chronic.       money.  necessary.       mommy.  evil.       cankles.  dude what the fuck are cankles.  ya know, fat ankles....  oh, sexy.       3. If you could have sex with one female rap artist who would it be.       hmm, that list is kinda long. beyonce is at the top. eve. lil kims tittie. missy -40.   2. Would you ever let your daughter Haley and Lil Romeo do a duet, maybe like a hip hop version of the popular white Grease song 'Summer Nights'.       these are the fucking dumbest questions ive ever heard. why dont you ask me about d12. i know you want to promote my crew like we agreed to over the phone....   1. To settle all controversy over this issue...would you ever, ever, ever marry or even have sex with a fan of yours who loved everything you rhymed about and would do whatever you wanted, the only catch being that she is a nice jewish girl..would you ever bone her?       sounded good up until that whole jewish girl thing. nah, not my style. all jewish girls can officially stop sweating my nuts! it aint gonna happen.      here we see em with his WT mother

      I dont know how it is in most bars throughout the country. Some places play their own shit and thats cool, they have to impress the customers with the dank tunes. But a lot of the bars i attend tie their main music line to a jukebox. and in most of the jukeboxes, the tune selection is wider than the grand canyon   or katzs mother  . here is the problem with the democratic system's influence on the jukebox: each paying customer feels that if they throw in their dollar or five dollars or whatever the case may be, they are entitled to choose whichever song(s) they want. this is simply not the case.  Before i get into that ( do the waynes world time warp thing ).... we're back at college frat nights with a lot of beer and testosterone-- not a huge party, just people over.   a: Hey man, lets kick those guys asses--in beer pong. we can smoke em in this next one.   b: true. hey gimme one of those menthols nugga  (  its a white wedding day.... plays in the background  )  a: oh man, fucking juice put this song on again... go hit the button.   b: tru  (  b goes to hit the button on the back of the jukebox and magically billy idol stops  )  party: blahblahblah no hitting the button! that was billy idol.   b: sorry dude, billy idol sucks, get over it.   OK, now flashback to normalville. the problem with the jukeboxes in a bar today is that there is no fucking button on the back. only in personal ones. now some of you might say whatever, the patron can play what they want... they paid for it. but i propose we rise up and say fuck that. fuck that shit. having a button on the jukebox is like allowing the other patrons a veto for their musical wants and needs. last night we were out at moes and hoes getting wings before entourage/ali g. some yatch goes to the jukebox and drops in 5 bucks for 10 songs. they were pure misery. i wanted the button like i wanted alotta fajina. and that leads me to....   The Top 10 Most "Deserving of the Button" Jukebox Picks  10. Meatloaf - I Would Do Anything For Love (But I Won't Do That) 9. Air Supply - All Out of Love 8. The Eagles - Take It to the Limit 7. Prince - Seven 6. REO Speedwagon - Cant Fight This Feeling 5. Rod Stewart - Have I Told You Lately 4. ABBA - Dancing Queen 3. Peter Gabriel - Big Time 2. Bruce Springsteen - Glory Days 1. Rush - Tom Sawyer  god damn i hate rush so very very much           So if you're at a bar and you see one of these neat swedish jukeboxes, dont hesitate to drop in some scrilla and pick some good tunes. But just keep in mind, jukeboxes are not anonymous... people notice who is putting in what songs. if you load a crappy song in there, you should be ready to get a beating. for the sake of everyone at the bar, just stick with the classics: skynyrd, ac/dc, hendrix genre. and the next time youre at a bar and a crappy tune comes on, check the back to see if there is a button. trust me, its time to bring this concept to middle america.  As always, comments are expected since i know people get heated on this topic.... did i miss any in the list?

      Well blogjockers, its friday. i dont understand why people in the city dont go to cool events for 5 dollars on friday nights downtown in centennial and instead just go to neighbors and bitch about the city of atlanta being a drag. blues traveler is my 1st destination tonight, from there who knows. hit me up in cellyville if you want in.  So I was strolling around on google news looking for some funny shit to write about, when i see about 5 stories that all tie into the same theme. And that theme is retirement. First off, the people who did retire but shouldnt have this week.   Ricky Williams  shocked the sports world this week when he announced that he was retiring early at the age of 27. he obviously had many years left to play. most of the sports media pinned it on Williams failing two tests for marijuana use. although he is the slipperiest running back in the NFL, he was on his way to hall of fame status when he just decided to drop trow and jet. yesterday he of course said he would come out of retirement-- for the oakland raiders. he claims its an offensive coordinator who used to coach him. i personally think its all about the pull of the california kushy. its got a smooth piney taste, much better than the mids he was getting in florida.  (mad shout outs to sensei xtreme)        Smarty Jones , almost-hopeful this year for the triple crown, was retired citing bone bruises and injuries. "Ya i mean, it was crazy. i was just minding my own business, eating my oats, when i stepped on this stray cat living around the barn. he just would not shut the fuck up, hissing and meowing, clawing at me.... i had to do what any horse would do, drop kick the cat clear out of the barn. needless to say, the whole event messed with me real bad." his booking agent had this to say-- "i mean, he's only 3 years old, seems kind of like a cop out. i'm not one to call people pussies, but smarty jones--what a pussy!"      And now moving on to the people who should DEFINITELY RETIRE ALREADY!    urlLink Madonna   announced today that she is opening up a $22 million school for Kabbalah in nyc. it is for children and educates them about the esoteric blah blah.... madonna, you are not jewish. like, at all. stop fronting. also, stop going on tour to promote your shitty new songs and stop changing your image every 3 weeks. stop singing. stop writing childrens picture books. the sex book called, it wants its old madonna back.    urlLink Brian Wilson   announced today that he would launch a US tour. He has already been playing in Euro to 'packed' clubs. Jesus christ man, you are a legend in the pop music world. everyone sympathizes with your afflictions. but please stop touring. you were a revolution in the 60s, but its 2004. your time is up.   Stephen Hawking  has graced us with a brand new theory on black holes.    The Euclidean path integral over all topologically trivial metrics can be done by time slicing and so is unitary when analytically continued to the Lorentzian. On the other hand, the path integral over all topologically non-trivial metrics is asymptotically independent of the initial state. Thus the total path integral is unitary and information is not lost in the formation and evaporation of black holes. The way the information gets out seems to be that a true event horizon never forms, just an apparent horizon.      I know its probably impolite of me to knock this guy, but if south park can then fuck that..so can i. dude, stop showing up in the Science &amp; Space section of my cnn.com you scare me stephen, with your mind control powers and your ridiculous astrophysical brain. your computer voice freaks me out anytime you go on a talk show. please get launched into a black hole to test its true parameters.  Dont worry straight men and women with better things to do,  Oprah  just signed a deal that extended her already ridiculous deal to broadcast through 2011. Fucking great. More books shoved onto the housewives and homemakers to read. More oprahganda for middle america who think they are hip by listening to a strong black lady. on a side note, katz after watching chapelles show said he too would fuck oprah and have her love child if it meant he didnt have to sign a pre-nup. sellout. Oprah, from the bottom of my heart, take the money and run. let someone else do the talking to middle aged american women... like sign up the dude from harold and kumar go to white castle who was also the dude in american pie. MILF! MILF!  Last but certainly not least,  el niño . didnt we retire you in 1997! god damn, quit coming back to the pacific coast. unless of course your nickname is el niño and you are really just alive and well and playing a sketch on saturday night live.

      As a new resident of the great state of georgia, i feel like it is my obligation to keep up with ATL sports. As blogula readers, you can take it or leave it. But! Atlanta sports are all on the up and up, even in the offseason.   Atlanta Braves  At the beginning of the season, the braves were abysmal. they were dropping games, dropping series... it was not looking good. They have made a few clutch trades and some of the new recruits are really starting to get good 'bats.' Andru Jones is knockin HRs. Giles and newcomer JD Drew are on fire as well. In the past 19 games (since the braves were tied with the phillies in the NL East) they have gotten 173 hits (avg: 9 hits per game) and 88 runs scored (avg: 4.5 per game). they have gone 14 and 5 since their tie, and now lead the NL East by 4.5 games thanks to philly choking as always post-all star game      Date  Opponent  Hits  Runs  Win/Loss    8/4/04  at Houston  12  5  W    8/3/04  at Houston  4  2  L    8/1/04  Mets  14  6  W    7/31/04  Mets  11  8  W    7/30/04  Mets  9  3  W    7/29/04  at Pittsburgh  10  3  W     7/28/04  at Pittsburgh  5  1  W    7/27/04  at Pittsburgh  12  4  L    7/26/04  at Pittsburgh  8  4  W    7/25/04  at Mets  7  4  W    7/24/04  at Mets  11  5  W    7/22/04  Pittsburgh  6  2  W    7/21/04  Pittsburgh  6  3  L    7/20/04  Philly  8  3  L    7/19/04  Philly  9  4  W    7/18/04  Expos  15  16  W    7/17/04  Expos  9  6  W    7/16/04  Expos  6  1  L    7/15/04  Expos  11  8  W       TOTAL    173    88    14W - 5L       tonight we'll see if the braves can win their current series with Houston, then its 3 more away games in arizona. they are in last place in the NL West but earlier this year Randy Johnson pitched a perfect game at ATL, so who knows how we're gonna roll there.   Atlanta Hawks   I pretty much cannot stand this team. I mean they are awful. Any team whose owner purchased through a package deal with two other teams and an arena cannot be good. Some of the few but strong players, namely Jason Terry, were the only thing holding this embarassing flop of a team together. But today, the Hawks decided to trade away Jason Terry, Alan Henderson, and a 1st round draft pick for Tony Delk and Antoine Walker.  Now some of you may not be tracking your kentucky basketball players in the NBA as closely as you should... but remember back in '95-'96 when the wildcats beat the orangemen? tony delk and antoine walker were on the NCAA championship team, coached by none other than the great now-UofL coach Rick Pitino. We are looking more and more like a semi-decent team thanks to all these offseason trades. 4 rookies is still a pretty high count, but they are trying to carve out a new niche in an otherwise misery basketball program.   So now we have: Josh Childress, rookie from stanford. All Harrington from the Pacers. Delk and Walker from the Mavericks. Chris Crawford at center. hey, it looks better than the roster at the end of last season. crawford is the only true remaining atlanta hawk.   Atlanta Falcons   Of course, the only team that shows true promise with a pretty much guaranteed result (excluding ridiculous preseason injury) is our NFL football team. I dont know if you all have been following all the trades and drafts, but the falcons really bulked up on defense, something that was severely lacking last year. This week we finally signed our last draft pick, DeAngelo Hall... he will probably replace cornerback Ray Buchanan, who had a low stat year last year. Dez White is a new and previously underused receiver from chicago, hopefully he will be making some hot plays. of course with vick scrambling and looking for peerless, he should be a top pick for fantasy teams everywhere. Warrick Dunn is healed and he and TJ Duckett should be trading off for some nice little run plays... probably not a good pick for fantasy unless one takes over the role full time. Jason Webster comes from San Fran after being injured last season... new coach, new offensive coordinator, new defensive coordinator, same sleezeball owner :) but yo, it should be a good year. i am amped for football to start.

      For those of you without the best channel on television (besides comedy central), you can read up on this show  urlLink here . Basically Marky Mark is back doing an hbo series about how badass his crew used to roll. it was like a bunch of brooklyn kids getting tossed into the hollywood scene. Basically this show only ignites two emotions out of me: laughter and jealousy.  The toppest of top shelf muff strolls around in every shot. its park avenue pooch if you know what im saying nyc. these guys have an unlimited reload supply of girls. they always take home girls. they can just show up and they have everyone looking at them. its sick, its revolting, and i am envious as hell. all in all though, the show is getting better every epsiode. i highly recommend checking it out.... i throw a little entourage/ali g party sunday nights. have your people call my people if youre interested.  Anyway, so I got to thinking...who in the world would i want in my entourage if i could form one. and here we go...  (this whole idea might be a little not hetero)    1. Ryan Phillipe      ever since Cruel Intentions i have been a big fan of this guy. he has mad style. i guess he is sometimes cast as the abnormal weird gay guy sometimes, but his handiwork with sara michelle gellar was outstanding. he also has a black belt, in case i sputter off at a party and he has to lay down an ass kicking on someone. i feel like he is pretty versatile and can click with a pretty random crew, which is what my entourage is.   2. Owen Wilson      this guy would be fucking hilarious to hang out with on a day to day basis. his sense of humor is always on the mark and his sarcasm is crucial to any posse of mine. i sense that he participates in a variety of extracurricular activity, mainly lots of pot smoking. although he claims he cant dance, his zoolander choreography is vital to the group while bouncing around from club to club. his 10mil salary for starsky and hutch could come in handy in the no-free-handouts department.   3. Urshur      Usher is definitely a main ingredient in this posse. he can rap, he can write, he can sing, he can dance, he gets so many yatches, he has tight chiseled abs...ooh a little too far. what? what? oooook! yaaaaa! so obviously you need to have some diversity in your entourage, usher would be my black vote. plus his bling bling connections and fubu bcbg fashion knowledge is necessary.   4. Breckin Meyer      This guy is already pretty good buddies with Ryan Phillipe, they are in businees with seth green apparently. (i didnt know that before this list) anyway, doesnt breckin meyer seem like a pretty chilled out funny dude to hang out with. maybe. as you all know, amy smart road trip scene was hot as hell... lucky mother fucker. anyway despite most of these people being married, i know that breckin meyer can hang out and booze and watch football and mack on girls with. he is a good addition. plus he's the same height as i am, he really ties the entourage together.    runners up:  5.   spliff starr from busta's entourage  -- once i saw spliff on stage with a condom for a hat and he was high as fuck from getting smoked out by my friend hoffman and he was just trying to get a jewish emory white girl to come backstage with him. anyone who walks into that lion pit can be in my entourage anyday.      6. Jason Statham (the dude from snatch and transporter) --  hey everyone needs a european dude in their crew...preferably one who doesnt wear tight leather clothes. i bet this guy could kill anyone who fucks with us. his humor is surprisingly fresh for a british person.

      So in a very similar fashion to Milton from office space, i also work in a cube in the basement of the cdc. No, i am not crowded by boxes and my trusty government stapler is still sitting here collecting dust since everything is done by .NET these days. The a/c has decidedly turned itself off and of course since the laws of the world dont apply to government buildings, cold air rises and hot air falls. i would say my case of swalls today at work is strong to quite strong. misery.  also today is a hodgepodge day. i mean i dont really have a specific topic like normal days. i will say that despite coren and chiu trying to send me material for this blogger, i saw the chapelle show thing already. i knew he would get a new contract, but it must be sweet to know you get a chunk of the DVD sale profits. chapelles show was the #1 tv dvd this year. he just inked a 2 year deal with comedy central... i hope charlie murphy and crew have some seriously funny shit lined up, i'm sure they will.  on another note, ala choogle, this article was pretty funny about  urlLink michael vick . i guess thats cool... might get a little nasty after awhile. nothing his hummer with the tint and the 22s cant handle. So i guess afro is the new way to roll in vicklanta. (we also got josh childress from stanford) does this mean that i can finally rock out my jew-fro and be fashionable? questionable.          last thing: i would say i spend about a good 15 minutes doing actual real work. (office space again) so here is what the breakdown of the rest of my thought pattern and general habits in life consists of:        two more things. since no one ever ever makes plans early, ever for the weekend... it would be fun to all meet up and get fucking crazy live jumping around and being insane in the membrane this friday. $5. and these guys:

      Just saying that name ignites strong feelings deep in my soul. I want nothing more than to stare into those deep gray eyes, stroke that coke-white hair, and hold hands with those green fungus laden fingernails. My loins ache for some grade-B homemade meatloaf and instant-mix potatoes, stir fry chicken with enough MSG to cause brain seizures, or the best salmonella chicken quesadillas you can stuff in your face.       Ray Pontes, a legend amongst a long line of strung out, fucked up, $500 a week chefs to stroll the chi phi kitchen. No one can beat the legend of Algie, the OG of chefs. But Ray certainly holds the #2 spot. More fucked up shit comes out of his mouth than any human being i have had the experience of meeting so far. here are the top 16 excerpts from the past 3 years of history.   Top 16 Best Ray's of Light   1.  me:Ray the milk is curdled, and it expired a week ago. Ray: Lemme see that.....(opens the milk up and drinks it)....Tastes fine...you see its not curdled it was just clumped together. me: Ray it expired last week Ray: They only put those dates on there for people like you who think they need good milk, it really doesn't mean anything.   2.  Harbutt: Ray you ever smoked crack? Ray: Hell yea, i used to make that shit too, its not that hard. I know someone who works here(cleaning crew) whose friends makes the best shit ever, only $100 a gram.   3.  ray" "the U.S. has concentration camps too" (comparing us to Germany) ray: " we just call em' reservations" me: "ray, we don't kill people or torture them on reservations" ray: "I've been to 2 reservations... half of em' don't even have plumbing!"   4.  Ray: "Fuckin a chick with huge meat curtains is like getting a blowjob from a girl with no teeth, which isn't bad by the way, it's different."   5.  "I used to get head from this girl with no teeth. She had a baby and she wasn't taking the right vitamins, and the baby just sucked all the calcium right out of her. After that, her teeth just kept falling out. But it's not too bad. She couldn't teeth you to death, just gummed you to death."   6.  Ray: yeah tons of famous people have done drugs, but you'd never hear them admit it Me: Oh Yeah? Ray: Yeah, you know Sherlock Holmes did coke Me: Isn't Sherlock Holmes a fictional character? Ray: well yeah...but the guy that wrote it did coke too   7.  So Ray is sitting at brunch with Buchman and me and he looks down at the egg yolk on my plate... Ray: "you gonna waste that yolk" Me: "yeah, so why don't you eat it?" Ray: "I don't want it, you probably stuck it up your butt and shot it back out again" Me: "uh... yeah Ray" Ray: "you know... like those college kids used to do with the Gerbils in the 80s"   8.  "You see, 150, 200 years in the future..." I interject: "We could be totally fucked at the rate we're going. I wonder if there will even be a Unites States." He continues: "Oh, the US will still be here, but what it is is, it will be all different. The whole country will be broken up into smaller pieces, you know, territories, and each territory will have its own government and they'll all operate under the main government."   9.  Guys, a little advice from Ray for the next time you are hooking up with a sketchy chick. "If you believe that this girl may have an STD, then stick your finger in your ear and get some ear wax and rub it on her pussy. If it stings her, then stay away." Wow.   10.  So I'm talking to our beloved Raymond this morning at brunch about puffin' herb and he relates the following information to me concerning his past:  "I smoke and I smoke a lot. I've always partied hard and now I'm getting old and mellowing out a bit. See what it is is I don't drink so much anymore but I still smoke. But I don't get this real expensive shit that's out there now, I don't need to be spending that much money when I can still get very good shit for much much cheaper. What it is is I have connections. I go where no other white people go because I know some real rough fellas. You know those stun guns, you know cattle prods? Not the new kinds that are pussy shit but the old kind that were big like this (indicating with his hands the length of about a yard) - well I used to carry one of those around all the time, you know, tucked into my belt. Shit, I used to zap people with that thing and they'd shit and piss their pants while flying back a good 4 feet!! Those were the days. I made a shitload of money doing that shit too. But now I'm mellow..."   11.  (from skance)Today at lunch, sometime around 12:30, I was eating my philly, minding my own business when all of a sudden I hear Ray's voice from right behind me saying something about bowling balls and bowling alleys, then I feel little grubby hands on the top of my head and the cackle that louis has nightmares about. If I didnt like to eat so much I might have killed the little fucker, but now I just have to live with this for the rest of my life.   12.  After I finally convince Ray to cook me a shitty egg roll while having listened to how he appreciates Black History month as he enlightened me with his knowledge about the native american influence on the first 500 miles of the underground railroad, Ray comes out and says "I am going to fuck the shit out of that sales lady on my birthday"..."Really Ray, the monarch lady? How are you going to do that?"...He says, "Cocaine man, chicks dig that, i'm not stupid. I was a player before there were players".   13.  See when a woman starts getting violent you really need to knock her out. Don't try to reason with her or stop her cuz women don't fight like men do. They go all psycho and shit and they'll try to kill you. I'm serious. That's why you gotta knock 'em out cuz they really will try to kill you. Then they'll be sorry when it's too late and you're fuckin' dead. You gotta knock 'em out.   14.  So I am in the process of obtaining some corn dogs when "Stairway" comes on the radio. Ray says, " You know I hate this fucking song. Well, I hate it but I love it." Why is that Ray? He says "You know, you are dancing with a girl, makin out, and talkin all sweet in her little ear. Next thing you know you got a boner goin on. Well the reason why I hate it is because as soon as your boner pops up the song cuts to that fast part and you have to pull away. Now for the rest of the night you have to walk around lookin like a tent. I hate that fucking song"   15.  "When I used to deal in Miami, i would just roll into a club with a vial of coke...the uncut stuff. I would just drop it on the bar and the first girl to ask me about it, we went out back and we blasted it...their whole face was numb. I didn't even know her name...no drinks, nothing....when it was silent for too long, i just asked 'wanna go snort some more? Then I'd just see if she would come home with me...'by the way, what's your name?'"   16.  Ray: This place looked like a shit hole this morning, you fuckers party every night of the week dont you? Me: Well some of us do, others of us were studyingRay: Well you guys need to get a fucking bum to camp out in your backyard. That way he can come in and clean up the cans. Before you know it, he will be able to buy a condo for himselfMe: Cool Ray, thats not a bad idea, I will have to talk to tyler about that idea. After long pause...Ray: You know those homeless people will eat anything, you could probably have them clean up the puke in the other room too. You get what I am saying?Me: No Ray, what are you saying?Ray: I am trying to say that he would eat the puke! how dumb are you kids!   Ray Pontes still works as the Chi Phi cook. he makes $500 cash a week.
