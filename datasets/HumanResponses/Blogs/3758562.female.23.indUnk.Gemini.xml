      I guess for those that don't know me, I should introduce myself. There isn't realy much for me to introduce, but I will give it a go anyway. I am 23, very happily engaged, and live just outside of Ballarat in Victoria.  The town I live in has nothing in it except a very old and unused cemetery. If we want our mail, we have to drive 10 minutes to the next town, to pick it up from the post office/general store there because they have decided they dont want to deliver it anymore. :(   My fiance (My Prince Charming) and i have been together almost 7 months now, and had two dogs until a few days ago when one of them decided to give birth to 7 puppies. That means that we now have 9 dogs to run around after.  The worst thing is that the little bitch got pregnant before me. How rude!!! As you may off guessed, we are trying for kids. The worst thing is that i feel and look(according to my fiance) pregnant, but i have to wait until monday to find out what the results of the blood test are. I had the test done yesterday(friday), but they were to slack to get them to the doctors before closing time, so i have to wait all weekend! The wait is killing me...as well as the nausia, tiredness, grumpyness, cravings, sore tits and all the other things i can find to complain about.  Well there isnt much more that i can tell you about myself, other than, i have such a boring life that i am sitting here watching some crappy old movie, and listing to the dreadfully boring ballarat radio. On top of that, i spend most of my spare time knitting baby clothes (well i try to, but it is harder that it looks).  Well thats about it for now, i will tell you more when i can decide what the hell anyone wants to know  Ciao

       I have decided that it is time for another update on the happenings in our little world. I have turned into such a scatter brain that most this probably wont make sense, but what does it matter, this is just a collection of my ramblings anyway.   I dont know where to start, so i will just pick a subjet and tell you all about it. Thanks to many unfortinate happenings, we need so much money for so many bills, that i think we are going to need to call on   urlLink  Bill Gates    soon. It has gotten to the stage that my future mother-in-law has had to borrow money off her father-in-law inorder for us to remotely get by. The problem is, it is bearly the tip of the ice burg. I have worked out that if we sold every possetion that have, we would be no where near pay what we owe. The problem is, in a couple of weeks after the court case, we are going to have even more debt and only one person able to drive. On top of all of that, we still have all these bloddy puppies distroying the house and eating a ton of food.   Anyway, onto something that may be a bit more interesting. After much frustration over life and our phone been cut off again, we had the bright idea to visit my future-in-laws at 4am yesterday in the hope that we maybe able to get a smoke(we had run out 2 days before) and some food because lately all our food has gone on the pups. I knw that we should of just   urlLink  quit   , but fuck it, i need something.   Anyway, after driving all the way down there (about 2 hours), we woke my future mother-in-law with a fright to discover she had no smokes, but did have some good news. The money she was borrowing for us would be coming through anytime. So on that note, we decided to go and have a chat to a   urlLink  friend   . The highlight of that visit would have to of been when his father decided to stand at the door while we sat in the car chatting and try and convince him to come inside as it was late ect. Sometimes i realy wonder why parents bother. Once a kid hits 18, they are beyond your command.   Anyway, back to the in-laws we went. There we were greeted by a great suprise. There was a packet of smokes waiting for us. After having a smoke or to in the cold, I feed my face on sandwitches while   urlLink  my prince    watched and pretended he wasnt hungry. My future mother-in-law then kindly gave up her bed for us so that we could get some sleep. Two problems...One it was a bloody water bed. I have never slept in one before and dont wish to again. Second, we had been on the go for so long that we couldnt settle, so we put the tv on and dozzed for a couple of hours.   After been waken up (by means that are unmentionable) by   urlLink  my prince    after 2 hours, we joined my future mother and sister-in-law in the kitchen. They were ment to leaving at 8.30 to go to tafe and look after my prince's nan. Unfortunately, future sis decided to get a   urlLink  migrain    and not go to   urlLink  tafe   . The funny thing is, she was well enough to sit up and talk, help sort what car part we were taking home to fix the cars with, then go to her nans to do the gardening. They finally left 2 hours late, and let us have a couple of minutes peace and quiet. Dont get me wrong, i like my in-laws, but sometimes it can get a bit much when we are constantly being questioned or told what we should or shouldnt do.   We decided to do the right thing and call in on my prince's nan (the one that refuses to die, so it was yet another last visit). While there, we were feed fresh pies and then his nan gave me a cushion that she had made in the past. She seems to like me for some reason...old people always do.   When we finaly left there, we were ment to go straight home, but for some reason we decided to take a 45min detour and visit my mother at work. After that, it was on to he long and tiring trip home.   After a quick stop at the supermarket for yet more dog food and the post office to get the phone turned back on, we made it home. The minute we walked in the door, we wanted to leave again. The dogs had distroyed the house. After a quick call to my mother, we were free to finaly go back on the net.   Things wernt to bad until my my mother made her nightly phone call. It was durin this phone call that I was informed the engagement party that she is holding for us was what she wanted and nothing else. This whole party thing is a subject in itself so I will leave it for the moment.   I will depart form blog land now and go back to thinking about life and what I can do to escape this world where everyone and everything thinks that they are can control my life.

      I have noticed a trend in blogs lately. I would probably have to have one of the least looked at blogs, yet i seem to be the only one that is updating lately. There are 4 blogs the&nbsp; i regualy check, and all of them either stay the same or have been taken down. Is this a catching blog disease?

      I dont realy know what to write, but I feel like updating , so i think i will just ramble about the latest happenings.   I left the last post will a friend of ours staying with us but visiting another one of his friends. After we picked up our friend the next day, we had a night of fighting with the computer while we tried to copy and load alot of his sotware and movies. I have decided that I hate computers. Our cd drive has decided that it hates some brands of disk and wont read them at all. The funny thing is the computer was running ok until we copied all the stuff and loaded a couple of programs, now it is going haywire in all directions.   What can I say, it was an iteresting night of watching his films and looking at programs that will come in very usefull in the future (if the fucking computer works).   The next day after trying for about an hour to get said friend out for bed, we made a mad dash into town to take him to the station...the only problem is, he was to late for the train and had to wait and extra hour till the next one. After waiting on the cold platform and in the warm waiting area for about half an hour, his train departed and it was time to go shopping for my prince charmings birthday present. I think i should explian that it was accutally his birthday on that day an the present wasnt from me, but from my mother. She didnt know what to get, so i had to buy it with her money, wrap it, and give it to her to give to him. Even though i didn't give him a present, i did take him out for chips and gravy (our favorate meal to have together) and was able to give him some pleasure a couple of times.   Well that night ended with us cleaning the house and chasing the pups around in circles and trying to straighten out the kinks in the computer.   Well I will leave this here, and put the very interesting bbq that we had yesterday in another post.

      I have decided that the internet is an evil invention. It is great while it is working and doing what you want, but the minute you cant use it, for some reason, part of your life seems to vanish. Last night our net decided that it would let us sign in, but that is about it. We spent over 2 hours on the phone to our isp trying to solve the problem, but nothing worked. The strange thing is, it took a visitor using the computer to make it work.  Our friend who goes by the name of  urlLink Filmmaker Extraordinnaire  has paid us a visit for a couple of nights. It has taken some time for him to finally make it up here after many months of problems. Anyway, after picking him up from the station, we told him that our net was down. He sat down at the computer and connected to the net. At first he had the same problems as us...then the little shit decided to work for him.  No-one can explain it, it is just one of those strange things. Anyway, I am writing this while our visitor is having a few drinks with a few of his mates at a local pub and will be staying the night with them. Best of all, we got to meet these mate and they seem like realy nice people...maybe we can make some friends up this way finally.  I guess there isnt much more to say for now...maybe once our friend is back here thing may liven up a bit.

      As I said in my last post, we have been cleaning the house out. Well I can honestly say that it has been going well and it is looking quite good, but for some reason, to us, it just seems so messy. I guess that it is because we know what we want the house to look like when we have finished. While I am on the subject of cleaning our house, I wish to explain something. I have been asked why we spent so much time cleaning it by a person or two that haven't seen the house. The fact of the matter is there were a number of factors. Yes the house was realy messy. The reasons for this are: The house was never properly sorted when I first moved in, and once my ex and his mate started staying here, it just went down hill because I spent half my time cleaning up after them. After i broke up with them, my prince charming moved in, he brought enough stuff to fill a whole house. We never realy got around to sorting everything out. Then, just when things started to get sorted, we got invaded by mice. So inorder to clean the kitchen alone, everything (and i mean every fucking thing) in the kitchen had to be cleaned. Do you know how hard it is to wash everything that you have in a kitchen, plus cleaning all the cupboards and other surfaces when a mouse has spread flour and shit everywhere?  Anyway, enough about that. I have another thing to say about mess. Do you know how much 6 puppies can make while you are trying to teach them how to drink formula out of a bowl? They sit in it, they walk through it, they roll in it...anything they can do to make a mess they do. Then they winge when it runs out!!! Mind you, it is very cute.  Anyway, enough of my winges...back to withdrawing from the smokes and coke...catch ya latter

      Ok, I have decided that the world has gone mad. By now i am sure that you all know that I have strange relationships with my bio-logical and step parents. This weekend those relationships have become even stranger. I will attempt to put all of this in some sort of understandable order.  It has been know for quite awhile between my family and myself that my house needed to be cleaned from top top bottem and re-sorted. After an invasion of mice, this became urgent. The problem is, it is no small task to clean out an entire house when every little thing has to be cleaned and disinfected. To add more problems to the list, we are holding a bbq for  urlLink My Prince Charming's  birthday next weekend. That means that the cleaning had to be done now. After a week of clean with just the two of us, I gave in and asked my mother to come and help. Now, even though she had offered to help, i thought that when she got here i would of gotten a heap of attitude. You can imagine my suprise when she walks through the door with a smile on her face, gives me a packet of smokes and chatted away happiily. Her good mood continued for the entire day to the extent that when she hugged us good-bye, she almost snapped  urlLink My Prince Charming  in half!  I had just gotten over the shock of this when I received an email from my father tonight. Now the fact of the matter is that i try not to have much contact with him, and it has been great while he was having computer problems and couldn't email me, so I was a bit dissapointed when is name showed up in my inbox. The biggest shock of all was yet to come though. Now you see my father has met  urlLink My Prince Charming  quite a number of times and knows that we are engaged. Up until now, we have always thought that he approved(as best he knows how) of him. I found out the truth tonight. In the email he explained about his computer problems, then went on to ask how things were going with MAT. I know that i have never told you the name of  urlLink My Prince Charming , but i can tell you the his name is NOT Mat!!! Mat is one of my ex's that hurt me quite bad and my father knows this, so what is he playing at?  I will let you all know what happens when he gets the email that I sent back to him. Maybe I should send him the link to this blog. Hmmmm...

      For those that know me, or that have been reading my last few posts, you will have noticed that there is something just not quite right with me. Well after visiting the doctor yesterday(for more info on that interesting trip go to  urlLink My prince charmings blog ), i have been told that I have Depression (already knew that), anxiety, and agrafobia. Suprise Suprise.   I now have to have so many tests that i dont think i will have any blood left, and i have to see a heap of new doctors. I guess that life is about to get realy fun around here.   I guess that I will try to keep you upto date with alot of boring posts about what happens over the next few months of trying to fix me.

      I have decided that some of the coincidences in life are just down right wierd. This was brought to the front to my mind last night when i found out the a friend of mine had died. It was not his death that made me think this, but his death reminded me of some of life realy strange things.  I will try and explain what i am talking about. The guy that died was know to me because he worked with my mother. That isnt strange, but the rest of the story is. Not long before i met my prince charming, a fundraising dinner was held for my friend and his family because he had cancer. At this fundraiser, i was the official photographer and spend a bit of time talking to his 2 sisters.  I thought nothing more of this until my prince and i had been together for a couple of months. One night we were talking about ex's and he mentioned the name of one of his. Would you beleive it, it was the sister of my friend.  Now I know that that may not seem all that strange, but there is even more to this story. You see, this ex and myself both have the same first name. Ok, still not wierd? Well i will tell you how it came that he went out with two different women with the same name. You see, we are not the only ones with this name that he has gone out with. Before me, there were 7 others. He called it his S club7 (incase you dont get it, our name starts with S).   I found this funny when i was first told about it. Then i started to worry abit when he told me that he would surf the chat programs looking for girls with this name. I was was begining to think he was some sort of bizare stalker. But then i looked at my own track record and realised i was almost as bad. 3 of the guys i have been with all had the same name. So i guess you could say he used to have his S CLub7, and i had my M Club 3.  I know that i got off the original point of this post, but thats half the fun isnt it?

      Those that read my last post or the few that i talk to alot will know that one of my puppies, the one that we called Gizmo, was sick and that we had been hand feeding him in the hope that he would regain his strength.  Unfortunatly, tonight he lost his battle for life. I cannot say for sure what time it was that he passed away, but at a guess, i would say that it was about midnight. I found him not long after, cuddled up to his mum as though he was fast asleep.  All i can say is that even though i know that he is now out of pain, I hurts so much that i cannot explain. I have had many animals in my time, all special to me, but Gizmo was different. I was there from just after his birth just under two weeks ago, and had spent most of the last few days and nights feeding him, cleaning him and just making sure he was warm and comfitable.  I was also the one that found that he had passed away tonight. We knew it was going to happen but, that didn't make it any easier.  As I sit here writing this now, his mother is walking round and round the room looking for him. She knows he is dead, but she doesnt understand and wants us to bring him back to her. I wish I could.  There is more that i could tell to this, but I just cant stand to write anymore about it tonight.   R.I.P Gizmo

      Well folks, here is the update that I wrote the background for in my last post. You will have to bear with me because lack of sleep and to much stress had turned me in to a real scatter brain lately.  I will take you back to Tuesday of last week. This was basicly an uneventful day, just like the rest of my life, except for one thing. Princess, one of our dogs, gave birth to 7 puppies. This was a pretty big deal because I didnt realise until i got home from having lunch with my prince and went out the back to check on her and her brother Houdini. Imagine my suprise when I see that insead of having a pregnant gut, she had a pile of puppie cuddled up to her. That night we made the dicision that her and her pups had to be moved inside so that they didnt freeze to death. THat is when the distruction of the house began.  Wednesday saw me trying to take her and the seven pups to the vet by myself. It was fine until she decided that the vet want looking at the pups any more and tried to pull the box of pups down off the table. On top of that, it was money that we just couldnt afford.  The next day (Thursday), saw another drama happening. My prince was fired from his dream job at the hospital for being late to work. I would like to say here that i beleive that it was VERY unfair. He did more work than anyone else, did a better job, and got 2 weeks quota done in four days. Right from the start the boss had a problem with him. He even accused my prince of trying to intimidate him. To me that screams that he was intimidated. This set off the old cycle of depression and self distruction that i had been fighting so hard to keep at bay.  On friday, it was decided that i had to see the docotor. One because i needed a script for my pills, but also becaues we both realy thought and hoped that i was pregnant. THe doctor sent me for a blood test adn i was told that i would get the results that night or saturday morning. When i rang that night, i was told that was imposible and that i had to wait until Monday.  Saturday seemed like it was going to be nice and quite. Well it was until we got a call from Annette Rang to say that Sylvia had had another heart attack, was back in hospital and would be dead that night. This distroyed my prince. Even though he has no likeing for her (as you wil see if you read his blog), she is still his nanna, and the though of her death still hurts.  You can imagine our shock when he rang Annette on Sunday and she told us that after a bypass operation, she had recovered well.  In my wiered opinon, it is because the doctors said that she was going to die. She is such a stubour old bag, that i can just imagine her thinking "Well you said i am going to die, i think i will just live a bit longer, bug everyone a bit more, then die when no-one expects it".  Anyway, on with my lovely long tale. On Monday, I went to the doctors and was crushed when he told me that the test was negative. As much as it hurt me, i think it hurt my prince even more. On top of that, that morning our phone was cut off again becaues we couldnt pay the bill. That night saw us going to the local police station to collect his summons for the incedent with the police that i mentioned. We were bother releived to discover that he is only facing 5 charges instead of the 18 that the police were origanly wanting to charge him with. We also now know that his court date is 12th August.   On Tuesday, we decided to go and say another goodbye to Sylvia. I am begin to wonder how many last visits will be having. Is it going to be like all these rock bands that keep having "One Last Tour"? All morning before we left, and the entire afternoon while we were on our way down, his family kept either ringing or smsing my mobile. It took us for ever to get there due to one thing and another. At least we were able to pay the phone bill when my prince's last pay came through. On the way, I aranged with our friend Willss that we would pick him up from the station a bit later so that he and my prince could catch-up.  We we eventually made it to the hospital, we had to try and find where Sylvia was becaues Annette wasnt waiting out the frount like she had said. Once we found her, we had to go through the usual hospital visit talk, you know, how are you going, how are you feeling today. All that crap. I was so glad to get out of there it wasnt funny. It was bad enough years ago when i had to spen hours in hospitals and nursing homes visiting my grandmother after her stroke. The difference between visiting my grandmother and Sylvia is that i loved my grandmother more than anyone could imagine and would of moved the earth for if i thought it would help her, where as i dont like Sylvia, even though i dont know her that well. It was only the second time that i had seen her, but i still dont like her. The whole time that i was sitting in that cardiac ward, all i could think about how much the pain of my grandmothers death still hurt me, how sad it was that the people in there were so sick, and that i wish Sylvia would just die so that everyone can just get on with their lives. Please dont judge me by these coments. They are just my unspoken thoughts.  Anyway, that is enought of me being a heartless bitch. We left the hospital about 45min after we got there (thank God). Things started to look up a bit after we picked up willss and took him back to Annette and Rob's house. After a quick trip to his house we all sat down to dinner. Things were going well until Rob and Annette started about the court case. It set off my prince's vomiting (he is annorexic), and my depression. While i was in the bathroom talking to my prince, Willss came in asking if we could take him home. Now there is nothing wrong with this, except that for some reason it triggered one of my stupid anxiety problems. I will explain more at a later stage, but to cut it short sometime ago i developed a fear of showers and bathrooms after a couple of bad things happening to me. That left me on the verge of tears for the rest of the night.  Taking Willss home was a good break from the tension in the house. When we got back, my prince went and had a shower while i sat in the kitchen and knitted. This would of been quite good if it hadnt been for his sister being there. I have nothing against her as such, but she can get a bit overwelming at times. We eventually got out of there, and thought that we would go and see my mother. It was almost 10pm when i rang her to ask it that would be alright. We would of been there in about an hour, and i thought that just once she would stay up a little later for me concidering we have been running around like mad hatters for her in the last couple of months. Instead i copped an ear full of attatude about it. That was the final straw for me. On the long drive home, i dont think we had any happy conversations.  I thought that when we got home, we both would of fallen straight into bed, but it seems that the drive woke us up (as it always does). So what did we do? Decided to start the job of copying all our "importaint" files off the computer sot that we could reformat it again. We eventualy went to bed, mind you i dont remeber when, i cant even remember going to bed that night/morning.  The next day was a little brighter. After paying the rent, we decided to go to a junk shop we know about 15min out of town. When we got there we found that they dont open on Wednesdays. So we grabed some food and headed back into town. On the way we saw another shop that looked interesting. We went in there and found what i had been looking for...A babies cot. Now i know that im not pregnat so most people dont see the point in me laybying a cot. Let me explain. I was a great cot that we can do up the way we want, we can have it ready for when we do have a baby with out rushing, it made us happy that we were on step closer to having a baby, and we are saving about $300.  On Thursday, we had yet another lazy day. That was until night time. We had spent the day watching Princess constantly moving one of her puppies on to the couch and leaving him. That night we discovered why. She was leaving him to die. He is about 1/3 the size of the others and we hadn't seen him eat all day. That night, he was virtually dead. He kept stoping breathing, adn couldnt even lift his head. I took him and started carrying him around with me so that he could get warm. I spent a couple of hours on the net trying to find what to feed him. The problem is that all the sites said puppy formula. That is great except in the middle of the fucking night!. Eventually my prince decided to ring the after hours vet. She told us that he would most likely be dead by morning, but in the mean time if we wanted to we could water down normal milk and give it to him. There was no way either of were going to sit by ant watch the little fella die, so we made up the milk and feed him with a syringe. You would of though all his christmas' had come at once. He instantly came to life. After a couple of feeds we decided it was safe to go to bed for awhile. We did set teh alarm to get up and check on him but we were so tired the we turned it off and slept for another hour, took the time to have sex, then got up.  The problem is that we were both so tired, stressed and run down, we woke up sick and sore and ended up back in bed soon after giving him a feed. When we managed to get out of bed later in the day, we went into town, and spent the last of our money of formula for the bloody pup. The main thing though is that he his getting much better.  The only problem now is that in about 8 hours my mother and step father will be here, and there is no way the house is clean enough for their liking. Well my solution to that is-go to bed for about 4 hours, then get up and clean like mad.  I will leave you all now so that i can put that plan in to action, and you can all find something abit more interesting to read.  Stay tuned to see what dramas my mother can create durin he 24 hour visit, and a progress report on the little pup (btw, we call him gizmo, after the gremlins character)  Ta-Ta for now

      As I said in my last post, I have a lot to write about that has been happening in the last couple of days.  I will start by providing a bit of background information so that what I have to say about the last couple of days will make sense to those reading it.  First I will explain about my prince charming's Nanna Sylvia, who is 67 years old and quite ill. In the last couple of years she has had a number of strokes and heart attacks. A couple of weeks ago, after yet another heart attack, she was placed in hospital for tests. It was found that he carotid arteries were 99% blocked. We were told told that she would not survive the procedure to clear the blockage, so we made the trip to say "goodbye". But wouldn't you know, she was to stubborn to die.  After having this blockage cleared, she was released from hospital. We thought that the would be the end of it all for a while. We were wrong. On Saturday night, I answered the phone to discover my prince charmings mother Annette on the other end crying. She told me, followed by him that Sylvia would not last the night because she had another heart attack. Well this started the stress rising and the tears flowing.  I will leave this story here, and bring people upto date with other past happenings.  Earlier this year, my prince decided to misbehave with my pintara and the cops. As a result I am currently doing community service and up until now we have been waiting to see what charges he will be facing.  Another one of the happening around here lately has been the birth of 7 puppies.  The last info I need to give you for my update to make sense is that my prince and I have decided to try and have kids.  Now that I have given you this nice long bit of background information, I have decided to put my update in another post to try and keep the size of these posts down to readable levels.

      I have decided that computers are evil little inventions. Last night i wront a very long post covering alot of happening over the last couple of days. And what did the computer so before i could post it or save it as a draft? It froze and shut down!  I guess what i am saying is that it may take a while for me to re-write and post what i was going to say

       Ok, I know that it isn’t a good idea to write blog posts when you have been drinking, but I am bored so I decided WTF.I don’t really know what to write about, so I will just write what ever comes to mind  To start with, we are one step closer to getting the house re-wired. We got a quote the other day and the landlords (my mother and step-father lol) are happy with it, they just want another one to compare. On top of that, Telstra decided for some reason that they were going to upgrade our phone line. Instead of something from the dim dark ages, we now have a phone line that can handle the net properly...Yay!!!  Yesterday was kinda interesting. We spent the day at my mothers doing the catch up thing. I did about 8 loads of washing because I don’t want to waste our tank water and I figured it would keep our power bill down too. We didn’t really do much. Had a nice lunch of bacon and eggs, and roast pork for tea. We went shopping with my mother and she laybuyed about $250 worth of dvds for our Christmas presents. They were on special, I think there was about 15 of them. She was also nice enough to buy us a new kettle so that we don’t get electrocuted every time we make coffee. We also picked out the lino that we are going to put through the house until they get around to doing the floorboards. My stepfather's car decided to die early in the day. Looks like he has burnt a chip out and will probably cost over $1000 to fix...haha.  We eventually got home after 1am. I was sooo sick that it wasn’t funny. I was over tired, over stressed and I think I have a bit of a bug. Nathan says I'm pregnant...mind you he has told me that for 3 months, and it would be too early for morning sickness, so, sorry babe.  Well today saw an argument about me going to a friend’s house. Nathan wanted to go and I didn’t, so in the end he went and I stayed home and relaxed. The problem is, when he got there, him and the friends decided to start on at me about going out and that I need to ect. So I eventually gave in and Nathan came and got me. We picked up some grog and that is where the problems stemmed from.  Things were going well for a while, but then the grog took effect. I cannot be bothered explaining the whole night, but I will say that Nathan drank too much, but he had fun. He also decided to try and make up with some old friends via the phone, and embarrass himself by being load, depressed and sick.  I should of stuck to the original idea of staying home alone...much safer and then I would be sober and not at risk of saying something I shouldn’t to people.

      Ok, I have depression...Big deal right? Well there is something that people that dont have depression dont realise. When you are have depression and your life starts to turn to shit, you cannot see anyway out of it other than death. Over the past months I have been having more and more of my depression "fits". Most peoples reaction to it all is "Get over it, it isnt that bad"  If it wasnt for  urlLink my prince , I would be dead by now. A number of times he has been all that has stopped my from killing myself. The problem is, I am starting to get so bad that I am almost beyond his help. Instead of killing myself, I have developed the bad habbit of hurting myself with razor blades...Now before you all jump down my throat about it and say that is stupid ect, you need to unerstand something. I cant help it, and also, I havent done it for quite awhile. I cannot explain why I do it, all I know is, is that it provides me with a sense of control and acts as a kind of release. Half of the time when i get into the mood to do it, I kind of faze out and dont realise what I am doing. It is when I realise what I have done and see the blood that the guilt kicks in.  Anyway, lately I seem to have progressed beyond cutting, instead I just want to die. I cannot justify it. I know death is the wimps way out ect, but it is the only way out that I can see. I have run out of people to talk to. My family dont give a shit, the few people that I might be able to remotely class as friends either dont want to hear it, or just dont need the shit. It is pathetic when you are having a party and the only people you have to invite are family.  Anyway, I still havent figured out what the point of this post is, I guess it is just a way for me to winge. It is also a way to explain to people what my brain is doing.  Well, I think I will leave you on that misereable thought and go back to trying to stay alive   P.S This is also a good time and place to say thank-you to the few people that have stood by me through all my shit...Even if they dont read this, in the case that I do give up one day, I am sure that someone can point them to this post.

      Those that know me, will know that I basicly have no friends. There are people who think they are my friend even though they have betrayed me a million times. Others pretend to be my friend because of my family ect. Well the other day, thanks to my prince chatting to people on the net I have a friend. The bad news is, she has come along at a bad time.  You see I am going through a stage where I dont want to leave the house or see people. Now that is fine when you dont have to go anywhere, but when you want to catch up with someone, it makes it very hard. On top of that, when I am like this, i getr paranoid. I keep thinking my prince is going to leave me for her. I know this wont happen, but I sometimes think he would be better off with her.  Ah well, back to trying to find away to hide from the world

      On the off chance that there is more than one or two people that read this blog, I have decided to make an annoucment. Anyone that decides that they can judge or punish me for the actions of others, or because of my choice of partner and friends can  GET FUCKED .  I have had enough of all the shit that is being thrown my way due to childishness or small mindedness. I am a person inmy own right and am not a part of others to be judged as they are judged.

      Life is a funny thing sometimes. After threatening that I am going to move to qld more times than I can remember, I looks like there is a chance that I might be. After looking for work around here for ages, it looks like  urlLink my prince  might have a welding job.  The problem...It is working in the mines in qld. If I knew more about it I would tell you, but unfortunatly I have told you all the details that I know of.  Stay tuned for more details...
