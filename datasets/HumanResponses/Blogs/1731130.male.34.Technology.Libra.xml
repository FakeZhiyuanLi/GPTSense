      Remember when you were a kid and you used to read cheap newsagent comics? (As opposed to now you are grown-up and read "graphic novels"). Well, usually mixed in your X-Men issue 114, between ads for X-ray specs and fake vomit would have been an invitation into the wonderful world of Amazing Live Sea-Monkeys!  Probably, you disregarded this as nonsense aimed at impressionable kids who didn't appreciate biological science like you do. Monkeys do not grow from sachets of powder nor live underwater. You would skip straight to the x-ray specs and fake vomit.  Sea Monkeys are, however, a breed of brine shrimp and although the similarity with monkeys is massively overstated, they do in fact grow from sachets and live underwater. Best of all, in keeping with the retro wave sweeping us, Sea Monkeys are enjoying a resurgance.  Link:  Sea-Monkeys.com

      Science fiction is great to read. The best science fiction I have read is from amongst the classic writers such as HG Wells, Jules Verne and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. I devoured all Wells works and amongst his great works (Invisible Man, War of the Worlds, Time Machine etc) and his "wierdo" stuff on utopian politics and peace on earth, there are a couple of lesser-known gems. I would recommend:   The First Men on the Moon.  Certainly not the greatest technological foresight but definitiely colourful and well-written. As well as an excellent story, I found it very revealing that not all Wells' predictions were accurate (or even plausible): hindsight is a terrible thing.   The Sleeper Awakes.  This book has a fantastic premise: A man falls into a coma, when he wakes up centuries later he discoveres his modest finances (having been invested by his estate over hundreds upon hundreds of years) has grown to make him the richest, most powerful man in the world. Wouldn't that be great? Well, not according to the book it wouldn't.  Other classics you might like to try is Conan Doyle's The Lost Continent and The Poison Belt. Both very good (if underrated) science fiction yarns from the creater of Sherlock Holmes.  Link:  Project Gutenberg

      A person's car is an expression of their psyche. What they drive is a complex function of a) what best expresses their personality as it is (or as they wish it was) and b) what they can afford. I drive a Ford Falcon Forte which is, without doubt, the finest automobile I've ever owned. Once it finally goes to the great scrap yard in the sky this is what I'd like as a replacement.  Ford Falcon XR6. It has a 4.0L DOHC VCT I6 motor developing 182kW at 5,000rpm and 380Nm at 3,250rpm. Best of all, it looks like dynamite.  Link:  www.ford.com.au

      If you're into electronics, you need a decent multimeter. I have two: an analogue one for quick and simple testing and a Fluke digital multimeter for serious work.  It's well-built, easy to use and tests just about everything. The fluke range is pretty comprehensive too: from simple right up to mind-bogglingly ridiculous. They're not the cheapest, but well worth the price if you need something reliable.  Link:  www.fluke.com

      One of my favourite geek pastimes is the "out-geek". This is where you see someone using a fairly ordinary tool/piece of equipment/technology/pen and you "out-geek" them.  Allow me to demonstrate:   You're at a restaurant with six of your co-workers and it's time to divide the bill. One of the party pulls out a pocket calculator to help. At this point you say in a derisive tone "that's not a calculator.  This  is a calculator!" and whip this monster out.  It's just struck me as odd that not only would at least one of my co-workers take a pocket calculator to a restaurant, but that I would have a better one with me.  I have always subscribed to the "use a sledgehammer to crack a walnut" school of technology and this can best be demonstrated via the Texas Instruments Voyage 200 PLT Calculator. It does more than add up. It graphs, it does calculus, it solves quadratic equations it even allows you to download and install  new applications  (including games) for it's  operating system!    I use mine to add.  Link:  TICalc.org

      I really like things which appear impossible to fathom to those who are uninitiated into their secrets. The binary clock is a classic example. If you can't convert binary numbers into decimal in your head (and let's face it who can?) you wouldn't want to rely on this clock as your primary timepiece.  If on the other hand, you can convert binary, imagine how impressed people will be when they see this cool thingey on your desk and see you actually tell accurate time with it. "You are a genius" they will say, "can I be your friend?" they will ask, "I'm walking away now... very slowly" they may whisper.  Link:  ThinkGeek.com

      Nothing could be simpler: attach the fins to an empty plastic soft-drink bottle (one quarter filled with water) attach the hose to a bicycle pump and start pumping. Slowly the pressure builds until the end of the hose is ejected and the force of the water being expelled (about 25psi theoretically developing 3.9lbs of thrust) carries the rocket up 100 feet into the air.  Re-use it again and again. No rocket engines, no pyrotechnics and little risk of personal injury: even with miss-fires. Great for a sunny day at the local park, beware of trees and buildings or you're liable to lose it.  Link:  Google Search

      During World War II the Third Reich used Enigma machines to encipher their radio communications. They though it was a foolproof cryptography system, but the allies cracked it and some believe the war was shortened by at least 2 years as a result. Genuine WWII Enigma machines survived, but you're unlikely to find one for sale so the best you can home for is a PC based emulator or one of these little beauties:  Rather than building an Enigma replica, which is a tedious task, an electronic alternative is available, using modern components to replace the mechanical parts of the original Enigma. The Enigma-E is a DIY Kit that enables you to build your own electronic variant of the famous Enigma machine. It works just like a real Enigma (and is compatible with an M3 and M4 Enigma as well as the standard Service Machines). A message encrypted on, say, a real Enigma M4 can be read on the Enigma-E and vice versa.   Simon Singh's  The Code Book  has an excellent chapter on the Enigma as well as tons of other cryptographic highlights.  Link:  www.xat.nl

      The night sky is truly an amazing sight and to truly appreciate it you need to see it in three aspects: Using the naked eye (just as  insert_deity  intended), through binoculars to capture the volume of detail you can see with just a little help and finally, via the biggest telescope you can afford.  Reflecting telescopes are cheaper than refracting telescopes of the same aperture and perfectly adequate for the amateur (or professional for that matter). Invest in as big a tube and as sturdy a mount as your budget-manager will allow. I work on an 8" Newtonian Reflector on a German equatorial mount with dual axis motor drives: above average amateur equipment, but just below the unhealthy obsession threshold.  Warning: A telescope is a scientific instrument so why would you buy one from a toy or department store? I strongly recommend you do some research into what separates a good telescope from a nasty one before parting with any cash. The link below is a good place to start.

      Everyone needs a PDA and for pure sex appeal, you can't go past a Sony NR70V. I don't want to get into a Palm vs PocketPC argument, but I still think Sony makes the sexiest device even though  in my opinion  PocketPC is an operating system which has more going for it.  Regardless of which device you choose, the first task after purchase is replacing the standard apps with ones which suit your personality better. I use a new launcher, agenda/calendar/contacts app and a swag of science tools and games.  Link:  www.cliesource.com  or  www.pocketpcthoughts.com

      No-one should be without a Swiss Army Knife and in this regard, you're likely to be spoilt for choice. There are a thousand different kinds ranging from the simple two-sizes-of-pen-knife variety right up to the deluxe models with led-lights and butan-powered blow torches.  My tool of choice is a Victorinox CyberTool 41 which includes: Large and small blades, corkscrew, can opener, 3mm and 6mm screwdrivers, cap lifter, wire bender & stripper, reamer & punch, sewing eye, wrench (with 4mm & 5mm female hex drive, 4mm posidrive 0 & 1 bits, 4mm slotted bit, phillips 2 bit, 4mm hex bit,  torx 8 bit, torx 10 bit, torx 15 bit), pressurised ballpoint pen, stainless steel pin, mini screwdriver (1.5mm), pliers, wire cutters, wire crimping tool, hook & parcel carrier, keyring, tweezers, toothpick, metal saw, metal file, nail file, nail cleaner, wood saw, wood chisel and scissors.  Of course, it comes in a pouch for easy mounting on your utility belt.  Link:  www.victorinox.com

      In keeping with my maxim that "toys are wasted on kids": Lego Mindstorms, released in the late 90's brings programmable robotics to Lego.  The heart of the system is a programmable Lego "brick" known as the RCX (although other versions exist including the simpler Scout and even simpler MicroScout). This brick contains a microcontroller which controls three sensor inputs and three motor outputs. Add some motors, sensors and other building elements and you have an actual, programmable robot.  One of the greatest things about Lego Mindstorms is: it's been hacked. You can get replacement firmware and programming tools for the RCX which will allow you to use such things as Forth, C (or C-like), Java and other tools to interface with your robot. There's also a plethora of custom built components to extend your reach beyond what Lego provides.  Best of all, there's a large and vibrant user community with tons of inspiration and ready answers to fiddly questions.  Link:  www.lego.com  and  www.lugnet.com

      Why would you paint a fantastic work of art only to display it in public for all the philistines to see. Why not instead hide it somewhere so only those who are really keen will have the opportunity to experience you muse. Even better put it somewhere where it will only be seen  by accident !  OK, it's a bit of a stretch, but let me set this one up for you. You're on the net, you type in a web address and you type .cone instead of .com What do you get? A 404 - Page not Found error. Informative and to the point: yes, infuriating and annoying: sometimes, inspiring and artistic: ummm, no, not really.  Well there are people in this world who put a lot of effort into making these 404 pages more than a three digit number and a paragraph of techno-crap. Have a look at some of these beauties.

      Have you been banned from using the power tools by your wife but still want to make the occasional piece of useful furniture? Are you looking for a chair that not only looks like it could be made by a six-year old but can  actually  be made by a six-year old? Are you such a ham-fisted neanderthal that the only tool you will use is a mallet?  Well here's just the thing for you: a Chairfix chair. As the blurb says:  "The chairs are routed out of one sheet of 8x4 15mm Birch faced ply-wood or MDF...  Easily assembled in minutes by the end user. Chairfix was inspired by Airfix model kits and is easily assembled by the consumer useing a mallet. No glues screws or fixings are needed."  You could have a couple in the loft in case extras arrive uninvited to your next dinner party: Just whip a couple up while they're hanging up their coats.  Ikea has a lot to answer for.

      You have a need: something to achieve. You use technology to get it done. Normally.  I'd like to see more of what I like to call "technology in reverse", that is, taking some usefull technology and use it to achieve something with as least point as possible. In other words, get the gadget and work out what you need it for afterwards.  Take this example. A Global Positioning System (GPS) might be a very useful bit of kit, but consider the possibilities if you put it to pointless use. By switching it on, keeping a running bead on where you went, you could drive around in such a way as to create line art. That's what's happening here. These guys turn on the GPS and drive around. Some of the results are amazing.  Completely pointless, but amazing.  Link:  GPSDrawing.com

      When I was a kid in the UK, I had a homing pidgeon. I know: how cool is that! Anyway, my dad and I spent two weekends building the best, most palacial and high-tech pidgeon-coop ever constucted in Lincolnshire and after a further  two months  of training Benny the Homing Pidgeon was ready for his first flight off into the unknown. One fine Saturday morning we got up early and release him.  He never came back.  Imagine my delight, twenty-eight years later, when I came across this: You buy a bag of birdseed with a special web address on it. You then go and feed it to a near-by and obliging pidgeon. What the bird doesn't know is that the seed also includes a handful of RFID chips (before you ring the RSPCA, this is not detrimental to the pidgeon). Said bird now flies around doing it's own birdy thing until it settles in front of specially positioned cameras which detect the RFID chips inside it and upload video of the bird onto the website quoted on the bag!  If only we had this back in 1977. Benny the Pidgeon would probably still not have come back, but at least I'd have known he was having a good time.

      Do you like me remember the glory days of the Vic20 and the Sinclair Spectrum? Yes, that's right, the golden age when home computers ran of cassette and plugged into your TV. Unfortunately back in those days, buing an upgrade meant selling your existing computer so I no longer have access to my old gear (except my old TRS-80 Pocket Computer). Well, those days are back through the wonders of  emulation .  A couple of months ago I stumble across MESS. MESS is an emulator par excellance. While you can get software to turn your $3,000 PC (today's prices) into a $200 (1981 prices) dinosaur, the beauty of MESS is that it emulates over 320 different systems.   My personal favourites include: Commodore Vic20 and C64, Sinclair ZX Spectrum, Apple I and Apple IIe, Macintosh+ and Apple Lisa, Tandy TRS-80, MicroBee, Texas Instruments IT-99 and Sony PlayStation. I remember them all!  So, if you're pining for a simpler time, get hold of MESS and re-live your IT childhood. I found it most inspiring.  Link:  www.mess.org

      I am always happy when I come across something or someone that out-geeks me. Believe me, that really takes some doing: I am, after all, trying to convince my wife to let me build a life-size Dalek. But I digress.  If you remain unsatisfied by pretending you live on board a Federation Starship, then this is for you. 24th Century interior design have recreated the look and feel of the Enterprise (from Star Trek: The Next Generation) inside a house. Kitchen looks like a transporter room, lounge looks like the bridge, bedroom looks like crew quarters... you get the idea.  It's not a product yet, but considering the number of Trekkies there are in the world, the market must be massive. I will say, here and now, I am not considering one. It's not that I wouldn't like one, but if I'm having trouble with the Dalek, there's not a hope in hell Jackie will agree to this.  Link:  www.24thcid.com
