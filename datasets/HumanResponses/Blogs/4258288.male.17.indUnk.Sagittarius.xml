       Well its the start of a monday wif monday blues...knowing the only thing u can look forward to is the shorter week and ya...that's abt it...    but b4 u know it,SNYG comes ur way in the morning!so thanks to fatty n bridgitte for staying in the CAC room doing dreadful econs national income qns in the morn to stall me for a few secs so i can step into the office so that i can juz right draw the keys wif her haha...wow she's short compared to me la...oh well didn like tall girls in the 1st place anyway...mayb thats why ive got the paedo instinct hehe...    And to make things better she was singing the sch song this morn la!how cool is that!it as an overdosage of SNYG in the morning but hu cares?what u dont know cant kill u rite?so a bit too much SNYG drug is definitely not fatal...so there goes my monday blues as i start the day...    Ya was listening to LHL's national day rally yest...so super long i was waiting to watch  yu tian tu long ji  but guessed i kept my hopes too high up as our new PM stretched his speech over 11...my gosh and he spoke satanic at the beginning of the rally and was talking abt how the malays are contributing to our society la...well mayb they do bout compare that to the other superior people in singapore man!look if those dicks actually have access to more scholarships than us and still dont have the incentive to make good use of their lives then i suggest they stick a zanmato up their candya**...so much for contributing to society man...u all can actually start off by stop learning to mat rock,posing wif ur damn radios and ruining the happiest minutes of my life...f*** u dicks for even living in our society man thinking the world is ur dance floor for u to try and pose and act kool while u're actually wasting ur lives away wif ur mat habits and disrupting ppl's lives...the next mat hu has to ruin the happiest secods of my life is definitely gonna die man...    ok wif all that bitching done i hafta say sorry to pek,vince n YK...pang sehed them coz now my dad's at home so feel that i shld eat dinner wif him la...since he's rarely at home anyways...    haha and the j1s left for the OCS camp today i think...so sch was utterly quiet...while i left early for dinner heard that shim got a pict of his sophie!well haha gotta see that 2mr...and ya gay shim better remb ur promise to smile at sophie the next time u see her k!dun worry la im sure she's already gotten some good publicity abt u(except from me hehe so sorrie) so yup dont sweat...and muz teach me how to fold rose k!i risked my life folding the thing as mrs toh almost caught me n i claimed to b playing wif a "crumpled piece of paper"...    And for any of u hu has a GBA or a game boy advanced emulator go play the gundam seed game: Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Battle Assault somehow's a fun but difficult fighting game tho...cant belive my Justice beat everything but a cursed Aegis argh so aggravating...ya btw Juztice is a secret bot...dun exactly know how to unlock it...    K la prelims coming gotta mug a bit folks...have fun!

       haha maths test was pretty ok, just that didnt study enough topics to cover the topics that were coming out! so ended up getting screwed anyway...left the binomial question blank shldve studied for it argh...costed 7 whole marks...      Yep and went to town right after the exam!wif a gang of alvin,soomin,yk,yx,fatty and shim...pek went home and eric had some scouts stuff to do i think...while vince din come to sch at all wonder what happend?ate at taka KFC and realised that the silly packaging has deteriorated...the zinger was smaller and so were the chickens...so much for cost cutting lo mayb shld really boycott KFC like the santa claus person was urging us to do outside far east the other day...and ya some retarded malay guy juz walked by the alley separating KFC and macs and started staring at us and MATtering some nonsense...and good thing he muttered more nonsense on the other table coz if he stared at us and talked rubbish it again he's really gonna die...so much for a silly malay that can ruin ur day...      Well yes YK i agree hate the sin but not the sinner...but i can tell u wun understand how much of a bane those dicks are to me!in my eyes  THEY ARE SIN  so ya...if i could conduct racial cleansing it will be done...watch out world..      yeah and while the other went baq home yk,yx and me decided to go catch a silly movie...was deciding in between twins eff 2 or collateral but ended up watching collateral anyways.great storyline abt this guy who's hired to kill witnesses and yup...the story had impt lessons too!since u dun live long enough to make all the mistakes in the world u'd better learn from some of the lessons learnt in the show...here they are...   1)if u juz get to know a girl always ask her for her contacts or namecard...it could save her life!   2)do not drive tom cruise around in ur taxi   3)do not park ur taxi outside a building...people may fall out of the building,damaging ur taxi and ur boss might want u to pay for the repairs...   4)listen to korean trance in a pub and might cause u to die   5)being a boss of ur own pub and plaing jazz at the same time might cause u to die   6)u can steal a handphone easily wif a gun   7)do not steal a handphone running low on batt   8)do not die in a train...it takes time for people to realise u're dead...      and wif yk & yx on their way home,i had to kill time till 530 so i could meet my 1st 3 months pal alex...looked at gundams at taka and read d&amp;d oriental adventures at borders...haha d&amp;d sure brings back good memories of rolling 1s and 20s on the d20... but yup met alex at braddell and started talking bout the rubbish we go thru in our respective educational institutions more than studying...and also got pissed off by this bunch of 4 silly sitis making so much noise but was elated to see this stupid malay kid get his hand stuck on the door muhahaha!and suddenly we were talking bout music and the bands he listens to and i was exposed to X-Japan music...hehe they're cool!muz get their ballad and kurenai songs...after studying we decided to try and get lost i braddell by taking roads we've never taken b4 and yup,our nightime walking adventure began!      juz picked the roads wif the most screwed up names or looked spookiest to walk into and went on,risking our lives as we trudged pass tp girl's home which might have psycho girls coming out wif knives to kill us,association of visually disabled ppl which houses blind people that can kill us(eg daredevil) and ghosts too as we walked ard some place called joan road which looked really spooky esp in the 7th month!well we only walked on joan road coz we didn want to walk on olive road coz it reminded us of the silly popeye and his spinach show...      Despite our best attempts to get lost,we found ourselves in thomson road!jeez thats wad happens if u know the streets to well...so we talked crap all the way to CJ from thomson,walking pass the famous 1st 3 monthe PE spots like dyson road and how our teacher edison brought us there juz to look down at the surroundings...then we walked down to the esso outside SJI juz to get a marigold peel fresh apple flavour wif aloe vera,again putting our lives on the line as we walked on the entrance to steven's road thru the PIE as cars marginally drove by our ears and the ghosts on the hill to our left beckoned to us...  yup and so we went home taking the 153 while i swithced to the mrt...man can tell u that alex is rally proud of his silly new shoe the limited edition nike air force 1 with brown snake leather skin that was released in the mkt on aug 21 2004 and fetched a selling price of US$200...thinks its more impt thatn his life lo wonder wad's wrong wif that guy...      and saw mom and dad at home!really miss dad lo havent seen him in the longest time but oh well...      well now that ive described yest's silly adventures and watche one piece id better do my econs essays!hope singapore's lee jia wei can get the bronze this evening...

       well started off the day by trying to jump on SNYG in the office again..but to no avail today sighz..well cant expect the 7:08 plan to work all the time...better luck 2mr morning i guess!      But ya anyway the silliest thing i heard in the morning other than all the complaints of susilo who juz lost his silly badminton match was Pek's silly dream...Well ya let's try and describe it in steps...1stly u hafta know there's this girl in 2t15(our friendly neighbouring class) called sherrill...wun digress on who she is but anyways Pek's dream went something like...   1)After school pek YK vince n fritties goes up late to class.   2)We see sherrill outside her class on our way and she suddenly turns into a werewolf! GROWLLLL!!!   3)No lycan mask was used like they always were on jer tho...but instead we drew our racial harmony day weapons we brought to school...the Ivory Bone Dragon Katana and fritties' silly wakizashi.   4)With Pek watching ur do the fighting in the background we managed to fend off the werewolf!but unfortunately fritties was clawed by the werewolf once.(argh minus life -12HP)   5)As fritties is clawed now he turns into a werewolf!He chases pek YK n vince round the school's J block...   6)Vince and YK manage to hide successfully somewhere,but pek was still being chased and somehow finally manages to find a safe corner like a malay...   (And fritties turned into a monster couldn catch pek as he runs only as fast as his human running spd...well dun blame fritties coz pek runs a bit fast too...)   7)And then pek woke up.   well the bad influence of mass media i guess...or the remnants of chilli padi that pek still had left from yest's competition...      Speaking of which ar there's a lotta lycan related movies out nowadays ar...then kena struck by the lycan end up v jia lat...eg like in silly movies like Van Hellsing...to mayb even Harry Potter's 3rd installment...if u ask me we should kill lycans like we do in class!use the mask!hopefully it'll never get to me tho hehe...      And great job by 2t17 for beating thf's class flat!16-10 really sounds good considering they batted 1 more round hehe...and YYG was so molestatious la go n touch the girls running to 1st base...muz be the nitrotech...And special mention muz go to jer joel n ferroa for killing them xtra fast when batting hehe...and not to metion take a walk friend the LKL lookalike who helped us score so much hehe!but hey i wouldn mind trying to beat thf flat tho...but it seems rater hard coz she's another one of those BBs too...well gotta try someday muhahaha...      Haiya and its damn scary la...the silly sheet of paper KB ong gave us was like the most impossible set of chem qns alive la!wad cyclical ester nv hear b4 1 and too small to have the cyclical bond on the 1,2-carbons so sianz...i mean even our mighty trans sea dragon couldn solve the qns at the back...then he said thats how the prelim qns would look like la so good luck to any living CJ student taking chem...      And any1 heard of a hydrocarbon that turns into a shiny solid when exposed to air?hmmm...the wonders of wad u realise after a night study session of tough questions...      So ya...and gay pek was saying how he's going to carry out his plan to kill me since i told mdm indra how BCG looks like...he's supposed to take out the holy kris that has been tainted wif malay blood and stab me wif it and so i'll go down to hell...then my blood will cleanse the kris so he can kill himself then go to heaven...haiya such a strange plan but anyway ya i think it works la...where u go depends on the cleaniness of the silly kris...but ya anyways i suggested killing that gay of a melayu with ugly curly hair 1st b4 u kill urself pek!at least u'll save BCG from the pain...      and thanx for the meaningful jay chou songs in the car pek...it was......meaningful!well ya applies to both our sluts since they seem so distant now huh...so sad...so this kind of sentimantal songs can tao ye xing qing...      well gtg do econs essay now!mdm indra coming baq 2mr argh...    Haha and to    SGAL:hope u get ur phone baq frm ur dad soon!so much for scandalousing wif ur husband ekky... YK:we saw ur tsm lookalike in from 1t1 la...retribution for not night studying with us!

       Well its a Wed!All Weds are meant to be quite nice so ya...      Started off the day by placing my bets on the 7:08am-go-into-office plan again..and with all my luck wow!Got my morning dose of SNYG drug again...Wonder what i'll do without it...      And wow jer & pek are utterly terrible la...that was the silliest dare to eat  A SAUCER OF CHILLI PADI!?!?!?!? wad's the world coming to man?good thing pek made it out rather safely but jer din look that good tho...Amazing wad chilli can do to u...      And Weds are well known for being the earliest JC day anyways...so yup...and 2t17's well planned timetable without the silly chinese period at the end of the day makes it convenient to prepare for roaming ard later on when the 1:50pm bell strikes to mark the time to spy on our sluts...And true anough fat bear got his share of 90210 aka FG and was asking fellyz to take a pict of her...well good planning by fellyz since she brings her digicam everyday...then we spotted the silly chipmunk maryanne outside 1t28!not only victimised her by playing with her hair but also got a wonderful close up view of SNYG...how marvellous!      And so what if u got to see sophie thrice today shimon!i saw her thrice too and even messed ard wif her hair!so dun b too satisfied wif the pict of sophie smiling in ur phone until uve reached my level hehe...      But of course thing's weren't so marvellous with mock test after that la...even read info given in the question wrongly la!only realised it when fatty told me after the damn paper haiya...wasted marks man hopefully got error carried forward...and the lousy organisation of the phy dept and history dept ended up making the phy students like us get confused and going to the wrong LT la...started so late come and hai wo...ended up not going for jap class so i cant see my other eyecandy but oh well...PLS is another sight to behold!Who cares if she's 8 years older man...      Speaking of jap class better fix the outing day wif Hayashi Sensei soon...haha think got a good chance of going out 1 on 1 wif her so wow!Mayb can do sinful stuff...okok juz kidding u know i wont do this kinda stuff right?hehe...      Then after the gang of shim YK n wash vege went to get their haircuts YK beame a pang seher and left...leaving shimz wash vege n i to eat at BK...again...my gosh soon enough im gonna become sick of BK like macs la...and w/o that national day offer can see that the price elasticity of demand for BK food is elastic...not a lotta customers liao...so they'd better keep the think to raise their total revenue la!we consumers also got decrease in consumer welfare lo...too bad cannot draw econs graph here ar...      Then while in the train wif wash vege we saw Shim's other eyecandy!oh man she's so scandalous on the train good thing shim wasn there la...      Haha and finally described the eventful day to mommy at home..she's going to Indo to pay respects to ahkong so ya...gotta wake up myself from now until dunno when la...Reminds me that i hafta pay my respects to some1 too...so thanx SGAL for telling me where to go n do so...hope u ain't too sad ya its been a year since then liao..and thanx for walking e to jap class to get my HW anyways...      Well gtg do maths!another mockery exam coming our way...Study hard t17!

And it feels absolutely dumb to start a blog today larz...coz of all the silly mock exams and A levels...Got phy mock and not say my phy so pro liddat...& got so many econs essay due to mdm indra's obsession wif wanting us to do corrections..besides at this rate means can only update if bro's out of the house...dunno why he's not back at home tonight all his army duties all so funny 1...oh well juz hope he takes care of his infected feet while "serving the nation" hehe...      School was quite ok today la...started off by timing myself to go into the office at 7:08am and whatdaya know!SNYG was there!perfect timing...but its damn funny ar she comes at such diff times in the morn 1...sometimes can come at 6:58 to 7:15 haiya but for this week i'll try bashing into the office at 7:08 am haha...mayb its based on the 1st day of the week's timing that she draws keys...then i especially ponned chem lect juz to see her la!of course it din came to waste...saw SNYG at the grandstand and after gay YK ate his silly bread wif a sausage but isn't a hotdog he accompanied me to go see her at the silly Jblock tables..haiya but the silly siti go n pick the wrong table ar!can only see the ponytail from my angle...but hey the ponytail is still gorgeous la!And i'm so wad if im despo YK...nothing else really worth being so despo abt in life now anyways...And u cant say u're not despo too!incriminating evidence juz comes out of ur mouth...      Walau pity Pek la...this BCG going out wif melayu looking guy...then SNYG also going out wif this GWT who shimon says is a nice guy...oh well juz hafta eliminate competition legally..looks like i'll hafta train up my silly skills wif the big Zanmato at the back of the clas...yawns lo...Dun worry Pek looks like we're on the same boat...      Lessons were boring tho...only GP lect wuz fun coz the silly mad dog baldy loser wasn shouting any crap or lecturing and complaining abt vince and jer like last week la...unreasonable dick man...ya and drew fat bear's fruitella girl(FG) during lect...has an utterly excellent ponytail that gets fat bear squealling...      And juz came back from night study la..had some exposure to FG b4 night study started...and fat bear got so excited again la...then wuz trying hard to focus on the lousy thermodynamics and ideal gases chapters which i completely din listen to in J1 la...haiz shld haf been more hardworking back then but wth...too late to regret anyways...was a not so productive 3hr study session tho...but we saw shimon's target la!and silly gay shimz din wanna talk to her...tell u she's a nice girl u so shy for wad la shimon?she wun bite mahz...but whoa if she does then i nothing to say la!      And finally got home by courtesy of Pek and his mom playing destressing songs in the car...guess we felt that our sluts are drifting further away...so depressing but oh well..no sluts r as impt as studies now i guess...then finally got home and talked rubbish wif mom and after read YK's silly blog wif great comments in it...haha U kinda voiced out half of my thots YK...so thanx..wun abuse u so much next time...      well and finally got this silly blog up too...oh well guess i've got a new way to keep myself busy but cant do this too often hehe..better get studying for phy 2mr!    Anyways here's a quote from Mike Price(whoever that is..) to all the fans of Rock Lee from Naruto...and hope it gives people some inspiration...very nice quote which caught my eye and can be found in the CJ diary on the May 2004 term 2 week 9 sect.    "More people have talent than discipline. That's why discipline payes better" - Mike Price         And this terribly nice song that's stuck in my head!!!Iris by Goo Goo Dolls man din knew it was nice but only realised it's really really nice when vince burnt the song in a CD for me..haha so thanx vince...anyway here it is...       And I'd give up forever to touch you     'Cause I know that you feel me somehow     You're the closest to heaven that I'll ever be     And I don't want to go home right now          And all I can taste is this moment     And all I can breathe is your life     and sooner or later it's over     I just don't want to miss you tonight          And I don't want the world to see me     'Cause I don't think that they'd understand     When everything's made to be broken     I just want you to know who I am          And you can't fight the tears that ain't coming     Or the moment of truth in your lies     When everything feels like the movies     Yeah, you bleed just to know you're alive          And I don't want the world to see me     'Cause I don't think that they'd understand     When everything's made to be broken     I just want you to know who I am          And I don't want the world to see me     'Cause I don't think that they'd understand     When everything's made to be broken     I just want you to know who I am          And I don't want the world to see me     'Cause I don't think that they'd understand     When everything's made to be broken     I just want you to know who I am          I just want you to know who I am     I just want you to know who I am     I just want you to know who I am     I just want you to know who I am       Well better run along now...rather late and still hafta study hehe..hope i have good dreams abt SNYG..
