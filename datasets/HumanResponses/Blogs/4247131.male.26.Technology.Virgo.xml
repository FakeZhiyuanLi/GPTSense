      I received some good news from the doctor today, I don't have glandular fever! WOOHOO!! Though apparently the blood test did show that I had it at some point previously in my life. News to me.  I watched some more movies over the last couple of days. Yesterday I watched the new  urlLink Thunderbirds  movie, it was okay. More aimed at kids though as the adults didn't get much of a chance to develop as characters. Worth the 90 minutes of my time though. Today I watched  urlLink Hackers  which I bought on DVD a little while back. It's interesting how movies portray computers and computer nerds and how much they actually get wrong ("Hackers" and " urlLink The Net " spring to mind). But I guess they have to make things interesting so it's understandable.  On a completely different matter, I have been thinking of upgrading my computer lately, it is starting to get a little dated. Well certain parts are anyway. The monitor is only a 17 inch (non-flat), the speakers are like 6 years old or something like that. They still do a good job however, but I'm thinking it is time to update them.  I've been trying to decide between staying with a CRT or making the move to a LCD monitor. For roughly the same price as a 17inch LCD, I could buy a 21inch flat screen CRT. There is the issue of desk space but there are some models that are smaller than normal. Speakers are the other point I have been pondering, should I buy computer speakers and save myself a lot of money or buy home theatre speakers/receiver? Decisions decisions. Oh well, there is plenty of time to think about that, I haven't even done my tax return yet so I don't even know how much money, if any, I will be able to spend on these additions.  I'll hopefully be heading back to work tomorrow. I imagine that there will be a truckload of work that needs to be done in the next couple of days so I imagine by about lunchtime tomorrow I will be yearning for the weekend. It will be a nice change to be back at work. Quite frankly I am tired of being sick and staying at home in bed for the majority of the day.  Time has come for me to close out this post, it's not getting REALLY late (by my standards) but I should try and go to bed, might listen to some music if I cant get to sleep straight away.

      Well, it has taken me a while but I have finally decided I should put a  urlLink BLOG  together. And what good timing it is as well, I will have the next two days to work on it because I am at home with Tonsilitis or Glandular Fever. The doctor couldn't work out which, but very kindly sent me to a place that sucked 2 vials of blood out of me and let me know that they should know in a couple of days. I am hoping that it's only tonsilitis. But we will see.  Due to me being stuck at home today, I watched  urlLink Walking Tall  today, not a bad movie, not great but worth at least a watch once if you like  urlLink The Rock  and don't mind popcorn movies.  Unfortunately there hasn't been much to watch on cable TV today either, well there is a Simpsons fanfest on while the olympics are on but at the moment they are only showing early seasons, hopefully this will change over the sixteen days of the olympics.  Thats about all I can write at the moment, well I could write some more but I dont think I have the energy at the moment.
