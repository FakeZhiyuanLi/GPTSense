       I arrived in school today. Yesterday, I'd just told someone I supposed to be trustworthy a secret of mine, that one of the boys in my school had asked me out. Of course, I guess it's no major secret, but in the end of it all I'm someone who values my privacy.At any rate I got a nice big surprise when I found out that three people from a different class no less had amazingly found out about this through their own mysterious and unnamable 'sources'.    &nbsp;  Apparently, there's a certain 'rule' in this school. Of course, how should I know it? I'm the new girl. At any rate, once you receive wind of a new secret, you have to tell someone else, regardless of whether or not it's top-secret. Of course there's a rule to it - you can tell anyone you want, as long as he/she is trustworthy and doesn't get back to the first person that he/she knows the aforementioned first person's secret.And this pattern has worked quite well for my 'trustworthy little friend' over here. When I finally asked him straight-out, "Tell me the name of everyone who knows," expecting at the most maybe ten names. But then this same friend said in protest, "Practically the whole school knows!"    &nbsp;  Aaaaahh...this whole secret thing was supposed to be tied up in a neat package, for me to resolve today with a simple, "No, I don't want to go out with you," and now everyone knows.    Great. Sheesh. The law of school rumours, huh? It's almost like a fascinating game of Chinese Whispers (you know, that game where you pass on some secret message), except way more annoying, and somehow, people always get the facts right..  .    &nbsp;  Amelia

       I've been flinging around the phrase 'I Love You' in school pretty often nowadays. In fact, my messenger screen name, has the words 'I Love You' plastered in four different languages. I think I've just officially entered hormone overdrive.  I think that if I were a psychologist/therapist (is there a difference?), I would diagnose myself the following way...  Psychotherapist Amelia: (clears throat) So I see in your medical records that your hormone levels are very high. Unusually so... Amelia: Well, yes, ahem, you see... PA: However, no matter how high these levels are, it shouldn't affect you in such an untoward way. I mean, COME ON! YOU HAVE A CRUSH ON TEN GUYS! YOU'RE BORDERING ON INSANITY! WHAT AM I SAYING?! YOU ARE INSANE!! A: (breaking down in tears) I'm so sorry! I can't help it! Stupid hormones! Stupid hormones! (starts hitting brain or wherever hormones are produced with a shoe)  Sigh. Maybe I really should enlist some professional help. Know any good psychiatrists? Before I end, can someone please explain the difference between psychologists, therapists, psychotherapists and psychiatrists?  PA: Oh, and before I go, Amelia, I'd like to reprimand you for not knowing the obvious difference between the four professions! Tsk tsk. A: I'm sorry!!! I said I was sorry!!!  Amelia PS: Maybe I should also enlist some medical help.

       Despite the fact that I know that it was stupid, I mean the fact that I constantly lead guys on to think that I 'may' be interested in them, when in truth, my subconscious mind is trying to victoriously tally up how many boys' hearts it can crush before I'm actually found out. I feel like such a snob, and at the same time a sl*t.    &nbsp;  I can't help it. I think I may be a very dangerous carrier of some new yet-undiscovered syndrome. Like 'Chronic Boy Lead-Onnerer Who Won't Stop When She Should And Is Stupidly Self-Absorbed.' Yeah, that's the one. I wonder if it's hereditary? Goodness knows I'd hate my future children to have it too...    &nbsp;  I wonder if I will like my children. I know that sounds horribly  wrong , but I wonder if I'll be close to them, or if I'll suffer some form of post-natal depression or  something !! I can just imagine myself being really jealous of my children eg. they're smarter/prettier/nicer than me.     &nbsp;  I think I'd make a bad mother.    &nbsp;  Yes.    &nbsp;  I would.    &nbsp;  Amelia

       Wow...the days pass by now...in almost senseless blurs, it's quite surprising that I am actually surviving...although I admit that I am a melodramatic person by nature, this time I really feel as though I'm at the end of my tether. It seems as though the meaning to life has just suddenly dissipated, a wisp of fine thread in my fingers.     There used to be so much meaning and purpose in my life. I used to love it. I used to enjoy school, make a difference there, make a difference in my home, and there I say even the world? Now that I think about it, what was it all for? Can anyone really make a difference? &nbsp;It's hard. It's just so hard.   But why am I complaining, right? I guess that on the outside I look...innocent enough. That maybe my life seems complete, but it's not...it's just so vacant...people may say that's easily filled up with studies, family, friends, religion even...but I just don't know...I'm beating myself up senseless over this...   What's the purpose, really...if you know, please tell me.  Amelia

       Aargh....it's folio madness today. Unfortunately, I am now burdened with four new folios to be completed. I feel so tired nowadays. Maybe I'm spending too much time online! ;)  Hehe...Actually, that's definitely the reason why. I can't help it though. I think I'm trying to run away from work...  I can't wait for school to just...end. And I don't just mean school itself, I mean my whole schooling life, as in high school, college, university, the whole works. That is, if I even qualify for university in the first place.  As you can tell I'm in a horribly bitter mood today. I have been the whole week. I wish I could just throw a tanty and get it over and done with. I can't work out this unusual crabbiness in me. :(      Amelia

       Today just felt horrible...don't ask me why. It's so weird how one day I can be on top of the rainbow and the next I feel really down in the dumps. As you may have guessed, today was one of those down in the dumps days, and I don't even know why!    I just felt mad at everyone, and so lethargic the whole day. Thank God though the feeling has passed and I'm ready to be all happy and cheerful tomorrow! :) I'm going back to my hometown this weekend (Penang), so I'll get to miss tuition class which is another bonus! Hehehe...    And although tomorrow I'm enrolling for extra Maths classes at school, I still feel surprisingly light and happy! Yay!    Amelia
