      *Sigh* my mind is all mashed up... headache...   theres so much on my mind.   i wanna get it out.  i wanna solve some of them,  i wanna analyze some, i wanna delete some (the ring!) i wanna add some i wanna store some *Sigh*  i wanna tell some i wanna share some  wow that looks like some kind of poem... haha didnt mean to. this point i'm steady right now, not sad , not happy. just fine. i can add something a lil more and i'll be happy, i can take away something and i can be sad. right now... steady... steady is so boring. i wanna be happy. like everyone else wants to be happy. but i can wait. i will wait for the happy to come :-p . looking for it does not always work well so i'll wait for it to look for me. when? i dont know. i just hope sometime soon. why? because its so boring being smack in the middle of happy and sad/depressed. well anyways... everything has been school school school, so not much time for anything else. argh, im not even doing that well in school but i know i have been trying my best. i just need some help. yay! i get my tutor back next semester! i will pass with flying colors!! :-p until then i can watch myself at the edge of failing, its not like im depending on my tutor its just that lil things are killing me.ah

      http://naucon.net/misc/tests/love_test01.htm  1.  You are attracted to those who are warm and obedience.  2.  In the process of courtship, the approach that would make you     feel irresistable is creative, never let you feel bored.  3.  The impression you would like to give to your lover is loyal,     faithful, never change.  4.  You don't like it when your partner is emotional and/or too     moody; and you don't know how to please him/her.  5.  The kind of relationship you would like to build with your     partner is one that you care not only about the present but     also the future with your partner, a long-lasting relationship     that you can grow with.  6.  You care about the society and morality, you won't do anything     wrong after marriage.  7.  You think of marriage as a precious thing.  Once you get married,     you'll treasure it and your partner very much.  8.  At this moment, you don't have the thirst for love, you can't do     anything for it, you won't fall for it easily.  true true true. ah true

      anyways so yea...after talkin to sophia last nite (ehh more like early early dis morning) i realized something. i've learned sooo much from them. she seems to be able to write what i feel. i jus somehow cant quite express into words the way she does. i TOTALLY understand everything she says. and from him, after all the lectures and talks, i've learned about the harsh realities of life. i kno i hate when he lectures me but there's some truth in what he says. i just wont admit that to him cos den it'd b like admiting  to my parents. but i still hate how he does dat. i mean i hear it enough from my parents. i dont really need to hear it again. or maybe i do.

      i thought i was learning a lesson today about patience...but it turned out to b a lesson about learning to b content...to b happy with what i have...satisfied with what is given to me...appreciative of what ppl do for me...yea it's hard. i mean like the past six months have been pretty tough...my dad's job...some other complications...time away from home for so long (which made me realize how much i missed my friends and appreciated them)...starting junior year...stoopid studying for SATs...growing apart from ppl b/c of my selfishness...busying myself soo much that my breakdowns came almost weekly... but it's okie...cos next year will b different...i'll get a fresh new start. an opportunity to improve things such as my schoolwork...an opportunity to fix things with everyone...an opportunity to do my mission on this world right...an opportunity to get right with God (though that i should do rite now)...an opportunity to mend broken friendships...an opportunity to grow (physically, mentally, AND spirtitually) *sigh* next year will b different...in many different ways...dont kno what's to come...but i promise whatever happens i'll make the best of it...cos there's a reason for everything...it's all part of God's plan...as long as i can accept that wholeheartedly...please hold me accountable for that...
