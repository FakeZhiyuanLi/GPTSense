      Your Everything I want to be your hero, The one to blind your fears. I want to be your security blanket, The one to protect you from harm. I want to be your guiding light, The one to show you the way. I want to be your reason for happiness, The one to brighten your mood at will. I want to be your personal candy store, The one to satisfy your sweet tooth. I want to be your playground, The one to postpone your duties, your escape from cruel reality. I want to be your dream, The one to wish you a good day before you awaken in the morning. I want to be your everlasting love, The one to care for and nurture you. I want to be your everything, The one to supply your every need, The one to give you strength, The one to comfort you... forever.

      I am taking after Ed.. not updating this oh well.. great minds think alike.  the last time I wrote.. I cant remember..  but ok on Monday Ed came over and we had a picinic.. Carolyn spend the night.. we had LOTS of fun.. I got some pictures but not sure how to add them here.. Oh BTW me Carolyn and Debbie went to the new chinese resturante at the clearview.. so not worth it.. Cranbury is soo much better!!!   On Tuesday Carolyn went home.. and I didnt really do anything that I can remember...  On Wednesday I went to work and I put in 6 hours. came home at 3 and then I dont really remember what I did after that..  On Thursday I was supposed to go to Carolyn's because she was having a yard sale but it ended up just being Friday that she had that. so I didnt do anything important.  On Friday.. I didnt do anything.. until Ed and Cyndi came over. that was a lot of fun we watched Coyote Ugly and then Cyndi had to go home and be at work really early so we had to part so sad!!! but I really thanked Cyndi fro bringing him.  On Saturday it was an AWESOME day.  First I got to Roo sit all day that was soo much fun getting to play with Danny Roo all day and I got pictures of that too.. I wish I could download to put them on here that would be really awesome.. anyways the second best part of the day was when my boss Sheri asked me if on Sunday I wanted to go in early to work.. I wasnt sure what she meant.. then she told me that she was short handed in the park and wanted me to come in and work out in the park for the morning before the park opened.. so I was soo excited she told me that I was going to bottle feed all the babies... so then I went home and got ready for Deidra's party.. I was sitting there and then gramma was like Donna, why didnt you bring Ed with you? and I was like well it wasnt my party and I wouldnt feel right inviting someone to a party that isnt mine. and she told me that it was ok.. then like 5 minutes later Cyndi pulled up and I got all excited because my favorite cuzin got here and I ran over to see her and then right as I got to the car I see Ed pop out.. OMG I jumped up and down and was soo excited.. then to top it off he got me a ROSE!!! it was soo beautiful.  (it is haning in my room right now.. upside down so it dries out and will last forever) then me and Ed went for a walk down to the armory and stuff and talked and had a blast and on the way back we was standing there with Cyndi, Linda, their mom and Cody and his mom. and we all started to throw rocks at the poles and the Charles sign... we were having a lot of fun and then we got back to the house and then I was sitting there and mom called me over and I fell on my ass.. that was really funny.. everyone that saw me laughed.. I did too it was HELLA funny.. I did it in slow motion too hehe! then he had to go b/c Cyndi was not feeling well and then we all went home and that was just a great day!!!  On Sunday I got up early and I went to work. I got to feed 4 baby pigs that were 3 days old (at that time) 3 white and 1 black.. I named the black one George! and I got to Roo sit again all day.. anyways then I had to feed Disco the llama and Candice the black sheep and then I had to feed 2 baby cows and 3 baby sheep and goats.. and then it was time to clean up and start the gift shop before it opened.. I opened the gates and the park opens at 10:00 and no one came until 10:30 and I let the first people in and the one lady came back and was like I think something is wrong with your one llama.. so I ran out to see what was wrong with it.. and she had a baby right there.. I got to see the last half of it.. we found out it was a boy and named him Dino so now we have Disco and Dino.. well I got to take care of the baby pigs all day and I got to take care of Danny Roo.. and then it was time for me to go home but I had MAJOR cramps and so it was an ok day.. the park was fun tho.. Sheri said I get to go in the park like 2-3 days a week now.. YAY! so I went home and I laid down and didnt do too much of anything. Oh I forgot that I went to Jess's graduation party.. that was fun NOT!!! I was not feeling well cuz of my cramps and I was trying to talk to Sharon (Jess's mom) and her one friend was being really snooty and I am not going to say what she said to me.. it was really mean and it really hurt me but she is right so I guess it shouldnt matter.. cuz I know that the truth hurts.. then I called home cuz I was really sick and needed to go home so Jenni-fer and Danielle came and got me and they dropped me off and they went to the mall in Ohio  On Monday I wanted to sleep in but I still woke up early.  I was going to go get my permit today and go close my account at the bank and stuff.. but what ended up happening was.. Jenni-fer came and got me and Danielle.. we went to Groves City to find my bank it took us an hour to get to it.. and then we closed it and we went and picked up Shannon and then we went to the mall in Ohio.. Danielle bought a bathing suit.. and I bought a few things that I am not going to say on here lol :P and then we went to Chick-fil-a and ate and it was going to rain so we ran out to the car in the POURING down rain and came home.. and then I got on the computer and talked to Ed and Cyndi and stuff.. Cyndi was having a really bad few days so she came over to hang out with me for awhile.. and then we watched Sleepy Hollow.. she never seen it and then she went home around 1:45. and then I fell asleep.  I woke up this morning and we went to get my film developed and to get my permit.. and then we went out for lunch at Valley Dairy. I got french toast with whip cream and strawberries.. we went to Bilo and got a few things and then we came home and then I cut the grass and we ran out of the string stuff for the weed wacker so I stopped and came back in here and now I am writing this REALLY REALLY long blog hehe.. well I will write again SOON I promsie.. ~Donna~

      I need to... I need to write for I havent in a long while. I need to go somewhere and scream at the top of my lungs. I need to cry and let all my emotions out and go free. I need to run for hours in the middle of nowhere. I need to punch something really hard right now. I need to sleep and not wake up for a really long time. I need to cut and see the blood flow and then passout. I need to flip out on something or someone. I need to tell someone how I really feel and not care. I need a break from life, stress, and anger. I need to get away, turn and not look back. I need to climb and tree, fall and break my neck.  That is how I felt last night.. this morning when I finally started to fall asleep the phone rang.. it was my doctor.  She told me that they didnt have all the tests yet (duh I didnt take them all) and she was like we need to get you back in here to take them.. and I started to cry. and I went back to lay down and Ed called me and stuff we talked for a little bit but he had to go then I went back to sleep and I had a really weird dream about going to skewl and Ed was in it.. here is the dream sorta..  I was geting ready to go to skewl it was in the fall and I was moving into my new appartment and my one neighbor was this really freaky guy.. and he came over and he was bothering me and stuff.. well the one night he came over and tried stuff.. and I tried to get him to stop and he wouldnt then he left finally and then I called Ed.. and he came up the next morning and he kinda took care of him.. and I felt really safe when he was up there with me and I didnt want him to leave but I knew he had to go back home to go to skewl so he left and I was crying sitting on my bed and stuff.. and then I woke up and I really was crying..  it was really messed up.. oh well and then I got outta bed and ate dinner and then I listened to mom yell at me and then I went and started to type out my poems again and then Cyndi showed up and we were having fun being all drunk-like and stuff.. then she left and now it is just me and Ed talking.. I hope he can come over tomorrow but if not I understand but I really want him to come over.. well I need to go now.. ttyl ~Donna~

      Well today was another day.. went to work and I got to hold Danny Boy all day and feed him.. he is a 3 month old Red Kangaroo.. his mother pushed him away(how sad) but now we get to handle him a lot so it is all good.. he is actually kinda famous (around here) cuz he is doing soo well health wise and all.. I might get to keep him for a weekend or something sometime.. tomorrow I am going to get my permit.. after mom gets home from work. Me and Mariah played frizbe today and me and Danielle rode bikes.  Bone-head still claims it is a girl.  I am begining to think that MAYBE MAYBE she is telling the truth this time.. but I will believe it only when I see it. I am kinda having a sad day. I think part of it has to do with the rain and stuff. but it seems that I am being put down and belittled a lot today. I know I am stupid and stuff.. but today I really feel it more.  me and mom got into a fight today again. oh well I dont care anymore. we (mom me and daddy) were talking about that lady again that let her live-in boyfriend beat and KILL her 2y/o daughter.. Daddy knows her.. she is waiting to go to trial, her bf is in jail and she is just riding around like NOTHING! pisses me off.. to think that some lady could let her bf kill her daughter and then not even care.. grrr ppl piss me off.  oh well it is just one of those days I guess.. well I am gonna go now.. ttyl ~Donna~ P.S. I am tired of people telling me how stupid I am and how worthless I am.. OK???? I know it is true but quit fucking rubbin it in!!!!!!!

      Well this is it.. my very last time I will ever have to go to this skewl again.. I am a graduate.. I still cant believe it.. Well last night me and Ed had lots of fun, first Cyndi, Ed and I went to the Beaver Valley Mall and hung out for awhile. Then we came back to my house and we watched a good movie, Freaky Friday.  Me and Ed laid in eachother's arms til they had to go. I was sad for him to leave but at least I did get to see him for awhile.  Him and his family are going to come up after Graduation. I was kinda hoping that they could come to the ceremony but that is ok, they will come up afterwards.  I was crying at skewl today because it is the last time I am prolly going to see most of them peoples. some I will see such as Jinay-fer and Crystal aka (Grieta Cabeza) Well I need to go get ready to go now..

ROOOAAAAAAARRRRRR!.. that was Eathan he is soo cute.. he was a little skitish around me until I started to tickle him then he got used to me. *snort* HEHE that is just too funny.. well I am going to go now.. but yesterday was great and then his family came and met my family.. his dad said that I was just as talented as my "mother-in-law" that made me laugh.. oh well ttyl byes ~Donna~

      Well.. Ed met my family.. most of them anyways.. and more than just 5-10 minutes of hi and bye.. he hung out here from the moment I pulled into the driveway from work til about 10ish.  We had a blast, my family really likes him and he says that he really likes my family so it is all good.. no I take that back it is all GREAT! tomorrow I get to go meet his parents.. I talked to his dad on the phone for about 5-10 minutes while Jen was doing my hair he is soo funny and great, I think we will get along great! Oh guess what happened today in the life of Carolyn? she was telling me about it.. ok she is a sample girl at walmart.. and Uncle B took her to work today and she couldnt find the station that she had to be at so Uncle B was like ok you stay here and talk to the lady or whatever I will go look for the station.. so when he left the lady was like "so I see you brought your husband today?!?" Carolyn BUSTED out laughing (I would too hehe) and she was like umm that is not my husband that is my UNCLE!! lol.. she said that she laughed all day today about it.  I talked to my little buddy Luke earlier.. he is really kewl.. he has a mental disability and people make fun of him a lot and stuff.. I think he is adorable, but I have a heart for people like that.  he has the heart and the mind of a 4-5 year old.. I dont know if I really like his sister all that well.. see what happened is a year ago his mother died so now he has to live with his older sister who is about 23-24 years old.. and she is kinda real strict on him.. and she I dont know.. there is just a few things about her that he tells me that bothers me.. well anyways.. she (Michelle) is going on a trip this summer and and dont know what to do with him.. so he is talking to her about maybe letting him come here and stay with me.. he told me tonight that she wants to talk to me and everything but she is at work a lot and stuff so she is not home too often.. Well I will keep you all updated on how it goes.. when I get to talk to her.. I have met her before.. but we didnt really discuss this at all.. I think I could handle it.. he is not like on meds or anything or have any seizures and stuff.. he is just mentally behind.. got the mental capacity of a 4-5 year old as I said before.. oh well my Edzo is back on now so I need to find out what is going on tomorrow.. I am going to meet his parents! I will write later buh byes ~Donna~

      Well I just got home from work.. it was a HARD day.. we made over $3,000.00.  I started at 3.. I went earli to walk around the park but they were soo slammed that I clocked in and worked.. I dont really like to close, b/c I am done at 8 alright? well I dont even get to start my cleaning til about 7:45 and then when it is all done and I am done with my drawer (counting the money and paperwork) it is almost 9.  but I get paid $6 an hour so hopefully it will all be good in the end. I got home and I looked at mom and Danielle's pictures that they got developed.  I was ready to cry and I am still ready to because for 1 I saw pictures of Nicky when he was 1 day old when we had him, and 2 b/c I KNOW that I took a bunch of pictures of Nicky that day, and Mariah (the dog) when she was a puppy, and Lily and Diamond (the rabbits) when they were kits (baby bunnys) and I went the other day and got all the film that I could find developed and I didnt get any of them back.. makes me really sad! I had a hard day and I wanted to go through the park and see my little baby goat.  but I didnt get a chance to b/c I was running really behind, and my boss is really kewl, but he dont really help out at all, he was flirting with these 2 girls that come in 3-4 times a day.. if and when they come Mike becomes useless! other than that he is really kewl and stuff and he really helps you out.  I got a POUNDING headache and I am ready to cry.. I miss my Nicky soo bad!!! ok I am back now.. I needed to go to the bathroom and clean my face.. it got kinda dirty cuz I actually started to cry for a minute there.. sorry.  I really need to talk to my Edzo but he is at a birthday party and he said he will be back soon.. I hope so.. I am going to find something to do for awhile and then I might get off the computer and go lay down!  that is all I really know what to say right now.. ttyl! ~Donna~

      well Dan and Tara took me and Ed to the Pioneer drive in to see a few movies.. they sat in the car cuz they were cold.. me and Ed kept warm by cuddling!  we didnt do anything bad... if you consider Kissing bad then I guess we was! sorry!  Ed is a very very good kisser too.  He tells me that he has never kissed.. but he is really good, so I dont know if I believe that or not.. JK! We watched the first one.. Van Housing or something like that.. me and Ed didnt understand it very much and we HONESTLY was trying to understand.. the 2nd movie was The Dawn of the Dead.. I only remember about 10-20 minutes in the begining b/c I fell asleep in Ed' very comfy arms.  it was a great night, it was chilly when we left eachothers arms but when we were together we were fine.  The stars were out and it was very clear night.. Hey Ed.. you see the Ship?!?!? (inside joke). I got home at 2:20 am and my mother was a little upset about me getting home so late.. I told her that we left as soon as the movie was over.  cuz we did! well I went to bed and this morning I woke up and had to go to the hospital to get a bunch of tests done.  I got there, and the dr dude came in with 11 tubes.. I was like excuse me?!?!? and he was like yeah we got a LOT of tests that your doctor wants done.  I was like I am going to passout already! and he told me that I was going to be fine and he pulled out the needle and I was getting all queezy and stuff.. they were trying to keep my mind occupied and not think about it so he was asking me about my new job at Living Treasures and stuff.. then I was like I am going...... next thing I knew my mother was holding me up and the needle was gone and mom was holding a rag on my forehead.. I heard the doctor say.. "she is the fastest person to passout I have ever seen" and my mom was like "she mad the records then" and they were all laughing and then I kinda went back out.. and then they carried me to a recliner chair and he was like, "ok just tell me when she is ready!" I was like for what? and he was like well we only got 2 tubes and we need to get the other 9 filled.. I was like what? why couldnt you have filled them up when I was out? and he told me that when you passout then they have to take the needle out.. so when I was ready then they would stick me again.. I busted into tears.. all I could think of was "I really wish Ed was here!" then mom was trying to calm me down and she was asking me if I really liked Ed and I was like yes VERY much! she told me not to fall too hard too fast, so I dont get hurt again! I dont think I will get hurt again. but we ended up leaving.. I am going to go another day to get the rest of the tests done.. I didnt feel like passing out anymore today. so we went to Kings Resturante and I got chocolate-chip pancakes and some bacon and then we came home and I laid on the couch for about 10 minutes and then I got on and now I am waiting for Ed to get on before I go to work at 3:30.. well I am going to go now.. oh wait before I go.. I wanted to tell you all that I did get the job at Living Treasures! it is soo great! I love it there, now I get a 25% discount in the gift shop and my family gets in free to the park whenever they want! I will stay prolly everynight t0o check out my little goat that was born the other day! well I am going to go! ttyl Love you Ed! ~DONNA~

      Ed, you make me feel so warm inside I dont know if I am able to hide I think of you and your warm embrace That thought brings a big smile on my face  You came into my life very unaware Of all the pains that I bare But now that I have you they dissappear My heart melts when your voice I hear  I close my eyes and dream of tomorrow This feeling is weird, there is no sorrow You are the sun up in the sky For I feel if I lost you I would die  You are the sweetest person I ever met How am I so lucky, thats what I dont get I hope I'm not going too fast, dont want to rush For I am afraid that our friendship will crush  I feel like I can tell you anything without a doubt I feel like you know what I am really about I want someones love to hold and to share To spend all my time with whom I really care  I have found a great friend in someone like you I am not sure what exactly what to do  All I know is I want to be with you as much as I can   sorry I want to finish this poem but mom is yelling for me to get off the computer.. I have been working on this since you got off Ed.. and I was kinda distracted by Dan lol.. thats ok tho.. I think it is pretty good so far.. night!

         ok now this poem is kinda korny and stuff.. but I was in such a good mood that I couldnt put how I really feel and at the time felt into words.. ok here it goes  I met someone the other day Who makes the dark clouds go away He makes the sun come out and stay I want to run, jump, and play  You dont know what you mean to me Our love is going to be deeper than the sea Holding eachother watching TV Or having a picnic under a tree  I pour my heart out to only you Not many people I can do that to We have more in common than just a few We can make this work great, a love anew   ok that is all I have soo far.. but I am still thinking... I will finish it someday I love you Ed! I really do, I think about you all the time!

Well today was pretty good, it was very long, I went to skewl and then I came home and finished Ed's pillow (took me only an hour) and then as I was finishing it up he called me. YAY! we talked on the phone for 96 minutes (my phone keeps track hehe) and then I got on the computer and sent him the picture of his pillow.. just the front the back is a SURPRISE! so then he had to eat and I got a shower and then I was sitting around and then Deidra called and wanted to go for a walk so we walked around and then we went and got in gram's hot tub! it was soo great, (it would have been better if Ed was there).  I cant wait til tomorrow when I get to meet him face to face for the very first time.  Tomorrow will be 1 week since we met eachother. Cyndi is the one that introduced us! Thanx Cyndi!!! well I am going to go now.. I have nothing more to say!
