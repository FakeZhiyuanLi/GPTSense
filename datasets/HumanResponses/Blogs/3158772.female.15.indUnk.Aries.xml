      ..Ok right now i don't feel like talking so I'll just put up a bunch of quiz results I took on Quizilla. Oh yeah. If u like fanfiction... Go to  urlLink http://www.fanfiction.net  and check out my work. My pen name is Squid's*Charm THANKYOU! ^^  You are the biggest Evanescence fan! Your awesome! Send me a message!     urlLink Are you a REAL Evanescence fan, or just pretending to be?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla      You are Captain Jack Sparrow. You're fun loving, boisterous and a little full of yourself. You tend to look out for your own interests- although you have a compassionate side; you'll only help others if it benefits you as well. Rarely are you serious about anything. Like many people, you're just trying to be free. You also somehow manage to look masculine despite the fact that you wear mascara and move like a drag queen.    urlLink    Which Johnny Depp are You?      brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla      Twitch ~ You think that little Twit is the cutest? Or did you just choose wrongly? Well, if you DID choose wrongly, I suggest you get out of here! If you didn't choose wrongly, I SO agree with you! ^_^ Isn't Twitch such  so cute ?!    urlLink   Who's cutest to you? (*HOLES*) [for girls]     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla      You want to cuddle squid*-*  Maybe its the fact of his badboy attitude...or maybe its the fact of him not knowing HOW to keep his mouth SHUT!  Whatever the reason you want to hug this boy to death...have fun^-^    urlLink   Which Boy from Disney's Holes would you cuddle?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla      You're depressed. Really you are. And you definitely have a reason. You often space out and stare at things blankly, even if you're normally hyper and energetic. This is because nothing really seems important anymore. You might just be sad right now, or you might be manic depressive. Don't worry. Have some cocoa and stuff'll be ok.     urlLink   How Depressed are You?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla      Dark magician. You love the dark because of it's beauty and just the life that no-one else sees. Mysterious, calm, quiet... But that doesn't mean you're not friendly!   Please rate ^^    urlLink   What kind of dark person are you?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla      My Bloody Valentine by Good Charolette. you lost punker, but good unto you i liek that song and i bet you do too! if youve never heard it well then get out there and hear your own theme song!!    urlLink    What's Your Theme Song?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    ~Charm~

      Could life be anymore duller? God I swear I hate it sometimes... Anyway I wish some people would stop mopping about their problems when all it's about is "OMG! My boyfriend broke up with me" and whine and cry over it... There are more important problems than that... God. Hmph. Most people don't know who has a real problem, mostly people care about only themselves. Like the MORONS they are. Stupid preps. Well anyway... If there's something that I totally love... That would have to be my favorite actors obsessions! lol. CHAD MICHAEL MURRAY IS A SEXXII BEAST! ^^ RIGHT SHANNON! HA! Well I gtg.  ~Charm    Congratulations, you're TOURNIQUET! Please send me a message! PS: Good Charlotte ROX!    urlLink   -x-Which Evanescence song are you?-x-     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla

      Life is something I didn't want at one point. Sometimes I still don't. I mean life for me is harder than it seems. Especially when I hide behind my smile. I'm a good liar with my charming smile... Very good. My heart breaks very easily and I care a lot about my friends since they are the only thing that keeps me going. The only people to keep me sane... My friends... I love them so... I am a cutter... I still cut every once and a while... out of pure urge but I'm trying to get help so far I'm doing quite well. I'm on the road to recovery. Which is a VERY good thing. I'm also an authoress on FanFiction.net... I write mostly Holes fics but I have one that is about the book Cut by Patricia McCormick which I might add is a wonderful book. And now I must go... I'll leave with a poem. Scream Don't give up I know it's tough. You hurting inside, Trying your best to survive. Don't give into the urge, Of that need to cut surge. Your not alone, Trust me I know. I've been right there where you are, I have more than one scar, Left upon my arm. You will be safe from harm. ~Charm~ "How will you know I am hurting if you cannot see my pain? To wear it on my body tells what words connot explain..."
