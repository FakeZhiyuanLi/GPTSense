      Well it is sunday morning and I'm out of cream for my coffee.  Sunday mornings are not suppose to be like that. In fact I should have been served coffee and breaky in bed by some tall good looking stud! That way the stud would have to get dressed to go for cream and not me.  At least that's the way I see it in my world. The weeks events took me to work and a funeral. A close friend of mine lost her great grandmother and the service was held on Friday.  I grew up with Shannon and have always been concidered one of the family. Shannon has a large family who are all very close and know how to celebrate life. It was wonderful to see them all and great to take a little trip down memory lane. So that is four weddings and a funeral this summer, I bet that would make a great movie! It's cold in my apartment this morning and I'm just the picture of loveliness with my flannel nighty, housecoat and sweater on. Shouldn't it be summer for pete's sake?! After I run for coffee cream I will sit and try to fiqure out how to put pictures up on this thing so stay tuned...

      Well let's see, what did I do today?  I did laundry.  Yup a productive day off. Tonight I'm going out to dinner with my son and daughter in-law in celebration of their birthdays. Paul turned 27 (that's what happens when you have children at the age of 12 and your so young and your son is so old) on the 8th of this month and Dana turns 25 on the 25th. We are going to a quaint little resturant called "Le Speggett". There are only about 8 tables in the place and you have to make a reservation weeks in advance. The food is to die for! Ok I better run downstairs and get my clothes out of the dryer before someone empties it and sees my large cotton panties. The last time that happened I caught the girl with them in her hand, it wasn't pretty and when I was done she was brighter pink then the colour of my briefs! As if it isn't bad enough to have to put your clean clothes into a dryer which has been filled with god knows what, you run the risk of someones paws on your nickers!  Have a great day all

        Well today is the begining of my postings.      I found this wonderful site through a dear freind of mine who enlightened me of a daily posting being done by mutual friend. This friend (and I use that word loosely lol ) happens to be a tad brain dead in his faith of my beloved Tiger Cats.     I look forward to writing and keeping you informed on my well being.
