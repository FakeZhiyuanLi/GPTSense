						   Yup, i am all out of ideas. i feel a sponge who has lost its ability to soak up things. Right now my mind is blank, i cant work , i cant think and i cant stand this feeling. All my life i have wanetd to be the best in what i should do. i have tried like a man possessed, but then , times like these hamper my thinking and my work  Its been almost a week now, i have not been productive. Either i have to much on my mind or i have nuthin left to think about. I dont know. All i want right now is to bloody leave everything and go off somewhere to relax.  These last six months have been hard on me. Lot of people have lost faith in me, some have stopped respecting me and my words others have stopeed listning to me. I am sick of doing what people want me to do. Who are they to tell me on how to lead my life. I just want to leave everything an go off somewhere where i can just focus on inproving myself and my work. I need time, I need space and I need to be alone ........  Pixel Pusher

						   My god is everybody going cuckoo? Why do people think its easy to design sites. Why does everybody want that you give them world class designs in one day !  For me designing a site is first getting to understand what the client wants, and how to basically give him a good layout which actually helps him. I mean how do i understand, research and create a layout in one freaking day.  I have always been a person who works really good under pressure. Give me work with 15 days to it, chances are ill only work for 7 days on it, but ill finsih it on time :). In my last 6 years of experience i have been able to give almost 90% of my work on time.  But now deadlines are getting to my head..... maybe i need to relax, have a chilled drink and go out for 2-3 hours .....  HAVE FUN, TAKE CARE Pixel Pusher

						   hmmm.. what should i write.. first of all i should just write down why I created a Blog. Am I following a trend? should I also have a blog because thousands of people around the world keep one. Or I wanted a place where i could write what i feel sometimes and am not able to let it out. I dont know but i guess ill find out once i start blogging (is this the right word) regularly.  Okie i would just like to give a warning, you might not find this blog updated for days, maybe weeks. I know you must be saying "why keep a blog when u dont want to update it?". Ahh but thats what im trying to find out "Why in the blazes im starting a blog". One more thing i misspell a lot :) so dont mind if you see numerous errors in my posts.  I guess this is all i would like to write for now. I hope i keep on Blogging.   Have Fun, Take Care Pixel Pusher
