						   I work in an office park in the midst of several square miles of light industrial shops. About a mile from here, there's a place called the Peppersauce Cafe, where I go for lunch most days.   The other day, they announced their Memorial Day weekend plans:     We will be closed Friday May 28th and Monday May 31st 'cuz we want to      I like that.  And the food's really good, too.

						   What to do if your computer freezes:  1. Don't panic. Gently unplug the computer.  2. Move the computer to a warm location, but not too hot. Near a heater or fireplace (not too near!) is good.  3. Place a towel under it to collect run-off.  4. Do not use any sharp objects to remove ice, especially on the motherboard. Remove any large pieces of ice that fall off.  5. When the computer is unfrozen and completely dry, plug it back in and test it.  From  toddashi's LJ

						    Star Trek: Enterprise  has been renewed for another season. I was really looking forward to seeing them all die heroically (or at least look like they'd do so in some cliffhanger) at the end of the Xindi story-arc tomorrow night. That's okay news. I like  Enterprise  well enough when I get to see it.   The bad news - there's always bad news: They're moving it to Friday night. This is bad in a couple of ways. The most obvious is that Friday night is not a big TV-watching night. Less obvious unless you live here in the Endless Suburb is that the viewing schedule might be even more disrupted than it already has been. The local UPN station also carries the Phoenix Suns, who run around on basketball courts all over the NBA. In event of a scheduling conflict, this  always  pushes  Enterprise  to some obscure dungeon of a timeslot, accesible only to gnomes and video recorders.  I prefer making TV shows to watching them, and so seldom tape anything off the air. I don't have a TiVo, and I haven't built my own PVR yet. So I miss a lot, and next year, will miss even more. And yet: I won't miss that much. Yeah, it's Star Trek, but it's also just another show I see sometimes.

						   Any blog that lets you post via e-mail can't be all bad.  Update: The mailing program, on the other hand, is out of control. I mailed the original message in from my office e-mail account, which runs under Microsoft Outlook. It appeared here in a different typeface than the rest of the messages. When I opened the editor to see why: it was obvious: My little 12 word message was  buried  in a screenful of HTML and other odd markup.  Memo to self: Be sure to check 'plain text' when emailing to this blog.

						   One of the things one does if one wishes to post somethig in one's blog every weekday (except vacations and holidays, when one avoids computers) is to plan ahead - have a couple of pieces ready to slap up onto the old blog in case a busy day comes around - or even a slow day.  Especially on a weblog such as this, which refuses to take rhetorical potshots at Bush Jr because it is unethical to attack an unarmed opponent.  But one digresses.  In order to get ahead on entries, one was planning to collect the titles of one's junk e-mail and write something snarky about the best few.  A problem with that plan: All of the junk e-mail had boring, boring  titles.  One nearly gave up on the effort, despite the sudden increase of unsolicited e-mail (notice how one has not mentioned the subject of a well-known musical comedy sketch yet), when the final letter of the day crossed ones inbox:   bowling ball necromancers from 6865   No idea what they're pushing, but one would pay a modest sum to see that movie.

						   John Robinson over at  urlLink Sore Eyes  points us to this lovely bit of logic:   urlLink Sherlock Holmes: Visitor to a Small Planet    While atempting to identify a saboteur aboard the Starship Enterprise (NCC-1701A), Captain Spock makes the following statement: "An ancestor of mine maintained that whenever you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be true."  We are all familiar with this maxim; it is Mr. Sherlock Holmes' most fundamental rule of logic and deduction. Indeed, the "process of elimination" is a longstanding and respected technique in such diverse fields as forensics, plant hybridization, and computer programming. Mr. Spock is very precise in his speech at all times. He is also known to be careful in the attribution of quotations. When challenged by Dr. Leonard McCoy (in Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home) he correctly identifies the phase "Angels and ministers of grace, defend us" as coming from Hamlet, Act I Scene IV. On another occasion (Star Trek V: The Final Frontier) when Dr. McCoy replies "Herman Melville" to Captain James Kirk's "All I ask is a tall ship, and a star to steer her by", Spock points out that the line is from John Masefield. I feel certain that Mr. Spock would attribute the above statement, expressed in this particular fashion, only to Mr. Holmes. This implies that Mr. Holmes is an ancestor of Mr. Spock. My task was to validate or dismiss this.

						   NOTAM is an abbreviation for  Notices to Airmen . This is the coolest one I've seen in a long time, for Mojave Airport in California:   June 3, 2004   Advisory notice to all concerned – Mojave Airport will be engaged in spaceport operations June 21st with potential extensions through June 22nd.  Aircraft will be PPR (prior permission required) for landing beginning June 18th 1600l.    Spaceport  operations.  Space Ship One made it to 100 kilometers altitude - the "official" edge of space - less than an hour ago as I write this.

						   I love stand-up comedy.  I love the form. I love writing it. I love performing it. I love watching it.  I live in Phoenix, where there -might- be one good comedy club. I haven't been to the new one in Scottsdale yet, it might be okay. But in general, I really can't stand comedy clubs. Or bars, for that matter.  This is a bit of a dilemma.  Moving to Los Angeles is not an option - I would have moved there at least ten years ago otherwise.  On the other hand, I  can  post stand-up bits here.  H'mmmm...

						   Today's tempest here in the teapot that is Blogistan:  Dave Winer, citing costs both in cash and health (stress, sanity), and forgetting to mention that he's not as wealthy as he used to be, suddenly pulled the plug on much of Weblogs.com. He owns it, he's one guy, he can't do customer service. It's confusing because some weblogs.com addresses - most notably Doc Searls - are still working. I'm not posting any links; the situation is very dynamic right now so certain links will just break.  Disclaimer: I have a weblog on weblogs.com, but it's long since dormant, contains nothing of import, and I can't remember what it's called or how to access it. I was playing with the toy, is all. It will go away.  I think everybody is wrong to some degree:  Bloggers: this is a free service. Free services can go away. This weblog is on Blogger, which is part of Google, and it could go away.  Pay  services can go away. At the lowest level, it's just bits on a computer, and Stuff Happens. Keep good backups.   Dave: Would it have killed ya to give a weeks notice? Well, maybe. You are moving and don't need the extra stress of a major sysadmin headache just now. But surely there was a better way to handle this: Post a message at Weblogs.com apologizing for the short notice, stating you need to pull the plug, emphazizing that there will be little to no tech support, and thanking the weblogs.com community for the interest over the years.  UserLand and Dave: When you split, very little was said about the status of Weblogs.com. Maybe nothing. It's cool that RSS is now under Creative Commons and you're gonna open-source Frontier (I think a Linux port of Frontier would be super-cool, but I digress (and no, I'm not in a positionto do such a port)). Are there any other interesting pitfalls out there?  Me: Surely I've over-simplified the technical problems.   Thanks, Dave, for Weblogs.com. Sorry it has to go away. If you have to drop the ping service too, I'll understand, but please transfer it.

						   So the Enterprise - this is the one with the beagle - limps back to Earth after saving not  only  the planet, but much of the Galaxy (which is overkill, but what the heck). Don't tell me you didn't expect they'd win. They did, but Archer is nowhere to be seen. He seems to have gone up with the final cataclysmic explosion.  The beagle hasn't figured this out yet.  They get to Earth, badly in need of some body and fender work. Nobody on Earth is answering the phone. This is odd.  A shuttle is sent to San Francisco. Still nobody's answering the radio. Air traffic control is missing. The guys on the shuttle don't notice and go on talking about their upcoming shore leave. Suddenly the shuttle is attacked by WWII fighter planes. I didn't catch the markings on the planes.  Cut to: A Nazi German field hospital. Overflowing with wounded, yet the Nazi flag is properly flown. An officer enters, talks to the head medic about this guy - badly burned - who was brought in last night. It is, of course, Archer. A second Nazi appears. He's a blue alien in a Nazi uniform. He may or may not recognize Archer's uniform, which is in pretty good shape considering the explosion and all.  So: the crew doesn't have a clue what's up: Time warp? Alternate history?   And Archer's out cold at an Undisclosed Location. How did he get there? Did he Leap or what?   And the crew thinks Archer is dead.  And the beagle needs to go walkies.  And the show's moving to Friday next season.  Yes,  Enterprise  is bad SF. Yes, they should have all died heroically while saving the Earth. But this show might well be crossing the "so bad it's good" line.

						   There could be minor spoilers.  Saw the new Harry Potter movie last night. My impressions:   Fun movie, once it got going.   It wasn't that much darker than the other two.   Some of the new design was nice. Some was tacky. Hogwarts felt  smaller  than in the last two movies, though I really like the more-mountainous setting.   Shame about the dress code.   It felt like there were things missing. They got all of the key items on the checklist, but couldn't linger on many of them. This movie has the feel of a longer movie that was snipped for running time.   If Michael Gambon had been cast as Dumbledore from the start, it would have been okay with me. But I missed Richard Harris. I'll get over it.   David Thewlis was just right as Professor Lupin.   Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, and Rupert Grint are growing as actors.   Being a British TV fan made some of the minor roles more fun to watch.   One Ringwriath costume can cover a whole platoon of Dementors.     I'll see this again, and look forward to the extended DVD.

						   So I'm driving through a pleasant part of Phoenix yesterday.   I passed the Johnson residence. Attached to the mailbox was a campaign sign. "Vote for T.C. Johnson" it said. Below that: "Olympia City Council".  Um.   I'm a geography geek, and I am aware of no Olympia closer than the capital of Washington.  Mr and Mrs. Johnson: I'm sure you're proud of your child T.C., but that particular sign isn't gonna generate a single vote. Unless you're voting absentee in Olympia.  Just saying.

						   Yes, My Canada includes Joey DeVilla.  My North America includes Joey DeVilla. This is convenient for me, as I am not officially Canadian.   Becoming Canadian is somewhat tempting. But the last time I took the Canadian Immigration test online, I got 74/100. One needs 75 points to be considered.   So I still live in Glendale, Arizona - part of the Endless Suburb that we know as Phoenix.

						   Light snarkiness today. Much work and some catching up, since I left early to do the vision thing.  So after the Eyeglass Incident, I've had a complete eye exam (they're fine, just nearsighted), and a kinda weird reversal of my vision.  I had to get a dilated eye exam, so they put the drops in, checked me out, and all was well. I wear contacts on occasion, usually for theatrical purposes, so I was led into the contact lens room to try the newest Acuvues. That, combined with the still-dilated eyes - the drops take a couple hours to wear off - left me farsighted.  I was in a shopping mall, and needed to eat, so I went to the sit-down place in the mall and tried to order. Couldn't  read!  This was alarming, even though it was temporary. Explained the situation to the waiter, then ordered a cheeseburger. I couldn't read the book I had, but I could see the Yankees game on TV just fine, so baseball it was.  Hopefully, I'll look distinguished when I eventually need bifocals.

						   Only light snarkiness today - my eyeglass frame disintegrated at the office this morning. The glasses are too unsteady to use for driving. I'm  way  nearsighted. This  is  the spare pair.  What's a cynic to do?  I went out to the car and got my swim goggles out of my gym bag.  These goggles were purchased off the shelf for less than ten dollars. They have vision correction built in. They're made by Body Glove. I can drive in them. I look silly, but I'm safe.  I want another pair, but I can't find them on line. Maybe Sports Authority still has some. Must look.

						   It's just a minor thing, really.  Nancy's song "Fate" is bouncing around inside my head today. It's full of sci-fi imagery and mystery. It's one of my favorite songs.

What's driving me crazy is I can't remember part of the chorus:  And now she's got a ______, a CD and a key To an interdimensional gate But it's not gonna do her a damn bit of good If she doesn't believe in fate

						   Went to see  The Day After Tomorrow  yesterday.  Bad, bad disaster movie. Good special effects. Interesting politics.  Knowing in advance that the plot wasn't very good, and not expecting anything better from Roland "Of course the alien computers speak ASCII" Emmerich, your intrepid reporter was able to stifle screams of pain until the third act, and to not actually disturb other patrons until the closing credits.  You will have heard the plot by now: Dennis Quaid discovers impending ice age, ice age remodels Los Angeles, then New York, effects budget runs out, movie ends. You may have even heard that the Republican National Church doesn't much care for this movie. I hadn't heard that particular story until moments before the movie started.  Here's why the GOP hates this movie: it isn't the preachy, completely expected "Mankind is ruining the planet" speeches (which were so cliched the filmgoing audience could have easily sang along). No, they hate what is possibly the best characterization in the movie.  See, a disaster movie of this scale (instant ice age - just add CGI) aimed at American audiences will inevitably feature a scene with the President. In  Independence Day , we got President Bill Pullman, ex-fighter-jock, and cut from whole cloth.   Ice Age    Day After Tomorrow  gives us Perry King and Kenneth Welsh as President Blake and Vice President Becker. That's what it says in the credits, but what we see on screen is a Bush/Cheney show that could be taken on the road.  Welsh's VP is clearly in charge of things - he's the busy man surrounded by aides and sounding Presidential or at least right-wing Republican. King's President is seen alone in the Oval Office. When a key decision needs to be made, the President redeems himself by cutting the obvious puppet strings and making the correct, painful decision.   I applaud that - it was the second-best part of the movie (after the effects).  My suspension of disbelief - already tenuous by this point - crumbled during the third act upon observing that the space station seemed to have been placed into a retrograde orbit. And I actively cursed at the screen when I saw the following credit:   Inspired by the book "The Coming Global Superstorm" by Art Bell and Whitley Streiber  Art Bell and Whitley Streiber?  Gibbering, I was led from the theater.

						    urlLink Dinah Sanders  posts this:  Doris Haddock is the woman who walked across the U.S. from California to Washington D.C. at age 89 - 90 to dramatize the public demand for campaign finance reform. She is now running for the U.S. Senate in her home state of New Hampshire. See her biography and more at  urlLink http://www.grannyd.com/  As you'll see from the speech below, she remains an intelligent and highly concerned citizen. A motto of her campaign: "Think positive about our future and work like hell."  From Granny D's speech at the Alliance for Democracy Convention in Boston, Wednesday, July 21, 2004:  On history, and how short the American experiment truly is:  Well, Friends, here we are in a city that has known the struggle of free people against tyranny, their rise above personal self-interest, their rise during the occasions of human emergency to move forward with courage, with intelligence and a long view to the future of the people, and with great energy and a perfect concentration on victory. "We must all hang together or assuredly we shall all hang separately" is a phrase spoken in Philadelphia by a man of this city--a phrase that again has personal meaning to us.  We are not so far in time from 1776. My own life extends over 40% the way there.  On coming together:  Two centuries ago, there were probably Americans who didn't quite like part of the Declaration of Independence or who did think George Washington was just the right man to lead the Continental Army, or who thought there should be a few more articles to the Bill of Rights before they would sign on. They were barnacles on that Yankee Clipper that sped despite them toward liberty, and they are now less than footnotes.   On the ballot itself:  And I shall vote for [Kerry] on October 12th. I think all Democrats should vote three weeks early by mailed ballots. That way, there will be a paper record of our votes. You may have suspicions about the voting machines, but I assure you that the Secretaries of State and the town and county clerks of this nation take their jobs very seriously and our paper ballots in their hands will be our best defense against any secretly rigged or otherwise malfunctioning or sabotaged machines--and the Bush Administration can stop talking about putting off the election, for that issue may not be as dead as we hope.    urlLink Read it all.

						        Waiting for a bus in downtown Seattle, I see a disheveled and possibly deranged man with an enormous duffle bag sidling down the sidewalk, stopping to bellow "Are you going to the library?!" at each and every person in turn. Most ignore him until he moves on, but some -- out of compulsive politeness, or because they have somehow mistaken this raving for a sincere query -- begin to reply "No, I'm waiting for my --" at which point the man icuts them short with an impassioned and spittle-intensive "GO TO THE LIBRARY!!!"    I dunno.  Call me cynical, but I just don't think Seattle's literacy program is all that effective.        - Matthew Baldwin,  urlLink Defective Yeti

						   Can somebody explain to me why the driver of a Cadillac Escalade, with almost double the ground clearance of my Honda Element,  was so afraid to go over the speed bumps the other day?    This was in a shopping center parking lot. Now it's true that many shopping centers have bad speed bumps: speed bumps which would stop large tanks in their tracks until the brave men and women of the Corps of Engineers came forward and applied a pound of C-4 so the tanks and the convoy could get through and defeat the enemy. But this shopping center has reasonable speed bumps, which can be taken at 5-7 mph with only minor discomfort, even by my passengers with bad backs.  The security golf-carts don't even slow down for these bumps.    This Cadillac Escalade was slowing to sub-walking speed, possibly even sub-crawling speed. As nobody was actually crawling around the parking lot this would be hard to judge, but slow pedestrians were passing this Escalade as it slooooowed dooooown to go ooooover the buuuuump.    I dunno. Those Cadillacs have a lot of electronics. Maybe the guy was testing his altimeter.

						    Five years ago today:     Procedure to Follow in the Event That Building 245 is Attacked by Vikings     Since the decline of the Carolingian Empire in the 10th century, Building 245 of the NASA Ames Research Center has been subject to periodic raids by Viking marauders. These marauders generally attack in search of gold, religious icons, and other forms of plunder. The   NASA Ames Barbarian Affairs Office  has established  the following procedures for defense against Viking raids:        One of many reasons we're not on the moon today drinking champagne is  urlLink this little gem .

						    Thirty-five years ago today:     In the entire city of Pittsburgh, there was no bigger space enthusiast than me.   Eight years old, a voracious reader, I could quote chapter and verse on the entire Apollo Project, the astronauts, mission control, the mission to the moon - even the benefits that we would see from the space program.    While most of the advanced engineering was a little hazy - what was this 'specific impulse' stuff anyway? - I knew the basics of how We Were Going To The Moon.    So here it was: July 20, 1969. The Day.    They were up there on the moon, I was in my living room surrounded by press clippings, PR, technical specs, models - you name it; if it was about Apollo 11, I was reviewing it.    And in the plans for getting off the moon, I found it. The  Fatal Flaw.     The Lunar Module only had one engine. One  small  engine to  get my heroes off the moon. If that engine failed, the astronauts  would be Marooned Forever.     Marooned Forever. Pretty scary, for an eight-year-old.    But surely they tested the engine. I mean, I knew about the early unmanned Apollo missions, the expensive full-scale tests of the Saturn V and the spacecraft. Surely they tested  everything .    Marooned Forever. I dug through all my Apollo materials.      Making sure.    I couldn't find  anything  about the ascent engine.  But it worked on Apollo 10.  Their  ascent engine worked.  Surely it'd be okay.     Marooned Forever. It kept echoing through my head, all day and  into the evening.    So there they were, my heroes, on the moon. On the Moon! And all I could worry about was them getting off the moon. It would be years before I learned about hypergolic fuels and high-pressure nitrogen. When I did, I marvelled at the sheer elegant simplicity of the Lunar Module's engines.    Marooned Forever. No TV from the surface yet. There was Walter Cronkite, even then the God of the News. Amazed and reassuring. The mission was going perfectly. The astronauts were too keyed up to sleep, so they'd be walking on the moon sooner than they planned. They'd sleep later, but they were getting ready now.    Marooned Forever.     Marooned Forever. The enormity of it frightened this eight-year-old.    Marooned Forever. I couldn't bear it any more. I said a prayer for  the astronauts and went to bed. I was too afraid for them.    So I missed the moon walk.     Me, the biggest, youngest space supporter in Pittsburgh.

						   Via  urlLink  There Is No Cat  , this tale of Presidential contempt:      So I went to protest Dubya today, as he was visiting my humble little burg of East Lampeter, PA.           Adam came over and with my and Matt's help, created two banners. They read:         DOWN WITH BIG BROTHER       and         MORE TREES, LESS BUSH      Well, of course those banners weren't getting near the site of the speech. So:     A friendly Kerry supporter named Mr. Shenk let us use his front yard to display our banners. Now comes the good part. After waiting around for about 45 minutes, the motorcade passed by us again. A few police cars, followed by a van or two, drove by. Then, a Bush/Cheney bus passed, followed by a second one going slower. At the front of this second bus was The W himself, waving cheerily at his supporters on the other side of the highway. Adam, Brendan, and I rose our banner (the More Trees, Less Bush one) and he turned to wave to our side of the road. His smile faded, and he raised his left arm in our direction. And then, George W. Bush, the 43rd president of the United States of America, extended his middle finger.      Read that last sentence again.     I got flipped off by George W. Bush.       A ponytailed man standing next to us confirmed the event, saying, "I do believe the President of the U.S. just gave you boys the finger."     urlLink  Read it all . Alas, the picture posted there isn't incriminating - I spent an hour or so attempting digital picture wizardry in order to look in the windows of the bus, but the only person we can see on the bus in that picture is the driver.    I am very forgiving of such hysterics on the House and Senate floor, or even in private in the White House because let's face it, government is a high-stress office job and sometimes you gotta vent.    However: An elected official "giving the finger" directly to registered voters has completely forgotten who's in charge here.    I am  outraged . I fear for my country. The thought of what that jackass can do in the period between losing the election and the inauguration of his successors terrifies me.    The terrorists have won, haven't they?

						   And torches. And  petitions.     I went to see that new Will Smith thriller over the weekend.    I expected a Will Smith thriller with robots and a couple of characters with the same names as Asimov characters, and that's what I got. The first half of the movie seemed to have some promise. The second half of the movie had a couple of good moments. Shame about the plot, though.     urlLink NPR's  Weekend Edition Sunday   had a segment about this thriller, in which Harlan Ellison mentions his own modest contribution to the effort: possibly the best screenplay adaptation of Asimov ever. Which was not used at all - except that the opening of the movie looks exactly like the beginning of Ellison's screenplay for a few seconds.    Harlan Ellison's adaptation was written in the seventies, rewritten, rejected, resurrected for a project which never got past pre-production.    Eventually  Isaac Asimov's SF Magazine  (edited by Gardner Dozois at the time) published it as a serial. This was popular enough that the screenplay was published in a  urlLink beautifully illustrated book .    And the fans had hope.    Will Smith is a bit of a SF fan, and he is one of the executive producers of  urlLink the current movie . I'm sure they read the Ellison screenplay - okay, I  hope  they read it - and decided that Ellison's lead character, reporter Robert Bratenahl, just wasn't going to be a good Will Smith character. So they commissioned their own script, and off they went.    I'll be the first to tell you that Asimov stories are hard to translate to movies. But the deed can be done. Want proof? Go rent  Bicentennial Man , which is a thoughtful combination of two Asimov stories:  Bicentennial Man  and  The Positronic Man .    And I still want to see Ellison's screenplay done sometime. It needs to be done.     Note: I always abbreviate Science Fiction as SF. I may be in trouble if I ever do a post on Science Fiction in San Francisco, but I'll burn that bridge when I get there.

						   Thirty-five years ago today,  urlLink Apollo 11  lifted off from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida.    Within six hours, it was on its way to the first manned landing on the moon.    People have decried "throwing all of that money away on space", and it just doesn't wash with me. Every cent we spent going to the moon stayed on Earth. Most of it stayed in the USA.    The real waste is this: If we were to need to build a Saturn V rocket  right now  (incoming asteroid!), we can't just pull the plans out and build it. Many of the plans don't exist any more.  There are still Saturn V rockets in existence, but they are all museum pieces. None of them are flight-worthy, or even complete.  Only one is being restored, and that restoration is to museum quality, which is not the same as flight-ready. So not only would we have to rebuild the tooling and the launch pads - which is reasonable - we'd have to re-invent much of the rocket from basic principles and the knowledge that we've done it before.    I don't mind doing things for political reasons. Politics is human nature. But I bitterly resent hard-won knowledge being thrown away like that.

By a funny coincidence, the Democratic National Convention is   also   in Boston, and its URL is boston04.com. The inevitable confusion is quite humorous -- the organisers of the WorldCon have compiled a list of ways in which the WorldCon is unlike the DNC:     # We're not $10 million over budget.

						    urlLink This NPR story  is about Moose.  Moose makes graffiti.  Non-permanent graffiti. No paint is used.   Moose, whose real name is Paul Curtis, tells NPR's Steve Inskeep that he got the idea when he saw that people had written their names with their fingers on dirty tunnel walls in his hometown of Leeds. Moose does some freehand drawing, but also uses the grid from wall tiles to create perfect shapes and letters.  The tools are simple: A shoe brush, water and elbow grease, he says.  British authorities aren't sure what to make of the artist who is creating graffiti by cleaning the grime of urban life. The Leeds City Council has been considering what to do with Moose. "I'm waiting for the kind of Monty Python court case where exhibit A is a pot of cleaning fluid and exhibit B is a pair of my old socks," he jokes.   Cleaning up Britain, one tile at a time. Go, Moose!

						   I'm back from over hill and dale and across the Water. Also British Columbia, where I stopped briefly to pick up the first four Harry Potter books in the original Canadian. Also got sneered at by a US Border Patrol agent who thought I was bringing cheap Canadian pharmaceuticals into America. Actually I was taking expensive American pharmaceuticals to Canada (and back). So  there!!!   Anyway:  Silly lawsuits are  such  easy targets that they usually fall well below my radar. But not always. The Register has found a doozy:   As was explained so coherently to the owner of Shiremail.com, Tarrant Costelloe, in a letter from the lawyers representing all three parties, Addleshaw Goddard: "The SHIRE name is well-known in the UK and elsewhere, to readers of the Lord of the Rings books (and others) and the goodwill in the name has been achieved through sales of such books.  "The incorporation of the SHIRE name into a domain name by you is a misrepresentation to the public that the domain is connected to the Lord of the Rings books and/or films. In particular, the registration by you of the domain name constitutes a representation to persons who consult the Whois register that you are connected to or associated with the name registered and thus the owner of licensee of the goodwill in the name, which of course you are not."  All the company wants is for Mr Costelloe to realise his mistake and hand over the domain on which he has run an email business since September 2003.   Umm. Guys. Get a linguist:   Well, it would be impossible to argue with the legal letter's initial assertion: "shire" is extremely well known in the UK. In fact, it has been well known since around 600AD - not long after the Romans had wandered off. "Shire" in fact stems from the Saxon word "schyran", meaning to shear or divide. It has been used to divide up land for over a thousand years and a majority of counties that still exist in the UK today possess the suffix "shire" (see at the bottom). It was also the origin of the word "sheriff", stemming from "shire-reeve".     urlLink Read . Boggle.

						   An article in the Guardian asks:    urlLink Is this the end for the kings and queens of haute couture?     I, for one, certainly hope so.    When Yves Saint Laurent retired his business partner, Pierre Berge, predicted that haute couture, the most expensive and exclusive tier of fashion, where dresses are handmade and cost upwards of £10,000, would die without him. His words, dismissed at the time as sour grapes, now seem prophetic.  In this democratic era, haute couture is nothing more than an archaic throwback to the excesses of Napoleonic times.  The author proves my point for me:   Old-fashioned is perhaps the politest way to describe haute couture. Many prefer archaic.  Announcing his decision to quit, the designer Emanuel Ungaro, a great couturier who trained under Cristobal Balenciaga, declared that haute couture "no longer answers, as before, to the tastes of contemporary women".  Price tags are at least 10 times that of Bond Street designer labels; each piece requires a number of fittings and takes several months to make. No change to traditional dressmaking methods is countenanced - zips, for example, are banned. There are, at a generous estimate, only 300 women in the world who buy couture clothes, and few of those are young.   But wait! There may be a ray of hope for these elitist snobs:   Donald Potard, president of Jean-Paul Gaultier, has tentatively suggested a way to modernise and so rescue haute couture. Mr Potard has floated the idea of a halfway house between couture and ready-to-wear - outfits would be displayed in stores (which haute couture is not) but then be made to order, albeit with one fitting rather than three or four.  A similar "hybrid" idea is being considered at the house of Emanuel Ungaro.  This is not a solution that will please the purists but it may be the only way to keep couture alive.   Put a stake through it, Yves.   And you, Jess Cartner-Morley, fashion editor of the Guardian: Learn something useful. You're going to need a real skill.  Maybe golf will be next.

						   Sometime in prehistory, or at least during my tenure at my former employer, I posted  urlLink this story  on  urlLink Alien Wine Connoisseur , which I still own but haven't updated in ages out of sheer sloth - I need to rewrite the front-end or link it to Blogger or something.  Anyway, if you follow the link in that article, you come to a very funny Accordion Guy piece.  I'll wait  urlLink here  while you read it.  So things are still a little slow here at (Large Company Willing to Employ Me) and I hadn't read that message in a while, and I was reading   urlLink The Adventures of Accordion Guy in the 21st Century   anyway, so I searched for the time-traveller article again. Writing that good should be savored.  This is old news to some, but  urlLink  Wired  found the spammer last fall.  He sent  me  some spam earlier this year - it's long since deleted by now - and I thought he was just a copy-cat.  I'm spending the weekend at this year's  urlLink Western Regional Science Fiction Convention , and it just seemed appropriate somehow. See y'all Tuesday.

						   For someone in Arizona, I write about Canada a lot, huh?

As I discovered last year.  This year, I'll be in Vancouver the 11th, which is an actual Sunday. But I won't have a morning bus to catch this time. Maybe a morning ferry, but it's not a top priority. I had this insane idea that catching a ferry to Nanaimo, driving to Victoria, shopping, catching a second ferry back to Tsawassen and driving to Seattle all in the same day would be fun. I am reconsidering.  All I'll really need is a good book store.  H'mm... There's a Chapters not far from where I plan to stay the previous night. That should do.

						   Jerry Pournelle on  urlLink office cleaning :  My routine involves getting a lot of boxes, and piling everything, including contents of book shelves, into those boxes. Eventually I have made some clean flat surfaces. I keep that up until it's all clean. Then I dust and use lemon oil. Then I begin unpacking the boxes: Deal with it if it needs action, or throw it away; or put it where it belongs. There is a"residual" box for stuff I don't know what to do with. When I am through most of the boxes I take the residual boxes and go through those. Eventually there will be one or more boxes of residuals that I really don't have much use for. I should throw them out, but what usually happens is they go back to a back room to age, and one day I come across that box and wonder why I kept any of that junk, and then it can go. I must try that. Soon.  Before the junk eats me alive.

						   Or: Homeland Insecurity  It's ironic that there were three bank robberies in Davenport, Iowa yesterday while Kerry and the Shrub were there campaigning. We'll begin our coverage with  urlLink this headline from WQAD TV , which has a map for those of you playing the home game.  Naturally, there was extra media coverage of those robberies.  Though security was heavy for the two campaign events, [Davenport Police Lt.] Gano said police met their normal patrol demands by working officers overtime.  "We did not shortchange the city with patrols," he said. -  urlLink CNN  No, just with overworked police.  WHBF TV asks the obvious question:  The question on everyone's mind: Did the robbers hit on Wednesday morning because they thought the police would be distracted by the political events in Davenport?  "That would be speculation on our part," said Sgt. McKee. "It is certainly ironic but I wouldn't want to speculate." However opportunistic these robberies were, there's more:  Police don't know if these three bank robberies were connected with one another or if any of them are tied to the recent string of holdups but they say it's quite a coincidence that each of the robberies happened at approximately the same time. -  urlLink WHBF Channel 4 news  And that's fine. The police really aren't supposed to speculate in public. That's my job. A string of robberies, several timed to the campaign stops. I'd say, except for the one that got caught yesterday, there are some fairly clever monkeys robbing banks in Davenport.  I won't deny the fact that Presidents and candidates need protection. But it goes too far, too often. Case in point: me. I work near Sky Harbor Airport in Phoenix, and whenever Bush is around, there's a good chance I'll be one of many people stuck in a traffic jam. Bill Clinton immobilized half of the metro area on the spur of the moment once - he was here for something-or-other at Luke Air Force Base out on the West side of Phoenix. Luke can handle big planes, so Air Force One landed there. Barry Goldwater was in the hospital in central Phoenix. Clinton decided to drop in. Pandemonium as I-10 was closed with no warning at rush hour.  I think the next time I have to make a tough decision in a Presidential election (maybe next time), one of my factors, all else being equal, will be this: I'll vote for the candidate who will vacation farthest away from me.  Of course, if I have to choose a candidate on that basis, either a miracle or a disaster will have occurred.  A miracle: Either person can do the job, their differences are minor, and their advisors don't scare me. This is how I voted in 2000: Scariest advisors (Bush's keepers) lost my vote.  A disaster: Both teams scare and depress me. An igloo in the Yukon looks like a good place to live for a few years.  Anyway: Here's to the overworked police in Davenport. May you catch your bank robbers soon, and may you not be beset by politicians for years to come.

I repost it here in an effort to share the load.  Note that I cannot forward comments and will close comments if necessary.  See the comments at the end of the post.   After a dear friend of mine was raped a few weeks ago, I've been thinking a lot about sexual violence and how you're not supposed to talk about it.  This friend of mine who was raped recently isn't the only person I know who has endured being raped and lived through the aftermath, just the most recent. She isn't the only person I know who has had to try to figure out how to glue the broken bowl of her life back together after having it shattered by sexual violence, praying that it'll still hold water when she's done.  As I have altogether too many times in the past when other friends have become victims of rape or other sex crimes, I have wondered what I can possibly do to make it better. But I also know I can't take it back or prevent it or even really make it easier. The best thing I can do is come out and let her know that she's not alone, that there are others of us out here, that she can make it through, because I'm a rape survivor, and we do make it through.  I was thinking in the shower this morning about how many people I know -- women, men, transfolks, others -- have some sort of sexual violence somewhere in their pasts, wondering how many more people I know have some sort of sexual violence lurking in their future.  I wondered for a moment what it would look like if just for one day, everyone who had survived sexual violence were visible as a survivor, if we could actually see the extent of it, if we could all know just how very not-alone we are. I wondered how angry and sad it would make me to know. I wondered how much power there might be in the truth.  I'm not sure what to do with this, yet. But I do feel like outing myself, and encouraging other people to out themselves if they feel okay about doing so. This isn't about telling the story of what happened -- just for the record, I don't generally like to talk about it much and I get uncomfortable with other people's voyeuristic curiosity about what happened to me, although other people feel differently about telling their stories or being asked questions, and I think people should be free to place their own limits on how and with whom they want to talk about details.  This is about being public in regard to something that is normally kept a very big, very dark secret, thus ensuring that we can all pretend that This Sort Of Thing Doesn't Happen To People Like You And Me.  It does happen to people like you and me.  Trust me, I know.   I'm Hanne.  I'm a survivor of sexual violence. No Pity.  No Shame.  No Silence.

No further comments on this post will be displayed. It has received close to one thousand comments in a little over 24 hours thus far, and has just been linked to on MetaFilter, which will be bringing a huge amount of new traffic this way.

Because this is an important issue, and because this is my journal, I feel that if I cannot responsibly handle the avalanche -- and I can't, not at this rate -- I need to do the responsible thing and put a cap on things.  I apologize to anyone who wanted to add a comment here in solidarity and in witness to their own strength and survival. I encourage you to create spaces in your own journals to continue that process.

I am humbled to have unwittingly generated such an intense groundswell of activity, and I support you all from the bottom of my heart as you grapple with these issues. That I cannot continue to be the host for such a large share of the discussion saddens me, but the simple truth is that I can't. The more we share, the stronger we grow.

						    I put the word Arizona into  urlLink this surrealistic product generator  and got this: Arizona is a greetings card! It shouts 'WARNING!' at the first sign of danger! Well, no it doesn't - but it  should . Broiling desert, not enough water, snakes, right-wing Republicans.  Here's a couple more:      urlLink Slashdot  is an electronic implant that has a leopardskin print! Well, yeah, of course.      LiveJournal is a hearing aid that's made of glass!     Politics should not be forgotten in this election season. Here's a little something for both sides in the American elections:     George Bush is a shirt button that hovers three feet from the ground, keeps your breath fresh for up to twenty-four hours and cuts through stone as if it were butter.      John Kerry is a candle! It detects background radiation! And this weblog:      Villagers With Pitchforks is a belt buckle that improves blood clotting and bleeps when you whistle for it.  Just what I've always needed.

						   I'm more of a word person than a photo person.  Photoblogs leave me cold. Instead of studying the photo for its artistic merit, I glance at photos and move on. It's just how I'm wired.  Here's a photoblog which is all about the words:  urlLink Signs of Life     - via   Byzantium's Shores
