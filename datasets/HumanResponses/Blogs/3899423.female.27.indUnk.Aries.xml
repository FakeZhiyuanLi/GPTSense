      I went to the Hospital at 8:30am and they took Aidan in. I waited outside theatre for an hour which they said would only take 45 minutes so I was shitting my pants something had gone wrong. They came and got me and took me to the Recovering Room. I walked in and it was full of Old People who looked like they were on thier death beds. Three Nurses was hanging around the beds trying to get the Saturation Monitor on and I ended up showing them how to put it on him. Then he started going Blue and I told them and they turned his Oxygen up full blast so I started shouting at them and swearing to turn it down. It was a nightmare really. They should know better and their reaction to me was you should know your his mum and I said you should know cos your a nurse.  He is fine now. They did both of his eyes and I find out tomorrow what's going to happen now.

      Yesterday, I went to the Hospital 8:30 am and in the lift the Eye Doctors walks in, he didn't see me and started talking about how aniethetists stop urgent situations with another Doctor. &nbsp;He turned around and looked at me and said "Ooo I never saw you there". So I said I thought I better come in early so I can be here for Aidan before he has his surgery and with that he said, "Didn't they tell you last night?" "Tell me what?" I replied He told me because Aidan was poorly last week the aneithetist refused to put him asleep. The Eye Doctor wasn't happy about it at all. We went in Aidans room and the Aneithetist said that he would like to wait a few more days before he'd be happy to do it. The Eye Doctor said to him, "We need to do this as soon as possible". The Aneithetist replied "How serious is it? Will he be blinded?". BLINDED??  urlLink I'M  TRUSTING THIS MAN WITH MY CHILDS LIFE AND HE CANNOT EVEN TALK PROPERLY. The Doctor said "I cannot say for certain but he will have servere Visual impairment". What the fuck??? The Eye Doctor said he wanted Aidan to have a thougher check to make sure that he was ready to have surgery in the next week or so. ???.. So another Doctor came and checked his chest which was fine, then he told me he wanted Aidan to have an Echo Scan as he has a soft heart murmer. Depending on this scan was weather he went blind or not. It turns out he has a small PDA, whatever that is I'll look it up later. The Eye Doctor looked at Aidan and said his Cells have started bleeding which means the scarring can make him Blind.&nbsp; I took Aidan home and we have to see the Dotor again on Sunday to make sure it's no worse, Quite frankly I just wish they'd get on with it. The Eye Doctor does not want to leave it any longer and if he's nervous that makes me nervous.  &nbsp; Whatever will be will be but last night I felt like getting pissed as a fart. I never did though. LOL &nbsp;

      Aidan's now gone to the Hospital preparing him for tomorrows surgery. He has to have nil by mouth so they thought it was best to take him in a day early because he wont be happy not being fed. I'm having serious doubts, I'm sure they know what they are doing but they will be putting him to sleep. He still isn't well, he's still wheezing and coughing. The Laser Surgeon said that if the aniethatist isn't happy they wont be doing it. I hope they make the right decision. I couldn't bare anything else happening to him.  Jessica was moaning last night because I wouldn't let her hold him. I felt guilty and tried to explain to her as she has got the sniffles that we can't risk him catching another cold because it makes him very poorly and we want him home not at the hospital. I feel so sorry for the kid's, they have been through the mill with it. Sophie has decided to start pooing herself for attention. She say's she daren't go upstairs on her own and it's always when I'm feeding or changing so I have to stop what I'm doing to take her to toilet. It's hard to give them all the same attention when your doing something with the kids and the babies alarms go off and you have to run to them to make sure they are not stopping breathing. It madness I tell you. Still hopefully it isn't going to last forever and some how or another we will make it up the kid's. The Summer holidays are coming up so no doubt we can take them somewhere.

      I went to see the Dr who is giving Aidan his Laser Surgery on Friday. I found out that he has Retinopathy Of Prematurity. The Cells in his retina are growing the wrong way in BOTH Eyes. They are going to try and Laser all the Cells so they hopefully regrow the right way. He couldn't guarantee me that it would work but he said what he has is very rare and if it is not sorted the retina could detach and he would be blind.  I told him about Paddy, my Paddy was born premature and has only 20% vision in one eye. You can't tell to look at him, he has gorgeous eyes. He said just out of curiosity he would like to look at Paddy. So Paddy is shitting himself. I think it's time to taking up the art of Praying again.  You ever get the feeling you are being punished?

      I owe an Apology to every Blind person on this Planet. It was a big shock to find out Aidan has to have surgery on his eye as he has been through so much already. I find out the In's and Out's Tomorrow but as far as I know his retina has stop growing so they are giving him Laser treatment to try to encourage it. He is always going to be my Baby and I love him no matter what but I was concerned about when he starts School and how cruel kid's can be. I know Ciaran will look out for him so I'm not worried any more and what will be will be.  You just have to look at how many famous people have/had Eye problems there's Cupid/Eros - Greek/Roman god of love,  Stevie Wonder, Homer - Greek poet,  Ray Charles, David Blunkett, Baku - Famous Booze FM DJ. Looking at it that way, it isn't really a Problem and I will be proud no matter what. That's unless he becomes a druggy and picks up prostitutes.

      Aidan is allowed to come home today, I'm not sure I'm entirely happy about it. The reason is that I would have thought they would send him home when his Oxygen requirements were the same as before he got poorly but he is on a lot higher Oxygen. I hope they are right to send him home but for some reason I feel like he's not fully recovered and it could lead to more problems. He's not as alert as he was either. Well, if they are wrong I'm going to sue them as they have already made a mistake the day before he got poorly, I took him in to hospital and told them I felt like he was getting poorly because he was wheezing and I found out Ciaran is Anemic. Aidan is a lot paler and I asked them if they could do a blood count on him and the Doctor looked at me like I was an Idiot. The next day when Aidan stopped Breathing the Doctor couldn't even look at me in the face and Guess what? He is far more Anemic than Ciaran. Mothers Instinct, you can't beat it.

      My Bezzy Mate Scotty and I were discussing, if you put Immac on your fanny or balls would it hurt?  I am very tempted to try it but Scotty seems to think it might give me boils. I haven't had a boil before so I don't know if they hurt. Would it make Scotty's balls blister or burn if he did it??  But the question is would it make our bits nice and smooth and pube free??  I have now discovered thanks to Flopsy it is not a good idea and it does burn. Just in the nick of time too, I was just about to try it.

      Why is it as soon as you get pissed you want to get laid? I can't look at Paddy without getting Pregnant so I've told him there's no OOO AHHH Thank You Ma till he gets the snip snip snip. It's doing my head in though, I must be walking frustation because even a lamp post looks attractive right now. I don't know if that's normal.

      This week must be one of the worst weeks of my life. I have Twin Boys that were born 12 weeks early and they have Chronic Lung Disease. Now I have them home I was warned that if they picked up a Cold or Virus it could send them back into Hospital. Well, on Sunday Ciaran was dropping his Oxygen and every little movement his Heart Rate was souring so I took him into Hospital and they kept him in and put him on antibiotic. I wasn't happy leaving him there as I have other Children to look after and Paddy has come off work so I could go and visit him. Paddy's work is not Happy with all the time he's had off. I don't think he'll have a job much longer but there is noone else we can rely on looking after the Kid's. Anyway Wednesday I went to see Ciaran and the Doctors where happy with him and said he could come home the following day. But when I came Home Paddy told me Aidan had a big drop in his Oxygen while he was feeding him. Then all of a sudden Aidan stopped breathing and turned Blue. I go into over drive pick him up do all the things I was told to do in the resuscitation training I did and luckily got him stable ready for the ambulance. This is where I feel bad, I couldn't take him I had to send Paddy with him, I was shaking that much, at the time I was fine then I just crumbled and felt sick. Aidan was rushed to the children's High dependency Unit and placed in a Oxygen Tank. He is now getting better but today I get another Blow, he has had check ups every two weeks for his eyes and one of his eyes has deteriated and he now has to have laser surgery. Its hard to face and say "My son is blind in one eye". There I have said it. They have been through enough shit and I feel responsible for all the pain they are going through. I hope and pray that they grow out of the Oxygen dependency soon cos I don't feel I can cope with anymore crap.
