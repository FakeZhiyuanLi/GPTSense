      Quite a lot has happened since I first  urlLink wrote  about the Norwegian WCG qualifier. I wasn't planning on writing more about this, but since it has been requested I decided to do it anyway.
  
When Morpheus first  urlLink announced (in Norwegian)  that Mordi would be getting a "wildcard", the community immediately reacted by condemning the decision. 2 days later, Morpheus made a peculiar  urlLink statement (Norwegian)  where he basically said that the decision was made against his will and that the final word had not been said. 5 days later  urlLink the final decision  came, this time from the central administration of WCG, and they did what was expected and disqualified Mordi from any further participation in the qualifier.
  
So now that we got what we wanted we should be happy, right? If there were any sign that Morpheus or ESN learned a lesson from this I would, but they haven't made any effort at all to explain their initial decision, and as far as I know they still don't agree with WCG. Morpheus did actually make an apology after the final decision came from WCG, but it's not exactly what you'd expect after a screwup of this magnitude:
  "We formally apology to the team mordi for not informing them about the rules regarding stand-in players for games in case of extraordinary circumstances."  
Which I guess means that Morpheus and ESN actually think that Mordi did nothing wrong, because they were never given a personal presentation of the rules? If we disregard for a second the fact that any team should be expected to familiarize themselves with the rules of tournaments they participate in, I could be inclined to agree with this, but only if we were talking about something that could easily be misunderstood, such as an obscure map bug for example. Mordi used a player that wasn't on their roster, and in addition they had him pose as one of their legitimate players. Do they seriously want us to believe that anyone would need to read rules to know that this is not ok?
  
I guess what Morpheus is trying to say is that Mordi couldn't know that they might have been allowed to used a new player in case of unforseeable circumstances, and this goes to the very heart of the problem. Any team that I would even consider calling professional would've dealt with this problem by trying to find a solution in cooperation with the organizers. Mordi on the other hand, decided to deal with it by cheating and deceiving the organizers. This kind of immature behavior is all too common in esports, and it is one of the major factors that makes it impossible to take the concept of professional gaming seriously. Until this kind of behavior is considered unacceptable at all levels of competitive gaming, professional gaming will remain a dream.
  
This poses an interesting question: Can anything be done to accelerate the promotion of professionalism in the esports community? In my opinion the answer is yes, and I'll get back to how in a separate article later on.

      This year Norway has a  urlLink WCG qualifier  for the first time, which is great. It's being organized by Morpheus, which is also the person responsible for the  urlLink Norwegian ESports League . In fact, all the Scandinavian WCG qualifiers seem to be organized by the  urlLink ESports Network (ESN) , which also organizes a league similar to NESL for all the other Scandinavian countries as well. It's not completely clear to me exactly what the relationship between Morpheus, NESL, WCG, ESN, the other WCG qualifiers and the other leagues are, but it's quite clear that ESN is at the center of it all.
  
If you don't know who ESN are, just think  urlLink SoGamed . When bds stepped down from GeekBoys, ESN was the company that took over the site and changed it's name to SoGamed. Needless to say, this company has done some good things for ESports both in Scandinavia and the rest of the world,  but it's still a commercial company. By looking at what they've done with SoGamed for example, it's pretty obvious that their primary goal is to make money. There's nothing wrong with a company trying to make money of course, but when making a profit becomes more important than treating the teams in your own tournaments equally, it does become a problem. (It's also a problem when a highly biased company like this tries to pose as a credible news outlet, but that's not relevant to this post.)
  
The online portion of the Norwegian WCG qualifier was held last weekend, and one of the attending teams was Mordi, a mix team consisting of several of the former members of the now legendary clan eoLithic (element, dark, naikon, knoxville, xeqtr and juvenile to be exact). Mordi lived up to their status as favorites and won all their matches, but later on it was discovered that xeqtr had been unable to make it to their first match, and Mordi had decided to use a freelancer posing as him in stead. The organizers (Morpheus and a Swedish ESN representative) decided to change the result of this match into a forfeit loss for Mordi, which meant that another team would be going to the LAN portion of the qualifier in stead of them. This decision spawned a lot of reactions in the community, but the only people who seemed to disagree with it was the members of Mordi and a handful of diehard fans.
  
Let's be clear about this: When Mordi realized that they didn't have a full lineup for their first match, they made a conscious decision to field a player that wasn't on their roster. In addition they tried to hide this from the organizers and the spectators by having him pose as one of their legitimate players. This can only be described as cheating. To my knowledge they never even tried to discuss their problem with the organizers, even though it was completely out of their control (xeqtr was stuck in traffic because there had been an accident). There's absolutely no doubt that Mordi should be punished for cheating like this, and my only problem with the decision made by the organizers is that it was too lenient. Mordi should've been disqualified altogether, not just given a forfeit loss.
  
The next day however, the organizers (ESN)  urlLink decided  to give Mordi what they called a "wildcard", which in practice meant that Mordi would be invited to the LAN portion of the qualifiers in addition to the 4 teams who actually deserved it, and now we're finally getting to the point I'm trying to make here! There are only 2 possible reasons why the ESN would make a decision like this. Either they are just plain stupid, or more likely, they realize that they'll get much more attention if the team that qualifies for the main WCG event gets a high placement at the tournament. Even though there are other clans with some skills as well, Mordi has a huge advantage because their members have extensive experience from this kind of event. So why does ESN even bother with a qualifier if they've already made up their mind about who should get qualified? Well they did charge 100 NOK for each player that wanted to participate, so maybe they just needed the money?
  
In conclusion I just want to thank ESN and Mordi for striking another blow against professionalism in ESports. Imagine how impossible things would be if everyone was required to abide by the same rules, sheesh!

      Hello world! I'm Nico, an avid computer games enthousiast from Norway. I started playing Counter-Strike in 2000, and I played actively until late 2001. In 2002 I joined the  urlLink ClanBase crew , and I quickly learned that organizing things is something that I enjoy, and I think I'm getting pretty good at it too. These days my main gaming activities involve being the manager of the Norwegian CS clan  urlLink 9N , the general manager of  urlLink Team-Norway  (all the Norwegian national teams) and a developer for  urlLink ClanBase .
  
In this blog I plan on writing down some of my thoughts on gaming, esports, clans, tournaments, players, and basically anything else that I feel like ranting about. My primary goal is to get my thoughts jotted down for my own benefit, but if I'm lucky I'll be able to tickle the interest of others aswell. I have no idea if this will work out or not, and for all I know this might be the last post I make on this blog, but it's worth a shot.
  
In any case, welcome to my world. Enjoy your stay and keep your hands inside the car at all times.
