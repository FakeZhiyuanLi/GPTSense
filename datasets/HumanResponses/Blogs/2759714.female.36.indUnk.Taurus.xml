       urlLink Sports fans , a repeat from Wednesday:   I've had  urlLink The Punk Group's  song  urlLink "Tight End Wide Receiver"  in my head for weeks now!    urlLink Touchdown There for Peace    Boycott CBS for not running the  urlLink MoveOn ad . CBS execs must be a bunch o' fear-based bloated white guys with diaper fetishes.   urlLink Advertisement is not entertainment.  Do you really need to buy more shit?  I'm leaving for a relaxing weekend.  Looking forward to a Finnish film,  urlLink Screaming Men ... imagine fifty men of different sizes and lung capacity,  urlLink screaming words  in carefully planned rhythmical patterns.

      Normal people are just people you don't know very well. Or else they're high on behavioral meds.    urlLink "Children can be taught to perform household chores as soon as they are able to walk unaided.

My  urlLink lover  returns soon.   Rumination of the Day  For six months I've been on this Atkins meat-based diet, and although I'm losing weight, it's beginning to get difficult to stick to the diet. Before too long, I'll have to move on to another town to find more Atkinses. (Brad Simanek)   urlLink "Crop Circles Appearing on People's Heads"

      Super Bowl, Schmooper Bowl.  In my opinion being a rabid  urlLink sports fan  is kin to being a rabid Star Trek fan.  Stats, figures, layout of Enterprise's bridge, and which alien Captain "space slut" Kirk boffed on what episode... all so unreal and surreal at the same time.  I've had  urlLink The Punk Group's  song  urlLink "Tight End Wide Receiver"  in my head for weeks now!   urlLink Touchdown There for Peace   I'm also boycotting CBS for not running the  urlLink MoveOn ad .  CBS execs must be a bunch o' fear-based bloated white guys with diaper fetishes.  See  urlLink MoveOn's new ad  on the misleading of America.

      I awoke at 6:30 am to my building's piercing fire alarm.  No fire.  Just a lot of standing around in the cold with the wifebeater from downstairs and other people in their pajamas.  Apparently, the partying landscapers from downstairs pulled the emergency alarm.   urlLink Losers.    urlLink Don't be an asshole!   (funny ad!)  Bush's State of Illusion address was total crap: "Jobs are up..."  C'mon - 1000 'new' jobs does not satisfy the hundreds of thousands  urlLink out of work . Being rejected for jobs one is overqualified for is not only a blow to the wallet, but a blow to the soul.  Knight Rider.  Germans love him.  I'm  urlLink embarrassed  for him.  Get your  urlLink Law & Order Coloring Book .  Dang, my guy is back in the States, but still a state away.  Will devour him upon arrival.  I sympathize with the  urlLink dolpin.

       Salutations   Everybody seems to have a freakin' weblog these days.  Heck, I'm joining the circus.    I belong to an online community of interesting folks, and therefore can not take credit for the wonderful & sometimes icky links found.  People send me this stuff.  I mean, who singularly has the time to find all this cool, fun, scary and/or informative stuff?    Yes, I will admit most links will be of political nature - with my usual luscious liberal bias.  But, in the current political hellfires we're enduring, I find it necessary to take part and to take action.   I'm a bit nervous about the Dem primary tomorrow.  I also find I can't listen to the (conservative,  urlLink clear-channelized ) media until it's all decided.  Wild that Kerry's topping the polls (hey polls can be manipulated, so what can they really tell us).  For me, Kerry came out of left-field.  My eye was on Dean.  Kucinich was my initial choice early on, but hey, he doesn't really have the who-can-beat-bush factor going for him (and that he was originally a pro-lifer was cause for concern).  Did you see the  urlLink Dean Goes Nuts  site?  Love the  urlLink "YEEEEARGH!"  link.  World's most misleading URL:  urlLink http://cummingfirst.com   Fun site:  urlLink Too Stupid to be President   Anyone else find this disturbing?:  urlLink Full-on big brother scary stuff   Man, I missed seeing  urlLink Ted Leo  last weekend.  Such buzz about him, really pissed I was lazy about keeping up on band listings.  Then again, Portland OR is so hit & miss.  Either monsoon or desert when it comes to good bands hitting Portland.  Will be hitting  urlLink The Shins  show Feb. 2nd.  And, oh yes, already unloaded the wallet for tix to  urlLink Elvis Costello  in March.  Ah, nostalgia - and good new stuff.  Speaking of the Rose City:  urlLink Is Portland on the Path to Prohibition?   If you haven't seen  urlLink The Station Agent , you should.  As a  urlLink Willamette Week  critic put it: "The best movie starring a dwarf that doesn't have witches and hobgoblins."  (or, well, he said something to that effect)  Come on, I know you can't help but read this:  urlLink While the Japanese are focused on personal hygiene, American manufacturers are more interested in a cleaner toilet -- or at least one that does not get clogged.   I want to have  urlLink Mark Morford's  love child.  What a sexy brain!  And, Question:  urlLink Do you dig for the prostate?   Anyhoo, more soon.  Gotta jet.

      On the radar for this weekend:  urlLink  50 Foot Wave   Saturday, Feb 28th at  urlLink Lolas Room  (downstairs from Crystal Ballroom)!    urlLink Jesus  paid for our  urlLink sins . Let's get our money's worth.  Never miss a good chance to  urlLink shut up .  Oops, sorry, gave you a  urlLink root canal .  Congrats, Paige!  She won  urlLink one of these  last night.  Proud owner of a pink one.  Goes with the  urlLink that thing  she got for her birthday...  Good site if you're into  urlLink oil depletion    urlLink Celebrate love .

      I'm not one of those crazy  urlLink cat-lady  types.  But I am having a very hard time watching my little furry monkey suffer.  Kidney failure.  He's so listless these days.  I swear, he was sitting on my lap last night, looking me straight in the eye with those blue/purple siamese eyes, and it was as if he were trying to tell me "It's time, let me go".   The  gay marriage  issue.  It's everywhere.  And it hits home.  So many facets:  Spiritual, legal, political.  So many  rights  denied to same-sex unions because people cannot be  legally  married... ability to see a partner/spouse in intensive care... ability to adopt children... tax issues... being able to sue for wrongful death of your partner/spouse... and another interesting legal loophole brought up in the beginning of  urlLink this column  (and then he goes off about Rosie)  To me it's a no-brainer.  Some of the most solid, and long-lasting  relationships  I have ever seen happen to be same sex relationships.  Coincidence?  Maybe.   Some of the best  parents  I've ever seen happen to be in same-sex relationships.  possibly because of the efforts needed to adopt and the discussions that likely happen surrounding that decision?  (not just popping one out simply because they can)   It's about love, baby; not gender. Love makes a union. Love makes a family.  And that love deserves the same legal rights and recognition.    urlLink "I think there's so much divorce and fractured relationships and defacto relationships, and disinclination to commit at all, I think that's probably more serious than what's happening amongst gay people."    urlLink Take a greater piece of the USA Today pie    urlLink Mould Defends Gay Marriage    urlLink Rosie O'Donnell Marries Her Partner  - Yay!  From Russ...  urlLink Hmmm, I wonder why they hate us???   Also, thanks to Russ... " urlLink This guy is really a piece of work!  What's left out of this article is the information on his company's attempts at a hostile takeover of PeopleSoft -would result in 4500 people laid off! All because of his enormous ego and drive to be "#1"! What a piece of S**T!"

      So weird - I go off yesterday about that damned  urlLink   Christ    film, and Matt calls me this morning to go see it!  Oh dang, I had to work today (heavy on the sarcasm).  It's still  urlLink  ticking away  ........................   urlLink  One of the most disgusting things I ever read  .  But, hey, aren't we humans a bit fascinated by the yukky things?  Explain  urlLink potty humor .  Or, let me ask this, what are you looking for when you drive past a traffic accident?  Blood and Guts!  Oh, you sick person, you!  Why is  urlLink this movie  only playing in other countries right now?  Quite a line up with varied perspectives on the  corporate animal .   urlLink  Don't worry your money is safe  .  I'm sure you've seen it, but had to highlight it.  Birds do it. Bees do it.  urlLink  Penguins do it!     urlLink  Gigantic Cock!    har har har  On that note, here is a  urlLink  nice coffee table book   that will make you  urlLink hungry .  I once had a painting professor start a class asking everyone to plug their right nostril and breathe deeply through the left.  She said this was to stimulate the  urlLink right brain .  Boy, was she dingy.  Don'tcha love when the love-thing just clicks?  Paige spied a guy, contacted said guy, who said something like "oh yeah, I saw you too... and you were with some other girl." I mean very cool she took the initiative, and said initiative was successful!  But, let me be self-centered for a moment:   Me... some other girl!   Although, I haven't felt too bright and shiny lately...  maybe I kinda blend in with comfortable furniture now, kinda like an ottoman that screams "Rest Your Feet on Me!"  I am so useful.  I'm sorry if I offend here: But men can be such boneheads, having  no clue they are being eyed by luscious potentials!   Paige's reply hammers my point home quite nicely: "he was *blinded by my light* simply because I distracted him by kicking the garbage can. sort of like getting the attention of rattlesnakes by shaking a pop can with rocks in it or getting the attention of certain insects with shiny objects."

      Thanks to  urlLink  Boblog   for sending a few folks my way.  What a thoughtful man!  I can't help but be slapped in the face with this  Passion/Christ  media blitzkreig.   urlLink  Mel Gibson is promoting his new church  , an offshoot of some "fundamentalist" kind of Catholicism.   Passion  is just  urlLink one big commercial , baby.  I am not christian, however I admire those who have faith.  In my opinion, oppressive religious fanaticism is pure evil.  Pray to Whomever, love they neighbor, don't hurt people, try to help, but please, keep your god to yourself!   urlLink Do not pass Go; Do not collect $200; nor are you eligible for a sense of individuality.   I once attended a lecture by a woman author, and voodoo priestess.  (Hey, hoodoo is nature based, not about the zombie thing!)  In relaying her history she said she had attended a school in the middle east, where they taught everything from sciences, spirituality, alchemy to astrology.  Graduates of this school went off into the world to perform 'miracles' and help humanity.  She said there were many graduates of this school, and Jesus just happened to be the most famous of them.  Just a tidbit from the annals of my varied history.  Okay, one more rant... The cross represents a device of torture and execution.  People wear this symbol around their necks, hang it on walls, kneel and pray to it.  Don'tcha kinda find that creepy?  I mean, what if Mr. J had been beheaded, would the guilt-ridden then be wearing little guillotines around their necks?  What about an iron maiden?  Maybe some thumb-screw earrings to match?  Hey, I'm not one for self-help gimics... but when I run across a woman who says she doesn't like sex, or see people walking around with a dead look in their eyes - obviously with no idea how to romance each other or romance the world around them - I can't help but rejoice in celebration of life...  Use the power of pleasure to  urlLink have your way with the world .  "What ever happened to Kajagoogoo, Frankie Goes to Hollywood and A Flock of Seagulls? VH1's new "Bands Reunited" tracks them down and finds out --  urlLink and it ain't pretty ."  You gotta check out the Flock of Seagulls before & after!  Okay I am done hearing about  urlLink Janet's boob .  I'm sure the rest of the world is laughing at our prudishness!  Heck, European commercials feature nekkid people as a matter of course.  The human body is beautiful.  Oh, but then again, who wants to see nekkid obese americans... maybe they should remain prude and covered up.  Where's my Kaftan?  I know, that's cruel.  The economy sucks, there is no more middle class, more poverty level people than ever before... Poor folks can only afford cheap foods which happen to be loaded with fats:  urlLink "The New Urban Sprawl: Why Are Oregonians So Damn Fat?"   Do you remember your first love?  Remember the fever-pitch, the night sweats, the staying awake, constantly preoccupied, and daisies popping out of your footprints?   urlLink This gave me a charmed, nostalgic smile.   Check the box 'yes' or 'no' if you will "go" with me.  I know, I know, this came out last June, and I just now stumbled upon it... kinda catchy...  urlLink Me and Giuliani Down By the Schoolyard   What's up with this  urlLink metrosexual  thing?  If interested,  urlLink metrodaddy speaks .  The guys they name & label seem somewhat... uh...  non sexual to me.  ugh.  May add more later.  Happy Hump Day.

      I am tired, and must apologize if my random bits and pieces are a bit dissheveled.  I'm moving a parent to assisted living (I am now Keeper of the Family Stuff), dealing with an aged & ailing (& dying) feline friend, dealing with romantic rejection ("I don't love you, but I'd like to be friends and fuck"), and a freelance job with a two-week deadline, plus the usual working full time and keeping my self standing upright.  Thank Whomever for  urlLink Odwalla  SuperFood juice.  As Bush pushes to change the Constitution to ban same-sex marriage, and Nader enters the presidential race (risking another four years of BushCo),  urlLink  this   is looking more and more appetizing.  this just in...  urlLink  new career opportunities in manufacturing!    this is funny and sad, and ohmygawd why aren't there quality jobs for my friends!, please read. (requires Adobe Reader to open)  kinda dumb and juevenile, but still interestingly warped...  urlLink "I Did It For Science"  - a  urlLink Nerve  reporter experiments with a  urlLink Real Doll .   urlLink Pitch a Tent for God   make your own  urlLink prison hooch   Being a Nordic Goddess, I had to find out my  urlLink Viking Name   as if the cubicle wasn't denigrating enough... the latest in  urlLink tunnel vision technology  for employees  mow down that  urlLink carpet on your back   haven't heard it yet, but getting some buzz about  urlLink The Wrens'  Meadowlands.  oh beautiful nature, nothing can compare to  urlLink it's design   And if I had the energy, I think I'd be really pissed off that  Pixies tix  sold out in 5 minutes.  I was on hold for two of those minutes, and was dee-nied.  So now there's some scalping-bastard on kink.fm ticket exchange asking $100 for 2 tix.  So I'm assuming  scalping-bastards  everywhere spied the Pixies popularity as a profiteering opportunity.

      It's sooo monday.    I beg of you: Start throwing your parents crap out now!  When they aren't looking, pick something up, give it two seconds consideration of 'love it' or 'hate it', then toss it in the can!  Gradually keep up this practice, until your parent is down to the bare essentials they might need in the home.  I'm telling you, going through one parent's  whole-life-worth-of-crap in one week  is killing me.  Although I am getting a great workout hauling all that stuff around.  I am loving the undies, Paige!  They're red bikini panties with a  urlLink  damned dollie   giving the finger, saying "Eat Me!"  Seriously cool.   urlLink Sex Industry Caters to Women .  Finally!  I was so worried:  urlLink Portland Gnome Thief Caught    urlLink  Mr. Nader, Please do not run for the United States presidency.    The stakes are too high to let the vote swing to BushCo again. Without the Bush election fraud, the presidency would have fallen to Gore.  And, I do believe there is a difference between what our nation has become and what could have been had Gore won... I believe we would be better off! Please do not allow the risk of BushCo winning again.  Last election you received 1% of the vote.  You are not going to win.  And no one is discussing anything you may or may not have brought up in that last election.  What's the point of your running? Please use your energies more effectively.  Please don't run for president.  do's & don'ts of  urlLink montreal's hippy kingdom .  duuuuude, shrooms & dancing drum circles & patchouli mixed with body odor.... righteous!  "You've got a President who says global warming is a hoax, and across the Potomac river you've got a  urlLink  Pentagon preparing for climate wars  .

       yeah, happy fucking valentine's day.   I spent most of mine having the relationship discussion, oh yay!  after this week, I really just wanted to get drunk, laugh and fuck my fave guy.  Well, I got to do everything but the laughing part.  strange waking up to next to someone you really care about and enjoy greatly, watching them sleep, wondering "what the heck do I do with you now?"... and wondering if I'd ever return.  it's clear this is only a temporary arrangement.  might be good for now, but I still need to roll the marbles around in my head, figure out how I feel about this.   urlLink this  is my  favorite valentine  this year.  speaking of strong commitments - and a big stretch of the imagination, not to mention stability of contents of stomach -  eeeeooooo -  "The Basic Plan: 2 - 6 women to have 2 - 15 children by [ urlLink this guy ]."  oh I'm going to have nightmares.  some people should  not  reproduce.    another heavy hitter... put my mother into assisted living.  now in the process of moving stuff.   I don't enjoy going through people's things - find out more than I'd ever want to know.  good to know the mother is being taken care of adequately now.   urlLink Incredibly Strange Albums  - also available are  urlLink this  and  urlLink this  and  urlLink this    urlLink Billboard Liberation Front strikes again .

      As we get older we focus more on our own personal lives, and friends travel diverse paths.  I've often wondered: If I were to stop maintaining contact with certain acquaintances, would they take up the slack?  In founding this weblog, to relieve some of apparently burdensome 'forwards', I've found I don't hear from some I had previously maintained contact with through forwards.  I was hoping to create a forum, of sorts, in the future, for my little "online community."  I seem to be losing some acquaintances, yet making new ones!  Out with the old; In with the new?  While I welcome the new, I am remorseful about losing the old.  However, there are those certain few core friends that remain constant.  And no matter what one does, they can't be shaken.  I am grateful for those solid friends.  And you know who you are!  I was talking with Paige last night about consistency in relationships.  Consistency equals stability - an expected, regular communication between people.  (However, there may be consistency in one's being constantly flakey, right?)  In not hearing from people, I can only assume I am forgotten.  While trying to relieve the burden of 'forwards', I have inadvertantly left others feeling 'forgotten' themselves.  I apologize.  Yes: With our busy lives it is difficult to keep in close contact with everyone we know and care about.  But it would be nice to be thought of every so often, yes?  I know I am a confident, independent, busy woman, but that does not mean I wouldn't like a warm fuzzy every now and again!  So, my message today is:  Touch base with someone today  whom you may have not spoken with in a while.  It feels good to know you're thought of, right?  Why not give someone that gift? They can't read you're mind - you need to show/tell them.  And, I will take a dose of my own advice as well!  Oh this is an  independent  investigation! (heavy on the sarcasm)...  urlLink Bush Appoints Iran-Contra Figure To Head Up Iraq "Intelligence" Probe    Michael Jackson  - We'll never know the real story, as it is possible to sleep in a bed with someone without it being sexual.

      I think Wesley Clark may be right when he said there would be a bout of  "buyer's remorse"  about electing John Kerry.  Heck, Kerry is part of the same Skull & Crossbones secret society that Bush Sr. belongs to.  That's a bit too scary, don'tcha think?  In any case, if Kerry fully gets the nomination I will vote for him.  Anything has got to be better than Bush.  There is no perfect candidate (we are all human) - Every presidential election is about voting for the lesser of two evils.  What would the world look like if Gore were president and the election hadn't been 'bought' by Bush?   urlLink An Open Letter from  Michael Moore  to George "I'm a War President!"

      Welcome to Monday morning.  I am soooo not awake. Even the jet-fuel-powered latte isn't quite kicking in.  Petition:  urlLink Censure Bush.   Today's Rant: I was working on baby announcements this weekend. I know it sounds like a stupid project, but I'm really enjoying it. A kind of 'aunt' of mine is having twins: "Two Peas in a Pod"!  I ran around getting supplies at craft (aka, crap) stores... populated by many large polyestered suburbanites buying loads of plastic shit that will likely end up in a land fill very soon.  Crap stores, and Linens N' Things, and Kitchen Krap, and Target and and and... I can't help but envision all the floor-to-ceiling stuff in a land fill.  We keep producing all this plastic crap to load up landfills!  Yuk.  Makes me a bit sick.  Yet, amazingly, I had a nice political conversation with the grey-haired lady at the register... She expressed concern over the next election: "Do you really think Kerry has a chance against Bush?"  I said, "Oh yeah!  Definitely.  I talk to more and more people all the time, people of different backgrounds, people normally pretty conservative, and they are all worried about the future [of our nation].  The Bush administration scares the crap outta them.  Yes: Many people want change.  It's going to happen."

Is it brave or is it immature?  Can a fine balance be achieved?   Remaining unconnected, for some, I'm sure is powered by fear.  Fear of rejection.  Fear of judgment.  Fear of abandonment.  Fear of being unloved, not accepted.   Then there is achieving  connectness , and the resulting responsibility of commitment to another.  It can be dry. It can be heavy.  It can be solemn and burdensome and not so entertaining, at times.  (Many things that can be attributed to being 'mature.')  However, there is great worth in solid connections to others - the love to give, the love to support, and the love to receive.  There is great energy produced in healthy connections that truly operate with cyclical giving and receiving.  And it is brave to brush aside personal fears in order to gain, to earn, to achieve connection with another. I believe it is possible to operate confidently, independently, free-flowingly, and still be connected to those around us.

      I don't think I've ever been so involved in the Democratic Primaries!  And nice to see Shrub's approval rating plummeting.  Unfortunately, I'm waiting to see what BushCo will pull (i.e., possibly what disaster he may let occur) in order to gain public support.  Will we be going to war again soon, before the election?  I'm sure designs are in the making... and many more innocent lives will be extinguished for unnecessary political reasons.  More on that as events unfold.   urlLink Remind Us: Why did the US Government invade and destabilize Iraq?    urlLink Dishonest Dubya Lying Action Figure   Went to see a movie yesterday...  urlLink Monster .  Incredible.  Yes, the killing was horrifying.  However, much of the killing was implied, and the film focused on her story, what brought her to the point of killing.  Very well done.  As all the reviews say, Theron transformed herself.  She deserves the acclaim, and an Oscar.  Being a big  urlLink Tim Burton  fan, I saw  urlLink Big Fish  the day it came out.  It's more dramatic than  Burton's previous work, but still retains some of his freakish style.  This is a sneaky movie.  I thought it was going to suck at first, but before you know it, you're drawn into the story, and by the end you're pulling out the kleenex.  Truly endearing film.  Love that  urlLink Stain Boy !

      Happy Gloomy Monday, friends!  I'm feeling somewhat introspective today.  Enjoying the rest before the storm, as I'm sure February will be a very active, flavorful month.  If you don't already know - Bush lied.  Anal Repub's call-out Clinton as a liar.  That was a family affair, and in my opinion, I was happy someone in government was gettin' some!  I don't care if he lied about having sex.  Bush lied about  urlLink 9/11 .  Bush lied about  urlLink jobs .  Bush lied about WMDs in Iraq, causing us to go to war for false reasons.  And thousands died.  More soldiers die everyday - because Bush lied.

      what to do for  april fool tomorrow ??  I don't celebrate every year, but every so often I get that wild hair to prank.  years ago, I called my mother nervously, told her how I had just gotten back from Vegas (I've never been), how fun it was, blah blah blah, "and.... uh... guess what??  I got married!!"  I layed it on thick for a little while, really got her going.  she bought it.  and she was trying to be supportive!  I don't remember if I did it to my father too...  I may have.  that was the best April Fool I ever pulled off!  this week  urlLink  Rob Brezsny   passed along a bit of inspiration from Henry Miller...

        For my friend, Dave... and any one else that may be at the breaking point...     Sincerely, I am horrified at what is happening to you, and many of my other friends.  Much of it stemming from the very stressed foundations of basic survival - money and work - the economy.  How much can BushCo shake the tree before it falls over on them?  Either, one is doing really really well in this country, or else, one is struggling to make it, some more so than others, but all still falling behind.  You are not alone.     Yes, I have a job, but I am still falling behind too.  I moved into a suburban roach motel to try to help make ends meet - and I fucking hate it - and I am still not okay.   Maybe there was something in the stars, but I had a crappy day too.  Although I am still fighting to make the best of it.  We'll see how the drive home is.  I am expecting the car to break down.  No cash = car break down.   I do believe the universe, in it's confusing wisdom, does not throw anything at you that you can't handle - it's a test of how you choose to handle it - and therein lies the intimate personal challenge.  Accept that shit is going to happen - Change is going to happen.  You can't fight the only constant in the universe, that constant being *change* - for better and for worse - they do alternate. Truly accept that 'shit & change' are going to happen right now.  The universe throwing this much shit at you - means you must be one tough cookie.      You CAN handle this.  It WILL get better.  And you WILL be okay.    Trust me - I know - I just finished a decade-long cycle of constant shit blasts.  My house is feeling pretty empty these days... 20 years of pets and now nothing waiting for me at home... you guys can move into my roach motel with me!  : )     Sending Mucho Love Kisses Hugs,   L

      An intense Saturday, and uneventful Sunday.  I put Bijou, my 12 yr old Siamese, down Saturday morning.  ( urlLink this  looks like bijou)  It was time.  Although I feel a great emptiness in my home now.  I call out to him: No answer.  I still have yet to dispose of remaining cat articles.   urlLink  Ghosts of Cat Boxes Past    I needed to distract myself after the harsh reality of the cat ordeal.  Russ muscled out the  urlLink Radio Flyer 's (my car's) bad headlight.  Then we were off to the local chapter of a  urlLink  global anti-war rally  .  As my aunt said, reminiscent of Vietnam:  urlLink  Bring Them Home Alive  .  About 12 to 15 thousand people marched here through downtown Portland.  People of all ages & designations in society.  But I'm sure the media will only show the freakish-career-protestors - like the  urlLink hippy dippy  dancing drum circle out front of nordstroms.  After march & speeches & bored after two seconds of drum circle, we were off to  urlLink Virginia Cafe  for much needed cocktails.  Sunday: Watched  urlLink  awful, bad evil tv  , and  urlLink cleaned my bathtub , and... I don't know... nothing really.  What I call a good day: No schedule.   urlLink The First Presleyterian Church of Elvis the Divine : "Remember He Has a Hunka Burnin' Love for Whosoever Believeth in Him!"  Can I have my bottle of  urlLink Love Me Tender Shampoo  blessed?    urlLink exorcist bunnies in 30 seconds    might go:   urlLink tv on the radio   at  urlLink berbati's  april 26   urlLink  dave grohl speaks   in ny times - love that man   urlLink check gas prices online ?  doesn't everyone enjoy  urlLink  morning wood  ?

      Heya Kids!  It's Friday!  Will   urlLink blog for your sins   again on Monday.  Out late again last night seeing  "Fuck the Republican Party"  night at the  urlLink Paranoia Film Fest  at Clinton Street Theater... "The final film in the program is Attack On America (1980).  It was made to put forth the idea that Jimmy Carter had allowed Fidel Castro to arm all of Central America and that only Ronald Reagan could stop them from invading us.  The first film is from 1940.  The 1974 film The Day Business Died  is a masterpiece of paranoia.  It is about a man who wakes up one morning to find there is no electricity, water, television or radio."   Propaganda truly is an art form in itself.   Heard many a guffaw through out the theater.  It is possible Bijou will have to go down tomorrow.   urlLink No advice out there.   Just that wonderful journey alone on a difficult pass.  so much  urlLink  buzz about courtney hole   out there today.  cannot cite how many times I saw the words  urlLink  trainwreck   and  urlLink  drug-addled  .  Rumor has it, she used to live in Portland and drowned someone's new kitten in a bathtub because the owners kicked her out - likely for being the screwy drug addict she is today.  I laughed at her  urlLink cat-fight with Madonna on MTV .  Did you know  urlLink John Kerry has a blog ?  Mind you, they're asking for campaign contributions.  Like I said before:  I'm not sold on Kerry, but Bush has got to go.   Elections are sometimes about choosing the lesser of two evils.   urlLink No, Mr. Nader , at this point in our history, they are not the same.   urlLink meet my new boyfriend   check this foul baloney: Bill before Congress,  urlLink H.R.3920, Title:  To allow Congress to reverse the judgments of the United States Supreme Court.      urlLink  stallone selling ham in japan   - see your favs slinging hash on japanese commercials   urlLink I miss the Church of Elvis   urlLink I miss the Church of Elvis   urlLink I miss the Church of Elvis   urlLink I never got married there ... boo hiss   urlLink Elbis wuz Jeebus ... gawd, how I coveted Sharon's bottle of  urlLink Love Me Tender Shampoo .

        urlLink Storm & the Balls   were great last night, as usual.  Incredible voice, great lounge-punk-jazz.   urlLink CD available , although nothing like Storm belting it out live!  Someone asked to hear this for their birthday:  urlLink "I Want You to Die" . Definitely got some interested looks from men while there.  But none of them interested enough to talk to me?  Got a few drunk guys who wavered over to try to talk to me, looking at me as if I were a goddess - from behind   urlLink beer goggles  .  Oh, and a drunk woman flirted with me, then hugged and kissed me as she left.  Weird night, but definitely entertaining.  This is an outrage!  urlLink “The legal position that he is taking, that there is some distinction between  discrimination based on sexual orientation and discrimination based on conduct , is absurd” . As Russ says, "Oh gaaak! There's more!"...  urlLink "The county that was the site of the Scopes "Monkey Trial" over the teaching of evolution is asking lawmakers to amend state law so the county can charge homosexuals with  crimes against nature ."   Stupid backward redneckians.  'Crimes against nature"? Then BushCo should be put to death for slaughtering Iraqis, Americans and environmental policy.  Today - Democracy Now! speaks with Craig Unger, author of the new book,  urlLink "> "House  of Bush, House of Saud"    that details the complex negotiations on war, oil, illegal arms deals and murky banking deals conducted between the Bushes and the Saudis - connecting a US presidential dynasty to a foreign power.  Looking forward to  urlLink Michael Moore's  film, reported to be partly about this same issue and out before the elections.  moved vet appointment up so I could go to:  urlLink  The World Still Says No to War!   Saturday, March 20th 2004 01:00 pm, Portland, OR USA  starting feeding bijou cheap food, and he's doing better!  may have a little more time with him!  very exciting, as I really thought I needed to put him down this weekend.

       urlLink Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them ...  urlLink  Rumsfeld - caught on camera    Have I mentioned I hate SUVs?  Oh yeah, yesterday.  I was woken up again at 5fucking30am by that bitch in the SUV, warming it up for 15 minutes outside my bedroom window.  I should knock on her door, cordially introduce myself - around midnight.  I swear religion makes people crazy when  urlLink  taken too far   - "Could ya hammer that nail in there for me? yeah right there... ow"  speaking of bible thumpers,  check out the graphic  in this article:  urlLink Bans on Interracial Unions Offer Perspective on Gay Ones ... redneck bible belt, so backwards... shouldn't they be more worried about breaking down the gene pool with inter-family marriages, you know, where your sister is your mother is your aunt is your cousin?   Like that's something to be proud of???...   urlLink Bush's Campaign Emphasizes Role of Leader in War .  Loving the  urlLink MoveOn  ads on tv, by the way!  dog says,  urlLink  "mmm, treats! meat!"    like I'm going to look to char-hunks for my music needs:  urlLink Starbucks launches in-store CD burning service ... a little digeridoo with my charred dirt water...  maybe a little   urlLink emo'd smiths  ...  some nice stuff happening out there...  urlLink urban wallpaper   dang, I'm going out tonight... there will be no parking... and no beer-swilling... so many cops out tonight... and I have a headlight out... oh poo...  urlLink  Too much green beer could put you behind bars     urlLink Henry Rollins  is in town tonight too.

      I keep getting tons of spam for viagara and larger erections.  Oh, and farm animal porn.  All of which I never knew I needed until they graciously notified me.  Whatever.  I am happy to know that I, as a woman, am wired in a more complex way:  urlLink  'Vive la Différence!'     urlLink  pete the porn puppet   doesn't even have a penis   urlLink Tom Tom Club  is  urlLink  back     urlLink  Big and Bad: How the SUV Ran Over Automotive Safety  . Minivan drivers seem to be the biggest assholes on the road.  They're likely frustrated they don't have that faux-outdoorsy-lookin SUV, they feel trapped in their family life (when they should celebrate it), and there's an old triple Big Mac holding up a corner of the back seat.   Yes, I hate minivans.  And SUVs.   The safest family vehicle would probably be one of those enormous boxy 70s station wagons with the fake wood side-paneling, the kind of vehicle you'd name Bertha, and send off by breaking a bottle over the bow, the kind of vehicle where mom could reach back and whack all three kids at the same time. Geez, I think I'm feeling nostalgic about that time, way back when, when parents actually paid attention to their kids and occasionally, lovingly disciplined them.  ah well.  urlLink  New Ford Exorbitant Comes with Spare Explorer     urlLink  boycott south dakota tourism     urlLink  lethal popcorn   - it's the anytime nasty snack.

I will be putting Bijou down on Saturday.  Off to the doc today for my new-found allergies.  joy.  I have such white-coat phobia, they have to take my blood pressure twice.  ooo, heebie-jeebies!

      uhg, I worked the side job alllll weekend.  and here I am back at work!  yay!  now where'd I put that personal life....?  It's around here somewhere....  I am so there this Saturday:   urlLink  The World Still Says No to War!   Saturday, March 20th 2004 01:00 pm, Portland, OR USA  a bit pissed off about  urlLink this  -  privacy, my ass!   next they'll be tattooing our private things on our foreheads.  what a joke - as russ says,  urlLink  eau de has-been   - pee yoo!   urlLink knockers the clown  will sit on your cake  kinda neat - this guy puts up a web site about random acts of kindness and unintentionally starts a cult -  urlLink  Join Me  . he has a  urlLink book  out too  my little feline beastie, bijou, isn't doing so great. found him curled up in the back of a dark closet, meaning he doesn't feel good.  it may be time.  but philosophy rears it's ugly head.... the question that keeps going thru my head is "What right do I have to say when another being should DIE??"  Argument: you don't want them to suffer.  I know.  But shouldn't I, as a right-acting person, do everything I can to help to the bitter end?  who am I to say "tomorrow you die"....??  will add more later? busy monday at work.

      This week,  urlLink  Rob Brezney   tells me, "...look back and  celebrate the luminous mysteries  that have shaped your life story: the  meandering fascinations  that didn't lead to tidy conclusions, the  wobbly joys  that fed your soul, the adventures whose  success was built on  sweet breakthroughs  rather than triumphs over suffering."  So true.  It's the looking back, accepting & releasing it all, before entering the door of new beginning.

      Holy bible-up-the-butt batman - I hear there are some primates out there that really believe  urlLink  God Hates Shrimp  .   urlLink More  on that.  In addition, a guy was spotted with a God Hates Shrimp sign outside the Multnomah County courthouse where normal people, who happened to be same-sex couples, were lined up to get married.  What a dope.  That sign would look better in front of a Red Lobster.   urlLink  Salon.com has just broken a major story detailing how the Pentagon created a special office to manipulate intelligence data on Iraq and WMDs.     urlLink Does this seem screwy... ?   Spy arrested, briefly worked for Senator Wyden (OR-Dem). But who would risk so much for a mere $10,000?? There's got to be something more going on here.   urlLink  This clown   can facilitate your next company meeting!  Oh  urlLink this  would be good people-watching.  Antennaes and all.  As if all intelligent creatures in the universe are bi-peds and speak English.  Speaking of English... I'm still laughing over Paige's comment yesterday.  In response to my domain name ideas: "sugartoyou sounds almost like a porn site made by someone who doesn't speak very much engrish. as much as I like sugartoyou that is.  it makes me giggle thinking about  *I soh hohrnee,  I gonna licka you pee pee*   I've scrapped the Salutations name (too boring)... and sugartoyou.com could be porny... so I'm going with  Water Lily Blue .  Unique, distinct and visual.  And it's available as a domain name!  I'm on my way.  It'll be a long haul to get started.  But after, I will begin my  evil plan to take over the world .  My coworker has requested my first order of business would be to get rid of the bible-thumping-assinine-baby-popping-stupid-person in our office. Mind you, I respect *personal* beliefs, as long as they don't interfere with others (again, emphasis on *personal*). So, once I have achieved ultimate powers and world domination, my first impulse is to pick off religious zealots one by one with lightening.  But I think it would be more effective to blast them with the full realization of how ridiculous they've been acting... and let them live with the embarrassment.  Maybe pull a 'scarlet letter' maneuver - let them walk around with big Zeros on their foreheads for all to see.  Russ sent  urlLink  10 Worst Album Covers   - very funny!   urlLink Page Two  is good too.  oh dear...  I'm a dweeb ... I'll admit, I took  urlLink this test ... but when it was sent to me I was very very very tired after a 10 hour day and...  no, I'm just a dweeb.  A dweeb who has been validated by an impersonal, on-line marketing scheme... yes, I like non-mainstream, manly guys with some boyish charm, either medium-length curly hair or shaved heads, with sly mysterious smiles.  Although they got one thing wrong - I like back-hair?  eh, not really, but what can cool people do about genetics. If you find a package you like, you need to love the  whole  package.  I'm a hot-head of Finnish descent, and that's kind of an oxymoron.  urlLink This article made me laugh!   Maybe I should get over there and teach 'em a thing or two.

       urlLink  Elvis   was great last night!  He's mellowed (don't we all) but not in spirit.  Jazzy crooning bittersweet heartbreak that strums the heartstrings reverberating to the very core. Beautiful.  I was looking up jobs on Monster, and found no openings available for  Lady of Leisure .  I'm sure it is a much coveted position.  Although, through Google, I did find the  urlLink  Meaning of Life  .  Okay, I'm rolling a thought around in my head (with the other marbles, minus two)...  Do I become a  urlLink corporate bastard ?  I've been hearing it's best to  urlLink incorporate  when starting a small business.  It may sound stupid - but somehow, by word of mouth, I've continued creating unique, custom wedding invitations and baby announcements and other paper things.  People will pay me money to do these!  I think I'd kick myself if I didn't try to make a go of it.  I like my day job, but it doesn't turn my screws.  So these side jobs, I do enjoy them.  The projects are about  celebrating life  - what more could I want?  So, I have to register my business name - I'm thinking  Salutations .  I'm open to suggestions here, hint hint.  Then, I need a domain name, and web hosting.  I hear people are switching from Network Solutions as their customer service and billing sucks ass.  GoDaddy has been recommended.  Then, build the a site with past examples, maybe a bio, get it out there.  BuyDomains.com owns "salutations.com" - so that might could be expensive.   Here's where you come in: I need a fun, unique, and inviting domain name...   (add an anonymous comment)  I thought about "hihowareyou.com" but that's not fun enough.  Maybe "sugartoyou.com".  I dunno.  I'm sure I could use other various extensions too.  None available for "salutations".   urlLink Oblation  is a local shop I envy - although they are somewhat conservative  Locally, I hear  urlLink  Extremo the Clown   is now officially registered to run for Mayor of Portland.  Seems mayoral races are now becoming fun and interesting! In  urlLink Texas  they're having  urlLink Kinky's Governor's Balls .  He wants to outlaw declawing of cats.   Go Kinky!   Offshoot thought... Paige and I met a charming, motorcycle ridin', handsome Frenchman last weekend.  He gave us a puzzled look as we giggled when he said Texas - which he pronounced with emphasis on ASS.   Tex-ASS.   Ooo, he said ass, titter titter.   urlLink  Morrissey Gets a Job     urlLink "Tags?

      Having had my  gallbladder  removed last year, I was working under the assumption that my organ removal was possibly part of transitionary evolution.  My surgeon assured me it was genetics that caused the demise of my gallbladder. Much like we don't use the appendix, the gallbladder is not of much use.  There is rumor out there that the appendix originally helped to digest bone matter - as dogs do.  However, my evolutionary theory is likely wrong, as the general american public continues to subsist on  urlLink fast food . (The gallbladder is a storage facility for bile used in the digestion of fats.  The liver produces this bile, the gallbladder stores it, and when fatty foods are eaten it squirts a bit into the small intestine to help digest those fats.)   urlLink Andy Warhol  died from complications after routine gallbladder surgery in 1987.  The reason I bring all this up?  I know the pain!   urlLink  Ashcroft is in hate-filled pain.    I would like to think that it is his black soul imploding, but simply, and unfortunately, that is not the case.  Having lived with males, cleaned up after males, I can safely assert  urlLink  men cannot successfully pee standing up  .  Stepping in pee spray and puddles is really not flattering to your female housemates.  Try taking some urinary tract infection relief pills - they turn pee orange - see where it all goes.   urlLink eeeooo.  Question: Do you believe in  urlLink women peeing standing up?    urlLink really really really stupid    urlLink develop your skills    Seeing  urlLink Elvis  tonight!   I'm really excited.  And I think it's wow-wonderful that  urlLink he and Diana  hooked up - never would have put those two together.  He wrote six songs on her new album, due out in May.   urlLink ghastly gorey

       urlLink Take Back the White House, because...    "...an analysis of the president and Vice President's past statements show that they were also  urlLink misleading America  four years ago in presenting a wholly different position on the gay marriage issue.

Good News on the  urlLink trans-fats front    urlLink Fun with Bush   Happy  urlLink Super Tuesday . Sometimes voting is a strategic maneuver. I'm not in love with Kerry, and Edwards doesn't do jack for me.  All I know is: Bush needs to go.  Plain and simple.  Elections are always about voting for the lesser of two evils...

      In the wee waking hours between dreamland and the real world, I was fumbling around with that old philosophical debate on  whether people are born good or born bad .  Truly, humans are selfish, self-centered animals - want, need, desire, attention, me me me.  Especially when hungry.  It's a learned behavior to at least try to overcome selfish needs from time to time - give, respond, listen, help, step out of the way, not tailgate, avoid urge to adjust privates in public, and other considerations.  My pondering today: Are we a more civilized society than, say, the days when Romans, or even Vikings, pillaged and plundered?  Atrocities to humans and animals occur  every minute  around the world.  It's overwhelming to think about on the whole, so we push it to the farthest corners of our minds, cover it with soft cushy thoughts, and go about our day.  (I swear, if these things don't cross your mind every now and again, you're a selfish bastard.)  Is compassion learned too?  or innate to our animal make-up?  Yes, a bit somber today... little furry monkey (my siamese) isn't getting better.  Jabbed a needle in his neck again last night to flush his system with fluids.  And I have a needle phobia, that's how much I love him.  Am I keeping him alive, so I can selfishly get comfortable with the thought of losing him?  He is borderline now (as doc said), not suffering, not getting better, will only get worse,  he maybe has a couple of weeks left.  He's ready.  I'm getting ready.  Maybe this weekend.  ouch.  Thinking about seeing  urlLink  this movie   this week.  I really really really wanted to see  urlLink  this   beautiful spectacle, but alas, I am unable...  Oh, the irony...  Not sure why I find  urlLink this  so amusing: James Joseph Mindner was appointed CEO of Smith & Wesson. It later came out that he had been in jail a couple of times for armed robbery - with a 16 gauge sawed-off shotgun.  The papers at the time named him the  "Shotgun Bandit"  for a string of armed robberies.  He also succeeded in a brief prison escape. Mindner resigned, but is still on the board at Smith & Wesson. S & M say he has "changed his ways."   urlLink winter wonderland fun    urlLink Art or Crap?   urlLink Snack or Scat?   It's been around a while, but such  urlLink  great birth control    Found a copy of the  urlLink Big Book of Sign Language  (need Adobe Reader) from  urlLink Rotten , but it's officially been  urlLink removed .  New  urlLink  Get Your War On!     Get Your Ban On . I just sent Nestle an email. Gawd, maybe some beer will wash that nasty taste outta my mouth!  Ptew! Ptheh! Yuk!...   "I just tried your  Nestle Toll House Cookie Candy Bars , and, wow, they are  NASTY!  Thanks for polluting the public, and the earth. Still selling concentrated baby formula to African countries whose water supply is dangerously unhealthy? (Nestle sold baby formula to African countries that needed to be mixed with water - but didn't send the water. Babies died from having to mix with compromised water. Knowing this, Nestle continued this practice for profit.) Nestle is a Big Bad Corporate Company. Does your chocolate contain any cocoa at all? I know wax is cheaper... Thanks for your time, you poor underpaid cubicle person." Back to banning Nestle products.  Man, I had a chocolate craving and that soooo didn't do it for me!    I need a lover to feed me real chocolate...

       urlLink  50 Foot Wave   offered some grinding goodness on Saturday!  Russ sent this  urlLink wonderful link  to some great quicktime videos of those beauties from Throwing Music!  Thank you, Russ!    Still the raging contradictions continue.  Because it's religious in nature, the violence in  Passion  is okay to force children to see?  I'm sure supporters of this film are the same people who complain about violence in media.  Apparently, for bible-thumpers, it's okay to see a guy  tortured to death , but not okay to see a boob.  Meanwhile, Europeans rightly believe "sex is okay, violence is not" and are still laughing at us silly americans.  Yay, boobies, Yay!   urlLink  Satan  is your ticket taker   Go  urlLink here , click on  'Disturbing Video'  link.  Makes you proud to be an american, pass me the cheetos, dooode, let's watch that again!  (right, that was sarcasm there)  Everybody say "Hmmmm"...  urlLink "Osama bin Laden has been arrested a long time ago, but Bush is intending to use it for propaganda maneuvering in the presidential election."   Here's  urlLink another .  Hey, yesterday was Leap Day and I was seriously lacking in my duty... February 29 -- also known as  urlLink  Sadie Hawkins day   -- is traditionally a woman’s day to ask a man out or even propose marriage (but that’s not to leave the men out!). This custom started long before the comic  urlLink L’il Abner  made Sadie Hawkins day a popular idea in the 1930’s. It reportedly began in Ireland in the 5th century when St. Bridget convinced St. Patrick to allow one special day that a woman could propose. If the man refused, he was to be fined. (Incidentally, Bridget proposed to Patrick and he said no … not known if he paid a fine). Some 1,600 years later, there are no fines (whose idea was it to stop that?), but women still have this day every 4 years set aside to profess their love.  As if we don't already profess our love, and the guy says something like "It's not me it's you" and runs off to get involved with some raging psycho, then he returns after his heart has been put through a meat grinder to say "I really didn't know what I had with you" and it's then you realize what a putz he was anyway and what an incredible, vivacious, independent woman you are and that you've moved on and initially started clever projects to relieve heartache yet said projects are now blossoming and wow you really don't give a shit if you've got a man in your life or not except for that occasional urge to get drilled part but then again do you really need a man for that anyway.........   urlLink  Cute and fun and insanely clever   on so many levels. If you're a creative thinker, you are going to use up a lot of time here.   U.S. defends democracy... blinding us with the shining integrity of the current administration... cough, hack, horf....   urlLink "He was abducted by the United States. A democratically elected president, abducted by the United States in the commission of an American induced coup. This is a frightening thing to contemplate."    urlLink  Mass layoffs set record in January

      My calendar says today is  Holocaust Remembrance Day .  For some reason I've had a lifelong 'connection' to the events of WWII, emphasis on the craziness of the world to allow the  urlLink annihilation of 6 million people .  Ironically, the current political craziness is incredibly similar to what gave rise to Hitler.  I smell facism in the air.   urlLink  Kathe Kollwitz   was the first artist to ever move me, inspire me.  Imagine what she saw on a daily basis, what she lived through.  I was part of an exchange program in high school, travelled to Germany, when the wall was still up, and took a step back in time at  urlLink  Bergen-Belsen  , the concentration camp where  urlLink Anne Frank  died.  There were no buildings, only dozens of grass-covered mounds, each with a "guess-timation" of how many were buried in each.  To add tongue-in-cheek, there was an american military base next door and they were practicing war games that day - bombs going off, planes, helicopters, machine gun fire... no words to fully describe the profundity of that day.  Yes, of course I need to mention,  urlLink  Schindler's List   was a masterpiece of history on film.  Thanks to Steven Spielberg for telling the story.  He also started the  urlLink  Shoah Foundation   to record a visual history from survivors.  I've watched endless documentaries, including the  urlLink Nuremberg Trials .   urlLink  The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum   in Washington DC is incredible.  Three levels of multi-media separated into time periods.  Very well done.  Most people say, "How could that happen?"  The first level, first time period lays that out very well.  See the faces of the people who lived.  See the systematic degradation of a people. Walk through a room full of thousands of shoes left by those who disembarked the train.  I saw people crying in corners.  I don't know how anyone could not have been moved.  However, at closing, we were escorted en-masse to the doors - and a young woman in front of me said to her companion (in a kind of sing-song bubblegum teenage way), "Well, that was sad. Where do you want to go eat?"  I would never do it, but felt like slapping the stupid shallow bitch... so easily dismissed??

      I attended the  ultimate  urlLink metrosexual  fest  last night!  Paige took me to see  urlLink  Air   at Crystal Ballroom.  It's okay music (as Paige says,  urlLink good for driving & sex ), but for me, it's hard work paying attention at an electronica show. I mean, they kinda just stand around behind keyboards and look forlorn.  So, looking around, I couldn't help busting up laughing.  The place was filled to the brim with metrosexuals!   urlLink A Salon reporter answers  "How do you know a metrosexual?":  "How do I know? Well, perhaps it takes one to know one, but to determine a metrosexual, all you have to do is look at them. In fact, if you're looking at them, they're almost certainly metrosexual. The typical metrosexual is a young man with money to spend, living in or within easy reach of a metropolis -- because that's where all the best shops, clubs, gyms and hairdressers are. He might be officially gay, straight or bisexual, but this is utterly immaterial because  he has clearly taken himself as his own love object and pleasure as his sexual preference . Particular professions, such as modeling, waiting tables, media, pop music and, nowadays, sport, seem to attract them but, truth be told, like male vanity products and herpes, they're pretty much everywhere."  like the  urlLink metrosexual tarot   I know I know the term  urlLink "metrosexual" is soooo 2003 . But, I swear on my cat's ashes, Portland is overrun with these creatures!  They're more into image than most women I know.  Greasy shags, skinny (rumored to have eating disorders), with tight "vintage" (store-bought) t-shirts, really tight girl-pants (tight enough to see their dna helix), a brooding look on their face - and the must-have for any metrosexual -  the *man-bag*  - the square-ish messenger bag over the shoulder with strap across the chest.  ( urlLink are you a metrosexual? )  We made up a new version of that old game "Slug Bug" - you know - when you see a Volkswagon Beetle you slug your friend in the arm and say "Slug Bug!"  We had a great (if not infantile) time slugging each other, saying  "Slug Bag!"  every time we saw a guy with man-bag in tow.  Yes, we are in our thirties... and yes, we are dorks.  But the difference between we dorks and the metrosexuals... we *know* we are dorks, and laugh at ourselves daily.  metrosexuals seem so  non-sexual  to me.  they are  in love with themselves , and put an incredible amount of energy into image - which in the long run doesn't really matter (much like the expousing of pat robertson or rush limbaugh). and they are  primarily mass consumers  - much like women with make-up, clothes and department stores fully dedicated to women's consumption. it's another disease, I'm telling you!  anyway, a good time was had by all.  we stopped into cassidy's for a cocktail on the way home.  hadn't been in there since, well, when I used to work in bars.  they were known to serve right up until 2:28am.  bar industry people would rush to get served after work.  and drunk patrons would flood the place from other bars that had already shut down service - it became known as "the last chance for romance".  ah, memories...  Mark Morford asks  urlLink "Is Your Porn Safe?"     urlLink Scalia Shows His Cards :  "It is already well-known that former Enron CEO Ken Lay and other energy industry executives were involved in shaping the nation's energy policy through the task force. But Dick Cheney doesn't believe the American people have the right to know the extent of their involvement."

      I know I know I know, I said I wasn't going into the nitty gritty of election mud-slinging, but when bruce sent this (thanks bruce!) I couldn't help but post... compare for yourself:   what did bush, cheney & kerry do during the vietnam war?    George W. Bush:  Bush joined the Texas Air National Guard in 1968 after graduating from Yale University. During his first year of service, he took an eight-week leave to work on a Senate campaign in Florida. Bush graduated from flight school at Moody Air Force Base in Georgia in 1969 and completed Combat Crew Training School at Ellington Air Force Base in Texas in 1970. He participated in drills and alerts at Ellington and began working for a Houston-based agricultural company. After his last flight as a Guard member in 1972, Bush moved to Alabama to work on another Senate campaign. He was assigned to guard National Guard units in Alabama. There is no record of him reporting for duty there, but Bush says he did participate. He lost his flight credentials after missing a physical exam. Bush participated in non-flying drills at Ellington in 1973 and worked at an inner-city poverty program. In the fall, he began attending Harvard Business School and was placed on inactive Guard duty about six months before his six-year commitment ended.   Dick Cheney:  Cheney received five student and marriage deferments of service during the war. He received his first student deferment in 1963, while enrolled at Casper College in Wyoming. His status was renewed twice when he was an undergraduate at the University of Wyoming in Laramie. After graduating in 1965, Cheney became a graduate student in the fall and obtained another deferment. He received a deferment under a provision for parents in 1966, when his wife, Lynne, became pregnant. Cheney told The Washington Post in 1989, "I had other priorities in the '60s than military service. ... I don't regret the decisions I made. I complied fully with all the requirements of the statutes, registered with the draft when I turned 18. Had I been drafted, I would have been happy to serve."   John Kerry:  After graduating from Yale University in 1966, Kerry volunteered for the Navy and served two tours of duty in Vietnam. In his first tour, he spent four months on the USS Gridley frigate off Vietnam's shore. He volunteered for the second tour, where he served nearly five months as a swiftboat commander in the Mekong Delta and won three Purple Hearts, a Bronze Star and a Silver Star. Kerry's three war injuries -- all minor -- were enough to allow him an early return to stateside duty. After petitioning for honorable discharge six months early in 1969, Kerry ran for a House seat in Massachusetts, but later gave up his bid for the Democratic nomination. He joined Vietnam Veterans Against the War and became its leading spokesman. During a protest in April 1971, Kerry threw his war ribbons over a fence at the Capitol.

      I really don't feel like working today. news has it that we may outsource the redesigning of our web site to that numbskull consultant. there goes another chunk of money to that  inflated spleen-shaped, dan-rather-look-alike . it's the "boys club" making these decisions... when they have two or three perfectly capable women as part of their marketing team that could accomplish so much more than that  bloated hot air meathead .  makes me wonder: are women still seen (consciously or unconsciously) as incapable of doing what men do?  do we need to sprout balls, keep 'em in a jar on our desks, and jingle them every so often as a reminder we are equal?   use that feminine seductive intuitive ingenuity to seduce your clients, man! women are wired to see many levels at once. let us nuance it!  means I won't be getting that pay increase that is owed.  I've been here almost three years, no raise, pay cuts, prices keep going up... I make much less than when started.  I hear I could make double installing car stereos... or even answering telephones.  6 month plan to move on is solidifying.  election mud-slinging has begun...  would love to see junior and kerry mud-wrestle in an actual mud-pit.   so, I may not have much to spout off on concering the elections until the playoffs in the fall.   hang in there kucinich.  go john "I won't stand for it" kerry!   urlLink eric blumrich spouts off about nader  - very nice spout indeed.  good read -  urlLink  american mistakes in iraq    will likely see  urlLink  storm & the balls   tomorrow night.  it's been a while.  need to get my fix.  she'd likely wear a  urlLink Yarmulkebra   may look forward to  urlLink anarchists in film , and/or  urlLink painters on film    urlLink songs to wear pants to  - give him a phrase and he'll create a song  urlLink  exploding dog   - give him a phrase and he'll draw you a picture - just darling!  urlLink eric conveys an emotion  - give him a phrase and he'll make a face  from the geniuses at MIT...  urlLink compose your own symphony software    I used to really love bowie  (before "let's dance" - not to mention the tin machine fiasco!). his latest album was pretty good though.  so, is  urlLink  this   an attempt to say "really I'm still hip and out there"?  I'm not sure I'd want to hear what others came up with...  then again, some covers are better than the original.  kinda like with  urlLink beth orton's  " urlLink other side of daybreak " - remixes spiced her up a bit.  I know I will likely  urlLink  pounce   on D when I see him this weekend.  my initial inclination is make him feel so damn happy, open my core self, let him in.  but I must admit to some  urlLink  fears   creeping in.  no risk, no reward, right?  I would love to delve into creating a  urlLink  surreal graphic online novel   someday... not necessarily like that one, but my own.  I will endeavor to paint myself having tea with my personal demons (fear, anxiety, doubt) someday soon.  gads posting alone takes up a lot of time - how the heck do some of these bloggers have so much time on their hands - seen the light of day lately??   get outside and talk to some people, darnit!

I had fun singing along with the " urlLink beer beer beer " song earlier, and enjoying other juevenile stuff on that site.  find your own personal rate of breathing this weekend.  no need to match anyone else's.  where are you really at, my friend?  what hue and intensity are you?  are you one to directly stare into the face, or blink nervously avoiding connection?  how smooth is your sea?  what would make you dive in to risk everything?  who do you love?  what is the most calming place on your body to place a hand? a fingertip?  do you allow or resist?  you are not the same from this moment to the next: (like a heart beat) whoareyounow, whoareyounow, whoareyounow?  when you reach into the darkness do you expect hurt or reward or a curious thing to be explored?  I could go on and on. yeah, birthdays really fuck me up...

       ohmyhell am I tired.   I'm getting old.  late nights kill me now.  and yikes, I'll be turning 36 this weekend.  that's  thirtyfuckingsix .  holy ouch-my-back-hurts, batman! fuck getting old, let's get drunk!  but I need to be in bed by 11pm, k?  yesterday, I ditched work early to go to the   urlLink Democratic Meetup  , held at Pied Cow Coffeehouse.  there were about 25 or 30 concerned citizens, all ages, eating humus and drinking tea.  (gawd, I miss living in SE - more diversified than the walmart/quiznos/stripmall hell I moved to)  it was generally an invitation to do more, to volunteer, grassroots style.  and I did get some good tidbits of info... like  oregon is considered a swing state  by rove and company... they figure florida will go dem, as will others, but oregon will be a key player in the next election.  this was brought up not by the moderator, but by others in the group.  I sat next to some very practical & active people who really knew their shit.  I was very happy I was not at the other end where a few people were butting heads about Kerry & Kucinich, who should get votes & support (it was more ego than anything).  I will likely make the effort to become a Precinct Committee Person for my area... but can you imagine canvassing for votes at the 7-Eleven??  much less trying to find someone who has their green card.  much less find someone who isn't preoccupied with the latest sale at K-Mart.  "so, how do you feel about your air quality?"

The Middle Eastern nightclub in Cambridge, Massachusetts is used to seeing its clientele thrashing about in front of the stage, but on Monday nights the energetic dancing amongst the beer taps and ashtrays is of an entirely different nature -- this is punk rock aerobics.   It's enough to make Sid Vicious turn in his grave -- the snot and the spit of punk in the seventies is now one of the latest trends in America's quest for fitness.   Punk Rock Aerobics was founded by punk lovers Maura Jasper and Hilken Mancini, both of whom have a serious aversion to gyms and a deep-seated fear of doing leg lifts to Lionel Richie, but as they hit their thirties the girls realised they needed to do some exercise.   "It's kind of like a joke that got really out of control" laughed Jasper recalling the birth of the idea for Punk Rock Aerobics , "It was just a joke, something you talked about at three o'clock in the morning after you'd been pogoing with six beers under your belt..."  Listening to classic punk bands like the Ramones, the Clash and the Sex Pistols, Mancini said she realised it wasn't exercise she was afraid of, but the conventional beat driven music normally played in gyms, "We'd been playing singles, the Eater and the Ramones, and saying 'oh I would totally go and exercise if music like this was played." "Today is Earth Day and millions of Americans will celebrate by doing something to improve the environment – cleaning up trash in a local park, planting a tree, or making their home more energy efficient. Meanwhile, the   urlLink Bush administration will celebrate Earth Day by inviting oil-industry officials to the Environmental Protection Agency to discuss a plan to relax pollution standards   for gasoline. The plan would allow higher sulfur content gasoline to be sold during the summer months."   urlLink  The Other War: A Look At the Role of Women in Post-9/11 Afghanistan      urlLink Why Won't Dubya Apologize?

      so I hear on the local news last night that " urlLink conservative freaks of oregon " are taking their fear-based rage on to the capitol to try to amend the state constitution to ban  same sex marriage .  I haven't seen or heard much in the news lately about the issue.  Multnomah County (Portland) is still issueing licenses, righteous weddings are still happening, however licenses are not being filed, until the issue has been confirmed through court system.  A suit by 9 same sex couples & ACLU tried sueing, but case was thrown out.  Local mainstream news sites aren't carrying jack about the issue - last I saw was from  urlLink March 23 .  Nader was disappointed yesterday (but I wasn't!) as  urlLink Candidate Fails To Attract Necessary Crowd .  Apparently he was greeted by protestors who stated  we need to put our support behind one candidate to give Bush the boot, and that candidate is going to be John Kerry.   (is that a little better, D?)  My first question to some folks who complain about the state of the union is, "did you vote?"  If you're pissed off at the crookery in DC, then put down the fried pork rinds,  get off that lazy-boy and vote for kerry you chump.   I mean, check out  urlLink The Mercury Scandal : "E.P.A. staffers say they were told not to undertake the normal scientific and economic studies called for under a standing executive order... E.P.A. veterans say they cannot recall another instance where the agency's technical experts were cut out of developing a major regulatory proposal."  If BushCo can bypass select laws, and due process, next they'll be making a paper airplane out of the bill of rights.  Then, get ready to live  urlLink The Handmaid's Tale .   urlLink Powell's Books  is hosting a  urlLink  MoveOn book   event this Thursday.  First Unitararian Church, 1101 SW 12th Ave, 7:30pm.  Talk.

I was tired and amusing myself mentally.  noticed a musician on stage with white-haired comb-over and very (ahem) stylish glasses.  I leaned over to Paige: "I didn't know Dick Cheney played cello."  Paige: "Really?? I didn't know that either."  she can be so cute.  so, yes I kinda feel crappy today.  you're just going to have to get your kicks by clicking on a few links here.   grumble.   really, these  are  entertaining...   urlLink please, share with us how you really feel...    urlLink  this cracks me up   every time I see it - they were there 7am on a Sunday! and yet another caco event:  urlLink beware the brides of march - sf event    urlLink new Get Your War On    urlLink  Say it after me: "If you can't aim, don't hover."      urlLink mommie! mommie! this one tastes like whiskey, with grenadine frosting! yummy!   back to grind - I think they actually expect me to do stuff around here - can you  believe that???    grumble.

      Happy Friday.  Will be back on Monday!  I am so damn lucky to have such great, intelligent, depthy, goofy friends.  Thank you for being you, where ever you are, and even if I haven't talked to you in months, I still think you rock!  this morning, decided to stop in to my fav strip mall coffee shop and splurge on a little  urlLink Panache .  their are a couple o' kids that work there that are so geeky cute.  the guy is really young, tall, skinny, lanky, awkward, has a big lisp and loves to mention all the bands he's in.  the girl has darling poofy curly pigtails, and that cutely innocent insecurity causing her to grin really big when she's nervous, and giggles.  those two just put a big smile on my face.  so young & sweet, with the fire of idealism and an unknown future.  Russ was kind enough to let me know the  urlLink  EP of 50 Foot Wave is out!    So, as an early birthday present to myself, I ordered it.  And also added in  urlLink Storm & the Balls CD  too.  Yah-freakin-hoo!  So, I was on the phone for a good long time last night (someone was massaging my brain quite nicely) and the  urlLink  little creepy crawly oily-winged six-legged antennaed critters   kept coming out of the woodwork to  urlLink flit across the countertop, skitter into crevices , and generally give me the heebie-jeebies and disgust me beyond belief with the realization yet again, that I live in a white-trash roach motel and I'm stuck in a lease through october so just get a bug bomb and deal with it and thanks to bush I have to live in this polluted hell hole because if the economy were better we would all have jobs that suited us and were paid a real living wage wow I would be able to live in a place that didn't cause me   urlLink such mental unrest  .  whew - I love a good long ranting run-on sentence. I know they sprayed my neighbors apartment yesterday, so their pets came to visit me.  I know  urlLink it could be worse , but, eeeooo.  critters! getting very familiar with leaping around my kitchen like a shivering epileptic fool and diving for the "crunch & ooze" - oh yuk!  passing along a great recipe -  urlLink donna reed ala horror flick    urlLink  did I or did I not mention the need for a whistleblower in the 9/11 hearings?     So many great articles today:    urlLink Soldiers of Good Fortune    urlLink President Bush: Flip-Flopper-In-Chief    urlLink Rwanda Ten Years Ago: How the World Stood Back and Watched a Genocide    urlLink Three Mile Island: 25th Anniversary of The Worst Nuclear Accident in U.S. History    urlLink Billy Bragg is living the life every ex-punk should aspire to    urlLink Woman paid for a car with breast milk    urlLink Marines' weapon loaded with 'scream'   Kissing the blog: check out Two Muses post on March 31 -  urlLink  time is a healer   - unconditional beauty  face to sky... close your eyes... drink in warm sun...

      being as my birthday is this month, I guess I *am* an  urlLink  april fool    not much to ponitificate about today... except I've been an extremely heartfilled person lately...

      gads, I'm freaked!  having both feet butchered tomorrow by surgeon.  but it's gotta be done, it's important I know.  but I'm gonna be naked under an easy-access smock, dosed up with some kinda heavy narcotic, having strangers poking at me!!!  doesn't anyone understand? I'm freaked out!  lordy knows what else they will do to me while I'm "under"!  and there is just something so unnatural about metal and flesh.  it's a day away and I'm already out of my gourd...  two key words for you:  urlLink  bone shaving    maybe I'll treat myself to a shopping spree, get some  urlLink  possum fur nipple warmers  ... oh so sexy... come on baby, get some fur between your teeth...   urlLink  stop eating poop     urlLink ooga booga   didn't have the greatest of conversations with d last night. maybe I shouldn't take us to heart like I have been?  little does he know, while I'm laughing on the phone with him, I also have sword in hand fending off the demons who tell me to ditch & run before I get hurt, and I have been courageous in this battle, until last night when his fear shook hands with mine.  every woman wants to feel she is very special... I see red flags when someone sets limits on what we *should* be feeling, rather than just letting it happen... feelings don't follow a linear timeline, yes? ...talking so casually after such intimacy...?  I assumed good feelings all around.  Whether it was meant or not, I heard doubt.  a corner of my heart broke a little, my feelings are hurt.  and I'm not sure how to mend it. I'm waaaaay too emotional about tomorrow to think about this any more - and freaky emotions about tomorrow very well could be latching themselves onto surrounding circumstances...

      my hair is exceptionally large and wiley today.  I swear I have a wild hairy animal living on my head.  wonder if I let it grow, if I'll need to start feeding it...?  okay, first Rummy takes responsibility for abuse of iraqi prisoners... I have an "iron stomach" and these abuses make me want to blow latte out my nose... yesterday, Rummy received praise from our lead Shrub that he's done a fine good job (classic good ol' boys club)... now, Dick Cheney actually refers to Rummy as "the best secretary of defense the United States has ever had." may I just add:  WTF?    urlLink  New Poll: Is Rumsfeld the Best Ever?      urlLink Sign John Kerry's petition for Rummy to resign    this is bad, but have to post:  urlLink  happy mother's day   and, yes, I have mother issues, dammit   urlLink  getcher bear fighting outfits   while you still can!!  paige might get  urlLink this costume  for her huge, cute, furry, pooping canine beast... inevitably the dog wearing a tutu is going to need to drop a pile... funny mental visual complete with guilty look dogs get: "don't watch me poop... in a tutu!"   urlLink  Alberta Art Hop  this Saturday!

      listen to the gentle hum of my brain trying to kick into gear... moanday, moanday...   did the  Election Action Day  for  urlLink MoveOn  on Saturday. knocked on doors to register voters... but most of them were already registered... and most of them want Bush out!!!...  P-town turned out 300-400 volunteers... 36 cities in swing states participated the same day...will be good to see final numbers...  enjoyed down time on sunday... and gave me time to miss dov... so in the mood to pleasure that boy   urlLink  you touch my tralala    hey,   urlLink Jim Spagg  , the naked community access television guy, died on Saturday.  wonder if they will bury him naked too.   urlLink  obit     urlLink  Ask Bush to Stand Up to a Real Debate    as russ says, "here we go again":  urlLink stopping iran's nukes     urlLink boycott disney petition    urlLink  When You Wish Upon A Star  … by Michael Moore  and, oh yeah,  urlLink  torturing iraqi prisoners   is sooooo clearing the way for democracy, another five steps backward in the way of foreign relations, and clearing the way for more love for the united states.  I predict another attack in the u.s. before the november elections - whether it's allowed to happen by BushCo or not, that will likely remain an issue between the good ol' boys and their god.

He's a very good man.  And I am a busy good woman.  This can work, right?  A cute young young young man hit on me last night, and all I could do was smile and say, "sorry I'm taken"... and he looked around and asked, "well, where is he?"...

I signed up to be a team leader for the  urlLink MoveOn /America Votes gig on saturday... it's the  urlLink  National Election Action Day  , where people in 17 "swing" states (like oregon), all on the same day, canvass to register voters.  any other year, I wouldn't expect much success... this year, wow, I'm finding people are *passionate* about politics because of BushCo... I'm sure I can find an issue that matters with anyone, as BushCo has pissed people off all across the board... whether it's the economy/jobs, the environment, civil rights & freedoms, iraq & our boys not adequately equipped & being killed daily, being lied to about WMDs, lack of affordable healthcare, rollbacks on a woman's right to choose etceterafuckingetcetera... heck, even pat robertson hates Bush!... urlLink  W, you're fired!   and,  urlLink  Arianna Huffington   will be speaking briefly that day at the training!  treat!  also, Amy Goodman, of  urlLink  Democracy Now!   will be in town that same day as part of her  urlLink "The Exception to the Rulers"  Tour!   yikes... having foot surgery next week ... asked if I'd be put out or awake or what... they'll be giving me a heavy narcotic so I won't know what's going on, but will be 'awake'... so I joked with doc, "oh so you get to see me drooling on myself"... she chuckled... she told me she had a woman last week who kept singing...  holymotherofsatan , I am going to embarrass myself in some gawdawful way!!!... yeah, believe it or not, that's the part I am most concerned about now... drug me up and watch me go!... oh dear...  enjoyed  urlLink  Dinner Grrls   deal last night.  met some really cool women!  very well might attend a few more.  then hung out downtown until  urlLink  storm   came on to give yet another incredible show.

      I am so very much fucking around at work today.  while surfing, I've been delving into strange territories of off-kilter ranting.  my mood?  pixies  'where is my mind'  comes to mind.  speaking of which, I may go see  urlLink storm  sing that tomorrow night.  oh to be  urlLink  dry-humping   around town in your underwear   urlLink  getchor own retro wall-sized picture mural  ... my dad put up a photo mural in our living room in the 70s... it was a forest path with sun coming through the trees... why he didn't choose the cheesier beach sunset mural, I don't know...   urlLink  retrobuzz rants about cochella  ... and another funny rant, pertaining to my post yesterday:  4) loretta lynn/jack white collaboration-note to world: jack white the artist blows. jack white the producer blows. jack white the f*cking student blows. jack white the tv/vcr repairman blows.  jack white the everything blows.  i've heard some 'pieces' from this album, & it is not good. i knew it was an omen when the crappy indie-gone-wired-starbucks down the street from my flat had mini-promo posters of loretta's album all over the tables a couple weeks ago.  if you like it, i'll bet you'll be drinking yourself silly in 6 month's asking yourself, 'why, why god why did i think i like this album?!' i'm not knocking loretta lynn per se. she's classic. not my pint of lager, but whatevs. i will say she was pretty savvy to have jack put his brand of stink all over her album to boast the audience & mainstream appeal. i would've had more respect for her had it been a secret producer deal, not leaked/released until much later. i would have thought, 'hmmm, it sucks, but it's something different for her.' I laughed so hard listening to " urlLink Fuck It (I Don't Want You Back) "... r&b can be so honest, but sung with such urgency it comes out sounding ridiculous... reminds me of " urlLink fuck you tonight " [ urlLink download ]  loved  urlLink  margaret cho's wuthering heights rant  .

"Terrorists, Saddam loyalists, and anti-American insurgents: Please stop bringing it on now," Bush said at a Monday press conference. "Nine months and 500 U.S. casualties ago, I may have invited y'all to bring it on, but as of today, I formally rescind that statement. I would officially like for you to step back." The president added that the "it" Iraqis should stop bringing includes gunfire, bombings, grenade attacks, and suicide missions of all types.  well, I think I've gotten my pay-cuts worth of blogging done today.  pay me what I'm worth dammit!   question: is there some kind of voodoo involved if someone still has a pair of your underwear and your toothbrush??

I'm still digesting  weekend in sf with dov . overall, great food, great sex, great company, who could ask for anything more, right??  but there was more... a lot more... almost way too much more... I was, at times, overwhelmed, & over-stimulated... light & sound & people & colors & tastes & smells & touching & winds & water & pounding of pavement & straining to concentrate on that special someone with so much going on around us & unknowns & blue sky & motorcycles rumbling by & tripping on cracks in the befuddled sidewalks & music blaring from storefronts & look at this & look at that & people people people & through it all a calm hand holding mine... feels now like a typhoon hit, and now the wild waters are receding.  we are both playing cautious, and I can't see what lays ahead... time... give it time... feels good, feels right, its just the syncing of our lives...

      gads, is my life that small?  well, likely not, as I really don't give a shite about today's office stinking molehill... but it's fucking funny to watch co-workers get all riled up about each other's actions... they: "I mean, can you belieeeeve that???"... me: "um, yes"... they: "well doesn't it piss you off?"... me: "well, no. should it? does it really affect my life? to tell you the truth I live in another dimension sharing the same space as yours, and well, in my reality, you all don't really exist"... well, I will share anyway, 'cause it's just dang funny watching everyday humanity act out... here goes... our hypocritical-bible-thumpin' baby-poppin' uneducated annoying germ-phobic receptionist put up little signs on the back of each door in the bathroom, every stall: "don't spread germs!!! wash your hands after using the toilet!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!" (actual number of exclamation points)... okay, yes, I wash my hands religiously, and I do believe it's digusting when people don't wash their hands... I give dirty looks to go with dirty hands... and heck, I don't think men, in general,  ever  wash their hands after touching their dicks after urinating, and then go around touching all sorts of common doorknobs and walls and pens and shaking hands with each other and eeeeoooo... yuk... but, hey, what can one do about it?... nothing!... our receptionist is a phobic freak (and I don't normally have the energy to expend on her)... let me put this in context...  the woman drives her own damn car using baby wipes to touch the steering wheel ... yes, her own fucking car!... she is that *phobic* (how the hell did she ever get impregnated?)... that's one example of the phobic-insanity witnessed within this group of animals I share 80+ hours a week with... apparently she's mad at a particular woman with another company down the hall who is guilty of not washing... and, get this, captain cranky wanted to go in person to the woman's office to tell her boss!... dang shit fart, a co-worker talked her out of it!... if recepti-psycho had asked me (ugh that might require my giving her the time of day), I would have said, "oh yes, I think you should tell her boss!  he needs to know! and he needs to put a stop to his employee's lack of hand washing! you go girl!"... then watch as other boss storms down hall to talk to our boss... oh what a show!... dang, I hope she does it anyway, I hope she can't help herself... gads, little crap like this makes me laugh!... some people really live for seinfeld-type minutia... crazies...  speaking of seinfeld... he really went all out for these  urlLink  lengthy, yet somehow entertaining, ads featuring jerry, his amex card and superman  .

       my inner tim burton geek  reveals itself...  Tim Burton has a new stop motion animated film coming out this year called  Corpse Bride .  It's based off of a Russian folktale of a man who accidentally weds a corpse.  Here's a link to an  urlLink  article  ... as well as a  urlLink  picture of the Corpse Bride  ...

      I swear, I had the best time with my family last night... well, beside the expected indigestion with eating outside my intended diet... and really enjoyed seeing my father... he is such a good man, always having taken on personal responsibility for whatever came his way... no one can compare in integrity with he or my grandfather... they have set the bar quite high... still feeling warm from last night  invited my sister to go to  urlLink  montage   with me and paige... should be a blast... and it's usually hoppin' on weekends... expecting a looooong line to get in... and can't wait for beach on saturday with russ alan & paige!   urlLink  stupid internet ads  ... a rant   urlLink  tell cheney: prove it or resign     urlLink  act now to stop genocide in sudan    okay okay, I'm going to rant only one more time, I promise! there is a part of me that wishes he would visit this weekend, to help transition us to friends.  to heal.  but I don't think he could handle it.  like I asked him to, and I'm happy, he did not respond.  in not seeing him this weekend, we will likely never speak again, I s'pose.  it's too bad.  I may not have communicated appropriately - but communication is a two way street - and I'm pretty tired of being told I'm the bad guy for having feelings - and tired of kid-gloving people... I'd like to be understood... have my thoughts & feelings appreciated, not opposed & condemned for their existence... however, I may not be able to reciprocate here: I cannot understand the long-distance-switcheroo, only that it is his baggage that has destroyed us here - not committing to long distance because of past experience... now *that* is pretty black & white

      the bigger part of this is... in his world we haven't started a relationship until we're in the same city... the flaw: I love my life, my job, my friends, my family... what would make me move, what would make either of us move, unless we had some kind of commitment to the relationship in hand???... will one of us just randomly move to city we never considered before??  that's fucked up logic.  oh please don't get your whitie-tightie's in a bunch... you wanted direct?... I sound more harsh than I mean... but it is how I feel... I will root around in the depths of my soul, to find how I really feel, and give you the straight "what is" any given time of day... then shrug and say "whatev"... to then skip off happily in another direction, stop for a moment, look back, smile and ask "well what are you waiting for? come on, hurry up, let's move!"

      yes, I talked with the psychic on friday... the first thing he said to me: "Men Lie!"... if we took men out of the picture, everything would be fine... he said, "you treat boys like men, however democratic that may be," he says, "they are still boys, remember that"... a lot of of it made no sense at all, but the friend who referred me said the same thing yet now she says he was 90% accurate... much was said, about me and everyone around me... much to contemplate, look forward to, and beware of  watching me this weekend you wouldn't know that I had a wild weekend... seeing me sitting in various places, daydreaming while trees blustered in the winds and the sun beat down with all its 90 degree glory, reading books, drinking iced coffee on the porch... no one would have seen the wild ride I've been on... internal spring cleaning (as well as physical spring cleaning of my home)... new beginnings require tossing of old tattered things... stumbled on a picture of zorn, stuffed it in the back of my files... tossed old receipts of past nights out with friends... weeded through my mother's old recipe books from a time when she still had a foot in the real world... rewrote my address book to only include current people: goodbye michael, goodbye steve, goodbye mr. payne, goodbye to the rest of you: you all had your time with me, but I cannot allow your memories to cling to me any longer... time to, at last, spread wing and fully pleasure myself rolling around in new flowers  don't get me wrong,  I had a blast this weekend ... re-arranging, re-organizing, taking inventory, putting things in their rightful place of priority (or lack thereof)...

       by Hafiz translated by Daniel Ladinsky    I taste what you taste. I know the kind of lyrics your Soul most likes. I know which sounds will become Resplendent in your mind and bring such pleasure Your feet will jump and whirl.   I have no use for divine patience -- my lips are always Burning and everywhere. I am running from every corner Of this world and sky wanting to kiss you.   I am rioting at your door; I am spinning in midair like golden falling leaves Trying to win your glance.   I am sweetly rolling against your walls and shores All night, even though you are asleep. I am singing from The mouths of animals and birds. . . to let  you know the Beautiful Truth  For more poetry by Hafiz, check out * urlLink The Subject Tonight Is Love: 60 Wild & Sweet Poems of Hafiz * by Daniel Ladinsky

I don't like to share! ... continue and wonder who else has been kissing those lips?... eeeooo... and seriously have had enough of  "you're so great, lis, and sooooo much fun in bed, but I'm not in love with you... but we could still sleep together"... um, no ... sounds like I might have heard that not too far off down the road... I deserve so much better... either I'm *it* or I'm not... the older I get, the less patience I have for wasting my time...  and I keep hearing that fucking  Wheat " urlLink I met a girl "  song everywhere...  grrrr   I got drunk sunday afternoon with paige and eric.  food, cocktails & sidewalk seating was perfect for making fun of the white trash walking down to portland rose festival fun center (aka, scum center, sperm center).  navy ships pull in, sailors decend.  it's fact that pdx's birth rate rises 9 months after rose fest.  we saw a LOT of  urlLink single moms  pushing stollers: "honey, I'm sure we'll find your daddy this year"...  eric is a plumber. he got a call about a clogged toilet. he couldn't snake whatever it was out.  the lady wouldn't say what it was in the toilet. turns out he needs to replace the toilet.  out of courtesy, he asks the lady if he should smash the old toilet and return whatever object was clogging it.  she says 'no, just throw it away'. he hauls it off.  but curiosity gets the best of him.  he smashes the toilet to find a huge  urlLink potato  carved in the shape of a penis!  wowzers, she coulda just gone down to the corner store and picked up a really nice piece of latex... momma always said 'honey, don't play with your vegetables'... talk about plugging up someone's tailpipe  watched  urlLink  Bubba Ho Tep   last night... gotta love  urlLink  Bruce Campbell  !   urlLink  today in alternate history

      thank Whomever it's flippin' friday ( urlLink twiff )... not that things are bad, but looking forward to less static atmosphere  there was some kinda music playing tonight, but forgot what it was... saturday,  urlLink  Violent Femmes   are playing the waterfront at the rose festival scum center... as   urlLink willie week  's Mark Baumgarten puts it:   "As Wisconsin's only contribution to the world of popular music, besides the Bodeans and beer, the Violent Femmes have had a lot to work against. Of course, when you write a song like "Blister in the Sun," all those walls come tumbling down. And that song has been played out to the point that even Donald Rumsfeld probably shakes his ass to it. But the trio has bucketloads of other quirky pop songs to play while that drunk guy behind you screams. "Play 'Blisterssinasun'!" (6pm, $5)  does anyone else think VF's "blind leading the naked" sounded a little *born again*??  will see  urlLink  chronicles of riddick   with bonnie sunday... she is such a hoot to see movies with... so fun!  she keeps trying to drag me in to see the babe-fest that is  urlLink  troy  .  also may bust out another block to carve the logo for my biz!  finally getting the itch to begin that  urlLink uphill journey that is fun but going nowhere ...   so much to do -    urlLink so little time   ... in difficult times, ask yourself:   "what would  urlLink kate & ashley  do?"    urlLink  Virginia is for Haters  ... "This whole idea is: Don't spend your money in a place where people hurt you"  ahhh,  urlLink  The Onion  ... always good for poignant humor... this week's headlines include: " Reagan's Body Dies ," "Nancy Reagan Available At 82," "Oil Prices Soar Like Noble Eagle," " Grieving Rush Limbaugh Hurls Self Into Reagan's Grave ," and "Reagan To Be Honored With $5,000-A-Head Funeral"  I could have been high last night, but think I heard a news story about  urlLink  genetically engineered salmon   - we're talking "franken-fish" here, very scary - and they mentioned "faced with a food shortage, they start eating each other"... look forward to *mad fish disease"... you'll sprout gills and salivate over your neighbor's baby

I liked the mission, but the "non-profit" operates like an evil corporation where their employees are concerned... they are in cahoots with a union busting company; laid off a bunch of union people in "budget cuts" while in the process of buying a 3.5 million dollar extra building; we employees had to fight tooth and nail for a 2% raise (under cost of living) while president & ceo maynard orme is given a six-digit salary with healthy 10% raise each year...  your $35 membership goes to pay management salaries ... and the news programming is as spicy as chalk these days... dumbed down so they can continue receiving corporate sponsorships... and the internal political fighting and mis-management!... just  don't give OPB money ... okay enough  later if I'm up for it, Dante's has the usual Wednesday with  urlLink  Storm & the Balls  ... but first(!) it's fun with devo-esque   urlLink The Punk Group  !  will be a late night, but oh so worth it!

      I have to admit, I enjoy a good political speech more than any sports event. I got pretty fired up over Kerry's acceptance speech last night. Amid sculpted-hair-helmets and sweat, Kerry delivered an incredible Clinton-esque speech.  Yes, selling personal integrity is something to bank on against the liars at Bushco.  The Saudi family reference received incredible applause - and I think, as much as people want to discount Michael Moore, we have him to thank for educating the general populace on that point.  And loved Kerry saying, "...it is time for those who talk about family values to start valuing families."  Beautiful!  He struck all the right chords, sprinkled in a few pointy fingers, and sold himself as a man with heart and conscience.  ...what was that comment about "hair pollution" in harlem?... likely more at the dem convention because of all the suit-wearing-men shellaked in hairspray...  I switched from abc to cbs... peter jennings gives me the heebie-jeebies with his tight-assed comments... makes me ask "WHAT liberal media?"... so I listened a little to Dan Rather... who, by the way, is a gas to watch on election night!... his southern quips are hilarious... would love to edit them all together in a montage  and who the heck is that new york times guy on pbs?  he is so fucking annoying!  however, the little squat guy with the glasses has a mind to contend with!  would love to discuss things with him over drinks.   urlLink    who seems more fun?  more human?  kerry's wife, or laura bush?  who would you hang out with?... definitely the woman who has the bust to tell some annoying person to "shove it"  and oh boy!... more bad music!... springsteen, journey, kool & the gang... ouch  of interest:    urlLink arianna huffington's blog      urlLink Sen.

Democratic National Convention...  by Barack Obama  The Nation's John Nichols called this speech "an exceptionally significant expression of the ever-evolving story of American citizenship and political engagement." Obama's speech introduced the themes that speakers since keep reinforcing: America can and should be a land of opportunity for all.  Too bad those of us who don't have cable television couldn't see it.   I haven't been following all of the  dem convention  because they're preaching to the choir here... and I get a little queasy over all the rhetoric and the  flags ...

I'm tired of protest being seen as "un-american" or "un-patriotic"... cushioning to get those swing voters... and those swing voters are needed!... it's baffling to me to see people supporting bushco... how can they not see what busco is doing to our planet, let alone our nation!... on november 3rd, regardless of who wins, we have a lot of work to do    urlLink electoral vote predictor    new   urlLink Get Your War On  ...

      happy friday all... weekend is finally here... and I've got quite the line-up of events!... sailing, party, condo shopping, cocktails,   urlLink gomez  , biz work, oh and this pesky day job... no time to waste today  &nbsp;   urlLink  life-size blow-up priest doll    &nbsp;  wearable subversion -  urlLink  Hey-Zues gets me hard    &nbsp;   urlLink  bush on crack    &nbsp;  do repub's really believe "Standing Tall for America" means firing your workers and moving their jobs to India?  &nbsp;  where's the toe?&nbsp; one of my&nbsp;fave sites,  urlLink  cameltoe.org   ("retro toe" section!), is featuring jenna bush on the home page... which is scary scary scary!...&nbsp;but I'm not seeing the toe... and considering who it is - the spawn of shrub - not sure I want to see it... eeeeoooo  &nbsp;  yeah,  martha stewart  will be&nbsp;nesting in the big house...&nbsp;during&nbsp;the court ordeal, I've had a bit of a problem with&nbsp;public reaction... the jokes on late night would bring about nasty applause...&nbsp;like a mass of people gathered around a guillotine, cheering&nbsp;for the blade to fall... kinda creepy... yeah, martha is annoying,&nbsp;doilies and all, but why is she so *hated*?... makes me wonder if it's the 'negative disease' that seems to afflict a majority of the american public... you know,&nbsp;those people who can't wait for someone to fail, derive joy from misery of others, call attention to human faults, and generally don't like it when&nbsp;one succeeds...&nbsp;come on,&nbsp;we all have a couple people like this in our lives... whether it's a parent, a friend, a co-worker, a neighbor... why is this&nbsp;behavior so rampant?... heck, I've fallen prey to it myself... derived from inner insecurities and fears...&nbsp;though, I've done work on myself... I now choose to derive joy in seeing others succeed... (truly laugh and cry when a retired janitor woman wins the lottery)... cheer people on to do better and to grow beyond what they already know... I cannot feed complainers anymore...&nbsp;"if you&nbsp;don't like it, then do something to change it -&nbsp;whether it's the situation or&nbsp;your attitude that needs changing"... so what, if martha may have been a bitch behind the scenes -&nbsp;did it really affect your life?&nbsp; no... so what, if martha had good business sense, and scratched her way&nbsp;up to a nice income?&nbsp; good for her!... so what, if she brought&nbsp;bored housewives many&nbsp;ways to pass their days?&nbsp;&nbsp;good for all of them!... why does the public so want to see&nbsp;martha fry?... I'm&nbsp;guessing it's the&nbsp;jealousy of someone else's (*seeming*)&nbsp;&nbsp;success, monetarily speaking... personally, I hope martha will learn from&nbsp;her mistake, and will come back bigger than ever  &nbsp;   urlLink  russian nesting dolls  ... these are a little strange... juxtaposition of cultures, or some shit like that... yet, I might, in the future, have some fun creating my own versions of this idea!  &nbsp;   urlLink  Buck Truck, The Rappin' Trucker    &nbsp;  highly recommended:  urlLink  "American Mullet: The Most Important Hair Documentary Ever Made"      &nbsp;  if everything goes as expected with crewing on paige's sailboat for this evening's race... hmm, let's see...&nbsp;if I leave work&nbsp;at 4pm, then I should be flailing/drowning in the river by 5:30pm or so... one arm will be heroically keeping my precious beer dry &amp; complete...

I'm leaving work early tomorrow to go out on Paige's boat.  Apparently there is something called a  "beer can" race  happening, and Paige doesn't have any crew for this event.  I warned her, I don't know a thingamabob from a doohickie, where sailing is concerned.  (Can big boobs act as floatation devices?)  She seems okay with my lack of experience.  Maybe I'll only need to hold down one side of the boat, with a heavy beer in hand.  There is a big party afterward... and hopefully lots of window shopping to do (cute sun-kissed boys, or crusty sailors?).  Then, staying the night at the "mansion" - paige is house sitting... the master shower has the unnecessary extravagance of 11 shower heads - you kinda get blasted from all sides - it's a little weird    then, get up the next morning to shop for condos... pick up  urlLink  these cute birkenstocks   (no really, they are cute, non-sasquatch)... then cocktails and  urlLink  gomez   in the evening!... sunday is work, work, work on my biz site  I made the best dinner last night... it was perfect... lemon garlic broiled salmon, crispy steamed asparagus, organically herbed jasmine rice...

According to White House sources, President George W. Bush laughed the matter off at a recent cabinet meeting.  "Fuck ‘em all," Bush said. [oh so eloquent]  The President’s bravado, however, is not shared by worried White House aides. Some point to the last vice president to step down because of fraud and corruption – Spiro T. Agnew, who served under President Richard M. Nixon, another Republican forced to leave office because of scandal. and check out the oh-so-attractive pic of Cheney... mouth open like the gaping wound of hell...

      This new take on the Declaration of Independence came out of a 4th July march around the square in Madison, Wisconsin.      A Declaration of Independence   From the Tyranny of the Usurper President, the current King George.  When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for a people to distance themselves from the political direction upon which their governmental leaders and supposed representatives have departed, a decent respect to the opinions of humankind requires that they should list the causes and chronicle the grievances that impel their dissent and demands for a new departure.  We hold these Truths to be self-evident, that all people are created Equal, that they are endowed with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.  That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted which derive their just powers from the consent of the governed, --That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their True Security.  Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience has taught us that a good part of humanity are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to take history into its own hands to change that to which they have grown accustomed.  But when a long train of Abuses and Usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is the People's right, their duty, to reject such Government, and to provide new safeguards for their future security. Regime change begins at home.  The agenda of the present Wannabe-King, the Un-elected and Appointed President, his coterie of Oil Company Advisors, Neo-Conservative Ideologues, aided and abetted by the Tory support within both dominant Parties, is a history of repeated Injuries and Usurpations, all having in direct object the abrogation of authentic democracy and the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over the People of this Land.  To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world.  Deceiving the People of this Land and their Representative Bodies as to the actual designs and real threats to their Well Being and Security, the President and Would-Be Tyrant King has taken this country to war in Iraq and elsewhere based on fabrication, misinformation and outright falsehood.  In pursuit of that War, a conflict waged primarily for imperial control of oil and corporate profit, he has placed large numbers of our country's Sons and Daughters in harm's way and caused death and injury not only to many of them but to countless other innocents across the Middle East and South Asia.  By immediately declaring a "War on Terror" and by pursuing an all-out military response to the Tragedy of September 11th in Afghanistan and then Iraq, He has utilized those events to forward an agenda of global conquest and control, long the objective of those who opportunistically advise him.  In pursuit of a Unilateral Foreign Policy based on "Preemptive Strike," He has served to alienate traditional allies, undermined international law, security and mediating bodies, and guaranteed a further proliferation of "Weapons of Mass Destruction" among those who now see themselves threatened.  He has knowingly abrogated international protection of Human Rights by willingly abandoning and disregarding the Geneva Conventions on the Conduct of War and the Treatment of Prisoners and the International Declaration of Human Rights.  He has promised to expand the War by pursuing a course of aggression against Syria, Iran and North Korea, while continuing to punish those countries such as Cuba and Venezuela that refuse to bow to the Neo-Liberal agenda of privatized benefit to the detriment of the popular classes.  While utilizing the rhetoric of "liberty," "freedom," and "democracy," He has bolstered the repressive and undemocratic regimes across the Middles East such as Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Egypt, Kuwait and the Emirates of the Persian Gulf. At the same time, He has continued unflinching military and economic support for Israel's continued war of destruction being waged against the Palestinian people's right to a homeland.  In the wake of September 11th and in pursuit of that Global Agenda, knowing full well that massive dissent to such foreign policies of conquest would arise, He and his Associates successfully utilized the Fear of "Terrorism" to intimidate opposition and win the passage of a so-called "Patriot Act" and Executive Orders curtailing the Constitutionally guaranteed Civil Liberties and Rights of the People.  He has violated the Constitution of the United Sates by denying the right of habeas corpus and by holding prisoners, among them citizens of Our Land, without charge.  He has increased the authority of police powers to intrude upon the daily lives of the People, to surveil and erode the rights of this Nation's citizenry, thereby calling into question the "loyalty" of those who protest by placing strictures on dissent.  In pursuit of said Global Agenda, beneficial primarily to the large Corporate Interests and the Very Wealthy and Powerful that stand behind him, He has passed the economic burden of War and pursuit of Empire onto the backs of the Working and Middle Classes while providing "Tax Breaks" to those most able to pay any price and bare any burden.  While calling upon the populace to "Support the Troops," he has cut benefits and funding for Veterans of previous wars, those who have already paid dearly.  In pursuit of those Private Benefits and the Material Gain of the Few, He has allowed the buildup of a huge domestic and foreign debt that has placed this Nation on a dangerous economic course guaranteeing a perilous future.  While forwarding a massive increase of military spending, He has  allowed pressing domestic social and infrastructural needs to go  unheeded and has overseen cuts in programs beneficial to those most vulnerable -- the poor, the elderly, the very young, and differently abled, - often disproportionately People of Color.  In pursuit of that same Private Gain, He and his Associates have  refused the warnings of the scientific community and abandoned attempts at protocols aimed at safeguarding the global environment. He has unleashed polluters and resource exploiters to more freely defile the air, water and land and accelerated degradation of the planet by resorting to war.  Beholden to the political agenda of the fundamentalist Christian Right, He has aided and abetted the assault on the Constitutional guarantee of Separation of Church and State.  In keeping with the fundamentalist theocratic agenda, He has endorsed a call for a Constitutional Amendment banning abortion, has undermined and "left behind" the democratic tradition of free and secular public education, and has assisted in the attack on the just entreaties for equal rights and treatment under the law put forward by our Gay and Lesbian communities.  A President whose character is thus marked by every act which may  define a Tyrant is unfit to be the leader of a Free People.  We, therefore, as citizens of this Country, freely assembled, do  solemnly publish and declare, that the People of this land of Right ought to be Free and Independent from the Tyranny of the Present Ruler, his Retinue, and any Successors of Whatever Party that would uphold the agenda, in sum or in part, of imperial adventure abroad to the abuse and neglect of the safety and well-being of the People at home.  In closing, we remind those who would aspire to the highest offices in the land, those entrusted with the Power to levy War, conclude Peace, contract Alliances, establish Commerce, and to do all other Acts and Things which Independent States may of right do, that the authority to do such resides in the Sovereignty of the People;  That said Sovereignty, the very heart of any True Democracy, its  Freedom and Liberty, cannot be circumvented without incurring the wrath and reproach of a Free People.  We hereby call upon all fellow upholders of True Freedom and Authentic Liberty to join in bringing an end to Tyranny and the Usurpation of that Authority granted by a Sovereign People.  In support of this Declaration, we the undersigned affix our names in commemoration of the Right and Just values upon which this Democratic Republic was founded.

      "Trying to eliminate Saddam...would have incurred incalculable human and political costs. Apprehending him was probably impossible.... We would have been forced to occupy Baghdad and, in effect, rule Iraq....There was no viable "exit strategy" we could see, violating another of our principles. Furthermore, we had been consciously trying to set a pattern for handling aggression in the post-Cold War world. Going in and occupying Iraq, thus unilaterally exceeding the United Nations' mandate, would have destroyed the precedent of international response to aggression that we hoped to establish. Had we gone the invasion route, the United States could conceivably still be an occupying power in a bitterly hostile land."  If only his son could read.

      giving two clues for guys on first dates:   don't douse yourself in cologne   ask your date about his/herself... take some interest... it'll make your date feel good... it's okay to want to be understood by another... just don't talk incessantly about yourself  I survived date with handsome armenian man... it was neat to talk cultural differences... but he's so old school!... I got creeped out when he started discussing his views on women... he's christian (and I respect that) but he truly believes it when the bible states (something like) "man answers to god; woman answers to man"... he grew up in a muslim part of southern russia where the women cover up, could not own property, could not vote, could not be educated "but they were treated really really well"... he said his ex-wife thought he was controlling... go figger... "if she would just talk to me, give me a kiss and that woman smile, she could've gotten what she wanted"... what - instead of being an equal respected person on a two-person team, able to make a decision on her own?... so she must suck up to some guy to get permission??... and he eluded to sexual assault was understandably provoked by women acting sexually (oh so wrong!)... he doesn't know how he'll vote in november: he subtly shut me down when I started talking politics... me!... uh: ya think that was that because I'm a woman?? ...big grrr  oh - after we ate, he was talking, and big chunks of food kept flying out of his mouth, travelling along big arcs through the air, most of them hitting me... ew... I was subtly playing 'dodge the chunks' while nodding politely at things  any fully-realized woman would find offensive ...   I've given it considerable thought and calmed down - no worries, dear ones - he will hear the *what is* from lisa  thank gawd (oh wait, I'm a woman, I'm not good enough to speak to god), russ called me as I got to my car... drove to holman's to meet he and alan for fun and banter and pbr

Check out Mini-Kiss, "the officially-sanctioned midget KISS tribute band," We Got The Meat, "the all-male Go-Go's tribute band in drag," and The Misfats, "the world's fattest Misfits tribute band." If you couldn't guess, this show is sponsored by Hair Force One (a Flügtag team) & Red Bull. Freaks run with freaks. by the end we were all pretty schnockered... oh crap, I gave my number to that shaved head guy too... ah well, doubt he has balls to call... I want andy to call me!!... for consolation, I'm going out to lunch with the handsome armenian cab driver from that evening... sweet, respectful man... ah, fresh air... and a new friend   urlLink  Sullen, Depressed President Retreats Into Private, Paranoid World    saturday, I'm meeting up with  urlLink  ACT   to begin voluteering again... still unable to massive footwork, but I can certainly help in other ways!...  please vote dammit ... especially you women... Remember how women got the vote...  The women were innocent and defenseless. And by the end of the night, they were barely alive.  Forty prison guards wielding clubs and their warden's blessing went on a rampage against the 33 helpless women wrongly convicted of "obstructing sidewalk traffic." They beat Lucy Burn, chained her hands to the cell bars above her head and left her hanging for the night, bleeding and gasping for air. They hurled Dora Lewis into a dark cell, smashed her head against an iron bed and knocked her out cold. Her cellmate, Alice Cosu, thought Lewis was dead and suffered a heart attack.  Additional affidavits describe the guards grabbing, dragging, beating, choking, slamming, pinching, twisting and kicking the women. Thus unfolded the "Night of Terror" on Nov. 15, 1917, when the warden at the Occoquan Workhouse in Virginia ordered his guards to teach a lesson to the suffragists imprisoned there because they dared to picket Woodrow Wilson's White House for the right to vote. For weeks, the women's only water came from an open pail. Their food--all of it colorless slops--was infested with worms. When one of the leaders, Alice Paul, embarked on a hunger strike, they tied her to a chair, forced a tube down her throat and poured liquid into her until she vomited. She was tortured like this for weeks until word was smuggled out to the press.  So, refresh my memory. Some women won't vote this year because--why, exactly? We have carpool duties? We have to get to work? Our vote doesn't matter? It's raining? Last week, I went to a sparsely attended screening of  urlLink  HBO's new movie "Iron Jawed Angels."   It is a graphic depiction of the battle these women waged so that I could pull the curtain at the polling booth and have my say. I am ashamed to say I needed the reminder. There was a time when I knew these women well. I met them in college--not in my required American history courses, which barely mentioned them, but in women's history class. That's where I found the irrepressibly brave Alice Paul. Her large, brooding eyes seemed fixed on my own as she stared out from the page.  "Remember!" she silently beckoned.  All these years later, voter registration is still my passion. But the actual act of voting had become less personal for me, more rote. Frankly, voting often felt more like an obligation than a privilege. Sometimes, it was even inconvenient. My friend Wendy, who is my age and studied women's history, saw the HBO movie, too. When she stopped by my desk to talk about it, she looked angry. She was. With herself. "One thought kept coming back to me as I watched that movie," she said. "What would those women think of the way I use--or don't use--my right to vote?  All of us take it for granted now, not just younger women, but those of us who did seek to learn." The right to vote, she said, had become valuable to her "all over again."  HBO will run the movie periodically before releasing it on video and DVD. I wish all history, social studies and government teachers would include the movie in their curriculum. I want it shown on Bunko night, too, and anywhere else women gather. I realize this isn't our usual idea of socializing, but we are not voting in the numbers that we should be, and I think a little shock therapy is in order.  It is jarring to watch Woodrow Wilson and his cronies try to persuade a psychiatrist to declare Alice Paul insane so that she could be permanently institutionalized. And it is inspiring to watch the doctor refuse. Alice Paul was strong, he said, and brave. That didn't make her crazy. The Doctor admonished the men: "Courage in women is often mistaken for insanity." forwarded to me by my beautiful, strong, finnish, women relatives... ya wonder where I get it from?... sisu, babee  sold the   urlLink mercury  !...  beautiful car, I will miss you dearly...
