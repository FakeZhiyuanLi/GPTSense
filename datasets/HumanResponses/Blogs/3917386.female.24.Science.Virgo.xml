      Well, Chad, Moh, Mom and I are already to get up and leave in the morning.&nbsp; This will be my last post for a while until Chad and I get settled in and have internet at the house.&nbsp; Once I am a bit unpacked and have time I'll let everyone know about the move and everything!   At this time tomorrow I will be a homeowner spending my first night in Kansas in my new home!   &nbsp;

      Man oh Man.&nbsp; Last night Chad rolled into town with the Uhaul around 10pm.&nbsp; And well he started uloading his stuff in order to reorganize it and started to pack things up from the garage.&nbsp; At first we were like no way in hell all of this stuff will fit into that van... but Chad the amazing packer (Dad would be so proud!) managed to get almost everything into the thing!&nbsp; A couple of Christmas bins and I think some sports equipment didn't fit.&nbsp; And of course the futon needed to be retired... it just didn't fit in the van, and if we would have put it in there we wouldn't have had room for all the shopsmith stuff... but Mohriah fell in love with the futon mattress... so Mohriah has&nbsp;new a dog bed - and well it's the largest dog bed ever, but she was too cute to say no to her, and the thing fit into the Uhaul.&nbsp; We finished up packing around 2:30am.&nbsp; It only took us 4 hours, yea only!&nbsp;Even though I was draggin ass at midnight because I was tired, I'm glad we got it done last night because it was cool.&nbsp; It's&nbsp; 10am right now and it's already 80 degrees! And now tonight Mom, Chad and I only have to pack up Mom's car... not too shabby!

      Well, today was my last day working at Nahant Marsh.&nbsp; Jody and I had 2 groups of kids from Davenport Central/Sudlow Jr. High Summer School program out and overall they weren't too bad.&nbsp; It was pretty funny when the girls screamed bloody murder when they saw a garter snake and again when a northern leopard frog jumped in front of them. But the best was a locust bug Jody was showing them on a leaf who decided to get up and fly... and goodness gracious you'd think there was a bomb going off or something!&nbsp; 1/2 the kids ducked and covered their heads... even the guys were screaming. Jody and I just busted out laughing.&nbsp; City kids - gotta love em! After the groups left I cleared off my desk and took out the fox snake for one last time... I wish I could have taken him home with me. He is such a sweetie.&nbsp; Then after that, I had to say goodbye to Jody my boss/coworker/friend.&nbsp; That was pretty hard.&nbsp; I enjoyed working with her, hell half the time it was more fun then work!&nbsp; This year at Nahant was a lot of&nbsp;fun and I learned a lot of new stuff about teaching and what I can and cannot do.&nbsp; I had challenges, but they were good challenges, and I am going to miss the job...

      Well not much say about today, but I'm bored and can't sleep so I decided to post.&nbsp; Today I had my second to last day of work at Nahant Marsh Educational Center and my boss, Jody almost started to cry when I gave her a thank you gift for everything she has done for me this year.&nbsp; I'm definitely going to miss her when I move... she was a cool boss and a friend.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I just can't believe that I will be moving this friday to Kansas.&nbsp; Kind of scary, but I'm getting anxious... can't wait to own my own home!&nbsp;   Tonight Mom took me to Olive Garden for my last dinner at home thing.&nbsp; I ate too much.. ufta!&nbsp; After that we went to Sears to look at lawn mowers.&nbsp; I'll have to buy one of those once I move.&nbsp; Another expense!&nbsp; At least I had some good news about the whole money issue for August... my Americorps contract ends in September, so the guy is going to give me the remaining paychecks in one lump sum on my next paycheck- which is Monday!&nbsp; That should be enough to get through August and beginning of September... that made me feel less nervous on being broke when I move:)

      Last night Chad, Mom and I went out to the Roe's for my last popcorn and movie... it was kinda sad... I am sure going to miss going out there:)&nbsp; The Roe's are a second family to me.&nbsp;   Bob gave Chad and I a Shopsmith 101 lesson.... then showed us the missing pieces to mine.&nbsp; When Chad and I got home we looked for the pieces... and behold I found the missing pieces plus more attachments!&nbsp; Man, Dad had a lot of toys for that thing!&nbsp; After finding the pieces neither of us were tired so we stayed up cleaning the shop&nbsp;til 2am!&nbsp; Mom now has empty file drawers, shelves and you can walk around the entire shop without hitting your knee or head on something!&nbsp; We were going to vaccuum it out, but I don't think Mom would have appreciated waking up to that noise at 2am - even though we were pretty noisy with the falling lumber and all:)&nbsp;   Well, I found my Dad's heat gun, so I am going to go attempt to take the paint off of one of my chairs.... see if it works:)

      Sorry I haven't posted a blog for awhile, been busy packing and stuff.&nbsp; Last night was my graduation and going away party.&nbsp; I had a decent crowd and I got to see some people I haven't seen for awhile.&nbsp; And I got to enroll some of the manly men to help carry stuff from the basement to the garage!&nbsp; Thanks Matt (Keri's special friend) hehehe.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I also got some pretty cool gifts from people too:)&nbsp; Thanks so much!  I still can't believe Chad and I will be moving in less than a week!&nbsp; Kinda crazy and scary.&nbsp; I still can't believe how much crap I have in the garage... I sure hope the Uhaul will hold it all:)  &nbsp;

      Yesterday was my thesis defense and oral exams for my Masters at Western Illinois University.&nbsp; It wasn't too bad.&nbsp; The test started about 10 minutes late... They asked me about my biology career and where I was going to go from here.&nbsp; Then they started to ask me questions about my thesis.&nbsp; Most of the questions were circular.&nbsp; I thought I answered something then the followup question was similar to the first!&nbsp; It was a bit nerve racking.&nbsp; For the last hour I had qusetions about biology.&nbsp; I got most of the&nbsp;questions or at least got to the answer some how!&nbsp; Most of what I studied wasn't asked but oh well!&nbsp; One of the committee members kept asking me about animals and invertebrates - and well, I'm a botanist!&nbsp; One of the questions was "What is your favorite biome? and what are 5 animal phyla that would be found there!"&nbsp; If it was plants that would be easy, but i managed to get all 5 phyla some how:)&nbsp; Then I had some questions on photosynthesis, which i knew was going to happen, and afterwards the teacher told me that i went above and beyond anyone she has seen discuss photosynthesis!&nbsp; that made me feel good:)&nbsp; Then i also had an answer right about the nucleus, but one prof was like no that is wrong... then we looked it up afterwards - and I was right!&nbsp;&nbsp; Another prof put 16 things up on the board and I had to list them from most complex to simplest... these ranged from protons to planets!&nbsp; It was crazy... then we went through everyone and had to explain why I listed them that way.... overall he said he could i was a biologist and especially an ecologist based on how i numbered them.&nbsp; it was a strange exercise because some of the things could be looked at in different ways!  &nbsp; Overall, it wasn't as bad as I thought it was going to be, but it was the longest 1 hour and 50 minutes of my life!&nbsp; After the test I had to go spend $40 to get the copies of my thesis bound at the library.&nbsp; So, yea, I am done with Western!&nbsp; Now onto K-State!&nbsp;

      Yesterday Chad &amp; I went to see the IMAX film Nascar 3-D.&nbsp; It was pretty cool... IMAX movies are so nifty because it feels like you are really there and the 3-D only makes the experience even cooler!&nbsp; Afterwards my eyes hurt a bit from wearing the 3-D goggles, but hey it was worth it.&nbsp; During the movie it felt like you were in the car going 180 mph or you were right there in the pit crew!&nbsp; &nbsp; After the movie, Chad had to head back to Macomb to go to a hog roast, and I went to the Steamwheelers arena football game with&nbsp;Mom, Aunt Colette, Uncle Joe, Andrew and a whole slough of other family members.&nbsp; The Steamwheelers beat the Birmingham team 56-15... it was awesome!&nbsp; One of the Birmingham team members got tackled and he went head over heels over the announcer table!&nbsp; it was crazy!&nbsp; It was pretty cool watching the game because the field is only 50 yards long and you can play the ball of the walls in the end zone.&nbsp; A lot of turnovers happened which led to the Steamwheelers to score touch downs!&nbsp;

      Yesterday was my boyfriend Chad's 29th birthday!&nbsp; The day before his birthday my friend Seth from Muscatine came up and we all went to Michael's Sports World to climb their rotating climbing wall. It was fun.&nbsp; The owner was like if any of you can do the most advanced climb without falling off you get a free pop... so of course Seth and Chad tried, but alas, both failed.&nbsp; Chad was close but when he jumped for a hand hold he lost grip and fell.&nbsp; It was amusing:)&nbsp; Afterwards we went to Borders to have coffee and chill.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was&nbsp; fun, yet cheap entertainment for me! &nbsp; Yesterday, I had to work in then morning, but in the&nbsp; afternoon Chad and I headed up to Savanna IL to go rock climbing at the Palisades State Park.&nbsp; It was sooo cool.&nbsp; I almost got to the top of the climb we were doing, but i got scared because the climb was slightly inclined, and well i am a big weeney right now and don't have the upper body strength to do it.&nbsp; So, the rest of the afternoon I belayed Chad while he was a monkey on the wall.&nbsp; He tried to climb the wall next to the cliff I had climbed, but the anchor points weren't set up for it so he decided to leap from wall to the other wall (like Spiderman), he did it, and pulled me off the ground (thank goodness i was tied down to something)!&nbsp; But when he landed he hit his foot pretty hard (climbing shoes don't have the worlds best support). He was okay, but he had to limp the rest of the day:) &nbsp; We ended the night by rolling my desk down the street on a two wheeled cart because i sold it to a neighbor and it was probably comical....&nbsp; "Game Off" when cars went by and "Game On" when the road was clear... then of course my dog wanted to tag along.&nbsp; It was silly, but I got $40!&nbsp;&nbsp; After that we ordered Chinese and watched A Man Apart with Vin Diesel, which was a slightly confusing movie.. not sure what to think about it.

      Well last night my little iguana guy found a new home.  The couple were estatic to get him... they already have 3 other iguanas... a 9,7,and 5 year old.  They are their children.  She said they have run of the house and there is a lot of stuff for them to climb on and bask in, and eat.  And they are all potty trained to go in a cat box!  So I know Tae Tae will have a good home with friends!  They took Tae Tae last night and coming back on Friday to pick up the cage!  I'm glad he found a new home, but part of me is a little sad, but he'll be happier now:)  I'm just glad I had him out yesterday during the day for one last time because they came and picked up him when I was gone:( He was a cutey, but alas, he is in a better place - an iguana haven!

      Well, today was my last day to work at North Scott Fitness. It was kind of sad, and now Tara has no one to call when she wants a day off... who else would want to go to work at 4:45am!  hehehe. Sorry, Tara, I won't miss waking up at 4:30!  hehehe  I had some laughs with the members and I certainly won't forget many of them!  It was a fun job to have to pick up some extra money here and there, and now I have to say goodbye to it....

      My little iguana needs new to find a new home before I move. I think it would be too hard to move him and his cage with me.  He's a cool little guy, but I think it would be best if he found a home back here.  So if you know anyone who is interested here are the details:  He's a juvenile iguana about 1 year old, approximately 18-20 inches currently.  The cage is roughly 4 x 4 x 3 feet and it was built in order to break apart for easy transport.  The cage is made of wood, showerboard and hardware cloth.  It has 3 shelves for Tae to bask and climb on. Along with Tae and the cage (no lights, plants or watering hole included)I would also throw in a near full jar of Iguana food, calcium powder supplement and a how to take care of iguana book for $50.  If you know someone who just wants an iguana, I'll be willing to part with tae, the food, powder and book for $25, or make an offer:)  I just want him to find a good home before i move.  He deserves it!

      Just letting everyone know that I will be having a Graduation/Moving Party at my house on Saturday July 24th at 6:30pm to whenever.  There will be food and what not to enjoy and afterwards I wouldn't mind going out one last time in the QCA before I move on the 30th to Kansas!  So if you can make it that would be super duper!  I would like to see everyone before I move.  Chad, Mohriah, our parents, and I are taking off on the 30th to reach the final destination of 306 Ash, Wamego KS.  Dorothy and Toto here we come!

      Well, yesterday I had orientation ALL day... it was almost as fun as a barrel of monkeys.  It started at 7:30 am, had a break at 10, then went til 12:30... they didn't even serve any treats - only coffee and lemonade, and the room was like a 100 degrees.  I left at 12:30 because I needed to get out of there, but the speaker was still babbling on about the history of the library... blah blah blah.  There was about 100 new grad students to campus all sitting in this room listening to BORING power point presentations on how to survive as grad student.  I didn't learn anything new.  Then after the general orientation I had to head over to the biology orientation... Thank goodness that one ended sooner then anticipated!  Today I have the library orientation, so that one should be useful so I know where to go to find journal articles!  And tomorrow classes start!

      Today Chad and I went to Rock City to do some bouldering.  This place was so neat... it looked like a giant decided to throw rounded boulders into a field.  These big round sandrock formations are called concretions.  Some were easy to climb others were about 10-12 feet high so it took some muscle to get up and over the sphere shape.  They were neato.  We spent about 2.5 hours messin around on the boulders working on technique and what not.  I just wish this place was closer to home... it's out west near Salina... about 1.5 hours away.  It was worth the trip though... we got out of the house and did something besides home repair!   Here is a link to Rock City:   urlLink http://www.washburn.edu/cas/art/cyoho/archive/KStravel/rockcity/

      Well, the kitchen is almost done!  2 gallons of paint, a bucket of mud and some man power the place is coming together quite nicely!  This  weekend Chad and I really dived into the mess.  Chad measured the piece to go into the hole wrong... so it's a bit short, so we still need to get some base board to cover it up, which i wanted to do anyways, because the stuff in the kitchen is made out of paneling and doesn't look too good.  Other than that Chad did an excellent job with the patch job... before we painted the wall with the mud work felt like paper!  it was sooo smooth!  except for the 4 inch space at the bottom i can't tell where the door was!  yea!  now we just have  big blue wall that definitely needs some homey touches to it to break up the color!  Yesterday Chad spent practically the entire day doing plumbing work... attempting to install new shower fixtures so the drip drip would come to a stop.  He was crammed behind the stove and the wall in the kitchen for the most of the day working on it....No matter what he always had a leak somewhere int he piping... i think it comes from the fact our water pressure is too high... i think we'll have to buy a valve to help that out... but in the end he finally got it and now the shower looks better, doesn't leak and the tub faucet works!  When he was working and getting cranky with plumbing I spent the day outside sanding down the nasty painted wood door frame to the kitchen... and now the wood is cool looking... it's a bit beat up looking but with a new coat of stain the wood now has a character!  I can't wait til all of the trim and doors are down, but that'll be awhile!  One room at at a time!

      Last night Chad and I decided to drive to Topeka to see how long it would take us to get there.  We took Highway 24 (it goes all the way to Mt. Sterling IL!) and we hit the outskirts of Topeka in about 30 minutes, and hit the downtown and capitol area in 45 minutes.  We jumped onto 470 and then I-70 back to Wamego... and that only took 35 minutes!  So at least if we want to go there for any reason we know how long it'll take!  When we got home I realized I hadn't done anything on the house all day I better get crackin on something because classes start next week!  So I decided to explore what was behind the hideous red and black brick paneling in the kitchen, considering it was only be held up with a few screws.  On one wall there was blue floral wall paper... that kinda went around the entire room in places.   I decided to pull it up and found out it was contact paper!  It came up like a big sticker and to my delight there was another layer of a different blue floral contact paper "wallpaper" under it too.  So I got that all pulled up and there was the brown paneling which is the theme of this house I think.   On the one wall where there is nothing there, well I found out why... I took down the paneling and lo and behold I was looking into my bathroom throw the "built in shelving unit"!  Well the built in was just an old doorway that they didn't drywall over and just threw up a piece of brick paneling to cover the hole... so the kitchen had brick and the bathroom just had the other side of the paneling painted green.  I just started to laugh... Chad came over and was like oh my goodness...why didn't they drywall over that when they redid the bathroom????  So today he is going to cut down the brick paneling to fit inside the hole and just have the brick facing into the bathroom and the otherside facing out into the kitchen and we'll patch and paint over it when we have money.  Other than that there was really no other big surprises behind the paneling... Thank goodness!

      Well 2 nights ago we finally had rain and a lot of it along with wind wind and some more wind!  We lost 2 branches out of the walnut tree along with our cable hook-up, but considering we don't have cable we aren't too worried.  So yesterday while I was on campus getting ready for classes, Chad spent the day picking the branches and the 8 million walnuts that came with them!   I also went by the garden center and picked up this cool looking grass that Wamego has all over in the downtown planters... It's called purple fountain grass.  It's purple and the seed heads are really feathery looking:)  We planted them on the SE corner of the house in the flower bed.   Otherwise nothing too exciting going on.  Have to go back to campus to finish up my paperwork and pick up my building keys and then I'll be back home finding something to do!

      Man yesterday the only thing I did was clean or was scraping off old paint on the wood decor at the house.  I cleaned the windows... they were a pain!  The window in the dining room is nasty, but I can't clean it yet because the A/C is mounted in it and there is a family of wasps living in it!  The window is so nasty and I wish I didn't know why.... wasp poop!  it's gross!  The other windows look a ton better, but it's the old wavy glass so you still can't see out them that well.  Some still look dirty but they are 8 million times better then they were!  I also worked on scraping the paint off in the dining room and kitchen door frame... there were 8 layers of paint!  3 shades of green, 2 shades of yellow, white, brown and blue!  the wood looks so much better now that it is buried in layers of nasty paint.  The bottom brown layer i think might be stain because it didn't come up with the heat gun, but if i have to paint it at least now the paint will look decent now that there won't be layers and layers of paint under it.   And i think the people that painted here didn't know how to!  There is over painting all over and runs and unevenness.... not fun!  Well I think Chad and I are going to head west today to do some bouldering at Rock City, north of Salina KS.   Hopefully it'll be cool... not much rock climbing around here.

      Last night Chad and I went to the Pottawomanie County Fair and Rodeo.  The fair was pretty sad compared to the Mississippi Valley Fair from back home, but the rodeo was pretty neat.  I think the cutest was having little kids (4-7yrs old) ride sheep like a bull... it was soo funnny!  And they also had mini bull riding for kids 8-13 years old... and just because they were mini didn't mean they were easy to ride... only one kid actually stayed on for the entire 8 seconds... they bucked just like the big ones do.  The barrel racers were pretty neat too.  The bull riding was a bit sad for the human side... no one could stay on a bull for longer than like 4 seconds... so the bulls one all races:)  Some  of those bulls were huge and mean looking!  Well anyways, I have some cleaning to do... laters:)

      Well, where to start?! Chad, Mohriah and I have been busy! We are all unpacked and have started to work on the house! We have already started to strip all the old woodwork... nasty paint... why would anyone want to paint over beautiful wood doors and baseboards??? and there is like 4-5 layers of it! we are using a heat gun, but the fumes get nasty... does anyone have any other ideas? We have also spent a day working on the yard. I weeded our brick side walk.. that took 7-8 hours.. but it looks soooo much better. Chad took down some small trees, weeded around the house and found a flower bed we didnt' know we had! And he got poison ivy on top of it! Poor guy:( Yesterday we took down the nasty fall mural wallpaper in the dining room... it looks so much better with a white wall! Today we are going to take it a bit easier because tonight we are going to a rodeo! My first!  We had some bad news though. We have to replace the roof within 60 days or my home insurance will be dropped. So now we have to save our pennies... We priced materials (roof, fascia and soffit, and a new porch) and labor (Chad's friend) and it's going to be around $2000. Ouch! but it needs to be done. Chad wants to slap the carpenter who built the porch and did the roof... it's bad...i can tell it's bad so you know it's gotta be! Jayme will be coming out in September, so we have a month to start saving for the roof.  Once I get my camera photos downloaded I'll post them for all to see. The house isn't as bad as I remembered it.... not bad at all:)
