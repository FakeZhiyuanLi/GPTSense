      I have this bad habit of only praying so hard when I need to ask a favor from Him. So last night, I prayed hard (well it is a combination of talking, telling stories, self realization, and praying). In doing so I was able to look and analyze all the things that are currently happening to me, my family and my close friends, and the situations that we are all in. I prayed harder and I realized that all these things that are happening are also my omens (whether intentional or non-intentional). I am not saying that it all happened just for me, I am not that self-centered! What I am saying is that, looking at all the things that are happening, it had made me realize one thing: to always be prepared.  And, just like a sign from God, the power turned off for 3 seconds and was back on again. And being my chicken-shit scared self, I rushed to find my phone because darn I am soooooooo afraid of the dark!  The power went back on and I am so glad. More glad that I think I got what He wanted to tell me. I am such a lucky girl.

      I don't think I will ever be rich (but I won't be poor too I swear!). A lot of times I ask myself what would really make me happy -- be free from debts and be financially stable, be in a position where I could help family and friends, be in a position so that I could travel and enjoy life -- BUT WAIT, doesn't that mean I have to be rich to do all that??!  When I say rich I meant someone who's really rich. What I wanted is to just be in a good financial position. But I can never say anything final -- because a person is never contented. Perhaps when I reach that point, I would want more, and fail to see that it is what I wanted before.  And that will be the day when I look back and re-read this blog.

      I can only imagine how super worried a mother would feel if her son/daughter would be sick and away from her. I don't think it would be easy to be a mother in the future! Just recently, my "girlfriend" in Taiwan got sick and I was soooo worried about her I think I got sick too hahaha (just kidding, I think I got the flu from my Ninang whom I recently visited who's also been recently down with the flu). But yeah I can only think of how much worse a mother would feel if she learns one of her children is sick. I remember when I was still living at the business district away from my family, I would not tell my mom whenever I got fever or flu, because I know that she would get so worried and would just ask me to come back home.

      At about 12 hours ago, I was so happy to finally talk again to my sweetie-pie. She said something about how things are naturally falling into their places, that perhaps things were happening as they were supposed to happen.  "Maktub" (yes from that book "The Alchemist") -- "It is written".  Perhaps things are happening the way they are supposed to happen -- like how slow the HK company was in getting me here (and so I still have time to: 1. Earn more money 2. Visit 美雪 in Taiwan first before going to HK! 3. Learn more things like how naturally bad people are so I don't just trust and be extra nice to strangers and be abused by co-workers in HK.  Perhaps the reason why I could not find my passport earlier before going to HK for that interview is because something bad would have happened if I had left earlier.  I had this feeling, maybe since I was 14 or 16, that probably everything has been written already. Sometimes I get strong feelings that things would happen like how I feel they would happen. And even the real bad thing that happened to me, perhaps it was meant to happen to me. It is creepy but the good thing is that we don't know what was written and what is going to happen next. Perhaps this would explain ESP, fortune telling, etc, etc, etc. Because everything is already written. And when I say "written" it goes beyond our basic comprehension of the word "written". I do not know exactly how it is "written" but all I know is that it is "written", and being written as we live what has been "written" (awww golly chicken and egg problem).  And, it is written too that I should go to sleep now. ;p   ===== Chinese notes:  它被寫 (ta bei4 xie3)  "It is written"  我有這種感覺 (wo3 you3 zhe4 zhong3 gan3 jue2)  "I have this feeling"  我現在應該去睡覺 (wo3 xian4zai4 ying1gai1 qu4 shui4jiao4) "I now ought to go (to) sleep"  雞和蛋問題 (ji1 he2 dan4 wen4ti) "Chicken and Egg problem"  原因 (yuan2yin1)  (The) Reason  並且原因是您 (bing4 qie3 yuan2yin1 shi4 ni) "and the reason is you" (hihihi)

      I have this special talent of being able to play and really get along with kids. Kids from 3 years and up are some of the people that I get along really well ;p Perhaps because I am also such a kiddo myself! I enjoy talking to them and seeing how they think, how they act and react, and it makes me happy. I play with them well too. The things I do (play dead, act like a kid) they really appreciate and they are able to approach me and talk to me.  Just like today, my godson (is this the correct term?), 3 years old, and his brother (2 years) spent the whole afternoon at our house playing with me. They are so fun to be with and play with!  I think that it is good for me to have a "kid-therapy" from time to time (that is, play with kids).

      On becoming a real better person... today, I: 1. Lessened my softdrinks consumption to 50%, will totally remove my softdrink habit soon! 2. Will TRY to sleep (not later than 3am!) and wake up earlier (not later than 10am!). 3. Will abstain "it" for 10 days (oh man I might break my vow!).  Today, I, Shushi, also known as Aimeishu, pledge to do my best to keep the above vows. As this blog and myself are my witnesses.. "So help me BLOG"!

      “你是什么你买”(You are what you buy) If this is true then I wonder what these movies which I bought today would say about me:  一。 KISSING JESSICA STEIN  Well I already watched and loved this (谢谢美雪！) but since the VCD is on sale I thought I would buy a copy to support the movie  二。 40 DAYS, 40 NIGHTS  I don't think I can even do a 40 day abstinence from M! ;p  三。 ANGER MANAGEMENT  Is there a love story in here, somewhere?   Generally I just want to watch 2 kinds of movies lately:  1. Movies that won't make me think;  2. Modern love story movies;  3. Movies of Shu Qi.   ===     DREAM JOURNAL: I dreamt of Gem    For some odd reason, last night, I dreamt of Gem! The setting was here in my house. We WERE making out and we were just worried that my parents and brothers would be home so we thought of making out in the bathroom (which is odd because when I dreamt of Brian, we thought of making out in a public comfort room). What is the significance of the bathroom? I have to look this up in my dream interpretation book later (I am just too lazy to go up and get the book now). What happened was we were making out and then we thought of doing it in the bathroom but changed our minds so we're just at the living room then after a few minutes my brothers came home so we have to stop doing it and I was hoping my brothers would not see all the saliva that was in my face and mostly neck! ;p

      I don't even know if that is the correct term, but what I mean is to be super-concentrated on your thoughts, your actions, your feelings, on your self(ish). Is there a thing such as being too self-absorbed? Hehe. Yes-- proof? This blog.  I would like to think that this self-absorption is something positive. Because I want to be better!    Realization #1:   Emotions, Self-absorption: My 2nd to the last priority  Hard to believe, even myself refuses to believe, but its true! For the past months I was not able to whine and be super-emotional and think about my whims because I have been very preoccupied with LOOKING FOR MONEY and other things. Not that I have money now, but for the first time I have not had a problem with cash flow, which is probably why I am taking the liberty to think about a lot of other things. For the first time I feel in control of my (quasi-work) schedule. So when financial and work stuff have been squared off, I start to whine.   Realization #2:   This is the year when the bad apples fall off  I have been starting to lose friends, or rather I have been starting to lose them. Well they are not my friends friends (or real friends), As DJ said... the bad apples are starting to fall off from the tree, so its probably a good thing. I am starting to be critical with people... I don't know if this is good or bad, maybe I just have to not overdo it. For 24 years I have always thought the best about people. But now I think that has changed.   Realization #3:   I am changing... I think.  And I hope that it is for the better. I fear that I might mutate into something unfathomable.  ===  I finished The Alchemist last night. The line that for me is the most memorable is the one that goes like.. "when one loves, he/she strives to become a better person". I have constantly loved -- family, friends, friends that I love more -- I hope they are counted otherwise poor me! hehehe. What if my personal legend is to only love but not be loved back? Awww that's stupidly tragic but what if that is the case?  ===  Someone close to me asked me a few days ago what my fantasies are. Ooooopps I was definitely caught by surprise, even if I had already told that person almost 99% about myself there are just some things that are very hard to share (so I guess I am not that share-able then!). But its mostly because I have weird, horrible, and terrible fantasies. Not being specific about it, here's the demographics of my fantasy bank:  50% - Older men 15% - Men I find sexy, not necessarily good-looking 10% - Women who would be kinky to get into bed with 10% - Women who would be impossible to get to bed with 15% - Etcetera; random; can't think of a specific genre  There are so many times when I could not get a specific fantasy straight from start to end that is why what happens is I'd have a random flash of various people from my fantasy bank.  Now I have to take a cold shower.

      Here is yet another post in english. (这儿是一个英语blog post.)  I had the longest dream about j00nB0y! The setting of the dream was the GB3 area and that the date was August 2004 -- and that at one point in my dream I actually told him that I am just dreaming because it is not currently August 2004 but December 2004 (I am such a wacko, it is currently June 2004!).  I could not remember the sequential story order of the dream but here are some scenes that I remember:   一。 He was crying and he ran after me from GB2 to GB3 and he told me that he misses me and that he was sorry for what has happened (DUH!!! This is the last thing that he will do in real life!).  二。 We were riding a tricycle and I was holding his hand inside the tricycle but he was so cold (what do I expect?!).  三。 There was this weird scene (I think this came right after scene #1), that he was telling me about his feelings and then I told him that "no, this can't be, do you know that this is just a dream?". He looked a bit baffled and then he asked why. I said because look in this setting it is currently August 2004, but in real life, it is December 2004 (I guess I am also looney with the date but I am very sure that it was just a dream!). Then after this weird scene I think I also forgot again that it was just a dream.  It was a long dream but for the life of me I could not remember any other details except that I was with him and that we were together either walking, talking or riding a vehicle.  ===  I think I know why I dreamt of him: His birthday is nearing, a cousin mentioned the name of his grand mother going to our house for the Christening of my cousin's son (they celebrated it at our house), and, I looked at his blog again for the first time after 4 months [Sweetie-pie: This is not intentional, I just remembered his blog after I viewed yours, because..(sigh) you both write well and so after reading your blog I remembered him and took a pee, erhm, peek, at his blog].  No, I do not have feelings for him anymore (I think!). It just baffles me how someone, like myself, can feel so strongly for someone who obviously does not feel even at least 25% of what I am feeling. Well this has happened a lot of times before with various boys/girls but sans the cosmic bullshit that was only felt with him. My relationships with my girlfriends are always so much better, with or without intimacy, but maybe it is because we don't really have relationships to start with. Maybe the trick is to not have a "formal" relationship and just "go with the flow" (oh yeah, as he always says)?  As I told myself last night before I went to sleep... "you gotta meet someone new". Boy or girl... I have to or else I might go nuts. And no, it is not the sex (which I never had yet, darn it!).  ==========  MORE DREAMS:  No teeth!  A few days ago I had the scariest dream... all my upper teeth fell (well only 4 remained). It was terrible, it was horrible, I don't ever want that to happen to me, primarily because where would I get the money to replace all those fallen teeth?!? But it was so real when I was dreaming it, that when I woke up, I really breathed a heavy sigh of relief that it was just a dream.  ================  ...and no I did not have any wet dreams lately (awwww!).

      今天是一非常哀傷的天。[Purely in english for now]. It was bad waking up late (I have this stupid habit of turning off my alarm clock and sleeping more when I should be up eating breakfast!)... despite the additional sleep hours I felt so sleepy and tired when I woke up (it was probably due to fucking myself before I went to sleep that night, a theory of mine). I ate breakfast late, started working, then I got into a good mood for a while, but for some reason, after a 4 hours I started feeling terrible, dejected, horrible. I could not even describe how I felt. I felt so emotional, so empty, just soooo bad.  I know waking up late was not the cause 'coz I always wake up late. I probably felt terrible for some things that I should not have done (not the M) but stupidly done. I also felt irritated when I got this stupid reply in friendster (not from the hottie that I am interested in hihihi) I just hate it that some people are too stupid but I guess I am more stupid to be affected with their being stupid. So what I stupidly did was reply, politely to the person but removed him from my friends' list, he is not my friend anyway, and not even an acquaintance but just another "accommodated" person when I was still nice (year 2003). I am such a sore loser and I felt terrible doing that course of action. My temper got the best of me.  But the stupid guy is just a part of this whole emotional thing. I have this stubborn habit of rubbing it in more (I mean rubbing the emotional pangs), so that was what I did and dyaraaaan -- its the emotional me mood times 100.   When I feel totally bad I do something worst which is to fuck myself to get out of my misery. I was supposed to do it again but I was saved by a mobile message from my sweetie-pie which lessened my misery by around 25-30%. I still feel bad but maybe I will just eat it out and sleep it out.    Songs listened to to worsen my mood:   Torn between 2 lovers (Stupid 'coz I don't even have one!)  Tell Me Where It Hurts (awwww... everywhere!)  Someday I'll Be Saturday Night (I hope so!)  I'll be better, I'll be better, I'll be better... I promise (to myself, which I always break). Perhaps I have improved because it has been a fairly long time since I last felt like this. Maybe this is just an indulgence that's just right to give to myself once in a while ("to err and to feel bad is human..."?). I don't know...我不知道.

      Ok, 這是我的第一個嚴肅的Blog entry。當然，這是我喜愛的題目的當中一個。  我在Friendster有一朋又，我們不是親密的朋友，可是我是非常感興趣。 可是她是女 ！我最近写了一个bulletin board post,和她答应乐，可是一个名字她使用是一个名字我不会想，所以我看见她的profile. 我现在想！她使Tonio的朋友，我遇了她多年前，当的她访问了我们国。  我读了她的Profile，它说：“My interests: boobies..." 所以我成为了兴奋得hehehe！我读了多得，她说了："I have not given up on guys yet, but I think I want to explore other options". (Me in my mind: "Wow! So can you try me then?"). 我的心击了快得，as 我思索of the possibilities. (hmm....)  Oh, tempting me more, 她是一个hottie. 她的身体是voluptous. 可是，我的boobies是不大！什么将我现在回写到她？"Thank you for replying to my post. It seems that you are looking for someone to experiment with... Try me?!" hahaha!  Hmmm...我想我不会。 :(  我就要加她到我的Fantasy bank. :)  再见！    AFTER A FEW HOURS...  我做了它! Oh my stupid hands and fingers they typed my reply to the interesting hottie friendster-friend. I am not guilty, I am not guilty, my hands and fingers are the one to be blamed (not just for the reply but for their "other sins" as well).

      Hmm...我要一新汉语名。。。这儿是我的选择：  一。 舒美婷  二。 舒美丽  三。 舒雪婷  四。 舒雪婷  (Last name of my favorite actress and concatenated combination names of my 2 Chinese friends)  其它选择：  五。 许丽淇 ;p 六。 林舒美 :D  Ok enough for now I will definitely think about what Chinese name I should have because I don't think "AiMeiShu" is a valid chinese name ("Ai" cannot be last name?!).   (After 2 hours...) I think I'll change my name to just "SHUSHI" 《舒司》 (as in sounds like Sushi 壽司 that Japanese food).

      大家好！我是爱美舒！欢迎到我的汉语的Ｂｌｏｇ！这是一个那我将写我的思想中汉语的，所以我会学多。 --- Hello everyone! I am AIMEISHU! Welcome to my Chinese Blog! This is the place where I shall write my thoughts in Chinese, so I can learn the language more. ---  I might have a lot of broken Chinese grammar (as well as in english too!), so my advance apologies for that. I will be posting simple (shameless) thoughts first, because of my very limited Chinese vocabulary. This blog is mostly for me, me, and me alone :P (Shellfish ba?).. hmmmmmm okay let us allow some VIP friends then (you know who you are)!

      " ... Friday evening and when all my work is done I've packed my bags, I'm on the run I've got a feeling that I'm gonna have some fun In the sun With my friends  And he's telling me.... whoops now, sorry I can't go whoops now, sorry I can't go whoops now, sorry I can't go sorry I can't, sorry I can't go now ..."  === MY VERSION: Friday evening, my work is done (I've only worked a mean 2.5 hours), my hair, my outfit is packed, I'm on the run, got a feeling that I'm gonna have some fun, with my friends... Whoops now -- where are they? Haha!  Literally I got no one to go out with tonight! Well I can always go out with my trusty 哥哥 and his gang Daisy (but Billy will be absent), but its better to be with a bit younger friends, I guess. Earlier this evening I was even tempted to (shame on me) text J00n and ask him if we can go out as FRIENDS, no more, no less, because it seems that I really am running out of friends (out of desperation).  I might just do that(?). Oh... f*ck it!  Whoops now.   ===  31 July 2004 / Saturday / 6:57 pm  Last night I was ABLE to go out. I asked 哥哥 to call Daisy (who's watching a movie when we called), and we went straight to ATC. Always being the noodle-horny persons at night, we went straight to North Park to eat while we wait for Daisy. Surprisingly, Daisy finished the movie early and guess what she's with the gang -- Billy and friend, Ting. I finally met Ting. She seems nice and looks like Cathy, face and body.  Now the gang is complete.  We "ganged" on toast noodles (the taste of which was not too satisfying I think they changed their "formula" on toast noodles) and some dumplings and most of all, scandalous stories and boisterous laughter. Oh God, I will miss these people when I leave, tsk tsk (but when am I leaving anyway?!).  After leaving the untasty toast noodles bowl empty, we went to the newly-opened Bizu. The irresistable cakes... yum, yum, ahhh... any cake that they have is so delicious. We got a few of those small round cakes and shared, and continued our scandalous storytelling.  There weren't no boys that I spotted to be desireable, but who needs them anyway! Woot-woot.   I think my english is getting bad.

      I have been having the longest "designer's block" ever. Its been a week. I need to deliver a 2nd render/ 2nd type of design but I can't seem to deviate from the previous one I have built. Pretty ironic for someone who has delivered over a hundred designs.  I finally acknowledge -- I am an artist, a designer, and yes, I experience those "blocks", around several times a year. But not this f*cking long!  ==  And yes during these "block" times, I read my ex-bf's blog. Actually there are&nbsp;3 blogs I love to read -- my own blog, my sweetie's blog, my ex-bf's blog. Except for my blog, the last 2 ones are exquisitely written.

      12 or 13 years ago, the album entitled "The Hurting" by 80s group  Tears for Fears  is my ultimate favorite. This album has their famous hit "Mad World". This single is not my favorite, but rather, there are other 2:  Suffer the Children (Track 6)  Watch Me Bleed&nbsp;(Track 7)  ===  And now as I listen to it again, here are some powerful lyrics (well powerful at least for me):   ...   Watch me bleed   Bleed forever   It's not allowed to be unkind    but still the hate lives in my mind    &nbsp;  I'll make no noise   I'll hide my pain   I'll close my eyes   I won't complain   I'll lie right back and take the blame   and try to tell myself I'm living   And when its all been said or done   where do I go, where do I run?   What's left of me or anyone   when we've denied    The Hurting?   &nbsp;

       I, Suck (with a capital S)  Upon further reflection I came to realize that  I, Suck .  And that song "You're No Good" by my favorite Linda R. is probably composed for me.  And that all of my relationships, any kind, platonic or non-platonic,&nbsp;would eventually suffer.  Simply because,  I, Suck . And Joon is probably really one of my soul mates because he says, he  sucks  too.  No two people can  suck  so bad that is why probably, we are soul mates.  I finally know what he meant (and all the other words he earlier said).  He still suck (he recently sucked on Yahoo Messenger), but that's life.   I, Suck , too.

       I have re-started to read "The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People" last week to add up and inspire my continuous efforts on self-improvement.   I have totally sucked for the past few months and now I think I am getting better (not just because of the book, I started the effort a couple of weeks earlier than the book). Here are some minute facts:  1. I am not craving for softdrinks anymore.   Duration: 4 weeks already, more or lessNa da. No more desire. I like water to go with my food at home. Outside, I'd either have iced tea or&nbsp; juice (because I am afraid of regular tap water). Once I attempted to drink a Pepsi with my meal, not because I am craving for it, but I think because it is better to take the meal with Pepsi. I ended up drinking half a glass and threw the rest into the sink. Wow I do have changed!  2. I am more conscious with my food intake   Duration: 2 weeks already, more or lessI have never been conscious, but lately I have been trying to inject fruits (although canned, I don't like peeling up raw ones) and healthier drinks (pineapple concentrates). I have also increased my food intake (thank God for my previous flu, I am more aware of the needs of my body now).    3. I (feel that I) am more efficient   Duration: a few days ago, hihiI am starting to put up a good fight against this bad habit of leisure surfing first, before doing work (and other priority) stuff. For the past few days I was able to fight the itch of doing leisure surfing and was able to put it off until after all work has been done for the day (so now I usually blog at night).    4. I less M! (ooops, warning: private details)  Duration: 3 weeks or so.. so... My libido probably waned a bit&nbsp;but I think I am doing M 25-30% less of the time. Sometimes it is just only every other day, other times it is every other 2 days. But f*ck it, I had this incredible M last Sunday (errrr, Monday early morning 4am?). It wasn't the biggest come,&nbsp;but I worked my boobies so hard so that my nipples haven't ever been so hard in my entire life that I swear when I woke up I felt them and they are still erect (holy!). Well I have this boob-improvement program, I wanted my nips to get bigger, and I think "working" them out occassionally might help (if I could only post an ad: WANTED: sucking partner). But I also had this awesome grand fantasy that included a lot of my major "fantasy players". Dingggggg! I sound really desperate huh? Can't blame me, I need some lovin' baby!   Things to work on:  1. Waking up early (so I need to sleep now!)  2. Rebuilding my physical stamina (hello treadmill!)&nbsp;

       Kim Myung-Min&nbsp;is my current fantasy. ;p   urlLink http://cafe.daum.net/myungminlove     I got to watch him through one of those Korean TV series in Arirang Cable Channel. His passion and (selfish) drive for money and love made me like his character in  urlLink "Do You Like It Hot" . I think he's hot. He played the part sooooo damn&nbsp;well.  Name: Kim Myung-Min/김명민  Birthday: October 8, 1972  (perhaps he's my 7th soul mate)  Height: 5'11"/ 154lbs  Should I make a website for him so I could at least have a date with him?!?  Fantasy Bank: STORED ;p

      Today I learned about&nbsp;the burden of problems my mom's friend is experiencing right now. I really pity her and feel so sorry about her situation(s -- plural, too many problems, that is.) and I really really really wish I could help. But damn I am also trying to make ends meet here and so as much as I wanted to help now, I am not in a position to. Perhaps, sometime later, or maybe I can offer in another type of help (non-financial). &nbsp; Upon learning of my mom's friend's problems, my own problems started to get smaller. I realized that here I am, worrying about money, career, personal emotions, self-growth and even vanity, while other people are facing  real  problems, solutions of which are almost next to impossible. At least my problems are not critical and have solutions, that it is just a matter of time (and effort) for me to solve and sort everything out. &nbsp; People always whine, me = whine and wine. And I have to remind myself not to drink too much on Friday.

      Today my cousin and I discovered the wonders of a small, orgasmic, $1 worth non-digital, non-sexual gadget.  &nbsp;  It is a massage thingy -- its base is a small wooden ball, 150%-200% the size of a JackStone ball, and protruding from a specific area of its surface are 4 small 2-inch wooden sticks with diameter like that of a straw used to drink milkshakes. And, protruding from these 4 wooden sticks are smaller wooden balls, about 150% the size of a small marble.  &nbsp;  It works best on the back. You let someone hold the bigger ball and have the smaller balls run through your back in circular motion. The small wooden balls are&nbsp;non-rotating, and make sure that you have a cotton shirt on&nbsp;-- it won't work if you are topless hahaha!  &nbsp;  It feels half-ticklish, half-relieving. All in all, temporarily relieving, and CAN be orgasmic. Definitely worth&nbsp;my one buck. :-) &nbsp;

       I'm a rollercoaster for the past week - going round in circles, and out of control!&nbsp;   The week&nbsp;has not been a good one for me, primarily because I messed it up. Been running errands for stuff that my family requested to be sent to them since a relative is going back to the U.S. -- aside from this task being time-consuming and tiring, it is also&nbsp;costly. Well, they would pay me back for the expenses incurred for the stuff they asked me to buy, but I saw this item while looking for their stuff, I saw that SALE item, and I saw&nbsp;another SALE item and my cousin and I got hungry and so we ate here and there and voila! before I know it almost&nbsp;$100 is spent!&nbsp;$60 spent for them and $40 for my own vanity and impulsiveness. I just hope they send in the money before the 4th of August so that the interest won't add up to my super-dooper maxed-out credit card.  ===  Why is it that I want to go shopping whenever I feel sad, down or bad? I guess every woman do this?&nbsp; I wanted to feel good and happy about myself and about my situation so I remedy it with temporary vanity. I swear it is EXPENSIVE doing this! Last Friday, because I know that I would have 2 meetings and 1 mini-party to go to, I decided to have my hair blown dry. And since it is 70% off Celine, I was able to buy 2 sleeveless twin tops for&nbsp;just $7, gave one to Achie.&nbsp; Ah, the 1000&nbsp;babe points and 1,000,000 stares I got that day. It is expensive being HOT for&nbsp;a day. But it definitely feels super good.  &nbsp;

      I have already read 64% of the "Da Vinci Code", the book rocks! (丽婷，不买它，我将卖书为您。）I love patterns and conspiracies and theories (damn I have a lot of those)! The book is written a-la Nancy Drew/Hardy Boys type, but of course 100 times better.  Since historical facts stated on the book are said to be true, even if the book is considered fiction, there might be some truth to it. If I think about it, perhaps this is the time when the secrets of the world are starting to be revealed and the revealers are "testing" man's take on thought-provoking theories -- The Matrix, The Da Vinci Code -- both presented a radically different view of how the world, or the world's history is. The fact that both are best-sellers probably means the world, or at least majority of the thinking world is ready for the secret(s). C'mon guys, reveal them now!  ===  On another thought, I am dreaming of writing something like "Why Men are Literally the Devil", or "ConsPIracy -- the PI, PHI, and patterns in the world". Haha it is just a dream -- I can only think, but not write (well). I can write a technical paper and a simple theory explanation but not a book of fiction!

       It's All Coming Back To Me Now   There were nights when the wind was so cold That my body froze in bed If I just listened to it Right outside the window  There were days when the sun was so cruel That all the tears turned to dust And I just knew my eyes were Drying up forever  I finished crying in the instant that you left And I can't remember where or when or how And I banished every memory you and I had ever made  But when you touch me like this And you hold me like that I just have to admit That it's all coming back to me When I touch you like this And I hold you like that It's so hard to believe but It's all coming back to me (It's all coming back, it's all coming back to me now)  There were moments of gold And there were flashes of light There were things I'd never do again But then they'd always seemed right There were nights of endless pleasure It was more than any laws allow Baby Baby  If I kiss you like this And if you whisper like that It was lost long ago But it's all coming back to me If you want me like this And if you need me like that It was dead long ago But it's all coming back to me It's so hard to resist And it's all coming back to me I can barely recall But it's all coming back to me now But it's all coming back  There were those empty threats and hollow lies And whenever you tried to hurt me I just hurt you even worse And so much deeper  There were hours that just went on for days When alone at last we'd count up all the chances That were lost to us forever  But you were history with the slamming of the door And I made myself so strong again somehow And I never wasted any of my time on you since then  But if I touch you like this And if you kiss me like that It was so long ago But it's all coming back to me If you touch me like this And if I kiss you like that It was gone with the wind But it's all coming back to me (It's all coming back, it's all coming back to me now)  There were moments of gold And there were flashes of light There were things we'd never do again But then they'd always seemed right There were nights of endless pleasure It was more than all your laws allow Baby, Baby, Baby  When you touch me like this And when you hold me like that It was gone with the wind But it's all coming back to me When you see me like this And when I see you like that Then we see what we want to see All coming back to me The flesh and the fantasies All coming back to me I can barely recall But it's all coming back to me now  If you forgive me all this If I forgive you all that We forgive and forget And it's all coming back to me When you see me like this And when I see you like that We see just what we want to see All coming back to me The flesh and the fantasies All coming back to me I can barely recall but it's all coming back to me now  (It's all coming back to me now) And when you kiss me like this (It's all coming back to me now) And when I touch you like that (It's all coming back to me now) If you do it like this (It's all coming back to me now) And if we, , ,

      The past 6 days has been terrible for me as I "celebrated" my "annual" sickness week. Every year I get sick only once or twice, and this year, the first one has been really bad. It was so far the most inconvenient and painful (not too painful but irritatingly painful enough) -- my tonsils got bloated, my cough and colds refuse to come out of my system, I was too weak, I was irritable, and lately my stomach has been acting up, but maybe it is just a reaction to the different kinds of medicines that I have been taking (talk about dr. quack quack).  I am just relieved that this is finally over. Although my next "sickness" would be my uncurable "space sickness" wherein I get tired and feel suffocated seeing the same things, being with the same people in the same house for a long time. I can lock myself in my room but I've been in my room for a week already because of my sickness and I am sick of my own room already. Oh well. Bad bad bad week(s)!

      In my 25 years of existence, I have these 3 (so far there are only 3) "little big hells". These are thoughts and little memories of hurt that kill me sometimes when I think about them. These are thoughts that I myself can empower and make me hurt myself more, emotionally.  It is actually stupid, because my mind probably made them all up. Perhaps not totally, there were bases. Little hurt memories. All equal to insecurity. Everything is answerable by "You simply cannot, you simply were not, period".  But why not me?   What's more stupid is that I already know the answer, I already know what to do, and what to do with my "little big hells". But somehow they seem to eternally reside inside me, like ghosts inside a cabinet (nyek!).  There was a long time when I thought I have successfully buried and forgotten about them. But sadly, no. My stupid mind and heart make them ocassionally return and haunt me.  ---  I think I already know what would make those "little big hells" heal -- my O.G.L. ( One Great Love ). The people related to my "little big hells" already have (or had) it, their O.G.L.'s. Perhaps I am just jealous, overly jealous that I wasn't their O.G.L. That even if I meant a lot, I still wasn't their  Reason .  Therefore, I must conclude -- I am not just emotionally needy, but emotionally  greedy  as well.

      I've been thinking about my ex for quite some time now, a lot more often that's why I'm pretty bothered by this. When I think about him it's not the "i miss him.. awwwww" stuff, it is more of the little stuff, super mostly non-romantic.  It was so bad that I have to call on him last Aug 5 for an "emergency" situation -- Cathy ran out of cell battery and I don't know the exact way to Becky's... to buy David's cake. There was no one in my circle who can guide me directly to Becky's -- except him. I tried to look for it first but the more I got caught in traffic. And so I just have to call him and ask, for practical reasons. He wasn't good at giving directions hahaha, but it was probably just super awkward. I thanked him after I found the place.   He greeted David a happy birthday, through me, on Yahoo Messenger. I remember David and J00n met at Bizu.     Confession #1: Temptations   There were times (a lot of times, I'm soooo needy!) when I just wanted to go out and be with someone that I can talk (or even not talk) to, but the problem with me is that there are only a few people that I can think of being with without being "tired" -- My 2 girlfriends, and my ex-bf. That's about it. Since my 2 girlfriends are mostly unavailable, there was this one time when I was tempted to invite him for a friendly night-out, nothing more, nothing less. GOOD that I did not.  Sure I can go out with my brothers or cousins, but nothing probably beats the company of people whom I can really talk to. (hmm.. excuses.)     Confession #2: His Blog   I stopped reading his blog the first week of January this year, I think. But last month I started reading his blog again. He really writes well. He writes (almost) consistently well. He's on a different level of wit, only half of which I could appreciate. But he writes well.   (Although I must admit I find it boring that he consistently writes well... I thought I would want someone who can write well sometimes and can write as dumb sometimes... you know, variety!)       Confession #3: My Whore   One time this thought occurred to me -- call on him because I need some lovin'. I was probably super H at that time, but wait, no. I was on an average H feeling but there's this little urge and thought - why don't I just call on him and ask him if he wants to spend a night with me? Ding dong.  I was probably influenced by Carrie (of Sex and the City). I watched this episode when Carrie wanted to fly (or rather ride the train) all the way to San Francisco just because she is so H and she thinks of Mr. Big as her male whore, her male prostitute.  He's not my fantasy and I don't even fantasize about him at all (actually I did, there were quite a few times, that was when we were still together).  So I was just probably HORNY. (thug!)   ===     Can we still be friends?    Sometimes I think I still want to be friends with him, that he's probably a good friend to be around with, that maybe we're just meant to be good friends after all. But am I sure that this is what I want? Why the hell am I feeling this way, why do I think about him sometimes? It's been almost a year already.  Lalalalalalalala...

      I've been endlessly listening to this song for a couple of days now. No, I am NOT thinking of my ex-bf as I listen and sing to the tune. I just like hearing it and I like imagining being able to sing it, with a significant other to sing it with/to.  I would love to be in love.  (sigh)

      4 years, 13 hours, 29 minutes ago, 丽婷 and I started to become real good friends (haha until I messed it all up...!!!).  Alright, lets have a trip down memory lane.   (I wish I had this secret blog 4 years ago...)         4 years, 13 hours, 29 minutes   Well, it was never the exact date. I just remember that, it was around this time in August, 4 years ago when we had our first "date" -- that is, to meet Mike's mom! ( Sweetie : Mike is this internet quasi-friend that I had, we were never close but we always see each other online during my college internet days, and we met a couple of times already, and I think he fell in love with me or something so he sent me goodies and his mom gave it to me, I think his mom wanted to meet me. He's soooo nice, and I think he's a deep person, but somehow I am not just attracted to him... #1 physically, and #2, we didn't gel that much. I'll tell you about our episode some other time ok?).   First 50 Dates  -- I remember that 丽婷 and I had this date when I just accompanied her at NBookStore and at the very far parking slot, I think it happened sometime early August.  丽婷 : Isn't this during 大位's birthday 4 years ago? Remember when I bought 大位 this yellow-gold hip jug from Starbucks? I know you were there with me! Wasn't it the start of CYS too, when I personally recommended you to 大位? (so we can spend more time together, aside from your skills! Hihihi :D)      Phone sex  (not!) -- I remember those many, many, many times (daily?) that I have to call her - she should have charged me $1.50 per minute, that way she doesn't have to work anymore!!! My fondest memories would be singing with her on the phone (yup, she's a closet singer too) til 3 or 5 am (and then the next day my throat hurts), and probably "sleeping on" her -- that is, on the phone, either 丽婷 or I would fall asleep because we were soooo stupid we're both sleepy and would not put down the phone.   Night visits  -- There were those times when 哥哥就就 and I would visit her at her home at night and we'd spend a few hours chatting on one of the cafe's in Tomas Morato. 哥哥就就 was very fond of her, and its good that her mom likes 哥哥就就 and even considers him a handsome guy (haha!). I'm always very happy being with my 2 favorite people then.   Overnighters  -- Her mom probably wonders from time to time whether her daughter is gay because I would spend occassional overnight stays at her house (well her parents would not let her sleep at our house anyway)! And I give flowers during Valentines' Day, or even during birthdays? (Did i?)   Hippiest times  -- shopping at Mango, and eating (or rather piging) out! That was during the time when we were still getting $$ from our former American boss M.S.   Naughtiest times  -- Singapore (hihihi) where the underground clubs are soooooooo great and where pink vodka is sooooooooo delicious that she sipped the pink vodka straight for 20 seconds and boom -- she got tipsy she needed to hold the table to be able to stand stright.  Hey that night was the bomb we were really able to wear the skimpy tops that we bought! And I remember I also "went down" on Richard- on the dance floor that is. (Oh sh*t, I just remembered something, Ludy went with us back to the Hotel and spent the night there! Now I feel bad not sleeping with her LOL, I just realize I could have been more sensitive...dannnggg. Obviously she could go back to her apartment anytime even at wee hours... eeek my imagination running wild again)     ===  P.S. I have to continue this again some other time, or else I'd write and write and write until morning!

       Happy 16th monthsary, sweetie pie!  Congratulations for NOT giving up on me in 16 months ;p (yup I am still in a bitter-sarcastic mood, sorry) If we were really together and had irresponsible but  reproductive  sex on our 6th month, we would have a one-month old baby by now hihihi, whoever the mommy will be.  So where are you? I haven't heard from you since... yesterday! It is odd, sometimes I feel like its been so long already that I last heard from you, but in reality its only been like 24 hours or so... I am probably just getting older.  Aimeishu. AMEN.
