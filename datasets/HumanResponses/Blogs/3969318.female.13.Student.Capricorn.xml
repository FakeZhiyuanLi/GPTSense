         WEEKLY LOVESCOPES       THIS WEEK'S LOVESCOPES  (7/19 - 7/25 2004)          What to expect this week: Going too far, spending too much or over-estimating another person are likely possibilities at the beginning of the week. It's good to open your mind and your heart, but reducing enthusiasm by about half will give a more realistic picture of what's happening. If   hopes have been raised too high, a crash   on Sunday is likely to bring you back down to earth.      ARIES (March 20–April 19)       If you've got a goal in relationships, you're able to focus in on it with great skill and intensity this weekend. You're able to push obstacles out of the way, overcoming doubts and difficulties to reach your objective, ignoring distractions as you go.    TAURUS (April 20–May 20)       You're definitely willing to reach further for love now, Taurus. But, that could either lead you to make promises you can't keep, or believe those made by someone you can't trust. It's good to reach out, just as long as it's not beyond the range of reality.    GEMINI (May 21–June 20)       This is the last week with your key planet Mercury in outgoing Leo. If you've got something bold to say, Gemini, this is the time to do it. Being spontaneous could make you look silly, but is more likely to bring out the truth that makes you more desirable.    CANCER (June 21–July 22)       You could be pushed into a social situation that you'd normally avoid. But maybe it's a good thing to get you out of your rut now, Cancer. Even if you're not entirely comfortable, you've got a better chance to connect when you're out in the world.    LEO (July 23–August 22)   Telling someone what they want to hear can get you the response that you want, at least in the short-run. But if your flattery isn't sincere, it could come around to bite you in the end. If you don't think you can live with the words tomorrow, don't say them.      VIRGO (August 23–September 22)      You're usually the careful type, Virgo, so you might surprise yourself with the emotional risks that you're ready to take now. Well, going beyond your usual limits is good for you. As long as you're not too self-critical, there's very little downside to being bolder.    LIBRA(September 23–October 22)       You can be very attractive to someone that you can't have now, Libra. Maybe, it's because the chase is so romantic. If you're happy with that, fine, but if you want to build a real relationship, put your energy into a person who's closer and more available.    SCORPIO (October 23–November 22)       You love a challenge, and you'll probably get one this week, Scorpio. Going after a person who is already in a relationship can be very tempting to you. That's pretty complicated, but you're more likely to follow your feelings than to listen to reason now.    SAGITTARIUS (November 22–December 21)       Your relationship life could get very busy this week, Sagittarius. Of course, quantity isn't necessarily better than quality. So, eliminating one person from your life could improve your chances with another one who ultimately has more to offer you.    CAPRICORN (December 22–January 19)       Just because someone's putting pressure on you, it doesn't mean that you have to say "no." Of course, you shouldn't go against your principles, but letting another person take the lead isn't about giving up your power, if you're getting what you want, too.    AQUARIUS (January 20–February 18)       The Sun hits your house of partnership this week, bringing more sunshine into your love life. If you analyze the situation too carefully, though, you could talk yourself out of a connection worth making. Let your heart rule your mind, at least for a little while.    PISCES (February 19–March 19)       It's great to be a giving person, but don't lose your self-respect along the way, Pisces. Being generous is a wonderful thing, but not when it's not fair to you. Be a good negotiator for yourself, if you want to get the love that you deserve from others.
