      “Ahn ashair coullde Sheido! Ashair coullde Frieston!”... That means "I shall bring honor to Sheido. Honor to Frieston." You should all know that Sheido is her home planet. Frieston is her city I guess. It isn't ever mentioned again...

      A handful of Trollocs immediately plugged up the opening. Our chances of getting in were slim. I fondled my sword and a grin spread across my face...I took the cloak off the Myrddraal and wrapped it around me, pulling the hood over my head enough to hide my face. I took up the sword and motioned for Curtis to climb the wall. I walked out in front of the Trollocs and with a swift movement of my hand they parted and I caught a glimpse of that girl disappear. I ordered the Trollocs to follow her...

      After slinking into the shadows between the houses, I heard harsh, guttural voices behind me...Trollocs...I rolled my eyes in exasperation and spun around on my toes. Raising the blade above my head, I flew in a frenzy of slashing and killing. Soon only bodies littered the ground. Mouth twisted in a sneer, I caught sight of the Myrddraal that had sent them and started quickly toward it, blade upraised, an ancient battle cry bubbling to my lips, “Ahn ashair coullde Sheido! Ashair coullde Frieston!*”...

      Scratching an ear idly, I slid down the hill and slinked over to where the girl and fighting man waited. The metallic smell of blood filled my nostrils...better it be his than my blood...I swiftly scaled the tower wall and knocked the Myrddraal from where it was posted. A sneer crept across my face; I’ll let them handle it. I slipped down and opened the gate, disappearing into the city. I was no part of this fight...

      ...Something about that girl was weird...The ears, the eyes, or the fact that she smeared blood on her somewhat red outfit. I stalked to the city walls and motioned to Curtis to follow. I sensed the presence of a Myrddraal in the guard post above us...

      Hey guys. Sorry!! I switched the two posts before this on accident...just read them in the other order...the one that starts off "i gave an unsatisfied sigh" goes between the two that say Asceia. My mistake...

      I gave an un-satisfied sigh and sheathed my sword. I blinked and kept walking, although I did not know the way. I saw a faint glow of light on the horizon. Daybreak. But wait...the moon and stars still lingered in the sky. As we kept going, I noticed that we had found a city. Aldieb by the looks of it. We cautiously approached the town...

      I cursed under my breath. They were headed towards Aldieb- a city already fully tainted by the Shadow. “You fools! Do you not know what awaits behind those walls!? Creatures too twisted to be called men, evil, everywhere!” My fists were clenched tight and my ears laid flat down on my head. We can’t go in there! They’ll know when the evil creatures won’t attack me...I’ll...I’ll have to change my scent. It seemed pleading with them would not change their minds, so I unsheathed my sword and before the others could react, cut a shallow gash in the fighting man’s arm. And before he had time to do much more than cry out, I cupped my hands under his arm and started smearing his blood on me and my clothes, hoping they wouldn’t question what I do...

      That girl...I wiped the snarl off my face and tried to look surprised and hurt, “I would never do that! How could you even suggest such a thing!?” The fighting man was giving me bland looks, so I kept my mouth shut. Something about her cloak...I was fingering the brand on my left palm before I realized it. I peered down at it and jumped, startled. She can’t be the one! I glanced warily up ahead where she was...“She can’t be...”

      I kept out my sword. Desert folk are not to be trusted. Curtis and the girl walked side by side, eyeing each other questioningly. I lagged behind muttering to myself. “How do we know she won’t hand us over to the Evil?” I accidentally let the words escape my mouth. The others stopped and stared at me suspiciously. I pushed past with a mumble, looked over my shoulder and noticed the girl glancing at my cloak and then back at her hand...

      I blinked hesitantly and sheathed my sword...“Well...the path you’re going you would go in a big circle of nothingness. I can lead you out.” I knew my voice was bleak, but I didn’t try to change it. Something about that man tickled the back of my mind. “Let’s go.”...

      “Hmph...We don’t need your help,” but I was cut off by Curtis, “Sure, we welcome company.” He said with a sneer directed towards me.

      She didn't drop her sword...That urge to kill her raved up again, but only with a forced smile could I suppress the feeling. I tried to look nonchalant and innocent...but I think I only half-mastered it..."Hello...I've been following you for some time now, and you seem to be cutting through the hardest parts of the Desert. I grew up here, why don't I accompany you? I can lead you out of the Desert." I swept my hand toward the hills in the distance...

      I glared hostily from one person, a girl, to the other- a fighting man by his looks. Keeping a wary eye on the girls sword, I scanned the man, height, weight, stance...A sneer spread across my face before I could stop it. I could take him...Suspicion flashed across my face...He looked...familiar...I slowly lowered my sword, making sure the girl didn't try anything...

      I couldn’t sleep with the same thought I had. Something was there watching me. I found Curtis with his back to me and I silently got my sword and crept off into the direction I felt was right. I came upon a human...I think. She had cat ears that laid back against her head as she talked in her sleep. I tried taking out my sword, but the sound of the sword against the sheathe made the creature’s ears prick up. She bolted awake as I quickly pulled out my sword. She stood up and did the same. The sound of the metal clanking summoned Curtis...

      I could see the people whom I was following for quite awhile were tiring (they seemed to be picking out the hardest route...) and they stopped again. Small beetles scuttled around underfoot...My only source of food so far...I sat down atop a hill close by their camp and...I was soon lost in a dream...

      I didn’t bother with the shadow, but I couldn’t stand the fact that someone was watching me. I let the thought escape my mind and fell asleep...I woke up to the soft nudging on my shoulder. Curtis had woken me up at dawn. We were headed to the small, scarcely populated town of Aldieb. It was about a two-day walk. We trekked along in the Desert on foot, for we had no horses. We walked forever, eating now and then. Now, it was time to make camp, yet again...

      Slinking silently through the sand, no longer shin-deep, I spotted a small make-shift camp with two figures in it. Coming closer I could make out details, and, as always- the urge to kill them welled up in me until my lips peeled back in a snarl. But I overcame the urge and made camp somewhat close to theirs. Camp? I was sleeping on the ground, no food, no water...

      The sun was setting in the east, ever since the Evil came. We had to set up camp at the edge of the Lost Desert. Curtis said he wasn’t tired, so he sat up by the fire. I rolled my eyes and turned around on my blanket. I thought I saw a shadow against the moon...

      I shuffled through the shin-deep sand, half-aware of anything but the wind swirling around me. It seemed I had come this way many times. Why? The answer rang in my mind, but left before I could understand. I was looking for something, but I knew not what. Not yet at least...I continued my dark brooding through the Lost Desert until I heard the faint hum of voices...

      “It had been a long three years of pain and suffering. One by one the towns of my kingdom fell to the power of the Evil. I was powerless to stop it. The more men I sent to battle, the faster the Evil spread. So I stopped sending forces and let them come. The Evil spread up the footsteps of my home. It was like a poisonous blanket of fog. It corrupted all who breathed it. Soon, the doors of my room were being pounded on. I crept out of the window from where I had been watching this horrible tragedy. I climbed up on the top of the roof and my heart started to talk with the Evil. The Evil showed its face upon the mountain of Light. It tried to corrupt me. I feel to my knees. But then, a being appeared in front of me and I passed out. Then I appeared in this very forest. The being asked me a lot of questions. I had no reply, so she did a very strange light shining thing and I felt my soul coming out of me. I blacked out for what felt eternity. When I came about, she was gone. I looked at the hair that had fallen into my face. It was blue, not the usual brown...A voice around me said, ‘Aviendha...I have brought you here to tell you who you are. You are a warrior. You must come up and save Gia, your kingdom.’ ‘You must be kidding, I am just the ruler, I’m no warrior.’ The voice then said, ‘Reach up and take the sword in front of you and take back your kingdom. I am fading. You must defeat the Evil on the mountain, so I can live again.’ And just like that, she was gone...I picked up the sword and a new blood flowed through my veins. I became Aviendha of Blueflames...a warrior. I then just got up and walked around the Forest of Darkness.” I explained to the lone wanderer. I jumped out of the tree and stood next to him. “Interesting story,” he said. “I don’t believe you, but I’ll travel with you to see if you lie. You may call me Curtis.” His voice sounded a bit arrogant. “Very well,” I replied. We headed off towards the Desert...

      Far out in the depths of space, a small brownish planet, Sheido, slowly twisted its life away, revolving around a weak, almost burnt out sun. In the midst of the silence a tiny child cried out, crying until a comforting arm wrapped around it. The silence was broken only by the wind, blowing softly, stirring up dust and twisting it into tiny dust devils. Moonlight glinted off armor-clad men, moving quickly and quietly toward a small, sleepy town. It was surrounded immediately, and thirteen men disappeared into the town. Shortly after, a woman clutching a child was dragged out from it. Her calm composure only marred by the sharp glint of fear in her bright, golden eyes. Few words were spoken before the child was snatched from her arms, given to a tall man on a horse, and spirited away. "This will not be spoken about. Understand? Your child fell and drown in the well." The mother's eyes were bleak. Before she could open her mouth to answer, a twisted dagger appeared in her chest- her eyes filmed with death before she even reached the ground. "She will tell no one now." A soldier cuffed the man for killing her, but all disappeared into the night like swift-moving shadows. When the soldiers arrived back on Gia, the child had to be taught as quickly as possible. The younger they were, the less memories they had to erase, and this one was young-it couldn't have been older than a year. Dropping smoothly to his knee, he laid the small child on the cold marble floor, and pressed his face to it as well. "I have brought him, my Lord." He would be praised, this one had a vast amount of hidden power. "Yes...but he is not old enough-- I give him to you to care for, and if he is harmed..." The unspoken threat rang loudly in the still air; men in the room shuffled their feet uneasily. "Yes, yes of course...my life before his always, my Lord." He tried to appear meek as he rose, taking the child in his arms, but the emotion was foreign to him. "Leave." He bowed quickly and strode from the room stately, turning his gaze down to the child--then stopped suddenly. Horror and awe crept across his face as he peered down at the child. His eyes were open. They were a burnished golden-orange color...not green. He found himself pressed to the ground again in front of the High Lord of the Guard. "He is...ah...a she." Suspicion danced across the High Lord's face, "You are sure? No...don't tell me. You must now make sure she does not die- now her life is more valuable then...even mine." And so the child grew, ripened, and learned, until she could better even him. Upon her first birthday (the years were different on Sheido- one year on Gia is the equivalent to 16 there.) she was taken to the Heart of the Desert and ceremonially raised to the level of a Redhawk, sworn to protect the Queen and her children with her life, and set to remember it with a sharp brand on the left palm- the royal sigil. She also got a silver hawk pin to put above the gold knot already on her left shoulder. She was so far along already, yet some still thought she should be killed. For thousands of years, only men from Sheido were allowed in the Guard. But she was strong. And he had promised to protect her with his life. Until one day...she was stolen away, somehow, in the middle of the night, but returned a day later with not a mark on her. No one knows what happened, but rumor states she went on a massacre, killing thousands of people before the night was over. Absurd, he knew, yet when she came back from that night, she had a brand on her right palm, a brand the shape of a teardrop on end, a teardrop wreathed in flame...the Shadow's symbol. He knew she would be killed if word got out of it, so he snuck her out of the kingdom of Gia and banished her into the Lost Desert. She was never seen since...until the Evil came...She rode shadows like horses and destruction followed in her wake. Evil wrought the land until there was not much left, and now myth states that on a full moon at night, you can see a ghostly figure wandering around, searching...searching...

      I decided on a way to post it. I'll just put the name of the character whose view point it is at the moment...

      Hey All,  My friend and I have been working on a fantasy (lord of the rings type) story for a long while now, and she FINALLY finished typing it up. Lol...On paper it was 613 or so pages. So it's quite long, but well worth it. At first, you can tell we didn't know what we were doing, but as the story progresses, our writing style gets better and longer. It's not broken down into chapters, so it's a tad bit hard to follow. It starts with a brief history, and then my character begins. We would write however much we felt like and then just switch. So the view point constantly changes between two characters. There are most likely some spelling errors, though I hope I've caught them all. Oh, and there are quite a few inside jokes that only our friends, and perhaps only us, would catch. I'll most likely post bits and pieces at a time, it's far too long to post at once. If I feel the need to clarify something, I'll put an * by it and explain it in another post. Well, that's all I have for now. Enjoy
