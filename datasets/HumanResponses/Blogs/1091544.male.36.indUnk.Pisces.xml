       A serious case of navel gazing here in Oaktown after a few kids busted up some downtown shops following the Raider loss in the not-so-super-bowl.  The word is that the town of Oak may not recover from the "black eye" this pack of mosquitoes has caused the city struggling with it's image like a chocoholic struggles with flabby thighs.    Well, it just goes to show that the folks who give us the local news have no research departments... Not only is this type of thing fairly common, if anything, the "Oakland Riot" was downright wussy.  Let's step back and go over some of the better Sports Riots in recent history...  Denver - long known by us here in Oakland as a pack of worthless hooligans has sports fans with second careers as "riot engineers".  Let's go back to 1996 when the streets took several thousand drunk and rabid fans to it's bosom for a little extracurricular bonfire activity.  How about in 1998 when the "worst sports riot in Denver's history" saw 10,000 losers torching, looting and destroying their own town... this after their team won the Super Bowl.  They held a follow up soiree in 1999 when the Broncos repeated as Super Bowl Champions.  It doesn't end there - 5000 loons took to the streets after the Avalanche won the Stanley Cup in 2001.  Now that is some serious lack of civic pride.  Sorry Denver much like many other things... you lose here as well... Without a doubt Detroit is our hands down Riot champion... Detroit 1984 Michigan & Trumbull... Tigers win the World Series and what is left of Detroit goes up in flames...  Canadians are still coughing up the ashen remains of old Buicks.  Not a real problem here as it will be more than a few years before the Tigers get the trophy.  Detroit reputation was so irretrievably damaged already, this riot was only notable for the fact that there was actually something left to burn...    How about the Riot that might have actually added to a towns sports fan credibility?  Los Angeles 2000... outside the Staples center... Lakers fans riot after the big win... reputation of LA as the land of the "5th inning fan" fades... just a little... Who woulda thunk it?  That many fans still tuned into the game.  For the three of you who read this and don't know what that means - LA fans have the rep. of showing up in the 3rd inning and leaving in the 5th.  It goes on and on... I stay away from collegiate sporting events and european soccer (or Football to the increasingly anachronistic British) because they break out with a riot with such frequency that it would be impossible to keep up.  How about a little respect for the progress we have been making in our great rioting heritage?  For years, the word Riot played bitch to the word Race - It was the Race Riots in seemingly every city and town that were kicking in our collective teeth since before the 1940's and going into the 70's.  Isn't a sports riot just a slightly out of control Kegger compared to a Race Riot?  Which of the two represents the tearing of our social fabric based on the lack of respect for our fellow man?  Well, yeah, they both are but it is a matter of degrees and I'll take 10,000 drunks in Denver whooping it up over Mr. Ed and the rest of the Orange clad neo-warriors  over 1968 Detroit every time.

       Evil, not the vague sort of thing we have battering us everyday but the real deal, is recognizable when, by simply hearing about it, you can feel a part of your soul torn from you.  Spectator and participant alike cannot explain it.  It's specific and sharp, without doubt or reason.    After waking up to this story last week I was painfully aware that the real deal had taken a swipe at the collective once again.   http://www.lasvegassun.com/sunbin/stories/sun/2003/jan/24/514565930.html

       In Vegas last week and walking down the street with my wife and a friend from work.  In a good mood because I've decided that I'm "off the diet" for the trip and we are headed to the Big Ass Buffet at the Bellagio.  As we stride towards the piles of food, we pass by some people handing out what looks like business cards.    Being in the Marketing and Advertising game myself, I just had to check out the collateral presented by this fine phalanx of pavement promoters.  The cards hint at what appears to be a very limber working professional who would visit you for a price.  My interest is piqued. While many pertinent details were missing, the price was clearly stated and ranged from $60 to $75 with several choosing the ever popular $69 - go figure.  We got the "Low price leader", the "Premium Brand" and the cleverly positioned (still talking price here) all within a few feet.  Before I know what was happening, I got about 10 cards.    My wife made me toss them out before I could ask the hucksters why the price difference.  So, what's the moral of the story? Well, let's go for this one - When walking in Vegas, it's good to have your wife around to keep your priorities in order.

       Of course this being my first post after the Raiders loss in the Superbowl it could be expected to be one of those "we'll get 'em next year" rah rah BS jobs.  Well, it aint.  It was an ass kicking and we will need to punch up several positions on the team and lose something like $45 Million in salary.  Unless Al can get some players to take life long debilitating injuries for free instead of making millions elsewhere we are going to have some serious challenges next year.  Spring training in one month...  I hear the A's got some new pitchers in the off season.  Hope springs eternal for the sports fans.  I hear even the Boston Red Sox fans still go to the games hopeful the planet will suddenly spin in the other direction and a world series trophy will land in their town.  At least I'm not one of those losers ;-)

       Go Raiders... there is nothing finer than to be in Oakland in the morning... out the door at 6:15AM to get in line for a spot in the parking lot.  If you have never seen the Raider Nation in living color, too bad... I took my dad to the game and he was just looking around at all the freaks and goons and referred to his new Raider Jacket as "life insurance"... We're sitting at the game and one of the most irritating things on earth - a commercial on the diamondvision - asks "is your hat official NFL merchandise?"... so Dad asks:  "think this brand new hat is official?"  and I ask him "how much did ya pay for it?",  "$28",  "it's official" ... there is no shame when it comes to wrenching money from folks...

       So, I crewed for a race on Saturday.  We sailed an Erickson 35 to a third or fourth place finish,,, it's pretty damn irritating that they don't let you know who won until several days later... anyway, I get a return invite because I can "pull line"... I've been told repeatedly that there are no "ropes" on a boat, if I fall over board I sure hope they throw me a line...  San Francisco sailing is backassward - the Winters are calm and the Summer is where all the wind is... great thing about crewing on a boat is that some other guy has spent all the money - bad thing is he insists on being the skipper... really bad thing - he calls you "little buddy"... nobody has called me little buddy in a long, long time.

       From my close observation of writers...they fall into two groups: 1) those who bleed copiously and visibly at any bad review, and 2) those who bleed copiously and secretly at any bad review.    - Isaac Asimov  Well, here it goes.  If you know me already the thought of me publishing to a blog is going to be somewhat amazing, while I can at times talk quite a bit I rarely say anything of lasting significance.

       It’s true what they say about dogs – they take after their owners.  My Golden Retriever named Bridget because of a weird thing she has going on with the hair on her nose (it’s kind of like a mini Mohawk).  I need to clear something up right here and now – I did not name the dog.  We have always picked up our dogs from the pound (Don’t be an asshole - Spay and Neuter) and Bridget came to us from the Animal Rescue Foundation… anyway, the dog got into it with a Skunk.  She’s tied up in the back yard tonight and won’t be coming back into the house until the smell goes away.  Giovanna was upset her bed buddy wouldn’t be with her but waxed philosophical “You can’t win a fight with a skunk – even if you kill it, at the least you’ll be stinky”.  Wisdom?  To be sure.  Maybe one day I’ll learn to stay away from the no-win fights in my life.

       I’m watching the Grammys tonight and one thought repeatedly tore through me – these are the most popular communicators of our times and not one of them can spontaneously compose a coherent sentence… I find myself looking forward to Norah Jones following up her big success tonight… It’s nice to see bad dancing, vacuous stares and tattoos don’t always make a winner… … John Mayer will catch up to the moment, but will we still be around to care… Simon & Garfunkel will make a wad of money if they take their act on the road again…  In real life, the belly buttons don’t look this good… or get this much play… RIP Joe Strummer… The theme from Six Feet Under won 2 Grammys…  Jimmy Sturr won for best Polka album… Why.

       I guess my problem is that I don't necessarily agree that The POTUS needs to  urlLink clear it with Bonnie Raitt  before he goes to war...  I like her music and all but she might not be up on her international intelligence updates from the Secretary of State.  If she could just focus on one thing for a minute, Alexis Dinno might be interesting…  You know, I might get out and protest something if real hippies looked like Dharma (Jenna Elfman)... Just looking at the rally makes me wonder if there is a business to be had as a roving deodorant vendor... 50 protestors are in SF County Jail tonight... a protestor on TV declaring poice violence and that he was knocked down but I don't know if I can I take the guy seriously - can anyone with that many visible piercings really have a problem with a little pain?

       I flipped to 60 minutes tonight just in time to hear  urlLink Andy Rooney's commentary.     I don't always agree with him but ever since I found out Andy is an amateur woodworker I have given him greater latitude (I’ll get into that later).  His comments illustrate a difference between his generation and mine.  They went to war and saved the world.  We still send soldiers (and tax dollars) around the world.  But now we do it as a preventative (half)measure.    Approval from the French?  It’s never going to happen.  They have too much money riding on Saddam.  If we have proof there is a risk, let’s layout the case and move forward.  Andy’s right – the French (or anyone else) are not going to step up and settle international disputes.  Sooner or later they would have to put up or shut up and they don’t have the muscle.  We do, and that’s why it’s our call.

       I was lucky enough to be invited to the Pebble Beach Pro/Am golf tournament on Giovanna's 8th birthday.  Lucky because she loves to play golf (go figure) and because this turned out to be a perfect day.  As the tournament was ending, we took a walk down the 18th fairway and I was able to get a few pictures of her.     urlLink This picture   defines my job as a parent.  I see Giovanna as a brave, smart little girl facing a very big world that holds beauty, promise and danger.

       Disclaimer: I claim absolutely no level of knowledge or skill in dealing with the opposite sex, or people in general.  Read at your own risk and remember that only you can prevent forest fires - and your significant other walking out on you...   I went to the 24 Hour Fitness web site and read that I have to get to 170 pounds to not be considered "overweight" - heartless bastards!  I have dropped from 230 to 200 and now I find out I need to get to 170 just to be borderline "overweight".  Unfortunately I know there is some truth to this as I have independent medical verification.  One way to deal with having high triglycerides is one of the many high protein, low carb diets.  I've been on one for almost a year and it's one of those things I'll probably be sticking with for quite some time.  A side effect of this whole thing is I have a greater understanding of how a woman thinks.  Stand back sports fans, I'm about to share something with you... Yesterday, I scarfed a huge piece of cheese cake for lunch.  Not exactly on the diet, but pretty damn good.  I saw it in the fridge over the last couple of days and at first, ignored it, then the little bastard got into my mind and I couldn't stop thinking about it.  I had to have a slice of the creamy goodness that is cheese cake.  So, when no one was around, I dove in and started to chow on it.  About a third of the way through this sinful exercise I realized what I was doing was horribly, horribly wrong... about two thirds through it, I told myself to stop... when I was one bite away from the finish, the guilt descended on me like the plague... This had never happened to me before - guilty about eating? who'd a thunk it?  Well, as I was washing all the evidence and putting it in the dishwasher, I realized that this is cheating... well, what passes for cheating for people on a diet... So guys, I'm here to tell ya - when you get caught with that other woman, you can just skip the flowers - it'll do no good.  If you want any chance at all, you had better have some pictures of your significant other going to town on a big chunk of sugary delight.

       If it isn't something, it's always something else...  You know how you don't remember everything from your childhood.  One of the things I don't remember is what led up to it, but one day my dad packed up me and my brother and drove us to the middle of nowhere.  Somewhere in the desert, we pulled into roped off a dirt area filled with all kinds of crazies who came in everything from dirt bikes to mobile homes.  We were there all morning, just hanging out and bored stupid - then all of a sudden helicopters are flying back and forth about 10 feet in the air with big machine guns pointed at us.  We knew this was the real thing - we had come to see the shuttle land.    Two booms... everyone straining to the sky... someone saw if first... a few "there it is"... then silence... it didn't quite fly, more like it fell out of the sky at a horizontal angle... Three huge parachutes appear from the rear end and then we hear the sounds of a space ship hitting the planet...  it turns left and rolls out of view... and just like that, it was over.    Dad had to see it and knew it was something we needed to see as well.  It was truly awesome.    Mom had a specific skill with computers and spent a lot of time working for Aerospace companies, Rockwell, Northrop, and Hughes were some that I remember.  One time we went to an open house at one of them and got to walk inside one of the booster rockets for the shuttle.  The thing was huge.  If you wonder why stuff for the space program costs so much it comes down to one word - big.  Everything was huge.     So, what was promising to be a lousy Saturday due to a hangover, trip to the dump, the cleaners, and grocery store took a hard left from lousy to downright shitty.  I'm one of those guys who is always bitching and moaning about how the government misspends the small fortune they take in taxes.  I'm also one of the Americans who take an inordinate amount of pride in the space program.  Even when we are running in the red, as a country, we have decided that it's worth it to spend the resources to push the envelope.  Today, we pay a more real price.  When the shuttle disintegrated over three states this morning, we lost the lives of seven excellent people.  We also were reminded that pursuit of our Manifest Destiny has always come at a hefty price.

       The new baseball season is here and hope springs anew for each and every fan.    So you think you're a fan?  Here's my handy rating system.. in a few seconds, you'll see how easy it is to find out what kind of fan you really are.  For each of the following, choose which would you rather have; it, or your team as World Series Champions:  the answers are cumulative, so a level 2 fan would take a drink of water and a happy meal rather than see his/her favorite team win the world series.  1. A drink of water 2. A Happy Meal 3. Clean Laundry 4. A New High Powered Rifle 5. New Golf Clubs 6. A new Boat (power or sail - your choice) 7. Porsche GT3 (or GT2 if you really swing a pair - if mini van got anywhere near your mind then go back to level 2) 8. A hot babe - with a great "attitude" (hair color - your choice) 9. Your own satellite  10. The Playboy Mansion  You are all smart enough to know where you fit in already, but this wouldn't truly be in the trashy fashion magazine format if I didn't demean your perceptive abilities further by giving you the answer key and translate the results for you:  Level 1-3 These are all trick questions - a true fan does not need to wear a shirt at a game and can live entirely on beer and hot   dogs.  But then again you didn't know that did you... you are not a fan. Level 4 Dude, even Sammy Hagar got to level 5 Level 5 We are entering the acceptable range - especially for fans who have had their team win it all before.  If you are a BoSox fan, and stopped here you might actually be a Yankee fan. Level 6 Things are getting a little iffy for the fans at this level.  I mean, cmon... it's a boat, golf clubs, and a rifle...  that is a lot of entertainment to pass up. Level 7 If you turn down a Porsche, you either already own one, or own the damn team. Level 8 Are you freaking nuts?  A Porsche and a hot babe?   Level 9 I threw this in for the dweebs.  I knew they wouldn't really like a Porsche (it isn't as practical and stylish as a Saturn) and a hot babe would be so far out of their realm of consciousness they couldn't even imagine it. Level 10 Shut up - there is no F'ing way you would got here. Oh, I get it, your wife was reading this with you... or you are a real BoSox fan.

       Alex, that's my two year old boy, asked me to turn off the radio on the way to school yesterday.  "OK", I said.  (I love talking to The Boy in the car - other people think I'm crazy until they see the car seat) He says "I want to sing you a song"...  Well, if you've ever been with my daughter, you'll know where he got that from - The Girl just doesn't shut up... ever.  She can sing for two hours straight and will expect you to listen to every word.  It gets pretty old after awhile.    So, here I am in the car with The Boy and he sings the softest, least annunciated version of the A,B,C's... it was perfect.  Every single letter was there and he even trailed off the "...won't you come and play with me".  I looked at him through the rear view mirror and he gave me that big smile of his and said "again... you sing it with me".    Ya' know, I really like talking to my kids in the car because some days I don't get much better than that... and that singing will only really get old if they stop singing to me.

       I saw an old lady in the gym today - what, that's not very interesting?  OK, she was digging in her bag and pulled out lead weights and duct tape.  She proceeded to tape the lead to some dumbells, did her arm curls, pulled off the lead and tape and continued on her way.    Why bring your own weights to the gym... and duct tape?  Why start working out when you're pushing 80 years old?  The questions burn.

       I'm going to coin a phrase right here and now.  After test driving a bunch of cars over the last couple of weeks, I can say that cars around $40K are now required to have "Kung Foo Cup Holders".  Imagine this - you slide into the car and stumble on an interestingly shaped little button equipped device.  Being slightly more primate than evolved human, there is nothing you can do except push it.  Then WHAM! this thing is flying in three directions all at once.  You stare in amazement as the insanely bored sales person deftly hands you a clean white towel to sop up all the blood and gets out a zip lock baggie for the three fingers you just lost.

       There is no better illustration of the difference between us and them than the story of Khalid Shaikh Mohammed who goes to the Philippines on business, hits a strip bar, gets an enthusiastic young lady to leave with him, and then and this is the kicker.. asks her to put money in a bank account.  I'm trying to think if I've ever heard this story end quite like that.  Usually, it's the guy hitting his bank account to -- how to say this -- retain the young ladies enthusiasm.   There is the other thing -- his business in town? Setting up a terrorist network.  What an asshole.

I have no idea what will come next (having never really figured out the female of the species) but this might be an early indicator of why it takes so long for them to get ready to go out and also, just maybe, why they always go to the bathroom in pairs... I'll keep you posted as I find out more.  As long as you pinky swear that you can keep a secret.

        Later, the same day at the very same gym…  We come upon two young Latino males dancing around the scale in the locker room.  Let’s pick-up the action as your intrepid author comes into view…  Guy One(standing on the scale): “Check it out Dude, I’m One Twenty Nine” Guy Two: “Dude, let me see” Guy One: “see Dude, 129” Guy Two: “Dude, That aint’ that bad” Guy One: “Yeah, Dude, but I’m like 2% body fat” Guy Two: “Dude, No you’re not”  Our hero quietly leaves the scene…

        WARNING   There is an evil tide rising in the world and you need to be aware of it.  It’s what I’m referring to as the “Doctor’s Visit” analogy.  Want to make your stupid argument sound good?  Use the "Doctor's visit" analogy.  I've come across this twice in the last week.   On marketing – “If your doctor acted like your Marketing guy, he'd spend an hour telling you about his cool stuff and then ask you if you were interested in a diagnoses”.  Please, make these pinheads shut up.  I go to the doctor to perform a function, I’ve already made the purchasing decision (that’s how I chose my doctor).     And the second one from some professional certification program that went something like “I’m not really a doctor but I think you should get brain surgery”…  What complete horseshit.  These self important crack addicts are assuming that being a business consultant (and an HR weenie one at that) is on par with a professional head cracker.  This has got to stop.  So, I’m warning you now – if you see a Doctor’s Visit Analogy in an advertisement you need to turn away.

        Softball -- Cars -- Cigars -- Beer -- Rap Music -- Poker    It's Tuesday of last week and I'm tearing through the work day, getting ready to leave for Chicago on a 5 day business trip.  Lots of loose ends are getting tied up.  More importantly, I'm looking forward to the opening of softball season that night.  It's not just opening night -- Mark and I are going to have a long awaited cigar after the game.    He had a baby boy a month ago and this cigar had been planned as soon as he told me.  Two weeks ago, I also found out he was being laid off of his job as a salesperson.  We talked for about a half an hour discussing his recent travels, the new baby, softball and what the hell he was going to do next - there's a lot of stress with a new baby and no job.  I don't think Mark needed someone to tell him that things would work out, but I did.  I also told him not to forget the stogies for the game on Tuesday, "No way dude, I'm all over that."  Mark smokes good cigars and I knew he was bringing something tasty.  We'd sit around, smoke, drink a few beers, and talk all this shit out.  I changed my plane reservation from Tuesday night to Wednesday morning.    Tuesday is in the home stretch -- I'm following up on some urgent shit at the office that will ultimately be entirely forgotten in a matter of weeks, beginning to pack my bags and powering up the extra laptop batteries so I could watch a DVD on the plane... and I get a call from my wife.  It was one of those "aw shit" things.  She had called earlier while I was in a meeting and I forgot to call her back.  The message was something like "Mark from your softball team died last week..."    I didn't hear her correctly, or she didn't get the message correctly... I called our answering machine to hear it for myself.  At 12:15 on a Tuesday afternoon his wife called to tell me her husband had died and that she knew he was scheduled to come tonight, but wouldn't be coming to the game.  "Please tell the guys for me."     We were also getting ready for a different season.  On game night, we would follow-up with a poker game that could last until 2AM.  Not bad for a weeknight.  One thing I never understood was Mark's affinity for gangster rap.  A thin white kid who grew up in a predominantly white suburban setting, Mark could lip sync Public Enemy like he was from Compton.  He would put it into the CD player and we would be playing and it would shuffle in and he would break out in a rap... It was too damn funny.    The entire middle of me disappeared.  I was standing there with absolute emptiness where my heart and gut had been just seconds before.  I quickly left work and went home to try to find out more.  I finally got in touch with the guy who introduced us and he filled me in to the details and let me know that the funeral was at 1:00 that day.  She was to bury her husband in 45 minutes and she called to tell me that he wasn't coming to the game.  Mark was seemingly healthy - a thin athletic build and there was nothing deceptive about his speed -- he could really turn it on.  After the game that night I told everyone on the team what had happened.  What a horrible thing, what an absolutely horrible thing to have to do.  Prepared speech went out the window and a stream of words came out of my head and I didn't stop until the faces looking back at me registered the news.  Then I shut up.    Softball, cars, cigars, beer, rap music, poker -- He was a husband and a father, and he was my friend.  Mark will be missed.  He had mentioned that he had a little thing with his heart once, several years ago when we found out one of the guys on our team had open heart surgery.  It was a casual reference and one I had forgotten.  Now it's one of those things I can't forget.  last Tuesday would be the first time I saw my friend Mark after his son had been born a month ago.

        Two party system?  We don't get invited to either.   I pulled this off of  urlLink  CNN.com .  FACT BOX Gasoline prices in selected cities. Prices are per gallon of regular: -  Los Angeles: $2.12 -  Seattle: $1.83 -  Washington: $1.72 -  Chicago: $1.69 -  Philadelphia: $1.66 -  Denver: $1.59 -  Detroit: $1.58 -  Houston: $1.54 -  New Orleans: $1.53 -  Atlanta: $1.44  It really sucks living in California.  We are a politically neutered State - the Democratic party considers us a lock and the Republicans seem to be satisfied to yield the votes.  Not long ago, we were given the option of voting for an open primary - this would allow us to vote for any candidate in a primary regardless of party affiliation.  Didn't everyone get the picture when both parties pushed hard to strike it down?  The threat was that they would simply ignore the California votes.  So What?  We are ignored now.  Big business runs unchecked in California.  From our recent electricity fiasco to the ongoing disparity in gasoline prices we are being fleeced.

         Barbara dropped the hookah and everything went to shit.  On the last day in Vegas Barb, Paul and I are walking through a mall when we come up on a hookah shop.  Sammy the hookah boy offers a hit off the huge bong and I'm saying "yeah, sure why not."  Sammy is playing up the Egyptian bazar thing like crazy.  Among other fun lies he tells me that the hookah is great for your health and I've decided to play along.    I'm haggling with Sammy for about 20 minutes and Paul and Barbara are hitting the hookah.   I've only got him to $120 for the package deal and since he doesn't get to my self imposed $100 limit on stupid purchases I'm ready to go. Finally Barbara blurts out, I'm buying one.    At this point Paul just about shits.  We are flying Southwest in a couple of hours and he absolutely does not want to be in group "C".  I think the first time he said it was about 5 minutes after he landed – I’m sure he’s been thinking about it for the last 48 hours.  Paul starts in on the hookah again and this time I join him while Barb tries to squeeze Sammy to throw more into the deal.  Finally, Barb gets the hookah and we are on our way.  We're not quite running, but we aren't stopping for anything either.    Just as we're getting to the end of the mall, Barb drops the hookah and the damn thing shatters.  Paul shits.  I laugh.  Barb is pissed.  We run back to Sammy only to find him putting the sweet talk on a couple of hookah groupies (hey, Barb says, didn't he say he was married?).    While Sammy and Barb are working the whole thing out Paul gets a beer at a neighboring bar and I camp out at the hookah.  I'm still smoking my ass off when Paul gets back from his beer.  We both hit the hookah and I find myself answering questions of passers by.  “Sure, I guess you could smoke that shit through a pipe.  But, dude,(big exhale) why. (take a hit) This thing kicks ass. (exhale and pass to Paul) Dude you aughta check it out.”  Finally Barb gets the hookah together and has Sammy ship it to her house.  Now, we are running.  All the way through the mall and down the street to Bally’s where we get our bags and a cab to the airport.  Not only are we in “C”, we walk up as the plane is boarding.  We are the last three people on it.  But, I’m cool.  I smoked enough hookah snot to keep me high for two days.

        Viva Las Vegas  I'm heading back to LV tomorrow morning for three days of vericose vein building trade show torture.  I finally got a little smarter and bought a ticket to "O".  No you pinheaded perv - it's the Cirque Du Soleil show at the Bellagio.   This should be good.    The flip side is that I'm nagged by the reminder of the violence from my last trip.  It's amazing how quick we adapt to horror.  But adaptation to horror shouldn't render it any less potent.  Isn't every murder equal to Cain's?  What the hell do I know, it's not like I'm a deep thinker or anything.  Patricia has a push on her site to get you to be a bit more aware of the issues around child abuse.  And I've always thought, who could possibly be for child abuse?  Well these   urlLink  FugMonkeys   sure seem to have missed the point.  How do you leave your kids to the hands of a couple of spun out tweaks?

        Sailing takes me away...  Expecting seriously heavy winds, we started the Regatta today with small sails.  Unfortunately, the wind in the SFBay didn't really pick up like we had planned and we were pretty much racing with a slow boat all day.  Nothing sucks quite like racing a 4 hour race and knowing within the first 15 minutes that you are screwed.  We made a late push, but in the end we couldn't keep up. At least we had some fun, and I lost a hat.

        If you gotta die,  It's come to this.  If you are going to get killed in California the deciding factor in whether you get your 15 minutes posthumously seems to be dependent on whether or not your support contingent can muster some appealing pictures with a great smile.  And they better not be checking any of the other boxes in the ethnicity section of the police report.  From Diane Whipple to Laci Peterson, nothing sells advertising on the locally over-produced news like a hottie who has suddenly been iced.

         I have seen the other side and it is good.  I finally got to play golf at the local country club and won the long drive contest.  Yeah, nailing a 310 yard drive is cool, but the 200 yard second shot to an elevated green was better.    For 3 years I could see the course from my house, but up to now have been stuffed into the Municipal courses amongst the teeming hordes of the unwashed.  I'm not sure I can go back.  I just need to find a way to come up with the insane wad of money that it will take to get in... oh yeah, and they have to invite me.  On the other hand, I guess I should play more than 10 times per year before I get into something like this...

        The end of the periodical  In one of those moods about a year ago, I ordered something like 7 magazine subscriptions.  So for the last year, I haven't read one book - only magazines.  Mostly car magazines.  While I was satiated at first, the monthly grind is getting a little tedious.  I'm ready for them to stop coming.  I'm also looking forward to getting back to my regular reading habits.    Then something weird started happening.  I'm getting magazines I didn't order and ones that should have stopped, haven't.  I'm getting a little worried.    Books are stacking up, and I can't get to them.  I'm wading through Car & Driver, Esquire, T&L Golf, and the list goes on...   I'm going to open a barber shop just so people will start stealing them from me.

         I lead a life heavily influenced by luck and coincidence.    We run to the BART train to get back to work after a meeting and just as the train is taking off, two girls get on and sit in the seat behind us.  Halfway through our conversation, Greg still doesn’t believe I’m talking to my niece from Boise.  It’s a quick conversation as we’re only going one stop and I’ll probably not see her again for several years.  Amber, if you’re reading this you should send Mark a letter.

        It’s our turn in the barrel  John Stamos is pitching a phone service while Tears for Fears is playing in the background.  In another ad, ALF is pushing long distance for a buck.    Advertisers hit two main demographics: people wealthy enough to buy what they sell or the easy mark – young people.   So why the 80’s trivia into advertising?  Bad news cheese, we’ve gotten to the point where we should have “figured it out”.  There was a slice of time when you were pretty much off the radar.  Well buddy, them days is over.  Living over our heads with no visible means of support (other than fully laden credit cards) with cinder block furniture and an empty fridge should have morphed into a responsible job, the desire for a really comfortable chair to watch the big TV with the sound system.  You’re expected to be successful now and you’re back in the sights of the evil ad geniuses. It doesn’t matter if you aren’t ready yet, they are coming for you.  ALF and John Stamos are only the entry wound.    So, how are you doing?  Are you ready to be the target of an Oldsmobile ad?  How about an ad for medication?  Your very own acre in California Pines?  It’s a long slow slide and Madison Avenue is ready to grease the skids all the way.  Get smart, skip it all.   urlLink Invest wisely in diamonds and retire wealthy.   Yeah, right.

        Horribly, horribly wrong.  I’m watching “House Hunter” tonight.  I’m sure you’ve never seen it because it really sucks.  It’s a show that follows around a real estate agent and a homebuyer and you can tell how long you have been watching it by counting the number of times the agent says “Why don’t we go look at…”.  The math is simple – they say it about 5 times per minute.  Bad dialogue is one thing, and I’ve watched enough “Action” movies to be somewhat immune.  I have one huge problem with this show – unattractive people.    It’s TV – unattractive people should sit home and watch it, not be on it.  I see unattractive people all day long.  Ugly isn’t a crime but it’s so damn common that it shouldn’t be called entertainment.  For christsake, even if you aren’t a physical specimen at least dress nicely and comb your damn hair.  It wouldn’t hurt to annunciate either.  Why broadcast mundane?  Give me sexy. Sexy actors, actresses, spokesmodels, newscasters, even  the chick on The Weather Channel better be hot or I’m flicking over to the news where our local weathercaster has the forehead of Frankenstein, but at least she dresses nicely.

         What the world needs now...  Is a handy movie guide that will tell me how far into a movie I can go without missing anything important.  Since I have Digital, there is always the problem of finding out too late that a movie on the fringe of my interest has already started.  The range would be something like 45 minutes for "Matrix Reloaded" and absol-freaking-zero for "Mulholland Drive".

         PTO   OK, so I've been on PTO (that's paid time off) for awhile and have recently become aware that there is a world outside of the cube I (too) rutinely inhabit.  It's funny, I'm only taking the time off because my company is forcing the issue.  And the more I take off, the more I don't want to come back...  I have a great tan (at least a great farmer's tan), am more relaxed and breezed through my workout today even though I haven't seen a gym in a week.  I realize that my golf game needs some specific work, my kids are more fun than my co-workers (even Greg that blogger everyone drools over at  urlLink Geese Aplenty ), and my wife appreciates my being around - all that gets attention when I take work out of the picture.  A priority restructuring is in order.

        Musings from NY  I want to wake up in a city that never sleeps...  It sucks being a non-native, non-connected guy in this town.  I found out that the city is completely different for an attractive 20 something girl (that gave me some great leads on clubs to hit) than a mediocre 30 something guy - so, unless you are a hot babe, never take a lead from a hot babe... I'm watching people dancing at The Whiskey and there was this seductive interaction of the music pushing people around the dance floor while the light clings to them...  The Whiskey in LA kicks ass all over the Whiskey in NY... The hookers in this town are not subtle...  Although it might go to bed a little later than most, the city does sleep... wussies.  There are unique and truly cool places in NY - go to the Cambell Apartment and have a smoke and a cocktail...  Times Square is shiny but is for tourists and ultimately sucks...The seafood is better than the steaks... The Italian is pretty damn good... The Hilton is a skanky hole - don't stay here.  There is a Sofitel a few blocks away and we all know that the Sofitel does not suck... Ever... Drunks are drunks everywhere... I'm 35 and I have totally uncool hair... using the word "totally" makes me uncool... Manhattan is a big place... The Ramones are nowhere to be found and neither is Lou Reed - can this really be NY?... Never come to NY without a coat and tie... Come to NY, bring Money... Stay up late, party hard, wake up and get to work...

        Pool Daze  It was hot here today. Really hot.  Africa Hot.  And, since we don’t have air conditioning I took a gang of kids to the pool to cool off.    While the pool is evacuated for “adult swim”, I take them to the snack bar.  You’ve been to this place – maybe not this one, but you’ve seen it at any of the millions of community pools or little league fields.  Staffed by a couple of high school kids, the menu is an impressive assortment of candy and soda with some other stuff thrown in to round out the selection.  We come upon a conversation already in progress… A grown-up lady is studying the ingredients on Starburst and giving the trio of teens the business.  Lines like “I can’t believe everything you sell here is so bad for you… and the quick retort, “it can’t be worse than all the other stuff that clogs your arteries out there…”  Through Extreme Air Heads, Jolly Ranchers, 3 kinds of Gummy thingies and many more, the rant continues. The teens steadily slide from the slight worry that a member (it’s a private pool) is upset to complete and utter disinterest.  Finally, she picks some candy for her kids and moves on.  While this whole exchange couldn’t have taken more than 5 or 10 minutes, the look on the kids faces in line was reminiscent of perestroika era bread lines.  As bad as they thought it was, they had no idea how insane and insidious this event really was.    An adult theatrically studying the ingredient lists on candy and unequivocally professing loud and long that they are indeed, “bad for you”… and demanding they stock only “healthy” alternatives… Well, no shit Sherlock!  It’s candy.  No one ever said it was "good for you" - as a matter of fact, the fact that it isn't "good for you" has been hammered home by every Mom since Eve...  It reminds me of a few years ago when anyone with vocal cords assumed it was their responsibility as tax paying citizens to inform me that smoking is dangerous and that I was working on killing myself with each successive puff of the fine Dominican cigars  I continue to enjoy but now only in private.  After getting past the urge to laugh out loud at this buffoon I had the impending feeling that the future might hold that this societal evil which inflicts untold (and unknown) amounts of pain and suffering will also be outlawed.    Innocents will no longer be taken advantage of by the large multi-national cartels who are funding diabolical laboratories doggedly pursuing flavinoids that will render even the most obedient pre-pubescent a loose cannon on the decks of our well scrubbed nation.  We must save them from themselves.  We must save them from us.

        New Car  There are plenty of four seat convertibles out there and I've settled on the BMW 3 series (preferably an M).  That's not so bad is it?  No.  The problem is I drive like a complete maniac and I expect that putting me in a BMW instead of a lowly Miata will get me a lot of those really nasty comments from other drivers.  If you drive a convertible you get used to watching other drivers who don't think that anyone can see them - and even though I can't hear through the glass, I can see them yelling.

        T3  As unlikely as it may seem, this was one of the best sequels I've seen in a long time.  And, Arnold looks pretty damn good for someone who can legitimately join AARP.

        They weren't even remotely interested  I called all the local newspapers and told them that I wasn't interested in recieving their paper...  30 minutes later I called them all back and asked for the decision maker of the office... I told them I wasn't interested in recieving their paper... I called back the next night and told them that I wouldn't be interested in getting the newspaper everyday for only the price of the Sunday paper... I was upset that I couldn't mispronounce their name so I called them all Mr. Minske - it's a made up name and it worked out great until Mr Minske from the Chronicle answered... Even though I was screwed on that one, over all it felt so good that I called four long distance companies to let them know that I was very happy with the one I've got... on a roll, I called the DNC, RNC, Libertarians, and the Green Party to let them know that I had forwarded all contributions to the local ASPCA - they were still confused after I told them that I could trust every "pound dog" and not one of "them slimey damn worms" they have been trying to get me to vote for... tomorrow I'm going to call up all the self help radio shows and act completely normal... I'll let you know how it goes.

        It's not my fault.  I'm in Orlando FL last week working a Trade Show and since I set-up quickly I had a night free.  So, instead of curling up in the wonderful bed the Westin had provided, I decide to go out and have a drink and a cigar.  Luckily for me, there is a little bar that caters to the specific kind of loser that I am.  Scotch and a cigar, pretty easy stuff.  Should have been in bed by 11.  Well, the story I'm about to tell you is centered around this one simple phrase "It's not my fault".  Read through and see if you agree.  I'm half way through the cigar when I order another drink.  I start talking to the bartender and the guy next to me starts up a conversation.  I'm in a good enough mood to start talking to the guy and he is pretty interesting.  I'm getting to the end of the cigar and almost ready to leave when the "musical act" kicks in.  These guys suck.  I mean really suck.  It's amazing people don't start crying they suck so bad.  I'm determined to leave as soon as I finish the 'gar.  Just then, a group of 20 somethings come in and take over the bar.  There were three couples and they started off by ordering something like three shots each.  One of the guys gets the guitar from the screeching loon who has been terrorizing our ears and he starts singing with one of the girls.  The guy is really pretty good - especially because he is making up the words to your favorite songs.  Everything was about someone in the bar and it was hilarious.    OK, I say.  I go and get another cigar and order another drink and settle in to watch the floor show.  It's not my fault that things are finally looking pretty good and the fun is starting.  Then the guy I was talking to says something like "you really like those things, don't you" and pointed to the gar.  "Yes", "Well, then I'll be right back".    So, I’m enjoying my second cigar and something like my fourth scotch when a couple of things start happening.  1.	I get buzzed – because of this the rest of the story is an approximation - hell the last part was too.   2.	The girls that came in with funny guitar guy start dancing around making Charlies Angels poses and ordering more drinks. 3.	The guy brings me a Macanudo (another gar)  This is definitely not my fault.  If this confluence of events hadn’t happened, I would be safely in bed at 1:00.  But, I couldn’t pass on the cigar (the guy actually left the bar to get it). The girls were drunk and dancing, and the guitar guy just started in on an Eddie Vedder impersonation.  I guess it’s important to know that in Orlando, the closing time is 2:00.  If you are in a bar that doesn’t exactly feel like that is a law that needs to be followed… well, then what follows can’t really be your fault, now can it.  The guy next to me starts buying my drinks and is talking to me about what the rest of his life is going to be like. The bartender is pouring shot after shot and I’m getting drunkerer and drunkerer.  Finally, the guitar guy and his crowd beat it and I realize It’s 3:00 and I need to be up at 5:30.  I pay my tab ($37.80) and get out of there.  I’m in my bed at 3:30 and seriously spun.  Two hours later I get up, dressed, and ready to go… yes, it’s a tough job but I did get to the golf course on time.  Our round went pretty well and we were getting back to the hotel to clean up and get ready to go to the event.    I got downstairs first and saw that the hotel had a Sunday brunch and it looked really good (anything looked good at that point) and so I decided to eat there.  My co-worker came down and we decided to sit at the bar and have the buffet.  It turns out that it was a Champagne buffet, but I decide that iced tea is the drink of choice as I try to push a little of last night out of my system.  It’s not my fault that the guy started serving really good champagne… there were three of us at the bar, Tony, Steve and Me, and we drank three bottles of champagne.    Just as we were finishing, a lady came up and started talking to Tony and soon we find out she is a musician and is going to have a show that night.  I asked her who she is and she tells me “Chantal  Somethingorother”. And I say “Cool, never heard of you – what kind of music?”.  She says “how about I invite you all to the show and you can see for yourself”.  I’m thinking “yeah, sure – right” but I give her my cell phone number anyway.    At the show, I get a call and sure enough – the passes are waiting at the door under my name.  I look to Steve and say “No Shit”.    We go to the show and well, it wasn’t really my thing – kinda mellow rock that makes my skin crawl.  I guess I wasn’t alone because soon Tony comes up to us and we exchange hello’s and the “I can’t believe she really is a rock star’s”.  And then he says, “Hey, my good friend is the executive chef at Emril’s – wanna go to dinner?”  This part is really not my fault… We go to Emeril’s  and get seated right away in the corner of the upstairs dining room.  A couple of appetizers come with the regards from the chef and we are under way… several dishes later it’s dessert time and we are closing in on 1:00 in the AM.    On the way home, Steve calls his wife and I hear him start the conversation, “ Honey, it’s not my fault”…

       I now have the ability to send an audio/video stream from my laptop with my wireless card - I am a traveling wireless TV station.    Just think of the possibilities people... it's "Me" wherever I go and whatever I do... tune in at 7:30 tonight when I floss.  It will be riveting.  I never do a good job on the back molars and you can cheer me on in the privacy of your own screen.

        Cruz-in  So I'm going to have lunch with Cruz BustedMonkey tomorrow.  Let me say that my first reaction was to support him for the Governorship but once I found out how many people have their hands up his ass, it became clear that he couldn't work in my best interest any more than that sell out GD could.    I have no idea what I'm going to say to the guy, but have you seen him?  Lunch has to be good, it looks like that guy can eat...  According to him, I'm rich.  Nothing new there, according to all politicians I'm rich... this makes me the fatted calf... just tell everyone you are going tax the living shit out of me and you might get elected...  man, lunch is going to be fun...

Who the hell does she think she's kidding?  I wanted to send a warning to Wilber, cause as soon as she gets home, she's eating the whole damn pig.  An ass like that needs maintenance.

        Oh, by the way  To the folks on the Oracle boat... yeah, if you need some crew... just let me know.  I saw your spinnaker in the water and quite frankly, that's some pretty shitty sailing for such a nice boat...

        Ass kicked  Sailing this Saturday with a new crew on a new boat... a much less experienced crew on a much smaller and faster boat... with a Skipper who is bent on getting his boat to go as fast as possible...  we crashed twice.  I've not been in a full breach (boat sideways in the water) before, and was working foredeck when it happened...  something about hanging from the mast and looking at nothing but green water changes your perspective on your recreational pursuits.  I have several large and painful bruises and have done some sort of damamge to my neck... let's take a minute to talk about inexperienced crew opening a hatch in the middle of a tack.  I'm in mid slide when, to my surprise, there is no boat underneath me.  Apparently, someone decided to open the hatch and stand in the middle of the boat... he soon had a 200 pound hat... I soon found myself head first in the galley... this same guy broke the boat in two places just trying to stay out of the water...    Obviously, we got our asses kicked - even the big cruisers finished ahead of us...  At least we had a nice day to sail...  and when we went fast, we really went fast... despite everything I said when I got to dry land, there will be a next time.

I'm there with my wife for her 20th reunion... man was that fun, all the folks she knew in high school... now they are all 20 years older and amazingly, so few of them have changed much...  the cheerleader types all ditched their hubbies and hung out together... everyone else just hung out, ate the dinner, checked out the old pictures, looked at the new pictures of the kids and left... "see ya' in another 10 years"... we'll see who got fat, bald, who got divorced and who still hasn't changed much... big fun.

        On the question of hair  The routine is always different, but it's always the same...  I'm in a strange town, all alone and... once I start thinking about it, I just can't stop myself... launch sequence activated...  I begin to act... I'll get slipped a note by the all knowing local and feverishly walk to the place... I quickly check in and wait my turn... plenty of magazines around to give me ideas of what I want them to do to me... plenty of time for me to get second thoughts... I don't even know these people... but one rule is understood - once you start, there is no backing out... I'm in it until it's over... I'll have to see through to the end... I'll need to live with myself and with what is about to happen and everyone will be able to see me... they will see what I've done and they will know... there is no predicting if it will be good or horrible but it will be with me for a long time... it's the excitement of the unknown and the thrill of the danger... it's not the cheating that gets to me... it's the knowing that no matter how good, I'll only get one chance... only one opportunity... it's a haircut... and if I'm lucky it'll be great.

         There I was just a walkin down the street  When I came across this big event that was a supporting people with breast cancer and those who were left behind.  There was a big speech by one of the city politicians and there were t-shirts strung around the plaza.  These shirts varied between corporate sponsored preprinted full-color shirts and simple white ones with scrawled  messages from a  Sharpie.  I found myself walking up and reading the shirts and quickly found myself needing to get the heck out of there quickly.  I'm not big on crying in public and I'll be damned if I wasn't about to do just that.  Today I went back and took this picture of  urlLink the fountain  which had been dyed pink as part of the "celebration".

I had to pretend I was Steve McQueen in Le Mans just to get through it... I often pretend I'm Steve McQueen... that's a different story.

        Merry Christmas  I know it's not exactly PC to use the term Christmas... We're supposed to say something like Happy Holidays, Seasons Greetings, or some other vapid little salutation... But I'm not.  While I seriously doubt that this was the day a certain Nazarene made a mess out of some stable in Bethlehem, I do believe there was someone in that manger and the message attributed to him is one that we should all remember when the stress, loneliness, and frustrations of the season start to get to us and we don't really treat our fellow man with the care and respect we should... And if the carrot of a world improved by our forgiving treatment of each other, remember the stick... wasn't it the Christians who conquered most of the world and converted most of what was left?  Who in their right mind would give short shrift to an organization like that?  Peace to you all.

        More from the road...  On the way to work on Friday I was listening to the radio "KFOG traffic... We are reporting a multiple car accident on the south bound 580 at the 13 on ramp..."  And just as I heard the news, it registers... I'm less than a minute away from that on ramp... And sure enough, I come around the bend and see a couple of cars, some cops and a blocked freeway.  So, here's where I get pissed off... The freeway is blocked BEFORE the on ramp... We SHOULD be moving at warp speed... But no.  I'm behind several people who have never seen bent metal before, and now was the best time for them to check it out.  I have a hint for all of the idiots driving the roads who have never seen a crashed car... Get your ass to a junk yard... Bring a sack lunch and spend the whole damn day... Bring the kids and call it an outing... Whatever it takes, get it out of your system.  Then, when you are on the road, you can happily skip on by when a couple of drivers can't seem to successfully get to work through the rain...

        Faking it  I'm home from work today because my daughter is faking the flu.  She doesn't know how I know, but she knows I'm on to her.  I was going to make her stay in bed all day, have nothing but water, 7Up and medicine but I couldn't take the whining.  So, she's watching Noggin, eating and drinking and generally not doing what she's supposed to today... Not like me, I'm sitting here watching Food Network, writing to my Blog and... OK, so maybe we're both playing hookey today... But it's not my fault.

        scared by clowns?  not me, but here's something really scary.  I saw a license plate frame that read "My other Saturn saved my life"... I know that a lot of people get in accidents every day and that safe cars are a good thing... What I didn't know was that Saturn takes it one step further and actually has a marketable accessory for drivers who for whatever reason have destroyed one and have come back for another...   Shouldn't we think this through?  If you just smashed up your car, and possibly someone elses in the process why don't we put you in a less safe car... Under no circumstances should you get anything big and/or well padded... how about a 1950's Subaru... then you'll need to be a more careful and conservative driver... or, at least the cars you keep sending to the scrap heap are less of a burden on the landfill... and you'll ber slightly less dangerous to the population...

        There are those who think that life has nothing left to chance  I found out today that a friend doesn't like Rush... Not a ground breaking revelation… but, in a very specific way… to me… it is.    See, I remember when Rush 2112 was released – the very day.  It was the first rock album I listened to at Marc’s house... the older, way cooler guy who lived next door... I was in grade school… he had a stack of Porno mags and a Camaro with custom paint and wheelie bars... trust me, nothing cooler... He invited me in to listen to it fresh from Licorice Pizza… drooling in front of his Marantz…   Who are those drummers? That’s Neil Pert. Neil Pert? Yeah. Who? Dude, he “KICKS ASS” on the drums…  Yeah?…  Dude, he’s so good he gets chicks… Shut up and give me the freaking Doritos…   Rush, so much more than mere  urlLink mystic altered-state phenomena …

        Raindrops keep falling on my head  Since migrating the boy to a "big-boy bed" for safety reasons... He was scaling the walls of his little prison and while it is pretty cute to watch we were sure that he was eventually going to break his neck.  We now have another problem... He has discovered freedom and he likes it.  We have had a little visitor each night for the last week.  Not such a bad thing - I'm sure he'll grow out of it.  And that he likes to snuggle is kinda nice too.  The problem is that he isn't fully potty trained and when he hops into bed there is an unmistakable smell that comes with him.

        Working from home  I've been working from home all week and the workload is light so I've been trying to get through some of the bigger projects that have been on my plate.  I was certain that I could get the Marketing Plan put together for 2004, file my expense report after reconfiguring my laptop, and then back up all my data.  What really happened is quite different.  Yes, I kept up with the emails and voice mails while working to keep a few projects on track... but just like when I'm "in the office" other things popped up... like trying to get my son potty trained, keep the house clean (or close to it) and keep the kids busy.  In a model of efficiency, I decided to go with the carrot and stick approach to potty training.  Alex gets as much candy as he can eat each day until he has an accident.  Then he gets none.  This plan worked out great for the first couple of days then he had an accident and I had to cut him off... this is tough stuff.  He knows the rule and even recited it "no accidents for candy" while pushing another Reeses peanut butter cup towards me.  Not only did I have to tell him no, I had to clean up the mess.  Overall, the plan is successful.  He has eaten about 4 pounds of candy per day, but he's only had one accident... he sleeps regularly, and his poop is OK... there are the bouts of mania that make me think of crack addicts, but all-in-all nothing that concerns me too much.  The big question is what will happen next - I'm going to run out of candy and he is not going to run out of piss.  I need to get an end game to this deal before the last lollypop stick hits the trash can.

       I thought I had a dream last night - my wife was telling me there was a pig running down our street.  When I woke up, she asked me if I saw the pig being chased by the neighbors dog.  Well, it's not everyday you get to see a wild pig being chased down your street and I can't believe I missed it.    I've learned my lesson: always be ready, you never know when a pig will come running down your street.

       After many years of toughing it out, my grandmother died today. She survived a lot of wild stuff in her days and after the stroke, the home stretch was no picnic.  But man, what a lady.  She survived WW2 on Malta and immigrated to the US soon after.    Her life as an immigrant (as anyone could guess) wasn't glamourous, but to me she always was.  Like only a grandma can, she loved to spend time with me and we spent hours upon hours playing Pinochole - a game reserved for her and the few family members who know that I can play, but mostly just for her.  When you are a kid, adults are awfully mysterious and the only thing that matters is when they want to spend time with you - and she often did.  She was always making sure we were well fed.  I was told long before I could know what it meant to never go without food because you never know when you will have to go without it.  Later, my grandfather told me some stories of what it was like to live on an island in a war.  So, I stopped complaining.  I guess there's a lot that will pass on with her, things like the lullabye that I can still hear her sing, but have no idea what it is because I don't understand Maltese (except for the things my grandfather used to call me).  The baked pasta that had the specific density of lead but tasted so good you always had at least two hunks.  The way she could smile and let you know that this old lady with one working leg can still see right through you and you aren't getting away with shit, so don't think that you are, but, it's OK because I'm not going to tell anybody.    Would have been nice if she could have lived longer, but she was done and I'm just damn lucky to have what I got which in the end was quite a bit.  If this whole post makes a little less sense than it should, it's because I need to get all the details together for the family to get to Detroit... probably for the last time as there isn't really a reason to go anymore.

       One on the things I picked up since moving to the liberally encrusted Bay Area is an interest in the shooting sports.  Yes, the most Republican of all hobbies.  What can I say, I love to shoot skeet.  There is a great challenge in it and I've met some really interesting people out there.    I hadn't been up to the field in over five years and was just going to have a little fun.  One of my friends had never shot before and he was plenty gutsy to go out there and give it a try in front of a group of regulars who were enjoying an afternoon beverage.  When we were done, he had the most excited look on his face and was smiling huge.  I don't know if he'll ever do it again, but I know he had a great time.
