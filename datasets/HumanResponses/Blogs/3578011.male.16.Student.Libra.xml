      Today our family got invited to go to the smith's home for lunch! not very often does the pastor's family get to go to other people's homes for Sunday lunch. Today will be a nice exception. Mr. Smith is the new president of Geneva college and he has a family of a lot of kids, he starts his job as pres. Tomorrow. after we get back I'm going to have to pack super fast for pine valley because staff training starts at 5!!!!! yay! I can't wait!  we have tons of new guys working there on the crew and I guess I'll meet the new counselors if we have any, we got most of them back for this summer. so that means I won't be posting on me blog til next Friday night or Saturday depending if we go to ghost riders or not.  So I guess I'll talk to you all then! I'll get the mailing address for the camp so you can send me letters and I can write back! So we can stay in touch. Well be praying for myself and the camp as a whole this summer, it will  be appreciated. peace out and keep it real brothers and sisters in christ i'll miss yall love you all Clinton Bettner

      well this is supossed to be for girls but oh well..... i had fun =-)  You're Element is Fire. You have a strong, independant, fiery personality and you obviously don't ley other's puch you around. You like being in charge and don't care what other people think. In fact, you like to stand out and be yourself. You're probably shy when people first meet you but your a ball of energy that could explode at any given moment. You like to laugh and whether you admit it or not, you like to fight. You're peronality that is wild and untamable. You're beauty is physically fit and a little sexy and you have a very pretty face.     urlLink   What's Your Element(girls)? (PICTURES)     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla

      well i finally have sometime to write(yay) i guess if i am going to write something i better write it!on wenesday i had the brilliant idea of putting new rims on my car, okay big deal, well they fit in every aspect except at full turning lock they would rub on the A-arm and i tried to just drive so it wouldn't, but that meant making WIDE turns. i was okay with that. But when i was driving with my friend( yes he's 21) we were two blocks from home and some how i ran over a piece of sheet metal and that completly destroyed one of the tires with a hole about an inch across so back to changing tires again to the spare tire. then last night i went to my freind and used his stuff to change the wheels back off to the stock rims... :-/ so the past week i've had drivers ed every morning but i dont go in til late today because it's my last day or something, but i really don't care because i got more sleep. but i've had a good time with the instructor, he's really nice and KOol. he hasn't said anything i need to change or work on , so i guess that's good right?  well now it's saturday and i got my driver's ed certifacation yesterday, YAY! I have my test shedauled for june 30th at 9am lets all pray that i pass. after shopping for clothes for the summer( sal val) i had to mow the high school before i could do anything else, so i quick did that and trimmed there... i have done this sooo many times this year already it getting boring real fast. after that i worked on my car and washed and detailed it. so now it's all clean but i'll have to work on the front splitter and wheel wells with some touch-up work. after that i went to car show in beaver falls where there were i would say 400+ cars down there and now my head hurts from wanting them all( well except the riced out crx and toyota pick-up) now i'm trying to firgure out what i'm going to do tonight since no one is home and i can't drive YET...

       urlLink Blogger: Login Hot Tan  You've heard it, you've seen, in fact, you most likely indulge yourself in this new fad- Tanning. Most all girls do it, heck, while over hearing a conversation between two girls and a guy (luck dude), the subject of a girl becoming a real girl because she started tanning came up. Now I don't really know where this whole thing with becoming a real girl comes from, but that is besides the point of this post.  As our generation realizes that the opposite sex is apealing (I hope it's the opposite sex), we begin to come about ourselves with a great fervour to make ourselves look good. Now one of the things, tanning, has been something very hot lately for girls. Now as a guy, I do not tan, in fact, in order to stash my body in a metal box and zap it with a couple thousand volts of radiation, you're gonna need to be pretty buff and have a couple buff friends with you... But onto TANNing.  Tanning, temporarily makes you look sexy, hot, drop dead gorgous, ect. However, the key word was temporarily- tanning itself will ruin your immune system. Ah, yes, the immune system, something that if destroyed could ruin your day (so to speak). but hey, tanning beds are safer then tanning outside, right? Wrong. Both are equally harmful. [Read more]  So in a few years, you hot sexy ladies will look like grandmothers, no offense, you're still good looking as of June 7, 2003.
