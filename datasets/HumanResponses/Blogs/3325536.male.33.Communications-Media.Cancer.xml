      At the end of a true three week Italian soap opera, the  urlLink Giro d'Italia  went to 22 year old Damiano Cunego. What a turn up for the books! The Kid beat his team captain and two-time(ing) Giro winner Gilberto Simoni, who it has to be said wasn't all that happy about it. Gibo ended up third behind The Kid and Serguei/Serhei/Serhiy/Serge Gonchar/Honchar/Hontchar/Gontchar/Gontsjar/Suit. My knowledge of Ukrainian/Russian transliteration has taken a big leap as you can see. Officially it's Serhei Honchar but I think he's actually of Russian ethnicity and prefers spelling it Gonchar, no matter what the Ukrainian government says.  Back to the soap. In  urlLink Stage 19 , Gibo made a pact with the Devil, a.k.a. Stefano Garzelli, who's on a different team, and the pair attacked on the first climb of the day and effectively isolated The Kid. Gibo needed 3'07 lead over Cunego to win the Giro but luckily for The Kid, G(H)on(t)char worked his arse off to save his second place, so Gibo only ended up gaining 50 seconds. And Garzelli won the stage anyway so poor ol' Gibo got flicked for both the stage win *and* the GC. But he called Cunego a bastard after  urlLink Stage 18  so he probably deserved it.  It was fun watching all the drama unfold at the end. It made it the least boring Giro for a few years. Still a whole lotta work voor mij en de hele gang.  By the way, the Vittoria Open Corsa CX that I so wisely invested in the other day blew off the rim on Saturday. Oops. Not a good start. I did put 130 psi in it so that was probably a bit much. I'll stick with 23 psi from now on. It rained today. Why does it rain on Sunday?  It's another public holiday tomorrow so I'll race in Bottelare. Hopefully no punctures this time!  Alas, my chocolate icecream investment venture has ended in disaster after all the stocks mysteriously devalued and completely vanished from the fridge. It must be that rat or possum. I will set an even more cunning trap tomorrow after I have replenished the stores. The same thing happened with the vanilla icecream that I bought to replace the chocolate. Strange. There are Evil Forces at work in my fridge. Anyone who has seen it will know what I mean.  I have learned many things this week, aside from Ukrainian/Russian transliteration but I'm too tired now to zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz.......

      I have made several valuable investments in the past week, in order to guarantee my future in this world. The first one was in a packet of brazil nuts, which as we all know are very high in selenium. I am now in no danger whatsover of being selenium deficient, so I regard this as a highly valuable investment. And I've still got half of the packet of brazil nuts left. Quelle miracle.  Speaking of food, I had to make a rather hasty investment in some chocolate ice cream today, as my stocks had mysteriously run empty, despite having been renewed a mere TWO DAYS AGO. Probably a rat or a possum. I've set up a cunning rat trap near the fridge consisting of a bowl with a spoon resting inside the bowl. The unsuspecting rat will open the freezer, scoop out a chunk of dark chocolate ice cream and scoff the lot. In the morning, I'll be able to tell  which rat it was  because one will be fatter than the others. Cunning, eh? I'm quite proud of this trap and have submitted it to the Gent Rat Traps Patent Board, Pty. Ltd.  In the non-food dept., I was forced to splurge, er, invest in a Vittoria Corsa CX Open Tubular, due to the fact that my trusty Maxxis Columbiere (sic) is past its use by date. Must have clocked up about 4-5015 km on the thing, and I should have...retired it before yesterday's race in Bredene (near Oostende). It was a nice easy 7.8 km course, very fast, and I felt quite good, but unfortunately I hit a rock or something on the second lap and it was all over. Dang. Rode 65 km home so I least I didn't waste the day. I'll try again in Bottelare, which is quite close to Gent, next Monday.  While investing in the Vittoria Corsa CX Open Tubular, I decided to pick up a pair of Pearl Izumi bib knicks. I've heard good things about PI, so we'll see how long they last. My Campag Techno and my Bergamo knicks (both freebies) are in fairly good condition, but my other pairs are wearing a tad too thin.  Giro news. Three days to go and it's still not decided. The Kid, a.k.a. Damiano Cunego, took the lead in  urlLink Stage 16  from Popovych with an absolutely brilliant move with 60 km to go. His team captain Gibo Simoni, who is scripted to win the Giro, had to play second fiddle again. Gibo has two stages to show the young upstart who's boss, but I don't think Cunego will let him get away with it.    urlLink Today  it was the Russian AK47, Pavel Tonkov, who mowed everyone down and really stuck it to them. His victory salute was the first time I've seen anyone use a rude gesture when they've won a big stage. Tonkov had a few paybacks to make today.  Movie watch: I invested in a ticket to see  urlLink Starksy and Hutch  the other week. My expectations weren't great (but I did have them) and they were met by this piece of celluloid. It was amusing. It probably would have been more amusing if a) I hadn't seen the trailer giving away the best bits and b) I'd seen the original show at least once. Good for a laugh.  After the Giro I might actually fiddle around with this Bilgespot template. I'll add a golf links on the left hand side, which means I can duck out during lunchtime and scare a few birds with the pitching wedge. The golf links will in no way be related to the past/present/future conflagration in Iraq.   That reminds me, it's  urlLink google  time: Golf. Audi. Shouldn't there be five rings? Olympics. Athens. Marathon. Troy. Achilles (why didn't they let go of his foot anyway?). Styx. Anywhere north, west or south of Paramatta. Please note the Greek context.  Tot volgende keer, Jeff

      There's a lot happening in May. Allez  urlLink Chavanel ,  urlLink Lance ,  urlLink Jensy ,  urlLink Petacchi & Popovych  enzovoort. Nog zes etappen in de Giro en dan...iets verlichting. Why am I writing in single Dutch? Something to do with tiredness.  This morning: 6:40 am start. Why? To meet the bunch in Berchem. Even a cup of coffee and a cup of tea did nothing to wake me up and I was asleep for the first 60km (and also the last 40km coming home). Luckily it's generally a straight line coming back. I woke up in the middle bit in order to avoid a repeat of last week. THIS time there was no red-lining it for 20 minutes, merely an acceleration or two on the final climbs, always within my limits. Stayed with the kopgroep fairly comfortably today. Did I mention it rained all the way out and all the way back? No? Well it did. The light motregen that Belgium is famous for. Like water for chocolate. That damned north wind.  Had a kip on the couch following the Giro stage and then assumed the position for the rest of the evening in front of the keyboard. As I said, there's a lot happening in May. I'm resultsed out. At least it's mindless.   A note on Saturday: 35 km/h average on the Trap Op (3km at 2.7%). Roughly 400-420W for 5'10 for whoever was in front. Oooowww. And I was sitting on!    A blogservation People, please consider your dear reader at least a little bit when you create your blog. None of this brown writing on black background with faded image crapola. Or puce on pink with a floral splash and gold curlicues around the edges. IT'S BLOODY HARD TO READ.  I know most stuff, especially what I write here, isn't worth reading anyway, but at least give us a fighting chance. What's wrong with DARK letters on a WHITE background. Black and white co-existing peacefully, no apartheid. See, it can work? Why am I ranting like this? Because it's 14 minutes past 1am and I don't care. Normally I would write it as 1:14am.  To finish with, some keywords for  urlLink google  to pick up: George W Bush fell off his bike today. What a goose! Cannot find weapons of mass destruction. Iraq. Saddam. King Hussein of Michael Jordan. Just Do It. Nike. Lance. Guineviere. The Knights who say Ni. Elderberries. Hamster. Smiley, Ace of Spies. Bet no-one will google all that.  Ik slap.

      Well due to the fact that it was Hemelvaart (Ascension) today, there were no shops open so I couldn't buy any chocolate ice cream. Instead, being the heathen I am, I decided to race out at Destelbergen, which is 10 km from my place. I did this race last year and finished it ok as it's a fairly fast course (14 x 8.3 km laps) so why not have another go?  Why not indeed, although timing was fairly crucial today as I had to do a lot of work: news this morning plus almost six hours of results/pics posting this evening. And of course a blog update :-) Speaking of pics, scroll down the page to the Ultimate Bike Racing Experience or  urlLink have a look at it here  as I've added some pics from that crazy, freezing, sickness inducing race in the rain in Hooglede. Thanks to CN's occasional Japanese correspondent Miwako of course!  It was a beautifully warm day today with a moderate breeze blowing, so I was surprised that there were only 63 starters. It seemed like more than that but it always does. I think there were 90-odd last year, and that helps make the race a bit quicker and more free flowing. Fewer starters can mean a really tough race at the beginning, and I got sucked into chasing several moves on the first lap, until I forced myself to go to the back because my HR was sitting in the mid-180's (max is about 190). The mind was willing but the flesh was weak. I don't think I could keep that up all day. Even sitting in the bunch I was often in the red zone (averaged 172 for the race = two and three quarter hours), so I'm not quite back to full operational capacity after the dreaded lurgi and/or spon last week.   urlLink     HRM graph for the race in Destelbergen. Ouch.   So from somewhere near the back (again) I watched the race play out. A group of 12 had gotten away and had 50 seconds lead after about 5 laps, so I thought it was all over, as our bunch didn't look as if it was really up to it. Thus I was surprised when a few guys in yellow and red drove it for about 3 laps to get the leaders back to 15 seconds. A concerted chase rarely happens in a kermesse. It's normally just attack, attack, attack.  When we got close, the bunch blew apart as various riders tried to get across to the front. I was already starting to feel the twinges of cramp - I was a bit dehydrated apart from being out of condition today - so I did what I could and ended up in a third group chasing about 20. Our group didn't work particularly well and that was a source of annoyance to one of the other Aussies in it. Actually there were three of us, all riding for different teams but all cooperating perfectly due to nationality :-) It didn't matter that they had teammates in the break(s)!  So it went on. In the last 40 km I must have gone with 80 percent of the moves and did a lot of work in front, which was good training. But if we had six guys - including the two Aussies - at least two of them would sit on and the break just wouldn't go. It's totally illogical and doesn't get you a top place, but that's how they race here so I have come to accept it in a Zen-like manner. Calm blue ocean.  Attacked on the last lap in pursuit of 4 guys (see flat bit of HRM curve at 180+ near the end - my feet cramped then) but the bunch regrouped in twos and threes. That was bloody hard.  We ended up sprinting for 21st and although I moved up to about 5th wheel with 100m to go before the last corner, I cramped in both legs and couldn't do anything but go backwards. Ended up somewhere between 35th and 40th but I finished, which was the object of the exercise. 116 km in 2:45 @ 42.3 km/h. That's three outta three races so far that I've completed with the bunch so I gotta be happy with that.   No bike problems today. Woo hoo!  Sickness update: sore throat is still extant, but I got some nasal spray which I seem to remember fixed it last year. If your nose is infected it doesn't actually hurt but instead it irritates your throat. Cool, huh? I could be a doctor. Let us first see if this self-diagnosis is on the money.  A bientot, Jeff

      It's Giro rest day and that is a good thing. It's always fairly manic getting through the first 10 days, especially with all the other races on in May. Why does every man and his dog hold races now? Something to do with the sun I guess.  Speaking of sun, it has been ridiculously good weather in België for the last couple of days. Yesterday was 27 and today was 23-24 degrees, sunny and almost zero wind. Of course I went out for rides both days, although I took it very easy on Monday after the weekend's exertions. Today (Tuesday) I'd normally do 150-160 km, but cut it down to 135 km as I didn't want to go completely overboard, despite the fact that I'm feeling a lot more over the weather. Still a slight sore throat, but the dry cough has all but disappeared and my heart rate has dropped another 10 beats and is getting down into normal territory.   Extremely tedious description of a training ride follows   Today I thought I'd cruise out with the bunch along the Schelde to Oudenaarde and back, then do a bit extra in the hills. I didn't plan on doing much at the front though! We normally take it a bit easy going out, but today there were three guys who decided to take off before halfway, and that led to a slight increase in pace. They had about a minute at the turnaround, and there was a Palmans U23 rider in the bunch who saw that two of his mates were in the break, so he took it upon himself to chase them down. Verily, a noble fellow.  If you look closely at the HRM graph (I'll try to get these sharper), you'll note that the speed suddenly increased at the 17 km mark. This Palmans guy was on the front for 5 km, doing between 45 and 50 km/h with a very, very light tailwind. Jeez. Needless to say, the break was brought back. Then he proceeded to continually attack us all the way back to Gent. Attacking is normal, as this part of the ride is considered a race. I was - from a distance - impressed by his persistence.   urlLink     HRM/speed/altitude graph for May 18   He was toying with us, but it kept the speed quite high and we averaged 44.2 km/h coming back, which is not bad. Towards the end, he had a bit of a gap with a couple of other guys, so I broke my pledge of not doing any work and pulled what was left of the bunch up to him at 50 km/h. My turn was pretty short :-) You see, you can't let these young 'uns beat you.  That was about 1.5 km from the "sprint", so I dropped back to try and recover, found a wheel and stuck to it. It's always a long leadout with no real aim but to go fast, and we slowly edged it up from 50 to 55 km/h with a few hundred metres to go. Most of the riders in front of me had spent their bikkies doing this, so I ended up in about fourth wheel. And there I stayed, because when I got out of the saddle to try and produce more power/speed, I went nowhere.   If I could extract another 9 km/h and a ridculously large number of watts, then I could beat Petacchi, who has so far won 4 Giro stages and was clocked at 64 km/h coming across the line the other day. What a dude.  As always, this is good training for bunch sprints, and I think I should be back to where I was before by next week. Want to race on Thursday on Hemelvaart (Ascension Day) in Destelbergen, so didn't want to overcook it today. I did three more hills afterwards and cruised back along the Schelde at 36-37 km/h, feeling like I was doing a normal training ride.  Well, that's my ride for the day in detail. This posting is for my benefit more than anyone else's, so I make no apologies for being mind-numbingly boring. I will post some more interesting, non-bike related stuff, but not now.  Tot volgende keer.

      This entry is in Real Time (tm) because I've now more or less caught up with the previous updates that I wanted to include on this bilgestripe. But as we all know, time is an illusion and can sometimes move in a mysterious way. Enough of 't preamble.    Possibly  as a result of the Ultimate Bike Racing experience less than two weeks ago in the freezing cold in Hooglede, I got sick. Fancy that. I wonder how that could have happened? I always cease to amaze myself.  So Tuesday (May 4) I raced (in the wet), then again on Thursday (in the dry, very fast) and by Saturday I was feeling a bit under the weather, which was not surprising as it was wet and I did three hours by myself. The weather was very much on top.  On Sunday I woke up feeling very poorly so I skipped the really early morning ride in favour of another session on the Schelde. 120km compared to 160km. Vive le difference. Of course I went much harder than I intended and by Sunday night things weren't lookin' too hot on the sore throat/headache front. I did an easy ride on Monday before visiting the doctor who told me I was sick and that would be &euro;36. Then I had to traipse around Gent to find a night chemist and get him to sell me some sinutabs + lidocaine lollies which didn't taste so good.  The rest of the week was a write off, but I cracked and went out for a ride with the bunch on Saturday and Sunday. Bloody hell, four days off plus a virus and sinutabs saw me dangling on the back with my HR at 15-20 beats higher than normal. Sunday was just as bad, except towards the end of the ride there was no bunch and I had to drop off the kopgroep on one of the last climbs, only to spend the next 20 minutes at the wrong end of the red zone trying to chase the two leaders. It felt weird to be going that hard - even in the races a couple of weeks ago I wasn't sustaining that kind of HR for that long.   Didn't get 'em of course.   urlLink     Heart rate/speed/altitude graph for Sunday   Now the headache has gone but I have the good ol' dry cough that follows a cold and will hang around for the next few weeks, no matter what I do or have done (I know this from past experience). Maybe I'll get some more stuff for it. I'm going to avoid anything with pseudoephedrine in it from now on, a) because it's banned in cycling and b) if it raises my heartrate by that much then I don't think it's a good thing. Boom-bity-boom-bity-boom-bity-boom-bity-boom-bity-boom-bity-boom-boom-boom.  I think I need sleep.

      ALERT! Your Norton anti-virus checker has detected a whole lotta garbage about a bike race in the following email. It has been quarantined for your safety. Except this bit, which probably shoulda been:   Jeff's Ultimate Bike Racing Experience (tm) It's not that easy to describe, and it didn't have anything to do with winning - which is not the primary reason I race a bike anyway. But today I believe I had the Ultimate Bike Racing Experience (tm).  Background: I got my first ever Belgian racing licence last week, and was very chuffed with it. It's about a tenth the price of an Aussie one, because the insurance isn't totally ridiculous. As I have a permanent address here, it makes sense for me to have a Belgian licence. As soon as I got it, I was plotting what races I could do in the rather short space of time between now and the Giro d'Italia, which starts on Saturday.  I selected one in Hooglede in West Flanders, mainly because it was the only one remotely in my area (50 km hence) and it also corresponded with my Day Off. Coincidentally, two Japanese journalist friends of mine - Miwako and Junko - live in Hooglede, so I let them know and they came out and provided Official Encouragement, which was tres cool and quite funny.  I had a cursory look at the weather forecast this morning and it didn't seem too bad: some rain, clearing in the afternoon with strong winds from the SSW. After several weeks of fantastic weather here (15-20+ degrees, sun, not too much wind), I was lulled into a false sense of optimism about today. I should know better. At least I packed a woollen jersey and arm warmers just in case...  As I got on the train from Gent to Lichtervelde, the first drops of rain began to fall, and by the time we got to Deinze it was blowing a gale and raining more or less horizontally. Completely deterred, I remained on the train to Lichtervelde, which was about 8 km from Hooglede. Fastening my cycling shoes, I merrily set off into the driving rain/block headwind and amazingly didn't get lost, just somewhat frozen. Sign on was at the Cafe Lanterne in Ieperstraat, which was at least warm inside. I took number 76, which surprised me as I didn't expect that there would be so many other loonies lining up to race when it was 8 degrees, wet, with a rather significant wind chill factor.  This strange fact can be explained. a) This is Belgium - more specifically West Flanders. If you don't like racing in this weather then you may as well hang up the bike. b) This was the only race on today in the area. I'd guess if it was dry, we would have had closer to 150 starters rather than 81.  I was bloody cold by this stage, and shivered my way up to the change rooms in the local school, where I bumped into the Americans from the Cycling Center(tm) in Hertsberge. I'd actually interviewed a few of them last week for a feature, which I'll get round to one of these days. I said g'day to Bernard (the boss) and - feeling foolishly underprepared - asked to borrow some safety pins to pin on my number. No probs and I was very grateful for these small, but very necessary items.  I opted to wear the old blue woollen jersey with arm warmers, but no leg warmers. I put my faith in my Strength 3 warm up oil instead. How stupid am I? I should have worn two jerseys, but I wanted to keep one for the ride home, which I expected I would be doing fairly soon as I had no intention of lasting more than 3 laps in the race. I can train in cold and rain, but racing and cornering in it are generally out of my league. As a rule, I tend to corner as well as a 4 tonne truck, but I think I've improved a little after my experience on the Tour moto last year.  Feeling ridiculously underdressed, I ventured outside again, hopped on the bike and almost shuddered to death riding down to the start. Attempted to warm up, but that just made me colder. It was too late to put on my other jersey and leg warmers, so I just put on a rictus grin and bore it like the idiot I am.  I saw Miwako and Junko and a sightseeing friend of theirs (sorry, forgot her name) on the start line and they burst out laughing, not believing that I turned up in this weather to race. I explained to them that 3 laps would be good for me today, an hour at the most. But there was no time for chatting as the whistle blew and we were off.   urlLink     Racing in Hooglede &copy; Miwako Sasaki   The course was just under 5 km, with about 10 corners a lap and an uphill finishing straight which kept going - even conveniently passing the change rooms at one point. There were two particularly nasty corners - less than 90 degrees, paved (not cobbled), and one of them had a round metal plate slap bang in the middle!! Argh! I only saw one crash on it though, which was amazing. My back wheel slipped on it at least three times when I pedalled too early out of the corner, but it was recoverable. Early on I was losing a lot of time sprinting out of those corners, which is typical for me. Good sprinting practice though.  I deliberately started at the back to stay out of trouble and not get in anyone's way. Sure there were strong crosswind sections in bits of it, but it was just as hard at the back as it was in the middle, and you didn't have to fight for your position :-) Also I didn't have to worry about missing the break, because by remaining at the back I was *guaranteed* to miss it! Takes all the pressure off, see?  Once we got going I didn't feel the cold any more, although the wind, rain, and the spray from everyone's wheels made it very difficult to see. It would have been worse with sunglasses on, as I don't have any clear lenses. I think I've removed all the grit from my eyes now.  As normal, it was hard going for the first few laps, and I was definitely suffering by the third lap up the finishing straight. But I was trying to enjoy it and relax, because racing in appalling conditions in Flanders, cheered on by two Japanese journalists and their friend and a grim, but appreciative crowd of West Flemings in cycling's heartland is really what its all about. As I said at the top, it's difficult to describe without doing it, but for a foreigner it's just an incredible experience. Wet and dirty too.  The first hour was quite hard, but somehow I had survived being shelled out the back of the now slightly reduced peloton. Whenever I had bothered to lift my eyes from the back wheel in front of me, I could see a long, thin line of riders, with a group always dangling 10-20 seconds off the front. I think this group actually stayed clear, although I deluded myself into thinking that our bunch was "it" and we were racing for first. Wow - the power of the mind! The truth of the matter was that the leaders were so far in front that we couldn't see them any more :-)  After about 50 km, I could see that things were slowing down enough and gaps were starting to appear in the bunch. This is generally a good time to move up and start to play a more interactive role in the race, instead of being a UN observer at the back (at least I didn't get shot at). By this stage the race for the first 23 was actually over, even though I didn't realise it. Our bunch had been reduced to about 40, and kept getting thinner as the laps wore on.   urlLink     Getting dirtier in Hooglede &copy; Miwako Sasaki   The hands were a tad chilly by now, which made shifting even worse than before. My derailleur has all but packed it in so I have to shift twice, then back one to go down a gear. I'll get a "new" second hand one tomorrow. But for some reason I was still forcing myself to enjoy it, turning off the fear mechanism in order to get round these ridiculous corners.  Groups of four or five were going off the front at regular intervals, and a couple of times I put in a few solo efforts to bridge up to them. All that training trying to catch the Schelde bunch in the mornings because I'm always late paid off. I'd end up in a break that wouldn't work because that's the way racing goes here. But each time we were caught by fewer and fewer riders, until there were only about 20 of us left with 10 laps to go.   The race commissaire drove up and checked all our numbers, which means that our race was probably due to end soon. By this stage I'd sort of realised that we weren't actually racing for first. I missed the moves that actually got away in the next few laps, and went with all the ones that got caught. But that didn't really bother me.  With about 5 laps to go, I followed a guy who attacked in the crosswind on the second last straight, and he actually towed me just about all the way to the finish line without even looking round. Then he sprinted and I simply couldn't follow him. I'll catch him at the top of the hill, I thought. Then another couple of guys sprinted past me, and I looked up through the grit in my eyes and saw the finish line official waving the red flag for the end of the race. Oops. I "sprinted" - and I use the term in the loosest possible sense - and ended up fifth of what was left of our group. All up, 94 km at a "slow" average of 39 km/h, but I think there were...extenuating circumstances. Even the winner didn't average much more than 40, whereas the norm here is 43+.  For me, it was very cool to last that long, and I later discovered I finished 30th i.e. just in the money (although I ended up 10 euros down for the day due to train travel. LOL.). While waiting for my prize money at the Cafe Lanterne, I had a post-race coffee, mainly because it came with a small biscuit. The caffeine was wasted on me though. I even managed to explain in my rudimentary Dutch to one of the many old men in the cafe, where I lived, where I finished, and - most importantly - how much my bike weighed. I've said it before, but it's very fine to be in a country where cycling is so ingrained.  My plans of riding back to Gent (which had now been changed to riding back to Lichtervelde station) were derailed even further by Miwako and Junko and their friend, who insisted I throw the bike in Junko's car and go back to their place for a hot chocolate. Arrrrhhhhhh. Now that is an offer that no-one in their right mind would refuse, and even though I wasn't in my right mind, I still didn't refuse.   It turned out better than that. Not only was there a warm fire, hot chocolate and coffee, Junko whipped up a large batch of pannekoeken and a few toasted ham and cheese sandwiches...Arrrrhhhhhh. It *really* doesn't get any better than this!   After chatting for a couple of hours, we bundled back into Junko's car and they gave me a lift to the station. Very cool people.   There you have it, Jeff's Ultimate Bike Racing Experience (tm).

      [note: here's another of my previous email updates, specially formatted for this bilgespot]  G'day all from sunny Orstraylya, where I am spending November/December/January to get away from a fair chunk of the European winter. Pretty sneaky huh? I'm sure it'll catch up with me one day and I'll be posted to Antarctica to cover the cyclo-cross scene, and I'll end up living one long winter...I can just picture myself putting the booties on to go out in a -50 degree snowstorm for a quick spin across the Ross Ice Shelf and up Mt McClintock: "I'm going out. I may be some time."  I'm hoping that this email will reach you faster than a Christmas card, which - coming from me - may also be some time. So that means I can wish you all a very Merry Christmas in the language of your choice *before* December 25. Now that's what I call organised. And if you read this now, you get a Happy New Year thrown in absolutely free of charge, even though it's more than two weeks away. That's the power of the internet for you, bringing fast greetings to those who just can't wait. Book now for 2004.  That's the formal part of this Christmas letter done for, now to the more frivolous stuff. The format is quite modular so you can ignore the boringly titled sections and skip to the end where there's nothing remotely interesting.   What I did during the holidays I took three weeks off at the beginning of December and used the time extremely wisely. The first week was spent in the company of my mother and great aunt cruising up to the Hunter Valley and beyond for several days of relative isolation (pardon the pun). No laptop, mobile didn't work, no TV to speak of and a lot of peace and quiet.    urlLink     Truly, this is champagne comedy   Although I really like living in Belgium, I'm definitely appreciating Australia more when I come back home for these all too brief visits. We were only a few hundred kilometres away from Sydney, but most of the countryside was completely new to me. The first couple of days were spent at a nice little cottage in Sandy Hollow (which had a spa...), and I could ride down into the Wollemi National Park on a semi-flat tyre due to me not bringing a working pump. The roads were rough but the scenery was certainly worth it. Plus a winery or two.  The next couple of days were spent in another cottage near Ilford, which is between Mudgee and Lithgow. I had a great ride (still on a semi-flat tyre) out to Sofala and beyond, then back to Ilford and down into the Capertee Valley where I met up with Ma and Aunt Margaret at a friend's place in the valley. The ride was memorable and tres scenic, mainly due to the hills. There are lots in that area, and most of them are 4-5 km. At least I ended up at a much lower altitude than I started (cheating I know). Then we spent the afternoon watching a big storm roll across the Capertee Valley which was rather spectacular. I've attached a pic to illustrate.   urlLink     The Capertee Valley   We headed back to Sydney via Mt Tomah, where we didn't see the botanical gardens due to the rain and fog, but had a really good lunch in the restaurant there. Definitely recommended! I've attached a pic of the sundial on Mt Tomah which wasn't being put to much use that day.   urlLink     Mt. Tomah Botanic Gardens    Colourful Sydney racing identity report While I certainly haven't reached (nor do I want to) the status of Dr. Bob Hampshire as the ultimate "colourful Sydney racing identity", it's hard to conceal the fact that I work for a particularly well known cycling website. I even have a jersey which reflects this, and if you look really really hard and can work out that I'm not a member of the Tasmanian Institute of Sport. We'll have a better Cyclingnews jersey soon. Anyway I just hope this doesn't lead to the excesses that Dr. Bob is so fondly remembered for. We'll see in 20 years or so...  I've actually been racing a fair bit since I got back - over 20 races in less than two months or about three times per week. They are mostly an hour or less, so recovery is not really a problem. I've been pleasantly surprised with the results: no wins, but 5 (or 8, if you ignore handicaps and just count A grade placings) second placings and a smattering of third placings. Not quite enough to break even on the race entry fees :-). But I've been able to consistently finish and factor in the Tuesday night races in A grade at Heffron Park, which have always been my nemesis. There was even a third place one week when not many people turned up :-)   To put this into context, I have to go back to the beginning of 1999 when I was able to finish more than one Tuesday in a row! Doing more racing in Belgium this year has certainly helped, and I also modified the October training plan to build up the "aerobic engine". I'm definitely happy with the results, and maybe I'll be able to convert one of these second places into a win. I'm always being beaten by the kiddies though! Even their restricted gears don't slow them down.   Fun stuff The rest of the holidays have been spent doing fun things like tax, visiting the dentist and getting a slightly twisted pelvis straightened by a masseur and a physio, who are total geniuses I must say. The masseur just flicked parts of my feet and collarbone and lo! I was straight again. Then he started the massage. He's got a specially built metal cage so he can use some/all of his body weight to massage you. But he relied on his elbows when doing my iliotibial bands, which probably haven't been massaged for seven years or so. Those cyclists who've had this done to them know how painful this is, because their ITBs are so tight it's ridiculous. I have one more session with him.   More fun stuff  I'm recovering from an Overload of Fun after three birthday parties in three consecutive days. Fortunately there was cake at only one of them, otherwise my stomach would have rebelled. Thinks: must learn the concept of pacing oneself through slices of cake. Having cake for dinner is a no-no and can lead to Cake O.D., which can only be fixed by a lot of beer and a 150 km ride.   There is not much to report on the subject of movie reviews, as I've only seen a couple of flicks since I got back. This is probably a good thing because the movies in question were Matrix Revolutions and Kill Bill (Vol. 1). I had to see the former because I've already seen the first two and this one does at least round off the plot. It gets a bonus point for being filmed in Sydney: the final scene is in the Botanic Gardens, which is kind of a weird way to finish off a three part blockbuster but at least it's something different. I won't give away the rest of the plot because I can't really remember it that well, but there was a lot of action/fighting/martial arts/biff/bang/pow/death stuff which will please the connoisseurs of the genre.  I didn't really know what to expect with Quentin Tarantino's latest offering, Kill Bill (Vol. 1), which starred Uma Thurman wielding a very sharp samurai sword. But that alone was enough to get me to spend my hard earned $14.00 on going to see it. For more bonus points, it had Lucy Liu, Darryl Hannah, Vivica A. Fox as members of the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad, David Carradine's voice as Bill, and a very cool intro song (Bang Bang/Nancy Sinatra). I suspect there was rather a lot of tomato sauce used during the filming, as this flick is even *more* violent and slightly less tasteful than Pulp Fiction. If you go slightly queasy at the sight of a rare steak then this is a film for laying down and avoiding.  Other than that it was quite well done, and any Tarantino fan will like it. There is a Vol. 2 to be released early next year, which will conclude it. The plot is fairly comic book in style and involves The Bride (Uma Thurman) carrying a bit of a grudge against her former boss, Bill, who together with members of the Deadly Viper Assasination Squad, tried to kill her on her wedding day. She eventually wakes up from her coma and is rather annoyed at said squad members. Understandable really.   One day I'll see a movie that doesn't involve excessive amounts of violence, but next up will be the Lord of the Rings finale, so I think that might contain a bit of sword action. I hope they don't change too many important parts of the plot for no reason. In the book there was no battle detailed in Osgiliath, dammit!  Speaking of books, I've read the latest and biggest Harry Potter (Order of the Phoenix) and quite enjoyed it. I had to re-read the two preceding books to refresh my memory of who all the characters were and which side they were on but I think I'm up to date now and able to hold my own in any Harry Potter related conversation with the kiddies. I've also been working my way through more of Terry Pratchett's Discworld series which is very funny, and any other books that happen to come my way.   The last paragraph If you've read this far then your boss is probably getting annoyed by now. If you haven't read this far, or have taken advantage of the modular format and ignored most of this email, then you are to be highly commended!  Love to all,  Jeff

Welcome to my March/April newsletter update thingy, which has to be sent here and now to avoid problems with time dilation. That Einstein chap has a lot to answer for I reckon.   For those of you who are new to this circular, the best way to read it is to press "Ctrl + A" on your keyboard, or select the entire body of the email with your mouse, and then press the "Del" key. This will ensure you get the best bits of the email, which are all hidden in the subject line. Alternatively, the Modular Format (tm) means that you can apply this technique to any section.   urlLink     Bikes in Gent   Anyway I'm sittin' here, listening to some muzak, pining for my dear bicycle, which has been in a local bike shop for the last 8 days and four hours(!!!) and counting, all because I wanted to replace the headset! Problem was, when they tried to remove the stem, it broke and a bit got left in the fork. After several attempts at removing said bit, I now need a new fork and stem and headset. Grr. So I have been RATHER FRUSTRATED at not being able to really ride for the last eight days, four hours and five minutes (and counting). Especially because it has been absolutely stinking hot in Gent of late. A real scorcher today at 18 degrees which had me in out in shorts and t-shirt. There snow more snow.  I have been able to ride my MTB, which probably didn't expect it was going to be thrashed out to Oudenaarde and back every day. Unfortunately it is suffering under the load, and now needs a couple of spokes replacing (which I'll do once I get my real velocipede back). The seat is a few cm too low, but the saddle is rather comfy because it's about four times as big as my racing saddle.   Before this happened, I was actually getting to a reasonable level of fitness again. Oh well, I have time to get it back before May when I hope to do a spot of racing here in België.  Health: I haven't dropped dead yet so I think that's a positive sign (for me at least, maybe not for anyone else). I'm planning on getting another heart checkup sometime in April, but I'm fairly confident that I'm fully rid of the virus. I haven't been doing that many hard efforts recently anyway.   Work: Lots, as usual, and we're coming up to the April classics season now, which is quite intense. These are my favourite races of the year because they are so much less predictable than the big tours. You have to get everything right on the day to win, and with each classic measuring about 260 km, that's a big ask. Plus they're held on such excellent parcourses (forgive my Franglais). I'm looking forward to riding a chunk of the Ronde van Vlaanderen this Saturday, along with about 10,000 others, before Sunday's Main Event. Hope the weather stays as schitterend as it is now.  Movies: Helaas, there hasn't been a whole lotta opportunity for me to see the latest celluloid offerings. The first chance I got, I went to see Lord of the Rings: Return of the King, Gollum's Revenge Part IV, the Rise of the Orcs, because it is such a tops film. The week after they had a screening of the full LotR trilogy in one day(!) but I missed it because I had a slightly better offer of free food. I reckon it'd be fun to play an orc as an extra in one of those films, although it's probably better if you were one of the ones who didn't get deaded. The Nazgul were pretty cool too, especially the cry!! Very authentic, I thought. I wanna be a Witch King when I grow up.  I also saw Gothika on a whim and seven euros, but wasn't overly impressed. Scary, yes, but take away the sudden movements and loud noises and it didn't add up to much, in my biased opinion. Give me Scooby Doo 2 any day.  Herendethelessen: OK I'll keep it short today, as I'm busy planning my social schedule (chortle). Hope youse are all well, whichever country you happen to be in.  cheers, Jeff  urlLink     Citadelpark, Gent, February, 2004

      [note: I'm gunna put some of my previous email updates on this bilgespot]  Hello all,  Sorry it's been a while (maybe that's a good thing) but here it is, the latest, and probably the most incoherent update of them all!! If you've got an email client worth its salt, you will see I have attached two photos in this latest update. That's right, two photos! They are completely free, and come with a 30 day money back guarantee. If you are unsatisfied with the photos, then please send the unused portion, complete with wrapper, to Gent, Belgium. They will be dealt with accordingly...   urlLink     I can't believe people invested money in me   Moron the photos. The first, entitled "bookiessmall.jpg" is not a picture of 4 foot Belgian bookmakers. Oh no, it's far more serious than that. It was taken by my partner in crime, Chris Henry, at a race in Wondelgem in August. Or September. I forget which. Wondelgem is a suburb in Gent, and I for one find it very cool that they can close off minor arterial roads to hold a bike race around a leafy city suburb. The course is only 5.5 km and I didn't do very well, but apparently some people thought I would by the looks of the attached photo.   If you look *really* closely, you can see my name on the blackboard, third from the bottom. This (I believe) means that the local bookmaker has actually given me odds in this race, a very foolish idea. There are three numbers, and I hope I don't get this all wrong, but the first is my race number (23), the second is what place I'm expected to finish (16th, ho ho ho), and the third is how many people have bet on me to finish in that place (4). That's right, four people actually lost money by betting on me in that race, and probably any other race because I'll always finish somewhere between 20th and 30th. The funny thing is that you can actually bet on riders as the race progresses i.e. when the winning break forms on the third lap. But I think the money that you can win is divided by the number of people that have made that bet. Maybe.  Whatever happens, I'm sure the bookies clean up. I find it strange though, because Belgian kermesses are the most fixed things in the world. If you're ever going to bet on a kermesse, bet on the best local rider, because he'll nearly always win after buying off the other riders in the race.  Despite the obvious lack of purity in this system, it seems to work and it adds to the atmosphere of the race, which is one reason why Belgian races are so cool. The other is that people actually come to watch them for fun and the opportunity to drink a lot of the FINEST QUALITY Belgian beer. So not only are you racing for your own enjoyment, you're also providing other folk with part of their entertainment for the afternoon. So my twisted logic says I'm actually helping others and that's good enough for me.   urlLink     Clearly, I need a bigger frying pan.   And now we come to the second photo, which if you look carefully appears to be a lot of raw cabbage in an unsuitable frying pan. It appears to be this because in fact - that's *exactly* what it is!!  I bought this cabbage, see, and I thought it would be a handy garnish to a stir fry, see. Lacking het wok, I thought I could do it in my frying pan, and that was my fatal mistake... I prepared a few other things that I found in my fridge that resembled vegetables, and it was going ok: I had it all under control, simmering away...  Then I brought forth the cabbage, which I chopped in half, because you don't need a *whole* cabbage for a bloody stir fry! It seemed to be a lot, but I ploughed on until it was all chopped, coarsely mind you. It was when I started to pile it on top of the other semi-reduced veggies and stuff that I realised there was a problem. Clearly I had prepared the right amount of cabbage, but the frying pan was too small!!!  Oh no. What to do?  There was only one solution. Turn up the heat to max. and squish it all down with a lid. See, a cabbage is mostly water, so when you heat it to white hot, it loses its shape and somehow everything collapses into the frying pan black hole. This is fundamental proof that you can apply astronomy to cooking. Genius as he was, Stephen Hawking never made *that* connection. Ha!  The end result was a culinary masterpiece, and instead of eating it I decided to frame it, then eat it. But it wasn't quite bad enough to throw into the hazardous waste bins that double as garbage bins in my flat (mum can verify this).  Speaking of which, mum managed to visit me three(!) times during July which I was particularly impressed by.  I hope she didn't get food poisoning while here. For some reason she insisted on doing the cooking...   Other news: The Vuelta a España (Tour of Spain) is over and that's a good thing. The third three week tour of the year is always tough. Now just the world championships plus two world cup races (all in the next couple of weeks) and that'll be it for the season and I can go home to Real Sun(tm). I'm outta here on October 30 or 31 so it'll be good to get back to Oz and catch up with (most of) youse for a bit. Will be back here in 2004 from late January methinks.  Finally (jeez this is already 1000 words), a big congrats to those of you who are getting married (YOU KNOW WHO YOU ARE!). Definitely looking forward to being there when that happens!  Omigod, somehow the spell chekcer didn't pick up anything. Must send.  cheers, Jeff p.s. Bruce Almighty was funnier than I thought it would be. That's a worry.

      Hello all,  Rather than messing around with HTML and creating my own website, I have decided to take the easy option and do a blog instead. Inspired by such works of art as  urlLink hincapie.blogspot.com , I believe that the sky's the limit. Or not.  Hopefully I can chuck pics and stuff in here [Thinks: must find pics and stuff]. I could even create an online dairy that no-one will milk or read. Wot larx.  This is going to be a short first post, but it's better than the last post because it's not played on a trumpet. ADVANCE WARNING: All posts will be as incoherent as this one. But some may not be.   It's late and I'm sick with the dreaded lurgi so adios.

      Keeping with tradition, I have decided to review the movie  Troy , based on an original script written by Homer Simpson. I saw the movie and it was longer than I expected, so I am relying on my razor sharp memory skills to write this short review.  Troy, played by Bradd Pittt (the rest of his character makeup is left as an exercise for the reader) travels to Paris to free Agamemnon from the Texans, who have kidnapped his wife Helen for nefarious porpoises. A war ensues.  Hector, played by the Indelible Hulk, almost grows a beard. Unfortunately, Troy mistakes him for his cousin and slays him. Think of the Alexei Sayle song "Didn't you kill my brother?" and you will get the idea.  By this stage, the war is in full swing and no-one really wants to leave. Luckily Boromir makes a cameo appearance and writes a Trojan Horse virus, which he emails to Paris, and the confused Texans can make neither head nor tail of it. During the night, the virus propagates and destroys everything on the Texans' hard drive.  Agamemnon is slain, but not by Troy, who is slain anyway. Helen exits stage left, pursued by Apollo.   The End.

      Ik ben  a tad  moe, maar gelukkig na mijn laatste koers voor de Ronde van Frankrijk. Yes, today (Saturday) was my last race before the Tour madness takes over in July, and it turned out to be a good one that called for some post race celebratory drinkypoos. Well that's my excuse and I'm sticking to it. Somehow I think that it wouldn't have affected the quantity of beer consumed.  But first, to the footy and stuff.  Europe appears to be in the grip of  footy mania , also known as Euro 2004. Kinda like the World Cup but not quite as big. I only realised it was on the other day when Portugal beat the poms which was strangely gratifying. It's the quarterfinals and today was Sweden versus The Netherlands.   I generally can't stand soccer so I didn't watch much of it. I think I turned it on with 8 minutes to go and it was still nil all. I couldn't bear all the excitement so I turned it off. Then about half an hour later I turned it back on and it was still nil all and each side was taking turns booting the footy somewhere in the vicinity of the opposing team's goalie. I'm not sure I understand the attraction. I think the Dutch finally got it past the Swedes and that was it.  Today's Match of the Day report was brought to you by Hoegaarden and Maes.   Zwijnaarde   Firstly, I'm not going to explain how to pronounce  Zwijnaarde , suffice to say that it's only 5 km from my place, so it presented an ideal diversion from a somewhat heavy day worth of national championships.  TV interlude: Chantal Beltman (2nd in the Dutch women's RR) has braces. Hmm. Rabobank's Thomas Dekker the Younger and Bas Giling 1-2'd them in the U23 RR and Giling won. Nice. I can watch several championships tomorrow on my newly working TV. Cool.  Back to TMF. By the way, I'm not actually doing this reportage under the influence, despite the celebratory repast pictured below:   urlLink     Who needs champers? Beer and chocolate ice cream are all we require. Sorry about the dodgy background.   A closer inspection of this photo and  these results  reveals that somehow I managed to swindle  fourth place  in the race. I think my previous best in a kermis was about 12th way back in 1999 when I was riding "full time", and since then I've dreamed of finishing top 10. Thus today took me a bit by surprise.  It was a weird day. I had spent the morning working on news and didn't really feel in the mood for a race, mentally more than physically. It's been a very busy month with a lot of late nights (hmm, I wonder why?) and I wanted to get this last race out of the way so I could have a bit of a break before doing some more in August.  The weather was weird too. It was overcast but not too windy, unlike a couple of days ago. But we had this strange rain that kept falling throughout the race, although it was never enough to make the roads wet. It was annoying me, and I'm not easily annoyed by the weather.  There were only 25 starters and a few strong riders, including Christophe Bracke (John Saey), Didier De Lannoy (Maximize), Tom Vlerick (St Martinus), Bart Velghe (Keukens Redant) and Andries Verspeeten (Jong Vlaanderen 2016). There were also 10 Kingsnorth International Wheelers(!), plus another ring-in kiwi and pommy, which meant half the bloody field was anglo! Matt Chessum (an Aussie) was one of them and he's always consistently in the top few. AKIRA Wong was there too, but no Welsh Mari Lywd today. Maybe he was singing in the dudelsack skele-chor. Dem bones, dem bones dem...dry bones! enzovoort.  Musical interlude: Kraftwerk!! very fine.  Course: 19 laps of 6.15 km, 10 corners, lots of speed humps and a short cobbled section with a kink in it after the start/finish. This is all according to my speedo which may or may not be accurate as I don't think it's calibrated for Einsteinian relativity and Hartree-Fock Theory. I haven't yet done much testing of its quantum tunnelling capacity as I only got it the other day after my other one finally went bung. I also got a new rear tyre after Henk's fietstocht - it's an orange and black Maxxis Un Categorie. Hate the colour but the tyres are generally excellent.  Oh dear this is really rambling. Get to the point man. I'm watching monkeys trying to type out the complete works of Bill Shakespeare on keyboards on MTV. It's not working. I am one of those monkeys. I have now turned off the TV and my head suddenly feels better.  Start: Rolled out, and straight away Bart Velghe attacked, allegedly inspired by a bunch of beautiful girls, and he spent the next three laps in front as is his wont. There was an interesting cheer squad at the start/finish - I think a whole lotta cyclotourists rocked up and had a few beers. Very loud. Especially when they got on the PA! Funny though.  After we caught Big Bad Bart he started yelling at everyone in general for the rest of the race. Maybe he was yelling when he was out in front too. I really don't know why he does this as it creates unnecessary tension. I think he should be more considerate of others' delicate feelings. He also had a tendency to do turns and/or attack in the 53x12 (a rather big gear for those unfamiliar with the jargon). It didn't matter how fast we were going, here was Bart mashing away in a monstrous gear, showing us all that he was super strong. And yelling. Make the yelling stop please. Calm blue ocean.   I'm going to give him the benefit of the doubt and say that this is merely part of his character makeup. I will not cast aspersions on the Bartman. Nup. Not I, sonny Jim TV.  So the usual attack-fest followed, and I went with one or two but I got the idea that people were anxious to keep things together for a bit. Didier De Lannoy went with (at least) every attack and probably more that I didn't count. He was strong and I noted this on a piece of paper. Christophe Bracke was always there too, but he punctured and was somewhat peeved, as he probably would have won today.  After a bit, three guys got 20-30 seconds on us: AKIRA Wong, Andries from Jong Vlaanderen 2016 (very cool jersey) and Michel Dult. We sorta moseyed along behind them, keeping the gap constant for a few laps before things  het up at halfkoers . Tom Vlerick, Bart Velghe and Didier bridged up in quick time, then Matt Chessum (playing the dummy hand today) steamed across on his own. A couple of other guys got up and there were suddenly eight in front because AKIRA was knackered from being in the early break and came back to the fold.   Despite having 10 guys in the race, Kingsnorth only managed to get one rider (Matt) in the break. However, they still didn't bother chasing so on the next lap, I had a bit of a go with a couple of other dudes and although we thought the front eight were gone for good, somehow we got across to them without killing ourselves. Proof that my speedo and I can do quantum tunneling and Hartree-Fock Theory.   "You can't do it alone," said the Belgian dude (possibly Steven Goossens) with the funky multicoloured long socks on the previous lap before we attacked. He was right and I am glad for his insight and wisdom.  Anyway, once I recovered from the shock of actually closing the gap to the front group, I thunk to meself, 'This is a bit of alright,' (sorry, get confused with grammar and tenseness). Why? Because there were now 11 of us and I could see the police car in front, which meant that I was actually in the kopgroep and with a realistic shout of a top 10 for the first time ever in the History of the World Part I. We weren't  deep in the final  yet though...  Being somewhat paranoid that the group behind would close the gap, I did a fair bit of work. I mean, it wasn't so hard for us to get across so why not them? So easy is it. Fortunately it didn't happen as I think we broke their spirit with such an audacious move.   The hemi-semi-demi-rain was really giving me the pip at this moment in time.  I think I was a bit lucky that there weren't too many  toppers  in the front group, as we rolled around pretty steadily for the next few laps, with Bart Velghe yelling at all and sundry. People started yelling back for fun and it was quite a family party atmosphere in our groepje. Silly hats, cocktail umbrellas and all.  Inspired by the lunatics on the start finish line, I even went for a prime (sprint cash prize of &euro;12) on one of the laps, after seeing Didier take one on the previous lap. Unfortunately my synchronisation was off yet again, because after I charged across the line unchallenged (and got yelled at by Bart) I realised that the primes were only every second lap. D'oh! How misguided of moi.   Started to get the old cramp feeling in the last few laps, so I kept drinking my cold tea and water. No spare bottle today, as despite my generous offer a few weeks ago for someone to be my begeleider called Janet Jones, I did not receive many applications. None in fact. Not a sausage or a brass razoo (spelling has been corrected, thanks Josh). I think that's why I'm so bitter and drink tea.   Prime-less but still keen for a top 10, I kept beetling away until about 3 laps to go when the attacks started. Didn't really have the right kind of legs to make a Massive Attack but I tried and chased down a few. Didier seemed to have been in every one of them, and Matt Chessum was quite strong too. I think I was on the front just before the overpass bridge with 2 laps to go when Didier and Matt cleared out, and there was no stopping them. Yo later dudes!  By the end of the lap they had 20 seconds and we were definitely racing for third with 1 lap to go. Wow, never been in this situation before in a kermis! Surprisingly there were no more counter-attacks. Maybe people were subdued by the leaders having 30 seconds (by now) and more of Bart Velghe's yelling.   The finale was a bit tricky, as there were five corners in the last 1.5 km or thereabouts. I knew that the idea was to get to the  second  last corner in the lead, because it was very difficult to get past anyone in that last 400m. Despite this, almost everyone went past me before the third last corner and I thought that 10th was looking like a probable option. Somewhat fortuitously, someone (I think it was Bert De Wispelaere) attacked on the long straight with about 1 km to go, and as it was the first real attack, everyone chased...  Then I realised that I could execute my  cunning plan  and it took absolutely zero hesitation on my part to counter as hard as I could down the right side of the road. There was about 400m to go to the second last corner and my aim was purely to get there first. Only one guy got my wheel - Tom Vlerick - and he kept urging me ownard Christian soldiers! I didn't need that encouragement at all as I was playing the percentages. I definitely didn't care if he beat me for third!  Tom had no problems getting around me before the last corner and I followed him over the line for fourth, with the tenacious Bert De W. finishing fifth. Mr Velghe was 10th (and last of our group, as Andries' stem had come loose on the last lap). I'm sure Bart was not particularly gruntled with the way things panned out. In Bottelare I remember him crossing the line yelling "Klootzaken!". Here's a tip: only use your 53x12 for sprinting and switch to decaf.  Incredulous, I rolled back over the start/finish, congratulated Didier and then went into the rustic, open air kleedkamers to listen to the tales of woe from the Kingsnorth riders. Poor old Our Don Gamble had punctured too. Then I could pick up my fabulous prize in the back room upstairs. Cool!   urlLink     Quelle fabulous prize! Should almost cover the tyres...   Note: There were no mentions of Arse Sport riders in this report because there weren't any in today's race. I repeat, there were no  Arse Sport  riders. Pity.  Oh dearie me it's late.

      Meer slecht weer vandaag - regen en heel veel wind. Maar niet even slecht als gisteren. Ik werd bijna van mijn fiets geblazen! Sorry for the a) probably bad Dutch grammar and b) complaints about the weather. But I believe that it's justified. We've had 15 degrees or so, ridiculous strength winds, with the odd spot of rain now and again and again and again. And it's supposed to be midsummer! If that doesn't give you bad grammar, I don't know what does.  Being such a whinger (it's in my blood after all), I demand an enquiry into the European summer. I think I was spoiled rotten here last year. All of you folks in Australia putting up with 26 degrees and sun can stop your smirking right this instant!   Yeah I know it was over 30 degrees a few weeks ago, but that was only for coupla days. Jeez, even on Henk's Fietstocht I went out in a woollen jersey, arm and leg warmers, booties and I didn't even get too hot.  They  say it's gunna improve in the next few days and I hope it does or I'll demand by money back. All of it. Now.   Harry Potter 3: The revenge   Speaking of the weather, I did manage to see Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban along with all the other kiddies, who I must say were poorly behaved. Talking and giggling and whatnot.  We  were never like that when  we  were young. Shocking state of affairs. I think the world has gone to pot(ter).  But I seen it and it wasn't half bad. I even liked it better than the first two which were almost too much like the books. I haven't got the book handy but I hope they didn't leave the Yule Ball out. Maybe that's in book 4. Yeah it is, I just checked on  urlLink www.harrypotterfanclub.com . This is rather funny:  Fred Weasley has to find a partner for the ball, which he does by yelling across the common room "Oi, Angelina!"   "What," she called back.   "Want to come to the ball with me?"   Angelina gave Fred an appraising sort of look. "All right, then."   Anyway... Dumbledore is played by Michael Gambon this time, as the other dude (Richard Harris) snuffed it a coupla years ago. But he was good too. Gambon I mean. David Thewlis (who played opposite Gambon in the Singing Detective) plays Professor Lupin, who has a spot of bother with a bit of the old lycanthropy from time to time. Sirius Black is played by Gary Oldman from Bram Stoker's Dracula and other flicks.  All the others are pretty much the same as the first two movies and they were ok too. Look for Dawn French as the Portrait of the Fat Lady. Thought the kids should have been in school clothes instead of normal clothes. Their parents were obviously slacking that morning.   This movie review is rapidly deteriorating into garbage and dribble (no beer this time either). I think the reason for this is because I've been using my newfound cable TV (see post below) to watch MTV/Jim/TMF or Portugal win the penalty shootout against England in some footy match. The English fans and David Beckham didn't look particularly plussed by the proceedings.   I did see RAMMSTEIN on MTV so that prolly explains most of the words above.  Let's see if I can get to sleep before 4:00am this evening. I think I will succeezzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz

      Today is a Great Day and will go down in the annals of history as a Significant Moment in the Chronicles of Jeff the Younger.   Why?     I have CABLE TV!!    I have therefore joined the other 10 million people in Belgium who are able to view nearly 30 channels from all around the world. Well, Europe mainly. There are even Home Shopping channels, which I accidentally deleted with my new found remote control skills. Damnation.  The Reason? Well, being such a cheapskate, I have held off until now and put up with two very fuzzy channels (TV1 and Canvas) using an internal aerial. Now that's what I call cheap. But funnily enough, you can see nearly all the cycling on these channels, so it was OK...until now.  Due to the fact that too much sport is never enough, the powers that be in Belgium have created a new "temporary" channel for the summer called Sporza. They've basically shunted everything off TV1/Canvas onto this new channel, and will be using it for the next few months, including the Tour and the Olympics. So my hand was forced, as it were. Didn't actually cost that much anyway :-)  I got it connected last Thursday but of course it didn't work straight off, and I didn't think it was because my TV on/off button doesn't stay "on". I need a light bulb and a few dictionaries to hold it in position. The cable guy came today and there was a lot of discussion about what the problem was, including waking up my downstairs neighbour (hey it was bloody midday!) to ask if her TV worked. It did, so why the bejeezus didn't mine? I demand an enquiry like the one the Aussies are gunna do into Marky Mark French and the Funky Bunch. Ooh boy, that looks fun and does not bode well for certain members of the Olympic team. I'll leave it at that or I'll get into trouble.  The cable guy replaced all the cables downstairs and the outlet box upstairs and Lo! I have a working cable TV setup with 30 channels of multi-European crap. I was annoyed because I missed Der Kaiser winning the  urlLink Tour de Suisse  by one tiny second. Gotta feel sorry for Jeker - Swiss boy, rides for a Swiss/Spanish sponsor based in Lugano, and he cracks in the last kilometre and loses about 5 seconds to Herr Ullrich. He's 35 and probably won't get that chance again. But I was still going for Jan :-)  After viewing  urlLink this photo  and  urlLink this one , I've decided to go on a strudel, schnitzel and bier diet. Last year, Der Kaiser finished 7th in the Tour de Suisse at 2'27, then went onto finish second in the Tour de France at 1'01. This year? I'm putting &euro;3.47 on Jan to win.   Deftinge   Today, being Monday and all and an official Jeff's Day Off, I opted to do something a bit different racing fixture-wise: An Open race in Deftinge, which is not actually 15 km from Gent. It's 15 km from Zottegem, so I caught the train to Zottegem in order to get the correct number of kilometres in. An Open race means that pretty much anyone can rock up and race; you can even get a day licence. So in addition to the normal Elites zonder contract (me), there were Masters and Amateur riders. For all intents and purposes it was very similar to a kermis, except it was a tad slower and a tad shorter (94 km). Still a whole lotta attacking.  We had 59 starters and I honestly had no idea what the quality of the field was and how they would race, although I did notice a couple of guys from the Schelde ride including Mr still-hellishly-fit-ex-prof Eric Van De Wiele. There were also a few Arse Sport riders. Excellent. The course was 7.8 km (12 laps) with 11 corners, four hills, one longish false flat and some cool descents. It was quite a tough course, but that's always good.  I started at the back in order to get a feel for the course and the race. After about 2 km I realised that the back wasn't a good place to be, as the course was too difficult. The pace wasn't super high - we averaged 40 km/h which is probably 1-2 km/h slower than a kermis would have been that course. But there was still plenty of attacking and a lot of really slow riding in between the attacks. Same style I guess, but fewer riders willing to put it on the line and attack. Rijden jongens, rijden!  Lap 2 was used to get forwardly mobile and position myself strategically 20 wheels back. This was a better place to be, and opened up countless opportunities to attack or follow attacks, and naturally I took advantage of this prime real estate. But for some or many reasons, my synchronisation wasn't happening today, and I'd always pick the wrong places on the course to attack and end up in the moves that weren't going to work if you paid them.   I eventually figured out using my phenomenal Brian Space there were actually only 2 decent places to attack and get a proper gap, even though there were plenty of hard bits of the parcours. By the time I had reached this rather crucial conclusie, there were 15 guys up the road - including Van De Wiele - dangling agonisingly close (30 sec-1 min) but agonisingly far for a solo bridge attempt. Solo bridging is hard because you have to play three other hands even though one ends up being dummy and so you end up bidding against yourself with the infamous "5 No Clubs" or worse. Then you have to ruff the Ace of Spades using the Two of Diamonds which is dashed tricky, especially when neither you or your partner has the Two of Diamonds in their hand. The trick is to bid Slam No Trumps and then no-one will bother outbidding you any more. And DON'T EVER ADMIT that you play the Short Club. That's a big no-no.  ... (A pause to digest this)  At this point, you can probably tell I'm onto the Leffe Blond, which is not my first beer of the evening.  Back to the tale. By halfway, the leaders had about a minute and I suspected they were gone for good. Turns out I was right. Quelle insight Batman. Why didn't I stick to Mr Van De Wiele who prolly knows a thing or two about racing? I could ponder this on the way home.  But there was still Honour and Glory and &euro;10 to be had for the 16th place, and Our Gallant British Lads did not surrender! We actually split the peloton (which was still depressingly large) with 4 laps to go, but only 3 of us were working and that wasn't good odds, even on a hard parcours. But peoples were starting to get tired and with about 2 laps to go everyone suddenly slowed and I kinda moseyed - sidled, if you will - off the front on the false flat after the start/finish. It wasn't an actual attack, per se, but sometimes these sneaky moves actually work.   I was joined by another dude before long, and he actually worked with me so that was good. We put a handy 15 seconds into the peloton, although another guy in a smart fluoro green outfit was trying to bridge across, solo. We let him, because three is always better than two. Especially when the first dude conked out and told us he couldn't do any more. Shoulda thought of that before you came with us mate! Een beetje respect, jongen.  The fluoro guy and I worked for the last lap to make sure the bunch didn't get us and they didn't, which was rather satisfying. We actually put 30 seconds into the chasing group behind and 1'15 into the bunch in general in the last two laps. After the last climb we could see the next group about 20 seconds in front of us, but there was less than 2 km to go at that point so you can do the mathematics.   I can too, but it didn't stop me from attacking the other two as soon as we got over the hill. I don't do sprints. The gap wasn't big enough though, and I throttled it back to save a little for the end, which was 300m uphill then 200m downhill. That worked well, because the fluoro guy led out and it wasn't too difficult to pass him. So 16th place and a princely sum of &euro;10 was mine for the taking. Given that it cost &euro;3 to race, &euro;2 for my squeezy gel and three dextro energy tablets, and &euro;7.40 for the train fare, I think I lost out. My rock solid financial nouse falls to pieces when I catch the train to a race. OTOH, I've finished in the money in every race bar three this season, so that's not too bad.  Cruised 35km home via Zottegem and it didn't rain so I was happy as larry. Never met larry. It was a rather pleasant evening actually. Almost no traffic, some nice late evening sunshine and idyllic Flemish countryside to ride through. I got home at 10:30 and it was still light(ish)!   It's the summer solstice today (well, yesterday) so I could have been one of the  urlLink 19,000 grimpils who gathered at Stonehenge today  and participated in some pagan rites. That would have been some larx. Given that I spent a couple of formative years living in nearby Salisbury, I can definitely empathise with these folks.   Bloody bunch of loonies.

      It's late but we're nearing the summer solstice so it's only been dark for three hours or so. Hence, I conclude that I am bloody tired.   Today was Henk Ballet's grand fietstocht that started in Ouwegem (about 17 km from Gent, like everywhere else in Belgium) and went down to Lessines, along a bit of the parcours of Stage 4 of the Tour de France, then back via Ronse. Months of planning went into this and I am indeed impressed by Henk's knowledge of all the back roads between here and somewhere south of here.    urlLink     Henk (2nd L) explains the parcours   Unfortunately it was a bit wet, and the auspices were not in our favour today regarding the dreaded punctures. I guess we averaged less than one per rider, but when you have eight riders that's still a lot. Including my flat on the way to Ouwegem and one during the tour, we managed six all up. I think that's a record.    urlLink     Puncture 2 in Horebeke    urlLink     Looks like a spot of rain    urlLink     Puncture 3 in Schorisse    urlLink     Cruisin' along. Where can I get a 'Casa Erotica' jersey?   As you can see I have uploaded some pics of the ride including a  banned  photo (below) from inside the Tour de France museum at the top of the hill at Frasnes-lez-Anvaing. This is a cafe that we pass every Sunday on the Berchem ride, but I had no idea that it was a museum. The TdF route goes the opposite way to the Berchem ride, and we stopped off at the cafe for a quick refresher before heading home.  To make a short story long, there's quite an interesting museum with lots of photos from Tours gone by, probably all of them in fact. A few bikes, lots of jerseys etc. But once I started snapping away the proprietor came up and was rather annoyed "Geen fotograferen!"  If I could have been bothered, I would have expained that I'm a journalist and was going to do a nice little feature on the museum which would have given him plenty of free advertising. And he would have been ok with that I think. He was more worried about people taking photos of photos and then selling them.   Whatever. I may still write the feature anyway if I get the time. Maybe I'll just make it into a photo essay :-) Voila:   urlLink     The Musee du Tour de France in Frasnes-lez-Anvaing    urlLink     The entree to the Musee du Tour de France    urlLink     Jerseys in the TdF musee. Banned photo!!   A few more punctures later, and we eventually got back to somewhere near Oudenaarde. Next year, it's MTB tyres all round we think.   urlLink     Henk (R) can't believe this is the fifth puncture    urlLink     The way home...eindelijk!   Anyway it's new tyre time and I'm tyred out. Flew back home to Gent into the headwind because I wanted to catch up on the Tour de Suisse et all. It was a really wet finish today and Jeker put a few more seconds into Der Kaiser and dropped Totschnig, who won yesterday. So going into tomorrow's 25km time trial, Jeker has 41 seconds on Ullrich and 50 to Totschnig. I reckon Ullrich will still win.  As I wrote above, it's late(r) and I'm finally going to bed!

      But first, a report on Reinhard Vanspeybroeck's Grand Opening of the Great Australian Bite: the first Aussie pie shop in Gent, and perhaps in Europe. Oohlala.  It was a grand occasion actually, as I cycled down to Walpoort Straat on a warm June evening on my completely untrustworthy MTB. Still got three busted spokes and the right pedal is threatening to walk out on me at any moment, but it's hangin' in there.  There were a whole lotta folks down at the Pie Shop when I got there, all scoffing pies which was very good to see. I mean, Belgians love their food but it's a bit less multicultural than in Sydney, where you can get a bloody awesome slap up Thai meal for about 5 bucks anywhere you like as long as it's King St. So it will be interesting to see how the Belgians take to the Great Aussie Pie.  Reinhard explained to me that most of the folks at the shop were Family, and I had a good chat to his dad who is Belgian, lives in Perth and had just been to China for a business thing. He also ran a cycling team a couple of years ago but it failed, even though he had some good Aussies like Luke Roberts on it. They couldn't hack the Belgian style of racing and were generally cod ordinary.  He has big plans for the Pie Shop though - he wants to franchise it and open shops all over Europa. Good on him, even though it was actually Reinhard's idea.  There was one other genuine Aussie there by the name of Ryan, but he had to bugger off early to meet some Swedish chick for a hot date. He's definitely got his priorities arse up, as you don't get free Aussie Pies every day but dates with hot Swedish chicks are a dime a dozen.  The "Aussie" thing is a bit of a furphy actually, as I was chatting to the Irish cook/entrepreneur dude, who said all the pies are imported from his business in England. hmmm. Well they still tasted like Aussie Pies and I didn't get food poisoning so I reckon it's double thumbs up for the Great Australian Bite!   Other things   I got the Kraftwerk Tour de France CD from mein liebe Schwester yesterday too. Very very cool and thanks sis! It's a must for any TdF/Kraftwerk fans, to state the bleedin' obvious. Think minimalist electronica, with French cycling terms spoken with an electronic German accent.  Speaking of the Tour, it's only two and a half weeks away. Jeez louise. At least Der Kaiser is still leading  urlLink Tour de Suisse , so he's got my vote for LA challenger number one, followed by Tyler and hold the Mayo. I wish Ullrich's teammates would keep their bums firmly planted on their bikes. Vino and Steinhauser both out. Maybe Steinhauser will make it back in time for Le Tour.  And speaking of LA, the Posties announced their new  sponsor today : Discovery Channel! Can you imagine? I can't wait to see the jerseys. I hope they put a wildebeest on it. Always been fond of wildebeests. It's a much better name than Gnu.  Drinking: Hoegaarden Grand Cru because I like it and it was cold. Also Chimay (Peres Trappists). Crikey this is powerful stuff. I'm running low on beer again. Must invest in more.   Schellebelle   OK now to today's racing fixture in Schellebelle, which is probably 14 km from Gent as the crow flies. I'm not the crow and I can't fly so it was 19 km for me and my velo. However, I was listening to my The Crow CD this morning as psych up muzak. You see, everything is fundamentally interconnected. I was also getting into a bit of Nick Cave (Live Seeds) and I'm indebted to Anna for opening my eyes to Mr Cave (and the Cardigans!).  Anyway, I rocked up to Schellebelle's Dorp and the Cafe 't Steksken, where sign on was. The kleedkamers were up the road at the local footy field, so I found them and pinned the number on, did a couple of stretches et al and was ready to rock. They were playing Madonna's  Holiday  at the start, which is always good to get you in the mood for a balls-out kermis race.  There was no holding back today, that was for sure. 73 starters and plenty of good riders for 16 laps of a 7.1 km circuit with 9 corners/lap and a bit o' wind. There was an interesting crosswind section next to the railway line which I quite liked, but The Others didn't.  I started at the back and by the time I had clipped into my pedal, the first break had already gone. It was rather quick at the start and non-stop attacking, which is to be expected of course. I couldn't really be bothered but had a little dabble after about 3 laps and quickly thought better of it. Back to...oh jeez this beer's making it hard to think...purgatory towards the tail end of the bunch for me.  But that was ok. With a big bunch, you can sit back a bit as there's always guys chasing and the speed is generally high. You don't have to be quite as attentive unless you want to absolutely make the front group and I absolutely didn't want to today, despite feeling ok.   A group of 14 got away after maybe 5 laps and there wasn't much I could do about that, being about 50 riders back an' all. "Let 'em go, they'll die in the hills!" A great quote from a classic (and terrible) cycling movie.  We did just under 43 km in the first hour, which I thought was fast considering the course. But it got faster. After a few more laps I heard "peloton met achterstand van achtenveertig seconden (48 seconds behind)". Hmm, that means the 14 leaders would probably stay away and we'd fight it out for the nutritious kitchen scraps.  For the second time this year (in a race), I was proved wrong, as some teams had missed the break and were chasing. Godverdomme. It was probably Arse Sport. I kid you not, there is a cycling team with that printed on the bottoms of their knicks. It cracks me up, but apparently it's pronounced "Ar-Say" and has nothing to do with buttocks/bums/bottoms/arses. Sorry, this beer has fully taken hold now and there's nothing for it but to plough on with more mentions of Arse Sport.  After putting in a few 9'40 laps (about 44 clicks per hour in metric terms) we brought the break back to about 20 seconds. Then it just hovered there like the dark clouds overhead (note: this is atmosphere that I'm trying to create here) and we couldn't quite close the gap. Mainly because as soon as you get that close, people get it into their heads that they're going to close the 20 second gap themselves by attacking. It's rather stupid, as to close a 20 second gap at 44 km/h requires you to ride at 50 km/h for most of a lap. No way Jose.  So the chase sorta continued in stits and farts, and eventually the gap was closeable. I had a few goes in little groups, but I'd get about halfway across and hit the wall, so I fell back again into the Arse Sport end of the thinner peloton. But we - or more correctly They - closed it with about 5 laps to go and I was Truly Amazed.   Interlude: I noticed a Welsh guy today with Mari Lywd Llap Goch or something printed on his jersey. He was riding for Staf Boone's mob, sans the usual jersey. He did a bit of work but died in the Arse Sport near the end.  There were more attacks but the peloton was still pretty big and ugly, but another 10 guys got off the front and stayed there. I was starting to hurt a bit by then, but so was everyone else so there was empathy. After staying near the frontage I got myself into a nice little break just before the crosswind section with 2.753 laps to go. 3 of us chasing 3, then there were 6, then 9, including a few ARSE SPORT guys. That was cool.  "Komaan jongens. Allemaal fietsen! (everybody ride!)" I was a bit stuffed, but did what I could, making sure the Arse Sport team did their fair share. We were holding the peloton at bay by 5-10 seconds, but it was worth persisting for the greater good. Status quo for the last two laps, although I started to come good and do a few more turns. The cohesion was crap, but somehow we stayed in front of the peloton until the final kilometre. That meant I was in with a shout of 11th place DEEP IN THE FINAL. Very nice.  I did two turns too many in the last kilometre and blew myself a bit, so when they sprinted there was nothing left. The front part of the peloton just managed to latch on so I ended up 14th in the sprint, going backwards for Christmas the whole time. Still, that gave me 24th overall which was rather satisfying, especially as we did the 114 km in 2 hours 38 minutes and change (43.2 km/h). ow. The legs hurt een beetje in de aankomst.  When I went to claim my prize money, there was this...odd guy of about 60 who wanted to shake my hand, hug me and whisper in my ear. Or maybe I was supposed to do that. Maybe he'd won money on me with the bookies :-) These Belgians are crazy.  I rode back with a Californian Asian-American by the name of AKIRA Wong and the Welsh Mari Lywd. We didn't discuss manga and the Mari Lywd was knackered, as mentioned previously. Maybe he should eat more.  Don't arks me who won the election because I dunno. Probably Vlaams Blog.  I'm Trappist.

      Now I've always been a bit of a Jan Ullrich fan since the big German lobbed into Australia all those years ago and won the Commonwealth Bank Cycle Classic in 1993(?). Then he went and won the Tour de France in '97 in his second attempt, which is not bad going. But then LANCE came along and relegated Ullrich to second for the term of his natural life, or so it seemed. Pantani did too in '98 and that annoyed me.  Watching Der Jan win the Olympic Road Race in Sydney, as I was doing the live coverage from Frank Conceicao's shop at the top of the Bronte hill was pretty bloody good. He steamed to the top of the hill with Vinokourov and Kloden in tow (they were and are still all teammates), with the Italian connection of Paolo Bettini and Michele Bartoli chasing. LANCE? In the bunch, later claiming he had missed the move because the USA team radios didn't work. Or that might have been Georg Hincapie. Whatever dude.  Thus, watching a "big boned" looking Ullrich puff and pant his way to the top of the Mur de Huy in fifth last wheel after 66 km of La Fleche Wallonne this year caused me some concern. He didn't make it on lap 2. Two and a bit months - enough time to get in Tour shape?   But it seems as though he's turned on the gas a bit, finishing second in the Tour of Germany TT (7th overall because he can't attack on a climb). Then in the  urlLink first stage of the Tour de Suisse  he got in the front group of 39, jumped across to the two leaders with about 25 km to go and proceeded to hammer them in the sprint. Not bad, even if it was downhill.  With this, combined with Mayo's awesome ride on Ventoux and Hamilton and Heras all showing good form, I think Armstrong is going to have some big trouble in little China come July. Of course he could be bluffing, or simply not peaking yet, but at least it's not like other years where he wins the Dauphine and says "I'm only at 20 percent of my best condition" just to really piss everyone off. Maybe this year it's reverse psychology.  Call it schadenfreude, and I'm supposed to be objective and all that, but dominance always gets a little boring. It was the same with Big Mig. He was an awesome rider (like Lance) but I was always cheering for Rominger/Bugno/Zenon Jaskula/the anti-hero etc. Even though Chiappucci always annoyed me for some reason too.   I won't even mention the Dauphine today, suffice to say that Hamilton needs to stop enjoying the scenery and concentrate on keeping both wheels of his velocipede  on the road . None of this "I can fly" business when you're descending an Alp. Save that for the post-race party, mate.  Back to real life. No racing for me until Tuesday so I went out with the boys on the Saturday bunch ride. And It Was Good. Once I woke up.   There must have been 40 or so riders by the time we reached the backside of the Molenberg (the non-cobbled bit) and I couldn't be bothered fighting for position so I sat back a bit and watched Eric Van De Wiele (ex-pro from about 20 years ago, now racing masters) lead a small group off the front. I got some room to move near the top and closed the gap, but they didn't really want to work and the rest of the bunch caught us at the bottom of the Trap Op.  Mr. Van De Wiele led for about half of it; I did a token turn which is more than I usually do; then Kristof Trouve (Palmans) and Sammy Moreels (another ex-pro from 10 years ago) drove it to the top. I had a bit more go-juice today so I could do the last turn to the top, where the speed reaches 40 km/h on the false flat. I guess that race last Tuesday did the engine some good.  It was reasonably windy on the way back along the Schelde - cross/headwind, mostly cross (which makes people cross) but we somehow averaged 43.5 km/h. I think it was Trouve and Moreels doing a lot of the damage. With 10 km to go it was a crosswind and quite exposed, so I moseyed on back to the front in time to get on the wheel of Moreels and Trouve when they attacked. Van De Wiele was there plus another ex-pro and we were away! To use the parlance, deep in the final!!!  We didn't muck around and averaged over 44 km/h for the last bit but my HR never got above 180, so that was rather nice. The rest of the bunch was somewhat distanced at the end. The main guy we missed was Guido, who was caught slacking in about 20th wheel when the move went. By the time he got to the front we had 100m and it wasn't to be.  Now I just have to apply this to a race one time and I might actually finish top 10 :-)  The election is tomorrow. Maybe I'll vote Vlaams Blog.

      It's still hot, Damn Hot. 33 degrees at 6:00pm according to my Polar S725 HRM (tm). It's the heat you know.  Yes that's right, another race report! Why? Because I just raced my third race in nine days, but from now on will space it out a bit. Starting with this report, which I can assure you will be spaced out.   The title is full of hidden meaning, as all my titles are. Let me deconstruct it. Firstly, Lovendegem refers to a place approximately 15 km from Gent, and I didn't get lost either so it was in fact 15 km via the north circular, as Bazza McKenzie would say.   I did this race last year and was sort of looking forward to it, as it's on a nice 10.5 km loop (10 laps) with long straights but one pretty hairy cobbled corner. I really don't think cobbles should be cornered. It's also a fun race because it starts at 6pm or 18:00 hrs in the new speak, which means that the finish is around 8:30pm or 20:30, which means I didn't get home until 9:56pm or 21:56. And it was still light!  Hence the Nocturne part of the title, and it has to be Chopin because I like Chopin. The Op posth. refers to how I feel after the race i.e. like death (warmed up today). Legs were good though.  I seem to be repeating myself but it was 33 degrees celsius or 306 kelvin on the start line, along with 48 other riders. There were 15 (mostly Aussies) from the notorious Kingsnorth International Wheelers, a team run by the inimitable Staf Boone, mostly full of anglos, that is based in Gent. It has a few Belgians too, one of which (Hans Ardeel) won the race in Zwijnaarde on Saturday. Mario Willems (John Saey) and Stefan Vermeersch (Mez) were there too, and they could be seen concocting a cunning plan before the start.   We set off at high speed (50-55 km/h) as there was a tailwind for the first bit. Halfway through the first lap, the peloton had split into three big bits which didn't bode well for me, as I was in the third bit. Oops.   By the end of the lap, the front two groups had come together and we were about 30 seconds behind them and I thought it was all over red rover. But it was only the first lap, so I went to the front and helped get the train working smoothly. We averaged 45 km/h on lap 2 and picked up the leaders, who weren't really working hard to stay away. I was back in the race. Life begins anew!  But the attacks continued non-stop and it was keihard. Much tougher than last year, when the bunch more or less stayed together and we finished in a bunch sprint. I went with the ones that I could, as that's the only way to get in the right break, but the terrible heat and the blocking tactics by Kingsnorth and the Litouwers (Lithuanian team) were making it tough. After halfway, the race had broken up into lots of little bitty pieces, and there were about 20 guys up the road in various bunches while I was with the peloton, wondering why my heart rate kept going above 180.  I actually needed an extra bottle today, but unfortunately I have no begeleider (assistant/handler) to give me one. I have a licence for one with Janet Jones printed on it (sorry ma, had to put someone on the application form) so if anyone wants to be Janet Jones for a few races and...er...happens to live in the vicinity of Gent, then they can have the card. I have no idea why you need a licence card to give someone a water bottle during a race, but watching some of the handups today I think some of the begeleiders need to be better trained.  "Don't wiggle the bloody bottle all over the place, hold it still!" quoth Kingsnorth's Andrew Benson on about lap 5 as his begeleider withdrew the bottle into his chest just as Andrew was about to grab it. Result: dropped bottle and Andrew has no water left.  Verily, Andrew waxed sorely pissed about this unfortunate turn of events, especially as it was still 305K in the shade. The same thing happened on the next lap, hence there was only one thing left for him to do: attack you fool!!  At this stage, there were three guys dangling about 20 seconds in front of us including Don Gamble (Kingsnorth), a Litouwer and a Belgie. We won't mention the other 20 guys up the road because for the purposes of this race report, they didn't exist any more. If a break goes in the forest and no-one is there to mark it, did it really happen?  As Benson proceeded to motor across to the "leaders" - sans water but with a lighter bike, always look at the positive - I thought 'bugger it, this lot hasn't shown much interest of late in this terrible, terrible heat, so why don't I hurt myself for the nth time and attack?' Surprisingly my legs agreed and it was the tailwind so I caught Mr Benson, esq. just before the cobbled corner and then had to re-catch him because I was cod ordinary around that corner on every lap.  Not a problem. The ol' ticker was doing about 185 so I still had a good 5 bpm spare. In hand, if you like, for when it got  really hard . It got  really hard  when we caught the other three as the Litouwer was sitting on the back. a) He had teammates in front. Join the club, mate! b) He had teammates behind. Ditto.  So there were four of us working, but with Andrew and Don there, it was almost as if we were riding on the Schelde. In fact, Don said "It's almost as if we were riding on the Schelde." He has great insight, Our Don.   So there we were, me swapping off at some ridiculous HR - never below 185 and I even hit 191 a couple of times. The heat typically adds 5-10 beats to one's HR but not to one's max. Real raw deal, I say.  I looked back and the rest of the peloton weren't too close, but then I saw a flash of yellow, blue and red and Lo! Two Litouwers had extracted themselves from the bunch and had bridged up to us in a very short space of time. I thought 'cool, two more guys to work' but this gay ambience only lasted a kilometre or so before first one, then the other attacked us and rode off in pursuit of the next bunch. But we were getting on so swell! It was as if we didn't exist. At the time it reminded me of a quantum tunneling effect. I mentioned this to Benson afterwards and he gave me a strange look.  I am not entirely clear when this happened, but it was probably on lap six. The remaining Litouwer with us now had a good excuse to sit on again, and who were we to argue? And so, the pain continued but at a slow pace because we were a bit cooked and wanted the race to end sooner rather than later.  After coming through at the end of lap 7 with a 3'15 disadvantage to the leaders, we thought lap 8 would be the laatste ronde. We were actually catching a group in front of us, that the Litouwers had probably leapfrogged too, but were stopped by a train crossing signal about 500m after the start/finish. Yea, verily once again forsooth, we waxed sorely pissed, especially when the Litouwer jumped through the crossing and nearly got creamed by the train. He would have been disqualified anyway.  Luckily it was only 20 seconds wait, so the bunch behind us didn't quite get us. Once we got going again, Benson really drove it and we caught the Litouwer and gave him an earful. Unfortunately there was no commissaire there to witness the train crossing so we had to just deal with it in a manly beach fashion.  With about 1km to go, Benson sort of accelerated and I sort of followed him. 'Attack' would be too kind a word to use at this stage. Don "Let's Gamble" stopped pedalling behind and we had enough of a gap to stay away. I didn't bother sprinting around Benson as he had earned the 25th place more than me. It was zero financial difference anyway.  Don was a little annoyed that the Litouwer jumped him for 27th, when by rights he should have been DQ'd. But we couldn't really argue the point with the commissaire as there were no other witnesses. Didn't matter enough to Our Don.  Winner: Hans Ardeel by 10 seconds over Mario Willems. Funny that. I would have liked to have been privy to their pre-race chat.  Heart rate: averaged 180 for the whole 2 hours 5 minutes. I have never done that before for that long (and I thought Laarne was hard). That's about 94% of max. Oh well, it's interesting to find out one's limits.   Once again I'm rich beyond my wildest dreams with the princely sum of 9 euros. Since it only costs 3 euros to race and about 1 euro for the packet of dextro-energy tablets which I either ate or dropped, then I conclude that racing kermises is a win-win situation. I mean, I've more than doubled my money three times in the last nine days. It doesn't take a financial genius to work out that that is far more worthwhile than investing in the stock market or buying a house. Bricks and mortar? That's old hat. I'm doing it my way.  The real problem is getting to sleep after getting home at 20:56 or 9:56pm in the old speak. Even writing two blog entries in a day won't help that. Incoherent, yes. Tired, no.  Speaking of the terrible heat, it appears that I'm not the only one to suffer in it. In  urlLink Stage 2  of the Dauphine, even Tyler Hamilton was having problems holding onto the front group, while Pena, Rogers, Basso, Hincapie, Jaksche, Cooke, Bartoli, Miller, Dekker, Ekimov, White, Freire were all dropped! Allez Mayo, that's what I reckon.  As it's still about 25 degrees outside, I'm listening to Schubert's Winterreise, which is a very fine piece of music and chills the soul somewhat.  I'd better quit while I'm ahead. Please  urlLink email me  your begeleider applications post-haste. No offer is considered too small!  adidas, Jeff

      It's 30 degrees today and that means it's Damn Hot. It's the heat, you know.  I don't profess to know a lot about Belgian politics, apart from the fact that the Prime Minister Guy Verhofstadt rides a bike, which clearly means that the country is in good hands. But in recent weeks it has come to my attention that there is to be an election held shortly for the whole of Flanders. This Sunday, in fact. I will be happy when it's over, because the thrill of opening my overflowing mailbox in the morning is quickly negated by the fact that it's all pre-election crap. Although today I did receive an invitation for Reinhard Vanspeybroeck's Aussie pie shop opening next Monday. Woo hoo!  Now, if I was really keen I could probably vote, seeing as I've now got my little ol' Belgian ID card, which took quite a while to get and I still haven't got my final two numbers. To quote one of the kiddies from The Matrix, "There is no Bureaucracy" (that's a hard word to spell).  Back to the election, today I received in the letterbox a beautiful piece of campaign literature from the Vlaams Blok party. For those of you unfamiliar with this lot, just think Right Wing Loonies and you will get the idea. Vlaams Blok is even narrower than One Nation, in that they don't like Wallonia (the other half of Belgium) either. Cool, huh?  "Finally a publication that says what you think!" is the succinct description of  De Strop  (the noose), which has a yellow and black noose threaded through the letters. Then "Vote foreigners' voting rights away! Vlaams Blok, the  only  opposition."  So why did I get one?

      I pushed the envelope this week in that I did two races, with another one planned next Tuesday. I'm trying to get in as many as possible before the Tour madness takes over in July. Pity, because July's a good month for racing here.  Today's (Saturday) race was in  urlLink Laarne  (where I'm from the USA), about 15 km east of Gent depending on how lost you get riding to the start. I didn't get too lost so it was only 12 km. I got lost later on though. I remember I raced on this weekend last year in Zwijnaarde, which is only 5 km from my place. But I had bad memories of a 70 degree corner with a speed hump around it, so I opted for Laarne. In hindsight it was a harder course, but I guess I had a better race. In fact it was one of the hardest courses I've done here. Luckily it wasn't wet, just windy (but sunny).  The course. 6.7 km x 17 laps. Sounds easy enough until we actually rode it. Lots of speed humps (verkeersdrempels); 13 corners a lap, including one where everyone took the shortcut along the narrow bike path, only to have to jump off the gutter on the other side, but if you went the full way around, you would lose 30m; and COBBLES. Yes, we rode up the length of Laarne's cobbled Dorpstraat which felt like it was 3km long but was probably only 500m. But at the end, we turned sharp left and went across another 500m of cobbles, although these were the lighter red paver variety. Would have been ok but for all the raised round metal platforms. Even the asphalt roads had big bumps!  So all this probably explains why there were only 30 starters, as most had the sense to go to Zwijnaarde. But if I had the choice next year, I'd probably still race in Laarne because I'm a glutton for punishment.  We merrily set off and after about 500m the attacks started, in preparation for the first crossing of the cobbles. I assumed the position about 2/3 of the way back and just tried to ride like Johan Museeuw softly-softly across the cobbles, failing miserably of course. My cornering wasn't quite up to par today, and the bike path-gutter jump corner gave me a lot of grief (as it did the others).  After about half an hour we were still hanging together, but there had already been veel attacks, most of which were instigated by the "local" John Saey team, which had 50 riders in the race and all of them in every attack. I'm exaggerating for the sake of the story. I never do that normally.  Things started to fragment into bigger bits on the cobbles, and I found myself with a couple of others trying to chase 13 leaders. The gap was 10-15 seconds and I was well into the 180+ Danger Will Robinson Danger red zone so I was trying to look incognito and not do too much. Hard when there's only three. Thankfully were were joined by a few more over the next laps, with the leaders still 10 seconds in front.   We had seven of us and I knew this was a golden opportunity to make the front group FOR ONCE but although I could suffer at 180-185, there was nothing extra in the tank for that final jump. One guy almost dragged us all the way to the leaders, but didn't finish it off. Damn him, as I was on his wheel! Gradually, every single one of my group jumped across the small gap and made contact, and I was left with one old guy (seriously, he looked a lot older than any of the guys on the Schelde and they're all 50 plussers!).   It was depressing. He was stronger. The gap was 5 seconds and he was urging me on but neither of us could redline it enough to make the junction, where we would have had a bunch to sit on at the same speed. We continued for several laps like this before eventually the elastic snapped and the leaders went out to 30 seconds, then a minute then more. My chasing partner had spent his bikkies by this stage but once I got below 180 again, I started to come good and could lift the speed and do stronger turns. Order was restored :-)  One lap later we picked up another guy in a purple skinsuit who had been dropped from the front group and the two of us took over the workload while our venerable companion sat on. On the ninth lap I found I could ride a bit faster over the cobbles, and actually dropped him a bit but he got back on. At the end of the lap, we got the one lap to go signal and the third guy proceeded to really wind it up over the cobbles, gradually riding away from me and definitively dropping Mr 80+. That'll show the old bugger. God I hope I'm that fit when I'm his age. I've gotten used to it over here. Older masters riders aren't really like that in Australia, let me tell you!  Anyway I caught Mr Purple skinsuit on the second chunk of the cobbles and we proceeded to press our advantage home. I'm sure the old guy would have beaten me in the sprint. Mr Purple smoked me so I finished up with 20th. That was a  lot  tougher than the race in Bottelare. Average heart rate was 176 (dunno how long I was over 180 but it was a while), max was 190, and that  wasn't in the sprint. I thought my max was 189 but clearly I haven't been trying hard enough. Actually when I'm fresh after a layoff I can hit 192.   Then I went for a cruise (and got lost) with Reinhard Vanspeybroeck, a Belgian/Aussie who I know from Perth. He's setting up an Aussie pie shop in downtown Gent, just down the road from the Vooruit, and official opening night is Monday, June 14. I'm there baby!   Reinhard races too, but he hasn't for a while due to getting things in order for the great pie unveiling. This is a first for Gent. He's hoping it'll take off like the Turkish kebab places and I wish him luck. I'll definitely be dropping in for a few pies.  Speaking of food, my great Stew is no more. I couldn't face it for a fourth night (tomorrow) so I ate the rest of it today. It wasn't so bad and I haven't got botulism yet so it's definitely one for the regular recipe book.  Hmm, it's 1:42am which means it's late. Well I don't have to get up early tomorrow at least. Maybe a quiet cruise on the second lap of the Schelde.

      Times are grim here in sunny Belgium, and that necessitates cooking survival food, such as this beautiful Stew which I have photographed for the world's viewing pleasure.   urlLink     Here's me stew   Being in a revealing sort of mood, I now propose to unveil the recipe of this Special Stew while listening to The Ludwig Van Beethoven's Hammerklavier Sonata, Op. 106, as played by The Alfred Brendel. Before we begin, I want you to suspend all disbelief and imagine that I am World Famous Chef(ess)  urlLink Kylie Kwong , of Kylie's Heart and Soul cooking show fame. If you can do this, then the next part will be a breeze.  Firstly, acquire your ingredients from the local Delhaize supermarkt. It helps if it's actually open, although that didn't stop mum on a Sunday last year. The soup turned out alright mind you, after getting some free advice from the local populace that happened to be hanging around the non-used food area outside Delhaize.  Anyway, you will need some beautiful stewing meat from a dead animal. 534g should be about right. You will also need beautiful onions and garlic - the latter in great enough quantities so that you don't have to go and see Van Helsing. Next the mushrooms and beautiful red capsicum or paprika, depending on where you live. Some tinned tomatoes or tomato puree, beautiful of course. A stock cube and some - ahem - beautiful stew mix that you find in aisle 2. This is known in the Trade as Cheating.  The final, and obviously critical ingredient, is a bottle of the finest Belgian beer. For this particular recipe I chose some Rodenbach, which has been aged for the last 6 weeks in my fridge.   Method   Chop onions and garlic (beautifully) with a kitchen knife. Try not to cut your hand open this time. Then the meat, which can probably just be chopped in half as no-one will know. If you've got time, then chop the mushrooms in half and the capsicum or paprika into little bits.  While you are doing this - and this is proof that men can multitask - heat some water or oil in a big pot (like the one you see in the photo) with the heat on max. In order to clear space on the chopping board, you have to chuck everything in the pot as you go. Don't worry about browning the onions and the meat as it's a bloody waste of time and you'll only burn them.  By the time you've chopped up the beautiful mushrooms, almost everything, including the packet of stew mix, should be in or somewhere near the pot. But not the beer. You do this last, because that's what gives the Stew its authentic flavour. Timing and poise are everything.   Crack open the beer, pour half of it into the Stew which should now be bubbling away and will froth up when the beer goes in. You should drink the other half of the beer straight away or it will get warm. This helps the relaxation and gives you the necessary strength to continue.  Go away and leave the Stew for three quarters of an hour or longer if you've got something to do. This should be about the same time as it takes to listen to the entire Hammerklavier. Then stir it  hard , getting all the bits that have vulcanised themselves to the bottom of the pot into the general flow of the Stew. Once this is done, your beautiful Stew is ready to ingest.  Serve with spuds and more beer. And here's a trick that I learned when I was young at my father's knee: Open the page of  Larousse Gastronomique  to 'Botulism' because you can never be too careful.

      This is getting addictive. I was gunna wait a coupla days but I had spare time (i.e. it's not yet midnight) so I added a Golf Links on the right hand side of this bilgespot below the archives. So if any of youse have got an interesting link or putting green, then please email it to me and it will sit in the Link Evaluation Queue powered by SRAM and be put upon for some time. Thank you.  And now for some real news:  ...  [that's internet-speak for silence]  Yes that's right, I had a semi-day off today. Ooh la la, wot fun. I actually got up at sparrow fart (8:00am) to get 55 km in before I started work and took it easy, as did everyone else in the smallish bunch which was a bit odd for a Tuesday. Clearly all partied out from Monday.    urlLink Der Kaiser ist zurück!!!!! . Yeehaa, I say.  Apart from that, the most exciting cycling news of the day was that  urlLink Roberto Gaggioli  got suspended for a year for assaulting someone with a 2x4. What a goose. He should have used a 4x2. Or even a 4x4. Then the assaultee wouldn't have got up so quick. No comment about the horse hormones found in Mark French's room, suffice to say that I didn't put them there. He was only 19, and that reminds me of a bad song.  Speaking of bad songs, I've been listening to a combination of Rachmanninov (concertos 2 & 3), Nine Inch Nails, Björk, Vaughan Williams, Massive Attack and The Cardigans all at once. That means I now own music by a band that begins with "The". This wasn't the case prior to 2004, unless you count The Ludwig van Beethoven. What does this portend?  You can tell this has been an interesting day by the semi-congealed bits of gibberish that I am now pouring out onto the blog for posterior's sake. I think I did washing and shopping. The long weekend really took its toll on my muesli bar supply, but I'm happy to report it's back to pre-Christmas levels. No word on the chocolate ice cream burglar yet, but as I now have a brand new and UNOPENED (as of Wednesday, June 2, 12:06am) tub of Carte d'Or DARK chocolate ice creamy goodness, it's only a matter of time.  It's now Wednesday, June 2, 12:07am and the Carte d'Or DARK chocolate ice cream tub in the freezer - which is just a couple of metres away - is still unopened. Still. Unopened.  &lt;internal struggle&gt;  Several minutes pass...  &lt;/internal struggle&gt;  The reason why it's still unopened at 12:09am is that I actually went out to dinner chez Sunderlands in Zottegem and they had dame blanche with chocolate sauce which I found to be sufficient, especially after Authentic Flemish pork schnitzel (with Authentic Tandoori Colouring), mashed spud, mushrooms and cauliflower. I think there was tomato in there somewhere too. And some beer 'n wine 'n stuff. It was good to see S+S+S+T again, but S is looking a bit tired from looking after 1.5 year old T. The other S is busy collecting Pokemon cards and annoying T, while big S was just back from the Tour of Luxembourg where he was doing ok until the last day when he dehydrated himself a bit. It was warm there, yet two hours away in Belgium it was raining. Quelle strange weather Batman.  Uhm, so yeah, that was it. But wait, there's more. I added a Golf Links to the bilgespot and some more bilge. As I said above, this is getting dangerously addictive but I'll try and restrict myself to 2-3 posts a week. That might be easier than not opening the Carte d'Or chocolate ice cream tub on Wednesday, June 2 at 12:19am. Which I won't do of course. I have principles.  Morpheus is calling, Jeff p.s. thanks y'all for yer feedback. 'tis dangerous to encourage me ;-)

      It's late but here goes... (why does everyone hold their races on public holidays? Don't answer that).  As intended, I did get out to  urlLink Bottelare  (fourth one down) for a Monday kermis, and actually had a half decent race. There were only 31 starters, due to the large number of races on in the area. Must have been five or six within a 30 km radius, and all had between 30-60 starters. Although this makes it easier to finish in the top 30 :-) it actually makes for a harder race because the bunch splits up so quickly.  The course was 13 laps of 8.7 km, with some long straights, a climb/descent and three cobbled corners. Not a bad course at all actually. It was raining lightly when I rode out, and for the first part of the race the roads were half wet which made things interesting. It got even more interesting after about 5 laps when the heavens opened for a lap and it pissed down on us. I am slowly losing my fear of corners, but cobbles in the wet are never much fun.  As soon as it started raining, the bunch really sped up and everyone started attacking madly. I got up the front and held my posi for about half a lap (a Good Plan), then lost it all when a series of attacks went. The bunch blew to bits on the false flat/uphill headwind section, and very quickly a group of 16 formed that the rest of us had no hope in catching.  Not deterred this time, and more interested in getting some good race training in, I had a go over the top of the hill and took one guy with me. Unfortunately he was not so strong and was also the world's worst cornerer. I mean I'm bad enough, and I was putting several lengths into him around each one. Waiting, waiting, waiting... So we were doomed and the rest of the stragglers caught back on after about half a lap.  There were now 12 of us left and the 16 leaders were outta sight, so we rolled over fairly well for a whole lap, before I had another go on the climb. This time we ended up with six guys and we were all working!! Unheard of!! That made my day, believe me, and I was actually really surprised when we got caught by two others.  Still not deterred, I followed an attack by Peter Ballet (who rides with us on the Schelde) over the top of the hill, having determined that this was the best place to get a gap. This time we ended up with just four, and the others didn't come back. There was a strong Russian guy from Bert Story Piels (TT3) there and I didn't fancy my chances of getting away from him, so we just rode together for some more laps until they gave us the laatste ronde with 4 laps to go.   I had an ok sprint in that it  felt  fast, but I still ended up 4th out of 4 :-). I tried to glue myself to the Russian's wheel but he was hella strong. Anyway, ended up with 20th and a good 90 km in the legs so that was the object of the exercise. Last year I didn't get one top 20 result, even in a race where there were only 21 starters :-) [stem bolt came loose].   Jeez, better clean the bike again.  a demain, Jeff

      Last Friday evening, guess who rocked up to my place? It's pretty obvious if you've read the previous post. Yes that's right: My dear mother!  This Visitation was Planned from the beginning of course. Why she chose to arrive on the Friday before the Tour finished I dunno, but anyway it was good to see her again. Even if a little late. The connecting flight got cancelled by the baggage retrieval system they've got at Heathrow. I'm...so...worried about etc. So 6pm turned into 10pm.  The next day, she took it into her head to clean parts of the place. I am not sure why, as my apartment is  always  spic and span at all times. There is not a skeric of dust anywhere except perhaps under the couch. &lt;hastily moves couch&gt;  That done, Ma also took it upon herself to cook me dinner. Luxury. I have been living off instant rice for 2 weeks while the Tour has been on - not even any of my famous Kylie Kwong stews! So a real meal with vegetables and stuff was most welcome. Thanks Maw!   urlLink     What's cookin' maw?   On Sunday, Ma saw Brugghe while I stayed home and did the Tour. That was fun.  But on Monday, being an official Day Off (well, half a one), we partook of the festivities in town. It was the last day of Gentsefeesten and there were still a whole lotta people in Gent Centrum, generally milling around, drinking beer and carousing. So we joined them. Had a ride in a boat for fun and saw bits of Gent that I hadn't seen before. Then we had a fine meal in a very good Chinese(?) vegetarian restauraaaaaaaaant on the water. And wandered around a bit more.  The highlight of the evening was probably the band playing in the Korenmarkt. Appropriately entitled Kinky Afro, the band members were all attired in shiny silver disco suits with afro wigs, except in the case of the lead singer who had a shiny magenta wig thing. We were most entertained with tracks such as Crying at the Discotheque, Disco Inferno, She's a Maniac, We Are Family, I Will Survive etc. You get the idea, non?   It was very fine indeed!

      Yes, once again I'm watching Dolph Lundgren do his stuff in a fine piece of comedy called The Minion. Dolph plays a templar who looks like a vicar and has to stop the Minion from re-entering the world and causing brian damage. He failed, because I now have brian damage.  Speaking of minions, le Tour is over and we can all rest. The best man won again, but will he be back? It was not a boring race but the race for the GC was pretty much over by the prologue. Lance put 15 seconds into Jan in 6.5 bloody kilometres. For Jan to get that back? Dreamin'. The other two were ok, but Jan was the only one who dared to attack Lance (stage 15).  Speaking of stage 15, I will invoke Jones' Theorem 2 which I made up recently: Whenever Jan Ullrich does anything interesting, my TV doesn't work. Yes that's right, just a few hours before the stage started, my faithless TV blew a valve and the on/off button stopped working. I tried to get it to work by unscrewing the whole thing and fiddling around with some pliers.   I'd unplugged it but of course you can't tell if you're doing the right thing unless it's plugged in, so I did that and fiddled around with the pliers a bit more and lo! There was a mini-explosion, a puff of smoke and I was now  dead sure  that the TV wasn't working any more. The pliers, which were rubber handled, are now somewhat shorter.   It's always good to be certain. You see, it's like Schr&ouml;dinger's cat in a box. You don't know if the cat's dead or not until you open the box. But I reckon you can get around that by not feeding the cat for about 8 or 9 months. Then you're sure that the cat is dead without having to open the box and putting up with the smell. I always thought the poison vial/radioactive isotope thing was a bit too Heath Robinson. I mean, there's gotta be easier ways to do that experiment.  Anyway, having put my electrical know how to the best possible use, I decided to get a new telly, so I trundled down to the Fnac about 4pm (as Jan was doing his mighty attack) and bought the cheapest TV set I could find, which was a damn sight better than my existing blown up one. I then realised that I couldn't ride back home with it, so instead of catching the tram right outside the front door of the Fnac to almost right outside my door, I decided to hoof it along the canal back home, carrying the TV and looking like a right crim. Don't ask me why but I think I shortcircuited my logical thought capacitor with the pliers as well.  Oh well, got to see the replay.  I also had a Visitation from Ma over the final few days of the Tour, but that will have to wait until next time. Have fun in Madrid Ma and don't get stampeded by a bull.

      The Tour has congealed into one long day, and for the past two months it feels like it's been going on for longer than that. Even. I like the new Blogger Interface &reg; , it opens up a realm of possibilities. You can upload pics and stuff without going through the convoluted Picasa/Hellobot processje.  &nbsp; Speaking of Le Tour, looks like LA has got it in the bag again after a couple of days of Pyrenean undulations. Or ungulations if you follow our live cowerage. Der Kaiser didn't have it this year at all despite having slimmed down a bit. Oh well, I thought he was too out of condition in April, even though he was good in the Tour de Suisse. Basso and Kl&ouml;den look like being the runners up du jour. I think Lance'll have to retire before someone else wins el Tour. &nbsp; I dig Voeckler though.

      I made it, and as of today I am a number that is divisible by both 3 and 11 years old. Those of you with half a brain will work out that I am 99, although I don't look a day over 124. I place all the blame on Britney Spears. There's only so much a sane person can take. Maybe I should watch more cartoons? The cartoon network is good and I sometimes see Snagglepus, Top Cat and Tom & Jerry. They have a cat thing going there I see.  I'll keep this brief as my brain cells are limited. I did get out for a ride this morning in the beautiful summer weather, i.e. 13 degrees and raining. I don't understand. I demand all my weather investment money back now.   Along for the ride we had Mario De Clercq, the "retired" Johan Verhagen and one of his mates, who is built like a tank. It was the usual Sunday parcours, which has a few hills in it but is not as hard as Saturday. We did the 58 km in 1:26 which I reckon is not too shabby. The three aforementioned were the ones mainly responsible, and it didn't surprise me that we only had 10 riders left on the Trap Op. My left crank came loose towards the end which was a tad annoying, but it didn't fall off. I must try and find a socket spanner tomorrow.  Thanks all for the birthday wishes! Allez.

      Tuesday was the final day of my rather brief excursion to  le grand boucle  this year, as I finished off in Wasquehal at 7:30pm and proceeded to miss the 9pm train from Lille Flandres to Gent. There was a wormhole in time in the press room while I waited for my esteemed colleague to file le race reportage. I later learned that Wasquehal was one of the stops en route. Quelle blow. But anyway, I wasn't in  that  much of a hurry to get home.  Today's third stage wasn't that bad, although we did get stopped 5 km from getting to the start by the Belgian equivalent of a gendarme who did not know her job. Green sticker on l'auto means we can get on le bloody parcours. Nous sommes le droite dammit! But although we tried, there's no point in arguing with a cop  and we eventually turned back and went along via the totally stupid deviation and arrived at the start with only an hour to go, a tad ruffled. That meant there was no time to hobnob with VIPs in the village depart, which is mainly what we are paid to do of course.  We did get enough done in limited time and I had a good chat with Patrick Lefevere (Quick.Step) about today's stage which contained two Paris-Roubaix style cobbled sections (3.8 km at 65 km to go and 1.1 km with 25). Lefevere didn't think that they would have much effect by themselves, but the complete panic that they instilled in the Spanish teams caused a big crash just before the first secteur pavé with 70 km to go and guess what? Aupa Iban Mayo fell off and lost four bloody minutes(!), despite the best efforts of his team to drag him back. The yellow jersey dude Thor Hushovd also ended up with hold the Mayo, but that wasn't as important for the final overall results. Mayo's going to lose another 2'00 in the team time trial tomorrow so that'll put him at 6'00 behind Lance and co. and it will take some pretty spiffy riding in les Pyrenees and les Alpes to pull that back.  It was a really hard stage and a very interesting one as the US Posties, Phonak and T-Mobile (mainly) drove the rest of the bunch very fast right to the finish in Wasquehal, which Roger Hughes described as "a not very interesting suburb of Roubaix". Quite. A French dude won (JP Nazon), same guy who won the last stage in Paris last year. And Robbie took the yellow, which was good for the Gallant Aussie Lads, who have been suffering of late.  Press room was in Wasquehal tennis centre, which had the advantage of being big but the disadvantage of being stifling hot. Oh well, no more complaints as I'm on me way home now and have to do production for the next 2.5 weeks. Being actually  on  the race is a bit of hassle, but it's miles better as you actually get to  write  all the stories rather than just produce them. And also it's good to say g'day to people  every day, make new contacts, and drink gallons of coffee and beer.   urlLink     Le magnificently appointed press room in Wasquehal.    All in all it has been a productive few days, and we have already gotten plenty of kudos so far. Tim's royal  faux pas  made it onto Belgian radio today. Hehe :-) Even better, Lance's girlfriend Sheryl Crow (of singing fame) gave us a nice plug on USA's OLN Tour coverage this morning: "Lance and I have gotten into a habit of getting up in the morning, making coffee and getting online to read Cyclingnews.com and others like ProCycling and Velonews etc."   Thanks Sheryl! Quelle notoriety. It's all achieved through smoke and mirrors and a seriously overworked set of servers.   Here's my final GC prediction after today. I reserve the right to change it at any moment:  1 Lance 2 Jan 3 Hamilton 4 Heras  Damn, I'm going to lose all my fluency in French now.

      Today was my second last day on Le Tour 2004 and it wasn't so bad. Monsieur Tim and I are into our rhythm now and are pumping out le TOUR news like it's going out of style. We get by with a little help from our friends.  Today the start was in beautiful downtown Charleroi, which is a downmarket and more industial version of Liege. It looks as though it hasn't been washed for 30 years, kind of like Tim and I on Day 3 of Le Tour. But there was one good bit in the middle where the stage started - a large square in front of the Beaux Arts Musee or Opera, I can't remember which.   Charleroi, being named after King Charles, set the scene for a rather royal day ite and abite in Belgique. Firstly the Belgian prime minister Guy Verhofstadt rocked up at le depart and was wandering around alone, no minders or anything, appreciating the atmos. He was being interviewed by Belgian radio and I thought I'd have next crack at him, but to be honest I couldn't think of a decent question to ask so I talked to Matty Wilson instead. He had to tow Brad McGee to the line yesterday after McGee buggered his back gardening two weeks ago. That's nearly as bad as Jalabert slipping off a ladder changing a lightbulb!!  Thankfully it was only a short hop to the finish in Namur, which is a much more pleasant city than Charleroi, being at the junction of the Sambre and the Meuse. The press room was good and there was a great buffet which was taken advantage of by two members of our staff.  There was more fun to come as during the stage, the one and only King of Belgium rolled up and strolled through the press room!! This time there were many minders and securite, but Tim still managed to commit a big royal faux pas and ask the King a question without being spoken to first :-) He was put up to it by a couple of Gazet van Antwerpen journos, but hey, we were the only ones in the press room to get a quote from the King of Belgium today!   One of our other people, John Trevorrow (Iffy) managed to slip the King an Aussie badge or something, and when he met Robbie McEwen (who won the stage) he had made a great Royal Joke about kangaroos and such like. Guy Verhofstadt and Eddy Merckx were also there so it was a pretty good photo op. I was busy doing other stuff but.  The last bit of royalty for the day was when we visited the US Postal hotel for a very modestly sized press conference with Lance himself. Tim went in but I had to sit outside out of respect for the 5 other journos there, as otherwise we'd outnumber them ;-) That was ok, as I didn't have to transcribe it at dinner so I could enjoy my supersized glass of Hoegaarden followed by a less gigantic Leffe blond in relative peace.   I also got to watch Lance's security staff throw out an overly keen fan who decided to wander in through the open window. That was fun. Lance's personal bodyguard is a big guy.  How did it get to be this late again?

      Bloody hotel phones don't ever work. You'd think it would be easy to get online in a Novotel, but for a still unexplained reason I couldn't. Grumble. At least we left the high class establishment in Liege. I don't think I'll be staying there again, although the cold shower in the morning was really such a welcome variation.  Today was the first road stage from Liege to Charleroi, a real dingy industrial town in south-central Belgium. In typical Belgian style it rained off and on for most of the day but dried up at the finish. The start was OK as I got a brief interview with Eddy Merckx, who is looking rather svelte these days but a bit worn. He was on the France 2/3 show for about 3/4 hour before I managed to get hold of him, as you can sort of see from the pic below. Unfortunately someone must have jogged Mitch Clinton's arm when he was taking the shot, 'cos he got the wrong bloke! Anyway, one for the record.   urlLink     Eddy Merckx (R) clearly from a bad angle. Photo &copy; Mitch Clinton   What happened in the stage? Don't ask me as I was writing some news and freezing my fingers off in the press tent, which was scenically placed in a fruit marché somewhere near the finish line. It rained and there were crashes and the French got really excited when Nicolas Jalabert went down in the last 20 km. Oohlala.   I felt sorry for Brad who had a bad back and lost 6 minutes. He was in such good condition too, but his Tour may come to a grinding halt. And Nick Gates lost half an hour after a crash halfway. The race jury decided he was too slow and eliminated him later. So the gallant Aussie lads are down to eight, with Brad teetering. Maybe Robbie or Stuey or Cookie or Alby or Scotty or Dodger or Matty will win one.  Finding the hotel was significantly harder, as they did not know how to give directions. "We're coming from Namur, which exit do we take?" "Exit 9 sir to Wavre".  We took exit 9 sir and ended up tooling around in a parque scientifique which did not look like the Novotel. Rang 'em back. "Which exit do we take? We just took exit 9 and we can't find you." "Oh no, you should have taken exit 6 which is Wavre 9." Or something like that.  Nous had le dinner buffet style next to two thirds of the SBS crew (Mike Tomalaris and Honi Rowley) and chatted for a bit. Well, I mostly exclude myself from this apart from "yes", "no" and "that's terrible" placed at strategic intervals while Honi told us of her near leg amputation after a skiing accident in Aspen earlier this year. Ouch.  Then the phones didn't work again. Only a coupla days and then I'm back home :-)

      Allez le grand depart. Yes, today the Tour de Tour finally kicked off from downtown Liège with a 6.1 km time trial against the prologue. Er, clock. Wind. And stuff.   Anyway, after  a truly sumptuous breakfast in our chic Hotel Metropole (right opposite Liège Guillemins station - you can't miss it although you might want to), we headed off to le press room to mingle with les autre journalistes. See I'm quite getting the hang of this French lingo. I reckon I'll have it down fluent like in the next few days.   The first test of my new found French skills was le conference du press on le measures anti-dopage given by five of le big Tour bosses. I conclude that my French needs a  little  more work, but you can read about le test on Cyclingnews if you so desire. It's cool that the Aussie blood test finally got accepted after four years. This could be interesting.  Matt White crashed before the start! The boy is seemingly not destined to ride Le Tour.  I moseyed on down to the actual race about 4pm to have a bit of a look and do some stuff, and I met Kim from Helmond (literally) and caught up with all the goss after a year and a half. Thanks for the bikkies! Then I just soaked up l'ambience and took a few happy snaps for le reportage live. I'd only worked out how to do that less than an hour previous, so I was quite impressed when it actually worked.  The next six hours passed rather quickly. Dunno why. Did some work and stuff and met a few new people. Lotta Anglos on Tour this year which is rather good.   So FABIAN (nice kid) won the prologue! Nice going dude. He was the only guy we got a quote from yesterday so I feel vindicated. Allez Brad wasn't quite up to it but he reckoned it's because he's thinned down a bit. Good thing too, as he's such a lard arse. And Lance showed them all by finishing second - he's got his racing legs on again and he's going to be bloody hard to beat this year. But it's won in the third week. We shall see.  Finished off with a very late dinner in the same restauraaaaaaaaant as we went to last night. This time we had the photogs with us, Jon Devich and Casey B. Gibson and the Sunshine Band. That was quite fun actually. It's very good, not so expensive and they (meaning le management) are nice and friendly. Even offered us a drinkypoo on the house but it was apres midnight and nous sommes pooped. Then it was back to our low joint opposite le gare. Oohlala. Quelle bon etablissement.

      Well, I'm officially at Le Tour in Liege - in body at least. I got up at some heinous hour on Friday morning to catch the train and didn't miss it, but the accumulation of non-sleeping hours this week really took its toll. I hooked up with Monsieur Maloney and spent the rest of the day in the press room trying to locate my brain, missing press conferences and generally starving. Un jour sans, as they say.   urlLink     The lovely smoke-free press room. *cough*   We finally got out of there around 9pm and had a nice meal containing frites and stuff at a local restauraaaaaaaant. Then back to our lovely hotel. We are staying at the "Hotel Metropole" opposite Liege-Guillemins station. It can best be described as a horrendously priced low joint. It reminds me of the inaccurately named "Hotel Adjacent Casino" where I stayed for the 2001 Tour Down Under (before Cyclingnews was persona grata). My room was conveniently located next to the lift shaft, ensuring my beauty sleep was kept to a healthy minimum.   urlLink     The Hotel Metropole in Liege. Classy.   Today is the prologue. Allez McGee!

      This will be long, as I have All the Time in the World (cue James Bond theme). I make no apologies. The beer hasn't kicked in yet, but it will. Why am I drinking beer? Because it's 30 degrees, thus Damn Hot. Also I just demolished everything in the fridge/cupboard/secret food hiding places so beer is the last resort. Yes, I done a race today and with the riding there and back it was over 160 km all up. That makes one thirsty in this heat.   But first, this week's moofie. I been waiting all July to see Spiderman II so I took the opportunity to do so. I seen all the ads and music videos on my non-blown up telly, so I was definitely keen. I liked the first one. The second one is much the same, although the villain is different because the Green Goblin, aka  urlLink Willem Dafoe  aka  urlLink Jørgen Bo Petersen  was killed in the last ep.  Instead the new villain is Dr Otto Octavius, who ends up with a whole lotta mechanical arms and a chip controlling his thoughts after he tried the old cold-fusion-in-a-bathtub experiment. But the cool thing is that the Green Goblin's son, aka  urlLink James Franco  looks like  urlLink Filippo Pozzato . Cool, hey? And I reckon Dolph Lundgren is Raimondas Rumsas, just a bit bigger.  Back to the plot, such as it is. Or isn't. I think Dr Octavius wants to go further with cold fusion, and more power to him I say. But he keeps getting foiled by Spiderman. The other thing that happens is a much overdone love triangle between Spidey, MJ Watson (the love interest) and her husband to be, let's call him Bruce to save confusion. It's very overdone but this is a comic strip so that can be expected. All parties are more or less satisfied in the end. But I suspect there will be a Spiderman III.   Lokeren   The midweek racing fixture of choice was out at Lokeren today. There's a music festival on there at the moment, which means they were playing Madonna's Holiday over the loudspeakers at the start. I done the inaugural edition of this race last year and I remember it was pretty ordinary: 35 degrees, lost one of my bottles on the first cobbled section and had to call it quits after 60 km. This year it wasn't quite 35 degrees but it was over 30, so I set out from Gent with a total of 5.25 litres of water in various bottles. It was a 25 km ride but I had the sun at my back and there was a light breeze blowing from somewhere, which gladdened the heart.   &lt;Rachmaninov interlude&gt;  En route, I was caught up by various and sundry members of Staf Boone's Kingsnorth International Wheelers. AKIRA Wong was there, as was the Welsh Mari Lwyd, whose name is Ian. Funny name for a skeletal grey mare, but I guess you gotta call them something. Also two Pommie guys and Matt Chessum, so it was truly an International mix of Wheelers.  The sign on cafe was on the main road, as were the kleedkamers, so it wasn't too much drama to find. But on getting there, we found that there was an actual queue to sign on! I was surprised, as we ended up with over 80 starters including a delegation from France. It looked a bit like their track team actually. Two guys had rainbow stripes on their sleeves and one of them was Jerome Neuville, who won the world madison and points race champs on the track (I think). It didn't really matter, as these races are always hard no matter who turns up. It was a good quality field and that was fine by me - only way to improve is by racing against those better than you.  Local lad Mario Willems was here too. He is a top rider and is the favourite in any race he enters. He's good enough to turn pro but prefers the amateur lifestyle - he can win lots of races, make a decent amount of money from bonuses, and works for a living. Nice bloke too. We had a chat to him in the kleedkamers.  We rocked up to the start and were all set to go, but there was a problem as the police hadn't cleared the whole parcours and were still out there. This took over half an hour, and was a pain in the arse, not to mention hot. Darren Young and Nathan Clarke (from Tassie) reckoned that they had found a cafe around the back and were checking the quality of its (liquid) wares. The announcer didn't know what had happened. Nor did we.   The race finally started sometime after 15:30 and much to my dismay, there was to be no shortening of the parcours. We had to do 13 laps of 8.6 km, with two cobbled sections a lap. The first was 400m long and was pretty rough, but there was a gutter you could ride in and slowly destroy your wheels by hitting drainage grates and sand. I chose this option, as it was still faster. The second sector was about 800m long and led right up to the start/finish. It wasn't as rough, but there was nowhere to hide. It was also slightly uphill.  After last year's experience, I took an extra 500mL bidon in my back pocket, even though one of the Kingsnorth  begeleiders  (the kiddie) offered to give me a bottle. But I declined, remembering Andrew Benson's experience a couple of months back. This turned out to be a good option, as both of them stood on the bottom half of the course which was the fastest section. At a minimum we were lined out doing 50 km/h along there; at a maximum I hit 57.5 km/h. It wasn't downhill either. So these two goons were standing there every lap, holding out bottles, while they could see that it was flat stick in the peloton and everyone was glued to the wheel in front at eyeball popping speed. I remarked to Ian, the Welsh Mari Lwyd, and AKIRA, that they could be better served by having the  begeleiders  stand after the start/finish, where the speed was never much over 40 km/h. They both agreed, but it was Too Late Now.  I'd better get on with this race report.  After 1 km of warmup at 28 km/h, we then started going at a heinous speed for several laps. On the smooth bits of the course, no matter where we were, the speed was always 48-50 km/h. It was a bit slower on the cobbles and the corners, three of which were cobbled out of spite (I thought). We averaged nearly 44 km/h for the first hour, which I guess is standard for this quality field, and there were some breakaways. Don't ask for names.  My aim was merely to stay out of trouble and complete the distance. I felt OK so I thought if there was still a chance in the last four laps, I'd get involved in the action. I was navigating the cobbles and corners pretty well, and felt 10% better than last Saturday. Well, that's a qualitative engineering-type 10% anyway.  We did manage to bring back the early break(s) after about 5-6 laps, probably because they were too big and no-one wanted to work. I snuck up to the front to see what was happening and after a couple of laps managed to get away in a nice group of about 20-25. I rolled through for a couple of turns but people were more interested in looking behind rather than actually working so it collapsed/imploded into the kermis breakaway black hole. So much energy for such a non-result.  We slowed down markedly after 7 laps as people started to get tired of going at heinous speeds in the heat. But even when we slowed down to what felt like a crawl, the bunch was strung out nearly all the time. Of course, with about 5 laps to go a break of what I think was 28 riders did get away and stayed away. Mario Willems won (I think) and good on him. I honestly didn't notice that many riders go off the front, but I did notice that the peloton had suddenly got small, thin and weedy. I hoped it was merely attrition and that we were in with a shout of a top 15, but it was not to be.  I spent the next few laps trying to get in a move but didn't really have the sustainable legs. Getting there though, and a couple more races I should be back to where I was before I wasn't. Had a go on the last lap too, but folks started to speed up for some reason. Dunno why. I got into a decent posi for the "sprint" on the cobbles, but I couldn't really give it the works because my big chainring is worn out and would skip at inopportune times (getting a new crankset tomorrow, I hope). Actually the real reason was that I was basically knackered. I think I ended up about 40th, well out of the money today but pretty happy with the way things went, as the objet d'exercise was to get a goodly number of kilometres in at race speed. I had an average of 42 km/h at the finish too.  Unfortunately, when I got back into the kleedkamers, I couldn't find my licence! I turned my bag out but no dice. I figured I must have left it at the sign on, so when I went back to hand my number in I asked the officials for it. I got the impression that they had found my licence, and they told me to ask down at the bar for it. I did this, but the bar manager said 'nope' and told me to ask the officials upstairs. I did this, but the officials said 'nope' and told me to ask the bar manager downstairs. I did this, but the bar manager said 'nope' and told me to ask the officials upstairs. I did this (are you  sure  you don't have it?), but the officials said 'nope' and gave me a number to phone to get a replacement.  I was not plussed but I couldn't do anything so I set off home. After a few kms, one of the officials pulled up beside me and said that they've found my licence (upstairs...) and will send it to me post-haste. Fine. I hope I can get it back to race in Bottelare on 't weekend.  It was quite a pleasant ride home in the evening heat and I actually felt quite good. Journo World Championships are at the end of August near Verona, Italy, so I'm hoping I'll have the necessary form to do well. Of course, after the 2002 debacle, even getting to the start line will be a victory for me! Oh god, the scars...I have yet to do a Journo World's, so hopefully this'll be the first!   Wow, this post took more than two complete Rachmaninov Piano Concerti to write. The beer still hasn't kicked in at all, but that's probably a good thing.

      It's not quite Twin Peaks, and I'm not quite that funny looking dude or Kyle or Stan or Bob for that matter. No, it's something udderly mundane: me first race back in Merelbeke. This won't take long.  'twas brilling, and a warmish sort of a day - 30 degrees, sunny with a light wind. The race was very close by but the course was cod ordinary. 25 laps of 3.5 km, with 800m of cobbles per lap, a little hill over the railway after the cobbles, and 8 corners. It wasn't a course where you could sit in and watch the world go by, gently turning over the pedals behind the wheel in front. Oh no, there was none of that. Even the tailwind wasn't much use because it was across the cobbles. Argh.  It was an Open race, which tend to be slightly easier than kermis races because there are less toppers. But we still had guys like big bad Bart Velghe and Tom Vlerick and more besides among the modestly sized field of 32 (ik denk). First lap on the cobbles was ok, as a few of us got on the bike path which was smooth. But then the commissaire waved us off it, saying we had to ride on the cobbles. Bugger and curses.  It took approx. drie ronden for the field to explode as a group of 11 got off the front and waved ta-ta. Being as it was my first race back and in the heat to boot, my two stroke heart/lung engine was not really up to doing much in the way of chasing or attacking. But I knew that with a course like this and the warm weather, it was going to be a race of elimination and the idea was to stay out of trouble.  Once the 11 rode off into the sunset, the rest of us set about making the group a bit smaller. After about 35 km I think we were left with a very sociable eight man group, although with three riders from the same team in there it wasn't that easy.  The group formed again and yet again as endless eons wheeled and passed. I was one of the eons getting wheeled and passed all the time, but I persisted. We got the Word after 14 laps that we had 3 laps to go, which prompted more attacking. I was not in the mood and couldn't do much about it when three guys sorta sidled off the front on the cobbles. They were the strongmen anyway, so Order was maintained instead of Primal Chaos reigning.  On the last lap I thought 'bugger this, I've got buckleys in a sprint on cobbles so I'll try to give the rest the slip'. I went with about 2 km to go, just as a couple of riders had got on the back of our now three man group. That gave me the breathing space to execute my cunning plan and I took off up the back section in pursuit of a Glorious 15th place. Unfortunately I was foiled when one guy took it upon himself to chase after me. Dang. I held him off until 200m to go but he cheated and went onto the footpath for most of the cobbled section/finish straight and thus, my huge prize was somewhat diminished and I finished 16th.  I complained to the commissaires but they just said "No problems" - even though they believed me and probably saw it - so the results stood. Rafferty's rules. Still, I made me point.  So it was an expected result for the first race back. Need to get the turbo extension for my two-stroke, but a few more races and it should kick in.  On Sunday (that would be today) I did the Berchem ride for the first time in aaaaaaaages (&gt; 2 months). Henk, of fietstocht fame, was there also for the first time. We started off slowly but the pace picked up when the Kid decided to do some training in the second half. Damn he's strong. I followed him on one of the last climbs and just got his wheel, but had problems holding it even on the downhill! On the next climb, which I reckon is the hardest, I kept his wheel right to the top before the mind wasn't willing any more and I let him go. HR &lt; 180 which was good - much better than last time when he dropped me on that same climb. There just wasn't that extra bit of fuel in the tank, due to yesterday's race.  I then rode home via some very cool back roads with Henk, who  really  knows this area of Flanders. I hear that he's planning another fietstocht to the Carrefour de l'Arbre (part of Paris-Roubaix) soonish...that should be a whole lotta fun.  Finally, allez Stuey O'Grady for being the  urlLink first Aussie to win a World Cup ! Way to go dude!
