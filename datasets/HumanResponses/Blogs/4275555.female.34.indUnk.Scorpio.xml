      Just read this that someone posted on the OS, is it me or does he mention 3 different releases here......  From Ross Halfin's Diary on his website:  Thought I'd have a lazy Sunday. Checked my diary and realised the person who does it hasn't put any recent pictures up.....I'll rectify this today. Speak to Phil Collen, haven't spoken to him in a year, he tells me there's a Def Leppard Greatest Hits CD coming out for Christmas (again) and a rock version of Vault. He thinks the record company are flogging a dead horse and he's had nothing to do with it. He's in London for a couple of weeks. Told him Joe had played me the covers album they'd done....Phil seemed very disheartened by it all....I must say they've done a great version of Rock On by David Essex (won't tell you the rest as it'll spoil it).  1. Def Leppard Greatest Hits CD 2. Rock version of Vault (or does he mean the above is a rock version of Vault) 3. Covers album  Why would they release 3 all round about the same time, although not sure when the cover album is due, they ought to call one of em Dazed and Confused cause I know I am lol.

      I can't believe the weekend is nearly over, I haven't done anything hardly apart from recover all day yesterday from Friday night out with the girls, then got rid of 5 black bin liners of crap from the spare bedroom today, where it came form I've no idea as it doesn't look like there's less stuff in there.  Oh well feel better for the clean out.  Didn't have the internet last night as hubby was messing with the cables, I felt so lost, I didn't realise how much I use it and depended on it, have I no life lol?  Kate.

      Driving to work I saw this Sky TV van parked at the side of the road, I nearly crashed the car as the paintwork on it was huge leopard print, covered every inch of it, it was soooo cool.  I'm so glad it's Friday, it's been the longest week of my life.  Kate.
