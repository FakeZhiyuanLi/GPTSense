      &nbsp;&nbsp; Yea well I guess today was about like all of the rest of them, pretty god damned boring, really not much to put in here, I didnt get around to doing a whole lot today... Well lets get started, well yesturday I went down to 1 Normal Plaza to play hockey with a few guys that he knew...but when we got there they had just finished painting some of the rink, so we went out there, it was dry and was fine to play on and all, we think that a lot of guys didnt come because they thought that the rink would be closed...so my dad, frank (one of my dad's friends), and I all got there and started messing around for a little bit, I fell on some dust and leaves and shit and cut my elbow really bad, oh well I got another one... but we had been there for about 20 minutes then another guy showed up, we didnt know him, his name was dan too, kind of weird?!?! but then a few other older guys that my dad knew showed up a little after him...well that was pretty fun, the other dan was really good, pretty fun watching him skate and all, but he was about the only other person that was any good...so thats about all I did yesturday but today was so exciting!!! Omg it started off, you wont believe this, but I did my paper route!!! yea I know amazing eh???&nbsp; Well then I just went back to bed, talked to tasha, took the dog out, talked to tasha, ate, talked to tasha, really just the same ol stuff, then went to weight lifting and just played racketball and a little basketball the whole time, it was fun and then I came back here and finished my most recent mod to my pc...I'll post a pic a little later...but Im gonna go now, gettin&nbsp;a lil hungry...but whatever, I'll prolly right in here tomoro cause Tasha is leavin for Florida...Ima be so freakin bored!!!!

       Wow so yesterday I agreed to help my grandpa put in a fan...we had done one before and it wasn't a problem at all, so I was like "ok, it shouldn't be a problem at all, ya know, short lil hour long project"...well it ended up taking three fucking hours which really pissed the hell out of me, all I could think about was going home and talkin to Tasha, but when we were putting it up I really doubted that would ever happen but we got it done pretty easily, it was just quite different than other ones that we had put in... Well his idea was that we would have to get up into the&nbsp;attic and cut and install 2X4's to mount the fan mount to, but, me being the incredible thinker that I am ;), hah, decided that if we just found longer screws we could modify the fan enough to mount it to the fan mount that we had already, so he went out to his shed and found some, took about 3 trips but he finally found some and so I checked it to see if it would fit, and it would, the only problem was that the ring to cover the screws at the top wouldn't fit if we did it my way, so he took the fan out to the garage and drilled some new holes, and we got it in nice and neat, I was pretty happy with it, it was uneven at first but I was happy that just a few hits and turns got it to slip into place and sit right...well I made $10 for 3 hours of work, I wasn't really expecting to get anything so I was pretty happy about that...then my grandma and sister had left and took their newer car (which is extremely nice and great to drive by the way), so I was left taking my grandpa's old beater home, fuckin gas pedal was all ghetto and there really isnt a muffler left, its just sort of a rusted out box now, but it was fun, the steering wheel was huge so i felt so weird driving it but I got us to my house safe and sound, pretty fast too actually =), and thats what really matters, right? hah, of course not, who cares how safe we get there, all that matters is that we make it in less time than we have in the past!&nbsp; But now I'm gonna go so I can take the dog out...

      &nbsp;Well so yesturday after I ran for xcountry I went to Wendy's and got a spicy chicken with a frosty, you're probably wondering why the hell thats important...well those things are amazing!&nbsp; If you've never had one, go run now, straight to the nearest Wendy's!!!&nbsp; So yesturday I decided that since I had the time, Tasha was gone otherwise I would have been talkin to her the whole time, I decided to take my pistol out...I got the red dot sight correctly sighted now and I have shot around 200 rounds through it already, it will hold 7 rounds and fire them semi-auto but it is supposed to hold 10, if more than 7 are loaded the damned thing would misfire quite a bit, but I dont mind that cause the gun is powerful, accurate, and just down right sexy...then i talked to Tasha for&nbsp;a while and then went back to doing basically nothing... I decided that I would take all of my games off of my pc and do some virus/spyware scans, came up clean so I defraged my harddrive as well...oh yea, sometime in there I had the time to try to mess with Fedora Linux for a bit but couldn't do too much there...and so my next big idea now is to start a website or two, if anyone wants to help me out with this then please get a hold of me, I'll prolly make one that wont be updated too much and then another that will be mostly about overclocking and computer things such as reviews and all...the first one shouldn't take really any time at all but the second one is gonna be quite a bit harder, I want the pc site to look nice and proffesional, but my site I wont really care too much about...well its about time for me to take a nap, I'll prolly end up puttin up another post later on today...

        Wow so many things happened today!!!! Well not really, I ended up getting back up at 9:53 and I ate some jellybeams for breakfast... yea not too healthy but oh well, so then I got online at excactly 10:02 and talked to Tasha forever, and I skipped weight lifting just for my Tasha!!! So we talked for a long while and then I went to my grandparents house at 12:15 and ate some pizza from Pizza Hut.&nbsp; Then I went Walmart with my grandpa for a few things for them so I picked up a red dot sight for my pistol...I was so proud of myself..I finally parked without having to back up like 3 times...yea thats right after a whole month of driving I can now park! Woot bitches, woot!&nbsp; So I drove home and then found out that the damn mount rails on my pistol were too small for the sight. But that wasnt a problem, just about 10 minutes with my trusty dremel and it fits perfect now!&nbsp; I'll be takin it out back to sight it in and work with it a little more.&nbsp; So yea, I guess most of the afternoon I just sat online talkin to my baby girl, pretty fun, nothing else that I would rather do...so then at about 5 she went to babysit for madelyn, shes this little 3 year old girl that gets pretty annoying I guess, all I know is that her mom pays a butt load of money for Tasha to do it! Rarr...and I took off to weight lifting a little before 6.&nbsp; Weight lifting was fun, we warmed up playing racketball for a while then we lifted, I was surprised of myself becuase I got the whole work out done and i actually worked pretty hard and then did some extra work and did a bit of rope work&nbsp;as well...So when I got home I got on my computer, yea not a big surprise but then to my surprise, I was messing with the speeds of my pc and now I got them even higher (AMD 2600+ @ 2300mhz stable, equivelant to a decent p4 about 3.2ghz) and then, like normal when I was on my pc I went through a few geek sights because I figured Tasha was still babysitting and I would call her at 9:00, which I did and we had a pretty fun convo, but now its about 10:40 and Im gonna be gettin in bed soon.....

          So yea...I guess I ended up fallin to sleep around 1:30ish last night and then had get up at 5:00 for my paper route. Well that shit took forever to get done, I was just way too tired to do it and all, so then when I got back I decided to get online and look at some stuff...I guess I was lookin at CO2 pistols this morning or somethin which led me to go out and get one from Walmart, I got a $90 retail Gamo P23 for about $60.&nbsp; I havent gotten the chance to take it out and fire some rounds off because all the ammo I have is a box of pellets, the gun can shoot them one at a time, but whats the fun in that when you can fire off 9 bb's in row???&nbsp; And my mom wants me to get some safety glasses so I dont lose an eye or somethin, fuck that!!!!&nbsp; But yea, after I got that I just came home and did practically nothing for a long ass while and then finally got to talk to Tasha for a while...Then tonite I ran at X-Country, I went about 5 miles which aint too bad but I just wanted to get home...So I got home and grabbed a bit to eat then took a long ass shower and played some CS, then, luckily, Tasha got on!!! Woohoo..except we never talk too much online. But when she called around 10:00 I was all excited and I got a rush of energy real quick and we had a lot of fun talkin on the phone, lol, I cant remember anything really that we talked about, but it was fun!&nbsp; So after we got done on the phone I got on here and started writing in my blog again....and then guess who called.....Tasha!!!!&nbsp; Well she's dumb and she has a ghetto tv and vcr and it was only showin stuff in B+W.&nbsp; Amazingly, I couldnt help her...mostly just cause I'm all tired and cranky but yea...now I feel bad...just cause I didnt fix something with electricity in it!!!! Rarrrr....but oh well, its gettin late so Im gonna be headin off to bed hear pretty quick......
