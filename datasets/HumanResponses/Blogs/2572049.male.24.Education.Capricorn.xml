         Be impeccable with your word.  Speak with integrity. Say only what you mean. Avoid using the word to speak against yourself or to gossip about others. Use the power of your word in the direction of truth and love.    Don’t take anything personally.  Nothing others do is because of you. What others say and do is a projection of their own reality, their own dream. When you are immune to the opinions and actions of others, you won’t be the victim of needless suffering.   Don’t make assumptions.  Find the courage to ask questions and to express what you really want. Communicate with others as clearly as you can to avoid misunderstandings, sadness and drama. With just this one agreement, you can completely transform your life.   Always do your best.  Your best is going to change from moment to moment; it will be different when you are healthy as opposed to sick. Under any circumstance, simply do your best, and you will avoid self-judgment, self-abuse and regret.

      Abbreviation of Transmission Control Protocol, pronounced as separate letters. TCP is one of the main protocols in TCP/IP networks. Whereas the IP protocol deals only with packets, TCP enables two hosts to establish a connection and exchange streams of data. TCP guarantees delivery of data and also guarantees that packets will be delivered in the same order in which they were sent.   Abbreviation of Internet Protocol, pronounced as two separate letters. IP specifies the format of packets, also called datagrams, and the addressing scheme. Most networks combine IP with a higher-level protocol called Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), which establishes a virtual connection between a destination and a source.

      If the grass is greener on the other side, then the guy with the greener grass doesn't think your grass is greener now does he, asshole? The message that this proverb is trying to stumble through is that everything always looks more attractive when you don't have it. I'm sure there are millionaires crying themselves to sleep every night because they don't live in a trailer park. Just face it: sometimes nobody envies you. There has to be a bottom and that bottom is probably you.  just saw this from a site...makes sense huh?

      (v) To copy files to a second medium (a disk or tape) as a precaution in case the first medium fails. One of the cardinal rules in using computers is  Back up your files regularly.   Even the most reliable computer is apt to break down eventually. Many professionals recommend that you make two, or even three, backups of all your files. To be especially safe, you should keep one backup in a different location from the others.   You can back up files using operating system commands, or you can buy a special-purpose backup utility. Backup programs often compress the data so that backups require fewer disks.   (n) (1) The act of backing up.   (2) A substitute or alternative. The term backup usually refers to a disk or tape that contains a copy of data.

      ----------------------   An engineer's valentine    My life was once gloomy and dark  Devoid of all the voltages and spark  Then my aerials caught your weak signal  Filtered, demodulated, amplified, it was a PCM signal.   Your pulse resonated with mine  With such a frequency even NTC's decline  The oscilloscope monitor's no good  Even the spectrum analyzer's not in the mood   You upload data streams onto my RDRAM  Sweet memories that make my hot circuits calm  You were there to troubleshoot my complex schematics  And it made my assembly-code life as easy as mathematics.   My attitudes were as hot as a resistor, stubborn as an inductor  You became my heatsink, filtered ripples like a capacitor  My omni-directional goals were multiplexed and my dreams went full-duplex  Oh Kirchoff, Newton, Einstein, life should've been simplex.   You switched my frames and routed my packets  You opened my ports and took charge of my rockets  Where's the socket that leads to the main outlet?  Sometimes interference is included in the design of subjects.   You open-sourced my windows into a wider world  I say this poem is getting hard to behold  Boredom is a thing that's sure hard to meet  So let's all together press ctrl-alt-delete.

      you can smell the season of love in the air, langya eh all episodes of TV shows from mornign till evening are all about lovers...but then did you ever wonder why does your partner suddenly came up with a briliant idea to go out either on the 13th or the 15th kasi para walang kasabay. kesho trapik, marami tao on restaurants, no vacancies on motels, jampacked movie houses, and no place to go but spend a valentines day at home. reasonable and practical enough nga naman diba? well too bad for you at number two ka na lang, kasi ang 14th ay para kay number 1....magulat ka pa pag nagplano na lang umalis sa 16th or 17th para talagang sure ang lakad, malamang number 3 or 4 ka na lang. Tough luck!

      RESIGNATION ====   I am hereby officially tendering my resignation as an adult. I have decided I would like to accept the responsibilities of an 8 year-old again.   I want to go to McDonald's and think that it's a four star restaurant.   I want to sail sticks across a fresh mud puddle and make a sidewalk with rocks.   I want to think M&Ms are better than money because you can eat them.   I want to lie under a big oak tree and run a lemonade stand with my friends on a hot summer's day.   I want to return to a time when life was simple, when all you knew were colors, multiplication tables, and nursery rhymes,but that didn't bother you, because you didn't know what you didn't know and you didn't care.   All you knew was to be happy because you were blissfully unaware of all the things that should make you worried or upset.   I want to think the world is fair.   That everyone is honest and good.   I want to believe that anything is possible.   I want to be oblivious to the complexities of life and be overly excited by the little things again.   I want to live simple again.   I don't want my day to consist of computer crashes, mountains of paperwork, depressing news, how to survive more days in the month than there is money in the bank, doctor bills, gossip, illness, and loss of loved ones.   I want to believe in the power of smiles, hugs, a kind word, truth, justice, peace, dreams, the  imagination, mankind, and making angels in the snow.   So . . . here's my checkbook and my car keys, my credit card bills and my 401K statements. I am officially resigning from adulthood.   And if you want to discuss this further, you'll have to catch me first, cause........   ....."Tag! You're it."

      The word nymphomania, historically known as uterine furor, comes from the Greek term nympho (feminine elegance, beauty, charm) and the obvious mania, meaning obsession or madness.  Women who are aroused easily, and have sex frequently were once called nymphomaniacs.  They were regarded as insatiable, on the prowl constantly for a sex partner.   Nymphomania is no longer a clinical term utilized by medical journals, the American Medical Association, or the American Psychological Association on a regular basis; in fact, nymphomania is not a clinical term at all, since every woman differs, every woman’s sex drive is different, and a very high sex drive is no longer cause for concern.  Today it is celebrated!  Although the antiquated term nymphomania has become something of a joke and disparaging to women, its use may echo more serious concerns than simply woman whose sex drive or sexual activity is subjectively deemed too high.  A scientific diagnosis of nymphomania is impossible, since it depends on the personal opinion of the physician.  Although it is conceivable that the term developed as slang for sexual addiction, this is doubtful, as the concept of the fun-loving nymphomaniac, like Melanie Griffith in Something Wild, or Rachel Romen in Shock Corridor, pours scorn on the horrifying symptoms of a profound disease with very well defined symptoms:   Frequently engaging in more sex and with more partners than intended.    Being preoccupied with or persistently craving sex, wanting to cut down and unsuccessfully attempting to limit sexual activity.    Thinking of sex to the detriment of other activities or continually engaging in excessive sexual practices despite a desire to stop .   Spending considerable time in activities related to sex, such as cruising for partners or spending hours online visiting pornographic Web sites.    Neglecting obligations such as work, school or family in pursuit of sex .   Continually engaging in the sexual behavior despite negative consequences, such as broken relationships or potential health risks .   Escalating scope or frequency of sexual activity to achieve the desired effect, such as more frequent visits to prostitutes or more sex partners.    Feeling irritable when unable to engage in the desired behavior.   The above list is at lifescape.com; you can learn more about sex addiction here at ImprovingSex.com.   A woman with this disorder pursues sex despite harmful effects on her life, not to enhance or to add intimacy to her life.  She craves sex not because of her high sex drive, not because she loves sex, but because of deep-rooted issues which drive her to harm herself physically and psychologically, much like any other addiction.  Sex can also serve as a substitute for missing social components or as a release for anger or fear.   Compulsive sexual behavior, or the inability to control ones urges, is a specific facet of sexual addiction that may also have been recognized as nymphomania a century or less ago.   According to the esteemed Mayo Clinic, sexual obsessions and compulsions are recurrent, distressing, and interfere with daily functioning.  It rarely gets better. Over time it gets more frequent, more extreme, or both.  In contrast, the Mayo Clinic assures us that it is common for healthy individuals to go through periods when sexual behavior may take on obsessive-compulsive characteristics, like adolescence or the early stages of a new relationship.   It is easy to see the difference between a so-called nymphomaniac and a sexual addict.  As the term stands today, some men find the idea of a woman with a greater sex drive than their own somewhat threatening, so they may use the label nymphomaniac to preserve their own egos, by dismissing a very sexual woman as abnormal.  Another possibility is that men are hopeful that they might find a nymphomaniac willing to do almost anything in the name of sexual gratification.  The old double-standard joke persists:  The term for a sex-obsessed woman is nymphomaniac.  The term for a sex-obsessed man is normal.  The term nymphomania is meaningless in today’s maelstrom of genuine sexual disorders.  Suffering from a sexual disorder, like addiction or compulsion, has nothing to do with libido or a desire for sex, just as an eating disorder or alcohol addiction is unrelated to hunger or a desire for booze.  Keeping your body safe and happy, and your mind healthy and free, should be your only guideline if asking yourself, am I having too much sex? Perhaps a better question would be, am I having all this sex for the right reasons?

      There is a new virus. The code name is "WORK".  If you receive WORK from your colleagues, your boss, via e-mail, or from anyone else, do not touch it under any circumstances. This virus wipes out your private life completely. If you should happen to come in contact with this virus, take two friends and go straight to the nearest bar. Order drinks immediately and after three rounds, you will find that WORK has been completely deleted from your system.  Forward this virus warning immediately to at least five friends. Should you realize you do not have five friends, this means you are already infected by this virus and WORK already controls your life. If this is the case, go to the bar and stay until you make at least five friends. Then retry.  I think I have five friends, but am not entirely positive so I'm headed for the bar anyway.....it never hurts to be safe.

      =) I didn't know it would be this different working outside. Outside where there is less familiarity. Where the organization is bigger. But better. The structure is non-hierarchical, but not chaotic.  Of course, there have been some sacrifices. Like convenience. Or incubus. And being broke for a month. But I know it will get better.  Just sharing ^_^  How about you, how are you?

      today is the election and i did'nt vote...as if it would matter because during the voting period this morning from 7 to 3 pm there were a lot of people (registered) that didnt had a chance to vote because they were not on the list of registered voters...funny thing is some of those who have voting for the longest time werent there also...now you see that the elections here is just full of crap minus 1 vote from me wouldnt realy matter at all....and thats the bottom line, because i said so!  and who the hell is wisely? what position is he running for? why they are asking to vote wisely?

      saya naman the original plan was really just to meet with old tropa...but then it was nice to see each other even the ones na hindi mo kilala para at least pag nasalubong ko sila sa SM mabati ko naman. darn it lang after pucha imagine grogy from the whole night of partying tapos linis kami lois the following day....langya kasi tong mga kasama na nag organize la wenta, dbale it was well worth the offort naman because it was a really appreciated attendance of people we really wanted to come. maulit lang sana pero hindi na sa bahay namin ok!

      Yesterday i just accepted a job wherein i was refered by my friends mom to tutor 2 cute little kids,&nbsp;daughters of Mr. Chuck Laurel.&nbsp; Now isn't it fun when you wake up early in the morning every single day of the week to go to work, not getting a chance to do things for yourself and not even seeing your girl when you want to. Well that's what's&nbsp; happenin with me right now...I go to work from mondays thru saturdays (that's including the masteral class i have on saturdays) then a tutoring on sundays. FUN! yeah?! for now it is, until the money comes in to my bank account I feel damn shitty most of the times. Maybe its the lack of sleep, is there a store thats sells sleep? tell me please! where?! until then im bustin' my ass everyday...
