      Today, while I was helping my brother remodel my basement, I stupidly put my thumb on the head of a drywall screw that was blisteringly hot.&nbsp; Now, I have a small doughnut shaped blister on the middle of my thumb.&nbsp; It's not burning now, but even with ice on it, it burned for about two hours.  Life is pure joy once we get used to being kicked in the ass every 15 minutes.

      I went to see the new Will Smith movie tonight: I, Robot.&nbsp; It was pretty good.&nbsp; Standard summer scifi fare, but well done.&nbsp; Good special effects, just enough explosions, and cliches out the wazoo.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What made the film especially good for me was while I was watching a solid guy film about things blowing up in the future, my wife was watching some weepy chick movie called "The Notebook".  Isaac Asimov created most of the elements (and the title of the film) but the movie was not based on the books.&nbsp; Asimov wrote over 450 books in his lifetime, too bad that Hollywood can't just make a movie out of one of them without just ripping him off.  Asimov's three laws of robotics are 1) Robots cannot do anything to hurt people.&nbsp; 2) Robots must follow the orders of humans except when it violates Rule&nbsp; #1.&nbsp; 3) Robots need to take care of themselves except when it violates rules #1 and #2.  Hollywood needs to follow the three rules of summer filmmaking:&nbsp; 1) All summer movies must feature stuff blowing up and the main character not getting hurt by it.&nbsp; 2) Nobody cries because their love life isn't working out or because some stuff blew up from rule #1.&nbsp; 3) Any emotional scene headed in the direction of rule #2 should be immediately interrupted with stuff blowing up.  Pretty simple rules, but of course, Hollywood can't follow them any better than bad robots can follow their own rules.&nbsp; (But, at least, the robots seem to know when to blow things up and they sure weren't going to cry about it afterwards).

      I get so tired of listening to idiots on the radio spouting nonsense about how marriage somehow needs to be "protected" from gays and lesbians.&nbsp; Exactly how does allowing gays to marry endanger heterosexual unions?&nbsp; Allowing gays to marry would not prevent any heterosexuals to get married.&nbsp; Considering that almost half of all marriages now end in divorce, I say let's give anyone who wants a chance at commiting a lifetime of honor and fidelity to another the opportunity to do so.&nbsp; How come the current administration is more interested in promoting hate and fear&nbsp;than in promoting love and undestanding?&nbsp; How does anyone loving someone else take anything away from the rest of us?&nbsp;  &nbsp; I can tell you lots of ways that hating others is scary and futile; could someone tell me how making commitments to love can be a bad thing?

      I finally squeezed out a few minutes from studying French this summer to see M. Moore's new movie.  It was an amazing film.  I would defy anyone to actually go see this movie and still feel the same about our government.  The Republicans tried to get Clinton kicked out of office for having sex in the Oval Office.  Now, it's time the Democrats kick Bush out of office for screwing the whole nation.

      Driving home to day, my road was blocked by a construction crew who did not bother to put up any signs such as "Men working"  "Prepare to stop" or even "Your luck is going to suck."  Who were these people? Just because they have bigger toys doesn't mean they own the playground.

      I don't know what's worse: the retailers putting Christmas displays up in October or the retailers putting up "Back to School" displays in the first week of July.

      First off: John Kerry made a mistake in his choice for Vice President.  He's got the wrong John Edwards - how cool would it have been if he had asked the one who speaks to dead people to run as vice president instead of the one who is married to the ketchup queen?  Second: Mary-Kate isn't really anorexic; it's just that Ashley keeps finishing her samitches.  Third: I'd like to see a reality tv show where all the people who are loudly protesting Michael Moore's "Fahrenheit 9/11" (but who haven't actually seen the movie) are put on a remote island with all the people who are loudly praising the film (but who also haven't actually seen the movie).  Then, there's some sort of competition for sharp sticks, but at the end of the competition, all these people are just left on the island anyway.

      It's a Sunday morning, and although I have a lot of other stuff that needs to be done, I'm trying out Google's blog maker.
