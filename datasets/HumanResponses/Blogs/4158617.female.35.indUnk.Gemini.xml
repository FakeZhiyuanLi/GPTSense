       I am stressed out!! Worried about a math test that I have to take on Monday, August 23rd. I know I passed the one last semester, but honestly I believe it was all fluke! I know one gets three chances to pass it with an 85%, but I am still nervous. I want to go in and kick butt and be done with it.       Then I just plain out scared to death about this upcoming two semesters. Two classes, two clinical days..blah!! I am already tired and classes don't start till the 30th.       oh well..STRESSED is just DESSERTS spelled backwards. So, a big ole' hot fudge sundae sounds good.      Peace all      Dina

      Okay, so I said I was going to write down my thoughts, but I have decided to just let it go. *uhmmmmmmmm* OOH!, what Zen feeling.  I am on my way, shortly, to pay the first installment of this years tuition for my children. It's crazy. I will be paying damn near as much for tutition a month as I do for rent. And I don't really care for this school. So, that, in itself, makes the experience extremely painful. But, for right now it's convenient. Just a couple of blocks north.  I shall have to endure the pain for at least one more year, then we can check into St. Daniel's.  Which is the grammar school Nick attended.   And I really like that, but they did not have a full-time preschool.  St. Rene does.  Answers the question of what I am suppose to do with the kids while in school and at clinicals.   Luckily, I have the world's greatest mother in law, if it wasn't for I wouldn't have made it this far.  She watches my kids, makes sure they get to school and never complains about it.  I think she really, really wants me to suceed and I appreciate all that she has done to allow me the opportunity.  Okie, off to the school.  WISH ME LUCK.  They always seem to have something that you need to buy and forgot to mention at the end of the school year.  YEAH!, like I need another friggin' bill this month.  August is our UGLY month.  But, we will survive, with minimal scaring to show for it all...:P  May the blue bird of happiness visit you today!  Dina

      Does anyone know anything about this subject?? Can you iron Velveteen?? For the love of god, someone please let me know! *snicker*  I will post later today. Need to get my thoughts in order and I have been harping on a particular subject for a half an hour. It needs a break. But, I am positive that it will rear it's ugly head again and then you all will get an ear full. So, all I have to say is..BEWARE, the butterfly wrath is coming...to local theatres near you. HA!, now that would be cool. I could be a one woman show. BRING IT BABEE!

      YeeHAW!, on saturday morning at the bright and earlier time of 8am, my big toe toenail was removed for .....FOREVER! I am still dealing with my freakiness...:P Actually, it went better then I thought. Well, that could be the Darvocet talking...*la la la* Will see if still holds true next week.  Now, I am trying to figure out what I can wear to a wedding reception we have to attend on Sunday. Barefeet are in season....right?? My hubby says tennis shoes, but the thought of anything putting any pressure on my toe makes me cringe...*CRINGE* See ya told ya. So, I guess I will have to weed through my shoe closet and see what I can wear and then pick my outfit from there. *go me*  I am thinking about posting the pic of my toe. It looks really, really....uhm, RAW!  *snicker* I will decided tomorrow if I will be doing that or not.  Peace my brothers and chickadees!

      The hubby and I went to his sister's graduation party.  I had a nice time.  But, it appears my boobs have become quite a topic of discussion..*boggle*  It's like they have taken on their own identity!  I truly believe the girls in the Fam are jealous.  So, me and "the girls" would like to say this to them..."nah-nah-nah"  Yes, I do indeed have a sensitive bone in my body....:P  Really, I do care about their handicaps...NOT!!!

      Frankie, showed me the way to this new little toy.  *hugs Frank*  I hope to be entertaining, that's about all I can promise.   Right now,  I am sitting and debating the very complex world of wardrobe.  It's either striped capris or the army green ones.  Decisions, decisions!!!  Why must life be so hard?!?!  Oh and..I WANT SLIDERS!!!  *enough said on that subject*
