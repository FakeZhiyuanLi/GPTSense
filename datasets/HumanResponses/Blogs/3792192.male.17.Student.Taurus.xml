      Well...several things went well today! I got up at about midday since I had no college today, so I slept in. There was a letter one the table delivered by courier mail with my name on it...turned out to be my passport! Nothing is stopping me from going onto the Excelsior now! Gonna be a great week.  Went out and bought myself a headset for voice communication...no I want to find some voice recognition software to play around with..lol. I also got a cashbox while I was there..sicne the plastic thing I have for documents and money isn't very secure, metal cashboxes much better.  Spend ages looking around all the computer shops, electronics stores, and office places looking for this stuff...nothing anywhere! After searching for almost an hour I gave up and went to Argos, and got some good ones from there. So now I am wearing the headset and getting used to it, although it took me some time to find the microphone plug in the back of the computer, seeing as I can't see round the back and theres a massive web of cables there. Always the simple things that turn out hard.   Had a look in the computer game shops while I was in the city centre, Thief: Deadly Shadows is for sale in some for about Â£30, but I already got that, the one I am looking for is Thief Gold, which is the only Thief I havn't got yet. I am determined to find it though...lol...I been searching for Carnivores as well, but since thats not sold here in the UK, I have given up hopes of buying it anywhere apart from the internet.  Well, thats life I guess..no point complaining about it, some friends of mine are getting it for me.  Now I sit here typing, and plan on going out soon again, get some information and contacts for the Excelsior trip since I now have to give them my passport number, I couldn't put that on the form when I sent that to them since I didn't have the passport then. Apparently I may be able to reclaim the passport fee from the City Youth Service...so thats more good news.  Apart from that, not much else has happened. I successfully completed Lands Of Lore 3 again, this time deliberately making it harder for myself as I always do when I have completed a game.  Once I get back later, I may have more to add here. But for now, nothing more to report.

      Well...I have decided I give up with AOL journals and start a blog here instead, supposed to be easier...(anythings easier than AOL...well...except Microsoft Windows anyway..)  I am Scaleskin, an English college student studying in southampton, hopeing to gain some good grades in both Chemistry and Computing. I also have projects outside of College...a website simply to learn a few things about webpage development, and Art...since the start of this year I have been drawing, mainly dragons, but a few anthropomorphics as well. I have interests in fantasy artwork, science and computers, and spend probably a bit too much time on the internet at times.   Anyway...onto recent events.   I have been feeling good recently, the exams are over and I only screwed up the physics exams...whoever decided all three physics exams shoudl be in the same afternoon should be eaten by hideous creatures. I am now beginning A2 courses in Chemistry and Computing...chemistry is quite interesting as this project involves an analysis on White Wine Vinegar...titrations, steam distillations etc. I should be recieving my passport in the next couple of days, my Birth certificate has ben returned now so I can expect it very soon. Nothing is gonna stand in my way of getting on board the Excelsior in july, 22nd of july to the 1st of August out in the ocean away from civilisation, finally something I can enjoy...working aboard a tall ship for a week. I am working on my art, and need to get the watercolours out to work on my hybrid picture....and then begin the next drawing...I love drawing!  I now have a profile working with a pic...after a few problems with my AOL webspace (AOL AGAIN!! lol) Thats all I can think of saying at this moment though, hopefully I will post here more often than I did on AOL.

      Here I am in Aalborg, Denmark, in the crew centre. The race is over, but we still have parties and stuff to go to before our flight tomorrow night. I did remember to keep a journal of the events while being aboard the Excelsior, so I am gonna try to type up as much of it as I can. So, here it is.  22nd July 2004. Time: 21:28  It's been a rather long and interesting day. The taxi arrived on time and I was at Southampton Central early, so no problems. The ride from there to the airport took a few uneventful hours. A few problems in a crowded airport followed, nothing serious, it was dealt with without too much stress.  First time flying, that was interesting. Within a few seconds of takeoff I was looking down through the window at the coutnryside, the flight didn't take long though, but it is interesting to feel the effects of turning and the landing. Once we arrived at the excelsior I was able to see it properly for the first time. There is a nice amount of deck space, at the stern a place where I now sit writing this entry. After exploring, and decideding on sleeping arrangements we had a crew parade. Walking through the city holding a large flag and Excelsior banner, with teams from other ships as well. It was a fun parade, but with the heat and sunlight I was glad whe I could hand the flag to another crewmember and get a drink. I have just got back from a crew party over at the hangerm strange, it was much more comfortable outside, the heat and noise inside is not my preference, then again, the food was nice, but in the end I decided to return to the Excelsior to take advantage of the quiet here. I just can hardly wait until we actually get sailing on saturday!  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  I'll post a bit more some other time.

      Right, this is it. Only about 6 1/2 hours to go until I have to be at the central station meeting point to go to the Excelsior. I have packed everything and am ready to go, taxi booked, everything packed into one very large rucksack...and sorted out an old notebook to use as a journal so I can type up the whole thing when I get back.  Apart from that, everything is going well...I need to switch round the drive letters for the CD-ROM drives, one of them is a virtual drive which makes it harder, I need the virtual drive as D so both Lands Of Lore and Earthseige 2 will read the virtual CDs in it, otherwise when I play Earthseige 2 I am distracted (and so is everyone else) by the very loud buzzing/sawing sound of an old CD in a new fast drive.   But, that can wait until I get back...as can anything else, I intend to enjoy working on the Excelsior for the next week.

      Well...since I have finished college, I have spent more time playing around with prgrams...Discworld Noir is now completed...such a random game. Asking Gargoyles some wierd questions, kissing a werewolf, being murdered, discovering I am a werewolf and am not dead...and then having to save the city from some hideous evil....crazy. &nbsp; I had the sudden idea to play the original Lands Of Lore...was wanting to try it and see if it would run on windows XP...wasn't easy..several sites said it is simple and runs without problems...Why is it always me who finds problems? After messing around with memory, compatability settings and DOS emulators I ended up giving up.. &nbsp; Got back to it later on...and played around with the memory settings, eventually I got it working by increasing the XMS memory....darn thing...well...I guess at least it works now, and runs quite well. Now gotta get the Virtual CD drive and the actual CD drive swapped round so it will detect the virtual drive with the CD image of lands of lore so I don't need the CD in...hehe... &nbsp; In other news...I didn't win the Halfquake contest I had entered, but apparently I get a Halfquake Fan CD anyway...and a small surprise...I cant wait..lol Also...preparing for the Excelsior is interesting...need to get myself some soft-woled shoes or plimsols or somethign to wear on deck....can't be wearing my boots on there. Need to go and grab some cheap ones...since i won't be wearing them often after the trip. Also need to get a few more items for the trip as well...at least I don't have to worry too much about camera now...I'll be using a different camera with a 64MB card in it.

      Well, my last lessons for this year were today...I got some computing  stuff handed in, and spend the afternoon doing chromatography and  titrations....interesting I guess, although now there's blue spots on  my hand where some of the solvent came into contact with my skin...but  that should fade over the next few days....chemicalks..lol   I  sent off the arrangements for pickups and stuff for the 22nd of july  and the 1st of august...next thursday I am off....although i guess I  need to go and buy a memory card for my camera, otherwise I will only  have about 15 images....not good.   Completed quake...GLQuake  really does improve the graphics of quake...nice 3-D acceleration,  quake looks so much better with it, particularly the blood and  explosions. Nothing like a good shooting spree on violent  games...alongside my Huntign on Carnivores...managed to bag T-Rex with  the Shotgun, X-Bow And the sniper rifle (i really hate the  rifle...makes things way too easy)   And...Discworld...I love playing Discworld, and managed to get Discworld Noir working...bit of a laugh..hehe  And  of course, I want to get Myst to work on windows XP...I havn't seen if  it will run, and I am hopeing I won't have to find any patches in order  to play it.   Well...next week, I leave...I intend to sort out a  notebook or something to keep a journal which i can post here. As for  now, well...Nothing more...yet.

      Once again, last few days, not much happening, except for a visit yesterday from some people from the gerbilshows...(in other words, getting rid of a few of our gerbils at last) and last nights midnight search for the keys to the snake's vivarium.  Oh, well..there was something I got yesterday...looking through the shops I got myself a candleholder for those little tealight candles...found a really nice gothic dragon one, the dragon is curled up around the place where the candle goes, and when its in the dark and burning it looks brilliant. Looks like I may go into the shop again, there are some nice swords, bat-leths, knives, dragons and all sorts in there...  I have Quake working, played it, located the difficulty setting that is "so bad it is hidden" and playing it....I had almost forgotten the way Quake makes you jump when one second you're on full health and armour, next you die having been torn to shreds by some creature with claws for arms...great game...just got to get the GLquake working so I can use the videocards 3D acceleration in quake.  Also have Outlaws working, I love the Outlaws game!  College is going okay as well...steam distillation went well, and while that was going I was able to do a few titrations at the same time.  One last thing, I have got Carnivores at last!! Finally I can go for prehistoric hunting! So far I got a few allosaurs in my trophy room, best shot so far was at 38 metres with the crossbow!  Anyway, thats all for now...Happy Hunting.

      Okay, well....its sunday night, not much happening apart from the occassional chasing gerbils round the flat...crazy...little hyperactive rodents.  Noticed earlier why there has been a lot of wasps around, we located the nest, in the abestos things on the ceiling of the balcony next door. I personally don't mind them, in fact I happen to like wasps, but others don't, and for good reasons, on person living in the area is allergic to wasps, and a lot of small kids play out there on the balcony, hopefully, the people next door will call pest control about that.  We came across a lead model of a dragon the other day when looking for something, it was broken into three pieces, I had them sitting on my shelf yesterday, and decided today I would try and put them together...damn, Epoxy Resin didn't work on the blasted thing! The rear part of the dragon (hindlegs and tail) won't attach to the wings and front, as the pieces are too heavy for epoxy resin to work. Given up on that for now...  I got a few projects to complete...still got to call up the St. Thomas centre and arrange transport to the Excelsior on the 22nd of July...and to give them my passport number to put on my application...couldn't put it on myself when i sent it as I hadn't even got the forms sorted then!  I am making progress on learning to use Photoshop, in attempting to make light rays, I have detrmined I am okay as long as I select where I don't want the rays to be...lol...just my luck, things always harder than they seem. Must be me...  I got Outlaws working on the computer...thats the easy one, now to get Quake working, it doesn't seem to want to work, either with DOS emulators or Windows XP...games...I really hate them (not really!)

      Well, tomorrow morning I leave to go camping with the church youth group at an event called Soul Survivor. Hoping its gonna be as fun as the Excelsior...well, almost. I get back on Saturday, and will again be keeping a journal while I am away to type up when I return.  Anyway...on to life. I saw a text on a notice board, and read it. It really meant something to me, considering it is something I have believed in all my life so far, about freedom. "To laugh is to risk appearing the fool, To Weep is to risk being called sentimental. To reach out to another is to risk involvement. To expose feelings is to risk showing your true self. To place your ideas and your dreams before a crowd is to risk being called naive. To live is to risk dying. To hope is to risk despair, and to try is to risk failure. But risks must be taken because the greatest risk in life is to risk nothing. The person who risks nothing, does nothing, has nothing, is nothing, and becomes nothing. He may avoid suffering and sorrow, but he simply cannot learn and feel and change and grow and love and live. Chained by things that are certain, he is a slave. He has forfeited his freedom."  Thinking about it made me wonder, if I had lived life and taken a few more risks, where would I be now? Would I really be the same person that I am at present? I have decided maybe I should continue to improve who I am, work on communication. If I take the risks of actually talking to people I may get better at talking to people.  Anyway...thats all I can say at the moment. Happy Hunting.

      I have successfully sorted through the photos I took whilst on board the Excelsior and selected the 20 best, and created a photobucket album to store them in...gonna try and post them into my blog somehow..

      another goal achieved. During this week I have been helping with a church outreach project in the local area, The Big Event. I have been helping out during the kids club in the mornings. We got plenty of kids joining in during the week and the whole thing, including the barbeque tonight has been a great success, and there is another barbeque tomorrow night. It has been quite fun and a big success.  I have managed eventually to regain my land legs after last week, not easy trying to walk properly when suffering from lack of sleep and land sickness...lol  It is harder to get online at the moment, since we hav left AOL completely now...we have two Broadband Force9 accounts, and are hopefully getting a router so I can access the internet again through the other computer (or from laptop)  Apart from that, not much has been going on. I been playing Thief again, and a few retro games in my spare time, and am planning on designing a new forum signature for use in many forums...and also planning on drawing Cerberus.  Anyway, thats all for now. Happy Hunting.

      Right, I now have the full journal that I kept while on board the Excelsior and am posting it below.  Excelsior - Scaleskin - 2004  22nd July: 2128  It's been a rather long and interesting day. The taxi arrived on time and I was at Southampton Central early, so no problems there. The ride from there to the airport took a few uneventful hours. A few problems in a crowded airport followed, nothing serious, it was dealt with without too much stress. First time flying, well, that was interesting. Within a few seconds of take-off I found myself looking out of the window at miles of countryside. The flight didn't take long though, but it was interesting to feel the forces of the aircraft as it turned and landed. Once we arrived at the Excelsior I was able to see it properly for the first time. There is a nice amount of deck space, and at the stern is a place where I now sit writing this entry.After exploring and deciding on bunks, we had another event, the Crew Parade in Antwerp. Walking through the city holding alarge flag and Excelsior banner, with the crews of other ships as well. It was a rather fun parade, but with the intense heat and sunlight I was glad to finally hand the flag to someone else and get a drink.I have just got back from a crew party over in the hanger, strange, it was much more comfortable outside, the heat and noise inside is not my preference for environment, then again, the food was nice. In the end I decided to return to the Excelsior to take advantage of the peace here.\I can hardly wait until we set sail on Saturday.  -2307 Heh, an interesting end to an interesting day. I stopped reading on deck and moved down to the galley when the others got back from the crew party. We soon realised there was a storm outside and went back up on deck to observe, but had to come back down soon as the steps down to the galley were bad enough without the water. I am now lying in my bunk writing this.  23rd July: 0914  Talk about rough night, the rain meant that we had to shut the hatch, and as a result it became very hot down here, and sleeping in the bunks was harder. The others have just gone for showers, but I can't stand the idea of waiting in those queues for ages.  -1745 Back from a bit of shopping, got some fudge and waffles for the next week, adn right now tea is cooking. It's been rather fun really. I climbed the rigging to take a few photos of the deck, and the good view from near the top of the mast.From one height to another, we went on the ferris wheel of a nearby fair and got a very good view of the larger ships in the race.Spent a while searching for an ATM so we could get some euros out to spend while here and in Denmark, and got back in time for hoistung and lowering the sails, something that will be important tomorrow when we set sail. That was quite interesting, the sails are quite heavy and it is not easy to keep a firm hold on the ropes.Three of us went out to buy some food, and saw a few interesting sights - the cathedral, a fountain which was a relief considering the heat, even though it had started to cool down, And the ship we may go to tonight, the Diamond Princess.  -2136 The party on board the Diamond Princess has now been skipped. There is a party on board the boat next to ours, the Esprit. People have been crossing over the Excelsior to get to it. Crowded boat with beer and stuff, quite nice beer as well. I am trying to avoid drinking too much, only 2 so far. Might go back over there and get another in a few minutes if I can be bothered.Or maybe not, heh, I have just been handed a vodka and coke, and it tastes real nice. Well, heres to a good voyage.  -2240 Right, enough booze! After rejoining the party on the Esprit, I have drunk enough. One more beer or vodka and I probably wouldn't be able to write this. We set sail tomorrow, the sooner the better. Just been another interesting event. Fireworks and lasers. I always liked the effect of laser on smoke. Then again, I guess I'll be glad to set sail and leave. The regular sounding of the foghorns of all the ships could get very annoyed after a while.It's a nice night, quite a comfortable temperature, and will get very quiet once all the parties are over. When I think of it I wonder, am I writing this as a journal entry or in case I can't remember it in the morning?Either way, it's a nice night, clear skies (I wish I could say clear horizons, but we are still in port.) I little stargazing can't hurt.  24th July: 0903  The boats have started leaving, only a matter of time before we head down the river. I am sat here up the mast with a good view of everything whilst writing this. The Excelsior has been cleaned, decks scrubbed, and the Esprit is still being cleaned after the party last night! (Which I can still remember most of).Warm waffles and a cup of tea for breakfast, a perfect start to the day.The Ascard II is just leaving, we have to wait for the Ocean Scout, the Offshore Scout and the Esprit to leave before we can move, then again, I like it up here and once we set sail I can't come up here to write, but on the up side, we won't have people staring at us when at sea. And off goes the Ocean Scout, followed by the Offshore Scout.I think I prefer the Excelsior to these other ships, they were built in the 1990s while the Excelsior is more traditional from 1921.  -1426 I finally left my position up the rigging as the Esprit set sail. We followed up the river on engine power. Water fights between ships are quite funny to watch, Water bombs thrown at us fromthe Sparta,while Nick fired back with the firehose.Well, we have apparentlyleft Belgium and entered the Netherlands. Sails are up and the Excelsior is moving.I have been assigned to a good shift, 0000-0400 and 1200-1600. I guess a semi-nocturnal shift is good, just got to think when I am going to sleep. Not so hot anymore now we are actually moving.  -2136 We are at anchor. I count it as eight times I have hit my head on a door, hatch or the boom. It is much more peaceful here than in dock as we can sit on deck without people staring at us on the ship.One thing I will not forget is to know when to duck if the sails are up, the boom tends to swing quite suddenly.I did a few practise sketches before tea, tea was good, nothing like Stirfry...Anyway, seems our watch has been cancelled tonight. Catch a few ours of sleep before we bring the sails back up.  26th July: 1621  Okay, so I didn't write anything yesterday, I was seasick. Not easy to write when you keep leaning over the sides.Feels awful, dizziness, headaches, and it was worse when below deck, so I spent all day and most of the night up on deck in a sort of semi-concious state since it was too cold to actually sleep.At least today it's not so bad. I am getting used to this motion.Anyway, I don't want to think about yesterday. Today is brilliant. It's a nice temperature, cooled by the breeze, and rather confortable. I can see ships on the horizon, but less often than yesterday. Earlier positions in the race, Excelsior was apparently in 5th place in class, 12th place overall.  28th July: 1403  This mornings watch was amazing. The sky was clear and the stars looked amazing, and the way they reflected on the water. That, a few shooting stars, and the Moonset were inspirational. You could never see anything like that from the city, something you have to come out to see. Even the best artwork could not recall the brilliance of nature. I took photos, but even if they do ome out okay I am in the opinion that they will not show it as well.On a less optimistic note, for the past few days there has been a severe lack of wind, progress is very slow. When we heard that the race could be cut short we discussed the situation. Most of the larger ships may have already dropped out, and now we have retired as well. As I write this, the engines are running. We are going to stop somewhere to resupply and refuel before heading to the  destination port in Aalborg.It seems a shame to have done so well, yet be stopped by the lack of wind, but in order to make it to Denmark in time, it just isn't possible to continue. It has been a great experience no matter how it turns out.I got a chance to control the rudder earlier, makes a change from the computer controls which react to your input without resistance, the boat fights to go its own way and I had to fight with it to remain in control.I'll be glad to get into port though, not that I am not enjoying this, but it has been nearly a week since I last had a shower, use the internet, and various other things.  29th July: 1311  Damn that feels better. We stopped to refuel and were able to get showers. Feels great to actually be clean again for the first time this week. Got to get used to land again, after all this time getting used to the swaying motion of the boat at sea, walking on land makes me feel like I did after the party on the Esprit, swaying when trying to stand still.This mornings watch, now known as the "Graveyard Shift", this time there was high cloud cover so the stars were blocked out. Instead the sea looked interesting, at every movement it glowed and so it was flashing all the way to the horizon.I have no idea if we will sail for a bit then anchor for the night, or simply sail straight to Aalborg. To be quite honest, I don't care. I look forward to our arrival, though we havn't planned a great entry, hopefully not like our departure from Antwerp when a flare was set off and we left a trail of orange smoke.  30th July: 1012  We anchored for the night, so the graveyard shift was cancelled. I went up on deck to look at the stars once again, but quickly became more interested in the full moon, glowing red over the hills on the horizon.It gets rather annoying at times when we end up waiting for a bridge to open so the Excelsior could pass through and continue up the river, but in the end it does save us a bit of time and the river is much calmer than the sea.We should be arriving very soon, a couple of hours if all goes well.The motor boat has been lifted off the deck and is in the water trailing behind us. Also behind us appears to be two other tall ships, but I can't make out the names from this distance.We have cleaned up the interior of the ship, well, sortof, the bunks remain messy but are hidden by the curtains. I ended up polishing the brass clock and the plaque beside it, both of which obviously had not been cleaned for ages.It seems when I think of it, although I miss my computer games, my friends on the internet (particularly those in Halfquake, Misocathlush and NeonDragonArt) I really have enjoyed this whole experience, with the exception of the seasickness. It has been an amazing week which I may never get the opportunity to do again.I have bought some Excelsior merchandise to preserve this memory, but really I think I could never forget it. Anyway, I will be glad to get my feet back on land, maybe find a cybercafe and begin typing this, or, more likely, join in the partying after the race.  1400 We are in Aalborg. There was a bit of confusion as to where the Excelsior was to tie up as the locations had changed.The others have gone to buy supplies. I returned to the Excelsior and searched through the list of activities. There is a party tonight and I think I am going to go for a sightseeing tour tomorrow, see some of the culture of Aalborg.I have the location of the crew centre on the map so I can go and access the internet and type up some of this stuff, check emails, forums..etc.Strange, it seems odd to be away from the internet for so long and really enjoy the sailing.Tomorrow is out last day here, our flight is early on Sunday morning. I am determined to get a look around in the time left.  31st July: 1156  Just went out on a sightseeing tour of Aalborg. The place that interested me the most was the Viking Burial ground. It seemed as if the people running the tour were not interested at all in any of it. I had a good look around the burial grounds and in the museum, quite interested, but we had quite limited time.The crew parade is this afternoon, maybe I'll carry the flag again. Should be fun, well, except for the fact that it is burning hot again just like it was back in Belgium.I have packed my stuff already, no point leaving it in the mess it was in, Tonight we leave the Excelsior and take the flight back to Heathrow. Although I will be glad to get back to Southampton, I have had such a good time sailing.  2015 At the last party I will be going to for this event. Tonight at midnight we leave for the Airport to go back sometime tomorrow morning. I am enjoying the crew party again, the food is not as good this time, but it is okay. The music and dancing makes up for it. May join in the dancing soon, make the most of it while you still can as they say.I didn't do much this afternoon besides the crew parade, which was as much fun, if not more, than the one back in Antwerp. The only people who did not go crazy were a few russian sailors, and the band. The rest of us, well, to list a few, pots and pans, pirate outfits and crazy dances, and even someone with an inflatable orca on his back. The prize-giving ceremony didn't take long. Once back aboard the Excelsior we made sure everything was packed and we were ready toleave quickly tonight.I spent about an hour before the parade up the mast again. I think that particular place instantly became my favourite place on the Excelsior. Up there, while I sit perched on the beam aboethe lights and foghorn I am able to feel every movement of the ship, as well as having a great view of everything. It is quite relaxing to take a book up there, or just to sit and relax.Anyway, this will be my final entry to this journal of the Tall ships experience, so I will just say all I can think of before I forget.Overall I can think of countless experiences I have had along the way. Not only has it been my first time on a tall ship, but I have met people from many other countries, mainly due to the parties, I have spent hours at night just staring at the stars, seeing both Shooting Stars, and the rare Moonset.I have also become quite good at climbing the rigging fast to get to my favourite spot so much (heh). This is the closest I have ever come to being totally isolated from civilisation, and so I have really enjoyed it. It will stand out in my memory as a unique, and one of the best, events of my life so far. If I ever got the chance to board the Excelsior again, I would jump at it. Just to get hold of the tiller and steer the ship out at sea, or to climb back up that mast. It really has been such a great experience, and although there are some amazing ships here, I will never forget the Excelsior. The only negative things I can think of are: (1) Being away from my friends on the internet,and (2) The fact that I was seasick on the first day at sea.As far as internet goes, I have had so much else happening that I didn'tmind the time away that much (no offense to anyone), and although the seasickness was annoying I found it not too hard to adapt and get used to the motion. Besides, it was hard to walk on land afterwards. Some of the Best Things about the Experience:-The night sky at sea: I have never been ableto gaze upon the stars so well, or see a glowing red full moon, and neither of them I could ever see from Southampton, or maybe even the land at all.-Steering the Excelsior: So much better than any computer game controller. The forcesofthe ocean make it all that harder to maintain a steady course, and the tiller resists each and every movement.-Exploring: During this race I have explored both Antwerp (Belgium) and Aalborg (Denmark), and sailed through the Netherlands. Also, the parties have been great, the parades crazy, random and a lot of fun, and thanks to the ships cook, Kirsty, we have been eating great food as well. Although chances areI will never meet most of the people whom I have met here, and I may never see the Excelsior again, let alone set sail on her again as part of the crew, I will never forget the past nine days, it just is not possible to forget such an event in my life.  1st August: 0008  Okay, got caught up in the party while I was writing. I shall end the previous entry with a quick statement. I just took my last look at the Excelsior and the crew, images that will stay in my mind always, the Excelsior, her crew, and the race. I will type this into my blog over the next week.Someof the things I have seen on this journey are so rare that I could never have believed they could exist in the natural world. If the photos come out okay I will post them on a website for you to see, but some things you would have to see to believe it, besides, the camera is not very good for the darker photos. It has been a wonderfully inspiring experience.
