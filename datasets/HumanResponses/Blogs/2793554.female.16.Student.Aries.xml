      mood: procrastinatory? is that a word? music :dramarama - anything,anything (ill give you)   *Ill give you candy, give you diamonds, give you pills Ill give you anything you want, hundred dollar bills... ill even let you watch the shows you wanna see just marry me marry me marry me!*  ...yep....I'm definetely supposed to be studying but instead im just sitting at my computer, doing nothing. I swear, if i dont fail science Ill be surprised. I just hope my parents dont find out or ask....cause ill be in DEEEEP shit. And nobody likes standing in a pile of shit.  I had the coolest dream last night... i read smack before i went to bed and so i had this awesome dream. I was in some sort of house, and i was doing a bunch of heroin and dylan was there, and just... everything was so intensely awesome. And then i woke up and the arm that i had been doing the heroin in was completely numb (and i wasnt laying on it or anything) and it was cool.  Huh. According to thespark.com, I'm pregnant. And my baby will have a birth defect because it will have a dime sticking out of the side of its head. How cute. Especially since babies are UUUUUGLY. And fat. And stupid. Stupid babies.  GAH! school is stupid. EVERYTHING IS STUPID.  *All i want for christmas is my two front teeth. And some mistletoe all up in this piece, maybe a girl... one thats free of disease, and while im thinkin... throw in a couple of g's.... we smell like evergreens* IF YOU DONT LISTEN TO MC CHRIS, YOU DAMN WELL SHOULD. Or.. uh... something really horribly bad will happen to you. Ten year olds will come running after you with a chainsaw and a bottle of Robotussin.  Ka-ZAM!

      Mood: discombobulated. FUCK YOU, i know i cant spell.  Music: Futurama is playing in the background.   I.... am really.... ...confused.  My brain wants to explode. Its really wierd. I had a wierd wierd day. Bought a bunch of new clothes. (yaaay! I dont look like im homeless any more!!!) wheee! and its snowing outside. Snow makes me happy. Like rain. I wish that every time i cried it would rain... ::im only happy when it rains:: garbage is pretty.  My dad came and yelled at me today, cause apparently i didnt go to class. Then he decided it was my moms fault for letting the dog out ( i had to chase it cause it sucks) and then i was a 1/2 hour late, so i didnt go. So my dad was yelling at her, then he was yelling at me, then he was yelling at the dog... he's insane. he loves yelling at everything.   i hate to say it, but freaky friday was a damn good movie. So much like my life.  (except i dont eat fortune cookies and morph into 50 year old women. Although if i did, i would find something exciting that only really old women can do. Like drink a lot and then go shop at Ross. Or drink corn on the cob through a straw. ewww....)  im too lazy to look for more links, but i wanted to paste this one cause OH GOD! its a new and hilarious webcomic. GO THERE. LAUGH. PISS YOURSELF. DONT TELL ME ABOUT IT. http://www.moviepunks.com/?id=1  I smell. Im going to shower.

      feeling: slightly insane, but also insanely happy music :mc chris, bizznatch!  My life is beautiful. I went to New Vista today to talk to the counselor about going there. She thought i was doing drugs, cause i am unhappy and have new friends or something... and my  mom started crying cause she thinks me going to vista is like "running away" or something like that. Oh well. Let someone else psycho-ananalyze her lest my brain explodes.  But anyway, everything is beautiful!!!!!! And i have a gigantic bag of candy, and tomorrows weds and i love dylan and kelly is beautiful and alice is beautiful and my kitty is beautiful and everything rocks.  I gave you stolen flowers, you gave me your last cigarette You'll be in my dreams today Ill run my yellow finger through your yellow hair my yellow teeth will pull off your underwear those shredded fishnet stockings make me remember the way we fucked and youll be in my dreams today...yes youll be in my dreams today..  Im playing with play-doh. play doh is fun. Im letting my inner child run free. And probably naked, cause little kids seem to run around naked a lot....  go take a hike! AND DONT FORGET THE TRAIL MIX, BITCH!  ~abby~

      Wow. Really wierd day. Went to school, got accepted into New Vista (oh YES! finally getting the fuck out of that hellhole/jail/site of small animal sacrifice/whatever!!!) Went home, my dad was trying to talk to me about some TV show he had seen that had to do with Star Trek and show me a new expensive toy he got added to his already yuppie Toureg. And then we had a huge conversation about kids at school, mainly cause I got in the car reeking of cigarettes and he wanted to know why...and he said he was proud of me. It was the wierdest thing ever, cause my dad is all "oh, thats great BUT..." and today he told me I was a really good kid and that he was proud of me. And i didnt even do anything. And he got all emotional about it... fuck... i thought he was going to cry which would have been horrific cause all i couldve done was sit there while a balding, yuppie, 55 year old man cryed like a kid who's just had their candy taken away and been smacked.  And then i went to hang out with crazy lesbians, and they were all over each other, watching anime. I never really thought about how much i dislike anime. Not like hellsing and shit... that is gooooood. But stupid anime. With high pitched voices and perky boobs its like a japanese playboy convention on acid. Found out my exgirlfriend likes me.  Again.  I miss Dylan. Why cant i be with him every single second of the day?  *All around me are familiar faces, worn out places, worn out faces... bright and early for the daily races... going nowhere, going nowhere.....*  I hate today. I want to stab it in the eye with a sword and watch the blood spurt out all over its stupid self.

I fucking hate geeks.  this girl chris from oasos asked for my number today.  i dont even know what to do. i dont really like her...  but i gave her my number anyway. why do i do that?   i really want to hang out with melissa. where is she? she makes me all happy and crazy. and shes just fun.  my tummy hurts, and i hate everyone.  hate hate hate.  ::stab::  i hate you.  i had to babysit today and now my back hurts. my cousins are cute. theyre 6 and 3... i used to think they suck but sometimes theyre really fun. they had an argument today about whether i was pretty or cool... lol. made me wish i was 6 again. and we went to noodles and then the 3 year old (marissa) almost peed on me... gross. but we played that horsie game where the little kids ride on your back and now my back and arm hurts.  i want some ice cream. or maybe a lobotomy.  meow.  ~abby

      mood: tired, sore music: scream- misfits  i had a cool weekend. I went to dylans house, which is always fun :) we slept so much... we literally woke up, went back to sleep, and woke up at like 4. but thats okay.... as boring as it sounds i had fun sleeping next to him. I love him.  then i hung out with melissa! :) shes probably like, my best friend. she came over and we had all this ambition to go work out and we just sat around in the sun and ate and did NOTHING. and then we went over to jessies and hung out and then we were going to go to a party but it was "cancelled" or something stupid like that... so we went to king soopers to buy dxm and we saw stevo... so we got distracted and went to fascinations to buy nitris and did a bunch of that... it was so cool. First your lips go numb, then your toes... then your fingers, then your wrists, then your shoulders, then your arms and the back of your legs, then your chest and then you lay back and sort of trip for a while. Dont think ill do that ever again, but it was still fun. I really want to to dxm again. Or try acid.  dylan wrote this huge long cheesy entry in his blog about me, but i read it and i couldnt stop smiling. I love that kid. if you want to read his blog, the address is www.wyrmwood.blogspot.com  My spring break was so short-lived. it just flew by. It seems like it has just been a normal weekend. And tomorrow i have to go back to school. ::pout:: But at least tomorrows wednesday, so i only have a 3-day week. And then my freedom resumes at 3:00 on friday afternoon.  My stomach hurts... it gets worse and worse. I hope nothings wrong with me.... i'm tired, though. Im going to be a dork and go to bed all early. nightnight.  ~abby~

      mood: unwanted, alone music: Today- Smashing Pumpkins  Today. was ok. Sort of boring.   I woke up at like, 11:00, and jessie came to get me, and then we got connor and alex and drove around and bought pieces for alex and jessie (and i got her old one.. woohoo) and then we went to alexs and everyone kept coming and leaving and coming and leaving, and then i had to go...   i dont know what is wrong with me today. Maybe i have a fat personality for only today... im all self-conscious and alone-feeling.  today i felt a way i havent felt for a very long time. i feel stupid, fat, unworthy, and unwanted. i dont know. Maybe i'm just moody cause of my birth control pills. whatever.  i realized today that if i became fat, dylan would dump me and then throw rocks at me or something. Fucking bully. I love him though.   i watched pieces of april today... really really good movie. It reminds me of how my family is so critical of me. I am the first pancake... you know? the one that is all lopsided and half-cooked and falling apart that nobody really wants to eat so they just throw it away and make more...  my aunt is taking me to england. Whee. Today she gave me this "you should dress more conservatively when you travel" and like... i dont know. Something about being in a big city makes me want to be all punk-rocked out. But she said something stupid like ' i love you and accept you BUT the way you dress is completely unacceptable" It was really stupid.  anyway. I'm tired. im going to bed. i love you all.  as is,  ~abby

      mood: poop. music: last cigarette...dramarama  I hate my family. I mean, sure, theyre all fine and good in very small doses, but all over theyre just stupid and stressful and clumsy. My mom especially. She is a horrible driver (cause she has multiple sclerosis?) and she WILL NOT ADMIT IT. every time  i drive with her, i honestly fear for my life. She almost crashes into cars, and swerves in and out of traffic and makes me want to die. AND SHE IS SO FUCKING NAIVE. She knows nothing of boulder, its "that damn town with alternative people and dirty hippies and punks and gross subculture". and its retarded. And she has the right to yell at me whenever she feels the need to do so, yet when i "raise my voice" i am grounded and such. Being around them makes me hate everything in this world, cause they suck. and having my aunt around is horrible. i mean, i love her and all.... shes my aunt. but having her around is like having another one of my moms around. ITS TWICE THE FUN,  LEMME TELL YOU.  My vacation is more stressful than school. I want dylan.   on a ligher and more exciting note, i hung out with shana today! I love her! she is so cool. we walked around pearl street... and went to galleries and were all thoughtful and then we went to a bunch of stores and tried on UGLY clothing and for some reason, all these stupid activities were SO MUCH FUN. shes so optimistic, and makes me feel like this cool, invincible person and makes me want to get up and not drift through life like a lump of crap. and she makes me laugh, shes so funny. im going to work with her this summer at the womens wilderness institute... which is exciting.   i also went to the spa today with my mom and aunt. I got this scrub thing and now im SO moisturized. my skin is sooo soft. the lady put me in this big bathtub thing and sea-salt scrubbed me, and then hosed me down and then put lotion on me. i felt like a really big baby, just having someone bathe me.  John shirley is really emo. He sits in his room and whines about how he wants a girlfriend and is WHINEY AS FUCK and always sad and...uh...sucks.  i really need to get out of my house, too bad i cant drive...  dylan just called me, im all distracted now... !abby¡  oh yeah! someone, email me with something exciting to say...slinkypandemonium@yahoo.com

My dad made me clean for a lot of it. all of his shit, too...but my aunt came so thats cool.  SHES TAKING ME TO LONDON AND I AM SO EXCITED!!!! :D  whee!  but yeah, dylan took me out for my birthday to dinner, and then spent the night at my house, and my dad walked in on us AGAIN! (jesus) he never comes to check on us unless were doing something. Karma?  i got new cds, (dramarama and leftover crack) and a ginormous cd case, and a dress, and a lovesac. And now my aunts here, so ill prolly go shopping.  ack! I have to go, i think were going somewhere. Ill write later, sorry i suck at this post-writing business.  !abby¡

I love abby. wait... that came out wrong. this is dylan...updating abbys blog. but shhh. anyway i love her. even though she wrote "dylans a fucking geek" and tried to pass it of as meaningful. even though spawns hotter.  i swear on my vagina, dylan will not get sex for a very very long time. I will go find some really hot british NOT GEEKY man and have SO MUCH SEX with him but dylan wont care because he loves spawn more than he loves me and IF HE LOVES SPAWN SO MUCH, HE SHOULD FRIGGIN MARRY HIM!!!  How i loath that future british swine bag. Who shall i call upon to enact justice? spawn is the obvious choice as an angry nationalist new yorker. but he is weak to foreigners as show when the itallian mob rocked him back to hell. mabey venom would stand a better chance against that bad british hygiene. but hes vulnerable to sound and many british accents hurt. badly.  ...and there the geek goes, talking and talking about geeky comic book characters... all you girls (and guys with geeky girlfriends ) out there, NEVER. EVER. buy your boyfriend/girlfriend a cool action figure cause it will TAKE OVER YOUR LIFE AND EAT YOUR BOYFRIEND/GIRLFRIEND AND THEN YOU WILL GO AFTER A NICE NON GEEKY PERSON BUT THEN IT IS TOOOOOO LAAAAATE!  All i have to say is. Have you seen the cover of spawn issue 43? imagine an action figure of that.  Yes, spawn is cool. which is why dylan loves him more than me. Maybe if i had a cool red cape and a comic book after me about how i was the spawn of hell, he would love me too......  I WILL SEX YOU UP SO HARD!!!!  psh.   sex. later people.   dylan and abby  p.s. if you havent read the new venom series in issue six wolvee shows up and then in issue seven wolvee gets nuked. BAD ASS!

She talks about kindra all the time and how she is not worthy 2.) she listens to the foo fighters 3.) she denies it 4.) she has black hair 5.) and plays the acoustic guitar.. 6.) she cries "because she hates herself alot" (direct quote) 7.) she "writes stupid songs about her girlfriend on her guitar" (again, directly quote) 8.) she sits and stares at the wall for no reason for long periods of time 9.) she smokes cloves 10.) she sits at her computer all the time and is sad 11.) she spends long periods of time by herself at her house 12.) she wears a lot of button-up shirts 13.) every single entry she writes in her blog has to do with kindra and says the word "love" at LEAST 4 times. (even if the entry is really short) 14.) she listens to dashboard confessional and afi  Further conclusions that kelly is a very emo little girl.  ~abby

      Mood: in a mood to change the world music: requiem for a dream song, just watched The Laramie Project  Wow. Such a hate-filled night. Bush is a fucking psycho. Only 5 years ago a 21 year old Wyoming man was beaten to death on a fencepost, and now bush is trying to ban gay marriage because " we need to protect the right of being married, dont want those damn gays infecting our rights". While other countries focus on real issues, bush bombs the fuck out of everything and then looks the other way and picks on some issue that is completely irrelevant. He spends so much money funding the military to create war, while all the schools are so scrapped for money the students have to pay for copies of tests and papers. The world today is so fucking focused on who we should hate now, who is worse than we are...  they cant even see real issues. The world is so blind to everything that it cant even see. Ignorant people are stupid. i really wish i had more power to change the world, to make it better... if you think i sound like a hippie, fuck you. Go give someone a hug.  Whoo. on a happier note, I love oasos. I have so much fun every time i go there, and everybody there kicks so much ass!! Even the people i think are annoying kick ass at oasos.  Oh! i got a toy car for my birthday from Julianne. She's a really cool person, the type who you would just be  school-friends with (so i thought) but shes really cool.  I drove my little red car around for hours today on the school walls making fake car noises. It was the shit. And then i went to the clinic and i forgot my bus pass and i had to walk from 28th and valmont to PEARL STREET! And i took the really retarded way, i walked all the way to Broadway and Iris, and then i had to walk up broadway. It sucked ass. My feet hurt now... i want a massage.  Then i went to see dylan... He was being a geek and reading The New Spawn Comic (Whoooo!) but thats ok... i love him. He is so damn cute. I mean.. uh... only gay boys like to be called cute.. dylan is....uh... hotter than spawn and johnny depp combined? haha. Anyway, i love hanging out with him, i love him, i love everything he does, i love everything about him. I love dylan.  Ugh. Im tired. How come i always stay up so damn late and type in my blog? Oh! and i have a warm purry kitty on my lap again, when i walk in the door she makes me hold her and pet her.. its so cute... but its hard to get up when shes that cute and warm!!  I want to go to the Boulder Dinner Theatre. Or Santa Cruz with dylan. that would be soooooooo fun...  My birthday is in 6 days!  Thats all i have to say. im really surprised and pleased that i actually still write in this damn blog. Oh well. All you 3 people who read my blog, enjoy. ~abby

      mood: dissatisfied music : borstal breakout- sham 69   wow! people are stupid. especially... uh... oh yeah, everybody i know. psh. oh well. i have a warm, soft, purry kitty on my lap, which rocks.   ugh.. lately, i dont even know. everybody is depressed and i am constantly dissasisfied with myself. I am sort of turning into the way i used to be- and lately ive been SOOOO afraid of being abandoned... i dont even know why. the alice thing? maybe she sucked all my self-esteem out of me like tad is doing to her. but im just really scared that like.. all the people i love will spontaneously decide that im stupid/fat/annoying/whatever and just abandon me. which is insane and stupid...i wish i could just tell my brain to shut up. i am also really dissatisfied with boulder. i want to go on a vacation with dylan. boulder is like... this town where a whole bunch of hippies suddenly got a bunch of money and then it all went horribly horribly wrong... but its not so bad, i guess. i would just rather be somewhere else, as always... i really want to go to santa cruz with dylan.  i had a really good weekend, though... i went to glenwood springs with jessie which was fun. i smoked opium for the first time, which was cool. im soooooo sore from snowboarding 2 days in a row, and when i got back i smelled like eggs from the hot springs. oh god! i put myself in a swimsuit and realized how incredibly fucking white i am!!!! i want to go somewhere and fix that. i really want there to be no school. my birthday is in 8 days! yay! i'm excited. This year im going to have an awesome, kickass birthday. cause every year my birthday sucks, and this year im going to make up for it. plus, i have dylan... he's so wonderful...hes making all these plans, and its cute. He loves me :)  my kitten is so goddamn cute.  my mom bought me all this makeup today cause "i need to be more girly." so maybe ill wear it, who knows. she got me eyeshadow, mascara, lip stuff, the whole shebang (shabang? shibang? who the hell made up that expression anyways?).  i'm going to be a nanny this summer! for these disgusting little kids, but oh well, im going to make so much money, i can get a car and drive to see dylan every day! whee! oh god, its 11:30... i better go to bed, i have to get up all ass early tomorrow and go to school. poo...

      Feeling :slightly insane... overcome by drama Hearing: Cookie breath- mc chris (on the mix dylan made me :)  GAAAAH! dramadramadramadramadrama. TOO MUCH DRAMA. jesus. it haunts me. First of all- Alice. Shes been my best friend forever and shes been acting all wierd and then yesterday she said she didnt want to be my friend cause "she didnt want to put in the effort of seeing me when i go to new vista" and "i'm too punk" and "her new friends hate me, so she doesnt want to hang out" and "the fact that im still with dylan makes her sad" even though shes still with Tad and i hate tad and he has changed her so much, but i dont hold it against her. So we were talking, and i started crying, and then she sees lola and goes "OOH, LETS RUN OFF WITH LOLA!" and then runs of, and later gets a ride from my mom.  But all she said really makes me feel useless, ya know? Like our friendship for 10 years means absolutely NOTHING to her. Shes really....cruel sometimes. And she just deals with things in the meanest, most accusing way. Like we all did in middle school. Its retarded. And if I went to new vista, OF COURSE i would still see her. Melissa goes to a school a 1/2 hour away and i see her almost every other weekend. (melissa, you rock my socks by the way!)  but ACCCCKKKKblarglesnot. I need to find some friends who are less damn dramatic  On a happier note- Dylan bought me a ring. Its pretty... it has gold and 5 little diamonds and this really really really pretty jade band. Every time i talk to him i get all melty like i did when we were first dating....lol. He makes me go all stupid. And ahhh...so hot. Yum Yum Yum. I love him. I LOVE YOU DYLAN!   pbthh. It is 8:24 am and i have to get ready to go to school. Poop.  I might write later, all you loyal readers!

Im excited. melissa cut off all her hair and it was exciting.  I had a pretty crappy day i guess, i hate fairview. And my feet were all wet cause i had to chase after my moms car with no shoes on.. and then she made me walk to the bus stop cause i took too long. But oh, before that she told me something like "she never meant to have a daughter like ME" which is not something that makes you happy first thing in the morning. So i walked ot the bus stop crying, like in some dumb movie.   I LOVE SKA!  I'm wearing 4 socks.   I'm happy now because i love melissa and i love dylan and i love jessie and im having fun.  bihawk time!!!    abby

      mood: rebellious, questioning music: action shot  Whoo! I'm wearing really cool pvc pants. They are SO HOT. theyre lizs....  ::sigh:: Lately ive been so sad, poking at everything thats wrong and just thinking and thinking about it. I need a labotomy. Then my brain wouldnt make me so sad. Oh, and birth controls are making me sad, too. And i think theres something wrong with my stomach, i woke up this morning and i couldnt even move because i was in so much pain... and i just layed there cause i didnt want to wake Liz up. But lately i just feel so incredibly stupid/fat/annoying/unwanted. My mom and dad don't support anything i do, they yell at me for being "scary looking" and they yell at me because i'm not perfect in every way. And like... i'm still involved in stuff (gsa stuff mostly), ive been playing my bass a lot recently, and im getting decent grades, and because i dress stupid and wear stupid clothes doesnt mean i go beat babies with kittens.  But since im so sad, i cant really sleep... and i dont want to eat, and when i eat i feel really gross and dumb, and when i talk to people im always second-guessing things. Even with people who ive known for a while and am pretty good friends with... like Jessie and Dylan and people.  Ugh. i hate it when people spell things with an a. like... "Foreva!" "eva!"  "Nevah!"  And i hate it when people have buddy icons advertising stupid things. Like "I'm a babe!" "hot!" "sexy!" "single!" "In love!" and they have those stupid little animated people being sexy or being in love or whatever. STUPID!  I think im gonna pierce my lip this weekend.  I dont know. Anything. Sorry for this emo post, everyone. I'm going to go smoke a clove and play my acoustic guitar and whine about how nobody likes me and everyone hates me and i should just go eat worms.   ~abby

MY MOM IS INSANE!!!! that is all i have to say. Shes insane. INSANE!!!!  Dylan is so cute. He left me this long love-filled message and it was adorable.   Im debating whether or not to cut my hair super short so i could spike the hell out of it. Maybe that would be too much of a pain in the ass? or maybe it would just make it not suck. And maybe i could get a less ugly haircut... :) Anyway, i feel like doing something insane.   bah. homework sucks.::stabstab::  and the adicts rock! woohoo!  ~abby

      mood: tired, rant-tastical! music: People are strange - Doors  gah. birth control sucks.. It makes me all depressed for no reason.   I woke up this morning with dylan curled around me. It was so cute.  then when we got up he VOLUNTEERED AND MADE ME BREAKFAST! and he asked what i wanted and all. I felt so special. he gets points for that.  he made me all happy this morning.  Yesterday i went with liz to meet alex. I guess i dont know him... but he seems like he sucks. He kind of reminds me of the way dylan used to be. I would wait somewhere for a long time, and he wouldnt show up and id be like "oh god, if he doesnt show up, ill be so mad" and then hed show up, finally. Or he wouldnt show up at all. And then he wouldnt really act like he was happy to see me... or hed just talk about sex and i'd feel like a walking vagina. Anyway, alex showed up and did this and then was like "Why havent we had sex? i havent had sex in 3 months. blah blah" and then he refused to go anywhere cause we "might" see someone he knew and didnt want to talk to. And his teeth are gross.   anyway.   liz is just this beautiful person, inside and out... i hate to be cliche but she is. She is so much better than this guy...she could find someone who truly loves her and who would walk miles and miles in the rain just to meet her... not just meet her when it's convenient for him. blah blah blah, i'm cliche. But the point is, liz rocks and this guy sucks.   i have a job interview today, im all scared.  oh no, i was just picking my nose and i realized dylans watching me on my webcam. Oops.. :\ hehe...  People are strange when youre a stranger Faces look ugly, when youre alone Women seem wicked when you're unwanted Steets are uneven when you're down when youre strange... faces come out of the rain when youre strange... no one remembers your name when youre strange  when youre strange when youre strange  I feel all preppy and stupid, and now i have to go talk to someone about how they should hire me with purple hair.  abby

I NEED MORE DYE! i didnt  have enough so i could dye the back... i hope nobody notices... maybe ill just wear a bunch of hats all the time.  my kitty is so cute! and soft. I wonder if i tried to dye her tail purple if she would eat the dye. That would be bad... but shed be all cute if she was purple!! haha.  my dad's a dick. he wont let me go to jessies. And i'm bored.  I got glasses today... i look SO geeky! the guy was telling me what was fashionable and i put on all these insanely crazy colors of glasses and i looked like everything from robocop to martha stewart. There were these glasses that were made of metal and then lenses didnt touch the frames... they were suspended by tiny little wires in the corners.. it was so cool. But my glasses are boring. they arent so bad tho, they dont make me feel too super geeky. And i'll be able to see now. Which is a very good thing.  uh.  i guess thats it.   Whats 300 feet long and has no pubic hair?       ... the line in front of a Blink 182 show.    ~abby

It feels so cool and amazing to know all the things weve been through... and i love him. It seems like a few days ago we were in california, in alexs basement, in my hot tub, on dxm at jessies, walking along the sanfrancisco pier , falling asleep in my love sac together, losing our virginity, kissing for the first time by veeley lake, wrestling, bouncing on my trampoline, feeling loved, feeling unloved, going to a show, laying around naked, watching stupid movies, being walked in on, not being walked in on, excitement, showing each other off, drunken blowjobs, walking along pearl, riding up to his house with 4 dogs in the backseat of the car, at gamelan, having christmas, picking out a kitten, picking out a ring, being a mess, playing with the kitten, being happy, being sad, being squashed together in stevos car in the middle of summer, freezing at a bus stop, messing around in my bed, talking on the phone every day for hours and hours and hours...   i could go on for hours and hours, but i wont...there are people at my house.   I love you, dylan.   ~abby

I'm insane. i love him more than ive ever loved anyone before... more than anything in my life... but i just... cant even comprehend why i put up with this shit sometimes.  i was reading my old journals and its just... the same thing. its like a vicious cycle that we go through every couple of months. i feel like i can never talk to him about stuff... i do all the talking and he doesnt and then we both ignore it until it gets way horrible and then we break up or something, and then we date again and this wonderful cycle goes on and on....  goddamn. everybody needs to GROW THE FUCK UP.and boys are stupid. its amazing the whole world isnt lesbian...  i wish i felt appreciated. Me and dylans 1 year anniversary is in 3 DAYS! ... i hope he plans something really cool and exciting... he should, he stood me up today and made me cry and was a shitty boyfriend....he should do something huge and extravagant and awesome to make up for it.  i feel taken for granted... i could really leave at any time....  pbthhh.  oh god, homework. and then sleep.

And so i walked around pearl street crying for like, an hour. Then i decided to not be like one of those dumb girls who just walk away and  ignore their boyfriends and expect them to know what to do.... so i went back to see dylan. And i went to see him  and i had all this stuff to say. And then i saw him and i just started crying. I dont even know why... i didnt want to.  But i just cryed my eyes out for like, a half hour.   i'm insane. and i always fear ill just be abandoned.   this post is stupid.   god, im dumb.  ~abby

I'm eating cold french fries, i'm disgustingly sweaty, i have to fart, my room smells like cat pee, i am failing several classes, and i smell. But i am insanely happy.  I LOVE MUSIC! it is better than peeing on someone you hate and ice cream and rain and shows combined. It makes you fast, free, and happy.  it makes me sad that dylan "isnt a punk anymore." i mean... i love him so much... but i'm just 16 and i still want to be insane and do stupid things and get my ass kicked and dress all stupidly and think that i rock... and itd kick so much ass if he did too. when im with him i feel like i should grow up or be grown up and... i dont know. Do something productive and good. which may be a good thing, i dont know. ::shrug:: i love him more than anything and everything, more than music... its just i wish i would have known him when he was all punk rock and less of a geek. We wouldve had so much fun together... *punk rock love.* (haha...)  and he loves geekdom lots...  sometimes a lot more than me....  my hands smell like beer.  ::shrug::  im tired. and i smell.

      mood: tripping, dumb music: none... im at devons house and it is 8:06 am.  OH MAN OH MAN OYH MAN. im tripping. Last night i was hanging out with dylan (who i love so very very much....*swoooooooooooon*) and he was gping to spend the night at my house but he couldnt cause his mom sucks. So i went home, and then melissa and devon called (devon was having a party cause her mom is out of town...devon is my childhood friend and she rocks my socks!!!! shes a cool girl.) and so i brought melissa. whenwe got here it was just people sitting around and there were only like 6 people here, so we all went to the store and bought robotussin gelcaps. OH GOD. Its like dxm only less? i took a whole bunch, and i tripped so much! and melissa was just beingall cool... and it was her first time tripping anything so she had fun i guess. This morning i told her to sleep and she did but her eyes are still HUGE.   I went to the clinic yesterday and they checked out my tummy.. but oh god. This lady put me on a cold metal table with these papery tablecloth things and stuck this huge metal thing in me! and if that wasnt bad enough, she pushed it together and it SPREAD! and so here i am, naked from the waist down, having some 40 year old woman i just met prod me with cold metal objects and q tips. and then she puts this jelly  stuff on her hand and STICKS IT INSIDE ME (ack! my poor vagina!) and pokes around at my organs. eep! it was terrifying. But apparently im clinically okay.  today my tummy really hurts tho. i woke up from what i thought was a parallel dimension curled into a fetal position cause my stomach hurt so bad. maybe i burned a hole in my stomach last night. Which would suck. Id be like a skeleton trying to eat... i would be freakishly skinny and all the food i ate would go straight through me like a cheese grater. Except for those icky unwanted chunks that get stuck in between.  i just read that. I make no sense. im tryingreally hard to type and i dont even know what im talking about. im going to go rummage in devons fridge for food.  And i miss dylan. I LOVE YOU DYLAN! ive only seen him like once for like an hour in the whole week. Maybe ill call him today and we can go hot tubbing :)  ~abby~

I'm going to be in shape and be all sexy, i swear...  but that creepy creepy man is STILL at the rec center, oogling little girls... he's so fat and so old and so creepy. You walk in and he rapes you with his eyes.  me and melissa broke her car today. She ran into a curb and then we were driving down arapahoe and there was this huge popping sound and i was like "oh god, her tire popped, were gonna need to call a cab or a tow truck or walk/bus home... shitty... " and then we got out and it turns out the lining in her tire well just FELL OUT and her bumper was all loose...but it was so hilarious to see this huge part of her car dragging alongside the car for a bit. but we took it off and put it in her trunk ( the huge piece of plastic) and went home and got another car. And she might sell me her old car! (not the one that broke.) w00t.  god, im moody. i still hate everything and everyone today...but i do feel a lot better. i keep expecting all these things out of all these people and maybe my expectations are too high...or maybe people just suck. I feel sort of like i'm in a balloon, floating away from the rest of the world. Or in a bubble.  and no matter what i do, i keep floating away and i cant do anything about it. i guess i have all these things pent up that have been going on for a while, but theres not really anybody who would get it and i would just feel stupid trying to talk. And its hard to explain. Ill just do what i always do and ignore it until it gets bigger and i cry and then it goes away.  because that is easy.  i'm sorry i'm so dramatic, everyone...  mm, pizza downstairs. i'm out!

I feel like my brain has fallen out of my ears and im too stupid/lazy/brainless to notice/care. only 3 days of school left. Thank fucking god.   I was walking down the street yesterday to the bus stop with Liz and Shai and i saw john kerr. Wow. What a swift kick in the ass for me. Its people like that that make me want to go kill the world for being so stupid and become a straight-edger. I cant even believe he's still alive. I thought about him for like, 4 hours after i saw him. Wow. The last time i saw him, he was walking around in the daytime and being all drunk and insane. And apparently since then hes gone to jail and been in and out of like, 6 foster homes. Its really amazing to me, like... i bitch about how shitty my life is but im a spoiled little shit and i have a good life. That kid's life has just been one shit sandwich after another. And now hes living with his mom ( WHO IS INSANE AND HAS A MULLET) but i hope that goes ok for him. I really hope something wonderful happens to that kid. Itd be about fucking time.   And all my friends are leaving tuesday! Especially Melissa and Jessie! i dont even know what ill do without them. Go insane? or... ::gasp:: get new friends? I dont know. I wish i could go with jessie to europe, that would be so much fun, but i cant. And i forget when melissa is coming back, in a long time i think. Sauce all over that sauce.  i woke up next to dylan this morning ::smile::  Bleh. Finals week sucks. YAY! BUT I ONLY HAVE 5 FINALS LEFT EVERRRR!

She can pull anything off. Shes so cute.  So we went into town, and we hung out with emily and dave and jessie and dylan and rita and we walked around the creek fest and sat in love sacs and sky chairs for a long time. I like dave. He seems like a non-asshole and hes interesting and... yay jessie! im excited for you. but hes SOOO short. lol. thats ok, jessies short too.  i miss dylan! he was all tired today and non-active and i just wanted to run around and tackle him and go crazy.  im trying to talk on the phone and write this at the same time.. and its difficult.

Im such a fucking slacker... i hope i get a B average so i can drive this summer.   I wrote this long entry, but it didnt update it for some reason. Stupid blogger.  I went to alexs birthday party last night and got all kinds of drunk and had to fend off drunk geeks. WAY fun. I wish Dylan was there... And then i woke up this morning at jessies house at like 7:30 in the MORNING to really loud banging sounds cause they were tearing down a wall of her house. And i had the wierdest dreams... one i was driving jessies car drunk and we were trying to find bryce porn and being chased by those drill things from megaman x... it was wierd. and then i had a dream that jessie had a party like, on the deck outside her house. And she wouldnt let anyone inside for some reason... ::shrug:: But anyway, now im way tired since i got like 4 hours of sleep. But i got free lunch from spicy pickle, cause jessies dad owns part of it or something.  I need to redye my hair, and go work on MORE of my homework. Poop.  abby

It was the wierdest thing. I dont know why. Maybe cause i see myself as that little boy some day with my mom in a wheelchair? ::shrug:: I dont know. i am emo.  And then i got in the car and my mom was all "WHY ARE YOUR EYES GLAZED OVER!!!" (are you on drugs!!?!) and then i had to tell her no, i was crying, and then she bothered me for like 20 minutes about what was wrong and made me explain how im doing in school and how things are with dylan... blah blah... and then she just wouldnt shut up...  ugh. Theyre making a new sex pistols movie and Justin Timberlake is playing johnny rotten. That is fucking sickening.  Anyway, i have to pee and do stuff. Bye eyeryone!   as is,  abby

      mood: HUGE, ugly, sad music: fuck you and a half - fyp  pfffffft.   I had a really stupid day. I hate mondays. I guess in all reality nothing bad happened, i was just in a bad mood, and all quiet and stuff, and then i hung out with jessie which is always fun cause she rocks. And then my mom went crazy cause she expects jessie to be my chauffeur which is just stupid... its not her job to drive me around, and so she came to get me and she was yelling and she should just take responsibility for her own child or let me get my fucking liscense.  I think ive started to sleepwalk, i went to bed last night and i woke up this morning in different clothes and all the candles in my room were lit.  And i dont remember changing or lighting all my candles and why would anyone else do that at 7am? I dont know. and my candles hadnt been burning long, maybe like a 1/2 hour cause the wax wasnt all melted. Wierd.  I cant go to the last group tomorrow which makes me sad. My mom is a bitch and even though its my last group, she wont let me miss a minute of my classes to say goodbye to the people i probably wont ever talk to or see ever again since im moving to new vista and i wont be in the fairview girls group any  more. And im going to miss that. My mom is stupid, she's taken away all thats helping me and replaced it by yelling at me and being crazy. I swear shes going insane... her brain is like melting cause of her MS. She doesnt remember things and she is crazy. And i got in the car and she just started lecturing me about how i should be, how i'm not, what im not doing, what i should be doing/ dressing like/ acting like/ making friends with...all of that. She should not be insane and just BACK THE FUCK OFF.  When i talk to people lately, i feel creepy and stupid.  And i hate the people at my school. Seriously. they think they know everything and they'll fight their opinion they know nothing about. Like in my World History class we're talking about what an idiot Bush is and my whole class just starts talking about how they know how the terrorists are stupid and violent and they know how the people on 9/11 in the airplanes didnt care they were about to die. HOW DO THEY KNØW? were they there? NO! And all these dumb kids were tlaking about dnd in my math class and i mean, i know shit about dnd, but they're just so... ignorant! they make all this shit up and parade around like they know everything. And theyre all loud and stupid and.... ignorant. ::slice slice::  Anyway. I better go check into an ugly home... Or i better do my homework, so my mom is less insane...

Which is intense. I dont know what to say to her... if i tell her to quit obviously she cant...i dont know what to do...  Then my mom made me work and clean her car. And do yardwork. Poop.   I LOVE DEVON! she stayed up all night getting ready to have a party at her house for her friend tana, and then she stayed up all night cleaning up.

Or horribly disfigure them. torture them, anyway. Their parenting skills are horrible.  I was at jessies house, and i was just having fun, and then my mom calls me and is all "your dads coming to get you right now" and so then he shows up, lets himself in jessies house, and walks around to see who alls there. then i get in the car and he starts SCREAMING at me because... i dont know. He's an ass. And he was all "THERE WERE NO PARENTS AT HOME, you LIED to us... blah blah blah scream scream" and then he got all mad cause there werent any parents home to "supervise me and jessie and melissa". Like i am 12.   INSANITY.  Being in my house makes me feel like i'm going crazy. They control things just for the sake of controling them, not even for safety or anything (like when they tried to give me a curfew one night when i was spending the night at jessies??? lol) and they do stupid things to piss me off (like unplugging my computer or just HOVERING over me when im trying to do something...dylan knows this) so ill be angry so they can blame everything bad that ever happens on me. and when im really sad, they dont care, they just point all the bad things out and try to lay guilt trips on me.

      yes. ok.  1). Take your LJ username and replace each letter with the corresponding number (A=1, B=2, etc...). If your name contains numbers, you'll need to convert them to letters first before you can convert to numbers. k=11 i=9 l=12 l=12 a=1 g=7 e=5 n=14 e=5 r=18 a=1 t=20 i=9 o=15 n=14 2). Add all of the numbers together to create a kind of super number. 153 3). Make a note of the first digit of this number, then add the digits of the number together. 9 5). Take the digit you noted in step 3, and count that many words into the post. 9= life 6). Use the resulting word in a Google Image Search, and select a picture from the first page.  7). Post the results for us all to see. Ya big freak     uh. yeah. there you all go.

Im still having fun in London, i love it here.   uhm.   ive seen a bunch of plays, i guess.. i saw Les Miserables, The complete works of William Shakespear (which was like, a takeoff thing of shakespeare) and chicago. i went and did all the touristy stuff, which was cool. My aunt took a tour of the tower of london which was boring so i wandered off and talked to some french kids even though i suck at french. we went on the london eye, which is the tallest ferris wheel in the world, and it was REALLY tall. and we went to the london dungeons which sucked ass. ALL OF YOU- NEVER GO TO THE LONDON DUNGEONS UNLESS YOU ARE UNDER 12 YEARS OLD. IT IS BORING AND TOURISTY AND CHEESY AS HELL.  whew. anyway. and uh. i tried to make the guys with the fuzzy hats laugh, but then after about 2 minutes i got bored of that because they never laugh and i just felt stupid trying.   oh yeah! and i went to the Westminster abbey this morning for CHURCH at 8 AM! because my aunt wanted me to experience a service in a major church, i guess. Ugh. it was boring and early and they kept giving me horrible looks and my uncle kept being all 'is this what you normally wear when you try to show your respect for another country's beliefs?' and i was like 'wtf, i didnt plan on bringing clothes to go to church in...'  so.  uh. i went and hung out on camden (again) with the same people (again.)i met this really funny german kid named alex who didnt speak a whole lot of english but thats ok, he was hilarious anyway. he was trying to tell me about his piercings, hes the only other person ive ever seen with the bridge of his nose pierced (like liz) and we just sat around, again. OH, and then i had to go home and he was trying to help me get around the underground, but i got lost as hell anyway and then he had to go meet his girlfriend i guess. anyway, even thought it probably doesnt sound like it, it was fun.  oh! last night i went to a street fair, because it was really close to my house. it was in the street a couple of blocks away from my flat, and my window opens really easily so i just went. It was a bunch of drunken british people wandering around, and there was some band playing and some drunken girl gave me some champagne.   i still have  my mushrooms, i got a LOT...i dont even know how much it weighs, im gonna weigh it when i get back to colorado. a lot of mushrooms, though. like 20-30 stems? anyway. somebody is eating pasta and i really want some, cause it smells really good. i figured out how to put pictures that i took on the internet, but i am horrendously stupid and i forgot to bring my camera to the internet cafe thing.  i had to ship my bullet belt home today, im going to be so pissed if it doesnt come through customs... i payed more to ship it than i did to BUY it. stupid british postage costing a gazillion dollars.   anyway. i come home on saturday, thats in 2 days... i think my plane gets in around 6:30 pm. BUT I DONT HAVE TO BABYSIT THE NEXT DAY, THANK FUCKING GOD. i swear, by the end of the summer, im going to murder those fucking children. ::stab::. so much anger.   im hungry, im going to go home i think...  i miss you all SO much.  ~abby

      mood: rebellious music: look back and laugh- minor threat  my aunt is a bitch.  she's taking me to london (woohoo!) but yesterday she called me and just told me how horrible and unnacceptable my clothes are and how i need to dress "conservatively" so i dont get attacked by terrorists for looking american. and somehow purple hair isnt a problem. just ripped clothes. but i can still wear "punk" shirts? wtf? and i wont get attacked by terrorists for looking american or something? i dont know. Shes fucking insane. Shes making me wear jeans (didnt the americans invent jeans?) and shoes (im gonna wear converse, which i think americans invented too...)   ::shrug::   and i had all these horrible dreams last night... and i woke up crying. i woke up and dylan was like, poking me and asking me why i was crying. it was really wierd...  woah. ian just called me. oh... no wonder. he and his girlfriend broke up.  bah. i have to pee.  ~abby

      mood: lost, pondering music: rock and roll - velvet underground  my lips are so fucking chapped. And i love velvet underground.  ugh. Horrible fucking day. Woke up to screaming little children in my bed (no, i hadnt spontaneously given birth overnight, they are my kids im nannying for.) Then the boy went to...gymnastics or something? and the girl sat at home. Then i had to drop the boy off at a birthday party, but i was supposed to stay with him or something according to the mom so i ended up being a sucker and babysitting for like, 10 kids at a little kid pool party. And i hung out with Jaclyn Rosania cause someone she was babysitting was there too or something, i dont know and i dont care. And i had to listen to some old lady tell me all these stories about when she was young, when her kids were young, back in the day... blah blah. Thats what old people do. They sit around and pretend they are still youthful by rambling on and on about when they were youthful. And it doesnt work. They just sound older. Oh well. And then the violent little shit was being a violent little shit and fighting with his sister, and suddenly she grabbed him by the back of the head and smashed his head into the table all wrestling-style. it was hilarious. but yet so horrible.   oh, and yesterday i went to see shrek 2 with them. Let me tell you. They are the brattiest, most violent and irritating little shits ever. I really feel sorry for the human race and i want to never have children and rip out my uterus and stab it to death if i ever get pregnant.  ugh. enough of that rant.   and then i went to gamelan and sat around and i was really sad at first, and i was just thinking a lot, and what travis said popped into my head and i just thought about that for a really long time. And i thought about love, and the world, and people in it, and a bunch of other, less corny shit. And i thought just about... stuff. But for some reason during all this i felt really sad... maybe cause of my day? i dont know. I figured out that my plane ticket to santa cruz is gonna be $358, and i only have made like $250 so far, but im almost there. I hope dylan helps me pay for my ticket, even though hes payed for a lot of stuff. But $358 is a lot, and i think my mom is going to make me pay all of it, even though she said originally i would only have to pay for $200 of it. Poop on that.   i'm really sleep-deprived, and really insane. I'm leaving for london on wednesday.  why cant i just die? and come back to life when i have money and im all better?  the world is a stupid place.  Sorry for the long post everyone, ill make it even longer by adding a picture.   smoke is way cool.  thats all, i guess.  i think i have bad self-esteem.  ~abby

Hahahahaha, and apparently john shirley is going to get all his stupid crusties to come kick me, dylan, and alexs ass. How fucking sad. that kid sucks so fucking much.   uh. thats all i think.  ~abby

      mood: my head hurts and i smell like hampsters and little kids music: 99 red balloons - by uh... goldfinger i think?  little kid madness! I guess it wasnt that bad, they just ran around and screamed a lot. Oh, and they got these hampsters and they kept hiding them places and i was freaking out cause i didnt want to lose them and get yelled at (or fired) (from my nannying... hahahahaha) (although maybe being fired would be the desired option....) ::ponder::  my head hurts! owww!  i went and saw Van Hellsing for the second time. Yeah, shut up. I didnt pay to get in, liz's boyfriend got us in by pretending that he worked at subway or something... i dont know. But laramie came... haha. that girl is so fucking hilarious. Every time im with her we just generate stupid and hilariousity and were probably really loud and annoying but thats ok, we make anything fun. Even shitty movies and stupid shit.  i really want to kick someone in the face, but i cant say who on here because everyone reads this crap ( i dont know why, i think my life is boring as hell...but whatever you all want to do, go for it). But yes. You! annoying stupid shithead! ::kick kick stab::  something in my room smells really bad, and i hope its not me. I really need to bathe and stop smelling like small kids and hampsters... its fucking disgusting. Maybe ill go do that.  oh yeah, that ashley girl keeps calling me and im sort of avoiding her... cause shes really creepy and.....creepy. I guess shes nice.. shes just insane. And shes a hot topic girl who tries way too hard to get friends.   uh. i think thats it. Tomorrow i have to take the kids to the swimming pool... and i dont have a car. Bus possibly? this could be hazardous. Hopefully i wont die.  i wonder when melissa gets back? if anybody knows, they should tell me   ~abby

Theres a fan in my windowsill (behind my computer) and its on cause its hot but as a result im looking straight into a fan and trying to read so im keeping my eyes really open and theyre drying out and it hurts. psh. but im listening to beautiful. beautiful punk rock music.   aah! my phone keeps ringing. i feel so loved, a whole bunch of people are calling me and asking me to hang out! too bad i cant cause i have to chase after little children at 8:30 IN THE FUCKING MORNING. ::slice slice::  little kids. ew. be prepared for the upcoming whining and rants this week as the events commence.   mmm, pop punk. mmm, 99 red balloons song.  this is boring. i think maybe ill go sleep or go play more vice city because at the moment that is all my life consists of.   im way excited to go to london, theres apparently free legal mushrooms and theyre fresh and really yummy but they sell them as "ornaments" so maybe ill bring a bunch of them back and have a huge tripping extravaganza. If anyone wants some and im able to smuggle them back and i dont have to cram them in my ass, give me money before next week and i shall get you some. mmm, mushrooms.  i wish i had  $300 to pay for santa cruz... and $900 for a car, and $1000 for insurance. damn, things are expensive. pbthh.  vice city!!!(thank you dylan)  ~abby

      mood: sick music: six barrel shotgun- black rebel motorcycle  blargledeath. im so sick. i have a fever and im coughing up gross shit and i just feel gross. and i still have to nanny. i have to nanny friday at 8:30 in the morning. and today i have to pick them up and deal with them screaming in my car (which is WAY more distracting than having teenagers in my car... but yet i am allowed to drive screaming, fighting, spitting loud children around and i cant drive one of my friends 5 blocks.)  ugh. ::coughs up lung::  its amazing how much people change. i was thinking about that today. some change for the better, some for the worse. some you just want to kiss, some you wouldnt piss on if they were on fire. its really disorienting. we all grow up at some time, though most wouldnt admit it. everyone around me is changing, shifting. Wanting to become something new. i dont. but i am. i realize things about my life that have changed me or helped me. kaley and simone are 2 examples. i called them today, just to talk. its wierd. just talking. connecting with old friends and first loves really makes you think.   aw fuck, i have to go to work. i might rant some more later.  ~abby

Then i call dylan about  8 and hes all "oh, im going home 'cause i feel like it" which just made my day ... and the thing is i blew off a bunch of people and then the person who i thought was least likely to just blow me off.. blew me off. and didnt even call me... whatever. i'm sure you all dont care. i just. hate this. and then he said hed call later, which of course he didnt. maybe something else is wrong and he just doesnt want to tell me... or maybe im being a stupid little girl. or maybe its a jolt into reality that its not all perfect. anyway... weve been fighting lately and it makes me reallly sad. like the ther day i yelled at him for constantly making fun of my friends and then we both got all mad and didnt fix anything. but i dont think he'll change, i dont want him to change, i hate that when girls drag their boyfriends aorund and change everything about them.  anyway, so then i sat there moping for a while, then went and met up with cheyenne, ko, and john. and then we hung out with a bunch of people i dont like on top of mesa and watched the fireworks from all different cities... and then we went back to ellies house and blew shit up.  ::sigh:: im so sickeningly in love with that stupid boy that it really hurts.

It really made me think. there were people yelling out in the theatre and at the end everyone clapped and stood up. I guess that would be boulder.   anyway, people should go see it, but with an open mind.   i'm eating cake, cause theres no good food in my house. i dont like cake. i want some pie. pie is so much better.  um. i dont know what to say... i feel really lonely today, i guess. uh. i made cookies?  ever since i got back from london my life has been increasingly boring.   i miss dylan. im pathetic, i can't not talk to him for one single day.  sham 69 kicks ass.   ~abby

CLIMBING IS FUN.  it made me think about kaley a lot. and lance. and just people? i dont know. i really like climbing tho. i want to go more often when i get back to colorado. but now my arms are so sore, and they hurt like fuck. oh well. ::whine whine:: my foot hurts too, maybe ill just do nothing for a while when i get back to colorado.  and then i go to canada, and im going on a river kayaking trip and lots of midnight downhilling and lake-ing and partying with pierce and alex and katie and allison and wakeboarding and being tan and cliff diving and eating gigantic popsicles. and getting massages from jon and learning how to not say "boat" or "phone". and having marshmallow roasts on the beach and making fun of the russian girl. haha. wow. that sounded racist. im really not, shes just hilarious.  haha, the UC  santa cruz's mascot is the banana slugs. Rock.  i really like santa cruz. i really like sitting below the lost boys bridge and looking out at all the people. and walking in the ocean and being crazy with dylan and just. everything.  bah. aim express is being stupid. fuck youuu!!  i had this really wierd dream, we were all at alexs only his house was HUGE, and his room was like 3 stories with a spiral staircase, and these army people came in with cages and were all "in the army, if youre a prisoner of war, THIS is what its like" and put us in the cage. and alexs mom bought all these new dogs, all these stupid poodles and this cool golden retriever, and she (alexs mom, not the dog) was wandering around trying to get a tan (in the house?) and then bryce showed up and was like "lets have a party at your aunts house" and so we went to my aunts house and she was there and she was like 'yeah, whatever. you can throw a party starting tomorrow morning but you cant do it tonight." and it was wierd. anyway.  i think im going to bed. nightnight all.  i come back on thursday. ::pout::  i hope things are better for liz.  ~abby

      mood: having fun, in love, rocking it out in santa cruz music: some really wierd flute music thats playing in this house   oh man. i love this place. Today, me and dylan laid around all morning, and then we went down to the boardwalk and the lost boys bridge, we went and climbed under it and sat on this pipe thing for a while, which was really pretty and awesome. and then we walked all the way up the beach and back, and then all the way down this wharf (the thing stupid canadians call a dock...hahahaha) and then we walked around the boardwalk again. fun stuff.  i love dylan. like. I cant even explain it. theres nothing in my life that i have ever experienced quite like it. i love all the little things about him, and i love being with him, and i just... i dont know. he is amazing.  oh- to everyone hes mean to... he says hes just mean to you cause he thinks its funny.  cheyennes hair isnt purple! i wonder what color it is...  mmm... pizza is ready. im going to go eat it ALL UP and then go stuff myself full of mariannes ice cream.  ~abby

      mood: hyper music: none  whee! im in santa cruz with my dylan :) its so exciting. today i havent really done anything... we just walked around a bunch inthis pearl streetish area, which was fun... its exactly like boulder, only with more culture and less yuppies. i bought a bunch of cds and stuff, which was cool.  yesterday we went down to berkeley to visit dylans other sister (theres 2 in california, were staying in santa cruz with one and the other is in berkeley obviously) and that was cool. i got to meet the coolest dog, he was ultra sweet and really playful and really cute and just rockin. and then we went to this place called the Albany Bulb (cause its shaped like a lightbulb) and wandered around. the Albany bulb is this place that used to be a landfill, but now its a park, so theres all these really elaborate statues of dragons and birds and people and castles and bikes and paintings all made out of old bits of trash. theres this huge dragon/knight made out of old scraps of wood and shit... its really cool. and theres this castle called marks castle made out of cemetnt, and it has a spiral staircase leading up to the 2nd level with a balcony. its really a cool place. i wanted to run around and see EVERYTHING but we had to leave and we cant go today cause its too far away. :( oh well.  it was way fun.  uh. then we went to this pizza place called Zacharys Pizza and it was realllly good but i guess my stomach shrank when i was sick so i couldnt eat tons and tons like i wanted to. ::shrug:: but i had fun with dylan and his crazy sisters and their crazy partners and the rockin dog arthur. tonight i think were going to go to the boardwalk... im so bored, everyone is sitting around and im like "run around and play! yay!" but nobody wants to, so whatever. ill sit here.  ohhh yeah! the day i left for santa cruz jessie came over and we ate brownies and then my bullet belt came! finally!!!!! i guess they had to ship it cause it was hazardous and they didnt want it to be carried on an airplane or something but i dont care cause it came and that fucking rocks.  i dont know. im bored. maybe ill go pry dylan off the sofa and away from ff and well go run around.  byebye everyone!
