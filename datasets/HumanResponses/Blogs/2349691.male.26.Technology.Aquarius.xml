      Well.. I am not a Rock 'n Roll star. Nor am I a multi-millionaire who can afford to live life the "Rock 'n Roll way".  Then who am I ?? Just an uninteresting 26-something guy who leads a drab and uninteresting life ?? Well yes. Not that I dont like 20-something babes hanging around my neck, but thats the way it is. Yes, maybe now you can close this window and move on to other interesting things.  I have a friend whose interests range from "Universe" to "Child Psychology". I can understand the second one as it stemmed from a desperate attempt to woo a "girl". But "Universe" ?? Never could get that. More on that later.  Now, I dont claim such interests. My Dad wanted to make me a good artist. He probably thought otherwise, when he saw my drawings, and started concentrating on my sister. She did become a good one at that, I should add.  But then, my interests do span various realms. Mundane stuff like reading comics, more mundane stuff like, well, I'll go into that later. The point is there is nothing exotic. So there. Is it a miracle that babes don't dig me ??  I have another friend who started growing his hair. The last time he went to the barber was on August 11th, 2002. (I have heard it so many times from him that the date is imprinted in my head). Well, it has grown so long that it gives him, frequent bouts of fever, due to water clogged hair etc. Now he wants to cut it off. The day dawns and invariably a person appears, who comments on his hair. Good or bad, it becomes an ego issue and there you are. (Hope he doesn't see this blog, as he happens to be my room-mate).  More on friends. This guy loves his RD350. Don't ask what an RD350 is. As per him, it is renowned the world over. Still, I'll let you in on the secret. It is a two-wheeler from the Neanderthal Era. You don't ride it. You just push it. Most of the RD lovers claim that it can be driven at least 10% of the way. Still you have a laborious 90% push ahead. There is a club of RD lovers in our city. They meet every Friday night, to discuss what is wrong with their bike. You see, it is a never ending experience. Now I am planning to buy one too.  So you see, I am one of the sanest guys you can meet. (Are the babes listening ?).

      I'll breeze through the rest of the inmates of the "Asylum for the Mentally Challenged"  The  Robot  has a mechanical way about him. I will not poke fun at him. If it was not for him, I would not have got even pass marks in my Final Year Project in college.  The  Perpetual Whiner  has the whole world scheming against him. His colleagues, his old classmates, his friends, all of them. One typical complaint, "Guys, yesterday, I was walking down this road and I met this colleague of mine. He didn't say 'Hi'. Not only that, he turned and walked away too. Now that I wonder, my appraisal must have gone bad because this guy must have poisoned my boss's ears etc. blah.. blah.. blah..". All our consolations like "He must not have seen you", "He must have been  preoccuppied" falls on deaf ears. Now for all we know, he might not know him even.   Bride Seeker  has been in his quest for well over 3 years now. Still no luck.   Fear Factor  is so fearful that if a guy in the neighbourhood is down with fever, he will go to the doctor for treatment for suspected typhoid, malaria, jaundice etc.   Lazy Lozenge  is so lazy that if he has just done his shitting in a beach, he'll wait for the waves to come and wipe the shit off his ass.   Gentle Giant  is an amiable giant who lives life righteously and is on the path to salvation.   District Committee  was one of the influential political figures from college days. You throw so much as a wrong glance at him and he will have the party's district committee after you. After an MBA degree, now he has thrown the party's Proletarian policies to the wind and joined an MNC.

       Seemingly Silent  is in Canada. He is supposed to have come back a few months ago. But always, miraculously (mind you), at the last moment his stay gets extended. The latest is, he is coming back on 28th. Well, I am not going to the airport to recieve him. First thing, he comes at odd hours, like 4:30 in the morning. You lose a good amount of sleep that way. Secondly, even if I get up by 4 am and reach airport by 4:30 am, I might get a call from Canada saying his stay has been extended. Believe me, after waiting for hours in the freezing cold in a singlet, such a call is not  what one looks forward to.

      Enough about friends. The point being, you are reading the blog of a very sane, "no-marbles-rolling-upstairs" kind of a guy.  Still I can't help this one. After the  Romantic , the  Wild Man from Borneo , the  Bike-Push  and the  Great White Hope , Ladies and Gentlemen, I present you, the  Patriot . What is so special in this, you might ask. Well, he is the first one after the great Mahatma Gandhi to have  started the "Quit India" movement, or rather re-started. Whoa there.. wait a minute.. we thought the Britishers were peacefully sipping Indian tea and smoking India Kings in their colonial mansions back home in England, with only delusions of grandeur for company. Well, who said anything about the Britishers quitting India. Yes, milord. It is the Indians this time who have to quit India. Where to ?? The United Old States, where else ??   The  Patriot  has a ravenous appetite. You have to see it to believe it. Buckets of rice, disappearing in minutes. Chappathis being gobbled by the dozen. He once said (It was more like an open question), "Guys, of late I am getting fatter, dunno why". We consoled him, "Dear, it must be the combined effects of the sudden climate change and the El Nino and the impending Iraq War. Don't you worry about it".  He is an avid trekker. The lazy guys in our usual trekking gang (includes me) usually forms a committee to veto the suggestions put forward by him. To tell you the truth, it not only makes our life easier, but makes his life easier too. Fact being, enthusiasm apart, he is just another pot-bellied not-fully-fit guy like us. (Ooops.. girls, please ignore the previous sentence).

      This guy has another obsession. He wants to be a caucasoid. Of course he knows that it is impossible to alter the bone structure etc., but he feels he can be white. a la Michael Jackson. From the brown Indian to the white American, or rather the White Indian. In fact he is so obsessed that, he has already spent a fortune on it. The result, well that is the sad part.  In the mean time, he started learning guitar. Self learning, mind you. After two years, he is now a guitar player. A good one at that. He has really learnt the ropes, or rather strings in this case. He once made me listen to  Californication  by  Red Hot Chilli Peppers . Really good, I even exclaimed that this seems to be an unplugged version etc. Then I realized that it was recorded by him. Vocals, Lead, Base and Rhythm, all credit goes to the  great white hope .  All said and done, he is one of the most brilliant people I have met on this planet. (I will tell you about my inter-planetary sojourns later).

      Forgot to tell you.  Seemingly Silent  came back. I did not go to the airport to pick him up. He came on his own. Spent a fortune on the taxi too.  &nbsp;   Seemingly Silent  started relating his Canada experiences. At 4:30 in the morning. I finally did end up losing my sleep. And the very&nbsp;day he arrived,&nbsp;I was diagnosed with jaundice. &nbsp; After 3 weeks, the worst of it is over now. My affliction as well as his fiction.

       Great White Hope  has a software company. Rather had one. He had started one sometime back. It was going well for a while. The Guitar-craze put an end to it. Well, someone has to take rock music forward !!   Recently, I heard from his friend and secretary that he has suddenly regained interest in software building business and has started recruiting people. "Good for him", I said.   More recently, we all got a mail from him, asking to check out his latest rock recordings. Now what should I say ? Anyway check out  urlLink http://www.calliphonia.com . Mind you, the site may be down most of the time.

       Robot  went to Taiwan for a few days' trip. Official, of course. He came back, complained of viral fever, and went home for a few days rest.  Bike-Push , his room-mate, too started having dizzy spells. Turned out they were both suffering from jaundice. Then the rush started. One by one,  District Committee ,  Bride Seeker  and  Fear Factor  too went home complaining of jaundice. The last one to get infected was yours truly. Wait, that's what everybody thought.  One day, I called up  Lazy Lozenge  from my home, to enquire about his well being. He started screaming at me. Poor chap. He too contracted the disease, and was admitted in a good but cut-throat hospital. Mind you, in Allopathy, there is no cure for Jaundice. The only prescribed medication is 'complete rest'. It is heart-breaking to think of the bill presented to  Lazy Lozenge  from the hospital. And that too, just for using their bed for a couple of days.  Sadly,  Wild Man from Borneo  somehow escaped the Jaundice epidemic.

      In February I was in Bombay on an Official visit. Went for 2 days and came back after a month. You know clients. They can be pushy. Well, they were in a jam and we had the moral responsibility to help them out. Especially since they got into the jam because of us. Wait a minute, that is not my point. The point is I met a few old friends there. I met the software engineer who quit software engineering to become a film-maker (Last I heard of him was he was thinking of joining the Industry back). A good friend. He can kill panthers with his bare hands (So he claims). I also met the software engineer who quit software engineering to become an NGO activist. He was desperately trying to get out of the NGO business.  The lesson learned : Do not quit software engineering.

      Did I tell you that all of us were batchmates in college ?? Well.. Yes. Nice old days. Enjoyed 4 years. And then we ended up in this city. Many others did well in their lives since. We.. well, we too did well. The hotellers did prosper once we came to this city. An obscure mechanic, with a small two-wheeler workshop by the highway, also prospered.  Many other car workshops also prospered. Take the case of our  Lazy Lozenge 's car. Once he was trying to park his car in the basement of his apartment. There was a pillar by the side. As he was backing up, suddenly this pillar just jumped out and moved 2 feet towards the car. Believe me, for no reason, the concrete pillar moved. Poor  Lozenge , 5000 rupees down the drain for the scratched door, broken glass etc. That  Lozenge  is no expert driver is quite another matter. Tell me what could he do, if concrete pillars start behaving like this ? They are supposed to know their place.

      The  Wild man from Borneo  has a car. We go places in that. The latest trip was to attend a friend's marriage. A dear old chap, who would have been heart-broken, if we hadn't attended.  The first time the issue was discussed was when the  Patriot  came back after a 3 month stay in his "homeland". He threw a party, as usual, in our house. The party was well attended, again, as usual. The  Wild M an, the  Patriot  (of course), the  Bike-Push , the  Perpetual Whiner ,  District Committee ,  Fear Factor , all attended. The  Bike-Push  argued with great effort, the futility of attending friends' marriages (in general). The reason laid down was, the married guys no longer come to our bachelor dens etc. Seemed like a lame reason to me. Dunno. The arguments got heated and finally I requested a vote. Everybody except Bike-Push voted an emphatic "Yes, I will attend the marriage".  The day fast approaching,  Perpetual Whiner , telephoned me saying he will not be able to attend. Same was the case with  Distict Committee . To cut a long story short, the final head count came down to 4. Fear Factor, Patriot, Wild Man and I.  Wild Man  suggested travelling by his car and we agreed.  The day dawned and the  Patriot  who had made such big noises against Bike-push on the day of the argument started balking. The reason : (Brace yourself) His girlfriend told him not to go.  Heart-broken at the fact that our dear friend, ditched us for a girl and more heart-broken at the fact that, we didn't have a girlfriend like that (so that we could have ditched him some time in the future), the three of us,  Wild Man ,  Fear Factor  and I, set off to see the last bachelor day of a dear friend.

      There are a lot of places in South India, that remains unexplored and untouched by the so-called civilization. If you are an ardent trekker you will agree. Such pristine beauty as we find in the peaks of Kumaraparvatha, Kudremukh or Kodachadri is to be experienced at least once in a life time. Here I will detail about a few experiences I have had in the past four years on the mountains of Karnataka.

       Trip :  Kemmannagundi   Places Visited :  Kemmannagundi, Shringeri, Agumbe, Kudremukh(KIOCL)   Dates :  23-Dec-2000, 24-Dec-2000, 25-Dec-2000   Vehicle :   urlLink Tempo Traveller    Participants :  Kannan(Chetti), Manesh(Nair), Sangeeth(Aliyan),  urlLink Sanjeev(Khoj) ,  urlLink Sreepad(Pad) , Sujith(Mootta), Suraj(Susu),  urlLink Suresh(Warri) ,  urlLink Sushen     Report:   This was my first trip with my old batchmates of  urlLink REC Calicut  (Now  urlLink NIT Calicut ). I had come down to Bangalore from Bombay after a job change. Chetti suggested going to some place during the long Christmas weekend. Mootta as usual was enthusiastic and arranged the whole trip.   The main place suggested was Kemmannagundi and Kudremukh. The former for a visit and the latter for a trek. Mootta suggested that we visit Shringeri Mutt also which was on the way. We booked a  urlLink Tempo Traveller  from Jet Tours and Travels, Koramangala and were on our way by 8:00 pm on Friday, 22nd December.   We took the Tumkur road upto Nelamangala and turned left for Hassan. By 10:00 pm, we stopped at a roadside dhaba to have food. Most of the time self-styled cinematographer Warri, was handling Mootta's camcorder. Seemingly, most of the time was spent on learning how to operate the thing-a-mi-jig.   Almost 45 minutes after we left the dhaba, Mootta realized that his camcorder is missing. He had left it at the dhaba. We took and U-turn and raced back. Fortunately, the watchman there had noticed the camcorder and had kept it safely. Overjoyed, Mootta gave him 100 rupees as a present.   We reached Kemmannagundi, by 9:00 am on Saturday. The place was not as we expected. It was commercialized, and we saw a lot of tourist buses, with scores of people. Disappointed, we decided to get away from the civilization by climbing a nearby hill. After a few step Warri started having dizzy spells. A few more steps later he started vomiting. There was a big tree on the way up. Chetti and Aliyan took Warri to the shade and left him to sleep.   We continued our way up and reached the top. The view was breathtaking. We decided to stay there for some time. Some of us even slept for a while. It is not everyday that we get such fresh air to breath.   On the way down we took a slightly different route. We were soon surrounded by tall grass. We were walking in a line and I had Mootta in front of me some 15 metres ahead. Mootta had a straw hat on and that was the only part of him that was visible among the tall grass. Suddenly the straw hat disappeared. Khoj, Pad and I ran towards the spot where we last saw the hat. Not surprisingly Mootta had fallen into a ditch and was trying to climb up. Owing to his height which is all of 5 feet, he was finding it difficult to climb up. Pad and I lent a hand and got him out of his predicament.   Warri was awake and ok by the time we reached the place where we had left him. We had found a small stream on our way up. Though we did not have soap or towel, we decided on taking bath there. The small waterfall served as a lovely shower.   Our next destination was Shringeri. Enroute we stopped by the roadside collected a few twigs and made a campfire. Susu, Warri, Mootta, Aliyan, Khoj and me slept in the open, while others slept inside the van. By early morning, when I woke up, I could find only Warri sleeping next to me. All others had taken refuge in the warmth of the van.   We soon reached Shringeri and took a couple of rooms in a hotel to freshen up. Wonder of wonders - Warri, who generally hates water was the first one to take bath. After the bath we proceeded to have a darshan in the temple. We took a few photographs too.   Since the visit to Shringeri got over very fast, we had time to kill. We decided to go to Agumbe which was supposedly nearby. Again, supposedly it offered a lot of trekking oppurtunities.   We reached the place by middday. The route to the view point was unsurfaced. The driver refused to take the van through the kutcha road, saying that the tyres might get punctured. We decided to walk. When we asked a villager about the approximate distance, he said it would be about 3 km. After 3 km we met another chap who again gave the same answer to our question. Perplexed, we walked on. After walking for about 7-8 km through thick jungle, we reached the view point. We could see a couple of waterfalls in a distant mountain. Chetti argued that it was actually nearb and wanted to trek upto it. Even though there was no path, Chetti, Nair and Mootta decided to descend the hillock we were in, cross the jungle and go to the waterfall. The rest of us blankly refused.   For some time we could hear Mootta and Nair, shouting. Phrases like "Step on that boulder", "Catch that creeper", "Swing like Tarzan" etc. wafted through the air. There was no sound from Chetti. A few minutes later, Mootta and Nair came back up announced, "We tried our level best, there is no way we can reach the waterfalls through such dense jungle". We were surprised to see these dare-devils fresh and without a mark on their clothes. A few minutes later an exhausted Chetti came back up, full of bruises and muddy clothes. It was then we realized that Mootta and Nair were merely directing Chetti, by sitting comfortably on a piece of rock.   We had supper from a nearby Muslim home. They had prepared tasty fish curry and rice for us. The charge was very nominal. The lady of the house explained to us in broken Malayalam that she was from Kasaragod, the northernmost district of Kerala.   After supper, we proceeded to Kudremukh. We soon fell asleep inside the van. When I woke up at 5:30 in the morning we were standing still. I saw the driver sleeping bent over the steering with his head on his hands. Everybody woke up one by one and asked the driver, what the problem was. He explained that the van had broken down. We were only a few miles away from Kudremukh. But the van had to be repaired first.   As soon as it was light enough to see, the driver started towards Mangalore (which was nearby) to get a mechanic. Susu accompanied him, since he knew his way around Mangalore.   Khoj and I soon started having the call of the nature. We went to a nearby secluded area and got it done behind some shrubs. We cleaned up with some leaves, and were soon as good as new. We looked around and saw that the van was actually parked in a very beautiful area. It was the beginning of a ghat section on the road towards Kudremukh. Mootta was still sleeping inside the van, when we decided to hunt for a tea shop. When we came back after the tea, Mootta was nowhere to be found. Soon enough we could see him running down a nearby hillock, with his camcorder. Seems, he had woken up to see the van stopped by the roadside and nobody to be seen around. He had climbed the hillock to see if he can spot us anywhere, through his camcorder's zoom lens !!!   We started playing cards on the road. The passing motorists were all staring at us. We had played for almost two hours by the time Susu and the driver came back with the mechanic. After some pushing and starting we were on our way again.   We soon reached Kudremukh Iron Ore Company Ltd. (KIOCL). We saw a huge dam constructed to contain the affluents from the factory. Even then we could see what this factory was doing to the fragile ecology of the area. We were not allowed to take photographs. But we did sneak in a few.   We took bath in a stream nearby. We didn't stay long in the water because we soon realized that it was polluted.   The only disappointment was that there was no proper trekking to be done. The actual Kudremukh was around 100 km further. We decided to call it a day, and returned back to Bangalore.

       Trip :   Kanva Dam   Places Visited :   Kanva Dam   Dates :   31-Dec-2000   Vehicle :   Bikes   Bajaj Kawasaki Calibre(Kuruvilla), Hero Honda Splendour(John), Hero Honda Splendour(Sonu), Hero Honda Splendour(Sushen), Hero Honda Splendour(Vivek), Suzuki Samurai(Kannan), Suzuki Shaolin(Manesh's friend), Suzuki Shogun(Aneesh P U's friend)      Participants :   Aneesh(Pringani), Aneesh P U(PU), Dennis(Kudiyan), Girish(Annan), Harsh(Prav), John(Machan), Kannan(Chetti), Krishnakumar(KKB), Kuttan(Aneesh's Cousin), Manesh(Nair), Naushad(Naushi), Praveen(Paratta), Praveen's Cousin, Sangeeth(Aliyan),   urlLink  Sanjeev(Khoj)   ,  urlLink Shibili ,   urlLink  Sreepad(Pad)   , Sujith(Mootta),   urlLink  Suresh(Warri)   ,   urlLink  Sushen   , Vivek(Ambi)    Report:  This New Year's eve trip was the best bike trip we had so far. 11 bikes carrying 21 people. It took a while to arrange everything. As usual Mootta was in the forefront arranging things.    We had completed the  urlLink Kemmannagundi Trip  just a few days back. Even then, everybody was looking forward to this one as a sort of New Year Celebration. Naushad had come down from Bombay to visit us. The final head count came to 21. Thankfully we were able to muster enough bikes to go with.    Though the place was only about 60 km from Bangalore, we started early. The 11 bike parade was really a thing to see.    When we reached Ramanagara, Warri came fast on the Shogun and reported that Naushad (riding the Shaolin) had fallen behind and we should stop. Warri went back to investigate. The Shaolin had seized and Naushad was pushing it to a nearby workshop.    We were waiting in a shade when Warri and Naushad came back. The rest of the way was covered in 10 bikes, with the Shogun carrying 3 people.    We reached Kanva Dam soon. The place was not worth the effort. There was no place where we could wade into the water. It was a real and proper small dam.     Some of us took our bikes beyond the dam, to get a glimpse of the rural life around. We came back soon.    During the ride back we stopped somewhere between Channapatna and Ramanagara, and slept for sometime under a tree.

       Trip :   B R Hills   Places Visited :   Shivanasamudra,   M M Hills, B R Hills   Dates :   Some time in Mar-2001   Vehicle :   urlLink  Tempo Traveller    Participants :   Daiju(Koilu), Dennis(Deeku), Dinkar(Dinkan), Kannan(Chetti), Sangeeth(Aliyan),   urlLink  Sanjeev(Khoj)   ,   urlLink  Sreepad(Pad)   ,   urlLink  Suresh(Warri)   ,   urlLink  Sushen     Report:  This happened sometime in March 2001. Nobody remembers the exact date. Who would, when the trip itself was planned on a Friday night at 11:00.  It happened like this. After the  urlLink Kemmannagundi Trip , we had not gone anywhere for a long time. On a particularly hot Friday night, Khoj and I decided to call the other trekking enthusiasts and go for a small trek somewhere. Nobody had mobile phones back then. The only mode of communication was to go and meet the guy personally atop our trusty two-wheelers.  Thus Khoj and I started on my Hero Honda Splendour. We went straight to Aliyan's house in Murugeshpalya to muster up people. Aliyan, Warri, Chetti, Deeku etc. were engrossed in a movie. Our intent forgotten, we too started watching the movie.  Once the movie was over, I explained the reason for our sudden appearance etc. Chetti jumped at the idea. I suggested calling a van and leaving then and there. Chetti and Warri pushed off to Chetti's office to browse for a suitable place. We went back to our Koramangala house to get Pad.  After collecting Pad we went straight to Chetti's house. We were surprised to find, the normally lazy, Dinkan and Koilu there. By then Warri and Chetti had found a place (Shivanasamudra, M M Hills, B R Hills) and had telephoned a Tours and Travels company (which he found in the net) and had arranged for a Tempo Traveller. This was our first association with Prerana Tours and Travels, Jayanagar (Phone: 91-80-2664 2223).  Soon Aliyan and Deeku arrived and we started by 4:00 am Saturday morning. When we told the driver the destinations, he was reluctant to go to B R Hills, saying that the road was bad. He took us straight to Prerana Tours and Travels office. The proprietor, Mr. Sudhindra was all apologies and arranged another vehicle. The driver was Mr. Ramesh, a real nice and cooperative chap.  Thus finally we were on our way by 6:30 am on Saturday. We had lost some 9 hours as well as a lot of sleep.  The first stop was at Shivanasamudra. The Cauvery was at her best that day. At first, we went to the hydel power station located a few hundred feet below. Initially the people there were reluctant to let us in. But Ramesh, talked for us and we got into the lift to descend towards the power station.  We saw many Francis Turbines running with a huge roar. Well, it was almost like the way, our teacher Prof. Ramaraju had explained in his Hydraulic Machines class, way back in 1996.  After getting back to the van we went to see the twin waterfalls, Barachukki and Gaganachukki. The descend to the base of the waterfalls was quite tiresome. Chetti and Deeku managed to get close to the waterfalls and had a nice bath. We sat in a rock nearby and meditated in silence.  The climb back up, as expected was strenuous. Thankfully, there was tender coconut water ( Ilaneer ) available on top. We drank our fill.  The next stop was M M Hills or Male Mahadeswara Hills. The abode of the great God Siva. But except for the temple there wasn't anything to see there. We had tea in a tea-stall by the side and asked the shopkeeper for things to see around. He explained that it is better not to venture into the jungle as the dreaded sandalwood smuggler Veerappan was sighted in these jungles a few days ago.  We did not need any more persuasion. We started straight-away for B R Hills. It was already dark and a few kilometres later we stopped near a stream to have a camp fire. The season being dry, without much effort we were able to get a fire going. In the mean-time many of us went into the bushes and unloaded. We washed ourselves and set about enjoying the fire.  We took rooms in a hotel in Chamarajanagar. Being the district headquarters, Chamarajanagar was a decent town. Ramesh was our translator everywhere. Also he insisted that he be allowed to sleep in the van. We agreed.  The next day morning we set out for B R Hills ( Biligiri Rangana Betta  or  Biligiri Rangana  Hills). Here too there was a temple right at the top of the hill. Ramesh took us directly to the temple. We wandered around the temple for some time. There was a sheer drop at one side of the temple compound. From there Chetti sighted another hill which was almost as high as the one on which we were standing. Reluctantly we agreed to go down to the base of that hill and trek.  Ramesh must have been bewildered to see us getting off on the roadside and amble off into the jungle. He promised to meet us at the same spot a few hours later.  We crossed a small farmhouse and entered thick jungle. The going was really difficult. At times we had to stoop and walk for almost 100 metres. Well, all this trouble came to a naught as we promptly entered a well-tarred road. We could as well have asked Ramesh to drop us here.  Exhausted, we decided to eat the bread and jam we had brought with us. Thus rejuvenated, we crossed the road and started climbing again.  After many sightings of tiger turd (Aliyan, the walking encyclopaedia, told us so. God knows how he figured that out) and enlightened quotes from Deeku (like "This whole forest seems to be an area" ) and continuous whinings from Dinkan and Koilu, we finally reached the summit. Exhausted most of us fell asleep.  By 5:00 in the evening we started our trek back down. Lazy Dinkan did not want to move. It was after much persuasion that he got up and got going.  We lost our way somewhere in the middle and ended up a few kilometres away from our starting place. Seeing a tea shop, we decided to have tea before walking down to the van. Thankfully, not seeing us at the starting spot, Ramesh came further down the road and met us at the tea shop. After many stops at different roadside dhabas we finally reached Bangalore, early Monday morning.

       Trip :   Honnemardu   Places Visited :   Honnemardu, Jog Falls   Dates :   08-Mar-2003, 09-Mar-2003   Vehicle :   Tempo Traveller   Participants :   Chandan, John(Machan), Kannan(Chetti), Kuruvilla(Kuru), Manesh(Nair), Sangeeth(Aliyan), Sonu, Sudeep(Robo),  urlLink Suresh(Warri) ,  urlLink Sushen     Report:  Most of the regular members of our usual trekking gang had gone onsite. Still we were able to muster up enough people to go for a trip to Honnemardu, a serene spot nestled in the catchment area of Linganamakki Dam across Sharavathi river.   urlLink The Adventurers  is a non-profit organisation, involved in the conservation of Western Ghats and the ecologically fragile region of Honnemardu. Bookings have to be done in their Rajaji Nagar office at least two weeks prior to the planned visit. Normally, weekends are heavily booked.  Warri and I set out one day to book the date and also to pay the per head per day charge of Rs.500. After a long hunt for the house and lots of whinings from Warri (There was an India-Pakistan cricket match that day), we finally booked 08-Mar-2003 for 10 people.  We booked a Tempo Traveller from Prerana Tours and Travels, Jayanagar (Phone: 91-80-2664 2223) as usual. The driver was Mr. Umesh.  We started on a Friday night. The way to Honnemardu was beautiful. Shimoga district was lush green even in the summer season. By Saturday morning, when we woke up inside the van, we saw that the road was covered with dense fog. When it cleared, we could see the beautiful countryside.  On reaching Honnemardu, we were greeted by a volunteer of  urlLink the Adventurers . He asked us to form a circle and briefed us on the etiquette and the activities. First we were asked to complete our morning ablutions and use the nature for our you know what.  The breakfast was served then. It consisted of a simple upma and chutney, but was very delicious. We were taken to the water after that. We donned our life jackets and plunged into the water. The sun was hot, but thankfully the water was still cold. We spent an hour swimming, playing frisbee in the water etc. Kuru and Warri were a little reluctant at first, but soon joined in the fun.  After some time, the volunteer came and asked us to lift and put two coracles in the water. The coracles were made of fibre. Being a round boat, it requires a lot of knack to steer it. We learned it the hard way. At first the boat kept going round and round. Kuru, Machan, Sonu, Robo, Aliyan and I got into one while Chetti, Chandan, Warri and Nair got into the other with the volunteer. Owing to a bad start and strong wind we were way behind and in a race to a nearby island we finished a whole five minutes late. The island was bare and it was difficult to stand in the soil, thanks to the over energetic sun. Moreover none of were wearing any footwear.  We soon went back to the mainland. After lunch, we were told to rest for some time in a small house atop a hillock.  In the evening we again donned our life jackets and went to get the coracles. We went to the main island to pitch camp. The first job was to collect some firewood, while it was still light enough to see. Afterwards, we went to the waterfront in the opposite side of the island for more watergames. The Linganamakki dam was very much visible from this side. We watched the sunset sitting atop a rock enjoying the cool breeze.  When the night fell, we went back to the camp. The tent was already pitched by the volunteers. It was a sort of permanent tent with thick poles and stuff. I think it is not dismantled very often.  The volunteer taught us how to make a decent fire in criss-cross fashion. The bigger logs are kept at the bottom and the smaller ones on top. The whole contraption caught fire very easily. It reminded us of the numerous times we had wasted kilos of paper and litres of petrol trying to light a simple roadside fire.  We sat around the fire and sang some songs. By this time food arrived and was served. We had our fill and lay down to sleep. Though the tent was available, all of us lied down in the open. It was one of those rare occasions when you feel euphoric. Lying down staring at the stars in the sky, with a cool wind for company.  The next day morning we rode our coracles back to the mainland. Inspite of our very valiant efforts (like getting a headstart of about 5 minutes), the other coracle soon overtook us. We were debriefed in the mainland. Umesh was waiting for us with the van.  We went straight to Jog Falls. It was a big disappointment. India's tallest waterfall was all but dried up. There was a trickle of water falling down from one of the four main waterfalls Raja, Rani, Rocket and Roarer. But apart from that nothing.  There was a flight of steps leading to the base of the falls. Chetti wanted to go down have a bath in whatever water was available at the bottom and come up. The committee immediately conevened a meeting and vetoed the idea. (The Committee consists of all practically minded members, which automatically excludes Chetti).  It was at this precise time that a guide approached us and offered his services. He said he will show us 4 points which included a place to take bath. We jumped at the idea.  He first took us to the opposite side of the falls, to an old and abandoned bungalow of the British era. There was a good view of the river from this side. He went on talking endlessly about how big the waterfall is and that it is the tallest waterfall in the world. Seems  urlLink Niagara Falls  comes only second to this. We wanted to point out that Jog Falls with a height of 253 metres is anyway not in contention for the top spot and that  urlLink Niagara Falls  with a height of just 51 metres doesn't come anywhere in the picture. The tallest one, Angel Falls being a whole 979 metres high. But we kept quiet.  Then he took us to a small hanging bridge and told us that this was the second point. There was nothing to see in it. Well, a hanging bridge is a hanging bridge. We got fed up and asked him to take us to the place where he said we can take bath.  This was an ok place. It was more like a canal cut for irrigation. But it had ample water to accomodate all of us. We frolicked for some time and decided to go back.  On the way back, Umesh told us that there was a wild life sanctuary at Tavakkare, which was on the way. We decided to see some tigers for a change.

       Trip :   Muthathi   Places Visited :   Muthathi   Dates :   02-Feb-2003   Vehicle :   Cars   Maruti Suzuki 800(Renjith), Hyundai Santro(Kuruvilla)   Participants :   Dinkar(Dinkan), Girish(Giriannan), Kuruvilla(Kuru), Rajesh(KP), Renjith(Koothu), Sudeep(Robo),  urlLink Suresh(Warri) ,  urlLink Sushen       Report:  The regular holiday-makers Khoj and Pad were in Canada and USA respectively. Chetti and Aliyan had some urgent work at the office. The Electrical gang comprising Anumod, Sunil etc. refused to come on such short notice. So on the Sunday morning, there were only 9 people assembled in our Koramangala house, the usual starting point of our trips. There were 3 cars available. Dinkan's Maruti Suzuki Zen, Kuru's Hyundai Santro and Koothu's Maruti Suziki 800. After a toss it was decided that only Koothu's and Kuru's car would be taken for the trip. Why waste petrol ?  Initially the trip was planned to Bheemeswari. There is a Fishing camp on the banks of Cauvery at this place. We took the Kanakapura road from Bangalore and proceeded towards Bheemeswari. Koothu's car had Girish, Warri, Koothu and me. Kuru's car was full with himself, KP, Robo and Dinkan.  There is a small ghat section when you approach Bheemeswari. The road here is very bad. We stopped quite a few times to enjoy the nature's beauty and also to check the tyres.  There was a huge gate at the entrance to Bheemeswari fishing camp. The guard stopped us and asked for tickets. We took out the cash to purchase tickets. But it seems we get the tickets only at  urlLink Jungle Lodges and Resorts Ltd.  office in Bangalore. So there ended "the Bheemeswari Trip" which was quickly converted to "the Muthathi Trip" at the guard's advice.  6 kilometres ahead was Muthathi, where you don't have to pay to visit the Cauvery. It was in a proper rural setting. We saw many people doing pujas etc. We went to a secluded place and sat for sometime. The river at that part was not very clean and also deep. So nobody ventured into the water.  By noon we were hungry and went in search of food. There was guy by a small roadside stall, who agreed to make rice and sambar if we wated 15 minutes. After about an hour, we got food served in plates made of dry leaves. We had a tough time controlling the watery sambar from flowing into our laps.  We walked to another part of the river after the lunch. We heard people talking about two guys who drowned an hour ago. I went and asked a decent looking person, as to what had happened. He explained to me that there was a drowning incident before their very eyes and that the police has been called. He was a college lecturer and had come with his students on excursion. Hearing that I hailed from Kerala, he pointed to two of his students who were bathing in the river. I talked to them for some time and went back to my friends.  Nothing more to see in this place and already having decided not to take bath, we started our return journey by 4:00 pm.

       Trip :   Ranganathittu   Places Visited :   Kokkarebellur Pelicanry, Ranganathittu Bird Sanctuary, Balmuri Falls     Dates        :   28-Sep-2002, 29-Sep-2002   Vehicle      :   Bikes    urlLink Enfield Bullet 350 (Vishnu),  urlLink Hero Honda CBZ (Sailesh),  urlLink Hero Honda CD100SS (Jayaraj),  urlLink TVS Suzuki Fiero (Manesh),  urlLink Yamaha RD350 (Suresh),  urlLink Yamaha RX135 (John),  urlLink Yamaha RX135 (Jomy),  urlLink Hero Honda Splendour (Sushen)   Participants :   Jayaraj(Mastan), John(Machan), Jomy, Kannan(Chetti), Manesh(Nair), Sailesh(Aila), Sangeeth(Aliyan),  urlLink Sanjeev(Khoj) , Shyamesh, Sonu, Sudeep(Robo),  urlLink Suresh(Warri) ,  urlLink Sushen , Vishnu         Report:  This trip came about mainly because we had not done a bike trip for a long time and also because Jomy had bought a new bike and he wanted to complete the run-in period fast.  I had read about a place called  urlLink Kokkare Bellur , which was around 86 km from Bangalore. This place is a famous nesting ground of the migrating Pelican. Not that anybody had any interest in bird watching, but we decided to go there.  The plan was to start very early, at around 5:00 am. As usual, everybody was late and we started at 6:00 am from Bangalore. Chetti climbed behind Vishnu in his Bullet, in the hope of getting a ride. That he did not get one, is another story. Warri was alone in his RD350 and Jomy was alone in his brand new RX135. Nair had his brother Shyamesh riding pillion. Machan and Aliyan climbed into Machan's RX135. Aila had Sonu behind him in his CBZ and I had Sanjeev for company in my Splendour. Mastan and Robo brought up the rear in the CD100SS.  We took the fly over to reach Mysore Road and rode on. Every half an hour we stopped for Jomy to catch up. He could go at a maximum speed of 40 kmph only during the run-in period. Even Mastan could do more than 40kmph in his dilapidated CD100SS.  We stopped for breakfast at Channapattana. There were major performances from Vishnu and Aila. Vishnu ate around 10 idlis. After breakfast we continued to Kokkare Bellur.  Kokkare Bellur was a small sleepy hamlet. Apart from a few boards cautioning visitors against destroying the nests of the migratory birds, we found nothing. Then we saw the old ladies of the village pointing at us and laughing out loud. When we asked them they said, "The Pelicans have flown back long ago. If you want to see them come back next year".  This was too much for everybody. Though there wasn't a single bird lover in the gang, everybody started pointing accusing fingers towards me. I had to think quick. I suggested visiting Ranganathittu, another famous bird sanctuary. Thankfully everybody agreed.  We asked for directions and started towards Ranganathittu. Mastan had some work back in Bangalore and he went back. Robo continued the journey with Jomy.  According to the local people, Ranganathittu was only about 20 km from Kokkare Bellur. We learned otherwise the hard way. By the time we reached Ranganathittu, we had already driven 198 km from Bangalore.  There was no way we could ride back and reach Bangalore at a reasonable time. We opted to stay. We went to Balmuri Falls nearby, had a nice bath and rented a few rooms in a Bungalow turned Motel.  The next day, we got up by 6:00 am and drove back to Bangalore.

       Trip :   Kodaikanal   Places Visited :   Kodaikanal   Dates        :   13-Oct-2001, 14-Oct-2001   Vehicle      :    urlLink Swaraj Mazda    Participants :   Anumod, Daiju(Koilu), Dinkar(Dinkan), Jayaram(Kotharam), Manesh, Sanal(Gowda), Sangeeth(Aliyan),  urlLink Sanjeev(Khoj) ,  urlLink Shibili , Sonu,  urlLink Sreepad(Pad) , Sunil,  urlLink Suresh(Warri) ,  urlLink Sushen     Report:  This was certainly not a trek. This was more like a pleasure trip.  Some guys in our gang weren't so used to the idea of roughing it out. When we related our experiences on top of Kumaraparvatha, to them, they balked at the very idea. To satisfy them we had to plan a slightly less adventurous trip. The obvious choice was Kodaikanal.  This was the grandest trip in a way, considering the number of participants. There were 15 in all. Anumod and company had landed from Bombay a couple of months back. All of them on a permanent transfer. This meant that we cannot go by our usual  urlLink Tempo Traveller . So we had to hunt for a slightly bigger vehicle. We settled for a  urlLink Swaraj Mazda  from Jet Tours and Travels.  We were supposed to have started at 8:00 pm from Bangalore. The van came almost 3 hours late. We had to swallow a cock and bull story about a tyre puncture. Nevertheless we started the trip in high spirits.  As usual we spent some time in a dhaba for our dinner and proceeded. Soon we were in a bad traffic jam on the Hosur Road. The driver started sleeping immediately. We woke him up and asked him to take a shorter but slightly damaged road. He did that and as soon as we re-entered the main road, he stopped the vehicle and started sleeping again. By the time we reached Kodaikanal it was 5:00 pm Saturday. We had lost one whole day.  We took a dormitory with 15 beds for the night stay. That was a wonderful experience. It was like college days. Guys started playing cricket inside the dorm. Gowda even managed to break a window.  The next day we visited Cocker's Walk, Suicide Point etc. Really boring places. Very crowded too. Koilu and Dinkan liked it though. This was their idea of a trip.  After a very uneventful trip we started back on Sunday evening.

       Trip :   Kumaraparvata   Places Visited :   Kumaraparvata   Dates        :   30-Jun-2001, 01-Jul-2001   Vehicle      :    urlLink Tempo Traveller    Participants :   Chandan, Kannan(Chetti), Manesh, Sangeeth(Aliyan),  urlLink Sanjeev(Khoj) ,  urlLink Shibili ,  urlLink Sreepad(Pad) ,  urlLink Suresh(Warri) ,  urlLink Sushen   urlLink     Report:  This happened in June 2002. We started from Bangalore at around 8 o' clock on a Friday evening in a  urlLink Tempo Traveller  from Prerana Tours and Travels (Phone: 91-80-2664 2223).  Ramesh, our driver was an excellent guy. He drives fast but without taking unnecessary risks. This was our second trip with him.  We stopped at a road-side dhaba, for dinner, and then got back into the van and promptly dozed off. By the time we woke up at 6 in the morning, we were in front of Subrahmanya temple.  Probably, our driver had thought that we were on a pilgrimage to the Subrahmanya Temple. He looked surprised when he saw us donning our trekking gear and heading for the nearest trekking trail.  We had two  urlLink beach tents  with us, which we had hired from Woody Adventures (Phone: 91-80-2225 9159). One was squeezed into my backpack and the the other into Chetti's. Though these were light weight tents, it certainly added weight to our already full backpacks. No wonder, Chetti and I were lagging far behind during most of the climb.  We had read some article written by guys who had done this trek earlier. We were to aim for a place called 'Bhattara Mane' (Bhat's Place) first, spend the night there, and push for the summit the next day. Since we all had become 'soft' by easy city life, the climb was really hard. Also, this was reputedly the toughest trek in Karnataka.  It was rainy season and the forest was wet, which meant we had to fight the  urlLink leeches  too. This was our second brush with the blood thirsty worm. (Previous one was at Thusharagiri in  urlLink Kozhikode, Kerala  during a trek in our college days). Shibili was frantically jumping and running in front of me to escape them. We coould not even stop for a few minutes to catch our breath, because the leeches would be all over us by then. After some time we realized that the best way was to ignore them. Ignore the squishy feeling inside your shoes. Ignore the blood running down your calves. Move on.  The dense forest around us started thinning down after some time. We reached some sort of an open space. Khoj and I were bringing up the rear for most of the trek. We saw the others waiting for us in a clearing. We were slightly piqued at them for not having stopped earlier. It seems Nair heard, what he 'interpreted' to be, an elephant's call for its mate.  Nair and Warri set of again ahead of us. Kannan and Chandan also resumed climbing. Pad, Shibili and Aliyan started as the third group. Khoj and I waited for some more time to nurse our leech related injuries, before joining them.  Nair was literally running ahead of us. Being thin and wiry, he had lot of stamina. Warri was also not far behind.  After what seemed like an eternity, we saw Kannan on top of a rim. He shouted saying he had found Bhat's Place. We went straight to Bhat's place, removed the shoes to let out the remaining leeches, downloaded in the nearby forest and had a bath in the ice cold water of a nearby pond. By the time we came back, food was ready. Never before had we realized that simple rice and sambar could taste so heavenly.  All of us swore that we will not climb the rest of the way. We had had enough for a trip. It had taken us more than 5 hours of back breaking climb to reach Bhat's place. Interestingly Chetti too swore the same.  With instructions from Mr. Bhat, we pitched our tents in a leech free area. Chetti, Chandan, Nair and Shibili entered the first tent (the family tent) and Warri, Aliyan, Khoj and I entered the second tent (the bachelors tent). Pad was left stranded in the middle. He tried clmbing into ours but we pushed him back and finally he had to take refuge in the family tent.  Supper was also arranged by Mr. Bhat. The menu remained the same but the taste was even better.  It rained heavily in the night, but we were safe inside our tents and sleeping bags. The family tent was a little cramped. Of course, it was meant for 3 people.  The next day, Chetti, Chandan and Nair woke up early to climb the rest of the way. Chetti came and called us. He heard 6 sleepy but determined 'NO's from 6 sleeping bags. Chetti went back dejected but nevertheless started climbing with Chandan and Nair.  The moment Chetti was out of sight the 6 of us jumped up and set about enjoying the day. We had very cleverly managed to save most of the food materials from being eaten by Chetti. After the morning's downloading, (Unfortunately Pad and Khoj had their Downloading act captured in film), we started eating the bread and jam and mangoes and oranges that we had painfully toted up.  We climbed some small peaks around and took photographs. Mostly with jam-smeared faces.  By noon, Chetti, Chandan and Nair came back and we started our climb down Kumaraparvatha. Shibili announced that he will never leave "civilization" for another trek like this. But there never was a trek till this, which we enjoyed so much.

       Trip :   Kudremukh   Places Visited :   Navoor, Tolali, Kudremukh(Well... Almost)   Dates :   28-Sep-2003, 29-Sep-2003   Vehicle :    urlLink Tempo Traveller    Participants :   Aneesh(Pringani), Anil Krishnan(Kanchan), Deepak, Jomy(Pattalam), Kannan(Chetti), Sandeep(Sangeeth's Brother), Sangeeth(Aliyan),  urlLink Sanjeev(Khoj) ,  urlLink Sreepad(Pad) ,  urlLink Suresh(Warri) ,  urlLink Sushen     Report:  After the hugely successful  urlLink Kodachadri Trek      we were dying to go for another trek, before the rainy season got over. The place was already in our minds. After the disappointment of the Kudremukh leg of our  urlLink Kemmannagundi Trip  in late 2000, we were determined to conquer the actual Kudremukh.  Chetti found a page " urlLink Trekking Kudremukh " by  urlLink Manoj Kummini . Though he was from my hometown of Shoranur in  urlLink Kerala, India , I did not know him. Anyway, Chetti contacted him through mail and he gave us appropriate directions. Chetti went and bought the required maps from  urlLink Survey of India  office at Koramangala, Bangalore.  We were all set with snuff powder (as a defense against leeches), maps, cameras, trekking shoes etc. We decided against carrying tents as it would hamper our trek, and also because there was a place caled Lobomane in Tolali where we could stay. Lobomane or "Lobo's house" was a house made by Simon Lobo, a priest who made the Kudremukh ranges his home. He was described as an 96 year old man in a  urlLink report  by  urlLink D. Nagesh Kumar , then of  urlLink IISc, Bangalore , in November, 1988. By the time  urlLink Manoj Kummini  did the trek in late 2002, Simon Lobo had passed away. Lobomane was under a caretaker called Shankar then.  We expected to see Shankar in Tolali, who would then arrange our accomodation. The plan was perfect.  We started on a Friday night as usual. The Tempo Traveller was arranged from Prerana Tours and Travels. Deepak had to be in office till 12:00 in the night. So we decided to have our supper at Hotel Empire in Shivajinagar, Bangalore. Kanchan was also having night duty in office. He joined us at the Hotel. After supper we collected Deepak from his residence at Infantry Road and were on our way.  There was a slight difference of opinion on the route to be taken for the trek. Most of the people were in favour of taking the Samse-Tolali-Kudremukh route which was shorter. But Chetti managed to persuade everybody to take the Navoor-Tolali-Kudremukh route. We reached Beltangadi, by Saturday morning. After breakfast, the driver took us to Navoor where we planned to hit the trail. As soon as we got down, we met a forest guard who asked us to get tickets from the Forest Office at Beltangadi. Without tickets nobody was allowed inside the forest. Khoj, Warri and me went back in the van to get the tickets.  When we reached back, we saw a jeep with the forest officer and some guards talking to the others we had left behind. The officer asked us to get some food if we planned to stay the night and warned us that Shankar is no more there at Lobomane. Even though we said that we have carried some, he forced us to go and get more food. I think he was a little suspicious of our intents. Anyway after what seemed like an eternity, we were able to start our trek.  Initially, Khoj, Jomy, Deepak and I were lagging behind. Soon others were out of sight. We saw a shortcut to bypass the winding road and we took it. Though the climb was laborious, we made it to the road again. We then realized that there was nobody ahead of us and that the others were actually behind us. They finally caught us up. But poor guys, they thought that we had found the trek too strenuous and had gone back. They waited while Warri and Pringani ran down almost half a kilometre to see if we were alright. Not finding us, they had started again.  Kanchan was at the end of his strength when we finally met. When the others started, Khoj, Deepak, Jomy and me, set about reviving and remotivating Kanchan. We fed him almost half a packet of glucose. We soon started again and soon Kanchan and Jomy were out of sight ahead of us.  We again met the others when they were waiting for us at a clearing. Though the initial part of the trek was leech free, now they were everywhere. We set about cleaning our feet and started again after some time.  By this time the mobiles also started getting signal. That was surprising.  urlLink Airtel  mobiles were all working. Thus, though we were lagging behind, we were able to maintain contact.  We had climbed almost 13 kilometres with no sign of Tolali. Everybody were at the end of their strengths and nerves. Chetti was getting all the blame. Soon the rear gang of Khoj, Deepak and I got a message saying that Tolali was in sight and was only 1 km away.  We soon reached the spot, the night was almost upon us. All we had to brave the night were some plain balnkets. No tents, no Shankar. Since it was impossible to find our way back, we decided to stay atop the small hill nearby. We could see Lobomane and Simon Lobo's grave nearby.  We collected some firewood and with great effort lit up a fire. The limited food availble was rationed out between the 11 of us by Warri. With the fire going, we all laid down and snuggled close for warmth. Sleep came soon.  Almost all of us were woken up by about 1:30 in the morning. A real icy wind must have done it. We were shivering all over. I could hear Aliyan's teeth chattering. The chattering, once started, took almost a minute to die down. The blankets covering us were wet from the dew. We were seriously in mortal danger here.  When the first rays of Sun started appearing in the horizon at about 5:45 in the morning, everyone breathed a huge sigh of relief. We had successfully done it. Not the peak, but a night in Tolali, out in the open, in the rainy season.  Chetti suggested attempting the peak. None of us except Kanchan were ready. Finally, two of them started towrds the peak, while the rest of us stayed behind to enjoy the day. Sounds familiar ? Check out the  urlLink Kumaraparvata Trek .      We took a few photographs, visited Simon Lobo's grave etc. Some of us like Deepak, simply slept.  We had to start our descend soon. But Chetti and Kanchan was nowhere to be seen. Chetti hadn't taken his mobile too. We decided to start by 11:00 am. Keeping their bags in our camping spot, we set about collecting the wastes of our camp. It was not for nothing that we had learned "No trace camping" from "The Adventurers" in Honnemardu. (Read about it in our  urlLink Honnemardu Trip ).  Precisely at that time the forest guards appeared. They were sent by the forest officer we had met yesterday, to check on us. We showed them our entry passes, and told them that we are leaving now. We also asked them to keep an eye on the bags of Chetti and Kanchan. Of course we did not leave anything valuable inside that.  The way down was led by Khoj. He was literally unstoppable. Deepak and I fell behind as usual. Towards the end we found a stream, with a small waterfall. All of us took a leisurely bath and washed away the blood and leeches from our legs.  We found the van waiting for us at precisely the same spot we had left it yesterday. We decided to go to Beltangadi town and have some food.  After food, we came back to Navoor and waited for Chetti and Kanchan. By 4:00 pm they arrived. Seems, even they did not quite conquer Kudremukh. Kanchan was too exhausted to continue after an hour, so Chetti had gone alone and had reached within 200 metres of the summit. Well, with nobody to verify his claims, we had to accept it.  After Kanchan and Chetti had food in Beltangadi, we started our return journey.

       Trip :   Kodachadri      Places Visited :   Kodachadri, Sarvagna Peetha   Dates :   12-Jul-2003, 13-Jul-2003   Vehicle :    urlLink Tempo Traveller    Participants :   Kannan(Chetti), Sandeep(Sangeeth's Brother), Sangeeth(Aliyan),  urlLink Sanjeev(Khoj) ,  urlLink Sreepad(Pad) , Sudeep(Robo),  urlLink Suresh(Warri) ,  urlLink Sushen      Report:  The beauty of this place is past compare. Chetti was the first one to bring forth the idea of doing a trek in Kodachadri. The time was July. Perfect with rains and leeches and lush green forest. We decided to do it.    Chetti's friend Sandeep had given him directions as to how to reach the place etc. As usual we started on a Friday night in a Tempo Traveller from Prerana Tours and Travels. The driver was Mr. Nagaraj. The trip upto was uneventful. Our plan was to reach a place called Karakkatte Gate by 9:00 in the morning on Saturday. But due to the enoromous time wasted by visiting every eatery on the way (Thanks to hoggers Chetti and Aliyan), we were late by almost 2 hours.    This time we were prepared for the leeches. The  urlLink Kumaraparvatha Trek , though done two years ago, was still fresh in our minds. We made some saline solution and applied it all over our feet. This was supposed to protect us from leech bites.
