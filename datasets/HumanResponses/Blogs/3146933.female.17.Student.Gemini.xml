      Well, I decided to try this thing instead of Diaryland. Why? Because I'm bored. I wish I could see Zach right now! Yeah, ZachWillis and I have been going out for a couple days now..he's great! He came over last night and watched a couple movies with me because I'm still grounded. Today makes it exactly a month since I got grounded :/ It sucks, but he understands. Monica's in New York right now :( I'm  supposed  to be there!! and yesterday omg she got to see  Good Charlotte ! Oh I love them! I was going to go to Zach's game today but I wasn't ready in time so I decided not to go late. :( So far..this Spring Break has sucked  so  bad! To tell the truth, I'm about ready to go back to school! Pretty sad huh? Anyways, so the insurance ppl call about my car and they just decide my car is totaled after all...which really makes no sence..b/c it wasn't before..! lol whatever but I'm gettin a new car soon I think..not sure what it's going to be...but hey I just want something to drive b/c I'm goin  CRAZY  not having a car! Stuck at home..bumming rides off ppl when I can get them...But I think I'm about to wait on my guy to call me and see if we can do something today... I

      Went to watch "the day after 2moro" w/ monica last nite and it was pretty good. it's scary but pretty good. my birthday's 2moro. i haven't talked to matt since graduation night. i didnt get to talk to him in person but since i didnt then i called him and told him i'd give him his graduation money later if he wanted to come by and get it. so i guess i'll be seeing him again sometime soon. i hope. i want to. it doesnt really matter though i guess. i love him but gah this is drivin me crazy. im not sure what to do. omg and lemme tell you. *some1* was msgin me last nite and it was CRACKIN me strait up. "i'm seein little green goblins. is that healthy?" whoa that scared me a little but after a while he jus started crackin me up so bad i didnt care. he was outta it really. but anyways...i dont think i need to say anything about that. he knows who he is..and dont you try flying off 2 story houses either!! ...if he reads this. haha. Well, I'm going to go watch a movie. My bday's 2moro and I better have something to do. If I don't then I'll take u up on that offer Brad..if I can anyways. movie. that's where I was headed. . . . . .I'll write 2moro maybe. :) *Please God, let 2moro be flat out GREAT!!!*

      hmm...what's happened? A LOT. Lemme tell you. I was prayin for who knows how long that Matt would hug me memory day and after that, I'd get to hang out with him at least. It happened. I was so scared to go up to him at the memory day thing and so I was like right behind him and I looked at Adrienne and I was like "i can't" and she tapped him on the back and pointed at me! lmao! omg! and he hugged me...i cried so much that day. I started cryin  SO  bad when Matt's pictures came up on the screen..that was the first time I cried...then I finally got calmed down after a few minutes and then Monica's pictures came up and I didn't expect to see my pawpaw but she had a pic of her and him on there and omg i broke down again..ugh so sad. then a pic of me and her when we were little :D we were so cute. and holdin hands in our lil dresses. but anyways, ok..yeah it was terrible. It was too sad..I wouldn't go thru it again. But at least Matt hugged me, it made my day. Anyways so I get home and I talk to Matt and we're not doin anything so we do somethin together. It's like we were never even apart...well ok kinda. We talked a lot. He's crazy. I love him with all of my heart, still. I'm out of school. Today was my last day. English exam? freakin hard. Math exam? freakin hard. I hate exams. But anyways, so I'm a senior now. One more year. It's sure gonna fly. My birthday's Monday *excited* I hope I see *matt*

      "I'm twisted 'cause one side of me is tellin' me that I need to move on On the other side I wanna break down and cry" "Sendin' pages I ain't supposed to Got somebody here but I want you 'Cause the feelin ain't the same Find myself callin' *him* your name" "why are we Strangers when Our love is strong Why carry on without me?" "And everytime I see you in my dreams I see your face, it's haunting me I guess I need you baby" I have *2* days left of school. Memory day's comin up. Gah I'm so scared...I'm debating on whether or not I'm even going to go to it. I almost cry thinking about it. Ok and if I haven't run into Matt...like 500 times a freakin day...here lately anyways. It makes me SO mad. I see him...every freakin where I turn. But I'm scared about givin him his graduation gift. Man, I don't know what to think...I swear. I have *someone* tellin me one thing and other people telling me different. I have mixed feelings right now. You know though..I want Matt to talk to me memory day...because...he spent 1/2 of his time in high school with me. I don't know what I'm going to do if he doesn't...I won't be able to take it. I'll try though..talkin to him. I guess I dont want to get back with him...since he'll be goin to Alabama and I'd never see him anyways, but I really wouldn't mind being friends with him. I'll always have feelings for him though. any guy i've talked with/dated/gone out with since me and him broke up..they haven't made me as happy as what matt did. Oh well I don't feel like talking about him. Memory day. Yes...OK when my class, the juniors get up to take our place in the senior section..dear God, I'm going to bawl. I remember wishing every day away and wishing I was out of school and that I was a senior...well...it went by too fast. It's here now. My last year getting things "handed" to me. It's a scary thought.. Happy 18th Birthday Monica!

      Well, it's Sunday. I think I start off every post I do on Sunday's like that though. I got my car! My new celica...Friday. It's just like my last one...good thing b/c I missed my old one :( ! But yeah and it feels right b/c I was drivin a jeep and i felt so high up and now im back down on the road like i should be. :D! The most AMAZING thing happened to me the other day. I talked to Matt. No, I mean conversation. He talked to me too. Like...we're friends. Do you have...ANY idea how great that felt? It felt great. I miss him. I got a graduation invitation from him in the mail and..I cried for an hour after i got it :/ . B/c I was already missin him before i got it and then after i got it, i was just..so confused..? It's weird. But I wanna do somethin for him for graduation. I hope he'll let me. Or at least get him something. I don't want him to move off without seeing me at least one more time..you know? I'll always love him! I know he's got to always love me too... Anyways, but yeah and these other guys that I was thinkin about 'talkin' with or whatever..no..they either try too hard to get me to like them, or they're immature, or they're boring, or ... there's just always something. I just don't want them I want Matt. Ok. If I do not sound pathetic. I know I do, and I'm sure you're thinkin the same exact thing...but I really don't care what anyone thinks. I can't help it! for some reason i can't let go of him, even after what happened when we broke up. but I'll try... I have 7 or 8 days left of school. then I'll be a senior...last year...it kinda makes me wanna shed a tear. but what they hey! Time sure goes by fast..

      Well, it's Saturday. I'm sick..I have been since yesterday morning! It sucks. I'm coughin my head off and sore throat. Yeah..it's suckin. But I'm really excited. My dad got me another celica. same as my other as far as I know. I think I have to get a job though. :( Not that it bothers me too bad...considering I'm not ever doing anything anyways. Ok let's see...we have 13 days left of school I think. GOOD THING! I miss Matt. Yes, Matt Harding. You know? It's weird. Everyone was telling me "hey you need to date other people, you dont need anything serious while in high school"...well i don't care. I miss him so much, we were together too long for me just forget him..I can't and I won't. Couples have their ups and downs...and their break ups and stuff...PLEASE let this be a bump in the road! I'm not going to try to talk to him and get him back, I've done that before. I'll let him go. I know that's what he wants...I think he likes the whole dating thing better anyways. I love him with all of my heart still though. If there was...ANYTHING in the world I could do to get him back, I'd do it. I'd die for Matt. I don't want to be with anyone except him. I'll love him more than anyone, always. and if he wanted me back, I'd go with him quicker than anything. I don't care that he's going to Alabama, I'd stay with him, hoping to see him any time that I could. I want to be his so bad. omg and that song BURN-USHER..yeah I cry everytime I hear that song. I'll pray everyday that something happens and I get to be with him. I'd be the luckiest girl in the world. He means more than life to me. I know I love him, if he loves me back and it's TRUE love, I know I'll end up with him one day...no matter how long. But if I don't end up with him, i know it's not what's meant to be.  Ok, I just felt like writing about Matt. I love him with all of my heart.  -alicia

AH! I just wanna say I love them! I heart them! They are...the best guys! I'll hopefully be hangin with them a lot more soon. I'm glad Brad isn't moving to Hville in a way. He lives down my road. I would miss him :( ! Zach called me last nite b/c he hadnt talked to me in a while lol...well..since my bday. I thought that was nice. I think he still likes me ;) ! I saw *him* the other nite again.  hmmm "do you miss this?" HEEEEEEEEEECK YEA I DO BUDDY! lmao! anyways ok...so my dad may be movin to Pensacola, and I think I'd like that b/c I'd like goin down there! woo hoo! maybe Panama City but doubt it.

      Last night was great. Anyways, I hope I can hang out with Brad Wednesday because I feel bad for letting him down all those other times. And Forrest. Poor Forrest, I want to see him too. I hate how much he's workin now! grr! :) Hopefully we'll still get the chance to hang out though. They're so great. Let's see....did I mention anything in my last entry about *him~? Probably not. Because I hadn't talked to *him~ in quite a while. But it was still great. Well, dad's just about done with the tanning bed. I'll be glad when I can use it. I'm so light and I wanna go fishin with Brad and whoever sometime but I refuse to do it unless I have a LITTLE tan at least. I've gotta go walking too. I'm gonna gain weight sittin around here on the computer all the time and eatin every few minutes. lol. So, I guess about almost half the summers gone by and I've done nothin. Things better start lookin' up. alicia

      If my life isn't just stupid sometimes. I cannot wait til I'm 18. Seriously. I'm talking to Monica, Adrienne and Brad right now. I love them. They are so my best friends in the world. I'm so bored though...but at least I'm at mom's right now. Went to the drive-in with Monica, Mom, Kenneth, Kristi and Tori. Rode with Monica and got in trouble b/c I wasn't supposed to be with her that night. Long story but oh well. Maybe I'm not grounded. Who knows? I stay grounded. I wish I was perfect so I wouldn't :/ *sigh* but oh man. I had some fun today at least. I got to have my senior pix taken and I got them done at Classic Portraits. I say..everyone should get theirs done there. The woman that takes the pics is so nice...and her sets are so pretty. She has like, everything. I hope they turned out as good as Monica's did. I got new glasses too tho..they're cute. They make me look smart..lol..ok I so don't have any exciting news..or well any news at that..so I'm off I guess...to talk to monica and brad...I love Monica and I heart Brad. alicia

      "You don't remember me, but I remember you. I lie awake and try so hard not to think of you. But who can decide what they dream? And dream I do... I believe in you. I'll give up everything just to find you. I have to be with you to live to breathe, you're taking over me. Have you forgotten all I know and all we had? You saw me mourning my love for you and touched my hand. I knew you loved me then. I look in the mirror and see your face if i look deep enough So many things inside that are just like you taking over me."  Nothing's happened the past couple days. Brad came back today. I missed him actually...we have these late night conversations about these random things and I missed that...having someone to talk to and get their opinion on things.  I've been trying to get my dad to let me go to Orlando with Monica and Jessica and Chasity or Kellie...but he's so not budging. I don't think he trusts me. But oh well. I've never been drunk and I've never done drugs/whatever and I sure don't plan on it. I just wanna head out and have a couple girl days...dude that'd be so much fun. If I can't go this year babe, you better believe next year it'll so happen. Ok now, hookin up with some guys and walkin around/riding with them/dancin at this club with them..heck yeah you better believe I'd be doin that! But that's not bad at all. I could possibly meet some guys that live there and get to know some people you know. But I dunno. I mean I wouldn't do that if I was with Matt. Speakin of Matt...I didn't talk to him for about a week/week n a half...and he msgs me 2nite. dude im so freakin happy you dont even know...he asked me if I wanted to see him 2moro nite. well i dont know lemme see what i got planned ok yea it's def. on! :D I love him yall, I really do. Only God knows how much I really love him. I guess it's how this first love thing goes though. We weren't meant to be and I'm gettin that...I do like hangin out with him sometimes though. It's good to keep in touch and talk n stuff. He's a great guy and whoever ends up with him's gonna be lucky ;) But I'm tired. ZzZZzzzzzZzzzZzZZZZ

      Ah. well, it's been pretty good I guess. Lately. The past couple nights I've jus been hangin out with Monica. Man, Friday we went to hville and it was pretty fun, but when we got back..yes..to sboro..we had more fun. lemme explain. well we end up on the phone with bradsmith and hes like 'yea andrew's girl's up here talkin to some dude n has been for the past hour' so me and monica and amber ride up there and sure enuf...possum is talkin away to some dude. Ok so Derek, I love him, derekpage forrestwilliams and coreywilson all ride up to where we are and freakin video tape it. hilarious. so anyways and then wrylandreed robbievalentine and i think it was botaylor come up and we're all followin her to the square b/c of course the dude she's talkin to leaves...so yeah 4 cars followin her. but we end up losin then and i had to be home at 11:30 neways. sucked. but it was fun while it lasted. she was mad.  2nite was ok though, me and monica met bradsmith at the park and we talked a while and walked his dog Booger around. Monica, it's not BUGER lol. She kills me. but then he left us :( and we went to watch Shrek 2. that was funny. then we rode around and there were cops up at the square lookin around and stuff again so we were like forget that and i came home. here i am on the computer. im bored and tired so im goin to bed.  oh, btw, i dont know what the deal is with matt. i love him though. gnite.

      Oh my GOSH! I cannot stand this one guy. It seems like he does everything he can to make me mad about things. ESP Matt. Well you know what? I really don't care right now. If MATT is "talking" with Leslie then whatever...let them talk...let them watch movies...I talk and watch movies with other guys too...what's the big deal? Talkin and watchin movies doesn't mean you're in a serious relationship. Oh he has me shakin and cryin right now. I cant stand guys sometimes. bleh i feel sick. I'm talkin to matt...and I jus found out a bunch of stuff that has been makin me mad isn't even true...go figure. "hey! lets be 18 and act 10!" *rolls eyes* Man, I'm startin to hate most of the male gender...lol...that doesn't sound good. I'm seriously..debating on moving to Florida. Seriously. One condition being we move close to my cousins...I'm sure they know a lot of good people and they could help me get comfy down there. They're like 18..or 19..around the same age as me anyways. But yeah livin in FL would be pretty cool...I've always wanted to live there again..kinda..at least i'd be further from matt....i love him. God, I love him. remember to dl Ares

      Me and Monica ended up goin to that Christian concert up on Skyline mountain(?)!! When we got to Dustin and Patrick's church to meet up with everyone...we were gonna ride with Patrick. Brandon was in the front with Patrick and then in the middle was Monica, me and then Dustin...and then this guy named Greg was just gonna sit in the back...where there's like..no seats but one of the women wanted him to get out b/c they thought Patrick would get in trouble...SOOO me and Dustin ended up ridin w/ Dustin's mom on the way down there...and that Greg dude took our seat!! :( When we got there...oh Lord...it was HOT...me and Monica only brought a blanket to sit on...BIG mistake...the ground was still a little wet from the morning rain and our butts got wet...haha..but it wasn't too bad b/c other ppl's butts were wet too from sittin on blankets too :D hehe! Anywho...this girl and her bf wanna sit on the ground for some unknown reason and they gave me and Dustin their chairs...*thank them!* and so that was better. Once it got darker...it was much much better...and cooler...but yeah Dustin was all holdin my hand again..*sigh*...it was sweet...SOOO on the way back...we rode with Patrick...and that Greg dude rode with someone else that lives close to him. Aw and Dustin was all holdin me and stuff...and Brandon was on the other side of me...lol..oh my..he kills me..and Monica sat up front with Patrick. So anyways, it was a good time... :) MUAH!! yeah baby! I talked to Brett when I got home...I guess he was a little tired though b/c when my dad called...he got off the phone with me :(.... ugh. dad. yeah. he calls FREAKIN out and yeah he sure did ground me....I won't EVEN get started on that. Dad's ghey. I'm tired. Goodnight.

I was ready a little earlier than I was supposed to be so I got Patrick to just come pick me up here first before meeting Amber and Dustin at the bottom of the mountain. Ok so I do like Dustin. He's soooo sweet and he's really funny. Anywho, we went to Applebee's to eat and I got cheese sticks lol. Didn't eat all of them, but close enuf...Then we went to watch Spiderman 2...aww and Dustin was holdin my hand...that movie was pretty good...had some "Whoa!" moments...can't wait til the 3rd one comes out! *smiles*...Kisses!!! :D Monica had&nbsp; a bad day...and I feel really really bad for her...I hope she gets better...:( I heart her! I have a class with Adrienne so far! Like... I have...1st block with her...should be a lot of fun...we didn't have a class together last semester... :( But I'm thinkin bout changin my schedule. I talked to Brett a little while today...on the computer...only&nbsp;a&nbsp; few minutes though..and I read his blog...aww he mentioned our dog dying..:( it was really sad...I was on the phone with him when I found out and started cryin...he doesn't care though... :) aw...well I heart you Brett, you're a great friend!

      :D !! The last two days have been so great! Aw ya'll I really think Dustin is sweet. The night before last, Patrick and Dustin called me and wanted to come over but mom was goin' to bed soon so I told them I'd have to come outside to talk to them...so they asked if I wanted to jus go with them and get some food. Sooo I did. It cracked me up so bad bc when they got here, I got in the back and Dustin was like "Do you want me to drive and you sit up here and make Patrick sit in the back?" I looked at Patrick with an evil smile and said "yeah sure!" lol he was like *hmph* :D Dustin's so great! I haven't known him long at all either, but I know I'll like him more and more if I keep hangin' out with them! Well, when they dropped me off, they wanted to know if I wanted to go to church with them the next day..Wednesday...and I said yes...and I told them if Monica couldn't go, thennnnn I'd have to have one of them pick me up. They said that was perfectly fine.  Anyways, Monica comes and pix me up for church Wednesday night and we sit with Dustin *smiles*. Patrick was mostly on stage playin' guitar. They usually have some youth service but their teacher wasn't there so we went upstairs anways and they talked about some trips they're takin' soon. Saturday they're goin' to some thing. I don't even know what it IS and Dustin's mom (the one talkin' to us about the trips) asked who all was goin' and Dustin had her put me and Monica on the list when we don't even know if we can go yet! I'll have to ask mom and Monica's gotta see if she can switch hours. *sigh* lol he's so crazy! He's like "if ya'll can't go we can always scratch ya'll's names out"! *smiles again* He really wants us to go though. And they're goin' to Six Flags, August 5th! He wants us to go with them there too! lol.. Six Flags WOULD be fun though. I'll see if I can go...but I'm not sure if I can or not..depends on if we have enough money for me to go. I hope I end up goin'....I'll be sad if I can't..*frowns*! Anyways, after church, me and Monica watched their band practice...they are so good...I love the way they sing and some of the songs they sing crack me up ;) !! Well, after they practice...we go outside and stand at Monica's car and they all start writin' on her car hahah!! It was funny!! BUUUT it upset me! B/c Dustin wrote "Alicia likes Brandon" I was like "noooo Alicia likes Dustin!!" oh, aww! I was standing on Monica's car..like on the side where the door is opened and he was standin' behind/beside&nbsp;me and he had his hand on my back and I just thought that was so cute b/c I was about to fall offa there :0 !! Patrick finally went over to Monica's side and wrote "Dustin likes Alicia" on there and I was thinkin' "ahh! thank you!" ;)&nbsp; Ohhh no. And the other night...I don't remember where this was but I wrote "Dustin is hot" on Patrick's window and it was still on there last night and Patrick showed it to him! haha I said..."Patrick! now you KNOW you wrote that" He knew I was jokin' and that it was me *smiles*... Well, we're going on our double date tonight. Hope all goes well. For me and Dustin.

      I just got off the phone with Dustin! Well, here's what I know. Me, Dustin, Patrick and one of Dustin's best girl friends are goin to the movies Thursday. We were gonna go in Fort Payne, buuut I think he said Patrick wants to play putt putt and that's fine with me b/c I love love love playin! I used&nbsp; to go all the time and I haven't been since my family + matt went...so obviously a long time. Anywho, Dustin's settin Patrick and this girl up on a blind date. Oh my.  Well, I'm starving to DEATH! I haven't had like..any food all day! :( Buuut moms gone to Krystals now. I will totally devour that food once it gets here.  I was gonna try to go hang out with Brad today but when I got up I had to help mom with somethin and I think he had some other stuff he had to do. *shrugs* It's never gonna happen. Made me mad/sad at first but now it kinda cracks me up... I talked to Adrienne and Brett a little while today! Adrienne is hatin bandcamp more than Brett is...Brett's just like "whatever" and Adrienne's like "AHH I can't stand it!" lol I love her. She kills me.  My food's here, so on that note...I'm gone. Anything that needed to be said, will have to wait :D

      Sittin here lissenin to Yellowcard's "Ocean Avenue" and Three Days Grace "Just Like You"...I love those songs. Wow...last night was great ya'll. Patrick Hall asked me and Monica to come see their band play at their church...Section Church of God...they did SO great! And...their dramas...oh my gah...they were great also. Patrick, for real. They were awesome! So...Patrick wanted me to come so I could meet Dustin Bailey! He's from Section of course...and he's in the band too...and so was this guy named Brandon and Brad Smith (he's from here..the one in my grade) and some Chris guy. They're all cool. But yeah, back to the Dustin deal. I know a lot more than I'll say buuuuuut Dustin was cool. and hot. very hot. and he's TALL!! lol! He's like 6'7''! and I'm 5'3'' so there's a big difference in height but...since when does height matter? :D&nbsp; Monica said she saw Dustin mouth "Friday" to Patrick....I won't assume anything but I hope he meant he wanted to try to see us Friday again! wow, you guys don't know how happy I am! I'll try to keep updates on what happens with that. Brett called me last night and he's not happy about goin to bandcamp AT ALL...which reminds me, I need to start chargin my phone now&nbsp;so he can get ahold of me on bandcamp break. :D He's supposed to let me know how that's goin.

      Most of today was slept away. Seriously. I got up at 2:45 and then took a nap later...at like 5:30 and slept til 8. Lazy day eh? Not much happened today...been on the computer a lot...I think I missed the computer just a little too much.  Jessica B's gettin her hair cut Tuesday and so...she's wantin it kinda like mine so I'm goin with her to help her out! She's goin to the same woman I'm goin to too! Should be fun! Talkin to Patrick Hall right now. Hopin' Monica and I can go watch his church do some dramas and sing some! He's wantin me to meet this Dustin guy that's in his band. Said he's freakin 6'7!! Whoa! Tall guy! But they're best friends so he's gotta be cool! Soooo I agreed!  Brad is so crazy! I was watchin him on his webcam tonight and he crax me up! He'd like start bustin out laughin at these random times...I love it. I hope we can hang out soon. Brad is just...great. No...I didn't forget. I talked to Brett a lot today...since I'm home, he can call my home phone and I don't have to wait until freakin 9 to talk on the phone to people! lol! grr!! He's upset that band camp starts Monday. I would be too...band camp sucks..and I'm not even in band. *sigh* I'm ready to get schedules!! I hope I can change accounting...I heard it sucks. I'm a senior. I want easy classes!! :D hehe! And I'm ready to get the last year outta the way! Buuuuuuuuut anywho...I'm off to bed!...more sleeping...like I need it. *rolls eyes*

      Been in Pensacola.&nbsp; I drove my car down there which wasn't too bad...I followed dad and Josh Killian followed me. He's gonna be workin with dad down there. Pretty cool...he's a nice guy. Keeps rubbin in my face that he'll be 21 August 30 though and so I'd like to punch him in the face for that! lmao! but nahh really. he's cool...I think Dylan messed around with him a LITTLE too much...but Dylan's like that. Pretty annoying most of the time. I had fun while we were out...didn't get to go out much though b/c dad works from like 6:30 in the morning til from 4-8 every nite. But he does have Sunday's off! So...Sunday...we all loaded up and went to the beach...was lots of fun. Got a little burnt...but that's what happens when you stay in the house all the time..never get outside..then all of a sudden head to the beach in a bikini and stay there for hours. But it's ok. As long as I get a tad bit darker from it, it's worth it.  Oh   Oh ...mad is what I am   right   now. Far beyond MAD...let me tell you why. My dog, Furball..yeah..the people that were lettin us keep him...came and got him AND his dad, Choco, while we were gone on our little vaycay. I will get him back, if I have to get a job and pay her for the thing, I'll do it. I love him so much...I walked in the house today and I'm&nbsp; so used to him runnin up to me and waggin his little tail and try to jump up on me...he's so cute...and he sleeps with me and follows me around everywhere...but not anymore...and it makes me really sad...I just cried about it.  Anyways. Brad took Laura Page to H'ville this week while I was gone. It upset me when he first told me but whatever...I mean we AREN'T anything at all. There is no "us". I can't get mad over stuff like that...can I? I shouldn't. Considering some things that I won't mention. So all I have to say to that is....Whatever. *he* wants to see me...what am I going to do? See him probably.  I talked to Brett a lot while I was down in Pensacola..he's the only one that cared enuf to call and check on me! lol! We talked for like 4 hours one night...long time huh?  Anywho, I'm off to bed...pretty tired...ridin' in a car then van from Pensacola to Scottsboro with 3 kids is...horrible.

      So...I know for a fact that Brad is mad at me about something. Well, maybe not mad but upset with me or whatever. He is not being nice to me...at all. I just wish I knew what I did to him...to make him act this way towards me. And...I wish...that we could hang out more...I'm so tired of wishing that it'll happen though. If he still wants to hang out more when I get back from Pensacola, hang out more is what we will totally do. I like Brad. He's a ... pretty cool guy. ;) Brad Brad Brad... I saw *him* tonight! Aw, I was so excited. He'll miss me...he said so himself. :D Wow, I feel loved. Really. *HUG* I'm going to Pensacola here in a little while today...pretty excited. I hope I get to go shoppin' and meet people (mostly guys!) while I'm down there...be nice...but whoa..I really need a tan. Very bad. Anyway, we get schedules soon...I hope all goes well with that. Oh and we need to get my senior pix portfolio! Ahh! *excited*...well I'll write more later maybe..I'm pretty tired. That is..if I can get to a computer down in Pensacola! :O :D

I had to get Adrienne to still go b/c she was gonna go with Tristan but...he was too sick to go out so she was upset..but I told her she'd still have a blast with us and I think she did :)..I'm glad she still went. Aw, I love her and I hope things work out for her and Tristan. I do feel bad b/c Erik Burkett wanted to go with us and he couldn't..but that's a long story.. :). We all laid on Adrienne's cover she brought...lol..was pretty big..and just looked up at the sky...I love the end of the fireworks..the last ones .. you can always FEEL them...it's so great.

      I have no clue what I've been doin the past couple days. Oh well. I do remember...dad came down Monday and he was here for a while...I helped him some...we switched cars so I've got my celica back! *Smiles major big!* That's a great thing. Being stuck at home without an option sucks. Anyways, aw, I love my dad. He let me go to Six Flags with Dustin and Patrick's youth group Thursday! I spent the night with Monica Wednesday night and I could NOT sleep. I was tossing and turning all night long! Every time I'd get comfy, I'd wake right back up. I don't know what exactly the deal was there. Sooo I got an hour or so of sleep. Got up at 4:30 and started gettin ready b/c we had to meet them at their church at 6:30. Wow, and I'm glad I woke up at 4:30 b/c Monica set her alarm for 4 and I guess she turned it off...Just...woke up..*shrugs* lol. We wore jeans and a sleeveless shirt under a t-shirt. Good thing. Oh boy. Our mornin started off....crazy. Ok so we leave and had some odd minutes to get there...we get down the road and she got gas...then..she realized she forgot her pillow...so she had to back to her house and get it...omg so scary...we were tryin to hurry. anyways..on the way back to her house...she looks over at me and she says "Oh God, Alicia, PLEASE dont move, PLEASE" and I was like "monica..what's wrong. what is it?" and she said "oh please dont move, i'll tell you but please dont move whatever you do" and I wa slike MONICA JUST TELL ME...IS THERE SOMETHIN ON ME?" she says "nooo please dont move please" and i was like "Monica, is there somethin NEAR me?" and she was like "oh GoD, Oh God, i'll tell you but stay where u are.." so it turns out to be a grasshopper and we pull over at the next store we come to..she freakin FLIES outta her car .. so do i tho and i go to her side and hit it out with her shoe...and some guy that was there came out to see what the deal was b/c we were so loud and he was crackin UP at us...LOL I would too tho so it's ok. Soo..on the way down there...I sat with Dustin..pretty cool.. :) I really got to know more of the people on that trip! Like...Sammy Aplin...he's so great yall...and Matt Brown...he's pretty cool too :) and Cody Elrod I think? and let's see..hmm..Josh Newman...Ashley Newman...and a bunch of other people but I'm thinkin that's the only ones that I hung out with the whole time..:D  *marquita says hey* So anyways...we get there and it was   SOOO   much fun but   SOOO   hot! Me and Dustin...we held hands the whole time...aw, so cute!  lol...the Batman and Superman rides were GREAT...when we rode this water ride..oh GOD...gross..there were these 2 girls..they were like...14 or 15 and they were freakin makin out. and I was like...NASTY. When we got off...we had to walk by them and Monica was like..."..and they stand there makin out and it's SOO nasty, that ruins my daY"  and I was like..yeah mine too. Anyways, I wont' say anything else about that but yeah the guys made me mad. *sigh* Guys. Dustin was def. sorry :D aw haha. But anywho, the day was great...rides and all...then at the very end...it started POURING down with rain :( *tear* I mean, we had like 45 min to an hour left and it rained that bad..GRRRR my hair got soaked and it was wavy and doin all this weird stuff and i just got mad and stuck it up in a ball and i was like.."if dustin doesnt like it he can get over it" buuuut when we got to the bus finally....and i sat with him he was like "you're so beautiful" and i was like "uhhh even when i look like this" and pointed at my hair...and he was like "I wish you looked like that more often" ;) how sweet. I look cute even when I look crappy. Aw, and when we were walkin back  to the bus in the rain...Dustin and Patrick ran off and left us...and...Sammy came to us and said he wouldn't let us walk back by ourselves! Sweet huh? He's really nice. Me and Monica played cards a couple times on the bus b4 we got off 30 min later and ate at Micky's! It was sooo funny..they were like orderin from the drive thru and they weren't even in a car! Oh gah..Dustin kills me.  I fell asleep on him a couple times but someone always woke me up :( but it's ok. I think me and Monica went...right to bed when we got to her house. :D...long day! More later?
