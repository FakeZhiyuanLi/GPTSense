After that we went to the Biltmore mall, and ate @ Chick-fil-A. And after that we walked around 4 a lil bit. then we dropped off Jared and picked up Justin @ the Musselwhites, and on the way home Mr. Musselwhite let us put in tobyMac, and we like put up the bass like all the way! it ws soo awesome! And then we didn't go 2 church on Sun cuz it ws snowing, and i did some work 4 my dad on the internet. fun! lol and 2day i did skool and kicked the soccer ball outside. that ws interesting! the ball like "floated" on the ground. but ne way. i g2g ttul!

      Hey peoples! 'Sup?!  yesterday i got these dvd's 4 soccer, an they're called "Soccer Secrets" or sumthin like that....but ne way, they're pretty cool. they like teach u diff techniques an stuff like that. i watched em 2day, an they've got like a music video, and Mia Hamm does this really cool lookin kick. it ws really neat..but ne way...O yeah! an the Panther's played an AWESOME game last night! the end score ws 29-23. they played against the Rams, and man. It ws sooo cool. they went in2 2 OT. It ws so funny though, cuz the panthers, in like the first OT tried 4 a FG, and Casey missed. So the Rams got the ball an then they tried 4 a FG, an chris ws so sure that they were gonna get it...but they didn't. It fell short by like a couple of feet or somthing like that. Then the Panthers got the ball back an they got a TD. It ws an awesome game. An the Patriots beat the Titans like 17-14 i think. and the Packers r playing the Eagles 2day. I hope the Packers win...well i g2g cya l8r!  Amber

And I'm gonna get rid of my guestbook. If you guys wanna write or w/e...just do it in the comments. Cuz I'm gettin tired of that guestbook...lol. So neway. I've been workin a lot. It's a LOT of FuN! lol oh oh oh guess wut? I went and played b-ball 2day w/ some guys from Chick-fil-A and Ed and Chris. It was a lot of fun...even though I can't play b-ball worth crap...lol sry. But there wsn't a whole lot of people there; only David, Jimmy, Chris, Ed, Andy, and me. So it ws 3 v3 . I missed like all my shots. oh well.

        Hey guys! Im back from soccer camp! yeah! omg that camp was soo awesome. but it totaly made me realize that im not really THAT good at soccer...i mean i have soo soo much stuff i have to work on. like my dream is to play on UNC's soccer team...but that kinda got shattered there. or at least it got a lot farther away...meaning im gonna have a lot of work 2 do in order to get good enuff. but it ws so much fun and i learned so much. UNC's really weird. I mean like its so spread out. its not like some other campuses i've been to. like all the buildings are kinda all over the place. but its nice too. and i got this really kool t-shirt there. it says "its a tar heels world" on the front and then on the back it says, "i dream of a world where there are no blue devils" and there's this pic of a little baby and he's got this face that looks so hopeful, and he's got his hands clasped in a prayer! its so cute! or at least the pic is. and i got a new soccer ball too. it looks neat. and im gonna get new cleats sometime soon too. cuz mine are gettin too small. And marissa gets to play soccer for faith!! yeah!!! thats soo awesome! we're gonna have an awesome team this year. i can't wait! k well hey i g2g..ttul!!  Am,ber

        Yo yo! Wussup!?  We had the yearbook signing party the other day...and it ws really kool. We played soccer and it ws the bestest game we've played in a long time. I think its cuz marissa was there. dude girl, u rock! and man becky! you were doin awesome too! I think ur gonna do awesome @ faith! oh yeah, and my mom talked to Miss heidi, and she said that lacy, starla, and some other people are going to be there still, and that Stephanie and Erin B aren't gonna be there...which really sux cuz that means we don't have any goalies. Which is really bad. But we're gonna have some good offense! Specially if marissa plays. girl u gotta get your mom to let you play..hey i know...I'll send her an annonimous e-mail saying that she's gotta let you play...lol. Well hey i g2g 4 now...ttul!  Amber
