      "First post, huh?" you sit back in your chair and (if, in fact you can) you raise an eyebrow suggesting, dance for me monkey. I've put many minutes of thought into this, So that raised eyebrow? You can call that off...many minutes.  As you know, I am associated with pop/beat group,The Tyler Trudeau Attempt( http://www.geocities.com/tylertrudeau  ) stationed in New Haven, CT. Yesterday, we had our first practice with our new drummer. He seemed to catch on quite well and the Sprite he had on hand, while flat, was indeed a moving gesture. We went through a couple of songs numerous times and I found myself playing automatically giving me the freedom to day dream.   Through a link of thoughts I can't seem to connect now, I found myself wondering what I'd look like in a tri-cornered hat.  Fantastic! , I thought. I looked over at Tyler, sweating, much like his goodwill Sprite. Tri-cornered hat?  Yes. Fantastic, as well.   I'm not really all that fashion conscious but I realized, maybe such a fashion statement would be an object of ridicule. For instance, go to any corporate/financial district around lunchtime and you'll see a few men wearing one of those 1940s hats. Probably bought on a whim while visiting Quincy Market, in Boston. It sat in the corner on his closet for years and, sure he'd try it on while his wife was away shopping for brassieres (I'm not really sure what wealthy women do with their free time so sorry if I sound a bit misogynistic) and imagine wearing it to work one day. As he walked into the foyer, "Nice hat, sir!" the security guard would say. "Hey, you got it, man! Twenty-three, skidoo!" the guy at the news stand would say. "   As he walked into his office and he asked if their were any messages, his secretary might find it hard to catch her breath. "That's all right Malora, I'm dark, complicated, and lead a mysterious life far more interesting than anyone in this corporation figured...as suggested by this hat I bought at Quincy Market. You know, they have a replica of some famous boat there. Maybe sometime if this crazy, topsy-turvy world would just loosen it's strangle hold on the likes of us we could go there to see that famous boat...no, I don't remember the name of it, I didn't get to see it. For you see, this hat was calling me."  Soon enough his wife would leave him for a man who could provide her with more mad-money to spend on wealthy people things like buttermilk and brassieres. That's when the hat makes it's first actual appearance. Maybe guys like that, in their depression of finding they will die alone, delude themselves into thinking their hats really cast off that shadowy loner feel.  Maybe they think it sets them apart somehow. Maybe the tri-cornered hat means the same to me. Maybe. I don't know...anyway in rock and roll you really have to watch out for statements like that. The presence of Redcoats at the clubs has been on the increase latley and I would NOT want to catch the business end of a bayonet just because they think I'm a constitutionalist. I love the stamp act, come on. It's my thing, you know? Or maybe it's about time to throw some stuff of this famous ship they got out on Boston Harbor. Seriously.  Night, all.
