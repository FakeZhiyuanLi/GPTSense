      Another short passage...let's see if this would work like yesterday....  " A genuine smile, a simple honest gesture. Everything about him seemed so real and pure. You could  amalgamate  him into a pool of scum, and he will still stand out bright. But she knows better than to trust a set of shiny white straight teeth. A good set of braces as a child will deliver such smiles. She stretched out her hand gingerly. He shooked her hand, firm but not overbearing. Confident and self-assured. Just like everything about him. Why is it not a surprise? Good things always comes in a full package, doesn't it? She was suddenly filled with a strong desire to throw his palm into the punch bowl by the table, just to  adulterate  the clean and honest feel on him. Yeah, its silly, but a girl can wish can't they? He flashed that pearly white smile of his again, mockingly this time, like he could read what was in her mind. She snatched her hand back like it was scalded and begin to fidget with her blouse.   "I'm sorry Miss, have I perhaps offended you?" "No, not really, I am just not used to handshakes, sweaty palms you see." "Ri-ight". And he made sure that every ounce of smirk went into that 1 word. Such  audaciousness ! He turns and walks away like she was merely a serving girl that worked at the party. Blah, insolent fool. If only he knew who she was. More correctly,  what  she was.   She walked towards a dark corner in the room.   'This is one reason why I have such  antipathy  towards humans, such a short life span and they think they know everything.'   'I would have thought after so many years, you would be feeling  apathy  instead.'   'Well, you've thought wrong. Where the hell are you anyway?'   'Here, next to you. Have you let a mere human so affect you that you could not sense where I am?'  She spun around and was staring straight at a small spider. She was not a fan of creepy crawlies, and the last she check, neither was he. So what was he doing in the form of a spider?   'Well, that's an  anomaly  for you. A bug? Debian, that is entirely not your style.'  He decided not to answer, she just hide her smile in the dark and kept her silence.  One of the usher stepped over to where she was standing and motioned her to follow him.  'Good luck kiddo, we are all depending on you'  She nodded once, took a deep breath and followed the usher. He motioned for her to step up the stage. She caught the eye of the Mr conceited pure smile and was extremely amused when she saw his eyes widened.  "Ahhh, Miss Maison, there you are. Come come, step right up. Don't have to be shy. The people here won't eat you up." She gave a weak smile and stepped up onto the stage.   'Goodness, was there always this many people Debian?'   'Yes, kiddo. Don't worry kiddo, remember, you could devour anyone of them if it caught your fancy.'   'Shut up Debian. You are not helping me. You know I don't hunt. Keep your  archaic  beliefs that shifter are hunters to yourself.'  She could sense his snickers as he settled down into his web to watch the show.  She cleared her throat and settle down to speak.  "Before I begin my presentation for the night, I would like for the spotlight to please shine towards the extreme left wall of this room please." Solaris could feel the rising anger searing through her mind as Debian tried to scuttled out on the way of the light. But the light was bigger. Debian was caught in the dead center of the light. Everybody turned around and stared at the little black spider in the light. Solaris could feel his  fervid  desire to hurt her at the back of her mind.   "There, ladies and gentlemen, is an example of what I am here to present. That spider that you see there is actually a shifter. A group of human with the ability to shapeshift into any living creatures."  Solaris could feel the fear from the audience  aggrandizing  as they stared at the spider.   "Debian, could you be so kind as to shift back into your form please?"  Solaris felt an inward sigh from Debian and felt the first strand of power that he drawn. The room was so silent that you could hear a pin drop. But what they were hearing was not pins dropping, but instead, tiny soft screeches emitting from the spider. Debian elected to have a blinding shaft of light emit during his shifting. That is entirely showy. But it also covers most of the painful lacerations that will occur during shifting.    'Debian, you need to  attenuate  your shifting, its a little too bright. Most of my audience are too busy tearing to pay attention. Besides, don't you think shifting with strong lights are kinda an  anachronism  already?'   'Shut up kiddo, before I shift into something that will slaughter the whole room..." "  I lost my drift.......how to write when you are restricted with the words that you have to use.... I am going to shower. At least I finished "A"s.

      I have to practise using GRE words in context. So just I will just blabber some short stories for the sole purpose of using GRE words. Those words are that big, long and seems like a total dictionary word will be GRE words. Vooty says I have alot of GRE words, so probably have to use alot of them in one passage.   Sheezzhh...I dont even noe how to start.....this passage is gonna be so fucking weird....   "As I watched him walk away, without once turning his head, I thought the pain washing over me will never  abate . Such a whirlwind romance, I knew I should have  abstained  from it, but I could not. Could not or would not? He said I was the one that took him out of the blue. I never even knew he was blue to begin with. I must have plunged him into an  abyss  now. I guess leaving him in the blue would have been better for him, and for me too. I am not an  advocate  for useless love affairs, but then again, every estranged love affairs will always be useless. I have been  antagonizing  over the decision for so long. Why should I even contemplate about this affair? By right, it should never have existed. I wonder if strong contemplation will  alleviate  the pain and guilt? I doubt it.   I turn back to the door to watch his silhouette fade down the street. Why is he walking so slowly?   The affair, if that is an appropriate term, had been totally  ambiguous . Nothing said, nothing agreed, nothing denied. It seems to be like an affair from some computer manual, wordy and useless. I turn back to the door again, is he still walking down my street? Gods, you would think he is  analogous  to an arthritis tortoise at the speed he is going. Major pounding headache I am having. I think I need advil. I wonder if advil can help to  ameliorate  the pain in my heart? Nah, I guess not. Well, it was worth a try, afterall, it is a painkiller isn't it.  I went back into the house. It's too quiet. And why is that damn wall clock ticking so loudly? If only I could  abscond  from this life, leave quietly and never to return to it. Nah, eternal hell seems too scary right now. I think I need something to cheer myself up with. The decor in the house seems  austere . Too much black. Perhaps its time to fluff things up. Pinkish perhaps? Yeah, while I am at it, I might as well shoot myself in my head first. Damn, I am depressed......"  I give up. I totally give up. That's all for the GRE words. Think I will write something later in the night. Currently, I lost all coherent thoughts.   I think first, I need to learn what is the difference between, noun, adjective, adverb, and verb. I can't seem to learn the difference. Such a cow.   Time to make dinner, hungry......

      When Monkey told me what happened to her, I was just in the passenger seat. I understand what she was saying and how she felt, but I couldn't relate to the extreme shocking effect.  Guess what, I found something last night. Some photos of his ex-wife and him. What hurt? No, its not the fact that he still has them. I have all the pictures with my exs. I am not so affected by the fact it exists. I am more affected by how he looked in those photos. They look so right together. Its a match. What affected me was how happy he looked in those photos. Recalling how he looked in the photos taken with me, yeah, he is happier 2 years back. How he held her in the photos. How he looked. How much his body langugage says what he feels. I am not an expert, but I think I recognize " Bliss " when I see it. His whole body language in those few photos was practically shouting " Love, Happiness, Content, Bliss " Heck, there is a beautiful woman next to me, me in my tux and having my luxurious wealth, I would be in a perfect look of bliss too. I don't blame the fact.  Will I ever succeed in delivering such happiness to him? Will I ever succeed in making him look so contented? Pure joy? I do not know. I do not think I would like to know. A picture paints a thousand words, how true.  I am supposed to be feeling happy. Because I am the one with him. But if you knew as much as I did about how he was last time, and the impact that his ex-wife has on him, you'll understand why I feel I am being backed into a spiked wall. Look, without even realizing, I have used present tense. " Has on him... "  Who am I kidding here ? You see a beautiful, matured, elegant woman in the arms of your fiance. You see the joys sparkling in his eyes. You see their arms entwined like the lovers in my tarot cards. Who am I kidding that I am not feeling defeated. Such an earnest look of love, for the woman in his arms. Am I here, trying to challenge that emotions that he has for her?  *Damn....present tense again...i will not change it...all these that i am writing is directly from my feelings and thoughts...  Am I trying to challenge it ? No. Believe it if you will. I am not. He loves  *AARRGGHHH...fucking tense . Let me rephrase, he LOVED her. Love that made him what he is. That made him the human that he currently is. Made him the human that I fell in love with, I am not trying to challenge it.  I am just trying to live with the self-inflicted pain that I am suffering from.  All the pictures we've taken. They never held so much joy. To speak the truth, I feel like I am coming between a pair of heaven borned lovers.  I know what everybody will wanna tell me. This is the past. It has past. Things have changed. I am who he loves now. I am the one he bended his knees to propose to. I should be feeling happy. My point still remains. I am happy. More than I have ever been. I am contented, and satisfied. I have finally found a person that could awaken such feelings in me. I am really contented.  But I can never forget their joy. Their love. What they have shared. It means so much more than anything that I could have given to him.  I feel empty. Having empathy is not working well for me currently. I would rather not be able to sense the joy and love behind those glossy photos. I would rather be senseless and dead. Doesn't pain numbs out after a while ? So why am I still shivering here? Why didn't he hide it away? Why let me find it in such a place. In his drawers.  Its so private that I feel like I have stumbled unto his deepest emotions.  Unlike most girls, I do not have the habit of nosing around and digging up dead skeletons of my boyfriends. I do not have the urge to flip everything over to examine his past. His past is what made him what he is presently. If I could love my guy for who he is presently, I do not need to dig his past, especially past love affairs.  But this one was found without even digging. I wasnt even trying to dig! I was grabbing a t-shirt when I saw the box. Which I asked what it is and he told me its his ex-wife. So I asked permission to view it. A normal photo, no matter how intimate, no matter how elegant or stunning the lady is, never really affect me so much more.  But the emotions does.  I am not even writing coherently. I am getting all jumbled and mixed-up. I am feeling a mess.  I dun even know what I wanna unload anymore. Everything is a bad taste in my mouth. Everything is hurting. My shoulders are hurting from being so tensed the whole night and day. My eyes are sore. My neck is stiff. My heart, realistically, is beating 2 beats too fast. Metaphorically, my heart is breaking itself up.

      I should be in Santa Barbara, be in school at this very moment. But alas, I am not.  I would be able to have anything that I want without working a sweat, but this is reality.  Ideally, nobody will have affairs. But that is far from reality is it? Affairs. I never did fear affairs much, since I was probably never really pain if I lost any of the guys that I used to date. But after Vootwerk, the word  "affairs"  scares the living daylights out of me.   I have been told many times, just keep one eye close in a relationship. Men will always have affairs. As long as he doesn't bring it home to the family, just close 1 eye. You'll have a happier marriage. I lost count how many times I have heard this being said. From men and women alike. For the men, are they just saying what they wish could happen ? Are they just telling me such advice because they are carrying the guilt of an affair? For the women that told me such, are they truly so brokened ? That they could live with themselves, knowing that the man they married is happily with another women outside?  Or is it simply, they have already learnt to live with the facts of life? Perhaps they are the wise ones. I for sure am not able to share, close one eye, live with pretense. I'll admit that there will always be an attractive quality about a man that is taken. I have done my fair share of breaking up relationships. But never marriage.  I never did enjoy being the 3rd party to a relationship. You dun get to have this guy, you know no matter what, his girlfriend will always be the one that has all his time and efforts. One guy ever did tell me, while we were dating, that men will dote more on his affairs. But of course, its newer, fresher. But for me, it still doesn't feel up the void that is left when the man is not with me, because I know he will be with his main girlfriend. Great, saying that, I suddenly feel like all mistresses are side dishes.  Another thing that I cannot understand is how men could return home, maybe after having sex with his mistress, and still be able to face his wife. How could he ever face her ?? Or himself ? Here is a woman that chose to spend forever with him, which he promised her as well. Yet as soon as a fresh piece of sweet ass walk past him, he is gone.  Mid-life crisis. 1 major reason why men have affairs. How is it that men will start to feel that they need to boost their ego at the age of 45 with a fresh young piece of meat ? Isn't it simply amazing that the same woman that has shared his bed for the last 20 years, still continues to shares his bed and adores him? Isn't that ego boosting enough? No. Apparently not. They need fresh meat. I wonder if it will help if the wife went for a whole body makeover, just to look 10 years younger for the husband. Nah, I doubt it. Most men that will defer to affairs for ego boosting, will probably never be able to endure if their wives suddenly look 10 years younger. They will loose their  reason  to indulge in younger cunts. How could they justify that they need a younger cunt when their own wife looks young?  I've always loved to ask the question, " why did you do it? " to any person that has indulged in affairs. The answers typically varies from a simple " i don't know " down to a long, often repetative, barrage of " she lost her feelings for me, she stopped loving me, she couldn't give me what I need anymore, she only cared for the kids, she nags too much, she controls me too much, we got married too young, it was a mistake...etc... "   EXCUSES!   For once I would like to hear a man come out and say " I feel in love, and I fell out of love. It was my mistake, my wife is a wonderful person, and she loved me with her soul and heart, but I was not strong enough to resist the temptation. "  Another thing that befuddles me....how could a person that kept his affairs a hush hush event, live with themselves for the rest of their lives? Given that they have already made the move to severed the affair, and is now 100% faithful to their spouse, live with themselves? They had an affair. The slate will never be clean. Its there already, whatever they have committed is already there. How could they return home daily, see their spouse, feel the love from their spouse, and not be torn apart by guilt?  I am idealistic when it comes to real love. Perhaps I still have a long road ahead to walk. Perhaps someday, I would be telling younger woman what the wise ones have told me, " Wake with 1 eye open, and sleep with both eyes closed. As long as he doesn't bring any of his affairs back into the family, just live and let live. "  Then again, for the past 25 years that I have lived with myself, I doubt that I can live life being half the person. So I say to Vootwerk, if he needs an affair, that proves that the love he has for me is dwindling. Do not cover me under thick fluffy blankets of lie, just expose me to the truth. I will leave. And move on.    I make the choice, I live with the consequences, I will pay the price.

      Went online to take quizzes during lunch time.... Here are some stupid "revelations" on me.    Your Heart is Blue     urlLink   What Color is Your Heart?      brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    Dunnoe, dun like this quiz... Next    Tomboy    urlLink   What's your sexual appeal?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    Ahhh...this one..i like..at least i see some part of a remotely accurate judge on who I am. :P   Last quiz...   You have a Lost Soul. No one is really sure what that can always mean, because it can be defined in many ways. As Legend goes, lost souls were the spirits of passed away people who are neither in heaven nor hell. They walk the earth, brooding mysteriously, always appearing when you expect it least. So hence, if you have a Lost Soul, then you are probably very insecure and shy. Stuck in your own little box, you watch the world fly by as a loner. You dont know your place. You seemingly dont have a place in society or an interest. You are a very capricious person, and are confused and frustrated about where you belong. You crave for the sense and feeling of home-but have not obtained it yet.    urlLink   What Kind of SOUL do you posses? (For Girls only) Incredible Anime Pictures!     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    Aww....I have a lost soul....my goodness....why am i suddenly lost ...  Just got a tattoo done to my back on Sunday. Will get Vootwerk to snap a picture of it tonight. It is pretty big. Sat through 3.5 hours of tattooing for the outline. I am now aching all over, my arms my back and my neck. It was so painful that I was not able to relax, the body just braced and tensed up. The result, 1 beautifully done tattoo outline and 1 extremely sore body. I feel like I just had a work out or something.  Till later...time to hit the books again

      Just saw in the news last night of a police chief son that is facing trial for having sex with a minor. A girl of under 17 year old. The boy is 19. This is the same boy that was considered "mistrial" for the GANG rape of an unconscious 16 year old girl. Reports have said that the 16 years old who was gang raped, was a slut and asked to be raped. She did have sex with 1 of the gang rapist in the previous night before the incident. Why she return again the next night, who knows? I cannot agree that just because the girl was a slut, that means she had to be so humiliated in public. The whole gang rape was filmed too. They allergedly used billiard cues, beer bottles to rape her. She was totally unconscious during the rape, thank goodness for her. The girl was later dumped in a parking lot and she woke up bruised, bleeding and sore.  He got away with this trial, I do not know the details why. But now he is being charged with having sex with a minor again. This time, he was with another guy and 3 young girls. When police came, he tried to run by hiding in a bush in the backyard. Smart move....  I don't know what causes people to rape. Do they feel that the victim was asking for it? Begging to be fucked cruelly by the rapist? Do they feel that the victim, by saying "No", is actually trying to hint to them that "Yes, please fuck me"?? Or do they feel that since they have meat between their legs, it gives them every right to be "pleasuring" any women that walks on the street? That the women that they have chosen should feel so glad that they have been so priviledged to be having sex with them? What is in the minds of rapist? Do they even know they are committing a rape? I have heard of such a situation, the victim was drunk while having a nights out with her colleagues. Most the ladies in the group were either tipsy, or was rushing home and therefore unable to escort the victim. So 1 of the male colleague volunteered. Instead of sending her home, he drove her to his house and proceeded to have sex with her. I would call this a rape. Did the victim willingly agreed? She was pissed drunk and unconscious. Did she somehow, from her drunken stupor, managed to start begging for him to have sex with her ? This man have been constantly trying to win the favors of the victim but she always told him that she was not interested. The victim woke up the next morning, found blood on the bed sheet. She felt sore, both front AND BACK! What happened after that ? She was totally broken. This lady was a virgin prior to the incident. A lady that was brought up to treasure her virginity till marriage. She is over 26 years old. A 26 years old virgin, how hard is that to find in the current environment and world that we lived in. She was suicidal, she felt shamed. She constantly hurt her own body by scrubbing to hard on all her privates.  She now believes that men are dogs. Men will only want to have sex with her, in all sorts of unnatural position. She know feels that she should fuck any men that seems remotely interested in her because she is so fixated to the fact that she will never find another man that would love a non-virgin like her. Due to her conservative upbringing, she is not able to even believe that there could be a man out there that will love her for who she is and not what she doesn't have - her virginity. A perfectly good demure lady, graduating from a good junior college, working in a stable comfortable income job. But now, totally lost her sense of selfworth and is mostly self destructive. While the bloody rapist? Well, he is still at work. And before the time that she quitted, he would still leer at her and make lewd actions at her. Put yourself in her shoes. Is it traumatizing? To be facing your rapist everyday at work, seeing him hint at the only thing that you are dying to forget? But she cannot forget, the sores n pains from her lower body constantly reminds her that she was raped. That she has asked for it. That she is a slut. That she deserves nuthing better but to be used as a toy for all other men out there.   Hooray, another rapist walks scott free and another victim falls to the bottom of the scum pond.   Including this lady, I have personally known 4 raped victims. Most of them are fine now. Except for her. But most of them, just like her, went through the same self destructive torture in 1 way or another. None that I know have seeked professional help, they just heal back their own way. Sometimes, the healing goes right, and they lead a happy life. Sometimes, in the dead of the night, they still wake up in perspiration, feeling the extreme weight of their shame in their chests.  I do not understand why people would resort to rape. If they really needed to have sex that badly, why couldn't they pay for it? Those are professionals that could adapt into any form of role play, including playing the victim. Why hurt innocent girls ? 1 guy ever told me that he would prefer raping then going to a prostitute, coz raping is free. And he prefer clean girls than some, I quote,  "PUBLIC TOILET" .   I am waiting for the day that all these rapists will burn in hell for their sin. I am just waiting...I believe in kharma...If I knew any rapist, I would tell him to look out for his daughter, she may be getting 10x worst of what he dealt out earlier in his life.

      Being the idiot that I am, I have totally forgotten that GRE testing consist of 1 more section know as Analytical Writing. What it is, is basically  The Analytical Writing section consists of 2 timed essay sections . The first essay is an issue essay, whereby you are expressing an opinion on a general issue. The second essay is an  Analyze the Argument  essay.  Both kinds of composition were types that we were told to avoid while in our Singapore educations. From Primary school to Secondary school, we were advised to choose  story completion  type. The reason given was that many of us were not strong enough to write a convincing argumentative compo, now that I think back, I think its the teachers that were not strong enough to mark an argumentative compo.  The bottom line here is this, I have absolutely no practise in writing discussion or argumentative compo. Especially on topics that I do not understand. How are you going to argue if you dun understand the topic in the 1st place? Well, I guess its back to the GRE textbooks again to learn the skills required.  Damn, it sure is hot these few days. Sweltering heat. I am having a headache. Hope its due to the heat and nuthing else, like fever or flu.  Made dinner for my Vootwerk last night. Due to serious space constraints, and a lack of fresh meat and rice cooker, I could only make fried egg noodle with ham n eggs. Kinda pathetic, but it sure feels like 1 of the best meal that I have ever made. No, its not becoz the food tasted great, though Vootwerk said it was pretty good, but it was because I am cooking for the man that I love and not some blokes housemates that I used to have.  The kitchen sink was also a tad bit too small, and that had Vootwerk complaining when he was trying to do the pots n pans. Dinner was a little too small portion, left both of us feeling hungry. So its donuts time again. After donuts, a bit of gaming on Baldur's Gate II then its bed time. He fell asleep as soon as his head touched the pillow. I was studying my GRE to the company of the great Snoring Orchestra. I must have gotten used to it, because I am still able to fall asleep with it playing in my ear.  He gave me his Samsung phone last night. For my US SIM card. I just adore new phones. Its a new toy. Unfortunately, his phone only works with Cingular SIM cards. How unfriendly, AT&T phones can only use AT&T SIMS cards and so forth. No wonder phones are so cheap over here. Once you get it, you have to stick to the same telco anyway.   Head is still hurting. Neck is still hurting. When will the pain subside? Sigh....  Time to hit the books again.

      Well, its confirm. I will be flying back to Singapore on sept 28. I think for about 2 weeks, hopefully won't be any longer. October is the GRE testing period. I need to rush back for the darn test.  Hopefully, this is the trip that will allow my Vootwerk to meet my parents and at least prepare them for what is going to happen. As it is, our wedding was postponed till the next trip because I am not allowed to  COS - Change of Status  and not allowed to  EOS - Extension of Stay . Just for the records, these are not my slangs, these are the darn terms writtened into my passport by the INS.   Weekend was pretty alright. Slept in late on Saturday. Shouldn't have slept so late on Friday. Damn the Baldur's Gate. Picked up a new game on Saturday. Baldur's Gate II.  Hahahahahha  After returning from Game Stop, we started playing the game. First round was all wrong choices of character, the darn dwarf that uses strongbow (???) and the darn dark elf that walks around with a tome in his hand (???). Fucked those 2 characters to hell. Replayed using Barbarian and Cleric. These 2 definitely is a better choice. Vootwerk keeps complaining that his Barbarian is stupid with no brains. After a short session, we went out to meet his colleagues from work. 1 of them is leaving for Japan for over a month, so this is kinda farewell-get-together-thingy. Had pretty good Japanese food there, and dirt cheap too. So much Asahi beer and its still so cheap. On the way home after dinner, we stopped by Krispy Kreme to pick up 2 dozen donuts. Its madness, 2 person eating 2 dozen donuts. I am so gonna blimp out of shape.  Went to Ikea on Sunday. The Ikea in LA is the 2nd largest in the world. I never get the chance to really go for a stroll inside, coz we were rushing to home to fix up some computers. Vootwerk was kinda grouchy the whole of Sunday. Must be due to the darn computer. The best thing that I could have done is to sit quietly and do my GRE verbal test. Well, I kinda contributed to his frustration as well coz I got upset after hearing some of motherfucking cuntface bitch saying "I love you, Honey" to him. What bugged me most was not the fact that the recording was there, it has to do with a few things. Mostly, I just choose to abuse myself by imagining how much he might have loved that cuntface. This stupid self hurting process was even more devastating due to the fact that he agreed that there were other bitches that loved him.  See, in the beginning, he has always said that he has never had such an experience as he had with me. He says that he really loves me and that he could not say the same words "I love you" to other bitches. I chose to believe that. And he says that even though those other bitches did love him, its never the same way as I loved him. I chose to believe that too. But after hearing that cuntface cutiepie voice saying I love you to the man that I adore. And calling the same endearment as I would address him. That drove me over.   "So there are other bitches that loved you enough to leave a voice recording for you?" "Yup" "Calling you honey too" "Yup" "Lucky you" "......" For me to be fair here, the recording was made in 1999, and while the above conversation was unravelling, he was neck deep in his computer work. Yes, I am being impossible and ridiculous. But how do you swallow that vile tasting stuff at the back of your throat when you hear some other bitches addressing your man in love and affection ??  Vivid imagination and PMS does not work well together. Perhaps knowing my own man too well does not work well here too. Too many things to imagine, too much ammo in my arsenal to hurt myself. I love him too much. I will not share. If this turns into an obsession, then I am willing to risk everything for it.  Monkey, I dunoe how you do it, but I can't.   Still haunted by that fucking cuntish cute voice...still could hear her in my head...

      Damn. Is it just me or will everybody wake up feeling really cold ? Every morning getting out of bed is sheer torture. Its way too cold. Way too damn cold. Even though its summer here, and I believe the sun is really scorching outside, I still wake up feeling too darn cold. I think its just me.   Or it could be simply the fact that I wake up without him around...  We slept late last night. Was busy playing PS2 - Baldur's Gate. Such a kid he is when we play games together. Daily, after dinner he would be bouncing up and down his bed asking for the game to be started. Being an avid gamer myself, I will never say "no". Besides, its not like I have any reason to reject him anyhow. We are completing Baldur's Gate in less than a week. I have a feeling we will be buying and selling alot of games, judging by the way we grind through the games that we have.  I miss him already. Another 7 hours before I see him again. Anybody out there ever just held onto the pillow that your loved one slept on and just breathe in the scent? Heck, I sure have been doing that daily after he goes to work. Yeah, you can call me sick or whatever not, but if you've never done something utterly silly or ridiculous, do you think you have ever been in love?   I used to tell people that the feeling of love is just a chemical reaction in your brain. It's no big deal. It's not major cause of concern. How wrong I was. Does that mean I only fell in love once? And it's with Vootwerk? I don't know.   Anyhow, we are going over to the tattoo parlor today to check out a new tattoo design for him and myself. Collin (our tattoo artist) have been drawing up some designs for us and we will be checking them out today.  *Can't wait ..After that, will probably have dinner and catch a movie. But that's later.  For now, it's back to my GRE preparations...I am starting to hate all these vocabularies...

      For those of you that have known  urlLink Serpiente , would probably know me. Anyhow, unfortunately, fuckness.com has became an official adult porn site. It was really a scream site for  urlLink Monkey  and me. Oh well, all great things have to end, I guess.  I am back again, this time away from the grouchy bitch that I once was in fuckness. Let's only hope that it will stay this way for a  long  time.    P.S. This is only a blog site. I have not done up my whole personal site yet. So if you're interested, just read about me, my love for Vootwerk and my day. Else, you could always leave.   I have finally left Sydney after 2 years there. Can't really say that I was glad to leave. Can't really say that I wasn't glad to do so too... Guess I am still contradicting.   To update, I am currently in Los Angeles. Hopefully this stay will be forever for me. No, I am not here cause its cool and wild and fun. No, I am not here cause its lovely, has great weather, great food, great people. No, I am not here cause this place has freedom, has rights, and has absolutely no guilt trip available to take. But yes, I am here because the school that I want to attend it smacked right here. And yes, I am here because the love of my life is here too.  I love my Vootwerk. Everynight, I just pray to God that this will be the one, he will be more forever. Never a night gone by for the past week that I have never thanked God for the opportunity to live life the way that I have always dreamt of.  I love the place that I am in too. Not that its a big deal, but it is his place. And everything belongs to him. Everything that I touched, I know in my mind that he has used it before. And I just feel so close to him, just by being here.  Yes, I am in love. And I am not ashamed or shy about it.   Just for the record, I met my Vootwerk somewhere in late Aug or early September. He was a regular in the room that I happened to stumbled into. Yes, I know what you might be thinking.... cliche . We started dating on Sept 21 of 2002.   There were hiccups, I'll admit that much. But as what he says, its all this hiccups and difficulties that we have endured, that strengthens our relationship to an unbelievable level.  We made it....that's the important part. We made it. From here on, things will be falling into the right places.

      Monkey, remember when I was with Meng and it was a whole 4 years of self destruction? You were there telling me to get out. We were not as close friends then, but even you knew that it was a helpless relationship. Even then you felt that I should get out because it does me no good.  You gave me a million and one reason why I have misjudge the Boy. You say its your bad for bitching too much about him to me. You said I have misunderstood him. I never judge him Monkey. I do not hate or even dislike him. I do not know him and its not fair for me if I made judgement.   What I was trying to tell you was simply, he is NOT good for you. You are wasting away. Being in college overseas is supposed to be a learning experience. You are supposed to enjoy and be able think back and miss the days. Not live in a constant shell like you are now.  Woman, you know I do not judge you. No matter what you say or do. I do understand everything. I have felt the same. There are days that Meng made me feel loved and so blissful too. Why? Not because he did anything special, but because I loved him so much that if he pays normal attention to me, I would feel that he is so loving. Do you reckon its the same for you now?  You love him. That much is beyond a shadow of doubt.   Does every simple thing he does for you seems so loving? The simple gesture that he did in Woolies. That made you felt happy and loved. Why? I guess he does love you, and that is his way of showing that he cares. But I have a second guess, could it be that you are so depreived of his affections and attentions, that a simple offer as such could make you feel 100% better?  When you hunger for something long enough and bad enough, every simple thing seems to make you feel happy.  I am worried for you, woman. I am very worried. I feel so happy and glad when you are fine and happy. When you are feeling on top of the world, I felt so relieved and glad for you. I can feel your happiness from your blog.   But when you are down and lonely, I feel your mood too. It hurts to be feeling so lonely. You deserve better. Please consider yourself more. Be abit more selfish.  Enough bending over backwards for a love affair that is loopsided.  Enough mothering a young boy that does not know how to respond appropriately.  Enough tears and constant nagging worries.  He is not your child. He is supposed to be your lover, your best friend, your comfort and your support.  You are the only person that knows deep down how you feel. You may love him with all your heart and soul. But until some compromise and respect is given to you, you are only emptying yourself into a shadow of what you are.  I care, therefore I say all these. I do not intend to hurt or insult you. I hope you understand.   Do love yourself more.

      Seems like I can never get rid of my insecurities. Even after 2 years being with Vooty, I still am preparing for the day that he will dump my ass. I guess its all about being prepared. I agree that such preparations will serve more harm than good, if I could help it, I would stop. Believe me. But I can't help it. Therefore, I can't stop.  For what it's worth, he has done nothing to make me worry so. But every late night, every meeting, every trip away from me makes me fret. It's not like he has been treating me differently or colder than usual. It's just me.  Sometimes, I think the industry that he is in makes me worry more. To think of it, it is probably the safest industry to be in because any office romance or affairs will result in a termination. And being in the porn industry, law suits against sexual harressment is a high taboo. With such strict rules, people generally are more alert with such on-goings. Kinda reduces the chances somehow. But then, forbiddened fruits always tastes the sweetest, doesn't it? Yeah..it does.  We had a fight last night. I hurt my wrist while I was struggling to get away from him. I have weak/loose joints. Most of the time, its my left wrist that gets hurt, but this time, I hurt my right wrist. And I do not have a cast for my right. So I guess it's living with excrutiating pain for the next week until it heals.  The fight was a builtup of tension. He had a bad day, I had a bad day. I was looking forward to see him for dinner, he feels I was crowding and rushing him out of the house. He flared up, I lost my control. Its a builtup. He tried to come to me to hug me, I wasn't in the mood to be pacified. I put up a fight, he tried to grab me, I hurt my wrist. He threatened to leave the house and not return home for the night. I stopped him. Had a screaming fit and finally settled down. Neither one of us actually apologized. Perhaps we both felt that each other was at fault, but also, we were both at fault too. Dunnoe how to apologize for things like this. I am sorry for what I did, but you are at fault too ? Sounds kinda pointing finger when said that way.  I told him he hurt my wrist, he apologized for that. He wants me to get a cast for it because I have loose joints and I have to immobilized it to allow it to heal quickly. I can live with a cast on my right wrist, because I am left handed. Probably will go get one later tonight. He is working late, I am making dinner for him. Maybe we can go and get the cast after dinner.   I always feel insecure, it has killed so many relationships already. I will bolt out of a relationship before it has the chance to go bad on me. Even though the only thing that was going bad was my imagination. It didn't matter to me, I will still run off. Even with Vooty, I have had occassions in the past that I ran off because I thought that he was being unfaithful and was fucking some other bitches behind my back.  I don't feel secure. No matter what the guy does, how much he tries to convince me, I still left. I have had guys that would have done anything to prove their love for me, it still wouldn't have mattered. Vooty doesn't do half as much as what those guys were willing to, but I trust him more than the rest. But trusting him more than I trust the rest is not enough, I still get bouts of insecurities hitting me.  I love my guy so much, so much until I am feeling so vulnerable to any form of hurt that he will be giving me. Perhaps I am wounded up too tight, with all the stress of my schooling and such. To the point that every joke or tease will seem like a carefully planted jibe.  Securities, I need securities. Even after meeting his collegues at work, and having them tell me that he is a great guy and that I am lucky to have gotten him, I am still fretting over some imaginary bitch that he is fucking while at work. If I dun stop my insecurities from building up, things will go wrong. I will become cold and guarded and then things will really go downhill. In some twisted state of mind, I will vaguely recognized that it was my own doing that unravelled the relationship, but I will not be able to stop the domino effect.  For now, I guess its just sit tight for the ride.

      This is what my dad told me today....   I guess you have to work the human relationships, as advised by the Prof, to let everyone know that there is a 'Singapore female student' who is very interested to do their 'thing'. Human relation management, is what are good at - be true to yourself.    Go boldly where no Fong(s) and LOH(s) has gone before. This time I can't do it with/next to you. You'll b OK, and I love you. Bye   And this is not even my real biological father. Given a second chance to have a normal family. Hell, he is not my biological father, my mum is also not my biological mother.   Someone out there still loves me....

      I am sad and defeated by my trip to UCSB. To summarize, here are the following mainpoints of the meeting.  1. I have to get 740 and above for my maths. The maximum score is 800. 2. I have to get 4.5 and above for my composition writing. The maximum score is 6. 3. I have to get 75% and above for my english. 75% is less than 740/800 for sure. 4. I have to get 2 academic reference letter that stresses on my performance and results in thesis n research. Not just your normal reference letter used for work. 5. Since I stopped studying for 1 year, I have to get 1 reference letter from work. 6. I have to include my CV in my application 7. I have to include an abstract of my thesis research 8. I have to write a 1.5 to 2 page long essay to tell them "why they must accept me" and "what I can contribute" and prove that "I am extremely keen to learn even though I do not have strong foundations in MEMS technology" 9. Only an average of 20 students get accepted out of over 500+ applicants.  Now, problems that I face with the above 8 points.  1. The maths is 30 questions in 30 mins. Its not direct maths, its a puzzle. So they test you on how good you are in approaching, your IQ in solving puzzles and how calm you are. -  I am a well known gan-cheong spider that is extremely pesimissitic  2. The compo topics are on things that are more like social science. 1 compo on analyzing a social scenario, 1 on arguing your views. To score 6, you need strong vocab and clear thinking, as well as concise languages and superb examples. Analyzing a scenario is 45mins. Arguing your view is 30mins. -  how to even write if I have never given much care about current affairs. Plus, my vocab and writing skills are not as strong. Even Vooty, who is strong, got only 3.  3. The test is based strongly on HOW strong your vocabs are. They will have words like  Affectation, Inebriated, Panegyric, peregrination , just to name a few. You are tested in your ability to form coherent bridges between 2 words, tested on finding their opposites, completeing sentences and reading compre. All within 45mins for 30 questions. -  the vocab is really abit too much, GRE vocabs are crazy. Thatz why engineering faculty requires only 75% compared to the 85% in maths.  4. My fucking aussie lecturers are not responding to me. I have only 1 general template style reference 5. Easy, no problem. 6. No problem too. I have plenty of versions 7. Can do too. I still have everything from my thesis. Vooty kept a copy too.  SO schweet of him huh...  8. This fails me. I dun even noe where to begin.... 9.  Hooooo Yaaaahhhhhhhhhhhh .....damn...i really needed to hear that, didn't I?  But I think I should concentrate on my GRE 1st. Try my best. Hey, if i fail to meet the cut, just get married and stay at home with Vooty and be a nice little housewife lor.  *Yah right, as if i can...hahaha   After the meeting, i just hang around the school. Since my train was at 6:50pm and I finished my meeting by 2:30pm. I never even have lunch. I was so distracted. I sat infront of a hotdog cart, and never even moved to get a hotdog. Yessirreee, I was darn distracted.  No point sulking and whining now, like Vooty says, I am just taking it all wrong. Meet the cut or not, I still have to try.

      My back is itchy and its driving me nuts. The price we pay for beauty.  Sigh..   I am jealous of Vooty's calf tattoo. Why does his always end up looking nicer than mine?? Him and his hairy legs, yet the tattoo is so  puuurrtttyyyyy.  I never imagined just red and black tones could make such a great tattoo.  The day that he went to get his tattoo, he made me put on a fire engine red t-shirt that screams " REDLIGHT DISTRICT " at the back. Even for those people that dun understand what it is, I am sure they can deduced that its a freaking porn related stuff. Its America's top porn studio.   Perhaps its the color of the t-shirt, perhaps I am just self conscious. But damn, I sure feel lots of eyes staring at my back. And since the t-shirt is available only to people working in Redlight District and their affliates, I must be part of the porn industry. Perhaps that was why so many people were staring at me.  It was pretty fun for awhile. I wonder what it is like to be a porn star. Other than the great income and ever present risk of a STD or HIV infection.  I doubt I will ever survive in the porn industry. Just for the simple fact that human porns makes me gag. Hentai is way better for me than the real human stuffs. This allergy towards porn seems to have started only recently. Shortly after I studied in UNSW. While staying with my housemates, I was still able to watch porn with them. It's only after that, that I start having problem watching sex scenes in explicit details.   I think I am allergic to porn.  hahahahaha   Well Monkey, I thot u wanted to design my snake for me ? I am still waiting. From newspaper to pokka dots already....where is my snakkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkeeeeeeeeee????????????  tsk tsk..this woman

      Suddenly everything seems so different to me. People that I called friends, suddenly doesn't seem so genuine anymore. Things that seemed trivia, suddenly doesn't seem so negliable. Things that I took for granted, doesn't seem so conviniently there anymore. Have I simply grown up or grown confused?  Its kinda depressing sometimes, when things happened around you, and you suddenly realised that it affects you differently this time than the last. You are kinda forced to acknowledge the fact that you have changed.  Everybody lives through their lives with so many different views and expectations. People get crushed as they continue their lives. Some people walks through path that are distinctively more difficult than others. Some people merely drift by with little or no problems.  What I truly hate is when people that are smart, successful with truly no difficulties in getting their goals in life, start to put other people down. Most of them say they dun realised, or they dun mean to. But if they really did not realised or did not mean to, then they are truly that stucked up and conceited? How scary. Some individuals go through life, living day to day just to get confirmation for their achievements. If confirmation was not easily available, the easiest way will be to belittle others that are struggling. The lower they can make another person feel, the higher they exult themselves.  Are they truly such cowards in life? Dun they understand or appreciate their own achievements ? Must they wear others out through their constant attention seeking? Perhaps that is also why I hate life in the coporate world.   I used to believe that friends dun take it out on each other. Friends support each other, tell each other off if its silly or out of line. I have always seen friendship as a mirror. A true friend will tell you everything, good or bad. Know when is the time for silly comforting murmurs, and when is the time for harsh, biting truth. But not everybody that I have met, have naturally developed into a level of friendship that allows them the right to condemn when they deem necessary.  Perhaps I am just stressed about the up and coming test. Perhaps I am just worried that I might never get into a grad school here. Perhaps I am sick of people telling me things will be alright, and turning around the next moment to laugh at my puny achievements.  He never had the right to so laughed at me. From his words, its so obvious that it made him feel 10x better to be able to so put me down, because the next words were even more depreciating then the first. When someone is on their back, 'friends' will run forwards to show care and concern and whispers comforting words. But it never seems like they will ever offer their hand to help you up.   I am sick of having 'friends'. I have always opted to be anti-social. Because true friends are hard to come by, and if they are there, 1 is more than you'll ever need. I would rather have 1 true friend, then a whole troop of 'friends'.  A friend once told me,  "Time will be your best friend"  He said it when we were talking about understanding people. I couldn't agree more to what he said. With almost everything in this world, time does become your best friend. If you want to understand someone more, give it time. If you wanna forget or heal a pain, give it time. If you want to make a change in your life, use time to plan and think wisely. Time helps you to grow and understand things. Time gives a deeper defination to situations.   I appreciate my friends and the time I have with them. I appreciate what I have in life and whatever time I have with them. I appreciate the love that I have grown to depend and cherish, and whatever time I have with him.  Someday, I might sit back and re-think about my current struggling situation, and perhaps, just perhaps, I might see a bigger picture to all of it. But for now, I am just a young soul in this stage of my life, and I will allow time to teach me what I have to learn.  For the friends that I have and cherish, until we ever grow apart, I thank you for all the comforting times and truth that was shared.  For all the 'friends' that think they have the right to laugh and condemn me for their own expanse, go fuck a tiny spider.  To the only special person in my life, thank you for being there. You've helped me see things in me, that nobody else realised existed. You've been proud of me and all my tiny achievements. And you've never once willfully be mean to me, just so that you can hurt me. You've been there when I am at my weakest, and you've never left even after seeing everything, after knowing everything. I love you for everything that you are.

      My Vooty's comp went  kaput  last night. I am using my beautiful bright red baby right now. Red like fire. With orange lights. Totally transparent. Oh yeah baby....fire red...  Unfortunately, the CDROM on my red baby seems to have retired. Now I cannot have my damn GRE software installed. Translating to the fact that I am having problem doing practise test. I hope they have things online for me to do. Have to start searching for it I guess.  Or else, its back to the good ol'fashion way, studying via book.   I seem to be having problems sleeping these few days. If I stay up to read, I will develop panick attack after I shut off the light to rest. I tried to go to bed the same time as my Vootwerk last night, and have him hold me so that I wun break out in perspiration again due to panick attacks. But alas, I still felt the waves of attack before it receded. It wasn't bad last night. But still, I dun understand why it happens.  Its like, there are so many things in my mind and I will just lie there and panick. I will be like thinking what is wrong, what can go wrong. And my palms, feets will be wet with perspiration. My back and the neck will feel so hot, like I could almost feel the heat rising. I will be almost hyperventilating and not be able to calm down.   Anybody with any ideas why this is happening?   The feeling is miserable, even if I am so tired from reading, I will not be able to flop over and sleep. Could it truly be due to GRE alone? Or is something wrong with my mental state of health?  Can't say that I am looking forward to bed time anymore. The feeling is just miserable. Every minor things seems magnified by multiples of 10s. Things that never bothered me, either in the day or in the night, seems to be causing me to fret my sleep away.  I really can't say I understand what is wrong. Could it be just due to something as simple as stress? Can this one word - STRESS - cause so much chaos?
