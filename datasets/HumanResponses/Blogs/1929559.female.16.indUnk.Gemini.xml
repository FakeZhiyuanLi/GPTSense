       you know, i hate it when people make promises they dont keep. it's one of my pet peeves. atleast i keep the promises i make. but no. anyways, hurricane's still going on. so far we've lost power twice, but only for a few seconds/minutes at once. i've been outside twice, once for maybe 20 minutes, the other for maybe 30 min to an hour. stocked up on jr mints, sno-caps, skittles, tangerine sours altoids, and pixi sticks. i WAS hyper. then i waited. and waited....and guess what? waited some more. YAAAY for waiting!...-.-() anyways, today's been kinda- no, not kinda, REALLY boring. lets see if tomorrow goes better....  mood: mischevious/irritated Music: Going Under- Evanescence

         You're Most Like The Season Winter ...  You're often depicted as the cold, distant season. But you're incredibly intelligent, mature and Independant. You have an air of power around you - and that can sometimes scare people off. You're complex, and get hurt easily - so you rarely let people in if you can help it. You can be somewhat of a loner, but just as easily you could be the leader of many. You Tend to be negative, and hard to relate to, but you give off a relaxed image despite being insecure - and secretly many people long to be like you, not knowing how deep the Winter season really is.  Well done... You're the most inspirational of seasons :)    urlLink   ?? Which Season Are You ??     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla     oodag! cant touch this....

         Sneaky, sneaky one. You are witty and a master of trickery. You like to scare people and perhaps rob them. Haha. You could be a good dealer and negotiator, which is interesting. You barely ever get caught in what you do, and you like it. That's why you might do some things you're not supposed to--you know you'll get away with it. It's people like you that could unexpectedly get caught. Anyway have a good time tricking people. Have a Happy Halloween, Eight-Legged Friend.    urlLink   What Halloween Figure Are You? (Fun Quiz!

       OODAG! whatcha gonna do now huh PUNK? ::snerk::    You are the mysterious night and all its sounds. No one knows much about you or what and how you think, unless they're really close. You prefer the peace and solitude. You are quiet and don't express many of your feelings. If you had the ability to be invisible, you would love it, and take advantage. You are more of a nocturnal person and don't really like going out much, but the thing about you is that you may know how to have a good time. Hmm. Anyway, have a Happy Halloween, Shadowy One.    urlLink   What Halloween Figure Are You? (Fun Quiz! MANY RESULTS!)     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla

       ...i'm definitely two different people in one body, lookit this.... the first thing i got was....    You are Form 1,  Goddess : The Creator.   "And The Goddess planted the acorn of life. She cried a single tear and shed a single drop of blood upon the earth where she buried it. From her blood and tear, the acorn grew into the world."   Some examples of the Goddess Form are Gaia (Greek), Jehova (Christian), and  Brahma (Indian). The Goddess is associated with the concept of creation, the number 1, and the element of earth. Her sign is the dawn sun.  As a member of Form 1, you are a charismatic individual and people are drawn to you. Although sometimes you may seem emotionally distant, you are deeply in tune with other people's feelings and have tremendous empathy. Sometimes you have a tendency to neglect your own self.  Goddesses are the best friends to have because they're always willing to help.    urlLink   Which Mythological Form Are You?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla     then i got....     You are Form 7,  Gryphon : The Wyrm.   "And The Gryphon displaced the balance of the world in his favor.  With grace and control, Gryphon deceived mankind and ruled over civillization.  But even he realized that all good things must come to an end."   Some examples of the Gryphon Form are Satan (Christian) and Baphomet (Assyrian). The Gryphon is associated with the concept of control, the number 7, and the element of wind. His sign is the gibbous moon.  As a member of Form 7, you are a very in control individual.  You maintain your coolness in most situations and always seem to be prepared. Though some may say you are a bit of a control freak, you know that you really do make the best leader even if others can't see it. Gryphons are the best friends to have because they have a positive influence on people.    urlLink   Which Mythological Form Are You?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla      how freaky is that? i'm satan, AND i'm gaia... (and/or Jehova, which sounds strangely enough like Jenova...)

       hm...i wonder how many friends would even worry about me if i was in an extremely depressed state, contemplating suicide...not that i would.    hell knows i wouldnt do that, i've dealt with it enough to know that its the coward's way out; and completely and utterly stupid.    why do you think you were given the privledge of life, just to cheat out on it? this isnt a game, people. i'm pretty sure you have figured this out. in most games, you just keep going. picking up clues here and there, levelling up, and you finish the game. you dont just stop in the middle of it saying "I'm sick of this." and quit. it's incomprehensible.   aaaaaaaanyways, ^_^ to the good part.   hmm...had james over today and we played (and beat) baldur's gate (awesome game) theeen we watched Samurai Deeper Kyo with my brother (HOT guy in it...hooly cow, name's Ajira. he's blind though, but I CLAIM HIM! my god he's hot...lol ^^()) ummm had pizza and got abused. lol, as in poked, hair pulled, and stabbed. ^^and now i want to kill james and my brother, but i already wanted to do that in the first place. ::grins:: anyways...i'm waiting for Ten-Chan to get on...::grins:: umm.....lets see......WE GOT THE FOUR DISC SPECIAL EDITION LORD OF THE RINGS: THE TWO TOWERS DVD TODAY!!! ::squeals:: It's AWESOME!!!  lord i love that movie. ^_^  ooh, more bad stuff. well, kinda. i apparently tend to get people into trouble when i worry about them...soo i figure i shouldnt do that anymore. i mean, for some people. ^^() not all. ummm....WE'RE OUT OF CHERRY COKE! DEAR MOTHER OF GOD! what is this world coming to anyways?!?! lets see...got the guilt trip put on me, but i can understand why. but dont ever compare me to her ever again. please dont.  ummmmmmmmmmmmmmm STILL NEED TO: visit all the places i listed last time. ^^()() especially scotland, texas, and Washington state  pull the two erg pieces  kill my brother AND james  knock some sense into a few people....  ...do my chemistry homework for the weekend...::smiles sheepishly::  aaand....kidnap Orlando Bloom.  ....oh! and watch a completely pointless movie with Katherine   AND...become an outlaw with Sara!!  music:...um...it's pretty silent right now...buuut i COULD put on Finding Nemo....  Mood: apathetic and tired ^^() ::falls over onto floor randomly and goes to sleep::

       oh yes, good days...good days.... -james- i think the good days are over. -me- no, they're just about to start. ::smiles::   yes, people, the good days really are about to start. i no longer have any obligation to have any feeling towards my friends, because i just really dont. i mean, it never really helped my case in the first place. and having feelings for their siblings sure as hell didnt work this time either. oh well, ^_^. makes my life easier.   anyways, okay....lets see here....  Erg Pieces i need to pull: 2K 6K  places i need to go: Chicago (with sara, me an' her are OUTLAWS! WOOO! GO US! XD) Washington (state, gotta meet Ten-chan! ::winks::) Canadia (to meet mah Oniichan Legend, my Sensei Kite, and mah friend Ice) The beach (with rebekka to meet caitlin, she's cooool XD) TEXAS! (to visit my Otouto-chan Joseph and Michael. ^__^ sorry about almost missing you guys!!!) aaand anywhere but here, just like sara said. ^_^ raleigh just isnt being nice to us.  OOH! and one more place... SCOTLAND! (nice nice accents....::drools::)  Things i need to do: Get onto Gaia and talk to peeeople my homework for chemistry (CHEEEMISTRY SUUUUCKS!!!! XD XD XD) see a totally pointless movie with Katherine, possibly do a few erg pieces with her Hug/kiss Ten-Chan (too bad he wont be on tonight...makes me sad...T_T) and get started on the "We The People" thing for ELPS (this is gonna be KICK ASS! i love these types of things! PLUS i get to dress up all nice in a suit with a black tie and stufffffs makes me happy!)  woo! now for today's news...um....nothing really happened. just got dumped into a garbage can by my ....friend, anna. doesnt really matter, its been happening alot anyways. umm lets see....i had two tests yesterday, one in ELPS and the other in Spanish. the spanish one i got screwed over on the Saber/Conocer part (damn "to know" verbs....>_ Finding Nemo ! CUTE MOVIE! XD hehehe   OOH! i'm picking up the four disc special edition Two Towers this weekend! MAKES ME HAPPY!!!   ::grins:: oh well, gotta call dad to tell him i dont wanna go to jazz band tonight....i gots a headache, yep yep. and i dont think that going near Anna's boyfriend martin or listening to really loud trumpets will help that. Now, for a random Finding Nemo quote...::  " Es-cap-e ." I wonder what that means...Funny. It's spelled just like "escape."  Mood: happy and/or apathetic Music: i'm listenin to Samurai Deeper Kyo going on in the background. oh yes, nice hack and slash bloody violence. gotta love it. considering i AM the bloody violent bitch of the little friendship that has now been flushed down the toilet along with my sanity.  ^__^ ooh yes, let the good times roll.      RANDOM SONG TIME!!!! WEEEEEEEEE! I WILL SURVIVE (Bad cosplay)  At first I was afraid, I was petrified, Kept seein' hairly-legged genderbenders by my side, Then I spent just way too long sittin next to this one girl, And I had doubt, 'Bout my ability not to hurl.  But damn, go back to outer space, You just ain't cute enough to wear that, and you're stinkin up the place. You shoulda grown a larger chest, And tried to shower every day, And I think the floor is creakin', cause of how much you weigh.  Go on now go, just leave the con, Just give it up now, I'll be much happier when you're gone. I dunno how you thought you'd fit into that suit, Do you think you're perfect? Do you think you're even close to cute?  But that's alright, I will survive, For as long as there is one that's cute, I know I'll stay alive Three days wanderin the hall, Hey, check him out, a sexy Squall.... And I'll survive I will survive... Hey, Hey!  It took all the strength I had trying not to swoon, When I saw that forty-something guy as Sailor Moon. And then I spent the next two nights, just trying slowly to forget I thought I'd cry, and I tried gouging out my eyes, Cuz I could see, his saggin butt, And then the second thing was even worse, his bulging gut. I couldn't stand his excess weight, I couldn't bear his hairy legs, And his chin was full of stubble cause he didn't care to shave.  Go on now go, just leave the con, Just give it up now, I'll be much happier when you're gone. I dunno how you thought you'd fit into that suit, Do you think it's funny? Don't you think your gender's wrong to boot?  But that's alright, I will survive, For as long as there is one that's cute, I know I'll stay alive Gettin' tired need to crash, Holy cow, that's one cute Vash And I'll survive I will survive... Oh....

         No one would really know your name. You would be called by what you do. For example, if you burn your victims to death all the time, you would be known as The Arsonist, or if you knife them, you would be known as The Slasher. You would be the mysterious killer who strikes at sporadic times, and would be very difficult to catch. You might dress up and mask yourself when you perform your horrible killings. Your identity would really be a mystery. Obviously you would be wanted all over the place, and authorities would desperately try to capture you. Even if you were caught, you would not say much. The public would greatly fear you because you could just strike unexpectedly.    urlLink   What Would Your Serial Killer Name Be?

       okay, lets start off with the events of today:  	 this morning my mother decided to take the internet away from me for very reasonable reasons, i just wasnt happy. i mean, who wouldnt be when you  have the same internet restrictions on christmas break that you did during school? ...that’s what i thought. but like i said, they were reasonable. so, i made myself some uber sweet tea and called James, and found out that i could go over to his house. 	 now, here’s where the butt of everything starts; i called my mother, and she decides that i should take my little brother, Beckett, with me. after he had decided to make fun of me this morning about the thing that my mother was reasoning with. (got him in trouble for that, it was some great fun of the day.) i said no, and she brought up the fact of christmas spirit. and, i quote myself; “christmas spirit...::laughs:: that left with Midterms.” and she said “yeeah, sure....call me when you find out everything.” and i hung up and called her back maybe five minutes later. “here’s your christmas spirit, i’ll bring him with me.” i could practically see her smiling so i was pretty happy at the moment, then called james back maybe 10-15 minutes later.  	 when i got over to james’ house, it was pretty nice. Mary attacked me, heh. ^^ love that child. but, something was wrong. guess who was being an ass by the end of the visit? you are correct, mi hermanito. Beckett. he has no manners when it comes to visits. james had to tell him to say goodbye to some people who had come to visit (the little shit.) him and james ganged up on me, when it was just a fight between me and james. (pillow fight that is.) and i was hurting, no one noticed though (thank god...it was only a little headache. or so i thought at the moment.) and guess what? i had babysitting to go to. oh yes, joy of all joys. Babysitting the Devils spawn who have the names of Sophie, Jack, and Patrick. but hell, i need the money.  	 ironic, i brought over the games Devil May Cry, and it’s sequel, DMC2 to play (and also Soul Calibur ll) little did i know what was ahead of me. 	 the children decided to play the game “water gun”. take a guess at what happened. ...if you know anything of the children i babysit, you are most likely correct in your guess. hell ensued. all sorts of hell. patrick then got sophie (the youngest, and the only girl) to join him in the game and filled a spray bottle with water. he ended up dumping it on her and she came screaming upstairs. this was a point in time that i was talking to MadKow and Zephadus on AIM. so, i told her to go change and that i’d give her my jacket just in case he did it again so her clothes wouldnt get wet, my jacket would. everything was pretty hell free for the rest of the night until my dad decided to come pick me up.  you know, i get usually some internet time for the day and i usually get it after babysitting. well guess who decided to be the fucking internet nazi of the fucking day? yes. mi papi.  	 god damnit, what the hell did i do to fucking deserve this HMM??? i let my brother come with me over to a friends house despite the fact that he’s a total social leper (in the etiquette way) and an ass, i babysat without bitching, i even let the child use my coat!!! but no, not even me holding a civilized conversation with my own father would convince him not to be a FUCKING ass. mom was right, my father and brother are uncannily alike. god damnit, i get to fucking live with two Chauvinistic Pigs, both non caring about other people in the same exact way and get mad whenever we point out that they’re exactly alike in personality. but hell, i have to put up with them.  	 to make my day even better, my dad decides to cut off the internet in the middle of a much needed conversation with MadKow. i was beginning to regain myself and was in a FUCKING GOOD MOOD!!! but no. i had to have a really bad day, my father decided that. well, yep. i’m writing this at 11:03 at night on my laptop, on AppleWorks. after breaking a promise to Arick in which i felt like shit over, my brother being a rude little ass, the children causing not so needed hell, and my father being yet a BIGGER ass if possible. now, tell me, why do bad days have to happen? tell me god damnit!!! tell me NOW!!! aaah shit i’m crying...i’ll post more on a later date.   mood: ....not so happy. nope. not at all. lonely, and terrible (for the Arick thing and for signing off in the middle of conversations)  Song: Kidnap the Sandy Claus - The Nightmare Before christmas (sung by Lock, Shock, and Barrel)  LOCK, SHOCK & BARREL Kidnap Mr. Sandy Claws  LOCK I wanna do it  BARREL Let's draw straws  SHOCK Jack said we chould work together Three of a kind  LOCK, SHOCK & BARREL Birds of a feather Now and forever Wheeee La, la, la, la, la  Kidnap the Sandy Claws, lock him up real tight Throw away the key and then  Turn off all the lights  SHOCK First, we're going to set some bait Inside a nasty trap and wait When he comes a-sniffing we will Snap the trap and close the gate  LOCK Wait! I've got a  better plan  To catch this big red lobster man Let's pop him in a boiling pot  And when he's done we'll butter him up  LOCK, SHOCK & BARREL Kidnap the Sandy Claws Throw him in a box Bury him for ninety years  Then see if he talks  SHOCK Then Mr. Oogie Boogie man Can take the whole thing over then He'll be so pleased, I do declare That he will cook him rare  LOCK, SHOCK & BARREL Wheeee!  LOCK I say that we take a cannon  Aim it at his door and then Knock three times and when he anwers Sandy Claws will be no more  SHCOK You're so stupid, think now I we blow him up into smithereens We may lose some pieces And the Jack will beat us black and green  LOCK, SHOCK & BARREL Kidnap the Sandy Claws Tie him in a bag Throw him in the ocean Then see if he is sad

       ::laughs:: maybe it's just me that finds this interesting...but one of my favorite characters (other than Hana-chan) is Sohma Isuzu and/or "Rin" here's her info (got it from the same site as Hatsuharu's...not that you care or anything. hell, i'm bored. deal with it.)    damn, wish that picture werent so big.....anyways her info: zodiac sign, prolly the horse.  "What is known is that Rin was Haru's ex-girlfriend. They dated in secret for a while, but then something happened and Rin wound up in the hospital. I'm not sure of exactly what happened, but it seems likely that Rin was beat up by Akito just as Kisa was. It was when Haru went to visit Rin at the hospital that she broke up with him. Haru still cares very deeply for Rin and he can't understand her sudden rejection of him. I don't really think that Haru knows the circumstances behind Rin's hospitalization. I wonder if Akito beat her up because he found out about her relationship with Haru?..."  sounds like an interesting mystery to me....er....okay, you wanna know the reason i put this up?   hell, i found it interesting that the fact that this one character (who happens to be one of my favorites) went out with the cow. ...now, think. anyone who even remotely knows my personal life, knows what i'm talking about.

          Saki Hanajima of Fruits Basket....awesome, awesome character....     Yuki Sohma, yet another awesome character.  Stats: he represents the rat (or mouse as it seems) of the chineese zodiac. whenever he is hugged by the opposite sex (female, dur) outside of his family, he turns into a mouse like rat thing....    ...cute.      this guy here is Hatsuharu Sohma (or Sohma Hatsuharu, however you would prefer) i dont know why, but this guy intrigued me (although i like Yuki more) Stats: he represents the cow ( ::laughs:: i almost said "Kow") here's the info on him i got from   http://www.geocities.com/cha_zuki/fb_characters/fb_chara.html   "Haru has something of a split-personality. "White Haru" is the lazier, calmer, kinder, mellower side of him, while "Black Haru" is the rude, arrogant and violent other side. Haru is generally "White Haru," but when he's angry, he'll turn in to "Black Haru" without warning. Haru has a *really* bad sense of direction, always dresses up in J-rockish attire (lots of leather and biker boots...although he rides a bicycle ^^) and he has a green tatoo on his left forearm. "  sounds cool.                   ...it's a shame he's semi-gay. oh well.  mood: still lonely.      music:...none. again.

He holds an innocent and naive outlook on life. Turn ons: He's always upbeat so you'll never have to pick up the broken pieces of his heart. Turn offs: He doesn't know when to turn OFF the funny and can embarrass you or not understand when you need to seriously talk.    urlLink   What is your ideal type of guy?

            urlLink Which Gackt are you most like?   quiz by  urlLink     urlLink mcvarmazi     You are the final appearance of Gackt as a Malice Mizer member. "Le Ciel" has an ethereal, slightly eerie, but extremely beautiful melody with very powerful lyrics. Gackt's vocal and lyrical talents are at its best in this song. Even the music video is memorable, probably one of Malice Mizer's best during their Gackt period. All of the members are almost godlike, with a very graceful state about them, and are wearing possibly some of the coolest visual kei outfits in all of jrock... just mind the fingernails.    nifty....::goes and downloads the song::

         Your wings are  DRAGON  wings. Massive and covered in scales, they shimmer with strength and magic. They are the most obvious display of your power - though it runs equally throughout your heart and mind. You are uncompromising and grave, with a profound sense of justice. You have firm ideas about what is right and what is wrong and set out to fix what problems you can. You realize that you are more capable of dealing with life and evil than most, and as such you see it as your responsibility to protect those who cannot defend themselves. You have existed since antiquity and as such you are wise far beyond your years in this lifetime. While you strive for fairness and peace, if someone should steal from your cave of treasure (though not all that glitters is gold) or compromise the happiness of you or one who is close to you - they have signed their death warrant. You have a mighty vengeance and will unleash it upon such people immediately and mercilessly. Arguing with you is useless...you rarely back down and are known for holding firm in your beliefs. Sometimes you feel intensely burdened with the troubles of others...acting as a Guardian can get so wearisome. But you never give up...you see it as your life's mission. Often very introverted, you can be so smart...it's scary. Such a combination of intelligence, creativity, power, beauty, and magic is often intimidating to those around you - who are also unlikely to understand you. Arrogant, proud, overserious, and sometimes a bit greedy or obsessed with whatever treasure you choose to pursue...you have enchanted people for centuries, and will continue to do so.    urlLink   *~*~*Claim Your Wings - Pics and Long Answers*~*~*     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla      o.o...that was long....^^ time for the second one!!!!!       You have wings of  STEEL . No one's really sure why, but at this point in your life you've shut off emotion to the point of extreme apathy. You are cold and indifferent much of the time...or perhaps you're just a good pretender. Next to impossible to get close to, even those who do never see the real you. It's entirely possible that YOU don't even know the real you. You have a certain fascination or attraction to destruction on a massive scale -  disasters, perhaps even death or the concept of the Apocalypse. Because you hold so much inside, one day you're simply going to snap. Then the mask will fall away, and your true wings will be revealed. Until then you will deal with whatever comes your way in icy bitter silence and acceptance. On the positive side, you are fearless and immeasurably strong - not much can crack through your defenses. You intrigue people, who can't help but wonder why you're the way you are. A loner and one who spends much of their time brooding and contemplating life and death - you are a time bomb waiting to explode and create some destruction of your own.    urlLink   *~*~*Claim Your Wings - Pics and Long Answers*~*~*     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla       o.O some of those things are SCARILY accurate.....but not all of them....   and for the third time i took it, i got  Broken Wings  (some things in it were scarily accurate....)   amazing, i got three totally different answers. although i think the dragon one is the closest....   mood: looking for my nice pants for tomorrow. sooo.....bored and lonely.

        ah, well, last night was...interesting.  Good things:  dropped 16 seconds off my 2k time (and that's pretty damn good if you dont know what i'm talking about)  Miguel got me to let loose some..anger i had been holding in. (THANK YOU!)  Had brownies!  Listened to Queen all night long (well, until i had to go to bed ^^()())  Worked on some stories (its been quite a while since i've written anything other than some stuff on Gaia...Oo..)   Bad Things:  realized that its going to take me quite a while for me to ever trust anyone that much again as to try and even suggest that i write something for them. (i'm not going into this, unless you want to know. ask me later. its a long story, and includes me bitching.) heh, it was funny though. i cant believe it takes only just me seeing a drawing for me to snap. i guess that's just how my memories react. (it was FUN! although i hate ranting.)  MY BROTHER TOOK THE REST OF MY BROWNIES THAT I WAS GONNA TAKE TO SCHOOL!!! (ok, so that was this morning. so sue me.) damn brat.  umm....my back and left knee hurt. (...yet again, this morning. but oh well. ^_^) yea yea, i know, i was rowing like an old woman. THANK YOU dianna. :glare: i lose my form when i get tired. its something to work on.  aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaand coach is a moron. there.    weeeell then, time to put up some lyrics....  Mood: Happy ^_^  Music: Killer Queen - Queen  She keeps Möet et Chandon  in her pretty cabinet 'Let them eat cake' she says Just like Marie Antoinette A built-in remedy  for Khrushchev and Kennedy And anytime an invitation  you can't decline  Caviar and cigarettes  well versed in etiquette Extraordinarily nice  She's a killer queen  gunpowder gelatine Dynamite with a laser beam Guaranteed to blow your mind Anytime.  Recommended at the price Insatiable an appetite  wanna try?  To avoid complications She never kept the same address In conversation  she spoke just like a baroness Met a man from China  went down to Geisha Minah Then again incidentally  if you're that way inclined (she's a  killer queen)  Perfume came naturally from Paris (naturally) For cars she couldn't care less Fastidious and precise  She's a killer queen  gunpowder gelatine Dynamite with a laser beam Guaranteed to blow your mind Anytime  Drop of a hat she's as willing as  playful as a pussy cat Then momentarily out of action Temporarily out of gas To absolutely drive you wild, wild... She's all out to get you  She's a killer queen  gunpowder gelatine Dynamite with a laser beam Guaranteed to blow your mind Anytime  Recommended at the price Insatiable an appetite wanna try?  Wanna try?

Speaking of Crew. at the beginning of practice, the bathrooms were out of order (but were back in order by the time the girls went out on the water to seat race, lol the irony) So everyone was forced to change...elsewhere....and McCall decided to just...change.... anyways, time to go upstairs.

Damn you Bush. Damn you to hell. this wont indicate anything at all, we have no motivation, no reason to do well (or even take this stupid test). so good luck, i'll send you a box of nice big pretzels when i get home.

       Yep. i'm sitting here on my iBook....just got back from the movie "Mean Girls" and i began to really think about 8th grade all over again.  a friend of mine circulated a rumor about me, she said i was a Lesbian. i mean, seriously, those are just words right?  think again.  i could understand why she thought that, i was learning to draw and as many of you know, i can only draw women. my reasoning for that is, i find it easier to draw them. plus, i cant draw men for jack shit. i've tried, trust me. what i would give to be able to draw a decent Legolas or Oliver Wood. anyways, back to the topic that this was supposed to be.  you can ask dianna or rebekka, i was...one of the most antisocial people in the world in middle school. i barely talked. i kept to myself, putting up a front of being a total bitch that would probably kill you if you crossed me the wrong way. ....when, in fact, i wouldnt.  that is a front. it is a lie. its a form of self defense so the said person wont get hurt emotionally. strange thing, the human psyche is. within the last two years, i have been devastated, frustrated, stressed, ecstatic, happy, everything you can think of.   Devastated: my....old best friend (who will remain nameless) went out with someone i knew like a brother. and, i thought we would still be best friends. you know, get together, talk online, go see movies....everything changed because she began to go out with him. she only talked about him. did everything with him. every other friggin word out of her mouth was about him, or was his name. and...she just forgot about me. and then, she had the nerve to dump him and get another boyfriend within the week. i'm sorry...but what she did to him was uncalled for, and i am still a bit upset about it. i try not to hold grudges, but that one has stayed...and then....when we (me and her ex) stopped by her house maybe 3 weeks after that (her little sister was stuck out in the rain, we were worried) to talk to her sister and make sure she was fine and not freezing. and we talked with her, and she wanted to go down to her older sister's bus stop. (the old friend) so we went down there and waited.... and waited some more. apparently she had "walked home" from her highschool and got home to find her sister wasnt there. one, it was freezing outside. and two, hell knows she didnt "walk home". that isnt the point. she came storming down the street, mad at us, because she couldnt find her sister. i can totally understand that. i really can, i'd be worried as all hell if my brother had disappeared. so we walked back with her, and i personally apologized to her father. he said it was fine and thanked us for stopping by to make sure the girl was ok...  that night, her blog entry was really quite...harsh. she said we shouldnt even be "coming around anymore" and she was "so busy with school work and band". she apparently had enough time for her new boyfriend and enough time to write that blog. why didnt she just tell me to not come around anymore? that's life. it sucks, but you just need to grin and bear it....oh yeah, and her mom thinks i'm a lesbian and blames me for her bad grades even though i havent talked to her for a year.  Frustrated: ok. lets see....suicide. people, life is a gift given to you by God. dont waste it. you were set on this earth for a reason, dont end your life just because things arent going your way.  The rest of the emotions (happy feelings!) : obviously crew, good grades, good days, ect ect.    now..for something more complicated that will probably leave me open. oh well.  Dianna named me the "friendly sea urchin" in 9th grade. because, well, i seem like a total bitch. i know i do, yet again, that is a front. my threats are empty, i wont even hurt a person unless they mess with one of my friends. (for example...Hart.) i remember she told me about her being asked how she could be friends with me considering i was such a bitch. heh, i know i seem like one...and i'm pretty sure i am one to most people. and i will apologize for it if you ask me to, up front, in person. sincerely. but her (Dianna's) answer to that was...once you get past that (really bad) exterior, i'm your normal, crazy, weird, quirky, video game loving, anime watching, hot guy loving, daughter of an artist and a paralegal, 15 year old, Sonja Lynn Carter. Granddaughter of Scherry and William Branson/Janice and Martin Carter. Who, as almost no people know, is a total sap at heart for good romances, pointy ears, scottish/irish/english accents, and loves to watch zombies stampede around biting people.

       ok..just explain this to me:  coach said that we have a 50% chance of getting a trailer for this next regatta (i know it shouldnt really pertain to me considering i cant go, but oh well.) we had weeks, even MONTHS of warning to prepare for this regatta, and we are still possibly without a trailer...why dont we just suck it up and share with Broughton...?  maybe that makes sense in my mind, but i'm not sure.   but seriously, this is the BIGGEST regatta of the season and we have a chance of missing it? what the hell. just the thought of that makes me aggrivated with the way things are going right now.  oooh well....might as well look up that "Metamorphosis" reading for English now....gar...  and yes, i do acknowledge that it was a stupid idea to post that huge entry. bah, i just had things to get off my mind. ^_^  Mood:

       i just saw Troy and...oh my goodness...that is a movie for every girl to see. holy mother of god...i can die happy now.  they even stayed true to the Illiad. i was impressed really. Achilles still dragged Hectors dead body around as it was tied to his chariot. King Priam still went to the Greeks camp to ask for Hectors body back. Paris was as he was supposed to be. a Coward. (Poor Orlando...oh well.) but i could've sworn Andromanche's child was thrown off the walls of Troy...and everyone was captured (well, the women were captured to use as slaves. the men and babies were killed.) along with Helen, who was taken back to Sparta. But maybe i'm wrong. either way, it was a kick ass movie. (i got in even though i'm not 17 yet. bwa ha ha ha ha...)  today has been a great day. i found out they're making a new Legend of Zelda game. (makes me happy) got new pictures from Advent Children. and also found out they're making a new Devil May Cry game. (although, the first one will always be the best.)          you also get to ride on horseback and fight at the same time. its quite nifty.

       two things never to do around me unless you want me to get all excited: 1.never talk about Final Fantasy: it'll immediately click in my mind "Advent Children" 2. never show me pictures on AIM from Advent Children:....just...dont.   i dont care what anyone says, that is going to be a good movie. not only for graphics, but i'm anticipating some actual decent voice acting. unless they just have it in subtitles. either way, i'm gonna see it.  and i leave you with one of my favorite characters -ever- :     he's so cool.

       and i'm so happy! i love jazz. and with a reason. i get an undescribable feeling when we're playing, its like runner's high. and i know i sound really stupid, but its incredible. our Bass player isnt the best, but he comes once in a while...he's pretty good when he comes, but when we dont have him there it isnt as good as it usually is. anyways...  Jazz Musician Now and Forever.   and i leave you with a picture of some place i love dearly:     the Blue Grotto in Capri, Italy. beautiful place. i wanna go there again.

       today....sucked. i dont know if it was just me, but these past weeks have been really stressful.  today, had two tests. one in english and one in chemistry. the two teachers made them out to be pretty easy, predictable tests. but no. in english, there were some damn obvious quotes. but the rest....totally obscure. made no sense what so ever. in chemistry...well i'm screwed. i'll just say that.  THEN i find out there was Artsplosure today at lunch. what the fuck? yeah. it was right downtown, my jazz band was playing at 11:30 and i couldnt go. well i didnt know in the first place. yeah. i'm pissed. and now my dad made me go clean up the dogs mess which is in fact HIS job and HIS fault. he was the one who left them downstairs. NOT ME.   things are probably only going to get worse as the week progresses. maybe the dance will be good.

       Live obstacles [while rowing]:  Fishermen  Bad tempered, bait-throwing old men. Ever seen any women fishing ? Exactly. This is because they have more sense.   Kids throwing bricks/firing air rifles  Depending how socially deprived the area you row through is, the technology used to shoot at you gets more complex.   Swans  Savage is the only word for them. Attacking rowers is built into their genome.   Dogs  If they don’t chase your coach and try to eat him, they will jump in the river and try to chase the boat.   Drunk crusties  Usually only a hazard in the Cam, when the Strawberry Fair is on.   Cows  Yes, I do mean in the river. Certainly an occasional hazard on the Cam, but there was also a story on rec.sport.rowing about a cow falling off the bank into a passing boat.   Snakes  Not only a hazard if you row on the Amazon, but also in the Cam (well known tropical river).   Rowers  Who have fallen out of the boat. NB : this is not just scullers.   Natural hazards (drop one shot)  Twisty rivers  Racing boats are designed to go in straight lines. If you add to this the fact that often the person doing the steering is not actually looking where they are going, (this includes coxes : see Zigzag ) it’s remarkable that anybody gets round a bend at all.   Running aground  Running aground on the Thames Tideway, where there are lots of concealed shoals, is almost acceptable by comparison with attempted re-creations of the speedboat chase from "Live and Let Die". Regularly seen in Oxford and Cambridge in bumps racing   Bridges/moored boats/Buoys  The larger and more permanent the obstacle, the more likely rowers are to hit it.   Trees  That these are definitively a) on land and b) permanent did not prevent one Cambridge college VIII from ramming their boat so hard into a tree that it had to be cut free with an axe. Did the unfortunate cox get any sympathy from her fellow professionals ? No. Some of them are still recounting the story 15 years later.   Things that really do not belong in the water  I now understand how railway sleepers come to be so common on the Tideway (they formed the walls of many a now-rotting wharf), and I suppose that discarded condoms and bunches of flowers form part of the same natural cycles, but I would still like to know who bothers to go to Chelsea Bridge in the dead of night and chuck their office waste away when there's a perfectly good dump only metres from the shore.   Fridges  Enough said   Vehicles  Again, what you hit in the river is correlated with the degree of social deprivation. Hence in Cambridge, it’s mountain bikes, in Glasgow, burnt-out stolen cars.

       Things Coaches Say and What They Really Mean:  1. I think we need to speed up the catches  Pull Harder  2. We could do with longer finishes  Pull Harder  3. Sit up  Pull Harder  4. Relax  Sit up, row longer with sharper catches (see points 1, 2 and 3)  5. I'm sorry I didn't see much of that piece  This bike is crap  6. I'm sorry I didn't see much of that piece but you must have been fast  This bike is crap but totalling the Dalmatian was my mistake  7. What do you think of it?  I've run out of things to say because you're not listening to them  8. I think it's time you went off and did some hard work - I'll see you later  I've run out of things to say and am off to the bar  9. I'd really like to pick you  You're dropped  10. We have a really strong squad this year  You're dropped  11. That looked good  It's bloody dark out here  12. I don't think I can make the next three outings  I'm giving up  But even then there's hope, oh yes, there's always hope.

       ah hah! even Absath of "Ctrl+Alt+Del" liked Troy. read and weep people:  "...I just got back from seeing Troy. I posted the new comic, and there was no way in hell I could not come here and post a little something about this movie.  It was awesome. I loved it. It was, however, not very accurate to the book, but honestly, what movies are? They took liberties to make for a better cinematic experience (as always happens) and you know what? I don't fucking care. The movie was still very fun.  Brad Pitt and Eric Bana were incredible. The first fight Achilles had at the beginning had me giddy. If you've seen the movie, you know exactly what I'm talking about. If you haven't seen the movie yet, prepare yourself for giddiness.  It's been quite a while since my English Literature or World Civ classes, but I remembered enough about the books to notice a couple of the errors. I urge you not to let that ruin the movie for you. I know, I know. There are some of you out there that love to sit on a stick and complain about innacuracies to the book, and how the web should shoot from cartridges, etc etc. Go see Troy. It's fun. At the very least, there are some very cool fight scenes."  Link (so you have PROOF!) : http://www.ctrlaltdel-online.com/index.php

I can do whatever I want. Dammit  ok, so i havent seen Van Helsing yet...and i havent heard many good things about it...but i'm still going to see it!

       well here we are, post animazement. well, for me atleast. that was just crazy fun. on friday, i got my picture taken SO many times Oo as lulu. one thing that made my day on friday was i was going in and out of the AMV room and as i was standing there, a little girl and a little boy just stopped in front of me. the little boy goes, "mommy, look at those belts!" his mom smiled and nodded, then he looked up at me. "are you Lulu from Final Fantasy?" he asked. i nodded, smiling. "yep." "I thought so..." he smiled. "your costume is really nice." he said, i smiled and thanked him. then his sister was just staring up at me and said, "She's so pretty..." their mom smiled and nodded. i was like "aww...." that made my night. i love kids.   now, on Saturday, i was Miho Toyha from Megatokyo. i didnt get as much recognition, but it was a MUCH more comfortable costume. (that Lulu outfit is SO heavy. oy.) but it was great, 'cause after the Cosplay and the awards were given out, i went and talked to the Megatokyo cosplay group that was there (they were short a Miho...and i was the only one there. mwa ha ha ha.) the largo goes, "...Miho. Evil!!" i just smirk and grab the cool thing. then, all the sudden someone yelled, "RUN MIHO! RUN!" ...and i did. all the way to the end of Artist alley. i never knew i could run that fast in a pair of army boots, a short black dress, and a belt hanging across my hips. it was awesome. ...then i got caught by Junpei. he did his job well, i must admit.   now, for some pictures:     Cloud and Sephiroth (one of the many. there were like..four or five Clouds and four or five Sephiroths. it was insane.)     Kuja from FF9 (i've only seen girls do this cosplay, and for good reason. have you seen him in the game? i thought he was a she.) and a character from Vagrant Story. (gar! i cant remember the name!!)     w00t! killstick!! Pirogoeth and her Sony Killstick (made of girl scout cookie boxes, awesome.)     POCKY!     Riku from Kingdom Hearts 2 (nice costume might i add, and she could still see too.)     Turks! these people made my day. Rufus and Tseng. they were awesome.     the whole cast of Naruto. er...without Naruto...     The good looking Cloud (that, i do believe, goes to St. Raphaels.) i dont think he knows which pose to do...    ...lets do a combination of all of them! i think..or else, Cloud has finally fallen under the weight of that massive Buster Blade.   i'll probably post some more later...it was fun. you guys should go, just for the hell of it.

       ok ok, i'm back. i'm just too lazy to update at my grandparents house.  anyways, just got back from the Navy Crew Camp and it was awesome, as usual. not as fun as last year, but great nonetheless. found some serious technique problems, but nothing i cant fix over the next season.  yet again, the five days we were there were without air conditioning and walking up 6 stories of stairs atleast 10 times a day. (they said the elevator wasnt working. pshht...riiight...) thank god the temperature was moderate, we did almost hit some sail boat people on our way back from ego alley (where all the huge yachts are and all that stuff. they were pretty.)  the last full day we got to go into Annapolis and i got some sushi and some ice cream and a drink from Starbucks (i needed caffiene Oo...)  i roomed with Sloane Earl (Sloaaaaneeeey hehe...she hates it when her name is said like that) and Sara Supancic. (sp?) anyways, it was crazy. Sloane and Marc are going to get married, we all know she is. they're....nearly exact duplicates and they were flirting like no other. it was...interesting. especially when they were talking on the phone and you only heard one side of the conversation...then i called my mom in the middle of it and she was like "Oo...what's going on?" it was crazy.  anyways, i'm here, at my grandparents house. in Pennsylvania. its...pretty nice. got to go driving in their shiny new car.   fact of the day: the Amish community makes the best chocolate covered strawberries in the WORLD.   they also have nice empty parking lots at their huuuugemongous stores to drive around in.

         ok i'm updating! woah cool, blogger gave you some new stuff on the "new post" thing....nifty...(colors!)    anyways, nothing much has been going on really...just erging....sleeping...chores...babysitting...eating...erging....and movies.      ...my mom got us DDR. the PS2 game AND a hard pad. which is quite fun really, i'm halfway decent. still suck, and that's one thing i can do instead of running. (i still have to go to physical therapy....dammit...not if i forget to remind my mom...) i'm not kidding! dont start laughing. this game keeps you moving, and plus i've unlocked nonstop mode so its going to be interesting....      just saw "De-Lovely" and i loved it. Cole Porter is one of my idols, he's just an amazing man. wrote some of the greatest songs ever, well...they're all Jazz so of course i'm going to like him. the movie was sad though...and a bit confusing at the beginning, i didnt understand what was going on until maybe...10 minutes in.    drawing alot, and writing essays. (damn essays.) and reading. (one EVIL book. evil evil evil..) but, good news.      i finally get to go to the beach this summer! i get to go with rebekka, so you know there's going to be some trouble happening. ...at some point in time. oy...i'm scared for the beginning of school. er...lemme rephrase that, i'm scared for the beginning of Crew. i've been erging, but i dont think i've erged enough this summer. practically erged every day 'cept for when i hurt my back...bah, oh well. what happens, happens, ya?

        yes! Moon Child came today! i had fun watching the hottest man alive on my tv screen. and i can do that every day now! whenever i want to. its so awesome.       anyways, Junior year has started. and so has Crew. i'm going to have less of a life than usual this year. (which is....no life whatsoever.) oh well.       i really like the new coach, she's great at...coaching. yep. but thank god we dont have practice tomorrow morning, i dont think i would've been too awake the rest of the day if i had done a 4k in the morning.      well, back to watching the Gackt-y goodness.      music: Gerudo Fortress (orchestrated) - Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time
