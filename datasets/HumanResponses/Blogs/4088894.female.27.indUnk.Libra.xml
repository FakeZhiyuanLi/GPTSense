						   I have been a member of the Dragonswood site for quite a while now & am pleased to say that recently, I was asked to write a regular column for their magazine (which, incidentally, is now available in some shops over in the USA &amp; even NZ, as well as quite a few here in the UK). My first column is in the latest issue (out for Lammas & Mabon) &amp; *puffs out chest with pride* is one of the featured articles mentioned on the front cover. I'm pleased as punch over that, I have to say, as this is my first professional writing venture (I've only ever written items for Triptych which I produce myself before now). Anyway, I thought I'd pop the article up here too & provide a link to the Dragonswood website, where you can order the magazine direct from them:  urlLink http://www.dragonswood.org.uk/index.php    THE ARTICLE:  Simple Witchery By Mabon   What is Simple Witchery?  As long as I can remember, I’ve always liked to keep things as simple as possible – I never saw the point in taking a complicated route if a simpler one presented itself to me. This isn’t laziness, just common sense, from my point of view. It’s something that has bothered me for a long time, this need people often seem to feel to complicate things which needn’t be so hard, and so I set out to boil things down to their barest components, take out all things unnecessary &amp; just get things done.  This is, essentially, what Simple Witchery is all about; leaving out all the extraneous information & implements, taking advantage of what we have ready to hand, &amp; simply enjoying the flow of things. I hope that with this column, I can share some of this with all of you, & perhaps even get you thinking of ways to simplify things in your own, unique way!   Why Simple Witchery?  When you lift out all the superfluous items, you are left with the most important element of the Craft. Which element is that? Earth? Air? Fire or Water? Perhaps Spirit? No, none of these. The most important element is always YOU; the person living it & experiencing all it has to offer. When you learn to rely on yourself &amp; your own abilities, you learn that nothing is impossible, you can do anything you set your mind to. That’s what it’s all about; setting your mind to something & getting it done.  For example, I don’t use a wand in any or my work. Yes, I own one – a very ornate &amp; beautiful one which was given to me by a very close friend – but I see it as purely a decoration for my home & it sits on a cherry wood stand atop my bookcase, where I can see it whenever I look up. It has never &amp; will never be used by me or anyone else. Why? Because it doesn’t need to be. I have no need of a wand when I have myself. Besides, what if at some point I had to cast in an emergency & found myself without my wand, what would I do? Panic? Well, that’s not really very sensible, is it? I’d do whatever needed to be done without my wand &amp; it would work every bit as well as it would while using a wand!  Basically, all you need to get yourself started is focus of will & energy. Once you get the hang of that, there’ll be no holding you back &amp; no end to the things you can accomplish. Over the coming issues, I’ll be exploring more of Simple Witchery &, hopefully, taking you along for the ride. I really hope you’ll find it fun!   T’is the Season…  These are some very simple rituals for the coming Sabbats – ones I use myself. I hope you’ll enjoy them.   Lammas (1st August)  Lammas is the first of the harvest festivals &amp; celebrates the beginning of us reaping what we have sown earlier in the year. It is traditionally a time for feasting, having fun, & preparing ourselves for a little more hard work before the harvest is done!   On the Altar:  Large beeswax candle Lengths of green &amp; red cord Wine, bread & honey   The Ritual:  Cleanse and cast the circle.Light the beeswax candle. Knot the piece of red cord and pass it over the candle, circling the base. Think of all that is passing and the sacrifices you have made. Give them up freely as you pass the red cord over the flame. Knot the green cord and pass it over the candle to lie on top of the red cord. This represents the achievements which will be built on your sacrifices – your harvest. Consecrate the wine and drink in honour of the Sun's power and your own achievements. Consecrate the bread and honey, and take them to the four corners saying:  'This is my offering;   This is my sacrifice.'  (Move round the circle deosil (clockwise) starting at North) Spread the honey on the bread. Eat and drink, communing with the season, saving some to put into the Earth as an offering later. Close the circle.   Mabon (22nd September)  Mabon is the Autumnal Equinox; a time of balance between darkness & light. But after this, the days will begin to grow shorter &amp; the nights will draw in earlier. As the second of the harvest festivals, we celebrate it with the many orchard fruits which are now in season.   On the Altar:  An ear of corn Dried leaves A deep purple candle Wine & bread   The Ritual:  Cleanse and cast the circle.Light the purple candle and think about the meaning of the season. Name the dried leaves for anything to be swept out of your life. Drop them deliberately to the floor to be swept up later (keep them to scatter into running water). Pick up the corn and say:  'The God has descended into the land.   Now he makes His journey into the Underworld.   Days grow dim, nights grow long, but we do not weep,   For behold, he has left his seed as a promise of his return!'  Take the corn and bread deosil (clockwise) round the circle, stopping at each corner and saying:  'This is the seed and this is my harvest.'  Direct healing thoughts towards any part of the world where there is famine. Eat the bread and drink to the Lord and Lady. Close the circle.   Seasonal Project:   Goddess Eye  A Goddess eye is said to watch over &amp; protect the home, & makes a wonderful gift for a like-minded friend. Making something yourself means it is very personal &amp; the effort put into it gives it that little bit extra power. Hang it in the window to catch the light.  Materials required:  2 sticks on roughly equal length Yarn or embroidery threads of various colours Scissors (to cut the threads of course!)  Method:  Make a slipknot on the end of the thread you will use for the centre of the cross & slide the loop over the 2 sticks. Once the thread is centred, pull the knot tight &amp; spread the stick arms out into the form of a cross. Wrap the thread diagonally over the centre twice for each side (NW-SE, then NE-SW) Start wrapping the thread around the sticks (moving deosil around the eye). Start at one point, move the thread over the stick, come round the back crossing over the front & move onto the next arm, keeping the thread tight. When you want to change to another colour, hide the knot at the back of the stick so the ends can't be seen. When you're finished, double-loop the thread over the last arm. You can decorate the ends of the arms with leather, beads or feathers – however you like. To hang the eye up, add a loop in the same colour as the thread nearest the outer edge, by pushing the ends through the eye (about an inch or so down the arm) from the front, then pushing the ends back through to the front again higher up, then tying a knot to form a loop. This should hold the eye upright when it's hung up.   Kitchen Witch   Herb Scented Flat Bread  This flatbread doesn't contain yeast, so it's quick and simple to make. You can substitute your favourite herbs for the ones suggested. A delicious recipe to use for ritual or any time. Makes 3.  Ingredients:  1 cup plus 3 tablespoons all-purpose flour 1/2 teaspoon baking powder 1/2 teaspoon salt 1 teaspoon finely chopped fresh sage 1 teaspoon finely chopped fresh chives 1 teaspoon finely chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley 2 1/2 tablespoons vegetable shortening 3 tablespoons milk 1/2 teaspoon coarse salt, for sprinkling 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil, for brushing  1. In the bowl of a food processor, combine the flour, baking powder, salt, sage, chives, and parsley; process for 5 seconds to combine. Add vegetable shortening and process until well combined, about 15 seconds. Add milk and 2 tablespoons water, and process until the dough comes together, about 7 seconds.  2. Transfer dough to a lightly-flowered surface and knead for about 1 minute, forming it into a ball. Cover with plastic wrap and let stand for 30 minutes.  3. Heat the over to 200° with a baking sheet set on the rack. Heat a medium cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat until very hot. Meanwhile, cut the dough into 3 equal pieces and form each piece into a ball. On a lightly floured surface, roll one of the pieces of dough out into a very thin circle (it should be less than 1/16 inch thick and about 6 1/2 inches in diameter). Using a fork, prick the dough 7 or 8 times. Lightly brush one side of the dough with olive oil and sprinkle it lightly with salt.  4. Transfer round of dough, with the oiled side down, to the hot skillet and reduce heat to medium; cook until surface is covered with golden to dark-brown speckles, about 1 to 2 minutes on each side. If the flatbread begins to burn, lower the heat and continue to cook.  5. Remove bread from skillet and transfer to the baking sheet in the oven. Repeat the rolling and cooking process with the remaining 2 pieces of dough.  6. Cut the bread into wedges with a pizza wheel or sharp knife, and serve warm.

						   Well, this weekend is going to me quadrupally special for me: Not only is it a full moon tomorrow night, but it is also a blue moon (the second full moon in a calendar month). Then on Sunday it is Lammas (one of the eight Sabbats in the Wheel of the Year) AND my first wedding anniversary!  Yes, one year ago, Dale & I both stood up in front of a bunch of our friends &amp; family to say words along the lines of "I do". Where has the time gone? It's quite literally flown by so fast that I can scarcely believe it. It certainly doesn't feel like a year already. It was odd enough last month when I realised that my best friend, Sarah, had been married a whole year (there was a whole spate of weddings last summer, you see!) & now it's MY turn. I can honestly say it's been fantastic so far, but people keep asking how it feels to be married &amp; all I can say is that it doesn't really feel any different to us than we did before! We were already living together & both knew we wanted to spend the rest of our lives together - it was just a case of formalising it &amp; making it legal. Perhaps I feel a little more secure now, but other than that, it's exactly the same. Just as well I was happy enough before, isn't it?  So, Dale & I are returning to the hotel where the deed was done, for dinner &amp; an overnight stay, with breakfast in bed, to celebrate.  Anyway, other than our anniversary, I have the other important celebration to think about - Lammas! A little information is possibly called for here, I suppose. Lammas is the first of the three harvest festivals (the fifth of the year as a whole) & is generally held on or around 1st August. It celebrates the harvesting of the first crops as well as the first fruition of projects begun at the start of the year - we reap as we sow. It is also known as Lughnassadh (pronounced Loo-nah-sah) - the feast of the God, Lugh, who is sacrificed as he is cut down with the corn &amp; reborn as the bread, providing food for all.  Some traditional associations are:  Traditional Foods:  Apples, Grains, Breads and Berries.  Herbs and Flowers:  All Grains, Grapes, Heather, Blackberries, Sloe, Crab Apples, Pears.  Incense:  Aloes, Rose, Sandalwood. Sacred GemstoneCarnelian.  Special Activities:  As summer passes, many Pagans celebrate this time to remember its warmth and bounty in a celebrated feast shared with family or Coven members. Save and plant the seeds from the fruits consumed during the feast or ritual. If they sprout, grow the plant or tree with love and as a symbol of your connection with the Lord and Lady. Walk through the fields and orchards or spend time along springs, creeks, rivers, ponds and lakes reflecting on the bounty and love of the Lord and Lady.  I've never been much of a one to go in for long rituals, so the one I use (when I use one at all) goes along these lines:   On the Altar:  Large beeswax candle Lengths of green & red cord Wine, bread &amp; honey   The Ritual:  Cleanse and cast the circle. Light the beeswax candle. Knot the piece of red cord and pass it over the candle, circling the base. Think of all that is passing and the sacrifices you have made. Give them up freely as you pass the red cord over the flame. Knot the green cord and pass it over the candle to lie on top of the red cord. This represents the achievements which will be built on your sacrifices – your harvest.  Consecrate the wine and drink in honour of the Sun's power and your own achievements. Consecrate the bread and honey, and take them to the four corners saying: 'This is my offering; This is my sacrifice.' (start at the North then move round the circle deosil) Spread the honey on the bread. Eat and drink, communing with the season, saving some to put into the Earth as an offering later. Close the circle.  I don't think I'll be performing a ritual this year, so I'll probably just spend some time outside, somewhere green, & meditate a while instead - the Lord &amp; Lady seem to be happy enough with that arrangement, so it should be more than enough.  I wish you all a special Blue Moon celebration &amp; a fruitful harvest this Lammas! Blessings, Mab.

						   Well, I've never run a blog before, but I guess a wee introduction would probably be the best place to start, so here goes:  I'm a 27 year old married female who happens to be a practicing solitary Witch & have been for around 13 years now. I've forged my own Path along the way; a Path I call Simple Witchery. So, what does that mean, exactly? Well, I boil everything down to its barest components & take out all the extraneous bumf &amp; hooha, so that what is left is the barest of essentials. I don't go in for big, fancy rituals & ceremonies - most of my magick takes place in the kitchen or the bathroom &amp; is very firmly based in the mundane - it's a part of my everyday life, not something I do on the weekends or a couple of evenings a month. I am very much interested in spellcraft - the science of magick - & also the artsy-craftsy side of it (ie making things to use as part of a spell, such as poppets, amulets, talismans, or just the little things like a bag to put all the components in!). I'm also very interested in the use of herbs in healing.  Outside of my Craft interests, I am an avid reader - everything from horror to fantasy, comedy to biography - I just devour them all! I also spend a fair bit of time writing, not just calligraphy (which I love), but I edit a small local Pagan newsletter (Triptych) &amp; also write a regular column for Dragonswood magazine. Music plays a huge part in my life - my husband plays guitar & sings, while I just sing - we spend a lot of time listening to rock &amp; metal music (our favourite band is Dream Theater). Movies are another shared interest - just about any genre you care to name is represented in our DVD collection.  And that's a brief introduction to ME. No doubt as I write more, more will be revealed...

						   Well, I've attempted, several times lately, to make an entry, but for some reason, the net seems to see me as the enemy lately & keeps booting me off without complying with my meagre requests!  Karl has begun work on the site construction for Lone Witch, so Esk & I will be getting together with him tomorrow night to work on the design &amp; layout some.  I can hardly wait to see these first stages complete & then move onto a working version so we can get started!  It's going to take quite a while to transfer all the existing files from the old Yahoo group to the new site & get all the existing members over there &amp; settled in.  Then we have to wait for the new members to start arriving...  Watched aprogramme on the Aberdeen Witch Trials this evening.  Although it didn't give much more information than I already knew, it was quite interesting & I've recorderd it for a pal in America who has a connection to Aberdeen &amp; the whole Witch Trials thing (that was how we met online, actually!).  I think he'll find it quite absorbing...  In between all this, I've begun a new regime - in an attempt to shift this last half stone to get to my target weight, I have started a fitness routine.  I originally decided on swimming twice a week & visiting the gym once a week too.  Unfortunately, my gym plans have been scuppered for now, as they aren't giving any more inductions for the equipment till the new term starts (so I'll have to wait a few weeks till all the students get back).  Anyway, I've been swimming twice this week & have realised that the only reason anyone LIKES exercising is that it feels so good when you STOP!  I never realised how blissful a shower could feel - sinking into a bath is usually my choice, but after a hard sesh in the pool, the shower feels like paradise!  "So, why don't you just use magick to get rid of the flab, Mab?" I hear the cynics cry!  Well, it's like this; I've always held that real Witchcraft is knowing when to use magick & when not to.  For instance, if I decided to just try & magick away the weight it couldn't work - you have to put in the effort.  Magick always takes the path of least resistance, so if you cast a spell to lose weight but then pig out, it ain't gonna work!  If, however, you put in the effort, cut down on the fat & do some exercise, then cast a spell to help keep you focused, enhance your willpower &amp; boost your energy, then you'd be onto a winner.  This is exactly what I've done & let me tell you, I'm feeling better than I've felt in a VERY long time.  I'm already feeling more energetic & although my arms ache from all the swimming, I'm already feeling healthier &amp; satisfied that I'm doing what I can to get into good shape.  Although it doesn't half get you knackered!

						    Well, that was my first week back at work & I discover the senior secretary is pregnant, so come February, I'll have even MORE work to contend with! Been rushed off my feet all week long &amp; am SO glad it's Friday night now & I have the whole weekend at my disposal. So, what shall I do with my time?  Well, this Witch has decided she's getting a little flabby &amp; could do with some toning up, so I've decided to check out the gym facilities at the University along with the pool there. I'll be dragging poor Esk up there to check it out with me too. Have decided on an action plan: I will swim twice a week on Tuesday & Thursday nights after work, &amp; go to the gym on Saturdays. That way I'll be nice & trim by Yule &amp; able to wear a slinky little number for New Year - HURRAH!  "So, why don't you just use Magick to fight your flab, Mab?" I hear the cynics sneer! Well, I've always thought that Witchcraft is about knowing WHEN to use magick & when NOT to. The thing about Magick is that it follows the path of least resistance, so if you're not willing to put in the work, you'll get nowhere very fast! So, I'll go to the gym &amp;amp; work my butt off & maybe part way through, when I'm getting bored &amp; sick of it, I'll do a little something to strengthen my resolve & give my willpower an extra boost - THAT'S the most effective way to do it (from my own past experience, that is!). Plus, this way I get to buy myself a new swimming costume &amp; a cute little work-out outfit too - LOL!  I'm going to ask Karl about doing a session on the new site tomorrow night too. I'd like to see how we're progressing & get an estimate on when things should be ready to test out. Reckon Esk will want to come round for that too - we're both just so excited about the whole project!  Then on Sunday, I think I shall have a rest - kick back &amp; watch a movie on our new wide-screen TV & shiny new DVD player with Dale, &amp; generally do nothing much at all. I reckon I deserve a rest after the week I've had!  Another thing today was the discussion over at Lone Witch about it being Friday 13th - we're any of us superstitious about it or did we feel more unlucky on that day? The resounding answer, overall, was a big "NO!". Personally, I've always rather LIKED Friday 13th! I've always been rather fond of the number 13 anyway &amp; Friday is practically the weekend, so what's NOT to like? So, I've never felt more unlucky on Friday 13th than any other day - I see no reason for it.  And I'm not afraid to walk under ladders either - LOL!

						   So, Esk came round this evening & we discussed our plans for the new Lone Witch site with my hubby &amp; bruv-in-law, just throwing around our options on how to include everything we want to be part of the new site. Ended up with both of them saying they'd have a go to see what they could come up with, so we'll have a choice to look at - hurrah!  It's all getting rather exciting now, knowing that pretty soon we'll have a site to call our own. Of course, all this means that we will effectively be going "back to school" to learn how to maintain the site & sort out all those little problems that are bound to crop up. Really, it's going to have to be the simplest possible format as we're both complete thickies when it comes to the net (kind of strange that 2 such techno-inepts should decide to build their own site!).  Anyway, after being friends for 15 years now, Esk &amp; I are discovering that we really DO think alike & are coming up with the same ideas at the same time &amp; kind of freaking out the boys a little by completing each other's sentences & speaking at the same time. Well, after that amount of time in each other's company, I suppose this kind of thing has to be expected really. We've started looking at styles of layouts &amp; ideas for artwork now - by the time we're done, this site is going to be HUGE!!!  Better think about getting some sleep as tomorrow will be a very busy day in Aberdeen - the International Children's Festival is on, it's Tartan Day, the International Market will be there, the circus is in town along with the God Squad down at the beach. And Esk &amp; I are also going on one of the Haunted Aberdeen tours tomorrow afternoon, so all in all, a pretty packed day full stop!

						   Well, I've registered a domain name for Lone Witch & building of the site will commence as of tonight!  Esk & I have wanted to do this for quite some time, but now that the domain name is registered, it feels a lot more 'real' - like it's actually going to happen at long last.  No longer will be have to put up with the finicky Ya-hell!  We'll be setting up forums, files, calander, database, etc, & it will be all-singing, all-dancing!  A whole new beginning for the Lone Witch Group - we'll be able to expand & do anything we please with it.  I'm so excited I've practically been jumping up & down non-stop since last night!  It'll be a hard slog, but worth it in the long run, I reckon...

						   Well, after a lovely weekend celebrating so much, here I am, back at my computer once more. The Lammas/Mabon issue of Dragonswood magazine is now on the shelves in our local Pagan shop (I've had to buy a spare copy to send to my mother as my 1st column appears in it &, to my delight &amp; surprise, is credited on the front cover!). So, now I have to begin work on the NEXT column in time for the Samhain/Yule issue. Well, I say 'being', it just needs proof reading & tightening up a bit &amp; it's good to go!  I've updated the Lone Witch sister site  urlLink http://www.lonewitch.blinks.net/  & also my own personal site  urlLink http://www.mabon-online.blinks.net/  ready for Mabon which is the next holiday on the Wheel of the Year, &amp; now I must get cracking on the Mabon issue of Triptych so I can get it on the shelves at Kabbalah in plenty of time.  Kabbalah is our local Pagan shop, run by Elaine & has many wondrous goodies for the discerning Witch in Aberdeen. Actually, its the only shop of its type in the city at the moment &amp; it has everything from herbs & incense to books &amp; altar tools. Not only that, but the staff are wonderful too - always ready for a friendly chat on any subject under the sun. I remember interviewing Elaine for an early issue of Triptych (back when it didn't have a name & was just the Lone Witch Newsletter) &amp; she said she didn't think they'd do an online shop at all, but now, things have changed, &amp; she has a lovely little site for ordering all the things you might want online:  urlLink http://www.kabbalahshop.co.uk/   Lastly of all, I have prepared for the coming Sabbat (which is my namesake) by creating a whole new look for myself. Gone are the long blonde locks - replaced by a short, choppy crop with which I am delighted. So, now that my head is no longer bogged down by the weight of all that hair, perhaps I shall be inspired to write something really special for Triptych!
