      Another long day at work....... Worked in a new hospital today called Anaheim Memorial, it was ok, busy pretty relaxed atmosphere with nice doctors. I would have had a great day if I wasn't so nauseated. I didn't have as much food with me as usual so i felt pretty sick most of the day. Luckily i discharged all my patients one hour before the end of my shift so they sent me home.   More news today about the bombings in Madrid. I am very convinced now that it most likely wasn't the Basque separatists but more likely some fundamentalist arabic group because of the nature of this attack. Eta usually does not target civilians and when they have in the past they've always appologized. Usually their acts are on a much smaller scale. Also the group that is claiming responsibility (an "AL Qeada" associate group) sounds like they have some serious beef to pick with us westerners such as "We don't care about your civillians because you don't care about our children in Afghanistan, Palestine, Iraq, and Kashmir. "   anyway it is super late and i'm really tired. i'm going to bed.   later

      March 12, 2004  I just got back from work where it was really slow today. Unlike normal they put me in pediatrics and I started an awesome IV on a 2 month old kid. Normally I feel nervous with peds IVs but I think I'm getting better.  I was shocked to hear about the train bombings in Madrid today. Almost 200 people dead! It is a huge tragedy, one of enormous magnitude for a country like Spain. What makes me even more appaled is the news media here in the united states-- allowing a total of about 50 sec of coverage on this disaster on the evening news and almost 15 min of coverage about the legalization of gay marriage... How could you sympathize with Americans when tragedy strucks them when they don't give a shit about the world.... We should be having vigils and lighting candles for the victims, we should be putting up Spanish flags and saying prayers for the families who lost their loved ones. We should at least honor them they way they honored us when tragedy struck. The immediate response of the US team was "Al Qeada is behind it" trying to support their further war on terror and justification for all they are doing in front of the international community. I was convinced that this was not Al Qeada but the Basques who have been terrorizing the Spanish for years. It wasn't until i heard the BBC tonight that I actually heard that the spanish media and government is blaming it on the Basques too. This is an important day for all europeans and my heart and mind goes out to them.   I couldn't believe it, but tonight, while i was walking Denali, my black lab, he dug up a whole in the ground, which he does frequently and suddenly I noticed he had something in his mouth and began to chew it. IT turned out he captured and killed a mole! I couldn't believe his skill. IT was impressive.   Another happening of the day is that I spoke with one of the patients, moms at work who had spina bifida,a  congenital disorder in children in which the spinal cord doesn't truly close. They end up having either hydrocephalus (fluid in the brain) or are paralyzed from the waist down, or have some other spinal deficiency. This little girl had hydrocephalus and had to have a shunt that was draining the fluid out of her brain. She also had little function of her legs. IT was really sad to see. I spoke with the mom about what the doctors told her when the baby was born... she said it isn't genetic but more related to some kind of definciency in pregnancy such as not enough folic acid in the diet, or sitting in a heated pool or eating tortillas?? I thought the latter was a little crazy. It made me a little freaked about my diet and thinking about if I am doing everything right. I feel like I'm eating well and generally pretty healthy. One can only live in the now.   those are all my thoughts for tonight. Hope everyone has sweet dreams right now as it is 2am here.

      REVIEW OF LAST YEAR IN A NUT SHELL:   For those of you who are super far away and don't frequently get updates here's what's been happening with me.  In August of 2002 I met Troy Norman at work. He was a traveling nurse and came to the Northwest to work for a few months. Him and I became friends and went out a couple of times. Unfortunately he broke his ankle while climbing one day at Lewis and Clark park and had to stop working. This placed him in a difficult financial situation so he moved back to Sacremento where he had close friends. I said goodbye and left for my european trip. I had a great time there touring through the UK, France, Italy, Austria, Germany, Netherlands, Greece and Turkey. I met a lot of travelers, mainly Aussies and Kiwis and had a great time. My favorite spot was #1 Paris, #2 Venice #3 Pisa. When I came back to the US some inkling told me to go visit Troy in San Francisco for Holloween. Besides that it was a "wicked" party as the Kiwis say, it was also a special time for Troy and I because the spark that we had felt previously glow, grew stronger and it started a flame. I left and went back home while Troy continued his recovery in Cally. He vowed to return to the Northwest however (I was a big part of that). In December he recieved the ok of the MD to walk without crutches and in January moved to Portland. In February we went to Costa Rica together and met Bart and Rhonda, Troy's friends from Arkansas (where he's from). We spend two great weeks together and had a magical time. Troy surprised me and asked me to marry him there.. We got married at sunset on a beautiful beach in Manuel Antonio. OUr friend Bart Rankin married us after he became a minister online :-) The deal was officially sealed in the US when we got our marriage license in Washington. But our wedding in Costa Rica was the true moment for us.   We had a busy summer filled with trips to: Arkansas (where i met the in-laws and friends), Yosemite, Hawaii, Vancouver Island (4 day kayaking trip), and other trips to southern Oregon and Northern California shasta area where we had an awesome camping night and an attempt to climb at Castle Crags which didn't happen because the weather was too hot. We also had a reception party for our wedding back home where we had lots of friends and family come and celebrate. It was a true Bulgarian/American bash.   In October Troy and I moved to Southern California where we came to work for the winter and thus make more money. We left our apartment in Vancouver, dumped all our stuff in my parent's garage and moved into our 22 ft travel trailer. We bought a Toyota truck so that we could pull the trailer and that worked out well. Living in southern california is VERY expensive and we're saving tons of money by living in the trailer. Amazingly it has been pretty nice and simple. I thought it would take a huge adjustment to get used to such a small space but it has been great. There's less space so the cleanup is really easy. However, stuff gets compiled rather quickly. I am amazed that we've been able to live like this. I have to admit that I look forward to living in a house again and having a big kitchen and a dish washer. (spoiled american I've become).   Southern California's traffic drives me completely crazy..... I can't write enough about that. I am determined to leave this place as soon as we get the chance, which so far the plan is at the end of May.   In January we had our friends Bart and Rhonda visit with their new son Jackson!! Being around that little creature made me realize that I'm really not ready to be a mother. But God must think otherwise because the following month on Feb 19th I found out I was pregnant!! It came a few days after our 1 yr anniversary on the 11th which we celebrated in Ensenada, Mexico. I was actually visiting my friends June and Andre in San Diego when I found out! I told them that I was scared that I might be and Andre immediately began to tease me that I am for sure. Well I took a pregnancy test that night and it was ambiguous... at first it was negative, then it was positive... urgh... it was a nightmare trying to figure out what I was. The next day I got a different brand of test and it was for sure positive.  When I told Troy he was very shocked and quite dissapointed... Him and I had just talked about waiting a few more years before we have children. Over the weeks since, he's come to peace with this new change and is trying to embrace the thought and be fully positive, although i know it was hard on him. He was one of those people who wasn't sure if he ever wanted kids. I guess God has a different plan for his life than he envisioned.   All of our friends and family are very excited about this news and eager to see us come home. I am also eager to go back to Washington and settle in. We are going to buy my parent's house in June and live with them until next March when they will move back to Bulgaria for their retirement. We are glad about this opportunity to be together, even though it's very un-American to live with your in-laws, i think it's very good for family bonding. Troy feels good about this, knowing that this is the best financial decision for us. I think it will take some time for him to feel quite comfortable, like he is in his own house, but such is life.. Many people live this way and in even worse conditions.   We will probably live in Vancouver for a couple of years but eventually we will move away from the rain. A couple of our thougths are either moving to Colorado or North Carolina. Time will tell and as these decisions come closer I will write commentary on them.   As far as pregnancy now, I am approximately 7 weeks along, haven't seen a doctor and don't plan on seeing one until later (2nd trimester). Everything is going fine, I have my day's dose of nausea but i can say I have found the cure for it: FOOD. If I eat when I feel nauseated I am fine. THe key is to get my blood sugar up. So, I don't eat a lot, but I do eat every 2 hours-strict!!! I have to or else.... I am proud that I've only thrown up once so far and that was the very first day when the nausea came on really strong and I didn't know anything.   Troy and I have a feeling it will be a female child. we will be happy with whoever God gives us. I plan on being as active as possible through this pregnancy and eating healthy in order to give my child a chance of a healthy life too. It truly saddens me when I see obese infants and children coming through the ER. It's a great shame.   Speaking of ER, right now we are working in Orange County at St. Joseph hospital which is also the ER for the children's hospital of orange county so we see lots of sick kids. It's a bit nervy seeing really sick kids because your mind suddenly opens to all the horiffic possibilities. But one thing that helps me now is living in the present and taking each moment as a gift. we can't anticipate tomorrow's problems because we will never learn to deal with todays.   And today everything is beautiful and perfect, just the way it is supposed to be. I am grateful for everything I have in my life and everyone who has enriched it deeply. We can never know what will happen next... Troy and I were reflecting on how 5 years ago neither one of us would have pictured ourselves in this place and in this time the way we are now... so who is to say what will be in 5 yrs?   Thank you for reading this... It's a glimpse of my life and I hope that you are blessed by it.   "What lies behind us and what lies before us are tiny matters compared to what lies within us."

      I am writing from Davis, CA. Troy and I are on our way up to Washington. We just got back from Arkansas and north carolina and the next day we decided to bust it. No warning, no preconcieved notions, just one simple "let's go". We did not like SoCal High(the big high school of southern california), and lately the temperatures were getting pretty rediculous so it was time to go. We are visiting some friends in the Sacremento area right now, conveniently at the same time that Troy had some business to finish up in this area. We will be back in Portland next week and we can't wait. We will be living with my parents for the next few months... we look forward to this new change of pace. I can't wait to get some good food in portland and to get out in the Gorge and go up some pretty mountains. Also, i am hoping that the work situation won't be too difficult. I plan on working with a staffing agency. we'll see how it goes.   I hope everyone is doing well.

      Greetings.   I am writing from Fayeteville, Arkansas. Troy and I are visiting friends. We went to a wedding yesterday. It was ok, but we really don't know the people there very well so it was a little weird. we survived it though. Today we met some of Troy's college friends, they had a mini reunion and we had a nice visit, they are vrey nice folks.  I'm finidng out that I really love the people form the south. There's just a different culture here... really hospitable, really homie and friendly folk. They are just well meaning and kind and open. Life here has a totaly different pace. It's slower, more relaxed and simple... I love it!! Total contrast to southern california. People are not in a hurry and not everything's about making more money. I am glad that I had the chance to see this part of the country.  Tomorrow Troy and I are going to drive through Tenessee and into North Carolina, about a 12 hour trip. We will spend a week in Asheville. I am looking forward to visiting there and potentially some day moving there. I can't wait to live in a calmer, more peaceful place.   I've been thinking about people and friendships lately. It occured to me that there are 2 types of people: givers and recievers. What I mean by that is not in material literal terms but in temperamental and world view terms.  There are those people who inquire about other people and integrate with others very easily. When they come into a party they inquire about everybody else and try to understand from other's point of view. Whereas, there are those people who cannot change their world view and only offer it up to others and cannot integrate as easily with different than themselves people (and ultimately are uncomfortable with them). The former are the recievers and the latter are the givers. I think Troy and I are definitely recievers and I think we definitely make good friends because we listen and try to relate to people's experience. But other people are only givers they cannot understand the world from other's point of view and simply do not wish to. THey are the types of people that when we talk to them it's 90% of the time about them and 10% maybe about you.   anyway just a random thought that has occured lately.   I will write more later.! Ciao Yana

      I am back!! At least for a few short lines. I don't have internet at home anymore so it's really hard to write anywhere because i never have time.... enough said about that....  Right now I'm at work and it's not busy so I have a few minutes.   Last month has been really busy. My mom and dad came to visit us at the end of March, it was nice to see them. I took them to San Diego for 2 days. I think they were really tired at the end of it all. I think they enjoyed it but overall I don't think they were that incredibly impressed. Maybe it was my fault cos I rushed them too much.    Later in the month Troy and i went up to Mt. Whitney area and climbed up to lower boy scout lake which is an area where Norm and him buried some gear in the snow in attempt to climb up Mt. Russel. Because of heavy snow fall the gear (tents, jackets, cooking wear, climbing gear, etc...) had been buried even deeper. This was Troy's 3ed attempt at recovering the stuff by digging it out but we were unsuccessful again. The snow was too deep and we didn't find anything. We used an avalanche probe and we found nothing.... Troy thinks that someone stole the stuff because he was sure that we should have found it.... I guess our friend Norm will have to look for it in the summer.   The next day we drove to Death Valley and played in the Eureka sand dunes. They are the biggest sand dunes in North America. It was nice and sunny and really pretty.  The sad news is that the following day I had to come to the ER as a patient because I had a miscarriage. It was a really sad experience and a very painful one. I wanted to stay home and go through it there but the pain got too intense and I needed some really strong pain killers. I felt like I was giving birth (and I sort of did). It was a bummer because we don't have medical insurance so i kept thinking at home expensive it's all going to be, on top of the fact that i had to be a big pain to Troy. But overall it went ok... I am doing well now. I took a week off of work.  The following week we had some friends visit us from Washington. They have 2 kids so we went to Disneyland (which is only like 15 min from our house), then we showed them Hollywood and later we went to Idylwild which is a nice little village town in Eastern california where Troy and our friend Boyan climbed for a few hours on some beautiful rocks. Overall it was a very nice visit but our friends are probably very tired just as we are.  It feels like life is a whirwind lately.  This week we are leaving for Arkansas. We will be there for 2 wks on vacation where we will attend a friend's wedding. Half of the time we will be in North Carolina in Asheville, just to meet Troy's old friends, check out the work situation there and potentially think about moving and living there. Asheville sounds appealing for many reasons: It's got beautiful countryside, lots of outdoor stuff to do, it's reasonably affordable, it has a really nice culture (alternative hippy culture) Anyway I'll update this later. Hope everyone is doing well.   luv to all yana

      It's 3 am... i have returned from work a few hours ago and finally have time to write a few lines. i started this blog with the intention of reflecting back on my life and recording the highlights and important moments... like a diary. I'm finding that it's easy to write about the physical events but much more dificult to actually reflect... perhaps it is because i'm always writing when i'm very tired. i suspect that in the future this may change.   lately i have been a silent observer of the political events. it really saddens me to watch the politics get in the way of the principles of this country... those who rule it seem more concerned about their power than justice, truth, international cooperation and respect and internal peace.... i keep thinking how close we are to the Brave New World and 1984.  In oder to ease my mind I've decided to read some Herman Hesse... he makes the world seem a lot more colorful and inspiring.   I see good things on the horizon for our immediate life... Troy and I are working thank God regularly now... pay is good. living with mom and dad hasn't been easy for him because he is very independent but he's becoming better. i think Denali fully enjoys it too... he gets a lot of love and attention.   i am blessed to have a good job and work with good people and have an awesome family.  every day i should be thanking God for every perfect gift... every breath is a gift.   and every sleep is precious.... so i must catch mine now...  off to never never land..................zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz  amore

      I'm writing from Home!!! It's so beautiful here in washington and I'm so glad to be home. I cleaned up the bedroom where Troy and I will be living for the next year. I rearranged it and it looks nice now. It will be a slight adjustment living with my parents, but the situation is really good in general.   I already walked in the park twice and it has been such a refreshment! I can feel that my whole body and spirit are relaxing now and getting back to normal.   I look forward to many nights of reading good books and not thinking about anything.   it's good to be home...  I enjoyed driving back alone from sacremento. I really felt like I was coming into a new phase of my life and it will be a good one.   it is way past my bed time so I better go now.

      Do you ever feel like there are a million things going on in your life? And do you ever feel like there is nothing there?? I feel that imbiguity from time to time....  I don't know why I lack energy lately... I am only 25, yet I feel like I'm 45! I think a lot has happened in the last few months.   I look forward to getting back to running, mountain climbing, weight lifting and yoga over the summer. yet our schedule is so full. Next we go to Oregon Country Fair which is supposed to be phenomenal (not like a county fair but a big time music, food, arts, dance event). A couple weeks after that we're headed down to Big Sky Montana for wilderness medicine training and a week in Yellowstone. That should be awesome.  Last weekend Troy and I painted the house. It looks fairly modern and colorful now. we are trying to create a feel that appeals to us.    I enjoy working on our house but it does take a lot of time and work!! People are correct when they tell you that the projects around a house are endless.  Poor June in San Diego, I can sympathise with her!!  I must go to bed now because I have only 6 hrs of sleep before I have to go to work....

      Here I am writing again at 3 in the AM. It always seems to happen at these late hours of the night...  The deal with our house is finally coming through... we are buying it at a lower and better rate than earlier...We're expecting to close on it at the end of this week!! I'm very excited about that.   Troy and I will finally have some together time at the end of this week! I'm very glad about that because we've been apart a lot lately and that's put a strain in our relationship. Last week our friend Bart visited from Arkansas and they both went kayaking for a few days. That put me in a funky mood... felt separated and disconnected.   otherwise everything is going well....  except one thing kinda bothered me tonight. i was at work and the manager of the ER where i work asked me to do my evaluation. basically she brought out some things that i thought were unfounded. she said that I had a sort of "cavalier" attitude... she said that i appear to be comfortable  (and maybe too comfortable) there. She gave me the example of me and another guy standing around and talking yesterday, while our other partner was running around with 2 ICU patients. The truth was that I was helping that team mate and when she was getting ready to admit them the other guy and I talked for like 5 min at the nursing station. it so happens that she must have seen us then.  The truth is that most of the time i work pretty hard and try to get my patients quickly moved out of the ER. I don't chit chat that much and I usually am always available for the patients. SO i don't accept people's one time observation as telling me that i need to change my attitude... I think I am a good team player most of the time. The other thing that she alluded to was that I look like I'm comfortable and maybe I'm not trying to be nice... or be extra helpful.... I don't know what that BS exactly means.... Like I should be kissing ass more because i'm new?? I try to help all my team mates... I wish that she would ask the nurses that I wokr with what they think of me.. (she's hardly ever there and if she is, she doesn't directly work with me). The thing is that I see lots of nurses chit chatting at the nurses' station and nothing is said to them.   that's besides the point.... I am working there as an agency nurse so my conduct is extra scrutinized I guess... If her observations were actually accurate I would try to find a way to change myself but I feel like they are not based in true reality. They are based on some veyr minute times and very little actual data.   the main thing that pissed me off though was that she brought up another scenerio which had happened earlier in the day.  what had happened was this: There is a resident that works there (resident means a doctor who is in their 3 years of practicum before they can practice independently). She is this blond, assertive and a little prissy resident from OHSU. I haven't had any problems with her except a little occasional bossy attitude (for example, "could you ask her who that patient's doctor is and tell me?" when she can very well do that herself by just peaking in the patients door and asking... I have a shit load of things to do and that's something that doesn't really concern me, so it's a lot of little things like that that she does). Anyway, so today I get this patient who had been in earlier that day for chest pain and he had been discharged. Well he came back because he was having more chest pain. In every hospital that you go there is a protocol for starting nitroglycerin. I had a nitro spray (which is a spray you give them under their tongue) or the other way to do it is the little pill you put under their tongue. Since I had the spray I just gave the guy the spray because he was having chest pain and his pressure was high. So then I fininshed with that and this resident pulled me outside and asked, "Why did you give him the spray?" And I said, "Because I had it on me... There's no difference between the spray and the pill so I just gave him what I had, is that a problem?" And then she said, "Well, I would just rather you wait till I see the patient before you give him any medications." To which I said, "He was having chest pain and we have a protocol for cardiac chest pain, which includes giving nitro, so that's what I did, did you want me to not give it??" And she said, "I would have rather you wait because he's not cardiac." Her latest comment was totaly false because he was totaly cardiac... meaning, the reason for his pain was from a cardiac origin. He was later admited to a telemetry floor with cardiac admission orders... So I had a feeling the whole thing was a power play.  Well this whole anectode was for the sake of illustrating what the manager later told me. She said that she had spoken to this resident and that the issue was that I used the spray instead of the little pill. She informed me that I should not use the spray but that I should use the pill because that's what our protocol states. That pissed me off because there is not difference between the spray and the pill... I went around and asked everyone that I work with later... both doctors and nurses and none of them could come up with a difference or a reason why one should be used instead of the other.  The whole issue is a non-issue. Meaning... it's so stupid and so pointless and so not relevant so why would my manager bring it up?? It's a power play. The whole issue is my attitude. Because I am firm about what I say. I act as though I know what I'm doing. The resident wants to feel like she is the one calling the shots and the manager feels like I act like I'm too comfortable there.... What kind of psychological power play am I in??   I think I will try to play subserviant next time and put a happy smile when I see that manager but as soon as my contract ends in a couple weeks not make any plans to return... that's absolute BS crap that I have to go through. Every place that I've worked people have liked me and appreciated what I do. I feel that the people here also appreciate me, but not when it comes to that management. Unfortunately as an agency person you can't defend yourself.   anyway that was my day today.   I thought to post a really cute picture of Troy who LOVES kayaking. He has such a bright look on his face when he is in the water... This picture was taken a few years ago!!!

      I am writing on a sunny day in this very rainy Washington. we finally got a beautiful weekend and I wasn't ready for doing the infamous garage sale that I need to do soon. We have a garage full of garbage that needs to GO!! In the process of getting my parent's stuff out and ours in it requires that we do a lot of sifting. It's a big pain in the rear.   besides thinking about home improovement and working, i've been going back to Yoga. I needed it like the flowers need water... my body feels very stiff and yoga is the recepie for a wholistic life. i feel so alive and so aware of myself when I practice... i truly feel like i found the one thing in this life that can stay with me forever... there is SOO much to the practice, one can continue to uncover his whole life.   i love being in the northwest. what a beautiful place i live in. there is so much here......    though our move back home has been needed and wanted for so long we are having a few bumps along the road. Troy is having a very difficult time with living with my parents. He is a very independent american and it is very hard for him to share space with others (for prolonged period of time). He likes to have the space his way and this cohabitation and mostly organization of the house according to my parents' style is really eating him up. He has become moody and distant.. this reflects on me and so i get moody and mostly pissed off at him because it I think he should just get over it and get used to it. But if there is any once of sympathy in me I konw it will just take time and we will all adjust. My parents feel it too because they feel he is distant and tries to leave whenever possible. My friend Maya and I were just talking today about how americans have a much harder time with that than we do. to us it's really no big deal... we've learned to share things and to communicate with our family and to get pissed off when we feel like it and to express our frustrations instead of keeping them inside and skirting around the issues. Also, because in our culture people frequently share small spaces together it's really not a big sacrifice to live with someone else...and thank goodness it's your family and not some strangers... Also, i have a much closer relationship with my parents than Troy does with his parents and that also plays a factor... he always says that he would much rather live with mine than his... I can see why this is true. yet i know it's not easy for the champ to get right into it and feel ok with everything. it will just take time. at least him and I can talk about it openly and discuss the issues. in time, we will learn to talk about it with my parents openly too.  Our friend Bart is visiting right now and Troy is off to Wenachee for a week.... i can't really pitty him because he always gets to do what he wants.  hope all is well with every one of my friends.............  Yana

      Wow, it's been so long since I've written in my blog. That goes to show how infrequently I actually reflect on life's events which is very sad... I wish to do more of it. I was hoping that when I moved back home I would be able to do so more. Unfortunately i've been quite busy here too.  Working full time really kicks your butt. At least mine. 12 hrs on my feet just stomps me at the end of the day... all I want to do is lay down.... pathetic of me, considering some people have done that for years.  The other day I woke up really emotional for some reason.... I missed my mom and dad and my family was very dear to me... I hugged and kissed them... When I got to work I was feeling irritable too... it must be PMS. I get it pretty bad sometimes. But I'm always thankful that emotions exists because they help us understand our affections and relationships better sometimes, just as well as they can distort them. However, when I feel emotional i feel alive. I feel full of energy (weather good or bad). I think that's why churches and spiritual groups and especially the pentecostal movement has touched so many lives--because people's emotions are a powerful force. They can create a reality.   For the most part I am emotion free... lately anyway... very blank... monotonous existence.. the daily grind: treat that chest pain, start that IV, call the transporter, assess that abdominal pain, call Xray, send to Cat Scan, check that ambulance in, give Morphene to room 7, etc.... Over and over again. at the end of the day what have I really done??? moved some patients through an ER. The most significant thing I've done these last 24 hours of working have been talking with a 67 year old male who was recently released from prison after serving 10 years for armed robbery. As he put it, "Someone stole something from me and I just decided to get it back and I got caught." We chatted for a long time. He confirmed the rumors that there are rapes in prison of young inmates. He told me about working in prison and earning $52 a month and buying toiletries. We later spoke about politics. He had been in the Korean war. Doesn't like to speak much about it, but I could tell he had lived through much. This man had no bitterness, anger or even dependence against society and had no animosity toward anyone (maybe just a little against Bush). He thanked me for talking and I realize now that he and I will probably remember that conversation. He reminded me that life is about perception: we can choose how to look at it.   The other important moment was talking with a 21 year old anorexic girl today. We spoke about life and self-image and what's important.. very brief and insignificant... yet important and a moment I will remember.  So little of my work is memorable. Yet it serves a purpose. Lately I've really been thinking about starting another path.... I would love to study a social science... anthropology or sociology... I almost naively whish that something would jump out at me... an idea, an opportunity... perhaps it will and now is not the right time? I don't know.   Lately I don't see Troy much. Our schedules seem to intersect few times. IT seems weird now because up till last month we spent practically every living hour of the day together... perhaps time apart will build appreciation and desire for each other (which we already have). I know that i'm not keen on it quite yet. We'll see what happens in July when we goes off for a whole month out to sea... it will be yet a growing experience.   There is so much to write...so much to express... I've gotten out of the habit. I really enjoy writing because I can express much better through it. Yet here I am unable to think what else to say... How else to explain all that has been going on. I think I will stop here and if there is something significant it will have to be added later.   Now I'm going to retire with my book "Demonic Males-Apes and the Origins of Human Violence" a wonderful anthropology text!!! I've been laughing my ass off!!   love all

      This last Tuesday we went on a hike in the Mt. Adams wilderness. We walked about. 10 miles. At the end of our hike there was a nice lake where Troy and Denali soaked for about 2 min... we had to quickly move because the mosquitos were viscious!! I have about 40 bites!!  In our past time, Troy and I like to be outside in nature and enjoy the beautiful northwest weather.  We're working the rest of this week because we have two long weeks ahead in Yellowstone.   I worked at Kaiser tonight and had fun. The people there are very sweet. (some are a little rough around the edges but that makes them cool too). I liked the flow there.  The other night Troy and I went to a party with people from Meridian Park Hospital and that was cool too, he works with very sweet folks. I look forward to working more with them.   Along with all that, I'm in the process of desputing some claims that Providence Hospital made against me... all having to do with my attitude. It came as a surprise because I usually have pretty good attitude (but you know we all have our days). I'm learning that people's subjective perception has a lot to do with the conclusions they make about you professionaly. Isn't that a total bummer? You've worked hard all these years to educate yourself, to gain experience and learn the ins and outs of different systems and you come accross someone who just doesn't like your personality or has something "personal" against you and you're screwed. That shouldn't happen.   Anyway, i won't give too much detail here but basically i'm going to fight this kind of injustice.  I better to go sleep...  Everything is awesome otherwise. I have an awesome family and friends and life is good! Love all Yana  &nbsp;

      Just came back from the Oregon Country Fair. We had a great weekend. Bart and Rhonda and Jackson were visiting from Arkansas and we all&nbsp; took a week off for the venture down to Eugene and Bend. It was awesome! Words can't describe all that was seen and felt. The fair was a very wild event. It was a great conglomeration of art, music, dance and costumes of all&nbsp;sorts. People were free to do everything their heart desired. Everyone looked happy and peaceful and it felt like one large community of hippies. Beyond the fair, the weather and the town was very nice. We went on a small hike and took pictures of the surrounding area. Once we finished with Eugene we headed down to Bend, where we camped near Smith Rock. Troy and Bart climbed two days at Smith, while Rhonda and I tried to stay in the shade while watching Jackson.  It was nice to get away from home and do a few days of truck camping....  &nbsp; Now I'm back and looking forward to our next adventure in Yellowstone and Grand Teton National Park (coming up in 2 weeks).  Stay tuned for more pics! &nbsp; &nbsp;

      I just got done reading June's poetry on Joyce's website and i thought it was very beautiful. It's amazing how poetry can reveal so much passion and emotion... I wish I could write. I have found that i am able to put lyrics to songs that sound good, but I seldom apply myself to the task. I felt so strange today.... Isolated and alone. As I was driving to work I began to almost panic.. it was a strange feeling. As soon as I got around others I was ok... I have never had that happen before. Lately I feel melancholy, something deep happening within me and hard to understand what. Sometimes I wish I could have had a sibling to share thoughts with.  I must go now because we finally got our 1 patient in the ER after 3 hours of no patinents  will elaborate later on these thoughts
