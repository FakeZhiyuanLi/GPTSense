       urlLink    He's right you know. Heterosexuals have it so much easier than homosexuals. We can go down the street hand in hand with out significant other without any fear of scorn while they are forced to show affection in secret for fear that they may get hurt for doing something that comes naturally to them. &nbsp; urlLink

       urlLink    Emma loves...Manny? I've never been a femmeslash kind of gal, but that WOULD explain why she got so upset that Craig was over that night they went to the rave together...and that also could be the real reason she didn't kiss Chris that night. Maybe since Manny got pregnant with Craig's child, Emma dated Chris to make her jelous. Wow...this show has so many hidden relationships that I didn't even consider.&nbsp; urlLink

      Degrassi; The Next Generation is one of the few shows on modern television that gives veiwers a look into what the life of an average teenager is like. Nobody has superpowers, each character makes mistakes, they get nervous asking their crushes on dates, fight with their friends, and have plenty of problems of their own. This show deals with important issues such as rape, underage drinking, drug use, cutting, eating disorders, homosexuality, religious tolerance, child abuse, teenage pregnancy, abusive relationships, divorce, and many other issues that are relevant in the lives of teenagers across the globe. The flaws that are present in all the characters make the show seem very real, and veiwers are able to relate not only to the situations, but to the people as well. No more of this Lizzie McGuire perfect "We'll learn out lesson and be friend's forever by the end of the episode" bull crap! Degrassi shows real life. Friends will fall apart, hearts will get broken, and people will make mistakes---and guess what?! It's not always ok in the end. In fact, it rarely is. This website is a small tribute to Marco Del Rossi and Dylan Michalchuck, the shows resident homosexual couple, but I will also be posting things about my other two favorite characters Paige Michalchuck (yes, she IS Dylan's younger sister) and her boyfriend Spinner Mason in addition to things concerning the show in general, and also just some random blabbing that I'm prone to take part in.   Until I post again, I remain eventually yours,  Alysa  DEGRASSI THEME SONG   Whatever it takes I know I can make it through. If I hold out (If I do) I know I can make it through. I can be the best (The best that I can be. Here what I say to you.) Whatever it takes (I can do it) I know I can make it through (I know I...) I know I can make it through   Long live Marco and Dylan!
