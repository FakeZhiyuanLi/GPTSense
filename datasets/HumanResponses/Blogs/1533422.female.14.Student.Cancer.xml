      Hello.  I have to keep the swearing on this to a minimum because my sister found my other blogs and I really worried she's going to find this one :S she's really, really scary because she spent an age on the Internet trying to find them.  At least Sean found them by accident.  It's like she's stalking me ... and she will not leave me alone about the stuff I said in them!! All the stuff about Mel ... gawd, she thinks she knows everything, and she thinks I'm such a bitch, but she just doesn't know anything.  If she was in my position, she'd be even worse cuz she always gets up on her high horse if she thinks she's been treated badly.  It's because of all her "principles" acting up - she has way too many.  No wonder people call her Principle Girl.  (It's a long story, I've heard it many times, don't ask.)    Whoops, my dad just read that.  The bit about the swearing.  *Beats head against table* I shall slowly lose the respect of my entire family and alienate myself from all civilisation.  I'll just say I meant words like crap, if anyone asks.  HAHAHAHAHAH My sister thinks I fancy Sean HAHAHAHAHAHA (no offence Sean) and she thinks that I don't actually fancy a gorgeous fifth year with dark hair and blue eyes (I haven't told her his name - another reason why she canNOT find this blog!) but secretly I fancy Sean HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA.  *Clutches side, wipes tear of mirth from eye.*  I am going to go now, before I am caught writing something else ... and I need to look for a scary, scary picture of Zack de la Rocha (he really scares me, and I don't know why).  *~Jools-E~*

      Hi.  I'm at home now.  So I can write what I wish about Clare and her slut shoes without Luke J.M. reading what I'm writing and constantly asking questions like, "What's Blogger?" and "What are you writing that for?"  Oh God, keep being added in a group convo with Mel.  Who wants to talk to someone who keeps calling you a slut and greets you with, "Hi bitch,"?  It's not even with a capitol letter! (You know that teeshirt that says, 'I'm not a bitch, I'm the Bitch and it's Miss Bitch to you.' Yeah, I don't even merit that.)  I absolutely hate Mel.  She's such a cow.  There's only so many times you can say sorry and still mean it.  Actually, I never meant it, but I was trying to keep the peace until she got up on her high horse and started ... well, doing everything she's done in the four days we've been back at school.  To show the world what she's like, I'm going to paste in an email she sent me, with my reply like, on it.  The italic is me, the rest is Mel.   Hi Mel!!  How are ya?    1)Ditching me   - yeah fine, but we've all done it, and I've apologised.  2)Bitching about me -  with reason!  3)Ignoring me -  with reason x10000.  4)Saying that you wanted to kill me in front of the whole class -  I've already apologised for that, and I didn't say I wanted to kill you, I said I wanted to live far away from you.  5)I gave you my Email password and you gave it to Jools, then she locked me out of it, you pretended you had nothing to do with it -  not true, I did no locking.  I just went on it, okies?  6)Bitching about me to the boys,(Pooj) that's when they started picking on me, it was YOUR fault Pooj -  ??  Mel, they've always hated you, and they always will hate you.   7)Being pissy with my friends when they've done nothing wrong. -  what friends?  Which "set"?  The ones you use in times of "need" or the ones you actually like? Cuz I've been pissy to neither.  It's YOU who treats the former like dirt.  8)When Ria said all that stuff about Clare you didn't believe me, then when you found out she did say it, you didn't even say "Oh, sorry Mel for making you a complete loner for two weeks." -  I hung out with you for a whole lunchtime when everyone else ran off!  And I did say sorry!  9)You used to invite me into bitch fights with about 10 people against me and you ALL used to have a go at me. -  Not even.  That was MSNy people.  I'm hardly ever online compared to most.  And I just don't do huge bitch fights.  I've watched Kate vs Melissa Walton ones, but I never join in anyway.    10)When I used to ask to sit next to you, you used to say, "Oh, I'm sitting next to someone else," then when I used to ask that person they used to say, "Oh, I'm sitting next to ANOTHER PERSON." -  Not even, not even.  I've never done that.  11)Even when I TOLD you I was pissed off with you, you STILL didn't say a peep about being sorry, I gave you one whole YEAR! SORRY DON'T  (Mel!  It's doesn't)  CUT IT NOW GIRLIES :@ :@ -  I don't remember being told.  And why would we say sorry after being told you are annoyed with us?  It's like, "I hate you," "Oh, I'm so so so sorry!"  And there's more, but I can't be botherd to sit here typing out a whole year to you little dickheads -  Just because there is no more.  You were strapped to find that lot, that other people did.    Charlotte said sorry in the summer of the Shells -  Like she hasn't done stuff since!   Clare said sorry Friday lunchtime -  which Friday?  Huh?  Lucy, Ria and Lauren never really had anything to do with it, they just follwed you. But Lauren said sorry before Christmas, Lucy said sorry in America and Ria didn't do ANY of it. -  Except deny bitching about Clare, and causing you to be a "loner for two weeks" even though you were with your "friends" and now you're blaming that on us even though you know full well I was nothing to do with it.  I wish I hadn't wasted that lunchtime now.  I just felt mean, running off and ditching you.  So I didn't.  And you know the thing Lucy whispered to me?  It was to run off and meet them in a place they had already thought of.  So why are you blaming ME for that?    YOU'RE SO FUCKING STUCK UP YOU'RE OWN ASSES YOU CAN'T BE BOTHERED TO SAY SORRY TO LITTLE OLD MEL, SHE DON'T  (again!  Mel, it's really bad grammer)   MEAN SHIT ALL, DO YOU KNOW HOW MUCH PSYCHOLOGICAL TRAUMA THAT PUT ME THROUGH?  (HAHAHA.  Sorry, funny wording)  I'M SO FUCKING PARANOID AND CAUGHT UP IN WHAT OTHER'S THINK I CAN'T CONCENTRATE ON THE IMPORTANT THINGS. YOU MADE ME SO FUCKING DEPRESSED, YOU THINK YOU'VE GOT IT BAD JOOLS? HAH! TRY BEING ME! -  Actually, I don't think I've got it bad.  I did for a while, because it was much worse than it is for you.  But it's gone now.  And no thanks, I don't particularly want to be you, if being you is this pathetic.   OK, maybe it was the boys as well, BUT YOU WERE THE ONES WHO STARTED THE BOYS BEING MEAN TO ME    No.  We're.  Not.  They have always hated you!!  We can't start life-long hatred!!  We'd love to, but we can't!!      AND NOW YOU WONDER WHY I'M SO FUCKING ANGRY? YOU'VE TREATED ME THE WORST I'VE EVER BEEN TREATED AND BELIEVE ME I'VE BEEN TREATED EVER SO BADLY.  Aw, poor baby.  YOU WONDER WHY I SOMETIMES START CRYING AFTER THE MOST SLIGHTEST THNGS?  Well, you said it was because a certain someone had a terminal disease.  But now we're the reason ...?  IT'S BECAUSE OF YOU, I WAS A MENTALLY STRONG PERSON BUT BECAUSE OF YOU I'M NOT NOW.  IT'S NOT BECAUSE I'M ATTENTION SEEKING,  Oh, but you like Charlotte now, and it was her who said that.  And I seem to remember you running to me after she said it.  Hmm, funny old world, innit?   AND IT'S NOT BECAUSE I'M A GOOD ACTOR.  THE REASON  (isn't it reasonS?)   I PUT MASCARA ON NOW IS BECAUSE 1. I'M SO WORRIED ABOUT WHAT PEOPLE THINK AND 2. BECAUSE I THINK IF I CRY IT'LL RUN SO IT STOPS ME.  Oh really?  Cuz I thought you wore it when you were a "mentally strong person" for that English photo, and decided you liked the effect ...    THANKS A BUNCH LADIES FOR RUINING MY LIFE.   How have we ruined your life?  You now drive the slut-mobile!!  I can't think of anything better for someone such as you.   Oh no, it's alright, you don't have to thank me for correcting your spelling.    Isn't she such a cow?  Anyone who has no clue who Mel or anyone is will not get that.  But then you can just accept the fact that she is a cow, and move on.  And if you ever meet any of the Parvis clan, SHUN THEM ALL.   I'm going to go now, because I'm talking to Elliott's best mate.  So everything has to be done with precision ...  *~Jools~*

      Okay, this one goes out to Sean.  Hi Sean *waves frantically* are you drama-ing?  Cuz you SHOULD be.  You rebel.  (Katherine hasn't finished designing the invites yet so it'll be a while.  Keep the 15th May free, though.)  Hi all.  In English right now.  I finished all the other work so I can do what I want :D not because I should be doing work and I'm just a rebel.  I'm not a rebel *looks at feet* I'm square.  I got the coooooolest tops on Monday.  One has an axe on it, and says 'HACK' (Katherine has a matching one with a knife on it that says 'SLASH') and another one that's plain black with 'Romeo Romeo wherefore art thou Romeo?' on it.  My name's Juliet ... geddit?? Anyway.  And a reeeeeeeeeeeeeeally purdy skirt with shoes and bags on it.  Oh yeah, and socks with cherries on them and really sweet earrings, one with a little boy on it and the other one with a little girl.  Elliott is so buff.  Hee.  He's somewhere in the school, right now ... I wonder where.  I don't care that much, to be perfectly honest.  (Although, I do care what starsign he is.  I'm a Cancer, so if he's a Taurus then that's 95% compatibility, which is very very good ;) but if he's a Virgo, then that's 50%, so that would suck.)  I was looking at him today, when he walked past, and he is  so  gorgeous now with his tan I went, "Oh GOD, he's gorgeous," and Andrew, this guy in his class (5B), was right there and I was like, "Oh crap ... hi, Andrew ..."  That was funny.  Of course, not as embarrassing as when I was pointing at Elliott, with a pen, and I was saying, "That guy there is SO fit," (I didn't know his name then, so he was just 'that guy') and he turned around!!  And, drumroll please, cuz I have super-slow reactions I was still pointing at him for about ten seconds after he turned round.  So he was still staring at me.  And every single time I see him, I'm always gawping at him, so he must think I'm such a psychopath.  Oh well.  Mel keeps saying, to try to get to me, that he'd never go out with me (I was having a spaz yesterday because he got a new bag that doesn't look as gay as his old one, so I was going on about how straight I thought he was) and I don't care because everyone would think that he was a paedophile if he went out with me.  And I figured out that the 2nd thing I look for in a guy is how out-of-reach he is (1st being looks, 3rd being dress sense, 4th being music taste, 5th being personality and 6th being money), so I don't want to ever go out with him!! Gawd, reading that makes me feel so shallow!  Personality is  fifth !  Oh dear.  Anyway, I'd better go.  The lesson is running out and although we've got I.C.T. next, you just can't doss in that.  See ya later.  *~Jools~*

      Waiting for the new sodding MSN to download.  Sheesh.  All I wanna do is go online, no matter how crappy my MSN is, and it goes, "You must install the new MSN to continue."  Great.  How much do you hate Mel?  Gawd, she's so annoying!  All day she was lifting her skirt up and saying, "I'm Jools and I'm not a slut."  Possibly the most annoying thing was Clare + Charlotte pretending they thought it wasn't funny.  BullSHIT.  They found it hilarious.  You could just see their faces contorting when we were with them.  (Thanx, Pooj, for sticking by me in all my annoyingness.)  And Nisha, Amy, Rachel and the rest of them were all saying that Mel did it and Clare and Charlotte burst out laughing.  What's so funny about it?  I know I would say that, because it's about me, but what's so great about Mel flashing her legs and talking in a high voice?  It's really not that funny.  She can't even get her story straight about why she doesn't like me.  At first, it was because I didn't apologise about  everything  I've ever done (??) and now it's because everyone else apologised about this argument I don't even remember having.  I never  argue  with Mel - I blank her, or turn everyone against her.  I never argue with her, though.  And she really thinks I fancy Tom (HAH HAH) so she was going to pay him to flirt with her when I was there.  (But he wouldn't.  Mwuh hah hah.)  After French, she was going on about how he gave her a sweet, and not me.  So??  I don't give a DAMN, Mel, get that through your puny brain.  (Once she said, "Don't call me a slut!" but she forgot to say, "I'm Jools," and the beginning, so I was like, "I won't call you a slut, Mel, you're just the fucking slut-mobile driver.")  When Nisha, Amy etc told us that, we were like, "Oh, we won't tell them ..." and then as soon as we got outside I said, "I'm gonna fucking KILL them!!" and a whole bunch of Lower Sixthforms turned around.  They're such twats, L6s.  Like Luke, he is such a knob.  But that's a leetle bit off topic, so never mind.  At the beginning of French, Mel just came up to me and said, "You know, Elliott would never go out with you because you're a second year.  I asked him."  And I was just thinking,  No DUH, Mel, did you really assume I would ever think I could get my hands on fit fifth-year totty like him??  You must be dillusional.   I was watching him play football today.  Pooj didn't have her glasses on, so I was trying to describe what he was doing so she could see him, even if he was kinda blurry.  So it was like, "He's the one jumping up and down ... he's the one running ... he's the one ... spazzing?"  And before, we came down to the playground to watch him play, and Pooj was like, "Is that him?"  and I was like, "Yeah, he's the one ... pulling out a wedgie ..."  Lol, it's so weird if you just watch him for a second, because he's usually doing something really ... um ... yeah.  I can't  believe  he was on the America trip and I wasn't there.  But I suppose they did only get half an hour's shopping time in New York, and I wasn't allowed anyway because it was in Killington and my dad nearly died there.  (He almost died in  Kill ington - how freaky is that?)  Mel talked to him on the trip.  Of course, if I was there, he'd definitely know I fancy him by now.  He probably does actually - every time I see him I'm like, gawping at him, lol.  How  long  is MSN taking to load.  You STINK! I just wanted to see if anyone decent was online, but they're probably long gone now.  It's taken about twenty minutes, and it's still not done yet.  Oh, I hate being back at school!  So yeah, I get to see Elliott, and all the other gorgeous fifth years (cuz they are mostly fifth years.  There's one fit U6, and one fit L6, and an alright fourth year, but that's IT.  He's taken, anyway), but I've got Mel trying to get right up my ass all the time, and there's the rest of the slut-mobile to think about.  (Not saying anymore about that incase this is found, but Pooj'll know what I'm on about ;) if you don't let your MUM read this and get scared of me, eh Pooj?)  I'd forgotten how much I hate school.  I spend every lesson waiting for it to be over.  It's so CRAP!  My sister's leaving school at the end of this year, and 'tis not fair that I have to be there for another five years.  And then there's uni to think about, and my fees are gonna be a trillion times more than my sister's fees cuz of some new law or something.    Must go, have to write a bitchay bitchay email to Mel :D it's moments like this that make my life complete.  *~Joolsipie~*  Yes Sean, this is my current blog.  Don't tell my sister, or anyone who could tell my sister, about it.  It's your own fault you found the rest of them, lol.  Oh yeah, I didn't ask earlier but a)  why  were you talking to Luke? and b) what song is your addy from?  It's bugging me now ...

      Mello all.  I went shopping with Pooj today (Pooj, y'know the thing we forgot to do?  Look for friendship bracelets! D'oh).  So yeah.  Can I just say that Michael's mate is really cool?  If he was fit then hey ;) but no.  And I'm too shallow to fancy a guy for any other reason.  (I'd hate to imagine my husband.  He'll probably be a right bastard and abuse me or something, but he'll be stinking rich and look  really  good in all his designer outfits.)   I'm am being so catty with Clare!  And then she goes and corrects my spelling.  What a bitch!  I can spell words wrong if I fucking want to spell words wrong.  So fuuuuuuck you. Bitch.  Ha, I don't even care if you find this.  Biiiiiiitch.  Bitch.  BIIIIIIITCH.  I'm seriously going ot regret that at some point or other.  But now, it's all good.  So ...  BiIiIiIiIiIiIiIiIiIiIiIiIiIiIiIiIiIiIiIiIiIiIiIiIiIiIiIiIiIiIiIiTcH!  You bitch about me, and then tell me you haven't bitched about me ever - what's that about?  You could at least be honest, for fucks sake.  I had never bitched about you until this holiday.  But now I feel free to express my feelings.  BITCH.  Okay, I really will regret that at some point or other (so why I'm publishing it now is a mystery to me) so I'll shut up now.  *~Jools~*  Touch&eacute;, Sean, touch&eacute;.

      Hello.  I'm am ill - as ill as the day is long.  (James is as gay as the day is long.  Think about it - it's almost summer.) I keep coughing up phlegm (you really don't want to know this) and Katherine reckons I've got TB.  Always so optimistic, is my sister.  But TB is blood, not phlegm, right? Anyway, I woke my mum up at one this morning cuz I was coughing so much.  Don't know how she heard - must have supersonic hearing or something.  (Remember Sonic the hedgehog? I used to love him.  What was the squirrel's name?  I can't remember.  I'm not even sure it was a squirrel.  Oh well.)  So anyway, she went to get me a honey and lemon thingy, and can I just say that they are so nice!  It stopped me coughing a bit too.  I always get colds in the holidays.  Wonder how I'm going to manage it in the summer.  My immune system fighting a disease is like a small jut of land in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, only big enough to hold half a penguin, trying to take on the rest of the world.  Or just the half-penguin trying to take on the rest of the world.  It really is crappy.    I'm getting my hair cut tomorrow!  After I have a filling put in ... according to the dentist, it's not like a proper filling, but just some stuff to fill a hole that my tooth grew with, so food doesn't get stuck in it.  My mum had a go at me for having too much sugar in my tea (four sugars, minimum) but the dentist kept saying it was the natural growth of the tooth, blah blah blah.  I've given up tea temporarily, though - I was having too much and caffeine is apparently bad for a lot of things.  Plus, I don't want to become diabetic with all the sugar intake.  So my hair, then.  I'm quite nervous, because it's going to be all layery and the layers start off quite short - it's that model's hair from those shampoo ads in magazines that are good for long hair, or something.  I found a big pic in a hair mag that didn't have any writing or shampoo bottles on it and I thought it was really cool.  I'm not sure about losing the length though.  I bet, now I've had this stress, no one will even notice it was cut.  Although they should do ... but I suppose after the fallout, we're not going to be on absolutely perfect terms ...  About the fallout.  I just apologised to Charlotte.  I can't be arsed to carry it on because I just can't be arsed.   Nor can I be arsed to argue about that guy from Good Charlotte being fit.  I think Good Charlotte are really crap, but that one guy - Billy, I think he's called - is really hot!!  I can't stand Joel, though - I would happily rip him limb from limb. Heh heh heh ... she also doesn't think Elliott's fit.  Actually, no one thinks Elliott's fit, except me.  He is sooooooooo gorgeous!  So what if he's fifteen and fancies Claudia Schiffer?  She's not that ... well, she is that pretty.  But ... he ... I ... it's not fair!  God, I really hope no one finds this.  That inspires the question - why the hell did I make it then?  God knows.  I just wanted a purdy new blog *shifts from one foot to the other restlessly*.  I can't wait till my sister's party!!  It's on the 15th May, which is ages away, but still ...  I've got a pink swirly skirt for it from Dorothy Perkins.  But I also got this really cool dress with strawberries all over it from H & M, and it has a really cool swirly skirt, too - so now I don't know what to do.  It all depends on what shoes I get.  If I get the gorgeous black ones with the buckle from New Look that I'm not allowed cuz my mum thinks they're too high, then I could wear either, but I'd rather wear the pink skirt.  If I get pink shoes, then I can't wear the strawberry dress, cuz you can't wear pink with red unless you're going for the punk look.  And if I get red shoes I can't wear the pink skirt.  It's so confusing ...  I don't know what to do.  I know that no one will want me there, and if I touch any alcohol I will probably get roaring drunk.  I really can't handle my drink at all.  I got drunk in R.E. when they gave me and teensy bit of wine when I was part of the Passover meal thing (youngest person in the class, had to do it.  My best mate is the oldest girl, so she was in it, too).  And these Chinese people gave my a Baccardi Breezer - big mistake.  I was really tipsy.  I wasn't allowed any Bailey's Glide afterwards.  I can just imagine it, at Katherine's party, being all slurry and going, "You know what, Claire?  You're my only ... my only friend ... in the whole world ..." and then going to someone else, "Michael, if you were a man, and I was a woman ... heh heh heh."  Dear God, don't let me near alcohol.  But I really want a watermelon Baccardi ... I've never tried one before.  They look nice.  I think I'd better go.  I really have to be in bed early because 1) the dentist appointment is at 9:40 AM (!!) and 2) I don't want to be totally shattered, after spending most of last night either reading Harry Potter or coughing up green goop.  Farewell  *~Jools~*  Elliott, you sexy thing, wake up and notice I exist, dammit!

      Oosh, Clare's talking to me.  After saying that I wasn't talking to her - strange angle on things, that.  I just wasn't being fully responsive.  Like, when she said, "Why are you pissed off with me?" I said, "Does Tom have MSN?"  There was an actual reason for me saying that, but I don't think she got it.    Anyway, she's talking to me now because my MSN name is, ":'( :'( My little Smellykins!" and she wanted to know what was wrong with Smelly.  (Smelly's my pet cockatiel, and she's just been diagnosed with diabetes.) I think we're both kind of tense ... if she's still pretending to be in L.A., I know for a fact she's in England.  She rang Pooj, and it was her home number when Pooj did 1471.    So find me and follow me, through corridors, refectories and files, you must follow, leave this academic factory, you will find me in the matinee, the dark of the matinee is miiiine! Yes it's miiiine!    Lol, how catchy is that song?  *~Jools~*  Oh yeah, Sean, if you're reading this, my sister's probs going to invite you to her birthday party. =D I'm getting a swirly pink skirt for it cuz it's a 50s party.

      *Moans* This blog is named after how I feel right now.  Hopefully, no one will find this (except maybe Sean.  What is up with you reading my blogs, dude?) cuz I want to rant on about the people making my life hell right now.  Clare - fallen out with me, and acting like a cute, hurt animal to everyone else so they're all on her side.  And is pretending to be in America.  Charlotte - having a bitch fight with everything and everyone for no apparent reason except, according to her, we're pissed off with her.  Lucy - in America, and therefore doing nothing, so I get blamed for bitching about her.  What?!  All of the above - have been bitching about me and my best friend, had a sleepover without us, and are just generally worthy of thirty-four slaps each.  MSN - signed me off and won't let me back on and Bob's online!! Why, cruel world, why?  I am soooo annoyed at the world.  All except Pooj, and she isn't allowed to come to or have a sleepover, but a movie night is a possibility.  I'm just getting agitated writing all this.  But I must let it out.  Oh my God - Clare majorly fancied Dan even after he was being his worst to me.  And she wonders why I'm annoyed with her!  *Whispers* it's a little thing called self-respect, girl ...  You will get sucked in by my blog.  Resistance is futile.  Later, honeys!  *~x Jools x~*

      Oh my Gawd.  Just had a Fight with Charlotte.  Read this ...  CRAAAP! I GOT RID OF IT!  Why the hell did I do that?  It was so incredibly bitchy ... and I kept apologising and she just threw it back in my face.  Not that I had anything to apologise for.  And Mel goes on about how our code names for Clare and Charlotte are "thirty-six year old man" and "Harris".  Huh?! Where did that come from??  And Charlotte goes, "You and Pooj are becoming the same person." She didn't even explain what the hell she meant.  We say stuff at the same time, like the same music, fancy the same guys, but apart from that, we're total opposites! Well, um, we're like, the same height and stuff too, but ... okay fine, we're very similar, but still.  She's just trying to  be  Clare, whereas Pooj and I can't help it that we're exactly the same.  I think I smoothed things over.  God, I hope I did. I've got half term to be as sweet as canned sugar to them, and this whole thing will be over. It's horrible!! I really wanna know what they've been saying about me, though ... hmm.  I want to know, but I don't.   I've got to put Snood and Smelly to bed, but they won't go in *beats head against table* they won't go in!! Oh well, it's not my problem.  I just need to remember to watch Lenny Henry.  And no one's coming online!  Darn! Must change my name to Snow Patrol lyrics.  You know, Elliott fills all my critea for the perfect bloke.  1) he's gorgeous (even though he looks like a mushroom when he's not wearing hairgel), 2)he's waaay outta my league, 3) he likes Muse, Foo Fighters and Snow Patrol, so he's got good music taste, 4) he dresses skater, so he can dress well (and he's got this top with a monkey on it swinging on a vine with a cast around it's arm and it say, 'I am a slow learner' or something.  Aww!), 5) I'm sure he's got a good personality ... 6) he MUST be rich because he comes to Bablake and he forked out £900 on a trip to America.  So maybe he was rich, and isn't any more ... anyway, he's absolutely great.    And if nobody minds, I'm just going to change the address of this now so Katherine can't find it!  Ha ha ha!   Must go, *~Jools~*

      The exams are over!!  We have to go on this crappy Chedworth trip thing tomorrow, but then it's half term so woo!  Mental note: must remember those sodding friendship bracelets.  I've just been scouring the net for pictures of InMe. Joe Morgan is sooo fine! I did this compatibility test, and it's 91% compatibility.  It's only 60 something % with Elliott, but our horoscopes say 95%, and that we're like soulmates, so screw the little name thingy.   I have sooo failed this German exam.  It was horrible!  It said, "Sonne," somewhere, and after that I had the Rammstein song on my mind.  I HATE that song - it freaks the hell out of me! But anyway, I was totally distracted, and I haven't got a flippin' clue what Sonne means anyway.  Me thinks I may have got that section entirely wrong ...  Wowow!  Tomorrow morning, looadsa fifth years will be in our formroom! *Squee!* Any volunteers to help Andy revise? ;)  (Oh my God, Pooj! Remember that time when he asked us if we could help him with his homework?  How much would you take him up on that now?!)  We did drugs today!  We did weed and ecstasy and heroin and we were going to do magic mushrooms but we ran out of time.  Lol. I was Jools Magic Mushrooms.  Dan was Jim Weed. Sam was Fred Grass.  Pooj was Pooj Speed.  That was so random, actually.  And someone with an accent like that should NOT be called Stacy.  Or Staysay.  Her top was absolutely gorgeous, though.  All black and lacey ... wow, I want it.  Okay, you search InMe on Google, and you get a picture of a very fluffy dog called Saara.  Well that's just darn tootin', isn't it.  Ooh *wipes tear from eye* today was probably the last day I'll ever see the U6.  No more, no more *cries pathetically*.  At least it's only Boxy who's really gonna be hit hard.  She's reeeally fancies Hilly.  Actually, so does half the third year.  They are sooo pathetic.  I mean, yeah, I know Elliott has Home Ec. 4th period on Tuesdays, but they have posters of Hilly.  I kid you not.  Gawd knows how they got them.  Right, there is something strange going on between Adam and Richard Baldwin, so I have to focus my full attention on what is going on there ... Richard just spent ten minutes confusing me about Homer Simpson.  What a weirdo.  I shall leave you with words of wisdom from Homer.  (This is what started the whole confusion.)  "Le grille! What the hell is that?!"  Lool.  Ciaow! *~Jools~* Mwah

      Jesus.  I am so depressed it makes the 30s look like a song and dance.  Clare keeps blocking me and unblocking me.  We were in this group convo a minute ago, and look at this ...  Pooj says: is lu talkin to any of u? Jools says: um ... she's online? Clare says: she no online Pooj says: ok Jools says: you weren't either, until a minute ago Jools says: and yet pooj was able to add you Jools says: god, that's weird Clare says: yes, we all know i blocked u and i forgot to unblock u    Clare has left the conversation.  She's such a bitch! Why did she block me anyway?  I mean, yeah, she blocked me on Friday night (without a reason) but then she unblocked me.  So she would have had to block me again, while I was offline cuz I was off all weekend, for some reason.  Forgot to unblock me, Jesus Christ.  And I can't believe she fancied Dan in January, when he was being really horrible to me.  I dreaded coming to school for months and months, just incase he would start up again.  Just after we all grassed, I was especially edgy.  When was that, March?  Yeah.  Anyway.  Everytime I see them walking up to the turning circle when I get off the bus, I have a spaz, thinking, "Oh my God, what have I done?  How mean will he be this time?" I remember when I saw them, and they followed me to the formroom, kicking me and water onto me all the way.  It was really awful.  That would have been sometime in rainy November.  I wish I'd grassed earlier.  I wish he'd been expelled.  He's been alright since he almost got expelled, yeah, but it's not worth it.  I'm sure he's going to start up again.  And Pooj says that if he does, she's going to slap him.  The worst thing would be having her involved.  I can't cope on my own, but this time I'd go straight to Mr. Hyde, and I don't want Pooj to get hurt.  They only really started on me when she was away, anyhoo.  Like on January 15th, when Dan tried to push me down the stairs.  The stairs in the EDM block, where they all have a metal thingy on them.  By rights he should have been expelled for that.  But he denied it, so what can you do?  He got away with having a BB gun, cannabis and a lighter in school.  I don't know why his word counted for more than ours.  At least he's not coming to Fousseau.  His mummy won't let him go.  I have to go revise for Science now ... we've got the exam tomorrow and I'm sooo gonna fail.  Vale!  *~Jools~*

      Well, today was pretty crappy.  It started off being alright (hee, none of the boys like Clare, and most of them would go out with me, according to Dan, and even he said he would, even after everything he's done to me.  There's no way in a million years that I would ever go out with Dan ever, he's soo horrible.  But still.  And it looks like I'm better prepared for Fousseau than Clare, if we really are all going to go out with someone.  Mel's going to ask out Tom, but he likes Lucy.  Awww ...) but then at lunch Pooj and I found Clare's bag (she'd lost it at break) gave it back to her, and then everyone was going, "Oh my God, you nicked it, didn't you?"  Mel asked us separately where we found it, and she was being soo confusing about it.  We found it outside the exit between E3 and the toilets in the EDM block, and Mel goes, "You know when you go in the English block, and you go to the left and then up there, was it outside the first door or the second door?"  I said first door, thinking she meant the second one was the one right at the end.  Pooj said second door, thinking she meant the first one was the one between the staff room and E1.  So we had different answers - I still don't know what the hell Mel meant - and Lucy goes, "You've just blanked yourselves out."  What a bitch!  Why would we steal Clare's bag?  It's so pathetic!!  Now Clare's not talking to me :S she was blanking me all the way through ICT.  If you think about it, Clare's not talking to us because we did her a favour.  I wish we'd just bloody left it there now.  Lool, my sister just came in with leftover helium balloons from her party.  The best thing to say in a riduculous sqeaky voice is, "I love you baby, and if it's quite alright I love you baby, on the lonely night I need you, baby ..."  Yeah.  My MSN name at the moment is "I love you ******, and if it's quite alright I love you ******, on the lonely night I need you ******" lool.  (Psst ... the stars stand for Andrew, but he might come online, and Michael's online anyway, so mayby it's best to leave them blank.  Jeremery's trying to find out who it is, though.)  Katherine's just gone clubbing. *Sniffs* My big sister's growing up.  And she's found my blog, too *growls* take one last look, Ko, cuz I'm changing the address. Ha har! Not so clever now, are you?!  I'm booored.  No one's online, except Billy (who's started talking to me *shudders* freakoid, PISS OFF), some spaz I don't know, J.M., Birdie, Michael and Jeremery.  Why can't Andy come online or something? Lool, look at my convo with Billy.      (8) shel be right here in my arms so in love, shel be right here in thees arms she cant let go (8) says:  i herd dt asong   (8) shel be right here in my arms so in love, shel be right here in thees arms she cant let go (8) says:   inme   (F)(8) I'm holding you, holding you close to me, cuz you are my angel (8)(F) Why has no one heard that song? says:   yup  (8) shel be right here in my arms so in love, shel be right here in thees arms she cant let go (8) says:   it kool   (F)(8)I'm holding you, holding you close to me, cuz you are my angel (8)(F) Why has no one heard that song? says:   yeah   (8)shel be right here in my arms so in love, shel be right here in thees arms she cant let go (8) says:   kool    (F)(8)I'm holding you, holding you close to me, cuz you are my angel (8)(F) Why has no one heard that song? says:   dude  (8) shel be right here in my arms so in love, shel be right here in thees arms she cant let go (8) says:   k  I HATE it when people say "k".  It should be outlawed.  "kkk" is even worse.  Argh, I could KILL anyone who says it.  DIE BILLY DIE.  God, he's so annoying.  And a right minger, too - why oh why do loadsa girls fancy him?  That's like me saying, "I FANCY HORVATH, HE'S DEAD SEXY." Well, maybe not quite.  But almost, almost.   :O Andy and Michael don't like Jeremery! Must sort this one out ... but damn, they've all gone on study leave. Well, actually, Jeremery only has five days of school left. Noo! I almost forgot! Must have teary farewells from all the U6 ... lool, and then you see them the next day and it's like, "D'oh! I went through all that for nothing!"   HAHAHAHAHA.  Clare came online, right?  So I changed my name to, "Okay, so we do 'em a favour and now they hate us? IS THIS A DEMOCRACY? *Is on helium high, take no notice people*"  So she says to me - argh! Noo! I got rid of it! I'll make it up then - "who hates you? cuz mel's just paranoid and crazzzy" or something like that. I said, "Yeah."  AND NOW SHE'S BLOCKED ME!!  HAHAHAHAH!  Now she can't say I'm a bitch, because I gave her her bag back and now she's blocked me.  What a charmer you are, Clare.  Hmm.  The bassist from INME is fine.  Charlie Ross doesn't think so.  Eh, she went out with Mattie Rowledge and he's a crime against human nature.  (I would show y'all the picture of him dressed up as a girl, but I don't want to de-flower your virgin eyes.  It's really not a nice sight.)  I'm going to go now.  Pooj wants me to publish.  (Take that horrible pic OFF, Pooj - he's disgusting!  The Way are not a joke, people!)  Aurevoir! *~Jools~*

      Halloooo.  'Twas my sister's party last night.  It was sooo funny.  Claire and I got pretty bored so we were taking photos of all the people outside, lool.  These townies went past and we were waving at them, and they kept gesturing at us to come outside.  We wouldn't, so they tried to come inside, and were turned away by the bouncer on the door.  They were still hanging around outside though, but then Millsey stands up and looked at them, and they looked at him, and they just ran away.  This bald guy came past, he looked inside, and found these little flowers, and was trying to propose to Claire through the window.  Wonder what Bob would say about that, hey ...   I told Claire who I fancy, but only cuz he's in her year.  I wonder if she thinks he's fit ...  Anyway, we were dicussing her year and I was like, "You've got the best year by far!  There are sooo many fit guys ..." and she was like, "Oh my God, who?! I can't think of anyone!" and I was just thinking, wait a minute, you're going out with Bob but you don't think he's fit??    My sister has this obsession with making balloon things, so there was this pink monster balloon hat, so I put it on, and Jeremery goes, "I wonder what Elliott would say if he saw you like that," and I was like, "Shuttup!!"  Lool, he got a new, really expensive haircut (his family are sooo rich.  While other people would have an extension put on their house, his faimly are having an "extra wing" built) and he hates it.  Okay, that's not actually that funny.  And I'm just rambling now.  Oh my God, this total BITCH going by the name of Becky D. (I shall not put any more here, but I think it's really obvious who I mean if I say she's a Science teacher's daughter) used ma sister's party as a meeting place to meet Ellie and Misty so they could go clubbing in Birmingham.  Katherine had invited them all ages before Becky arranged any night out.  Ellie thought it was a good compromise, going to the party and then going clubbing, but then Becky turns up, doesn't say anything to Katherine, and it seemed really spiteful, just meeting there.  Gawd, what a bitch!   Oh yay, Clare's talking to me.  PISS OFF.  My MSN name is "What do you call a townie with two brain cells? - Pregnant" so she goes, "lmbfao at your name" and I reeeeally wanted to say, "Why?  You're a townie yourself."  I really want to slap her.  GET LOST.  Sorry. I can say in blog what I cannot say to people's faces.  Over MSN.  Whatever.  She's launching into a story about what they did at the cinema last night, and they only went to the blummin' cinema cuz they knew I wouldn't be able to go because of Katherine's party.  Grr.  Not that I would've gone anyway (I would rather snog Horvath than spend quality time with Clare and Charlotte), but still.   I'm going to go now.  My mum keeps giving me suspicious looks and I'm really scared she's going to start reading this.  *~Jools~*

Lool, why the hell did Luke (that is his name, right?) go to uni in Wales, anyway?  I mean, WALES?! Jesus Christ! Of all the places ...  Pooj, lurve the pink, but the rest of it is not loading!  Oh yeah, I can just say that to you on MSN.  Hold on a minute.  Okay. Back.  But I have to go now.  Chuh.  See you later :D  Jools

      Oh my God!!  How cool is the new blogger?  Wowow!   Totally  not expecting this when I signed in.  It's so wicked!!  I cannot wait until Battle of the Bands!  Pooj's coming round my house after school (we will terrorise the bus on the way home, HAHA) and we can laugh at ... well, I don't know if they're in it this year, but certainly if Pubeless Werewolf have changed their name and are in it, then they are going DOWN!  Love In The Asylum should've won last year.  (Rock on, Sean, rock on.)  Del Sato SUCK, because I don't really like Withers at all, and Iodown *snorts* what the hell were they about? *Sighs contentedly* All I can do now is sit and wait for Thursday.  Hmm.  Good God, what am I going to wear?! What if Elliott's there?  Yeah, what if he is there ... ;)  Clare is so annoying!  Slut shoes, slut shoes!  You can't go round with the same shoes as Ellie McCarthy and still have any street cred at all.  Although, it's only me and Pooj who have noticed.  Grr, Clare was flirting so much all day, and then she pretends that she hasn't been bitching about us ... yes you have, honey, and we've been bitching about you so shurrup!   Och, ma daddy needs the computer in fifteen minutes.  No one is online!  Well, Clare is ... Charlotte is ... oh, joyous days.  Not.  Charlotte just asked me what song my name is from.  (It's `Talk to me, dance with me, in the spotlight, boy` which is OBVIOUSLY slightly altered Hot Hot Heat lyrics, and NO ONE has heard of them!!)  Oh dear, got to go, maybe more later.  *~Jools~*

      Hello.  I had written all this other stuff, but then this total COW sends me the "You are an idiot," thing, so I had to reboot my computer o_O;;; *Mutters* bitch ...  I'm talking to Clare, and getting sooo annoyed with her, so everytime she says something she finds funny, I go, "lol." or "ha." with the full stops, cuz it always looks like they're just doing that to be polite, which, indeed, I am, but also to get to her after a while.   Pooj's winding up Clare on this group convo we've got.  It's funny, because she needs bringing down to size.  Pooj's pretending to be starting this webpage, cuz Clare's all self-proclaimed HTMLy.  Lool, you have to be here.  I can't be bothered to explain it all.  MSN profiles work again!  I've got this black and white picture of me on mine, and Pooj rang me and asked who it was, pml!  Apparently it doesn't look like me.  I didn't think so either, but ... hey, it stays!  Elliot's profile is rubbish, because all it says, basically, is, "I'm free and good-looking," and I knew that anyway!! Bob's pic is funny, cuz he looks ever so slightly retarded, and Sean's ... well, the less said about Sean's, the better :P cuz T.S.Eliot smells!  Och, can't be bothered to write anymore.  Clare is officially wound up (she just keeps leaving the convos now) and I have a headache.  And I just want to talk to Pooj about Elliot, and **** *******-******, and ******

      HI! I've done all my homework so I can just stay on the Internet for hours and hours and hours and hours and yipee! *Mumbles* Sorry ...  I can't wait until the summer.  On the 4th July, we're going to Malta (any fit Maltese boys out there?) and we're going to be there for like a week.  Then we're going to some crappy Indian wedding on the 18th July (my birthday.  It's bloody brilliant.  I'm going to have to wake up early, sit in a car for two hours, then pretend to be happy for two people I've never met :@ and I wasn't allowed this reeeeally purdy pink dress I saw in New Look).  My dad has to be a witness at this court case (truly crappy - I thought it would be some murder or something, but it's a sodding money fraud or something like that), but we're going to my mate Kit's house in Boston (can't wait - she's got a swimming pool, a "really cute" mate, it'll be really hot, America + summer = good times, and ... wow, I just can't wait).  Then we go to Santa Rosa to see ma grandma and grandpa.  And the Hello Kitty merchandise, and this really cool shop called Hot Topic (go on the webby, www.hottopic.com, it's really cool) but ... we're there out of love for my family ...  Oh God, I hope there isn't another family reunion again *glares at computer* that was REALLY dull.  It was this party thrown by these really rich cousins of ours, well, my mum's cousin, and it was soooo hot were they were.  They had a swimming pool, though, so that was cool.  But is it really worth being told by trillions of old people you haven't seen since you were a baby that you're taller, and by your first cousin's girlfriend of two years that your accent is really cute? (Grrr ... yours is cute too, Amy ...)  So anyway, yeah, can't wait for the summer!  It was sooo funny in Latin today, cuz some guy was "iratissimus", so Miss James goes, "What emotion was Marcus feeling?" and I whispered, "He was PISSED OFF." And she heard me, hahahaha.  She goes, "In polite English, please ..." She's such a goon.  She can't teach at all, lol.  Well, I suppose she can ... she just spends too long on some things, when we should be doing other things.  And I HAAAATE those stupid, stupid vocab tests.  There's no point!  She thinks we don't cheat, but every single time I'm telling Pooj all the answers.  Pooj, WHY won't you come online, I need to ask what Andrew's addy is ... and Clare's driving me round to blinking bend ...  Shut UP, I couldn't care less if Billy threw himself into a quarry, so WHY do I want to know how well his parent-teacher thing went?  Get over it, school isn't everything.    That's a good point, actually.  Parent-teacher meetings.  I allowed my parents to see Mr. Tightass, Mr. Hyde, Mr. Dougall, Mrs Marchant and Miss Imber.  I didn't even ask what the last two said.  According to Mr. Tightass, I could be in the top five if I tried (well, that's likely. *Snorts.*) and Mr. Dougall was very interested in this essay I wrote, that was just taking to mick out of my classmates and his homeworks.  He didn't know I read so much.  I just put down all the intellectual books that I've read, like Jane Eyre, Emma and Wuthering Heights ... blah blah blah.  Then Mr. Hyde spoils it all, by saying I'm doing "okay" but I talk too much.  Damn straight!  I'm crap at Science, and I'm crap at being quiet, so you can shove it where the sun don't shine, honey!   (Is this really wise to be putting on the Internet?  Teachers don't have lives do they?  They wouldn't find this, would they?  Oooh, I'm getting paranoid.)  Meh.  I'm going to go now.  I can't be arsed to write anymore.  Lool, has anyone seen that Kenan + Kel episode when they got that pen that says, "Time to write," when you click it, and it got stuck and it kept saying that over and over and then in the middle of the night they break into Kenan's parent's room and wake them up, and they go, "Do you have any idea what time it is?" and they've got the pen and it's still going and they go, "Um ... time to write?" It's sooooo funny.  *Clears throat and looks away sheepishly.*  Okay, I really will go now.  I expect you've all had enough of me.  (Who exactly reads this?  I know Sean and Pooj do, but I can't give the address to Clare, Charlotte and Mel, etc.  So unless random members of the public read this, then it's just us three against the world.  So why do I bother?  Oh well, it amuses me and it certainly amuses Pooj, lolol.  Pooj, remember, I gave him my best last night ... HAHAHAHAHAHA that is the the proper way to talk about your Maths teachers *tuts*.)  Ciaw darlings, see you all later. *~ Jools, mwah mwah ~*  Sean, are you on anything illegal? Love dollars?  You're ker-azee.    Hasn't anyone else noticed how freaky Zack de la Rocha is?  He scares me ...  Check out www.toothpastefordinner.com.  It's funny.    I truly am going now!  I swear! No wait, hold on, lemme paste some lyrics in ...  I wish I could drive away to the sunset Back to the day that we first met Only believe the things I wrote I'll put it in a note, yeah I'll cross my t's and dot my i's Better say hello, don't you dare say goodbye I'll write sincerely yours and sign my name P.S. I love you forever and today  Okay, I'm done.  I'm going.  I just love that song!! (Hint ... get the All-American Rejects album.  It's good!  Honest!)

      I'm at school now - check me, I'm being a rebel.  Well, actually I'm not, cuz we've got a free lesson as it's our last I.C.T. lesson of term.  I hardly did ANYTHING on my website, but who cares? We've got our reports anyhoo and my I.C.T. one was quite good.  I couldn't read Dr. Nuttall's comment at the end of it.  It said something about "fully justified" and "one of the top students in the year group".   Mr. Dougall's was worse, but the 98% at the top said it all.  Ah.  I am sooo bored.  I'd probs rather do work than just mess around.  Clare and Loz and Tom are doing something over in the corner, with the computer turned right the other way.  Something tells me I maaaay not be included in that.  La la li la.  I can't be bothered to do anything.  All my posts seem to be rambly and random now, but everything's like that at the end of term.  Lessons have no point cuz no one's doing anything.  My brain has started to atrophy.  I shall go now, as I am getting paranoid about people reading over my shoulder (and people who can't have the address of this blog finding it :S)  Syanara, *~Jools~*

      Ah, Sports Day today.  It was cancelled last year, so we missed out on seeing all those (at the time) fourth years, who stop doing it in the fifth year cuz they're all on study leave.  So I missed out on a chance to see Elliott in shorts, although I didn't know he existed at that point.  I first met him on the 3rd September, at the school shop.  I thought he went to Henry's until one day I saw him at school, and I was like, "OH MY GOD, IT'S SEXY SEXY SCHOOL SHOP BOY."  Then he caught me pointing at him, staring at him, and gesturing at him to show Pooj who he was, when we asked him what his name was.  Soo embarrassing ...  Mimble wimble.  I can't be bothered to say anything.  Anything that CERTAIN PEOPLE can read anyways.    There is noo point in this now.  There's something that I'm bursting to say, but I just can't say it *spazzes* but I really want to.  Ooh, this isn't fair!!  He's online, but I can't add him, because then ... then he'll know I added him, which would not be good for the economy!  I have his email address, but I can't just do something so - I don't know ... obvious - like adding him!!  Cruel, cruel world.  Why do you tempt me so?  See you later, computater (don't ask), *~Jools~*

      Okay, I wasn't going to post anymore because I don't like Katherine reading this (that's actually an understatement.  I HATE Katherine reading this with all the passionate venom in my body) but ... it's addictive.  Fousseau.  Well, that was an interesting experience.  I can't really be bothered to write about it.  I'll write about  Nick , though.  The stupid lil ...  We were on the ferry on the way back, and there was this TRULY fit guy with the school that was next to us.  They were from some weird-ass place in Bristol.  So anyway, people wanted to know who I was gawping at, so I told everyone ... including Nisha, who asked him what his name was.  (Nick, obviously.) She also found out he's a Gemini.  (50% compatibility, but the reason is Cancers like to stay at home and not go out, while Geminis are party animals.  Well, I lurve going out, so I'm thinking that's not so true, maybe.) I don't think he knew who "that girl over there, her name's Jools, she fancies you" was, but Harris and Luke Smith asked him if he'd go out with me, and apparently he said, "No, she's a dog." *Spits.* I don't know whether to believe them or not :S Clare reckons Nick thought they meant her, cuz she was wearing a pink top and jeans too, and Nick and his mates were giving her evils - but can anyone really call Clare a dog?  I don't know.  Anyway, I made up a song and I was singing it on the bus on the way home.  It's my MSN name as well.  "Oh Ni-ick, I thought you were fit but you were a prick, I'm glad they took you away-ay, oh Ni-ick ..."  Madame Field heard me singing it. I've never been looked at so strangely in my life.  We were talking to a bunch of the boys from Nick's school, who weren't Nick, or his mates (especially the one we nicknamed Rastafarian, because he had Jamaican sweatbands on his head and wrists) so they were really nice.  Nisha got a crush on this one (even though she swears she's a lesbian) because he had a "sexy voice", but then we found out he had a throat infection, so that was why it was all husky.  He was called Anthony.  There was Josh, Stoner (a.k.a. Francis, or Franny), another Nick, Dan, Paul (Nisha kept calling him Theo for some reason) and Steve, too. They wouldn't believe we were in Year 8; they thought we were Year 11 or something.  They all thought we were sooo posh cuz we go to a private school.  Then Steve pretended he went to Millfield but he got expelled for setting a toilet on fire ... we all thought he was a pyro until he started telling us we were really gullible.  Oh yeah, and I almost forgot about Will.  He had a water bottle and he kept spraying it everywhere.  We were all drenched.  I really have to do my homework now.  I didn't  mean  to leave it this late.  To whoever left that message, yes, I am scared, and no, I don't know who you are.  So, who are you then?  Sean? One of Katherine's friends?  A weird stalker?  My life is addictive ... well yeah, I can't live without it, can I?  What am I, a soap opera?  How am I disturbed, anyhoo?  See you later, *~Jools~*  Oh my God! It's almost summer!! Can I get a hallelujah?  Hallelujah!

      Okay, here I shall post the convo I had with Clare on Saturday night.  (It's totally edited, so if you want the complete version, leave a comment for it or something.  And I'll send it to your email - if I see fit to.)  Clare says: HELLO!! Clare says: Wow I saw you waving Clare says: Well I saw you waving and had no clue who it was; it took us ages to work it out  Jools says: Huh. Clare says: When we were camping Clare says: And you were in Puja's car?? Clare says: That was you guys, right? Jools says: Oh yes Jools says: That sleepover Jools says: Silly me Clare says:  Wasn't me, at all, I haven't fallen out with you, I've explained it ALLLL to Pooj but if that's how u want to see it *shrugs*  Jools says: Y'know the three major problems I have with falling out with y'all? 1) I miss you like hell 2) Le Fousseau will be craptastic if we're laying into each other the whole time and 3) I wanna big birthday party with a bouncy castle but I'm not allowed it for only three people  Clare says: Awwwwww three people? Jools says: Me, Pooj, Ria Clare says: I don't understand why everyone's fallen out at all Clare says: I don't understand where it all came from Jools says: But do I really want a party with people who hate me? And who prank me for staying out of their way? Hmm, I dunno Jools says: Maybe I should just invite Katherine's friends cuz they're a lot nicer Clare says: I was no part of the pranking, Amy and me just sat there mainly while they were doing that Clare says: And then they wanted to do it again and Loz and me just told them to f off lol Jools says: Amy?!  Clare says: Loz didn't do it either Clare says: Amy was there (Mel's party, they're mates) Clare says: I felt SO sorry for her Clare says: I think she felt left out Clare says: LMAO and the next day Mel was still asleep in the tent so we tied her to the base of it and screamed that there was a fire Jools says: So there wasn't really one? And Mel didn't asphyxiate? Shucks. Jools says: Oh, sorry, you like her Jools says: Well, you do at the moment anyway Clare says: Yeah I do but I can understand why you don't Jools says: *Rolls eyes* Cuz she hates me for no reason Jools says: Same as with Charlo but I'm sooo gonna stop here for fear of having my house egged or something  Clare says: I don't think Mel hates you, it wasn't her, it was Charlo Jools says: Oh no, Mel doesn't hate me at all Jools says: Why, we're bestest buddies Jools says: Brb, I'm gonna go have tea and crumpets with my chum Mel *glares* Clare says: Lol. Well, I still like you and Pooj and I don't know why they don't ... Well … I do ... but the reasons they have don't piss me off Clare says: If that makes any sense Jools says: It does Jools says: Though all we've done is what they want Jools says: Like, they get pissed off with us for going on about guys, we go off to talk about guys, they don't like it, we try to hang out with you, there is total and utter silence, we leave, they don't like it  Clare says: Ah, as they see it you don't like us and that's why you're always going off. I probably don't get pissed off for I am also a boy obsessive Jools says: And the thing about your bag, for god's sake! If we had stolen it, 1) We wouldn't have stolen yours and 2) We wouldn't have given it back! Clare says: Lol, I didn't believe that  Clare says: No, I mean I didn't believe you took my bag Clare says: Sorry, came out wrong lol Clare says: I'm really pissed about Fousseau though, I really hated the way they just came up too you guys and go "You HAVE to move" Clare says: If it's not resolved by the time we get to Fousseau I'll probably go cuz if we fall out anymore Fousseau is gonna crap up  Jools says: And then there's all you thinking we run away from you, when we don't, and we reckon you're running away from us half the time, so there must be some huge misunderstanding that's made me truly depressed and now my mum wants to talk to Miss Imber! Jools says: At least you guys didn't prank me at one in the morning, or my mum would be really annoyed Jools says: And Pooj's calculator! What was that about?? Clare says: Dunno, I left it with Loz Clare says: I said I'd buy her a new one when I got mine cuz I was the one who left it with Loz Jools says: Yeah, but you know damn well what Mel was doing Jools says: It's cute how insecure Mel is Jools says: She knows what it's like to be shunned, so she's being extra-nasty to avoid it  Jools says: But it's not going to last.  People aren't shoved out for eternity.  I mean, look at Loz!  Sure, she's really paranoid now, but at least she's mates with all of you lot  Jools says: I suppose it's the circle of life.  There's always gonna be someone who gets blanked out Jools says: In the shells, it was Pooj, then Loz, this year it was Lucy, now me and Pooj  Jools says: Well hey, look who's lined up for the third year Clare says: You and Pooj aren't being blanked out, you two secluded yourselves. Originally it was Pooj, Jools and Clare if you remember but then guess who got shoved out?? EVERYONE else Clare says: I'm not having a go Clare says: It's just Clare says: It's always been you two Clare says: And you never let anyone else in Clare says: Without being hypo Clare says: That's where everyone get fed up, and everyone just thought if they don't wanna be with us, then why do we want to be with them? Clare says: Therefore we left you alone Clare says: And then all this stuff happened where apparently everyone was pissed at me Clare says: I left it at that Clare says: And now everyone's fallen out  Jools says: Oh my god *hits self on head* this is just one big misunderstanding Jools says: Hold on, lemme explain Jools says: At Easter, Pooj told me that you and Charlo said you were annoyed with me for going on about Elliott Jools says: So then Pooj got a crush on *** Clare says: I was NEVER annoyed at u for going on about Elliott.   Jools says: Well, anyway, it doesn't matter  Clare says: I'll tell you bout that in a moment Clare says: Okay Clare says: Carry on Jools says: So we reckoned that it was best if we kept out of your way, cuz you know how we both like a good rant about fit guys Jools says: (At that point I didn't know how mad you were about Matt) Jools says: So we'd just go off and talk about Elliott, Andrew, etc Clare says: Okay Clare says: (Whoever Andrew is) Clare says: Lol  Jools says: And then one lunchtime we were sitting on the benches outside the English block Jools says: And we saw you lot coming up from the language block towards us Clare says: OH CRAP (carry on) I just wrote on my birth certificate by accident, oh noo Jools says: And you saw us, you turned around, and then suddenly everyone was moving in the opposite direction Clare says:  Really? Jools says: So me and Pooj were like, "So it's like that, is it" Jools says: And we started kinda avoiding you, cuz we reckoned that you lot were REALLY pissed at us Clare says: Ahh, I see Clare says: Is there more or is that the end? Jools says: Hold on, Jeremery's talking Clare says: Okay  Jools says: (Sorry, I always get distracted by pretty flashing lights) Clare says: Lol  Jools says: And the whole thing at Easter ... Pooj told me that you two we pissed off with me so I was like "Woah".  I wasn't like, pissed off with you, I was like, okay, what do I do now? So I backed off a bit ... a lot ... yeah. Clare says:  Us two being who? Clare says: I don't remember being pissed at all  Jools says: And then there was the Mel thing when term started again ... I mean, you SAID you were on my side but there was Mel taking the piss out of me all lunchtime, with you and charlotte almost pissing yourselves about it (although trying to conceal it when I was there)  Jools says: And there was something else ...  I'm trying to get this all sorted out so there's no tension back at school (but I'm still not talking to Mel or Charlotte) Clare says: I'll admit to that even though I got so sick of it by the end and by the fact that you nearly started crying so I told her to shut up Clare says: Ohh I know what it was Clare says: Something about me being a hypocrite? Clare says: I think?? Jools says: *Cocks head to one side* you wha huh? Jools says: There was the thing about me being pissed off with you, but I wasn't Jools says: I thought you were pissed off with me Jools says: And I said some stuff to Mel to cheer her up and cuz I was feeling really bitter Clare says: Was that in history?? Cuz Charlo was asking the questions not me and then I found out you were on about me I was like ... oh, pml  Jools says: Yeah, that thing in history Clare says: If Charlo says anything just tell her to piss the hell off, okay? Clare says: I've already told her to lay off you but if she doesn't listen don't listen to anything she says just block her Jools says: She just said "Heya" Clare says: And I'll stick up for you at school as well if she says anything Jools says: But I'm blanking her so *shrugs* she can shove her pranks up her arse and piss off, in the (slightly altered) words of Freddie Mercury Clare says: LMAO  Jools says: It's in house of rock Jools says: That episode is soooooooo funny Clare says: ARGH CHARLOTTE   Jools says: Whattabout Charlotte? Clare says: Sorry Clare says: Lol Clare says: She's being a twat about this whole thing Clare says: Cuz I told her to lay off cuz I don't think it's fair and I think we should make up and she thinks you're doing it just to stay in the Fousseau room.  I've already told her I'll go if we don't settle this Clare says: *Calms down* Clare says: Lol, sorry Jools says: Right, hold on a moment, I'm just gonna have a word with Charlotte Clare says: NOO Clare says: DON'T Clare says: DON'T Clare says: DON'T Jools says: Wait, she's blocked me Clare says: DOOOOOOON'TTTTT Jools says: Well, that's convenient Clare says: Ach. Do you have Broadband, btw? Jools says: I was gonna say "I WOULD RATHER SUCK OFF HORVATH THAN STAY IN A ROOM IN FOUSSEAU WITH YOU, SO YOU DON'T NEED TO WORRY ABOUT THAT." Jools says: Nope, don't have Broadband Clare says: Dang nabbit  Jools says: Should I email her that ... *strokes chin in thought* Clare says: Nah don't cuz then we'll fall out even MORE and I really want everyone to make peace  Jools says: So do I, that's why I'm not talking to Mel or Charlotte   Jools says: Soo much more peaceful Clare says: Btw, I'm not trying to judge ANYTHING but do you like Ria now? Just so I don't offend anyone by what I say or do??  Jools says: Yeah I do like her, I think the only reason I didn't like her was that she didn't like me  Jools says: But I don't really know her Clare says: Oki doki, I'll zip myself shut, lol Jools says: Well, I don't really know her well enough to tell her anything you would say Jools says: And now I really wanna know *hops from one foot to the other* Clare says: Lol, you already know basically, I just didn't wanna complain about her if you had become good mates with her Clare says: Or were becoming Clare says: In case I offended you Clare says: I don't like her cause I know what she says about us from Dap  Jools says:  Woah.  has she said anything about me or Pooj? (Sorry, I know I'm really self-centred.  It comes from only having to focus on oneself and only one other person for so long) Clare says: Oh she just talks about all of us. Before she started hanging around with you two, she said her least favourite person in the class was you, and Pooj second, then Mel third, then me fourth Clare says: And then Charlo asked her again Clare says: And she goes, "Yeah, I like them," and Charlo goes, "But the other week you said you didn't," and she goes "No, I didn't." Clare says: AHHH I'm sorry, I'll shut up, I'm causing more distress Clare says: Sorry I forgot my peace aim then Jools says: Well I s'pose she wouldn't've wanted her two only mates to find out that a few days ago she hated us Jools says: Screw peace.  Arguments are fun. Jools says: Unless they're like this one ... you should've seen the state I was in after that prank  ools says: My sister and mum hate you, Charlo, Mel, Loz and Lumo now Jools says: My dad doesn't care though Clare says: Really? I GLADLY had nothing to do with it Clare says: The one about Puja was worse though Clare says: I think there was something to do with an Indian accent? Clare says: I just left the tent Clare says: And ran around Jools says: My mum goes, "Ju got pranked by some ex-friends today," and my dad goes, "Well, she probably deserved it" Clare says: Well, if it makes you feel any better I scared the crap out of them at that sleepover Clare says: It was proper funny, I told them all about my mum being psychic, and then a few hours later Clare says: I went Clare says: TURN THE LIGHTS ON TURN THE LIGHTS ON NOW Clare says: And they all crapped themselves Clare says: It was damn funny Jools says: Lol Clare says: They didn't think it was though Jools says: But god ... the ones they did to pooj were more insulting to me than her Clare says: They all had a right go at me Clare says: Especially Lucy Clare says: Were they? Clare says: What did they say?  Jools says: Yup Jools says: The first one was just, "Hi, it's Tom, do you wanna go out on Friday?" but the second one was, "Hi, it's Jools, I'm a bitch and I just got back from America ..." or something like that Jools says: God, I have this horrible feeling you're just sitting there laughing at me while I pour all this out Jools says: And telling Charlo Clare says: You can ring me if you like, I'm as serious as a ... what's serious? A legal document? Clare says: I swear to god I'm not telling Charlo Jools says: And then the two of you having a right old chuckle Clare says: Here, I'll copy and paste the convo Clare says: Charlo says: What's she said?? Charlo says: Cuz she won't talk to me Charlo says: ......... Clare says: Nothing, it's just she's told me her side of the story Clare  says: And I really think we should make up with her cuz she's really, really upset Charlo says: Oooh, oooh, spill Clare  says: And I feel really sorry for her Charlo says: You can, but you know she's probably doing this so she can stay in our room Charlo says: Please copy and paste it Clare  says: No, cuz you'll just twist it Clare says: And then she either blocked me or went offline Jools says: I really want to send her that email ... can't I send her that email?? Oh ... Jools says: She's SO not invited to ma party  Clare says: I wouldn't give it the time of day Clare says: The email that is Jools says: I just want to get everything clear in her puny brain  I truly don't want to spend any time at all in your room cuz (no offence) you've made my life total hell for the past two months Jools says: I've cried so much about this over this past week it's incredible that my eyes haven't run out of moisture.  And that I have any mascara left cuz it keeps running.   Clare says: I didn't even realise anything was affecting you, was it the prank thing that made you cry or did they do something else? Did I do something else??? Clare says: I thought you'd know cuz I told Pooj I wasn't pissed at you and stuff but I thought you hated me therefore you wouldn't care ...? But I'm not sure she's told you Jools says: Well, you know on the 1st April when no one could go out and you and Charlo had that sleepover and we haven't really been properly friends since then?? Jools says: Yeah, Pooj told me but she didn't really believe you Jools says: At all Clare says: Yeah Clare says: I've gotta be a little bit more honest Clare says: I wasn't pissed at you at all Clare says: I was a bit pissed at her Clare says: I can't remember even why now Jools says: Oh? Well, I don't wanna really get into this, cuz I'm gonna have to tell her everything you do realise, and so ... yeah Clare says: But then I sort of figured how stupid I was Clare says: Yeah, I think she knows Clare says: I think I told her?? Clare says: Ah well Clare says: If not, there you are Clare says: Lol  Jools says: Anyway, there were these really nice jeans in Skud that I wasn't allowed, so I just thought, hey, I'm not allowed anything, jeans, shoes, dresses, and then I thought that if I'd been allowed out that one night, we wouldn't've fallen out, cuz you and Charlo wouldn't've had that sleepover that really sparked everything off Jools says: So I was crying my eyes out Clare says: No, I know what started everything off and it DEFINITELY was not your fault Jools says: Cuz I just wanted everything to be how it was in September or March, cuz Dan wasn't having a go at me and we hadn't fallen out Clare says: I'm not trying to point fingers … but I know for a fact that Charlotte's never really liked you. And I thought she was alright but she'd been really influenced by Ria in the past Jools says: Oh? Jools says: (But my mum thought I was crying about not being allowed the trousers so she let me have these gorgeous shoes that previously she wouldn't let me have cuz they were too high, lool) Clare says: Right stuff all this explaining infact; cuz it's not gonna get me anywhere it's just going to lead to my own better understanding and probably a more confuddled vision on your own side; so all I'm gonna say is that I'm really super sorry for anything I've done to make you upset I had no idea that you were this distraught. I'm really super duper sorry and if you want me to stick up for you just ask cause I feel SO guilty for not getting rid of the prank thing and just going in the garden Jools says: I had such a stress when you started talking to me Jools says: I was like, "Oh my God, the last time I spoke to any of them was the 28th and that was when Charlotte had a huuuge go ..." Clare says: I didn't know you were pissed. I bet you were like, ARGH, BITCH, TALKING TO ME ABOUT THAT SLEEPOVER Clare says: But I didn't know much about the pranks  Jools says: I thought you were gonna have a go at me Clare says:  Why would I have a go at you? Jools says: Or say something really nasty and block me Jools says: Cuz I thought you and Charlotte were like, proper best friends and everything, and she's always really mean to me on MSN Clare says: Hmm, funny situation with me and Charlo at the minute, lol Clare says: As long as she likes Ria, I could never be her best mate Clare says: I mean, I still like her Jools says: I thought she didn't like Ria  Clare says: But she knows exactly what Ria's like  Jools says: Ria was only hanging out with us cuz Charlotte was blanking her out Jools says: And Ria's nice and everything but ... me and Pooj are like, y'know .. Jools says: Everything was really weird with her there Jools says: We're used to all the rest of you Jools says: But Ria? It just doesn't happen Jools says: And I'm always really quiet with people I don't know Jools says: So if Pooj left us alone for a minute, I'd be like, all clammed up Jools says: It wasn't v. nice Jools says: Sorry, I'm rambling here Clare says: No, it's alright Clare says: Ramble away Clare says: You know what I'm like, for Christ's sake, lol Jools says: Lol Jools says: I might just put Charlotte and Mel into a contacts group of their own and call it "The Bitches" and block them both  Jools says: But I've already got all of Mel's accounts in one group, and every single one is blocked Jools says: And if it's true confessions time, I NEVER blocked charlotte Clare says: Ooo! I have a confession as well Jools says: I wish I had, cuz it would've been way less trouble, but I DIDN'T Jools says: Ooo?? Clare says: My confession is Clare says: Yeah, I did block you, but I didn't mean it in offence to you, I just did it because you were being a bit too sarcastic and sardonic for a person who has had the worst Friday in a lifetime, lol!! I just couldn't take it at that moment so I thought stuff it, blocked everyone that was talking to me except Dap cuz I was rambling on to her about (woe betide) my bad Friday, lol  Clare says: I really didn't mean it just to piss you off Jools says: Oh yeah, about that Jools says: You blocked me on Friday, and then Pooj said something to you about it, and you unblocked me Clare says: She didn't say anything Clare says: It was when I saw your name I unblocked you  Jools says: But then when I came online again, you'd blocked me again, and that was like, on the Monday or something Jools says: So you wouldda blocked me again over the weekend Jools says: And I was like, "Whaaaaat?" Clare says: Did I end up leaving the conversation with you and pooj in a bit of a huff? Jools says: Yup Clare says: Ahhh Clare says: Then I was probably just being moody Clare says: Iggy me, lol Jools says: Okies, lol Jools says: I thought I was being really clever then, pml Clare says: OH YEAH, I remember Clare says: Cuz I forgot to unblock you again Clare says: And then Pooj had a huge go at me for blocking you and why did I do it Clare says: And I was like I couldn't even remember blocking you, lol  There was more, but I forgot to save it.  And there was more after that that I did save, but it's unimportant.  Unless you're reeeally nosy.    I was re-reading it and a lot of the things she said I'm really annoyed about now.  Oh well.  And I am talking to Charlotte, but it's TOTALLY not my fault.  She just keeps talking to me.  Bitch.  Not talking to Mel though.  She's totally sucking up to Pooj, but she's not talking to me or something.  Well at least she's in pain.  MWUH HAH HAH HAH HAH HAH.  I'm gonna go now, cuz I think Pooj wants to read it.  And her boyfriend is so bloody fit!!  *Spits* Aw, I'm only kidding, Pooj.  Leave comments on my blog, people!  Leave them!  Hey, new rule, you read, you comment.  If you don't, then I sentence you to smelling for the rest of your life.  And as Sean says, if you do, I shall give you a million love dollars.  Actually, it's not worth quite that much.  I shall give you fourteen and a half love dollars if you leave a comment on my blog at least once a fortnight.  Thanks, darlings!  Vale! *~Jools~*

      I hate this crappy crappy stuff.  It's Saturday today (at least, I think it is.  I could be wrong) and on Monday I have to go back to school and face  them .  I'm really quite scared about it.    Oh my God.  I'm just talking to Clare, and at first I was gonna be all sarky, then I opened up to her, now I'm just totally ranting.  I'll copy and paste it next time I post, cuz I'm saving it in Word and this conversation will just never end!! We're so totally friends now.  I don't think either of us are talking to anyone else.  It's just soo intense.  Charlotte, though?  Me and Charlo, Charlo and me, we're not speaking :D  I'll paste it in when I next post, if I remember.  I can't be bothered to write any more now.  But I think things are going to get better now (and Clare is soo invited to my party!!)  Hugs and kisses, *~Jools~*

      Hi.  I think I've stopped crying, but my mascara must look really amazing.  I really should've got waterproof stuff ... oh well, I don't exactly cry at school, so it doesn't matter what happens when I'm at home.  Although, I could imagine that happening now, if everything carries on ...  Mel and Charlo are being so horrible about everything.  They were pranking me and Pooj today.  They stopped pranking me when my mum picked up, but I wish they'd rung again so Katherine could have yelled at them.  It's so awful thinking that they have my mobile  and  my home number.  Oh God.  I just thought.  If they're all round Mel's house (which they are, I just found out from Pooj) they're probably sleeping over.  So at one in the morning ... oh God, it's too horrible to think about.  But my mum brought it up when my dad came home for dinner, and so she goes, "Ju got pranked today, by people who used to be her friends," and my dad goes, "Well, she probably deserved it."  I just left the room crying, cuz this whole thing since like, 1st April has been absolutely horrible.  (Yes I know, horrible is the word of 2004.)  I don't know what I've done, I certainly don't think I've deserved any of it, and my dad just says that when I was crying my eyes out earlier, while they were ringing me.  I had to go retrieve my phone from the kitchen, and my mum goes, "I think you need to say something to her," and he goes, "I didn't mean to upset you ..." but I just walked out.  I can't be bothered with it anymore.  He's always so horrible to me.  He constantly calls me evil, a show off, a fashion victim, a social butterfly ... why do I have to put up with it?  I got all this crap from Dan first of all (early November to mid-February), then everyone falls out with me and Pooj (beginning of April to present) and all the way through my dad's getting on my case.  My mum does it too, but she hasn't done it so much since I asked her why she was always trying to bring me down.  On a happier note, well, actually, there is no happier note.  I can understand why Pooj doesn't mind that much (*grins knowingly* get in there, Pooj!) but what is there left for me? TV?  Joy, I can just see the rest of my life in front of me.  I become like the 44 stone woman in Texas, eating fast food crap and watching the skinny people on Instant Abs and Windsor Pilates and Lose Weight With Cathy and all the other exercise infomercials.  God, I hope not.  I wouldn't be able to afford all that anyhoo, with no job.  Seriously, I can see no bright star on the horizon right now.  I suppose summer holidays ... but that's a month away, and I have to bear Le Fousseau with the Prankers and everyone else who hates me and wants to kick me and my best friend out of the dormitory.  Yeah, like that's going to help our friendship bucket loads.  At least if we were in the dormitory, then they wouldn't be able to bitch about us openly.  So it would all burn up inside them, and they'd get sooo annoyed.  But really, I don't get what we've actually done.  Apparently we always run away from them, every time we see them.  Hell- o , I walk in the formroom, they walk out.  We see Clare, she sees us, they turn and walk in the opposite direction.    I guess I'll just not talk to them when school starts again.  But that could get me in worse trouble.  I really don't know what to do ... and there's nothing really happy going on in my life at all right now.  I mean, there are some fun things, like I'm going to Pooj's mum's school tomorrow to live life as a toddler, and there's all the new clothes and things ... (two pairs of jeans and a new top today, cotton candy flavoured lip gloss yesterday, a bag and these gorgeous shoes on Monday) but the prospect of school on Monday is horrible.  I never want to see the place again.  There are no fifth years, and if they've reached the stage of pranking us, they  really  hate us now.  School will be dreadful.  I hate it only being me and a couple of other people against the world.  I mean, I love our friendship and everything, cuz now it's really close, but still ... I'd feel better if I had a giant army of dragons to squish Mel, Lucy and Clare - but especially Charlo.  She's such a bitch!!  All I do is spend ages trying to make peace with someone I hate, then what?  She throws it back in my face.  Gotta go.  I hope I don't run into my dad.  I don't think I can cry much more.  Much lovings, *~Jools~*

      Hello.  I am bored.  I rang Pooj ages ago and she wasn't there.  (Where the hell are you Pooj?  It's not like you to not ring back.  I miss you like hell!! I haven't spoken to you since, what, the Saturday before I left? That was the 3rd, and now it's the 11th!!) My birthday is in seven days and *squee* I am soooo psyched.  I mean, it hasn't been my birthday for a whole year!!  (Duh ...)   Ach.  I reeeeally need to talk to Pooj! Where are you?  I've losted you!  (Like learned, only not.)  Oh yeah!  To kill time, I can go into my theory about feet.  Last night, while we were on the way to the restaurant (oh my God, we were in Malta then!) I started saying how I think we should have pods instead of feet. Like big suction cups, so we could walk on walls and ceilings.  We wouldn't have to wear shoes, so high heel-pain would be thing of the past.  So then Katherine said that pods would be so weird, but I said well, if we had pods, we'd think feet were so weird! Think about it, it makes sense.  I can't be bothered anymore.  I'll just publish this and *sniffs* more on.    Ciaow! *~Jools~*  By the way, it's my 13th birthday in seven days.  I said I was 13 already on my profile.  I can't remember why.  You probs can't use it if you're not 13.  So anyways, in seven days (or most probably eight, maybe even nine plus) I can correct it to be my real age.  So yes, I was born in the year of the goat, not the horse.
