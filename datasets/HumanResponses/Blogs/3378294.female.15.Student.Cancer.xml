      Many people think, it was the last episode of 'Friends' last night. I also have my 'contacts' who have told me otherwise. there is going to be another episode if the sitcom, but as it is 'The One Where They All Die'. it is slightly unsuitable for family viewing. there you go. NOT the last, just almost.

      That's right! I know!  It will be very interesting, because the new contestants are somewhat, special.  But I can't tell you. Sorry. Security reasons. Just tune in.

      I was wondering if you knew that the   world is actually a cubic shape  . It's true!   Scientists   made the whole spherical thing up  just for more money, but I know the truth. All those photos from space are  just fakes !

      According to my good friend Ronnie Werner, of  urlLink Ronnie Werner Illustration ,  Mr. Foreman and Miss. Beacon are getting married!    You heard it here first, folks!   Details of the most prestigous union of the year will follow.  I sure do hope they allow  Hello  or  OK  the rights to their wedding photos. They will be the most interesting and glamourous yet!

       I was happily walking down the dirty streets of liverpool today, when I saw Mavis Beacon.  Now it was only a shot glance, but I am positive it was here.  For those of you who do not know, Mavis Beacon is the brilliant typing tutor and black (oh, sorry, afro-carribean) woman, who found software so good,  she put her name on it !  Much like  urlLink George Foreman , come to think of it.

      i am so happy! i wonder why everything i worry about DOESN'T turn out as bad as i thought...? not that i'm complaining, as what i thought could turn into a major crisis, is now in fact not a crisis at all, but i a fabarooooo thang! x

      it was, unfortunately, the LAST EVER EPISODE OF 'FRIENDS'! Last night! it was rather tragic, and i thought i was going to cry, but i couldn't bring myself to do so.... But what i want to know is, if Rachel and Ross are an item, Pheobe and Mike, are married and so are Monica and Chandler, who has Joey got? BUT then i realised that he has the cutest 'Duck Junior' and 'Chick Junior' ever! (and obviously, he only has to ask and i'll come running!)

      I'm soo sorry for this everone, but i have now got a bit of an obsession with crap jokes...(it was Gus, i swear!) So here goes.. 1. Why did the Chicken cross the road? to get to the other side!  2. Why did the Gum cross the road? Because it weas stuck to the chicken's foot!  3. Why did the lamb cross the road? Because it murdered the Chicken!  4. Why did the pervert cross the road? Because his penis was stuck in the chicken's arse!!!  hahahahahaha i am so sick... xx

      i had the weirdest night's sleep EVER last night, as i was watching BB5. Does anyone not think that Marco, although he is hilarious, is actually quite irritating? Also Jason is an arrogant twat, and i've only 'known' him for a few hours!!!! lol x p.s. try sleeping curled up on a 2 seater sofa- it's actually really comfortable!!!

      since the recent 'pranking walrus' season has started i've decided that i don't need anyone but myself and my friends.  definition of 'friend' : 1. does not constantly ditch people and go off with other bitches instead. 2. is there for others when needed (unless emergency prevents it) 3. takes into consideration other's feelings, state of mind, and whether it will kill them if you state something. 4. LISTEN TO WHAT THE OTHER PERSON IS SAYING 5. getting the facts right before judgementing   6. giving helpful critisism not just putting them down all the FUCKING TIME!  hhmmm.... that was maybe a bit harsh...  or not

      I'm sure everyone who actually goes on this site (which is me.. and ....me.) would of read the FAB jokes that gus made up (well... some she did). the mistress of all shite jokes has once again shocked the world!  She has made a 'part B.' to the joke about the chicken and the lamb.. its a tacky one.. :-) Why did the lamb cross the road?  Because it murdered the chicken! (erm.. haha...)  Why did the pig cross the road? Because it was arresting the lamb! (erm.. )

      I am seriously pissed off at myself. Majorly. i did something yesterday that i'm still feeling guilt for. Some people will probably think it's pathetic etc.. but i hated doing it and i hate it now. i smoked yesterday for the first time in about 2 months and as soon as i had started (although i felt alot less stressed) i was sooo mad at myself. So if anyone wants to be mad, feel free, i am!  DON'T SMOKE!!! IT'S A DISGUSTING HABIT N IT MAKES U SMELL REALLY BADLY N NO BLOKE WILL HAVE YOU IF U DO!!!

      Has anyone tried my 'potion' yet? i actually wouldn't recommend it, as i did get a lil bit too pissed even for my liking! (ask Ben J. and Schmeek! lol) But if u really want to try it, i would also recomment you try putting more tequila in it, and less Stella. The Stella makes it taste DISGUSTING! lol x

      Did any of you people watch the LAST BIG BROTHER last night?oh of course you did, how stupid of me... but for anyone who missed it.... Nadia won! She had been the bookies favourite for the past six weeks, but in my opinion it was either her or Dan who were destined for the stardom and money they deserve. it was soo sweet when Nadia's mother came out- she had come all the was from portugal and her and Nadia hadnt seen each other for over a year! it was... *sniff*  heart wrenching!
