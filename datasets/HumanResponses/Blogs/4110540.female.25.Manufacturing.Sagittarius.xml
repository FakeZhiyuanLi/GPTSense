           My work cut my hours so I was off tonight. My hubby had to work. It was ok at first. I hung out with my mom for awhile. But when I got home I got so lonely. This house has so many ghost. I'm sad today. I dunno why. Just feel sad. I guess sometimes ya have to be sad so you appreciate the happy.

          a whisper and a dream of days gone by. I sat to myself today and thought about where I come from. I just got to thinking of the house I grew up in and how small my life was. The pictures on the website really got me to thinking. My parents are great. They have been married now for about 27 years. Sure they have their ups and downs but they love each other. And to top it off they only knew each other 6 months before they where engaged. Amazing huh. I guess sometimes when you meet the one.. You know. They where great parents they raised me and my younger brother in a small 3 bedroom home in Lexington. We had a yard to play in and children on the street to play with. All my memories of home are really great. Although we moved when I was 12 the memories there are still as clear as can be.. Which for me and my memory is a good thing. I remember in kindergarten I caught the wrong bus on the way home. no one noticed that I was even on the bus until the end of the ride when only one kid remained. I was so scared.. I couldn't stop crying. I thought I'd never see home again. So when my brother who is 3 years younger started school I never left his side. I made sure he was on the bus right beside me. I even went and got him after school to walk him to the bus. The bus with the bunny on the side.. :) ok well I guess that is enough walking though memory lane for now. I'll be back again another day.. Until then God bless and goodnight.. Love Jennifer

          This weekend has been a slow one.. I went shopping yesterday and got a few clothes.. and today we went to my cousin stacy's house to see her and her 3 girls.. they are all so cute.. I held sarah for a little while she is only 2 months old.. and katelyn who is not even 2 yet was very playful with me.. Destany the oldest at 3 years i think was the funest.. she chased greg all over that house. it was cute...we went with mom and dad after we ate at ryans.. it was nice. we rented some movies so i think we'll spend the rest of the weekend chill'n at the house. Well until later..  Jen
