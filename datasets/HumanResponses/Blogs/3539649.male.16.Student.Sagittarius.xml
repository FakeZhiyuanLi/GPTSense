      yeh i counted them..im so excited but yet again i still have 5 more tests representing about 42 percent of my final grade..i cant take it..its to much evil in one week...this is what it does to people..  The Pasta Dude (4:42:03 PM): they're hurting my brain, cause today i was looking at my knee and just staring at the briuse on it as it bled, and i wondered "Wouldn't it be awesome if there was some adhesive piece of cloth that would remain on my leg to collect all the blood so that I could still move but not get blod on my pants?" then i saw the box of band-aids and said "I know! I'll take this carabord box to my knee! That'll work!" and so now i am sitting here with caraboard taped to my leg cause i forgot that band-aids kick ass  the only people getting anything good out of these tests are pornographers... 1500 chaminade students + stuck home to study = porn....anyway its ilke 5 and i have the house to myself for hours but i have to resist doing anything fun so i can read words in a language i will never use except while trying to pick up girls at taco bell...addios amigos

      compliments of the harvard lampoon  Today, with adult education on the rise, and senior citizens enrolling in all the self-improvement programs they can find, it is becoming harder and harder to confuse the elderly. To help you adjust, I've collected twelve sure-fire ways to confuse your grandmother and set them down here. I hope they prove useful.  What you do: Tell your grandmother that your grandfather is gay. Grandma: 'Oh yes, he's a merry old fellow all right...' You: 'No, Grandma, "gay" means "dead."'  What you do: Take your grandmother to a gay bar. Grandma: 'Why are all those men dancing with each other?' You: 'Those aren't men, Grandma - those are holograms.'  What you do: Take your grandmother to a gay porno film. Grandma: 'Oh my word!' You: 'So, Grandma - how do you like Nintendo?'  What you do: Go to your grandmother's house for dinner and pile your plate sky-high with peas. Grandma: 'My, junior, I had no idea you were so fond of peas!' You: 'Peas? I thought they were marijuana pellets.'  What you do: Show up at your grandmother's door wearing a false nose. Grandma: 'Oh you, always the kidder!' You: 'Don't laugh, Grandma; I have lyme disease.'  What you do: Go for a drive with your grandmother. Turn the radio up to full volume on static. Grandma: (covers ears) 'Make it stop!' You: 'Aw c'mon Grandma, don't you dig jazz?'    What you do: Take your grandmother to the zoo. Grandma: (admiring the ducks) 'My, such lovely creatures...' You: 'Can I have five bucks Grandma? I wanna go get a microdonkey.'  What you do: When your grandmother comes to visit, sit in the living room playing with a viewmaster. Grandma: 'Hello, junior, how are you today?' You: 'Shhh! I'm recalibrating my penis!'  What you do: Ask your grandmother what year she was born. Grandma: '1914.' You: 'Wow...so you were alive when Jethro Tull was president!'  What you do: Buy your grandmother a gold necklace and have her try it on. Grandma: 'How does it look?' You: 'Oh, Grandma - it's perfectly cumfucked!' Grandma: 'What?' You: 'I mean it looks like shit.'  What you do: Sever the corpus calosum connecting the left and right hemispheres of your grandmother's brain. Grandma: (pointing to spoon) 'Fork.' (clutching head and trembling) 'Fork!' You: 'Ha ha, Grandma. I confused you.'  What you do: Buy your grandmother a V.C.R.; ask her to set it to record your favorite show every weeknight. Grandma: 'I'd love to, junior; programming V.C.R.'s is something of a hobby of mine.' You: No!! Foiled again!!!

       There was once an asian midget names jamal and he has 2 very good friend theres names also were jamal which was very annoying when anybody said jamal so he gave them nicknames, toby and lorenzona. They were all in the park one day when a bus full of baseball players heading for the allstar game got lost and pulled up and asked them for directions, all 3 friends got in the bus to find out it was all a scam…it was really carrot top and they kid from the dell commercials..they wanted to kidnap the jamal threesome. They chained them up and took them on a boat to the exotic Rutherford new jersey, it was there that they were all forced to walk the plank into a giant tub of steak-ems and mustard.they went in and over 10 years ate them selves out but by then they all had long beards that were tangled in a knot so now they had to walk around like that…they walked like that to the bar and got drunk cause they were depressed about spending 10 years in a pool of steak-ems and mustard then when they were walking around town all drunk and tied to gether by facial hair they met another jamal..but this wasn’t any ordinary jamal this was an evil jamal…who wore a large pink hat…he took all three jamals and shoved them in a pizza oven then ate them…he later died of food poisoning from all the steam-ems filled jamals…at the funeral the pink panther and brad pitt made a speech about the increasing gas and milk prices but that was a bad idea because everyone that had every starred in a got milk comerical was there…they took brad and the panther and drowned them in wat else milk…then the olsen twins and jamals friend howard went to the store and bought cookies and ate cookies and drank beer all night…even though they are all underage..then they got arrested and hung…cause its texas and there crazy there…then the whole group menudo road of on motorcycles into the California sunset..then end   by me  There was this teenage dude named....Dell? Dell was one of those kids that has a couple of close friends but all of them are in the same situation as him. His friends are the people who are picked last in gym class, not necessarily mocked, just not noticed. They were nearing the end of their junior year in high school and their finals started the next day, summer was there they just had to get through it. Now ya see, Dell is an avg student, he does exceptionally well in some classes and in others not so well. But one of his friends...Harmon, is doing pretty shitty and he needs help passing the finals so that he doesnt have to attend summerschool so Dell and Harmon decide to get a 3rd buddy, this guy...Kardon. Kardon is a fuckin genius and hes pretty naive, so they all get together and start planning the perfect way to cheat their way through. Even with all teh help that Harmon is gettin he just cant seem to memorize the different signals and coding. He jokingly mentions that itd just be easier if the teacher died so that school was cancelled and he wouldnt hafta take it. Dell is kinda an adventurous guy and in his sick perverted mind hes always thought about killing someone but never thought he could act on it. Kardon is a lil timid abuot the idea but he is finally tricked into it by the other guys, so Harmon creeps into the basement and gets a couple pliers and wrenches. the 3 of them sneak over to the teachers house and decide that cutting the brakeline is too played out and very noticable so they slowly start to loosen the lugnuts on the wheels. The morning of the test theyre all happy they they wont have to take this test, until, the teacher walks in, safe as can be, their plan didnt work at this Harmon explodes, for some reason he didnt expect the lugnuts thing to work, so he had stolen his dad's pistol the night before, he reached into his back, pulled out the shiny metal barrel by its wood stock and cocked it. He walked right up to the teacher, aimed the gun to the back if the teachers head and pulled the trigger, the blast alone shook him straight but that didnt stop him, he fired again and it blew the teachers brains all over the class  by rich curran   scruffywagles was walkin down the street and he found some crak n wuz like 'yp..its crack' and the smoked his newly found crack and be came super powerful and became scruffywaglesmeister van death... he began to run around pillaging and burning and drinking all the beer in town.... untill all the people had no beer left (OH NO) .... the end  by fran
