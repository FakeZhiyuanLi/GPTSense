       hihi! this is my 1st entry!! after so many of my frienz got it, i finally got tempted enough to set up one. today's quite enjoyable...except for e beginning of the day. i try to list out today's events, and i specify TRY!!! haha...cos i have a short term memory...sobZ...    &nbsp;  anyway, this morning i woke up late. tot i surely a goner one...with my stupid bro hogging the common toilet n stuff... but miraculously, i wasnt late today!! (Even more miraculously, i was only late once this whole year!! even i can't believe it!! haha...then the&nbsp;usual stuff&nbsp;with lessons and all...talking about hw, i alwaz can't seem to catch up with any of the tutorials in class!! plus tt stupid roach&nbsp;wants me to stay in school every&nbsp;single day till 9pm for 3 whole MONTHS!! just thinking abt tt makes me ill... no wonder i got more "blank spots" on my head liao...sighz...ok, getting longwinded liao...blah blah..my break during econs. me and grace were chatting in the canteen...this ah beh comes to us carrying a basket full of little clips, calling us to buy some...feeling obliged to buy some as donation, we finally agreed to share. it's 1.50. we gave him 2 bucks but he kept staring at us as if expecting us to buy more... we don't know how to react and then he left. where's our change?!! it's not so much of the amount of it but e fact that he just assumed he could keep the change w/o our permission makes me angry..why can't he just give us the change? at least we can happily donate without feeling cheated...haha.    &nbsp;  end of school. i went to the library to study and shun bian wait for kailing to finish her chatting with her friend. met with a qn i can't do(as usual), then i saw yiyang beside photocopying his thick econs stuff...how convenient!! haha... then kailing came in and then we chatted the usual stuff about a certain group of ppl...today's incident is quite funny. as reported by kl, she said that as she was coming into the library, she met dua buei and botak.( this is a very very loooonng story for those who dunno) apparently these 2 buggers were staring at her...then as she turned around she caught them staring and "fear flickered in their eyes". they try to look as if they weren't looking...but to no avail. den blah blah...i was trying to look for dua buei cos i just spotted him coming in...i swung my chair and i caught kl's honkie monkie tonkie looking our way. so trying to be discrete, i turned my chair the other way to make it seem as if i was just glancing around the library...haha...then i turned to kl and tell her that...kl: "u mean like 3 secs ago??" me:" yar..." as if to prove me right, the nx thing we knew,  we heard that funny high pitch voice of his beside us !! he's talking to yiyang. it's ALL we could do to contain our sniggles. and kl practically had her nose touching e table by hiding her smiles. then later we found out that he came over to ask abt a gal's absence. so dumb! but i suspect it's bcos he wanted to find a chance to talk to kl, but unseccessfully, that is.    &nbsp;  On the bus, we came up with plans again as usual how to 'torture the gang', i find it very fun to always come up with new ideas on how to carry out our plans and the ideas are alwaz very lame yet funny and sometimes even 'gothic'. Sometimes i wonder how kailing got so much creative juice in her head, (mus be from her experience of watching numerous gothic movies) which i don't have...haha...god just isn't fair. Her&nbsp;trademark is to act innocent after finishing&nbsp;a gruelsome act. since she's the typical nerd to most of the teachers in their classes, no teacher will suspect her of coming up with such a mischief... and&nbsp;plus she's a 'victim' in&nbsp;siraj's eyes, she can absolutely get away with anything if she just&nbsp;denies it. If only i have such an innocent&nbsp;face!!! god just so isn't fair!! &nbsp;   &nbsp;  home. i went online and chat with a malay guy i met recently in irc. he's a yr younger than me. he's taking his o' lvls&nbsp;this yr and i gave him great advices.. then he add me to chat conference with his friends...at that point in time, i thought bitterly, 'wow, now i'm socialising with a bunch of kids!! Great." but as it turns out, it's&nbsp;quite fun lah. at least they dun introduce the common disgusting topic of sex into their conversations. they are pretty friendly too...hey so maybe&nbsp;it's quite enjoyable to chat with ppl below my age after all!!&nbsp;
