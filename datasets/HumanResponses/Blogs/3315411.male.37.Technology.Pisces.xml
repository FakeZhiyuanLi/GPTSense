      Lazy lazy lazy day. Did get slung with a new thingy to do.  Need to script share creation and set permissions from the command line. Can't seem to set permissions on sharenames with the stock stuff supplied with W2k. Found something called RMTSHARE.EXE that does the trick tho' - phew!

      Wouldja believe! It's four o'clock and I'm thru for the day! The whole team's gone home for the day. And they went at 3:30ish.   Here I am, this is me blogging away,  when home's where I'd rather be ;-)  [Apologies to Bryan Adams]

      Logged in just to say I'm bored. Nothing to do. Looks like google will not be inviting anyone for a gmail beta anytime soon. I'm doomed to get a gmail account after everyone else has theirs. Sheeeesh!

      Washed the good ole bike. Got cakes of dirt off it. The dirt around here has an attitude - 'twas smirking while I was cleaning it off the bike with a smug 'Not bad for a days work, wot?' attitude. Rode quite a smudgy bike to work. Got accosted by traffic like crazy. Grrr. Got late to work as a result.

      Bwahahaha! The bike started first kick today. The fuel guage marking is suspiciously low. Either this baby is a guzzler, or the fuel gauge is shot, or the guys at the pump ripped me off.

      First day with my Honda Dio. Couldn't get to kickstart it for nuts. Eventually gave up and used the electric start. That worked :) Will try kicking it to life this evening.   When its running, it purrs beautifully - must say I've taken to it like a fish to water. Now I hope it doesn't take to petrol the same way. ;-)  Sheesh! I just realized I'll have a ball locating it in the parking lot. I forgot to note the registration number. Groan!

      Nothing interesting. Just discovered Google redesigned the blogger service - which is how I came to know of this site :)

      There's this so-called 'think-tank' called the Alexis de Tocqueville Institution [they've apparently tanked their thinking]. Its president, Ken Brown has written a book stating open source using GPL is a bad idea. He makes further preposterous claims, stating Linus Torvalds stole Linux from MINIX. This junk is found on  urlLink this page   Linus Torvalds posted a  urlLink hilarious response  to this.  Andrew Tanenbaum, author of Minix, didn't really appreciate Ken Brown's report. Neither did he appreciate the way Ken Brown presented his so-called 'research'. You can read that bit  urlLink here   Ken Brown didn't quite take to Andy Tanenbaum's critique and posted his replies  urlLink here . He tried to further muddy Andy Tanenbaum, Linux, and Linus Torvalds.  Andy Tanenbaum couldn't resist writing this  urlLink rebuttal .  Will someone stop funding these ADTI jokers? They're a waste of precious time and energy [as Andy Tanenbaum's rebuttal indirectly states.]  [Update 1]:  Groklaw posted this hilarious parody  Is Brown Really the Father of Samizdat? - A Parody by Justin Moore

      Here's a good recipe for a skid: a few inches of rain water and muck all over the road. Here I am taking me wife back home from work - one would think a scooter would go nuts and weave all over the place. No sir, not this one. Steady as a rock, this Dio baby is. It just kept tracking where I pointed it. Darn thing was as steady as if it were on rails.

      Rediscovered QCD (Quintessential Player) after years - I started using it when it was a lightweight CD player.  It's sure grown in capability :) Think I'm going to switch from Winamp to QCD - it lacks a media library like Winamp, but I guess I can do without it. It does have a media library plugin, but it doesn't integrate very well - I'd rather see media library support native in QCD - so that skins affect the library window as well.

      A big thumbs-up to the folks over at Mozilla for fixing a security flaw in a matter of hours! Idiotic articles at newsfactor overhype the situation - they wrote -  urlLink "Mozilla Security Nightmare Begins"  - that security nightmare died a quick death for sure.   On July 7, at 13:46 hrs GMT, Keith McCanless filed a bug in the Bugzilla Database reporting a new vulnerability. It exploits the windows “shell:” handler and allows a malicious web page to execute a program on a client’s computer. On the same day, at 16:26 GMT, Josh Perrymon sent an e-mail to the “Full-Disclosure” mailing list about the vulnerability. The vulnerability is not private anymore, but public knowledge. Within a few hours - to be precise - 18:16 GMT - Mozilla developer "timeless" created a patch closing the vulnerability. Within a mere three minutes (18:19), the patch got approved by Mike Shaver. Within 11 hours, the patch is checked into the Mozilla, Thunderbird and Firefox branches. On July 8, 14:13 GMT the Mozilla foundation released an extension to allow users to patch their browser with just a few seconds worth of download.   In less than a day and a half of public vulnerability, all Mozilla versions were patched.

      The current SCO group makes a big fluff about  being there all of 25 years with Unix. Apparently  not when it comes to paying taxes tho' - and the  taxman here is our own govt. How'd ya like that?  As the groklaw site maintainer (Pamela Jones) states:  "How do you like them distinguishing themselves from Santa Cruz? Now, when the tax man is calling, they aren't Santa Cruz after all and aren't celebrating their 25th year in the UNIX business? They have that slogan on their web site: "1979 - 2004 Celebrating 25 years of UNIX® Solutions". And SCOForum this year is supposedly about celebrating that anniversary. Whoops! I think they need to rewrite their complaint in the IBM law suit too. Here they've been telling the world they are Santa Cruz, and somebody in India is taking them up on it."  Hah! I just love this :)
