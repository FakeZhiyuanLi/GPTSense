      Anyway, I can't sit around raving about the government all day.  I had a driving lesson today. God - that guy's insane! He had me (on my second lesson, mind - and I've never driven before!) bombing around Constitution Hill at 50km/h! I almost had a heart attack. Luckily, 'though, I didn't, and I'm still here to type all of this to you. Yeah, well, I suppose that scaring the shit out of your students is one way to ensure that they don't drive like idiots when you let them out onto the road after they get their licences. I mean, my best mate had his P plates for two weeks before he had his first accident - and I don't mean a little scraping, either! I'm talking a major, hi from hospital, thank god you've still got your legs deal. He couldn't walk properly for ages.  Makes you think, 'though - when we are more likely to die violently and horrifically than any other age group, is the price we pay for a tank of petrol really that important?  Thought for the day: Did they call Bali an act of God?

      You've gotta wonder whether anyone really trusts the government... I mean, who would trust a bunch of guys who have thousands of dollars each in superannuation, but no money to spend on health?  Who reckoned this war thing was a good idea, anyway?  I mean, brainstorm the word WAR...  Bombs, Guns, Bombers, Fighter Jets, Warships, Soldiers, Politics, Religion, Pillaging, Hate, Pain, Theft, Loss, Killing, Murder, Rape, Death, Destruction  Does anyone see anything happy about that list? (N.B. If your answer was yes, seek professional help.)

      Just last night I was watching the news and the headlines said that the man who was running the government in Iraq is dead. Assassinated by a bomb. Someone said to me after hearing that 'Well, Iraq's not going to go away in a hurry!' I want it to go away and leave me to my life.  You've gotta wonder what goes through the head of someone just before their car explodes.

      I was sitting at dinner with a few of my friends, and the conversation turned (as it often does) to the war in Iraq. WWI, WWII, Vietnam? It was always the young men who were sent out to fight. Young men like me.  I don't want to fight. I don't want to die.  Has the world lost its senses?
