      Well,tommorow have test and i haven't finished studying and doing homework.I just feel bit annoyed and stress.Actually today after tuition,I going to buy taufiq present but then I couldn't make any decision.So,I mostly will buy next week.Just now watch the TV 8 show,Cried until so badly.Keep saying sorry and asked God to granted their wishes.Sigh....life is just so unpredicted.                In darkness I start to find                   Just want a dim of light               No growth                  No voice                     No strenght                         No movement               What am I?                Cries linger in the room under the moonlight               Pain tortures me Orders stayed with me               When can the little wish of mine               Ever been granted?                Looking through my hopeless sight               Seeing them caring me with endless love               Until the end of their life.               When can I have voice to call 'Mum' and 'Dad'?                              Have you heard a sound from me?               From my heart?               The sound of my broken heart... ...  Save every life that you can,Good deeds shall never end. May God bless everyone....

      Don't know why,these days a bit unlucky,hope everything will be fine soon.Siew Huey is angry with me again.The reasons is:I didn't listen to her when she talk.If I really did that,I'm very sorry.But I don't know what can I do now?Apologize?I not really sure for that.hehe...I'm a very bad girl..haha   Yesterday got replaced class of Science.Before going to the laboratory,Vinod came and had a chat with Ting.I was so bored that I opened my History revision book and read few sentences of it.But,this is just not my type.So,I go find Tang for a chat.I asked him the way he study,his computer game and his sister.Quite a nice chat ^-^.Then I went to the lab with Ting and Hazel.Then Hazel suddenly said something that make me puzzled.ok,i knew it,I did something wrong again?   Oh that day is Khai Wan b'thday too.She seem very happy and her eyes seem have shone lights.That's just so special.Then I handed her a persent.I so glad that she seem very happy that day.I guess she had a great b'day.   Then at night,I met Mark online.Chatting with him made my mood become much better.Thanks for him so much.   But still...I just maybe need to change some of my irritating attitude.sigh....Hope everything will get better soon.

Then went to school,I handed the chocolate to Ting and Lay yen.I also chat with Shan Lei about the IU day(but mostly got class tambahan).I don't think I'll be going to the IU day.   Then when back to class,I threathen Bryan to delete the pic with his cow.We two start a fight but i managed to get the cow.But then,he used the teacher to threathen me.....sigh....a bit angry with him,but then he got said sorry,so everything alright.I felt very sleepy at the Science period and become energitic when History period.   When recess,I listen to Fhei Fhen mumbling about Weetat.Weetat just sometimes not that gentle to girls lar.Too bad for that.....When Chinese period,I and Emma kept on talking and talking.Quite a nice day to chat.   At last,it's Math period.Puan Katinah was sick but she still insist to teach and gave lots homework.Today was my turn to call people clean up the class but they just didn't listen to me and making fun on me.I'm very irritated to that.Luckily Taufiq got helped me do some work.Thanks him a lot.   Hope my luck will turn better soon ^-^

      just created my blog in the very early of the morning(5.58 am),hehe...juz too boring.Well,I'm so lazy to study as the exam is coming so near.I should start my studying soon afterward.So boring about that.... Last 2 days,I had just gone to a hall for FOMAD(Festival Of Drama & Music).On the way going to the Spastic hall,i get a really good nagging from my dad.Soon,i saw Shan Lei coming towards me.SHe seem moody about the way she going to chruch.Then Chui Wei came and we had gone approached her.Shan Lei is just so shy.Then we went to the counter and I saw Yean Ruey sitting there and hand me the CD that I had wished to borrow.Having a simple chat,we get a hand band from Abel and go into the hall. In the hall ,I just being so attracted to a girl that wear red band.So cool...She's the 3rd person I had being attracted too.Shan Lei and I enjoying ourselves playing the digital camera.We had took few photos.Soo,Dharine and Farha come and join us.Silence again....Shan Lei and I decides to walk bout.Then Yean Ruey introduced my net fren to me Sin Cheng Yeong,hotdog stall's boss.haha... Shan Lei and I back to our seats and Weetat the gang came.Weetat and Yean Ruey jus came beside me and start to sabo each other like kids.So funny..I just couldn't stop laughing for that.Nazalea also meet her partner,a boy from EC(cool hair). Then I borrowed Kenneth my camera,but in the end,he only took 2 useless pic and let the battery ends.Shit lar..I should take more picture be4 hand the camera to him.Sigh... The beginning part of the show is quite interesting.A special intoduction by Li Jie and his singing band is just great.Then drama,singing and....CONVENT DANCE!The girl that attracted me was on the stage and their dance is great.Soon,the show become lame.Shan Lei and I decides to buy something to eat.There got sell sandwiches,hot dog,ice cream,burger and drinks.SO little than I thought.But still I didn't buy the hot dog as ONE of my fren said is not very nice.hehe...But Shan Lei still got eat a hotdog with no bread and I went to buy a chicken burger.Then Shu Pei came to me  and we have a little chat. I not really remember what happened next.But nvm,hehe.Shan Lei and I back to the hall and watch a really stupid(funny?) drama of 'The Pearl'.Then Mark joined us after the drama.He said Shan Lei looked like Chui wei(Weetat said b4 too).hehe...Then cause got a irritating person sit beside me,I quickly went to find Yean Ruey for a chat.But....we just good friends since primary school,and he has girlfriend liao,the other people thought we what what pula.Futhermore still took picture...At first I teasing Yean ruey cause none of my business actually,but then I start to think will his girlfriend come and find me and giveme a slap?Hope not...I and Yean Ruey just a very good friend. Then Shan Lei,go to church with Chui wei and her gang,hehe..She seem enjoy her day. I was so lonely and I phoned my sis to pick me up earlier.After had a short chat with Mark,Yean Ruey,Bryan and Weetat,I went to the main gate to wait for my sister.Weetat and bryan came and acompany me(make fun of me i guess?).Almost after half an hour,my sister came in her boyfriend car.I bid Weetat and Bryan goodbye and went straight back home. I quite enjoy my day as I met many of my friend.Opps forget to say about wei-xun.He had become taller than me......sigh.....
