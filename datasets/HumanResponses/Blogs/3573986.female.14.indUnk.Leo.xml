      I'm 13 years old now, and one person said, "You are a teenager right now, and it is going to be a hard moment in ur life."  First time I don't really expecting that moment coz I know it's going to hard, but, right now, I feel it.. I'm going to be a teenager, and I'm starting to feel the difference from childhood into teenagerhood. Like she said, it's going to hard. I know, it's just the beggining, and  it's hard enough for me.   My mum is a great woman, she passed a very terrible childhood with her mother, and she is a very great mother for me right now. That's why I adore her so much. I have 3 sisters, mm, 3 older sister actually, and I'm the last. I'm the fourth.   Every one says that teenager is hard for everyone and for the child's mother coz she must help and face her child's bad behave. My mom, ... 3 times already.. And it's going to four. Me, the last one, I don't wanna be the worse of course.. It's hard for me, and it's going to a very long long hard way for me to pass. I try to behave as nice as possible, and again, it's hard. Well, there's none easy live, right?   Like all of teenager stuff, I'm thinking about boys and girls connection.. I know for sure that it's not my time to have a boyfriend, ofcourse!But,sometimes I wonder, why some of my friends making 'love' each other so sooN. What is it for? It's no use, I think. But sometimes I think the opposite, why do parents forbid their children to attach each other? it's for their experience, right? As long it doesn't disturb their school.. Why why and why?? Oh God, I'm a teenager, and it's hard.   And, sorry if my English is weird enough to make u lil bit confused.
