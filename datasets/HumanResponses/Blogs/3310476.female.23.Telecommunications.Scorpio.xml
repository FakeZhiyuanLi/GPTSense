      For some reason my last blog offended some men but the ladies loved it. hahaha. I got folks sayin "u want it 7? sheesh" and some saying "im not brown." And all I got to say is, too bad! hahaha.  I'm just kidding. Well, let me talk good stuff bout those two guys who said that then...  The first one, lets call him the teacher. He's real funny. He can get me laughing and laughing cuz he's got a great sense of humor. He is someone I know I can grow old with and I’m sure he’d make every year of our lives together special. He’s my best friend and always there when you need someone to just talk to about anything. We used to watch the planes taking off, eat ice cream, and we’d spend fun times in Lucy, his car (not doing THAT green minded folks!) but just talking, driving around, and dancing to his wonderful music. You need info on music or movies, ask this guy. He also taught me sports because he’s a great coach. This guy has my back for life. I miss him and the times we’d just joke and laugh and laugh and laugh. I’ve known him for about 9 years now but I really can’t remember my life before he came along. To me, I wouldn’t be complete if he wasn’t a part of my life. I love this guy and he’s a million times better than Reynaldo (picture below on last blog).  The other guy is my policeman friend. He spends most of my day with me. Yes, he’s my online buddy while I’m at work. But he’s more than that. This guy has brought sunshine and smiles my way when I kinda forgot what those things were. He makes me blush like crazy and keeps me laughing too. He’s even teaching me police codes now. Lol. I can’t wait to meet him when he comes here. I feel like … sigh…I can fall…But we won’t let it get there…yet.. So, this guy is 6’2” blonde and blue-eyed and claims he’s very attractive but I bet he’s right. Packed in all the right places too. So how often do you meet a man who is intelligent, handsome, serves and protects others for a living, makes me show dimples ALL the time, and lives thousands of miles away but willing to come here for me? Even Reynaldo, my dream hunk can’t come that close. Sigh…I bet my police friend is 7 too. Hahaha. Sssshhhhh…  So folks, meet two of the important men in my life. They’re no Armani model but they’re better…(picture to follow if they allow me to post it; so for now use your imagination) wink* wink*

       Side note:  First of all, sorry for my blog yesterday. It was just getting too much here at work and at home. It’s just one of those days I guess when nothing seems to be going right and the world I’ve carefully built is crashing down. A friend, reggae princess, has read my post and suggested that I hold on to … something instead. First thing that most people would think she was talking about is maybe holding on to faith. Yet, for me, to be honest, I thought of my perfect man, my unknown savior. Therefore, with this entry, I write the description of him in hopes that he’s out there and someone with access to this webpage can tell him for me I’m looking for him. =) (Yes, that includes you, My policeman friend.)  First of all, he needs to make me laugh. We’d be sitting somewhere together and just talking but at the end of the day, all I’d remember is us laughing, rather than the content of our conversation. I’d just like to be a kid with him, I guess.  We can joke around and play and just have not a care in the world but rather, have fun and enjoy life. He needs to have something between his ears so that he can make me think and learn and we can talk in the first place. He needs to have a strong belief in something—not the ultra religious fanatic, but someone who knows the meaning of faith. He should have dreams that he’s passionate in achieving but understands that hard work is the answer. He needs to have an idea what success is, how to value money, and why respect is important. He would want to make a difference in this world.  He needs to be tough, not in the macho manly sense but the kind who can carry the yolk and meet challenges head on. He needs to be a warrior who doesn’t give up easily when the downhill part of life hits him most.  How else can he can make my demons stay away and carry me when I’m too weak? Yet, he needs to need me too. There must be something in him that’s incomplete enough for me to fill the void, because I will need him to make me whole also.  He needs to be able to stare at me and make me feel like I’m so vulnerable because he lays me bare.  His eyes can penetrate into my skin and that way I can see his soul. His smile can transform from naughty to cute (dimples wouldn’t hurt) and his lips, oh my…enough said. His arms are strong to protect me and large enough to wrap me in. Last, he’ll have to have a 7 or bigger. =) I’m just playing. Just wanted to see your reactions my dear blog fans.  But it does seem like this post is headed in that direction so I’ll stop for now.   So folks, if you someone resembling Reynaldo (picture below), let me know. This guy is an Armani model, a lawyer, tall, brown and handsome, and …enough said… =)

      Faintness of laughter Echo in the dark Too far to reach The silence is loud with it. Strip me blind Take my soul Hide me in a tear Let it flow away in a tide. Too weary to fight The circle of it all The end is the start. Sit alone and stammer  Make promises of change Hold them toghether While you're undone. Oh, to drown in the night Is my salvation prison Cruelty seeps through Thickened walls of deception Wash the paint Hold your head high Bear it while you bare it... -------------------------- Just a random 3 minute rambling for the day--  I'm ready to just close my eyes and let it flood over. I'm so tired of faking the fatige. Where is the salvation that I hide in tears? I don't know how long my soul can hold out. There are too many forces I can't control.   Yet, you are told to have faith, stay strong and hope. I say, HOW?  How long can I cry wolf to myself and still believe? How long can you fight an unseen foe staring at you? How many smiles, seconds, and sentiments can I give away until I have none left for me?  Stripped down to nothing.  I want to stay invisible. Remain numb to it all.   So for all of you fermenting my open wounds, I lay it out open for you to just take. I bare my soul.

      Thank goodness it's the end of the week. I don't think I could've made it through another day. It's been crazy and frankly, I'm so tired I can collapse.  Before I continue, I want to apologize to those that read this blog. I shouldn't have exposed innermost thoughts about my family like that. So, from now on, only ramblings and venting out of frustrations. =P Lucky you right?   Work is really getting to me. The challenges are endless. Of course I'd rather be busy than bored. But I just don't think it's that fair. I have to be a one man department again. There's four of us in Operations and the supervisor just had surgery, one agent is recuperating from a near heart attack, and one claims to have a fever after getting rained on earlier. Now, I have to do all the lead generation research, emails, calls, and reports by myself.   I know, I'm such a big baby. I need to take it like a man, or a woMAN. I can't wait to just rest this weekend, which won't really happen. After work, I go straight to Makati, get a gift, go to my godson's first birthday party in Sucat, then rush to Novaliches for parent's church concert. Then the next day, it's off to church and to celebrate mom's birthday. That should be fun since we'll be as complete as we can be on Sunday. Then, off to work again on Monday. What a life...  So, with that, my blog fans, I leave you with a song that really helps me out when things get to be so bad and I need a little...lift. I learned it from church group, J.A.C. when I was 13. It's called "Lift Up Your Hands To God." Garry V did a remake so most of you know it. (Please don't think I'm a dork for pasting it on here...u never know who might need to read it right? hehe)  Life is not that all that bad, my friend If you believe in yourself If you believe there's someone Who walks through life with you You'll never be alone Just learn to reach out And open your arms Lift up your hands to God And He'll make you feel alright.  And He said, Cast your burdens upon Me Those who are heavily laden Come to me all of you who are tired Of carrying heavy loads For the yolk I will give you is easy And the burden is light Come to me and I will give you rest.  When you feel the world is tumbling down On you. And you have no one  That you can hold on to Oh yes you do. Just face the rising sun And you will see hope And there's no need to run Lift up your hands to God And he'll show you the way.

      When I got home, I found mom home again and her illness is back. I'm so worried about her. I love my mom. I'd be so lost if anything happened to her. That's why before, I would take her to the accupuncturist 2 hours away and sacrifice my sleep so I can just sit at the lobby and wait for her and make sure she got to and from home ok. I would do anything for my mom and it's her birthday this Sunday! I wish I can give her the world and more...  Actually, what I really wish I can give her is to have the family together again. Che is in Cali, two sisters in Baguio, and Ryan forever missing in action. My mom's heart got broken by Ry who never comes home, asks about her, and only calls when he needs money. It's like he only cares about his ugly as girl and his job/making money. Anyway, I had to swallow all that opinion up today. I saw his Friendster bulletin and I started crying. I had to reach him somehow cuz it sounded too much like a suicide note. I found him online and with the web cam we talked. Now he will go home and suprise mom this Saturday. I can't wait. Maybe my life will be just a little more complete now. Family and faith. My foundation.  This is what I wrote Ryan from my journal "Conversations with God" and he asked me to paste it on his testimonial in Friendster: "We were all forced to be an adult too soon. Ryan had to be the man in the boy. It looked contained yet I saw the struggle. I felt it myself. The pain of a new start made you want to stay in death. The little glimmer of gold and you took it. Of course I don't blame you. We were forced to hold the child in while we were stripped naked when they took it all away. Six years of nakedness and you took the first chance of cover. Yet, I'm sad. It's all cover and there is no Ryan. Easy answers will give you more questions my young brother. I wish you'd come home. We can be your cover. You don't have to hide from us even if we're hiding oursleves. Always, unspoken words assumed known will drift us. Yet, we have to stay silent and fight the battles alone. I sit witness to events that break me yet I can't do anything. It's the cover that's why. God, please help my family. I  can pretend all my life and all mylife live always wishing. I have to stay in God. I'm ready to come undone in all places. Hold us together and make my family whole. You're the only one who knows God. Please help my family...Ry, I'm sorry. I dont know what to do or what I can do but just know, just remember...we're family.

      For the last few days, it has been storming here in the Philippines. The weather has gone from extreme humidity and heat (where I'd only get a couple hours of sleep because it's too hot), to the storms now--flood, hard rain, and thunder (and I'm oversleeping and almost late to work everyday). It has been like my life. One moment, it is so boring and I have all the time in the world and now, I have no idea how I will do everything I want and need to do. Sometimes, I really wish I can stop time so I can do it all. I wouldn't be surprised if tomorrow, I just shut the door to my room and not come out even to go to work. I'd just be in there going crazy.  I went to work Monday with four out of five on board and by the end of the day, one was sent home (the one sent to ER last Friday) and the supervisor had to go to the hospital for a different emergency. He just went to surgery today, by the way. I had to be OIC again and I was so bored the last couple of days that I decided to go to chat yesterday. I met some weird people: from a Palestinian medical worker, to a NY cop who talks to the feds, an Egyptian financer, an American investor seeking my help for nurses or care givers who want to migrate to Michigan, a couple of Nigerians, and the usual perverts there. I've argued about war and current events and I've given my asl's and practically my resume to so many people.   Then this morning, I had to meet with the board members and the managers. I am only an agent but I had to represent the Operations department as OIC. We're going to do some business development and I gave my two cents in there. I got free breakfast as a reward and more work as I now have to research for business ventures. Then, JP and I went to the mall and he treated me to STRAWBERRY TEASER at Ice Monster. I told him about that darn thing Im addicted to so I got another free food. Gosh, I can't wait to move up the corporate ladder because of its perks! hahaha. But then again, all hell would break loose with my fellow CCA's, you know, the haters of dreamers.  Back to the weather...It's raining men! I heard from my childhood sweetheart who I still love with all my heart and I still feel his love. Then there's the last guy I talked to who finally has time for me. And my online buddies. And the guy from Xaymaca. And Eric. Then there's ... hahaha. Dang, I wish they were all in the Philippines! Ok, enough of this. I better get back to work...

      Enough of the venting out of stored emotions. Today, I came to promote. =) There is nothing like a stress reliever than good old...umm yeah, u know what that is. But if you're in a dry spell, second best is to unwind with music. Last day of work was crazy. I was left alone at the office because they had to rush an agent to the ER and there was only 4 of us that day. I was put as OIC by the supervisor so I couldn't be the one to go to the hospital. Don't ask me why it takes two people to bring someone to the hospital. Anyway, I had to man all the phones and write the reports by myself. Then my crazy relatives are textin and sending emails and calling cuz I have to act as liaison for aunt in Australia. My mom is having issues with my only brother. And to top it off, I reconnect lost ties with an old dear friend who has left my life for good some years back. He was my childhood sweetheart and soul mate. I was supposed to see old friends and have dinner and then go clubbing but even that was cancelled last freakin minute! I had no sleep whatsoever. It was just crazy. I had my nerves all up from worry, stress, anxiety, sadness, love, hurt, happiness, excitement, to dejection. Then last minute, my buddy Nina goes and saves me with an invitation to join her and Pie to listen to a rock band. Me? and Rock music? That don't jive too well, but you never know. I wanted to listen to something loud to drown it all out; to just sink in music and let it carry me to rest. I was saying I wouldn't go though. Just stay home AGAIN and just chill up in bed. Then, I decided to go. I didn't want to sulk or anything again for the weekend. We went to Freedom Bar. There were so many bands. I sure didnt fit in with my big pink hoop earrings and pink halter, low waist jeans with pink belt with rhinestones and heels. But oh well. After a beer and a couple of bands, we got out of there. Pie got her fix from the music and we were ready to dance the night away. We went to a raggae heaven called Xaymaca. It was hella fun. We ate, drank, and danced all night long. We just laughed and laughed and looked like 3 girls high on jutes. hahaha. Got the sax player eyeing us and some dreds-wearin guy ask for my name. Even a weirdo tried to dance too close all night and chased me down the block to ask for my number. It was funny cuz it was Nina who got so...happy that she infected us with acting like drunks. hahaha. We couldn't find a place to get coffee except at this sizzling plate place with rundown instant coffee and a cheesecake that kinda resembled...mold. or a block of cheese, no cake. We went to Pie's house and Nina crashed in bed and Pie and I boldly said we'll watch Kill Bill vol2 and stay up. We didn't last long. Maybe its cuz it was Terentino. Woke up to hotdogs and rice and off to home I go to shower...and hop on a jeep to church. After, I just rushed home and my bed swallowed me up until 5 am the next day. Overall, it was great. I can't wait to have an adventure again!

      With the first post I made on this blog, I copied and pasted a forwarded message from an email saying you will always meet people who will not like you simply because you are you. Yet, you are tasked to love them anyway, and continue being who you are supposed to be--YOURSELF.  I was taught by my parents at an early age that each person has a destiny, a purpose in life that they must achieve before they can rejoin God. Therefore, one must set high goals for only in big dreams can one accomplish great things.  I was taught to do good and serve others.   We are always taught good at an early age to help us when we're older. Yet, it gets tough to do the right things when the temptations come at a later age.   Nevertheless, I try to carry the words of my dad with me; He said I can move mountains if I really wanted to. I guess that's why I maybe take on too much, often more than I can handle. Still, I do my business.   The only bad thing is someone somewhere always end up hating me for some reason when I achieve some of those goals I set for myself. I don't think they're jealous though. What would be the point of that when they can do the same thing? You should only be jealous when someone else's grass is greener than yours and ONLY when you cannot make your own grass just as green. Ok, you should NEVER be jealous. But let's get real folks; we do get envious but all I'm saying is there might not be a reason for it since you can do the same. If you just focus on yourself and let go of being too attached to analyzing others, you are capable of great things.  I get really hurt when people tease me about getting good grades and still having time to have a social life. They are so shocked at how I do it, and frankly it annoys me. I want to ask them why they care so much. They talk behind my back or make side comments that make me feel really uncomfortable. Here at work it's the same thing. There are only three of us agents. Yet, the other two think I am their rival more than a coworker sometimes. At least that's what they make me feel. They say things like "I'm sure you'll be promoted first" and "it's really a competition against my coworkers."     During a team building exercise, I got real emotional. I told them that I set high goals and if I compete with anyone, it's against myself and the expectations I set for myself. I don't care for awards. If they want them, I'll give it gladly without a second thought.  Afterall, achievements are only output equal to my input. If I put in so much effort, I expect to be rewarded for it but not in any way external to myself. Does that make sense?   I guess what I'm trying to say is, don't hate the dreamer--become a dreamer yourself. Then, the rewards will follow.

      What's up with the people who love soap operas? Simply that they have no lives of their own and they enjoy drama for some reason.   Of course, it's not right for me to say that it seems like most women I know here in Philippines are like that. The truth is, there's this kind of people everywhere. Yet, for some reason, they ABOUND here.   I have relatives who intrude in our lives, for one thing. They try to look through peekholes to attempt to catch infinitesimal details of error. Nevertheless, when they don't find any, they make it up and it spreads like a virus with no cure. Then, there are those who are your so-called friends who constantly give you unsolicited advice. If you show in anyway that you have any negative reaction to it, they tell you that you are only mad because the truth hurts. For some reason, you notice that these same people hang around you more when you're down than happy and constantly ask you how you're holding up.  Sure, they APPEAR to be real friends, but you learn in the end that they are merely GATHERING juicy information. The truth, basically, is that they are absolutely tickled by the fact that you are having problems--especially if its a guy issue or there's an intrigue with another friend.   They are the kind who will put more wood into your burning house. Folks, be wary of their kind.  My friend Ann though, she's an exception to this since she's a real friend. She said those kinds of people are either: 1) cannot live without a man and expects you to be the same way; or 2) they are the type who force their beliefs on other people.  Either way, in my opinion, that's wrong.   When I say I'm single and happy, it doesn't mean I'm lying through my teeth and covering up my real feelings for the sake of appearing to be strong. When I say I know I'm worth more than a mistress material or just a number two of a man with a girlfriend, it's not because Im being defensive. It's the truth. No, I don't enjoy running after men with someone already in their lives because I like the thrill of danger. NEVER should you state nor even come close to implying you know me better than I know myself. If for some reason that is how you see yourself, then don't make it as if the same is the truth about me.   If you are my friend, act like it. Be real. Talk to me straight but don't assume. Sure, no one likes to hear bad things but add tact and propriety at times when you can.  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ SIDE COMMENT ABOUT SOMEONE ELSE: When you are having those days when you seek constant attention (or you're the type who NEEDS attention all the time like someone I know), please don't go to me. I have enough of my own stuff to take care of and not to be selfish, but I need to put me as number one and not instead, listen to your narcissistic tendensies to babble on about yourself. As a saying here in Philippines goes: "eto ang piso, bumili ka ng kausap mo."

      "Just When I Thought I Was Over You"...Don't you just hate that song?!   I take so long to get myself up to par with the ME I should be, and what happens? The make-up peels right off and I learn that it's all been a facade all along. How can one stop pretending then if one does not know they're not real in the first place?  Bittersweet--that is the only taste there is in my life lately. It was anxiety: fear and excitement all at once. I was looking forward to seeing him again, and this time I am hooking up with his mom and brother while meeting the cousins.   Do I stay quiet and smile often? Do I blabber nonstop and try to appear busy and full of life? I couldn't even sleep because I kept replaying the scenario in my mind!!..that, and the fact that someone was practicing with the drums next door (the negative side of having to sleep during the day and working graveyard).  In short, I slept 2 hours. I tried to take my mind off it by watching some good old tv. Nothing does it like Lifestyle channel and the fashion and interior design shows. =) After a long time of getting ready, I had to face reality.  Turns out, it was so fun. We watched tv and laughed and talked and ate and walked around at the mall and ate again and laughed some more. I can't remember not being so shy around his brother and mom that I'd be the one asking the questions this time. To top it off, there was no awkward moment that seemed to plague my EVERY moment with him for so long before. Does that mean it is really over and we are finally JUST friends? I hope so. Wait, no I don't. Quoting Rachel from  Friends , "between me and you, it's never off the table." Even if our story will never come true, he will always be the prince charming in my fairy tale. (sigh) ------------------------------- I can't wait to have babies! There is no greater reward in my life right now than to go to the orphanage and come home tired knowing I gave some loving. Actually, that's wrong; I was the one who got all the love.   These kids are miracles. Maybe one day I can have a miracle of my own... -------------------------------- I'm so worried about my dog. He has internal bleeding and the house was so gory when I came home and left the house today. That dog is what brought my dad...home. He's my parents' BABY! The house would never be a home without that dog. Hero is the one family member I see most too. So please pray for him to get better. =)

          People are unreasonable, illogical and self-centered.     Love them anyway.      If you do good, people will accuse you of selfish, ulterior     motives.     Do good anyway.      If you are successful, you will win false friends and true     enemies.     Succeed anyway.      The good you do today will be forgotten tomorrow.     Do good anyway.      Honesty and frankness make you vulnerable.     Be honest and frank anyway.      The biggest people with the biggest ideas can be shot down     by the smallest people with the smallest minds.     Think big anyway.      People favor underdogs but follow only top dogs.     Fight for the underdog anyway.      What you spend years building may be destroyed overnight.     Build anyway.      People really need help, but may attack you if you help them.     Help people anyway.      Give the world the best you've got and you'll get kicked in     the teeth.     Give the world the best you've got anyway.      Lord, I purpose today not to listen to my detractors or look to     the left or the right, but to stay on the clear, sure path You     have set before me.

      Yes, we all know that song and some might find it really corny. But it really serves as an inspirational thing to help us keep hope that things will be better soon; we just have to stay strong, wait it out, and one day, we'll see that God indeed had a purpose as to why we were put up with the challenges.  When bad things happen, most people blame God and others but forget to look at themselves to find where they could have improved the situation. Those that do look within take all the blame and end up hating themselves.  Yet, the superior man will see that this is just a test. He will continue to strive to be a better person, keep their chin up, and charge this to experience to thicken their skin for the next trials to come.  Sure, it is all easier said than done. Yet, we must still keep trying though it is tiring.  That is why also, we should always remember to look at the blessings we have. The grass might be greener on the other side. But upon close inspection, we would not want to change our lives for another's. Part of these blessings are those who offer their hands and walk with us along life's roads. They hold us when we're sad, offer hands to pull us up when we stumble, wipe our tears, pat our back, clap when we need it...So, thank you for all those who did this for me. YOU KNOW WHO YOU ARE.(yes, that includes you, JP and Pij, for giving me some choco chiffon slice from Goldilocks. Nothing does it like chocolate as comfort food!)

      Why do storms come when you least expect them to? I guess that question is more than literal. It's ok though. "Dust off the shoulders"--that's what I tell myself all the time. Yes, I talk to myself. I have to constantly remind myself to follow my motto in life, CARPE DIEM. Well, it's good to do that when you forget that sometimes, you have to conscientiously breathe, not just making breathing a natural bodily phenomena of the appetitive soul. (Yes, I'm in a philosophical mood.)Well, my soul does have an appetite, among other parts of me. Nope, don't start having green thoughts because that's not really what I'm referring to.   Anyway, today was a very busy day. I actually got more than one call from a customer and I had to do more than one training today. SIGH...Well, when there is something lacking in your life, always remember, it is better to be busy than to be bored. It doesn't give you time to dwell on that one thing missing in your life...  I guess that means I should try to go to the library. LOL. Enough about school too. Anyway, here guys--do this quiz if you're bored to find out what kind of soul you have:     Your soul is STEADFAST. You are a fiercely loyal person who would never cross a loved one. People always know they can rely on you and your dependability is well-known. You're probably a little on the quiet side, but your faithfulness is never doubted, and you always back up your kith and kin whether they want or need it or not. You are a dependable and trusted soul.     urlLink   What Is Your Soul's Trait?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla

      Dinner with Mel I left off last Tuesday and so much has happened since then. Last Wednesday, I finally said I'd go to dinner with an old coworker who's been bugging me since February. Before anything else, this guy is married and has kids. Though he is tall, handsome, and athletic, he is really just a friend because all the people in the Museum are like second family to me. So...we meet up and Im 30 mins late. He hands me a big bar of my fave chocolate--Cadbury Fruit & Nut. Then, turns out he's gotta new car. We drive around until he brings me to his favorite Chinese restaurant. Lots of moments were awkward but we managed to make conversation. Then, it was too early for me to go to work so he took me for a couple of drinks while watching this live R&B band. He got to close at some points and was making the very obvious moves of putting his arm around me and holding my hand and i was literally shaking my leg. He even commented on it. When he dropped me off, he wanted breakfast after my work. I said thanks and gave a half arm pat/hug and a cheek to cheek traditional Filipino style of saying bye/hi, and he held me in both his arms and I raced to the office. Then he sends text messages saying he can't forget the hug and he wants to do MORE with me. To make a long story short, I text him back that he's married and I dont play that game.  MY REACTION: Do I look like a mistress type or I am so lonely that I'd fall for a married man? It makes me mad but also VERY sad since he was a friend, but I guess he never really saw me as one...  Hospital or Class, which is worse? I was real sick Thursday and was hospitalized. They thought it was dengue fever but after doing the tourniquet test and getting my blood sample TWICE, they decided it's not that bad. Then I went to class still because that teacher is scary. She's the dean and teacher of Islamic Political Thought. You can't be late nor unprepared and her class is SO hard. I was the first oral reporter on Al Farabi so I insisted I go class even if I had no voice. I delivered the report and it turned into a heated political arguement all because of one of my classmates. He is such a pompous ass who thinks he's so perfect and the most intelligent person in the universe. In the end, I showed him! Hmph! But it cost me more of my voice. :(   Dancing with Vince Friday I was still sick but I took a leave long time ago so I can see my high school friend Vince. He was my officer for student govt when I was president and he was my candidate when I was director of a church youth group. Anyway, we're not that smart/holy/service oriented as you'd think. He drinks like a fish too. I went with him and his brother to the bar then the club. I introduced him to my DJ friend, Ace and maybe convinced him enough that he should live in Philippines since I can hook him up with a DJ/singing career/or even call center agent job. We ended up starting the dancing and I even heard one guy tell his friend that I look so drunk. Hey, I'm just high off the music. Ace can spin!Anyway, after some beers and long island ice teas, we went to their hotel and talked til 6am with his brother too. He gave me a couple CD's of his mixes and the recorded songs he made. It's always good to see old friends...  Saturday with Will The highlight of my day is getting his phone call and getting to talk to him for a couple of hours. I'm sure he wouldn't think it was such a highlight when he sees the bill but yeah. *blush*--that's my reaction to this guy. He's so good to me. Enough said. I don't want to get overly sentimental on this blog post. That stuff will have to be written on another diary. LOL.  Chillin on Sunday It was the blessing of the new building my godmother/aunt put up. It's 4 floors and it cost them about 20million pesos to build up. I swear my godparents are rich. Anyway, it was fun to see my little cousins again and go back to the old neighborhood since the area is a block from my old apartment near the old university. They did the whisking of the holy water thing, the throwing of coins and candy, and the catered food from Barrio Fiesta. I was so full it was hard to stand!  What a Weird Monday I could never sleep because of this cough but I left the house early to get to a class where the teacher didn't show up AGAIN. Then, while waiting to get ready for dinner for my brother's 22nd birthday with parents, I find out my cousin died. So, one loses a life and another gains another year of it. This cousin is only 34 years old. She had such a sad life. Her parents ran off at an early age to elope and have 7 kids, of which she's the youngest. My grandma took care of her until one day, my aunt wanted her daughter. They lived in shanties and my aunt never got married with the man who used, abused, and abandoned them. My cousin turned crazy--she sees dead people, dwarfs, u name it. I was even her favorite when we were kids cuz she's always play with my hair like I was her doll, and so yes, she said the dwarf prince liked me. Anyway, she was harmless. Yet, we were in Cali and when we came back here we found that she was raped by my aunt's lover who bore her a child (who calls my cousin older sister instead of mom). My aunt would tie up my cousin and use tranquilizers on her since she said they couldn't afford medicine. To me, she was neglected. She died swimmin in her piss and crap and I saw her corpse and it looked like she died a week ago not yesterday. She is all bones and skin...I hate injustice in the world. To me, parents have the responsibility over their children. We never asked to be born nor do we want to be a burden but ... I don't know. Im just grateful I have great parents and siblings. I went to Ryan's birthday dinner in Chinatown Manila and it was good. I just feel so happy to have him in my life. The food wasn't even the thing that got me satisfied/full, but more of the company of my parents and brother.   I know I am a sinner but...God still continues to bless me with so much love...

      It's always good to see old friends again. I know folks of different strokes I guess and it's been awhile since I've seen some of them. This week, the schedule is full. I will get to meet my old coworker from UST Museum, Mel tomorrow and on Friday, an old classmate in High School, Vince.  Tonight I was able to meet Joey for dinner. Her real name is Joanna Maria Paula. Yeah, such a long first name! Anyway, let me tell you bout this girl...     She's my bestfriend throughout college and was my partner for all the reports in class and for our thesis on the Human Dimension Beneath The Arab-Israeli Conflict. Yeah, we got best thesis award too. We always sit in front of the class and I guess she's the biggest competition when it comes to grades. Lol. I know, some of you didn't know Im such a nerd. Well, I'm not. Not really. Anyway, Joey is one of the few I share ME with. I can talk to her about important things in my life like family and career.    She's also the most idealistic person I know. Right now, she works for an NGO and her most recent adventure is creating a curriculum for teachers and organizing a library left by Mr. Kalaw, a world known environmentalist.  Yeah, she's gotta great heart and really wants to save the world. She's the most idealistic person I know. She's real smart and pretty too.  She's the only one I can really talk to about my dreams and share my love for this country with. She's the kind who'd get teary-eyed when she watches documentaries on poverty in Philippines, the kind who'd never hesitate to give loose change to or buy food for street children, and the kind who'd be the first to volunteer for a community development project.  In this crazy world we live in, Im glad that there are still people out there who refuse to just be numb to it all and do nothing. She is one of the few I know who really wants to make a difference--to live life in service to God and country. Those kind of people only exist in history books, I thought. I give so much respect for anyone who can see hope in this country, and continue to strive to go against the wave of indifference and corruption.  It is always good to know that there is still those who will promote the ideals of justice, truth, and above all else, Love.

      Excuse me while I take out my frustrations on this blog.  I woke up today before 6am only to go to class and wait 3 hours for a teacher that never shows up. I got rained on and had to spend hella money on transportation and food cuz none at home again. Im so sick but supervisor is home sick so gotta work.  Im in charge again but that's not a big deal. If only we didn't have issues here at work with an agent. I don't know where to begin with schoolwork. I have homework, research, term paper proposals, Arabic alphabet and writing rules to memorize, and an oral report this week on Al Farabi. I took home 6 books today from the library and I still have to call Congress to set up interview appointments for my research on Muslim Women in Philippine Politics. Why did I take 12 units again when full load for masters degree in Univ. of Philippines is 9 units? Im the only one taking that much load and still working 9 hours a day 5 days a week at night...I JUST WANT TO SCREAM!  Ok, now that that is off my chest, let me tell you about my fun Saturday night. Though everyone flaked out on me last second about going out, I can always count on Nina and Pie to party with me. They're all the company I need anyway to make me smile all the time. But I got a bonus this weekend because Ann was there! For those who dont know her, she's my old coworker but more like one of my closest friends. I even call her Sis. Here's our pic from last year.  She has gotten even sexier now but Im still the usual pudgy me.    Though the fete de la musique wasn't all that...I had fun. The place was crowded, it was raining hard, and I was getting dizzy from all the walking and all the people. It felt like EDSA revolution! The only one we were able to listen to was the jazz part. It was all drum beats Filipino traditional style. It was nice but we didn't get a dose of raggae/ska as planned. About 3am, Ann and I decided to go ahead to Club Chill only to find out from the owner that they closed for the weekend. We ended up in Club V (Five) in Makati. It was SO FUN! I was even the last one dancing on the floor by 5am. My friend Ace was the DJ and I was able to see Gino, the guy who used to "court" me. He's half black and Filipino and he's cute, athletic, very gentlemanly (he wanted to take me and Ann home and we lived in opposite poles of the country--both in provinces already). But of course we declined. He's a great guy...but...Anyway, I made Ann dance with him. At least he watched over us two girls. There were some folks who ended up fighting in the club. I usually dance by myself but this one latin dude (yeah, didn't know they existed in Philippines) just came up and I danced round him and left abruptly. (I know, Im so mean.) Then this other black guy (lookin like 50 cent) tried to dance with me. He was grabbin though and I couldn't have that. I had fun dancing alone (pretending Chill was in front of me) and with Ann and Gino. Then, Ann and I went to this 24 hour restaurant and I ate alone and just talked for HOURS until I had to get coffee from Mc Donald's.   Too bad Saturday had to end. I got home and wanted to hang with parents for father's day but they told me to sleep and go mass instead at 5pm. I slept 2 hours and they weren't home. I went mass and after, they left me at home while they celebrated at the neighbor's who is part of their church group. Sigh...I miss my family.  I miss Chill too. Dang, I think Im sprung. But nah, we won't let it get there yet. But I have a feeling that's too late. I swear, everywhere I go, I see his face or every other second I'm thinking of him. I really want to find an exception to my rule of having walls up around my heart. But yeah...we'll see where that leads.  Enough rambling for the day...

      Mi papa es mi ídolo. Le amo muchisimo pero no le muestro. Que lastima...  I don't even know if I wrote that right. Anyway, I was once daddy's girl. I mean, I am the eldest so I think I was his favorite when I was the only one existing. He'd spoil me as a child with material things and I remember even the first day of school. I only wanted my dad to bring me and I begged him to stay with me the whole day. He promised to just be right outside the door. I'd look back often to make sure he was still there. Then, when I knew he left, I didn't cry. I was pissed. After school, he came back and I got mad at him and told him he broke his promise to me. He said he was just there the whole time; I just didn't see. Then, he put me on his shoulders, and I forgot all about being mad at him.  That's as a child. Then, growing up, dad was never around. He was always working, or asleep. He worked 2 jobs while we lived in Daly City, both full time you see. Yet, he'd make sure we always ate together for dinner. We'd talk about how the day went and we'd share jokes. Dad would be the one initiating those moments too. Then, he'd tell stories. Mind you, I was already a teenager by then. He'd tell us stories and we wouldnt know if it was a joke or there was a moral lesson to it so we always paid attention. Dad would ask us, what did you learn from that story? My father, though he hardly had time, always made sure he raised us with values, always appreciating life, love, family, and education. He'd always plan trips for us. He would take us on tours to Muir Woods, to Reno, wherever. Those were the best moments of my teenage life.  Now, dad is retired and getting old. He sometimes can't hear as well or forgets things easily. Yet, he's still the same. He still says the jokes, and the moral stories. He still enjoys life and tries to live a life of virtue. He is a prominent member of the community--in the political arena with the baranggay and in the church. He volunteers for Caritas as prison justice and development speaker, and studies to be a paralegal to help defend them. He gives talks for the Parish Renewal Experience. He helps out the baranggay captain and attends the subdivision meetings. His bestfriend and idol is our parish priest.   Don't think my dad is a wuss either. He once went to jail for beating this group of men and sending them to near death. He went in his brothers' defense when a group of guys ganged up on them at the basketball court. My mom's family never wanter her to marry him.   He grew up as the eldest of 9 children--6 from the original family and 3 from the father's second wife. His parents eloped when they were teenagers and left the children to fend for themselves and both his parents remarried. He grew up selling sweepstakes tickets and doing classmates' homeworks to make some money for food and so he can go to school. Dad worked hard. He was later on able to work in Saudi Arabia and later became a travel consultant to Pan Am airlines. He was a tour guide in San Francisco and even met the 49ers (when they were still the best).  Dad has always lived a life trying to be a good person. Though he had the lowest in his life when we were back here in the Philippines when my mom threw him out and he fist-fought with my brother, he changed his life around because deep down inside he is a good man. He does me proud. I wish one day, I can be like him and make him proud also. Last, I just hope the man I marry can live up to MY standards of what a man should be--all patterned after my father.  Happy Father's Day...

      My mama told me before that in life, you will either stand against the wave and die or become a part of it. It used to make me mad that there are certain things we can't change about the world we live in. But, I refuse to do nothing, and rather, attempt to at least make a dent. But this thought has been difficult to retain when the waters come in big waves and the storms hit your life. Or, during the times when you look around and take time to smell the garbage, as I'd like to call it.   I'm no child anymore I guess but there are still many times I wish I was so there can be no worries and no responsibilities. Lately, things were crazy within my world--I worry about family, work and the people in it, school stuff, friends' individual problems, and I guess even in the love life scenario.  If I count all the tears that POURED out of me, I think I'd have an ocean full of tsunamis.   Yet, God makes sure that though He challenges us, we'd always have a period of calmness. This is one of those moments. Finally, I can exhale again after holding my breathe for a while. Though things are not running perfectly (since it will never be PERFECT), things are great.   I got through to my brother who I found wasn't on drugs or drowning in alcohol but just mending his wounds. Mama is ok and going through her accupuncture sessions and making ends meet ok. Dad was so happy with his early father's day present. (Book lovers, try reading Angelo De Mello; it might change your life) Sisters are ok and might just convince the youngest to come live with us here in Philippines. We're on our way to being complete. School is great though challenging. Workload has greatly decreased and I now have time to blog and do my reports and readings. I got flowers and we shared roasted chicken today since I'll have a higer role to do now for the team. I'm getting friends together who are down and out (theme song: "two less lonely people in the world...") Even Joy will live with  me soon...Last, *sigh...Chill and I are ok. =)  What I learned lately and who taught them to me:  1. People come in different levels. You need to adjust and compromise so you can meet halfway.(darn jeepney drivers who charge different fares now with the diesel price hike)  2. There are those who won't budge and think they are forever correct. Leave them be. Those who see no need for improvement in themselves cannot be made to see otherwise anyway. (a coworker)  3. Learn to trust BUT learn not to be gullible. There is a thin line between them. (friends)  4. Practice propriety. It's all about doing the RIGHT thing at the RIGHT time. (family)  5. Sometimes, take the risk. You never know if you'll come out a winner. (Chill)  6. Take in the good and learn from the bad experiences. (close friends esp. those w/  blogs)  7. Believe in yourself. Know you are capable of great things, even in adverse moments. (life)

      I was blog hopping and thanks to Pie, I found out I was a b*tch. lol. Just playing. Here's my result...  Milliza, you're a Cocker Spaniel!  No bones about it, you're a perky, loving Cocker Spaniel. (Think Lady from Lady and the Tramp.) Playful and energetic, you're a real people person — er, dog. People can't help but fall hook, line, and sinker for your friendly, well-rounded personality and natural charm. It's a subtle thing, though — being outgoing and flirtatious, not showy, is the name of your game. Friends, co-workers, and potential dates can't help liking you. How could they not? Your winning-yet-humble ways make you popular, admired, and a joy to be around. Woof!   urlLink What Breed of Dog Are You?

      Just when I have my back against the wall and still I try to run, God finds someone to try to reach me. Thank you Tony Tellez. This is what he wrote me on IM but signed in and out before I can answer:  When the true friendship joins with two persons, that union never can be broken.  Because in the moments of uncertainty,  there I will be to listen to you.   In the moments of sadness,  there I will be to console you.   In the moments of anger,  there I will be to calm you.  Although a great distance separate us, when youre confused, when youre sad, when youre angry,  seek in your heart and there I will be.  Our friendship is for today and for always.  ================================================== *God spoke to me. For that, I thank you...Here's a song right back at you...  Angel by Sarah McLachlan  Spend all your time waiting for that second chance for a break that would make it okay there's always one reason to feel not good enough and it's hard at the end of the day I need some distraction oh beautiful release memory seeps from my veins let me be empty and weightless and maybe I'll find some peace tonight  In the arms of an angel fly away from here from this dark cold hotel room and the endlessness that you fear you are pulled from the wreckage of your silent reverie you're in the arms of the angel may you find some comfort there  So tired of the straight line and everywhere you turn there's vultures and thieves at your back and the storm keeps on twisting you keep on building the lie that you make up for all that you lack it don't make no difference escaping one last time it's easier to believe in this sweet madness oh this glorious sadness that brings me to my knees  In the arms of an angel fly away from here from this dark cold hotel room and the endlessness that you fear you are pulled from the wreckage of your silent reverie you're in the arms of the angel may you find some comfort there you're in the arms of the angel may you find some comfort here

      Last Sunday, after mass, we ate lunch and then off to the mall we went to watch a movie together supposedly. Yet, there was no new good movies out.  (You can't get my parents to watch Filipino movies such as "Singles" with the near-X rated quality nor the mushy love story of "All My Life")  Dad decided to split with us as he'd rather buy some century egg (blackened egg that's a delicacy with the Chinese which really smells rotten)as something to eat while drinking with the priest(hold comments). He'd also rather go to the barbershop to get a massage (yes, not a haircut but a massage).  So, I took mom to my work at the Celebrity Sports Plaza (exclusive sports club) where we enjoyed the sauna, jacuzzi,long hot shower, then aromatherapy massage for an hour and a half. It was the first time for my mama to go to one of those. We had a ball just talking at the sauna, and laughing in the hot jacuzzi. (I even slipped on the jacuzzi and it was SO hot.)  It was fun really just having all the time to talk with her about anything and everything. The best stories she told were about her and my dad before they were married. I can't believe how mom defied her parents. She got married in the court without her family's knowledge. She got pregnant after marriage, then they had the church wedding. I was in her stomach when she got married in church.  We ate and shared a Black Widow dessert. It's cheesecake mixed with chocolate cake layer. It was SO good. It comes CLOSE to strawberry ice of Ice Monster.   The day was so fun. It felt like we were just sisters. I love my mom with all my heart. She's my bestfriend. The memory of that Sunday will forever be in my heart.  Cost of our day: PhP 1,700 Cost of my mother's smile: PRICELESS  There are things that money can't buy. For everything else there's mastercard!

      Long distance relationships NEVER work out...at least that's mine and Chill's belief. So even if we'll never get to be together in that sense, we're just going to enjoy the ride for as long as we can have it.   I guess I really like this guy. I have walls that are high and thick but this man--he even has guard dogs and a hi-tech alarm system! hahaha. But who knows how we started talking. He said I came through the back door. =) Seriously, we really didn't expect it coming.  Yet, you won't hear me complaining.  I know I told you about him and what he does but let me give you an update on why he gave me the "jones"... =)  He can laugh at life and at himself too. He kinda reminds me of the baby I want to adopt at the orphanage because their laugher is so...carefree. It's even contagious. I wish I can hear him laugh all the time. (wishful thinking)  He's so witty too. He gets me to eat my words sometimes and his come backs are amazing. I mean even if we don't talk about super serious things, I love the mental challenge he poses when he does the puns and play on words.  Chill's got style too. Of course I've never seen him in person so I don't mean his stance and the way he walks. Im not even sure of the way he dresses but from what I know, he's got the total package going. Boi got style, trust me.  Mostly, he has a good heart. I luv the way this kid takes care of folks. He gives donations and puts in for society--like how he pays one guy to clean his house so the guy doesn't resort to making money in the streets dealin or anything like that.  He's got a good head on him too. He has sense and street smarts. He grew up urban but he's got values too. I guess that's what kept him afloat. So much has happened to him in life but he's still swimmin when he could've drowned before.    Like I said before, I'm just plainly blessed to know him. This guy keeps me smiling, laughing, hoping, tingling...he gives me good CHILLs. lol. I can't wait for more each new day. It's like God has given me a reason to anticipate more on life. What a gift I've been given.  Thanks for showing me how to feel alive again, Pa.  *here's a picture of sexy sexy

      All this worrying will make me old or ugly. First of all, I have my hardest class tomorrow. I'm so scared of Dean Abubakar. I have Islamic Political Thought with her and this is the class that will make me bust my ass. But the real deal is that I'm so worried about my family.  Mom and I finally had time to sit down together and chat as usual, ok, not as usual but as we USED to do before church has taken over my parents' lives. Did I tell you yet that I'm so jealous of church? I mean it's cuz I don't see my parents anymore since they're always there. Anyway...If only I can bear all the hurt from my loved ones. I hate seeing them having so much problems.  My sisters are away for school. They're 8 hours away and I never see them. The older one is doing ok in school but she has to take the pressure of having to take care of the younger one. That younger one has a boyfriend who takes up all her time. I found out my sister doesn't even come home. Her grades are so bad and that's why she couldn't transfer to UP Diliman. They have major money issues since they need to budget but for some reason they always lose the atm card, break it, or forget the pin (like what happened today again) after mom just deposited money in it. Then, my only brother hasn't been home in who knows how long. He has major issues. I found out he borrowed 20,000 from my aunt asking her not to tell mom. I have no idea if he's doing drugs or what. I tried to talk to him today but he's so vague. He just said he didn't enrol AGAIN. See my brother has so much potentials. He was national debater who even went to England and Singapor to compete for Asia and world-wide. Now, he's...i dunno. I hate the girl who broke his heart. If i see her, Im going to...sigh..Then my youngest sister is in California with crazy aunt. I love my aunt but she even drives her only daughter insane that she moved out across America. I haven't seen or talked to this sister in so long. I wonder if she got a man now or into the bad crowd in school. Then dad has his problems. I worry about him because at his old age, I wish he had more to do. He's into forced retirement. I swear, I hate that he has to be like the maid--cooks, cleans, does the marketing. I wish we had more money so he can just chill at the province or something. Then mom, she worries me because she's sick and still can't afford not to go to work and slave away for my aunt. My mom works 6 days a week 9 hours or more a day and gets paid minimum wage. Those she helps out backstabs her (at work and church) and mom has to pay for it (sometimes literally).   I wish we were rich. Maybe that can solve a lot of the problems. I worry about my family so much. This is the reason I can't move out and do my own life stuff. I hate being an adult sometimes. Well, as I always say, "ganyan talaga ang buhay" (that's life)...

      Just because the storm is gone is no reason to believe it won't come back. Nevertheless, it's good to finally feel like you can exhale. It's been such crazy times lately. I thank God for opening my eyes though. I guess, it's another experience I can put in my back pocket...  First, I didn't realize how many read this blog stuff. Thanks for all the friends who were there. I did some blog hopping and I realize that I'm normal. I mean there are those who have it like me--painting faces, covering glass hearts, putting up walls they wish were invisible...what is this love business anyway?  There are those who long for lost loves but try to pretend they're ok; those who wish they can find new loves but frustrated with the games; those who feel love around them and are happy or blessed; those who wish they weren't plagued by love at all due to the malady of hurt.  I guess we just have to continue to not lose hope and aim at realizing that we are all not alone. Even if we are in the lowest of our lives, God always sends an angel to help us find our way back to Him.   Here's what I need to learn: Love can hurt and it can also cause happiness, but in the end, it's always worth all the pain. I must learn to open, not shut and lock. I have to give but not lose any part of me. I must learn the correct timing--when to let go, and when to hold on tighter. I need to know how to love myself and be content on being alone but never losing (1) HOPE that I'll find someone and (2) FAITH that God has a plan. I need to learn to take control, smile more often, take it in a moment at a time, and last, not settle for less than my worth.

      Took the risk and failed. Rejection all over again.  Go on. Keep running from the foe you cant shake. Just dont cry. Hold it. Hold the pieces in place. Though they lacerate your hands, Bear it. Dont crumble. Help it fade. Close your eyes to the tears Ready to burst. Dont let it pour. You'll get drowned. Havent you learned yet? Shut and lock. Dont open for anyone. Who cares if you'll never know? You do. But fight it. Hold it down with the strength you have left. Face forward young girl. Grow up. Be your own savior. No one else will come. No one.  Silence. That's the screams you'll hear Until my heartaches end.  Goodbye.

      I was so sleepy and tired that I didn't feel like hangin out last Saturday night. But I can't turn down a good friend. And Im so glad I went!!! It was like a reunion with some of the guys from Macromedia. I wish Meng can send the pictures so I can post some here. I hung out with my old coworkers at the raggae club and then Club Chill again. It was so fun! Yeah, the sax guy was there. But he was late and brought his girl too. So Nina and I have to find a new crush now...maybe the bassist. Hehe.  I wasn't feeling it that much at Xaymaca. Must've been all the second hand smoke in the air. But at Club Chill, it was a different story. Pie can tell u the same thing cuz we were dancing nonstop. Yeah, no real boys there but who cares? We don't go there for that (that's just icing to the cake). We promised to do it again real soon. I hope it happens since I have school now.   Then, I hung out with Kodjo to Mr. Kebabs again. I love that falafel, for those who dont know--its this wrap made of all vegies--them garbanzo beans. That and Hommus. sigh...Anyway, I like hanging with Kodjo (ex's brother). Im glad he and I have gotten to be closer friends even if Kweku and I aren't together. I got home at 6am after that.  Then off to sleep I went and woke up around 3pm. I got to talk to Chill and for an hour too! Dang it, that's gonna cost 2 days' paycheck but it was worth it. I love how this guy is so talkative like a girl. haha. For real, he really gets me laughing.   Then, I went to mass and off to hang with parents to watch Day After Tomorrow. My parents are good peeps, man. It was us 3 and this one girl who lives in the squatters area. Her name is Ann. My mom bought her school supplies and we ate pizza and watched the movie. I was teasin mom that she got an adopted daughter now. My parents are good people. Im real proud of them.  Then Monday and off to school I go. I wait around 2 hours before the teacher comes. But it was worth it. Rene, Rashid, and Hamid were there trying to mess with my head. Rashid really wants me to convert to Islam. Anyway, I got to learn how to write my name in Arabic today! Woo hoo.  Then, I went to the mall, watched Troy by myself. Yes, Im  not ashamed to go alone. I had my strawberry ice from Ice Monster and that was that. I even had my aromatherapy massage before work! Then, another icing on the cake is PJ my supervisor is back!!! NO more slaving away doing 2 jobs at once. Ahh, this is a good life...  Though it rained today and all weekend, it sure was pure sunshine to me!

      Sigh. One love goes and another one is melting my heart all over again. I know, my blog fans--it's raining men this wet season. But yeah, this guy's got me laughin. He's hella fun to talk to. He keeps me busy showin my dimples at work. I even ended up going to work today cuz I knew he'd be online and I promised to call. See, I got a reason to go to work and be excited. That's cuz I was real sick and only had a couple hours of sleep again.   I met him online. Yeah, one of those...but he's different, I think. My gay friend has signed me up for that Latin Singles Connection thing cuz he knows I need to look at good lookin brown men. Anyway, I hate online frontin'. Folks are fake there or just real lonely, or both. But this guy, he's not like that. We're even so alike.   Let me tell u bout him--He got a pet turtle (my fave). He loves raggae and hip hop cuz he DJ's them good music. He's not young--33 now, but he's all man to me! LOL. He got his own house too. Plus, he works for a children's hospital helpin out the anesthesiologist. He has a big heart, and a good head on his shoulders. He knows real life and not about the drama either. He knows how to look at things positively and he's the laid back type of man. He is a great godfather and uncle too. Sigh...good men are hard to find.  Then, the bad stuff--only one actually. He lives all the way in Philly. It will take $2000 just to see him and frankly, I doubt that'll happen. But it's nice to dream. I just thank God for opening my eyes that there are still good men out there. Even if I can't have them. Right now, he's a blessing in my life and I'm grateful for just knkowing he exists. Thanks for the friendship Chill.  *huj, kiss, lick, and a big slap in the ass*

      I hate the beginning of the week. Everything that can possibly go wrong happens on a Monday. But in this case, it's a Tuesday due to Memorial Day holiday in the US. I woke up with a headache at 5am, no food to be found at home, and tried to go back to sleep. I gave up at lunch time and still no food. Then, I rushed to school to try to enrol (going through the wet market as a shortcut to the transportation station) only to be told that enrolment starts tomorrow. Then, my sister and I wait for a jeep that never arrives to get us to the mall so I can get some strawberry ice from Ice Monster (which they ran out of). Paying my cellphone bill took an hour and a half and the line at the grocery was the same. For the first time, I was late to work since the line for the transpo was so long and no ride to be found. Then, I get to the office and my fellow agents at work have some issues...Last, we have the boss over tonight so I have to be good.  But the weekend wasn't bad at all. I went to Xaymaca again last Saturday with my two sisters and after being drenched in sweat and having Pam take pictures of my crush, the sax player, I took my sisters, Pam and Kodjo to Club Chill where we danced til 4am. There was the usual weirdos and I almost had to hit one boy to stay away from my friend. I even had to pretend Kodjo was my boyfriend. (Side note: I forgot how short Filipino guys can be 'coz almost all guys there was shorter than me in my heels). Then, we ate at Mr. Kebab's for some Meditarranean food at 5am. I got home 6:30am--just in time to pack, brush my teeth, and head straight to work for our company trip to the beach.   After a couple hours of travel time--winding roads near cliffs, breathtaking panoramic view of greens and blues of the landscape, sea and sky, and holding my pee and fighting the tempation to keep asking "are we there yet" we reach Eagle Point Resort. We had lunch at a nearby island where we took a boat to get to, then enjoyed the beach and did some kayaking. I was able to see a jellyfish (which stung my manager), flying fish, blue starfish, and other marine life which I thought was pretty but was too afraid to go near. Then we got used to the rooms with the terrace view of the ocean and with the hot shower. We played cards all night and got to know each other (especially the new employee, my buddy ol pal Ron). The next day, I had an eating frenzy with pancakes, 4 eggs, sausages, toast, and bacon!! Then off to swim with the 9 baby sharks and 1 turtle in the marine pool. I was too scared to go far into the pool but it was thrilling to be in it. Then we did more swimming at the pool and headed home (taking us about 4 hours to get here) and we had some more eating frenzy at Bento Box, the Jap restau where I had some Yakisoba, fried rice, gzoya, shrimp tempura, and green tea.   I then went home to go straight to sleep only to wake up 5am today...and the rest of the story, you all know of...

       This question has long been pondered and analyzed by ordinary men and philosophers alike. Yet, in the history of man, the debate has not yet been resolved as to which is more dominant.  There are those who accept things as they are. They are content with whatever situation befalls them, believing that it is according to God's will. They never exert any great effort in changing their situations. They may cry and complain when things are not as good as they trusted God to make it out to be, but that's as far as they will go. The good thing though, is that they live an uncomplicated life. They ask no questions, for they believe life is neither good nor bad; it just is.  Then, there are those who rant and rave when things don't happen for them because they believe that  they alone  have the power to change their situation.&nbsp; They cannot take no for an answer and would fight even if it is to no avail. Though they may be sore losers, the good thing is that they usually get what they want. They aim for the impossible dream, for they believe life is supposed to be good. If it isn't, they can make it so.   Question:   Which one am&nbsp;I? I have will sometimes but I'm not free; or I'm just free but have no will.&nbsp;&nbsp;Is my&nbsp;destiny a figment of my imagination which I'll only realize when I die, or am I just lacking faith in fate?    Answer:   Life is neither supposed to be only good nor bad; it is all and nothing at the same time. The trick at understanding the quandary is to practice the virtue of propriety--right actions for the right situations.     What must be done:   Know thyself by listening to yourself.     ******************************************************* a savior is needed for im drowning. i ask to be taken to the water by my knight, the night. yet, he does not come to hold me 'til i rest in peaceful slumber with the lull of the sea. things are crashing like waves upon me and i hold no fight.&nbsp;i stand before thee... brimming and consequently, overflowing...

          Fatigue has never really gotten to be so bad until lately. Overworked, and yes, probably underpaid, is how I describe myself lately. So when I come home after 12 hours in the office, all I want to do is hop into bed. Yet, dad tempted me with breakfast and over spicy tuna omelette, we had our talk.  First of all, dad and I never really "talk" (that's mom's department). Dad was more of the family head ruler and mom the implementor who was closer to the people. Anyway, I told dad how I felt like I was missing something lately. That I was doing so much, yet, not doing anything at all that is progressive. I said I feel bad for lacking the time and energy to do my schoolwork. I knew what he would say right away and he didn't take long to say it--he told me to quit my work, or at the very least, take a leave.   If only it was that easy. He doesn't approve of me being in a call center. He thinks it is too dangerous for me to travel at night and he sees how it takes a toll on my health.&nbsp; Moreover, he believes that I am capable of more and that this is not my chosen career anyway.  Before he can continue, I had to cut him short and told him that what I do is customer service and it is in the service field which I belong. I need to gain managerial experience for career advancement. Even to volunteer for an international organization, I need supervisory skills or research background.&nbsp; My major by the way, was Asian Studies, and there are very few job opportunities tied in with that unless I teach history.&nbsp;  I wanted my father&nbsp;to understand that telecommunications and call center industry is fairly new and it is now considered as a career. I remember when I was younger, my father gave us the lecture on the difference between vocation, career, and profession. He really wanted me to&nbsp;have a profession--to be&nbsp;a lawyer or doctor. I've always thought, 'yeah right. I'm not good enough to be those." That's why my dad was a bit saddened that I chose to work in a call center rather than take the job teaching for Xavier School or working for the government or the Egyptian Embassy. It was a big decision for me to choose to take my masters in Islamic Studies and work at the same time during graveyard shift for a call center so that I kill 2 birds with one stone--make enough money to help out my family financially and still do something about making my dreams to be a peace negotiator come true.&nbsp;   Anyway, just like when I was a little girl, dad talked in parables. I loved his stories and he'd ask in the end what the moral was that can be learned. I was telling him I'm doing a report on Nur Misuari, MNLF leader, rebel turned governor turned prisoner. We&nbsp;analylzed the man and his ideals and where he went wrong. We had a healthy political discussion I guess. Then, I told dad that I think partly the reason why I was too lazy to do my schoolwork is that reading up on Misuari has left me disillusioned. I feel hate reading about the suffering of people, of massacres, genocide, and injustice in general. I hate it when the bad guys&nbsp;appear to be&nbsp;winning.&nbsp;Yes, I am an idealist. Yet, when I am forced to open my eyes to Philippine history and environment, I can't help but see gloom and doom seem to be inevitable.   Dad and I gave our two cents into the Philippine phenomena and he confessed that that is the reason why we immigrated to America in the first place. We both feel that we are full of hope for the Filipino people, yet, when we really look, we know deep down that it is rotten to the core. No matter how much you shine an apple with a worm in the middle, it will still be spoiled.&nbsp; It is thus so much easier to say that this country has no hope. Even if good people emerge, the system is already rotten. There is no way for progress because there are too many cheating involved, and this has taken place since time immemorial.   I then recounted to him how my mother told me that I will either become part of the wave or die trying to fight it. I told my mom before, I'd rather die. Of course she didn't like my answer. Yet, it is only my father who can understand me and my ideals for that is what I earned from him. He told me the story again of the one candle, no matter how small, can bring light into a big dark room. I felt like the little girl again listening to my father's wisdom.  I went to sleep with renewed faith, hope, and strength...all because my father was able to share with me food for the soul.

           Summary:  Living in the matrix feels as if I've been&nbsp;sucked into the system of nonchalant conformation to the droning of daily dallying. I plan. Yet, that's how far I've gone. What happened to me that I will settle for less, agreeing that my less is the same as other's average?&nbsp;Have I truly&nbsp;lost it?&nbsp;If I did, I would not question this void, right? Wrong, because&nbsp;I&nbsp;do nothing about these thoughts.  "Sooner or later,&nbsp;I will&nbsp;see an opportunity, and take it"  I aim to convince myself. But, it gets harder each day. Quick to advise yet slow to follow. It is all a show of active march onward to tomorrow.&nbsp;I feel like I am but a child feigning maturity. I've become a hermit&nbsp;pretending social&nbsp;proclivity.&nbsp;&nbsp;If it wasnt a natural bodily phenomenon to breathe, I would forget to do so. What madness I have allowed myself to be!   Conclusion:  I have fallen short of my potentials.   Analysis of the Problem:  1. No time. 2. The tasks are too much for me to handle. 3. I lack faith. 4. I'm just too tired. 5. I see others getting away with it.   Recommendations:  Self-criticism&nbsp;can sometimes be good.&nbsp;We just have to know how to do something about it. So, my dear,&nbsp;exhale. And then, start each day as if it was a fresh start. It's tiring but the important&nbsp;thing is to keep trying.&nbsp;Just hang in there a little longer when you feel like you're slipping. These slumps are normal. But think too if you're really happy with what you do and&nbsp;if you are still doing some good to the world and to yourself.   **Sabi nga ni Jollibee, kaya mo yan kid.** Chin up. =) And get your ass moving!

          At least once, we will come to a point where we will question and contemplate. We will wonder what purpose we serve, but mostly, what purpose suffering serves.&nbsp; Some of us are at this point in our lives right now.&nbsp;  &nbsp; Sometimes, I wish we were lucky enough to know the answers so that we can be okay and keep going. I wish I had enough faith, hope, and love to share with those I&nbsp;care about&nbsp;because  nothing is worth ONE tear of my loved ones . I'm so sorry I can't be there for you today physically and even if I was, I'd still feel as helpless since I know there's nothing I can do. &nbsp; Still, let me share one philosophy I learned in school on Buddhism. &nbsp; First Noble Truth-- Life is full of suffering  . &nbsp; Life is imperfect because all of us are subject to being hurt, impermanence, and uncertainty.   &nbsp; Second Noble Truth-- Suffering is&nbsp;caused by desire.     Man has the   natural tendency to cling on to&nbsp;pleasure.&nbsp; Since this is not happiness, it is temporary and can cause pain.      &nbsp; Third Noble Truth-- Suffering can be&nbsp;eliminated.   We must strive to believe that there is a possibility of achieving nirvana and&nbsp;bliss.    &nbsp; Fourth Noble Truth-- We eliminate suffering by eliminating desire through the 8-fold path.    &nbsp;  1. Right Understanding:   Insight is where the path begins. &nbsp; We must try to see things as they really are and not the illusion. It means to have the right view&nbsp;by the use of wisdom, and not necessarily intelligence.    2. Right Thought/Intention   :  Some people say that suffering is all in the mind. We must be mindful therefore if the ideas we have are rooted on resistance to desire as well as&nbsp;intention of benevolence and compassion.   3.&nbsp;Right Speech: &nbsp;  In a world where we are judged more for what we say or don't say, it is important to choose our words carefully. We must practice words of honesty, kindness, and worth.   4.&nbsp;Right Action:     We have all been given the power of discernment to know what is right and wrong and so if our aim is to eliminate suffering, we must follow the golden rule: doing to others what we would want done to us and not doing to others what we won't want done to us.     5.&nbsp; Right Livelihood :  Each of us has our life's work. It's just up to us whether our chosen careers will be one that contributes to building or destroying.     6.&nbsp; Right Effort :  The path is not easy in this ugly world we live in. Iron will through discipline and diligence is needed as we struggle to keep going in our quest for Nirvana.     7.&nbsp; Right Mindfulness :  Being aware of our mind, heart, and body at all times will help us find happiness.     8.&nbsp; Right Concentration  : If we stand firm and keep our focus on our goal to inner peace and freedom, we can achieve all things.  &nbsp;     &nbsp;   I love you guys. Please be ok.&nbsp;BIG HUG.

        Little pins. Stab at wounds. Unseen. Hidden deep. Hold it back. Hold. Keep the dam closed. Breathe. Don't forget. Though it hurts. Close your ears. Don't feel. Use it up. Until no more. Remain.    &nbsp; Whose hand&nbsp;has forced you to be unseen, child? No one has the right nor power to make&nbsp;you invisible nor ask you to hold back. You are a gift to this world, never a burden.&nbsp;Remember, accept the things you can't change with serenity but face the things you can with courage. The trick is to know when to stop the denial and walk away and when to stay on and fight. Either way, exhale, and chin up. You have your armor of strength.

      I've never had more comments on my opinions (posted on blog and otherwise) than when I wrote about Batman (unless you count political debates in class between my know-it-all classmates and equally intellectually-naricisstic teachers). I guess we're all children at heart and there is a part of us that still cling on to idealism--believing that there is some good out there and that rainbows really do come after the storms.  Yet, there were those who told me that they can't relate to what I wrote since they are not fans of science fiction or comic books. I guess it's because real-life heroes are seldom seen these days, and the harsh truths of reality are more evident.  Have you ever received one of those questionnaires you fill out as part of your profile where they ask you for your interests and hobbies, favorite books, movies and songs,and even  personal heroes? Most people will write their mother or a comic book fictional character.  You'll rarely get answers of Princess Di, Mother Theresa, Martin Luther King Jr., Dr. Jose Rizal, Mahatma Gandhi, Jesus Christ, or Mohammed. Is this because there are very few good people in this world who made a dent? The answer is no. Good people only make the books anyway after they die.  Yet, there are many living heroes today who most of us don't know the names of. We just don't pay them any attention.  It is easier to believe that we live by the Law of the Jungle, survival of the fittest. It's a dog eats dog world. Living amidst all the hunger, poverty, wars, and crime of this world, not to mention mounting problems in our daily lives, it is easy to look around and say we bear witness to death and destruction alone...  I look at home, and no one is there but my dog. My parents are always off somewhere doing church activities as the consolation to being jobless or slaving away for a sister who takes advantage of her due to personal favors given to us in the past when we needed financial help the most. Relatives talk about my family and my parents probably feel old, useless, and neglected since all their children are grown. My brother fights off alcohol and drugs as he struggles to be a man living on his own. He tries to find cures to his broken soul due to pressure from school, work, and being used by the one he was in love with. My sisters make every cent last as long as they could until my mom can send their next allowance. They attempt to make the grades to please my parents but it is hard when your teachers need to be bribed by the students and your classmates cheat and backstab to be top one. My youngest sister in California locks herself in her room and cries trying to escape from the aunt she is forced to live with since we are in Philippines. She is tasked to do all household chores there like a maid and has no one she can turn to as a friend.   I look at work, and we are ready to crumble. The board of directors never handled a call center business before. They cut on the budget as much as possible, paychecks sometimes don't come on time, or a signatory fails to write his mark and so cashing it is deterred. The manager is one-woman department of HR, Accounting, Auditing, Marketing, Business Development, and External and Internal Affairs. There is the Training Manager, the supervisor, and me. And we make the whole operation work (at least attempt to). There are two agents also--one is about to resign and the other close to being terminated.(?) This is just some reasons why my supervisor, manager, and I are submitting our resumes to other companies.  In between work and home, I travel and see. I can even smell the mounts of garbage on the sides of the hiway, the people in tattered clothes living under the bridges with their young ones wearing more sad faces and grime than actual clothing, the smoke from the belching of jeepneys and FX's.  Drivers dont see the lanes, let alone stop signs, not to mention pedestrians. You hold on to dear life, getting whiplash from the danger you put yourself through since you cant afford your own car. If you can, you would never drive anyway. Public transportation charge a different rate every time I go on the same route daily and claim that it is because they had to fill it up with the passengers, diesel is high, and it is already night time. That's where you see young people standing alone and waiting for cars to pass by for them to make negotiations until they speed off with the strangers. You see children following you like a shadow until they sell you some flowers you can offer to your saint statues at home. On the sidewalks, people sell anything they can--used clothes, shoes, hair ties, cheap toys, and newspapers with naked young women on the cover (sometimes all in the same stall).  People flock the pawnshops and lotto stands as well as horse race betting stations, and never will you see so many motels along the streets.    I look around at what's going on around me, and I think, "what is there left to do when all you see is ugly and I have my own set of inner personal problems? This world has no hope. Superheroes are make believe only..."  Then, I go to school into the Institute of Islamic Studies building fighting off fatigue and sleep. Yet, it is the only place I can feel is detached from the world outside. It is the only thing real in reality that still holds idealism.  It is just too bad that most people will never understand why I'm studying this for my masters. I then finish class, and take the same route home and suddenly things are a bit different.    I see the sun shining, people going to work and school, and church parking lots are full. I get home and dad asks me to eat before I sleep. I wake up in a warm bed, water to clean myself with, and money for transportation. I get a text message from my sisters or brother just saying hello. I talk to coworkers about anything--from philosophy and books, to fashion and beauty.  We have singing moments as supervisor plays the guitar, and we get a bread and butter/peanut butter jelly buffet from him too. Plus, I have time to surf the net to do research for class. Online are real friends like Joy (my oldest friend since first grade), Ann (old coworker who I call sis), Ernest (my old coach and one of bestest friends who never fails to make me laugh), Leen (my director from church group who taught me how to blog and shares my working day with me), and Pa (who gives me a reason to smile each new day). Plus, I got my paycheck today!!!   Things really can be seen as two-sided. There is the bad and the ugly, and then there is the good and beautiful. It's up to you which side you see just as it's up to you to believe in heroes still or not.

      Im sitting here reading DC comics on The Dark Knight Returns marking the 10th year anniversary since Batman was last seen in Gotham. You might think Im weird (well I am) but it got me thinking...  See, everyone loves Spiderman and Superman, but they had super powers. Yet, Batman, there is a real hero for you because he was a normal human being. Something traumatic happened to him at a young age and it had something to do with his family. He didn't just cry about it. He swore that he would get vengeance by making things right. He strengthened himself and fought the evils of this world, all in the name of righteousness and justice. There are the normal citizens who go against him (believing him to be a social desease who is a negative model of violence). Yet, there are those like us who look up to him for his strength of character and unyielding courage. That is rare in this ugly world we live in.  And that's what makes Batman someone we can admire no matter how old we are already.   I never stopped believing in superheroes because we need to have faith that someone out there is still doing some good...and the best part about it is, I can too.   ------------------------------------------------- Love the mask I wear.  Accept the smiles I hand out.  No seeing my eyes.  The pain it bore for so long.  My soul carries it deep.  Why such sorrow? For such a young child?  No sense. No sense in this world. Easy, crawl in a dark corner. Blame them. Blame them all. No hope. An adult but still the child. Nightmares come. I welcome it. Hold in the hurt. And stay in the night.  When will you awaken Dear knight? You are needed. You need you. The one who is strong. The one who believes.  The one who will do something. Not sit idly and let evil run. Not let the wave crush hope. Yes, easy to give in. Yet, you are a hero. You can't see.  But you should. Put on your suit. No negativity can strike. Answer the call. You too can be Batman, Milliza.

      Good things pass by so fast but boring times drone on and on for some reason. Well, this weekend was one of those good times. Saturday was spent with my sisters. I watched "The Prince and Me" by myself after work and class and my sisters followed so I had to watch it twice. It was an OK movie. Better than one of those cheesy romantic comedies. I had fun with my sisters though.   I bought Mary a slice of chocolate cake from Red Ribbon with a little blue candle for her to blow out. Yeah, she turned 18 last Friday and we didn't even get to celebrate with her.  That's a different story though. It really pisses me off. Most girls get a big celebration on their 18th birthday. I wish we had more money sometimes. I had a big party for mine with a DJ and hella food and Angela got a party at the house and treated her friends at Enchanted Kingdom. Mom and I even got her a big screen tv. Now Mary, mom didn't even give her money for her to treat her friends and she told her instead to use the money I gave her! That was supposed to be for my sister to buy shoes. It just pains me...  I hate to drone on about money and how my parents make me sad but I need to vent. Mom can give money for church like 10,000 for the freakin sound system when they did their church concert and pay for notebooks for this girl who goes to their church stuff but she didn't give it as part of my savings for my little sister's roundtrip airfare in Cali or Mary's birthday thing.  I know. We are blessed by God to make ends meet no matter what. But still, I hate being an adult..paying bills, worrying about my siblings and parents...Anyway, we didn't even have dinner as a family for her birthday. If only I wasn't so broke I would've taken them out somewhere fancy. I went to take a nap and told sisters to wake me up when we're going out but they never did since my mom used me as an excuse (that I was already asleep and since dad wasnt home--yes, he was at church). Did you all know that I didn't even celebrate my mom's birthday, mother's day, and father's day with them? They celebrated with the church group and tagged us along for lunch for mom's birthday.  Anyway, back to my story...  This is me and my sisters (Angela next to me and Mary in blue) Yes, that's our favorite colors: me pink, Angela red and Mary blue =)    Sunday morning, Ryan came home to go to the reunion swimming thing. He came straight from his work and had no sleep. He would've needed to go to work that same night. Anyway, we went to that resort. It was a garden pool thing taht a distant relative owned. They had two monkeys, freakin pheasants walking around (and you all know how I'm scared of birds and chicken) and eagles and lizards and other birds in cages. It was like a safari thing going.  Well, the most fun I had was chillin with just my siblings while we ate. I even ate with my hands! LOL. (food taste better that way) I watched my nieces/nephews and couple of godchildren play in the water. Yeah, just my luck--I was dressed for sun and swim with my pink tank top, sun visor, daisy dukes, and pink laced up sandals but no, I was forced to be on temporary retirement from the water due to the red tide that arrived that same day. Anyway, my goddaughter Aubrey is so cute. Her picture is below. The relatives said I really look like her when I was a baby. What do you think? =) This girl is feisty man. She slaps people and pinches them. She was making bigger kids cry. Lol. She knows how to make you forget you're mad at her though. She just needs to dance and pose for the camera and give you a small kiss. =)     It got boring after a while so my siblings and I went with my cousins home. We watched Pirates of the Caribbean (woo hoo Johnny Depp and Orlando Bloom!) on DVD but I never finished since I spent the rest of the time chatting with Will on the internet there. Anyway, before we knew it, we had to leave and go to mass. My dad didn't even go with us since he was so drunk. Ryan borrowed money for the week and left for work and then while dad was passed out in bed, Mary and Angela packed their stuff. Us girls ate with my mom's new adopted daughter from church and my sisters left for Baguio. It was real sad...It felt like it went by so fast and I didn't even get to really spend time with them. All that hype and...I dunno. Over too quickly. I just can't wait to see them all again. I love my family...  I woke up at like 3am and tried to call Will at 4, went to class by 7am and teacher didn't show up until 10am. Good thing I passed the time talking to Will for a little more than an hour (ouch says my pockets for cellphone bill, woo hoo says my heart). We had Arabic class until 12 and off I went to that job interview. I had to kill so much time so I decided to do my favorite past time hobby--eat. The interviewer was nice and all but I had to turn the job down from that first encounter. It was too far away, I would have to start over as a regular agent, take a back pay, drop my classes since it's day shift, and I had to learn the Australian english accent!!! No way. It's so hard to understand Australian english too. LOL. But really, it's ok. I had a feeling from the start I will most likely stick with my work now, especially since I might get transferred to a new account (bigger pay and higher position? who knows but Im hopeful). Let's not jinx it though...Cross the bridge when you get there.  I was supposed to have dinner with Kweku. Yeah I invited the guy since we stopped talking more than a month ago. It's so weird since he's always been my only friend for the last 5 years or so and then I keep saying bye to the guy. I wanted us to be real friends this time. I wanted to tell him about Will. I know Will doesn't like the idea of me seeing my ex and Im sure Kweku might not be too keen on knowing about how in love I am with someone new, but I guess Im selfish. I dont want to hide anything from anyone. Im just in love and want to share the news with the world I guess, especially someone who was my only bestfriend since I've lived in Philippines. Anyway, it didn't happen. I sent Kweku a text message saying I cant wait 4 hours since interview ended to meet him. I decided to go home and maybe get a 3hour nap before heading for work. Turns out he never got the text message until he was at the meeting place. He called me and he was kinda pissed since he didn't get enough sleep and now need to kill 2 hours before going to his job. It wasn't my fault but I swear the guy knows how to make me feel guilty. For the first time though, I didn't revel in the bitter feeling and absorb it all. I sent him a text saying I hope he gets rest at his job and I didn't mean to change plans on him last minute (what we always fought about when we were still together). He sensed something was wrong with me and replied that he was ok and just look forward to seeing me again. I didn't reply anymore...  Overall, it was a sucky day. I got a major headache. Thank goodness for real friends. This applies especially to you Ernest. Thanks for listening to me rant, letting me cry, listening, and in the end succeeding to making me laugh. I'm truly blessed by the people in my life--family, friends, and those in between.

      Don't you love Fridays? Everything is laid back and you actually look forward to something--the weekend. Well, maybe it's because it's my sister's 18th birthday today and sisters will be home from Baguio by the time I get home from class after work. Maybe we'll go out to celebrate her birthday. Sheesh, I need more money to take them out...Then, Sunday, I have family reunion to go swimming at the resort. I know, it's rainy season but who cares? ... Only worry is, can I still fit in my bathing suit? Hmmm...This weekend should be fun. I want to see my twin godsons and play with my god daughter again. Plus, my brother will actually go to the reunion. By the way, this will be a CHUA reunion. My mom is the 8th of 13 children so there will be a lot of people going...But there's one thing I hate about weekends--I don't get to talk with Pa. Oh well...little sacrifices and time apart will be worth it come Mondays when we talk again right? =) Anyway, I ran out of thoughts for the day. No more creativeness in me. Sorry blog fans. But yeah, I need to do my freakin term paper proposal presentation tomorrow morning on Muslim Women in Philippine Politics. Argh, maybe that's why I can't really look forward to weekend just yet. After that, I have to read Nur Misuari's speeches(former governor of Autonomous Region of Muslim Mindanao and leader of Moro National Liberation Front). Boring I know, but I have a report! Then off to reading "Islam in Conflict" by late Dean Cesar Majul and a couple other people I forgot the names of. I wish I can quit school...But then again, I might have to drop all my classes anyway. Long sigh...I might transfer jobs for morning shift since it's a good career/financial move...We'll see. Sigh, so many decisions so little time. I don't want to grow up yet. I want to stay a kid and be at home where my parents provide for me everything I need...Yeah right. Sigh, they really make me jealous of church. The only one I see at home is Hero (my dog). Maybe that's why Im so excited for this family reunion thing (not cuz of relatives but because my siblings will be there and my parents). I wish Che (my youngest sister in Cali) can come too...and Pa. hehe. That will be a trip to introduce him to the family clan. Ok, I better get started on that proposal presentation. If you're bored, find out what kind of bunny you are, or what "care" bear you are. That was kinda dumb but it made me laugh because mine describes me well:    congratulations. you are the kiss my ass happy bunny. You don't care about anyone or anything. You must be so proud   urlLink   which happy bunny are you?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    **Pa, wonder how Bunny Beater will look like**    Gay Bear    urlLink   Which Dysfunctional Care Bear Are You?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla

      Things in life don’t come easy, I learned early on. Stuff just happens and sometimes, there are no good explanations for them.  So, in defense, I’m always preparing myself for the unexpected hurt bound to come my way. I set up these walls to block them. Who cares if while I’m protecting myself, I’m also locking myself in? I’ve lived always with a wary eye out for the enemies and in so doing, I forgot to live.  I didn’t even realize that there was something wrong with the way I’m handling these things. I’m relatively happy I said.  I have things finally in control. No more tears, at least.  But you came in my life and changed me; you FREED me.  I found it’s not enough that the tears stopped because I need to SMILE too. But you…you made me LAUGH. I forgot I can do that.  You also showed me answers to questions I’ve burdened myself with.  The rain has been POURING down on me for so long, I was defeated by it for a while there. Yet, you taught me that I shouldn’t hate the rain because it’s wet; and just because it’s raining, it doesn’t mean I have to get wet. You really make me feel like superwoman and that I am capable of saving the world. But let me tell you, it will be hard to do it if you weren’t by my side. You’re my inspiration to be better.   You got your head on right and live with passion for life. You know how hard it is to stay alive, I told you before. Now, you’re keeping me ALIVE. I look forward to each coming minute.  I see things in newer colors, I guess. You are too humble to think you’re just the average man. You are too strong and unafraid unlike most of us. Yet, there’s still something in you that has needs, and you are not blind not to see your own weaknesses. Your heart is noble too and your actions wise since you have a sense of right in this ugly world we live in. I think I can talk to you about anything--be a kid with you, be an adult with you, be a sexual freak with you, grow old with you.  Yes, before I met you I already knew what I want my perfect man to be but it has never been realized until I saw it in you. I can go on and on about what I adore about you and what you’ve done for me. But I just really wanted you to know, you are one of the reasons why I know God loves me. I’m blessed you’re in my life. Thank you and I love you.

      Words don't come easy when you are trying to explicate all the emotions within. Nevertheless, all we can do is attempt. (Thanks to pa who keeps prodding me to write more. He's my inspiration.)  When we suddenly wake up with a revelation, what do you do next? Plan out your life? No.  You LIVE life.  You stay awake.  You must remember to wake up each morning and thank God you were given another day to try and make it even better than yesterday. Time is a precious gift.   You must remember to smile more, even to strangers. You never know who might need a friendly reminder that they are not invisible.   You must remember to try and laugh. It is the best medicine.  You must remember that you should not assume those you care about know that you love them. Simple acts of love go a long way.  You must remember to keep your head high and swim even within drowning waters. Swimming is an active sport, not passive like floating. Nothing in life comes easy.  You must remember to try to do an act of kindness to at least one person. Aim not at changing the world for the better; rather, try to make a dent. It will be enough.  You must remember to be yourself and not try to be a hero. If you succeed, others will see you as an example and inspiration anyway.  You must remember to have faith. Know you can move mountains and that God will carry you when you are too weak to go on.  You must remember to keep hoping. Life is meaningless if there is no higher purpose for bad things.  You must remember to love--to keep the bridges open even when you want to lock yourself in walls. Only if you LOVE will you not need to remember to stay awake; it will come naturally.  Last, you must remember to sleep each night and thank God you were given that day. Time is a precious gift because each day is a new step that brings us closer to Him and His Love.

       ***Thank you to all the people who have opened my eyes to see life from a different angle and has made me feel alive once again.    "A time comes in your life when you finally get it... when, in the midst of all your fears and insanity, you stop dead in your tracks and somewhere the voice inside your head cries out - ENOUGH! Enough fighting and crying or struggling to hold on. And, like a child quieting down after a blind tantrum, your sobs begin to subside, you shudder once or twice, you blink back your tears and begin to look at the world through new eyes. This is your awakening.   You realize it's time to stop hoping and waiting for something to change or for happiness, safety and security to come galloping over the next horizon. You come to terms with the fact that neither of you is Prince Charming or Cinderella and that in the real world there aren't always fairy tale endings (or beginnings for that matter) and that any guarantee of "happily ever after" must begin with you... and in the process a sense of serenity is born of acceptance.   You awaken to the fact that you are not perfect and that not everyone will always love, appreciate or approve of who or what you are ... and that's OK. They are entitled to their own views and opinions. And you learn the importance of loving and championing yourself... and in the process a sense of newfound confidence is born of self-approval.   You stop complaining and blaming other people for the things they did to you (or didn't do for you) and you learn that the only thing you can really count on is the unexpected.   You learn that people don't always say what they mean or mean what they say and that not everyone will always be there for you and that it's not always about you. So, you learn to stand on your own and to take care of yourself... and in the process a sense of safety and security is born of self-reliance.   You stop judging and pointing fingers and you begin to accept people as they are and to overlook their shortcomings and human frailties.... and in the process a sense of peace and contentment is born of forgiveness.   You realize that much of the way you view yourself, and the world around you, is as a result of all the messages and opinions that have been ingrained into your psyche. And you begin to sift through all the junk you've been fed about how you should behave, how you should look, how much you should weigh, what you should wear, what you should do for a living, how much money you should make, what you should drive, how and where you should live, who you should marry, the importance of having and raising children, and what you owe your parents, family, and friends.   You learn to open up to new worlds and different points of view. And you begin reassessing and redefining who you are and what you really stand for.   You learn the difference between wanting and needing and you begin to discard the doctrines and values you've outgrown, or should never have bought into to begin with ... and in the process you learn to go with your instincts.   You learn that it is truly in giving that we receive. And that there is power and glory in creating and contributing and you stop maneuvering through life merely as a "consumer" looking for your next fix.   You learn that principles such as honesty and integrity are not the outdated ideals of a bygone era but the mortar that holds together the foundation upon which you must build a life.   You learn that you don't know everything, it's not your job to save the world and that you can't teach a pig to sing.   You learn to distinguish between guilt and responsibility and the importance of setting boundaries and learning to say NO.   You learn that the only cross to bear is the one you choose to carry and that martyrs get burned at the stake.   Then you learn about love. How to love, how much to give in love, when to stop giving and when to walk away.   You learn to look at relationships as they really are and not as you would have them be.   You stop trying to control people, situations and outcomes. And you learn that alone does not mean lonely.   You also stop working so hard at putting your feelings aside, smoothing things over and ignoring your needs.   You learn that feelings of entitlement are perfectly OK.... and that it is your right to want things and to ask for the things you want... and that sometimes it is necessary to make demands.   You come to the realization that you deserve to be treated with love, kindness, sensitivity and respect and you won't settle for less.   And you learn that your body really is your temple. And you begin to care for it and treat it with respect. You begin to eat a balanced diet, drink more water, and take more time to exercise.   You learn that being tired fuels doubt, fear, and uncertainty and so you take more time to rest. And, just as food fuels the body, laughter fuels our soul. So you take more time to laugh and to play.   You learn that, for the most part, you get in life what you believe you deserve... and that much of life truly is a self-fulfilling prophecy.   You learn that anything worth achieving is worth working for and that wishing for something to happen is different from working toward making it happen. More importantly, you learn that in order to achieve success you need direction, discipline and perseverance.   You also learn that no one can do it all alone...and that it's OK to risk asking for help.   You learn the only thing you must truly fear is the greatest robber baron of all: FEAR itself. You learn to step right into and through your fears because you know that whatever happens you can handle it and to give in to fear is to give away the right to live life on your own terms. And you learn to fight for your life and not to squander it living under a cloud of impending doom.   You learn that life isn't always fair, you don't always get what you think you deserve and that sometimes bad things happen to unsuspecting, good people. On these occasions you learn not to personalize things.   You learn that God isn't punishing you or failing to answer your prayers. It's just life happening.   And you learn to deal with evil in its most primal state -- the ego.   You learn that negative feelings such as anger, envy and resentment must be understood and redirected or they will suffocate the life out of you and poison the universe that surrounds you.   You learn to admit when you are wrong and to build bridges instead of walls.   You learn to be thankful and to take comfort in many of the simple things we take for granted, things that millions of people upon the earth can only dream about: a full refrigerator, clean running water, a soft warm bed, a long hot shower.   Slowly, you begin to take responsibility for yourself by yourself and you make yourself a promise to never betray yourself and to never, ever settle for less than your heart's desire.   And you hang a wind chime outside your window so you can listen to the wind.   And you make it a point to keep smiling, to keep trusting, and to stay open to every wonderful possibility.   Finally, with courage in your heart and God by your side you take a stand, you take a deep breath, and you begin to design the life you want to live as best you can."

      It makes me sad to lose friendships especially when there shouldn't be a reason for it. Nevermind being sad; it makes me angry.  I don't like how you are making me choose: friendship or love. That, to me is so unfair. Don't you know that there can be no love if there is no friendship first? If you like someone enough to risk and hope one day true love can happen, then have some freaking consideration for that person. You sure don't make things easier by threatening to never speak to me again when I say I'm developing feelings for someone and that someone is not you. We're all adults here for goodness' sake. I thought you were so smart; then why can't you figure that out?  In a boyfriend anyway, I need a true friend--who'll stick by me through thick and thin and has to be someone I can  ADMIRE . Be the better man and take the losses with grace. You never know--it might not be a  LOSS . If you care about me enough, you won't be selfish. You would be ok just to see me  happy . Yes, this sounds real egotistical on my part but still.   I've lost three good friends lately. One is married anyway so I don't see why he can't figure out I can never go for him. The other, I thought he was a real gentleman and very sweet, but if he's not talking to me, then I guess my impression of him was wrong in the first place. The last guy (who I dedicate the first two paragraphs for) is the "brainiac" who I barely even know and expects me to have feelings for him when all he did was say I'm so naive. He even had the nerve to ask me if I love him the way he wants me to love him. LOVE? What a strong word for someone I never met and lives in Miami. Anyway...  Who cares about them right? I mean they sure don't care about me. All I know is that I feel awesome (despite the anger for those three).  I've long forgotten how good being alive is. I've long given up hope that there can be someone out there. Love? That was just a word Hallmark used to sell their cards. It only really applies to God, family, and friends. But now? =) I don't know. We'll see. The important thing is, I'm LOOKING FORWARD to seeing for the first time in a long time...  EDIT: for further reading on friendship, visit  urlLink Leen's blog today  and do this  urlLink personality test  while you're at it (also thanks to Leen). This is me:  You are an SECF-- Sober Emotional Constructive Follower . This makes you a hippie. You are passionate about your causes and steadfast in your commitments. Once you've made up your mind, no one can convince you otherwise. Your politics are left-leaning, and your lifestyle choices decidedly temperate and chaste.  You do tremendous work when focused, but usually you operate somewhat distracted. You blow hot and cold, and while you normally endeavor on the side of goodness and truth, you have a massive mean streak which is not to be taken lightly. You don't get mad, you get even.

            Hard To Say I'm Sorry by Chicago     Everybody need a little time away   I heard her say, from each other Even lovers need a holiday Far away from each other    Hold me now It's hard for me to say, I'm sorry I just want you to stay  After all that we've been through I will make it up to you, I promise you And after all that's been said and done You're just a part of me I can't let go  Couldn't stand to kept away Not for a day, from your body Wouldn't wanna be swept away Far away from the one that I love  Hold me now It's hard for me to say, I'm sorry I just want you to know  Hold me now I really wanna tell you I'm sorry I could never let you go  After all that we've been through I will make it up to you, I promise you  And after all that's been said and done You're just a part of me I can't let go      The distance between us just got wider and there's nothing I can do. I thought I can shut down like I used to do. The armor comes on automatically and the walls will come block all the emotions. I won't cry, I won't fall. Cold Indifference. It was so easy before. But I can't put up the facade. I apologize from the bottom of my soul.

       WARNING: This is not one of those posts with insight attached to it. It's just something I needed to get off my chest before I explode. Like my other posts, this blog is a way for me to vent. It's more for me than for whoever reads these things.     So, being nice to a fault...Is there such a thing? I never thought that trying to be good to all can be a bad thing. But, that's another lesson learned the hard way.  I recently got my work evaluation and one comment I received from my supervisor is that I'm too nice sometimes and that gives avenue for others to take advantage of me. I argued with Pa regarding that and I said that I was raised as a Catholic believing that I should do good to others at ALL times, especially to my enemies. I thought that if I just do my part, it's up to others on how to react and if they take advantage of that, it will be their "sin" and not mine. Well, how can he argue with me when I talk religion right? I mean it's all a matter of faith and there is no wrong answer for that. As Philippine nation hero, Dr. Jose Rizal said, he looks up to those who practice their faith with conviction no matter if it's different from his religion.  Then, I had to eat my words right after. For some reason that married man is back. I think I wrote about that before. He came from my first job and all the employees there are like my second family. So when he invited me out for his birthday before, I thought nothing of it, even when he said we'd be alone because he treated everyone already at work. Months pass and our schedules would never coincide. So, to stop him from asking me time and again, I finally conceded maybe two months ago. He gave me a big bar of chocolate, we had dinner, and then since it was too early for me to be dropped off to work, we went to this concert bar where R&B bands were playing. We had a couple of beers and he dropped me to work. What few don't know is that at the bar, we had to sit close together and at one point he tried to put his arms behind my back and he was fidgeting with my ring, which of course was on my hand. It was a very awkward moment. Then, when he dropped me to work, I said thanks and gave him a half hug with one arm. He pulled me in an embrace and that was that. But later on that night, he was texting me that he cant stop thinking of the hug and he said he wasn't used to just that. I was so pissed off and I told him he's married and I don't play those games. I was hurt. But I didn't want awkwardness so when he kept apologizing the next day writing that he got drunk after near his house, I just said it was cool and that we're still friends. But seriously, I was hurt and mad...  Now, after two months, he asks how I am and I say Im ok but real busy with work that I dont even have time for school stuff. He then asks if Im busy. I wanted to say, "dang, didn't u just read what I wrote?" but being nice, I wrote instead, "yes, Im busy." He then asks "taken the chance, would u go out with me again?" And thats when I lost it...I gave this guy my friendship even after that whole incident and I tried to be nice the entire time to avoid awkwardness but no, he couldn't take that; he wanted more. What the F is wrong with guys like this. This is not the first time either. Maybe it's a different scenario but the same situation happened before more than once. I text the guy back "hell no. How can you even ask me that?! I told you I dont play games and it hurts you'd think I was that kind of girl. At least I really see now what your intentions are" or something to that effect. I was so mad and I couldn't contain my anger to the point I wanted to cry.  Of course no one understands me. They just say of course the guy is a sleeze and that I was too nice that's why. Now, I'm thinking, was I too nice? Where is the line that says you're a good and kind person and when is it that you're TOO nice to a fault?  So add that crap yesterday to the floods and storms, my having headache and fever but have to work and even do overtime, not having time for schoolwork, I get an instant message from a guy I used to talk to. He and I were friends since high school back in Cali. I never got with him cuz he had a girlfriend, my friend, the entire time, and they're still together. Anyway, he tells me that he's surprising me by coming here to Philippines by next Monday!!! That's not the bad thing. Of course he doesn't know the language and anyone in this country but me. The big deal though is that he's looking for game and I sure as hell am not proving it. But the point is, he even INSINUATED it. He said if he can't get a local girl he'll try and seduce me. Heck yeah, he knows I have a man, but I guess that doesn't stop assholes. He and I are friends like I thought that married guy from my old job was my friend. I try to make the situation so it won't ever be badly awkward. Yet, they seem to have no clue. It hurts that these folks think Im easy; that I dont have my morals and ideals, when all my life I TRY to exude virtues.  Maybe I need to change my whole attitude in life. I don't want this crap happening again. I deserve better than this...

      Call My Name by Prince  Call, call my name Call it, call my name I heard your voice this morning calling out my name It had been so long since i heard it that it didn't sound quite the same, no But it let me know that my name had never really been spoken before Before the day I carried you through the bridal path door And ever since that day I haven't wanted anyone but you And anybody who really knows me knows the truth  Chorus I just can't stop writing songs about you I love you so much I just can't wait to get my arms around you And feel your touch If I don't see you real soon baby girl I might go insane I know it's only been about 3 hours But I love it when you call my name  I heard a voice on the news saying people want to stop the war If they had a love as sweet as you they'd forget what they were fighting for What's the matter with the world today? The land of the free? Somebody lied. They can bug my phone and question people round my home They'll only see you and me making love inside  Chorus  I've never seen the moon look so lovely as the night I saw it with you It let me know I'd never seen the moon before So many speak of the moon as though it had no flaws But to compare it to a beauty like yours would give one pause Nothing about you is false, that's why your love is real God forbid if you belonged to another I'd have to steal you I 'd have to take you from your man I might be tempted to break the law round here Because your beauty, it gives one pause It slows me down  *thanks for the song, Pa. I can't wait...  ----------------------------------------------------- The Warrior is a Child by Twila Paris  Lately I've been winning battles left and right But even winners can get wounded in the fight People say that I'm amazing, strong beyond my years But they don't see inside of me, I'm hiding all the tears  They don't know that I go running home when I fall down They don't know who picks me up when no one is around I drop my sword and cry for just a while Deep inside this armour - the warrior is a child.  Unafraid because his armour is the best But even soldiers need a quiet place to rest. People say that I'm amazing - never face retreat But they don't see the enemies that lay me at his feet. They don't know that I go running home when I fall down They don't know who picks me up when no one is around I drop my sword and look up for a smile 'Cause deep inside this armour... Deep inside this armour... Deep inside this armour... The warrior is a child.  *This is for my pillar of strength, my home, my knight
