       i found the title of this entry when i typed the word A. and for some strange unforseen reason that came up. i do not remember saying that...or typing it for that matter. strange stuff.bored. had more strange dreams. they're getting dirtier and dirtier the more i sleep. i fucking LOVE LOVE LOVE ELLIOTT SMITH.       whyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy did he have to die ?      whyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy did Jeff Buckley have to die?       why do people have to die when it's not their time? who says it's their time when they're 23 years old? why am i so totally hurt by tim's death STILL? oh well. i'm doing all i can to not fall into the whole trap from last year again. i mean come on. i'm so listening to happy music now. it seems to be affecting my mood very nicely. and i've been reading happy books. and watching happy shows. so as long as i can stand it all......i'll be okay.

       i'm so completely bored. there is nothing to do in this household of mine. and on top of it all i'ma bundle o' nerves as of late. not fun. i decided that if i put up my possible mix tape thoughts on my livejournal people will make fun of me, thus i'm gonna have a go at it now.... it really has no set theme, just emotions that people go through. fun fun fun      leaving town - dexter freebish     lola stars and stripes - the stills    photobooth- death cab for cutie     bring it on - nick cave and the bad seeds    these days - nico    everlong - foo fighters    my coco- stellastarr*    wonderwall -ryan adams    velouria - the pixies    kiss me deadly - generation x    please please please let me get what i want - the smiths    somebody to love - queen    misstake - horrorpops     arg. i'm done.

       so corey has not been on the computer all day...and i sent him a kick ass email too. damn it all. i even drew a picture for him. i'm feeling all girlfriendy as of late, which kinda sucks because then i look like a pansy. but i am a girl. so does that count? eh anyway. i feel like i want to make him homemade cards and funny pictures and handmade presents and make him cookies and just...........be with him. be around him. make him feel comfortable. kiss him.run my fingers through his hair.he's just...perfect. i adore him. i can't stand not talking to him. i love seeing him. it's ONCE A WEEK i see his fine ass but i guess it's better than nothing? i just want to do so much for him. last night i wanted to learn all the html codes on livejournal so i could make his journal wonderful. he deserves it. i forgot his password though...but i'm gonna try to figure it out. anyway so i guess i just miss him and just had to write about him so i wouldn't drive myself absolutely insane thinking about him. the perks of a private journal...
