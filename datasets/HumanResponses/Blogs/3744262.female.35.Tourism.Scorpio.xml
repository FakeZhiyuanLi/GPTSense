      And people say there's nothing to see in Ann Arbor. This morning I saw a man in a tan shirt and tan pants get into a tan mercedes. I saw an elderly woman with all white hair pushing a stroller with a small, fluffy, reddish-brown dog in it. I saw a gorgeous rubinesque woman with attitude.  Okay, all these things are pretty ordinary. But they were fun to me. Especially the dog in the stroller.  Galen and I chatted on AIM today (he sent me a message from Tom's computer). He said, "mom," then "himom." I said, "Hi, Galen," and "I love you." To which he responded, "iloveyou2." Not bad for a 4-yr-old, if you think about it: he figured out how to start the chat client, which icon represented me, how to click on it to send a message, and then how to type the messages he wanted to send. Displays a very good ability to figure out how to perform tasks from context. And reading/typing skills. So cool.  Rie came over this morning. She is so much fun to talk to. She might meet me at the gym tomorrow. Galen spent the entire time playing BZFlag.   Today is Wash Day. Fourteen loads of laundry... about a week plus a few days worth of towels, undies, clothes and assorted washable crap. Insert silent scream here.

      Went to the gym again today. Galen had a screaming fit when we got there, and another when it was time to leave. It's all about Perceived Loss of Freedom with him (or lack of choice, perhaps the same thing). Came home, had lunch. Kids want to eat peanut butter for every meal, I swear. Then we walked downtown to the library. I estimate this is about a mile and a half each way. Wandered around downtown Ann Arbor, ever so exciting. Visited Tom at work for a few minutes and then stopped of at EA for snacks. I drank a Diet Coke. So disgusting, so tasty.  Walked home and unloaded the photos from the camera.  urlLink Put up some shots of the inside of my house.    Took this on Sunday, at the park.   My son, such an intense child.   Talked to my mother-in-law today. Told her all about the drama with my family. I'm embarassed by it, but my mother-in-law is a kind person. Her birthday is tomorrow.   I think I'm going to go do something now that (hopefully) doesn't involve a computer.

      Ended up going to the pool yesterday. Even though my car said it was 79F, when the wind blew or the sun went behind a cloud, it was COLD.  To/.,nbvvvvvvvvvvvvvvc f2zzffg' ]]]]]'////.l,,,,,,mn  Zxcvbnm      QW45Zok a few photos at the park, but the camera battery ran out of charge quite fast.   I cheated. I had half a cup of coffee yesterday. Today, I have had none. I feel like crap. But it's a start, I suppose. Went to the gym this morning. I think I've finally gotten the hang of the elliptical machine, even though the stride feels too short. I have a problem with shin splints that just doesn't ever seem to go away. Maybe I'm just too heavy to run, as much as I'd like to be able to. Running is easier on the treadmill, but I swear it feels like I'm always falling off the back.   The only serious thing that's been bothering me is my mom and stepdad (hereafter, "dad") and their imminent divorce. Dredges up all that stuff I was angry about when they were married -- TWENTY years ago. And a little bit about when my mom divorced my father, too. I understood why that happened: my father is a True Loser. My dad, however, is a nice guy. A nice guy with problems, but a nice guy. Even so, I mostly blame him. I am angry at my mom for marrying him for what are, in my opinion, the wrong reasons.   Why do I blame my dad? Because of the state of their house, mostly. From here, it seems like they fought a lot about that house, and I can say with complete certainty that I would not live somewhere with no kitchen or bathroom walls. I hate to go visit them because their house is so uncomfortable. I think my dad blames his ADD for never finishing any of these projects, but it just seems like an excuse. They also seem to fight a lot about money: my mom is into saving it, my dad is into spending it. Like my mom, I enjoy saving money more than spending it, though I definitely enjoy bargains.  Also, they had multiple opportunities, and still do, to go to marriage counseling. I know my dad is taking a lot of prescription medicines, and my mom claims his behavior has gotten weirder over time since he started taking all that stuff. Honestly, I'm too far away to really judge on that point. Though I do know he always seems to be in pain, and seeing it always makes me feel a lot of sympathy pains.   What I keep thinking about is all the times I fought with my dad, all the things he has said to me over the years. He even once apologized, very sincerely, but that didn't really help. Between him and my father, I was freaked out by men for a long time, and there is still even some baggage hanging around somewhere. I still feel like I have to walk on eggshells around my dad, since it is impossible for me to know what is going to piss him off. I think my mom feels that way, too. Unfair to him, since we should just trust him, but old habits are hard to break. A wise man once explained to me that the person capable of displaying the most extreme behavior is often the winner in a conflict. My dad is that person.  I learned that from him, and I have used it to my advantage... but over the years, I have learned to not make it my FIRST reaction.   Time to go cook dinner.

      Yesterday: finished the edge painting in my bedroom, painted a few clouds on the kids' bedroom ceiling. I had some sort of cold (seems to be gone now), and I was really very sore. I think some of that was from going to the gym, though. Then I spent the rest of the day fidding with the style sheet for this blog and listening to HGTV. Tom made a duck (the legs and the breasts, anyway), a salad and some potatoes. It was good, but I'm still not so sure I like duck.  Today: I gave up caffeine. At least, I hope I can. Just thinking about it makes me feel icky. It's not the caffeine that I will miss, but the coffee. Even decaf doesn't cut it -- whatever chemical process they use to remove the caffeine (and not all of it, at that) must leave behind something, because decaf makes me feel worse. I won't elaborate. But that is why I am sitting here at 1p on Sunday instead of taking my kids out to the park. Feeling a bit sluggish.

      One of the second-hand blessings of the increasing girth of youth is that I can now find a wider variety of clothing in my size. I have never been smaller than a size 9, not since I was about 11 or 12. In order to be a size 9, I would have to reduce my body fat to about 8-9%. Not gonna happen.  I hate managing my family finances. I don't know how. I don't really WANT to know how. My very best consists of being able to make sure the bills are paid and that we can sometimes put money away. But managing finances is much more pervasive. It means planning meals, which is hard to do. I never know if Tom is going to be home any given week, and I have grown extremely tired of cooking anything involving more than 45 minutes worth of work. As I've mentioned before, it's just not worth it. By the time Tom gets home, it's cold. And the kids just refuse to eat it. I'm going to cave and feed them hotdogs and frozen pizza from now on. To heck with all the research I did about nutrition. Despite the fact that too much sugar in any given day makes my kids into complete and utter jerks... not to mention the diarrhea and tooth decay. I get no help, and I'm the last holdout from the overwhelming waves of people giving my kids mountains of sugar.  Wow. That paragraph started out about how much I hate money and ended up being about how much I hate sugar. I must be in a very bad mood today.

      My day went as follows:  Spent much of the morning on the phone with various hardware retail clerks trying to track down a Ryobi 105r string trimmer. Probably going to have to buy one from amazon.com. Galen says, "Why don't you just cut the weeds with scissors?"  Got into and out of a fight with Tom. Kudos to Tom for approaching the disagreement with the intent to solve it.  Went to see Spiderman 2. I want to have sex with Alfred Molina. But then, I would have before I saw Spiderman 2. Didn't get any snacks. Standing in line behind all the fat asses waiting at the concession was a reminder of how I don't want to look from behind. Galen says, "Why don't you just close your eyes?"  I am contracting whatever flu or cold that has been hammering on Tom all week. Hopefully I will be out of it  by Tuesday. I have lots of plans for this week.  My brilliant social engineering of the week is a new scheme for manipulating Adia, ever stubborn, clever, obstreperous and downright intransigent. After asking her to stop, leave, et cetera, more than 3 times, I have hit upon asking, "Adia, do you want me to be a nice mommy, or a mean mommy?" The idea being that if she doesn't OBEYME (Adia thinks this is all one word), I will switch from asking nicely to asking... more firmly, shall we say. I wonder how long this will be effective.

      Top Five Least Favorite Physical Sensations:  1. Pregnancy, especially around 9 months. Labor is bad, but not as bad as being pregnant, every day, day after day for more than 40 weeks. 2. Urinary tract infection. TMI. 3. Stuff stuck to the bottoms of my feet. 4. Stuff under my fingernails. 5. Dry heaves.  Top Five Most Favorite Physical Sensations:  1. Freshly showered, in clean clothes. 2. Sips of hot tea, preferably Assam. Heat clears my sinuses and makes my vision clearer. 3. 10-15 minutes after Strenuous Physical Activity. 4. Cold shower on a hot day, or any other kind of water-skin contact. 5. Hugs, preferably from my kids or Tom.

      A friend of mine recently said that she very much believes that opposites attract. I'm not going to print her name, because I'm not sure what her take is on privacy. I was a little drunk when she said it, so whatever goes on my brain, ... well I stored it away and I've been thinking about it ever since.  Now, it's not like it's the first time I've ever heard it. But might be the first time I've ever really thought about it. Maybe the mistake I made in the past was to try and make relationships work with people who are like me. You think you can have fun with a person who has similar interests, right? Maybe the idea of resonance applies to relationships: when it's great, it's really great, when it's bad, it's intolerable. Wavelengths in the same phase are additive, right?  So maybe it's better to be just slightly out of phase with your SO. That way, sometimes you resonate, and it's great. Sometimes you compromise (say, when you are slightly out of phase), but the net effect is still positive. And, of course, sometimes you resonate in the negative, but not with any sort of frequency that eventually burns out all the components.  No, really, I am not a nerd.  I am just beleaguering an analogy.  Lately I am going through this stage where the mess is more tolerable than the effort to clean it up. That's kind of understandable, since I live in a household of four people that manages to generate 12 loads of laundry every week, two overflowing cans of garbage, plus additional assorted recyclable stuffs. In fact, we'd probly throw out a lot more if I didn't hoard certain things for future use (eg, I save egg cartons because they are great for holding little dips of paint for the kids and I save oddly-shaped pieces of foam blocks for them to play with; also, there are piles of cardboard that need to be cut into manageable size for the recycle truck to carry away).   Fortunately for me, I am married to a man who does dishes and picks up the house.

      I completely forgot to mention that I got a call from an old employer: a contracting company called Mindsource. At first, I thought this was pretty creepy until he explained that my resume had turned up on careerbuilder.com with their name in it. Then in my most cavalier tone, I asked, "Mindsource doesn't have offices in the Detroit area, does it?"   I think that stumped him. He wished me good luck. But that's two pings from past employers who'd hire me again. Though I am not sure if a hit from a contracting company is much of a compliment.

      Galen now likes Safety Town, though he was a bit wobbly when I first dropped him off.  Tom came home instead of going to San Jose. Guess there is no point in giving a presentation when you can't talk at all. He's been asleep for most of the day. I made him chicken soup and tea.  My back is still hurting. I did some brief research, and I suspect it's a muscle spasm. Apparently these go away on their own, but if I stll have it by next Monday, medical intervention is a Good Idea. Alas, muscle relaxants are only available by prescription (unless you count scotch or live in Canada).   My mom called last night. My grandmother has had gall bladder surgery. In order to do the surgery, they took her off all of the other junk they had her on -- sedatives, anti-psychotics and so forth. My mom says that she was more lucid than she has been in a month. Lucid enough to ask how long she'd been hallucinating.   No word from my dad. This is, of course, my fault, as I was supposed to call him back and I never did. But I still don't know how to tell him what is rattling around in my head. It was much easier to tell my mom, since I really don't feel like I have much to lose from her. If you've been a mom even for a day, you have some idea why... I've puked on my mom, lied to her, stolen her makeup, jewelry, pantyhose, and probably broken most of the precious things she's owned. This plus other things, well... I've done my worst.   Last night, Galen and I played word games and then worked on putting ING at the end of words. I he just reads now. Just like that. Kinda like how he started talking. I always felt like Galen understood me when I was talking to him, even before he could talk well. With Adia, she can talk and talk and talk nonstop, but I really can't tell if she always understands. Sometimes I try to make her understand something is serious, possibly even dangerous, and she laughs and makes a face as if to indicate that she is just too cute to ever be serious. Frustration abounds.  Here are my two news offerings for today:   urlLink Nuclear weapons in Iraq.    urlLink Electronic voting horrors.

      Well, yesterday was possibly the worst day of the year so far. You'd think that finding out my parents are separated would take that award, but no. Or maybe that my grandmother has gone completely around the bend, but no.  I had my first job interview in four years yesterday. I left feeling so bad that I'm positive I blew it. Even though my description of the proceedings seem to get the response of "I'm sure you did fine." ... I just don't feel that way. It's one thing to get a second-hand story, and quite another to be standing there and seeing the body language. And yes, I'm a big believer in body language.   But that wasn't what made the day bad. On the contrary, it was a relatively positive experience, despite my sweating, light-headedness, my aching back and the overwhelming need to use the washroom. (And I lost an earring, much to my embarassment.)   I took Galen to "Safety Town" yesterday. If you're wondering what that is, look  urlLink here.  I signed him up because I was assured he would have fun. Instead, he started screaming and throwing a fit. I don't know whether this is because he was scared or because he would rather have stayed home and played computer games -- he said both. Also, he wiped his oozing nose on me. The teacher said I could go look for the director and the police officers and get a tour, but when I went to find them, no one was there. Because I had to leave early to go to the interview anyway, the 40 minutes I spent trying to acclimate him prevented me from being able to actually leave him there for any significant amount of time.   Then there are the things he says to me, when he is mad like this: "You're a bad mom."  "You're stupid." "You're a piece of crap."   Do you ever wonder why you felt ignored by your parents? Maybe because you talked to them like this, and they got tired of trying to GUESS how to make life fun for you. I swear, no matter what I do, it's just not right. Galen would rather sit around and watch television and play computer games, but Adia wants to be outside on the playground with other kids. And since they are so young, they seem to have absolutely no understanding of how their demands make other people feel. I'm sure that's normal, but it's still frustrating. When I take them to the gym, I waste precious time trying to keep him from escaping, but when it comes time to leave I get to endure his slurs on the quality of my motherhood for removing him from the gym daycare. And yes, I know it's all about power: specifically, he doesn't have the power to decide where he goes and when. He seems a lot more sensitive to that than most. Yet knowing all this doesn't help metabolise having my efforts thrown back into my face. Or worse... you should see the enormous scratch on my back.  Yep. Worst day of 2004. But the silver lining is that it might be the worst day for the whole year, in which case, it's OVER.  The best is yet to come.

      My kids put a bunch of small stickers on the fish tank. The fish seem to think that these are small particles of food and are going nuts banging their little snouts against the glass.  I haven't written anything in days and days. I went to NYC and I meant to write while I was there, but I was unwilling to fork over the $15/day for internet access. I wasn't sure how they determined that a guest was connected, so I didn't even bother to open up my laptop and record my thoughts for later publication, on the off chance that my wireless would try to automagically connect and trigger some sort of logging mechanism. Didn't matter. I left my hotel room at 09:30 and didn't return until about 03:00 the following morning. I could have stayed out all night, if I had known that once in bed, there was no sleep to be had. But if I were that prescient, I'd move to Las Vegassass.  First, I went and got coffee and a protein bar. $12. Damn, NYC is expensive. Then I got on the subway after wandering around the block trying to figure out how to get down there. Many of the visual cues for subway entrances are hidden by things like newspaper stands, bicycles and loitering tourists. My destination: The American Natural History Museum. Even though I missed the Petra exhibit, I spent about 4-5 hours wandering around. I gawked, gaped, wowed and swooned until my body informed me that it was in need of something to offset the insulin rush I had produced with the caffeine and sugar earlier that day. A quick stop in the washroom showed my eyes (in the mirror, of course) to be bloodshot and pink. Sore from too much looking, I assume. When I left the museum, I called Deb, who says, "WHERE ARE YOU!?!?!??" This was a clue that I had surpassed being fashionably late into being insanely, rudely late. But gladly, I was forgiven.  I went back to the same subway entrance. This is a trick I have learned from traveling, to retrace my steps, especially when I am hungry and otherwise bleary. Alas, the stop was "Under Construction," and I was forced to THINK. Heaven forbid. I had to take a train all the way north to 125th street in order to cross over to the other side. I was smart: I hopped on an express that took me back south to a station without all the intervening stops. Okay, I confess, I kind of did that by accident. Changed to the right train, then changed again, then GOT OFF AT THE WRONG STOP. Fortunately, blocks in NYC are shorter than Chicago, because when I called Deb for directions ("WHERE ARE YOU?!?!????"), my heart nearly stopped when she told me to walk back six blocks. This is why I was wearing my beloved boots instead of some girlie sandals. A shame, really, because my feet are cute, but they were safer and more comfortable in boots.  Deb's place was fun. People came and went. Someone emptied the keg. I saw many people I have not seen in years, and most of them I barely recognized. But there is nothing better than being in a large crowd full of hyperactive and intelligent people, all talking at once. Hurray for Deb. She really knows how to bring people together.  Then I invited myself along for dinner, then we walked about 2 miles to some awful bar. Ask me sometime, and I will tell you about The Vomiting Albino and The Crax Butt Glass incident. But only when you are drunk, as it would not be as funny if you are sober.  And at the risk of letting out my Inner Cheerleader: I love you guys.   I can't wait to go back to that museum with my family.

      Talking about credit cards. Set off a rant. So to save those of you who talk to me regularly from having to hear me blow off my stupidity over and over and over... I'm just going to write it down and hopefully get it out of my system. Or, at least, have something to link to in the future if anyone actually CARES about my opinion on this matter.  Credit card companies are shitting where they eat. I know a few people who are lower middle class and middle class income earners. They have not thousands but tens of thousands (in one case, almost 100,000$) of dollars in credit card debt. The last few times I applied for a major credit card, I was rejected, even though our household falls into the upper middle class income bracket.  Now doesn't that seem kind of strange to you? That people with lower income can get huge amounts of credit extended to them, but we can't? Is our credit that bad? We just bought a $300,000 house. My rating is over 700, Tom's is over 600. I'm told that's really good. Are the credit institutions just taking sympathy on these poor poor people, who want so much... need so much... and Just Cant' Keep Up!?!?!?!???  Or maybe the lower middle class income earner is a sure bet. Give them 80,000 in credit, they will use it ALL up and never, ever be able to repay it. A constant source of interest. At least, until they file for bankruptcy -- not that they get a lot of sympathy. Their debt comes from self-indulgence.   So how does this turn into "shitting where you eat?"   What happens to credit card companies when 40 million people file for bankruptcy?    You know, I once saw this very interesting documentary about "killer" whales that beach themselves to catch seals. To eat. But if they snag more than they eat, they will return the seals to the beach (as unharmed as possible, one assumes). Why do they do this? Scientists suspect that the whales have some understanding that seals make more seals, and therefore more food. Waste not, want not.  If a whale can figure it out, what the hell is wrong with the bank?

      So I got an interview. I think I mentioned that already. Installed nessus last night (and glib and gtk). Had to edit the install scripts a bit. It's very pleasing to know that I can still read and write Bourne shell.  Today, I went shopping for groceries. Forgot milk, but I didn't have a list -- no printer, how lazy is that? -- but the kids make so much fuss that about halfway through the trip i'm walking around with my eyes glazed over and my teeth clamped together trying to remember everything and trying not to SCREAM at the kids. And they say people with kids live longer. How horrible.   Then I came home to do some reading. Since I got the kids some popsicles (rice dream, and they can't tell the difference) and then made the boy promise that he'd play without bothering me for 3 hours, after which we would do something fun like go to the pool or library. That just didn't work. No, it didn't. And because we still haven't set up the a/c window unit, I'm already irritable and just inches from gating them into their room. And that'd be the nicest thing. They wanted paint. They wanted food. They wanted juice, and water inspired tantrums. The littlest one peed in an empty laundry basket (there are two in permanent residence on my living room floor). I got my revenge by hosing her down with the hand-held shower... this being the reason I installed it. She giggled.  At this rate, it takes me about an hour to read two pages. I've taken to reading out loud. For some reason this makes it easier to concentrate.  I found a preschool/daycare/after school care with a great reputation and OPENINGS! (See Erin do the Snoopy Dance of Unmitigated Joy.) Even if I don't get the job, I think it's good to plan ahead, because EVENTUALLY I will have a job. Eventually. Event. Uall. Y.  Went to the Library. It was insanely crowded, but that was good. I love their fish tank. So clean, and the fish look so happy. (Aside: some jerk just raced in front of my house with his horn blaring, about 15 seconds. I need a storehouse of waterballoons and a remote control delivery system. Maybe tied into a radar gun.) We checked out 3 kids' books and one rather hefty collection of photos of the Natural History Museum in NYC. Gee, I wonder WHY I got that one. It's for Galen. Honest. Hey, he likes that we have shared interests.   See my kids wrestling for space on the chair. Hear them scream. Notice that Erin does not even flinch.  Came home and made Galen's favorite... one of them, anyway: orange ginger chicken. I've gotten pretty good at it. (Galen just fell out of the chair.) He likes pork ribs, too. Guess I must be feeling guilty about abandoning them this weekend.  Now I'm back to reading, right after I finish this post. It has been a mixture of bad and good today. Bad being the way the kids behave (which is not so bad, except that I'm just tired of trying to correct it every second of every minute of every hour of every day....). Good being finding good daycare close by and have an opportunity to interview (which is almost as good as getting a job, nowadays).

      There are times when the mere presence of your children is precedent to injury.  In case you're wondering, I burned myself on the popcorn popper. I am using the word "presence" to mean not only the physical proximity of the child, but everything that carries: the noise that a child is capable of making, any projectiles and/or satellites associated with the child, et cetera. Just made an incredible slab of ribs (two, but I didn't tuck into the other one... saving it for Tom). The secret is to cook them in a foil packet at a low temperature (today was 280, because I was short on time) for a long time (3-4 hours), then finish them over a very carefully prepared pile of coals and wood chips. The coals and wood chips should not be insanely hot, either. The point of this being to render off the fat, then permeate the tender meat with a nice smoke flavor. For additional flavor, I used a dry rub and some bbq sauce.  I have a job interview. An actual face to face interview with a living, breathing human being. I am just short of being honored. Of course, I have to prepare, which means re-reading a lot of stuff. Just as well, since it's interesting reading. Most of it.

      Went to The Taste yesterday. I was sort of disappointed, to say the least. Not because it rained on us, several times -- though I think I need to get some of those little plastic disposable parkas to carry in my bag. Not because it was crowded, though it was, and people were shoving and rude, all to be expected. I guess I wanted more food... and more from the food. If we ever go again, I'll borrow a double stroller for the kids. Then we can collect all of our food and go picnic on the grass somewhere.  We left the crowds and hid in the library for about an hour, reading kids' books and taking refuge from the rain. Huge libraries are crack for my soul.   The day was not a total wash, by far. For dinner, we went to Les Deux Autres in Glen Ellyn (462 Park Blvd). Glen Ellyn reminds me a lot of some of the more upscale parts of Ann Arbor. LDA is in a very unassuming (and easy to miss) collection of shops by a railroad track. We were given the opportunity to taste two wines and choose between them, which has never happened to me before. The food portions were quite generous, too. I skipped starters so that I would have room for dessert, and since I cleared my salad and main course from their plates, I barely had that. Dessert was nigh indescribable, it was so good. I'd like to go back just to order 4 courses of dessert. Everyone was very warm and friendly, though in the end, we may have been rude to them. But we felt bad for lingering, because we were the last people to leave. That's the excuse, anyway.

      I guess it's official. I'm going to NYC next weekend. First time traveling out alone since I was married. I don't think I've been anywhere on my own since I went on that stupid Paranet expedition. I know I've been a number of places on my own, but not in what seems like forever. Heck, I remember being creeped out when Adia was born, after Tom took Galen home and I was basically alone in the hospital bed. They left behind Galen's little sweatshirt, so I put it over my pillow and slept on it.  That seems like a long time ago.   Considering going to the Taste of Chicago tomorrow, with the kids. Since Chicago is having its fireworks tomorrow, there might be more than a million people down on the waterfront. Might be a bad idea.  Going to watch Cold Mountain now. And not think much about going to NYC. Why am I anxious? I don't know.

      I just had to wash out the garbage can again. I'm not the only person who makes garbage in this house. I'm not the only person who uses the garbage can. I'm just the only person who reaches down into its black depths to pull up the moldy citrus peels and otherwise unidentifyable objects, braving the putrid smell of rancid slime. Then I get the special pleasure of hosing it out.   Top five worst house chores:  1. Cleaning urine from the walls and floor around and behind the toilet.  2. Picking the trash off the bottom of the garbage can and rinsing out the slime as described above. 3. Sticking my hand into the garbage disposal to remove Ungrindables. In addition to being dank, rank and generally gross, I'm always afraid it will go off. 4. Extracting the accumulated hair from the shower drain. 5. Cleaning the stovetop.  Now you know why housewives wear rubber gloves. And you thought it was just a fashion statement.

      Today as I was dragging my kids around the mall... out of the mall, to be more accurate, I stumbed past a Brand New For Fall plaid skirt. A gorgeous skirt. A skirt I'd actually buy instead of walking past, thinking, "I can make something much nicer than that." And it was $32. A bargain (not really, but hey....).   Ten skirts on the rack and all of them are a size six. I checked other racks. Nope. I asked a sales clerk (visibly NOT a size six herself) and was informed that what was on the rack was what there was.   Well folks, I'm going to be 36 this year. I haven't been a size six in living memory. In fact, I will never again be a size 9 and am likely to spend the rest of my life as a size 12-14, and that's that. I exercise, I eat well, for the most part. I yam what I yam.  So I took the skirt in my hand and walked back to the Guest Services desk. Behind that counter were three other women. After excusing myself in advance for being upset, I elegantly slid the skirt onto the desk.  "Look at this beautiful skirt."  Looks of confusion.  "It's a size six. There are ten skirts on the rack, and they are all size six...." I pointed to one of them, "Are you a size six?"  "No"  "I'm a size six," says the one in the middle. So I look at the third one, "How about you?" "Not me."  So I proceeded in the most apologetic and self-righteous way possible to explain that fat people like nice skirts too, and would they please pass it on to whoever does the bloody ordering that NOT EVERYONE IS A FUCKING SIZE SIX.  In case you are wondering, size six is really small. It's like pencil thin. At least, it is to me. For the more anorexic size ZEROES, it's probably fatty fatty two by four to be a size six. Get over yourselves and go out for a donut already.

      I keep sneezing. I really dislike the way it feels when I sneeze.  I spent all day cleaning house. It still doesnt' look clean to me, but it does look better. Freed of clutter and crumbs, this house is definitely magnificent. I no longer feel like spending thousands of dollars. Must have been that feeling that things were Out Of Control creeping up in my peripheral vision. If I keep saying that, maybe I will override the little pith of glum that is gnawing at my lower spine. Usually whatever it is bubbles up faster than this; I figure it out and then go on. My subconscious is taking it's sweet (not) time, this time.  I still hate all of my clothes. Or maybe my clothes just hate me.  Adia is scheduled for another EEG tomorrow afternoon. I'm going to get them up early (yeah, right), then go to the gym, take them for a picnic in the park and hopefully run them ragged. EEG works better on child if child hold still... meaning, it's better if she takes a nap. So I scheduled the appointment for 3p and hoping she'll sleep. Yeah, right.

      Sleep has been a bit difficult, but it's great to be sleeping in my own bed. Nothing more comfortable, I assure.   Spent the day doing yard work, now the yard looks very nice. Weeded around the rose bushes and put down cedar mulch. Tom mowed the grass, and I put down some weed&feed, and then some seed in the back yard. I still need to weed around the hydrangeas, but I'm not sure I have the energy.  After making our own little pizzas (I cheated and bought balls of dough I found in the frozen section, but they are locally made, which counts for something in my crazy brand of logic), we are all sitting around watching Good Eats. Adia snuck up to the TV during a couple of head shots of Alton Brown and planted a big smooch on the screen.   I think Adia likes Alton Brown.   For the last few days, I have had this bizarre urge to go on a huge shopping spree. I'm talking thousands, possibly tens of thousands of dollars. Things I would buy with this money: a headboard for my bed, a vanity table, bunk beds for the kids (probly going to buy this in September anyway), a 'chair and a half' with matching ottoman, a new stand for our television, a new dining room table and 8 matching chairs (ours don't currently match, but i've never cared before), three 4-5 shelf bookcases, a new clothes washer and dryer, a new deck complete with furniture, assorted landscaping plants and lots of clothes for Tom, the kids and myself.  Some new rugs, carpets, towels and assorted linens wouldn't hurt, either.   The most expensive back to school shopping binge in history?

      Yes, we are baack in Ann Arbor. As soon as I walked into the door, I started to shake and I haven't quite stopped.  Adia is completely normal. She and Galen are playing very LOUDLY right now. Hurray for Life's Small Things. I have the name and number of a neurologist in AA to follow up with.  I did some research into the anti-emetic suppository. I found out that they are 2% benzocaine. That's a mere 2mg, provided my math is correct. Yes, benzocaine is in everything, even preparations for infant teething. But I also found information on possible links between applications of benzocaine and methemoglobinemia, specifically when applied to mucosa, like the rectum. Obviously it would be nice if this were the case, or even if it were somehow an adverse reaction to something contained in the anti-emetic. Then we wouldn't be always jumping every time she twitches.

      EEG was normal. I saw it -- looks like a scribble. Hard to believe it's not voodoo. Neurologists must be very smart and slightly insane. Going back to Ann Arbor tomorrow morning, as early as possible. Seems sort of surreal.   While I was sleeping (actually, it felt like i was partially dead), Tom and his mom brought Adia home. I woke to the sound of her loud and excited voice. Then she came upstairs and crawled into bed with me, snuggling into me with a conspiratorial grin. I sat behind her in the bathtub and painstakingly combed the snarls out of her hair. You'd never know to look at her that she had ever been sick (Tom's mother said that, and it's true).   I am tired in a way I cannot describe. And a bit freaked out, too. But it's over. For the most part. Obviously we will have to follow up with Adia's pediatrician.

      ....and still waiting. Adia is scheduled for an electroencephalogram today. Her assigned nurse woke us up around 6a CDT. Adia was asleep when I got back to the hospital around 10:30 last night, and slept until I woke her up. She's in a good mood, though quite bored. I promised her that once I was done writing this note, we could watch some Strongbad animations.  No idea when the EEG is happening, but I hope it's after breakfast. I fed Adia some pudding this morning, but I think she will be more cooperative with food in her belly.   If you saw her, you wouldn't worry. Outside of The Ivy, being covered in streaks of marker color, a few faded bruises and a seriously bad case of bedhead, she is Normal Adia. I don't know if I can ever get the snarls out of her hair. Maybe I should have tried when she was sedated yesterday (not that I had much of a chance).   After the EEG, we can go home.

      Adia had an MRI at about 1p this afternoon. Absolutely normal. Yes, it's a surprise even to me that Adia has a normal brain. After all, she's my child.  Bad jokes aside, this is good news. It means that there is nothing growing in her head. Tomorrow, she will have an EEG to rule out the possibility of epilepsy. Note that it is pretty rare for kids her age to manifest epilepsy. They are still monitoring the culture for viral meningitis. But this too is seeming like a pretty remote possibility. Our two best horses are Dehydration and Unknown Chemicals. Believe me when I say there will be no more Tigan going into my kids.  The hardest part of all of this has been watching Them Poke&Prod. Needles, monitors... she is covered in small bruises and patches of red skin where various things were stuck and then detached, taking a fine layer of skin cells along. Then there is the dreaded "Ivy" (IV)in her left wrist looking a bit worse for wear from the tugging, banging and so forth, even though the entire lower part of her left arm is nearly completely taped to a padded board. The whole area is swollen, but the IV appears to be still functional, so it's better to leave it than to struggle to get another one in.   She spent most of the morning begging me for food and drinks, which was just a little emotionally wrenching, especially since the MRI dept was running behind schedule. That is over now and she is quickly making up for lost time. She should be plump again in no time. Tom reports that she is up and running around now, I'm betting that's due to whatever they gave her to reverse the sedation used during the MRI.  I'm going to sleep now. I get night shift tonight.   Oh, and please ignore any spelling errors. I'm exhausted and distracted.

      Um...  So Adia is still in the hospital. I'm back at Tom's parents' house after a very surreal drive. Just yesterday, I was driving around trying to find a replacement for my lost cell phone. Now I'm driving the same streets completely exhausted, distracted and a somewhat skewed perspective.  She is still in isolation, meaning we have to wash our hands often and wear masks. There is still no word on the viral culture or any idea what the hell happened. Maybe we will know more tomorrow, maybe after the MRI and EEG. Maybe never.  Adia seems very weird to me. Maybe it's the skewed perspective, or maybe it's that the sedatives haven't completely worn off. Or maybe it's simply that she hasn't really eaten in almost 3 days. She is lethargic, has trouble sitting up and her attempts to stand end in her falling over onto her ass. She keeps thrashing around like she is in someone else's body (which is a special pain in the ass because she's attached to an IV and a pulse/oxygen monitor). Thankfully, she's in a shiny chrome cage to keep her from falling to the floor. As far as I can tell, these cages are made by a company called HARD. Poetically appropriate. I assume that chromed metal cribs are just easier to sterilize. But they are also disturbing.  She is sleeping in short shifts of about 2-4 hours, interrupted by a few hours' wakefulness. Tom gets night watch. I stocked him with Playdoh, markers, paper, and assorted doodads, and pudding. But as of midnight, Adia will be 'NPO.' Ah, the dreaded NPO. The nurse explained that to do the MRI and EEG, she will need to be sedated once again. Don't want to risk vomiting under sedation, since aspirated food equals lung infection.  As for me, I'm going to bed now. I'm hoping to wake up sometime around 4-5a and head over to relieve Tom.

      As of this morining, Adia is doing well. She is very wonky and disoriented as the sedatives wear off. She has not had a dose of anti-seizure medication (addivan?) since yesterday around midnight, and has also not had another seizure. This is good news.  We are pending the results of the spinal tap. The culture for bacterial meningitis is negative. A culture for viral meningitis takes longer. Some toxicology test on her urine tested positive for amphetamines, but there is no way she could have ingested anything. The long shots for that are the Tigan or the Tylenol Sinus (has pseudoephidrine). All very long shots, more likely just a false positive.  She has been seen by a neurologist, possibly the nicest person so far (and these people have all been incredible). He has ordered an MRI and an EEG to be performed tomorrow.   We have been moved up one floor and out of pediatric ICU. We now have a room with extra chairs and a shower. My first act upon being relocated was to stand under a raging torrent of hot water to rinse off Adia's blood, urine, snot and vomit, plus my own tears and the smell of fear. I was spelled by Tom's mother, Helen; she has plenty of experience in haunting the hospital, as she has raised four kids of her own. I don't know what I would be like if I didn't have Tom's family around me, now. I am grateful at least for this: it happened here, with people around, instead of when I was alone at home.  I finally called my own mom and told her, but not my dad yet (apparently my uncle called him for me, which is kind of embarassing). I just didn't want to drop a bomb on her when I was in a less than calm state.  I am on my way back to the hospital now. More later.

      For the third and fourth time in my life today (well, yesterday and today), I rode in an ambulance. Up front, last time. It is very surreal to see familiar landscape lighted by strobe lights.  Adia had two seizures. As of this moment, no one knows why. We have been moved from ER to a PICU at HOPE. That probably means nothing to most of the people who read this, if any). ER attempted a spinal tap, but Adia was a bit too against it for them to get it done right. So it has to be done again.   Needless to say, I'm unhappy. Also, pissed, bewildered and more scared than I ever imagined I could feel. But oddly disconnected, too. It is inconceivable that there is anything really wrong. Unfathomable.  I am sitting in the lobby of the PICU. We are not allowed to be in the room while the spinal tap is done, to reduce the risk of infection. Also, to prevent us from seeing a team of medical staff hold my screaming child down and poke her with what is probably a long and scary needle. Lobby of PICU just happens to have a computer with internet access that runs IE (and pretty much nothing else as far as I can tell).  I keep thinking it might be good if I could doze off. Whenever I close my eyes, I see Adia dancing naked in front of the TV.   She is dreaming now. I can see her eyes move. She is pretty heavily drugged... sedated to prevent any more seizures and to allow Them to do their tests. When Adia sleeps, her eyelids never close completely, so you can see her blue eyes glinting. Sometimes she almost looks like she is waking up, and I think maybe she can see me, but I know that she's really looking inward. Her fingers twitch, and sometimes she talks... but not now. Just the occasional bubble of sound.  I haven't called my mom or dad yet. For one thing, it's 2:45ish in the morning. For another, it would be rotten for them to be stewing in isolation. It's bad enough that we don't know what's going on, but we are at least here and with each other (and Tom's parents and siblings as well). I figure I can probly call my dad around 4-5a, and my mom around 6:30-7a, if They've Found Something, and Adia does not need me.
