      Today we took Pastor Dan and Shelley out on a staff trip to the Oakwood Inn in Syracuse. We took a boat ride and then enjoyed dinner at the Oakwood Inn restaurant.  It was a good time.  Tonight's softball game was a winner for us, too!  I want to show off some pictures tonight - to please the reading audience!     we fooled Pastor Dan and Shelley into thinking that our "staff outing" was for lunch at Long John Silver's - their only hope on this last Mother's Day for a place to eat!    Steve & Rita Zerbe    Pastor Sue Wagoner    Pastor Wanda Carter    Jill Cook    Pastor Dan and Shelley Berry    The Newlyweds    Chris Atkins    "THE BURGER" - a full pound of beef and the promise of taking 50% off of the cost if I could finish. (Chris and I took the challenge!)    Eating because we would get 50% off of our bill!    Done.

           Tonight I sat and watched a new DVD that I purchased a few weeks ago.  It's called  urlLink RoadTrip NATION  . It's a documentary by some collegiates that traveled the United States in search of some of the biggest corporate leaders and get their advice on "how to make it in life".  It's definitely not a "God-centered" DVD, but it does offer some amazing advice from some of today's top executives. On this first DVD, Howard Schultz - the founder and chairman of Starbucks, Michael Dell - CEO of Dell Computers, and Kevin Carroll - a Nike exec, were the best interviews.  Jess is at Bible study tonight and I'm home holding down the fort. Wouldn't it be nice of me to do all of the dishes before she gets home?  Consider them done.

      It's so good to have a church family.  Today's morning worship service was just that - morning Worship!  God showed up, we gave him the floor, and he took control of our service. I love it when we have to "change the line-up" because God is moving.  After a late-nite last night, it was good to have an energetic service.  We saw Sherilyn off after lunch at Bob Evans and then Jess and I headed to our churchwide picnic and community-wide "singspiration". (A yearly WWC tradition!)  Well, the pictures will speak for themselves, but I must say that if Mom enjoyed yesterday's pictures, she will REALLY enjoy today's pictures!  It was a great afternoon of fellowship with the greatest church family!  By the way, Meagan is Pastor Wanda's granddaughter. She's three ("tree").      "Megs" as I call her.    Sure it's a fake-sleep, but still it's cute, right?    buddies.    Folks, this is my buddy John Bryan busting up with some freestyle breakdancing!    Chris and Jess leading worship after our church-picnic.    Beautiful.    Beautiful Times Two.

      Staying in bed until after 10AM should be a crime in all 50-states!  After an extremely late sleep-in this morning (of course we stayed up until the wee-hours with Sherilyn coming to town), Jess made us all breakfast (French Toast or "Freedom Toast" for those of you who are still upset for France not supporting the USA lately!)  It's good to be here back home tonight - it was a long day at the PLMF, again. Met some more bands - in particular, " urlLink Seventh Day Slumber " - some incredible guys with an awesome testimony. John Bryan and I got up enough nerve to walk to their trailer and chat with them after everything was finished tonight. We got to go inside their trailer and chat a bit with the guys before they headed off to who-knows where!  This weekend was great for  urlLink theBOX  - we had a great time hanging with the teens and hearing some amazing bands together, as a group.  I got the  urlLink Jaded Thorns  CD tonight from my new friend, Jason - their drummer. He's personal friends with Jake Burns and Trevor Kaufman of  urlLink enemyopposition.com  fame!  Jess, Sherilyn, and I all rode the "Titanic Slide" tonight at the PLMF - a couple of my teens also enjoyed the ride on a hot-air balloon!  What a day.  Enjoy the pictures!      Jess rockin' the Titanic Slide   Who needs television commercial advertisement?!   Sherilyn - my beautiful sister is with us and I gave her some frisbee lessons today.   I'm telling these two children just how scared I was to ride the slide - they laughed.

      Okay, today I had an absolute blast!  I got to be the emcee today for almost 6 hours - intro-ing the following bands: Godsound, Walking Limbs, Fiti Futuristic, Divine Nature, Seventh Time Down, Augustine's Garden, Poor Man's Riches, The Dig Project, and Last Tuesday.  I also had the privelege of getting to know the members of each of these bands and picking up a few new albums.  After my stent as the Emcee, I sat around and enjoyed some other amazing bands!  And most importantly, I FINALLY got to see my favorite hip hop group of ALL TIME - LA SYMPHONY.  Folks, they're even more incredible on stage than on my iPod or in my car!  AND, again MORE IMPORTANTLY, the guys are incredible - I got to chat with each of them after the show and picked up Sharlock Poems solo album, too!  It was just fun.  The pictures prove that.  (Pictures of the wedding are still being sorted through and we're picking which ones to get on CDROM, too!)  (have patience, have patience, don't be in such a hurry, if you get impatient, you'll only start to worry, remember, remember, that God is patient too, so think of all the times when others have to wait on you.)

      Have you ever been to Wal-Mart after all of the "normal" people have gone to bed or are atleast home watching late night television.  It's definitely creepy.  After a long morning of STUFF (went to the office for 3 hours on my day off), built our new microwave cart, and ate a sandwich, Jess and I headed to the Freeman's home for about 6 hours of hanging out with two of my teens.  It's amazing that I get to be involved in the lives of some pretty cool teenagers.  After our in-house visit, we still had our shopping list to fulfill. Off to Wally's World.  Of course I grabbed a cart that needed to be put down like a broken race horse.  And of course the isles are FULL of boxes and stockboys running up and own isles trying to get things in their rightful places.  It was just plain annoying.  We got our things and came home. I have resisted the temptation of wanting to put together the two-more Rubermaid storage compartments that we purchased (thanks for our giftcards, folks!) and decided only to place our microwave onto  urlLink its new home .  Busy day tomorrow. (Pro-Life Music Festival and stuff.)  And for those of you who are against the new blue site: goodness gracious - send me links of sites you DO like!

      Apparently, I missed an incredible magic show on NBC tonight -  urlLink T.H.E.M.  (Totally Hidden Extreme Magic) was on tonight at 8PM (we were still at theBOX at 8PM)  I think the Warren's taped it, so that could be a very good thing. Did anyone see it?  Chris Atkins - our intern - told me about the show. I've watched very little television since being married - Jess and I haven't even set up our new DVD player yet!  theBOX tonight was fun. We finally had live worship with CJ on drums, Chris on guitar and vocals, Jess on vocals, and Jeremy on the tamborine! Good times, of course!  I spoke about taking a "Sabbath" each week - even if we can't take our Sunday and set it aside to be still, relax, and take a break, we still need some time each week to relax and listen for God.  The Father of the Universe did this on the 7th day and yet we say we're too busy to pause our busy schedule and spend some alone time with Him?!  We're idiots.  Showed a Rob Bell  urlLink NOOMA  after my "sermonette", called "NOISE".  Tomorrow begins the opening night of the  urlLink Pro-Life Music Festival . I will be there to enjoy the sounds of the  urlLink Rock N Roll Worship Circus !  Lots of clickable links in this post.  Also, added some color to stevansheets.com - mainly because of Brandon's complaining comments down on the first NEW stevansheets.com post!

      Ladies and gentlemen, yours truly had a huge deep-center hit this evening which got him to second base AND landed the three guys already loading the bases home!  Let's not talk about the guy that ran from first to home getting home and me only getting to second...  We won tonight - 18 to 8. It was a fabulous game. When's the last time you used the word "fabulous"?  Tomorrow night one of our teens is making us dinner. We're bringing dessert and will enjoy a good time after theBOX.  I began work on the NEW  urlLink theboxonline.com  website tonight. It should be finished either tomorrow or the beginning of next week.  Thursday will be a busy day off. I hope to begin working on the storage sheds that my landlord will be dropping off sometime. On Friday I'll be the Emcee at the  urlLink Pro-Life Music Festival  here in Warsaw at the CCAC (where we play softball!) I'll be on stage off and on from 10AM until 3PM! An incredible opportunity to be Stevan in front of a large group of people!  Later on Friday, I'll get to see one of my favorite bands -  urlLink L.A. Symphony !  Sherilyn arrives sometime Friday evening and will be with us until Sunday after church!

      Had a busy Monday.  Lots going on in the office today. Pastor Steve took Chris and I to lunch this afternoon, always a nice treat!  After work, I came home to enjoy a wonderful dinner cooked by my wife. (still an amazing thing to be able to say!)  As soon as I was done eating dinner I headed to the nextdoor apartment to finish my painting project. 5 hours later, I think I'm done with the project - I'm waiting on my landlord's approval.  Have I mentioned that we got some pretty stinking cool gifts for our wedding?!  Apparently we have about 330 "thank-you's" to write!     Thank you to the McGough family for my saw!

      Well, today was Father's Day.  Our church gave a copy of  urlLink this book  to every father.  We have a giving church.  Called Dad today and wished him a happy Mother's Day. That's just how twisted I am.  Had a good conversation with my parents this afternoon. They're some of the neatest people I know.  I played "sound man" tonight at church. It's always fun to be in the sound booth pushing buttons and sliding sliders. I do good at sound-stuff, I think.  Tomorrow it's back to the office. Pastor Steve is back, so I'm sure we'll do some "catching up" during our usual weekly Monday lunch meetings.  After work I have to come home and paint for a bunch of hours. I like to paint. I can't remember if I told the listening audience that I've been hired to paint the next door apartments AND put up a small shed in the back of each one.  Good times.  Oh, before I finish tonight's post - you've gotta see this - file  urlLink this one  under "ironic"!

      Today was gorgeous.  Gorgeous  is a funny-looking word.  I spent my morning (actually much of the day) painting! I've been hired by my wonderful landlord to paint the adjoining apartment and the one next to it while they're seeking new tenants. Pretty cool deal - I paint, he pays!  This evening Jess and I headed out and picked up Chris Atkins - our church's 6-month intern. He's a good guy. He's from Canada, though.  We headed to a Music Festival at Center Lake that was being held this evening. Good times.  FFH was the headlining band, and Tiffany Polson opened, as did Down Here. It was a great evening.  The Warrens joined us later in the evening for some good music and fellowship (and lots of Frisbee)  Of course I took some pictures...      FFH Rocking Out Center Lake in Warsaw, IN      My adopted brother, Josh.      The adopted intern, Chris Atkins.      Chris is living with the Warrens during his stay in Indiana. He and Josh have bonded already!

      So, the new stevansheets.com is a blogger. I've "down-sized" the typical stevansheets.com to an out-and-out blogger.com site. This site can be reached by visiting stevan.blogger.com and also still here at stevansheets.com  I've done this for two reasons:  1. I've noticed that a married man has less time to his name than a bachelor with a fiance. 2. It's easier to log in to my blogger account and do a quick update without the hassle of pulling "the old" stevansheets.com up and editing the page that holds each day's update.  I will continue to build upon this site, adding pictures and other tidbits, but for now this site is as basic as they get. I will, of course, be adding pictures - probably not daily, but I will continue to add some "spice" to the otherwise "spice-less" web-log.  Thank you for understanding - I am excited to see what each of you has to say about the new change. I hope the change catches you by a "pleasant surprise".

      Good day today. Woke up and Jess and I hit the road to Fairmount with Jeremy, Erin, Calah, and Hannah.         Conference went well. Our youth group nominated Jeremy for the Male Teen Representative, but he only got 6 votes (from us!)  Rob Tippey, Jeff Leudtke, and Josh Koontz did a great job of running things today. We were in and out of there in under two hours!       After conference we stopped at Applebee's for lunch and then hit the road back to Warsaw. On the way DOWN to Fairmount, we passed the "Jalapa Baptist Church" and I was almost positive I read their church-sign the right way and couldn't believe it.  On the way back to Warsaw, I pulled over and took a picture of the sign that I DID read correctly.  This will make you laugh:      DON'T LET WORRIES KILL YOU, LET THE CHURCH HELP

      As an Assistant Pastor at Warsaw Wesleyan Church, I answer to the Indiana North District of the Wesleyan Church - one of the largest districts in the denomination. Today was our annual District Conference - a meeting of all Pastors and delegates from each congregation depending on size.  Votes were cast to accept those of us pending ordination, a renewal call to our District Superintendant, and changes in our "standing rules" in our Conference handbook.  Along the way were some entertaining moments as well - like the part where someone voted for "Jerry Springer" and his name was read out-loud to get all of the younger-than-thirty pastors laughing.  Funny moment #2 - the part where at least three other youth pastors tried to make my phone ring out loud to get me "in trouble" with those seated around me. Nice try, boys - try the VIBRATE feature on your phones next time and you can be just as cool as me! (I terrorized atleast 5 youth pastors at last year's Christmas banquet!)  Funny moment #3 - when their attempts to "ring" my phone failed, they resorted to NEW ideas - like writing "STEVAN SHEETS" on a ballot for some "no-one-wants-it" position of leadership on the district. Thankfully all that happened was my name was read and the number "four" after it and it was dismissed. They're just happy to see me squirm.  After conference, it was off to Fairmount camp with a 10x14-foot projection screen and began set-up for tonight's BIG SUMMER RALLY. I headed back to Warsaw just before nine and am ready to settle in to bed now.  Tomorrow we'll get up and do it all over again.   :::OFFICIAL INVITATION:::  Anyone who may be interested in seeing Stevan Paul Sheets ordained next Sunday afternoon (August 8th) is MORE THAN welcome to come and sweat with me at the Fairmount Campgrounds at 2:30 for the Indiana North Wesleyan District Ordination ceremony. I, and 4 others will become ordained Wesleyan ministers - and hopefully get a free sword or something ninja-like!  :::END OFFICIAL INVITATION:::

      Today, I met up with Jeremy and CJ at Taco Bell after Jess and I stopped over at Pier 1 to pick up our new throw-pillows!  Lunch with the boys and then about 3-and-a-half-hours of playing "Golf" on an ancient Nintento 64!  Why is it that the "classic" games are usually more fun?!      CJ, Me, Jeremy - Golf Pros    Jess and I are sitting here watching the Iron Chef on the Food Network (it comes in fuzzy, but it it's free!) Right now they're using Quail as the main ingredient. Watching some Japanese guys fry up quail-heads is pretty interesting.  Finished up our Vacation Bible School tonight. The girls raised almost $90 more than the boys, so yours truly got a pie in the face by his lovely wife this evening.  So not fair.  Again, I love my job. (Picture hopefully available soon.)  I'm off tomorrow morning at 6AM. Tomorrow is "District Conference" and as a minister, I am obligated to attend. It's usually something that is more boring than interesting - and something that could probaby be done in about 2 hours instead of taking all day long. That's just the way things work, I guess. It'll be good to connect with some of my Pastor-friends, though.  Tomorrow night is a big Youth Rally at Fairmount, too - I'll be going to that too, and then come home late tomorrow night and head right BACK to Fairmount with four of our teens and my wife for the District YOUTH Conference on Saturday morning.  Conference this weekend, Ordination NEXT weekend, and Jaymie and Rich's wedding in TWO weeks. August is crazy.  One more thing - my online store, CAFEPRESS.com removed my "FREE MARTHA" t-shirts saying that I was infringing on copyrighted materials... Interesting, huh?

      Hello folks. I'm updating early again tonight. Again, I'm in my office - getting ready for God's Zooriffic Adventure. I have to change into my "Zoo Keeper" outfit and get crazy here in a few minutes.  I DID get a chance to build the stevansheets.com forum this evening.   urlLink Here .  We'll see how that works for a few days to see if it's worth keeping around.  If it does get used, look for a link on the right-hand menu sometime soon. Also - I AM working on some image galleries like the "old" stevansheets.com had. Look for those soon and very soon.  A good day in the office today. Jess and I were given a new (to us) couch and loveseat by one of the Sunday School classes here at Warsaw Wesleyan. They were delivered today and we said goodbye to "ol burlap" - our plywood-reinforced couch and loveseat.  We're moving up in the world - our new couch even has a fold-out bed! Come stay with us! (not all of you at once, though!)

Average daily visitors for stevansheets.com: 98  What have I done?  Are my web statistics correct? (We'll find out tomorrow)  I am sad.  Only two comments to yesterday's post.  Only three from the day before.  This is starting to make the stevansheets.com staff very nervous.  Especially on the day that Stevan and Co. spent a couple of hours working on adding some more dynamic content - like a new message board and a whole new slew of image galleries.  I think I'll leave my laptop here at the church tonight instead of taking it home.  If you're all taking a break from computer time, I think I will too.

      Fished for a bunch of hours this morning - good times. Thanks to the Bracketts for the use of their pond. Total catch: Sunfish(1), Crappy(1), Turtle(2).  Jess made an amazing birthday dinner tonight - homemade spaghetti and meatballs. Dessert: chocolate-covered strawberries and bananas.  Afterwards we watched Chicken Run (it was on television). Then we watched Along Come Polly (rented it, glad we did - did some fast-forwarding).  Big day tomorrow. (I say that a lot, don't I?)  I want to leave tonight with twenty-five of the things I've learned in these, my first twenty-five years on this beautiful planet:  01. God is God and He DOES have the whole world in His hands! 02. Love is a real thing. 03. A loving family makes a HUGE difference. 04. Going over 100 MPH in a Plymouth Neon is a scary thing. 05. Marrying your best friend (opposite sex) is the greatest thing you can do! 06. A Q-Tip CAN fit inside your nasal cavity. 07. Wireless internet is definitely the best invention yet. 08. Local church ministry is rewarding. 09. Local church ministry is draining. 10. Teenagers will actually listen to what you have to say. 11. Teenagers will actually NOT listen to what you have to say. 12. Eating carrots will NOT allow you to throw away your glasses. 13. Most vegetables ARE good for you, but still taste terrible. 14. Asking for directions WILL NOT kill, mame, or even damage you. 15. Pushing yourself past your "normal" limits WILL in fact build character. 16. Eating spinach DOES put hair on your chest. 17. Opening jars for your wife makes you look stronger than you really are! 18. Paying your income tax is important. 19. Learning how to ice skate is NOT feminine. 20. Bob Barker is not a human being. 21. Killing spiders does NOT need to be the guy's job. 22. Driving on the right-hand-side of the road is ALWAYS a good idea in the U.S. 23. Caring about ANY job you have and working like you care will be fruitful. 24. Spitting back at a llama does NOT impress the owner of the llama. 25. Telling kids that red is blue and yellow is orange is still the greatest idea I've ever had.  And that folks, is what I've learned thus far!  I hope YOUR 25th birthday is/was as good as mine has been!

      After a full day in the office, I came home to dinner ready to place on the table. My wife is incredible!  After dinner (and doing the dishes), I ran outside to try  urlLink my new birthday present .  I bought it on Wednesday thinking that surely I deserved another cheap imitation RC plane for my birthday this year.  Here's the one I bought:      Not worth the $49, definitely.  Actually, the plane flew really well - it took off right out of my hand and flew to the left as it's designed to do. Unfortunately, the controller wouldn't make it turn back to the right.  I lost sight of the plane about 10 seconds after I let go of it.  The sound of "BANG" soon followed and I ran to see the fate of my new toy.  Sad.  God bless the folks at Wal-Mart who believe that I am not just an idiot and actually believe that something wrong happened to the plane. They took it back without question.  So, instead of investing in yet ANOTHER crappy plane, I focused my attention on the sporting goods department.  $20 later, I am the proud owner of a new SHIMANO R-2000 rod and reel. These will be used tomorrow morning over at Brackett Pond! I'm looking forward to relaxing at the pond on the day of my birth!  25 tomorrow. That's pretty cool.

      It was great to be in Indy today.  Jess and I slept great at HOTEL PENCE last night and woke up lazily this morning and headed to Wesleyan Headquarters for a full-fledged "tour de Wesleyan" with Kory. It was great. The building is amazing, the people are all still nice, and the archives department rocked my world!  Thankfully, Bill Clark (the Archives guy) is one of my buddies - he even pulled up some ancient images of 'ol Uncle H.K. Sheets for me to show Jess that I really have a rich Wesleyan heritage.  I think I'm going to look JUST like H.K. when I'm older! :)   After our tour with my brother Kory:        Jess and I spent some time browsing through the Castleton Mall. I purchased some great things: a new shirt and tie for my ordination ceremony that's coming up and that all faithful stevansheets.com visitors are welcome to attend (details soon), and a new toy for my office - a flying Superman Action figure that is attached to the ceiling and flys around attached to a string. Come and see the action figure when you have a chance!  After mall-browsing, it was off to the Universal Artist's theater to see I, Robot. Kory met us there and we all thoroughly enjoyed the music (though I'm sure  urlLink Kory  will have his own set of comments on the movie.)  After the movie, it was off to the Cheesecake Factory.  Yum.      Jess and Stevan study the cheesecake options. Stevan goes with plain with cherries, Jess goes with Oreo Chocolate Mudslide. Delicious.    While we were waiting for our turn to sit in the wonderful Cheesecake Factory, we decided to browse yet another Indianapolis Mall - this one was the Keystone Mall (the Cheesecake Factory is attached). As we browsed, I found a store: Brookstone, that had something VERY interesting.  It was a Segway Personal Transport Vehicle. Yes, the real deal!  So, I played anxious and asked what it would take to take a "test drive". I quickly learned that all I would have to do was sign a waiver (never read it) and wear a dorky-looking helmet. I was in for a treat!  I signed the waiver, placed the helmet on my head and learned the fine art of riding a Segway. I actually was dismissed from the Supper table to do this, by the way!  It was an incredible experience - one I wish you all could enjoy - and one I wish you all could have shared with me. I asked the guy trying to sell me the thing (only $4,499) if he would take a picture of me looking rediculous and he abliged!      I was a first-time-PRO! I went around the island a few times and even went backwards and just spiraled. You've GOT to try one of  urlLink these !    So, it was an incredibly great day off for Jess and me. Thank you, Kory for making it a blast!

      So, today was a weird day. I woke up this morning with the symptoms of a migraine without the extensive head-pounding usually associated with a Stevan-migraine!  So, I got up out of bed, fell back down, and decided to be a man and get up anyways. In the shower, I had to hold onto the walls just to stay vertical.  After the shower and realizing that I really couldn't drive under this condition, I asked Jess to call the church and tell them that I was not going to be in this morning.  I hit the couch and covered my body with a blanket and my face with its own blanket. I slept soundly for two and a half hours.  I woke up sometime after 11 and decided, once again, to be a man and hit the road.  I worked under the weirdest conditions today. My vision was blurred and I was dizzy the entire day!  I went to Wal-Mart and checked my blood pressure - everything was okay. So, I'm guessing that my blood sugar was out of whack. I decided this because I ate some M&Ms and drank Mountain Dew and began to feel better!  This evening Jess and I drove down here to Indianapolis to visit my brother,  urlLink Kory Pence . We drove for the last hour or so through a pretty intense thunderstorm. Thankfully Jess was driving and I was putting on the "let's stay calm" bit to keep things under control. She was great.  When we arrived to the wonderful Indianapolis, and to the home of the Pence's, we realized that we forgot to bring the bag of clothes. We'll leave it up for discussion WHO forgot to grab the bag of clothes on the way out, but still - we had no clothes. We DID have our two shirts that we had hanging in the car, but no pants, bed-time clothes, or pants, socks, or underwear!  So, off to Wal-Mart for the second time today. Different town, same store.  Did you know that a guy can buy a complete outfit at Wal-Mart for under $20 (jeans, 3-pair of boxers, 3 t-shirts, 6-pair of sox), but a girl can't for under $35 (jeans, shirt, underwear).  There's a problem there, folks. A REAL problem.  Who would have thought!  Oh well.  Long post tonight - sorry - I'm enjoying the wireless internet available here in the Pence-home!  Tomorrow: sleep in, headquarters tour, dinner with Kory, drive back to Warsaw!  It will be a good day. (as long as I'm not dizzy!)  I leave you with this link:  urlLink Internet Archive: Wayback Machine

       urlLink SANCTUS REAL  rocks!  Wow. What a show! Visit their site to listen to the album! Tonight was a great concert at the fairgrounds. Ekklesia opened for Sanctus Real and they played very well, too!  Myself and two of my teens handed out over 200 flyers promoting the concert for about two hoursr before hand and all together, I think we had about 300 show up for the show.  After the concert I had a chance to meet the bass player and drummer for a bit and thank them for their ministry. My only regret is that I didn't advertise to enough people about this incredible band.  If you haven't heard of them yet, you will soon.  Jess and I hit up the local Arby's after our evening at the fair tonight. I could eat cheese-sticks until I get sick!  Before bed tonight I'm watching some EXTREME DODGEBALL on the Game Show Network (definitely the greatest channel on basic cable).  I want to play dodgeball now.

      Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, it is possible that I have found the neatest album ever!  No, it's not the new PETRA album.  It's called " urlLink Hidden Beach Recordings presents: UNWRAPPED, vol. 3 "  Sure it's a long title, but it's worth it! :)  It's some of the latest Hip Hop / Rap songs done in Jazz style.  If you have any interest at all, you've just gotta check it out!  Jess and I had a good time taking Pastor Scott, Chris, and Benjamin back to the airport this morning. It was a good chance to meet with them on a more personal level. I'm looking forward to seeing how God works through this situation!  Tomorrow is a big day at work. In the afternoon it's off to the fair and then emcee the Sanctus Real concert. Looking forward to it! urlLink

      Great day today. . . Pastor Scott preached an awesome message about taking a stand as a Christian - we will be voting as a church next Sunday morning to extend a call to Pastor Scott and Chris to come and be our new Pastor! &nbsp; It's amazing to see how God is moving! &nbsp; For lunch today we met Craig and Lindsay, Chris Atkins, and Pastor Steve &amp; Rita for lunch at the Boathouse. It was good to hang with that group. &nbsp; This afternoon was nap-time. I tried to NOT take a nap, but before I knew it I had lost consciousness and fell fast asleep on our wonderful couch. &nbsp; Service tonight was great, too - Pastor Scott and Chris led worship and they opened it up for a time of Questions and Answers. Some great questions were asked and some awesome answers were given. Pastor Scott was extremely transparent and honest. It was a good time. &nbsp; Tomorrow morning Jess and I will drive Pastor Scott, Chris, and their son Ben to the airport in South Bend.  Sanctus Real concert on Tuesday - 6PM fairgrounds grandstand! (I'm intro-ing the band!)

      Do you know how much fun fishing really is? I mean, honestly, fishing is one of the greatest feelings in the world! &nbsp; Sitting in a boat or standing on the edge of ANY body of water (hopefully with the promise of fish being actually IN that body of water), holding a rod and a reel, throwing out some artificial lure and reeling to your hearts desire. That's what brings this nearly 25-year-old extreme enjoyment. &nbsp; Sure, it's about 7,000 times better when you actually catch a fish. Tonight, I only caught one small bass, but that was SO worth it! &nbsp; I'm telling you - if you've got stress in your life. If you've got lots going on, or if you are just looking for something new to try, go fishing! &nbsp; Today I played on the internet for four hours. Okay, that's not exactly true - I worked on some Underfire Solutions projects for more than four hours and then took a two-hour nap! It was great! I was so beat from sitting in front of my laptop all morning that I needed a nap! How weird. I think it helped that it was overcast and rainy most of the day. &nbsp; After my nap,&nbsp;I met the staff and LBA over at the Brackett's for dinner with our Pastoral Candidate - Pastor Scott Thompson, his wife Chris, and their son, Ben. We had a great time - Tom Brackett cooked some amazing ribs and barbeque. After dinner, the board met with Pastor Scott and Chris, so Jeremy Freeman and I took our new friend Ben out on the pond for a little fishing. Jeremy and I only caught one fish a piece, but Ben ended up with three nice ones! &nbsp; It was a good time.  After fishing and visiting, Jess and I headed over to Courthouse coffee to meet Jeremy and Liz for a little relaxation at the coffeehouse. After about a dozen card games we're home and ready to hit the hay.  Big day tomorrow. Have a great Sabbath!

      Finally, they sentenced to Ms. Stewart to 5-months in some prison.  &nbsp;  In honor of this occassion, stevansheets.com is offering this new t-shirt design for this next week (or until I sell a couple!)    urlLink     buy one or a hundred! (only $9.99)  That's the Martha Stewart update.   How sad.   In other news, I'm sitting here watching an Alanis Morissette concert on PBS. What else is PBS good for? Not much, but occasionally they have some random concert on and I catch just a glimpse. I suggest updating your website with Alanis in the background singing about just how bad her life has been.

      The sun was out today.   Thanks for the comments on yesterday's post, folks - uhm, I'm not exactly sure why I first put that Bayh was a Republican - it's Lugar that's a Republican and that great fella' ALSO voted against the amendment. Great state, huh?!   Anyways.   The sun was out today during my "let's build another shed" expedition. The shed went up in just under 8-hours. Today was EXTREMELY windy, so Jess spent more time than we had planned outside helping me. Not long enough to look like this, though.      size of muscle NOT to scale - in real life, it's MUCH bigger, folks!   Being the smart college-grad that I am, I decided to go sleeveless during today's shed-building festivities.   That wasn't the smartest thing that stevansheets.com has done. I will sleep in pain tonight.

      What a weird label for a button on the keyboard - "Num Lock".   Anyways, it's a good button.   Busy day today - started this morning by leaving the house at about 6:45AM and didn't get back to Apartment 20 until about 8:45PM - that's quite the day if you ask me.   It's good to get home and relax. I'll need some relaxing tonight before my full-day of shed-building tomorrow.   I ran over and met the new neighbors tonight - the one's whose shed I will be putting up. Lo and behold when I got there, Sam, the son of Jill Cook - our PreSchool and Daycare director - was there hanging out with them! Turns out that Sam's wife is sisters with the female half of the couple living there! (That was weird phraseology, I know)   I think I'll go build a futon now.   But before I do - BOO, BOO, BOO to the Senate of the United States Government - especially you, Senator Bayh (Democrat, Indiana).   You've disappointed a whole slew of Hoosiers and make-shift Hoosiers (like me). Don't get too comfortable at your desk, Senator, I'm thinking there'll be a little problem being re-elected this time.   Telling us that you were FOR the US Marriage Amendment and then voting against it?! That's just plain stupid... And AFTER the voting today, getting an e-mail saying that my previous e-mails WEREN'T read because you don't use that e-mail address.   Here's what I got:    Wednesday, 7/14/04, 8:14PM  FROM: noreply@bayh.senate.gov  TO: pstev@theboxonline.com   Thank you for your recent message. Senator Bayh appreciates yourwillingness to share your views with him. In an effort to more effectively manage the increase in the volume of e-mails received by our office and to respond as quickly and thoroughly as possible, we are using a new web based system that you can access through our web site at  urlLink http://bayh.senate.gov  Just click on "E-mail Senator Bayh" under the contact section of the web site and complete one of our new web forms.

We look forward to hearing from you.   IMPORTANT: Please do not reply to this email. It is an automated service and you will get no response.   Real nice, Senator.   As for all of you other Senators (you who voted AGAINST the Amendment to the constitution, today) who think you know what's best for our Nation... Get a clue.   Nuff said.   Sorry if my "lack of respect" is showing through - I was disgusted today as I watched C-SPAN online.   Don't forget to check out the new  urlLink online store !

      A certain someone in my family finally got her first ticket. This certain someone has prided herself as being ticket-free until this week.  Congratulations, Mom!  We had a sweet thunderstorm tonight. Jess and I stood at the front door and enjoyed it thoroughly.  Had a great softball game tonight, too - we won 10-1, I think.  It's time for bed. Early morning tomorrow - Greater Warsaw Ministerial Association prayer breakfast tomorrow. Thankfully Richards (the restaurant we meet in) has great coffee!  theBOX tomorrow night and then Thursday is "build another shed" day!

      Memories. Tonight, I opened up our new 3-CD set of Agapeland's Music Machine discs!  Incredible memories flooded back to our minds. It was great!  For those of you who've wanted a chance at replacing those worn-out cassette tapes that you had for many, many years - check out Agapeland's website:  urlLink www.agapelandmusic.com   Had a great Sunday. Today was Pastor Dan and Shelley's final service with us. It was a time of reflection and anticipation.  The congregation was given the announcement today that we will have a Pastoral Candidate with us next Sunday morning! I can't wait!  After services and a fairwell dinner banquet, I ran out to help Jeremy (one of my teens) put a CD player in his car, "Gunther". We had no trouble figuring out something that I've only done twice - both times about 4 years ago! It was good to sit in a car and sweat like a pig.  Big day tomorrow - tomorrow is my "official" Spring Cleaning day at the office. I will be throwing away much of the "I've just gotta save this" stuff that doesn't ever get filed - it just ends up in piles to "look at later". It will be a glorious opportunity to somehow bring order to my otherwise order-less office! There may even be some rearranging of furniture included in the festivities!  By the way: stevansheets.com received over 3900 unique hits in the month of June! That means over 130 page views by unique persons each and ever day for an entire month! This is a bit ridiculous - a guy who updates his site once a day and posts things about his own life can have more than a hundred people visiting his site every day!

      So, after a week in beautiful Fairmount, Indiana, we are finally home to super-beautiful Warsaw!  We got into town sometime after 11 this morning and got back to the apartment before 2. Jess took a nap, I read the mail and did some super-human channel-surfing (I believe I actually watched 3 movies!) It was great to take a "real" shower again in a tub with a full-size shower curtain and one in which when the soap has been dropped, you don't almost knock the entire shower stall over with your "bum".  In reading my mail, I came across one of the coolest things: "The Word on The Street" - it's a new paraphrase of the Bible that was written by  urlLink Rob Lacey . It's absolutely magnificent. Pick up a copy when they're "really" available in a couple of months. (being a youth pastor has its perks, believe me!)  Big day tomorrow - Pastor Berry and Shelley's last day with us here in Warsaw. Should be an amazing service and luncheon afterwards.  No evening service tomorrow, so we'll have some time to relax!  Good times tonight over at HOTEL ZERBE. Pastor Steve and Rita asked us over for an evening with their grandson, Brennan and some wonderful burgers, hand-cranked icecream, and great company: Craig & Lindsay Helfrich, Chris Atkins, and Bethany and Thomas. It was a great time - and I think I actually killed over 7,302 mosquitoes. (that is a fictional number)  It's late. I'm ready to sleep. It's been an amazing week. Teenagers made some pretty serious commitments this week - the worship was amazing, and Chip Dykema was a great camp speaker! It was a great camp and I know we'll take an even bigger group next year!

We'll get a call tomorrow with "the problem", hopefully.  We're now sitting in the Tree of Life bookstore in Marion.  I'm sitting next to John Drury - a buddy of mine from college who has been at Princeton Theological Seminary for the last couple of years. I had no idea he was in town!  We're going to be leaving shortly to go and see SpiderMan-2.  It's a good week thus far!

      Hello web-world. On this, the eve of our first day of Sr. High Camp, I received a special package in the mail from my best man, Kory Pence.  This special package contained a CDROM with some of the finest wedding photos we've received thus far!  I give to you (finally) the long-awaited pictures of our wedding!  urlLink Stevan and Jessica - June 5, 2004 .  While we are away at camp this week, I will do my best to update you on the latest happenings via a special blogger-feature called "Audio Blogger" - stay tuned for updates!  We went out tonight for dinner and a movie with a couple in our church. We saw, "Dodgeball", and all I can say about it is that it had its funny parts and its absolutely disgusting parts. We should have gone to see Spider-Man 2 instead.  We will be heading to camp tomorrow immediately following second service. It will be a great week!

      These two pictures tonight speak for themselves.  First: this guy thinks he's innocent.      He sure looks innocent to me!  Second: how about  THIS  waiting for you in your pool?!      I wish I could've been there to see the lady go in the air and land in that pool! (no, I am not being sexist - I heard on the news that it was a lady!)  Quite the day today - spent most of the afternoon printing camp handbooks. At about 5:15, Brandon Schenck called to say that he and Dave Mason and another guy - Will, were in the area and wanted to join me for dinner. They came over to the church, checked out the youth room and we enjoyed an evening meal at El Arriero - the best Mexican food in Warsaw.  I stopped at Blockbuster on the way home and rented THE LAST SAMURAI. Tomorrow we're going with Chris and Craig & Lindsay Helfrich to see Dodgeball!  Oh, one more thing - I caught a lightning bug and smashed it on Jess' arm. The mashed-up guts glowed when we entered our dark apartment! She wasn't really impressed.

      Today is actually Canada Day. Woo Hoo - congratulations to my Canadian brothers and sisters, especially Chris Atkins and Dave Mason.  Not being Canadian, today was "Build a Shed" Day here in Warsaw, Indiana.  Similarly, my parents had their own "Build a Shed" Week - there's is HUGE!     Told you so!   Here in Warsaw, the sheds aren't nearly as fancy, but it was still a good time building! (anytime using a screwdriver, a bunch of nuts and bolts, and the occasional pair of pliers is a good time!)  Here's the time-lapse breakdown:      8:42AM    9:31AM    12:23PM    1:43PM    3:20PM   I didn't completely finish - I had to get a shower and then we spent the evening in Mishawaka, but the doors will be done sometime before the weekend!

      Tonight after Jess and I got back from the church and a good time with the youth group, I was ready to do some work around the house.  It is now after 1:30AM and we are finally planning on going to bed in the next few moments.  When we got home, I got out my cordless drill, some nails, screws, wall-hanging kits, and hammer. For the next 4 hours, Jess approved, and I hung the "home-y" things we had been waiting to get up around the house.  Two new clocks, a mirror, some big metal thing, a shelf, and a cabinet later - we have achieved more of "home-status" in Apartment #20 tonight!  Tomorrow is "build a shed" day (check your wall calendar!)  We're also going up to Mishawaka to a place called " urlLink FunFX " - apparently it's a magic and clown mega-store! We have a clowning-couple in our church: Mike and Pam Dixon, A.K.A. "Merkie & Misfit", who are taking us along with Pastor Dan and Shelley. We'll enjoy that trip!  That trip starts at 4PM, so I've got quite the morning and afternoon of shed-building to contend with!  I think I'll take some time-lapse photos of the shed-building adventure!

      Tonight we ended our softball season a bit early. We lost our 6-o'clock game and didn't have to play anymore afterwards.  It was a good game, some tempers flared, but overall it was a good game.  Looks like because we won overall in our division for the season, we will be bumped up to a higher-league next year. This means we'll be playing on the "real-man's" diamonds and won't have homerun rules. I'm looking forward to what next year brings us.  This was an awesome year of softball. It was by far, WAY more fun than last year!  After the game we enjoyed talking about the season and all gawking over our division champion plaque and trophy. Thankfully, I brought our digital camera and got a couple professional-quality shots of our team:      TOP ROW (l-r):  Ben, Jay, Bud, Tim, Eldon, Roger, Stevan BOTTOM ROW (l-r): Aaron, Tom, Nathaniel, Dan, Chris, Dave      the 'real' team

      I didn't get home this morning until 2:30AM.  That wasn't the plan...  Yesterday I met up with Craig Helfrich, Pastor Steve, and Chris Atkins for a trip to Chicago to experience all that Chicago has to offer. We left Warsaw at 7AM, filled Craig's Durango up with gas and hit the road.       We stopped in the Chesterton/Valpo area at THE CLOCK restaurant for breakfast and continued our trip to Chi-town.       We arrived in Chicago before lunch time and our first stop was  urlLink Willow Creek Community Church .  I have been to Willow Creek only one other time (last year to see Mel Gibson introduce his PASSION movie.) Craig and Chris had never been there before.  We showed Chris and Craig the current sanctuary.      We also showed off the gymnasium, where Craig and Chris posed for this photo:      The new sanctuary is almost finished, but it was completely blocked off except to "authorized personnel", so I "authorized" us and we passed through the blocked-off area.  What we saw next was absolutely incredible.         the new sanctuary will hold 7,200!   After our visit at Willow Creek, it was my turn to drive, so we hit the road again and instantly noticed something wrong with the Durango - it was smelling pretty nasty. As we pulled up to the  urlLink Chicago IKEA  store, we  realized that the engine coolant was no longer in the engine, but in the IKEA parking lot.  Chris and I spent the next two hours roaming the IKEA store, while Steve and Craig worked on getting the car fixed at the local Firestone shop.  Durango Damage: water pump, all hoses, and thermostat!  Pastor Steve made the "executive" decision to rent a car and pick us back up to finish our afternoon in Chicago in style. We headed downtown to  urlLink NIKETOWN  and then headed to the  urlLink Sears Tower  to experience that, too.  Of course I had left my camera in the Durango, so there are no pictures of these experiences. Craig DID take a few with his camera, so those may be available eventually.  After the Sears Tower, we headed back to the Firestone Shop to pick up the Durango and head to dinner and then home.  The Durango was finished on time and I again got to drive the next leg of the trip.  After dinner at Smokey Bones BBQ (amazing!) we headed back towards Warsaw.      As we crossed the border into Indiana from Illinois, the "CHECK GAUGES" light came on the dash in the Durango. I thought it was because we were driving on empty for a few miles, but it was actually the battery that was losing power.  We filled up with gas and got back on the Interstate. After a bunch more miles, the radio stopped working, the power-windows quit, the dash lights eventually dimmed, and all of the gauges turned off as I drove. The final "ouch" was when the headlights completely turned off! I pulled into a gas station off the Interstate in Portage, IN sometime after midnight.       We talked to a police officer and he told us that he couldn't help us more than calling a cab. The cab never showed. Thankfully, another local-gentleman with battery trouble pulled into the same gas station just a short while after we did. He lived just miles away and his wife came and took him and Craig and I to the 24-hour K-Mart where we bought a new battery.  We put the new battery in and were on the road minutes later.  Just as we were coming up on Warsaw, the same "CHECK GAUGES" light came on again as the battery once again dropped below the "normal" levels. We lost our windows, radio, dash lights, and eventually headlights just FEET before pulling into Pastor Steve & Rita's driveway! (talk about God's protection!)  Craig is having the Durango checked this afternoon!  So, it was an amazing adventure! One that goes into all of our "personal history books" for sure.  It's good to be home! Didn't get to bed until after 4!  Tonight - softball season ends. Game at 6. If we win, another at 7. If we win THAT one, the championship game is at 8! I hope I can stay awake!

      So, before bed tonight I wanted to share with the "world" what the actual ordination service was.  Pastor Tom Armiger was the officiating General Superintendant of our district ordination service. There were six of us who were ordained today: Nathan Beals (one of the brothersbyblood!), Brandon Bruce ( urlLink www.brandonjenniferbruce.com ), Jason Denniston ( urlLink www.fairmountwesleyan.org/youth ), Glen Robinson ( urlLink www.thought-spot.blogspot.com ), Me, and John Walton.  The service was great. We "ordinans" were seated up front with our spouses and Dr. Armiger gave the message for the service. He gave us 6 points of "focus" in our ministry days ahead, based on the Luke 10 passage about Martha and Mary.  Here are the stevansheets.com paraphrased points:  001. Focus on the Lord's work in YOU more than "the WORK of the Lord". 002. Focus on your personal knowledge of God more than your PROFESSIONAL knowledge of God. 003. Focus on God's presence, not just your performance. 004. Focus on building character, not career. 005. Focus on being Spirit-directed, not self-directed. 006. Focus on being Godly, rather than striving for greatness.  It was an amazing message - one that will have a lasting impression on this freshly ordained pastor!  Thank you to some VERY special WWC folks who came down to see me "get knighted" as I advertised my ordination as being. You are some very special folk - I will never forget your kindness.  Thank you to my parents and my sister for coming up from YOUR busy schedules for my ordination. Mom and Dad Garrett - thank you, TOO, for coming (and grand-Garretts!), and sister-in-law Jaymie! And to my "adopted" family - Aunt Pam, Josh, and Jenna! Thanks! Thanks, too K-P for dropping in and continuing to build upon our friendship (and for the picture!)  And thanks to my fellow ministers - those of you who went out of your way to say "congratulations" - and "thanks for not doing anything embarrassing!"  Of course, my wife - Jessica. Wow. You're incredible. In many, many ways...  It was an AWESOME day. Well worth putting the suit on and sweating in Fairmount!  God is good - aren't you glad we serve HIM?! I'm so thankful to be serving a God who isn't just some idol up in a temple somewhere for me to bow to and burn some incense (though I think we can learn a lot from those who DO this as a form of worship!)  God, thank YOU for these last 25-years! I will continue to serve You in ANY and EVERY capacity you put me up to! I'm Yours. 110%!

      Folks. I am now a REVEREND. Reverend Stevan Paul Sheets.  That's too weird. Don't worry, I don't think I'll ever use that title (unless I'm being pulled over by a policeman).  Just kidding of course (my Mom would've e-mailed me if I didn't say that I was kidding.)  Anyways, it was an incredible event. No tongues of fire lighting on our heads or anything THAT cool to tell of, but here are a couple pictures. The one of me alone is courtesy of Mr. Kory Pence. ( urlLink korypence.blogspot.com )      Dad, Mom, Jessica, Me, Sherilyn       Went swimming here at Mom and Dad's hotel (Warsaw Hampton). I'm now leeching off of their free wireless internet connection from inside their room! Technology is awesome!  Tomorrow I'm going with "the boys" (Pastor Steve, Craig, and Chris) to Chicago.

      Mom and Dad arrived safely last evening. I headed to the hotel to help them unload and spend some time with them before heading home for bed.       This morning Jess and I met them for breakfast and then spent the entire day with them. It was a great day.  Sherilyn arrived shortly after 10PM tonight - she, too, arrived safe and sound.  It's good to have an awesome family that supports my endeavors.  Tomorrow I am reverend.

      Jess is in Marion until late tonight, so of course I was "on my own" for supper after work tonight.  For some unknown reason, this was the topic of discussion quite a few times before Jess actually left for Marion.  I learned some things tonight while making my dinner.  My dinner tonight consisted of a turkey sandwich. Yes, I know - very difficult.  But what I realized was that in order to make dinner it only takes ONE utensil!  When Jess makes dinner there are atleast 15-minutes of dishes to do afterwards. When I make supper I had an entire KNIFE to wash. (I didn't wash it, but still...)  A knife. That's it.  One knife.  One sandwich, one knife. Wow.  Mom and Dad will be in town any second now. I'm heading to their hotel to go swimming when they DO finally get here!

      This afternoon, Jess and I went Wal-Mart shopping for furniture.  We bought  urlLink this  and a cheap 5-shelf bookcase. I built the storage cabinet before dinner and the bookshelf afterwards. I love building stuff - and Sauder Furniture is almost TOO simple to put together - I need more challenge sometimes! Maybe I'll take apart my car tomorrow and try and put it back together...  Our "guest room" now has some order to it.  My parents are in Berea, KY tonight - on their way here to Warsaw for the weekend. Sherilyn leaves sometime Saturday to arrive here Saturday evening. It's like a miniature family reunion!  Thanks for all of the comments after last-night's post! Don't worry about me doing something too immature at Ordination!

      Great time at theBOX tonight - talked about homosexuality and how we, as Christians, are called to love, but that love doesn't mean to tolerate sin. It was a great interactive time with the teens speaking up about personal experiences.  I DO love my job.  After theBOX we met up with 3 of the teens at McDonalds for some after-hours dinner.  We finally came home and began the usual "too tired to sleep" work-around-the-house Wednesday night routine. I finally built our futon and set that all up. Jess and I are tackling the "other room" tomorrow - we're going to go out and buy a new bookcase or two to help with "getting things put away".  I think it will be a VERY productive day.  Jess had an interview on Monday at Eisenhower - a school just 5 minutes from our house. If she doesn't hear something by Friday, she didn't get the job. Pray!  Dad and Mom arrive on Friday. Jess heads to Bluffton on Friday, too - her sister's bachelor party.  I'm pumped about ordination. I can't think of "what to do", however - give Dr. Bardsley one of my flaming business cards, or hand them my "book of Mormon" instead of my Bible when they use it in the service?  Two options, I'm welcoming any more from the reading-audience.  Is it really 1:11AM?!?!

      Well this morning I had the instant realization just how much I love my job.  Last night, apparently between 1:30 and 2:00AM, 5 of my GIRL teens came to the homestead and sabotaged my car while I slept soundly.  Incredible.  Being girls, they never accounted for certain materials being "abbrasive", so I now have three large spots on my car where there is no longer paint.  Sure I could've been upset - but what would getting upset benefit?!  Mom always said that "one day, I'd get it back"  True.         Softball tournament tonight...  We won game #1 @ 6PM, and won game #2 @ 9PM!  Good for us. Three games next Tuesday if we keep winning!

       urlLink This  happened last night while we were at Pizza Hut with some folks from church! Very sobering.  Jess and I enjoyed dinner at the Warrens tonight and I even got to go on a little car trip with my buddy Josh, too! I took him with me to set up Pastor Sue's television for the ladies Bible study that Jess attends. He and I had some good conversation and played "wave or don't wave" all the way. Final tally: 7 people DID wave (when we honked and waved at them) and 5 people DIDN'T.  It's amazing how much fun that game is by yourself, but when you've added a 3rd grader, the fun just doesn't end.  We also played "guess how long it will take to get home?" - My guess: 8 minutes. His guess: 15 minutes. Actual time: 19 minutes. I lost.  His prize?  Watching me sing the "Itsy Bitsy Spider" (AND do hand-motions) in front of his mom and sister, Elissa.  Humiliated by an eight-year-old...      In other news: My grandmother had a momentous birthday yesterday and my grandparents also celebrated their anniversary yesterday. AND my wonderful parents celebrated 29 years of marriage TODAY.  Leave a comment of congratulations, would ya?!

      Have you watched the new Army commercial - the one for the "Special Forces" that you can oder a free video?  What is it about that commercial that gets my heart pumping? I think every male has, at one time or another, had a fantasy about being a soldier.  Today our channels changed on our basic cable. Apparently our local Insight cable system had been bought by the Comcast Cable Company. With the buy-out, we have lost VH1, but we now have TechTV - WAY better if you ask me!  I've been watching all afternoon and since we got back from church tonight.  I found some of the coolest things since watching TechTV - namely:  urlLink THE RODENATOR .  Christmas is JUST around the corner!  Oh. Before I go for the night, Warsaw Wesleyan Church has a new Pastor and family! Pastor Scott Thompson, his wife Chris, and sons Nathan and Benjamin will be moving to Warsaw in the middle of September!  God is so good!
