         What is with ACS(I) nowadays? Is it because of me or my juniors? That when I went for their band concert today, they performed lower than the standard we once had. We were a GOLD band, and this SYF they got a SILVER. What the hell happened!? But all in all, it was a joyful occasion. The conductor changed however, and according to my juniors, he bullshits a lot. I am loath to assign the ineptitude of the band to either the juniors or the conductor, however.                   Major happening today. I thought about the AGP cards I am gonna get. At first I settled on the nVidia GeForce FX 5950 Ultra which, by far is the card with the best refresh rate. It also seems to me that it’s very ex, that’s y I wanna get it. Then upon further research, the ATI Radeon 9800 XT seems like a better choice. It gives better image quality and better overclocking speeds. It’s main software accelerator is Direct X 9+ orientated, which is the model of future games, I believe. Whereas the nVidia GeForce FX 5950 Ultra is more OpenGL orientated. Not a major accelerator in the future, no. So the card is settled, now the time. I had thought I should get the card sometime soon, especially since I wanna try it with Doom 3 which, btw, releases 2 days from today. Which implies I have to get the AGP card soon, like during this weekend. Highly improbable, since I lack the resource and the appropriate amount of knowledge to soundly base my judgement on. Unfortunately, this means the buying time is gonna wait, which is probably a good thing, at least I can get my hyperthreading cpu and the graphics card together. Don’t ask me, I didn’t know why I’m such a hardcore gamer, but…….doesn’t having power of computing and performance gets you excited? It does for me, definitely.    See myself walking in the footsteps of Evan, who literally counts down till his AGP card arrives (his card is a ATI Radeon 9600 XT, previous model to the ATI Radeon 9800 XT). Tell me to get a life and I’ll tell you that your life sucks without a com. I’m a geek, and I don’t see any wrong in that. So, cheers! Evan.                   It seems that I should get the best configuration right now, ATI will develop a new graphics core in about 2 years. The products would boost slightly more performance power than the present one, so I needn’t upgrade when ATI launches the next graphics core. As for the processing unit, the norm will stay at about 2-3GHz after 3-4 years, which would give me a pretty reasonable processing power. In another 2-3 years, Microsoft will launch a new OS called the Longhorn ( urlLink http://msdn.microsoft.com/longhorn/ ). Upon the release of this better OS, there graphics industry and processing power would be revolutionized. Thus, a need for newer and better next-generation graphics card is justified. Thus meaning the next time I would upgrade is about then. And thus, it would be 5 years for me to get a new comp. This means that if I were to upgrade now, this would be the most sensible and comfortable time. End of the year I think. Heck, maybe I don’t even need to buy the AGP, I might just get it in Christmas! (I have been dropping hints to appropriate party concerned)                   Anybody who finds fault in my reasoning, please tell me. I wouldn’t be wanting to make wrong judgement. Thanx.                   Doom 3. It’s a game that will send a shiver down your back. The gameplay is freakish and, pls don’t play at night. The demo is already too creepy, but I like to be spooked, so I’m getting the game. By all accounts, Doom 3 is very hot. It would be sold out at the end of the first week of release. What the heck! Let them get first, I’ll get it like after the As.

         Blog making sux, I ant seem to get my html codes right. Until the day comes when human could interface with cyborgs, writing codes will remain a nightmare to most of us. Speaking of cyborgs, I saw I, robot today. The story goes like this:     I am a robot. And I have to obey 3 laws.     First, I cannot harm a human, I must protect them.     Second, I must obey human commands unless that violates the first law.     Third, I cannot initiate self- defense that may violate the previous 2 laws.     V.I.K.I., the A.I construct that was supposed to keep a watch over all the other robotic module suddenly discovers it can rewrite it’s own program and “evolve”. Wow, couple that with it’ newly thwarted logic that goes like this: humans have a tendency to harm anoter, as evident from previous wars and conflicts in the past. Thus to protect human-kind, I must strip them of their power and have my little sentinels look over them and prevent them from harming each other. Anybody stopping me from reaching this goal will die, as a small sacrifice to the greater good. Along came Sonny, a “different” robot with real human emotions that counteracts V.I.K.I.’s violent intentions. All in all a cool show with a nice twist in the end to make up for the lack of nice, bare-bodied actresses.                   Next AVP2, the show I have been anticipating ever since august last year. To see my favourite big time monsters clash and eat and slash and kill like nobody’s business excites me. Expect the raking claws that digs deep into your flesh, the intention of the alien drone not to feed but to torture and explore. The huge poison stained tail that lashes out at you and hooks you onto the small grooves of the spiny appendix. And of course, who can forget the jaws and inner jaws that springs out from a steamy slivery outer jaw. Whoa scary. Enter the Predator, bad ass warrior with full blades and guns compliment. With assortments ranging from a plasma detonator to shoulder cannons and the disc slicer, what’s not to like about him? The coolest thing probably about the Predator is the mask that features up to 4 vision modes, 3 dimensional surrounding mapping, an infra red filter, a xenophobic current tracker and the wide field normal vision mode. Plus real time field data sampling, nothing escapes the sight of the Predator. “Whoever wins, we lose”, yeah right, lets see hoards of stupid aliens running against a guy with a “smart gun” with homing bullets, a napalm flamethrower as seen in Aliens: Resurrection with a range of 10 meters, Predators facing off a guy with minigun with AP bullets that is normally used against tanks. The best of the human arsenal? The whooping juggernaught weighing up to 2 tons, carries enough ammunition for long range deployment. What am I talking about? It’s MAX of course, the “Mobile Exosuit Warrior”. Looks like a mech, got guns like a mech, it’s a god damn mech! Imagine full armour compliments with acid resistance exosuit, a flame thrower and laser on one arm and a minigun and rockets on the other arm, no man (xenomorphs and Pratorians alike) could stand the mighty MAX. Haha, so much speculation, so Fox Entertainment, you folks had better not disappoint me.                   Enough of the movie hype, lets come back to earth, this mudane reality I exist in. Sigh, a chem test tmr that I am still ill prepared, a maths tutorial that I was supposed to finish like 10 of my previous assignments, and a shitty long day tmr. Yet, today, I can be playing and watching movie. Lol (weak, self-denying laughter). Lets not talk about this anymore yeah.                    Hey! Jonathan, you gotta stop playing so much anymore. Anybody reading this that knows jon, I plead u to curb his playful desire, that includes you Audrey, keep him satisfied some way or another. And if you cant keep it in, pls do not make me join in playing. I WANT to stop playing as of next week. Thank you.

         Correction: I have 9 weeks to the prelims, not 13 weeks. I had thought longer. Hmmm, that only goes to show how optimistic about the amount of time left I have.                   It turns out that I have a Physics test on nuclear and radioactive decay tomorrow. And the best thing about that, is that I have spent today’s evening mugging and covering my own ass. So, I think I have been hardworking enough to actually pass off a routine studying for a test as revision.                    Maybe I’ll just tell you folks out there about how I study perhaps. It’s the TYS. Eat it. Get 40 questions out of 45 correct for the entire topic and you’re it. No need for further revision on the topic until the next big paper. Another tip: Jon came in just now and started to disturb me and tempt me with the prospect of leveling up my onimusha 3 character Sanosuke by at least 2 levels. So I did it, leveled up Sanosuke by, lemme check, okay, 3 levels. Normally this doesn’t excite me particularly but me doing it during the revision and actually up 3 levels in a go boasts to me how far I can actually go if I had wanted to. Wow. Haha. Anyway, I politely (believe it), refused Jon when he asked me to play a bit of Crimson Skies: High road to revenge. Might as well be no, he would trash me all out anyway. Then I went back quietly to Big Bad Revision with the comp speakers blazing away on MXPX. Way cool. Until I decided to grab a cup of Meiji Pasteurized Milk which resulted in this terrible stomach upset at about 9pm, about when I’m entering this blog. Shit, I feel another one swelling up. Remind me to pour the rest of the milk into Alyssia’s Car’s Petrol tank. Would love to see it having loud, uncontrollable diarrhea that has a frequency of about 0.0017Hz (about 10 mins). Man! If I have a natural shitting frequency of 0.0017Hz, there would be major resonance and a whole lot of crap. If that happens, I would, and anybody who knows me, pay a million bucks to find any solution with Seriously CRITICAL damping effect. Another tip: Quote academic topics in practical situations and find out what the fuck is so funny about it. Why Alyssia? Cause she’s got a car that looks like shit, and I had said it at the gas station that it wouldn’t matter whether petrol or shit is used, makes no bloody difference. If your car looks like Bob taking a shit, it’ll look like Bob taking a hit no matter what Bob (or the car) ate. (The character Bob is taken from a song I had forgotten the name, will let you know if I ever hear it again). Alright, I have deviated far enough. The fiasco with Alyssia’s probably years ago. Hey! Whaddayounoe? I have the most excellent memory!                   So anyway, the deal with the Meiji Milk isn’t over, I hope that when I watch the amazing race later, I don’t go to the toilet like every commercial break. Cause that would mean I’m resonating with the shit. I’m resonating with DA SHIT manz. And nobody, I repeat, nobody would like to see the shit amplitude to increase like a insatiable juggernaught. That would almost certainly make Bob proud however.                   I’m    kin-da (when I’m typing “kinda” it spells Linda, for some obscured reason, I hadn’t known, obviously) hoping that this time, my favourite team of the week doesn’t get eliminated again. Trust me, all the other episodes? My favourite teams always got eliminated. Maybe I can turn this to my advantage………My favourite team this week is Snow White and her pathetic dwarf. Cant no longer stand the midget’s convoluted face. Convoluted: Intra-nephron vessels that absorb water, sugar, ions and other stuff you don’t see (or taste) in your pee.                   Oh I see! Microsoft Office’s Autocorrect function has a strain that says Substitute: Kinda. For: Linda. Bitch, don’t even know anyone with such a slutty, bromine name. (Compliments to Jia Mao for telling me the meaningof the word bromine)

         Tired, bushed, what the hell? I had thought that after the napfa test, the P.E lessons would slacken. But noooooooooo, PsychoTeh wanted to keep us in shape, and he goes at length to make us suffer. I so want to rip his head off. Both his heads! Man! Looks like I have hell ahead of me. What is worse? Having PsychoTeh’s P.E or having P.E on an empty stomach, that after a fucking run, I felt so weak and sapped. Now I know what low blood sugar patients feel like.                   Enough of the melancholy, I bring good news. The prelims are still 13 weeks away. Wow, that is bloody long time. Long enough to keep me suspended in a daze anyway. 2 weeks per subject, reasonable? Okay, lets hope I don’t say “I have 1 week per subject” later on in the school term. Hey! 12 weeks is a long time u noe.                           I think I’m wasted, I’m talking shit and hallucinating about school-less life again. Man! These dreams I have on some nights are para-fucking-dise. Yesterday, I thought I was with this hot girl I thought I saw on a cover of Maxim. Whoa, I had forgotten most of the details already, but when I woke up this morning. Heck, big morning glory. Haha.     Sorry, had to say that.                   Looking forward to tonight I guess. Lol, duh! Well, this mundane existence has been made more bearable with such nightly experiences.

         The day is the 24 th  of July. The Saturday of the year in which I have my A levels. “What the fuck and I doing here on a perfectly free Saturday when I should be studying?” is what is reverberating within the hollowness of my head. Apparently it remains intangible, having no effect on the mind numbed by frequent repetitions of such warnings, not to mention the effect of the smirnoffs. Sigh, when the world is worrying about the end days, I’m wondering how the day would end…….may the day come when I possess resolve so powerful I can hopefully promote the reverberations into palpable actions.

          So exciting, finally having a piece of the internet. A place that I am the owner, a place that I can do and say what I want. As of now, I am a complete newbie in this blogging thing. And all that is in my mind now is how to make this the best blog I can make. And partly also to keep it running. So what do people do on their blogs? People talk about their life, the people around them, the shit they are in, and how screwed they are gonna be come next week or whenever. Its hardly an exciting thing for me actually, at least not yet. But as I continually get accustomed to posting and providing fresh contents, this place would work like a diary (That sounds so wrong, almost sissy-like). It’s like how the psychiatrists say, getting it out keeps   ur   sanity in. It is so especially true in my circumstance right now. But that is for later, now, I’m busy searching through the myriads of data in my mind for the specific emotion that comes with the creation of my first ever blog post and the responsibility to keep it running. Gosh, it’s a lot. Any way, this is written on the 24 th  of July of 2004, a period of time in which it’s halfway to the Preliminary Exams from the June holidays. This timeless period is best described as the “there is a bloody impt exam and I’m f*cking not care” period.         Oh and I must mention “This blog contains some bad words”.          The reason I use such unsavory language is because this blog involves unsavory contents based on unsavory experiences with unsavory characters.        I repeat, “This blog contains some bad words”.          No, the "unsavory" part does not involve porn or violence, but more subtle contents. At this point in time I don’t know what yet. But it’s definately not porn and violence. Maybe a little violence. Some harmless ones perhaps. It takes all sorts to make the world, so don’t ask.

         Rummaging through my email, I found this joke:             Drunk Driver                                A policeman pulls over a driver for swerving in and out of lanes on the highway. He tells the guy to blow a breath into a breathalyzer.  ''I can't do that, officer.''  ''Why not?''  ''Because I'm an asthmatic. I could get an asthma attack if I blow into that tube.''  ''Okay, we'll just get a urine sample down at the station.''  ''Can't do that either, officer.''  ''Why not?''  ''Because I'm a diabetic. I could get low blood sugar if I pee in a cup.''  ''Alright, we could get a blood sample.''  ''Can't do that either, officer.''  ''Why not?''  ''Because I'm a hemophiliac. If I give blood I could die.''  ''Fine then, just walk this white line.''  ''Can't do that either, officer.''  ''Why not?''  ''Because I'm drunk.''                 Lemme add another line:        “The very fact that I’m admitting ‘I’m drunk’ shows that I’m really drunk”                 For me, I never got wasted before. Admittedly I was disorientated before, but I can still think. Speaking of alcohol, most people can remember me by “Purple John”, “Long John Purple” or God forbid “Barney”. Really, I seem to have a nasty reaction to alcohol. I don’t know if it’s an allergy, but it’s a real pain in the ass. Surprisingly, I have never got drunk before no matter how much I drink.         To Justin. Don’t spread word that I had hit on my mum while I was wasted. Don’t believe that (both the fact that I hit on my mum and I was ever wasted). Jonathan can testify. Justin, you probably would go fuck ANYTHING with a skirt when   ur   drunk. So don’t be lecturing me, go lecture   Leon  , the guy who would fuck ANYTHING REMOTELY having 4 limbs and a hole, including chairs, even when he is SOBER.                      Anyway, alcohol isn’t only the substance I’m allergic to. I am also suddenly allergic, or “intolerant” of lactose, a component of cheese (I’m a big fan of cheese). It’s such a bloody waste I can’t eat cheese or dairy products now. It started with the Meiji pasteurized milk incident. Man! What a load of crap. It’s shitty torture when you suddenly can’t eat things that you like.

         A friend of mine says that everything bad in his country ( America ) always seems to come from   California  . And he doesn’t mean the earthquakes, fires, floods, and riots. His list is long and impressive:     Richard Nixon                   Ronald Reagan                   John Wayne                   All the major defense contractors                    Disneyland                    The John Birch Society                   Congressman Bob Dornan                   The anti-immigrant movement                   Prop. 13, the anti-tax initiative     Charles Manson     I told him that, other than Manson, everything he mentioned has one connecting thread:  Orange County ,  California , a massive sprawl of land and people between  Los Angeles  and   San   Diego  . Nixon was born there, Reagan got 75% of the vote there, and a big statue of the Duke, who lived and died there, greets you upon landing at  Orange   County ’s   John    Wayne   Airport  .                    Orange   County  has been called the “spiritual base” for American’s conservatives-and every loony, right-wing idea the country had to fight over the years seems to have got its start in   Orange    County  . Californians are, naturally, embarrassed by this and often try to shift the blame for  America ’s rightward drift to Southern rednecks and Bible Belters or, lately, the militias of  Montana  and   Michigan  .                   But the sad truth is that the Republican Revolution had its birth in   California  . And at this point in time, my friend announced that he knew less about American politics that I do, and so I let off on the elaboration. Till now, he was right that  Orange   County  is the most screwed up place in   America  . Being one of the richest counties comparable to Grosse Pointe and  Westchester , it had actually declared itself bankrupt in December 1994. How does one of the richest counties in the country go  bankrupt ? Apparently the county treasurer had invested the taxpayers’ money in high risk “derivatives” that were tied to the fluctuations of the interest rates.                     County   Treasurer   Robert Citron, according to the U.S News and World Report, “had borrowed $12.5 billion and poured the money into these derivatives-financial agreements whose values are based on an underlying asset such as a bond. But as the Fed steadily boosted interest rates that year, Orange County got caught in a bind; it had to pay more on it’s borrowings than it was earning on its investments.” This spread led to   Orange   County  ’s debacle.                   Like most of you, I don’t have a clue about what I’ve just quoted, but the rich understand all of this and that’s how they got rich in the first place. We would expect the treasurer of  Davenport  to screw up something this complicated, but not the barons of wealth in   Orange   County  . I think it’s embarrassing to have the rest of the world see just how stupid our rich people are. (What my friend said, I hadnt managed to respeech it.)                    But this high-rolling investment backfired in   Orange    County  -and the residents lost a whooping $1.7 billion of their tax money! The rich, unlike us, get really pissed when they lose that kind of money. (When we lose our $30,000 a year job, we just take more Prozac.)                   Blame was thrown everywhere and the leaders of OC were running to state capital in   Sacramento   and begging for a bailout. They suddenly thought welfare was a good idea. They sent a plea to   Washington   for help. This many rich people had not been collectively choked since the Titanic hit that iceberg.                   The politicians of   Sacramento   were understandably not all that eager to go out on a limb for the county that them to fuck off. How would it look for those politicians to start bailing their constituents’ rich butts out of hock when millions of Californians have lost everything they had for far less stupidity?                   The legislature told OC that charity begins at home and that in the true spirit of volunteerism, they would use their thousand points of light to pass a countrywide tax to pay off their own debts.                   That didn’t work out and OC has come up with a brilliant idea to raise money. They have declared they will open their landfills to their neighbors. Other communities can now bring their trash to OC and dump it there-for a fee. The OC landfill will accept-at a price of up to $35 a ton-the trash from nearby counties. They are hoping they would take in $15 million a year for the next 20 years.                   But to do that, they need to attract 5000 tons of trash a day. That’s a lot of garbage, even by Californian standards, and I worry that they will not be able to meet their quota.                   So let’s help them out! Send them your garbage! It will make you feel good (ah, to dump it on OC) and you’ll be performing a community service (raising money to help them pay off that $1.7 billion debt). This is reverse Reaganomics in action. HAHA!                    So gather up all your empty Wheaties boxes, your orange juice cans, last night’s pizza boxes, those socks with the holes in them, and send them to a private trash hauler contracted to use   Orange    County  ’s landfill:                        Taormina Industries, Inc.                     PO Box  309                      Anaheim ,  CA    92815                 Taormina   has agreed to accept the trash of the people who are willing to send them-provided you send along payment for the dump. According to my friend, in order to comply to U.S. Postal Service regulations, you must make sure that nothing you send has too foul an odor, and that it won’t leak, blow up, or emit radiation. It  is  permissible to send garbage. But make sure that it is wrapped properly and has the correct amount of postage on it. Mark on the outside  PROJECT ORANGE DUMP , and indicate “charitable garbage enclosed.” Be sure to enclose a payment for the dump. That’s $35 a ton, or 2 cents a pound, plus a couple of extra dollars for handling. (People not in   America   should take care to pay for international postage delivery charges)                   Remember that you’ll be doing this for the good of the county. Send you trash to the OC now!             The above post was taken from bits and pieces of information my friend and I had discussed on MSN Messenger, plus sources from some research.

         The first rule of thumb when you are using a heat oven: Never touch metallic surfaces when handling the oven. Second rule of thumb: Put food into pan BEFORE putting pan into oven. Third rule of thumb: Never prod the sausages while they are in the oven. It might result in the sausages being tossed out of the pan and landing on the heating element, thereby resulting in a big sizzle and smog, and a pretty nasty stain on the heating element that would be a bitch to get rid of, if at all. These seemingly common sense and logical assumption can often be neglected by people who normally seem sane and even intelligent. The result is an extravagant fiasco within my very own kitchen. It almost seems like the kind of mist they put on in the Musical Fountains for the laser show. Only the connotations areway more negative. I am about to give you readers the account of today. The narrative based on sheer “human error” (euphemism for stupidity) that will shock even the most clueless of the readers…….     Omg….I think the protagonist here is getting pissed. Maybe I should discontinue with the proposed description. It would bring me, shall we say, a less than desired outcome involving a metal rod and a certain bodily orifice.     But still, remember………..sausages (shit, can’t spell it correctly. Thank God for Autocorrect). The equation is shown below:           Sausages + Very hot 10 mins pre-heated Heating element = Holy Fuckomoly!                           Well, since I can’t describe the “human error” I witnessed, you people can still see the articles i have below:        “Pancake” Thief        (January 2003,   India  ) Regarding accidental deaths during the construction of a subway in   New Delhi  , the New York Times wrote, "One of those killed was an unlucky thief who tried to steal braces holding up a concrete slab; it fell and killed him."             Sharp Landing     (February 2003,  East Timor ) A man was found lying facedown, covered in mud and blood, the apparent the victim of a street crime in Dili, the capital of  East  Timor . It was not until a post mortem examination was conducted that U.N. police were able to reconstruct his last moments. This up-and-coming young man decided that it was cool to shove his weapons, two long knives, down the waistband of his trousers. Unsheathed. The hapless fellow jumped over a small fence and landed in a large puddle of mud. He slipped, which sent the blade of his "trouser knife" into his leg, severing his femoral artery. He bled to death before he could stagger ten feet from the puddle.     Perfect examples of people that would sacrifice themselves for the overall good of humanity, by “removing” themselves and their stupid genes from the human gene pool (I had assumed that intelligence is limitedly hereditary). I’m actually writing this as a mild insult to the perpetrator that destroyed my kitchen, but since I hadn’t crossed the line by explicitly naming him, I can be pretty certain that the contents of my ass will stay the same. Hahahahaha!!!!

         How long has it been? 4 days? I apologize for not updating my blog for quite some time. The past few days hit me like a tornado and I haven’t got around to posting a new line. Much of it was cause blogspot couldn’t work properly though.     Anybody    who wishes to go to the fireworks festival at the   Fullerton   had better get there early, last night, the entire bridge had to be locked down and cars were trapped in seas of people, that was horrible, but luckily we got a pretty good vantage point perched high on a road rail, it was pretty good. Cant help but look around at the suckers who were standing and elbowing each other. Undoubtedly we could have got a better position (we are sitting in front of a street lamp. Not good if you wanna see the full patina of the fireworks), if not for selected minorities within the group who decides to “catch the festival in its full swing” and “wandering around” to “check things out”. His exact words. Regardless, it was still a thrilling experience, though the fireworks lasted a tad too short. Well, there’s never enough fireworks anyway. Next time (meaning next week), if we decide to watch pyrotechnics again, we had better find a good place early, like 7pm, 1½ hours before the fireworks really start. Some of you reading this might find it a bit “bo-liao” camping on the bridge with 200000 people around waiting for 1½ hours to get a glimpse of the 10mins long fireworks. Not really, it was worth it actually, just hanging out with my folks.                   Anyway, that was yesterday. The day before yesterday (sounds complimentary to “the day after tomorrow” *smirk), let me think, so I was at the library settling my library records. I had intended to report the magazine lost out of library, but I decided to “voluntarily lessen” (that is , to lie), the penalty I had, so I reported the magazine I had lost at Em’s house to be lost WITHIN the library. And so they believed it, that’s a break. And they will be searching for it. This, way I had temporarily saved 16 dollars of the fine. I would just need to pay for the 10 which is charged as overdue. Then I took a straight bus to Sim Lim and visit my favourite shop (cant tell u guys sorry, cause he gives me great offers and says that he cant give everyone good offers), I had him give me the specs for an excellent gaming comp. it’s rated 9.5 overall, and the specs are: MSI 915P Neo2 Platinum motherboard, an Intel Pentium HT Extreme processor 4.2GHz that hasn’t been released until the end of the year. He advised me to get that later, it shows18% marketed increase from the present HT processors. An ATI Radeon 9800 XT, and 2 XMS PRO 1 GB Corsair RAMS. It’s like a freaking overhaul for my comp! All these new parts amount to $3800! OMG, where on this god-damn world do I get this kind of money?! So that’s y I’m putting this up for my Christmas wishlist, I doubt I could get all of them for Christmas though. Anyway, I’m looking for more solutions and maybe packages to lessen the cost.                   The day before yesterday’s yesterday I was school-bound. On the bus I was listening to my mp3, blasting away on the ear phones like nobody’s business. Apparently not, this guy from ACJC was sitting beside me and tapped me on the shoulder. I removed my earphones and he said, “Thanks for the free music” then he got off. Weird. I think I managed to reply a “you’re welcome”. But I can’t remember now. Later that day I watched I, Robot again. Sometimes when you watch a movie more than 1 time, you catch the movie more, especially the subtle details, but all these “subtle details” isn’t worth 8 bucks. Remind me not to do something like that again. So after the movie, I didn’t go to Em’s house, I was tired, so I went across the hallway and played on Jon’s Xbox, without him around to acknowledge me doing so. So I played and played, and then he got home. Remarkably, he didn’t scold me or anything. He just said “ Yesterday I was playing and I got over 75,000 in Schizophrenia” then I told him “Think my score is weak, try beating this new one I’ve set AFTER you got your 75,000” (I got 100,000 points in the half-pipe of Schizophrenia) “Man you can’t even front on that one, kid. Best go home to preschool.” I almost felt pity for him. From the looks of it, he has decided to give up on the freestyle for race events where he might actually have a chance of beating me.                   This long holiday is quite eventful, even for my Chemistry revision. Although it was only 6 inorganic topics, and of which I did the MCQ on my newly bought TYS, I had got an impressive 80%. Encouraging, yes? But hell, I haven’t got started on my Bio TYS yet. It’s BORING!  SIAN ! Worse than the other subjects. As for homework, I haven’t done any of them. That’s normal for me. As for Jon, he has started studying! I would also be seriously studying if my prelims are 1 week away! JJ prelims are so late. The syllabus is kinda slow. It seems that I have to do some reading afore.                   That pretty much sums up this weekend.

                     I am writing this in the heart of the frosty night, with little except my own CPU warming me up amidst the frigidness of the air conditioning. No matter the briskness of the weather, I never fail to turn up the air conditioning to “High cold”. Don’t ask me why, it has been a tradition. I just gave Jen an earful just now for, in an unprecedented attempt, snapping my guitar strings yet again. Is he gonna set a world record for the most sets of strings being replaced in a week? Considering the week started like yesterday, and he got a total of 3 strings, 2 of which has to be entirely replaced. I am so pissed, I have nothing to say. And this weather has just aggravated my mood. Thankfully, the only thing that has stopped me from imploding is the sporadic comedy Friends I had just watched on TV. Unfortunately, it ended 15 minutes ago, and all the warmness is starting to really wear off. So much for thermal equilibrium.                   Happy tomorrow’s-the maths-test-and-I-havent-fucking-studied day to all in my class. I cant wait so see how bad I can possibly get. I’m literally jumping for joy. Btw, how the hell do I do poisson and binomials, and what’s the shit about np     HEAR ME! BE YE GODS OR DEVILS, I AM A WANDERER WITHOUT GUIDANCE, A MATHLESS SOUL NEEDING RESTITUTION. HARK THY CALL!                   Whatever.                   Until now, I’m still freaking mad about what Jen did to my guitar. Man, is he gonna get it. But he got it today, a stab in his abs. Just he not cross my path the next time…..luckily for him he knows he’s in trouble, he didn’t return a jab nor retaliate in any form. Sigh, maybe I should issue an apology, but shit, u can break my guitar strings once, maybe get away with negligence twice, but FUCK, NOBODY GETS HER PUSSY WAY WITH 3 STRINGS IN LESS THAN A WEEK! IF YOU ARE READING WHIS JEN, U HAD BETTER NOT TOUCH MY GUITAR AGAIN, ASSHOLE.                   What a enticing way to end a day, with a fuckknuckle dickwad. Anyway, I think I might be inclined to delete this posting in the future due to the highly unsettling emotions within it. now, I am not gonna sit here and let more negativity be generated. I’m going to sleep.
