       I have Over 6 weeks of summer left.. 44 days of nothingness. Everyday, everyday. I guess at one point i'd be happy...but gettin up at 2pm everyday...doin nothin but sittin outside and chattin online---thats not cool! Sure, the weather is fantastic---and i'd hate to be stuck inside all day...but by the time i'm ready to go outside (after breakfast, shower, etc) guess what time it is? 3pm. The exact time when school is suppose to be dismissed. Thinking back (I was talking to dave about this)....The beggining of last year (school year) was great for the both of us. Half way through...it became HELL. My last day of school (haha i actually had 2, the last day at semi and the last day of the year at powell river learning centre) was just like any other day, the next morning I slept into 11am (when I was suppose to be dismissed) and called my Grandmother from my hotel room---I slept in cause my eye was hurting from a bike riding accident. She said she would pick me up. We went to have lunch. I left a couple days later (actually it's still quite blurry in my mind).

I will prolly go with my dad (he already agreed), but dave wants to come aswell so I might just go with his mom and him.

         My current music situation is a couple of 10 watt JBL computer speakers. I like my music, and this cant do!! The system shown is a 500 watt sony mini system..its $400. I easily could settle for the 400 watt system for $300. I was also looking up the computer speakers (logitech) and they go for 300-500. The wattage for the $300 one is 280. The $500 (which is a little too high) is 500 watts. Aslong as it connects to my computer using the regular speaker wires and not having to split them (it gets distorted) then I would be totally happy. Now for the money--anyone?

       Although it's barely visible today, the horrible clouds looming high over town was actually from a forest fire in the center of our province. It covered all of Vancouver, Victoria and Seattle aswell. Included is a photograph, the smoke is hard to see in this photo but just above the tree line you will hopefully see a gray haze.

       and apparently I have "taken lazyness to a whole new level" "an art form". According to Nicole, who I rarely talk to...but i actually introduced her to dave, and now dave talks to her quite a bit. Well Ive been listening to music...i drank some crazy juice from my secrete stash at about 8...and i can still feel it... but I fell asleep from like 11 to 1:30am. Now it's 4:30 and I still dont wanna go to sleep..but suprisingly a lot of people are online so I will give it atleast another 30mins+. Damn, I broke my lamp..with the expensive "energy saving" light bulb...Cause it just smashes down onto the table every once n a while--but this time a coke can was in the way. Now I am scared of the electricity/fumes/having to buy a new light bulb. Prolly wont be an energy saving bulb this time tho :-(

       Well I woke up at 12:30pm today to the voice of the weather guy on channel 11. He said it was currently 32 and&nbsp;was gonna get&nbsp;warmer. I got ready and rode my bike down to the beach, the tide was in, the water was rough, there was serious overcast and it was no more than 20 degrees. I am so pissed off! So I went for my bike ride and came back. Next time I see him i'm gonna whack him with a sock full of quaters.

       Can it be true? Can I really get my licence in only 2 months?? I thought the 9 months with my learner's permit would never end...but the last 7 months like didnt even exsist. Wow, I better go put out some resumes to get a job so I can&nbsp;get a lease on a car (well&nbsp;I would&nbsp;need my grandma or someone to co-sign).&nbsp;I also need to take my other 2 young drivers courses,, its just been so warm and it sounds so boring.. Oh well. I doubt I will actually "buy" a car. I mean, a finance is possible..but I don't know if I will need a used car in 4 years like that...

       Well I went for a little bike ride cause I should...it wasnt too long but at least I got a little bit of exersize today...and I also saw the northern lights--which is extremely rare here in British Columbia--theres a higher chance to see them in Texas (central) or north (like uhh northwest territories?). I should go to bed soon, but I don't want to yet hehe.

       My dad and I went to the truck rental place and I drove, that was fast, then we went to get my resume copied at the pharmacy...of coarse my dad always yells at me about my parking even when its perfect and he made a fucking fool of me and himself. He yelled once again about parking at the grochery store even though it was totally perfect (you just had to see it). I was with him for maybe 5 minutes in the store and I already had a horride headache. When we where half done I walked over to take a look at the new arena. I took a tylenol and then went and sat in the car. I'm making a hamburger patty now and am prolly gonna go for a bike ride afterwards. Besides that, I talked to dave, grandma quickly aswell as called for UPS to pick up the dell keyboard. Talking about computers, my server/radio station will not be online in the next while because the windows is totally fucked up. I reinstalled xp and it still doesnt work..i might just install linux.

       not a lot to say this morning, ahaha I woke up at 1pm by the way, or I tried at 11 and I was awake but I didnt wanna get out of bed. So why not  urlLink check this out . It's the toothbrush posse, I am on the bottem left (8th row). If you click it, you will get my nexus profile! Yeah I think it's cool but eh..Im boring. Also to my amazment-when I turned on my printer this morning out of nowhere it printed my resume perfectly-without it even being asked!! I thought I was going to have to buy and ink cartridge before I could hand out my resume..Now I just have to get it copied at the pharmacy in parksville a few time when I go with my dad to the truck rental place to pay the bill for when him and ryan went to powell river on saturday to get a whole bunch of our stuff! Besides that-my life basicly revolves around listening to music and chatting online (as you already might know! hehe). Life is getting boring lately-the wheather has been good. Well, I'm gonna go on another bike ride today after I go with my dad, and I have to eat breakfast and brush my teeth yet so i'm gonna go.

       I got my replacement keyboard today..installed it..now it works fine.  My day: Woke up for like 2 hours from 2-4am....fell back asleep (i usally dont fall a sleep until then) and finally woke up at about 12:15pm hehe.  David Moodie called me around 12:30pm..he said to meet me at the school in 25 minutes. I had my shower and got to the school. He was there with a friend of his-Tyler. Basicly from 1:30-7 we just stayed in the town area...went to Quality Foods for 4+ hours...in the upstairs starbucks place..&nbsp;&nbsp;We also went to Iris's house. She wasn't there but her sister was. She doesn't&nbsp;like me after our teacher caused all those problems for me in grade 8. I was partly to blame though..cause I was very stubbern about equal student rights/etc. He was a dick from day 1, just plain didn't like me. But then around halfway through the year I ended up in the school's own "alternative" program. Seriously, where the 'tards go. Around 8 or so David's mom came with her boyfriend (Brian) and we got a movie. We went back to David's house and watched the movie (Barber Shop 2). I got home around 10:30pm, then I got my keyboard, installed it, listened to music and guess what? my whole system blows. Some sort of power surge to the stereo. So now i'm using headphones until I get my computer speakers from my grandmother's on Saturday. I'm getting kinda tired..i should go to sleep before 2:30...... Also..I got my haircut yesterday..too short though..now im not gonna look too good for at least a week err.. Also, I went to the dentist yesterday (I hope i'm not repeating myself lol) and he evened my tooth closing to be more comfy hehe....ALSO the weather has been very nice lately...it was 31 today, suppose to be 34 tommorow...(thats a good 93F)

       Below you will see my resume...   I was hired by Tim Hortens in Burnaby, but I had to move the day I was suppose to start. So I decided to create a new resume. It looks quite informative and professional, I even included work I did for the school almost three years ago for 2 weeks. Mwahaha whatever I worded things very proffesionaly and all. What else? Well my grandmother said that my dad can come and pick up all our stuff including my router! So soon y'all can be listening to my fav songs broadcasting at 128kbps stereo mp3 shoutcast radio sound music! hehe. Actually, last time my file exchange service (similar to kazaa except all the stuff was hosted in my server) was the most popular feature of my site. It got overloaded, people abused it, but I managed to overcome those obsticals with more power and space. My family got fucked up, all my money was stolen and I wasn't able to continue to offer the service. Now I can! yay! Besides that, I've been doing nothing but sleeping, chatting and well yeah thats about it! mwahaha. I really need some good drugs to pass the time ;-(.) yummy drugs! ;-)

       I don't care if my so called "mother" finds this, cause I don't want anything to do with her anymore. I an nolonger affiliated with her or her boyfriend. A lot has happened in my life since this "divorce" stuff started happening with my mother and father. To put it simply (and legally) I went to go live with my mother after the divorce. She had some personal "issues" and...hell she went crazy k? So anyways I moved back with my dad and then he sold the house and I went to go live with my aunts, grandmother, uncle's homes until the beggining on the month. My dad is still living off the money from selling the house (he's renting) and "planes" to get a job. Now I am living here in Qualicum Beach, British Columbia because my dad can't afford to rent there. Things where pretty good when I was temporarily living with my mother, and even better when I was living with my aunt. Now it kinda sucks. I don't know anyone here accept Dave (which I knew before I moved to Surrey for two years-thats when all the "bad" things happened). I have been meaning to make a blog again but i've been worried of my dad disconnecting my Internet because although he has a bitter relationship with my mother-he still listens to every word she says. She claims she will sue my dad if she finds out I am on the Internet. Personally I think it's bullshit, you? Well why? Because I wrote a few bad things about her before. The only thing is...its all true. If you where lucky enough to read it-use the information wisely...if not? you missed out on a hell of a story. It's currently the summer, I spend most of my days eating (low carb food), sleeping (irregularily), talking online (nexopia/msn), listening to music and getting into trouble mmhmm.

       The news advertisments that have been flooding the airwaves make it very clear that those who star in the commercial are "not afraid to be themselves". It mentions that they will not wear something because it's cool, and basicly that they want to be themselves. I find this very strange because Wal-Mart is the worlds largest retailer, and sells basicly the same products across the country. They are no different than The Gap, one they release a new shirt or jacket, actually, they just release their own styles, Everybody is wearing it the next day. How many people wear stuff from Wal-Mart? Well how about this? Right now I am wearing an Old Navy shirt, and Wal-Mart pants. How typical? Do I try to be myself? Hell no...I'm more different than I would like to be. Do I believe everyone should be the same? Not really. Will I continue to shop at Wal-Mart? Yes. Do I think by wearing Wal-Mart makes me unique? No, quite the oposite. I don't really say a lot of stuff like this...but I do enjoy sometimes speaking my opinion. In fact, I even optionally added the Blogger top bar at the time...At least until I get a bit more traffic coming in here. In fact, Google practicly owns this site. I use Blogger to post, I have Google Ads on this site, Google Search Engine embedded on this page, I get paid by Google (not a lot may I add), I get my mail from Google (gmail)...Could I get away from it? Yes. But google would still come crawling in to *crawl* my website.

       I was just thinking, how long has it been since I have eaten in a resuraunt? TOO DAMN LONG! btw, chinese, pizza and mcdonalds take-out doesn't count. I havn't eaten out for over a month! I did like twice a month ago, and before that I didn't for like a month before that! I mean, I know my dad doens't have a lot of money, and it isn't that huge of a deal because i'm on a diet (atkins) but when i get deprived of shit like this, it makes me crave it more, which makes me go on binges, which is not fun. I mean, it's fun for like 2 days cause I can eat whatever the hell I want, but a week quickly passes and I realize that I'm laying in bed, eating peanut butter toast..like eww! I don't know about the money issue my dad has with my mom, and he wont tell me..he claims it isn't any of my business...but besides that I don't think it's fair because I am the one going without new clothes, and resturaunt food! And when I moved back in with him I demanded a small allowence to help keep my money balance stable. Nope, he hasn't given me a penny. And, he hasn't made one effort to drive me into Parksville or Nanaimo to look for a job. And that is just like 5% of the issue. He moved me here, and I have no friends here, and as hard as I am trying, I still havn't made any friends. It's really depressing. That's just another small 5% of the issue. The other 90% of the issue is that I just plain can't stand living here! My brother has no respect for me-at all. He is extremely loud, nasty and annoying. He is consistantly bothering me, but I try to ignore him because of the little respect he has for me, and then he goes and tells my dad some bullshit story. My dad is a whole other issue. He doesn't know what I do, and at one point he didn't care. Now he is actually being very, very strange. He says I am "getting worse" as if I was becoming depressed again. I am not getting depressed..I probably will be soon if the damn stress level doesn't decrease. My brother is a trouble maker, he has no friends and causes trouble for something to do. And he can't always deal with the consiquences. Like tonight, he reported me to a nexopia admin and claimed "abuse". So of coarse, I unplug his internet and tell him "you said you would stay off that fucking site". I lock my door by putting a peice of wood behind my tv stand and jams the door (I always do that). About 20 minutes later my dad crashes into my room, pushes my tv stand out of the way, I fall over in my chair crying and he comes and bends over me and screams and screams at me. I don't know about you, but when somebody yells that loud so closely to me, the sound becomes muffled and I cannot understand what he is saying. Sometimes when he mentions something he gets extremely angry because he claims he is repeating himself. I really don't know what he said the first time, and frankly, I really don't give a fuck. I just want to be left alone, they can do their thing, but they can't talk as loudly as they do, I have extremely sensitive hearing (and eyesight, etc) and I cannot handle the stress from the constant fighting. I  would  clean the dishes, vancumm the floors etc, Just ask some of the people I have stayed with in the last few months...even my mom! (actually I don't suggest you talk to her). I just couldn't handle the stress from being in the kitchen for more than 5 minutes. I had the worst headache today, and it's just going away now. I should prolly go to bed now, as it took 20 minutes to write this the actualy time is now 5:13am. blargh.

       He cannot be trusted...on the internet or whereever. He reported abuse to Nexopia and they gave me a warning. Anyways, I met some new people tonight. I rode up to the bank and someone said hi, I of coarse replied and we all started talking. I don't know if this will work out very well or anything but I sure hope I see them again. Just now he told my dad that I threw a speaker at him...and my dad crashes in here and totally freaks out at me! I soo wanna stay in Qualicum, but i soo don't wanna stay with them. My dad has totally ruined my life so many times. Whenever I get a life, he takes it away.

       OMG I JUST LOST MY LAST POST! Anyway, to leave it breif...I went for a bike ride, met a few people which was good cause I need some friends here. If you read my last post I have had a lot of troubles with my dad tonight, and when I tried to cook some sausages my brother got all weird about the sausages and my dad (he had to wake up) and he yelled and yelled and it esculated to an extreme point (I wasn't even saying anything-in fact I prolly only said 2, 3 words). He said stuff like "I have to move out"....which is a good thing because I want to. But anyways...I will prolly say more tommorow....now to finish my sausages....

       I sometimes talk about little things like being yelled at when I go into the kitchen, but sometimes it's so bad I feel like just hitting them with a baseball bat! Today we went to Nanaimo (what else was I gonna do?) and we went to the stupid mall (rutherford) and they got their haircut. I was hungry so I asked my dad before he went in for his haircut for something to eat. I suggested a protien bar. He thought it was a great, cheap idea. I go and get one and the total was $3.09 (after tax) and my dad flipped out right there in the store! Zellers only charged 2 cents cheaper for them-I checked while they where getting their haircuts. I know walmart sells them for 2.40 and superstore sells them for about 2.50. He literally flipped out about 50 cents! Hell, if I had my wallet at the time I would have paid just to shut the beast up. But he made a fool of himself in the nutrition store. After that my father wanted to check his lottery tickets so he did that and I went with my brother Ryan to Sears. We specificly told him to meet us in sears. We waited, and waited, sat down on a couch and waited in total maybe 25 minutes? We finally gave up and walked back to the van, where my dad was sitting! I asked him why the hell he had still not come to see us. He didn't even listen. He freaked out and started yelling at me and ryan because "we didn't tell him to meet him in sears". I can't believe it. He was then a total asshole until (him driving now) we get to the superstore. I was waiting in the van with ryan so I got in the driver seat and practiced my parrelel parking. I was getting really pissed off at Ryan because he wouldn't stop talking! He just talks to me because he has no friends. And he talks a lot. Anyways, finally my dad comes back (he only got bacon and coke) and it took him over half and hour. While waiting for him to finish smoking his ciggerette, I got so pissed off at my brother that I moved my hand right up close to his face. He leans over and pretends that I hit him. Now my dad says "I heard a slap and everything!" which is impossible because he is half deaf anyway. Him and Ryan where complete assholes on the way home, especially Ryan saying insane things like "Richard told me that he was pissed off that you bought bacardi instead of smirnoff last time"...he knows i'm having trouble convincing my dad that I don't steal his liquor...especially after the "insodent". I actually think Ryan is trying to frame me, Ryan knows my dad puts his Vodka in the freezer cause he likes it cold. One day he asked me if I had been stealing it and replacing it with water because it was frozen. Maybe he just takes it and blames me?! Whatever, once we got home my brother and I got in a huge fight...Well actually I was trying to cook a hamburger and he wouldn't leave me alone. (remember how loud he is? I'm gonna have to record him one day just to show)

       Dave stopped by, for the last time. Basicly I gave him his 40 dollars, and he gives me a cheque for 40 dollars (hehe a cash advance) but anyway he said "well my mom wants to go, do you want me to come in or something?" and I said "ahh you dont have too" and I said bye, he did too. Not too friendly, but very upsetting nontheless. I actually cried afterwards.. first time in a long time. But he will be back before long..at least I hope so. He says he will stay 6 months, possibly a year. He said that he wouldn't stay longer than a year-but if it goes over 6 months..hes staying there permenently k? For those who don't know, dave is a very good friend of mine-we have known each other since november/2001.  Not a long time in your books? too bad it was a big deal. And if it wasn't that long of a friendship, this 6-12 month thing is obviously a big issue.  The funny thing is, I've known him much longer when I was not going to his school..I moved to Surrey in April/02. Just a few months after we met. He will still be my friend, online and on the phone. The difference between me moving to surrey from qualicum and him moving from qualicum to kitchener is about 5 thousand kilometres. Thats the difference between driving distance and well, i dont think my dad would let me drive across the country. so i'm pretty depressed right now, and i'm also tired because i didn't sleep last night. oh well.

       Well too bad than, don't read it! But, if you have your opinion, why not read the whole thing before joking about it? nah, i'm still pissed off because of my tooth pain. I got some Tylenol 3 from the dentist today..and I'm a little scared to take them because I was reading about them on  urlLink Erowid  (a site that contains great information before using a drug) and it says you can get addicted to the codeine with less than 3 tables a week! They also say the withdrawl isn't too bad, but still uncomfortable and often people will go to long lengths to avoid it. I might try one later today because my tooth pain is getting worse. I need my damn surgery!! I watched the meteor shower tonight..It wasn't horribly great or anything, but definetly something that wasn't worth missing. But seeing the northern lights the other day was way more interesting than that. I have seen meteor showers before, and tonight's where not the best-but the lights was the first time ever, and I have always wanted to. Basicly now I am still deciding whether to sleep tonight or not...I prolly shouldn't-I'm not even tired and it's 4:11am. Whatever, I'm still chatting online..few are online tonight though. Oh well.. I went on a good bike ride today, It was a good hour/possibly more I wasn't keeping track. I rode up this hillbilly road and ended up at the Freeway! Crazyness, but an awesome ride. David is leaving on Friday, and tommorow is when I see him last I guess, he's borrowing $40 from me tommorow for gas! Well, I shouldn't advertise it too much. hehe too late.

       Constant pain...apparently i can't see the dentist until the end of the month. I am going to get my dad to call the dentist in the morning to get me some sort of anti-pain medication. I mean, ive taken like 7 tylenol today, and it still hurts!

       Today, nothing happened. Well, a little bit happened, so I'll just say it. I woke up, at about 1:30/2pm (around there). I had my shower and I went to go read the newspaper outside in the sun. It's a warm day. I've been meaning to clean my room, and I really probably should, but I'm just under so much stress from my dad and my brother. Today, I went into the kitchen to cook hamburger. I kept getting yelled at from both of them! Finally my dad backed off and it was just Ryan yelling, then my dad started yelling at Ryan because he wouldn't shut up! I of coarse poured Crystal Light on Ryan which made the situation really bad for a minute, but then he had a shower and changed and everything was calm again. Besides that, I talked to a few people online and I might go for a walk in the trail.

       Today was alright, I woke up earlier than usual, 11am lol. David came over, and every time he does I feel sad, because every time could be the last. No, he's not dying or anything...he's moving...across the country. He keeps saying he wants to come back in 6 months, but he might end up staying for an entire year. I don't know, what if he likes it, and stays forever!! Omg well I don't even want to go that far. We walken up to Ashley's house, where we recently had David's "Going Away" party. We snuck around the side of the house, Dave opened the back sliding door and ran into her eating on the coffee table. All I heard was footsteps and a loud scream. I was hiding down stairs, outside and was worried because after that I heard nothing. I thought maybe her or someone else had actually hurt Dave! We where only there for a little bit, but then her dad came home so we had to leave. We walked down to the Park and Dave had the brilliant idea of walking through the park to get behind my house. We both got stung by yellow jackets haha. After that we went to Nanaimo. I drove, after a huge fight with my dad about it because he always wants to drive...but he drove around Nanaimo, and back--even though Me and Dave left before my dad and brother went to go do their business. Yeah, actually my dad needed to go to the Superstore to return his steaks because they where infected haha. He actually called poison control last night omg! They where actually recalling them when he went in he said. Me and Dave stayed at the mall, and we went and ate New York Fries. Basicly for those who dont know, are the greasyiest, tastiest fries ever, covered in cheese sauce. My debit card was declind the first time cause I forgot my password! luckly, my second attempt worked. I didn't look to great today, because I didn't wash my cloths last night. But tommorow or wednesday I need to go out and hand out more resumes. After that we hung out in front of Wal-Mart mwahaha. My dad finally came to pick us up and he gave us a dollar each, so we had to go into walmart to get change...of coarse they dont sell cans up front, they also can't open the register unless a sale is made. So anyway, the teller told us we could go to customer service and get change. No, but she asked "Who said that??" i pointed to the teller, "TELLER 8?!", i said uhh yeah... she said "Thats completely against policy!!" then dave finally came to Teller 8's rescue and said "nonono, she said if we rush over maybe she would let us or something"... I never founded out what happened to Teller 8. Oh, and i wanted to add something else that I just was reminded of, when I was sitting in front of Wal-Mart today, across the street at a chrysler dealer guess what the temperature there was? 108 degrees. I dont exactly "feel" the heat as much as i used to..but it makes me sweat, which is nasty. It's about 85 in front of my house, but it was darn hot in that fucking parking lot!!

       My dad and brother try so hard to piss me off. I kept getting up because they where leaving lights on or talking and I couldnt sleep. I put something infront of my door, took a sleeping pill and finally fell a sleep...at like 3:30. It was crazy. I actually woke up at about 1:30 which isnt too bad, but I really wanna try to get up earlier than that for tommorow because I really need to put out resumes! Thats just another day in my boring life. Actually no. But we are in another (mini) heat wave again which is hella nice, tommorow is getting up to 30+ again which is soo nice. I talked to my grandmother yesterday night and she said I will have to call my phone company (fido) or should I say my ex-phone company cause all we got here is telus, bell and rogers. Fido and sprint are Vancouver only...stupid ass middle of no-where town! I actually bothered to have a shower/get dressed today. I also went for my bike ride. It was a shorter bike ride than usual, but I will prolly go on a short one a little later this evening as well.

       Good title hehe. He seems to be a little less "invasive" now, but he wants me to go on a bike ride or just leave. He is being a complete ass, and my brother is now saying bad things about me. Even though I just told my dad about my brother harassing people online. Dave called me, he said he just felt dizzy. Maybe the water in his well is contaiminated? Because I was the only one drinking water that night--and I drank a lot hehe.

       So apparently my muscles arn't recieving enough oxygen. Almost every night I wake up screaming because of a horrible leg cramp in my Gastrocnemious muscle (hehe I took that word from a medical website-it means Calve) thats lower back of leg. I just go into a spasm for 1 to 3 minutes and it is insanly painful. Always my left leg. A couple times (not while sleeping-but while bending strangly) I have recieved insanly painful (and in my opinion extremely scary) thigh spasms. These are insanly painful and scary things---and its a scary horse tranqualizer like pain that nobody wants to experiance-Ever. But it happens, and usally it happens late at night (6, 7am) and I don't know what to do. It really scares me because I am trying to remember how to cure it and I remember back to my Grandmother said about releaving foot spasms (cause I go for long, long walks) which is to press my toes on the ground. So in my middle-of-the-night thinking I find it reasonable to just arch my foot's arch! (well I was floating last night if you read my last post). But thats my little rant about my leg cramps...and it's the main reason why I havn't gone to bed yet. I am actually scared to sleep. Last night was an especially horrific experiance because of my druggening. Oh, that reminds me...I told my mom some crazy ass story about why I was drugged...but I havn't told my dad about it yet--cause I don't want him thinking anything else. All I know is I started feeling weird right after I got home. It scared me a lot.

       Well its not quite a "party" but it was a gathering of some of david's close friends. thats me in the back sitting in the chair in photo number 1, click any pic to enlarge.  urlLink      urlLink    thats me and david's best friend, tara    urlLink    Me playing baseball...RIGHT! haha omg I hit the ball twice out of like 7 shots. Then it started to rain, how fun hehe.  Basicly it was a good day yesterday, after that dave came to my house and then we went to his house where a friend of his (Tayler) and two of her cousins where there. There was a crazy old man there with Dave's mother...He looked 90 but he was really 50. haha, there was a bad part though. A really bad part. I dont know how it happened but I was drugged somehow. I dont know how but when I got home I felt really, really bad. My dad was like "Your on something, arnt you?!" I basicly got really upset because i didn't want to feel like it. I felt like I was floating as well...very strange. Me and Dave blame the chinese chicken I had for dinner hehe--I was the only one who had any!! Oh, and I finally talked to Andrew after quite a while. It's hard to contact him because he is never online! Well at least I have his email address for future contact.

       It played at the end of Mean Girls, so I watched the end part like 8 times.. cause it gave me chills, so I go to download it...NO RESULTS. I finally get a good connection but it took me almost an hour to finally download at a rate of like 20kbps. Not to help its a 10mb song!! It's called "Orbital - Halcyon On and On". I really enjoy it.. I might just post it tommorow cause its really hard to find k?

       hehe im evil, i was gonna put thumbs up, but then i thought about the decapitation of thumbs and i got grossed out so I put 5 stars instead...I'm talking about the movie Mean Girls..I mean...it looks like a stupid movie if you see a poster of it, and even if you see a commerial for it you'd think it looks like a dumbass movie. I actually think it's so good I might watch it again tonight..I mean seriously, I laughed like crazy during the whole movie and then at the end I actually got chills from the ending!! I really suggest it, and its a huge plus that Lindsay Lohan is in it, cause i'm a huge fan of hers..I actually watched her other movie (I rented it)-Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen-and it was alright, but nothing great. I actually downloaded Mean Girls, and i'm gonna have to buy the DVD or atleast get a better copy of it because omg, It is an AWESOME movie. Well that was my night omg. Well I did spruce up this website, talked a little bit online..thats about it lol k.

       Accept getting fatter. My tooth hurts still, and now apparently i can't see a dentist until the end of the month. Nice. Okay, about my diet. I keep screwing up...from now on I will really watch what I eat. Just plain Suasage, Bacon, Ham, Turkey, Chicken, Beef, Fish and Cheese for me. I might have some lettuce, and maybe a slice of processed cheese once or twice. I will also have to start limiting my consumption of Diet Coke and Chyrstal Light-I drink more than enough liquid, but not enough water! I put the google ad at the bottem of the page, but as usual it's not bring in money yet because this site isn't on listed on google yet which really sucks. But for now it's showing Public Service advertisments, so I just put it at the bottem of the page. When/If I get listed on google I will place it back at the top of the page. I really need people to link to me because I really need hits, and hits mean more advertising revenue. Well, hopefully one day this little blog will get the respect it deserves!

       Well the weather is bad...however-it's not a bad thing. Lots of people have been wanting the weather to turn to rain cause of our recent heat wave...30+ weather is nice-but not for too long. I'm not saying I don't want it back! I'm just welcoming a little change, I think most are. Accept for those in Alberta-cause they got tornado clouds. Ehh well that aint good. A social worker came here today...She is (finally) responding to the phone call I made a month ago when my dad abandoned me. Things are alright now obviously. My dad wasn't too fun...didn't even have a shower. I submitted this site for Google AdSence. I would be able to do way more to this site if I had some money coming in...Like getting a real host! I don't want this site going down cause of bandwidth issues. My current free host is alright...they don't require any advertising, the speed is fine and the space is also good. The bandwidth is adequte, but I think they are making it unlimited now? I'm not 100% sure.

       Today I cleaned my room and formatted my computer cause I had a virus. I also went on a bike ride down to Parksville beach. It was like a three hour bike ride...I said last time I wouldn't do it again. I agreed on my way home today as well. But actually, Parksville beach was the location of yesterday's activities as well. I went to a car show. It was a quite boring car show, there were only a couple of cars I enjoyed. Nothing like the Pacific National Auto Show at BC Place a few months ago. These were basicly old cars that old people had from around the province. Included are a few photographs of half-decent vehicles from my the un-exciting event.   I took this one because of my conversation with Dave. He wants to become a Pimp.    Hands down stupidest vehicle at the show, the "cool bus"  ...I would have probably included more...but they would just be a waste of server space.
