      i just wanna remind everyone to vote ndp tomorrow. and believe me, it takes a lot for me to encourage voting. i do believe that it is critical at this point to vote rather than pretend there will be any real participatory democracy anytime soon.   so go vote, don't smoke!!!  (NDP, that is)

      i am all about unionizing stay-at-home moms, but i don't know about letting go of the term scab. it does hurt people's feelings, and it should. i also really like thehealing circles, hot-air balloon rides and hemp. my favorite is by far the touch therapy replacement and i think their strategy for dealing with the homeless would make a good pie conversation. i hope everyone is well.  Healing Circles’ to replace current judicial system. “This idea is going to save us a huge amount of money and feel good for everyone. My motto is: ‘Let’s talk it out!’ And we’re going to convert the prisons into hostels for vacationing backpackers. Talk about fun!”  Unionizing stay-at-home Moms. “But if there should ever be a strike, I don’t want to hear the word ‘scab’ being thrown around. That can hurt people’s feelings.”  Free emergency counseling for the lactose intolerant and their families. “This one’s close to my heart, since I am a lactose intolerance sufferer and I know the pain and shame that it can bring.”  Psychic Surgery’ and ‘Touch Therapy’ to replace conventional medical procedures. “We’re cleaning up the health-care system one hug at a time. Just remember: there’s no waiting lists for hugs!”  Hot air rainbow ballooning political summits. “It’s hard to be cranky in a rainbow-shaped hot air balloon! I think the number of wars could be cut in half if peace negotiations were held in balloons.”  Mandatory taxation replaced with the ‘honor system.’ “Everyone will feel much happier when they share their wealth with the rest of the country, instead of having it taken from them.”  Hemp to replace cotton in bank notes. “Of course, smoking an image of the Queen will still be a crime.”  Free low-carb popcorn if you vote for Carl!  But it’s his homeless iniatives that Carl takes the most pride in. “Traditionally the problem has always been that the homeless are seen as incapable of maintaining a normal existence. We think that’s just a bunch of conservative hard cheese. The real problem is that our homeless people lack the technology to compete in today’s fast paced world, so we’re going to issue each and every panhandler on the street Blackberries and Power Books. It’s time we brought our street people into the twenty-first century and made them able to compete with the tough overseas market. There are like a 1000 homeless people to every one of ours in India.* If we don’t do something to get our homeless operating at peak efficiency then they will go the way of the auto or garment industries.”

      Hi everyone,  Is it true? Are we having the return of the agricola method? Are we going to come together and fight corporate crime together? Save our health together? Have a return to so-so-solidarity?   Smoking American Ciggies the last week and a half has left me winded and depressed.   I am seriously considering--yet, my mind is saying one thing, while my body (ie hand and mouth) keep doing another.  Ain't that always the way.  Did you know that tobacco companies spend more than 5 billion each year on advertising? We must resist the temptation, to be delivered from evil, for thine is the....you get the point.  xoxoxoxox Robin

      the power of the agricola-method stays strong. i gave solidarity to the strikers today. so in tradition, do not be a scab. but along those lines, it has been well over ten days since i have inhaled any herbal remedies. i think i deserve to get high. how's the no smoking going? way to go k and frank!  and amy!!! i hope you are keeping yourselves busy, smoke-free. living clean, so-to-speak.  does anyone care to join me for some mis-adventures at the multi-cultural fest. this weekend? i will be going first thing sunday and there will be some capoeira madness with some solid people who make me blush.  plus, bellydance performances all weekend.  so don't say you have nothing to do. not that you would, productivity is up, by the looks of things. i feel disconnected. oh right, i am a scab. later.

      It is a rainy, cold day in Halifax, and I am drinking Bass beer from England.  Ah, life is grand.  I wish to take this opportunity to remark that today marks two weeks that I have gone without smoking.  Yes, sir.  I would also venture to thank many things that have helped me through these last two weeks, such as pastis, ouzo, beer, gummi bears, bicycles, barbecues, white primer paint, and drywall compound.  Thank you all.  Only you know how much you mean to me.  Especially the gummi bears.  You know best of all.

      Well hello, (fellow non-smokers), my you all look wonderful today. This is my first yet belated posting...sorry. I don't exactly have internet usage in near proximity...a blessing or a curse?... So, not smoking is no joke, that's for sure. Goddamn heroin that's what it is. Now I see that for sure. But... will I never ever be able to smoke again?....hmmm, smoking is cool. That cannot be denied. But so is skating without a helmet and that's just pure, plain as yogurt, stupid. Last weekend was the weekend of not smoking from hell. Everytime "they" went out for "a smoke" my insides stirred, saying something like "feed me nicotine....feed me nicotine". It is hard, I swear to God. Amani, what's up? You did this before...you can do it...how did you do it? Damn...

      Well I smoked like an old pro this weekend.  Smoke, smoke, smoke, smoke, smoke.  BUT, I quit again today. I refuse, however, to take the no smoking meter off of my webpage. I will, however, wind it back 5 days. I will not admit defeat, I will though admit weakness and I plea 'temporary insanity'...

      agricola-method has proved it's effectiveness in that r and molly-tov have been free of herbal remedies now over a week. one week for molly-tov and eight days for r. thanks for all the love and support people. we may not be self-actualized in that our tobacco use is still rampant, yet our desire and drive to quit will prevail. all in good time, comrades. one thing i would suggest avoiding if you are not smoking is silkscreening. be well!

      I took the Eritrean tooth sticks that Moon gave me and have begun experimenting on how to coax them back to life.  I call it Operation Frankenstick.  It is being carried out deep in the lairs of Castle Frank.  I lightly humidified the sticks overnight.  Today I cut one end off to open up the pores.  Then I stuck them in a jar with miracle-grow, truly a miraculous product.  At the same time I gooped green ooze stuff, a.k.a Rooting Compound, on key spots.  The sticks are now in a dark place, awaiting transformation from tooth stick to Frankenstick.

      Well, it looks like I am pretty much now alone and most people around have capitulated.  "It ain't easy bein' green", as Kermit D. Frog used to say.  But this morning I woke up and my lungs feel great.  I feel great, despite the Ouzo last night, and that's because I haven't been smoking.  I will not give in - but you guys will understand if I don't hang around at smoking parties as much as I used to.  Hopefully we'll find some smoke-free way of interacting like going for a walk or throwing gummi bears around.

      Smokin'... See the thing about quitting smoking is that I don't ever really want to. I've been 'quit' for a week now and I hate it. I know the REAL reason I want to smoke is because I'm addicted but the reasons that I'm telling myself in denial have nothing to do with being addicted.  I was remembering a friend today who was so graceful, elegant, and beautiful. When she smoked her girlie cigarettes you felt like they were beautiful and graceful too. I want a pack and I want to take a slim lovely out of it and smoke it with all of the grace I have in me. Unfortunately I am not so graceful and I just want the smoke.  Someone told me the other day that in Cuba, where waaaaaay more people smoke, their average age of death is only like 2 years less than ours, and they're the crappy years anyway. So smoking takes 10 years from your life expectancy, well, I don't really look forward to 70-80 or 80-90 anyway. I'd rather smoke my smokes now and enjoy them than have to have my diaper changed by my own child, or maybe even a stranger in a 'home' I was put in.  Anyway, so I'm still not smoking and I'll do my best not to but god damn, I really fucking want one. JUST ONE (the crying plea of the addict)  AAAAH.

      Yes, Calgary lost.  So sad.  What can I say after watching the most hockey ever in my life only to see the team lose?  (Well, to be honest, I had been rooting for the Canadiens, but that's a secret.)  At least I can report that I drank a decent amount of liquour and did not give in (nor have) any urge for a cigarette.  Tomorrow is a new day.  Maybe we should focus on the upcoming election.  I will vote for the person with the best haircut.

      Finally I am feeling some positive results.  See, I've been sick since the day before I quit with a massive chest cold (I'm sure worsened by quitting) and have yet to feel any sort of positive change in my body. Until, that is, last night when I decided to meet KiKi in town for a drink. I got there on my bicycle with ease and on the way home I felt like Wonder Woman. I was peddling like there was no tomorrow. Half way up steep hills and like a bat out of hell down straightaways. It was great. Now I was still a little winded when I got home but that I believe is because I'm a lazy ass bastard, not in fact because I am a smoker. Cause I AM NOT!! My lungs felt bigger and stronger and more able to help my feeble body through aerobic exercise.   There are benefits to this after all.   Ahhh. I needed something like this or I was going to crack .

I went to an antique show today, but wasn't especially focussed on the antiques.  Actually, images of food that I ate in Japan keep coming to mind, and I find myself craving some things that I didn't even like very much.  Anyways, enough about food.  Right now, if I break down, it will be for a hamburger before a cigarette.

      Yes. The rumours are true. I capitulated on the whole quit smoking thing...not for good though, my friends, not for good.  I figured that after quitting drinking and chemicals for over four years (and p-t off and on, of which I am back off of) that quitting smoking (this was my first attempt) would be not too bad.  Not so.  Smoking is so addictive, and the idea that tobacco companies target their advertising toward children (they need to make new addicts every day in order to keep their profits up) sickens me.  Maybe it would help if Amy, Frank and Moon posted some tricks and tips that helped them prepare for the quit---I know Frank slowly was weaning himself away....but I need some more. I have been trying that, but from what I have read, that doesn't always work.   I am going back on the patch again soon.  I don't like feeling toxic.

      There are more important things than having fun.  Not smoking is one of them.  Which is why I have forgone the chance to hang out with a bunch of people I would like to and am going to watch another movie.  Gotta wait until I'm confident, not obsessing about smoking, willing to forget about it even while surrounded by it.    In other news, I got RAM for my computer today.  I wonder on what day I will have made my money back from not smoking...

      The first Agricola Method was a conspiracy, I am sorry to say.  Moon, Amy, and myself organized the whole charade just to get your 10 bucks.  So cough up *cough, cough* dah money!!  We're going to invest it in a stock with Phillip Morris.  Because after seeing some people fold like cardboard boxes, we decided the tobacco industry is still a good horse.  The *REAL* Agricola Method is being practised at the "other", i.e. the REAL, Agricola Street location (did you notice that Molly-Tov's place isn't even on Agricola??)  The *REAL* Agricola Method involves two special components.  The first one, which I will take the liberty of revealing to my faithful readers free-of-cost, is simple:  WILL POWER  Yes, that's right. And the second critical element in the delivery of the *REAL* Agricola Method is, well, we call it "The Thirteenth Step".  An information booklet detailing The Thirteenth Step is available to you at a one-time low-cost price of $29.99.  (Applicable taxes extra)  We also take stocks in Phillip Morris in lieu of payment.

      Well, I don't know if I should say anything, since you guys seem to think that I'm not a real smoker, but I know that I've failed quitting smoking more than some of you guys, when I knew better, no less.  YEAH, and rocking and rolling doesn't mean that you can roll right back into being addicts - slaves to the hellishness of body affliction.    If you haven't smoked yet, you did the right thing.  If you have, then well ... we really do not know what to say.  And believe us we tried.    Sometimes you gotta roll, but mostly you gotta rock.  And we love rockers.  Rock out and be strong.  P.S. Did I mention that Mullak has been typing this.  Mostly.  Except for the first part.  And a little bit in the middle.  And that's it.  Except for this too.  And nothing else.    Really.

Alternative #288    grow something  Alternative #187      Be excited (note to self--learn to operate camera)  Alternative #976      Read a book  (play with buttons on the camera)

      I'm heading to video difference in half an hour to pick up a movie.  The movie is unknown, but the location is certain.  My place.  Is this a part of the Agricola Method?  Only the initiates know for sure.    Francis

      Fasting for a day helps your body repair damage.  It also helps detoxify.  Fasting is also a way to practice self-control.  It is about exercising your mind and placing it in control of your body.  All the religions with which I am familiar incorporate some degree of fasting as a spiritual practice.  Islam, Christianity, Buddhism, First Nations spirituality.  I think fasting could be a useful way to promote greater will power and help quit smoking.  I will try a short water fast from Saturday 6pm until Monday 10am.

      hihi. so today is evil. for everyone. i am very contemplative over this whole thing, it is hard to stay focused. i am afraid to go out. this is the first nice day outside in so long and i have been hiding inside these walls all day. i know you are all with me though so i feel relieved in that sense. i think we need to stay committed. we need to ignore our oldselves and become aquainted with our new(non-smoking)selves. we are healthier already and that is important. i wish i had some better words but it is hard to think. rise up!

      6th Day without Caffeine, 3rd without Nicotine.  I can feel my body detoxifying.  My lungs are clearing out already.  I am coughing, even though I didn't smoke last night.  I think I am coughing to get rid of toxins in my lungs.  I just want to say how important last night was for me.  Firstly, Calgary won.  Secondly, I broke the pattern of drinking and then giving into smoking.  It feels great to get schlammered in a smoke-free environment, go home NOT reeking like a cheesy bar, get a night of quality sleep NOT interrupted by the wafting gross smell of cigarette stench in my hair, NOT having a head-pounding cigarette hangover.    Instead I feel lovely.  It's a sunny day.  I am going for a walk to work for a few hours.  I will see if the Gummi Bear that I stuck to Alexander Keith's grave is still there.  The Bear that I threw against the side of the Kwik Mart is still there after three days!  The Gummi represents our resilience and determination in quitting smoking.  Gummi Guerillas of the World, Unite!

      Last night was the worst. I am so unhealthy right now. From 3:30am to 12:00pm I was unable to get more than 5 minutes of sleep at a time. I just coughed and coughed and coughed and coughed. My head is pounding and I can't believe that my body is reacting this way. I feel like dog poo but I can't start smoking again cause then I'll have to do this all over again. Who wants to do this twice, three times, or four? Not me. A smoke sure would make me feel better though. I am one cranky bitch. Good luck today everyone. Don't let the weekend break you.

      It's cheese, but it's not processed, it's real:    Sometimes we have negative thoughts about ourselves or our situation ("This is unbearable, I don't think I can do this" or "I feel awful, why am I doing this to myself?"). The more people engage in negative self-talk, the less likely they will stop smoking. If you catch yourself using negative self-talk, say the word "stop" to yourself. Take a moment to clear your mind and then replace the negative talk with positive self-talk.  Examples of positive self-talk include:      * It will get better in time.     * I've handled things tougher than this.     * What I feel is evidence that my body is healing itself.     * I don't have to smoke. I can do something else right now.     * I only have to deal with one day at a time.    I got this from a quit smoking page, the one with 'Bob' the quit soking guy on TV...

      i am on the verge of tears right now. i have been physically ill all day. symptoms include: chronic head throbbing, upset stomach, (borderline puking)hot and cold flashes that are so hot i'm sweating and so chilled i'm freezing and my teeth are shattering. this involves a lot of taking off/putting on clothes. my house is a disaster so sorry for that people. i am a mess and the clutter in my house is the clutter in my mind. i am scared. this whole process has forced me to re-examen my choices in life and evaluate my health... so many people are suffering so badly and then they take drugs to alleviate their pain. well i never realized how much damage caffeine/nicotine were doing to my body until now. while we can, we must choose health. choose life.

      I have barely left the apartment, except for a trip to the supermarket.  sleeping as much as possible is an important part of my regimen, and staying up as late as possible for no good reason too.    The ultimate goal - forgetting that I'm trying to quit anything.   The penultimate goal - not smoking.  Why is not smoking a lesser goal then forgetting about it?  Well, since I'm not smoking now, that goal has been achieved.  As long as I'm not thinking about it, I'm not going to smoke.  I'm not going to fall walking down the street and accidentally land face first on a lit cigarette.  But if I'm thinking about it enough, sooner or later one of the times that I'm thinking about it will be when my mind is weak and making excuses.  Oh, the excuses.  A vast arsenal of them just waiting for the right moment to take root and convince your mind that it's ok to have 'just one'.  Well, here are a few excuses that I think make it ok to smoke.  1. You're over 75 or are facing a certain and imminent death (no longer than 2 years away with no hope for a cure).  2. You're undergoing surgery without anaesthetic (piercing and tattooing don't count).  3. Smoking is an integral element of a MacGyveresque attempt to save the world/drive out the tyrants of a small Latin American village/prevent a nuclear meltdown (must have written permission from Richard Dean Anderson).  I would like to point out that just because one person squeals like a pig and goes 'wee wee wee' all the way back to cigarettes, it doesn't give anyone else an excuse to quit.  Excuses are for babies.    Hmmm, I wonder when my desire for the money is going to kick in and I'm going to start encouraging smoking amongst my comrades....

      Ok, so we've had a folder. That means we need to be EXTRA strong, don't let it bring you down.    Kama  - you can quit again right after each smoke you know.  Don't get down on yourself. You can always rejoin the crusade  (if you want to of course!!)

      all the things you never wanted to know....   urlLink What's in a cigarette? Fact Sheet no. 12 - ASH    last night was a close one. we kept trying to rationalize why it would be ok to smoke only one (because we love ourselves, and deserve a reward at the end of the day) but we did not give in. We kept hoping someone else would give in so that we could all fold like cardboard boxes in the rain...but alas, everyone stayed strong. (Despite pro-smoking advocates infiltrating the comment section...tee-hee)  Ok, my house is on the road to being cleaner than it ever was before.  Oh, and I told my mom and dad about day one, increasing the pressure tenfold...why, of why did i do that?  xoxoxo  Team meeting tonight?

      Last night was a true test in every sense of the word. There was booze, there were joints, and there were cigarettes a plenty. I was driven mad with desire. It consumed every part of my being. My body was in ang, my head in disarray. I was never more tempted.   A word to the wise, hold off on hanging out in a cloud of second hand smoke until you're good and strong. Last night was a sweet smelling nightmare. But, alas, with some help from my friends I made it. Smoke free and proud of it.   Let me tell you though, it was a close call - a very close call.  Stay strong folks, though it even sounds like a load of crap when I say it to myself, it really will pay off in the end.    Top 3 excuses of recent time:  1. Well, we're sitting here in a cloud of second hand smoke, we sure aren't getting any healthier, defeating the purpose. Might as well light one up. - Amy  2. Isn't it possible that the stress we are causing to our bodies and minds is worse than the health risks associated with smoking? - Keiran  3. I don't need one I just really want one. It's not because I'm addicted, I just really want one. - Every smoker trying to quit

      well surprise, another grey day ahead for our struggle. the first day is complete and we can look ahead, just keep moving forward and don't look back. we are all ten dollars richer, too, i might add. today we will be twenty dolloar richer. not that that matters - it doesn't. our health and sanity and freedom is what matters. there is a good french documentary called cigarette, maybe we should watch it together to get inspired. cioa fellow commrades.

      hello world. good-bye smokes. hello productivity. good-bye procrastination. hello clear-mindedness. good-bye clutter.   we must stand united and be the change we wish to see in the world. fuck-you corporate ciggy factories and government tax bureaucracy. we are free now. free from the toxins and clear-cutting mentality behind ciggy production. free from the heavy weight of our nicotine addictions and free from our guilty conscious which has been conflicted since we started selling our souls. maybe it's true that no amount of money will ever buy back our souls, but maybe we can start anew. we can re-invent ourselves and oursouls with our new-found sobriety. a clean slate, so to speak. we can no longer support big buisness in our slow prolonged and painful social suicide methods. we must embrace new methods. we are mere particals now belonging to something much bigger than ourselves. we are part of the revolt that says no more capitalist mis-adventures. no more buying salvation becuase we know, now, that salvation cannot be bought. in solidarity, cyborgs.

      The first day of quitting usually is one of the easiest. Not true today.   I awoke, suddenly, at 8:30 (unnatural for me) to BANG BANG BANG BANG, over and over and over right outside my second storey bedroom window. My landlord had his hired goons start rebuilding the roof over the front porch at the crack of crow piss. I tried two pillows over my head shoved into my ear with my elbow to no avail. If I had of had a shot gun...  oh boy.  Luckily for them I did not but man 'o' man did I ever want a smoke. Now that the headache has subsided and my intensely cranky mood is on it's way out I remember... Smoking isn't a cure all, it's a temporary fix and we will be stronger without them.   The boys on the porch would not have driven me any less close to insanity if I had smoked a cigarette.  Moral of this story - You don't  NEED  a smoke, you just want one. You don't really just want one, you're just addicted. Show that habit who's boss. Who controls your reigns?? You or a smoking stick of cancer.   YOU DO...  WE DO...   Cheers to the first smoke free day.

      All the support people want to give us would be welcome. Like, if you wanted to stop by headquarters and perform a song and dance, or teach us a new skill (c'mon, you are good at something), or bring us food. Or you could just provide serious adulations (sincere or otherwise) for us all....that sounds nice to me.    If you wish to get in on the project just let us know and we can sign you up.

      there is smoking madness going on at this point--we can't get enough....reality is starting to sink in.....  there is a cloud of smoke hanging over this end of agricola.   A mournful, contemplative silence occurs every so often (as the afore mentioned reality comes to the forefront) after we imagine butting out the end of that last ciggy (oh so soon).  Moon just suggested buying an O2 tank to make the transition process a little bit easier. Cyborg is convinced that there is an O2 bar here in hali somewhere.  Me...I ain't convinced of anything at this point. This may seem a bit melodramatic and all, but fuck it? Why not. I am all about it.

If you have been a watcher/participatant/cheerleader for/with us then don't be put off by the fact that some of us are weak, very weak. Frank Castle and Kiki are still going strong... and so can you!
