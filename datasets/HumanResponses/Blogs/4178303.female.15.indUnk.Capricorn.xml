      I'm bored outa my mind and have been depressed for the past week.  Don't ask why, I have no clue. Jamie and Jenny are leaving to go to Tennessee on Monday and my mom is going down there on Tuesday with Aunt Rene.  When Tonya comes back; me, her, and her bf Matt are supposed to see Anchorman. ttyl byebye

      This is my song for the day, Crush by:Mandy Moore-                                                                      You do everything I wish I did.   Everybody wants you, everybody loves you.  I know I should tell you how I feel.  I wish everyone will disappear.  Everytime you call me, I'm too scared to be me.  And I'm too shy to say; *I got a crush on you.  I hope you feel the way that I do.  i get a rush when I'm with you.  Ooh, I got a crush on you, a crush on you*  You know I'm the one that you can talk to.  Sometimes you tell me things that I don't want to know, I just want to hold you.    You say exactly how you feel about her.  I wonder could you ever think of me that way.   *I got a crush on you.  I hope you feel the way that I do.  I get a rush when I'm with you.  Ooh, I got a crush on you, a crush on you.*  Ooh I wish I could tell somebody, But there's no one to talk to, Nobody knows I've got a crush on you, a crush on you, I got a crush.  You say everything that you're afraid to feel. How I always want you, I will always love you.  *I got a crush on you.  I hope you feel the way that I do.  I get a rush when I'm with you.  Ooh, I got a crush on you, a crush on you. I got a crush on you.  I hope you feel the way that I do. I get a rush when I'm with you.  Ooh, I got a crush on you!

      Hey all! Thanks to those of you who are helping to raise money for Nick's medical needs and such! Me and my mom counted coins around the house last night and came up with $258. The Bent Not Broken concert had an okay amount of $65, but that's okay. If you have any bottles, cans, and such, please contact me. We could use all the help we can get! Tonight I found out that Nick's doctor said he has a 95% chance of living and is doing great! I just got off the phone with William and he said thanks a bunch! Love y'all and keep up the good work!

      Today i got my hair done again at Capri, where Kim works at. We got some more news about Nick today. He had some tests done and has acute Leukemia and will be in the hospital for around a month. He has a lump in his chest that needs to be removed. Please continue to pray for Nick and his family, aspecially William, his loving twin. I hope that I will be able to come down there in a while to visit them. Shane and Jamie will be coming home tonight and will hear the news. I love you Nick and William, and will be forever praying for you guys! Be brave and strong about this evil that the devil has put upon you. You will get through it and be yourself again. I will give word to my family and friends down in Tennessee. Love ya'll, ~Sarah

      OMG!! I learned my lesson tonight. I was talking to this guy, Aria, he's Jason's girlfriend's cousin. We got along good when we went to South Carolina last year and became friends. Well, when I went to Tennessee this summer, his family was at Jesse and Cassie's wedding. They told me that he had a crush on me and I got all excited. Well, I talked to him and asked him if it was true and told him to be honest. He said no and he has a girlfriend! How embarrassing!! I feel like crap now!~sarah

      Shane is coming home tomorrow from fishing up north with Jamie. Sorry that he missed your birthday party today, Eric! He'll make it up to you, I promise. I guess he forgot about it, otherwise he would have went. Good luck to the people who are going on the Real Life camping trip tomorrow morning! Have fun! Me and Janae aren't going. lol We may go to the mall instead, so if you wanna go, just call me. Random thought-William, I miss you and want you to come up here as soon as possible!:) lol Please pray for me and Shane, whoever is reading this. We've been going through some very tough things dealing with past mastakes and friend relationships. It isn't going too well for me. Thanks for all of your sampathy (you know who you are). Love ya guys! God Bless~Sarah

      I love my friends put sometimes I don't like what they do.  I guess no one's perfect, but why does she have to be so immature?  Sometimes I just wanna choke her and tell her to stop but our families our so close, that I can't really say anything to her.

      A lot of times I get jealous over stupid stuff. I get mad when my close friends are dating someone when I can't even get someone to like me. I know this is a bad habit, but I can't help it.
