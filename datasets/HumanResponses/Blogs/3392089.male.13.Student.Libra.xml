      I understand that you couldn't stay on the phone.  The reason I was like hold on is because I never got to say 143.  Which was a let down but thats okay.  I love you so much that only 3 numbers can describe it 143!  Anyways I talked with Mrs. Thornley and she said that the ibooks have maintance problems like on the batter it juts out. So it looks like I'll be paying 1599.  Good news is that I know someone who  is intrested in the emac.  I dont know how I'll live without a computer!  Oh well always look at the glass half full!  I'll Call ASAP 143 iBrad

      Frankly you could let your dad read all of our posts and I wouldn't give a shit.  You know why?  Because there is no acception to what he did to you and your family.  And I understand how you feel about all of this because as you know mydad is an asshole too! I Love You -iBrad

      I am so sorry that I haven't talked to you in a long time it's just that I've been so busy unpacking.  The only reason I am able to type this is because of the fact were like a mile or less from the Library.  So I just wanted to say I love you! -iBrad

      Dear Rachel, This last year has been a very exhausting experience for me.  What I mean to say is that it has been a rough road to drive on these last few months.  For instance in February I was really depressed about it being one year since my mom's death.  Or like how your father is treating your mother.  And things like my father getting remarried to Cecilia.  But I believe it is these type of experiences that shape a relationship.  I think that the two of us being together has helped both of us in ways that we don't realize.  But there have been rough times together like when we were at the fitness center and there have been good times like last Wednesday.  I think together that both of us combined can face any problem that comes our way.  So the one quote I will make is "Our relationship will last!"  I love you ever so much Rachel Trahan! -Bradley Steven Sigmund Levy-  P.S. Sorry my yearbook signature wasn't that long!

      I'm so glad you liked my last post.  But there is one secret I need to tell you.  I wasn't lying!  It is honestly the truth seriously I love you so much that I can't express it.  And to tell you the truth I would even jump in front of a bullet to save you even if that caused me to dye it was worth.  You have been the best girlfriend I have ever had.  I think our relationship will never split and I'm so glad because I love you too much.  And I had people say why do you go out with a fat girl and you no what I'd say.  "Well goddamnit I'm proud of her!"  It takes a strong person to live through the things we've been through.  And you think I really care what people think about your wait a lets see...NO!  The only thing I care about is that you stay the way you are and keep your heart pure of love and passion and don't let an asshole like Robert Trahan get in the way of YOUR life.  You have no Idea how proud I am to have you as my girlfriend.  In fact,the only time I care about your weight is when it involves your feelings or health that's all that matters to me.  I really don't know how I would get through my life without you.  So Dear Rachel I love you.  And always will!! -iBrad
