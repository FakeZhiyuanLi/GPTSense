      The following prospectus outlines the strategic value of targeting and eliciting potential clients whom require graphic design services, particularly focusing on and establishing long term, fulfilling business relationships.  The promotional tools to be used are simple, yet, insightful and easily recognizable logos, via adhesive form.  These "stickers" display the unique and easily identifiable logo of Paola Zamora, utilizing her self-designed Frek initiative.  They are to be placed in publicly accessible areas frequently visited by potential clients.  These locations are to be established using a marketing analysis model which is threefold. Primarily, the model will determine ideal candidates for Frek services, including but not limited to size of business, type of business, and place of business.  Secondarily it will identify locations these potential clients may visit either with the intention of finding graphic design services and/or utilizing undercover marketing procedures. Tertiary, the analysis should also provide geographic and demographic background as well.   The adhesives contain the following information leading clients to the web address of business services provided by Paola Zamora, through Frek design.

      				   The philosophical foundation of my project relies on providing the highest quality graphic Design using the most cost effective strategy. Thus providing frek design clientele, the most unique and sophisticated design work while not requiring a budget of a mega-sized corporate giant. The main focus of the foundation will be the clientele, Frek design can be utilized in any shape or form by small, medium and large businesses. Frek design will target from existing companies that are looking for design work such as annual reports and also individuals who are looking for small design work such as business cards.  The process begins with self-promotional stickers that display the unique and easily identifiable logo of my self along with a web address. These stickers are to be distributed at networking events and, they will also be placed in frequently visited locations by potential clients: stores bars etc. Frek design is a company that offers graphic design solutions. The products available for sale are logos, layout, corporate identity, annual reports, brochures, and advertising. All of these categories will be tailored specifically for each client. The service provided would become obvious to client at the time they visit my self-promotional site, which contains a portfolio. The ideal would be to establish freelancing jobs and future long-term relations with the clients.    As the CEO of Frek design I recognize the need for small businesses. The Clients experience is improved significantly when they receive great service. Observing large corporations that offer multiple services treat my work carelessly as a student, made me realize how important it is to keep clients happy. The graphic design market is a very competitive one, the assurance of work done well and on time, must be a priority.  The logo of Frek design was created during my senior year at The Art Institute of Washington, the idea for frek design as a company has been growing since the beginning of my career.  The distinctiveness of frek began with the idea of freak, but with a positive approach, creating a new meaning for frek: non-conformist and eccentric design.  The second logo I created is a self-portrait. It is more playful than the typographic oriented frek, I have decided to use the self portrait as an icon along with the frek logo as an accompaniment. Both the logo and the icon have received positive reactions from people, the living dead dolls were a major influence while creating the self-portrait.   One of the alternative procedures, have been to actually distribute my self- promotional package that already exists. It consists on a clear box with a business card, paper clip and work samples in it. I have also decided to create a website because it is essential as part of my self-promotion. The web site will be built in flash. I’m amply excited about the quarter end project, as I have mentioned before, I plan on actually distributing the stickers and I expect potential clients to visit the site by the end of the quarter,

      The primary rationale behind this project consists of three aspects: cost effectiveness, ease of implementation, and wide variation of targeting specific clientele. The actual monetary cost should be minimal due to materials to be used (adhesives), and like wise the design of the logo has already been completed therefore reducing the potential cost even greater. Thus with more funds available to purchase the adhesives, the quantity will be greater, effectively, raising the ability to reach a greater portion of potential clients. Assuming the success of the campaign this will result in a greater market-share in the future.  The ease of implementation will assist in creating a “buzz” among clients needing creative graphic design work preformed.   Congruently, the ease of implementation will allow for decision making to be “on the spot” this includes being able to decide where and how the adhesive will be located and usually accessible. The wide variation of potential advertising sites is a further extension of “implementation” increasing the accessibility for potential clientele.   This project helps to achieve two goals, which are the foundations of frek design:  • To provide the highest quality graphic design while respecting and focusing on the client.  • Engaging the client with this business philosophy introduces the second pillar of frek design, to build long-standing business relationships, not quick business deals.    This project is unique not only because of its marketing and networking strategy but also due to the highly specialized and strategic targeting to the consumer it allows. The stickers will lead clients to the website that will be designed.  The project relies solely on the development of a self-promotional website, the distribution of the stickers and the market analysis that will be performed. The stickers are not permanent, they will be easily removed from any surface.  The cost will total an amount of $15,000.00.  (The actual cost of the stickers will be $100.00.)
