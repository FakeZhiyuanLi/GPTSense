      Ok so wow, I know I haven't updated my blog in long time.  I have been really busy though and I was gone the past two weeks.  So much has happened in that time.  The first week I was at band camp which was amazing.  I had a great time.  I met so many new friends.  Dani and I made up.  Yes I said it.  She apologized first of course though.  I won a scholorship so I get to back for free next year.  I had 9 solos in the whole concert.  I couldn't believe it! I got to do a jazz ballad that featured me which was cool cause I have never gotten to do that.  Well anyways I will move on because I don't want to make this too long.  The following week I left for Indiana with Sarah and Ryan.  We went and stayed the night at her Aunt's house.  It was fun, I got to sleep the whole way down which was nice.  Sarah's aunt was really nice and her cousin was cool too.  The next day we went to camp.  Camp was amazing, I am so glad I went.  The first few days were a little tough.  I wasn't having that much fun and I wasn't sure if I would want to go back.  Then I started to have more fun and I started to grow closer to God which was amazing.  I am so glad that all of my friends talked me into going because I don't think I would have went if they hadn't pushed me.  I wasn't sure if going to one camp after the next was going to be wise, but I am so happy I did it.  That camp has so many awesome people there and they helped me come closer to God.  Now that camp is over I think I would really like to go on a missions trip somewhere.  Well thats what I have been doing these past two weeks.  They were definetly well spent.  They were some of the best weeks of my life.  Today on the other hand wasn't so great.  I had to work and I think everyone knows how I feel about work sometimes.  I hate it.  We were so busy and stupid people were working so I had no one helping me fill orders.  It sucked and on top of that I had the usual dumb customers who are retarded and don't know how to order at a McDonalds.  Sometimes I like work though, people that come through like Ethel can really brighten your day and those customors are the ones that remind you why you work there.  Well I think thats about it, 3 novels later. haha I think I am going to go know and enjoy the nice summer weather.

      Hey, Yeah my day was pretty boring. I worked 9-5, which sucked. Lately, I have been getting angry at my job. The customers have been getting on my nerves. I think someone needs to write a book "How to order food at McDonalds for Dummies".  You wouldn't believe some of the things people say that come through there. Just ask BethAnne about some of her expierences there. But anyways, off the negative work situation. I am getting so excited about going to band camp. I called my friend from Hale thats going, she is really excited too. I also can't wait for payday on friday. I need some money, I am about broke. My dad gave me $5 which I found exciting cause I had like $6 left. As you can see my day was just too exciting. But wait, it gets better. I got home and practiced my trumpet for a long time, something I haven't done in a while. It was intense. I am such a band geek! Oh well, I don't care, I enjoy it! I don't see how anyone couldn't enjoy band. Music is an awesome thing. That was pretty much my day. Ohh wait,lol my dad made awesome steaks tonight on the grill. They were really good! The one benefit of having cows, the great meat. Well I think I am going to go to bed soon.

      Hey,So this is the start of my blog. How exciting! Well today was alright. I had a tough time getting out of bed for jazz band, but it was worth it, as always. Sarah didnt show up which was disappointing. After that I went home and got in a fight with my mom...yes I said it. It was bad too. Of course she said she was sorry, so its all good now. Then I went to the beach with my sister and Gage. That was fun, the water was awesome. It was a perfect day to go to the beach. My 8-year old cousin was there and I played with him in the water. He is a crazy kid. I have bible study tonight which is fun. It's always interesting. So I am hungry, suprise suprise. I don't think I can ever be full. I just eat and eat.  Wow, its amazing how much you can write about your day in these things. This is cool. I like the idea of them.  Well as fun as this is I am going to get going. I just spent like a 1/2 hour on the youth group forum which was intense. It was an awesome idea to start. But anyways yeah that was basically my day.

      So I have been bad I haven't blogged in a while.  I feel horrible.  Actually not really.  Friday I worked and went to the church campout.  It was fun.  Sarah and I were hott and stayed at her house.  It was nice, I slept really good.   The next day I worked and then went back to the camp.  Sarah, Alecia, Ryan, Leslie, Monica and I all played Dutch Blitz.  It was so much fun.  That game is awesome.  The next day all of us went to our church service outside.  It was alright.  Sarah was really moved by the reading of Autum's poems.  After that I had the best rasberry pie ever.  It was so good.  I can't stop talking about it.  I think the pie was the best part of my day.  Today not much happened. Guess what I did...work! I know thats suprising.  It seems like all I ever do is work.  I hate it.  But hey it is nice to have money.  I am pumped for the disney marathon coming up.  Sarah, Alecia, Ryan and I are all have a disney movie marathon.  We are only watching the classics.  Old school disney.  Well I think I am going to go.

      Well as you can tell I am very excited for our church campout.  Sarah is really pumped though, Alecia and me were discussing how she just won't stop talking about it.  I am going to Sarah's house after I am done doing this.  Today has been alright.  I had to work but it wasn't too bad.  I got payed today!!!  My check was $228.  I was pleased.  It was so hard to get up for work today.  I was really tired and my bed was extremely comfortable.  Lately it has been cold and I don't know how I feel about that.  I like wearing hoodies but it is supposed to be summer right now.  This is the time of the year when I go to the beach.   I hope it warms up.  Well I have to get going.  Today wasn't a long blog.

      Well today I had to work 8-12 which was nice.  Four hour shifts go by so quick.  Our managers told Ashley and me that if we got our times in drive-thru down to 40 seconds that they would give us two dollars.  Well we were running all over and freaking out trying to get our times down.  It was fun and it was all worth it.  We got our times down to 30 seconds without cheating!!!  Our manager didn't have enough though so we got a dollar and a gold card for a free sandwhich.  So work went well today.  Pay day is tomorow, I am excited!  Well the rest of my day hasn't been that exciting.  I came home and took and shower and practiced the French Horn.  I have been online since.  I talked to Alecia and Sarah.  I am in an intense game of online pool with my friend Beth right now.   Tonight I have a student concil meeting at H&H.  It is at 6 and Mrs.Ballien is going to be there.  Won't that be nice. haha right!  I can't believe school starts in two weeks.  That isn't fair.  Well I guess  I am going go.

      Well yesterday was an intense day.  We left at 6:00 for cedar point.  We rode on a charter bus which Norma drove.   We went to BayCity to pick up another family that was riding with us.  That family was so annoying.  Sarah and me couldn't stand them.  They kept on standing up throughout the ride.  They had thier little girl with them who was annoying.  Anyways though...  We didn't get to cedar point untill like 12, which up set me a little.  Well Sarah and me went off on our own and started with the Raptor.  It was a nice one to start our with.  After that we went to brave the Millenium Force.  It was so awesome.  We rode second car and we held our hands up.  Sarah screamed so loud I couldn't stop laughing.  Our picture turned out hott so we each bought one.  Then we rode the Mantis, Power Tower, Demon Drop, and Disaster Transport which were all okay.  We also rode the Mean Streak which was fun especially we got to enjoy the company of BethAnne freaking out on it. haha  The last one we rode was the Magnum.  The Magnum and Millenium are my favorite rides.  The Magnum was so much fun, I always laugh on it.  The sad part of the trip was that I didn't get to ride Top Thrill Dragster.  I was so disapointed, there was a 4 hour wait.  I still had a good time though.   We didn't get home until 4 in the morning.  I slept the whole way from Ohio to BayCity.  It was nice.  It didn't get up until 11:30 today.  I don't know what I am going to do today.  I might practice my trumpet or go to Sarah's to make some copies of music.  Who knows? I can do whatever I want today as long as it doesn't cost money.  I am broke from Cedar Point.  It is so sad.  Well hey I am going to go.

      We have been having really good weather recently.  It been so sunny lately.  I might go out and tan before I go to work.  Today has been ok so far.  I went to church which was alright.  Sarah and I were extremely tired from yesterdays activities.  We were so busy yesterday I didn't have to time to write about them so I will explain them now.  First we had to get up early for our jazz concert which went well.  Everyone though we sounded so good and we didn't even have the whole jazz band.  Our jazz band is hott!  Well after that we went to bay city so my brother and me could get fitted for our tux's for my sister's wedding.  Then we went to the music store and I bought my "trumpet bible".  The thing is huge and its filled with solos, duets and studies for trumept.  Its awesome.  After that we went to Walmart which is always intense.  Walmart is awesome, I don't know what America would do without it.  Well then we ended the trip with lunch at Fazolis.  We all got thier new pizza which was excellent.  Then we went home and Sarah and I decided to go up to Fairview for the Relief Sale, causally. It was alright.  We hung out with Hannah, Alecia, and her new cat.  Then Sarah and I had some awesome conversations on the ride home.  It was fun.  We watched Sleeping with the Enemy to end the night.  It was an intense day.

      Ok so I haven't done a blog these past two days because I haven't been home a whole lot.  I have been pretty busy.  I had to work which wasn't so bad.  We had our F.O.Rs the past two days.  It is when our owners and supervisors come in and watch us the whole day.  They also time our service. We did really good though.  We scored high 90's in everything.   The rest of my day  I was usually hanging out with Sarah's family at the beach.  It was fun.  Her family is so nice.  We went swimming a lot and played pit and dutch blitz.  We had a good time, they left this morning.   Last night we had our jazz band concert.  It went extremely well.  Everyone said we played awesome.  My mom said she had never enjoyed listening to us more.  It was cool.  I played the best I have played in Jazz Band this summer.  Well thats about all I have been up too.  I am going to go to bed because I have to get up at 7 to get ready for our jazz band concert tommorow.

      Well today was actually a good day.  Probably because I didn't have to work.  I woke up and went to jazz band, which was fun of course.  Band is so awesome.  I am like the biggest band geek I know along with Sarah.  Good times.  I don't know what I would do without band.  It is the only reason I want school to start.  It just won't be the same though without Sarah. Well anyways after jazz band I went to the beach.  Sarah hurried me along and we went to the beach to hang out with her family.  They were really nice.  It was fun hanging out with her cousins.  We went swimming in which I got burned a little.  We played Dutch Blitz which was intense.  We also played ultimate frisbee which is always cool.  I will probably go out there again tommorow.  Sarah's aunt wants me to bring my trumpet but I don't how I feel about bringing it to play for her whole family.  We had lunch and dinner there which was really good.  I love food, I could eat all day.  Later we went to Bible study.  Bible study was fun as always.  It was nice because we actually somewhat talked about stuff that mattered.  Like stuff we want to do to help God.  I am excited, I really hope we can do some of it.  Our youth group I think is getting more fired up which is awesome to see.  Well I think I am going to go to bed because I have to work at 5:30.

      Well not much happened today.  As I predicted last night, work was horrible.  I cleaned my whole shift and everything I did probably won't stay clean long.  I don't care, but they definetly won't be able to make me do it again.  After work I bought myself a side salad which was really good.  I put croutons, bacon bits, chesse, and chicken nuggets on it.  It was really tasty.   I came home and it stormed.  It was pretty bad too.  The thunder was really loud.  I didn't care, I love thunderstorms.  I enjoy them.  I practiced my trumpet which was intense.  Then I polished it.  It really needed it.  I need to get serious about music.  A lot of people think I am good but there is so much I have to work on before I go to college.  After practicing I got on the computer.  I started the CD I am making for Sarah's mom.  It's going to have a bunch of classical spiritual songs.  It will be cool, I am sure she will like it. Tommorow we have jazz band which is exciting.  I can't wait.  Maybe if it is nice I will go to the beach tommorow.  Well I think I am going to go.

      Well today was not very interesting.  I went to church this morning, which was the best part of my day.  I hadn't been to church for the past two weeks so it was nice to go.  Sarah is always hilarious to sit next to during the service.  She always keeps me entertained, her and alecia's pen. haha  Well after church I got to go home for an hour then I went to work.   Well I am sure all of you can guess how that went.  I hated it.  At the end of my shift I had $1200 in my till!  Plus some of the people were arguing and I had to deal with dumb customers.  Sometimes I wonder if God is trying to tell me to look into a new job.  I don't think I would like any other job though in this town.  I also get pretty good pay and hours at McDonalds.  I just don't like some of the people that work there.  So many of them aren't going anywhere in thier lives(imagine that, thats probably why they are at McDonalds)  It seems like so many of them just care about getting stoned, drunk, etc.  Its depressing sometimes.  On the other hand I feel like I should stay there for the sake of some of my regular customers and so I can at least help the place to run half-way smooth.  I don't know.  It seems like such a stupid situation, but I really hope God helps me through it.   Anyways tommorow isn't going to be any better, because I have to clean the whole day.  I have a list with 73 things to do.  Thats inviting huh?  I am so not looking forward to it.  Hopefully it won't be hard.  Who knows, maybe it will be better than dealing with customers.  Well that was a pretty depressing day huh?  Well I got to get to bed since I have to be to work in 10 hours. ughh
