      Hey, its me again. Ive kooled down from the last couple of days and am now just relaxing in front of the computer. Me and my mom have been watching movies non-stop ever since school went out. My mom got this little movie-pass thing at blockbuster, and we get as many movies as we want for only $25 a month. And blockbuster will regret it because in 2 weeks we already got more movies that would add up to more than $25. Kool. So yea. Ive been goin to the movies too with my friend. Ive seen Shrek 2, Brother Bear, Somethings Gotta Give, Texas Chainsaw Massacre (again), 2 Fast 2 Furious, Cujo, Monster (awesome), The Thing, Dragonfly, Harry Potter 3, Lord of the Rings 3,The last samari, You Got Served. And u wanna know the crazy part. ALL IN 2 WEEKS! Yea so weve been watchin movies movies movies and more movies. But its time for me to clean my room. Yep. At 1:46 AM. Bye

      Hey, its me again. ! minute later after publishing my 3rd post. But yea. i left off saying that they dont know wat ive been through just over the summer. Well here it goes...  This isnt summer but its still something thats gonna damage my mind for a while. August 11, 2003. My dad ask me to clean up the backyard before my first day of school. So i clean, not good enough, So i clean, not good enough,So i clean, not good enough,So i clean, not good enough, finally he loses it and starts yelling at me. "OMFG do i have to fuckin point out every single fucking peice of trash out there." So he takes my neck and pushes it agaisnt the window and also raising me in the air. (i have asthma) I couldnt really breathe so im kicking and trying to shout and my mom and brother come. Thier all yelling at him to put me down so he does but throws me to the ground. -Dont get me wrong. Well not me, My dad-he a good guy. or i wouldnt have shelter, food, clothes, computer, Handspring, alot. This kinda stuff has only happened 3 times. -And sometimes dad doesnt talk very much so alot builds up-. OK... the was the sencond time. The first...  I guess my mom and dad were argueing and they started to fight and mom pulled me into the car and called police and dad was arrested. Thats all i remember. I was young.   But guys, this third one could ruin us... they might get divorced. My dad and mom were yelling and shouting while i was getting directions to a party. I said hold on... ill call u back. and i find my mom and dad fighting for real for first time.My dad had my mom  on ground. Wait...ill leave off right here and talk the rest because im getting tired and i want to finsih this. (but for those who cant listen) I ran and called police, my dad stopped me by takeing the phone. My mom said. Were done. i cant take this anymore. were through. So she tried getting her shoes but it broke out into another fight and then my dad got arrested and he was taken. My sister (had) to bail him and take him somewhere else. So for the rest of the summer im dadless. o well.  Soo. Im tired. Ill be on lata. Like later today because its 3:57 AM and ill probaly be back in 7 hours. hehe. Bye

      Once again im just chillin at my computer typeing up wat ive done over the summer. its been kool. ....U know... wait...wait... im short right... like 4'8" going to High School as freshman. But i believe i have a good personality. Maybe not... But i consider myself a nice person. But let me get to the point. Yesterday and the day before i was talking to this girl LaTonya which like really much. I mean we both cant say love because u know, to young. But I really like her but im not sure if she likes me. So at the end of school dance  or u can say party. Im trying to stay with her because i really wanted to come over to her house (u have a nasty mind). but im always gettin blocked out of her way with some bigger dude. But since i have the coolest mom in the world, she picked me up early for no reason  and brought me home. But before i left i gave LaTonya a hug and i asked her to call me. No Call. So I call up Jessica, one of my other friends and say...Nothin. Shes gone to. But their not out of town. So i call and call but i keep getting "shes not home right now, can i take a message." But I call and call and then one of her friends online tells me that shes home, just doesnt wanna answer u. GRRRRRRR!! That made me pissed. Because i went through alot just over the summer and i need someone to be there to comfotrt me or just to talk to. But then i tried Latonya one last time... Halajleuh!! She picked up and was surprised i called. Ummm. Ive Only been calloing for the past 2 weeks. I guess her family didnt want me to talk to her. But anyway... im talking to her havin a good convo and were just chillin talking. when she says she'll call me back. Surprisingly from her mood she doesnt call back. So i wait till the next day and hear she fell asleep before she could call me back. UmmHmm. So were there talking again and she says can she call me back, my "grandma" is on the phone. No call back. And I still havent called her back. So from hearing all this and letting all this stuff out. Why. Why. Why. Why do girls (not all girls) just playt men like dogs. And for some reason (some) girls think that ALL men will disapoint them. well Scrool up or down or watever to hear wats been going on inside another episode of "the Jacksons" a Negro Story. LOL  Im So sorry for making u read so much but its good for u. Jessica. She is my latest EX. And she played me too. She said yes to me but everytime i tried to do something with her. She turn me away. Nobody knew, because she didnt tell no one. And She made up lies like my brother was going to beat her sister up if she didnt go out with me. Which definatly wasnt true.   But I dont know How i can but 13 years of drama into one post so ill see u later.
