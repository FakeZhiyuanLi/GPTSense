      I've finally taken the plunge into the world of blogging.  I've not done anything like this in years, so if there is a reader in here.. forgive me if I've made a blogging faux pas.   My introduction:  My name is Ellen, in case you haven't picked that one up yet.  I'm 27 years old.  I live in the Dirty South.  I'm a divorced mother with two daughters.    Now for something completely different......  I'm currently in an unwanted relationship.  I don't know how many of you can relate, sympathize or understand.  Let me explain to the fortunate folks that don't know what this is.  I started dating this fellow a little over a year ago.  He was meant to be a fling, but he was such a nice guy (at that time).  He's a bit on the dumb, cornfed, good ol' boy side, but he was good company and provided whatever I wanted or needed whenever I was ready.  We ended up moving in together, and he did a complete 180.  He is, in actuality, the most stupid, barbaric Neanderthal I've ever known.  I cannot stand him at all.  I've tried dumping him on many occasions, and he just won't go away.  Grr!  I know most people would think, "Throw him out, fool!!"  Don't think I haven't tried!!  I've even had the police over to see what could be done, and they basically tell me that I don't have a leg to stand on.  So this has motivated me to get back in school so I can have a real, good paying job instead of these lousy odd job gigs that swing themselves my way.  (For those that don't know, jobs aren't exactly abundant in my area.. they're quite hard to come by.  Don't think I haven't tried.)  He's the brother-in-law of my best friend, which is making it just that much more difficult.  He is constantly bitching and whining.  I don't think he knows what being positive is like at all.  He lies an awful lot, too.  The only thing he has going for him is that he's good in the sack.  That is absolutely it.  I swear to Christ, if I knew then what I know now, I would have tucked tail and gotten the hell out of Dodge.  I've made it perfectly clear on numerous occasions that I have no feelings for him, I am using him, and I can't wait to get rid of him.  Do you know his reply???  He proposed to me!!!  Holy Hell!!!  That has been shot down more times than I care to admit.  Now I know people are thinking I'm a dirty bitch for that, but hey, I was very honest about it.  I didn't try to hide any piece of my feelings towards him.  I've encouraged him to go out and find a girl that would better suit him--someone that he could be happy with, someone he could make happy.  He refuses.  Can anyone say, "Psycho!!"?  If anyone has been-there-done-that with a fool like that, could they please let me know whether or not escape is possible?
