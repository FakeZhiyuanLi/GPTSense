       I'm currently reading The Purpose Driven Life by Rick Warren, and I'd like to share an excerpt that I thought to be quite interesting and enriching.... made me think...  ===== He (God) created the church to meet your five deepest needs: a purpose to live for, people to live with, principles to live by, a profession to live out, and power to live on....Worship helps you to focus on God; fellowship helps you face life's problems; discipleship helps fortify your faith; ministry helps find your talents; evangelism helps fulfill your mission. ===== I hope this little piece has given you something to think about, not necessarily changed your whole perspective, but if anything has made your life a little more enriched.  Take Care &amp; God Bless

       Just came back from the Madonna Re-Invention Concert at the Air Canada Centre and what can&nbsp; say, she is a PHENOMENAL performer.&nbsp; With a mix of her "old-school" and "new age" songs, she kept the audience on their feet.  I was blown away by her talent in playing the accoustic and electric guitars to her old songs, such as Material Girl, and was awestruck by her rendition of John Lennon's "Imagine."&nbsp;  I don't think you truly come to appreciate an artist till you've been to one of their live concerts.&nbsp; I saw a side of her that enabled her to connect with her audience, her fans here in Toronto.&nbsp;   It was a great concert all together, the energy, the excitement, the anticipation of what the next song was gonna be and how she'd perform it.&nbsp;

       After an exhausting weekend moving things from upstairs to downstairs, I've come to the realization that there is still soooooo much to be done before my parents leave for California.&nbsp; They only have about 9-10 days (including today)!!!&nbsp; The frustrating things are not so much what has to be done in the basement, we can get that done when they're gone, but the things that must be moved to the basement (practically all the contents of the kitchen, bathroom, etc.).&nbsp; It is tremendously exhausting. &nbsp; And even when all this is set and done, there's still a matter of sitting down with my parents to decided who'll take on what responsibilities like maintaining my parents banking accounts, my grandma's, backyard and frontyard maintainance, monthly bills, etc.&nbsp; So although freedom seems to be coming around the corner, responsibilities are looking to take over.&nbsp; It's kind of bittersweet, gaining the freedom of living in our own "place", yet taking on the responsibilities of the entire household. &nbsp; Oh well, we'll see how the transition&nbsp;goes through.&nbsp; Only time will tell.

       I would have liked to start blogging "officially" on July first, but due to circumstances that WERE in my control, I figure, oh well.....  So here it is, the first BLOGG!!! (woohoo!) Canada Day 2004 will without a doubt go down in my books as a memorable one.  Actually, the festivities started a little early this year thinking I'd take July 1st as a day off to recouperate before coming in (reluctantly) for work the next day....Uhmmmm didn't happen :P  Here's what did...  June 30: PreCanada Day BBQ Great food, Great Drinks, Great Music, Great friends!!!  And all set to a Hawaiian/Beach-type theme. Thanks to Karlo, Gerard, Laura, Don, Jen, & Rodney for coming out.  July 1st: Canada Day  Don, Jen & Rodney stayed over.  I Woke up with a mild headache (didn't drink as much as I would have liked to) but nothing that a good cup of java and a hearty filipino breakfast couldn't fix.  Jen was the first up, Don passed out (way too much to drink) and Rodney just was tired out.    Fast forwarding to some night action.... Darlene & Marcella (long time highschool gal pals) came over for some pre-drinking before we'd head down to Seven (on Adelaide and University) to meet up with Diana (another highschool bud).  On the way to, we picked up Nadine, yes another Ex-Poper like the other 3.  Needless to say, the night was truly memorable.  Pre-drinking consisted of a Sambucca shot (notice the absence of "shots", eww), Cran and Raspberry Vodka chasers, Tequila and Lemon Drop shots.  We had a nice buzz going.  Just when we thought the night couldn't get any more exciting.... my dog Tamiko managed to slip passed us through the door and bolted with the sound of the fireworks.  It took us a long and scary while for find her (shaking).  Who knew that Marcella (the sprinter), Darlene (the pick-up) and Me (the negotiator) could manage to pull this off in a semi-drunken state.  Well after this fiasco, we kinda lost our buzz (darnit all).  My sister was gracious enough to drive us downtown after what happened and we arrived at Seven just as the club was starting to get busy.  The rest of the night seems like a blur, and I'm still trying to piece most of it together....  Like I said earlier, this one is definitely "ONE FOR THE BOOKS"!!!
