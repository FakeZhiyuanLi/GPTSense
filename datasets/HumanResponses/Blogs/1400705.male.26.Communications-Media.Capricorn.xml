      Long time, no blog. So I'm sitting hear listening to the new Yeah Yeah Yeahs album, trying to recall what's gone on since my last blog. BTW, the new album is tops. I'm over my cold, although I've got a lingering cough that shows up when I don't feed it. We are in the middle of a three-day video shoot at work so it's long hours for your's truly. That's not necessarily a bad thing though. It's nice to feel like you've put in an honest day's work, come home and kick back with a medium of your choice and then eat a good dinner. Over the weekend the misses and I watched a very strange, but very good flick: " urlLink Secretary ". I thought it was funny that the misses picked out a movie about S&M at the workplace. To me, this is funny, because I'm sure if I picked it out I would have been labeled a pig for renting a movie where the plot centers around ass-spanking. Kudos to James Spader and Maggie Gyllenhaal. Okay, kids, time to hit the showers before I catch my bedtime tv show - Futurama! Yeah!

      one more thing about the YLT show / album.  Georgia sings a bulk of the new songs. And if you've ever heard a Georgia-sung YLT song you know that is very, very good thing. That is / was one of the few bright spots on the new lp / saturday night's concert. and with that i bid you goodnight

      Easter has come and gone. The sister came down for the weekend so I spent Friday night, Saturday evening, Sunday morning and Sunday evening over at the Mom's visiting. As an added bonus a good friend the college days was in town from NYC. So a bunch of us Virginia Tech Photo Staff kids got caught up over pizza in Cleveland Park, DC. Easter Sunday was nice. We did brunch with some relatives, and then that evening the family & my girlfriend did Easter dinner at my Mom's. Dinner consisted of steaks wrapped in bacon, twice-cooked potatoes, lobster tail, corn on the cob and pie. A mighty feast. Saturday night's Yo La Tengo show blew. I was so disappointed. I don't really like the new album and they played nearly every song from it unfortunately.  YLT seems to be forgoing thier earlier noise-pop and lounge sensibilities for making music that is so quiet and docile that it barley registers as sound. Plus, the lyrics for this new album are just terrible; crossing over the line of a song-as-personal-confession to sounding like it was culled from the poetry of a thousand 13-year-old pop-star crushes.  Trying to recreate the 'hushed' sounds of the album in a live setting was such a waste of the bands extraordinary talents and the very notion of a 'performance'. In one of the few critical reviews I read, it was suggested that the new album is the sound of the band decomposing. And sadly, I have to agree.  I could go on & on, but I'm testing the idea of going to bed at decent hour so I'm rested for a full day of work. heh

      woo-hoo! Friday!  Lot's of things to be excited about. First, its the Easter weekend, which means my sister is in town from NJ. Big cheer for family gathering. Second, Sat. night is the  urlLink Yo La Tengo  concert.  Third, it's the weekend, duh. In other news, I finally finished a Flash project I started back in December. Maybe this weekend I'll see about posting it over the webspace Verzion gave me for signing up for DSL. Let's see if I can figure out how to link to other blogs....

      Finally. Finally. FINALLY I got my cell phone back from Radio Shack and it works. Good god, the things that you have to do to get decent customer service. GRRRR.....This situation made me appreciate the companies that do care that I'm giving them my hard-earned (and in this case, much needed) money. Thank you Sprint PCS and DirecTV. Everytime I call with a problem they get it right on the 1st try and with a great attitude. Now, I know a lot of people got thier grips with said companies, but for me, they are golden.  Capitals urlLink   lost again tonight. BOO! Now the series is tied 2-2 with the game returning to Tampa Bay. Too tired to learn how to do things with my blog so i'm gonna hit the showers and read me some William Gibson.  Mona Lisa Overdrive , to be precise.

      Ack. What a day!  I'm having a nightmare of a time getting Radio Shack to fix my cell phone. I gave them the phone on the 15th of march to repair and I've never seen it since. Everytime I call over there or show up at the store I get a different answer from someone. Today's saga included screaming at a Customer Service Representative just to get him to pick up a phone and find out where my cell phone is.  The answer : in Texas, still being repaired. See, this is different from Friday when I was told the phone was repaired and en route to Falls Church, Va. Sigh. In better news, last night's Dirty Three show was amazing. To say the band performed 'live' is an understatement. They owned that stage. Mick Turner is one amazing drummer! Some drummers are defined as  good  because they strap themselves to their drum kit as its lifted into the air and spun around, others define themselves by playing like each of their limbs belong to a separete person. I put Mick Turner in the latter category.  Here's a list of things given to me by my girlfriend's family this weekend: A projection screen 8 mm film camera (the rest are books. I'm looking the director you, Sam) Oliver Twist  Anna Karenina The Way of Lao Tzu The Celery Stalks at Midnight Nine Stories by J.D. Salinger The Bhagavad-Gita 'Salem's Lot

      wow. my first blog.  urlLink Sam  has been pestering me for almost a month now to start one of these things. It's only fair since I've been reading Sam's since the start of the year; the least I can do is return the favor.  Instead of slugging it on the couch the whole weekend, I made a quick trip up to Philly. My girfriend's grandpa is / was in the hospital so we drove up there to wish well and etc. Let's all hope that he is healthy and at home very, very soon. So aside from driving for a total of 8 hours in I-95 there really isn't much to tell. I'm off to the Black Cat for the  urlLink Dirty Three  show tonight.  Get used to reading crap like that on this blog. I go to a lot of shows by bands that seem to be below the majority of people's radars.  One could define this as being a "hipster-dofus". Goodnight, all.

      Fucking Hell. What a terrible day. Our - Jenny (my roommate) and I - fish died tonight. Sometime during the day "Barcroft" jumped out of his tank, took a long plug off the dresser and died on the floor. When I got home from rehearsal Jenny and I ceremoniously scooped him up in a paper towel and threw him out with the kitchen trash.  In the most reverent way of course. However before I got home, some rat-bastard motherfuck broke into my car and stole: my cd player w/ cd in it, cell phone car charger, bag of lollipops, sunglasses, and various mix tapes. And my car was parked right outside of a church!!! And (I’m guessing here) it occurred only 30 minutes or so before rehearsal ended. I say this because they left my car door open, however when I started my car it turned over without hesitation, meaning that the battery was not being drained for long. Like I said, I'm just guessing. I'm still pissed, violently, seeing red mad at the punk-ass bitches that did this, however as I drove home I realized it could have been worse. A lot worse. I lost little things. The big, important things were left alone, or most likely just not noticed. My mom's watch and bracelet that I had repaired for her but not given back to her, my checkbook which was in my work briefcase, and my car.   Stupid Sad Sack Day.  It's time for a sympathy beer.

      I hope everyone had a nice Memorial Day weekend.  Friday and Saturday were used to relax. The girlfriend and I camped out in front of the tv and watched AMC's Memorial weekend movie marathon.  We watched a bunch of WWII movies - The Glory Brigade, Force 10 from Navarone, To Hell & Back, Deer Hunter, Casualties of War and Platoon all courtesy of the magic of American Movie Classics.  I also finally watched the new re-release of "Straw Dogs" on DVD that was loaned to me. Disturbing movie, slow and violent, but then that's Sam Peckinpah for you.  Sunday I had kickball practice. However since the weekend was a wash-out weather-wise only 6 people from our team showed up. So everyone took turns kicking and fielding in the rain and mud before we moved the whole event over to a friend' house for BBQ in a garage.  Oh, and I got my muffler problem fixed to the tune of $200 dollars. Stupid car...  My day off from work was spent seeing "Matrix Reloaded". Good, not great, in my opinion. I found it clunky in the beginning and slow to start, however once the gang got around to 'doing something' about their problem the film didn't let go. I'd recommend it, however I already know that the people that read this blog have already seen it. Hi Sam, Hi Adam, Hi Kim.  So far X-men 2 is the best bet for this summer. Okay, time for bed. I've got run rehearsal tomorrow night so I don't know if I'll be around to update this. Peace, y'all

      Early morning blog! I woke up early this morning for some strange reason so now I'm all ready to leave for work the missus is still asleep in bed. Oh, wait. she's unearthed herself and is now in the shower.   X-Men 2 was van-tastic. I would say it is even better than the first film.  Matrix Reloaded got moved to sometime this weekend since we've got a three-day weekend. The weekend will also include shopping for new shoes (both casual and running) and getting my muffler fixed. The silver lining about having your muffler broken is that in today's world (and especially this area of fairfax county) your car just sounds 'tricked out' rather than old&busted.  Thank you, society.  Well, sounds like the missus is done with her shower. I best go get breakfeast ready. Will that be corn flakes or Cheerios, my love....  peace.

      Tuesday turned out to be a good day. Lots of reasons why. First off, girlfriend didn't have to be cut open again at the doctors. She was quite elated, as I'm sure you can guess. So she's on the road to being fully recovered from her sugical procedure last week. Second, my request to join a kickball team was confirmed by the  urlLink World Adult Kickball Association (WAKA). A friend from work formed a team and asked me to join. Third (and lastly, to keep this tidy), tonight's episode of Buffy: The Vampire Slayer, was the series ender. While, it's a shame that a smart show like that went off the air, it was a very good send-off for a show the hit way more than it missed.  In theatre related news, the girlfriend's summer project of directing "Godspell" for the Springfield Community Theatre is under way. Last night was the 1st read through and it went well. She's excited, and as the stage manager, I'm happy to be there.  However I get all this week and some of next week off since all they are doing is rehersing the musical numbers. Which leaves me plenty of time for GTAIII and finally seeing "X-Men 2" (tomorrow night) and "The Matrix(Reloaded)" Thursday night.  Tonight's task was to update my resume so maybe I'll give that a try before the evening is done.  I got  urlLink "Quiet Nights"  by Miles Davis on the stereo...

      So we had a yard sale today. "We" meaning my mom, the missus, and I.  The community that my mom lives in held their annual yard sale so the missus hauled a bunch of her junk over. We sold about half the stuff, which is good for two reasons. One, it will only take half the work to return the junk to her apartment, and Two, it is less junk that she will be bringing to the house / apartment that we will eventually be living in. Also, she made $70.  After the yard sale, the missus and I drove all over creation looking at houses for rent. We found a crap shack that is close to work and a nice townhome that is too far away from her work. So maybe next week we will look in Mclean since that is also a good middle point for our commutes. Like the cleaning of the house....it never ends  peace out.

      Boy, is  urlLink Sam  going to feel bad for yelling at me for not updating my blog like I promised. Here I am, being a perfect saint, taking care of my sick and injured girlfriend and all he can do is talk smack. Tsk Tsk.  Even so, I hope he has a good time on the mini-vacation with his law school chums. See what a saint I'm being?

      yo. for some stu-pid reason it is taking way too long for me to download something from C-net. I'm try to download a 'zip/unzip' program so I can watch the 1st four of the "Animatrix" videos posted at  urlLink Matrix.com . Grrr...it's a grr kinda week.  My poor girlfriend. She's been sick since Friday and on Tuesday she was in such bad shape that I had to take her to the doctor's so they could do a surgial procedure on her. She was in that much pain, poor lass. The crisis has been averted, but she's confined to her house. Now most of us working stiffs would think that a note from our doctor telling our boss that we can't come into work this week + painkillers is a vacation. However, it's kinda boring at her house. She ain't got cable, internet access or a computer. It's a good thing she's hot, otherwise..... ;-) Even she is admitting bordem. I dug up my old Gameboy (B&W 80's represent!) and grabbed some DVD's for her to watch. So, yes, she's at least got a DVD player.   I'm not going to spell check this cuz I'm beat and I still can't watch the animie videos so y'all can bite me. I'm going to watch Futurama. But first, something to  urlLink entertain  you. Check out the mp3 section.  Fuck the Creationists!

      So I cut out of work early today to get a haircut. They'd finished up the hair cutting part and were edging around my ear with a straigh razor when the lady nicked my ear. At first I freaked out cuz I couldn't see how bad it was due to excessive amounts of shaving cream (and maybe she couldn't either). Once she cleared away the foam and staunched the bleeding we could see it was that bad.  Phew. for a mintue there I though I was going to be the next Vincent Van Ghog. So I still have 99.9% of my ear and a new haircut for my weekend in city of brotherly love - Philly!  check you on sunday, maybe. definately, monday. peace

      A while back, when  urlLink Adam  urlLink   and I visited Sam for his spring break Adam gave me three cds of complete albums in mp3 format. Until recently I hadn't spent much time with it. Currently I'm having trouble listening to anything but that first disc, having become quite enraptured with the DoseOne / Boom Bip / Clouddead albums.  Taking a 'quick break' from work I called up the All Music Guide urlLink   and looked up each artist, then added the albums to the ever-growing (never-ending?) list of cds I wish to buy. Let's put aside the fact that such a list makes me a music geek and continue to the next paragraph.  I've been thinking of late if I'm ever going to become disinterested in music and stop buying cds. Freshman year of high school I made the transition from 'buying' cds to 'collecting' them (yes, there is a difference). Student-run radio at college gave me access the vast tributaries of musical styles, increasing my music intake. Acquiring a full-time job gave the much-convented cash-flow to buy cds at a rate of 5 or 6 a month.  Not immune to the current state of the economy, my cash-flow as been...'reduced' so that I can not collect cds at the rate I once did. This means going many weeks, sometimes months without purchasing any type of music.  File sharing has been a godsend; however I do plan on purchasing 95% of the music I download. Honestly. I believe in supporting the artist (or rather, thier music label in some cases). In fact of the last 10 cds I've purchased 6 of them were albums that I'd already downloaded. Arg, getting off-track. Where I'm trying to go is: I wonder what will be the 'why' that my collecting music will end?  Will I simply lose interest in listening to music. I would think that would be a personal change, rather then there being no more interesting music to hear. There is always someone, somewhere, with something interesting to say be it in the past or present.  So I doubt that will be the reason. I've always seen the cause being budgetary / family reasons, I.E. saving for a wedding, purchasing a house, newborn child. All of which I see occurring in the next 5 years. Just something that I wonder about from time to time since music is a very important part of my life. How could I not? It sounds corny, yes, but it is. Listening to music is an experience for me; going to shows are like Christmas day (although sometimes the wrong presents get laid out under the tree).  So, Adam, thanks for the great cds. Maybe I have some stuff that I can burn for you as a thank you - jazz, psych or folk albums

      Second Day of Continous Blog....Hurrah! My roommate - Jenny - just walked in, wanting to show me the mother's day card she got [for her mom]. Jenny: "Want to see the card I got for my mom?" Me: "Okay. I'll show you the one I got for my mom" Jenny: "Okay. But mine is better" Me [after seeing Jenny's card]: "Actually, mine's just as good" We got the same cards. Good times.

      Back to blog. Part of the reason I've not updated this is because I was sick. Actually I am still sick. I can't seem to get rid of this cough. Of course, maybe if I didn't drink while taking antibiotics then maybe I'd be better by now. The other 1/2 of 'why' I've not been updating is because there's been a lot going on of late. Hurray things to do.  Had the three-day video shoot for a National Guard training video.  Got to hang out with some very cool soldiers from Philly, PA.  The misses scored a job moonlighting as a Lighting Designer for a local high school. So I accompained her to opening night of "Titanic" by West Potomac High School.  Over the weekend, the misses and I got a last-minute invite to see the Baltimore Orioles play the Kansas City Royals. Said friend chartered a bus for us and 48 other people. They've dubbed it the "Baseball, Beer & Bus Bonanza".  Good People + Good Weather x Home Team Winning = Excellent to the Max! I picked up the somewhat old lp by the Hot Hot Heat. It's quite good, if you're in the mood for a more pop-version of Clinic. They've got an organ too. Maybe if everyone hopes at once I'll get rid of my cough....on the count of three, people...

      Since I changed my template last night I have font issues once again. Fixed the most offensive ones this morning, will tweak the rest later. Before I get my work groove on, I forgot to mention last night that my kickball team actually won a game. However it was from a forfeit (the other team didn't have the minimum number of girls to play). We scrimmaged them anyhow and would have lost horribly had it been a real game. But it wasn't! It was our first win!  okay. time for work.

      Hmm....nice new interface, blogger. Blogging was suspended for a day so they could improve the site, which was one of the reasons why this blog wasn't updated since Tuesday. Let's get caught up, shall we? After many happy apartment dances - and with a copy of the lease in hand - I am settling down to the idea of the missus & I's new place.  Friday night and Saturday afternoon there was rehearsal for Godspell instead of rehearsing lines and songs and such we worked on props and scenery. We set up a huge canvas backdrop and painted it.  I was amazed at how fast everyone worked. In three hours 10 people threw down a primer base then began painting out the blacktop portion of the backdrop.  The next morning they tackled the brick part and then threw down more lines on the blacktop area - and still finished early. Tre impressive, esp. since the backdrop was approx. 40 feet x 30 feet.  Sunday was a bit slower. Slept in, finished the 1st book of the Dark Tower series - The Gunslinger - by Stephen King.  I've gotten in this trend of re-reading books, which is unusual for me. In some cases I'm re-reading books I read only a few years ago. However in this case I read the Dark Tower series in high school (1994-ish). Since then King published the fourth book - the Wizard and the Glass - which I've never read so when I get around to that it will be a treat. Still, I feel bad sometimes that I'm re-reading books since there is so much great literature, both past and present, that I've never read. Maybe after this series I'll return to reading books I've never read. Of course, by then the third installment of the Lord of the Rings trilogy will be upon us and I'll want to re-read that book as well.    Short work week, which is always welcome. However, I almost rue it since I'm racing to meet a project deadline at work. Notice I said 'almost'.   Norah Jones' "Come Away With Me" is on the stereo...

      What a difference a day makes! The missus and I have a place to live! And not just anyplace, the exact place we wanted.  It's a two-level condo, 2BR, 2BA, den, fenced in patio. It's wild, I'm so excited. We are so please. And I am so relived to have this over and done with. And, too boot, I didn't have to go to rehearsal tonight. It's a banner freaking day.

      It took me over 5 hours from getting up at 7:30 am to actually waking up, which occurred at 2pm this afternoon. Needless to say, it's was a difficult day. Prolly much more difficult for the missus (we work for the same company) who had to hear me whine and bitch about going to her rehearsal for most of the day...  Repeat three times to myself: imitation is the highest form of flattery. Or just learn to not care what others think. There is that fine line between acting like you don't care and simply not caring. I can give off the impression that I don't care what you think of me, however when I leave your presence, what do I do about the sting that remains. Sure, you don't know that I care, however I'm still affected by it. Does that mean I won the sociological battle since I never let on that your lil joke left a sting? Or did I lose the game the moment I let you, a perfect stranger, affect me, regardless of whether or not you know - or even care.

      So its was a half and half week. Good things equal Dawn's friend, Becca, was in town and we had brunch with her Sunday morning.  Sat. night was a party hosted by former friends I meet during my 1 year of aborted graduate studies. It was nice to get caught up with them.  Friday night the missus and I saw "The Whale Rider" (I loved it; the missus, not so much). Afterwards we stopped by a Books-A-Million and I bought her the new Harry Potter book (Harry Potter & the Gobbling of the Phoenix???) and got hit on by the cashier. Sunday was the double-headed for the kickball team, which was nice because those five innings go by way too fast.  Bad things: Still haven't found housing yet. Which really isn't so bad since it's a 'process' anyhow. However, I did have to listen to a lecture by a real estate agent about how I was calling to early and I really am expect to much. You can bet that I not giving them my business next month, or any month! And our kickball team lost both of our games too night. While I am used to losing with this team it was especially heartbreaking tonight because we were so close. Argggg.   So not really a half and half week; more a 75/25 ratio.  I've got the self-titled Fleetwood Mac lp on the stereo.

      What a crap-tastic week.  I'm glad it's over.  One of our cast members quit the day after we gave her two days off to celebrate your engagement.  We are losing a fight with a church to use their space to build sets & props on the weekend. The missus and I have had many a lively 'discussion' over money and living arrangements. Which ended in me discovering I can only afford a $0 increase in rent. It's a great week! And it's apparently going poor for other people as well. Poor  urlLink Adam .  Despite the crap-tastic week and wet weather, the weekend looks promising. We've got company in town from NYC. A party with former grad. students to attend. Free concerts and lots of good movies to chose from.  Also on Sunday is Waiting For Guffman's (our kickball team) double-header. Now that we know what it feels like to tie a game, maybe we can cross over that line marked 'winners' this week. Possibilities Abound!

      The saga of house-hunting continues. The missus and I were scheduled to meet with a realtor during our lunch break. However the realtor didn't show up as we waited and waited in front of the house. Then, almost 45 minutes later calls me and says, " I waited around for you guys but left. Where are you? Did you want to see it tomorrow? Or I can come back later today". I called her a liar and hung up on her. But it was not all a bust, we drove around the neighborhood and took down addresses and numbers of the places with 'For Rent' signs. We are seeing two more places tomorrow- score!  So that's about it. I’m on the verge of finishing half-life, but that will have to wait for another night.  Great game - can't wait for the sequel due out this fall.  "he will deceive you" - creeee-py. g'night all

      I hope everyone had a good father's day weekend, and that you called your dads.  The weekend was crazy-mad busy. Some people from work - including I - got together and 'bought' a small section of farm in Bull Run, Va. What this gets you is crops! Lot's of green leafy veggies, eggs and sometimes cheese and/or fruit.  We got our 1st shipment of the season this week. I enjoy participating in this 'crop share association' for two reasons 1) it's much cheaper than buying it from the store and 2) it forces you to learn how to cook things. Now, normally I wouldn't know what to do with 2 pounds of chard but thanks for the farm's website I discovered that you can sauté it stuff and make it rather tasty.  Sat. morning saw the continuation of the musses and I hunting for a place to live. We found two-level town home in Arlington that was not managed by a freak so we filled out an application. We find out this week and the an ti ci pa tion is killing us.  We find out on Thursday if we beat out the other applicants for a the place. Sat. evening was spent celebrating mother's birthday. The musses and I, along with my sister and her boyfriend (in town from NJ) went with the mom to Wolf Trap for an evening with the NSO.  Sunday - more house hunting, then over to mother's for nice lunch.  Mom made a toast to our dad's in honor of father day. I was stuck by this because everyone at the table no longer has their father in their life. My dad died in 1997, the musses father died in 2001 and the sister's bf’s father was absentee since the bf's birth.  I had anther kickball game this evening and for the first time we didn't lose. We tied the other team. The important thing is that we didn't lose.  Time to wrap this up. cheers.

      Hiyo! Stealth blog. I prolly should not be post a blog entry at this very moment at work. We have some clients taking a tour of the facility this morning.  However, if I wait too long most of the managers will be here, making it ever harder to post this.  Despite Monday night rehearsal, the missus and I were able to catch the final quarter of Stanley Cup Game 7.  By then the score was already 2-0 in the Devils favor. We saw the 3rd and final goal by the Devils as well as some amazing saves by both goalies.  Since this was my first year paying any attention to hockey, I was surprised to learn that, aside from the Stanley Cup being award, the NHL gives out another prize - the Conn Smyth trophy. It is awarded to the MVP of the entire playoffs - not necessarily to a player on the winning team. I can't think of another sport that does that. It's a very classy touch by those at the NHL.  Still looking for a play to live.  We saw a two-level town home over in Arlington during the lunch hour yesterday. Huge, HUGE place with tons of space for very cheap.  The upstairs was great! The downstairs...not so great: grasshoppers, water damage, mildew, and circa 1970's faux wood paneling everywhere.  Then we started talking to our landlord -- F R E A K!  He gave us this three-page front and back handout about things he wants up to do while living in his place.  Some things were no-brainers, like take out trash and area rugs for the hardwood floors. Others points were a bit demanding: professional cleaners once a month, restrictions on taping or nailing things to the walls.  After we finished reading this he says to us, "This place has been on the market for a month and half now. I show it to a lot of people but I never hear from them." Well, yeah, when you hand someone a list like this. We might have been willing to live with the list and the faux wood if Mr. landlord had not changed the move-in date. I was told 7/15 over the phone on Sunday. On Monday, the move-in date became 6/15.  So screw you.  It’s a shame since there was soooo much freaking room.

      Yo. Super quick blog cuz I'm beat after a rousing game of kickball this evening.  We lost - again, but I'm sure we will win next game. We just had a bad ining where we had 5 run scored against us.  Umm.....let's see.  Did a lil' drinks with some friends friday night. Then we all went and saw "Finding Nemo" and capped the night off with some smores at Cosi (a sandwich and coffee chain). "Finding Nemo", the latest Pixar stunt, was great! great! great! And I was skeptical about its quality. Hang around for the credits for some good laughs.  On Sat. we watched the NJ Devils choke once again in Florida. They had the chance to win the cup but failed. So now it's onto the final game in NJ. They who win, get the Cup.  Um...so yeah. It may be one fractured and poorly puncuated blog with lots of crummy spelling but its done. I'll try to write better ones for the rest of the week. later

      Another night, another rehearsal. The missus felt much better about rehearsal tonight than last night. I would say tonight was the best rehearsal so far. I hope every night would be this smooth from here on out. It makes things much easier.  There are slim pickings concerning topics.....NJ Nets and San Antonio Spurs are battling in out in game 1 of the NBA finals. Actually, it's prolly over by now but I'm too lazy to check the score.   "Dead Cities, Red Seas & Lost Ghosts" by M83 is my latest acquisition on cd.  And holy flying cow! What a great cd! I haven't been this excited about electronica since last year's "Neon Golden" by the notwist. Recommended!  Like I said, slim pickings for topics tonight. Maybe tomorrow a mackerel will fall from the sky and land on the hood of my car as I'm driving home.  Now that would be magical!

      what a difference a day makes in Godspell rehearsals.  The missus was not as pleased with rehearsal tonight as she was last night. However in the lowly opinion of this stage manager I thought the kids did all right. She blocked out this whole freaking song for about 13 kids. I'd say it was a success. In other news today seemed like the longest day ever. It took forever for 6pm (quitting time) to roll out. Good lord, let's not have a repeat of that tomorrow, please.  Speaking of things that take forever...currently downloading the current (sorry, not intentional) patch for half-life. Since Sierra games seems to have deleted the file from their site (thanks guys) so I'm stuck getting it from some website with a horribly slow server. Sam will propably read this and point out, in his next blog, how I'm a dolt for doing it this way and not some other way. But whatever. Currently at 47%. Almost halfway there!

      Tuesday morning blog! And at work, so this will have to be short. Which works out well since I don't have much to report.  Rehearsal went well last night. I am slowly learning the names of the cast and the characters, which makes my job easier.  Moving on to the  urlLink Stanley Cup … I would certainly like the NJ Devils to win the cup this year, however the Mighty Ducks have just been on fire. Now they've tied the series 2-2 after being down 0-2.  Still I don't think a hockey team that was fashioned after a Walt Disney movie should win the Stanley Cup so I'm rooting for the NJ Devils. Plus the Devil's goalie is a beast in the form of a brick wall. If only NJ had an offense, they might have put this series away by now.    When I'm at work I listen to  urlLink KEXP 90.3  in Seattle....

      Slow fried blast pit monster, oh yeah.  Weekend has come and gone.  I just got back from my 1st kickball game (2nd for my team) and while we didn't win, "Waiting for Guffman" certainly represented.  We lost 4-3, however there was a lot of contention about the score. We think our team cheated on a number of occasions.  Our captain made an attempt to argue the score however we were hampered by certain conditions. We didn't have every rule memorized like our opponents did, so we voiced our arguments to the wrong people at the wrong time (much like the supreme courts. it's not what you ask but how you ask it). Our opponents took this game way to seriously (and we're rude and unsportsmanlike from the start). It's kickball for Christ’s sake, not a funeral. Our 'suspicion' that our opponents were class-A jerks was proven true when they started a fight with their next opponent before they could even begin their double-header. Like I said, it's just kickball.   Friday night was a treat. We saw a very cool production of "Hamlet", which was part of DC's Free-For-All outdoor theatre. And the price was right - free! The costumes and the set were great. Everyone was dressed in black leather (oh yea!) and the set was a series of stone slabs.  Great Looking + Good Acting = Great Night Out.  power-up.

      Sigh. I laughed so hard at today's blog postings. Good times. Sadly, I had to go look up who  urlLink Kevin Nealon  is since I had him confused with  urlLink Kevin Nolan . Therefore one can understand why I thought Adam was spouting gibberish.  But, damn. we should start some more wars via the blogs, that shit was funn-nny. Kim- for some reason I don't have your phone number(s) so if you (or anyone else) wants to post 'em on their blog please do that. Or maybe IM me. You'll prolly want to do that instead. Regardless we could certainly use your help this weekend.    Time for rehearsal - just three more days and my responsibilities to this production are over.  Don't hate the player, hate the game

      Rock! Everyone is moving. Sam has moved. I am starting the moving process tomorrow.  Of course, it might not take 4 days to move, but you never know. We only have about 2/3s of the day to move since we have to stop at 4pm or so to get ready for the play.  We've got crazy company coming in the for weekend. Dawn's mom is coming down from Philly to help w/ the move, as well as two of Dawn's friends from NYC. So what does that say about you, Sam? Adam? Nah. I'm just play'n. Mad props to y'all.  Speaking of mad props, Adam has resurfaced on his blog only to write incomprehensible gibberish about me.  But at least we know he is alive.    I got Gillian Welch's 'soul journey' on the stereo......YO.

      Ahhhhh...sweet relief. Friday the play (Godspell) opened and I felt the cast had an excellent opening night. Which they then bested on Saturday, even if there were a few gaffs here and there.  Friday night after the show everyone went across the street to Generous Georges for celebratory pizza. Even though that ended around midnight I still wasn't allowed to go to bed. I packed a quick over-night bag for the missus then threw all the old-n-busted junk in my car for the next morning's YARD SALE.  At 6 am the alarm went off and the missus and I loaded up her car, then drove over to my Mum's to retrieve more stuff as well as the missus's dryer (all this was over there because mom had a yard sale a few months back and we just left the stuff).  From mom's we drove to the parking lot at work we the company yard sale was. We set up and prepared for the rush.  And what a rush it was!!! We moved a ton of stuff - clothes, books, movies, tv stands, bookcases. The one thing we didn't move was the missus' dryer. So it was left at the Salvation Army where it will find a good home (prolly in a river).  So after the yard sale we spent the afternoon trying to locate some more props for the play; specifically - glow sticks.  After scouring Northern Virginia we had 67 glow sticks - enough glow sticks for each actor, for every night of performance.  Then there was performance no. 2, where the audience reacted better to the cast and the jokes. Then to cast party, of which we stayed until 2 am chatting with the cast and the most excellent music director. Then home. Then sleeping until noon – a luxury I have not be able to afford for some time.   Switching gears to COUNTDOWN TO NEW HOUSE: T minus 5.41 days until we move into new apartment!

      Oh, lordy. What a crazy crazy week. Rehearsals are lasting longer and longer as we try to put the finishing touches on things.  The end is so close I can almost taste it. It must be the only thing keeping me going cuz after this week you'd think i'd be zombie-fied.  One more rehearsal and then opening night. Huzzah. Cheers around.  One year anniversary evening was very nice. Sunday's concert was good as well.  Tuesday was a crap day. Today was much better. I will make sense again on Monday. right now just isnt' the time. It's time for bed.  This website was forwarded to me by the missus:  urlLink FOUND Magazine

      Yowzer, what a storm last night. I had to give up on watching Adult Swim because the storm started interfering with the DirecTV signal so I came upstairs to chat over IM. I typed one line to someone and bam! the power went out. So I watched the storm from my bedroom window while the power flicked on and off, but eventually the storm won that battle. So I had nothing to do but go to sleep.  I've been fortunate enough to have some interesting websites/articles forwarded to me. Here be the 1st, courtesy of the  urlLink Billions Corporation .   urlLink The Hijacked US Goverment   Time for an eggs & bacon breakfest

      Wow, it's been a while since the last update. And still I don't have much to say. I've been at rehearsal every night this evening and have been crashing to meet a deadline at work so that is what has kept me away. Wed night was a treat however - we got to rehearse in the space where the performance will be. Until then we've been rehearsing at this church. While the church was generous enough to let us rehearse there, it is by no means a worthy substitute. It's either damp and humid or hot and humid (no happy medium), it's too small, swallows sound, lacks parking and has very uncomfortable seats. The seats at our performance space are much comfortable. A good, comfortable seat is very important since, as a stage manager, I do a lot of sitting.    In other news,  urlLink Adam  has finally paid down his credit card balence. Congrats!  I got my new sneakers (or kicks, as today's youth like to call 'em) in the mail on Monday. They are suede, which I'm told you are not to get wet. Well, that lastedd all of three days. Tonight it was raining to beat the band and I walked the missus to her car w/ the umbrella so she not get wet, then walked back to my car. By then, shoes = soaked. Whatever.  Listening to a lot of Mogwai lately. Currently playing "Happy Songs for Happy People"...

      ah, Sunday evening.  today was certainly the most low-key of all days.  woke up early to discover that I've spent all the money my budget will allow, which translates into no cd player for jason's car. Which is a shame because I really wanted to help restart America's economy (and have a cd player in my car).  So after that sad realization, I went over to the missus to help her clean her apartment. Once I got home I piddled around for a bit - some IM, some email, some gaming, finished watching the Outlaw Star DVD that was loaned to me.    I developed a wicked headache at some point in the afternoon. Watching Outlaw Star didn't get rid of it, neither did coffee. So I went to Wendy's and got me some dinner. That seemed to help it.   I watched Independence Day on the tele tonight. For certain reasons (lack of acting, direction, rational plot development) I don't like the movie. However I do like watching  urlLink Jeff Goldblum  interact w/ his fellow actors. If they made a buddy movie with him and a paper bag I bet I would still like it. Good man.  I've got Prefuse 73's "one word extinguisher" on the cd player...

      A very fine Fourth of July was had by the missus and me. We hit the party at Raf's, where we ate hot dogs and drank beer and chatted it up with both strangers and friends for about 5 hours. Then we all headed down to the Iwa Jima memorial to watch the fireworks. Afterwards we returned to Raf's for more celebrating.  Hightlights of the evening included Raf inviting his old man neighbor/landlord and his even older wife over to party with us. The landlord did come over for a beer and exclaimed, "Raf, how did you get so may hot girls to show up at your party?" Classic! Another highlight was my current roommate, Jenny, and I calling Sam (former roommate of Raf) over in San Diego to tell him that we were in his old house. Yes, we were a bit drunk. The phone got passed around so a few people could say hello.  After much sleeping in, I finally got up around noon. I helped the missus move a bookshelf to her studio then we went cardboard dumpster diving for boxes to move with. Good times!

      Huzzah for the long weekend. 4th of July weekend has officially started - and I couldn't be more pleased. Even though it was a short work week I'm spent. A combination of rehearsal (no surprise there) and a towering deadline at work. Also I ended having many a late night.  There was a fight with the missus about wedding ideas as well as watching one too many  urlLink Outlaw Star  episodes on the DVDs that Bryce lent me.  But enough about concerns and worries.   Very excited about Raf's 4th of July party tomorrow. He promised that I could eat my weight in hotdogs, which I may just try.  The missus and I were originally scheduled to leave town for the weekend. She'd made arrangements for us to house-sit in Allentown PA. One of her relatives - who has a pool and a grill - said we could come up and swim while they are away. However, what was not said was that we could start inviting people down from NYC which the missus was doing. So we 86'ed the idea. Mostly because of the no-permission issue but also because we could really use a weekend of r-n-r.    My package from Amazon  finally  arrived.  So I finally have a legitimate copy of the Broken Social Scene's "you forgot it in people", as well as the recent Four Tet and Prefuse 73 cds.  Gibberish, I know. But, hey, who says that downloading music from the internet doesn't spur records sale.  I'm having trouble remembering what I did for the 4th of July last year.  I wasn't dating the missus just yet; I think I attended a house party in Del Ray, Alexandria, ate a lot of watermelon and drank even more beer (11 to be exact) then went home and threw it all up.  Sam, maybe you can help me out - did I do the 4th of July with you last year? Or were you scouting places to live in SD? Everyone have a safe and pleasant 4th of July. And if you see any terrorist kick 'em square in the balls! Do it for Uncle Sam...

       Direct Effect  Part two of an infrequent, rambling tirade about how the man is trying to keep me down  So Wed. was the day when the DirecTV installers were to come out and re-locate our satellite dish. Because of the drama involved in last month's installation I took the whole day off. Around 9am I get a phone call: Install Dude: "Yeah, I am not going to be about to make it today." Me: "Okay. I'd like to know why?" Install Dude: "It's just one of those things. I'm really sorry." Me: "That still doesn't explain why you're not coming out. I'd like to know why" Install Dude: "It's just one of those things. If you would call DirecTV and reschedule."  *Sigh* so I dial up DirecTV and spin them a yarn, they become incensed (possibly feigned) and end up getting someone to come out that day. Around 5 pm I get a call telling me that the new install dude is running late. Around 6pm it starts to lightning and raining like the world is going to end. I get another phone call from the install people telling me that the install dude will be by within the hour. I check to make sure that they understand its dark, raining, and the sky is filled with lightning.  Install people: Oh, that's not a problem. They can still work in that.  When I ask them if that is, perhaps, a bit dangerous, she informs me that it’s not  that  dangerous. *SIGH* Of course, the guy doesn't show and at 10pm I get a call informing me of just that. Thanks, so considerate.  So I dial up DirecTV, and a guilt trip, to rat out the install people.  13 hours!!! Time off from work!!! I moan and howl. And it works. DirecTV is crediting most of my account for this month, as well as giving me a discount for the next six months. Bonus!  And this (long) story has a happy (overdue) ending.  Another install dude came out this morning and re-located the dish, below the fence line with signal strength of 90% across the board. Which is a most excellent signal strength.  Croc Hunter for all!!! CSPAN for everyone!!! Telemundo for the whole bar!!!

       "Direct to your frontal lobe"   So.... a while back we had our DirecTV installed at the new house.  However, if it was up to the two goons that were responsible for installing it they would have rather just gotten lost (twice), been three hours late, and  then  gone home. Instead they were three hours late, got lost twice, and I had to listen to their supervisor lie to me (twice). Finally they arrive and commence to tell me they are going to install the satellite dish here, below the fence line and in the corner. Well, I come home two hours later to find the dish has, in fact, been installed over there, above the fence line and five feet from the corner. It's not enough to take your lunch hour waiting for them, and then come back three hours later; you also have to baby-sit them. So what happens? Well the missus & I get served a "warning" from the Home Owners Association that our dish is in violation of their laws. In a helpful twist of fate, DirecTV gives you a thirty-day grace period to change where you dish is installed - free of charge.  So this Wed. I am taking the entire day off to wait for the DirecTV sub-contractors to come out and re-set the placement of the satellite dish. Or at least try to. As a side note: the missus and I (well, just me. she kept saying this wasn't a good idea) tried to lower the dish ourselves. It took most of the afternoon and two drills to get it off. Then took the rest of the day to get it screwed back onto the fence. With a signal of 45%. For those without the DirecTV experience, anything under 65% is very,very,very poor. You may as well start saving for cable. So I went out to 'adjust' the dish in hopes of increasing the signal. However after the slightest touch I reduced our signal to a whopping 0%. That's right "0%".  So now the missus and I just read things: Newspapers, TV Guide, the backs of cereal boxes, our neighbor's mail. HA! Good luck to Sam, Lauren Scattolini and Brian White on the beginning of their new school years. Pound those books!

      "Meddddic!"  So last week the company I work for send me - along with 3 other employees - to Harrisburg, PA for a video shoot. Now some might cheer or jeer if their company asked them to travel for work. I cheered; not only because I enjoy video shoots (that was part of the reason) but because were filming a triage video. Specifically, we filmed a triage video about how to treat a gunshot wound to the chest. Even though we were in a hanger with no A/C during 100 degree days and all the other companies we worked with where less than prep-pared (when compared to us) I had a great time. What's not to like? Company-purchased food, digs, fake gunshot wound. Well worth the four 12-hour days it took to shoot the whole script. Although if I had my choice I would have joined this week's triage shoot in PA - it's a "How to perform an amputation in the field".  Mmm...tasty!

       Entertaining Days   Refreshed & recharged from sunny California, the missus and I were an unstoppable unpacking machine.  Every night we threw an average of 7 boxes that once held stuff. The missus stood tall in the pocket and continued unpacking while I was at work.  Then I would come home and the unpacking continued with full-force until the arrival of the missus' aunt & uncle from Allentown PA.  While we did show them around DC in the evening it was they that paid for everything - dinners, drinks, movie tickets, and even house-warming gifts. Good times!

       California Demise   Wedding in California! Not my wedding, but my cousin's.  The first day in sunny Long Beach was spent at the outdoor rehearsal dinner, getting caught up with family and introducing the missus to everyone.  I also met my cousin's son, Will Jr., for about the 4th time in his seven-year life, however this was the 1st time he actually behaved like he knew who I was.  The after-dinner party was moved to some bar on the beach were I drank so much gin that I actually became sober. Second day in Long Beach began with a pre-wedding gathering on the beach where a game of football was started up by Will Jr. The missus participated in this game and took a wicked hit from the Will Jr, the pit-sized wonder. As GREAT as a game of beach football is we did have to stop for the actual wedding. I believe the missus has covering the actual wedding in her blog so I'm just going to say it was a perfectly gorgeous wedding, the kind of wedding that only two truly great people can create.

      Holy Hell! I'm way behind on blogging. Prepare ye for an onslaught of blogs!    Moving Up  The missus and I conquered the big move. We managed to fit everything into the apartment, which you wouldn't think is a problem with the amount of space we have, however there were some last minute verdicts rendered on the larger furniture items.  Big props to Kim who pitched in for a second day of moving help. With her assistance I was able to return a couch and an armoire back to mother's.  With all boxes and furniture moved in, this began the massive hemorrhaging of unwanted stuff and cardboard boxes. Then the re-arranging of bedroom furniture -twice.  For the next three days that is all we would know until...

      No new posts until Verizion gets off thier asses and fixes the problem with DSL in our part - if not all - of Arlington. After mid-night tonight it will have been a full week that service has been out.  Which is a shame since I've looks to blog about - moving, trip to Long Beach California, end of Godspell. it's just too much to blog about at work.

      Bam! Back from sunny/sandy South Carolina.  Because I like lists let's breakdown the work week in percentages. It goes like this: Running around military base documenting recruits experiences at basic training: 75% Eating/Drinking: 7.5% Sleeping: 7.5%  All in all it was a great time. We had an excellent public affairs officer escorting us around the base. And thank goodness, because Fort Jackson is one gigantic military base.  Since we had a great escort we got to do mostly anything.  Shadow a squad of soldiers on a simulated ambush? CHECK.  Film from the top of Victory Tower? CHECK. Want to be in the soldiers bunk when the Drill Sergeants wake them up? CHECK. We got it all, baby. And it was cool as shit.   Essentially, I got to experience what it would life would be like as a recruit in the Army, but without the yelling and the running. And I got paided. Good times!  Tonight the missus and I rented "Bulletproof Monk". However it scored low in the plausibility and acting areas so we turned it off. Which is about the worst thing I can say about a movie; this is the second movie I have ever seen that I felt was so bad I couldn't watch it.  Still, seeing the fight choreography, all be it poor, put me in the mood for some martial arts. So we watched "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon". Now, that is a movie. Top Notch!  Regardless, tis good to be home.

      First Hurricane Isabel, now this. I'm off to the recently wrecked South Carolina for a week to film a reality-tv style documentary on new recruits in the National Guard. So this blog may seem a bit inactive after all my previous posts. Oh, wait....  The hurricane rolled into our part of town around 2pm. At 3pm the company I work for lost power, around 6pm our house lost power.  Somewhere between 9pm and 6am our upstairs neighbor lost a shutter to her window that landed in our backyard. And our power was turned back on. Then, power was cut off around 9am Friday morning. It was restored at 2am Sunday morning. Long enough for everything in our fridge (including 30 frozen chickens and an ice cream cake) to rot, and long enough to force us to cancel our housewarming party.   So party will be rescheduled, shutter will be nailed back in place by maintenance guy and more frozen chicken pieces will be purchased.  All in all, we turned out all right.

      I figured I should stop posting stuff in other people's comments section and just write a blog of my own.    To tone things down a bit from my acidic posting in Sam's blog, 9-11 is a sad, sad day.  As it was describe before two years ago in the press, this day will forever be the 'Pearl Harbor' of almost every self-aware person alive. It's shocking to think that nothing will ever erase what this day comes to mean for the American psyche.   I heard a story on NPR this evening about a government employee who was the only person in his office of 7 to survive the Pentagon attack.  He explained that before 9-11 he and another co-worker, someone he described as a very good friend, would go out for dinner every TH night. When that plane slammed into the Pentagon his friend died. It’s these little thing that made this day so sad. No amount of wars, arrests, foiled attacks, or revisions to the Patriot Act will allow this man to have another dinner with his friend. And I find that upsetting, because it is something you can't control. This to me is the most frightening thing about post 9-11 life.  I can't control if a terrorist is going force another plane into a building, poison the water supply, or fill the air with a deadly chemical.    I guess that is what the Patriot Act is supposed to pre-empt. However, everything I read is about how the government is harassing some naturalized citizen because he refused to spy on his immigrated Middle-East community here in Anytown USA. To me that doesn't seem like progress, just a bunch of shots in the dark with a media spin.  So, for right now, at two years after thousands of people died, I say the terrorist won because look what our American government is reduced to: crushing the some innocent minority's dream of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness so the majority to can sleep easy at night. That is until the next time the government issues a non-specific terror warning.  Maybe in five or ten years, I can feel like the American government is setting the right example of how to treat ALL the people that live. Only then will I say that America won.

       Fall Sports   The Fall edition of kickball started on Monday night. We have a new league and mostly a new team and great new field to play on. No more tripping over gopher holes on the way to second base for me.  We lost - which is not new - but only by one run. We need to get ourselves some kicking power if we are going to compete this year. However this year, we've got ourselves a killer 1st basewoman who, in one inning, made a double play, then made the third out all by her lonesome. Rock solid. In other sports related news, football season has arrived.  Finally . I love me some football and week one was no slouch.  The Redskins beat the Jets; The Eagles lost; Detroit won(!!!), Virginia Tech incinerated their opponent.  The only team that had a disappointing outcome was the Patriots, which made me sad for Adam cuz I know he loves himself some Patriots.  Stereo: Labradford's 'mi media naranja'.

      Yarg, what a day. I spent the morning feeling dizzy and don't really remember anything until about lunch time. Which is actually a blessing considering I was logging video footage. There is nothing as soul-sucking as logging three hours of video.  But things got better as the day wore on. I got to visit my friend Heather and her 10-month old boy, Charlie, after work. Then the fiance and I got Chinese take-away and had a bottle of wine for dinner. Other good points about the day: they've been running various Treehouse of Horror episodes during the Simpson's hour and tomorrow is Friday (and Halloween ).  Rightous!

      Ah, today was much better than yesterday. Yesterday was all panic during my one hour of unwinding. During the hour long block of Simpson's reruns no less. I received three hectic phone calls. The first was from my fiancé’s mother who was panicked about all the weddings - both the fiancé’s & I, as well as the middle sister's. The second was from my mother who was panicked because my sister was stranded on the side of the road in Jersey and was panicking herself. So I then called my sister who was having tire-trauma and panic stricken because she wasn't sure her insta-flat patch would get her to the nearest tire center. When I asked her why she didn't just slap on the spare tire/donut tire she told me she didn't know how to do it, or where to look for the tools. What's worse is neither does her live-in boyfriend. Sigh.  People! Please, if you don't know how to change your tire, get out of your chair and get your driver's manual from your car. It's not a particularly exciting read, but it will explain all. Trust me.  The evening did get better though. I saw "Belle & Sebastian" play at the 930 club. A very good concert - the sound was incredible; the set list was amazing (mostly "Tigermilk", "Sinister", and the 1st three EPs, for those that care); and the banter was hilarious. The opening band - Slumber Party - was rather trite, but they did support Sam's theory of bass-players. Sam will probably want to clarity the theory himself, but it amounts to 'generally, bass players are the coolest looking person in the band'. And this bass player was also a chick, which I believe generates double cool points according to the theory.  Since we are on the topic of Sam, I'm glad that the SoCal fires aren't cramping his temperature (although it seems to be curling his temperament). I still feel bad for all the victims though. Poor souls.  Time to end these mad ramblings. I've decided that I should do some graphic designing at home at least once a week to up my design chops. And I've decided that tonight is the night I should start. It's the middle of the week, seems like a good choice. Peace all

       St. Ides Heaven   I was shocked this morning to learn of the death of  urlLink Elliot Smith , who apparently killed himself Tuesday.  I certainly feel sorry for his family, friends, and loved ones; for Elliot Smith who must have been so fractured as to have done such a terrible and painful thing to himself; and for his artistic voice which I held in great esteem.  While I never saw him perform live, I was always in awe of his ability to write an engaging narrative and wonderful Beatles/Brian Wilson melodies. His solo albums started off with sparse arrangements - voice and guitar - but gradually he added in instruments until he was recording/playing with full bands, which is where his Beatles fascination came into full view.    While I was also engaged by his recordings, I think I will always remember him for the way his songs touched that part of your persona that emerges only on the really bad days when the world has got your back against the wall.  Some people described his music as ‘depressing’, however I would argue that it spoke lessons of defiance – that no matter how bad the thing holding you down is, you are better and smarter than it and eventually you will beat it.  I wonder if he ever saw it that way?  RIP Elliot Smith 1969-2003.

      I, too, now have a comments section on my blog. Lord knows why I even bothered to add one. It will only be used for three things: to point out my poor spelling/grammar, to point out what a goon/nerd I am, and to insult my football team, the Washington Redskins.  Speaking of the 'Skins, THEY SUCK. Oh.my.freaking.god. What is the O-line's problem. Here we are at week seven and the offensive line still doesn't get it: protect your quarterback. For weeks, every team they've played against has said 'it was too easy to get hits on the Patrick Ramsey (the QB); eventually the kid is going to get hurt.' And guest what? He finally did!  I certainly don't want to see anyone get hurt playing a professional sport, especially someone like Ramsey who has take crushing hit after crushing hit for the good of the team. But if this is what it takes to make coach Spurrier wake up. Then GOOD.  Either the coach needs to adjust his protection on a play-by-play basis because lord knows putting a tight end or a 5'7, 235 lb running back against a 6'2 300 lb defensive end is not going to work -OR- he needs to start benching/firing the people responsible for protecting his quarterback. Any previous points (I hope) he has tried to make is not getting across. The entire team has looked sloppy (missed tackles, dropping passes) for the last three games but that's for another post. We won't even get into the 10.7 penalties per game.  The fiancé and I had a nice weekend up in Philly visiting her folks and parading the engagement ring around.  This was our first trip with our new E-Z pass which eliminated waiting in the massively long queue" to pay tolls. What I like best about it is listening to the fiancé yell 'Suckers!" to the other motorists waiting in line as we pull away. A woman after my own heart indeed.

      Mmmm.....glass of milk.  Yesterday was a crazy day. Things at work have been hella-busy so when I come home it take me a good hour to unwind because I'm all pent up with go-go-go-ness.  So what I didn't need yesterday was crazy drivers trying to mow me over in their massive, gas-guzzling machines.  There were two incidents - one where this dude nearly ran a stop sign - and almost collided with me -  because he was too busy talking on his cell phone. The other incident involved this moron who went straight through the intersection I was attemping to cross over from the left hand turn lane. Now, I know I'm not the first person to complain about bad drivers/crazy drivers in the metropolitan DC area. However, I feel that these incidents are so easy to avoid. Simply slow the freak down and pay attention to where you. Look at the freaking pavement for the direction the lane is going; pay attention to the flow of traffic. If only the insurance companies gave you a reduction on you car insurance for every accident that you avoided would we be that much closer to a just world.  In other news, I went to a concert last night at the Black Cat. I meet up with some pals for the  urlLink Pretty Girls Make Graves concert. And what a fabulous concert it was!! The band was so high energy and the crowd was really into every moment of the show. It was nice to get the 'rock out'; I these high stress days I need to remember that a little rocking out goes a long way to relaxing oneself.

      So I have all this comp. time from my traveling to South Carolina and Delaware for work. It's nice to have some comp. time. I can pay bills, go grocery shopping, post on the blog - with ut cutting into evening activities like cooking dinner, eating dinner and cleaning up from dinner.  However, with work being as busy as it is, it's hard to judge which days to leave early. Today was one of those days - which is nice. And since there are no bills to pay, or groceries to shop for I'm going to use the extra time to.....play some video games. hachacha.

       Oh, Happy Day.  And so on October 10, 2003 I proposed to my girlfriend and, happily, she said yes. We called around to family members to share the good news then went off to a nice dinner. I'm sure she will post some details on how I popped the question on her blog, so I won't steal any of the thunder here.  Saturday & Sunday we spent calling friends and other family members - and there is still more to go. Saturday was also Ocktober-fest at the town that backs up to our neighborhood. So we hit that with the mom, and the aunt. Mom, Aunt and I walked around drinking beer while the 'fiancé' stared at her new ring on her finger.   You laugh, but it's true!

      Well, after updating the missus' blog with some link and a nifty comments section I figure I should actually post in mine.   This past weekend I was in Delaware for some National Guard videotaping. The hours were not as intense as the previous trip, however there was a lot of work to be done. But who wants to here about that? We hit a cigar bar our first night in town. I smoked my first cigar then watched two bar fights break out around us. Rehoboth, Delaware is one classy joint during in off-peak parts of the year.  The ol kickball team is not doing so well. The Bobby P's have only mustered one win against our 4 losses. Losing wouldn't suck so much if the games were actually close. It's hard to stay excited about the game if your out of it in the first inning. Eh, whatever. It's supposed to be about the fun and the kicking.   Since I've been working these crazy hours I was able to take Monday off. And since it was Yom Kipper (it's a Jewish holiday; I'm not making this up) the missus was off as well. So we biked down to the local theatre and saw "Lost In Translation". At first I didn't really enjoy it, but since then I've been digesting it in little bits. First off, Sophia Coppolla gets props for making a movie without using trite scenes or quick, clean endings.  Second the soundtrack was great, boasted many a cut by Kevin Shields/My Bloody Valentine.  I wasn't all that bowled over with Bill Murray’s performance, it wasn't bad, but it wasn't "Groundhog Day".  The part(s) of the movie that stuck with me the most were the scenes where the two characters are at there loneliest. While I wasn't that pleased with these scenes at the time of viewing, I'm started to recall them more and more, and really enjoy them. So I guess Ms. Copolla & crew got their message across. It’s definitely a movie that requires more than one viewing.  Bam! That's enough. Time to hit this with a spice weasel.

       Mended   Success! I'm no longer racked with illness!  It's so nice to be let out of the house again. Not that I did a whole lot once out but at least it was something productive - like registering for wedding gifts. We wondered around the store scanning anything that caught our fancy then got hanged a print out of our selections. After looking at the print out I realized that we have expensive taste in home furnishing, none of our friends can afford such pricey items and they will hate us for it. HA!  Monday we be my first day back in the office after missing a week of work. Granted one day was a holiday and I already requested another day off. Still, not having to work for a whole week was niiiiiice. A fella could get used to that life. I image its Sam's life is like! HA! Just kidding.  'Saight. I'm outta hear.

      Sick...Really sick....then BETTER  Sick: Monday the illness took a turn for the worse. Tuesday I went to doctor who told me I had pneumonia and prescribed me antibiotics.  Really sick: Said antibiotics made me throw up all day. So I got new antibiotics that didn't make me ralf up my much needed nourishment.   BETTER! After that I got much better.  Of course, not fast enough to systematically mess up 4 different persons' Thanksgiving plans. Nothing like that to make you feel important. Everyone was headed to fiancé’s aunt's house for thanksgiving dinner. However, when the fiancé and I bowed out, my mum and my sister and her BF had to change directions down to DC. With 5 less people coming to dinner in Allentown PA there was a lot of leftover food at the fiancé’s aunt's. D'oh.  Dispite the change in plans, the fiance and I had a lovely thanksgiving dinner today. Afterwards, we went of to the mum's to have dessert with her, sister and sister's BF.  I hope everyone had a great thanksgiving. Mine was the best I could hope for.  peace out

      "Waylaid"  If you were the same room as me this morning you'd hear this: *hack*cough*sniff*cough*cough*. Yep, I'm sick. I started feeling ill late Saturday night but it wasn't until Sunday afternoon that the fever and cough came on full steam. So I called in sick this morning to work. Which is unusual for me - I don't usually miss anything because of an illness.  I must have some sort of complex because I always think that I'm not that sick I can’t go to class/work/social function. Of course this always made the illness worse turning it into something that hung around for weeks. I don't know when, but it seems I've strayed from that tendency. One school of thought is that it's better to stay home and rest up rather then pushing my immune system to the limit while it is trying to cure me of the virus The other school of thought is that I stay home out of respect for the public; contain the illness rather than spread it around.  Hopefully the flu shot I received a few months ago will speed my recovery. I certainly don't want to be ill during Thanksgiving. There is so much going on: Food, hot tub, food, touch-football, food, dessert and food.

      A week of wedding  This was (one of many, I’m sure) a week of wedding activities. Surely nothing as grand as the last days before the wedding, but those unglamorous, behind the scenes stuff. Tuesday we found one of those old photo booths and took a couple of pictures inside so I can start designing the "save-the-date" cards. Tonight we went to a caterer in Georgetown DC for a menu tasting. The food was good; the people were not as impressive. The owner was all right, but her assistant or whatever she is was a complete nut job. She complained about her bum ankle, her family, her job et al. I might have been a bit more receptive to all that IF she had not spent 30 mins on the phone while we sat waiting for her, with nothing to do (or eat). I don't want to sound cruel, but if I'm only a contract away from giving someone more money that I've ever owned (or technically have at this point) I expect undivided attention. I'm not your friend, I don't want to be your friend, I simply want you to do your job and get on with it. It was the unprofessionalism that got to me.  I get my annual review at work tom. That should be "fun". At least I'll get all that bonus and raise money that they promised us when we 'agreed' as a company to forgo bonuses and raises last year during the shitty economy. That is if they keep their promise  Oh, tonight's ER looks sweet so it’s time to go. I like things that crash and explode.

      Last week was a long, long, long week that seemed like it would never end. And that's bad because I had Monday off! Nothing really made it a 'bad' week; it just seemed to take for.ever for Friday to roll around. That may have been because this weekend was our trip up to NYC to hang out with the sister and her BF.  The wait was certainly worth it! Most of the people I know would agree that NYC rocks, but this weekend was cool thanks to all the little things.  My kid sister and her BF were our tour guides. Instead of hearing things like 'this building is notable because of 'x' piece of social history', we heard things like 'this is the trashcan I puked in on my 20th birthday', 'this is where our friends witnessed a massive fight between jazz nerds' and so on.  Since we stayed at my sister's apartment in Hoboken, I spent my first 15 minutes walking around the apartment recognizing things that she took from our mom's house to decorate with.  My sister and I got a big kick out of it. Highlights of the weekend were getting shop at  urlLink Other Music , an excellent dinner out, and seeing the fiancé’s friend Jen.  The one low-point was missing out on "The Matrix Revolutions" on an IMAX screen. That would have been kick-ass.  Regardless, now I want to move to NYC.

      We played our last kickball game of the year. We, of course, lost but we played out best losing game all season. There were a number of clutch catches and outs as well as a lot of runs scored by us (4!). I was 1 for 1 at the plate with a double and 2 RBI’s; I made 3 outs, including the 3rd out with the bases loaded.  All in all, if we had to lose at least we came away looking like a competent team. Kickball won't resume until the spring when we will switch (yet again) to another league. I am thinking about trying out another co-ed organized sport - flag football - but we shall see. Maybe I can do both next spring.  The wedding weekend was a lovely affair. Highlights were the actual wedding, dancing at the reception, hanging out with the soon-to-be-family, and taking the bride-to-be out for her 'bridal party". Now, I know that normally that is an all girl affair; however there were many things about this wedding that were not normal, such as the bridal party. The bride didn't want strippers, booze and anything of those things. So we devised an evening at the arcade for skeeball and video games. The BF of the youngest sister and I snuck away occasionally to play "Time Crisis II" and "LA Machine Gunners" - the latter being my fav. arcade game.  And since I love video games and I don't know or particularly understand the groom I chose to hang out w/ the fiancé, sisters and younger sister's BF.

       "Lisa, it's your birthday"   I just finished watching the 1st two episodes of "The Simpson's Third Season" DVD.  The third season is really the place to start. The first two seasons are good, but the writing and the guest are just that much better during the third season. The DVD starts off with "Stark Raving Dad" where Homer get committed and meets a person impersonating Michael Jackson. For me, the best part is when Bart and Michael write a song for Lisa's birthday. Don’t ask, I don't know why.  In other news we are heading up to Philly this weekend for the fiancé’s sister's wedding.  Since I have absolutely no responsibilities to the wedding party, I am looking forward to seeing all my to-be-relatives (yikes!). There's rumors of me getting to hole up in the basement with fiancé’s younger sister and BF watching Simpson's & Futurama DVDs (they both are fans)  I'm still not used to the Day-lights Savings adjustment. Leaving work, running errands, lugging junk into the home seems more of a pain in the dark; and its been raining a lot these days so it's dark dark.

       It's Christmas outside, baby   Granted it not hard to notice when Christmas has arrived (according to the commerce sector it's three days before Thanksgiving) however there have been a few signs that may or may not have been directed at yours truly.  Sign 1: Santa Claus ridding atop a fire truck through my neighborhood on a Friday night.  Sign 2: I cut a 20 minute holiday video/DVD for our company's CEO who is overseas serving his country. Inbetween interviews by veteran and new employees alike, as well as shots of the building decked out I stuck songs from  urlLink this  holiday cd.   Sign 3: Various packages arrive at the house every couple of evenings. The doorbell rings and either the fiancÃ© or I jump up to get the package and whisk it away for wrapping later depending on which of us is expecting something to arrive in the mail.  Ho-ho-ha!

       The Squakbox comment that transformed into a blog   I remember reading in the history books that it took a lot of persuasion in both the U.S. and in Europe to actually insert some physical or political pressure against the events in occurring in Germany.  After all it did take the attack at Pearl Harbor to convince America that there was a good fight to fight across the pond.  I think historical times (50's, 60's 40's et al) seem black & white because public opinion has been reinforced by every generation reading the same streamlined historical account in our history textbooks.  Or maybe because World War II was a successful choice; it certainly had a successful effect in Europe, France, Germany, Poland -that effect being freedom.  Those people had their land, liberty, and justice returned to them (although some got it later than others, i.e. East and West Germany).   Vietnam certainly was not a successful military choice. More than two decades later it is still viewed as an unsuccessful military decision, not matter how noble its original intentions. When Vietnam's conclusion reaches its 50 year anniversary I doubt it will be viewed any differently. This one won't age well.  But will the Afghanistan/Iraq conflict be viewed as a having a positive effect on those countries and a positive effect on the international community in 50 years? I think it depends what comes out it. If in the end the US and its allies leave the proper framework for a democratic country to flourish, grow, and sustain itself, then yes. If not, then it may be yet another black mark on the US; one more chance for US leaders and society to second-guess our country as an arrogant aggressor. If in five years all the US government can brag about is that they brought those 'liberated' countries cell phone service and Levi's but not the ability to self-govern then I believe this will not be considered the correct choice and will haunt Bush Jr's. administration for the ages.   And no airport or building re-naming or a presidential mug on some American currency will diminish that blemish from Bush Jr's record.

             you are aquamarine  #7FFFD4         Your dominant hues are cyan and green. Although you definately strive to be logical you care about people and know there's a time and place for thinking emotionally. Your head rules most things but your heart rules others, and getting them to meet in the middle takes a lot of your energy some days.  Your saturation level is medium - You're not the most decisive go-getter, but you can get a job done when it's required of you. You probably don't think the world can change for you and don't want to spend too much effort trying to force it.  Your outlook on life is very bright. You are sunny and optimistic about life and others find it very encouraging, but remember to tone it down if you sense irritation.         urlLink the spacefem.com html color quiz

      Wedding Update! with Tina Fay....  well not quite but now that you are here you may as well read the rest. Wedding related events are progressing nicely. We have a place, a photographer, a lighting designer (in place of flowers) and the bride-to-be has a dress. I am still without clothing but I'm sure that issue will resolve itself before the wedding.  Aside from being responsible for the photographer (success) and the DJ (let's not go there right now) I also have the responsibility of being the enforcer. This part of the wedding planning is actually my favorite. I go to all the meetings and let the missus do most of the talking. Then we leave the place and are promised a proposal in a timely manner. This becomes a lie and the proposal never arrives in a timely manor. Now this is the part I like: I get to call and 'enforce' the promised timeline. I'll call up our potential service-providers and politely remind them of their promise of a timely proposal.  And they are all apologies and excuses, which gives a nice power-trip high. Then the proposal comes (yea!) and then we see how much is costs (eh).  Still it's fun to be the hardass in these situations. People really seem to listen when there is thousands of potential dollars to be had.

      The company I work for occasionally loans out certainly employees to a big name non-profit foundation in the city. I am one of the few employees that have television studio experience so I sometimes head over to this company's studio to assist in the filming of web casts.  Like today I was asked to assist with a web cast that discussed the pros and cons of ordering prescription drugs online and from Canada.  An interesting topic and educational, no doubt; exciting - not really.  Tomorrow’s web cast, now that one will be exciting. Probably the most excited web cast that this company does in the next five years. Why? Because tomorrow's speaker is Bono (yes, U2's Bono). As if that wasn't enough all the international and local new bureaus have been invited to tape it as well. Of course even if I wanted to go and meet 1) someone famous (Bono) or 2) rub elbows with news media persons (CNN, ABC, NBC, NPR etc) I'm not available. Why? Because all this is going on at the same time I have my dentist appointment which I had to reschedule last week because I was ill.  Sigh.  I guess it's better to have a full head of healthy teeth than to meet some famous dude from Ireland.

      New week, new ideas  So for quite a while now I've been telling myself that I should be doing more to advance my creative hobbies - photography, graphic design - and spend less time playing video games. It's not that don't like the video games I have (I do - esp. Simpson's Hit & Run). It's just that I think I took a piece of advice from a good friend a few years ago and turned it into a requisite part of my day. So what - you may say? Well when I spent a good 15 hours a week playing video games I think that's a problem. Especially when I've got better things to work on - like a professional portfolio, or, say a blog that needs updating.  I'd like this not be one of those New Year’s resolutions that get discarded around April. The wedding has given me a good chance to flex my graphic design skills by creating a save-the-date postcard, website, and invitations.  Once those things get squared away it will really be up to me to devote time to polishing and learning new skills I can take to the work place.  Well time for a salmon dinner (I’ll explain why I know this during the next post)

      Middle of the week - yea! Also know as 'hump day' which is never as fun as it first sounds. This week so far has been National Guard video production week. Monday and Tuesday I did audio (boom mike coming through!) and producing (get that boom mike out of the shot!) which isn't a bad gig. However today I was solo as a photographer. Typically, when one works video production you have multiple people to help you out - audio person, camera person, producer, and maybe even a grip. As a photographer I got no one - just me. Which at times can be nice because nothing beats working by yourself (you get to take all the credit if it comes out killer).  What made today long and arduous was that I had to shoot outside the whole time in the cold, cold weather. So I'm really tired........no running tonight for me. I figure I've been out in the cold enough today.   The National Guard kids we are working with are, well, mostly kids. One of them is a 19 year old scheduled to deploy overseas in March. While he does not seem concerned about being on the frontlines he's confessed to our production team that he really hopes he's married before he ships.  Since he's not mentioned dating/seeing/being involved with anyone I'm guessing he's got two months to find and marry a gal.  I can see how being deployed overseas into such places as Iraq or Afghanistan would be stressful - and how some of that stress might be dissipated if said person had a loved one waiting and praying for them back home. So I do hope he finds one - because he really wants one. However the realist in me thinks he's going to have to tough it out solo this time. Poor lad.

       New Year, New Post   It's just 10 days late. But I have good excuses - work things (thought I was going to be fired) and Maryland cop things (got a speeding ticket on New Year’s Day) and fiancé’s hating of people she works with. However all was set right on January 9th when I woke up and found it was snowing - just like it did 26 years ago when I was born. So that rocked. Plus I was taken out to a pork chop and applesauce dinner. And I got balloons - which is a quirky family tradition.  On our birthdays, my parents would sneak into our rooms and cover the floor with balloons as a surprise. While I didn't wake up to a floor of balloons this year I did get a fleet of balloons so I think it counts.  I'm off to the Big DC Flea Market. This really isn't something I'm 'ecstatic' about attending. However I'm trading it for the privilege to watch 8 hours of football playoffs this evening.

       Wham (Re-Bop-Boom-Bam)   You might ask yourself, "What am I talking about?" I'm talking about jazz.  About two weeks ago I decided that I would listen only to jazz while driving to work and also when I was designing at home.  The original reason was born from the urge to spend a good deal of time 'taking in' my various jazz cds. I certainly don't listen to them as much as I do my pop music cds.  As I've spent the last week listening to Albert Ayler and Mildred Bailey (it's as far as I've got - my trip to work isn’t that long. Plus I have 10 Mildred Bailey cds) I found that I arrive to work and at home very relaxed. This is good in the morning because I’m in the right mood for taking on the hectic 8 hour days I am currently experiencing at work. And during the ride home it helps decompress from the day, at least helps more than some angst-ridden indie rock.  I don't mean to imply the jazz is inherently relaxing music. Albert Alyer is quite a fiery jazz man, as are the Tim Bern cds that are next in line.  Rather, for me, jazz requires a different kind of listening.  With rock/pop the guitars are usually cranked up or fuzzed out that it's hard to discern - say - the bass lines - from the rest of the rhythm.  However, with jazz it seems easier to pick out the rhythm of the different instruments. For instance, in this one Mildred Bailey song, everything just peeled away to a xylophone and some brass. Very pretty, IMO.  I'm sure everyone approaches music differently. This is just me. Boring you.  WRITE A COMMENT!

      I was going to post about how excited I am of some upcoming or recent cd releases however I got distracted and did a little research. If you search for 'Jason Hunter Blog' you get the following results:   urlLink The Programmer versions of me .  urlLink The message board version of me (complete with moose head) .  urlLink Literati me .  Ha. Good for a larf.  Congrats to Adam who was the first person to send me his measurements for the tuxedoes.  I was surprised that both he and Sam beat my sister's boyfriend. When I put the request out three weeks ago I thought that my sister would hound her boyfriend until he got himself measured (since they live together) while Sam would still be laying out on the beach and Adam would be pounding the pavement looking for start-up capital (or something like that). But lo and beyond! Adam comes in first with Sam a close second. And Mr. Daniel Fish.....well we've not heard from him. It just goes to show that you can be surprised  everyday !  END POST!

      Max'n & Relax'n  Ah......doing nothing.  Since I had to work all through last weekend I celebrated this weekend by doing.....nothing.  Well, not nothing. I did pick up the living room and do some laundry. I tried to work on the wedding invitations but got interrupted by the telephone and lost my good intentions. Oh, well I guess that can wait for Monday - which I have off thanks to the magic of comp. time.    After a stagnant couple of weeks at work I was finally given the chance to get some video shooting experience in which made very pleased. Also on Friday I successfully light two different scenarios.  I've light stuff for production before but it's always needed some insight from more experience people. So TH & F I felt like I had made some serious strides at work which, in turn, made me feel great. I just hope to continue getting chances to improve my skills and in turn get more video production experience.  We watched "Final Destination" on the Sci-Fi channel tonight. While some of the foreshadowing was a bit obvious the plot proposed a seriously disturbing notion about cheating death and the consequences. There were many moments that had me freaked out. Overall I give it a "B".  Peace out!

       Home Alone   Since I had to work over the past weekend I was allowed to use some comp. time today. So I had the day off. I still got up at the same time (7:15am) but that's okay. I got to finish reading the chapter I'd started last night in  urlLink this  book, eat a leisurely breakfast of eggs, toast, bacon and wash it down with coffee and plan this weekend's Valentine's Day event(s). The last activity is the most important aspect of my day since I noticed - today - that my original Valentine's Day plan (which I thought was a damn sweet lock) is on a Saturday and not Sunday like I first thought.  And that is bad because my fiancé will be at work on Saturday. So nuts to that. But I've got a new plan hooked up and it's all good.  Thanks to everyone that weighed in on my previous post.  I guess I should have just chilled out about the whole situation and remembered that just because I make one choice doesn't mean everyone else should make the same one.  Looking back I think my frustration came from the fact that we were a production team and that everyone on that team should have done what's best for the production as a whole (i.e. not getting drunk the night before).  And while we were off the clock such actions could have a direct effect on the production. However since there was 'no harm/no foul' then I really shouldn't worry about it. After all, even if it had seriously compromised the production what could I have done about it? I'm not a manager.  Lessons learned. Hu-zah. Time to go cook the chicken's that have been marinating all day.

       Everybody's Working on the Weekend   Well, not everybody. Just 5 people from work and two freelancers the company hired.  We went up to the sleepy state of Delaware to film some instructional videos. Our first night there I witnessed some - in my opinion - disturbing behavior by my colleagues.  It was our first night in town and the whole crew plus the client went out to dinner - where many a drink was had - then off to a bar where the client, 3 different managers, and the rest of the production crew drank themselves stupid. So stupid that the client and our business manager passed out on the bar. Two other company managers were trashed and the rest of the production crew was either drunk or well on their way to being so. I hope I'm the pot calling the kettle black - I drink both at dinner and at the bar however I was at no point drunk.  All this made me really, really mad at how unprofessional this was. We'd just arrived into town, had yet to shoot a single frame of footage, and everyone is toasted at 11:00 pm with a 7:00 am "call" (production-speak for a predetermined time when we leave for our destination - i.e. the location). Typically this level of intoxication is reserved for the last night in town - not the first. Several times I mentioned to different managers that everyone is drunk and we should go before it gets too late. All of them simply brushed me off and told me not to worry about it.  Well maybe someone should have listened to me since we were over two hours late arriving at our location the next day. Half of the crew was still drunk and everyone had a hang over. But maybe it didn't matter, since everyone that I worked with gave a 100% effort through out the day.  What made me so mad is that the same managers mentioned above are so strict about certain company policies yet lack any sense of proper and professional judgment when they are out of town and on the clock. I've seen this type of behavior before at other shoots and in other locations. And I despise them for it. They've been made managers and yet they act like 18 year olds at a keg party when they should be setting the example.   Anyone who is interested in responding please do because I'm curious about what others think of this situation.  Has anyone found themselves in a similar situation? By similar, I mean that you were both frustrated and embarrassed by a manager's unprofessional behavior?  Does professionalism really matter when the client has passed out on the bar? Is it okay to sweep any and all proprieties under the rung by simply declaring 'what happened out of town stays out of the office' (i.e. don't talk about it to anyone at the office)? Is my outrage unjustified since everyone was able to work through their hangovers and get the job done - therefore since there was no harm to the work was there no foul?

       Massive Neglect.   Whoa! Yes, I know I'm guilty of not updating this thing in forever. Therefore, today's blog will be an update on the wedding progress.  Below is list of recent wedding accomplishments:  We have completed our tasting with the caterer. The food was bountiful and excellent. We also selected the tablecloths, settings, chairs et al. We have located a DJ service, but have not found the right DJ. We dismissed the 1st one selected for us, but, on the positive side we have 34 more to chose from. We have located when, where, through which government office we get our marriage license from. Apparently, bridesmaid's dresses have been purchased. Although I was awoken at 1 am and told this so I could have misunderstood what was being said. The hard-copy versions of the Save-The-Date cards have been addressed and will be mailed tomorrow. We are currently interviewing rabbis.  There are probably other things that I've not mentioned but "Law & Order" is about to come on. And that means it's time for the fiancé to fall asleep on the couch with her feet in my lap. Ah, engagement bliss!

       Cherry Blossom Fever   This weekend was a reprieve from the boring, cold, miserable weather that we Virginians have experience for the last 6 months.  After the rain clouds lifted on Saturday afternoon, the F and I meet up with Jenny S. for a sit on the National Mall. We watched the kite festival as we waited for one of Jenny's friend's, Maria, to show up.  We nearly got clipped in the head by some low flying kites flown by tots. Fortunately (for them cuz I would have so kicked their ass) no collisions occurred.  Once Maria joined us, we strolled over to the Tidal Basin and observed the cherry blossoms and the sun setting.  Four hours after we left the Tidal Basin someone jumped into it and drowned. Freakish, and sad. After leaving DC we had some Mexican dinner in Shirlington where we were joined by another of Jenny's friends, Cathy.  Sunday we drove back into DC. This time the National Gardens for some engagement photos with our wedding photographer. This was followed by a nice leisurely drive home in DC traffic. It wasn't as bad as it could have been. It was nice and warm outside and the sun roof was open. Who could ask for more?  >>>

       I Want To Be A Producer   Eh, Wednesday. Nothing to get excited about.  I went on a video shoot for my company today. We videotaped a stand-up interview at the tidal basin with the president of the National Parks Conservation Association.  I was billed as a 'Location Manager" but really it's a just a fancy term for "Producer". I was in charge of coordinating the freelancer photographer we hired, making sure our permit papers were in order in case the Park Police harassed us,  and coralling everyone onto the same page.  In the middle of all this I realized that I enjoyed being in charge of things.  I don't get to do it much at work, which would explain why, sometimes, I'm unhappy with my current position.    Of course I should probably not write such things while  at  work. See, I was too lazy (i.e spent too much time playing video games) last night to type up my blog yesterday. On to other topics....  I've rekindled my, and F's, desire to drive her car, which is a standard. I did amazingly better than my first attempt. This time I actually went from 1st to 2nd without stalling AND drove it around our neighborhood. Cheers! Tonight is the  urlLink Broken Social Scene  show at the Black Cat , which I'm sure I will write about in the next post. Until then...  >>>

       Cakes By Madonna   With both the F sick and the F's mother in town it was a low-key but (none the less) good weekend.  One of the more exciting events this weekend was the double-feature of " urlLink Tremors 2 " and "Jaws" on late night television. More exciting than that was the free cake we had for lunch.   Our cake decorator / designer / maker - Stephen - made a house call for the cake tasting.  The cakes were very good and the price was right so we signed a contract and threw down a deposit. When I wrote Stephen the deposit check I noticed that his last name was 'Ciccone'. Jokingly I ask if he was related to Madonna. To my surprise, he said 'Yes' and explained that he and the Material Girl share a great-grandfather.  So when y'all come to the wedding this July you will be eating a cake made by someone related to a famous person. I have now set the bar for weddings considerably high. If the rest of your crazy bachlor/ettes don't have at least one famously-related person provide a service at your wedding I might not come. Just thought I'd give you fair notice.  >>>

       Sick Chickens   March has not been a good month for the fiancé ("F" from here on out) and I.  I started out the month of March with a cold/cough thing that took me two weeks to get over.  Then, right as I get better, F gets ill. Ill in a way that requires out patient surgery and lots of 'off-your-feet-bed-rest'.  Looking back across our relationship we have been sick chickens for a majority of the time.  In fact, right around the time that we began dating I was sick for a month. Then I developed a rather painful stomach condition that requires medication. Then the F (girlfriend at the time) was sick with a cough for almost four months. Skipping ahead, both Thanksgiving and Christmas 2003 were cancelled when one of us got pneumonia.  I'd like to think that we are just getting all the sickness out of the way so we can enjoy the rest of lives without illness. However I doubt it.  For the people that have known me for a while (ie. all that read this blog) me + constant sickness = a given fact. However, for the both of us to be constantly sick that's just strange. I 'axe' you a question: What's up with dat?

       Escape From New York   The weekend in NYC was wonderful, sometimes hurried, but still wonderful.  We arrived in Hoboken in time for lunch and a showing of Jumanji on my sister's cable network. Then we cleaned up both the kitchen and ourselves for the showing of "The Producers", which was very good. It was amusing to watch Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick out-crack each other up on stage and break character. After the show as we exited through a back alley we saw  urlLink Richard Belzar  walking backstage. Being the "Law & Order" freaks that my fiancé and I are, we were very, very excited.  Sunday involved shopping and subsequently purchasing paper for our wedding invitations at  urlLink Kate's Paperie  which was a cool stationary store despite it being an actual stationary store. Big ups to  urlLink Jen W.  for crawling out of bed and meeting us downtown for lunch 12 hours after throwing a raging birthday party for her fiancé.  And now....back to the grind.

       S-M-A-T   This week has not been a banner example of how I am a smart human that can function in society.  On Monday I went to the dry cleaners to pick up two shirts. I paid the woman behind the counter and promptly left. 4 hours later as I was cleaning up from dinner, I realized that I had walked out of the cleaners and left my shirts there. D'oh. So the next morning I went back and explained this to the gentleman behind the counter, who responded with, "Oh, yes. Your shirts are right over here. [The girl working last night] told everyone about you". Sigh.  And then tonight my brain decided to ask my fianc? what she wanted for dinner in this fashion: "Honey, what do you want for pizza tonight?"  We are however not having pizza for dinner. Instead we are having shrimp salad. Not nearly as fun, but healthier for us.  Maybe a weekend in the big apple will cure me of my stupiditis.  (I love the valley OH!)

       New York, New York, It's a Hell of a Town   My company has a policy that its employees should spend 80% of their time on billable projects and 20% of time on training.  This past week I completed some percentage of that training at the ShowBizExpo in NYC.  I walked through the trade show, drooling over expensive lighting equipment and sat in on some training workshops for lighting. I learned some excellent tips on how to light subjects dramatically and quickly for video, which I hope to put into practice at work soon.  Work paid for the train ticket to NYC and the admission fee but we were responsible for our own lodgings. I chose the casa de Monica and Dan - my sister and boyfriend’s place in Hoboken, NJ. They had send me explicit directions on which trains to take and where to gets cabs in order for me to get to Hoboken NJ at 11pm. They did such a great job of explaining how the transit system work that I actually understood it this time!!! My previous two attempts at riding NYC/NJ trains have ending in horrible disasters of me getting hopelessly lost. Buoyed a day of successful train riding, I took the on the '4,5,6' and went 'downtown' (important things to know when riding their metro) to Manhattan for shopping at one of my favorite record stores,  urlLink Other Music .  So, all in all, it was a great week. I learned lots of new and useful things about my profession, I got in some records shopping, I got to see my sister, and I got to read (and subsequently finish) the book " urlLink Our Band Could Be Your Life ".

       You Know Its Thursday When...   The house is wreck, the fridge and the cupboard are empty and you   almost   want to stay on the couch and watch  Will & Grace .  Almost. It's been a rough week and I'm glad it's almost over. The constant problems with allergies along with various problems large and small have left me completely wiped out. I just want to crawl into bed and wake up Saturday morning; skipping right over Friday.  That sounds like a great idea. I think I will go crawl into bed right now. Of course, I won't be able sleep all of Friday away as I should go to work. But I think a night of turning in early will do me some good.   Peace >>>

       April Brings Bridal Showers   The F had her bridal shower in Philly this weekend.  It was splendid, we got lots of presents, and she was pleased. I'm not going to go into details here since she has a blog and can write about it there. I'm just going talk about the weekend, which swung between being quiet and hectic - but in the good ways.  The trip up was rather unpleasant. My allergies acted up most of the way and we followed a storm that traveled north for the duration of the trip. By the time we got to Philly I was tired and zombie-fied (from the allergies) which caused me to forget my manners when we shared a bit of news with the future mom-in-law and I didn't get the response I expected.  However I tried to make up for it the next day by being extra nice. While the bride-to-be and her mates went shopping I let the mom-in-law hide in the basement with me when her parents harangued her too much, as they are wont to do from time to time. I switched between the NFL draft and re-runs of  SG1  and  Babe .  Sunday was the day of the shower but before that the bride, her mates, and I played a few rounds of frisbee golf down at the local park. Then come the shower and all the hectic-ness of having to be re-introduced to relatives I'd meet at some point before. I wonder how many times I can get away with not remembering if someone is an aunt or a cousin before they start punching me in the face.  >>>

       An Explosion of Spring   It's warm. It's sunny. Everything is green. Why, it must, of course, be spring and with spring comes pollen. Pollen that coats my car, that gets in my eyes and my nose. It makes me sneeze and hack and look miserable. It also makes me sound like a grouch because I hate pollen, therefore I hate spring. I hate that pollen is everywhere; making my allergies go nuts. I like summer and fall much better. Of course, winter is the best since nothing grows at all.  The F and I are off to Philly tomorrow night. She is having one of her two bridal showers. The showers required splitting up so all of her friends scattered across the east coast could be present for the event.  It works out rather well the F will be busy at the shower. This leaves me plenty of time to watch the NFL draft with her brother-in-law and grandfather. Good times!

       "Some days the line doesn't move at all....we call those days weekdays..."    The DMV gets a lot of flack for its astounding incompetence.  I'm here to say that it is 100% justified. Everyone has their horror story about a terrible DMV experience and I'm here to throw mine into the mix (I've actually got two stories but that's for another time).   Last night in New Jersey my sister's boyfriend was driving my sister's car when a cop pulled him over for expired tags. After running the car's information through the Virginia DMV database they concluded that the car was unregistered. Thus, they impounded the car, fined my sister's boyfriend, called him a cab, and left him on the side of the highway. It turns that when my mom sold me her 96 Accord the DMV took it upon themselves to mark both my mother's 96 and 94 Accord (the one my sister has) as sold. Miraculously, the DMV still saw it fit to bill my mother for registration and property tax every year since then.  The woman at the DMV counter admitted this much to my mother. However, when my mother asked her for the documents that supported this explanation the woman refused. She even told my mother that all the managers are not working at that particular office today.  After a lot of calls to the Richmond office of the DMV (with some assisted phone-bullying from me) my mother actually found a person at the DMV that gave a damn (I know, I was shocked to hear it as well). The woman wrote up a letter explaining how the error was the responsibility of the DMV, not anyone in my family) and faxed it to my mother. Hopefully this letter will convince the NJ police to wave the $200+ fines against my sister's boyfriend. Oh, and get the car out of the impound lot.  As my sister said this afternoon, “You’re not ghetto until you’ve had your car impounded”.

      Gorgeous Weather  A rogue bratwurst had me in it's death gripe all of Monday which prevented me from blogging. However, that was then. Let it be known that a mere bratwurst can not keep me from my loyal readers.  Finally some gorgeous weather has arrived in DC.  As a bonus I managed not to squander it by playing computer games all weekend. Instead I took a walk over to the local Blockbuster, jogs through the neighborhood and plowed through a bit of "About A Boy" while lounging in my backyard.  I finally got around to watching "Matrix Revolutions" which was ultimately disappointing. My favorite part of the movie took place in the 1st 30 minutes.  When Morpheous, Trinity and Serif went into the Frenchman's night club. Like  urlLink RocketManYeah  had pointed out a few weeks ago it could have been a great cap on the overall storyline but just fell flat.  >>>

       Top Five   The following records have experienced high-rotation on the stereo. This isn't a top five records of the year. Just a top five records that I've immersed myself in, that I can not escape, that get repeated the moment they finish.    1) Jim Guthrie - Now, More Than Ever [2004] 2) The Shins - chutes Too Narrow [2003] 3) Broken Social Scene - You Forgot It In People [2002] 4) The Wrens - The Meadowlands [2003] 5) Supersilent - 6 [2003]  Now, not all of these records are for everyone. However, I strongly encourage my readership (all 3 of you) to seek out the Jim Guthrie album.  It is a pop album framed around lush orchestration and folk flourishes.  I highly suspect that this album will become my #1 driving home from (x) event this summer.    Okay, I promise not to do a 'Top Five Record' list for a while. I know it's lame. >>>

       "No Phone Home"   Last night I discovered that my cell doesn't work anymore. By 'doesn't work' I mean it can't hear anything coming out of the little speaker. However, if I plug in my ear piece/headphone thing I can hear just fine.  My assumption is that I've dropped it one too many times. What I can't figure out is why did it break just now. The last time I dropped it was a few days ago.  So.....crap. Now I have to buy a new cell phone.  At first I was bent out of shape having to spend all that money on a new cell phone. However I've decide to take a zen approach to it. Granted, I still don't want to spend the money but I've come to the realization that you only buy something to wait for it to break.    ...Tree falling in the woods... >>>

      "You Are What You Eat"  I do apologize for the lack of posting last week.  A couple of pressing matters reared their heads and had to be slapped down. Some of them make for interesting reads which might be posted this week.  In fact, here is a good one:  Community regulations 'forbid' taking the trash out to the curb until the morning. Still most people take their trash out the night before, once it is dark. We fall into the latter category, typically. However one night/day last week we did not. So with coat on and bag lunch in hand I head for the door when I remember I forgot the trash. I head into the kitchen and grab the trash bag. As I head out the door for the second time I notice that "F" has kindly bagged up the bathroom trash (but selfishly not taken it out when she left). So I re-shuffle kitchen trash and bag lunch to accommodate bathroom trash. Then I notice the stack of out-going bills on the table. Again, I re-shuffle kitchen trash, bathroom trash and my lunch bag to make room for the mail. Finally, I'm out of the house. I stick the mail in the mail box, and to my relief, drop all the trash which has gotten damn heavy during my walk to the curb. I hop in the car and I'm off to work.  As I grab my workbag & gym bag out of the backseat I realize that I'm missing my lunch. In fact, I had thrown it out with the trash! Cripes! So I drive back to the apartment and rummage through the trash bag piles on the curb. Right as I find my lunch bag, one my neighbors exits his house. So I do my best to pretend that I didn't just dig my lunch out of the trash - and that someone witnessed it - and drive back to work.    On the positive side, I was only 30 minutes late for work that day. >>>

       "Not The Face!"   The F and I went kitten shopping this weekend. One of the first stops was at a Pet Co / Pet Land / Pet Something in Falls Church. We found ourselves a nice 2 year old cat. The history was a bit sketchy since he was found, wounded, along the side of the road. Still he was adorable; he had some wild tiger-like markings. We got to hold him and play with him for a bit. We were about one minute from taking him home when a minor hell broke lose.  Like most stores, this Pet Something allows owners to bring in their pets - like dogs. Well, two dogs started barking at each other which freaked out the cat. What did it do? Well, it sunk both it's paws (with claws) into my face. One of the claws came alarmingly close to my left eye. While slowly taking each claw out of my face the owner tried to make the most of a hopeless situation. Ultimately, F decided that we should not get a cat that goes for the face. To which I agreed.  Even though we left without a kitten, I didn't go home empty-handed. I walked out of the store with four evenly-spaced puncture marks on both sides of my face which I wore for the rest of the weekend.  So, if you are a cute kitten that does not go for the face, please deposit yourself on our doorstep. Otherwise, sod off!  >>>

       Hurdle Hurdled   And so, a milestone of the wedding planning has been hurdled. We have sent our invitations to the printer. Of course, the next task, which will be gargantuan, is to label and mail the invites. It is nice to have the invitations finalized, however. I took us (me) a while to get the designs finalized. Of course, that might be due to my meager design skills.  Ha!  I'm just going to stop this post now. I don't have much to say today. I blame the crap-tastic weather.

       Seven Years   Yesterday marked the seven year anniversary of my father's death.  I never know what to do when this day rolls around.  Obviously I'm sad. What I mean is that I don't know how to act? Do I stay at home and not go to work? Go to church? I doubt my Dad would want that. After all, he demanded that I stay at college - 4 hours away from home - even while he spend months in the hospital battling cancer.  He never wanted us kids to disrupt our plans on his account.  I do regret not putting college on hold and returning home.  What I regret more is that my Dad was only alive long enough to witness me being a punk-ass teenager. I wish - at the very least - he had the chance to enjoy all the effort and love he put into raising me. Then he would have been able to hang out with his son as a man rather than an ambivalent and angst-y teen.  >>>

       Catching Up   The late nights and early mornings of the Jersey trip, the yard sale, and the  urlLink Novasocial  concert finally caught up with me this week as I was a complete slug both at work and at home.  Three nights of going to be early remedied that problem. It also pointed out that I can no longer party like it’s 1999 without repercussions.  I am looking forward to this weekend for many reasons. I will have the time to attend to some wedding details, there will hopefully be a sale at Best Buy where I can get a good deal on a digital camera, and, I can relax. Relaxing will be a big priority since this is the last weekend I have free to do nothing until I am married. From here on out it’s: trip to NYC, the F’s shower, a wedding, another wedding, yet another wedding, then my wedding.  In other news, I discovered that William Gibson has a  urlLink blog  and my bud Kylos has created a  urlLink web site  for his photography.  TGIF, surf the web a little.

       Morning Buzz   The cicadas are in full effect this morning.  When I watered the plants in our backyard their droning was the loudest I'd ever heard in our neighborhood. I can even here them when I'm downstairs, that is until the A/C kicked in.  As a sidenote, damn you Delta Airlines for having the shittiest, most incomprehensible website for checking on the status of arriving flights.  It would have been easier and more efficient if I'd sent an intern to the airport and had him report back to me. Now that I've said my peace I'm going to get dressed and pick up a red-eye flying, sleep deprived, (most likely) cranky fiance at the airport.

       SOLD!   The crazy yard sale is done. Mom's community had it's annual big yard sale today. We put mad stuff out for sale and people bought it up like mad. Almost every big ticket item - TV cabinet, coffee table, bedroom set - was sold. The little stuff didn't sell so well but most of it was junk, honestly.  Still, we made over $200 which will go directly to the wedding fund.  You'd think that after that the selling would be over! Wrong! After packing everything back into the garage we trekked on over to the CD Celler in Falls Church and I sold mad cds, purchased 4 used cds against that sale and still got $50 back. That $50 will be added to the wedding fund as well.  Big ups to my bud Bryce for helping me set up and hanging out. Without him it would have been a difficult time moving all the big furniture. He saved the day, for sure.  Plus I wouldn't have had anyone to pass the time with by talking about video games, movies, and gossiping about people we knew in high school but don't talk to anymore.  Since I got up at 6 am (arg!) on a Saturday (sacrilegious!) I'm going to pass out on the couch. Or failing that, the floor.

       Up & Back    What day is it? My 'weekday clock' is out of wack due to having Wednesday off. I walk around the office with the feeling that it's a brand new week rather than the end of a very stressful one. I took yesterday off so I could drive up to New Brunswick NJ with Mom, cheer for my sister at her various graduation events, eat a fancy dinner, then hop on board an Amtrak train back to Washington DC.   It amazes me that I can start a day in my own house, travel through 2 different states, celebrate/chill/eat in a third state and retrace my steps so I can crawl back into bed with my F at the end of day. I tell you this - the east coast rules for interstate travel!  The craziness at work has died down since the video department met its deadline at COB Tuesday. As I griped about it in a previous post - a lot was going on - but I was able to handle it all and still look good. (oooohh yeah).  Obviously I'm punchy from going to bed at 1 am last night so I'm going to eat some cheese and take a nap on couch.

       Big Week, Big News   This is a very big week for me at work. Since my manager is going out of town I have inherited project managing a round of videos - all 24 of them to be exact. I am personally charged with editing 5 of them myself, but I would have had to do that with or with out a vacationing manager.  In addition to that, I am producing an off-site video event tomorrow then filming man-on-the-street interviews for the rest of the week. I have the sneaking suspicion that management is seeing if I will step up to plate and contribute big time or begin warming the unemployment pine. So far, I've managed not to screw it up, but I've said a couple of stupid things due to stupid nerves.  Since talking about my job is boring and cliché I'll share some tasty news that I've been holding back.  The F and I are moving...yet again. In a calculated move to destroy all good-will amongst our friends we are moving into my mother's town house in August. It's not a lame as it sounds because my mother will have quit her job and moved overseas by then. Mom has finally been selected for a job she’s coveted for four years.  Ergo congratulations to Mom on the new job. And hooray for paying very little rent in a three-level town home with a garage!  Anybody want to help me move?

       Its In The Mail   Whoa! Dig the crazy new blogger interface. It's slightly unsettling but I do dig the large EVERYTHING - buttons, links, titles, the large use of white space.  The weekend was evenly divided between being sluggish and active.  Sluggish activities included playing computer games and watching Futurama DVDs. Saturday was a treat; as I spent it with my pal and former roommate Jenny. We put in a round of mini-golf. Jenny got 4 different whole-in-ones, yet still lost to me by one point. Afterwards I tasted one the 'test-tarts' that she planned on baking for her mom on mother's day. The 'test-tart' was exceptionally lemony and 100% scrumptious. Also, I got to see how her new roommate has decorated my former room. It's very different; it doesn't look like my room at all.  I still haven't heard from my doctor concerning the unidentifiable mass in my infected sinus cavities so no news there.    Oh! Two other very big reasons why Saturday was a treat: One, the F and I mailed out our wedding invitations, and two, 9 months after I promised F, I purchased an entertainment center that she's wanted for our TV and stereo components. Is this a female thing? I don't understand why we want to hide the fact that we can afford a television and stereo....It's like putting fancy rims on your whip - you shouldn't hid the fact that you can afford nice things. Well, maybe that's not the best example but fellas I'm sure you're feeling me.

       The Mysteries of Life   I had my allergy testing on Wednesday. I get these every couple of year so the doctors can fine-tune my allergy shots.  When the doc got the results back he asked me a bunch of questions concerning my sinus congestion. I was under the impression that my sinus were freaking out because of the sky rocketing levels of pollen. According to my fresh batch of allergy results I should not be  that  allergic to spring pollen. So he ordered an x-ray of my enormous head.  It turns out I?ve had a sinus infection for the last 3 weeks and that something is growing in my sinus cavity. They don?t know what it is though - which is why I?m having a CAT scan tomorrow morning. Thus the mystery will be solved. Hopefully?  To keep our minds off what it might actually be growing in my head (spider eggs, spanish gold, pocket change) let?s visit some web sites of recent interest.  First up:  urlLink The back of my sister's head was on TV (click the link then click the 1st link in the list). This is a horrible streaming video (more like flip-book) but near the end look for an audience member wearing an orange/pink jacket in the front row. That?s my sister.   Next:  urlLink A break-dancing bear and his hip-hop friends .  And last: An interesting read about the  urlLink Savannah School of Art & Design . I thought about enrolling here for graduate school but my college advisor recommended against it. For good reason; I don?t think greed, pipe bombs, censorship, and RICO investigations are conducive to a positive learning environment.

       And The Money Keeps Rolling In...   On Friday the company I work for passed out quarterly bonuses. Much rejoicing was done in the house of Dawn & Jason for the bonus was a few hundred shy of a regular paycheck! The bonus was immediately deposited in the wedding account making a very healthy account indeed!  Then today my manager pulled me aside and explained that my extra efforts in video production had been noticed by the higher-ups. Thus I was awarded another bonus of $100. In the form of a Best Buy gift card. Which is fine because it's free money, however I'm just so cash poor due to wedding savings that I was actually hoping for cash. Still it's a $100 of my own money that I don't have to spend at Best Buy.  In fact, hello Futurama Volume 3, Goodbye pants!  >>>

      A Letter From New York  The F and I are back in NYC this weekend.  I experienced some arduous travel in driving from DC last night. I hit rush hour in DC, Baltimore, Delaware, and NYC. Throw in two thunderstorms that pounded the east coast and you get a 6 hour drive with plenty of stop-and-go traffic. It wasn't all bad though. I got to chat with some peeps on the phone (with hands free device - no dangerous driving from this bloke) and listen to many 'eclectic' cds that the F wouldn't tolerate had she been in the car (she took the train up early in the week).  Looking forward to our friends getting married today. They are getting married in a park under the Brooklyn Bridge. The weather forecast says it's gonna be a bright, sun-shiny day. Bright! Bright! Sun-Shiny Day. All that is definitely worth some crappy driving conditions.

       Wedding T minus 4   You may be asking yourself, 'What the hell does T minus 4 mean"? It means the F and I attended the first of 3 weddings between now and our wedding. Since I don't want someone else's wedding to be number 1 (apologies to Jen W.) I thought we'd countdown NASA style.  We attended the wedding of S and L. We are friends with the couple, F has been friends with S since they were college freshmen. Since we don't know any of their friends so we went to the dance floor. The dance floor was in a separate room and when we got there we were greeted by a very lonely, neglected DJ that promised to play whatever we wanted. So he played some Elvis and some James Brown while we danced. Then some more people wandered by to watch us act the fool on the dance floor. Then a 13 year old did some breakdancing and, slowly, the dance floor came alive. The DJ thanked us profusely for getting his party started, and the next morning, at breakfast, many people recognized us as that 'great dancing couple'.

       In The Key of B   Babies.Baseball.Bridal. All of those things factored into the last couple of day.     Baby .  Our very pregnant friend and her mum spent 6 days with us before they headed back to Turkey.  It was great fun to have good friends that we only see a few times a year (if that) roaming around our house. I even got to poke around at the pregnant belly and feel random parts of the baby poking back, at the request of the mother, of course. It was as strange as it was amazing.   Baseball .  I joined 49 other awesome people on a bus trip to see the Baltimore Orioles play the SF Giants.  There was plenty of drinking on the way up, at the game, and on the way home. However when the beer stopped flowing there was still awesome people around to sober up with.   Bridal .  The F had both her bridal shower and her bachelorette party the same day as the baseball game. I was told she had a good time and her sluggish scooting around the house the next day confirmed as such. I tried to stay up in hopes of catching her in party mode but, alas, after a day of drinking I was only able to stay up till 1am.

       Thrashing About   Prior to our house guests arriving yesterday the F and I were thrashing about the house in an effort to tidy it up.  A majority of the cleaning was done by her since she finished school on Tuesday. However I did pitch in when I came home from work.  Once we meet our nightly quota of cleaning an entire room we switched gears to wedding responsibilities. This was a breakthrough week for wedding decisions because we  finally  agreed on our first dance song.  To celebrate our week of hard work I went off to the Black Cat to see  urlLink Braid  on their reunion tour. It was an amazing show! The band was hyper-energetic on stage, and most of the audience responded by singing and/or dancing along. And if that wasn't enough to make for a good evening, I had dinner and drinks with an old pal from my aborted grad school days. Overall rating: A 4 star night!

       Escape From New York   No, this isn’t about  urlLink that  movie. Although if this weekend was made into a movie I would want someone other than Kurt Russel playing me. This weekend was all about being quick. We left DC on a train under the cover of 5am darkness arriving in NYC before 10 am.  Once we arrived at our destination in Brooklyn we began cleaning house and garden. The F was throwing a bridal shower for  urlLink this gal  at a friend’s boyfriend’s house.  So we swept floors, hung Christmas lights, de-weeded a garden, cleaned walks, and mowed grass over the course of 42 hours.  Once the bridal shower began I split for Manhattan, meeting my sister and her beau at  urlLink Other Music . Around 6pm the shower ended, and the F and I raced for – and barely made – the 7pm train out of town…roll credits and cut!

       Alt.No Luck   Whatever time I didn't spent out of the office on a production shoot I spent huddled over a laptop. My goal was to understand, and ultimately fix, a software glitch. Our company bought this very expensive, very powerful laptop with a bunch of external junk that allows us to import video feeds and encode them for watching on the web. The problem is that when you run two different kind of encoding programs - a necessity for these events - the machine crashes to the infamous blue screen.  Amazing I finally got the machine working by the end of the day. However when I called my manager up to explain what steps were required for a successful encoding the whole thing crapped out again.  So four days later, the machine is no better than when I started, yet it is still being flown to San Diego with kid gloves and desperate prayer that it will work once again.  Pray for  urlLink Josh , certainly, but also pray for my manager and this damned laptop.

       Early Mornings   Any resting up I accomplished this past Memorial Day has been destroyed thanks to this week's work schedule. On Tuesday I got up at 5am, Wednesday I got up at 6am, and today I got up at 5:40am.  The reward for getting up early is that I've spent a lot of time behind the camera which means I'm making good on my desire to be a (video production) shooter at work.  So even though there is one day left in the working week, today was my Friday because I survived three days of early production calls.    Three cheers for caffeine!!!

       Like Day & Night   As predicted the weekend was a bustle of wedding activity - both of the successful kind and, sadly, utter crap.  Saturday day and Saturday evening were black and white in terms of accomplishing tasks.  Saturday day was the good part. We: Bought wedding or shower gifts for our friend's weddings. Picked up my wedding ring. Dawn shopped for summer clothes; I took a nap in the sun at an outdoor mall. Returned unwanted merchandise for refunds F found bathing suits she liked... but...  Saturday evening was a whole other story (the bad kind) We were prevented from purchasing bathing suits with Macy's credit card because the idiot behind the counter gave up and collapsed on the floor the moment his cash register confused him. The jeweler were I purchased F's wedding ring delivered to us the wrong ring.   To their credit they handled the event professionally with little fuss over correcting the order. Sunday was mostly a bust but there's not point in me complaining even further. I'm sure everyone is tired of me whining.  It was refreshing to have Monday off from work. There I said something nice! Are you people happy??!

      So four days into occupying our new home I've made my first attempt to wreck it. In sterotypical fashion I grabbed the wrong kind of dishwashing soap and poured it into the diswasher. This, of course, caused suds to flow and flow and flow out of the dishwasher. We had to run in twice then I wiped down the whole appliance before it stopped bubbling over.  So what we've learned from this is : I'm not smart and I'm a stereotype - the dumb husband who can't be trusted around the dishwasher.
