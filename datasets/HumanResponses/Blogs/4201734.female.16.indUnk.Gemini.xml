Why so many lar?! Can that small belly fit 24 lil babies?? it's just amazing man...  I'm heading off to Langkawi tomorrow night... wish me luck!

Ohh i really want a   Tamagotchi   now!! Pretty please??   Told my dad about it... said that it costs $89.90, persuaded my dad into buying it, thought my dad would be shocked and refuse to buy it for me, but my dad replied... " Okay, $89.90 only wat..."

Was so sad when my Digimon spoiled...now i can get a Tamagotchi!!  Umm... yup i edited this entry to fit this in... Went out for dinner just now, to an Italian restaurant, somewhere in Bukit Raja. Da food's kinda nice, ordered Spaghetti All Pollo...with cream sauce and a hint of cheese. Had ice blended cafe lat√©. hehe... and da atmosphere was kinda relaxing. And guess what's next door? Pub! Wow... never really seen the inside of a pub before...kewl...  loud music  ...   ppl chillin' to the beat  . Okayz... reached home, got down from the car, saw something on the road looked like a rope... it was dark, took a look closer...  OMG !! a   snake   man!! Gawd! and i was so close to it! Lucky me... it was a small snake though, a baby...hehehe a mere 1 feet long. It was curled to shape like a   pretzel  ! i like pretzels! Hahaha my discovery made a commotion among d' family members.

      Umm... wanted to blog bout this yesterday but was too lazy to. Yesterday was Thursday... had this play for Patriotism month. And I'm supposed to be da   British guy  . Boy... was i   dashing  ... kekeke my friends said so. All hail da British guy! So i reached school at 6.40 coz they asked us to come earlier. And guess what... i was da second to arrive. Was i that early? I was already in my costume for goodness sake... wearing a tie and all. Coz we're supposed to wear it from home. Ppl were giving me a strange look... i'm like... a girl in a guy's attire stepping into an all girl's school. Quickly hurried into my class. Hahaha... had fun while it lasted. Then the other students came, but they weren't in their costumes though. So i was da   weird   one. Other girls in school were looking at me too. Hey... am i   too dashing   ar?? Then finally they decided to change into their costumes. So they were in their traditional attires and all, cheongsam... sari... baju kebaya... and punjabi clothes. We were disorganized coz we didn't practice much earlier. Then, it was time for us to get out and act out our play in front of the assembly. Boy... was i nervous, looking at all da spectators. And their eyes were on us. I hoped i wasn't going to humiliate myself in front of all these people. So da play went on... then came da national anthem. I gotta say d' whole thing turned out pretty well though. The gratitude goes to one of my fellow classmate whose role was Tunku Abdul Rahman, for her outstanding performance. After that, we took some pictures together. And i will be forever remembered as d' dashing British guy... haha juz joking! Alas... d' play was over!  Went back home... ate d' so called   wasabi     seaweed  . Gawd! my eyes start to water and my nostrils flared.   Wasabi's a real killer  ! Oh... too hot! drank coke to cool down a lil'.... what a combination, coke n wasabi. Later that evening, had tuition at 6.30. Left home at 5.50 with my bro. Went to pick up his gf from tuition at somewhere near The Centrepoint. Then we went to Ocean to collect my mom's specs, which she had sent there to repair. It took so long. We're supposed to pick up my lil' bro from school at 6! We were stucked in a heavy traffic jam... jeez traffic jams drives me crazy! Felt like   banging my head   against da window. I wondered if i could reach tuition in time. But we were moving so slow. To think that we'll have to pick up my lil bro first before heading to my tuition. I called mom to fetch lil bro herself coz we're in a traffic jam and couldn't make it in time. Mom was furious coz... apparently bro wasn't using his   god gifted brains  ! He shouldn't have collected mom's specs first, he can collect it later. I was late myself... 6.45 and i was still stucked in that   damn traffic  . So i called mom again... told her i don't want to go for tuition coz i'm already late. So... finally reached home. Sometimes i wonder where my bro puts his brains...  in da butt  ? He just couldn't do one single thing right. Why?! why?! why am i being blessed with that kinda brother. Well, at least i don't inherit his stupidity.... hahaha!!!
