       me and demi just got back from a week stay at the cottage. it was nice. we had alot of fun. we tanned, tubed, skiied, died, met a family. (shall tell in a sec), ate (yea, i gained a few pounds),  taught little kids how to tell people to die, canoed, got killed by a kayak, caught a frog (fat frog) and named it jeremy, also got a tadpole and called it Roxanne Bella Goldikopouls. :)      jeremy, we named the frog after YOU .    i missed darcy terribly whilst gone. i miss jordyn SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO much, and i wont see her for so long now.    im in london, dying and seeing demis new house, its really hot. and big. i love it.       FAMILY DRAMA: at the dock was where we first witnessed thee life of: the family.  the family consists of ; Mum(45), dad(46), Mich(13) , Ryan(14), Gabby(7), and little depressed jennifer at the tender age of 7. the were staying with their friends, who have a cottage next to ours; mum (43), dad(44), cassy (14), alana, the FAT ugly younger neglected child (12). they were quite the interesting family memebers, gabby; our favourite.       GABBY'S LIFE: she was adopted at the age of  5, along with her natural sister, jennifer. GABBY IS SO COOL. we said 'hi die' so many times, in hoping she'd go home and spread the word. she left us one day, sadly, without us knowing, it was a very sad time. she knows how to live, following us around and such. she is my lover, my friend, and my highly ammature enemy.       with great love from me to gabby; this sim is OUT      ps. TILIMA.!!

        umm...so jonas as informed me that tubing just isnt cool if you aren't three years old. well i thought it was fun actually.       so, the only reason i got one of these things is so that me and demi can see what we have been doing throughout the days. in case, for some reason, we don't talk.       today all i did was practice guitar and such. i also went a record store downtown, it wasn't good. at all. there was over 3000 records there, but they all sucked, the only good one i saw was pink floyd. and im not even a big fan.       and of course there wasn't any beatles or john lennon. oooh of course not. but im going back to music orbit. because, really, thats an amazing store. im trying to go there everyday now, at least everyday im in guelph.       this sim has to go to work.. im a pickpocket. (i hope to be promoted soon) .
