      Well I made some calls, and I  think  that i got my eagle stuff worked out. today I was bored, so i started cleaning my room, and on my way to target to get file folders i went to david g's house and we went to bova's, then mr. jensens (to get a whole in my belt) then we went to play horseshoes. First we went to sidecut (wouldn't let us) then the fort (couldn't get the poles in the ground) then we played at davids. Ian's good friend Katheen came over and we watched we were soldiers after grilling hot dogs. It was better than the normal group.

      Finnaly got home from Philmont. I had the time of my life. Backpacking is awesome. Ian B and I are going to start a venture crew ( a co-ed division of Boy Scouts devoted to high adventure) and I made a call to the district guy that needs to approve my project, and he said he can't approve it because I finished it already. I'm going to talk to someone else downtown about it, because someone told me to go ahead and do it already. (so i did it a year ago.) Preventing me from getting my eagle because of a technicality like that is just pathetic and defeats the whole purpose of the Eagle scout award. Anyway, the train ride to Philmont I wrote down (kinda sketchy) everything in my life and how i can improve on it, so i can live better, and for God. As soon as I get all this eagle scout stuff gets figured out I can relax and concentrate on everything else in life. I just pray that everything will work out. Myabe I'll go downtown tommorow.

      Today was pretty different. I got up at 11, went to the bank, went to get a haircut, went to Heather's garage sale, than got some flip-flops, packed, and ate with my family. After that i went over to Aarons, then me and Lindsey L got a movie (neverwatched it). Then the funny part- Dan was like "i want pancakes" so i made some. Then I went to pick up Allie H. and we went back to Aarons to chill. She gave me an envelope, and it had 16 envelopes, with each day of my trip marked on them, that is the sweetest thing anyone has ever done for me. I really am unworthy of such a friend and she didnt have to do that.so now I'm going for 16 days, backpacking in Philmont, near cimmiron New Mexico. It's gonna be a blast and i'm bringing my video camera.

      Well Today Was crazy. I woke up at noon, then I went over to Heather p.'s and we went to good will and talked a lot. She's a good friend and a caring one, she's tryin so hard just to get by. And then I went backpacking at oak openings, and i am glad to know my pack is working great.  Then at 6:00 i went with Heather and her friends Danniele, Maria, and Mike to their youth service at Bethal. At first i was uncomfortable, but then it hit me. The solution to my unhappieness was to live for God. I needed to reach out and help people to find Him, and like Allie told me the night before, you have the friends, just make them christian.(but she said it in her own way) Then i was reading one of these blog things, and the guy made a good point and told me to find something to do, so i started my own. So that's about it, I'm gonna look for some things for chaplaining at Philmont.

      Worked, then picked up david, and went to lindseys (sarah was there) Lindsey gave me some "Godly" things she found at the dollar store, because she never got me a present on my birthday (apr26) and then we went to mr. freeze and back to her house. Yep. &nbsp; I've been thinking a lot about what i want to do with my life. I really don't know. Lindsey and&nbsp; Allie tell me to be a pastor, ive been told phychologist,&nbsp;Some guy named frank told me to enlist to find out what to do, Lenny tells me just find a college and don't worry about your major, and I myself don't even know. I hope it comes to me fast. &nbsp; I also want to start a band. I've tried like 5 times. I need a drummer, and a few others. A band, perhaps

Then took mike back to Aarons and hung out with Lindsey. Talked about a lot. Then when she left, I talked to Mrs. Hovland for a while, and i know it's weird to talk to a friends mom, but she's cool.

Then we went to mcdonalds then I took David home, picked Heather up and we all went swimming in Aarons Pool. Then we went to Taco Bell. I like Tacos more then Heather, and she don't know anything if she goes around sayin somethin else. Thne we screwed around at Aarons. Nothing too emotional, except i feel bad for Lindsey. So... Goodnight.

      Worked, wasn't to bad today. Then I picked up Ian and we went to my house and my mom saw me driving fast and yelled at me to slow down, so i drove around the circle fast one more time. Thne we went to Aarons and hung out with everyone. We had our pants down, but other than that it was pretty boring. Then when i dropped ian off at home, we went inside and made tacos with steak.Tacos...  Tomorow I get some free time, for the first time in  a long time. Maybe I can do something about my life. Probably not.

      Yesterday I worked  AND ALLIE CAME AND SAW ME then went to Aarons ans swam with the gang. Then i tried to solve lindseys problems on the phone, and talked to Christy on the phone returning her call. Our relationship is pretty much random phone calls.  Worked. Then Lindsey and Sara came into work and we picked up Ian and went to my house. Played pool then Lindsey took Sara home and came back. Then we chatted. LL and I are gonna hook them up. Then Ian had to go so i took him home, went inside and looked at his room. We're gonna start a venture crew real soon.  Lindsey and I have finally got all this crap worked out, and she's the best friend I'll ever have. Even though her boyfriend hates me because i tried to steal her, she still hangs out with me all the time, and if i ever needed someone to talk to, she'd be there. If only she knew how great she is.  Life. It's just getting to the point where i don't know what i want with it anymore. I don't know why i'm so miserable, the things i want and can't have will never be there so i have to deal with it. Friendships keep getting worse, but on the other hand I;m making new friends like Ian and heather, and Lindsey and I are 'better' after all the crap going on at the end of the school year. Everythings getting disorganized, but i can clean it. I just don't know whats so wrong with me

      Been working a lot, lets see, sat went to dan's, then we all went to fire works, then aaron, lisa, heather, maria, Aaron, Ian, and I went to my house and chatted, then home. Sunday i think i did nothing, then at 9:30, i went to Ians, we drove arond then watched philmont video at his house.Yesterday Lindsey and Sara came into work and i left with them, we hung out at sara's and then Lindsey and i got kicked out so we hung out at her house on her couch. Tonight was jeds, then aarons, Lindsey and I played the ankle-slapin game, and when she left we walked around the neiborhood. Mike's been gettin high too much lately so we talked about him, and havin a talk with him. But i talked to him and he said that it was joe and dan pushing to get them drugs, and mike said hes just tryin to be a friend and be nice, but i told him to be strong and say no, and that he's not himself when he's like that, and he agreed, he knows hes better than that. So he told me he's gonna say no to those kinda things, and called me a true friend. Then I talked to heather about her problems, and gave her psalm 23, and she said it never really made sense untill now, and she thanked me.

I found my headrests from my car in Aarons closet, he didnt even know I came to get them, we just walked in and found them hidden and left. Well seinor (spelling) year's comin on fast. Everythings gonna start getting hectic. I pray that everything will work out smooth and stress free, and i know i can make it happen. But there are some things in life that you need to jump at, and thank God for it, because anytime it could just slip away.

      Went to band stuff, then more band stuff till 9pm. Then played pool with Lindsey. And i realize i need to figure out 'hows it goin' because when people ask me that i just say, "i Don't know" and i really dont know why. Life to me is a puzzle and im just findin piece by peace. Just tryin to keep on takin the best out of everything i do, because if i can't get what i like, i have to like what i get.
