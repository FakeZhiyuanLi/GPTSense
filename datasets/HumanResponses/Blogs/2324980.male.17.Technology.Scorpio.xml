      Dear Friends  I'm tired of my opinions being tolerated. I'm tired of being told that I'm different but tolerable. And I'm shooting the next person who tells me I have "an interesting way of viewing things.” I would rather have somebody say 'you're wrong and this is why' than 'I'm not sure if I agree but I guess your opinion makes sense from your point of view.” It's like it completely contradicts society to be 'right' or ‘wrong’… and all we have left is the grays and maybes.  A society as a whole has retreated into a shell of protection known as euphemism, and that shell protects us from learning anything. Want to live on the edge? Does your life lack excitement? That feeling will stay no matter what you do, until you have the courage to tell the world, 'no, you're wrong.’ And then prove it. So when I finish this article, tell me I'm wrong. Or tell me I'm right and you agree and you feel the same rage at political correctness that permeates our world, but don't tell me my opinion is a good one and has its merits.  Here's an encouragement to any who feel that they've lived life in a box too long. Start seeing absolutes. People these days have learned only to memorize, and not to think. Think for yourself, and you'll go somewhere. That's what makes somebody an individual.  That's all. Hope it wasn't too angsty.  Dan

      Dear Friends  I can't tell you how many times I've complained about holidays only to be told that I should be thankful for what I have, and this phenomenon never more acute than around Thanksgiving. I'd like to debunk that thrice-accursed philosophy, but I'm afraid die-hard optimists permeate the world, so I'll simply have my say and hope people will listen.  Possession is relative, just like everything else. A person's status quo- that is, the way they are- is the baseline for possession, and as such there is no 'galactic standard' for whether somebody is poor. The beggar in the street is as used to his condition as I am to mine. The exception is the addition of permanent discomforts of the physical senses in the extreme. For instance, repeated instances of nearly freezing to death, constant agonizing hunger, or parching thirst. These things, since one cannot become 'accustomed' to them, denote a person as poor.  Now I can't see how 'remembering all the things I have to be thankful' is going to make me a better person. Given it's a good idea to keep in mind how blessed one is- and this is coming from a teenager particularly blessed- but at the same time I refuse to be dragged down by guilt over the advantages I've been gifted with in life. When people tell me, 'how dare you be depressed with everything you've got,’ my answer is 'because teenagers all over the world struggle with it and I value my sense of community'. Which is a load of bull, of course, but it counters a thoroughly sentimental and hence useless idea with another of the same sort.  Just so that I can pretend that this blog will be productive in some way, let me encourage you never to settle for less.  Never take less than what you can have for the sake of guilt.  As long as you keep in mind that giving is more beneficial to you than taking, that approach will take you far in life.  My civic duty being done, I’ll leave now :)  Dan

      Dear Friends  We all need something to believe in. I understand and empathize with that, but at the same time cannot bring myself to condone the casual acceptance of loose theory that surrounds the concept of love. It's like a song by Joe Eisenbrahm: "Is love until I die just love until I change my mind?" Love forever and always has not just lost its meaning. It never had it in the first place.  I'm a Christian, so I'm going to quote the bible. If you don't believe this stuff then skip this paragraph but Christian or not I'm guessing you'll agree. The bible says: "there is no greater love than this; that a man give his life for his friends." I want to avoid tangents but still I should point out that the quote does not necessitate death, only sacrifice of one's life- which could be time, energy, or money. The point is, love is characterized not by words, but by action. Your significant other can tell you "I love you" a million times, but if you notice that they're starting to gaze at other men/women and they haven't done anything special for you in a while, doubt is inevitable.  So if love- and you must understand that I speak of love in the generic sense, not necessarily romantic love- is characterized by action, what is the most accurate measure? To ask the question: what would you DO for them? From there, the logic is elementary.  I would die for any of my friends in a heartbeat. I'd like to think, though obviously I've never been put to the test, that I would die for a common man on the street that I'd never met. Sacrifice is a key aspect in how I express my love. So here's the clincher: what more is there to give? I would give up anything for my friends, and there's simply nothing more to sacrifice for a girl. I can give more of my time, or more of my energy, but the bottom line is that the difference is quantitative, not qualitative.  I believe strongly in the love of friendship. I also believe that the 'romantic love' that everybody is so enraptured by is simply an array of different components that people have massed together over the years: friendship, attraction, and a mutually exclusive commitment. I include friendship because it incorporates the necessities of a relationship, like respect, trust, sincerity, etc. Attraction is necessary because otherwise.. well, you see what I mean. The commitment is what really sets it apart. A mutually exclusive commitment says, "You are first and foremost mine, as I am first and foremost yours." And here's the kicker: since dating and courting don't inherently indicate any sort of permanence, the ONLY place 'romantic love' can in ANY way occur is INSIDE THE CONTEXT OF MARRIAGE. That's somewhat irrelevant but all the same I thought it worth mentioning.  Some of you sentimentalists (I don't mean that as a derogatory statement since I'm one too) are bound to think, love can't be 'defined,' love is a feeling that____ you fill in the blank. I disagree strongly. The whole 'indescribable' cliché is really an excuse to avoid looking into difficult emotions. Humans aren't all that complicated, and I can see no reason why love should be this hovering complexity that some view it as.  I'll be interested in what people have to say about this one.

      Dear Friends  I'm not new at this.  I came from JoeUser.com, a quickly growing community of bloggers.  As long as I'm setting out to maintain a reputation of honestly, I may as well tell you that I got kicked out.  The admins got horribly ticked off- and Brad, the owner, isn't generally a guy that loses his cool- and I am now exiled.  It goes without saying that I consider his decision unwarranted, but I'm also a teenager, and we all know how  that  goes:)  For a while, I'll probably post the best of the best from my old blog.  Hopefully, by the end I'll have made enough local friends to begin posting articles that fit into the kind of demography that people read here.  Enough of an intro for now.  Blog in peace.  Dan
