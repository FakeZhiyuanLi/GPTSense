          Right now I honesty don't know what to think.  If you've read any of my other posts you'd know that I really like this one girl who doesn't feel the same about me.  Right now she is pretty pissy, and I really don't know what to think anymore, sometimes I'm sure that she likes, me and other times I'm absolutely possitive that she hates my guts, but anyway I have an idea that will either work wonderfully, or fail miserably.     I'm going to tell her... to her face... exactly how I feel about her and see how things go from there.  It's going to be interesting in either case, so I feel really antsy about this.  I think this is the only way to get it over with at least.  I want her to get outta my head, cause right now she's all I can think about, every single moment of every day she just floats into my head and every day I have to see her, but she won't talk to me, and if you knew her, you'd know that you can't be the one to initiate a conversation.  God, I will never understand girls... ever.

          I read this on a t-shirt at hot topic.  I have always enjoyed going there.  I usually don't buy anything cause I'm poor, but I like to look around.  I think they're evil now.  They feed off of the minority masses to get all their stuff out when there are like 5 other stores like that in my area code, but whatever I haven't shopped there in a while, and I probably won't.     Right now I'm listening to Queens of the Stone Age, I got a t-shirt on the internet for them, it looks pretty cool, but I really like the band.  The first time I got their CD I was like they're ok, then all my cds got stolen and I bought a new one and put it in and hit random.  I was like blown away, I heard the coolest stuff ever, it was so melodic, yet somehow dark.  It felt really cool, like opening up the freezer and seeing a brand new carton of your favorite Ice Cream.  I bought all the albums I could get my hands on and one record, yes I still listen to records, they just seem to have more soul to them than cd's like you gotta sit down and listen to em like their incredibly important.     But anyway I love rock, classic rock, Pink Floyd, King Crimson, Led Zeppelin, and punk like the Dead Kennedy's and NoFX, and Metal like Down the Sun, and Tool, and Korn, but I don't like black metal, where everyone's screaming and you have like a creepy organ in the background.  It scares me.     *shudder* But yeah right now I'm learning this one song by Porcupine Tree it's really cool and has this really cool guitar part in it that sounds really prolific and just AWESOME.     I have to get back to reading in a little bit, I'm still not done with a Handmaid's Tale.  I don't think it's as good as 1984, but it's a nice update. It's a lot more modern I give it that but it gets really boring sometimes.  But it's very realistic.  Everyone I know has a best friend extremist lesbian who despises authority.  Not badmouthing lesbians or friends of lesbians, or anything, but the book just drags on and on and on... and it gets really tedious sometimes.  I guess that happens to me with all books, but I guess I just don't like assigned reading, in fact I hate it with a fiery passion that consumes my very being.

      I have a creepy obsession with anime, I just can't help myself. It just like makes me feel so excited whenever one of my favorite shows comes on like Inuyasha or Van Dread, I just like freak out and get all "giddy", yes I just said "giddy," like a school girl. Laugh all you want but it's really interesting I like the intense story, not just for the action, but for the love story part. I guess I'm kind of a hopeless romantic. But whatever. A lot of people think I'm a loser or a geek, but there's only one opinion I care about. *Distant Stare* I'm not going to get into that right now but you all know who I'm talking about. GOD I can't get her out of my head just all day 24/7 all day every day she just keeps flashing into my mind. Sometimes I can't stand her, and other times she's like the most important person in my life and I can't get her out of my head right now is the latter. I don't really know what spurred this on, but I really hope nobody I know reads this especially one of my friends, cause I will never hear the end of it... ever. They always tease me about liking her, but they would do it even more if they read this, but I'm not writing it for them. I'm writing it for me. This is kinda like my own journal that's open to critique... by everyone.

          Her name's Hanna, or Hana .  I really probably don't have a chance with her, but I'm going to persue it anyway and see where it leads me.  She's really cool, She listens to "trance", I don't really like it but she has such a passion with her music it reminds me a lot of mine.  She's really out there, she's hillarious and really smart, a lot of the time she makes fun of me, but I don't mind, hell, she's talking to me at least, and I think she's just teasing anyway.  I like to talk to her more than anything in the world, She just makes me feel so great whenever she's around.  I always get really nervous when she's around and I really like freak out sometimes.  She's really cool at least to me.  She's kind of athletic, but doesn't really seem to be really tired like the rest of us.  She's just so fresh and blossoming every day like a spring, on a good day.  She's either really nice or really, really mean.  Depending on what mood she's in.  I "had to" sit next to her in English, which is why I am trying really hard to get into AP so I can be in the same class with her again.  I always try to pass it off like "Oh great now I have to sit next to you", but I think she knows how I really feel.  I asked her to prom last year, and I fucking HATE DANCING, but she wanted to go, she said no but it was under wierd circumstances, and I'm going to give it a shot once school starts.  If anyone has any advice please go right ahead I need it.

          I don't really know what to write, school starts in a couple of days and I just found out last week that I'm going to be in AP English instead of regular and that I have to complete a reading list before school starts.  The Handmaid's Tale, decent, kind of like 1984, but much more feministic, sometimes it creeps me out.  Snow Falling on Cedars, Haven't started yet, sounds boring.  And the Scarlet Letter, lot of hype around this book, but I still don't want to read it.  I don't like to read unless it's on my own terms and this most definitely is not.  I have a hard time reading inside, to get any real reading done I go outside to a high place, in this case on top of my old tree house, sitting in a lawn chair and just go at it and knock down like 50-80 pages.  I would enjoy the book if I read it on my own time, but I only have like 4 more days till school starts and I'm really sweating getting this done.  I wouldn't normally, but the entire reason I'm doing this is for a girl who probably will never go out with me, but what the hell I gotta try.  I'm writing this at like 2 in the morning and I am wide awake.
