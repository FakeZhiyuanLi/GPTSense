      After a house full of uncertainty I opened the gates of my mind Incidents and events have led me to Become unhappy and sad A statement one day changed it all Slow and steady came patience and will and  Dawned upon me your glorious halo Then one night you came in a dream  To declare your message like a Muhammad An emissary in the age of plastic machines Like a soloist in a crowded city I hung on to you , my earthly prophet To take me through and lead me beyond The lights that lit and beautified Your city of the legends and the burning ghats One day for a chance reunion   You looked at me with an intelligent smile You questioned me where after all is the pain where is it hidden , in which eternal cave You spoke like Nietzsche , you sang like Gibran I listen with awe , your Gita my lord I felt it striking my blood and bones I felt like moving in a procession of worlds That had all so simply mingled into you and beyond There is no darkness anywhere my Lord No misery , no pain nor grief No possesions , no wants and desire Freed from the human birth chain   Petrified or mesmerized A bit of both perhaps I  And You  Sat like a miracle on your divine chariot Hanging from the sea , while i slept and floated On a narrow canoe Like some lost light from a star Suspended and amazed in the vasteness And profoundity of your ever expanding home Of which even i am a part  Now

      Nikhil called up yesterday night . He was drunk like a maniac , not even in a position to hear things properly forget speaking . This is something which i have come to associate with Nikhil these days , getting drunk without an admonition to others about the extent to which he can possibly get drunk . He does it deliberately , i guess. Why ? well i don't have the faintest idea. Nikhil is the most unique character i have met in ages , when i mean unique i imply that. After having known him so closely for such a long time i am pretty sure he is the stuff that legends are made of . I don't intend to say that he reminds me of Rhet Buttler or Tom Tulliver but he has that element of agelessness in him . He is almost like a broad definition that represents a certain type of men , the species of which i am pretty afraid to admit is now almost extinct. Nikhil to me is the traditional old fashioned protagonist in Victorian novels of Thackeray and Dickens , those of the Bronte sisters or maybe Jane Austen , strong powerful and emotional. These are the three words that defines him . Once in a while he almost reminds me of the haughty Bingley or the handsome arrogant yet cultured Darcy. He is like that , almost like that. He can drink gallons of whisky and then bump a police car in south Delhi and yet convince the cops that he is mentally fractured and victimized by the perils of love and get away without shelling a buck . He can be as mesmerizing as his electric guitar rising and falling like the crests and troughs of the 'Temple of the king' or be loud and indecent and yet not sound cacophonic while attempting say 'Yesterday'. In short his range is commandable. The range and precision which he exhibits in music is almost in sync with his range of emotions in life. We have gone through a lot of troubled times together and both of us have evolved considerably. I have seen him getting disturbed , irritated but i have never seen him losing control. There has been moments when i wanted him to , but he still remained stoic. His only formal way of protest was to drink and sleep like a sick dog. He is not the types who does a lot of talking , or expresses a lot but i am sure he does wonder idly at times and these are the moments when i feel helpless and probably he feels unconsolable.  I have never considered Nikhil to be a friend , he has always been there for me . I never expect him to tell me a lot many things or get ecstatic . Those things would be very un-Nikhil like. Nikhil means patience , composure and class. 3 things which cannot be cultivated or nurtured . You are either born with them or you are devoid of them . Most of the people with typical and classic 'middle class mentalities'(which has almost become a fashion statement and this by the way is the class i detest) don't have them no wonder how much they try to imbibe it . I remember while at college i knew a guy called Mayank. i really don't think that many people close to me actually held him up in very high esteem , and it would be a different debate altogether to determine his precision as a human being but there was something in him that differed him from any other Tom , Dick or Harry in college . Class. He had it in plenty . Something which was magnetic and eloquent. I wondered about his parentage and upbringing and i found out later(when i visited his aunt's place) that i couldn't have been more correct.  One of my aunt always keeps on telling me that family is important. It determines directly or indirectly , if not anything else then genetically the way you will shape up as a human being.  Nikhil's family has been very supportive throughout his personal mishap. His decision to leave the city and go to work in the U.S was a difficult one . No one knows it better than me , I have known him too closely , yet when he asked me whether he should take the plunge , i gave him the nod . Not because even i have similar plans but because i can feel for him . I can never see him marooned in this state . As i have always said that changing cities in this modern world is like being ressurected all over again . It's tough , essentially tough , but at times you have to do it . I left this city once , i will have to do it again and i know Nikhil has to leave this country .  Life without him is going to be tough , but then when has life been easy since the last 1 year . There has just been so many hurdles and i have been constantly battling . Failed relationships , dissatisfied jobs , Absence of my only friend in office , Shalini's wedding and US voyage , Bhusho's absence and worse still 'No Nikhil'. The last one is the biggest one because it was the only one that came on like a frost bite . I could see it happening but i just didn't want to believe that it would actually.  You have left me all alone Nikhil, there is nothing left for me in this city anymore. Maybe it's high time that even i decide things for the future , and i am convinced that my future lies elsewhere in a different city , all over in  a different country. I will miss you Nikhil.

      Sleep in it and roll baby Sleep in it and roll Shake in the night on the Howrah bridge  Without a dream or a goal  Did someone tell you that you are a 'gonner' A sweaty summer night Hooked on to the ceiling like a ceiling fan Not like a flat tubelight  Who the hell will steal your song  The one that you wrote just today There are plenty of John Lennon's In this world anyway  Are you ashamed that you don't know nothing About what will happen to you again  Let me tell you my sugar baby You are walking in a dead lane   So sleep in it and roll baby Sleep in it and roll The world will be a better place tomorrow Even with it's death toll

      The way i console myself  The unexplored 'me' What i am to myself  Is for the love of it Not this body , neither this birth Something else it is actually Some other distraction that defines Me  I love myself thinking  About me and only me  I can sense the touch , which i am sure Belongs only to me I pity those who can never see The vacuuity of my thoughts How clear and how much pure Is this Godly mind factory  I am clear , I am glassy I am the time that never moves I am my hope , I am my sustenance I am only there for me   This body will one day become a 'Manikarnika' light This eyes for vultures and crows These lips for my beloved will now only touch  waters from your celestial shore  I dress all the twilight and greet the dusk I become the radiance of the night I unchange my vision and pierce this dream I hasten the earth to move into light  Megalomaniac omnipotent me With me and in me  God like me  God called me  Just me  Only me  Me

      Still A young sweet girl , with baloons and smiles Greets me every now and then  Dissolving into my eyes like a chocolate picture When i asked her once , why she sat so close So near to my heart , so close to my soul Yet stayed so far , shied away from me  She finally must have felt  She was too young and too sweet to think of an answer What if i never speak to her again What if my house , my city and my place of birth changes tomorrow In any of these births Will i still be awake and conscious to remember her precisely I don't think so , i guess Changing cities in this modern world is like changing lives I tend to think so at times    At late nights when i wake up To switch off a gently speaking T.V. I often stare at the line of old houses in front  They scare me  They confirm that i am absolute That i will be lost someday ,mingle into a smoke network  That belongs to nowhere , and specifically to everywhere I wonder about my origin , a piece of human identity Questions like ('who are my parents , who fathered me , who afterall  was my mother' From which corner did i originate , where will i mortally extinguish  ) blink and then sleep permanently Where were these questions for so long ?   I am nothing but a dream  Just a casual theme  Made from the elements of desire I have nowhere to go No one will ever understand why i say so Till it all becomes earth rain and fire  anekabaahudaravaktranetram pashyami tvam sarvato-anantroopsm   naantam na madhyam na punastvaadim pashaami vishveshvara vishvaroopa    (O Lord of universe, I see You endowed with numerous arms,  bellies, mouths and eyes and having innumerable forms  extended on all sides. I see neither Your beginning nor middle,   nor even Your end, manifested as You are in the form of the universe.  )    NOTE:- If anyone amongst you have personally liked any of my  poems then you can visit www.freudianworld.com to download my  published ebook .

      I searched in between the gossamer sheets impregnated with the fortnightly flood  it was only a trifle concupiscent boo-boo and she railed me just for feeling 'the hots' I beat the bushes in my head and within i thwacked her senses with sleeping pills  boy did i find the covert reasoning  i stood half soaked amidst the glassy-eyed redness she was loaded and leaking , yes she was a maniac punch-drunk somewhere in between my diamond ring was floating

      I don’t really know how to begin , I mean at one point of time I just thought that maybe I would never write again , forget compiling an ebook or anything even remotely similar to it. But things just happen and even before I could realize I had actually started writing again . I have always maintained that poetry is a hugely complicated medium and definitely I thought , I would do a lot better if I could stick to something like maybe short stories or personal essays for that matter but it never happened that way . Since I have been regularly associated with a website called poeticwings where you have other people freely commenting on your works someone once mentioned that I have a lot of disconnected random thoughts which needs to be organized , sorted out and strictly arranged . Maybe that was a correct observation but after almost a quarter of a century of existence I have realized that it’s too late for me to make a switch to the structured didactic style of poetic compositions . I know there are a lot of people who are so very good at handling the structural essence of poems and I sincerely congratulate them for their effort . I honestly feel that they should continue that good job , but it’s almost impossible for me to make a switch and start writing like them . I have always written everything that I have felt needs to be written , never bothered whether anyone can connect to it or for that matter whether anyone feels distantly alienated , disturbed , perplexed or absolutely disenchanted after going through them . It simply doesn’t matter to me , I am least bothered . My poetry is personal , it’s not about the polity . These are my ideas , my beliefs , it would be highly unexpected if anyone else endorses them , but it will definitely come as a decent surprise . My admirers ( I am grateful to them for appreciating most of my works so wholeheartedly ) , particularly Suzanne , Aurora , Shalini , Rohit , Avinash , Nikhil , Aishwarya and Bhusho always wanted me to get things together and keep on writing , which I have managed to do inspite of being hugely uninspired and demotivated at times.  For a long long time I never felt like compiling a book , because I was wondering what theme should my book carry . If at all I come forward with a collection of poems there has to be a remote platitude among the majority of the poems , something that should essentially tie them together. I thought this was essential . Later on when I continued writing after a hiatus I realized that I have something to say , one last statement maybe . One general impression which I ubiquitously carry these days . I guess the only emotion that triggers me , raises my eyebrows and yet carries me forward is that of ‘Shock’. This , I realized was that one element which formed the nexus of my compositions . Hence I have renamed this ebook as shock .  I have written all of these poems over the last 2 years , and to be honest at one point of time there was an enticement to maybe include a few of my earlier works , which I had written while doing my engineering , but I seriously realized that those set of ideas and impressions don’t define the present ‘ me ‘ , the one that I see everyday in the mirror. The one that I used to be is no longer me , and what I happen to be now is what I have become …… Hence I thought that ‘Shock’ can’t be primitive , it has to evolve just like it’s creator .  I sincerely don’t expect you to appreciate everything about this book. If there is anything that you might have happened to like about this book , then I would be grateful to you for having invested your precious time. Do feel free to send me your feedback . Majority of the poems out here have previously been published in websites , while a few are freshly published in this edition . I am grateful to Agradoot ,  Shalini and the entire Freudian world team to provide me with an opportunity to publish this book on their website . It’s a great honor to be associated with a brand like freudianworld.com. I wish them luck and I am sure Shalini will have a great marriage , come September. Thank you all .

      Remember all that you used to think about me , it's over now  Another century has elapsed in this thinking exercise  You owe all your leisure to the inequalities of time  Deep within  Life struggles and flaps its wings to be indefinetely free  The girl it remotely tries not to see , shakes in thoughts  And the agitated thoughts constantly struggle  With the so far imbibed value systems of life  One slip and i revolve like a thousand earths  In a whirlpool of conscience  To make ammends for all that has been lost  To buy new time for all old reasons  Staying awake whole night for another exam  And late realization blues  &nbsp;  But there stands someone , watching it all  He keeps on telling 'lad you are headed for a fall'  Too much of venom in your head you see  Accumulating these , do you think you can be free  You won't be spared from the habit of living  You will die , even though you won't stop breathing  No one will be there to bring you back to life  Expect no miracles for two thousand and five  &nbsp;  Yet we will think about cleaning the year that has become so dirty  Wake up every night , drink gallons and have a party  Look ahead for the new year , find actions we can accuse  Then party real hard atleast now we have an excuse  &nbsp;  In a spider web of discotheques and whores  Imprisoned spinelessly by tha shackles of time  Who the fuck has made you swear  To shut your mouth and bear all this  When will you muster the guts  To ask them flat on their very face  'Can't you just skip all these questions'  &nbsp;  And if you have survived this time , this journey  Blame it on Nostradamus  Or else the almighty must been real afraid  Unable to pronounce the judgement day  'Sudha Sadhakam , Annatra Viraam She Jatrena sankite'  Ask everybody to assemble out there  For i feel even i have something to say  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  "Yet we will think about cleaning the year that has become so dirty  Wake up every night , drink gallons and have a party  Look ahead for the new year , find actions we can accuse  Then party real hard atleast now we have an excuse"  And  No one will be there to bring you back to life  Expect no miracles for two thousand and five"

      Don't ask me again Noyonika I don't want to lie If someone tells you that she is unhappy Then will you tell me why &nbsp; Broken heart or cancer cells What has hurt&nbsp;her most While she waits to die on her winter bed Only to&nbsp;return like an autumn ghost &nbsp; Didn't I mention long back  That i am just alive  A bit drowsy&nbsp;and a little bit lazy Doing it from&nbsp;ten to five &nbsp; But you people were happy and busy Even your Sundays&nbsp;meant men and work What has happened that now suddenly You&nbsp;have started envying a government clerk &nbsp; Didn't i tell you Noyonika To take&nbsp;plunge and cross the bar For a change&nbsp;, to emulate Alice And drink the lotion from the majic jar &nbsp; I must confess i had my chances The one female i should have had But when i recovered to truth and pain She had been married , unhappy and sad &nbsp; Will tell you something Noyonika I never allowed her to stick to me  Now that i know , what a fool i have been  To allow her to be free , from me &nbsp; Now that she will leave all this The places and people for whom she longed All we can do to make her feel special Everything to make her feel sunny and belonged &nbsp; Don't you worry at all Noyonika I trust nature too much to be true I believe that the elements are also Haplessly wondering without a clue &nbsp; Always for the wrong females You have but , wasted your life What has been the returns after all Said the old accountant's wife &nbsp; It is you who has let go The moments and all that was opportune  You , who has made all those catastrophic wishes Unrecognizing the omnipresent tune &nbsp; Forget the past , forget the past And every other blast that can possibly last To snatch your freedom and kill your mind  To die in a role that has been type cast &nbsp; Now you tell me Noyonika What is that i should do? How will i fetch my old belongings When all of it has become new &nbsp; I entrust you to help me out To lead me to make a safer choice  Atleast i shouldn't be losing out To soldiers without their usual toys &nbsp; Don't ask me again Noyonika  I don't want to lie Atleast i know who has been my loss For whom I should cry  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

        Saturday was Shalini's engagement , quite an affair. Nikhil was there to witness the magnum opus. As expected the guest list literally read the capital's who's and who's , courtesy Shalini's mom's political nexus . Nikhil's sense of politics is pathetic , the way he had been arresting looks on Dr Manmohan Singh when for the first time his pictures had flashed across the media was stunning. That moment betrayed his political awareness and he can indeed compete with the likes of the heavenly misinformed brother duo Rajat and Rohit . On the contrary Shalini's knowhow is quite spectacular , truly justifying her domicile for the nation's capital. While the to be bride and bride groom exchanged pleasantaries with the profound political gentry , Nikhil was standing across a remote corner with seriousness stamped all over his persona , like an embodiment of a celestial discovery 'ignorance is bliss'. Ofcourse he had been considerate enough to broadcast the entire circus over the telephone , but he had trouble considering the fact that the wish list was tremendous . Almost anyone and everyone who hadn't quite made it to the gala extravaganza wanted to know what exactly was going around. In the end it seems there was a sort of valedictory where Shalini's mom had announced that this was only a curtain raiser , the marriage was going to be the real show. Hats off to Delhites.  Nikhil keeps on telling me that majority of Delhites , barring the traditional old people are almost always like this . They have developed the regularity of jumping into conclusions with regular pinpointedness , no ifs and buts or any other peppy side talk . So if it's a woman , the actionable purpose is obvious , it is singular and universal , but for the Delhites it is without a covering as well . Good for them .  The weekend was useless otherwise. Went to watch a movie with Chatis called 'Hotat Neerar Jonyo'. Neera has been Sunil ganguly's protege in peotries for quite some time , his version of the mysterious undiscovered magnetic female . References can easily be drawn with Bonolota Sen , but since i have read almost a major portion of Ganguly's transalations atleast the better ones in ' Murmur in the Woods' i can safely comment that there is essentially a difference , elementary difference to be precise. I have never really vouched for Ganguly and i have sincerely believed that he has been a hypocrit , but the way the movie has been showcased it has indeed strenghtened my belief that Ganguly's pseudo-bohemian attempt at generating neo classical literature with heavy dosages of adultery sex and taboo do not go hand in hand with his new found loyalty for the Marxist. Strange indeed. The film at maximum can only be labeled as trash , the short story was bad , but the way the script has been compounded to facilitate the libertine adventures of Abinash is really horrendous and one can't help wondering how the writer of 'Prothom Alo' and 'Shei Shomoy' can stoop down to such fierce intellectual gimmicks , in the disguise of progressive art house cinema. One wonders the credibility of Subrata Sen , but then Ganguly indeed should be cursed. Coming back to the performances , well there's not much to say really , Bikram Ghosh hams his way through out , taking time off to expose his adipose bathed pot belly , and getting intimate (really intimate for sure) with Jaya Seal and the other bitch in not so comfortable positions . (No one can really be comfortable with Bikram on top) The dialogue writer has introduced a horde of one liners that has attempted to create a mix of new age spirituality (aka modern day salvation) and Tantric or sporadic reutilization of sexual energy .(One wonders if ever the hint is on Reiki and Chakras, this never the less reminds me of Paul Flinch ) Sample this .  Ghosh : Ami tor sathe ekbar sute chai , taholei amar mukti . Amay Mukti dibi to Rani .  or even better ones this time from Seal.  Seal: jabo tor flat e dekha korte kintu promise kor kono oshobhotami korbi na .  or worse still Seal's husband discovering that his wife had been having a clandestine affair.  'Amar prestige ta kothay jabe , tumi ekbaro bhable na '.(He believes in quickies spending less than a minute to dump his load , and not being sensitive enough to even bother about his wife's satisfaction )  I sincerely wonder , how less do people bother about sex , particularly we Indians . Satisfying your partner is ethereal and of utmost importance , half of the life is sex and i am certain it is very important , the way you express the way you deal the way you receive it matters.  Freud steadily maintains that sexual expressions define our general tendencies. If you bother sincerely about satisfying your partner , about her desires , animal wants , you must be a great spouse completely in possession of the body and the mind . The smaller attributes and emotions which we express during the act magnify 10,000 times and speak solemnly about our generic behavioral patterns and habitual commitments . A person who suffers from OCD for instance will be almost always be violent , the more restrained and underlying your emotions are the more violent and passionate you will be in bed . I knew this fellow back in school who was a very shy person , he was calm composed and exceptionally quite yet his sexual life happens to be fantastic . It's not that he is essentially very communicative or explicit in bed , but he has that element of power in him . He tells me that when he really gets into the act it's almost as if he ends up being possessed. I can understand him properly. He was animalistic in desire for the female with whom in real life his attitude was rather indifferent or casual , but being a passionate fellow he found his incomplete expression through his body . Where the mind failed the body responsed. They complemented each other perfectly . People whose affection for their partners are extremely static and dormant are always violent and obsessive in bed . Some people can't express what they actually feel, it's not that they do it on purpose but it's simply because that they themselves are unaware of their actual feelings , it's only during certain circumstances that they become wild . While at bed , they communicate with their bodies, they find it much more spontaneous and rational. People who believe in a gentle kiss , soft aesthetic touches and plenty of holding and soft kittenish gestures are the people who are more vocal about their feelings for their partners . For them love making is fun , it is not any other means of expression , it lacks the element of violence and power. It is sugary , it can never include something say spanking , or bondage or even mock violence and rape. It will always be gentle and smooth , holding cuddling and sleeping tight. Most of the Indian males fall into these category and not to mention they are the most cherished one's among the fairer sex. These people are also the one's who will never fail communicating with their partners. They can be sexually incomplete , they don't need to because their body doesn't need to complement their minds. Thus spake the great man Sigmund Freud .  And indeed at times for these people , the body has been able to express what the mind had always failed. The caption for the film i just talked about also read ' When the body talks about the mind'. Couldn't agree more with you Subrata Sen , atleast you got your caption right.

        The old man finally said ' I won't smoke anymore ', When the resolution didn't make much sense though The anticlock exercise had begun  The next few days were spent  Trying to believe that life has run out of days Ah! he mused , I won't see the summer sun again  Not another mango season for me  Not anymore , not even once  A lot of people who have been directly or indirectly His produce  Were silently weeping , moaning , saying words of wisdom  Eternal Hindu philosophy , birth , rebirth ,karma  Heavy heavy words  Didn't make much sense to the simple man who  Was not even in a position to make out what afterall Was being said  The whole of the life was done in the 'Beatles' way 'All you need is love' once sang John and Yoko surprisingly at the end of days Everything becomes the Beatles again 'You say goodbye , i say hello'. yet another song .  He should have been grateful  He had lived a good 72 years , inspite of being  A heavy smoker That too unfiltered cigarettes  No one could allow him to pick a filtered one  'I don't like them ' pat used to come his reply  The cancer arrived late , but it arrived in time A very bad time of the year , to be precise Cold cold winter And no mangoes either .  The city doctor said '6 months' For a change trying to adjust his almost instanteneous expression And surrogating it with that of guilt Some kind of guilt , but  there was no need for him to feel sorry he thought later And once everything seemed settled no one felt sorry anymore  We all know it happens once in life And that is always enough  We might be aware , but we never feel it  sense it , almost like a time bomb which seems  hidden somewhere  It has to burst and it will burst  Now, anytime That is the difference of knowing death beforehand And just knowing it like any other honest fact  Honesty bites When the desire to live is maximum  It manifolds a good thousand times overnight The desire to live becomes more deadly than death itself And the helplesness become unconsolable You start preparing for death  The old man was preparing to die One of these days He often cried like a baby Often screamed in rage  Locked himself in his 30 square feet paradise Came out and laughed like a lunatic He was overcome with fear  The way he had lived his life , he had never bothered about death It was never required of him He had a solution for most of th situations he could think of He had never listed this In short he was unprepared , badly unprepared How will he fair in his last exam ? What do you think should he do ? He had asked me this question and now I am  Asking this to you. Send in your answers in  self addressed competition postcards  As soon as possible The best answer , judged by the old man himself Will get a dozen alfonsos(mangoes) in the next mango season

      So finally Nikhil is leaving , and it couldn't have come at a more horrible time . Probably this is the time when all things should have come to an end , perhaps the time has come for an entire age to dissolve , like cubes of old emotions in teacups of time . Had i been a few years younger , i really don't know what i would have done with so much of turbulence happening around me , all the time . I definitely wouldn't have battled it or fought it , i would have relinquished without a thought . All of my close associates are dissapearing without a trace , Chatis is leaving for Belgium , Kushal for the U.S , shuto has already shifted to Bangalore with a new job and my own sweet Gabs have gone to Germany on an onsite assignment . This is the official part of it , besides at a personal level Nikhil is going to leave next week, (good for him) Shalini is getting married come September and she is flying off with her husband for the states soo after that. Bhusho is surviving out here in this tragic city with me , but i believe he is too busy with his M.D. preparations to have time left off for me . You know Nikhil , no one can possibly understand what exactly i am going through these days . To tell you honestly , buddy I am seeing through a lot these days . Professionally i am having a nightmare , with a bullshit project . On a personal front well do i need to be explicit . I don't think so , atleast not in front of you . The best part about you is that you have never asked me any questions , it was your silent presence that used to comfort me and soothe me , I knew you were there to be my very own shock absorber , you have the power to bear everything , but i think this time things are just getting a bit heavier on my part . You always tell me that i can't express atleast i have the advantage that i can deceive a lot of people . It's uncomfortable to think and know that so many people can possibly figure out what you have been going through on your personal front .  I don't much believe in religion Nikhil , i have never been a faithful but these days i know that i am not an agnostic anymore . I am slowly getting transformed by faith , what exactly is happening i might not be able to elucidate to you buddy but i am undergoing a great transformation . I can almost feel it within. Believe me buddy it's happening . I am evolving a lot these days . I just remembered a song by ColdPlay from the album 'A rush of blood through the head' that goes as  Where do u go u never know , DOn't be so sure of what you think you know God gave u style God gave u grace , he put a smile upon ur face' I truly believe in the Almighty these days , probably it's the worst form of escapism but i know that i don't have a choice and besides i have always been an escapist through out my  wretched life . That sets it perfectly , almost in sync with what i am , or rather what i have completely transformed into .  I have matured 10,000 times in the last year or so and everyday , i have a strange gut feeling that i am being tested by the Lord himself . For what reason i don't have any idea , I sincerely remember that i have never hurt anyone (physically/emotionally) on a consensus level . I have never tried to cause pain to others , seriously i have tried not to but i am being victimized over and over again and now i am almost used to it . I sincerely believe that the Great Lord himself is  allowing me to go through these testing times , and he definitely has a plan for me . I have to bear this onslaught ( i know it's getting increasingly tough) but still i have to bear this and much more . There's no shying away from his well defined path , and i am just a meagre human being . I read the Gita everyday , without fail , I do it more frequently these days . The shlokas produce a serene feeling , makes u realize that you are temporary , all grief is temporary ,all pain is no pain at all. Perhaps the greatest pain incurred is of being born as a human being and this cannot be altered. For a change my Great Lord i am not shying away from all the dire consequences , I am facing everything chest open and i know i will overcome all misery , I have full faith in your divine compassion , i know this is one of your great lessons that you want me to know , and i being your humble devotee will experience this great knowledge of yours with all my sublime consciousness. Just give me strength to bear all this Oh Lord , just give me plenty of strength.  I need you more than anyone else particularly when you have decided to even take away Nikhil, my last source of strength.

      Last weekend was pretty routine . I am busy reading the 'Suitable Boy' these days , which is presumably consuming a fat slice of my time . Thoroughly enjoying it though. Seth has always been one of my perennial favorites , ever since i read his 'Mappings'. I remember almost precisely that there was this poem about his father coming to see him off at the railway station and that was quite unlike the other English poetry that i had read in my life so far . I was thrilled to have discovered Seth , and it was then only that i had figured out that Seth had been a huge hit in the U.S . Seth reminds me of this Bengali writer i am also very fond of Shirshendu Mukherjee . Their style of writing is pretty similar lucid , intriguing and captivating . Both of them are essential page turners , i mean their literature has this quality . The Suitable boy happens to be one of the longest novels in English , almost a 1400 page exercise . I haven't even completed a third right now , but i can almost feel it , the compulsively addictive nature of the book . Set in post independence India , in the early 1950's the story centres around Lata and her mother Mrs Rupa Mehra's strong penchant in finding for her a suitable groom . The story takes off from Brahmpur(modelled on Lucknow though Lucknow has been separately mentioned) , a fictituous town , which happens to be the capital of Purva Pradesh ( modelled on Uttar Pradesh)  with the wedding of Lata's elder sister Savita and proceeds from therein to Kanpur , Kolkata , Delhi and eventually Lucknow.  I admire Seth's characterisation and eye for details which is more imaginative than researched and which probably adds on to the almost serene phlegmatic and fairty tale like quality of the narrative . The narrative is so smooth and delicate almost chocolatey , with those protagonists which can remind you so emphatically about the heroes of Middlemarch or War and Peace. Quite an experience . Being an Indian i was glued on to the cricket sets for some time this Sunday , alternating between watching the match and reading the book . Cosy Sunday afternoons don't get better .  Saturday evening was spent watching a 'substantial' Hindi movie(the less said the better, actually the audience comments were more memorable) , followed by dinner with Joy and Jeet. Earlier in the day went to Oxford Bookstore and gallery with Aishwarya who had come down for a couple of days . Sulked some tea , almost completed a book by Osho titled ( Walking in Zen , Sleeping in Zen ) . I am seriously zapped by this person's brilliant sense of humour . Answering to different queries from his followers , the master quoted somewhere that sex indeed can be so animalistic and irrational that one actually might (someone who never does) frequent the church on an everyday basis if he/she so realizes that the church is the best suited place to have an earth shattering orgasm .  On another occassion he took off on Moraji Desai and his urinating habits , elaborating on  how Indira (gandhi) who followed him to the PM's residence at 10 Janpath spent a fortnight on abluition therafter . The point that was made was 'drink alcohol it's fruit juice , do not drink what Moraji believes is the water of life . Point noted. Another thing which i quite liked was his take on LSD and other modern drugs . Without sounding mawkish and uninformed or for that matter even sycophantic , he unapologetically emphasizes on the importance of drugs in the initial phases of strengthening the Zen principles ( he doesn't quite glorify 'concentration ' it's Zen that he speaks of) . Afterall Zen he says has etymologically originated from Dhyan (meditation) and the same needs to be extended in everyday existence ; it shouldn't end up being a half hour process at sync with/surrogated by morning walks , laughing clubs yoga etc etc.

      I don't get much to think these days. At length and at large , I am just another 'me' that i have come to know  Much recently , just a few seasons back.  I think i could love her if i were gay, Which i am not. The only female i felt , i had madly loved And lusted after Is no longer a female . Powered by her zeal to forsake the female within She moves around , in her thoughts and purposes Like any other male friend of mine  And i can't bear to see this metamorphosis.  She is playing Narcissus these days. Holding on to her new found sexuality and  Rediscovering her new reflection , The one which is illusively her's . And like a fool she must be wandering Oh! this is me .  She now must be completely in love with herself And i don't love her anymore.  If and when her thought petrifies They will bear flowers too . The flowers which won't be picked up by men  For their lovers or paramours Unless ofcourse , they happen to be gay.

      Joel Pinto can write the saddest song tonight He has all the means and reasons  His heart pines for a very old lover The one he had met near the Colaba cemetery On one of those desperate afternoons When he had always felt , weak and insecure  All by himself in an urban landscape Big Big city blues , he was convinced She came like an unannounced evening  A bit early and a bit unexpected Joel Pinto was only twenty three and  She was perhaps a touch over nineteen They met and mingled with the  Retreating monsoons And felt that they had somehow wanted  To live together  When she had left , without any reasons Or maybe with too many to answer just one He had cried , unknowingly subconsciously For her  She never heard , she never returned   Joel Pinto was ageing without a wish When he had stopped counting the springs anymore Of his life He saw her again , unexpectedly ,unwantingly But there she was without a clue  Without any reason By now Joel Pinto had become used to  His memories  The body in flesh and blood , imbalanced his thoughts It didn't jolt him enough though He realized he had still loved her  Joel believed he had always done so , in his way It's just that he never became conscious He became , once she had left  He wondered whether it was necessary for him to be conscious About something , which he knew was so very obvious It took him 34 more years to realize that it wasn't  Possible for any other person to understand him And he felt a quietful peace   Joel Pinto felt like fighting with himself He was convinced , that she had become a part of his memory She didn't earn the right to present herself in flesh and blood She simply didn't  Joel Pinto wanted to hate her  He definitely did He remembered how much she had made him pine  How many nights , countless days How she had left him without a notice  Why she had to do , what she did ? Unanswered questions   Unanswered questions are like bitter better medicines They cure but they leave something condescending behind A liquid curse , when Pinto swallowed his saliva  A stomach cramp when he thought and thought And he had plundered his stomach tissues with so much of acid At times he felt , if he could wash her face with his 'own' acid But something in him stopped him from doing that He thought about the face , he had so gently kissed , Held in his palms  Touched and caressed with the tips of his fingers Scratched with his nails  He used to stare blankly at his own reflection  And started to wander  'I can't scour this face , I can't sour this face either' Acids can scour and they are almost always sour in taste No one knew more about acids than Joel Pinto He was the Hydrochoric acid man   Joel Pinto wanted to hate her He had every reason to do so , He wanted too But still he couldn't Joel Pinto realized another new thing after 34 years and 6 months You don't dictate love , it dictates you He kept quite and didn't speak to himself for 2 days  He felt defeated , he didn't feel like waking up  And facing life He just wanted to sleep tonight a lot lot more Joel Pinto can now write the saddest song tonight He has all the means , he had lost the reasons But today for a change Joel would just sleep

      Sleepy Sleepy afternoons Inviting blue skies Wide open window  Vintage decaying plastered mansion Familiar face A look that almost touches you everywhere Shampood ,freed and wet black hair And an even more black cup of coffee Are all the apparitions  For my vacation blues  Often on some mornings When even wasted time retires , To stop from being routine All the ashtrays are crowded by dead fires All around When i pass on the news to a passing wind Tell her just that 'I am unwell' Remember the busstops , the rain and the nights A pair of wet socks , a navel with no lights Your skimpy clothes ,an empty bottle of rum A letter on a hotel bill and my unwashed cum Now every morning when the telephone sucks Asks me to wake up without you by my side Now whenever the caution bell strikes On sleepy highways without time and tide I collect this ghost-thoughts And arrange them quick Neatly ,orderly for my vacation blues  Often during evenings When you decide to walk back home Saving your soft body from stares and buses When very old people look at you  With a lot of pain , with a whole burden of years You walk past them , soft and quiet Like a century or a lifetime that has refused to move Maybe you were someone's lover , someone's wife  Someone's yesterday or everyday life Even you must have tried to find a way out A way to get lost and never be found Remember the blindfolds , red sripes on your back Fish on the sea shore ,drunk like a maniac Remember the soap ,the towel and the shower And apart from the bed all that was shared Now whenever you open your mouth to curse You remind me of all the sins of my birth Or else why would have you beared so much of pain Forgotten the body which only bears my name Forgotten all the places where i had my home Every bit of you which is only mine  I have distorted all these memories And arranged them imperfectly To share with me a place on some time All alone in my vacation blues
