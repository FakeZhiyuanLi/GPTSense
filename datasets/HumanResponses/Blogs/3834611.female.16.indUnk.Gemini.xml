       I just totally binged and I'm feeling really depressed.  I have a lot of sores in my mouth from purging so much and I really can't purge.  I just hate myself so fucking much.  No matter how hard it is in the moment, I am going to fast like I never have before to get rid of the Klondike Bars that have gone directly to my thighs.  I am so disgusted by myself and I can't stand it anymore.  My hands are fat.  My ankles are fat.  For fuck's sake, my ears are fat.    I just wish I could be a normal girl.  I wish I didn't have to beat myself up so much over some ice cream.  But I'll never be able to escape the Nutrition Facts label; it literally haunts my dreams.  I wish I were blessed with a super-fast metabolism, but who doesn't?  I wish I were less like me and more like the people I wish I were like.  Why did I have to turn out so messed up?  Why couldn't I get addicted to running instead of something so degrading, depressing, shameful?  I'll tell you one thing: there's   nothing   more degrading than being splashed in the face by your own barf and knowing that it's all your doing.  I wish I were "that girl".  I just wish I weren't so fucking me.  "Reality is a crutch for people who can't cope with drugs." -- Lily Tomlin "It is possible to fail in many ways...while to succeed is possible only in one way." --Aristotle "If we don't succeed, we run the risk of failure." -- Dan Quayle "Try as hard as we may for perfection, the net result of our labors is an amazing variety of imperfectness. We are surprised at our own versatility in being able to fail in so many different ways." -- Samuel McChord Crothers "Good habits result from resisting temptation." -- Ancient Proverb  Okay enough of that.  I'm sitting here reading quotations about health and I'm reflecting.  I'm really sick.  If I am eating at all, I throw it right up.  I have a disease that is bound to plague me until my dying day, whenever that may be.  It could be tomorrow; it could be in 10,000 tomorrows.  This disease has wrapped its hands around me and with every day that passes it squeezes harder and harder; I am going to suffocate in the hands of this disease.  But I'm not ready; I am not ready to put this behind me.  The idea of death, though somewhat real, as of yet has not become such a threat that would cause me to take such an action.  My heart wrenches and my brain screams; and still I say no.

       Today actually wasn't as boring as I thought it was going to be.  I was banking on spending the whole day just watching my sister, but about two hours after I woke up (while I was coloring in the Cinderella coloring book with my sister) my uncle stopped by the house to pick something up from my brother and ask me if I wanted to go to my aunt's house (his sister) for dinner.  As I believe any normal person would (though I am far from par) I accepted and we got into the Jeep and drove away; but not after I had taken some leftover Xenadrine (without ephedra, and total crap - it's a mental thing.  Since I was the only vegetarian going, I brought some "rabbit food" (as my uncle put it) to eat.  I ate my rabbit food (broccoli in a fat-free cheese sauce) and we had dessert. I had too much dessert and I was completely stressing out because I was in a totally foreign environment and it's hard for me to purge in infamiliar territory.  So I waited until I got home (at about 8) and ate a little more for intestinal pressure and got the shit up.    I called Nell again today, after kind of hearing about her little "birthday bbq" that apparently took place last night.  There was no answer.  Fireworks are really annoying. My dog is barking at them.

            Okay. I have my journal. Hereupon comes forth the challenge of keeping it current. Ha ha. I'll try. I honestly will.       Today was interesting, to say the least. I don't remember why, but upon awakening (rather early, as a matter of fact), I decided to look in my nightstand drawer; for no particular reason. As my luck usually  wouldn't  have it, I found a lone Stacker 2 pill. Ah, salvation.  Well, naturally I took it (wouldn't you?) and as a result almost had a perfect day.  As of about 8 o'clock, I had eaten a small peach; and, boy was I full! Then came 8 o'clock. I got bored and when I get bored I munch. At first, all I was physically able to eat was half of a Boca burger. I gave the other half to my dog. Then I had a corn chip.  Then I had about 12 Wheat Thins. Not so bad thus far.  But I then continued to eat a very generous amount of those corn chips (probably less than it felt, though because I drank a lot of water with it).  After the corn chips I proceeded to consume a yogurt-dipped granola bar and 2 bowls of Rice Krispies and skim milk.  I'm pretty sure that if you are reading this, you know what is coming next. Oh, yes. Purge, baby, purge.  Now, I usually purge in the bathroom sink because the toilets in this old house don't flush very well; so I purged in the sink as I have been for the past few months or so.  Usually I don't have a problem getting the...residue down the drain.  But NOO, tonight there had to be a problem.  There is a big fat clog in the drain, and we have no LiquidPlmr or Draino.  My dad and my sister are at fireworks with the neighbors and my mom is in bed, recuperating. I asked my mom, just to be sure, if there was any LiquidPlmr or Draino and (as my luck WOULD have it this time) she said no, but my father would pick some up tomorrow.  If my dad cleans out that drain, he's going to find out about my ed, I think.  (BTW, when I told my mom about the clog I told her that I was washing my hands when I noticed that the water wasn't going down the drain). I'm not that worried about my dad figuring anything out, though.  One time (during my purge in the shower days) he found a container of the non-liquid stuff that wouldn't fit down the shower drain that I had forgotten to empty and he proceeded to tell me that if I had to throw up, that the toilet was the place to do it. Well, he just came home. Wish me luck.
