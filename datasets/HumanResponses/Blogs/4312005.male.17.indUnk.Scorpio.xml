      Olympics are being held in Greece, that's one of our neighbors, one of our bordering countries. Albanians have had a long big time, mainly informal conflict with Greeks. It’s all about territorial subjects; Greeks claim that actually the southern part of Albania is Greek, while Albanians (Tchams) were kicked out of northern Greece with their houses burnt 100 or so years ago.  Relationships between Albania and Greece looked like were going to get better after the elections in Greece, because the new-coming Greek Prime Minister claimed that Albanian immigrants (they’re a lot) would have a better treatment after he came in power. He came in power but there was not any big change.  So what does it have to do with Olympics?  One Albanian athlete and two Albanian weightlifters played as Greeks at the current Olympics, as they have been doing for 10 years by now. You have Mirela Manjani, that holds (till 1 year ago, I don’t know about now) the Pike-throwing world Record. Pirro Dhima (naturalized as Spyros Dimas in Greece), who won some weightlifting gold medals in the last two Olympics and won bronze this year. And last but not least, Luan Shabani (Leonidas Sabanis I think :D) who is also a great medal holder, but who  unfortunately  was disqualified for doping (everyone was happy in Tirana about that).  Yes, Greece offers them much more money that Albania does. Yes, Greece gives them much better ways to train that Albania does. Yes, Greece gives them the Greek nationality which is much more useful that the Albanian one. But that does not mean you have to revolutionize your nationality. Mr. Dimas stated that he is proud to be Greek; reality check Spyros, you were born in Albania, like it or not you had and will have Albanian blood in your body for all your life, you are Albanian.  In the other side you can see Slave athletes playing for Greece. Well they never say they are Greek. Actually they always say they are from Serbia or Macedonia or every other country they are from. They accept the fact that they are playing for Greece, and they like it, but they don’t fuck with their nationality.  Last paragraph is about the Greek team that takes part in the Olympics that are being held in Athens (Greece). Out of 8 weightlifters that take part in the Greek team, only 2 of them are Greeks. And what about the Greek baseball team? There is no one there who was actually born in Greece…That makes you think :)!  That’s it for now!  j.

      It’s an original title, isn’t it?  Well the thing is this, people in Albania, and mainly in the Balkans consider drinking coffee a sport :). Every teenager has more-or-less the same agenda during summer afternoons. At about 18:00 you start getting yourself prepared for going out. You will need 15 minutes if you are a male and an hour or so if u are a female.  Than you go out of your home, take either a bus or a taxi, and go to "The Block". Yeah it looks like a fancy name, actually it was the place where communist leaders had their homes during the communist regime here, today it is totally transformed..! After you arrive at "The Block" and meet your friends, you go to your favorite bar/coffee-shop/café and stay there for at least 1 hour and a half. And what do you do? Just chat!  So how will I survive without my 1~2 daily coffee-drinking hours? Where will I find a place to spend at least half an hour drinking a damn cup of coffee so I will feel like home...Will I really have time for that?  j.

      Hi Everyone (anyone)!      It's 3:53 in the morning at this moment, and I just decided i have to start a blog! I live in Tirana, Albania. I have been living here for 6325 days, 151800 hours...I was actually born here :)! Well here it comes, i'm moving to Toronto, Canada the 8th of September...  This is just the first post but i would like to say so many things. I'm sure a lot of people will not consider my moving a big deal. I think that's normal. At this precise moment, i don't consider it a big deal neither so your question will be: -"Than, why are you creating this blog?". Well the answer for me is simple. I'm sure that when i will actually go to Toronto and settle there my feelings, my emotions, my thoughts about this moving will change.  I love Tirana. I love Albania. I love Albanian. I love Albanians. But i'm bored of each of them.  So the imminent result of this blog will be to describe my last 14 or so days in Tirana, and than my new life in Toronto.  That's it for the first post!  j.
