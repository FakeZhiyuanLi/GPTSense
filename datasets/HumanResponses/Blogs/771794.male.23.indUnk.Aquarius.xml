       Lonely Liar   I stand in the middle of the road A man with no place to go looking to rid my heavy load on anyone, I'll make it so  I am the Lord of all I survey Because I'm blind as a bat they all want to laugh, don't they? the creature that drinks their blood shall be getting fat  not a promise or a threat just a simple observation the bus stop is where they all met and I'll be waiting at the station  Then I remember one simple truth I am a lonely liar standing in the street eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth is why I'm blinded and beat

       That Blinking Light   That blinking light plagues every dream makes me want to scream can't sleep in the night  That blinking light just won't let me be it's all I ever see I will lose the fight  That blinking light they said just to unplug I did, and son of a bug Those bastards were right

       Innocent Face   A smile, a most deadly smile sits upon an innocent face trust is not something I give to one with such grace  staring at each other for a while time goes by without a trace Is dying a better option than to live? you say you just made your case  the sounds are getting louder it's time for a change of pace we come together you and I and we share warm embrace  turning ourselves into powder to see which one wins the race you took our love and let it die still keeping your innocent face

       The Clock Part 1: The Naked Dance Of Twilight   Under the Demon Moon We dance naked by the fire 12 strikes at the bell Anticipation getting higher  Out of the shadows And into the night Roam the creatures of Hell The Demons take their flight  With a rain of blood, We see our Knights enter the fray We stop dancing and we join in a circle For we are acolytes and we must pray  Let us have no fear For the end is in sight We must always remember  The Clock strikes at Midnight

       Nothing in Particular   Bring me your fear show me what you got shout "the end is near" it's closer than you thought  Sing me your song tell me what you like curse it for being long and not being able to ride a bike  Tell me the truth it doesn't make sense you are a really great sleuth but in the end you are really dense  Sell me your soul shed a crocodile tear place a handfull of dust in a bowl and then you will see exactly what you fear

       Visitor   God knocked on my door I said, "How can I help you" He just looked at the floor I asked, "Anything I can do" Not one expression he wore  I gazed into his white eyes and he turned his head "where does a person go when he dies" I asked, and not a word he said He didn't have to speak for me to hear his lies  An uneasiness gathered in the air So God just walked away I whispered, "have a nice day, take care" "Who was that" I heard someone say I just said, "There was nobody there"

       The Ocean   I have never seen the ocean in real life. I have only seen the ocean move in my dreams. I know the ocean to be calm and powerful. Water ripping the land at the seems.  The pictures I have seen are amazing. But there is one Ocean that dwarfs the rest. The beauty that this Ocean brings, Puts my silent heart to the test.  The Ocean talks to me in silent words Her voice I am longing to hear. If the earth can provide something this gorgeous, Then there is nothing on earth to fear.

       Through Your Eyes   Everything just disappears Darkness becomes it's disguise I see a window into paradise While I am looking through your eyes  I manage to forget all of my fears The thought of pain is a bundle of lies My feelings are wonderful and nice Because I am looking through your eyes  So much emotion, brings me to tears Time stands still, the pain just dies To find true happiness, I need no advice All I do, is look through your eyes

       In The Mirror   Step right up, look into the mirror And behold! A failure shall appear You'll never find what you are looking for You might as well head on out the door  Go ahead, walk down the one way street the road is burning and blistering your feet the sun above you makes you sweat and thirst all the sacrifices you make will be your first  You figure out the road shall never end this long journey is worthless to defend because the epiphany you searched for is near your greatest enemy is in the mirror

       The Clock Part 3: The Satyr's Song   I just go, skipping down the road I haven't a care on this earth It doesn't matter me none Who wins this pathetic turf  I am here for my own amusement While a battle goes above my head A rain of bodies fall from the sky I'll be glad when they are all dead  the watchers and the acolytes, they are human, pitiful scum indeed I just laugh at them, what else can I do? It's most funny to watch them all bleed  The demons and angelic knights they fill the sky with fire Twelve strikes at the bell Means nothing to this Satyr

       The Clock part 2: Endless Night   The dawn will not be coming The sun shall never again appear I wait by the glow of the moonlight All of the terrible sounds of night I hear  By no means am I nocturnal I have to adjust myself to this place I must make my home in the darkness because the light we will no longer face  I am a witness, a keeper of the tale I see the battle, I see the war The bloodshed pouring down I do not know what the fight is for  Every hour the Clock strikes twelve every minute another needless fight I am but one witness to the madness here, watching, waiting in this endless night

I wish I could hold you close to me, whisper comfort in your ear. I wish I could wake up, with you lying next to me. I wish I was there to laugh with you. I wish I was there to sing with you. I wish I was there to cry with you. I wish I was there to wipe away your tears. I wish I had your strengh. I wish I had your courage. I wish I was there to share every thought. I wish I was there to share every dream. I wish I was there. I wish

       An Angel Named Marie   I lived alone in my darkness My dreams to share with no one Causing chaos, anger, and fear That was my idea of fun  But all that nonsense I admit was to fill the void in my life All that I felt was pain Cutting through me like a knife  I needed to end the suffering And the only solution I could see Was to ask the Heavens to send an Angel And they sent me an Angel named Marie  Her eyes are the reflection of Heaven Her voice is that of an Angelic Choir If I said I didn't enjoy her presence Then I would be labeled a liar  The Darkness is in retreat Intense brightness fills the place The light is coming from this beautiful Angel Whose very existence puts a smile on my face  My life has a new meaning My goal is plain to see to live life to the fullest and to love an Angel named Marie

       The Glow Of The Moonlight   There is an Angel looking over the city tonight She is bathing in the glow of the moonlight The wind is blowing her nightgown in the cool air The glow of the moonlight shines in her golden hair The song she is singing is such a lovely tune Accompanied only by the glow of the moon

      The sign had said welcome. So I walked right in. There was a lemon meringue pie sitting at the counter. I asked if it was in charge. It said, "No, the man with exceptionally large earlobes is." I asked where I could find this man. The pie told me to go find my ruler and try to measure the length of a toad's tail. The pie was not being too helpful. So I ate him. He tasted well, but I never really like lemon meringue pie. So I went looking around the store. It was filled with little nicknacks, none of which have any use in everyday life. I did find one item I could really use. A stapler that uses plastic staples. Now why would I need such a stapler? The answer is quite simple. Metal staples hurt like hell, when you staple them in your arm. Since no one was minding the store, I decided to go ahead and take the stapler. As I was about to walk out the door, I heard a voice from behind. It was the man with exceptionally large earlobes. He asked. "where do you think you are going with that, boy?" I replied, "to then den of a thousand sorrows, sir." He said I would be sorry for stealing the stapler. I screamed, "NEVER!!!" and I ran at him. He turned his head, whipping hie earlobes at me. I ducked just in time. I pushed him to the ground and stomped at him with my hooves. Just then, I threw up the lemon meringue pie. The pie cursed at me. I just said, "Screw this!" and I left.

      I saw him again last night. Who you might ask. I can't tell you. It's a secret. Bah you insolent toad! You shall never discovery my plans. They are way beyond your comprehension, this I know. Foolish mortal, you dare cross the Satyr? You will suffer a fate worse than death. You will suffer the pain of watching a Full House marathon. How can I be so cruel? I am the Satyr. And not just any Satyr, I am the Virtual Satyr. He who plays pool with many a fool. Except for a couple, they are cool.   What mustard lurks on the bottom on men's shoes? Only the Satyr knows. And no, I'm not telling.

      I got up one morning to get the paper. A taxi cab filled with 27 donkeys was doing donuts in my backyard. I stomped my foot. The taxi rolled over twice. The donkey that was driving got out. I asked him how long until the sun explodes into a million tacos. He said in a thousand years it will be tomorrow. I said tomorrow was a clown that spits in your face when it arrives and kicks you in the ass when it leaves. The donkey did a cartwheel. I wrote down every detail to send to the president of the fingernail files. The donkey was not pleased. He asked why I would send such information to his enemy/brother. I said it was because he was doing donuts in my backyard.

      Go to the library. Go to the help desk and ask if they have any books on how to take over the world. Ask why not. Tell them it is for a school project. Then just ask if they have a book on dinosaurs. When checking it out, laugh a very evil laugh. Return the book a week later with a note saying "THANKS!"

      Walk up to a complete stranger. Ask him how he is doing. Talk to him like you have known him a long time. If he calls you on the fact he doesn't know you from Adam, just laugh.  After you are done with the pleasentries, lean close to him and whisper this in his ear...  "They are in the vacuum cleaners. They eat the dirt. They grow strong on it. Soon they will unite and take over the world."  The guy should ask you who?  You say, "The Dust Bunnies" and start to laugh like a madman and skip away.  Don't walk, don't run.  SKIP.

      Well now, what have we here? A little visitor to my humble little home? Ahh yes, I see, you are selling magazines. I have no use for magazines my dear lad. Why don't you come in anyway? Ahhh, I see, but if you stay for a little bit, I may buy a subscription. Heh, heh, I knew you would see things my way.  A long time ago, I was a warrior. I fought bravely and bled many, many times. All for one purpose, one goal, to bring forth a new era, the era of Non-Celebrities.  Why would I fight for such a goal?  Everywhere you look, celebrities. They even have a television show about the people who stalk the celebrities and photograph them. Papa Rotsee, I think they are called. Hmmm, Paprazzi, ahh thanks lad. I see you know what I am talking about.  These actors, these celebrities, they think they own the world. The show up at their big gala events so they can win awards and thank each other and pat each other on the back and blah, blah, blah. It's all one big masturbation party if you ask me. Winning awards and crying, as though they were just handed the Nobel Prize for being God's greatest creation.  And everyone wants to be a celebrity. Everyone wants their 15 minutes of fame. That's why they have these so called "reality" shows. So jackasses can go on TV and show the world how much of a jackass they can be. Bah, reality shows.   Celebrities get the world handed to them, and if something bad were to happen to one of them, like breaking a fingernail, the whole world would screech to a halt. "Oh! How can we help you with that? Oh, would you like a bottle of water and a nice vegetarian sandwich?" Bah, celebrities, always surrounding themselves with ass-kissers.   The world would be a much better place without celebrities, boy, let me tell you that. So, what magazine are you selling sonny?  You are selling subscription to Entertainment Weekly? You are dead you little prick motherfucker!

      I keep having this weird dream. In this dream, I am standing in a place I hate. And I am doing something I hate to do. And I am pretty sure I despise everyone around me, and in this dream, I fantasize about their horrible deaths. Every time I look at the screen, the time is there, taunting me. It's laughing at me, it knows my pain and it finds it funny. The idiots around me keep speaking, no...they keep barking like dogs, and I just want to yell "Shut Up!!!" as loud as I can. And then I wake up.  And I realize it's not a dream.

      Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Jeff. Jeff didn't like his family too well. They treated him like he was dirt. Jeff was also not liked at school. That's because Jeff was the next Hitler. Yeah, everybody knew it. At 8 years old, Jeff was already readin Mein Kampf. Jeff also liked to play out in the middle of the street. Yep, Jeff loved it out there. In fact, Jeff wanted to know what it would be like to get hit by a car...   At least that's the story I told myself after I ran him over.

      Satyr: "Ha Ha! Gweg! I got it figured out!"  The Satyr was excited about something and Gweg could hardly wait to find out what it was. Actually, Gweg couldn't wait to watch the Satyr fail at whatever he was doing this time.  Gweg: "What is it?"  Satyr: "You know how all of these women keep telling me I have a sexy voice?"   Gweg: "Uh...no."  Satyr: "Well they do. It has been mentioned many times. So I thought to myself, 'Hmmm, what would be the best way to benefit from such a great gift?' And like that, poof!, the answer came to me."  Gweg: "I am going to regret asking this, but what?"  Satyr: "I am going to create my own 900 number."  Gweg: "Yep, I can see this working."  And so it came to pass, the Virtual Satyr came up with his own phone sex hotline: 1-900-SEXY-SATYR.  Satyr: "All right. Everything is in place. Soon, I will be talking to hundreds of lonesome ladies out there, all in need of some Satyr Spice in their life."  Gweg just shook his head.  After a few hours, the first call came in.  Satyr: "Hello. This is the Satyr speaking. I am ready to please you. Why don't you tell me your name.  Caller with a deep female voice: "My name is Martha."  Satyr: "Martha, what a sexy name. Tell me Martha. What would you like me to do for you?"  Martha: "First you can start by cleaning this damn floor."  Satyr: "Uh ok. Would you like me to do this in the nude?"  Martha: "I don't care if you do it wearing a tank top and bell bottoms, that fucking floor better be clean."  Satyr: "But Martha, there is so much more I can do for you."  Martha: "I hear a lot of talking, when I should be hearing a lot vacuuming."  Satyr: "Ok. I'll vacuum. Uh..vroom vroom vroom...you know Martha, there is a lot of nifty things I could be doing with this vacuum cleaner."  Martha: "The only thing you had better be doing with it is cleaning the goddamn floor, bitch."  Satyr: "Oh that's it."  Satyr hanged up the phone. He looked at Gweg. Gweg was laughing.   Satyr: "Ok. So the first one was a freak. You'll get that from time to time in this business. But, it doesn't matter. The next call will be some poor undersexed chick, and I'll be so good, she won't be able to get enough.  Gweg: "Whatever you say, Romeo"  Satyr gave Gweg an angry look. Soon after that the phone rang again.  Satyr: "Hello. This is the Satyr at your service. What can I do for you, sexy lady?"  Caller with a high pitched male voice: "Well oh so sexy Satyr let me tell you this; it's not what you can do for me, it's what I can do to you."  Satyr immediately hanged up the phone. He looked over at Gweg, who was rolling on the floor, laughing his ass off.  Satyr: "Oh, you think it's funny, huh? Well then Gweg, why don't you give it a shot then. Let's see how well that squeaky voice of yours does on the phone. We'll get a lot of money from the next caller, because they wont be able to hang up the phone from laughing to hard."  Gweg: "You're on."   The phone rang and Gweg picked it up.  Gweg: "Hello. My name is Gweg. Let's talk, about anything you'd like."  Caller with a throaty, sultry, sexy voice: "Hello Gweg. You have an interesting voice for a 900 phone sex guy. You sound like a person I could talk all night to."  Gweg put his hand over the phone and looked at the Satyr.  Gweg: "I'd better take this to the other room."  Gweg got up and went to the other room. As Gweg was leaving, Satyr could hear him say, "Wow. It must be really cold where you are at."  The Satyr watched Gweg leave with a disgusted look on his face. "That damn bastard" he grumbled. All of the sudden there was a fierce pounding on the front door.  Satyr: "Yeah! Just a second! I'll be right there."  Satyr got up and went to the door. When he opened it, he saw a very tall, very big woman standing there. The Satyr knew who it was, even before she spoke.  Woman at the door: "Guess what, bitch. My windows need washing too."

      "What are you doing?" "I am making counterfeit money."  Gweg did not like this idea. Gweg didn't like anything about the situation he was in for that matter. For eternity, Gweg was damned, traveling to dimension to dimension, always being killed off by a great being known only as the "Richard". For some odd reason, the current Earth dimension he was in did not have the "Richard".  Instead, it had this chaos causing, trouble making creature. He called himself the Virtual Satyr.  Gweg asked, "Isn't counterfeiting illegal?"  The Satyr said, "Of course not Gweg. In fact the government encourages people to make their own money, because it helps them out, that means less money for them to make."  Gweg said, "I don't know. It still sounds fishy."  The Satyr said, "Think about it this way Gweg; we are getting paid to print money. The money we are getting paid with, is the money we print. We are simply cutting out the middle man."  Gweg said, "I guess that makes sense."  "Of course it does, because I thought of it. Everything I do has a reason and it is always right. Don't worry Gweg, you are in good hands."  Gweg took a look at one of the bills. Gweg could instantly tell it was fake. Gweg asked the Satyr,  "Why does it say 'In Bob Dylan We Trust'."  The Satyr said, "Because 'In God We Trust' caused to much controversy. Therefore, I changed that little slogan, and I picked a suitable replacement, somebody all Americans could get behind, and that man is Bob Dylan."  Gweg said, "Why couldn't you put something like, 'Our Leaders', or 'Our Founding Fathers', or 'A Higher Power'".  The Satyr said, "These people that you mention, yes I know them, they are quite lame."  So Gweg and The Satyr went out to spend their fake money. Their first stop was at at the drive-up hot dog stand.  The Satyr ordered some food.  "Yeah, I'll take 50 cheese dogs, 5 orders of fries, and two giant jugs of root beer."  The chick who took their order started to walk away, but then the Satyr remembered something.  "Hey wait, I forgot something."  The chick walked back to the car.  "Hey Gweg, what do you want to eat?"  It was an hour later until all of their food was made, when the Satyr paid the chick, she could tell the money was fake.  "Excuse me sir, but I'm pretty sure that this fat guy with a beard is not supposed to be on a twenty."  The Satyr said, "That's George Lucas for your information."  The chick said, "Well whoever he is, he's not on real twenties. And who the hell is Bob Dylan anyway?"  The Satyr said, "Well, if you are going to put up such a fuss, I'm not going to leave you a tip."  The chick said, "whateva." and left with all of the food.  Gweg said, "I told you it wasn't going to work."  The Satyr said, "Don't worry, I have a plan, we'll get some use out of this money."  Sunday. Church.   The preacher was given the collection plate, and he shouted "Hallelujah!" as soon as he saw it. The plate was filled the most money he has ever seen.  The preacher said, "I would like to thank God for sending such generous souls to this church." The preacher picked up one of the bills. "You see this bretheren, this is a sign that God watches out for his own..." The preacher then had a stumped look on his face.  "Who the hell is Bob Dylan?"

      Go out and buy 100 recordable CDs.   On these CDs, burn copies of Beatles music.  Go to the corner of a street that has many pedestrians on any given day.  Hand out the CDs.  As you hand them out, be sure to tell the person, "Paul McCartney died for your sins."  And with this, we will begin "The First Church of The Beatles".  This will work, after all, the Beatles are more popular than Jesus.  Yes, our church will be big. And most importantly, tax exempt.  And so I leave you all with a reading from our Beatles Bible...  A Hard Day's Night Chapter 1, Verse 2 "It's been a hard day's night, I should be sleeping like a log."  Amen

      Hey kids! It's time for today's lesson!   Here's the stuation:  You and a buddy have just stopped at your favorite fast food joint to pick up some grub. Inside, there is some drunk dude. Now the drunk dude asks you for a ride to a gas station and then to a motel. Your fried is shaking his head no and saying that "we are in a hurry" when you really are not. So do you...  a) Tell the drunk, "Sorry bud, no can do."? b) Say, "Sure bud. Hop on in." And give him a ride to where he wants to go? c) Say, "Sure bud. Hop on in." Find a nice secluded place, kill and rob him?   Of course, the corrct answer is c...  Don't forget, if your friend gives you shit, kill him too.  And I leave you with this...  Drunk Dude: "Are either of you guys bi or gay? I need to know, I am a salesman."

      Ugh. This dude at work has this hot chick/co-worker wanting to bone him...but the dude won't go for it.  "She's too crazy." or "I have a girlfriend"...this is what he says when we tell him to tap that fine ass...  But no, he can't do it.  Let me tell you something my friends...this dude has something we like to call morals.  And we all know where morals come from, don't we?  That's right...morals were invented by the government, so we can't have any fun.  Do you want the corrupt, evil government to stop you from having a good time?  Of course you don't.  So, don't be like the dude, screw morals. If you got some ol' ball and chain and some chick wants to spend a night on Mr. Toad's Wild Ride....go ahead and do it...don't let these morals get in the way.

      One of the ten commandments is "Thou Shalt Not Covet Thy Neighbor's Goods"  Well...we all suffer from temptation don't we? However, your friendly, neighborhood Satyr has come up with a perfect plan to get rid of that temptation.  When your neighbor is not home, go over there and be sure to take a lot of gasoline.  Break into his house and pour the gasoline all over...and make a trail with it out of the door.  Set the gas on fire and watch that mother burn!  Yes!!! The temptation now has been removed.

      When I was young, I used to tell people I was abducted by aliens. No one ever believed me.  So a good idea, would to be tell the kid you're kidnapping and experimenting on for scientific purposes, that you are an alien.  That way, after you let the kid go, when he tells everyone, no one will believe him.

The Doc: "No, he died a few minutes ago, but I just saved a bundle by switching my car insurance over to Geico."
