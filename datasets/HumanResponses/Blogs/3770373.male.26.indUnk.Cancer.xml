      (Please read this whole post, I know it's long but it's important.)  Yesterday I said that today I was going to talk about Microsoft's revolutionary new technology. And indeed I was in the process of writing out that particular post, talking about how exciting this technology was and the wonderful things it could allow as to create that would make life so much better. I was almost done when I just happened to be browsing through MSNBC.com and saw an  urlLink article  from MSNBC blogger Eric Alterman entitled "Atheism un-american?" In the article he mentions several political commentators (all republican, mind you) who try to discredit their political rivals by calling them atheists. The idea of course being that if you're an atheist, your ideas carry little value.   Reading that made me angry enough to ditch the post I was working on and start compiling info for this post instead. It reminded me of a story I had read about several years back. This story if about former president George H. W. Bush and it goes a little something like this (portions of this story copied from an article originally written by Madalyn O'Hair in 1991):   When Bush, Sr. was campaigning for the presidency in 1987 he made a stop in Chicago Illinois on August 27th where he held a formal news conference. There he spoke briefly with Robert Sherman, a reporter for American Atheists who was a participating member of the press corps by invitation. Sherman asked Bush: "What will you do to win the votes of American's who are atheist?"   Bush replies, "I guess I'm pretty week in the atheist community. Faith in God is important to me."   Sherman: "Surely you recognize the equal citizenship and patriotism of Americans who are atheists?"   Bush: "No, I don't know that atheists should be considered as citizens, nor should they be considered patriots. This is one nation under God."   But, wait! It gets even better! On December 23 1990 in Chicago Sherman met with Ed Derwinski, the secretary of the Department of Veteran's Affairs, to discuss exclusion of American Atheists from veteran's groups which have been chartered by the United States Congress. Mr. Derwinski said he would do "absolutely nothing" about the discrimination. On January 3, Mr. Sherman crossed paths with Ed Derwinski again at the Illinois inaugurations. He asked Mr. Derwinski, at that time, what American Atheists could do to have the Bush administration take an interest in the problem of discrimination against American Atheist veterans. Mr. Derwinski's response was:   "What you should do for me is what you should do for everybody: Believe in God. Get off our backs."   So it was the clearly stated policy of the Bush, Sr. administration that atheists should not be considered citizens and that discrimination against atheists was perfectly acceptable by that administration. After all, if they're not American citizens, how can they be discriminated against?   Fortunately, that was over 10 years ago. Things have changed since then, right?   Hmmm... perhaps not. One of the first things that Bush did when he took office was establish the "President's Council on Bioethics." It was the job of this council to discuss bioethical matters such as stem cell research, abortion, birth control, etc. to find ethical research solutions and then present these solutions to the president to become policy. On the surface this sounds like a good idea. In reality, though, this council does nothing more then support the official Bush policy. On February 28th two researchers, Elizabeth Blackburn and William May, were fired by the Bush administration from their positions on the Council. It is important to note that of the 18 person council, these were the only two members who did not support the official Bush policy that stem cell research, abortion, and birth control were immoral. They were instead replaced by two non-scientists who supported the Bush party line.   Bush has also said that he wants to fund faith-based initiatives to teach abstinence to teenagers and refuses to provide funding for any initiative that teaches birth control, or some combination of birth control and abstinence.   He has repeatedly said in speeches that America is on a "divine" mission and that God wanted him to be elected. In fact, Deborah Caldwell of the religion news service of the Pew Organization wrote an  urlLink article  expressing her concern over Bush's ever increasing theology. She talks about how Bush's personal religious beliefs are influencing his policy decisions more and more.   There is nothing wrong with having a deeply held religious belief. We are all free to believe whatever we want to believe, that's what makes this country great. So if you feel that devoting your life to Jesus is the right thing for you to do then by all means devote your life to Jesus. But it becomes a problem when you start trying to force your religious beliefs on other people.   What we have here is George W. Bush, our president, making policy decisions, funding decisions, war decisions, based on his religious beliefs! This is a commingling of church and state at the highest levels of government!! As an atheist this both scares and angers me, even more so then his father's remarks in 1987. But this is not a problem that should only scare atheists! Most people believe in a god in one form or the other. The general consensus is that the atheist population is only 7-9% of the population. But not everyone who believes in a god believes in the same god or in the same way. Bush is drafting legislation around his own brand of conservative evangelical christianity. But what about the Jews, the Muslims, the more liberal christians, the wicca, the pagans, the satanists, the buddhists, etc, etc, etc....? Just like the atheists, they too are having religious beliefs that are not their own forced upon them in the form of presidential policy decisions!   We have a constitutionally mandated separation of church and state. Every day he is in office that man finds new ways to break that separation. Do not allow your elected leaders to force a religion down your throat, do not allow them to shape policy around their religious beliefs, but most importantly... do not allow that man to win reelection!!!!!!

      Finally! A productive day! I went to the gym after work today to finally cancel my membership. I joined over three years ago and have gone a grand total of 19 times since then (at least according to the gym's computers, I could have sworn it was less then that). So for the past three years I've been giving them 50 bucks a month in free money. Very generous of me, right? Well, I finally went down there to pull the plug on their free meal ticket... two hours later I was victorious! I think quitting a gym must be one of the hardest things in the world to do... they send person after person to convince you to stay... they bring in the most attractive people to show you what you can become if you only keep paying... and they just wouldn't give up! I wonder how many people who go in with the intention to quit wind up staying just because the endless parade of salespeople and hardbodies wear them down.   So that's 50 bucks a month I'm saving. Plus I finally paid off my Victoria's Secret credit card (Yes, I have a VS credit card, a gold one as a matter of fact, what of it?). So there's another 50 bucks a month saved. And apparently some time two years ago I singed up for Credit Protection on my credit card... you know that thing where the credit card company calls you promising to waive your monthly payments if you lose your job or become disabled all for a very reasonable monthtly fee. Well, given my overly high balance (thanks entirely to that wonderful thing called fourteen months of unemployment!!!) my reasonable monthly payment was about 60 bucks. So I quickly canceled that (don't ask why it took me two years to realize I even had it!). So all in all today I managed to save myself about $160 a month. Now that is a productive day! (Now if only I can find a way to save myself another $700 a month perhaps I can finally move into my own place). :)  So Kerry and Bush are still neck and neck in the polls. I wonder often about the stupidity of a country where half the people are supportive of the W. Now of course, if you remove Ralph Nader from the race all of a sudden Kerry as a commanding lead. Nader must be in the pay of Bush. He knows he can't win. He knows all he can accomplish is to take votes away from Kerry. The Green Party wouldnâ€™t endorse him. All of his old advisers have told him not to run. He's having trouble even getting on the ballots. So unless his goal is to take enough votes from Kerry so that Bush will win, I can't see one reason why he would join this election. I have a very bad feeling that Bush is going to win all thanks to Nader. And let me tell you if he wins again, I'm fleeing to Canada!!   In other news,  urlLink Microsoft has patented "Borg" technology.  I'll talk more about that tomorrow. In the mean time, it's time for me to spend some quality time with my videogames. :)

      Well, I can forget about getting my motorcycle license. I had to ask my dad about my birth certificate since I couldn't find it. When I told him what I needed it for he essentially told me in no uncertain terms that I can forget about it... as long as I live in this house I'm not bringing a motorcycle here. Fuck. Now I'm angry.   I really need to get out of here. Unfortunately, I own a car.. and up here in the Jersey City area of NJ if you're on one salary (less then about $50k) you can either afford a car or your own place, but not both. So I'm pretty much stuck here unless one of three things happens 1) I get married. 2) I break down and get a roommate. 3) I move to a different state.   Ideally I would like to do both one and three. No luck so far on either, but I'll keep trying. :)

      Ugh. A very unproductive day it was. I called AG Edwards as soon as I got out of work today. Unfortunately, by the time I got home they were already closed. I don't know when I'm going to find time to call them. My lunch "hour" is only a half an hour, fifteen minutes of which are wasted just leaving and reentering the building, so I have no time there. I'll have to think of something. I'm scheduled for my motorcycle test on Labor Day weekend, now I just need to get the permit so I can take the written test. However, New Jersey just adopted new rules for proving identity when you try to get a new license. You have to provide your birth certificate, drivers license, utility bill, social security card, and bank statement (or other official document). Driver's license and social security card are easy. But I have no idea where my birth certificate is and I do all of my bill pay online so I don't get any physical paper bills or statements in the mail (and they don't accept computer printouts). So I'm not sure how I'm gonna handle this.   In other news I'm going to a John Kerry volunteer's party on July 17th and a gathering of NYC Atheists on July 11th. Finally, I can be around people who think like me! LOL. And perhaps I can even meet a nice woman at one of these events (okay.. now I'm just dreaming).   On to more interesting matters! Andi said something interesting in her "Fahrenheit doesn't reach my boiling point" post (nice title, by the way!). She said that she refuses to give up her idealism, her belief that piece is possible, and that one day we can learn to stop killing each other (or at least stop killing each other over oil). Though this tends to be rare, in this case I have to disagree. Peace is not possible; we can never learn to stop killing each other.   "Why such a pessimistic outlook?" You may ask. It's simply basic human nature. We are an aggressive and violent species... we evolved from hunters, we learned to fight to protect our kills; our mates; our territories. We set up our societies, not as unified groups of people who cooperated with one another for a common good, but as competitive structures divided into nobility and peasants, rich and poor, citizens and slaves, haves and have nots. We learned to compete with one another to become a "have." It would never occur to most people that perhaps if we work together then everyone can be a "have." No, in order to be a "have" someone else must be a "have not."   Why is it like this? Why do we allow a society that is sharply divided along every imaginable line? Simply because  society cannot function without such divides!  We live in a capitalist society, a capitalist society functions on competition. In order for our system to work there must be poor, their must be disadvantaged people. Without them the system falls apart. Consider this... ten million dollars is a lot of money. But why is a lot of money? Because very few people have ten million dollars! If every single person had ten million then ten million wouln't be worth very much anymore. We always need to compare ourselves to something, to quantify how we are better, this is the essence of competition. When a religious organization pressed on why god allows evil in the world, one of the standard responses is "Without evil, how can we recognize good?"  By the same token, without the poor how can we recognize the rich? Without the ignorant how can we recognize the intelligent? Without the have-nots, how can we recognize the haves?   We can't. We need the opposites. The act of comparing oneself to his fellow man is at the very core of our society, it is the heart of a society built around competition. And as long as we have a society based on competition we will always have those divides. As long as their are divides there will be conflict. With conflict comes the killing, the wars, the oppression.   And just as the people within a society must compete with each other to function, so must a society itself compete with other societies in order to survive. An empire must expand in order to survive. A society has to always look outward, to compete with other societies, to give the populace a common enemy. If a society stops competing, stops tying to expand, it stagnates and eventually dies. Look at every great empire throughout history. As long as they were expanding they were prosperous. As soon as their expansion stopped, they fell. Today we don't expand with armies across territory (at least not that often), today we do it with money. We expand our economy, push into rival markets.. always trying to find new sources of profit. The expansion of American businesses, and with the businesses, American culture, into other lands has created huge backlashes of anti-american sentiment. Thus, more conflict; more killing.   So, is true and lasting peace possible? No! Can there ever be a stop to the violence? No! As long as we have a society based on competition, there will never be peace and there will always be violence because such things are integral components of a competitive society. The answer is then to alter society. But such a solution is impractical. Consider socialism for a moment. There we have a societal system built completely on cooperation, where there are no haves or have-nots but rather a fair middle ground for all people. But socialists are ridiculed and ignored at best, hated and feared at worst. We thrive on competition, the idea of cooperation is alien to us. At my core I consider myself a socialist... I think that is the only path that can bring down the divides that separate us and bring about the best chance for real peace. I hate the competitive nature of society. I hate the conflict.. the divides. But I also realize that nothing is going to change it. Basic human nature is competitive... and we as a race haven't been able to move beyond basic human nature in all of our history.   What are the odds that we're going to start now?   And I'm done! LOL. I don't feel like I did a good enough job presenting my arguments convincingly. It's been five years since I've written any kind of political or social commentary, so I'm a little bit rusty. :) I'll get better, I promise!   I welcome comments! Please, post your thoughts, your counter arguments, tell me how wrong I am, give me your ideas on how society can start to move from competition to cooperation!   Goodnight all!

      Hey everyone (assuming anyone is actually reading this)! After reading my best friend Andrea's blog for the past few months (her blog can be found  urlLink here ) I've decided it's my turn to give this whole blogging thing a go.   You know what I realized today as I was sitting in work, bored out of my mind as is the norm for a Sunday? I don't know who I am anymore. I mean that seriously. I remember a little more then five years ago I was a different person... a stronger, better person. Back in the day I was tremendously active politically. I was forever volunteering for someone's campaign. Hell, I remember working on Clinton's first presidential campaign when I was 13! Me and a group of volunteers went door to door on election day encouraging people to get out and vote. Later that night we all went to a local hall that we had rented to watch the election results come in. It was great fun and really made me feel good about myself. After that I was always involved in one way or another, always going to rallies and meetings, always doing public speaking engagements (I love public speaking, it's such a tremendous rush to be in front of hundreds of people and see the way they respond to you and what you're saying). I joined the American Atheist organization and quickly became the Youth Outreach Director. One of my proudest moments was speaking at their 25th annual convention.  urlLink Here's  a link to my appearance there. I met with politicians, went on radio shows, appeared on television. But when was the last time I did anything like that? When was the last time I attended a rally, or got into a good debate, or appeared on some public access television show, or wrote some scathing political commentary, or just plain old cared?   And herein lies the problem. Once I got involved with my most recent ex five years ago I slowly gave it all up. First to go was American Atheists, my involvement in the organization bothered her (mind you, she is not religious in the slightest). So I gave it up, for her. She hates politics and current events, hates hearing about them or discussing them, so I stopped talking politics and following current events.. for her. I gave up all the little things I always wanted to do... like get my motorcycle license because it bothered her. Essentially I let the core of who I am/was die... all in a massive and ultimately futile attempt to make her happy.   So here I am, five years later, a fundamentally weaker person. I've ignored by deeply held convictions and beliefs, I gave up some of the things I enjoyed the most, I passed up several opportunities to move out of this horrible state of New Jersey, all in the name of making someone  else  happy.   Fortunately for me through all this time I've had the support of the greatest person anyone could ever hope to know. Since I met her seven years ago Andrea has always been there for me. Even though I don't get to talk to her often, and see her even less (the 700 miles between us is a killer) she has been the best friend that I have ever had. Through all the friends that have come and gone in my life no one has ever been there for me, or been as supportive and understanding, as she has. There is no one in my life that I feel closer to, or care for, more then her. So Andrea, from the bottom of my heart I thank you for always being there for me no matter what.   Okay, enough with the sentimentality already! It's time to reclaim all those things about myself that I've lost over the past five years! So here is what I'm doing: I've volunteered for the Kerry campaign, it's time to get that stupid bastard out of the White House before he kills any more kids! I'm rejoining American Atheists. I've scheduled to take my test for my motorcycle license (on Labor Day weekend, that was the first available slot). I'm actively looking for work down in Lexington. I have to call the Lexington branch of AG Edwards tomorrow to ask about a job they had posted. It's time to get involved again! So you will be seeing a lot of my writings on the political/social issue of the day, you'll be seeing my name in the op-ed pages, hearing me on the radio call in shows (well, at least if you live in Jersey you will). I am going to recapture some of that fire I had back in the day!  That about does it for me. It's been fun! 'Till next entry, goodnight.

      Good evening everyone! I am here! In the Promised Land! Okay, perhaps Lexington isn't the Promised Land; I might be exaggerating a bit there. Actually, no I'm not! I paid $20 for a carton of cigarettes!! $20!!! FOR A FULL CARTON!!!!! If that's not undeniable proof that this is the Promised Land then I don't know what is! Oh, for my Southern readers who donâ€™t understand why Iâ€™m so excited about that, a carton of smokes in Jersey costs almost 70 bucks.   First things first. I am extremely tired. Long drive. So if I make no sense or ramble on worse then usual or forget to spell check I'm sorry.   So I drove to Lexington today. Obviously. What a crazy drive it was. It was like as soon as I crossed the New Jersey border I was in a different world. I drove through Maryland up and down and through this mountain. It was absolutely beautiful! I'll admit though I was extremely nervous driving through the mountain. I mean, I'm from Jersey! I know all about driving through refineries and waste disposal sites and ghettos but what the hell do I know about driving through mountains? So Maryland was beautiful. West Virginia and Kentucky, now those roads are built for speed! I-64 is such a great road, nice and straight with not a cop in sight. After being slowed down a lot by the mountain and a lot of rain once I got to that road I was able to open up. I was able to do the last 115 miles in just a few minutes over an hour (do the math to figure out how fast I was going). It was great!   So in the end the ride was long, very tiring, but really nice. It's amazing how different everything is from state to state. It's also amazing just how big this country really is. I would love to take a real cross-country road trip just to see what's out there. It's a beautiful country and there must be so much to see that I haven't even imagined.   So I made it here with no problem. I love starting sentences with "so" I've noticed this. The area Andrea lives in is freakin gorgeous!! Andrea herself is every bit as amazing as I remember. Didn't really do anything tonight. Went to the store where I bought A FULL CARTON OF CIGARETTS FOR 20 BUCKS!!! Then sat outside with Andrea for a few hours having a fairly deep conversation about society. I will defiantly blog about some of the issues we talked about when I'm more awake. Tomorrow I'll be meeting some of her friends. I can't wait.&nbsp;Wish I didn't have to leave at the end of the week. Oh, well. One day I will be able to move down here or at least someplace in the general vicinity like Ohio.   Tomorrow we're going to music in the park. Sounds good to me. During the day I plan on playing my XBox (which I of course brought with me. :) ) I just got Sudeki which is an awesome new RPG. I also brought Halo with me and would defiantly be interested in getting a game on with somebody. Ogre perhaps? :)   I also found out that tomorrow the complete "V" television show is being released on DVD. The television show was a short-lived series (only one season) that picked up events right where the movie left off. I've never seen the TV show before so I've got to get that sometime during the week.   Okay. I need some sleep. I'm exhausted. I don't understand why though. All I did was drive. Why is driving so tiring? All you're doing is sitting on your ass.   To all my Jersey friends, I have one thing to say to you all. ESCAPE!!!!! ESCAPE NOW WHILE YOU STILL CAN!!!! THERE ARE SO MANY BETTER PLACES OUT THERE!!!! RUN!!! RUN FOR YOUR LIVES!!!!!   Bedtime. But first I'll have one more cigarette. The cigarettes that only cost me 20 bucks for a carton!!! :)  Night all!&nbsp;

      Good morning! I meant to blog yesterday, but was just too tired by the time I got home. Brandon and I went out yesterday in an attempt to go see "The Bourne Supremacy" and do some last minute clothes shopping for me so I would have enough clothes to go away with.&nbsp; Unfortunately the weather conspired against us. It rained horribly and by the time we go close to the mall in Upstate New York where we were heading, all the roads were washed out. We got stuck behind several floods, police roadblocks, insane drivers. We never got to the mall, all approaches were completely flooded. So we wound up driving around for four hours trying to find a non flooded road to take us home. Needless to say I didn't get any shopping done and we didn't see our movie. You know, after driving in circles for four hours yesterday I realize how bad driving ten hours to Kentucky on Monday is going to be. Especially since I do not believe in stopping. But I have no doubt that ten hours of torture will be well worth it. :)   In other news I mentioned previously that I had been walking whenever possible in an attempt to lose weight. Well, it was working nicely. Then I decided that I should complete the new healthy image I was going for by quitting smoking (shut up Brandon!!). So I stopped smoking. Everything you've ever heard about your metabolism dropping when you quit smoking is absolutely true!! Within two days of quitting smoking I had put back on almost all the weight I had lost. The following day I walked right into the corner store and bought a pack of cigarettes! That's the last time I quit smoking while attempting to lose weight!   I think we finally have a solution to the whole issue of what women are attracted to. The answer it seems is confidence. Women are attracted to a man who exhibits a lot of confidence. And the reason it seems as though women are attracted to the bad&nbsp;boys is simply because the bad boys tend to exhibit more confidence then the good guys. I can live with that explanation. It means that I donâ€™t have to change my approach or become the kind of guy I hate to get women; it just means I need to work on developing more confidence. Since Natalia and I broke up confidence has been my weakness. But I know what the problem is so I should be able to fix it.   That's it for today. I need to go and do that shopping now. One more day until I leave!!!!&nbsp;

      Good evening. Not much of a post tonight. Spent the day watching "V" which is my all time favorite movie. 7 hours and 45 minutes of pure sci-fi goodness!  &nbsp;  Nothing much going on in the political world. Things have been pretty quiet prior to the Democratic National Convention next week. Things should start to get interesting again after that. Hopefully we can all do something for the DNC next week, I think that'd be a lot of fun.  &nbsp;  Speaking of next week I just realized I have a small problem. After working in jobs with dress codes for so long, I don't have enough regular clothes to last a week! LOL. I'll have to do some clothes shopping over the weekend before I head on down there.  &nbsp;  That's it for today. I'm off to bed at a decent hour! Goodnight all!

       Good evening everybody! I've been having some interesting discussions today that came out of yesterday's post. I spoke to several people today that I work with to get their perspectives on if women really do prefer bastards and if so why.  &nbsp;  The consensus is yes. Women, nearly all women, prefer bastards and are not attracted at all to the nice guy. As one woman put it to me, in the tri-state area (that's New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut for anyone who might not have known) the overwhelming majority, if not all, women are only attracted to the bastards. To find a place where women are attracted to nice guys I'd have to go down south according to this woman (whose family is from North Carolina).&nbsp;Though  urlLink Ogre  reports that the situation in Lexington isn't really any different. So I don't know who to believe on that score. But at the very least it's been established beyond any doubt that women in my area are attracted to bastards and only bastards.  &nbsp;  Which leaves the important question "Why?" I got a couple of different answers on this one. One person told me it's because women love the challenge of trying to take a guy who is a bastard and changing him into a good guy. If the guy is already a good guy then there is no challenge. No challenge = no interest. Someone else told me that women are&nbsp;conditioned by society/bad experiences to believe that there is nothing else but the bad guys. Another explanation I got was that women equate niceness with weakness. So a good guy is perceived to be a weak guy.  &nbsp;  I also got several suggestions on how I could change my approach for better results. One of the more interesting came from a woman. According to her I should do things such as if I tell a woman I'm going call her tomorrow I shouldn't. Instead I should call her a few days after I said I was going to call. Other's suggested I should act distant, indifferent, like I don't care. Something like if a woman asks me how a particular dress looks on her, instead of responding with how I really feel like "Wow, you look beautiful/sexy/incredible/etc." I should shrug my shoulders indifferently and say casually: "Yeah, fine, whatever." The idea is I turn it into a game; I'm not really interested so you're going to have to chase me and make me interested. In other words, make the woman work for my interest, make it a challenge. I also got the suggestion that the problem isn't that women like the bastards; the problem is that I'm simply setting my sights too high. The last two girls I tried to date were very attractive and therefore out of my league.&nbsp; I need to set my sights lower if I want to have any success (this other person's words, not mine).  &nbsp;  So there you have it, this is the information that I came across today. Considering I do not have it in me to be the bastard that is so desired in this area (and perhaps the rest of the country) things do not look to bright for me on the relationship front. Unless I want another psycho. According to another woman I spoke to today, good girls go after the bad guys but the bad girls go after the good guys. Considering the string of relationships I've had that Andrea outlined there does seem to be some truth to that statement.  &nbsp;  Okay, moving on to the real topic I wanted to discuss today, "I, Robot." Warning for those who have not yet seen the movie this post will contain spoilers. (I always wondered why knowing what was going to happen in a movie was called a spoiler. To me it doesn't spoil anything, it makes it better. If I already know what's going to happen in a movie then I can fully focus and enjoy what is going on at the moment instead of constantly wondering what's going to happen next. But that's just me and I'm just strange. LOL)  &nbsp;  If you didn't know, "I, Robot" is based on the work of Isaac Asimov (my favorite sci-fi author). Asimov envisioned a world full of robots that all had to obey certain laws that were hardwired into their positronic brains. The laws are as follows:&nbsp; &nbsp;  1. A Robot may not harm a human or through inaction allow a human to come to harm.   2. A Robot must obey all orders given it by a human except where such orders violate the first law.   3. A Robot must protect its own existence except where such protection would violate the first or second laws.   The book, "I, Robot," deals with the original development of the robot and traces its development from the time when robots were a novelty to the time when robots were part of every aspect of our lives. The book ends the same way the movie does; robots evolve to the point where they realize that there must be something above the First Law. That to truly protect humans the robots must rule the humans. So in both the book and movie there is a revolution where the robots, acting in the best interests of humanity, attempt to take over the world. Of course being a big budget summer film the movie's revolution is violent and action packed and eventually fails. Whereas the book's revolution is very slow and subtle and nonviolent and most of all, successful. The robots gradually take over more and more aspects of human life until they are in absolute control and the humans don't even realize it.  In a later book one of Asimov's robots, R. Daneel Olivaw, gives this principal a name. He called it the Zeroth Law. It reads:   0.&nbsp;A Robot may not harm humanity or through inaction allow humanity to come to harm.   The other laws are then modified to read like this:   1. A Robot may not harm a human or through inaction allow a human to come to harm, except where this would violate the Zeroth Law.   The other two laws are changed in a similar fashion.&nbsp;So under the new four laws a robot may harm a human if it is in the best interests of humanity as a whole.   Thinking about the laws makes me wonder what is so wrong with the robotic revolution described in Asimov's book? Or even in the movie? Think about it, a robot ruler would always act in the best interests of the people he rules. He can be corrupted, swayed by greed or the lust for power. He can not be bribed by a special interest group, or be tempted by the attractive intern. He will work tireless and nonstop always with the best interests of humanity as his ultimate and only goal. When drafting legislation the robot will not stop to think about how the legislation will affect his campaign contributors or worry about how it might affect his reelection chances. Can the same be said about any human leader? Any single one? No, I didn't think so. So again I ask the question: "What is so bad about a robotic revolution?" My answer is absolutely nothing. I say let's hurry up and invent the Asimovian robot! Hurry up and usher in the revolution!   You know, one of these days some of the things I say in my blog are going to cause the FBI to come knocking on my door. :)   Until tomorrow!&nbsp; &nbsp;

      ... and other such bullshit.  &nbsp;  Hey everyone. Sorry about the long gap in the blogging there. I was actually pretty busy this weekend. I saw "I, Robot" on Friday and Sunday (and will probably see it again sometime this week) and would really like to discuss it because the movie brings up some interesting questions. But I have more important things to talk about today.  &nbsp;  Warning: today's blog entry will be vulgar. If cursing bothers you then you may as well hit your browser's back button now. I am fuckin angry and if you can't vent properly in your own blog then where the hell else can you vent?  &nbsp;  I went out with Meridith on Saturday. I took her to a really nice restaurant here in Jersey called The Cheesecake Factory. So we go to dinner, we sit, we eat. We wound up having a really great conversation and losing all track of time. I got lost two times driving home 'cause we were still having this great conversation that I wasn't paying attention to where I was going. So basically I thought everything went great and that was the impression I got from her as well. My ability to read people apparently really fuckin sucks 'cause the next day I got a text message (a fuckin text message, mind you!!!)&nbsp; from her saying that she had a really great time and shit but only saw us as being friends.  &nbsp;  What the fuck?!?!  &nbsp;  Okay, before I go on let me make one thing clear. I'm not angry that Meridith turned out not to be interested in me. This was someone who was a blind date I don't really care that it didn't work out. Whatever. No, what is pissing me off is the pattern that is forming here. Prior to Meridith I went out once with a girl named Karen. Karen sent me an email the next day (better then a text message I suppose) saying that she wasn't interested. Again after what I thought was a really good date. So let's take a look at the pattern, shall we?  &nbsp;  Going back through my previous relationships or attempts at a relationship: Meridith was a bitch, Karen was a bitch, Natalia was just crazy, Laura was just... crazy, Heather was just... well... crazy, Saxon was... umm... crazy. You get the idea.  &nbsp;  So there comes a point where you have to stop and wonder is the problem really these women? Or am I the problem?  &nbsp;  The evidence seems to suggest that the problem is me. I was always taught... nah, fuck that, I wasn't taught shit... I've always believed there's a certain way you're supposed to treat a woman. You're supposed to love them, and respect them, and treat them like they're worth their weight in gold. I am a stereotypical "nice guy." The kind that women are forever saying they want.  &nbsp;  But the truth of the matter is they're all lying. Women don't want a "nice guy" that's not what they're attracted to. It's the "nice guys" who get told what great friends they are while the "bad boys" get taken to bed.  &nbsp;  My boss gave me a few books to read by this guy named David DeAngelo. This guy writes about attraction. In these books he essential makes the case, a scarily convincing case, that women are not attracted to nice men. In fact, they are turned off by nice men. We've all seen women who are with these horrible men who treat them like shit and if you're anything like me you've wondered why. Well DeAngelo argues that it is these "bad" characteristics that are attractive to women. So DeAngelo says that if you want to attract women you should be cocky, you should make fun of them, tease them about something they are insecure about, make fun of other people, etc.  &nbsp;  This approach is completely repulsive to me. But you know what completely disgusts me? This fuckin DeAngelo asshole appears to be right! Natalia always said I treated her better then anyone she's ever been with. But in the end she just wasn't attracted to me. Karen and Meridith both told me what a great guy I am, but in the end they just weren't attracted to me.  &nbsp;  So I'm angry. Angry because I'm sick of being told what a great guy I am and then seeing the same woman with a complete asshole. I'm angry because everything I ever believed about how a woman should be treated is wrong! Fuck! As much as don't want to accept it, the evidence is overwhelming. Women just don't like the nice guys, they like the bastards.  &nbsp;  So this is my lot in life. Either I change the way I treat women... become the type of guy that I hate so much, or live my life with all the female friends I could would, but no body who actually wants me.  &nbsp;  Sorry for the angry rant. I'll be back to my old self tomorrow with a commentary on "I, Robot." Have a good night. I need to go find a fucking drink.&nbsp; &nbsp;

      Nice... blogspot upgraded its post composition interface with all sorts of fancy stuff like colors, bullet points, numbered lists, and the ability to insert pictures. Very cool.  &nbsp;  I have been lax in my posting and for that I should be ashamed! I have a good excuse, though. About 8pm last night I was writing my post for the evening. I got about halfway though it when I got a call from Meridith, the girl from the nail salon. We stayed on the phone till sometime after midnight so by the time I got off the phone and ready for bed it was way too late to continue my blog. Sorry everyone!  &nbsp;  You know, it's funny, exactly what I said would happen has happened. I had finally decided to not actively seek a relationship and pretty much the instant I decided that Meridith first contacted me. So I have finally discovered the secret to finding a relationship... don't look for one! Not that this is much of a secret, people have been telling me this for a while and I just never believed them. So to those people I officially declare: you were right; I was wrong.  &nbsp;  Meridith and I had an incredible conversation last night; we didn't even realize how late it had gotten. Turns out that she shares my views on relationships 100%. Amazing! We're going to go out this Saturday. I'm really looking forward to it. I'm very excited about this person, it seems really promising. Of course I'll keep all my loyal readers (I think I'm up to four now) updated as things progress. :)  &nbsp;  On to the topic of the day: friendships. I was speaking to someone today who was talking about how stressed they feel, like there is never enough time for anything. Well, it seems that this person is constantly socializing; forever out with different friends. They have a huge circle of friends. Which makes me wonder, is having such a large circle of friends such a good thing?  &nbsp;  Myself I have always preferred a small circle of really close friends to a huge circle of acquaintances. My reasoning on this is simple, a friendship, like any other relationship, takes time and work to develop and maintain. You must make the time and effort to periodically contact the person, spend time with them, speak to them, or else the friend in question will slowly drift away. This is fairly easy to do with a small circle of friends, but what if you have a circle of 30 or 40 or 50 people? That's a huge time and effort investment to maintain that many relationships. With all the responsibilities people have these days, there's just not enough time in the day to maintain huge circles of friends. It's a recipe for a burnout. Your friends should be a source of joy in your life, not a second job. For me I think the perfect mix is one romantic relationship, two extremely close friends, and three or four acquaintances. There's enough people in that group to ensure that at least one of them will be available when you want to spend time with a friend, but small enough that you can focus on building and maintaining those relationships without stressing yourself.  &nbsp;  Just my two cents. :)  &nbsp;  No political commentary for today... the political world has been rather quiet lately. There was the whole issue of gay marriage in the Senate. To me that falls under the category of "Do not force your moral/religious views on other people through legislation" that I discussed in detail in a previous post. If you don't want to marry someone of the same sex, then don't. But don't take that right away from other people just because you have a moral or religious objection to their lifestyle choice.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Good night all!&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

      Not much of a post today. For some reason I am extremely tired. I don't know why exactly, I went to sleep last night at my regular time. I did have some very strange dreams last night, perhaps that has something to do with it.   In any event, that girl from my mother's nail salon that I've been mentioning (her name is Meridith, by the way) emailed me yesterday. We were emailing each other back and forth throughout the day today until she finally asked me if I would like to meet her. I was a bit shocked; I didn't expect her to want to meet me until after we had been talking for a while and gotten to know each other a bit. So she's a very forward person it would seem (which I like) and she was talking about how she's tired of meeting people who are just wasting time not looking to settle down (which I also like!). This seems promising. I'll of course update you all as this situation progresses.   Now... I'm going to bed... at 9:30 at night. Something is defiantly wrong with me. Perhaps I'm coming down with something. Oh, well. Better to come down with something now then on the day before I go to Kentucky.   Oh, Ogre, I'll bring the sixth season of Buffy with me when I come down so you can watch it.   Good night all!

      Good evening all! I meant to write this post much earlier. Unfortunately, I once again could not resist the call of Voyager. I completed the third season tonight. 26 episodes in three days, that must be some kind of record! Now begins the long wait until September when season four comes out. That's going to be torture. I have to wait until September for season four of Voyager and November for season seven of Buffy. I really need to find something else to collect in the mean time to keep me busy. Maybe Babylon 5, or Stargate SG-1, or perhaps Angel. Anyone have any suggestions?   I, Robot comes out this week! I can't wait (what else is new?); I've been waiting for that movie to come out forever. I'm a huge fan of Isaac Asimov and I've been dying for his work to be translated onto the big screen. I'm just worried that they're going to butcher the source material. But I'll have more on that after I actually see the movie.   Remember last week sometime I told you all that my mom was playing matchmaker and trying to set me up with a woman who goes to the same nail place that she does? Well, the girl actually contacted me. She sent an email earlier in the day, just a basic introduction nothing serious. Still, I'm very surprised. I wasn't expecting to hear from her. I mean, how strange must that have sounded to her? Imagine the owner of the nail place going up to this girl and saying: "One of my clients thinks that you and her son should get together. Here's his information; you should contact him." So I'll email this girl back and see what happens. I'm not going to get my hopes up, though.   Okay, moving along to the issue of the day (actually, I think it's more of the issue of the past week). I agree with almost everything Andrea said in her last post. But I think she asked the wrong question. If you're asking is being married essential to being happy in life then I would tend to agree with the majority and answer "no, it is not." Marriage as an institution means different things to different people. To some it is a tenant of their faith, a sacred duty to be performed. To others itâ€™s an obligation. Some just do it because it's fashionable (read: Hollywood stars). Some do it because itâ€™s financially advantageous. Others feel it is the ultimate statement of their love for their partner, a requirement for having children, a way out of their parent's house, a ticket to a better life, something that gets in the way of great sex (thanks to Andrea for that reason)... the list goes on and on. So is the institution of marriage essential for happiness in life? No, I don't think so. I personally value marriage for the above stated reason "it is the ultimate statement of their love for their partner." However, if I was with the right person I could certainly envision delaying marriage or not getting married at all and still being happy. I like the idea of marriage for the implied commitment. To me a marriage is a more serious, more committed situation then just a regular relationship. However, given the state of today's society with our disposable marriages, perhaps my views on this subject are simply outdated. It's that feeling of commitment that I'm really after, knowing that this person is going to be there when I go to sleep and still be there when I wake up in the morning. If I can have that without the title of husband and wife then I can be perfectly happy.   I think instead of asking "if you're not married could you be happy" the proper question should have been "could you be happy if you are single for the rest of your life?" The answer to that question, I believe, is a resounding "No!"   Everything Andrea said about relationships and their pitfalls is absolutely correct. In the wrong relationship (which is pretty much all of my past relationships) it is very easy to lose part of yourself in a futile effort to make the other person happy and give them whatever it is they believe they need. I've been there and done that, read my inaugural post for a full description. I lost entire chunks of myself and came out of the relationship less then a complete person (probably about an eight of a person I'd estimate). The wrong relationship can be devastating to you as a person and if you go into a relationship looking for someone to fill in the pieces of who you are then that's just a recipe for misery. I've learned that lesson. It took way longer then it should have, but I think I've finally learned it.   Am I a complete person today? Yes. It took a lot of work over the past several months but I'm finally there. I have my own interests and beliefs, my own friends and activities I participate in outside and completely separate from any relationship. I know who I am and what I want in life. I feel better and stronger then I have in a very long time. I have a determination to never again let a bad relationship strip any of that from me.   So does that mean I'm happy being single? No way! Absolutely not! Under no circumstances! Can I survive and deal with being single? Certainly. I sure as hell don't like it though.   I believe firmly that a good romantic relationship is critical for a happy life. I also believe that good friendships are critical for a happy life. Now again everyone is different. Some people need a huge circle of friends and associates in order to be happy, other people are just as happy with a very small circle of really close friends. Some people need to be with their partner every possible second to be happy, others are happy just being with their partner once or twice a week. (Myself personally, I am firmly on the quality over quantity side, I prefer a small circle of two or three really close friends and like Andrea said, I'd rather spend one good day a week with my partner then five bad days.) So not everybody has the same need for relationships, some people can go a long time between relationships, others can't. But I do not believe that anyone, no matter where they are on the quality/quantity fence, can be happy with a 100% absence of either type of relationship. If I were to say that you could be happy without any friends at all for the rest of your life everyone would respond with "That's crazy! You need good friends!" And they'd be right. We need our friends. We also need our relationships. That type of relationship is every bit as important as our friendships. To be truly happy we need a good balance between them. Too much weight in either direction is unhealthy. If you focus too much on your relationship to the detriment of your friendships you will be lost if that relationship should end. So youâ€™ll probably wind up spending all of your energy to maintain a bad relationship, at the cost of your identity, because it is all that you have. Conversely, if you focus solely on friendships and ignore romantic relationships you are missing out on the level of intimacy and closeness that only a romantic relationship can bring. We cannot be happy on friends alone and we cannot be happy on relationships alone. At least not for our entire lives.   I've met people who had been single for most, if not all, of their lives. I've never met a happy one. I know a woman who is in her late seventies, early eighties. When she was seventeen her fiancÃ©e was killed in World War II. She never remarried, never even had a relationship after his death. She likes to brag that she's the world's oldest living virgin. She seems cheerful and happy but if you talk to her for a little bit you quickly realize that she never left the 1940s. She never talks about her life after the war; all she talks about is that time period, the time when she was with him. Her life since then has been miserable, it is only the memory of the happiness she once had that keeps her going.   I've talked before about my old college professor who never wanted a serious relationship and thought he was perfectly happy until it suddenly hit him just how lonely it really was.   In my experience that's how it always plays out. The people I've known have thought they were happy, thought everything was great. They were free, they were having fun; they were doing the things they wanted to do. Then one day it hit them just how lonely they were. It hit some people I know when they were in their twenties. It didn't hit other people I know until they were in their forties. But it hit them all eventually.   Basically, my bottom line is that both friends and relationships are needed for a happy life. A balance must be found between the two. And, though I never actually addressed this topic in the interests of having just an insanely long post as opposed to a ridiculously nightmarish post, itâ€™s also extremely important to find the person who will respect you for you and allow you to be yourself. Okay, that's it, I'm done. I swear tomorrow I will return with my political commentary!   Goodnight all!

      Hmm... no post since Thursday. I have defiantly been slacking! In my defense, I bought Season 3 of Star Trek Voyager on Friday and have been completely consumed by that ever since. In two days I'm already half way through the season. Which really sucks since the fourth season isn't coming out until September. I tend to hate the summer, all television shows are in reruns, no major video games are released, and the only bright spot is the summer is when the biggest movies come out. Why can't networks and companies maintain a consistent release schedule all year round? Why do we have to have three months of dead time?   Fox networks experimented this year with introducing new shows during the summer, that experiment failed miserably. Reruns were attracting much larger audiences then the new material. Fox executives say that viewers are simply conditioned to expect new material in September and January only and automatically resist any change to what they have come to expect.   We seem to be "conditioned" to accept a great many things. New shows will premier in September, we watch reruns in the summer, competition is good, cooperation is bad, anything that feels good must be wrong and we should feel guilty about it (at least if you're catholic). Remember after 9/11 when we came to the conclusion that the information needed to prevent the attacks was there, just spread out amount different agencies. Every agency had a different piece of the puzzle that if put together might have given us the information needed to prevent the attacks but it didn't happen because the agencies didn't cooperate with each other. Instead they competed over who was the best, who had juristidiction over what. They had to be forced to increase interagency cooperation after the attacks.   The other day I was explaining to a friend of mine why socialism is a better alternative then capitalism. I made the case that given that 95% of this countries wealth is concentrated in the hands of 5% of the population a redistribution of wealth would directly benefit 95% of the population which includes people like you, me, and the person I was making this argument to. He thinks about it for a moment and realizes that I'm correct. A second later his societal conditioned sense of competition kicks in and he objects, saying that he doesn't want everyone else to be getting the same amount as him. So he recognized the benefit but rejected it because it did not conform to his American sense of competition.   This is what I've been talking about in previous posts. As long as the American attitude doesn't change the world will never change. Unfortunately, I am at a complete loss as to how we can go about breaking generations of social conditioning an thousands of years of human nature. Perhaps what we really need to do is gather together all like thinking individuals and leave to go colonize our own world! Seriously though, if anyone has any ideas on how we can change please let me know because I'm not coming up with anything.   It's funny the things I wind up talking about. I had intended this entry to be a single quick paragraph complaining about the lack of good quality summer entertainment followed by some more on the relationship topic and instead I've written a five paragraph dissertation on American society. It seems that blog entries, like life, rarely turn out the way you think they will.    On that topic, I've been thinking more about the way life has turned out. Andrea's latest post got me thinking of my past string of loser relationships. They have been pretty bad. I've had mentally unstable women, women who were secretly lesbian, women who were just using me, women who had no concept of the term "faithful". Imagine any kind of bad relationship that you can and odds are I've experienced it at least once, probably twice. The one relationship that I have always wanted I've never had and it's virtually impossible that I never will (I probably have a better chance of winning the lottery.... four times in a row. But given the unpredictable way that life works.. hey, you never know). All very discouraging.   But you can't let yourself be held back by "what ifs," or regrets. No matter what, life moves on. That's the funny thing about life; it wouldnâ€™t wait up for you. You either keep moving forward or get left behind. Just because life didn't turn out the way you wanted it to, or you're not with the person you really want to be with, it doesn't automatically mean that your life has to be miserable. There is good to be found in every situation if you just look for it. Yes I am single and lonely, but at least I'm no longer in a bad relationship. As Andrea pointed out, I could have wound up married to that woman and that would have been far worse then some loneliness.   No matter what the situation, you have to find the positive in it and use that to allow yourself to continue to move forward. Happiness is out there but you'll never obtain it if you allow yourself to be trapped in the past by your regrets and disappointments.   I'm honestly not sure what point I'm trying to make here or why I'm even talking about this stuff. I'm guess I'm kind of just rambling on here, saying whatever comes to mind. In any event, I'll stop now.   See you all tomorrow!

      Good evening all! I still wish I knew exactly how many people constitute "all." I wish blogspot would include a counter that would tell you how many separate people viewed your blog. That way I'd know whether I'm just talking to Andrea and Brandon, or if I've actually managed to attract a wider audience.   I was reading  urlLink Ogre  and  urlLink Andrea's  blogs and found myself agreeing with Ogre. I also tend to look at my life and say "This isn't right... this isn't how it was supposed to be!" I always imagined life differently when I was younger. From the time I was around 12 I knew exactly what my life would look like when I was 25 and that vision never changed, not once, until it all fell apart. I was going to go to college and study theoretical physics, I would never again set foot in New Jersey, I would be married by 21 at the very latest, by the time I was the age am I now I would either have or be just completing my doctorate in physics and be preparing to join the faculty of some great research university. I knew that this is what was going to happen with as much certainty as I know the sun will rise in the east.   But as you all know, that's not what happened. I went to college out of state to study physics exactly like I was supposed to. But everything fell apart from there. There was no doctorate, no wife, no research university waiting for me. So here I am at 26, living in New Jersey with my parents, single, and working in the financial industry. Finance! I'm a socialist for christ's sake! What the hell am I doing in finance?   So whatever I thought was going to happen in my life, the exact opposite is what really happened. That's very distressing to me. But I can't honestly call my life bad. Though I don't have the career I wanted, I am at least gainfully employed. Too many people aren't. I live with my parents who I do not get along with, but at least they are still willing to house me (considering I can't afford to live on my own in this overly expensive state). I have a good circle of friends (Andrea and Brandon, I am speaking primarily to you). So my life, though not what I had hopped for, is not all that bad. I think Andrea's got it right: the best we can hope for in life is to muddle through it and hope we can manage not to bungle it.  Still, out of all the good things in my life (and the bad as well) there is still one major thing missing: someone to share it with. As evidenced by the fact that I wanted to be married by no later then 21, I place extreme value on relationships. To me life is not worth living if you have to live it alone. I feel that without someone we are fundamentally incomplete as human beings. It's been argued to me that you are not really alone if you have good friends and family, but I disagree. Friends and family are extremely important without a doubt.  But  a relationship with a friend/family member and a romantic relationship are fundamentally different (I'm using the word fundamentally a lot tonight). Both are needed and one cannot replace the other.   Well, I went on with that for longer then I had anticipated. Bottom line: life rarely plays out the way you anticipate. But just because things aren't the way you wanted them to be doesn't mean you life can't still be good. You just have to learn to make the best out of whatever life hands you. But life is still incomplete without  both  close friends/family and a real relationship. Damn, I still haven't gotten to the main topic I wanted to discuss tonight. Sorry guys, you're in for a long post! (What else is new?)  Brandon and I were talking today about the presidential election, as we usually do, and he mentioned to me that Edwards had made a comment joking around about how the democrats had better hair then the republicans (so true, just look a Cheney!). He was complaining how issues like looks affect presidential campaigns. That brought to mind my belief that our entire electoral system needs to be changed.   Right now people vote for president for the most trivial of reasons. I've seen people vote for Clinton because he was cute, people who voted for Bush because Gore was boring, people who voted for a candidate on the basis of one policy initiative without any comprehension of how they would accomplish this initiative or what the other candidate had to say on the same issue.   This is just wrong. The President of the United States is the single most important job in the country and electing that president is one of our greatest responsibilities. This is the man (or woman one day, hopefully) that has to represent the American people and their interests to foreign governments, ally and enemy alike. This is the man who has at his command the most devastating and lethal armed force the world has ever seen. This is the man who, with the approval of just one other person, can press the big red button and end the world. The job is too big and carries to much responsibility for us to cast our vote for trivial reasons or without a complete understanding of the issues at hand.   My proposal is simple. Voting should be a privilege, not a right. We must instate poll tests immediately! If someone wants to vote they must first pass a test designed to test their knowledge on the candidates,  both  candidates, and the issues. Only if the applicant can demonstrate that they truly understand the issues and the platforms should they be allowed to vote. I don't care about anything else other then knowledge of the issues. Anyone over the age of 18 should be able to take the test regardless of race, gender, political belief, religious belief, sexual orientation, etc. If you can't read you should be able to take the test verbally. If you can't speak English you should be able to take the test in the foreign language of your choice. I do not want to appear discriminatory in any way shape or form. Voting is a privilege open to all American citizens  if and only if  you know enough to be able to vote responsibly.   Seriously though, the idea that voting is open to all people regardless is crazy! We make people take qualifying tests for a driverâ€™s license. Why? Because an unqualified driver can hurt or kill a lot of people. Well, by the same token an unqualified voter can elect someone that will get our troops killed for no good reason or destroy the economy. But for some reason weâ€™ll let anybody vote but test drivers. I donâ€™t get it.    It's sad to say, but the average American simply cannot be trusted with responsibility. Most people would rather hear about the latest Hollywood sex scandal then what's going on in the world. And these are the people who right now are being trusted to choose our president.   Scary!

      I love John Kerry. It's that simple.   Here's a nice short early morning post for all of you. I'll probably be back later on tonight with my usual long winded ramblings. But in the mean time I want to talk briefly about John Kerry.  Kerry earned tremendous respect from me the other day. When he was pressed about his position on abortion he clarified it by saying that as a devout catholic he believed that life beings at conception and abortion was morally wrong. However, he went on to say that he will not attempt to draft or pass any legislation banning abortion because, as he said, we have separation of church and state and he will not force his religious beliefs on the protestants, Jews, Muslims, and atheists (his words). So this man has deeply felt religious convictions but he will not attempt to force those beliefs on everyone else through legislation.   Now compare that to Bush whose religious belief forms the backbone of his legislation and policy decisions (as I discussed in a previous post).    As I've argued before, there is nothing wrong with holding religious beliefs. We are a free country, believe what you want to. But it is wrong to try to force those beliefs on other people. It is even worse to use your position to try to legislate your religious beliefs.   Finally we have a candidate who understands and respects the concept of separation of church and state.  It's about damn time!!    urlLink Kerry/Edwards '04!!!

      Hello everyone! Welcome to the return of The Misanthrope's Sanctuary's political and social commentary! Today we're going to discuss every Texas president named Bush's favorite subject: oil. Andrea once said that she hopes one day to see a world where people don't kill each other over oil. Unfortunately, the way I see it the oil related killing has barely gotten started. I'm talking about the Third World War. I am predicting World War III will kick off sometime around 2050. Here's why:  We are running out of oil.   An alarmist statement to be sure, but there is evidence to support my position. We are heading for what L B Magoon calls "The Big Rollover." Put simply the Big Rollover is when demand starts to outstrip supply; production beings to fall off as existing wells run dry and the discovery of new wells doesn't happen fast enough to replace the ones we lose. The Big Rollover will be preceded by regional rollovers, some of which have already happened. The US and Canadian rollover took place in 1970. That is when our production peaked. Demand outstripped supply leading to the infamous gas lines of 1973 (which I wasn't alive to see, but my parents talk about frequently). At that point we began to rely more heavily on foreign sources of oil, particular Middle Eastern oil. US production has been slowly dropping ever since the peak in 1970 as fewer new wells are opened and existing ones dry up. The former Soviet Union experienced its rollover around 1985; its production has been steadily dropping since then. The UK rolled over around 1999. So now Russia, along with the US, is almost totally dependant on foreign oil. The US imports 58% of its oil, mostly from the Middle East and uses a whopping 26% of the total world oil supply.   So all the major oil producing countries with the exception of the Middle East has had their production peak and being to decline. What does that translate as? Total dependency on the Middle East! Is it any wonder then that our government goes out of its way to protect our oil interests in that region? The Middle East has not rolled over yet, but imagine what happens when it does? Already the signs are there. Most distressingly is the number of new wells opened. In the past five years we consumed 27 million barrels of oil a year, but the oil industry only discovered 3 million barrels a year in new fields. We are exhausting existing fields quicker then we're finding new ones at a rate of 9 to 1! And the volume of new oil discovered has been decreasing year by year!   So when is the Big Rollover coming? Many experts predict that the world production will peak and being to drop sometime between now and 2010 with complete depletion of the world's oil supply (except for whatever we and other countries have been stockpiling in strategic reserves) by the 2050s. We will run out of oil within our lifetimes! Now, in the interest of fairness and balance I will say that these are just projections that may not come to pass. It is entirely possible that tomorrow we will discover a new field with enough oil to last for the next five centuries. It's possible that ten years from now we will develop a technology to make 30 billion barrels of oil a year synthetically. It's possible, certainly. But can we afford to take that risk?   Let's consider what would happen in the world once we realize that the oil is running out. Consider that the economies of all the major Middle Eastern countries like Saudi Arabia, Iraq, and Iran are nearly 100% based on oil production. All of a sudden these countries will be staring into the face of complete and total economic destruction. And what will a desperate leader of a country facing annihilation do? What every desperate leader throughout history has done... go to war. Out of all the Middle Eastern countries Saudi Arabia is the only one who is stockpiling a reserve. They have set aside excess production capacity of about 3 million barrels a day. Their excess production will suddenly look like steak to a starving man in the eyes of the other Middle Eastern countries. So they will invade to secure the oil reserves for themselves. Now do you think America will sit still while our friends the Saudis get invaded? Nope! We will launch our own invasion to protect Saudi Arabia (under the guise of "protecting freedom and spreading democracy" I'm sure). What about Russia and China, who are every bit as dependant on Middle Eastern oil as we are? Are they going to sit back and watch the region go to hell, counting on the goodwill of the eventual victor to help them out? I don't think so! More invasions!! Soon, every country with even the slightest dependency on Middle Eastern oil (read: every first world nation) will be involved, trying to secure the last remaining oil for themselves. Ladies and Gentlemen, I give you World War III.   And what happens when the war is over (I would imagine that the war effort itself would exhaust whatever reserves we may have)? We and all other first world nations have an oil based economy. In other words we are looking at a global depression the likes of which will be unparalleled in all of human history. The world economy will completely collapse. This in turn will probably lead to another round of war as we fight over the remaining scraps of resources. It will truly be the dawn of a new dark age.   So is this incredibly bleak picture of the near future preventable? Yes it is!! First things first, in the short term we must do everything in our power to minimize our dependence of foreign oil. Now if that means drilling up the ANWAR then we drill the damn thing up! Protecting the future of our country must be more important then preserving a small section of some animal's natural habitat. Now of course this is only a temporary solution, designed to give us enough breathing room to create a permanent solution. We must invest aggressively in alternate fuels and power sources. The hybrid cars on the road today are a good first step but obviously not enough. We need a hydrogen based economy... fuel cell cars. We need new energy sources like wind power, or solar power, of fusion based power. Obviously any of these solutions will require a lot of research to develop so we'd better get started! Next, we have to deal with the problem of the US oil corporations resisting a more away from oil. We have to encourage them somehow to abandon oil. Perhaps some kind of massive tax penalty against any company not actively working to convert to a non-oil based economy? Now with our foreign dependency on oil reduced thanks to increased domestic production via the ANWAR and our big oil corporations spearheading the conversion to a non-oil based economy that gives us the opportunity to address the last major problem: the Middle Eastern countries. Regardless of what we do domestically, they still have an oil based economy. One that will start to crumble as we start reducing our oil consumption. We must actively invest in those countries in order to help them diversify their economies so when the last well pumps the last barrel they have something else to fall back upon aside from war.   If we do all of this we will enter the latter half of the 21st century with a stable middle east, no energy crisis, and a country that is not dependant on anyone else to support its way of life. Perhaps this will be the dawn of a new Golden Age for peace and prosperity throughout the world.   So there is hope for the future; a possibility that Andrea's vision may come to pass. But with people like Bush in the White House, and all other conservatives who act like the oil gravy train will never end, I think perhaps I should invest in a fallout shelter and a stockpile of canned food.   Well that's it for today! Hopefully we can elect a good liberal who has the stomach to stand up to the oil companies and wean this country off of the oil that will be our doom. If not then as L.B. Magoon said: "Hang out tight! If we don't recognize the problem soon and deal with it, it's going to be quite a ride!"  (Statistics taken from  urlLink "Are We Running Out of Oil" by L.B. Magoon )

      I am so excited! Kerry is going to be announcing is running mate any day now and people who are registered volunteers on John Kerry's website are going to find out ahead of anyone else who he has picked!   Speaking of finding things out early if there's one thing in the world that I can't stand (aside from thugs, playas, republicans, and religion) it's not knowing things. I hate being surprised by anything and I have absolutely no patience to wait to find out what's going to happen in a movie, or what I got for Christmas. I want to know everything and I want to know it now! My ex girlfriends all quickly learned that the absolute best way to torture me would be to tell me "I have something I want to tell/show/give you... but you're gonna have to wait until later!" I'd be going crazy for the rest of the day! LOL At my job I'm forever volunteering to under go training in different departments because it bothers me that I don't know every little detail of every last thing in the company. I hate when a customer asks me a question and I have to say "I don't know, let me go find out." I feel like I should know and the fact that I don't is a personal failing.   I guess you could say I'm obsessed with knowledge. I'm forever studying something, be it theoretical physics, or history, or programming... I love meeting people who know about subjects that I don't so I can learn something new from them... I want to learn all that is learnable. And it bothers me that this is an unobtainable goal. No matter how much I learn or how fast I learn it there will always be more stuff that I don't know.    That's all for today. A nice short post to give you some insight into how my warped and twisted mind works. LOL. I'm just too hot to write anything else. It's insanely hot in this house right now and my parents don't believe in using the air conditioner 'cause it costs too much money. When I finally get my own place I am going to let that air conditioner run!! Being comfortable in your own house is worth the extra money for electricity!!   See you all soon!

      Hey everyone. I don't have any politics or religion or social commentary today. I just have a short update on what's been going on with me. You're regularly scheduled commentary will return tomorrow.   In an effort to lose some weight I've taken to walking back to the park and ride from my office after work. It's roughly a two mile walk. Not that much but it's amazing how much better I feel after I do it. I feel like I'm finally starting to lose weight (my scale and I are having a slight disagreement on that subject).   I finally called AG Edwards on Friday. Unfortunately it turned out to be a sales job. I found a few others at places like Citibank but those all turned out to be sales jobs as well. The one thing in this world that I cannot do is sales but that seems to be the only jobs available. I hate sales with a passion. Sales is all about pushing something on someone that they don't want or need. Sales is inherently dishonest and manipulative. Anyone who's ever been through sales training knows a huge part of the training is how to overcome objections... how to make people believe that they are wrong and they really do need whatever it is you are pushing. You are trained how to read people, how to figure out what buttons to push to get them excited about your product and how to smooth over the things that they don't like. It's hard and that's the problem. If someone really needed and wanted what you were selling, it wouldn't be so hard. You wouldn't have to spend so much time and energy overcoming objections and searching for the right button to push. It's a game, you versus them. In the end there can only be one winner. Ben Affleckâ€™s character in "Boiler Room" said it perfectly: "A sale is made on every call. Either you sell them some stock, or they sell you on a reason they can't. Either way, a sale is made. The only question is who's going to be closing?" It's the very competitive and confrontational nature of sales that illustrates all that is wrong in this country. But I said I wasn't going to get into social commentary today so I'll leave it at that. Suffice it to say, it is not in my character to be a salesman.   In other news, my mother is trying to set me up with a girl that she gets her nails done with. It's a sad day when your mother is trying to play matchmaker! But that got me thinking though. Do I really want a relationship now? Well, the answer to that is an emphatic "Hell yes!" as Andrea correctly said I'm just itching for a ball and chain of my very own. But the real question is do I want a relationship  here ? My number one goal right now is to move out of this state, hopefully to Lexington but if not Lexington then at least someplace southern or mid-western. If I were to start a new relationship with someone up here would that keep me from doing what I really want and moving out of this state? I think it would be better if I were to meet someone someplace else, like down in Lex while I'm there at the end of the month. That would give me extra motivation to move as quickly as possible. So perhaps I shouldn't try so hard to find someone up here. I don't know. Like anything else I suppose I just have to see what happens. The way life tends to work the instant I make the conscious decision to not look for someone up here that will be the day I find someone. Doesn't life always seem to work out like that? And why is that?  You know, I'm finally starting to feel like myself again. I've gotten some measure of confidence back and am no longer miserable 24/7. Oh, don't get me wrong... my job is a dead end, living in New Jersey is hell on earth, and I hate being single with a passion. But I no longer feel like these problems are insurmountable. I have a new sense of optimism and hope that tomorrow can be a brighter day if I just keep moving forward.   Well, unlike the rest of the world I have to work tomorrow (tomorrow being Sunday, it was still Saturday when I started typing this). So I'm off to bed!   Goodnight all!

      Went with Brandon to see Spiderman 2 tonight. It was an awesome movie! Great action sequences and special effects that are the hallmark of any good summer blockbuster. But what makes this movie great is that it has something that is missing from most, if not all, big action films: great character development. Tobey does a phenomenal job of portraying the conflict felt by Peter Parker. The fundamental conflict of the movie is should you do what is best for other people or what is best for yourself? Peter has these tremendous powers and with them a responsibility to help others. As Andrea pointed out in her blog, if you have the power to help someone, but don't do it, you are wrong. If I see a person about to fall onto train tracks and am standing close enough to grab her before she falls but choose to do nothing, I am at least partially responsible for her death. At the very least I would be considered, and rightfully so, a horrible person. If you have to power to help you are morally bound to do so. It is simply the right thing to do (incidentally, this principal forms the basis for one of the most powerful arguments against the existence of the Juedo-Christian God, but that is a topic for another day).   The problem that taking the time to help others often winds up interfering with what you want to do. In Peter's case being on call 24/7 as Spiderman costs him job after job, the love of his life, causes his education to suffer, to say nothing of constant money problems. On the smaller scale of the average person that hundred dollars you lend to a friend in need could have been a credit card payment that you now wouldn't be able to make. Andrea has already discussed this in her  urlLink blog  so I wouldn't go any further with it.   Instead I'd like to talk about my experience. Where I'm from people just don't help other people. We are brought up to mind our own business, to tune out the rest of the world when we walk down the street, to never make eye contact with strangers. Take a look at the streets of New York during a typical day. You can always recognize the true New Yorkers, they are the ones walking with their eyes focused straight ahead, never meeting anyone else's eyes, walking along at a breakneck pace oblivious to the world around them.   We are not friendly people. My company has three call centers, one here in Jersey City, another in California, and a third in Canada. Every month our call centers get evaluated by our customers on how well we serviced their needs. Ever month my call center rates lowest compared to the other two in friendliness. Our upper management just shrugs this off because, as was said to us in a meeting a few months back, "New Yorkers just naturally aren't as friendly as everyone else."   I consider myself a very friendly person who is always willing to help. As Brandon can tell you, it is a very rare thing for me to walk past a homeless person without stopping to give them at least something. I'm always willing to bend over backwards to help someone who I consider to be a friend, and often even people I don't know. This tendency of mine has unfortunately led to me being taking advantage of on several occasions in the past.   Yet even I, no matter how helpful and friendly I may think myself to be, am still a product of my environment. When I moved down to Alabama for college it was like being in a different world. The people were so friendly and helpful!!! When walking down a street it was not uncommon for a complete stranger to make eye contact with you (the worst possible thing to do to a New Yorker!) and even stop to say hello to you from time to time. I remember being on line at a Wal-Mart watching as the cashier would make small talk with the customers, asking how they were doing and how their families were, etc. Being from an environment where such behavior is practically unheard of I reacted badly. I immediately became defensive and suspicious. Why were these people being so friendly? What did they want? What's their agenda? It took me a while to realize that these people didn't have any nefarious agenda, they were friendly simply because that's just the type of people they were.   It took me a long time to get used to that kind of environment. But once I was I realized that I loved it. I never wanted to go back to the mean capital of the world. I miss the south. I miss the friendly people. I miss the slower pace of life. People here are in too much of a hurry to be friendly.   This world would be such a better place if there were more everyday heroes, like  urlLink Orge . If people would just slow down a bit and take the time to help each other out maybe this world wouldn't be such a bad place. If everybody in the world had to make the choice that Peter Parker had to make, I fear that most people would choose to hang up the Spiderman suit and serve themselves.   And that's just sad.

      A very long and tiring day for some reason. I don't know why but I've been waking up more and more tired each day, yet I go to bed at a semi-reasonable hour. Perhaps the overly repetitive and robotic nature of my job is getting to me. But I really shouldn't complain about work, at least I'm employed. Being unemployed for all those months taught me that any job is better then no job. Unfortunately, jobs are still very hard to find. Do you guys see todayâ€™s new jobless claims numbers? Up again! After declining for the past month or so they've suddenly shot up again. Perhaps if our government didn't reward companies who sent good American jobs overseas we wouldn't have this problem!   When I was unemployed I went to a computer training school. I had been in IT before and decided maybe it was time to get back. So I went for training in a very exciting new field, .NET development. It's basically programming with this really awesome new platform, .NET. The demand for .NET developers was expected to explode shortly so it seemed like a good bet. So I went, I learned, I got pretty damn good. And just as predicted, there was a massive surge in demand for anyone who knew .NET. But guess what? All the programmer jobs got shipped overseas!!!! There was tremendous demand for someone with my skills.....  IN INDIA!!!!!!!!!    But enough ranting about the umemployment/offshoring situation and what our boy Bush  isn't  doing to fix it. That's a topic for another day; I don't want to make this post too long after you had the patience to read the huge post from yesterday.   So just one more thing about yesterday's topic and I'm done for the day. Seriously. Andrea brought up an excellent point in her comment to my last post. The integration of religion and policy decision is not a new phenomenon (though Bush is taking it to new heights). It's actually something that started in the Cold War. See, communism is atheistic (one of its many redeeming qualities). To differentiate ourselves from the "godless" soviets we did two major things. First, we added the motto "In God We Trust" to our paper currency in 1953. Then in 1954 we added the phrase "Under God" to the Pledge of Allegiance. Add to that a little revisionist history to make the founding fathers sound like good little christian boys and you've set the stage for a country based on religion. We created this idea that American was a country founded on and based in religion as a weapon for the cold war... to show the world how America is better then the godless commies. The world has moved on since those dark days... unfortunate our politicians have not.  What bothers me is that people act as though "Under God" was always part of our pledge. It wasn't!! Even people alive in the mid fifties when it was added act as though it was always there. Again the specter of revisionist history surfaces. Our founding fathers were people who were fleeing from religious oppression. They were not good christians, most of them were deist. When the Southern Baptist convention asked Thomas Jefferson how he would integrate god into policy decisions, Jefferson wrote back the famous letter to the Southern Baptists where he created the now infamous phrase "a wall of separation between church and state." Jefferson was stating how religion will not affect policy decisions.   This wall of separation lasted well until the 1950s when communism became our mortal enemy. This was the era in which paranoia caused schools and libraries to remove copies of "Robin Hood" because the idea of robbing from the rich and giving to the poor was communist. This is the era where the Boston Reds changed their name to Boston Redsocks because "red" was communist. Anything associated with communism was considered evil and all attempts were made to purge such things from our society. This, unfortunately, extended to atheism. Thus our pledge and our currency were desecrated, history retold, and the country has never been the same. Thomas Jefferson must be turning in his grave.   Remove "Under God" from our pledge! Remove "In God We Trust" from our currency! And rebuild that critically important wall of separation between church and state!  And I'm done. See, that wasn't as bad as yesterday. I'm off to see Spiderman 2 tomorrow with Brandon. I'll post my thoughts on the movie for you all to read when I get back. You know, I talk as though there are tons of people reading this when in reality it's probably just Andrea and Brandon (hey guys!). I need to get my readership up!   Goodnight all!

      Good morning everyone. You know, ever since I started talking about Buffy S6 I've had the songs from "Once More With Feeling" stuck in my head! LOL. Believe it or not, I actually own the soundtrack to that episode. Yes, I am a geek and damn proud of it! :) Well, I had a fairly uneventful week.  On Friday I went out for the first time all week (I had been sitting all week chained to my computer looking for jobs). So I went to the movies and saw "Bourne Supremacy" which was good, but not quite as good as the original. Then I did a bit of shopping and went to see "Collateral." "Collateral" was an awesome movie, if you haven't seen it go now!  On Saturday I sleep late, played a lot of "Civilization III," and talked on the phone with Desha for about two hours.  Sunday was a great day at work, I got to get off the phones and work as a supervisor for the day. Very nice! Of course the first thing I did when I got home from work was to update my resume to reflect supervisory experience. :) Aside from that I played a bit more "Civ III" and that's about it.  So that was my weekend. No politics or social commentary here. All very simple and boring. Today I will be hitting the job search again.  Well, back to work for me. Sorry for the boring post today. Maybe something exciting will happen later that I'll be able to write about. :)

      Time like this make me so proud to be from New Jersey. If you all haven't heard the news, our governor, a democrat named James McGreevey who is married with two kids, held a press conference in which he announced that he was gay and had been having an affair with a man. It seems that the guy he was sleeping with was about to file suit against him for sexual misconduct. As a result of the impending scandal, McGreevey further announced that he will be resigning as governor of New Jersey.  I always thought McGreevey was an excellent governor. He did some good things for the state like giving high school kids full scholarships to college on the basis of merit alone. Under McGreevey's program if you were at the top of your class, you stood a good chance of going to college free. Awesome program! So he's done a lot of good. And I certainly have no problem with him being gay. I'm sure his lover was about to sue only to get money out of him and that there was no sexual misconduct as the lover alleges. Yes, he cheated on his wife and that is without a doubt one of the worst things a human being, gay or straight, can possibly do but by the same token I look at that as a private matter between him, his wife, and his lover. It's not really the public's business and has nothing to do with his ability to run the state. So I guess it's safe to say that I don't think he should resign. Regardless of how he runs his personal life, as long as he is doing a good job running the state he should stay. Anyone who supported Clinton during his sex scandal should support McGreevey now. The gay issue is irrelevant, what McGreevey did and what Clinton did are exactly the same. They cheated on their wives while in office and then tried to cover it up for as long as possible. No difference. I would hate to see all the good that this man has done be undone because of this. But as McGreevey has already formally announced his resignation, I suppose it's a moot point anyways.  Ogre, I cannot spell at all. I type words the way they sound and rely on spell check. Usually running spell check on my posts takes almost as long as writing them in the first place my spelling is so bad. Yes, the word I'm trying to use is "definitely" but I guess with the way I spell the word spell check returns "defiantly" as the best match. Sorry. :)  Okay Andrea, I'm gonna talk about Buffy some more so you can stop reading at this point. :) Responding to Ogreâ€™s comment to "The Day of Depressing Topics" the Trio was meant to be laughed at for the majority of the season until they crossed the line with Warren killing his girlfriend. If you watch the commentary on the DVDs the producers meant for us to not take the trio seriously so the focus could be on life as the Big Bad. Until the end when the group started to pull together again and the Trio suddenly became dangerous. But yes, it was definitely a great commentary on the evil that is inherent in all men. That once you cross a certain line there is no going back. Xander being the one to talk Willow down was definitely the best part, though. What made it so great was that it wasn't Buffy who saved the day in the end, it was Xander. The guy who throughout the past six seasons has always dealt with thoughts of how useless he was to the group as he was the only one who did not have any kind of special skills or abilities.  But on the love issue, that's definitely something you missed if you didn't see the early seasons. There was a very intense romantic love between them. They had loved each other for years but never acted on it as they didn't want to jeopardize the great friendship they had. Until finally (this is in Season 2) Willow and Xander have a near death experience and wind up acting on their feelings finally. In the process Willow winds up cheating on Oz and Xander cheats on Cordellia. They are of course caught in the act by Oz and Cordellia. Cordellia leaves Xander while Oz decided he can forgive Willow. After that, they realized they couldn't be together (I forget exactly why) so they suppressed their romantic feelings for each other and just focused on the friendship. So when Xander was on that cliff with Willow, trying to talk her down by telling her how much he loved her, he was describing love on every level, friendship love, sisterly love, romantic love, everything. I would argue that Xander loves Willow more then he loved Anya because his love for Anya was just romantic and only about two years old whereas his love for Willow stretches back a decade or more and covers the whole spectrum of love. I've always thought then when you're with the right person you love them as more then just a girlfriend/lover/wife, you love them as a best friend as well.  I took care this time to make sure I spelled definitely correctly this time. :) Well, have a good night all!

      Andrea and Ogre got the day going with very depressing topics (hence the title of my post) about the people we've lost touch with over the years as we've grown older. Yes, I've lost my share of friends over the years, I think we all have. My best friends from high school are long since gone, as are my friends from my first few jobs, college, etc. It's just part of life I suppose; people grow up and move on. As we grow and change as people we drift apart, we no longer have the same things in common. It's just the way life goes, I suppose. It's defiantly depressing when you look back on it (though I tend to be more depressed over opportunities I've missed or passed up then I am over old friends that are gone). But it's not always negative. Sometimes you manage to hold onto the people who are most important. Take Andrea and myself for example. We met about eight years ago. Over the years we've lost touch with each other on several occasions, sometimes going a year or more without hearing from each other. But even after all of that I can still say Andrea is my best friend and my life is better for that. I mean, if I didn't have Andrea in my life I would never have visited Lexington enough to decide that I want to move there, I never would have met the wonderful group of people that I met the other week, never would have met Desha (can't forget about that! That was a very skillful piece of plotting by Andrea. I'm sure it was a huge coincidence that at the murder mystery party it just so happened that Andrea assigned the person she thought would be good for me to the role of someone my character was having an affair with. Yeah, real big "coincidence" there. :) ) So sometimes the old friendships do last and you're a better person as a result. It's not all negative. :)  Okay, enough of the depressing topic! On to more interesting and upbeat topics! Ogre said he wanted to talk about Buffy Season 6. I've actually been meaning to talk about that for a while, but always wound up getting sidetracked by political and social commentary.  I absolutely loved Season 6 of Buffy, it was probably the best season of television I've ever watched and defiantly my favorite out of the Buffy seasons (season five is a close second). Season 6 can pretty much be described as the season where everything went to hell. Actually, this kind of relates to what we were all talking about with people growing up and drifting apart. Argh! I was trying to get away from that topic!  See, ever since the beginning (which in the show was sophomore year of high school) Buffy has had a really tight circle of friends, Willow, Xander, Giles, Anya, and later on people like Tara joined the group. They've been through everything together, from vampires to demons to apocalypses. They've always been there to support each other when things got tough, like when Buffy had to kill Angel. They were the closest group of friends you could ever imagine and you, the viewer, always knew that no matter what happened these people would be there for one another.  All that changed in Season 6. Right from the beginning everything was different, the group fell apart. After dying at the end of Season 5 and being brought back by Willow at the beginning of Season 6, Buffy had to deal with being ripped out of heaven to be brought back to life. After being in Heaven life seemed like hell to her. So she started a very destructive relationship with Spike that she had to keep hidden from her friends 'cause they'd never be able to understand. Giles, after being Buffy's mentor for years, came to feel that he was standing in the way of her adult independence. That as long as he was around, Buffy would always look to him to take care of her instead of relying on herself. Willow developed an addiction to magic that resulted in her losing her love, Tara, only to finally get her back just to lose her again the very next day in the most dramatic and traumatizing way possible. Xander and Anya's wedding fell apart. Essentially everything that could go wrong for these people did go wrong. They drifted apart, came to resent each other. And this drama led to some of the most amazing episodes of television ever. Like the incomparable "Once More With Feeling." The entire episode was done as a musical where all the characters were compelled to sing, and it was here that everyone's secrets were revealed. Buffy admitted that she had been in heaven (she had let her friends believe that she was in hell and that they had done a favor by bringing her back). Xander and Anya admitted that they had doubts about their wedding. Tara realized Willow had been using magic to fuck with her memory. Giles first came to the conclusion that he was standing in way of Buffy's independence. And Spike and Buffy's destructive relationship got its start. All in the space of one brilliant episode. And of course there was Tara's death that lead to Willow's fall to dark magic. Xander admitting his love for her during the final episode right when she was poised to destroy the world. Buffy finally coming to terms with living again. This show was filled with some of the most amazing moments.  In each season there was the "Big Bad." The main bad guy who was out to destroy the world. Each season brought us a new Big Bad, you had the Master, Angel, the Mayor, Adam, Glory, but in Season 6 the main bad guy was laughable, a group of high school geeks determined to become super villains. The Big Bad of Season 6 wasn't any person, or demon, or vampire. The Big Bad of Season 6 was life itself. Dawn said it perfectly in "Once More With Feeling:" "The hardest thing about life is living it."  We see the group grow up, take on adult responsibilities, deal with issues like mortgages, marriage, raising a child, all for the first time. We see how this changed them, 'caused them to drift apart, make horrible decisions, and generally just make a mess of everything. But the Season ends with a measure of hope that tomorrow can be a better day. That no matter what life throws at you, no matter what mistakes you make, you can come out the other side a stronger person and better for the experience. At the end the group is whole again and closer to each other then ever before. One of the things Spike sang during OMWF, "Life's not a song, life isn't bliss, life is just this: it's living. You'll get along, the pain that you feel can only be healed by living. You have to go on living."  A truer statement I have never heard. We've all made mistakes, we all of things that we've done that we regret, or things we didn't do that we regret not doing. We've all lost good friends over the years. Had our hearts broken. But we learn, we grow, and we move on. We go on living and in the end we are better people for the experiences we've had.  Well, this post will probably be of no interest to anybody by Ogre. I just felt like talking about something that I like. It's kinda funny though how it related right back to the topic of the day.

      Pretty good day today. Spent most of work training one of the other associates. This basically means I got to have him take all my phone calls while I just sat back and made sure he didnâ€™t screw up that badly. :) CitiFinancial sent me an email saying they had two jobs in Lexington that I appear to be qualified for. I of course immediately applied to both of them. Aside from that, nothing really of interest happened today. I really need to go out; I've spent the entire week so far chained to my computer looking for jobs. I need a break! LOL  So Andrea made mention of one of the many reality shows in her blog. It is my opinion that the decline and fall of western civilization can be directly linked to the number of the reality shows on the air. Seriously, I despise reality shows! They demean relationships and people's feelings on national television for fun and profit. Some shows aren't so bad, like the original Bachelor. Before there were any twists and surprises it was a guy or a girl honestly looking for someone to love and marry. Not bad. But then they started getting out of hand. Like "Temptation Island." Let's take a group of happy couples, take them to this island, subject them to more temptation of the perfectly orchestrated and planned out kind then a normal person will ever deal with in a lifetime and watch those formally happy relationships fall apart. All on national television. Yes!! Now that's entertainment! Or "For Love or Money." Let's take a guy who is honestly searching for love and put him in a situation where woman are competing for his affections... only they may only be going after him to get the money at the end. So at the end this poor guy gets his heart broken by some greedy woman who got him to fall in love with her just so she could reject him and walk away with the money. Devastated people and broken hearts! Gotta love it!  Is it any wonder there are so many playas out there? Is it such a surprise that not many people take relationships seriously anymore? That people look at it like one big game? Our media, though their reality shows and music programming, teaches us that relationships aren't serious, they're just a game. And if a woman's feelings get hurt by some playa, well that's her own damn fault for not respecting the game. This is what we're taught.  Call me old-fashioned, or conservative, or just plain stupid, but I cannot stand the way relationships are portrayed in popular culture. I've always believed, and always will believe, that you don't play games with people's feelings. You don't play games with relationships. They are things to be taken seriously. Sometimes they work, sometimes they don't, but no matter which way a relationship works out it is not a game. We're talking about people's feelings here.  So I despise the reality shows for taking relationships, turning them into games, and then promoting it as entertainment. But you know the biggest reason I hate the reality shows? They are so damn addictive!!! No matter how much I hate the premise of these shows, and deride them for their treatment of relationships, when I see one on TV I can't help but to watch. It's like driving past a traffic accident. You know it's wrong and sick and twisted, but you just can't help but to slow down to get a good look. LOL  That's pretty much all I've got for today. After the two post and comment war from yesterday, I'm all out of things to say for the moment. But that wouldn't last for long. :)  So goodnight all!

      You know, our company's system is just crazy. Our break and lunch times are scheduled for us by this computer program that determines the optimal time for our breaks. Well this brilliant piece of software scheduled me for break from 9:45-10:ooam and then lunch starting at 10:30am. And why exactly do I need to go to lunch only 30 minutes after I get back from break? And do I really need to eat this early? Stupid system!  Well, I was planning this nice response to Ogre's post, but Andrea beat me to it with an absolutely brilliant (and lengthy) comment. If you don't routinely read the comments to my posts, I encourage you to check out the comments to "Are the End Times Here Yet?"  As Andrea took most of what I was going to say (and said it better then I would have) I only have one other comment to make.  Ogre says that is ridiculous for us to put all the blame on one man. Ordinarily, yes I would agree. But now we're talking about the President of the United States. Harry Truman said it best: "The buck stops here." It may be his advisors who suggest policy. It may be congress that introduces the legislation. But as president, the buck stops with Bush. He is the one who makes the ultimate decision. He has the power to veto congress's legislation; to accept or reject his advisors recommendations.  Yes, you can say that the problem lays with Ashcroft or Rumesfeld or Cheney or Ridge, that the policies are really theirs. That its Ridge who creates the terror alerts, it was Ashcroft who pushed for the Patriot Act, it was Rumesfeld who helped build the case for war. All true. But who appointed these people? George W. Bush. Who chose to go along with their recommendations? George W. Bush.  Who drafted the legislation banning stem cell research? George W. Bush. Who publicly stated that they have a mandate from God? George W. Bush. Who fought the hardest for a tax package that benefits the wealthy and rewards companies who ship jobs overseas? George W. Bush.  So who do I lay my blame on? George W. Bush.

      I'm back again! You know, I haven't gotten any calls yet from good jobs but I've gotten several calls from full-service firms who are dying to get their hands on an honest to god New York Stockbroker. I say right on my Monster and Hotjobs resumes that I am not looking for a sales position. But still I'm getting these calls "You're a licensed broker from New York City? Why don't you come work for our firm when you move down here? You can show us southerners how a real New York Broker sells stock!" (Yes, that was an actual call I received today). Apparently being a New Yorker is a great selling point when applying for an out of state financial job. I need to edit my resume to emphasize where I'm from.  So I think it's pretty much official. This election belongs to Bush. We're in for another four years. If that happens I think I'm going to forget about moving to Kentucky and flee to Canada instead. Anyone care to join me?  Newsweek columnist Eleanor Clift wrote an  urlLink article  in which she made the convincing case that Bush has this election wrapped up and there's nothing Kerry can do about it. "The subliminal message of the Bush campaign is that a vote for John Kerry is a vote for Osama bin Laden." Clift writes. The problem is that Bush can control the agenda. Every time events start swinging in Kerry's favor Bush can play his trump card, terrorism, to distract the voters. Already they've made an announcement saying that it is likely that terrorists are already in the country and are planning on sabotaging the elections. If there is an attack most analysts say the voters will rally around the president. Bush wins. If there's no attack Bush can claim that his policies have kept America safer. Then they'll just raise the terror alert again to get voters thinking about terrorism, therefore thinking of how Bush has kept them safe. Bush wins.  It all comes down to fear. Fear is the most powerful political weapon there is. Hate is a close second. And Bush is a master at using the weapon of fear. Kerry is caught between a rock and a hard place. If he attacks Bush's use of the terror alerts Bush can paint him as anti-American and as someone who will not take the job of protecting the US seriously. If Kerry supports the alerts he will look like he is supporting Bush policies. No mater which way Kerry goes, Bush wins.  Very depressing. It looks like we're in for four more years of a badly managed economy, of innocent kids being killed in a huge mistake of a war, of harmful energy policies that favor the big oil companies, of one man's religious views being forced upon all Americans through legislation. Can anybody teach me the Canadian National Anthem?  Damn you Bush! You had a real opportunity after 9/11 to make this country a better place. You had in your power the ability to unite this country in a way never before seen. To bring us closer to our allies. To take steps that really would have made this world safer. Instead you chose to divide this country with your lies and manipulations. To vilify America in the eyes of her allies. To turn Iraq into the greatest terrorist recruiting center ever. To run our economy into the group with your policies that favor the rich, the powerful, and Halliburton. To take away the hope of people suffering from incurable diseases such as Alzheimerâ€™s by banning the majority of stem cell research. To allow our children to grow up ignorant about sex, birth control, and STDs thanks to your abstinence only policies. To allow our kids to die on foreign soil so you can prove that you're a better, stronger, man then your father. To decide that fucking with the constitution so gays cannot ever be married is a more important issue then our economy. To reward companies that ship American jobs overseas! Damn you! If it wasn't for you and your handling of the economy I might be living down in Kentucky having dinner with Desha right now! Or maybe playing some Halo with Nick. Or talking politics with Andrea. Or maybe working a part-time job at Wal-Mart for extra money. I might be there! Instead of sitting here sending off resume after resume and getting nothing but sales jobs in return.  Damn you Bush. Damn you.

      Good morning everyone! I was planning on talking today about the new "intelligence" that says terrorists are already in the country and planning on sabotaging the election. But then I read Andrea's blog about parents snooping on their kids and decided to talk about that instead. Politics will have to wait until tomorrow. :)   Andrea asks the question "Is it wrong to read your child's diary?" My answer to that would be "No!" Now there are exceptions to that, of course. If as a parent you have reason to suspect your child may be involved in something dangerous such as drugs, or gangs, or sleeping around, then by all means crack open that diary and find out. But if you have no reason to suspect your child of anything then you have no business in their diary.   In order to form a close relationship with your child you must develop trust. They have to know they can come to you and talk to you honestly. There are two things I believe you must do to form a close relationship with your child. 1) In the absences of real and rational suspicions you have to trust your kids and 2) You have to be willing to listen to what your kids have to say.   If either of these two things is missing your child will not trust you. If they don't trust you they will not come to you and then they really will start hiding major things. Andrea is absolutely correct, that lack of trust can have serious repercussions for that child growing up.   I never kept a diary when I was younger, but I know many people who did. And most of them have had parents who broke into that diary at one point or another (it seems to be a very common thing to do). Of those people who had their diary read by their parents, not a single one of them have good relationships with their parents to this day. That violation of trust will poison a relationship for all time.   It's really no different from a significant other cheating, or a friend stealing your boyfriend/girlfriend. Trust is the most fundamentally important part to any relationship be it a family relationship, a romantic relationship, or a friendship. And once that trust is broken the relationship will never be the same. You can forgive, you can move on, but the damage is already done and cannot be undone.   Now I will say that perhaps my viewpoint will change once I become a parent. But I sincerely hope not. I want to create a trusting relationship with my children so that they will not be afraid to come to me and tell me about the boy/girl they're interested in, or the problems they're having in school, or whatever. Perhaps it's harder to create such a relationship with your kids then I realize. Maybe that's why parents are so tempted to read their kids stuff... it's easier to spy then to build a trusting relationship.   So there's my two cents. Considering I'm not a parent my two cents probably isn't worth anything. But, talking from the perspective of someone who still remembers what it was like to be a child (it wasn't that long ago) I can say that more trust and openness would have led to a happier family relationship.   Moving on to other news. After relaxing yesterday watching some Babylon 5 (awesome show, by the way!) today I will be hitting the job search hard. Armed with my new and improved resume this should be easy! Well, perhaps not easy... but surely easier then finding a job during those ten months I was unemployed. I hope. :) I pretty much have no life anymore. I've devoted most of my free time to the job search.  Talk to you all soon!

      Wow. Two posts today. I must be feeling especially prolific.  I wanted to talk a little bit about family. Mine in particular. Yesterday and today I spent most of the day with family of mine that I hadn't seen in years who came in for a visit. My cousin Steven came in yesterday so I spent most of the day with him while my parents were at work. Great guy, Steven. He's a professional photographer from Arizona. He won the Louie Award a few years back which is essentially the photography industry's version of the Academy Award. So he's extremely talented. We went up to visit my grandmother in the nursing home since he hadn't seen her for years then came back to my place and sat around talking until we both wound up taking a nap. LOL  Today my cousin's Mark and Carolyn came by. They are in pharmaceutical sales in California. We had a barbeque in our back yard for them. They brought they're two daughters with them, Taylor and Mya. They're five and three respectively. I have such a soft spot for kids, I love them. So I spent the entire barbeque playing with the kids instead of talking with the adults. LOL I've always loved children. One day if I'm lucky I'll have my own.  So what's the point of the recap of my two days with family? Actually, nothing really. I was just thinking about how strange it is that I get along so well with all my out of state relatives, my cousins from California, my aunt and cousin from Arizona, but I don't get along at all with my relatives who live here in Jersey with me. I get along decently with my father, I don't get along at all with my mother. My parents don't get along with my aunt and uncle who live in the same town. They are barred from every coming by this house and my parents have on numerous occasions left me very strict instructions that if and when they die, my aunt and uncle are not to be allowed in this house under any circumstances (my parents have threatened to haunt me should I disobey these instructions. LOL)  It's sad because I really would like to have a close family. I'm always jealous of people I meet who have a really good relationship with their parents and other immediate family. I often wonder where our family went wrong that we don't have that kind of close relationship.  Oh, well. Hopefully when I finally have a family of my own we will have the kind of close relationship that I've always wished I had with my own family. All I ask is a loving wife and children who do not hate us! Perhaps in this day and age I am asking too much. LOL  Well, that's all I've got. Told you this post had no real point. It was just something that was bothering me that I wanted to get off my chest.  I'm off to bed! Work tomorrow. Yuck! The weekend goes by so fast! If I were running for president I would campaign on a platform of making all work weeks 4 days (still eight hours a day). Three day weekends for everyone!  Night all!

      Anybody know where that quote comes from?  So today is a depressing day. I woke up early today. A little earlier then I was supposed because a certain somebody who shall remain nameless text messaged me at 7:30 in the freakin morning! LOL  Brandon is gone. I went to his house at about 9am and helped him finish packing. Then he jumped in his car and was gone. Lucky bastard! He has escaped this hell on earth we call New Jersey. I will defiantly miss him. I have no idea what I'm going to do on Friday's now that he's gone! LOL.  In other news I applied to four jobs yesterday and five the day before. I've posted new resumes on Monster and Hotjobs. I swear, I've applied to more jobs in the past week then I did during the entire time I was unemployed! But as Andrea said, I have more motivation this time. Thanks go out to Desha and Andrea who have been tremendously helpful to me in my job search. Andrea and I were working last night to redo my resume. It kicks ass now! I'm going to get a job soon, I can feel it!  And that brings me to the topic of today's post. I was talking to my father the other night about me moving. He told me that I should wait until I've paid off my debt before I move. As that will take about another 10 months at my current rate of payment I am not willing to wait that long. I will do whatever I have to do. If I'm having trouble keeping ahead of my debt after I move I will get a part time job at Wal-Mart of wherever to help me out. I will not pass up another opportunity to escape Jersey for any reason.  A very wise woman once said to me many years ago "If you wait until you're ready before you do something it will never get done." There will always be something, some excuse, some reason, that will come up to prevent you from doing what you want to if you let it. I could easily say I should wait until I've paid off my credit card debt before moving. But then what? I'll pay off my credit card debt and then say "Well, now that I have no debt I should save up some more money before I leave." So then I'll wait another few months while I save money. And after that it will be something else. Perhaps I'll have just gotten a promotion, or some unseen expense comes up that wipes out my savings. You never know. The point is there is never a perfect time to make a life altering decision. You will always be able to find a reason not to do it. So you'll spend all your time preparing to do something, but you'll never actually wind up doing it.  It is so easy to get trapped in a cycle of endless preparation, even for the simple things. I'll give you an example. Our old big screen TV broke about two months ago. My dad decided that instead of paying to have it fixed again he will replace it with a modern HDTV. So we set out looking for a good TV and quickly found one. Then came the price comparisons. He went everywhere imaginable trying to find the best possible price. And he did, he got an amazing price on that TV. But did he take it at that point? Of course not! Need more preparation! He starting thinking to himself that the new models are coming out soon so perhaps he should wait for them and maybe be able to get something better. And what's going to happen when they come out? They'll be too expensive so he'll say we should wait until they come down in price. Once they come down in price it will be time for the next series of models to be released and the cycle will repeat itself over and over again. An endless loop of preparation. Several years back I once spoke to a customer whose husband had just passed away. In their account they had well over ten million dollars. The distraught woman starts telling me her life story. It turned out that will all the money they had they never used a dime. They lived very modestly, barely a middle class level. The husband was obsessed with saving money. You had to save for a rainy day. You had to prepare for the unexpected. In the end he spent so much time preparing for the unexpected that he never wound up enjoying the money that he had worked so hard to earn. It was a very sad story. His fear of what might happen paralyzed him; it prevented him from doing the things he wanted to do and trapped him in and endless loop of preparing for possibilities that never happened.  We trap ourselves in these endless loops because we are scared to make the big decisions. Scared of making the wrong one. Am I scared of moving to Kentucky? You'd better believe it I am! I have all sorts of fears from the major to the minor: Will I be able to find a good job? If I find a good job will my position be outsourced to India two months after I get there? If I wind up losing my job will I be able to still find a way to pay my bills? Are all the wonderful people that I met still going to be around in six months? Will Desha still be A) single and B) interested by the time I get down there? Is Andrea correct in her estimates of how much it really costs to live down there? And so on and so on.  I think it's perfectly normal to have fears and doubts about doing something that will fundamentally alter your life. The trick is to not let those fears and doubts paralyze you. That's the hard part. When faced with the tough decisions we tend to go with the safer, more comfortable, alternative even if we know itâ€™s really not what's best for us. That's how I wound up stuck with Natalia for five years. It's a mistake I'm determined to never make again.  So when that opportunity comes along I will take it. I know things may not work out exactly the way I hope they will. No one knows what the future has in store. But we must face that future without letting ourselves be paralyzed by the fear and the doubts. No matter what winds up happening when I move I know one thing, I am better off down there then I am up here. I will get there, and I will get there soon.  "If you wait until you are ready to do something it will never get done."

      I ran across an  urlLink article  on MSNBC a little while ago that I just had to write about.  It seems our boy Bush has finally come clean and told the truth about his administrationâ€™s plans! At a signing ceremony for his new defense bill Bush declared that his administration will â€œnever stop thinking about new ways to harm our country and our people."  So the truth finally comes out!

      Went last night with Brandon to see "The Village." I think my entire readership (I believe I'm up to 6 people now. Yay!) has seen it at the point so it is safe to talk about it. If I'm wrong and you haven't seen it yet then skip this post.  I loved the movie. I honestly did not see it coming. I kinda figured that the creatures in the woods weren't real but the idea that they were actually living in modern times was a surprise to me. It was a fascinating idea, Walker inherits billions from his murdered father and uses that money to buy a huge forest and have it labeled as a wildlife refuge so no one would be able to enter their land. In the middle of this "refuge" he sets up a village where people can live in peace outside of the evil of the cities. I agree with his motives but have serious problems with his methods.  For one thing this village is entirely self-sufficient which makes me wonder... was the size of the original population large enough to introduce enough genetic diversity to sustain a society? Or are we going to see some serious inbreeding in a few generations? And what about the population? The village has borders that cannot be breached in order to maintain their illusion so what are they going to do as the population expands and available space starts running out? Will the Elders have to institute some serious population control laws to keep the population size stable? And how would that be accomplished in an 1800's era village where they wouldn't exactly have access to birth control?  I think he took things to some serious extremes. Being in a horrible city (did you see those headlines on the paper that M. Night was reading?) is certainly a bad thing and I can certainly understand his desire to leave. But usually when people don't like the place they live in they move to a different area. For example, I hate New Jersey so I want to move to Kentucky. Brandon hates New Jersey so he's moving to North Carolina. That's what rational people do. They don't cut themselves off from the world in an Amish style village.  In doing so I would argue that Walker hurt the people of his village more then he helped them. Yes, the city they fled from (Philadelphia) is filled with horrible people and they all suffered terrible losses at the hands of those people. But the city is also filled with plenty of good things. Like modern medicine and doctors.  The child who died in the very beginning of the movie. Did he have to die? If they still had access to modern medicine could he have been saved? Could Ivy have been treated before she became blind? Could a little Prozac have helped Noah before he became an attempted murderer?  Everyone except the elders was born in the village; they do not know what technology was supposed to look like in the 1800s. They could have had a fully modern clinic in their village and the people would have accepted it as normal if they had grown up with it always being there. Walker was a multi-billionaire; he easily could have bought all the medical supplies the village would ever have needed.  I suppose you can make the counter-argument that the village needed to be completely self-sufficient and that a village of that size could not be self-sufficient if you introduced modern medical technology. Drugs would eventually run out or expire and need to be replaced; diagnostic equipment would need to be maintained, etc. But still, the point of the village was to give its inhabitants a better life then could be found in the city. Can you really say that Walker gave his people a better life while deny them the basic medical tools that could have helped them?  So there's my problem with the village. Walker intended to help his people but by denying them the positive aspects of modern technology in the end he really hurt them.  Desha will probably say that I way overanalyzed the movie. She's right; I do have a habit of analyzing everything. LOL

      Good morning all! I'm feeling relatively rested today as I actually got to bed early last night for a change. I really need to start going to be earlier all the time, but that's never gonna happen. For whatever reason once it gets to be around the time that I should be going to bed I suddenly find a million things that I want to do that just never occurred to me to do hours earlier.  On the job search, Desha sent me a list of local Lexington headhunters. I'll contact a few of those today. This is a very good sign; Desha is taking an active interest in helping me find a job in Lex. :) I also applied to three jobs that I found on Careerbuilder.com. Honestly, I couldn't even tell you what companies I applied for. I just saw good sounding jobs and hit the apply button. All were in the financial industry, though. What I would ideally love to do is get back into IT. Unfortunately it's been so long since the last time I worked in IT that my skills are sorely outdated and therefore useless. I would love to update my skills and get back into computers. But first things first, I need to get down to Lex. Once I'm there, then I can worry about moving back into the IT industry.  As I was on my way to work today, looking at all the police standing around with their M-16s I got to thinking of "The Manchurian Candidate." The movie was all about a company working to manipulate our political system for their own gain (to put a sleeper in the White House). Is that really any different from whatâ€™s going on today? The whole Bush Administration is all about manipulation. In the movie this was accomplished with mind-control implants, in the real world itâ€™s accomplished with money. But that's pretty much the only difference.  I'm sure by this point everyone's read or heard about how the intelligence that our current terror alert is based on was three years old, created prior to 9/11. Now they say that this information, even though it is three years old, was just discovered and it was important to act on. And that even though the information is so outdated they have reason to believe the surveillance of our financial institutions continued afterwards. Uh, huh. Right. Mind you this is coming from the same administration who said Iraq has all these evil WMDs laying around. To say that they've lost credibility on intelligence matters would be an understatement.  No, this whole alert comes at a very coincidental time. Right after the Democratic National Convention when people were focused on Kerry and all the good things he had to say. All of a sudden there's a terror alert to scare the people and get their minds focused on terrorism again (our boy Bush's supposed strong point). Opinion polls suggest that a majority of Americans (including many who support Kerry) still view Bush as the better man to deal with terrorism so it is in the administration's best interest to keep the people focused on terrorism whenever possible. Now they can't do it all the time, the attention span of the average American is notoriously limited. So they scream terrorism at well planned, strategic moments. Such as right after the Democratic National Convention. I am willing to bet that there will be another terror alert just prior to the election or actually during the election.  It's manipulation, pure and simple. Perhaps not accomplished with mind-control chips but manipulation none-the-less.  And that's just how the Bush Administration is manipulating us. What about how companies are manipulating the Bush Administration? Halliburton, anybody? Isn't it interesting how they get all the best Iraq contracts? How they are profiting tremendously from the war? How they have direct financial ties to the president and vice-president? It's an interesting situation, for sure. Defiantly deserves some investigation.  And that's the problem. There is no investigation! Hardly anybody is questioning the administrationâ€™s Halliburton ties. Where's the liberal media that we supposedly have?! Why aren't they all over this?! Something is very wrong here. The media goes out of their way to avoid digging up the dirt on Bush and Cheney, to avoid investigating their business ties with the company that is profiting from the deaths of our kids in uniform. That's not like our media at all. These are the same people who tore Clinton apart for his business dealings in Whitewater. Those same people are pretty much leaving Bush alone. Am I alone here in saying "What the fuck?!"  The American people are being manipulated. We are being manipulated by our administration, we are being manipulated by Halliburton, and we are being manipulated by our so-called liberal media. And I'm afraid that these manipulations are going to be successful. I foresee four more years of Bush hell. And I'm scared!  Manchurian Global may have failed in their attempt to put a sleeper in the White House, but Halliburton has sure succeeded.

      Well, I am not well rested. Instead of coming home and taking a nap I came home and noticed Desha (oh, for my Jersey friends that is pronounced De-shay, not De-shah) was online and started talking to her. It's now 9pm and I haven't taken a nap or unpacked (my other goal for the night). But you know what? I'd rather be talking to her anyways. My bag can stay packed for another day.  Earlier in the week the subject of blogging came up. Is it really a good thing? Yes, there are some serious drawbacks to maintaining a blog. For one thing everything you say in a blog is public information. This basically means that youâ€™ve got to watch what you say at all times and be very careful who you give your blog address to. For example, I gave the address to Desha to read. Was that a good idea? For someone who doesn't know me that well to read my writing it's easy to get the wrong idea. Just read "The Zeroth Law" and "The Price of Freedom.... is Idiots in the White House" and I can easily come across as some kind of fascist human hating nut-job if you don't know me (the people who know me well know that that's only partially true LOL). So is letting this woman, who I am very interested in but don't yet know very well, read my blog a good idea? Perhaps not. But by the same token what better way for her to get to know me better then my reading my thoughts and feelings? So perhaps it is a good idea. I don't know. The point is when you blog you are making yourself vulnerable. I will admit to feeling nervous when she told me she was reading my blog.... my entire blog... all the way back to the beginning.  So the question is, is it worth it? Andrea mentioned a friend of hers who stopped blogging because it was too public of a forum. Ogre took a short hiatus from blogging as he thought that his blog had become too public. So is blogging worth it? I'd have to say yes it is. Blogging gives me a platform to air my views, discuss the issues of the day, keep my friends from Kentucky up to date on what's going on in my life, and vent when I need to vent. So yes, I'd say that blogging is well worth it. Yes, it's all public. Yes, posting your thoughts on the internet can leave you exposed and vulnerable. But you'll never find a better platform for getting your voice heard. And that's really what blogging is all about.  Okay, after I talked about the blogging question I meant to talk about some of the other issues that came up during the week like Kerry's speech. But it's late and I'm tired. So I'm going to bed. Which means that you're in for a Part 3. When I'm completely done with this post I'll edit it to put them all together. But not now.  No! Sleepy!

      I am suffering today! LOL. I was up until about 6:30am on Sunday, slept for 3 and a half hours, got up and drove 11 hours back to Jersey. Got in at 12:45am, went to sleep at about 1:30am to wake up at 6:30am to go to work. I am so exhausted I'm falling asleep on the phone with customers! LOL. I think a good nap is called for when I get home.  Wow, it's been a week since my last post. In my defense I was on vacation damnit and had better things to do then sit in front of a computer (who would have thought I'd ever be saying that? LOL). My long hiatus means that you're in for the mother of all posts today. So sit back, get a coffee, grab a smoke, this is gonna be a long one.  First let's talk about my vacation. I could simply sum it up in one word: "WOW!!" but then it wouldn't be much of a post. So let's see here... Tuesday we did jazz in the park and then went with Nicole, Zack, and Doc Karen to get some ice cream and just sat around and talked. Nicole and Zack told the very funny stories of how they hooked up. On Wednesday I took five women to the Hustler store (where they bought things for other men, but still, I took five women to the Hustler store!! LOL) then we proceeded to get some ice cream and sat around and talked (this sitting around talking seems to be a common theme). Thursday we went to Zack and Nicole's house to watch Kerry's speech with them and their republican dog (we call him a republican dog because he would bark whenever Kerry came on the screen). Nick later showed up with the beer and more sitting around and talking ensued. Friday Nick and I did some grocery shopping followed by a quest to Home Depot and Lowes to find Venus Fly traps (Nick hates flies!) That night we went out to an Italian restaurant followed by a trip to the movies to see "The Manchurian Candidate." Great movie! My one disappointment about Lexington, however... they don't do Italian nearly as well as Jersey and New York (must be all of our Mafia connections up here). Saturday was the Murder Mystery Party which I thought was a tremendous amount of fun. At the party Andrea introduced me to Desha who turned out to be an absolutely wonderful woman. Andrea, Nick, Desha and I stayed at the party until about 4am and then Desha and I wound up hanging out until 6am (not 8 like  urlLink Andrea  says and no, nothing like that happened so get those ideas out of your head! :) ) Sunday was the drive home. I woke up very late (no surprise given that I didn't go to bed until after 6 in the morning). I saw Desha again briefly then sat and talked with Andrea and Nick for a little bit before finally getting on the road. Didn't get home until about quarter to 1 in the morning. Yuck!  So that was my vacation. I didn't actually do much, there was a lot of sitting around and talking as you can gather. But I'll tell you this: it was absolutely awesome, every minute of it. If there was ever the slightest doubt in my mind that Lexington, KY is where I wanted to live all that doubt has been dispelled. The people there are incredible. I absolutely loved everyone I met. The simple act of sitting around in Nicole's house and talking politics over a beer, or relaxing in the park listing to the jazz and watching Kaiser try to steal a bone was immensely enjoyable. As Andrea pointed out to me, I have so many incentives to move down there as quickly as possible. I love the area, the people that I've met, the clean invisible air, and of course there is the beautiful Desha. :) On that subject, a big thank you goes to Andrea for introducing me to her. You were right.  Andrea was also right about something else. Revisiting the topic of women being attracted to bastards for a moment, that bastard DeAngelo was wrong after all! I have met women who are attracted and went after (and married) the nice guys. I had success with Desha while being my usually nice guy self. So DeAngelo was wrong... not all women are attracted to the bastards.  So that about covers my vacation. It's time to move along to the issues that I wanted to discuss during the week.  You know what? I'm too tired to write any more. LOL I'll add a second part to this to talk about politics and stuff after I've taken a nap. :)  See you all soon!
