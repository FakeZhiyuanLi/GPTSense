      3 Aug  Today I nearly quarreled with my service engineer.... it is such a sian day.... sighz  Sometime U dun like to tell other what to do...but if not when things happen all responisbilities fall onto the person in charge but when U tell people or even just remind people about it they take you in like shit.... like as if U dun know anything... but they never realised that if things happen the person in charge takes the entire blame due to his/her no matter who did it....  Sometime I so wish that I dun have to be that person to tell people off... when you are too good to people, too gracious to people, people take you for granted.... this is a dog eat dog world.... but how did this world become like that??? I guess deep down inside everyone would just say.... aiya it is bcos that person this that person that.... but the fingers are all appointing at ourselves.... :(  4 Aug  Today, Boss on MC.... counting down to my last day... another 7 more working days to go.... :P  Sometime I just hope that ah soon(my brother)didn't pass away. So that I can just be the little girl hiding under his care. But reality is very painful. After 2 year that he is gone, I am still having the impact that is as strong as it did on the day he pass away.... Life is already very very hard for everyone but what can be done? nothing... Everyday, you still have to go through the torment that comes along the way... Yah like all like to say.... think about the others who suffered more then U did and you do feel better.... but that doesn't solve any of the problems that you encounter with.... feeling better could only be the cure of the emotional struggles but physical all of us have to go through more...  I don't want to grow up but can I say no? I just want to go with my brother but what will happen to my two old folks? I have only got my eldest brother but is he lending me a hand? Can we actually, pull each other up after ah soon death so to help each other and sympathy with each other and care for each other after ah soon death? some time it is juct a one-sided thinking and hoping that things will turn out well....  See while, I am pointing one fingers at the wrongs of other.... the other 4 fingers are pointed directly at me.... sighz... I am just being a small like girl like everyone thinks I am...  5 Aug  nothing much to say... just sianz  7 Aug  Went to do a show at Zouk, for Jean Paul Gauliter.... under Guerlain makeup group.... met a couple of people but most important saw the guy model who looks like Adam Chen from Channel U.... He remembered me.... so cute... but just couldn't recall where we met... When I told him that we met during the Levi's show at Hereen....  He springs up.... O yah... kekkekekee.... got his name (Brant) but also found out that he's girlfriend was in the show too... sighz... all these good looking guys all got girlfriends..... or some boyfriends.... I think my taste for guys are either attached, married or gays.... kekekkekeee... but nevertheless, I got his mobile no... hahhahaha... dun think I will call... but anyway sure bound to meet him 2 weeks later... hopefully, I will be in the next fashion week sponsired by Guerlain... then I get to see Emily (one of my favourite model) and the rest and also Brant.... hehehehheee... O not forgetting the fun and crazy brunch of makeup Artist whom I work with  8 Aug  woke up at 11 plus... slept at 3pm last nite bcos was watching Joe Cheng on Azio TV.... He is so cute and cool.... I think I really like this cute guy... but too bad he is just a far away (in Taiwan) dream.... I think I kind of like guys would are shy but cool, dun really care but know how to dress, simply aborable and with good height....hahahhaaa I think I am still a kid but a old kid.... :P
