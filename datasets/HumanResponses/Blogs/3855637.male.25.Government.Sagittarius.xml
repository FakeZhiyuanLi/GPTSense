      Well this thing keeps going, and unfortunately for the Democratic Convention, the most exciting part so far has been the Bill O’Reilly/Michael Moore Debate.&nbsp; And even that was a flop.&nbsp; O’Reilly didn’t keep Moore on track, and O’Reilly wasn’t as “pithy” as usual.&nbsp; Moore kept pressing home that question of, “Would you send your children to Iraq to fight against a dictator?”&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  The answer to that question is a simple no.&nbsp; I mean Bill was on the right track by saying that he would sacrifice himself to fight the “30 brutal dictators” in this world, or would send himself to liberate and conquer Fallujah, but he didn’t get the right point across.&nbsp; The real answer comes to me from the lessons my father taught me so long ago.&nbsp; Your children make up their own minds; they are their own people, so if they want to join the military, and take the chance at being sent to war and die in the process that is their choice.&nbsp; I would support them whole heartedly, but what parent in their right mind would send their child off into danger?&nbsp; I think Michael Moore’s question is getting old; he needs to find a new question to ask everyone.  On another note…  I thought that John Edwards was the breath of fresh air that John Kerry really needed.&nbsp; He’s young, he’s enthusiastic, he’s charismatic, all of the characteristics that Kerry himself is lacking.&nbsp; Then after listening to him speak you realize just how little experience Edwards has.&nbsp;   He is a first term Senator, who most likely was not going to be reelected.&nbsp; His speech was nostalgic with his “Two Americas” theme that made him so famous and nearly won him the nomination.&nbsp; He of course tweaked this theme a bit to match the theme of the Kerry Campaign.&nbsp; What sets him out as inexperienced are his empty promises.&nbsp;   His speech last night was full of ideas which he did not (and probably cannot) back up with facts on how to carry out these ideas. &nbsp;How does this demonstrate his inexperience you ask?&nbsp; Well truth be told his campaign for Senate was evidently filled with these same types of empty promises.&nbsp; And because he did not follow up on these promises he most likely was not going to get reelected.&nbsp; See Edwards is a trial lawyer by nature, he knows how to talk the talk, but when it comes to walking the walk, he seems to falter a bit.&nbsp; I have to give him credit though, he is the nominee for Vice President, and he definitely has a lot of time to prove me wrong, he really could be the shining star.  Where he also fell short is that he just couldn’t live up to his hype last night.&nbsp; Mainly because the Democrats allowed the Reverend Al Sharpton to hijack the national spotlight last night.&nbsp; He rolled into the Bush bashing, and went off on a tirade.&nbsp; I won’t really say more than he hijacked the stage and stepped off the agenda, not to mention his prepared remarks.&nbsp; I won’t say more than that, because mainly I have a personal dislike for Al Sharpton, and this is not the time to get into that, I will save that for another blog at another time. Speaking of hijacking this election, who exactly is running for president, George Bush and John Kerry, or their daughters?&nbsp; Although it would be interesting to see who exactly would win the popular vote in that category, Cate Edwards could definitely throw a wrench in everyone’s plans.&nbsp;&nbsp; But I digress…

        So we live in a free society you say?&nbsp; The reality of it all is that we live in a free society with limitations.&nbsp;   So you are innocent until proven guilty you say?&nbsp; The reality of it all is that you are PRESUMED innocent until proven guilty.&nbsp; So yes, you may in fact be guilty; however we would have to pretend that you are innocent until convicted by a jury of your peers or otherwise admitting to your crime.   So we are under the rule of a democracy you say?&nbsp; We really live in a republic.&nbsp; A Democracy is when we really have a say in how our government is run, what laws we want and each of us has a say in how things are run.&nbsp; We are a republic; we elect people to represent us in the government, to make the decisions for us.&nbsp;   You must believe in something because the people who elected you believe in that you say?&nbsp; Why not run on what you believe, and if the people don’t agree then you will lose your election.&nbsp; Why be fake?&nbsp; Why lie to yourself, to your constituents, to me?&nbsp;   Getting back to those limitations, if I have to stand in line for an hour to get on a plane, I won’t complain because at least then I know I should be safe in that tube with wings.&nbsp; Or at least as safe as you can be in a tube with wings that is flying at a billion miles per hours tens of thousands of feet in the air.   I did it, but I did it because society made me do it, society is why I turned out like this, you say…&nbsp; Why in the hell can’t you take responsibility for your own actions?&nbsp; I didn’t mean to kill this guy, but I was on drugs and the drugs made me do it.&nbsp; Why not say, hey, I was the dumbass that took drugs, I was the dumbass that killed that person, and I am the dumbass who can’t take responsibilities for my own actions.   What is the meaning of is anyway?&nbsp; Is that why he can’t say I am sorry?&nbsp; I mean come on, do you need me to buy you a dictionary.&nbsp; Just say I’m sorry I lied to the country and the world, just say I’m sorry I betted on baseball, just say I’m sorry I misled stockholders so I could make a measly 5,000 dollars.&nbsp; If any of those statements had been uttered none of those people would have gotten in that mess.&nbsp; Which reminds me of that previous paragraph…&nbsp; It was a right-wing conspiracy that caused me to not have sex with that woman, Miss Lewinsky, it was a right wing experience that caused me to get caught, it is a right wing conspiracy that the definition of is, is not clear, and it’s a right wing conspiracy that I can’t take responsibility for my own actions…   Can anyone else add to this list you say?&nbsp; Of course they can…

       Well my plans are foiled once again.&nbsp; I was going to write a little piece on how St. Louis is the greatest baseball town in America, and how well my lovable Cardinals are doing, but I just can’t draw myself away from the Democratic National Convention.&nbsp;   I just can’t help myself, but I really get into politics, especially in an election year.&nbsp; So I couldn’t help myself and I had to watch some of the DNC, even though I promised myself that I would not allow it to influence my vote come November.&nbsp; I try to stick with the issues and I try to keep away from the emotional outbursts which always seem to occur during the conventions, but I have to say that thus far I am a bit disappointed with the “love fest” which is supposed to be occurring in Boston this week.   Al Gore is obviously still bitter over losing the election in 2000, and what’s more important, he must not have gotten the memo about the love fest agenda. &nbsp;This is obviously why he did not make the prime time list of speakers.&nbsp;   I don’t know what bugs me more about Al Gore, his condescending attitude when he speaks or is less that passionate style of speaking.&nbsp; I honestly get angry when I hear him speak, and then the lack of the love fest attitude just sent me over the edge.&nbsp; See, I may be a bit conservative, I can honestly say that I am one of those folks who is still undecided in this election, and that is exactly what the Democrats are looking for.&nbsp; Let’s face it, John Kerry is running a bit of a lackluster campaign thus far.&nbsp; He has raised a lot of money, and he is really just now kicking off his campaign, but he is still in a dead heat with the President with a couple of months to go still.&nbsp;   So the Kerry/Edwards campaign has decided, let us not divide, let us unite, and just tell the people how great we are and why we should be elected to office.&nbsp; Then comes along Al Gore and his “Bash Bush” attitude, luckily for the Democrats at the convention the evening ended with William Jefferson Clinton.&nbsp; He did what you were supposed to do, remain dignified, take a couple of quite jabs at the current administration, and then tell the people that John Kerry is the key which can unlock the potential of the nation.   I must say that I was deeply impressed with President Clinton.&nbsp; Although I never voted for him, and I never really agreed with most of his agenda, I was always impressed with is charisma, his passion and his ability to get across his message without tearing down his opponent.&nbsp; He definitely left you feeling good about the Democratic candidate.&nbsp; This was their agenda, and Bill Clinton hit the bull’s eye, Al Gore missed the boat.&nbsp; For me, Al Gore’s speech went over about as well as John Kerry’s first pitch in Fenway on Sunday; it bounced before it ever made it to the plate.&nbsp;   We still have two days left; we still have to hear from Edwards tomorrow and Theresa Heinz Kerry tonight.&nbsp; I guess they still have time for the love fest, but hopefully Theresa doesn’t blow it (or shove it) tonight and I hope that Howard Dean does not go off on a tirade.&nbsp;   Ah yes, and people wonder why those of us so enjoy watching the DNC and the RNC hold their conventions.&nbsp; Without a doubt they always leave you wanting more.&nbsp; Makes me wonder what message John Kerry will be delivering, I for one hope that he sticks on the agenda and keeps up the love fest.&nbsp; If the Bush Bashing keeps, certainly the Kerry Campaign stands to lose a lot of hoped for support from those undecideds.&nbsp;

      Ah yes the season of politics is upon us.&nbsp; With glee I look forward to the next two weeks of political conventions kicking off.&nbsp; Today the Democratic National Convention will kick off with a bang.&nbsp; Fortunately my busy schedule will keep me from being glued to the TV, it will spare me from having to listen to Sen. Clinton speak about how great her husband, President Emeritus Clinton is.&nbsp; Then we’ll have to listen to the President Emeritus speak about how great John Kerry is.&nbsp;   What do I say to all of this?&nbsp; I like to take a quote from Theresa Heinz Kerry… Shove it.&nbsp; Not that next week will be much better.&nbsp; Everyone will gloat, everyone will talk highly of themselves, and we’ll all be happy that our candidate looked/sounded/was so good on TV.&nbsp; John Kerry goes to the Red Sox vs. Yankees game and throws out the first pitch (or should I say lobs it like a football and bounces it to home plate) for his favorite baseball team.&nbsp; He wouldn’t miss this for the world he says, but when asked who his favorite player for the Red Sox was, he replied, “Manny Ortez”.&nbsp; So just who does Manny Ortez play for anyway?  This, of course, is reminiscent of President Bush throwing out the first pitch of the Cardinals game on opening day.&nbsp; Bush, however, made the pitch a perfect strike, and it never bounced once.&nbsp; Ugh.&nbsp; However, with the wait to get into the stadium, there were quite a few people who didn’t get to witness this historic event in St. Louis.&nbsp; Of course, since St. Louis is the greatest baseball city in the world, most people felt it an honor to have a sitting president throw at the first pitch of the season.&nbsp; Moreover, I would be willing to bet that President Bush’s favorite baseball player is Albert Pujols.&nbsp; Well maybe we’ll stick with Scott Rolen, I’d be afraid how the President would butcher the name Pujols.&nbsp;   While I’m on the topic, just where does the Green Party hold it’s convention?&nbsp; And which team will be the first to invite Ralph Nader to throw out a first pitch?  And is baseball our national pastime once again?&nbsp; I mean I know that baseball has always been the favorite pastime for St. Louisans, is it tops on the national spotlight once again as well?&nbsp; I mean how many presidents/presidential candidates have flipped the coin, dropped the puck, or tipped off the basketball?&nbsp;   I guess that leads me into my next article.&nbsp; Why St. Louis is the best baseball town in the world…

      	This is definitely a place where you can vent your thoughts or feelings, or just write whatever you want.  I would guess that the possibilities are endless.  You could write your novel, or write your diary, or just sit and write all you want.  I have yet to have much of a chance to really look deeply into the blog list, but I am sure that over time I will look into it and check things out and see what other people are writing.  I probably will also have to make some comments so that people will come to my blog and make comments on my writings.  	So why am I here?  That’s rather simple; I wanted a place where I can keep my observances.  See, I am an observer; I love to watch people, watch crowds and so on.  I like to watch people and try to figure out what they are thinking.  I try to look at events and try to figure out how people got in those situations.  I like to try and figure these things out and then I like to give my own opinion.    	There is a columnist in my local paper that I enjoy reading quite a bit.  I definitely don’t always agree with him, but I enjoy the way he writes.  He confuses people, gives them something to talk about and he can really give you a good rip and leave you smiling at yourself because you don’t really realize that you’ve been ripped.  But he also makes observances, he comments on them and then he moves onto his next subject.  This is what I plan to do with my blog.  I am just going to put my daily (or semi-daily) musings on the goings on of the world, the things I observe, and whatever else strikes my fancy.  Hopefully, at some point, you, the reader, will engage me in a nice conversation on the topics of the day/week/month.    I am also the type that writes so that I have something to read in the future.  So you may notice that at times I returned and changed wording, or whole paragraphs.  I am very critical of myself and my writing, so I am never satisfied with “good enough” I always find fault with something I wrote, or my views change, so it is often that I return to what I wrote and rewrite it.    I am firm in my values and so those don’t usually change, however as time goes by, I learn more information, or I age, my views my change.  So, my next installment will be more on a general topic, and probably more lengthy.  Hopefully in the near future I too will have at least five dedicated readers.

       It is Friday the 13th.  Why does everyone make such a big deal about Friday the 13th.  What the hell is wrong with Friday the 13th?  My wife’s favorite number is 13, she loves Friday the 13th.  For me, well I enjoy Saturday the 14th.   I work for the government, and for anyone that deals with people for a living Friday the 13th is really a bad day.  It really does draw out all of the nuts.  Speaking of nuts, I bet my neighbor will cut his grass today…  I have big plans tonight.  I am going to bottle wine.  As a quick background, I love wine.  I love to smell it, I love to drink it, I love to cook with it…  OK so maybe not the whole cooking part, how about I love to eat food that was cooked in it.  So I decided to make my own wine.  So far I have made a strawberry wine, and a merlot, that is pretty weak, but growing stronger with time.  Tonight, I am helping a friend who also made wine, but he’s never bottled it, so I will assist him with that tonight, especially because I have the bottle corker.   Just as a weather update, it was 52 stinking degrees this morning.  What the hell is Mother Nature thinking?  Did she get a cold and is trying to freeze out her fever?  Is she just plain stupid and forgot that it is August?  I mean I don’t want the hot weather, but again I wouldn’t mind so much if it was just a teency bit warmer.   Tomorrow I won’t complain at all.  We have volunteered to go over to my mother-in-law’s house and clean out the basement.  I won’t complain if it is cool.  Somehow someone got a pool table into that basement, and somehow we’ve got to get that thing out of there…  And here’s a little secret for you.  Don’t tell my wife… but I can’t wait to find out what kind of treasures are down there.  Who knows what evil lurks in the basement of the mother-in-law, after all it WILL be Saturday the 14th :)

       We made salsa last night.  That is not a very gratifying process, let me tell you.  First you take about a million tomatoes, and you peel and slice them and then you put all of these tomatoes in a pot and you boil them and you add your ingredients and when you are all done, all your hard work and sweat is complete, you can it and voila, you have half a jar of salsa.   I mean, what the hell, you work pretty hard, and for what?  I could probably finish it off all by myself.  But I digress…  So the weather here has been BEAUTIFUL.  It was only about 72 degrees yesterday, and they are saying a high of 68.  Its August, 68 degrees should be the low, but I am far from complaining that is for sure.  Last night before making salsa I went into my freshly cut back yard and tossed the ball for the Wondermutt, and he never got tired, I never got bit by a mosquito, he let the little girl next store throw the ball a few times, we all were happy.   So I don’t get this whole global warming thing.  If the globe is warming up, if the polar ice caps are melting, then why in the world is it 68 degrees in the Midwest in the middle of August?  Wouldn’t that be global cooling?  Can you imagine my electric bill if I could get rid of the AC.  I love this, although today it is almost too cool.  If we had 68 degree weather in December I’d be OK, used to the coolness, but in summer, I get cold, like a little old lady I want to get our my blanket, lay on the couch and watch Wheel of Fortune.  Also been watching the news lately and see these great hurricanes are hitting Florida…  Is it hurricane season already, can someone fill me in, I get confused, but is this really hurricane season, or is this just something that is weird.  I am supposed to be in Orlando in two weeks, and I want to make sure that the tube with wings doesn’t fall out of the sky because some freak hurricane hits the coast of Florida.  Can someone explain this to me?  If it’s not hurricane season will someone inform the National Weather Service or the National Hurricane Union to leave Florida the hell alone.  If it is Hurricane season, just let me know what months fall under this Hurricane season category…  By the way I have found some new favorite blogs, I have really been reading a lot of them lately.  As soon as I figure out how to post my favorite blogs I will share them with the world!!!!

       Yeah, OK so I went home to cut my grass right after work.  But I’ve got to figure out why it takes me cutting the grass to realize that most of it is dead already.  Granted, I live in the city, so it’s not like I have the largest yard in the world, I spend all of 30 minutes trimming and cutting it, and if you’re lucky (which you weren’t last night) I sweep up my clippings.   But for the love of God, with the exception of a 4 foot by 4 foot section of the yard (which grows like fungus on cow dung) my grass is dead.  We get a lot of clover in the front yard, and last year I went to battle with it, I bought special spray, sprayed it on the yard and voila, the clover was dead.  Alas, my attempt was foolish, because the grass too was dead and so my whole damned yard was BROWN.   So this year the clover can grow unafraid of being sprayed, but come September, new seed is going down, and by George, I am going to water it until the damn stuff takes root.  I’m not going to give up this time.   But I digress, most likely I will lose the battle next year as well because I am lazy, I only water the grass when I really look at it, notice most of it is brown or covered in clover.  Plus the grass (I have been told) is competing for water with the three rather large Oak Trees in the front yard, so that too may be a good reason my grass dies.   Of course, reading this you probably think I am nuts about my grass, but in all reality, I am not.  My neighbor on the other hand IS nuts about his grass, his section of the street, his driveway, and anything that is outside.   This is pretty much how his grass cutting day goes, (with a very small yard it takes him from dawn till dusk to cut his lawn.  So without a doubt he picks the Saturday that I can actually sleep in without a worry in the world to get up at the butt-crack of dawn to cut his grass.   He begins with the almighty gas powered trimmer/weed whacker.  Without a doubt this was the best most expensive piece of lawn equipment man can buy.  It needs only one pull to start the sucker, because I am sure that my ever diligent neighbor has tweaked that thing every time he pulls it out of the garage.  He trims with a vengeance, he keeps the line straight, steps back to admire his work, hits that one shard of grass that he missed and keeps going.  This will continue for the next two hours, front and back, working up a sweat, until he is satisfied.  Shutting the thing down at least 10 times to tighten this or check his trimmer cord, but all goes well.  Much to his chagrin I am sure.  Next comes the gas blower.  Again, fist pull starts right up, but something doesn’t sound right, so he turns it off, tinkers with it, and then proceeds to blow the grass off his driveway, off the street, and off the grass (you heard me correctly) and into the sewer.  Again at least another hour and 30 minutes.   Now comes the lawn mower, cutting ever so diligently, making sure his pattern is varied from the last time, not to keep the grass growing in one direction, again shutting it down often, making sure all is well with the workings of the motor.   Again with the blower for another hour and 30 minutes to blow away all that is left behind by the mower.  And now the crème de la crème… the POWER WASHER (HOO HOO HOO!).   Ah, yes the power washer, so we power wash the driveway, we power wash the street, we power wash the sewer, we power wash the sidewalk, we power wash the air, we power wash our feet, we power wash the dog, we power wash the walls, we power wash the blinds in the house hanging on a string in the front yard, we power wash, well you get the idea.   And then we take apart the lawn mower and we power wash that too.  Ah yes, the dirty lawn mower is the devil’s workshop.  We put the lawn mower back together and just as the sun sets we light up the old barbeque grill.  Yes the same barbeque that we used to cook the turkey on Thanksgiving, the same barbeque we taught the sun how to start so that we can grill when we get home.   At some point I think I realized that maybe he doesn’t like his wife, I mean all this time outside, maybe he doesn’t get along with her, and he’s keeping his sanity.  Maybe he just likes to be alone; maybe idle hands are the devil’s workshop.   And am I annoyed by all of this you ask?  No, intrigued is the word for it.  I watch with amusement, and I look forward to Saturday, because I am sure that this will continue.  So with a mixture of all of this and the fact that he has no Oak trees, his yard is better than mine… maybe I will water the lawn again tonight…

       OK, so I haven’t been the best blogger in the world.  I mean I had originally set up a blog as kind of my journal, and it turned into a political rant about the convention.  So maybe I will leave that other blog alone.  I will wait until the RNC comes around and rant about that too.   This spot I will reserve for me.  My place to make daily thoughts come to life by putting them on paper…  My place to keep a journal, my place to write down what’s happening in my life, my place to jot down thoughts and then be able to reflect on them...   I was never good at keeping a journal because I always felt you had to hand write it and the first time my hand cramped I just felt as if I didn’t need that hand cramp and so I quit.  So I guess I will be more likely to keep up with this blog, this rant of mine, this place to put the happenings of my life, my thoughts.   I’ve been inspired because I have been reading other people’s blogs, seeing just how dedicated they all are, and I figure, what the heck I can share this with people too.  I’ll try to keep the politics on that blog, and my daily happenings on this blog.  Besides where has the time gone?  I mean the days have flown by since I last blogged, and I think it is because I didn’t know what to write next. I have always felt that journaling should just be the free flow of writing that spews forth when you clear your mind, and that other blog became something I really sat down and thought about.   I want a spot where I can have diarrhea of the keyboard, and just let things flow.  So here goes, what ends up here nobody knows, except I hope no politics ends up here, that’ll be saved for my other blog.   So what about me?  I am 25, happily married and have a dog.  That’s about it for me.  Big plans for the married, dog owner/homeowner…  Cut the grass, yes this is my exciting life for Tuesday.  Wait till you hear about my exciting life for Wednesday…
