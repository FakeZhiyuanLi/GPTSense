       I saw a few friends' blog and was so inspired to write something that i decided to pen it now here in this bloggy thingy....it's interesting...(in fact, i wanted to email my recent thoughts and happenings into a email to all my poly friends...I lurvve to use that as a medium to express my feelings, but just felt that this blog may be more ideal now since my hellokitty email always give me shity problems with the shity server)      I havent met up with my polymates for a long time...and i missed out on a lot of gatherings..and you know what, when i saw from all of your blogs that you all met up on sat, i felt so out ...but, i also know the reason why you gals didn't ask me out...its ok..its just me feeling a bit sensitive, but I understand..      Oh Ya! That reminds me! Thanks for all those who remembered my birthday and sent me those sweet birthday smses...I'm reallie reallie happy to receive it. ANd thanks for the bday present...we meet up soon, i hope.       Recently, my younger sis is not feeling very well and this matter struck me with many thoughts. My life seems to change all of a sudden..or in fact, my family members' lives all took a change to adjust to my sis's illness. In fact, she was rather ok after 2 weeks of medication..but recently, about a week back, she had a relapse. I went on a one-week leave and my older sis + my parents also spent more time at home to accompany her...the only wish now is to see her recover completely. Even if its means not going to work, not acheiving my sales figures, constant stress from boss, not meeting my boyfriend for 1 month, not going out with friends and not celebrating my 23rd birthday. Even if at the expense of lost sleep, praying all day, being patient and bearing (which i am not known for, obviously) and waking up at 3am to check on her.    As long as she gets well, gets back to the old happy Esther we all know, we are all prepared for all the sacrifices.       Well, this ordeal ties me and my family so close now that nothing can breaks us anymore. My dad brought us to parks and nature reserves to de-stress and yummy dinners on sundays. My mum cooked nice home cooked food for us everyday. Now, my elder sis sleeps with me and Esther every night..and yup..Jia Jia as well.       Today is National Day...So Happy 39th Birthday, Singapore! and Happy Birthday to Granny too! Haha..its my granny's birthday...we will be going to her place later...hmmm can't wait to see the awesome spread that they will prepare for dinner.    Going back work tomorrow..How fast a week has passed! Hope that i can still make it in time for my sales figures for this month. Well, whatever lah!       Oops..suddenly lost my train of thoughts and now, my mind is kind of stuck in thinking on what to write..well, maybe its time for me to stop. Yup, yup its 12.30pm. indeed, i should stop now..Gotta eat lunch now. Jamata!!       p.s: Friends, i cut my hair again....not trim, its cut...Back to the short bob now..

       I was suprised, touched and guilty to see Dorling's and Minghui's comments. Suprised at the quick response. Touched that you all had been so caring. Guilty because of what i wrote that makes Minghui feel guilty.  Sorries, my gals..But no worries, I really really understand about the sat thingy...I mean, i can't make it anyway. I just add it in so that i can get it off my chest. But, pls pls dun feel guilty. I know you all care. Because Dorling mentioned that you all suggested bringing my sis to church-which means that you all have cared. That means so much to me. Thanks...  This blog is so fun! But, I can't seem to load any pics or music into my blog. It looks so plain and boring as compared to Minghui's and Xuelin's. Got nice templates and nice music. Can teach me??  By the way, if I want to reply to the comments, do i do a posting in my blog or in the commentor's blog? or do i just need to add another comment? Is this the way to do it? Guess its ok la..No hard and fast rule. My blog is my blog...why care? Hahaha!!! But, feels funny, replying comments in a new posting...cheezz  I do regret a bit over my new hairstyle...but, chey, hair is growing at every second. So, before you know it, haha, i am back to my signature shoulder length, rebonded, side fringe cover half an eye look..Hee hee..When we meet up, you all can see my new hairstyle.
