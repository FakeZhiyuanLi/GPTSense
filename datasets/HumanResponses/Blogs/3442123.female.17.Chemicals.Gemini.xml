      It's Memorial day today!! AHH!  Tomorrow it will be JUNE!!  The first month of summer! woot woot  RFH has school today, b/c we used up too many snow days.  We have a 1/2 day, and we're not doing anything in school..that's why I'M STAYING HOME! woot...lol Actually, my school adopted a platoon in Iraq, and we're supposed to spend the day putting together care-packages and writing letter to them.  I don't feel guilty about missing all of that, b/c i donated some money to the platoon a week ago.  So I'm guilt free!  So if you read this, and you wanna do something while some of my other classmates are at school, give me a call.  Alright, it's like 7 in the morning and i decided to type cuz i've got insomnia.    Later  xox

       THE BEACH CLUB OPENED TODAY!!   Today was soo awesome!  I got together with the usual gang (except Christina..we miss you!)..and we all went down and hung out.  Tiffany flipped me over when she thought i was cheating at Egyptian Ratscrew..I'm still a bit sore from that one..  So I'm currently watching Degrassi, for what reason..I do not know.  My brother just called and asked for my mom.  I had to put the phone down to go get her, and when I came back he was gone..that loser.  I don't care what anyone says, but I am soooo incredibly excited for the new Harry Potter movie to come out! I'm such a Harry Potter freak, but I love the books and the movies!  The movies put an end to the everlasting debate of how to pronounce Hermione..hahaha  Alright, so i'm gonna jet, i'll talk to ya later-  xox

      Hey ya'll..  Today my dad had his surgery..his "nose job" as i call it.  In reality, he had a shit load of polyps in his nose by his brain or something, so he had to have that shat removed - yea...nasty  My sister was complaining that my brother ate part of her sandwhich wrap, and took the larger 1/2.  When she confronted her about it, he thought it was funny to pretend to shoot her with his paintball gun.  So, i just sat there and laughed, naturally.  My grams sent me and my sister all sorts of jewelry and like 8 REALLY COOL PURSES! HELLZ YEA!  My sister only likes 2 of then, so i get the other 6! woot-woot!  I have to call Mrs. Pritchard and tell her that i can't babysit on Saturday night b/c i didn't realize i had already promised a friend that i would do something else with them like a week ago...be right back  Ok, i'm back! So Saturday..the beach opens! I AM SO EXCITED!!!!  Also there are only 10 days left until I get my license! Can you believe it!?!  Tomorrow i'll be in the  single digits !!!  Alright, I gotta go..until next time  xox

      Current Status: Babysitting  So I'm watching Amie over at the Pritchards right now, not really sure what to do with myself.  She and a few friends are out on the trampoline..I should probably be watching them, but i don't see the need..hehe  I had my "Welcoming Committe Interview" today.  They asked me a bunch of stellar questions.  I don't understand why the process for joining this committee is so extensive, am I going to corrupt an incoming freshman by showing them around the school?? -oh, you know me..  I also sort of cameup with this idea for a special needs program over at the school..so i hope that gets off the ground  I just realized that i am extremely alone in this house with the exception of the cat and the 100 yr old great grandma upstairs..so i'm gonna go! ttyl xox  -leave one

      Wow, i'm updating again, aren't you in luck!?!? I just got home from school, and without lacrosse I have no idea what to do with myself except EAT, EAT, EAT!!!  It's not an amazingly stellar hobby, like saving the rainforest, but it gets me through the afternoon.  So today I didn't have to go to gym, instead all the junior went to the community room and watched a movie about bullies.  The jist of it was...if you're a bully, then you will forever burn in hell! hehe..well, maybe the message wasn't quite that strong, but you should definetly PLAY NICE, ok!?!?  I'm thinking of going to get my cartilage pierced for my birthday, what does everyone think about that? Give me a little call..and tell me about it!  So guess who called me yesterday!!!  *music of anticipation*  GARY THOMPSON!  *end anticipation music* Oh, you read that right, Gary definetly called me.  For all of those who don't know what i'm talking about, you're a waste of space and should skip ahaed to the next paragraph right now! So yea, he called to talk about getting my license and what i need, and then he made some interesting comments about me..anyone who has had him as a driving instructor knows what i am referring to..lol   THIS IS WHERE THE LOSERS WHO KNOW NOTHING OF GARY THOMPSON SHOULD START READING!   Yea, basically this entry is over, and you just missed the best part if you skipped the previous paragraph.  I'm out..  -leave a comment if ur bold enough xox

      Alright, I know what you're thinking, but just hear me out.  I am aware that this is my 326813726387128th journal, but this one is for real, hehe.  It's free and I like it, so now you'll have to like it too.  So, there's only 13 days until my license..can I get a hallaluya!?!? (check the spellage on that one)  Prom was last Thursday, it was fun.  Then we went to post prom till 2, and then I went to Beau's till 4..when i finally just left and passed out at home.  The next day, having gotted 5 hrs of sleep, which is less than 1/2 the amount i normally need, I went to Sam's for breakfast.  After that, a bunch of us played beach volley ball, hung out at Kenzies, and topped it off with Lighthouse and Windmill..  All in all, not a bad start for the weekend.  However, the rest of my weekend consisted of hardcore sleepage..I could have outslept the best of 'em!  Ok, I know youre bored of me already, so I'll let ya go..  Until next time..

So tonight my cousin Julia is apparently coming, and I'm only just finding out now..way to inform me family! woot -  10 points for you guys!  However, I like my cousin, so I'm excited she's coming.  Today I'm going to go see  The Notebook  with a bunch of the beach crowd..yay! I've been waiting forever for it to come out, especially b/c sara got to see the advanced showing of it before it came out..that lucky beast  Tomorrow I'm going to the Dashboard Confessional Concert..HURRAY! I'm so excited!! hehe  We're trying to convince Mr. Weber to let Lauren, Sam, Tiffy and I take out their "live-in" sail boat on July 3rd for the fireworks.  We normally go out on the Whalens boat..but not this yr.  Last yr it was spoiled when a certain someone..drank a lil too much..*cough* you know who u r *cough* lol..and isn't allowed to bring her friends this yr!!   So anyway, we would be alone on the boat, and tied up with the Fowlers, Whalen's, and that whole crowd..lol  Alrighty, I've got to go, I'll talk to ya later, xox

       I quit the dohnut business today!  I'm SOOO HAPPY!  I handed Tammy a letter, telling her I was quitting and the reasons why..and then I ..ran out the door.  Lauren told me they all saw me running into traffic haha.  The reason I wrote a letter is b/c I have absolutely no idea how I would have been able to quit if I had to physicaly say something to Dominic and Tammy..It would have been to ackward.  Anyway, now that it's over..I can have a HUGE sigh of RELIEF!  I'm supposed to talk to some lady about scheduling for Hookline, so I'm excited for that.  Today is Father's Day, and my family is going to the beach for dinner.  I'm really, hungry, so i'm looking forward to it..a lot..hehe  Today I asked some man about biodigradable toothpaste and shampoo (for my Costa Rica trip, it's required)..and he looked at me real weird hehe  Okay, I'm gonna get goin..until you read again  xox

      Last night was such a surprise guys...hehe  Last night was my surprise party..thrown by my bff Katie.  She doesn't know my friends over at RFH, and so the group(s) that were there were sort of interesting, but i had soo much fun! I've never had a birthday party, b/c I'm usually grounded EVERY SINGLE YEAR on my birthday -  true story  -  The night was a success basically  So I applied for a job over at Hookline, i'm supposed to find out today if i get it or not..but shh! don't tell dunkin' dohnuts, i haven't stopped working there yet.  Tomorrow I'm going to visit my cousin Julia and family for her graduation up in North Jersey..congrats Julia!  I've really got nothing else to say, except for the fact that i was awesome at poker last night.   Until I type again.. xox

      As Christina and Sammay might say.."ehh, beat me off" - hahaha  So, summer is treating my very well.  I was soo jealous of Sam Drazin (and everyone else who got picked for the Riz tripped).  But, when i saw Sam packing, it made me realize that Costa Rica is coming soon!! AAAAHHH..okay, August 3rd is sorta far away, but still close!  Yesteday, tiffy took a gym exam over at RBR..a gym final?  Who does that?? hehe--i feel bad for ya tiff.  After that exam... tiff, connar, and myself felt it would be awesome to jump in the freeezing ocean! (well, it was more my idea hehehehe).  So we did, and it was surprisingly not bad, once we got past the "unable to breathe" part.  Anyway, I think i'm gonna get going..see you a la playa mis amigos!!!  Adios... xox

      Yesterday was supposed to be awesome, but it wasn't really.&nbsp; I really just had the absolute worst day of my life... &nbsp; I'm not gonna go into detail about everything cuz the entry would be too long. &nbsp; The jist of it was that i was unable to go to potpori b/c of a really retarded reason (not having my room clean until that afternoon...) and then i ended up finding out a bunch of bad&nbsp;news about several things... &nbsp; I eventually pissed off my mom so much she told me to just go cuz she didn't wanna see my face, and i really just can't express how horrible yesterday was.&nbsp; I wish i had the patience to type out all the crude details.. &nbsp; So i went to potpori and had fun, lol...so the night was fun, but the day SUCKED &nbsp; Alrighty, i gotta go- read me later...xox &nbsp;

I'm stoked, cuz theirs dancing hahaha.&nbsp; Sometimes it's gay, and sometimes its awesome, but i always have fun everytime, it's like tradition.    &nbsp;  ANYWAY...i've made you read enough for today...and i'm also going to change the time on the bottom of my journal to the East Coast time..b/c it's set in West Coast time.&nbsp;     &nbsp;  ttyl, xoxox

      So you know how it's been pouring all night? Yea..my brilliant brother left the sun roof open to his and my car last night! So I ran out this morning trying to figure out how to close the damn thing! (I never really knew, b/c since i've started driving it, the sun roof has never been closed.  It was always set that way)  So after the 3 minutes of pressing the button, I realized that I was pressing the wrong direction of the button, and that's why it wouldn't close haha.  SHOOT ME NOW  Anyway, So I'm out their drying this mofo off like it's my job, while JC does nothing.  Apparently he knew the roof was open, but didn't do anything about it.  Now the car is gonna smell like shit.  My friend Alexa left her roof open once when it rained, and she couldn't get rid of the mildew smell.  I was gagging everytime I got in the car  In otherwords..it's only 8:40 something  in the morning  and I'm soaked through from being outside...arghh haha   LAST NIGHT                 - So last night was the 4th of July, and I went to the beach all day.  Then I went home, and went to the Webers party.  Despues..we all walked down to the beach for the fire works.  We were all hanging out, and there were some new ppl there to- some of Tiffy's friends, and this kid Jake from Connecticut..I just refer to him as Connecticut, hehehehe  Anyway, So I got this new phone!  It's the new LG, it only came out like 4 days before I bought it.  It's got video recording capabilities and shizzz...and instead of having a real ring tone, I can record one of my own.  Anyway, I gotta go..until next time

      One month until Costa Rica! YAY! I'm so stoked, you have no idea.  I still have to do a shit load of stuff for the trip, theres so many things on the "official list of things to bring" that I don't have yet.  I'll probably take lauren this week to start our trip shopping...which in itself is very exciting! AHH!  Alright..So tonight are the fireworks over in red bank.  Each yr I go out on Christina's boat..but NOW I CAN'T...for reasons that only the beach crowd knows...and so now i don't know what we're going to do.   We were going to go out on Lauren's live-in sailboat and moore up with all of them, but now Mr. Weber thinks that it would be "un-doing" Christina's punishment if we went and spent the night.  It was going to be so sweet, cuz there weren't going to be any parents on our boat.  But now that's out.  Then, Mr. Weber said we could take their little speed boat out.. with him ...which wouldn't be as much fun.  Plus, we wouldn't be able to spend the night! However, this confuses me..b/c Mr. Weber thinks we're 'un-doing' her punishment by getting to go and spend time with her if we were to take the live-in sail boat...but.. Aren't we sort of 'un-doing' it by being there with him on the speed boat and not sleeping over.  I mean, we're spending time with her in either situation..and it's not like we're spending time with her when we're asleep...so he's sort of contradicting himself.  I love ya webco, but something is a lil screwy..  Anyway, I've gotta get going..happy 4th of July tomorrow!   xox
