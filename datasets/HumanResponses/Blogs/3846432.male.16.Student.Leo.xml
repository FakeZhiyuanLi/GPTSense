                   Well it's another day and another morning, one I hope will become more than it is. Right now I am just going to write down a few things on my mind. My G/F is at camp and I hope that she is having a great time wonder what she is up to but then again sometimes I feel like I dont want to know. I looked up the 173rd FALCON brigade yesterday they seem to be pretty neat, for those who dont know they are an airborne unit in the united states army, although airborne is not really my thing. I can not wait until I graduate highschool, there are some many things I am going to do. I am definately going to college and while I am in college I will be associated with ROTC hopefully passing it all with honours and then into the army. Where I hope AOP places me into mechanized infantry so I can work with Hummers. I am going to a civil war reenactment this weekend, this should be neat, always fun to watch. well I am off to find some chow. Have a good day.

      Well today what have I done? nothing and a whole lot of it. I do have football practice tonight for two hours but that isnt what I really want to be doing with my summer, ever since school has been out and even while it was going on I have been prepping myself for the upcoming football season and I can't wait for it but all I seem to do now a days is be tired and and lift/condition. My grandparents did come visit last week for a couple of days but we didn't do anything out of the ordinary except eat out at ruby tuesday's on thursday but that wasn't anything new.  Although for not feeling like I am doing alot I have done a good deal of work this summer: mowing 3 yards which consume almost 17 hours of my week, working on our newly aquired land about 5 hours a week ( and all I do is clear brush, weed eat the drive path, and cut up trees ), then I spend sunday mornings and eveninings at church which is fun prolly about at the most 4 1/2 hours a week, and then out side of all that I go to lifting/conditioning for football for about 2 hours every evening. But really it's not that bad because I get paid for the work and the lifting pays off in the end but I want more time for the movies and hanging/partying. Finishing thought right now is : I really want to learn to ride a horse and I cant wait till I can be in ROTC!

      Hello,       This is my BLOG - Nothing special and it was meant to be that way. For those of you who visit hope you gain something. The main reason for this BLOG is because I dont have time to keep a journal mainly too lazy and journals aren't what I spend my time doing, as in I spend alot of time on the computer and enjoy it so it makes sense that here is where I would keep a journal.      I enjoy order but I love chaos ( especially when its my doing!!! ). Those who know me wouldn't mention that and maybe they dont pay attention to that detail but its a vital part of me. I love many things in life and respect alot of other aspects of it; such as my G/F she means the world to me but her parents are very strict- I respect that they dont want her and I to be together or around each other or having fun with each other but I do contradict that through being around her and trying to be some type of B/F to her. Overall I think I am a very nice out going guy, I do have bad aspects ,like everyone, although for the most part I try to be a person others would like to       themselves after in my character. I look at myself to be very chivilarous and also extremely involved with my studies outside of school and also my friends lives. Now anyone who knows me should know that few people get to be my Friends and i make it this way because of trust, you see it is very important to me that I have a circle of people that can be trusted rather than just have fun with but thats not to say I dont have aquintances I dont enjoy being around for the most part though I try to limit the amount of people who really know me for who I am.
