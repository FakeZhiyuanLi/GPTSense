      Once upon a time, people said I was going to hell.  Now they tell me that I'm nice, but that I'm severely insane.  Oh, and some say I'm the spawn of Satan.  Yippee.  This is why I don't talk to too many people in a kindly fashion.  Oy.  Goodbye.

      I actually have no idea why I'm doing this.  Goddamn boredom.  Yessss...  So i have a choir concert friday...  yes... Whatever.  I'm done for today.  I'm never going to remember i did this....   And I don't even see the use for a blog.  i mean, seriously, telling people all over the place about how i fell, etc?  Or what I think?  Who the fuck cares about how i think?  Or anything about me, is that important?  Stupid blog  ....  Didn't i say i was done a while back?   FUCKER!

She's bringing her boyfriend and  his 13 year old nephew along with her.  oy.  meh.    ok, goodbye

      I backed into another car yesterday during the neighborhood garage sale.  And everybody in my family had a feeling it would happen.  Not that I comletely believe in that psychic stuff.  It's more like common sense.  Nothing good lasts forever.  You're never completeley safe.  Every once in a while, that expectation surfces to your head, and until that something bad happens, you just have that feeling.  God, now the family owes so much money, and we only just baught a new building.  The buissiness hasn't even started yet, and I'm leeching more money than I already was about to do.  I was born in the year of the rabbit.  That's supposed to fuckin' mean that I'm lucky.  But no, I'm not.  I have the worst frickin' luck in my family.  Bumps and bruises, scars... Well, I suppose I'm lucky that they're not all that visible unless I'm under high physical stress.  Or unless I've been drinking...  Oh well.  We're all doomed in the end.  Death.  We don't know it, so it draws us to it.  Through fear or whatever.   It's almost beautiful.   It's a wonder about how beautiful death and pain could be sometimes. Amazing.  a child dead in his or her sleep, blood gushing from your fingers after a paper cut, or something...  it's almost lulling.  Blood is so red and bright.  Not that I would do anything insane to see tht type of beauty.  But it's there, whether you think so or not.  the human body is beautiful, touch is beautiful, pain; or rather, the feeling after the pain is gone, is beautiful...  meh.  goodbye

      i realize that my "name" thing is kinda wierd.  why not explain why it is there, while I wait for my friend to come over and save me from the mass amounts of children over at the pool, just waiting to suck my blood?  When i was two, my mom was caramelizing some sugar, which involves putting sugar in a pot, essentially, and melting it or something.  i was sitting in the kitchen playing, and my mom was moving the pot somewhere.  My mom has polio on her left arm, however, so it was quickly losing it's hold.  She spilled the stuff on the floor, and a bit of it (luckily, only a couple of drops) got on me.  So now i have this small scar on my left cheek that turns red under too much physical stress.  It's all very interesting...    Yeah, so We're just having fun pretty much right now.  And i am bored to death.  Goodbye.

      Four finals down, three more to go.  Jesus, I'm fucked.  i just hope I don't get any f's.  That would suck ass.  i'd have to spend my senior year taking those fucking classes all over again instead of doing what I wanted to do.  Two more days... I'm dying.  I need to get out before I kill myself.  a number of my better friends graduated this weekend.  i'm already feeling more exposed.  It feels great, except not.  This guy I dated for a while was at several of the same parties as me... he's a thespian too.  I tried talking to him and it was all cool, because I stil kinda like him, i guess.  But I put him through too much shit for him to be able to forgive me, and so the best I can do is act like I'm not really, really pissed at myself right now.  So I'm moving on.  But it's hard when he's there, laughing (in a nice way) at my lack of ability at fooseball, or watching my other classmates playing video games while I run my hands through his hair (hey! my friend was playing with my other ex's hair!... god, that sounds wierd.  but hey, It's a dysfunctional group)...  I should probably control myself better.  He's not even cute, really.  nice, yes.  Smart, very.  he's so goddamn smart, i feel like I'm nothing just talking to him.  But he can make me feel like I'm better than him when he wants to.  That was nice, when he did it.  Now I can only kinda touch him.  things get wierd when I'm behind him, running my hands through his hair like I'm fascinated by how curly it is, all the while hoping that he'll tell me to either back off, or that he gives a shit about me.  Because he's said nothing either way.  he won't tell me he's pissed, he won't tell me he's ok.  And yet so many times in the school hallway, he tries to go in the opposite direction of me, whether or not there's ten more yards to go before we actually pass each other.  Why the fuck won't he ust tell me to fuck off?  Because, man, i need a reality check.  i'm going crazy.  I really llike him.  and of course, being the fucker that I am, I screwed things up.  figures.  Meh.  I just gotta worry about school right now.  Forget him.  he's just a guy.  I'm too young to worry about guys right now.  Grades.  Geeze, if I get an f...  Ok, then.  too much self pity in this entry.  Whoever reads this is gonna love that...  but who reads this piece of crap blog anyway?

      I've gotten into this whole working habit lately.  It's quite a nuisance.  If I haven't worked, either at my aunt's coffee shop or at my mom's new crackhead building, my energy level becomes either apallingly high, or appallingly low.  And when it's high, I begin to do terribly foolish things, such as dance around like a fool in my bedroom, scantily clad and throwing punches and kicks (rather flimsy ones) all over the place.  I recorded this once just to make fun of myself, and yes, it does look like I'm having seisures.  It's amusing, but I absolutely refuse to subject anyone to such horrible... um... yeah.  Hey, if anyone's reading this, put a comment up.  About anything.  Philosophy is preferable.  I love debating about philosophy.  Not that I know much about it, but thinking about it is a human thing.  We all have our philosophies.  It's just that people forget that it is philosophy, not all religion.  Meh. Bye.
