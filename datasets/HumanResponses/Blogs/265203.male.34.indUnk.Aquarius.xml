         MOLLYNEWS.     Latest development. Molly is starting to figure out she can do stuff with her hands, apart from waving them about. She is playing with her fingers and trying to hold her bottles. Last night she was determined to grab an empty bag of crisps I was holding and and taste it. Is this child a genius or what?

         Urrgghh     Yuck - hangover today. Went to Gravity last night. great venue - had way too much Guinness. Home to very sad and overheated Molly. We ended up blowing on her in the middle of the night to cool her down. Worked like a charm. She is in much better humour today - and is having a sleep with Lally right now.  I'm in work all day today. Me and Paula hacking away at the coalface. I may never drink a certain well known soft drink again in my life, ever.  Make it go away.

         MOLLYNEWS     Molly had a fun weekend. On Saturday we spent the morning singing Winnie the Pooh songs and gurgling. The Eyeore song is definitely her favorite. If anyone wants a transcript of the Lyrics email Molly.  Sunday we visited the Garden Show in the RDS (Not very good BTW). She also had lunch in Yamamori with her Granny O'T.

         CALL FOR ENTRIES     Anyone want to to do black and white drawings to keep Molly amused? I'm looking for simple shapes/doodles with no greys etc to stick over her cot. She seems to get a buzz from looking at shapes - she is fascinated by Nigels drawing in our front room, and by the set of black keys Orna gave me - which hangs over where I change her nappy. Abstract shapes probably - nothing scary (big faces etc) maybe letterforms.  I'll post the best ones here.  later - DOT

       BABYNEWS  Molly did he biggest PUKE I've ever seen this morning!!  I was out the door and halfway to the hospital before Mary Bowen told me it was perfectly normal. Luckily she got me before I made a fool of myself in the A&E.   OTHERSTUFF  Aiden won a GBDA IDEA award last week. Well done Aido. Full news on  www.bfk.ie/grey/unshocked/newsindex.htm  All glory and honour to you, etc...  _____   I got another new bike last night. The chap in the bike shop was very apologetic about the heap of crap they sold me first. So I now have a nice shiny red and black mountain bike with a decent set of gears and a saddle that won't make Molly an only child.  Daragh O'Toole - Urban Road Warrior

      I bought a new bike yesterday. My last one was stolen from outside the office about a week ago. My fault - I left it with no lock overnight.   That makes eleven bikes in 8 years or so. Is this a record?  The worst part is the way the Guards seem to regard bike theft as a non crime.  The good news is that we have the little feckers who nicked on security camera. I feel a few slaps coming on...  _______________________  MOLLYNEWS  We had a good weekend of gurgles and smiles. Molly was a big hit at her Aunty Mia's BBQ. She also moved into her new cot on Friday night. It's huge - but I'm sure she will fill it soon.   New Molly pics coming to this site soon.

                  Getting bored of this layout so I've decided to change the whole site. I've created a new template for the Molly section using layers which I think I might adapt for the rest. Last time I used layers was for the first version of Lorraines site and it was a disaster - nothing worked properly and half the people visiting had steam driven browsers...  We got tickets for Slane today... I'm not a huge U2 fan (and I think Ash are gimps) but seems like it will be a good day. I'm going to drive up and not drink. (You can stop laughing now).

           TURNING and turning in the widening gyre  The falcon cannot hear the falconer;  Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold;  Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world,  The blood-dimmed tide is loosed, and everywhere  The ceremony of innocence is drowned;  The best lack all conviction, while the worst  Are full of passionate intensity.   Surely some revelation is at hand;  Surely the Second Coming is at hand.  The Second Coming! Hardly are those words out  When a vast image out of 'Spiritus Mundi'  Troubles my sight: somewhere in sands of the desert  A shape with lion body and the head of a man,  A gaze blank and pitiless as the sun,  Is moving its slow thighs, while all about it  Reel shadows of the indignant desert birds.  The darkness drops again; but now I know  That twenty centuries of stony sleep  Were vexed to nightmare by a rocking cradle,  And what rough beast, its hour come round at last,  Slouches towards Bethlehem to be born? .

                  Finally made it to Slane on Saturday. We arrived just before Moby came onstage and I have to say he was excellent - much better than expected.  And then it was time for the 'biggest, bestest' band in the world.  Wow - I couldn't wait.  Two songs into the set I realised - hey, the sound is crap, they aren't messing around with the echo for a laugh.   We were standing about near the top of the hill - right in the middle. All we could hear was a huge echo through most of the gig. Everytime Bono would say something we'd hear it twice. It was like hearing the whole gig from the bottom of a swimming pool. Excuse my language but it was a F**KING MESS.  How can the production team of the biggest band in the world screw up like this. Did anyone bother with a soundcheck!!!!  Ash must have done, Moby certainly did. What is the story?  I know people further down the hill had a great time and I'm sure a lot of people didn't even notice but there must have been a couple of thousand people standing around me looking at each other in disbelief.  And then to make it worse - just at the end the sound was mysteriously fixed - so we heard "Walk On' perfectly.  One song ????  Not good enough.

          Artificial Intelligence        AI - bag of shite... great value for money though... 3 movies in one.. why is it than when Hollywood tries to do serious SF it all ends horribly... super duper evolved robots don't have to look like cocktail sticks.. That kid only has one expression... Jude Law will do ANYTHING for money (although Gattaca was v.good)..my final opinion - if you want interesting SF that will make you think READ A BOOK.. A good start would be the short story 'Super Toys Last All Summer' by Brian Aldiss - which this piece of poo is (v. broadly) based on. Much sadder and much shorter... from there move onto anything Aldiss wrote - Helliconia Spring, Summer and Winter are brilliant if you have a couple of weeks spare... If you are really interested in reading SF have a lurk   urlLink here   - you might pick up some ideas on where to start. PS avoid anything with an elf on the cover that comes in seven parts...

          Urban Myths and jumping to conclusions...        This is from www.mediawhore.co.nz  Important! I am not usually in scare-mongering and internet-based rumour  spreading, however this came to me earlier to day and it  is something I felt I ought  to share. I am sure that like minded people will understand/appreciate this  warning. Yesterday my Auntie's friend's daughter was on the on the train travelling from Johannesburg to Cape Town. A man of Arabic-appearance got  off the train and she noticed that he had left his bag behind. She grabbed the bag and ran after him, caught up with him at the  top of the stairs and handed  him back his bag. He was extremely grateful  and reached into his bag which appeared to contain large bundles of bank notes. He offered her a reward, but  she refused. So he looked round, made sure nobody was looking and whispered to her: "I can never repay your kindness, but I will try to with a word of advice for you." "Stay away from The Hard  Rock Cafe".  She was terrified. "Is there going to be an attack?" she  whispered. "No" he whispered back "I went there yesterday evening  - the food was shit and the waitress was fucking rude."

      I've been lurking for a while on soc.history.what-if - its a brilliant newsgroup,  full of gems like the following (well worth a look) thread on 'Alternate' books  "Primary Colors" -- Fred Rogers' gentle guide to children's art activities, preschool through grade 3.  "Kramer vs. Kramer" -- The indefatigable and fuzzy-haired science officer of the starship _Seinfeld_ is split into good and evil twins by a transporter malfunction.  After much complication and conflict, he's restored to whatever state may be regarded as normal for him by _Seinfeld_'s chef, the redoubtable Soup Nazi, who dices up both twins and reconstitutes them by means of a rewired food replicator.  A new title in the _Star_Drek_ series.  "To Kill a Mockingbird" -- The offical NRA guide to precision shooting of small, hard-to-hit and utterly inoffensive avian targets.  Foreword by Charlton Heston.  "Guadalcanal Diary" -- Paul Theroux details the manifold wonders of this Pacific paradise, one of the key hospitality developments of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere.  "Crusade in Europe" -- William Shakespeare's verse-form history of Henry V's triumphal eviction of Islamic forces from the continent.  1. "Private Parts": Renowned sex therapist Howard Stern discusses human sexuality and reproduction in a hard-hitting no nonsense fashion.  2. "The Hunt For Red October": The story about a time traveler from a Soviet-dominated future seeking to undo the Russian Revolution by any means necessary, and succeeding in creating a timeline where the USSR collapses in 1991 leading to European continental unification by 1999. Written by Comrade Toma Clancy, subsequently debriefed by Soviet police upon its publication. Clancy subsequently gets ten years in Alaska for sedition.  3. "War and Peace": by Dostoievsky (sp), a brilliant Russian tactician, focusing on all aspects of warfare, from traditional military conflict to economic warfare and political subversion. Considered the modern version of Sun Tzu.  4. "My Struggle": By the world-famous Austrian mountaineer and Jewish convert Adolf Schicklegruber, combining mountain-climbing imagery with spiritual metaphors, the most well-known being the climbing of Mt. Sinai to meet God.  5. "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy": By Douglas Adams, it goes into detail the various sundry worlds of the Terran Confederation from the perspective of a stowaway on all sorts of spacecraft. It shares the Pulitzer Prize for Literature in 2098 with the autobiography "Star Trek" by space travel pioneer Gene Roddenberry.  6. "The Art of Talk" by Art Bell, it sparks a revolution in the field of speech pathology and therapy.  7. "The Firm": tawdry Triple-X pulp fiction by John Grisham, also known for his sex-novel about underwear, "The Pelican Brief".  8. "The Klingon Dictionary": by noted linguist Mark Okrand, who lived among the warlike aliens for several years learning their language. This work was instrumental in preventing the Enterprise Incident from leading to man's first ever interstellar war.  9. "The Hot Zone": Focuses on the tragedies of The Saharan Republic, the first nation in the world to employ the use of a supervirus in warfare.  10. "It Takes a Village": By noted Education Secretary Hillary Rodham, which in her book advocates nationalization of the (then private) education industry. A massive scandal about an affair between her and Bill Clinton leads to her being sacked (no pun intended) and a civil lawsuit by First Lady Gennifer Clinton    urlLink check it out here

      Sick all day yesterday - the cold that's doing the rounds laid me low for most of the day. Molly spent the day with her Granny so hoepfully she won't come down with it (fingers crossed). In between feeling sorry for myself I managed to finish the first book of the "His Dark Materials' trilogy by Phillip Pullman. This is being marketed as 'similar' to the Harry Potter books but IMHO is much more interesting. Very dark and kind of steampunky (without the punk).. The first book is called Northern lights (also called The Golden Compass in some editions) if you are interested. Good stuff.    urlLink article on Phillip Pullman here

      The Harry Potter film open last week to disappointing crowds. Although the book series is higher successful in both the UK and the US (Where HP and the Cup of Hot Stuff sold over a million copies in a week), the adaptation is seen by many fans as having taken too many liberties with the text. Due to an unfortunate contract, the author, Rowling (Pictured here soon after her purchase of the Canary Islands) had very little say in the manner in which the text was adapted for film. Certainly the move of Hogwarts from the UK to New England went over poorly with test audiences and even though Dick Van Dyke was hired to teach Culkin to use a Cockney accent after Speilberg bowed to protests and restored Harry's original nationality, many felt the accent to be less authentic than was hoped.

I now have scientific proof that babies are more interested in cardboard boxes and bits of string than expensive toys.. Molly also got her first two teeth over the holidays.. she's not sure what to make of them yet.. lots of dribbling and fingers in her mouth. Thank god for T-Gel and Tracy Chapman (who puts her too sleep in 3 minutes flat - does the same to me actually).  Congrats to Aiden and Valerie who just got engaged - should we start planning the stag now Aido??  BTW - Does anyone know how Tom Dunne got the part in LOTR??

      Managed to finish 'Dead Air' by Iain Banks last week. Not nearly as good as his earlier stuff, and not even in the same league as his Science Fiction books. It just kind of wanders around looking for a plot... couple of good jokes, nice cover... that's about it. I reckon he just doesn't give a shite anymore... loads of money and all the toys he wants.

The Euro really makes everything easier to do as you don't have to do all those mental calculations to figure out if you are being ripped off. Spain is really cheap. Can of beer for 60c!!  We hired a Ford Galaxy to get around (there was 6 of us plus suitcases, buggies and toys). Brilliant car, A/C, power steering and all those things that people who drive real cars take for granted.

      I think I should point out to anyone visiting that I'm not a 'web designer' (if it's not obvious), just a designer who occasionally does stuff for the web. So, my excuse for dodgy code, browser incompatibility and whatever else you think is wrong is the learning curve associated with all this interweb stuff. Plus, I have a life and job to be getting on with. That said I intend to gradually get around to creating something really interesting (for me anyway) that works.

      Adjusting the layout so you can make this layer invisable. I loaded all the 'random pics' without sizing them correctly, and I like the way the large ones sit behind the text layer. So I thought it would be cool if you could just click off the layer to reveal the image below.  Took Friday off work to go and sort out a new passport. I had to go and get a new birth cert first. Only took about an hour to do that. I was expecting to have to hang around for most of the day so i was a happy bunny.

They've run out of jobbing 'used to be famous' TV actors to strip of their dignity (Sally Fields, Alan Alda and erm..

Good Christ - they even had one of the characters moshing off the stage beside the brothers Hartnoll... Dr. Chen I think. So that's the end of ER as far as I'm concerned.

      Back from the second of two stags in as a many weeks - Aiden first and Robbie Bowen last weekend. Solid drinking over the course of a weekend is not good for the soul, liver or pocket. No hangover today but the oul Karma has taken a battering.  This is what Aiden and Benny looked like after last weekend - nuff said.

        mini review       Altered Carbon  and  Broken Angels  by Richard Morgan   Overrated by a long shot, hard-boiled cyber noir - extra points for cool tech (stacks and sleeves are good, spooky ancient martian tech - yawn). Let down by the sequel - big build up to not very much... including a twist(s) that I didn't even care about. and. ......why. does. every. character. talk. like. this?      Saying that I'd probably still buy a third book (which I'm sure is coming)... but that's because I have no willpower.

         Lally, myself and the small girl went to see Duffys Circus last weekend - we had a great time - tigers, clowns, acrobatic kick boxers, dancing ponies and candy floss - and we even got to have our pic taken with a huge snake.

      YAYYYY!!  Passed my driving test (at last). I was convinced I'd failed, stalled the car on the way out of the test centre and made a f??kin' mess of the reverse, so didn't expect to be handed the cert at the end.  Here comes cheaper insurance and best of all - driving cars on holidays... deadly buzz.

      After much NCTing, cert filing in and general stuff I finally got my new (and Paulas old) car. It is a 98 Renault Megane Coupe. 1.6 so it has a bit of a kick and it rocks. I've been volunteering to drive everyone everywhere the last week and the novelty still hasn't worn off.  The first thing Molly said was 'It's very yellow Daddy', which is true. I'm calling that a built in safety feature. And yellow is making a comeback bigtime. As our Anne said 'very Uma Thurman'. Here it is.

      Books I've bought/borrowed/stolen this year but have yet to finish.  Write Right by Jan Venolia.  Bought this on the strength of the cover design (by Paul Kepple). It's a guide to Punctuation, Grammar and Style. Nice and informal and easy to dip into.

      Currently testing my willpower by being alcohol free. Don't think I've  gone this long without a beer or glass of wine since the early  nineties. Wish I could say that my perceptions have sharpened and that  I've found a new way of looking at the world but it wouldn't be true.  Jaysus I'm dying for a pint.

      When you 'see' something, you do so only after the light reflected from that object has passed through the interventing air and dust and other particles, the cornea, the lens, the aqueous humour, and struck the retina, where the photons have activated G-protein coupled receptors, which in turn have disasscoiated from their tri-partate state, beginnning a signal cascade which potentiates membranes which cause electrical currents to flow  along nerves to synapses where neurotransmitters of various flavours are released by one neuron and absorbed by another, again causing a change in membrane potential. This goes on for some time, until the inputs from the various retinal cells along various neurons are re-assembled by other neurons in the visual cortex of the brain and the message is transmitted to the frontal cortex of the brain, where-upon you 'see' the object.

      We moved house on the 12th. it was all surprisingly easy. Stress free in fact, until we got to the new house.  Removal company arrived at 9.30 and were out in about 3 hours. Its a bit depressing to see all your worldly goods packed into a van and not even fill it.  Signed contracts at 2.30 and were in the new house around 3. Having spent the last week scrubbing and cleaning the old house within an inch of its life we were disappointed to find that the new house last received a wash sometime in the mid-sixties. It was manky. Very strong smell of fags and nearly every surface was coated in grease. So it was back to the scrubbing and scraping again.  Lots of work to do but everything seems to be going to plan. Main bedroom is painted and we should have a couple more rooms done by the end of the week. Floors are being sanded tomorrow and the kitchen starts to go in on Friday.    urlLink Here are some random pics.   More soon.

         urlLink latest issue of enlace.     Did this a few weeks ago in about 3 hours (that's my excuse anyway). Not as succesful as the first one. I had hoped to use Ziggurat for the heads and spend some more time developing the look around it... but sadly this is a zero budget project so it didn't happen.
