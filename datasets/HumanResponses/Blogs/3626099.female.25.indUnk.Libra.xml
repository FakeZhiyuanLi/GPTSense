       urlLink    &nbsp; urlLink     We both finished the Lit Riff stories tonight. It was only the second story I've ever actually completed in my life. It feels fantastic to look down at the green sheets so recently ripped from that steno notebook I stole from work and see all those words, those two characters I just pulled out of the ground.   It all started when E finally decided what song to use: "Piazza, New York Catcher" off of the new  urlLink Belle and Sebastian  album. He just whipped out a notebook and started writing. Which intimidated the crap out of me. So I popped on a few albums, got softhearted while listening to Ani Difranco, reminiscing about college. Then  urlLink David Garza  came on and college fully came rushing back. Memories of getting ready for a Friday night out at the bar, playing this one song at full blast while picking out a shirt. The competing bass of Sue's electronica blaring through our shared wall, the bustle of girls in the hallway, the blowdryer running in the bathroom, the voices shouting to each other up and down the stairs, the wonderful bustle of all that preparation for a night together, a night of opportunity and possibility and verve.   Once the song started playing, ideas came rushing at me. My pen started jotting them down and I realized I had found my inspiration. About a half hour later, E had laid down a page and a half of type-written paper down in front of me. I passed my little notebook over.   It feel cathartic to be able to sit down and just write an entire story start to finish. Reminded me that I AM able to do such things. That's I'm not an incapable oaf when it comes to writing. It was nice to remember that.

       urlLink    &nbsp; urlLink     Back in Massachusetts at my parents' house, we have a snowman. He used to decorate our front yard for Christmas every year, but now he's on the job year round, protecting the dead end from undesirables.   Recently when my father was in the hospital for some surgery, our dear snowman was the innocent victim of some well-natured, well...dressing by our neighbors. Personally, I think the island theme is quite fetching, given the season and all. He must get sick of just that hat. Poor naked snowman.

       urlLink    &nbsp; urlLink     I love this picture. It dates from a few months back, when E and I decided to head out to Ocean Beach and drink V. Sattui Zinfandel while watching the sun set. As we were walking back to the street, I noticed this couple and E started saying, "Get your camera, quick! Before you lose it!" Luckily we were just in time. So pretty.   I'm sorry if this blog sucks. I haven't quite figured out what I want to do with it. I orginally thought I'd be posting pics of things I was doing day to day, but I realize that I'm not really in the habit of taking pictures every day. And I'm not super comfortable using it as some kind of venting journal, because, well...that's what private journals are for, not public blogs on the internet that any Joe Schmo could read.  So I guess I'm just hoping that it'll evolve into something better. Something with good pictures and perhaps more words. I just haven't felt very inspired to write anything good lately.   I recently bought a book called  urlLink Lit Riffs . It's a compilation of short stories inspired by songs. I haven't read much of it yet, but E and I decided to make that a little assignment for ourselves. To write a short story based on a song we love. Our deadline was July 1. And you know what? I haven't even picked a song yet. I don't think he has either. :) It's just a lot harder than I anticipated. I'm clueless as to where I should start, music-wise. I was thinking of something off of Van Morrison's  urlLink Astral Weeks . Then I was listening to Dusty Springfield's  urlLink Dusty in Memphis  this morning. I just can't decide. There's just far too many good songs to choose from.   Maybe we can give ourself a deadline extension. God, I'm such a procrastinator.

       urlLink    &nbsp; urlLink     All my watching E make omelettes has finally paid off. My very first non-fallen apart omelette. Woohoo! I'm very proud of myself. Now I must go finish eating it. :)

       urlLink    &nbsp; urlLink     This picture was taken almost a month ago in Florida on vacation. A somewhat odd picture, but I love it anyway. I had just discovered the black and white capability on my camera and my poor sister was the brunt of a bunch of candid shots. But I like this one the most. :) Something about the blur and lack of color. It just feels right.

       urlLink    &nbsp; urlLink     If only Pedro hadn't sucked in the first inning, perhaps Saturday's game against the Giants would have ended differently. Or if David Ortiz hadn't tried to lug his giant, unwieldy body to second base trying to stretch that single into a double. Losing 2 out of 3 to SF did NOT make me happy, especially with a budding Giants fan in my apartment. At least Arroyo pitched well.   God bless the digital zoom feature. I've had not-so-good luck with it in the past, but this shot actually didn't come out too bad. And considering it was taken from deep in the center field bleachers...

       urlLink    &nbsp; urlLink     Finally! A picture from today. I talked E into coming downtown a little early to have a picnic lunch with me in the grassy knoll behind my building. Iced coffee from Starbucks, turkey & bologna sandwiches, blueberries, Laughing Cow cheese and splendid Kosher Dills. We've been eating pickles like nobody's business lately.

       urlLink    &nbsp; urlLink     Ok, this picture dates back about a month, but I took it for a reason and never sent it to the person I took it for. Hopefully she will see it now. Crazy Swedes. And yes...the swedish meatballs were very good.  I just watched the Detroit Pistons win the Championship. :) Good for them...they played some amazing basketball against a team that was expected to squash them. Watching the Finals made me want to get into basketball again. The Celtics have been decent the past two years...I only hope that next year I'll remember all the excitement for basketball that I'm feeling right now and root for them more actively.   It's just hard being a long distance fan. Even now that the excitement from the beginning of baseball season has worn off, I barely find myself checking the Sox scores. Which is simply inexcusable. Hopefully the Giants/Sox game that I'm going to see on Saturday will energize me.

       urlLink    &nbsp; urlLink     I didn't even take this picture. It dates back to last year. Props to the wonderful girl who sent it to me to remind me of why I love New York City. :) There's nothing like a giant blow-up rat to express your union anger to the man.   So, I have a blog. I'm probably just going to use this to post pictures. I guess we'll see how it goes, eh?

       urlLink     &nbsp; urlLink      The infamous Seattle Monorail was broken, as well as my heart. Oh, how I longed to sing the Simpson's Monorail song while soaring for 90 seconds above the downtown streets of Seattle.   But on the upside, we spent a few hours at the Experience Music Project, the coolest museum I've ever been to. The exhibits were cool, but the best part by far was the Sound Lab. You could actually play instruments in these little soundproof rooms. So amongst all the little kiddies learning to play keyboards and electric guitar with their parents chasing them around, we entered a guitar room. I totally forgot that E can play guitar, so when I starting painfully trying to rock out on an acoustic guitar, I was flabbergasted when I heard ACTUAL MUSIC coming from the electric guitar he'd picked up. It was very attractive. There's just something about guitar players.   About an hour later, I found myself alone inside the drum room. Me and a 8 piece drum kit. The helpful little computer program taught me which drums were which and had me rocking out in less than ten minutes. Screw the guitar...I fell in love with the drums. Especially that bass drum.   They also had these "Jam" rooms, where there was multiple instruments and you could go in and rock out (how many times am I going to use "rock out" in this post?) with your friends and loved ones! So, E and I went into a Jam room and it was perfection. I gave him a simple beat on the drums and he just starting playing some random tune on the electric guitar. At one point, I was doing the drum beat from The Ronette's "Be My Baby", while E tried to figure out the melody. E and Caz...a musical machine...it was awesome. And I'm using the word awesome in the truest, cheesiest manner possible. I felt like a rock star. The most exhilarating experience of the trip.  As we were walking out of the museum, E said, "I wonder how many parents hear, 'Mom, Dad, can you buy me a guitar???' after leaving this place."   To which I responded, "Can I have a drum kit? Pretty pretty please? With cherries on top?"   If/when we're ever "in the money", now there's a hobby I've spend money on. As well as getting my pilot's license. Ah dreams...

       urlLink    &nbsp; urlLink     This is a shot from the Fish Ladder at the Chittendon Locks. There's a dam and a bunch of locks where Puget Sound meets Lake Washington. The water goes from salt to fresh and from 26 feet depth to 6 feet depth. It was amazing watching the boats come in the locks and watch them lose twenty feet of elevation.   But the fish ladder was also quite cool, watching the poor salmon struggle upstream. I just love the eerie green color of the observation windows. Beautiful fish, though.

       urlLink    &nbsp; urlLink     It's not really called that. The lodge on the hill is called Salish Lodge and Spa and the waterfalls are Snoqualmie falls. It's all about 35 miles east of Seattle.   And if you don't recognize it, it's the area where they shot Twin Peaks. We had to go out there and take some pics. We also splurged on a four course country breakfast at the lodge. I can't even describe how good the breakfast was. Let's just say that it was the most fantastic breakfast I've ever eaten.

       urlLink   &nbsp; &nbsp; urlLink      I'm just a sucker for parent/child shots, especially at a baseball game. I have such fond memories of Fenway Park as a kid, worshipping Oil Can Boyd because of his cool nickname.

       urlLink     urlLink     On Tuesday, we visited Safeco Field for the Mariners vs. Red Sox. Lowe pitched fairly well, considering how shitty he's been this season. And we managed to scrape out a win against one of the worst teams in baseball. Geez, you'd think we could've actually won both games.   But Safeco was very cool. The bullpen's were out in left field, and you could walk down there and lean up against the chained fence and watch the reliever's warm up. Stupid me was so enamored of how cute Keith Foulke was that I didn't get any pictures of him when he was standing four feet away from me, flinging fastballs to Jason Varitek. Sigh.   It was fun watching a drunk Seattle fan get tossed from the stadium for taunting Foulke repeatedly. I despise drunk fans of all teams, including my own. But I find it especially funny when they start taunting players to their face, yelling things like, "You suck. Way to lose!". All I can think is, "Damn. He's taunting a guy who have far more baseball skills in his left pinky than he has in his entire body. A man who gets paid millions of dollars a year to play BASEBALL." What a jerk.

       urlLink     urlLink     So here are some shots of our recent trip to Seattle. This is one of my favorites. Just a perfect picture postcard shot of downtown taken from a lovely little park with a great view in Queen Anne Hill.

       urlLink     &nbsp; urlLink     &nbsp;  This one's for you, Ames.  &nbsp;  Recently, E and I were wandering through the Botanical Gardens in Golden Gate Park. We had some sandwiches on one bench near the Cloud Forests and made friends with an enormous blue bird, some little finches and a whole family of squirrels. I'm sure the fact that we were tossing them granola had something to do with their friendship.  &nbsp;  Alas, after finishing the sandwiches, we wandered away to find a warmer, sunnier bench to do some reading.&nbsp;And we both starting laughing when we realized there was a squirrel following us. He did so at a distance, but it was clear it was us he was after.  &nbsp;  Soon enough, we found a great bench up on a little hill overlooking a path below. And in a few minutes, we were surrounded. Squirrels from every angle. One even was brave enough to jump up on the back of the bench and start sniffing around our bags.  &nbsp;  It was very funny, yet scary at the same time.

       urlLink    &nbsp; urlLink     Just came home from seeing  Fahrenheit 9/11 . As much as I tried to go into the movie feeling neutral, I still left the theater feeling enraged, disappointed and sad. While I've been skeptical about Moore and his tactics in the past, this movie really shook something loose inside me. I don't even know what to write right now. I just know I'm not quite ready to go to sleep. I feel a bit lost.   As we were walking down Mission towards the car, I couldn't help looking at all the strangers who were just going on with their nights. Despite the round of applause as the credits rolled, I felt so disconnected with all those strangers. I had a strange deep urge to just hug someone, to just make contact. Can you imagine what their reaction would have been? Fear and confusion. That makes me really sad just to think how inaccesible people can be. How do we touch base, make a difference, change a life? How do we change an entire world?   I need to post a picture that reminds me of the possibilities of human life. The good stuff. One simple way we can connect and touch other people. The simplest way possible.  Hell, maybe Buddhism IS for me after all. :)

       urlLink    &nbsp; urlLink     From the Fourth of July parade in Piedmont with Annika and her family. This little boy was just so adorable, I could have eaten him. Come to think of it, I actually had a conversation with his father about how eatable little children truly can be. You just want to snack off of their cute faces.   Have I shared too much?

       urlLink      urlLink     I took the 7 Haight bus to Cala Foods across the street from Amoeba Music tonight. And on the bus, I took out the camera and started playing around. I set it on sepia and just starting maniacally clicking from my nice window seat. I must have taken about 30 pictures in the span of about 5 minutes. Just one click of the button after another. I was just curious to see what I'd get.  This is one of my favorites. There were a lot of doozies, but a couple really nice shots. E especially liked the guy on the left...he's totally in the "I'm the epitome of cool" stance. It's just great.

       urlLink      urlLink     Let me just say this first. This picture is of  urlLink Steve Lyons , one of my favorite Red Sox players of the past. Aka Psycho. I love him, really. He'll never be in the Hall of Fame, but he was funny,  he loved the game and he played hard. He's a sportscaster now and I'm really glad he's still in baseball. I'm currently reading his book,  urlLink Pyschoanalysis  and it's great.  But why must he be wearing a mullet on the back cover of the book? He looks like such a massive dork! Sigh. When I'm riding MUNI to work in the morning, I worry that people see this and wonder what kind of white-trash shenanery I'm reading. They probably think I like Jeff Foxworthy too. Damn you Steve Lyons and your silly old picture of your mullet!

       urlLink     urlLink     I don't know why I have such a penchant for parent/child shots. I love children, but there's just something utterly charming about these shots. Moments of that particular relationship captured on film (or digital doodaddery in this case). Just something about it.

       urlLink      urlLink     E and I realized that last night's Giants vs. Cubs game was the ninth game we've seen together since last summer. I've definitely seen more games in the last few years than normal. I like that. He's now such baseball addict, he says that he wants to go see at least one Giants game a month. I love how addicted he is. He's busy reading Tim McCarver's  urlLink Baseball for Brain Surgeons and Other Fans  after he's read my Leonard Koppett's  urlLink Thinking Fan's Guide to Baseball .  So the Giants won, so he was happy. Although Nomar had a kickass night. He went three for four, hit two doubles and a single. I was happy for him, especially as he was one of the few Cubbies steadily hitting against Schmidt (who had ten strikeouts). But it was wistful too. Seeing him play short, wearing the blue and grey uniform. Sigh.  And I taught Eufrey how to keep score. Although I had to rack my brain on some plays. I haven't really kept score since high school, so when Pedro Feliz made a stupid baserunning error and got tagged out between second and third and Bonds scooted over to second in the hullabaloo...I had no clue how to score that. Oops.  But yes, baseball is a huge part of our life at the moment. Lots of games (in person, on tv, even on the radio when our lack of cable curses us). Seeing as both the Sox and the Giants seem stuck on fighting for the Wild Card for the playoffs, we're both frustrated with their sub-par play and still struggling for hope that we have a shot in the playoffs.  It was nice hearing all those Cubbies fans last night cheering so loudly for Nomar, though.
